<text>Spiral (Rita Wayword) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, usually those featuring the X-Men family of characters. Created by writer Ann Nocenti and artist Art Adams, the character first appeared in &quot;Longshot&quot; #1 (September 1985). She was established as a lieutenant for that titular character&#x27;s archenemy, Mojo. Prior to Longshot joining the X-Men, Spiral also became a recurring adversary of that team and each of the various X-Men subgroups, as well as serving as the archenemy-turned-ally of X-Men member Psylocke. She then joined a team of X-Force led by X-Men member Storm.

==Publication history==
Spiral first appeared in issue #1 of the 1985 &quot;Longshot&quot; miniseries by Ann Nocenti and Art Adams (though her alter ego Ricochet Rita did not debut until the second issue of the series), and subsequently appeared two months later as a member of Mystique&#x27;s Freedom Force team in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #199. Spiral began as one of 20 minor characters that Adams designed on a character sheet as the pursuers of the character Longshot. Her six arms were inspired by deities in Hindu mythology. Although Adams gave little thought to Spiral, as he had developed ideas for the other characters he had drawn on the sheet, Nocenti decided to make her a major character, and gave her the name Spiral. The character sheet is reproduced in the back of the &quot;X-Men: Longshot&quot; hardcover collection.

In the final issue of the limited series, Spiral is hinted to be a former lover of Longshot. Chris Claremont portrayed her as having a pathological hatred for Longshot, and implied that the two were former lovers during a hallucinatory dream sequence in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #248.

As conceived, Spiral and Ricochet Rita were two separate entities. When the character was co-opted by Claremont for use in the pages of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;, this was continued with Rita appearing in the pages of &quot;Excalibur: Mojo Mayhem&quot; and &quot;Uncanny X-Men Annual&quot; #12 as a prisoner of Mojo.

In &quot;X-Factor Annual&quot; #7, writer Fabian Nicieza established that Rita and Spiral were the same person, and that her hatred for Longshot was driven by her desire for revenge from being taken prisoner, driven insane, and physically modified by Mojo and his chief scientist Arize. It also stated that after turning her into Spiral (an event that will take place at some point in the future), Mojo sent her back to the past to serve his past self and set forth the chain of events that will lead to Rita becoming Spiral.

==Fictional character biography==

Spiral&#x27;s real name is Rita Wayword, better known as &#x27;Ricochet Rita&#x27;. She was a professional stuntwoman who befriended Longshot when he first appeared on Earth. Rita was attacked by her evil, future self which led to her meeting Longshot and falling in love with him. When Longshot sought to return to his home dimension, the Mojoverse, the lovestruck Rita went with him, only to watch Longshot fail and be captured by the dimension&#x27;s evil overlord, Mojo. Longshot was promptly mindwiped to forget all about Rita, while a much worse fate was left for her.

===Becoming Spiral===
After holding her prisoner for several years (at which point Rita was made to serve as guardian for Mojo&#x27;s army of &quot;X-Babies&quot;), Mojo forced his chief scientist, Arize, to perform extreme physical and mental modifications on Rita to recreate her as a loyal subordinate. These experiments left her with six arms (two of which were robotic), turned her hair white, and drove the young woman insane through forcibly evolving Rita&#x27;s mind to the point that she could see into other dimensions that were used for time-travel/teleportation. He also trained her in the dark arts of magic and body modification, so that she could use these skills to mutilate others as Mojo had mutilated her. Finally, in a cruel act of manipulation, Mojo sent Spiral back in time to set into motion the events that led to her former self becoming Mojo&#x27;s prisoner and become Spiral by attacking her past self.

===Freedom Force===
In the past, Spiral found herself stranded on Earth by Mojo for failing to kill Longshot and Rita. At some unknown point, Spiral encountered Val Cooper and was recruited into Freedom Force, a revamped version of the second Brotherhood of Mutants. Despite being utterly insane and more blood-thirsty than her new teammates, Spiral quickly became a valuable member of the team, singlehandedly defeating the X-Men on several occasions as well as kidnapping the X-Man Rachel Summers for Mojo. She was also instrumental in Freedom Force&#x27;s victory over the Avengers and the West Coast Avengers when sent by the U.S. government to arrest the heroes. Her magical powers temporarily robbed Captain Marvel of her energy powers and she also defeated Iron Man, removing two of the most powerful Avengers from the battle.

===Body Shoppe===
She also ran the &quot;Body Shoppe&quot;, which sells alien cybernetic parts to amputees and others who seek the power of cybernetic limbs. Most notably, Spiral transformed Lady Deathstrike into a cyborg; upgraded the cyborgs Cole, Macon, and Reece originally created by Donald Pierce; and installed the cybernetic eyes in Betsy Braddock&#x27;s original body, which doubled as cameras for Mojo to spy on the X-Men.

===Psylocke&#x27;s transformation===

Along with Mojo, Spiral was shown to have played a role in Betsy Braddock&#x27;s physical appearance changing from that of a purple-haired Anglo-Saxon to an East Asian. Originally, it was believed that the two literally transformed Braddock&#x27;s original European body to an Asian one, but it was revealed that Spiral (without Mojo&#x27;s involvement) transferred the X-Man&#x27;s mind into the body of the Japanese assassin Kwannon. She also merged the two women&#x27;s minds and genetic structures, giving each of them personality traits and physical characteristics of the other, as well as halving Psylocke&#x27;s telepathy between them. This led to much confusion as to which of the two was the real Elizabeth Braddock when Revanche first appeared. Other than malicious intent, Spiral&#x27;s reasons for doing this (if any) are still unknown.

Even though she was a loyal servant of Mojo, Spiral deeply resented Mojo&#x27;s crass manners and cruelty towards her. In particular, Spiral has been known to go against Mojo&#x27;s orders and attack Longshot out of a psychotic need for revenge for Longshot&#x27;s seduction of her and how her love for him led to her transformation into the being she is today. As such, Mojo has been known to leave Spiral stranded on Earth without her power, which she needs to travel safely between dimensions.

===Crimson Dawn and Viper===
The Dragons of the Crimson Dawn, a group of monks with ties to the Crimson Dawn, managed to journey to the Wildways, another Magical dimension and the home of Spiral when not serving Mojo. They needed the woman to help them teleport to Earth, but when Spiral refused to aid them, she was threatened with torture that was even beyond her Body Shoppe’s capabilities and she reluctantly accepted to join them and received the mark of the Crimson Dawn. Actually Spiral thought she could outsmart the Dragons at one point, but the Crimson Dawn’s influence was too strong and she had no choice but to release them on Earth, namely in London, where they attacked by surprise Psylocke&#x27;s twin brother, Captain Britain. They took him prisoner to their native Hong Kong, where they wanted to channel his powers into breaching the dimensional wall to the Crimson Dawn, thus enslaving Earth.

Spiral alerted Excalibur to the Dragons&#x27; plan, and despite the team&#x27;s initial distrust, teleported the team to Hong Kong. Another entity trying to spoil the plan was Xiandu&#x27;s spirit, who told Meggan, the only one to sense him, that like him the Dragons of the Crimson Dawn were from the time China was overrun by the barbarian Li-Tzu Ch&#x27;eng. They had prayed that the kingdom would be spared the endless bloodshed, but the Ming dynasty ended anyway. Frustrated that their prayers hadn’t been answered, Xiandu and three of his friends, Ra&#x27;al, Barak and A&#x27;yin, went down the darkest road they would ever travel. In the pitch of night they were initiated into a covenant that promised to repel China’s oppressors. Xiandu underestimated the might of the Crimson Dawn, and only learned that his friends had been corrupted by it in the night they killed him. In the instant his life ended, Barak, A&#x27;yin and Ra&#x27;al found themselves transformed into the Dragons of the Crimson Dawn. Xiandu&#x27;s spirit remained on Earth, wandering around to await their inevitable escape from the Crimson realm. The spirit revealed to Meggan that not only her abilities but also her love for Brian was needed to rescue him and stop the two worlds from merging into one. While the rest of Excalibur temporarily held the Dragons of the Crimson Dawn at bay, Meggan helped Brian redirect the power flow, releasing it safely into the atmosphere. While Brian survived, he was Captain Britain no more, his powers gone. The Dragons left by melting into the shadows, vowing that one day they would succeed and rule Earth.

Spiral then returned to the Wildways and Mojo, who purged her of all traces of the Crimson Dawn&#x27;s influence over her. She then was sent to help the terrorist known as the Viper, who had acquired the long missing younger siblings of the New Mutant Karma and sought Spiral&#x27;s help in modifying them so as to serve as minions of the villainess. The plan would fail when Spiral and Viper sent the two modified children to attack the X-Men. Beast and Cannonball defeated Spiral and Viper and Spiral was forced to restore the children.

===&quot;House of M&quot;===
Just prior to the &quot;House of M&quot; storyline, Spiral and Mojo attacked the X-Men during a training session in the Danger Room. Spiral transforms most of the X-Men into their X-Baby forms, but is unable to do the same to Psylocke due to their connection. Spiral is however able to paralyze Betsy and conjure a gag for her, and later uses her abilities to torment the mutant before the X-Babies defeat Mojo and return to their normal states. After this, Emma Frost claims that she intends to use her powers to ensure that Mojo and Spiral will never be able to bother the X-Men again, though it would seem this threat was never carried out.

===&quot;The Apocalypse&quot;===
In the &quot;X-Force: Shatterstar&quot; miniseries, Spiral is revealed to have conquered an alternate timeline and referred to herself as &quot;The Apocalypse&quot;. She managed to kill most of that Earth&#x27;s heroes, and only Cable and some of his X-Force/New Mutants allies were left. Spiral had kidnapped that universe&#x27;s Sunspot and tortured him by raping him until his rescue. It is implied that, with the aid of Shatterstar, Spiral was defeated and returned to Mojo&#x27;s services. She later attacked the X-Men together with Mojo, but ended up defeated once again.

===&quot;Endangered Species&quot;===
Spiral was among the nine criminal geniuses whom Beast seeks out to reverse the effects of the 2005 storyline &quot;Decimation&quot;. Mojo himself was another.

Later, Spiral teleported to Beast, claiming that Mojo was displeased with the fact mutants are now an endangered species and, while Beast asked for her help, her boss Mojo demanded it. Spiral commented that science was blinding him to find the real solution to answer how to save mutantkind. Spiral tells him that energy dances its way through everything, keeping her out, that it is beyond anything her Body Shoppe can simply fix, and that the death of mutants was not caused by science, and it would not be saved by science.

Her last comments before teleporting away were: &quot;Put aside what you know. For where science ends... magic begins&quot;.

===The Sisterhood of Mutants===
While repairing Lady Deathstrike after the events of Messiah Complex, Spiral is approached by the Red Queen and agrees to join her Sisterhood of Mutants.

After a brief confrontation with Domino, the Sisterhood steal Kwannon&#x27;s corpse from her grave in Tokyo. Madelyne performs a ceremony with Spiral&#x27;s assistance, transferring the soul of the kidnapped Psylocke back into her original body. Later the Sisterhood take on the X-Men. Spiral seriously injures Nightcrawler and Colossus while the Red Queen goes and fetches a lock of Jean Grey&#x27;s hair from Wolverine&#x27;s room before teleporting the Sisterhood back to base.

Back at base, the Sisterhood split up, leaving the Mastermind sisters and Psylocke behind while Spiral and the rest of the Sisterhood go to Jean Grey&#x27;s burial site. Spiral takes on Northstar and when Pryor is defeated, Spiral grabs the rest of the Sisterhood—Lady Deathstrike, Chimera, Lady Mastermind and Martinique Jason—and escapes with them.

===&quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot;===

At some point, Spiral was exiled back to Earth by Mojo. For reasons yet to be revealed, Mojo opted to further punish Spiral by way of removing her ability to teleport through dimensions. Furious, Spiral set up shop in Los Angeles where she took in a homeless girl who happened to be a new mutant. She then joined Storm’s incarnation of X-Force and became a superhero. 

==Powers and abilities==
Spiral has powerful mystical abilities. When Spiral was first introduced, she was a powerful sorceress and during her first two encounters with the X-Men, singlehandedly defeated the team. She can cast spells to stun, depower, or immobilize her superhuman opponents, as she did to depower and imprison the Avengers and West Coast Avengers once they were lying still long enough for the spells to catch them. On a mission to capture Magneto as part of Mystique&#x27;s Freedom Force, Spiral was able to cast spells to negate Magneto&#x27;s powers and turn them back on himself, while subsequently casting a spell to bind him. Spiral has been able to psionically detect a speeding Super Sabre approaching Mystique&#x27;s base of operations and react fast enough to teleport outside the compound and afterwards trip the speedster. In &quot;New Avengers&quot; #53, she was revealed by the Eye of Agamotto as one of several magic-users with the potential to be the next Sorcerer Supreme after Doctor Strange. Spiral&#x27;s spellcasting powers can be triggered through small gestures of her many hands. With the gestures, she can teleport herself and numerous people across great distances. More powerful spells require more complicated dance moves. Spiral can open gateways between dimensions and travel through time, although it has been implied that she sometimes requires Mojo&#x27;s help to successfully teleport from one dimension to another. At other times, she has independently traversed dimensions and centuries of time, and set herself slightly out of phase with the timestream so as to avoid blows. Spiral often incorporates knives and swords into more complicated spells. Spiral can also disguise herself through her magic.

Spiral&#x27;s mind is apparently immune to possession. When Rogue attempted to steal Spiral&#x27;s mind and powers, Spiral stole Rogue&#x27;s instead, laughing that she had danced in many people&#x27;s souls. Nocturne was fooled by Spiral into thinking Spiral had been possessed while Spiral remained in control.

According to Mystique, Spiral is aware whenever a person speaks her name by the usage of &quot;quasi-sentient sensors&quot;, which even filters out mundane uses of the word &quot;spiral&quot;. Due to her cybernetic enhancements, she has some limited level of superhuman physical attributes.

Spiral is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant, acrobat, and sword fighter. Her six arms are fully coordinated, giving her great dexterity and athletic ability. She has displayed enhanced durability, ranging from taking punches from Wonder Man, surviving falls from great heights, and tanking blasts of various kinds. 
Spiral has demonstrated highly developed skills in cybernetics and genetic manipulation which she has used to turn humans into powerful cyborgs at her Body Shoppe. The most notable include Lady Deathstrike and the cybernetic Reavers, who have since been &quot;upgraded&quot; by Donald Pierce.

<text>Steven Allen Finley (born March 12, 1965) is an American former center fielder in Major League Baseball who played for eight teams between 1989 and 2007, most notably the Houston Astros, San Diego Padres, and Arizona Diamondbacks. He is one of only two players, along with Matt Herges, to play for all five National League West teams. An outstanding all-around player with power, speed, and defensive skill, he is one of only four players since 1945 with 300 home runs and 100 triples, along with Stan Musial, Willie Mays, and George Brett. He is also one of three players, along with Mays and Ken Griffey Jr., to have 2,500 hits and win five Gold Glove Awards in center field.

A two-time All-Star (1997, 2000), Finley led the National League (NL) in triples twice, and helped the Diamondbacks win the 2001 World Series title, batting .368 in the Series. His walk-off grand slam in an October game against the San Francisco Giants clinched the 2004 division title for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Finley&#x27;s 2,487 career games as an outfielder ranked ninth in major league history when he retired, with his 2,314 games in center field trailing only Mays and Tris Speaker; he also ranked seventh among outfielders with 5,664 putouts. Since retiring he has worked for the Padres as a broadcast analyst and in player development, and also works for Morgan Stanley, advising athletes as a financial manager.

==Early life==
Finley grew up in Paducah, Kentucky. He attended Paducah Tilghman High School and Southern Illinois University, where he earned a degree in physiology and played for the baseball team from 1984 to 1987.

==Career==

===College, Team USA, and minor leagues===
In , Finley was selected by the Atlanta Braves in the 11th round of the draft, but did not sign. He instead chose to remain at SIU, where he was a two-time All-Missouri Valley Conference performer and a third-team All-American in 1986, and was named the team&#x27;s Most Valuable Player in 1987. He is a member of the Saluki Baseball Hall of Fame.

He was a member of the 1986 Team USA squad that won a bronze medal during international competition in the Netherlands.

In , he was selected by the Baltimore Orioles in the 13th round of the draft, and did sign.

In 919 at bats in the minor leagues, Finley batted .309 with 68 stolen bases.

On August 29, 2009, Finley was inducted into the Rochester Red Wings Hall of Fame.

===Orioles and Astros===
In a transaction considered by Orioles fans as the worst in team history according to Thom Loverro, Finley was traded along with Curt Schilling and Pete Harnisch to the Houston Astros for Glenn Davis on January 10, 1991. He joined an Astros organization that was for sale and lightening its payroll by going with younger, inexpensive players. That year he was third in the league in triples (10), sixth in hits (170), ninth in stolen bases (34), and tenth in sacrifice hits (10). His 13 outfield assists tied Barry Bonds and Paul O&#x27;Neill for third in the league.

In , he led the NL in games played (162), was second in triples (13), third in stolen bases (a career-high 44) and sacrifice hits (10), and seventh in hits (177).

In , he led the league in triples (13). He had been slowed in spring training by Bell&#x27;s palsy, a viral infection of a nerve in his upper neck, resulting in numbness that prevented him from closing his left eye.

In , he was second in the league in sacrifice hits (13), and tenth in triples (5). He appeared in only 94 games due to an injury and the strike-shortened season. He missed nearly a month after being hit by a pitch in a June 8 road game against the Montreal Expos, breaking the third metacarpal bone in his right hand. In December 1994, he was traded by the Astros with Ken Caminiti, Andújar Cedeño, Roberto Petagine, Brian Williams, and minor leaguer Sean Fesh to the San Diego Padres for Derek Bell, Doug Brocail, Ricky Gutiérrez, Pedro A. Martinez, Phil Plantier, and Craig Shipley.

===Padres and Diamondbacks===
In , Finley batted a career-high .297 and was third in the league in runs (104) and triples (8), and fourth in stolen bases (36) and hits (167). Finley also won his first Gold Glove Award. He was the only National League player to have 100 runs, 10 home runs, and 35 stolen bases. He stole a career-high 4 bases on August 12 vs. the St. Louis Cardinals. He was in the delivery room on September 1 when son Reed was born, and then headed to the ballpark and played in the 8th and 9th innings of San Diego&#x27;s 6–3 win over the Philadelphia Phillies.

He was named Most Valuable Player in the All-Stars Series between Japan and the United States (Tokyo, ). Later in 1996, during Rickey Henderson&#x27;s first season with San Diego, he boarded the team bus and was looking for a seat. Finley said, &quot;You have tenure, sit wherever you want.&quot; Henderson looked at Finley and said, &quot;Ten years? Rickey&#x27;s been playing at least 16, 17 years.&quot; That season, Finley was second in the NL in runs (126; a career high) and doubles (45), third in extra base hits (84), fourth in triples (9), and sixth in hits (195). Finley won his second Gold Glove Award and came in tenth in the MVP voting. He established Padres records in runs, doubles, extra base hits, and total bases.

In , he hit three home runs in a game twice (May 19 and June 23). Finley was voted to the All-Star team, and finished eighth in the league in runs (101).

He hit his first game-ending grand slam on April 10, 1998, for the Padres. The Padres would appear in the World Series that year against the New York Yankees, where they were swept in four games.

In December , he signed as a free agent with the Arizona Diamondbacks. In , he hit three home runs and had 6 runs batted in in a game on September 8. That season he had 34 home runs and a career-high 103 RBI, and was seventh in the league in extra base hits (76). Finley also won his third Gold Glove Award.

In , he had 35 home runs and a career-high .544 slugging percentage, and was ninth in the league in sacrifice flies (9). He was voted to the All-Star team. Finley also had 10 outfield assists and won his fourth Gold Glove Award. He was named the team co-Player of the Year with Luis Gonzalez by the Arizona chapter of the BBWAA.

In , Finley had a stellar postseason, leading the Diamondbacks with a .421 batting average in the National League Division Series and 5 RBI in the National League Championship Series as Arizona went on to win its first World Series. On August 30 of that year, Finley became the Diamondbacks&#x27; first position player to serve as a relief pitcher, during a 13–5 loss to the Giants. Finley would win the first and only World Series title of his career in 7 games against the Yankees, the same team he lost to three years prior in 1998 while with the Padres.

In , Finley led the league in triples (10), becoming the oldest player in major league history to lead his league in triples.

===Later years===
In July , he was traded by the Diamondbacks with Brent Mayne to the Dodgers for Koyie Hill, Reggie Abercrombie, and Bill Murphy (minors). On October 2, he hit his second career game-ending grand slam against the Giants, which capped off a seven-run ninth inning and clinched the 2004 NL West division title for the Dodgers. At the end of the season, he was eighth in at bats (628) and plate appearances (706), and ninth in home runs (36; the third-highest total ever for a 39-year-old in the majors, behind Barry Bonds and Hank Aaron). Finley also won his fifth Gold Glove Award and tied Pete Rose&#x27;s record of playing in 162 games at the age of 39.

In December 2004, Finley signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. In , he missed 18 games due to a strained right shoulder, his first disabled list stint since 1997. In December 2005, he was traded by the Angels to the Giants for Edgardo Alfonzo.

In 2006, at the age of 41, Finley became the oldest player ever to play more than 100 games in center field. He also reached several career milestones during his season with the Giants: On May 8 against Houston, he reached 4,000 total bases with a single in a 7–5 win. On June 14 in Arizona, he hit his 300th home run off Claudio Vargas to lead off the game, with the Giants going on to win 11–4. On July 23 against San Diego, he reached 2,500 hits with an RBI double and a single in a 12-inning 6–5 loss. And on August 7 in Arizona, he appeared in his 2,500th game, drawing a walk as a late-inning replacement in an 8–4 win. However, he ended the season with just a .246 average, batting only .235 with one home run and 9 RBI after June 25. On November 1, the Giants declined their option on Finley for the 2007 season, which made him a free agent. On February 24, 2007, Finley signed a minor-league contract with the Colorado Rockies. After an impressive spring, Finley made their Opening Day roster. On June 5, the Rockies designated Finley for assignment, giving the Rockies 10 days to trade, release, or send him to the minor leagues. Finley had batted .181 (17-for-94) with one home run and two RBIs in 43 games for Colorado. He was released on June 17. At the time of his release, of all active players, he was first in triples (124), third in games (2,583) and at bats (9,397), fourth in hits (2,548), seventh in runs (1,443), eighth in total bases (4,157), and ninth in doubles (449) and stolen bases (320). He was also the sixth-oldest player in the NL.

<text>Murad Wilfried Hofmann (1931 – 13 January 2020) was a German diplomat and author. He wrote several books on Islam, including &quot;Journey to Makkah&quot; () and &quot;Islam: The Alternative&quot; (). Many of his books and essays focused on Islam&#x27;s place in the West and, after 11 September, in particular, in the United States. He was one of the signatories of A Common Word Between Us and You, an open letter by Islamic scholars to Christian leaders, calling for peace and understanding.

==Biography==
Hofmann was born in Aschaffenburg to an intellectual family related to Hugo Ball, a co-founder of Dadaism. Although raised a Catholic, he converted to Islam in 1980. He studied at Harvard University. His conversion was met with some controversy due to his high profile in the German government. He converted to Islam as a result of what he witnessed in the Algerian War of Independence, his fondness for Islamic art, and what he saw as contradictions in Paulist Christian doctrine.
Hofmann served in the German Foreign Service from 1961 to 1994. He first served in Algeria as a specialist on issues concerning nuclear defence. He went on to serve as Director of Information for NATO at Brussels from 1983 to 1987, Ambassador to Algeria from 1987 to 1990, and Ambassador to Morocco from 1990 to 1994.
Hofmann was an honorary member and advisor to the Central Council of Muslims in Germany.

<doc id="1035805" wikidata="Q75991" url="?curid=1035805" title="Dieter F. Uchtdorf">
<text>Dieter Friedrich Uchtdorf (born 6 November 1940) is a German aviator, airline executive and religious leader. He is a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Called as an apostle in 2004, he served as Second Counselor to Thomas S. Monson in the church&#x27;s First Presidency from 2008 until Monson&#x27;s death on 2 January 2018. Currently, Uchtdorf is the fifth most senior apostle in the ranks of the church.

==Early life and education==
Uchtdorf was born to German parents Karl Albert Uchtdorf and Hildegard Else Opelt in Moravská Ostrava (), which at the time was in the Nazi-occupied Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (now Ostrava, Czech Republic). His father was a customs officer, who was conscripted into the German Army toward the end of World War II and sent to the western front. When a young child, Uchtdorf traveled with his mother and three siblings through areas being bombed in a move to Zwickau in eastern Germany. He later said of this period: &quot;We were refugees with an uncertain future... I played in bombed-out houses and grew up with the ever-present consequences of a lost war and the awareness that my own country had inflicted terrible pain on many nations during the horrific World War II.&quot; As a result of his grandmother&#x27;s encounter with a member of the LDS Church in a soup line, Uchtdorf&#x27;s family joined the LDS Church when he was still young.

When Uchtdorf was about eleven, his father&#x27;s political beliefs, incongruent with Soviet rule, earned him the label of &quot;dissenter&quot;, thus putting their lives in danger. They fled East Germany and resettled in U.S.-occupied West Germany. His sisters accomplished this by jumping from a moving train that happened to pass through West Germany, while Dieter and his mother climbed a mountain to avoid GDR guard checkpoints.

Uchtdorf started studying mechanical engineering at age 18 but later continued in business administration in Cologne and graduated from Institut pour l&#x27;Etude des Methodes de Direction de l&#x27;Entreprise (today the International Institute for Management Development) in Lausanne, with an MBA. He received an honorary doctorate in international leadership from Brigham Young University during the April 2009 graduation ceremony.

==Aviator==
When Uchtdorf was conscripted into the newly formed Bundeswehr in 1959, he volunteered for the air force, at age 19, to become a fighter pilot. Due to an agreement between the West German and US governments, Uchtdorf trained as a fighter pilot in Big Spring, Texas, where he excelled, earning the coveted Commander&#x27;s Trophy (USAF) for being the best student pilot in his class. After earning wings from both the German and US air forces, he served for six years as a fighter pilot in West Germany, leaving in 1965 to join Lufthansa. By 1970, at 29 years of age, Uchtdorf had reached the rank of captain with Lufthansa. He was appointed in 1975 as head of Lufthansa&#x27;s new Arizona Training School in the US, and in 1980 he was made head chief pilot of cockpit crews, followed by appointment to senior vice president of flight operations in 1982. He left Lufthansa in 1996, two years after being called as an LDS Church general authority.

==LDS Church service==

Uchtdorf served twice as a stake president in the LDS Church, presiding over the Frankfurt and the Mannheim stakes.

Uchtdorf was called as a general authority and member of the church&#x27;s Second Quorum of the Seventy on 2 April 1994. On 7 April 1996, he was transferred to the First Quorum of Seventy. Uchtdorf became a member of the church&#x27;s Presidency of the Seventy on 15 August 2002.

===Apostle===
Uchtdorf was sustained a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on 2 October 2004. He was ordained an apostle on 7 October 2004 by church president Gordon B. Hinckley. Uchtdorf and David A. Bednar were called to fill the vacancies created by the July 2004 deaths of quorum members David B. Haight and Neal A. Maxwell. Uchtdorf was the first church apostle ordained in the 21st century. As an apostle, Uchtdorf is accepted by the church as a prophet, seer, and revelator.

Uchtdorf is the eleventh apostle of the LDS Church to be born outside the United States. He is the first German apostle in church history and was the first born outside of North America since the death of John A. Widtsoe in 1952.

While in Slovakia on 12 May 2006, Uchtdorf offered a prayer dedicating the land &quot;for the preaching of the gospel&quot;, an LDS Church leadership custom usually observed at the time missionaries arrive in a new country. Although missionaries had been in what is now Slovakia for over a century, since the split with the Czech Republic, this dedication was specific for the new country.

===Counselor in the First Presidency===
On 3 February 2008, Uchtdorf became the Second Counselor to Thomas S. Monson in the church&#x27;s First Presidency. He is the second non-English native speaker to have served in the First Presidency. After joining the First Presidency, Uchtdorf became a naturalized US citizen; he has remained a citizen of Germany.

While serving in the First Presidency, Uchtdorf dedicated the Tegucigalpa Honduras, Quetzaltenango Guatemala, Manaus Brazil, Fort Lauderdale Florida, Cordoba Argentina, Trujillo Peru, Tijuana Mexico, Fort Collins Colorado, and Tucson Arizona temples. Uchtdorf has also participated in the dedication of many other temples as a member of the Twelve and the First Presidency.

In May 2016, Uchtdorf traveled to the Czech Republic to create the first stake in that nation.

At the time of Monson&#x27;s death on 2 January 2018, with the dissolution of the First Presidency, Uchtdorf returned to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, along with Monson&#x27;s First Counselor, Henry B. Eyring. When the First Presidency was subsequently reorganized under new church president Russell M. Nelson, Uchtdorf was not retained as a counselor in the First Presidency and continued his service in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. 

While not unprecedented in church history, the last time a new church president did not retain a counselor who served in the First Presidency under his predecessor was in 1985. Uchtdorf, who had taught as a member of the First Presidency that church members should neither seek or decline callings, that they should lift where they stand, and that at the end of each assignment, subsequent changes should be graciously accepted, posted his support for the new leaders, especially referencing his willingness to resume his ministry as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

===Quorum of the Twelve===
Following his return to the Quorum of the Twelve after the reorganization of the First Presidency, the church announced new assignments for Uchtdorf on January 22, 2018. These assignments had been noted by Nelson in the news conference where the new First Presidency was announced. The assignments include chairman of the church&#x27;s Missionary Executive Council, chairman of the Correlation Executive Council, and being the primary contact for the church&#x27;s Europe and Europe East areas.

==== Political donations ====
In March 2021, public records showed 23 different donations which were made under Uchtdorf&#x27;s name in 2020 and 2021. These donations were made to Joe Biden&#x27;s presidential campaign, Democratic candidates in the Georgia Senate race, and other Democratic political funds. If made solely by Uchtdorf, this would be contrary to the LDS Church&#x27;s political neutrality policies. Uchtdorf issued a statement noting the donations were made from a shared online family account and that having the contributions show in his name was an oversight.

==Family==
Uchtdorf and his wife, Harriet Reich Uchtdorf, were married on 14 December 1962 in the Swiss Temple. They are the parents of two children and have six grandchildren.

<text>The Spenserian sonnet is a sonnet form named for the poet Edmund Spenser.

A Spenserian sonnet consists of fourteen lines, which are broken into four stanzas: three interlocked quatrains and a final couplet, with the rhyme scheme ABAB BCBC CDCD EE. It uses iambic pentameter.

Three prominent features of this sonnet type were known already: Italian and French sonnets used five rhymes; sonnets of Thomas Wyatt and the Earl of Surrey used final couplets; and the interleaved ABAB rhymes were in the English style.

==History==
The Spenserian sonnet was invented by Edmund Spenser, the famous sixteenth-century poet. Spenser was born in London, England, in 1552 or 1553. Currently, his epic allegorical poem, &quot;The Faerie Queene(1590)&quot;, is his most well-known work. This intricate, captivating, and occasionally bizarre poem honors Elizabeth I in particular as well as the Tudor Dynasty in general. Twelve novels were intended, but Edward Spenser only published six of them while he was alive. The narrative centers on knights who stand in for several values. Spenser is seen as one of the greatest poets of all time, and this poem is regarded as one of the best written in the English language. 

Spenserian sonnets were created during the same time period as the Shakespearean sonnet, and so there are similarities in the features of both forms. The Spenserian sonnet was also influenced by the Petrarchan sonnet (named after the Italian poet Petrarch), which is seen in their shared use of the volta.

The Spenserian sonnet gained popularity in Scotland during the 16th and 17th centuries, with Scottish royalty including King James VI using this form. The Spenserian sonnet was so popular in Scotland that it is sometimes referred to as the Scottish sonnet. A well-known example includes Alexander Montgomery who published 38 Spenserian sonnets in 1821. 

Although Spenser is best-known for The Faerie Queene, he also wrote numerous sonnets such as one, &quot;Amoretti (1595)&quot;, pioneering a new form that is now synonymous with his name

<doc id="1035822" wikidata="Q568699" url="?curid=1035822" title="Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel">
<text>The Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel (also known as the Brown Scapular) belongs to the habit of both the Carmelite Order and the Discalced Carmelite Order, both of which have Our Lady of Mount Carmel as their patroness. In its small form, it is widely popular among Catholics. Today, it serves as the prototype of all devotional scapulars. The liturgical feast day of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, July 16, is popularly associated with the devotion of the Scapular.

According to the Vatican&#x27;s Congregation for Divine Worship, the Brown Scapular is &quot;an external sign of the filial relationship established between the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother and Queen of Mount Carmel, and the faithful who entrust themselves totally to her protection, who have recourse to her maternal intercession, who are mindful of the primacy of the spiritual life and the need for prayer.&quot;

==History==
In its origin as a practical garment, a scapular was a type of work apron, frequently used by monks, consisting of large pieces of cloth front and back joined over the shoulders with strips of cloth. It forms part of the habit of some religious orders including the Carmelites. The first Carmelite hermits who lived on Mount Carmel in the Holy Land in the 12th century are thought to have worn a belted tunic and striped mantle typical of pilgrims; when the Carmelites moved to Europe in the 13th century and became a mendicant order of friars they adopted a new habit that included a brown belted tunic, brown scapular, hood, and white mantle.

In the Middle Ages, a habit was an essential part of the identity of members of religious orders. To remove one&#x27;s habit was tantamount to leaving the monastic state. The Carmelite Constitution of 1369 stipulates automatic excommunication for Carmelites who say Mass without a scapular, while the Constitutions of 1324 and 1294 consider it a serious fault to sleep without the scapular.

It was customary for laypeople who belonged to confraternities, sodalities, or third orders affiliated with the religious orders to wear some sign of membership, frequently some part derived from the religious habit such as a cord, cloak or scapular. During part of their history, the lay affiliates of the Carmelites wore the white mantle which the friars wore, or even the full habit. The small brown scapular and Mary&#x27;s promise of salvation for the wearer, began to be promoted to the laity in the form we are familiar with today by Giovanni Battista Rossi, prior general of the Carmelites from 1564 to 1578.
The Carmelite scapular was widespread in European countries at the end of the 16th century. There are many books that include formulas of blessing for those who wear the scapular. The moment when they receive the scapular formally is significant, as is the hour of death.

===Historical difficulties===
According to traditional accounts, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared at Cambridge to Simon Stock, a man not otherwise documented in historical record, but often described as a Prior General of the Carmelite Order in the middle of the 13th century. The legend states that the Virgin appeared to Stock, holding the Scapular, and promised that all who wear it will be spared suffering in Purgatory.

The first mention of the vision appeared almost 150 years after the date in 1251 when it is said to have occurred and is not noted in the earliest accounts of Simon Stock&#x27;s life and miracles. The history of the Carmelite habit and legislation concerning it do not mention a tradition about the Blessed Virgin giving the Scapular to the Carmelites. Notable Carmelite writers of the 14th century do not mention the scapular. History even records an instance in 1375 when an English Carmelite named Nicholas Hornby engaged in a public debate with a Dominican friar in which Hornby ridiculed Dominican claims to have received their habit from the Blessed Virgin—this was a claim common to several different orders in the Middle Ages. Hornby showed no sign of being aware of any similar claim that had been made by a fellow English Carmelite in the preceding century.

==Appearance==
In current documents prepared by Carmelits superiors and given imprimatur by the Archbishop of Washington D.C., the scapular must consist of two pieces of brown cloth with one segment hanging on the wearer&#x27;s chest, and the other hanging on his/her back. These pieces are joined by two straps or strings which overlap each shoulder—hence the word &quot;scapular&quot; (shoulder blade). Religious pictures or symbols, though unnecessary, may be sewn on; this custom began in the eighteenth century. The catechesis also acknowledged that the Scapular was formerly required to be made from 100% wool (a rule since dropped); it further stated the habits of the Carmelite religious are also now typically made of other, less expensive yet more practical materials.

Because wool deteriorates rapidly in tropical climates, since 1910 those properly invested into a confraternity may wear properly blessed scapular medals with the depiction of Jesus with his Sacred Heart on one panel and Mary on the obverse. It is acceptable to wear a metal scapular medal, though one must be invested with the cloth scapular first.

==Enrollment==
Unlike typical sacramentals, scapulars are not merely blessed, but given to the wearer in a ritual led by a priest. Any Catholic priest may invest a baptised Catholic with the Brown Scapular. The most recent Rite for the Blessing of and Enrollment in the Scapular, approved in 1996 by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, is available in booklet form.

The short form of the investiture is as follows:
Receive this Scapular, a sign of your special relationship with Mary, the Mother of Jesus, whom you pledge to imitate. May it be a reminder to you of your dignity as a Christian, in serving others and imitating Mary.
Wear it as a sign of her protection and of belonging to the Family of Carmel, voluntarily doing the will of God and devoting yourself to building a world true to his plan of community, justice and peace.

According to a 1996 doctrinal statement approved by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, &quot;Devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel is bound to the history and spiritual values of the Order of the Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel and is expressed through the scapular. Thus, whoever receives the scapular becomes a member of the order and pledges him/herself to live according to its spirituality in accordance with the characteristics of his/her state in life.&quot;

==Third Order and Confraternity==
Like the other mendicant orders such as the Franciscans, the Carmelites formed a Third Order for lay people (the First Order being the friars, the Second Order the nuns), either married or single, who wished to participate deeply in the spirituality and charism of the order, but remain in their secular state of life. Those belonging to the Ancient Observance (O.Carm) branch of the Carmelites are today known as Lay Carmelites, those belonging to the Discalced (OCD) branch of the Carmelites are known as Secular Carmelites, members of both branches belong to communities which meet together regularly for prayer and spiritual formation. The small Brown Scapular is the habit of these Carmelite laity, with a larger ceremonial Scapular normally worn outside the clothes at community meetings and official functions.

There is also a Confraternity of the Brown Scapular. According to the 1996 version of the rite of enrollment, &quot;The scapular confraternity of Carmel is an association of the faithful who strive for the perfection of charity in the world in the spirit of the Carmelite Order, participate in the life of the Order and its spiritual benefits in an intimate communion of thought, ideals, and works together with Mary.&quot; Furthermore, the current rules (approved 1996) for starting a canonical local confraternity is given:

In Europe in the past there was often a local confraternity which met for fellowship and spiritual formation. Today, at least in North America, those enrolled by a priest into the Confraternity of the Brown Scapular typically have no visible group to belong to, nor are written records kept concerning membership. Some have called for a return to the practice of organized confraternities and renewed awareness of the scapular&#x27;s connection to Carmelite spirituality.

The current rite of enrollment in the Brown Scapular also permits for persons to be enrolled in the scapular without joining a group.

==Official teaching==
Carmelite scholar Kieran Kavanaugh summarized the Catholic Church&#x27;s official position on the Brown Scapular:

:With regard to the scapular as a conventional and sacred sign, the Church has intervened at various times in history to clarify its meaning, defend it, and confirm the privileges. From these Church documents there emerges with sufficient clarity the nature and meaning of the Carmelite scapular.

:1. The scapular is a Marian habit or garment. It is both a sign and pledge. A sign of belonging to Mary; a pledge of her motherly protection, not only in this life but after death.

:2. As a sign, it is a conventional sign signifying three elements strictly joined: first, belonging to a religious family particularly devoted to Mary, especially dear to Mary, the Carmelite Order; second, consecration to Mary, devotion to and trust in her Immaculate Heart; third an incitement to become like Mary by imitating her virtues, above all her humility, chastity, and spirit of prayer.

:This is the Church&#x27;s officially established connection between the sign and that which is signified by the sign.

:No mention is made of the vision of St. Simon Stock or of that of Pope John XXII in relation to the Sabbatine Privilege, which promises that one will be released from Purgatory on the first Saturday after death.

==Associated beliefs==
The earliest form of the Scapular promise states simply that wearers of the brown scapular, the Carmelite habit, will be saved. Originally, this referred to Carmelite religious who remained faithful to their vocation. Later the small Brown Scapular became popular with the laity as a sacramental.

The nature of the spiritual help associated with the Brown Scapular came to be described in greater detail and specificity. A traditional formulation of the Scapular Promise is &quot;Take this Scapular. Whosoever dies wearing it shall not suffer eternal fire. It shall be a sign of salvation, a protection in danger and pledge of peace.&quot;

Those wearing the Brown Scapular consider themselves consecrated to Mary. In 1951, Pope Pius XII wrote in an Apostolic letter to the Carmelites on the 700th anniversary of the vision of Simon Stock, that he hoped the Scapular would &quot;be to them a sign of their consecration to the most sacred heart of the Immaculate Virgin.&quot;

===Promises of the scapular===
One of the beliefs most influential in popularizing the brown scapular devotion was a purported promise known as the Sabbatine (Saturday) privilege. This name deduces from the apocryphical papal bull &quot;Sacratissimo uti culmine&quot;, attributed to Pope John XXII in 1322. It states that Pope John XXII had a vision of Mary personally delivering the souls of Carmelites and Confraternity members out of Purgatory on the first Saturday after their death, as long as they fulfill certain conditions. The Vatican has denied the validity of this document since 1613, but has not forbidden the Carmelites &quot;to preach that the Christian people may piously believe in the help which the souls of brothers and members, who have departed this life in charity, have worn in life the scapular, have ever observed chastity, have recited the Little Hours [of the Blessed Virgin], or, if they cannot read, have observed the fast days of the Church, and have abstained from flesh meat on Wednesdays and Saturdays [...], may derive after death — especially on Saturdays, the day consecrated by the Church to the Blessed Virgin [...].&quot; These elements are reflected in older versions of the requirements of enrollment in the Confraternity of the Brown Scapular.

At times the scapular has been criticized as an easy way to heaven, a manner of superstition. The Catechism of the Catholic Church, however, states that sacramentals such as the Brown Scapular &quot;do not confer the grace of the Holy Spirit in the way that the sacraments do, but by the Church&#x27;s prayer, they prepare us to receive grace and dispose us to cooperate with it.&quot;

Today, the Carmelite Orders, while encouraging Marian devotions, explicitly state in their official literature that they do not promulgate the Sabbatine privilege, and that they are at one with official church teaching on the matter.

<text>The NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital (abbreviated as NYP) is a nonprofit academic medical center in New York City. It is the primary teaching hospital for Weill Cornell Medicine and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. The hospital includes seven campuses located throughout the New York metropolitan area. The hospital&#x27;s two flagship medical centers, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and Weill Cornell Medical Center, are located on opposite sides of Upper Manhattan.

, the hospital is ranked the seventh-best hospital in the United States and second-best in the New York City metropolitan area by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. The hospital has more than 6,500 affiliated physicians, 20,000 employees and operates 4,000+ beds in total. It is one of the largest hospitals in the world. NYPH annually treats about 310,000 patients in its emergency department and delivers about 15,000 babies.

==History==

NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital was founded in 1771 as New York Hospital by Edinburgh Medical School graduate Samuel Bard. The hospital was granted a Royal Charter granted by King George III of Great Britain and became associated with Weill Cornell Medical College upon Weill Cornell&#x27;s founding in 1898. It is the third oldest hospital in the United States, after Bellevue Hospital in New York City (1736) and Pennsylvania Hospital (1751).

In 1927, the hospital had grown its endowment to more than $20 million, largely due to the leadership of Payne Whitney who expanded the hospital significantly; Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic is named in Whitney&#x27;s honor. Other prominent donors have included Howard Hughes, William Randolph Hearst, Harry and Leona Helmsley, Maurice R. Greenberg, and others. The Presbyterian Hospital was founded in 1868 by James Lenox, a New York philanthropist and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, also founded by Samuel Bard in 1767.

==20th century==
In 1910, Columbia University and Presbyterian Hospital reached an agreement to affiliate, forming the world&#x27;s first academic health center through the merger of existing institutions. During the 1920s, Edward S. Harkness and Anna Harkness purchased land and funded the construction of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. In 1928, the two institutions fully moved to the new medical center. In 1925, the Sloane Hospital for Women, a leader in obstetrics and gynecology that had been founded in 1886, was incorporated. In 1928, Sloan, along with The Squier Urological Clinic and the Vanderbilt Clinic, moved to Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center.

New York Hospital was the subject of a lawsuit from the family of Libby Zion, a young woman admitted in 1984 who died while under the care of overworked hospital residents. An investigation by the New York State Health Commissioner, the Bell Commission, led to restrictions on the number of hours residents could work and required oversight of their care by accredited physicians (this regulation is also known as the Libby Zion law). These reforms have since been adopted nationwide. NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, chartered as The New York and Presbyterian Hospital by the State of New York in 1996, was formed in 1998 with the merger of two large, previously independent hospitals, the New York Hospital and Presbyterian Hospital. The merger had been announced on January 1, 1998.

===21st century===
In the 2010s, the hospital began to supplement its physical presence with remote and online services. A telemedicine service allows patients to receive follow-up care remotely, a CAT-equipped ambulance (see below NYP-EMS) allows stroke care to take place outside the hospital, and a remote second opinion program uses Grand Rounds technology.

In 2022, the Bronxville hospital known as NewYork-Presbyterian Lawrence, after its founder William Van Duzer Lawrence, was renamed to NewYork-Presbyterian Westchester.

====COVID-19 pandemic====

During the initial phase COVID-19 pandemic, the hospital was at the center of the country&#x27;s response to the virus in the spring of 2020. The hospital was able to triple its ICU bed capacity and ventilator support. During the crisis, teams at the hospital pioneered techniques to assist two patients with one ventilator and shared this around the country. The hospital turned Baker Field and Columbia Soccer Stadium into a 288-bed field hospital in under two weeks.

As was the case at many hospitals in the U.S., clinicians volunteered to help understaffed units. Over 1,000 people volunteered at the hospital, including teams from University of Rochester Medical Center, UCSF Medical Center, Cayuga Medical Center, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, UAMS Medical Center, Intermountain Medical Center, and Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center. In November 2020, with cases surging in Utah, a team of 31 nurses and staff from the hospital traveled to offer support to Utah.

On October 13, 2020, with a gift from Ray Dalio, NYP launched the Dalio Center for Health Justice, a research and advocacy organization, which will focus on reducing differences in access to quality health care that overwhelmingly affect communities of color.

==Structure==

New York-Presbyterian Hospital is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit system that includes a variety of outlying hospitals that had been affiliates of the legacy Hospitals, NewYork, or Presbyterian. The hospitals stretch throughout the five boroughs of New York City, Long Island, Westchester County, and New Jersey.

Along with Weill Cornell Medicine and Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, the hospital manages NewYork-Presbyterian Healthcare System, a network of independent, cooperating, acute-care and community hospitals, continuum-of-care facilities, home-health agencies, ambulatory sites, and specialty institutes in the New York metropolitan area. The two medical schools remain essentially autonomous, though there is increasing cooperation and coordination of clinical, research, and residency training programs. The hospitals merged administrations. Herb Pardes, MD led the combined hospitals from 2000 until 2011. The hospital system&#x27;s chief executive officer as of 2024 is Steven Corwin, MD.

The institution&#x27;s eleven facilities are:
* NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center
* NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center
* NewYork-Presbyterian Komansky Children&#x27;s Hospital
* NewYork-Presbyterian Allen Hospital
* NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children&#x27;s Hospital
* NewYork-Presbyterian Westchester Behavioral Health Center, formerly the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic, and before that Bloomingdale Insane Asylum
* NewYork-Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital
* NewYork-Presbyterian Westchester
* NewYork-Presbyterian Hudson Valley Hospital
* NewYork-Presbyterian Queens
* NewYork-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital

==Awards and recognition==

In 2022, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital the seventh-best hospital in the United States. Every specialty was ranked in the top 50 by &quot;US News&quot;, and the following were ranked in the top 10 of hospitals around the country: cardiology and heart surgery (No. 4), pediatric cardiology and heart surgery (No. 5), diabetes / endocrinology (No. 4), geriatrics (No. 6), neurology / neurosurgery (No. 3), orthopedics (No. 10), psychiatry (No. 4), urology (No. 5), and rheumatology (No. 3), a collaborative program with the Hospital for Special Surgery.

==Emergency medical services==

NewYork-Presbyterian Emergency Medical Services (NYP-EMS) is a hospital-based ambulance service that has operated since 1981. NYP-EMS also operates critical care transport ambulances throughout the New York City Metropolitan Area. The service is licensed to operate in the 5 boroughs of New York City, Westchester, Putnam, and Dutchess counties in New York, and in the state of New Jersey for Basic Life Support and Specialty Care Transport.
NYP-EMS provides emergency and non-emergency ambulance services, through the New York City 911 system and through the NYP-EMS Communications Center at Weill Cornell Medical Center. It also provides stand-by EMS services for events throughout the New York City area, including the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer and the NYC Triathlon.

NYP-EMS is also a New York State Department of Health-approved training center for EMT and Paramedic programs, several of which are approved for college-level credit by the New York State Department of Education. NYP-EMS operates one of the largest American Heart Association Emergency Cardiac Care training centers in New York.

NYP-EMS also maintains a Special Operations team trained in hazardous materials decontamination and technical rescue. This team, accompanied by several Weill Cornell Physicians, provided rescue and relief support on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Most recently, the team decontaminated 28 patients after the 2007 New York City steam explosion in Midtown Manhattan on July 18, 2007.

In 2016, the hospital acquired and fielded the first mobile stroke unit on the U.S. East Coast. As of 2018, it is the only hospital in the nation to field three such units. The hospital operates three mobile stroke units with one each based in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens.

Four of the hospital&#x27;s complexes in the five boroughs of New York City are rated as level I or II trauma centers by the state of New York.

<text>Weill Cornell Medical Center (; previously known as New York Hospital, Old New York Hospital, and City Hospital) is a research hospital in New York City. It is the teaching hospital for Cornell University&#x27;s medical school and is part of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. 

The hospital was founded in 1771 with a charter from George III. It is the second-oldest hospital in New York City and third-oldest hospital in the United States. Since 1912, it has been the main teaching hospital for Weill Cornell Medicine, the biomedical research unit and medical school of Cornell University. 

Weill Cornell is located on East 68th Street and York Avenue on the Upper East Side of New York City. Prior to moving there in 1932, it was located on Broadway between Duane Street and Anthony Street on present-day Worth Street. In 1998, New York Hospital merged with Presbyterian Hospital to form NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital.

==History==
===18th century===
The hospital&#x27;s origin can be traced to a 1769 commencement address by Samuel Bard, a graduate of the University of Edinburgh Medical School and professor of medicine, which was delivered to the first two medical doctors to graduate from King&#x27;s College, now Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, titled “A discourse upon the duties of a physician, with some sentiments on the usefulness and necessity of a public hospital.” New York City leaders later pledged one thousand pounds sterling to the hospital&#x27;s creation.

Later the same year, on November 3, 1769, Peter Middleton reported on progress with the hospital&#x27;s creation in another address to King&#x27;s College, stating “the necessity and usefulness of a public infirmary has so warmly and pathetically set forth in a discourse delivered by Dr. Samuel Bard... that his Excellency, Sir Henry Moore immediately set on foot a subscription for that purpose to which himself and most of the gentlemen present liberally contributed.” Soon thereafter, the new Governor of the Colony, John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore through the interposition of Lieutenant Governor Cadwallader Colden started a fund for the establishment of such a hospital.

On June 13, 1771, King George III of Great Britain granted a royal charter to establish &quot;The Society of the New York Hospital in the City of New York in America&quot; and a Board of Governors for the &quot;reception of such patients as require medical treatment, chirurgical management and maniacs.&quot; The first regular meeting of the Governors after its organization was held on July 24, 1771, at Fraunces Tavern, the same location where General Washington would bid farewell to his officers on December 4, 1783.

Attending the first meeting were then hospital president John Watts, Philip Livingston, and Gerardus William Beekman. The Governors purchased in 1771, on elevated ground surrounded at the time on three sides by marshes. The location was several miles from the central part of New York; apparently the expansion of the city and the drainage of the marshes, which harbored malaria, was anticipated.

A building&#x27;s construction began in 1773 but was destroyed by fire before its completion. The American Revolutionary War delayed the building&#x27;s reconstruction but a partial structure on Broadway and Duane Street served as a barracks for Hessian and British Army soldiers, as a laboratory for teaching anatomy to medical students, and as a military hospital. 

Although initially ignored by the wider community, grave-robbing incidents in the 1780s were met with public outrage after medical students – who were taking the corpses in order to dissect them for anatomical study – turned from stealing from the &quot;Negroes Burying Ground&quot; to the more closely-located, and white, Trinity Churchyard. This provoked a raid on the university, an attack on the student perpetrators, and the &quot;doctors&#x27; riot&quot; of 1788.

The hospital opened on January 3, 1791. Initially it was a small, two-story H-shaped building located along the west side of Broadway between present day Worth and Duane streets, set back from the street frontage about 90 feet to allow for landscaping and expansion. The hospital&#x27;s first patients were suffering from smallpox, syphilis, and acute bipolar disorder. In 1798, the hospital&#x27;s governors announced the hospital&#x27;s priorities as medical treatment, surgical treatment, psychiatric treatment of the medically ill (then called &quot;maniacs&quot;), and post-partum treatment of women.

===19th century===
After some years of experience in treating the mentally ill, the hospital&#x27;s board of governors decided to construct an additional building designed to specialize in treatment of the mentally ill. After receiving financial assistance from the New York state legislator, the governors erected &quot;a substantial and spacious stone edifice on the grounds of the hospital in the city, within the same enclosure, and but a few rods distant from the original building. It was finished and opened on July 15, 1808. On the same day, 19 patients were moved to it from wards in other buildings and 48 total patients were admitted. The new department was called the Lunatic Asylum.

In June 1821, the hospital opened the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum on Broadway and West 116th Street in Morningside Heights. Due to real estate pressures, the hospital moved to White Plains, New York in 1891, where it eventually became the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic, now known as &quot;New York-Presbyterian/Westchester&quot;. The Morningside Heights site became part of Columbia University.

New York Hospital outgrew its original building by the 1870s and moved to a new building between Fifth and Sixth Avenues and West 15th and 16th Streets, which opened in 1877. The original facility was maintained as a &#x27;house of relief&#x27;, which moved to Hudson Street in 1884.

===20th century===

In 1912, New York Hospital became affiliated with the Cornell University Medical College. 

In 1932, the hospital moved to a new location as a joint facility, the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, now Weill Cornell Medical Center, on York Avenue between East 67th and 68th Streets.

In 1998, New York Hospital merged administratively with Presbyterian Hospital to become NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital (NYP). Despite the clinical alliance, the faculty and instructional functions of the Cornell and Columbia medical school units remain largely distinct and independent. Each hospital in the NewYork–Presbyterian Healthcare System is affiliated with one of the two colleges.

The York Avenue site functions as one of the six NYP campuses.

==Komansky Children&#x27;s Hospital==
In 2005, Komansky Children&#x27;s Hospital was established at Weill Cornell Medical Center through philanthropic giving from American finance executive David Komansky for whom the hospital is named.

Komansky Children&#x27;s Hospital is a pediatric acute care hospital located within Weill Cornell Medical Center. The hospital has 103 beds and is affiliated with Weill Cornell Medicine and is a member of New York-Presbyterian Hospital. The hospital provides comprehensive pediatric specialties and subspecialties to pediatric patients aged 0–21 throughout New York City. 

The hospital is certified as a Level II Trauma Center and houses the only pediatric burn unit in the New York City Metropolitan Area. Komansky Children&#x27;s Hospital is a full-service pediatric hospital within a hospital and has been routinely listed by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;&#x27;s as one of the nation&#x27;s best children&#x27;s hospitals. It is one of only ten children&#x27;s hospitals in the nation to be ranked by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in all ten clinical specialties.

<text>Bethlehem Steel Football Club (1907–1930) was one of the most successful early American soccer clubs. Known as the Bethlehem Football Club from 1907 until 1915 when it became the Bethlehem Steel Football Club, the team was sponsored by the Bethlehem Steel corporation. Bethlehem Steel FC played their home games first at East End Field in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley, then later on the grounds Bethlehem Steel built on Elizabeth Ave named Bethlehem Steel Athletic Field.

==History==

The first soccer team in Bethlehem was founded in 1904, according to a June 2, 1925, article in &quot;The Bethlehem Globe&quot;. The sport took hold of the town and local steel workers formed a recreational team. 

On November 17, 1907, the Bethlehem Football Club played its first official match, an 11–2 loss to West Hudson A.A., at the time one of the top professional teams in the country. 

In 1913, the steel company created Bethlehem Steel Athletic Field, the country&#x27;s first soccer field with stadium-seating. In 1914 Charles Schwab, owner of the Steel Company, took the team professional, using his wealth to induce several top players to move to Bethlehem Steel and changing the team name to the Bethlehem Steel Football Club. Schwab would eventually begin importing players from Scotland and England. From 1911 to 1915, the club was a member of the amateur Allied American Foot Ball Association before moving to the American Soccer League of Philadelphia, another amateur league, for the 1915–1916 season.

Bethlehem Steel FC was not associated with a league from 1916 to 1917, playing only exhibition or cup games. In 1917, it joined the professional National Association Foot Ball League. In 1921, several teams from the NAFBL and other regional leagues joined together to form the American Soccer League. Although one of the strongest teams of the time, the owners decided to disband the club, moving the players and management to Philadelphia where it competed as the Philadelphia Field Club. Legendary Scottish football player Alex Jackson, played for Bethlehem Steel. Although Philadelphia won the first ASL championship, the team was in financial trouble and lacked fan support. The ownership moved it back to Bethlehem the following year, and the team restored their initial name.

In 1925, the ASL, including Bethlehem Steel F.C., boycotted the National Challenge Cup. The boycott created some animosity with the United States Football Association. Three years later, in 1928, the ASL again boycotted the Challenge Cup. When Bethlehem Steel chose to ignore the boycott this time, the league expelled them. 

In 1925 - 1926 Bethlehem Steel F.C. was awarded the United States Football Association Medal. Patrick McColgan, from, Old Kilpatrick, Scotland had travelled to Philadelphia to help establish the team. His name is on the medal. 

Under the leadership of the USFA, Bethlehem Steel and two other expelled teams joined with teams from the Southern New York State Soccer Association to create the Eastern Soccer League. These actions, part of the 1928–1929 &quot;Soccer Wars&quot;, along with the Great Depression, financially devastated the ASL, ESL and Bethlehem Steel FC. While Bethlehem Steel FC rejoined the ASL in 1929, the team folded after the spring 1930 season.

<doc id="1035861" wikidata="Q356149" url="?curid=1035861" title="Sherira ben Hanina">
<text>Sherira bar Hanina (), more commonly known as Sherira Gaon (; c. 906 – c. 1006) was the gaon of the Pumbedita Academy in Lower Mesopotamia. He was one of the most prominent geonim of the period. His son Hai succeeded him as gaon. He wrote the &quot;Iggeret of Rabbi Sherira Gaon&quot;, a comprehensive history of the composition of the Talmud.

==Life==
Sherira was born circa 906, a descendant, both on his father&#x27;s and his mother&#x27;s side of prominent families, several of whom had occupied the gaonate. His father was Hananiah bar Yehudai, also a gaon. Sherira claimed descent from the amora Rabbah bar Abuha, who belonged to the family of the Exilarch, thereby claiming descent from the Davidic line. Sherira stated that his genealogy could be traced back to the pre-Bostanaian branch of that family, which, he claimed, on account of the deterioration of the exilarchate had renounced its claims thereto, preferring the scholar&#x27;s life instead. His family&#x27;s seal was a lion, which was said to have been the emblem of the Judean kings.

Sherira officiated first as chief judge. While in that office, he refused to recognize the election of Nehemiah ben Kohen Tzedek as gaon in 960. On Nehemiah&#x27;s death in 968, Sherira was elected gaon of Pumbedita. Soon after, he appointed his son, Hai, chief judge in his stead.

In 997, he and his son were maliciously denounced by enemies to the Abbasid caliph al-Qadir, though the nature of the accusation is unknown. He and his son were imprisoned and deprived of their property, even of the necessities of life. Though the incarceration was brief, Sherira was now in terrible health. Sherira resigned the gaonate in 998 C.E., appointing his son as his successor. Sherira died soon after, circa 1006 C.E. He was the alleged father in law of Elijah ben Menahem HaZaken.

==His responsa==
As academy director, he sought to reach pupils both near and far, and many of his responsa have been preserved in the geonic collections and the works containing the earlier decisions. His responsa are similar to the geonic responsa in general, a majority of them dealing with questions of religious practice. However, some contain expositions and comments on passages of the Talmud and the Mishnah.

Indeed, his literary activity was confined to Talmudic and related subjects. He was not greatly interested in Arabic literature. However, he knew enough Arabic to write decisions addressed to communities in Muslim countries. Generally, he preferred to use Hebrew or Aramaic for that purpose.

Sherira was noted for the nobility and seriousness of his character. As a judge he endeavoured to arrive at the exact facts of a case and to render his decisions in strict conformity with the Law. In deciding on practical questions, he adopted the more rigorous view, following the letter of the Talmud to uphold and emphasize its authority against the attacks of the Karaites. He frequently formulates in his responsa rules which are highly important for correctly interpreting the Talmud. For instance, he declares that the term &quot;mitzvah&quot; designates in some passages a command that may not be broken with impunity, but in other passages denotes merely an admonition with which it would be commendable to comply but which may be disregarded without fear of punishment. He was also a part of the Rabbinic constitution of EIBLC

Some think Sherira was a student of Kabbalah. However, when asked about the mystical works &quot;Shi&#x27;ur Qomah&quot; and the Hekhalot literature and whether they represented ancient traditions (originating with Rabbi Ishmael and Rabbi Akiva), he replied in a responsum that the passage in the &quot;Shi&#x27;ur Qomah&quot; ascribing human organs to God embodies profound mysteries, but must not be taken literally. Sherira wrote a work on the Talmud titled &quot;Megillat Setarim&quot;. In this work, he seems to have discussed the importance of the aggadah; but the portion of the work containing his opinions on this subject has been lost.

==His circular letter==

Sherira&#x27;s seminal work for which he is most renowned is his Epistle, or &quot;Iggeret&quot;, written to Rabbi Jacob ben Nissim of Kairouan, and where he addressed the question of how the Talmud was formulated, and brings down a chronological list of the &quot;geonim&quot; who officiated in Babylonia during the period of the Exilarchs (&quot;Resh Galutha&quot;). This &quot;Iggeret&quot; is considered by many to be one of the classics in Jewish historiography.

Born in Dublin in 1974, one of four children, Pilkington grew up in the affluent suburban village of Malahide, and attended Manor House School, Raheny until the age of 14. She trained at the Gaiety School of Acting.

==Career==
Pilkington began her acting career at the age of 15 when she appeared in &quot;The Miracle&quot; directed by Neil Jordan. She appeared onstage in the plays &quot;The Plough and the Stars&quot; and &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot;. At age 18 she moved to London where she was given a part in a Miramax film which eventually fell through after a meeting with Harvey Weinstein. She later returned to Dublin, living in Ballsbridge for a time.

After a period involving substantial voiceover work, she moved back to London in the late 1990s, with the self-described aim of relaunching her career. Pilkington subsequently appeared in films including &quot;Human Traffic&quot; and &quot;My Kingdom&quot;, a retelling of &quot;King Lear&quot;. In 1999, she was cast as Katrina Finlay, a schoolteacher in a Scottish village, a major role in the BBC television series &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot;, which was broadcast from 2000. After leaving the show at the beginning of the third season, she appeared in various other television productions such as &quot;Rough Diamond&quot; and &quot;Outnumbered&quot;. 

In 2008, she appeared in a short film by Luke Massey &quot;Within the Woods&quot;, with James Chalmers. In 2016 she voiced the lead role in a Paramount animated film &quot;Capture the Flag&quot;.

<doc id="1035875" wikidata="Q3720673" url="?curid=1035875" title="Princess Eilonwy">
<text>Princess Eilonwy ( ) is a fictional character in Lloyd Alexander&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot;. She appears in four of the five novels in the series, as well as Disney&#x27;s 1985 animated film adaptation &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;. Eilonwy is a member of the Royal House of Llyr, and the women in her line are formidable enchantresses, including her mother, Angharad, and grandmother Regat. She has inherited this characteristic, most readily visible in her manipulation of a magical item she calls her &quot;bauble&quot;, a small golden sphere that glows with magical light when activated by her willpower. Eilonwy&#x27;s father, Geraint, was a commoner with whom her mother fell in love.

==Name origin==
Eilonwy is not a historical Welsh name (unlike many others used in the stories), but it turns up in a tale by Glasynys—published in &quot;Cymru Fu&quot;, or &quot;The Wales that Was&quot; (1862–4), and translated from the Welsh by Sir John Rhys in his &quot;Celtic Folklore&quot; (1901)—belonging to the daughter of a mermaid named Nefyn ferch Nefydd and her human lover Ifan Morgan. A poem by Talhaiarn also bears the name &quot;Eilonwy&quot;. It may be based on the literary Welsh (&quot;i.e.&quot; obsolete) word &quot;eilon&quot;, meaning &quot;deer, stag&quot;, with the fanciful suffix &quot;-wy&quot; (used in the 1800s to adorn river names) added for euphony (or perhaps in reference to the river Elan in central Wales).

==Description==
Eilonwy is described having long red-gold hair, bright blue eyes, and a melodic, youthful voice. As a member of the Royal House of Llyr, she wears a pendant depicting a silver crescent moon, the family emblem. Far from being just another stereotypical damsel-in-distress princess who needs the hero to save her, Eilonwy is hot-tempered, stubborn, and resolute. Although having been trained as a sorceress and not a warrior, she is quite capable of using various kinds of weapons, particularly the sword, bow, and spear. Even when unarmed, she will fight until incapacitated.

Eilonwy commonly uses unusual similes and metaphors, such as &quot;If you don&#x27;t listen to what somebody tells you, it&#x27;s like putting your fingers in your ears and jumping down a well.&quot; She is also sharp, snippy, strong-willed, and sarcastic, but at the same time talkative and often scatterbrained. Eilonwy frequently gets angry with Taran, usually for reasons he does not understand, though in secret she does care for him. While she is more sure about her growing feelings towards him than he is about his for her, she is content to wait until he confesses to her, which he does in the end.

In the first book of the series, she is described as wearing a white robe and a silver crescent-shaped necklace, which is her family symbol. She seemingly prefers going barefoot over wearing shoes (as noted by Dallben in &quot;The Castle of Llyr&quot;); when she has to wear shoes (like in &quot;The Book of Three&quot;), they are invariably sandals. Princess Diahan from Lloyd&#x27;s earlier novel &quot;Time Cat: The Remarkable Journeys of Jason and Gareth&quot;, who served as a prototype for Eilonwy, was likewise described as wearing a white robe and sandals.

Eilonwy is voiced by Susan Sheridan in the 1985 Disney animated film &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;, which is loosely based on &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot;. She is portrayed with long blonde hair and light blue eyes. Disney&#x27;s version of the character also appears in the film&#x27;s video game, as well in the video game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot; as a playable character.

==&quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot;==

===&quot;The Book of Three&quot;===
Eilonwy is introduced in &quot;The Book of Three&quot;. The companions are captured and taken to Spiral Castle, the stronghold of Achren, the former queen of all Prydain and mentor to Arawn, who later overthrew Achren and sent her into exile. At first, Eilonwy seems to be only a rather talkative, easily distracted girl, but she rescues Taran and Fflewddur Fflam (the latter by mistake, since Taran thought the only other person in the dungeons would be Gwydion, his companion, and asked Eilonwy to rescue the other person she described to him). She is described as being perhaps one or two years younger than Taran, the protagonist of the series, but Taran&#x27;s own age is never given so we have no definite idea of how old either of the characters are.

On their way out of the castle, they pass through a maze of underground passages and eventually reach a tomb where Eilonwy retrieves a sword. This sword is Dyrnwyn, a magical sword with a blade that bursts into flame when it is drawn. However, Eilonwy will not allow Taran to examine the sword or draw it from its rune-inscribed scabbard; despite her incomplete magical training, she is knowledgeable enough to recognize that the sword is highly magical and best left to experts.

Following the destruction of Spiral Castle, Eilonwy joins Taran, Fflewddur, and Gurgi on their journey to warn the Sons of Don of an advancing attack (though Taran asked Fflewddur to take her back to her own kinsmen, she refused to the point of threatening to break Fflewddur&#x27;s harp over his head if he tried). She attempts to halt several Cauldron Born at one point with an enchanted arrow, but it does not work as she intended. When they are captured by the Fair Folk, she convinces the king to give them Hen Wen, provisions, and a guide to Caer Dathyl. Eilonwy also agrees with Taran&#x27;s decision to rescue an injured young gwythaint. When the group must pass through a valley with the Horned King&#x27;s war band, Eilonwy rides with Taran and leaps at the Horned King to try to protect him. When Taran wakes up in Caer Dathyl, she tells him what happened and helps him recover.

Throughout the book, Taran presumes Eilonwy to be—apart from her enchanted heritage—an ordinary girl, and she makes no effort to contradict the presumption. At the end of the story, it is revealed to him that she is a princess, and she is invited to make her home in Caer Dallben.

===Post-&quot;Book of Three&quot;===
After the events in &quot;The Book of Three&quot;, Eilonwy comes to live at Caer Dallben, home of Dallben the enchanter and Taran. She accompanies Taran on many of his later adventures, and her courage and determination never falter. We later discover that she is the last living descendant of Llyr Half-Speech, the Sea King, which is why Achren abducted the girl as a small child. She is the only one capable of reading a tome that requires the light of her bauble, which only Eilonwy can cause to light. Because her magical tutoring under Queen Achren was incomplete, her ability to perform magic is severely hindered, though she retains and displays certain inborn abilities throughout the series.

Physically, Eilonwy is described as blue-eyed, with red-gold hair (though the film &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; depicts her as a blonde). She has a good heart, but is very determined to have her own way and quarrels frequently with Taran, although the quarrels do not last long. She is never without her &quot;bauble&quot;—a magical ball that she can make give off light, which sometimes shows things not visible under ordinary lights.

&quot;The Castle of Llyr&quot;, the third novel in the series, reveals that this is really the Golden Pelydryn, a magical artifact passed through Eilonwy&#x27;s family from mother to daughter. The events of that book bring Eilonwy back to her ancestral home, Caer Colur, and give her a greater sense of her ancestry. The Disney film depicts the bauble as a semi-sentient object that floats through the air under its own power, but in the books, it is described more like an orb of gold that must be carried.

===Further novels===
The fourth book in the series, &quot;Taran Wanderer&quot;, sheds light on the ultimate fate of Eilonwy&#x27;s mother, Princess Angharad. Eilonwy herself never appears in this book, though she is referenced at various times. Taran makes this discovery while Eilonwy is being fostered at the foreign court of King Rhuddlum and Queen Teleria, learning to be &quot;a proper princess&quot;. Whether he ever shared the information with Eilonwy is uncertain, though it seems likely that he refrained from doing so in an effort to spare her anguish. By this time Taran realizes that he&#x27;s fallen in love with Eilonwy, but he is reluctant to act on it because, having been raised as a commoner while Eilonwy is a royal princess, Taran feels that he really does not belong in &quot;her&quot; world. On the other hand, Eilonwy herself seems to have grown rather fond of Taran by this point, even if she will not admit it.

Taran and Eilonwy&#x27;s feelings for one another are much more evident throughout the 5th and final book of the Prydain Chronicles, &quot;The High King&quot;. Although these feelings are never spoken of directly until the last few pages of the novel, Taran and Eilonwy&#x27;s interactions with one another are noticeably different than in the previous books. Taran internally pines for Eilonwy, and fears for her safety in the midst of the escalating war. Eilonwy&#x27;s change towards Taran is far more subtle, yet no less certain, and is experienced perhaps more gradually over the course of the entire series in contrast with Taran&#x27;s very abrupt realization of his feelings towards the Princess in the first chapter of book three, &quot;The Castle of Llyr&quot;. At the end of &quot;The High King&quot;, Taran becomes High King of Prydain and marries Eilonwy. She must renounce her magical powers to be allowed to stay in Prydain, since all magical folk are leaving for the Summer Country. The series comes to its conclusion as the coronation and marriage of King Taran and Queen Eilonwy are announced to the people.

A sixth book was published in the series, &quot;The Foundling and Other Tales of Prydain&quot;. Among the stories included therein, readers learn about the circumstances that resulted in Princess Angharad running away from home to marry the commoner Geraint. Although Eilonwy inherited her mother&#x27;s red-gold hair and magical heritage, her intense blue eyes came from her father.

<text>Club Atlético Morelia is a Mexican professional football club based in Morelia, Michoacán, that competes in Liga de Expansión MX, the second level division of Mexican football. The club plays their home matches at the Estadio Morelos.
Founded in 1950 as Club Deportivo Morelia, it was one of the founding members of the Segunda División. It changed to its current name in 1974, and then changed its name to Club Monarcas Morelia in 1999. The club was refounded on June 26, 2020, under the same name that the club used from 1974 to 1999.

From 1981 to 2020, the club played in Mexico top-flight football league, winning the Invierno 2000 championship. On June 2, 2020, Monarcas Morelia was relocated to Mazatlán, Sinaloa, and rebranded as Mazatlán F.C.. A few weeks later, on June 26, Atlético Zacatepec was relocated to Morelia, Michoacán, and rebranded as Atlético Morelia at the Liga de Expansión MX. On June 11, 2024, Atlético Morelia announced the acquisition of Monarcas Morelia brand, badge and history, thus becoming the lineal club founded in 1950. 

Morelia has won the Liga de Expansión championship, in the Clasura 2022 season. It was the clubs second title, in a second division league.

==History==

=== Beginnings ===
In 1950 &quot;Oro Morelia&quot; changed the name to Club Deportivo Morelia. Morelia was among the teams that founded the Segunda División. After the 1956–1957 season, in which they ended up in second place, they were officially promoted into the Primera División to replace Puebla. After an unsuccessful season, in 1968 Atlético Morelia was relegated back to the Segunda División. During mixed 1968–1971 seasons, C.A. Morelia appointed Nicandro Ortiz as chairman. Ortiz acquired the team and strengthened its position in the league.

The July 1974 changes name in Club Atlético Morelia

The 1978–1979 season thrust Morelia into contention for promotion; Ortiz acquired the team and strengthened its position in the league, Nicandro Ortiz as chairman in 1980, Atlético Morelia played under manager Diego Malta who helped his team towards the Mexico Championship and finally promotion to the Primera División in 1981.

In 1986 before the World Cup in Mexico Atletico Morelia played friendlies against Germany Losing 2-1 and against the URSS again losing 4-1.

In 1996 the major broadcast company TV Azteca bought the team.
In 1999 the club started playing under the name Club Monarcas Morelia.

Although the team had played Mexican professional football for 70 years, it had never won a first division tournament until winter 2000, when the club raised the cup after beating Toluca on penalties. The team was crowned champions away in the Bombonera Stadium. On the day after the victory, a crowd that some estimate at 100 thousand people welcomed the team as it paraded along Morelia&#x27;s main avenue, Avenida Madero on their way to the stadium where the crowd congregated as the team raised the cup and the fans congratulated the team for its first ever first division trophy.

After missing the playoffs for three consecutive tournaments, Morelia finished in third place in the general table in the Apertura 2009. Morelia defeated Santos Laguna in the first round, 4–2 on aggregate. Morelia was then defeated by Cruz Azul in a semi-final that was filled with controversy due to Cruz Azul player Joel Huiqui intentionally using his hand to hit the ball away and prevent Morelia midfielder Wilson Tíago from scoring. (Huiqui later played for Morelia.) With a 2–1 aggregate score, Morelia was eliminated. Morelia qualified for the 2010 Copa Libertadores by ending in third place in the classification phase. It was the second time that Morelia participated in the Copa Libertadores, the first being in 2002. Morelia was the Runner-up of the Clausura 2011, after a hard-fought final against Pumas. Pumas won the tie 3–2 on aggregate, taking the trophy home.

In 2010, Morelia became the SuperLiga champion, with a 2–1 victory in the finals over the New England Revolution in which Miguel Sabah scored both Morelia goals.

On November 5, 2013 Monarcas Morelia won their first Copa MX title in a 3–3 match that went to penalties, where they would take the victory. This title also allowed them to participate in the inaugural edition Supercopa MX, which they won against Tigres UANL with a global score of 5–4.

=== Relegation struggles ===
After 15 years, a dismal 2014–15 campaign left Monarcas as one of the last teams in the relegation table, an aggregate of a club&#x27;s most recent points totals that decides which teams will be relegated. As a result, Enrique Meza was chosen to be the coach for the Apertura 2015 season. Meza had already saved Morelia before, in the 1995–96 season. After no notable improvement in team performance, Meza was let go from the position of head coach in 2016, with Roberto Hernandez taking over as interim manager. Hernandez&#x27;s tenure would coincide with the signing of Peruvian forward Raul Ruidiaz on loan from Universitario. The signing of Ruidiaz would prove to be crucial to the club&#x27;s fortunes, as he would go on to score 20 goals throughout the 2016-2017 Liga MX season, finishing as top scorer with 11 goals in the Apertura and 9 goals in the Clausura. In the following season, Morelia was in danger of being relegated on the final match day of the Apertura, residing in last place in the relegation table and needing a victory over Monterrey to avoid the drop. Tied 1-1 in injury time, Raul Rudiaz scored a crucial winner that moved them out of the relegation zone, with Jaguares de Chiapas being relegated in their stead. Ruidiaz&#x27;s goal additionally qualified them for that season&#x27;s liguilla, its first since the 2016 Clausura.

=== Relocation ===
On May 23, 2020, various news outlets in Mexico reported the club would be relocating from Morelia to Mazatlán, Sinaloa and would be called Mazatlán F.C. The club&#x27;s owner, Grupo Salinas, reportedly were asking for $400 million MXN per year from the Government of Michoacán to keep the team in the city. The move was very unpopular among supporters, former players, and the sports media across Mexico. Despite stay-at-home orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic, over 7,000 fans took to the streets of Morelia to protest the team&#x27;s move.

On June 2, 2020, the club and Liga MX announced the club&#x27;s relocation to Mazatlán, just two days before the club&#x27;s 70th anniversary.

===Rebirth of Atlético Morelia===
On June 26, 2020, Liga MX President Enrique Bonilla announced Atlético Zacatepec would be relocating to Morelia due to financial problems. The next day in a press conference at Estadio Morelos, it was announced the club would be called Club Atlético Morelia, the club&#x27;s name for over 25 years before Grupo Salinas changed it in 1999. It was announced the ownership group would consist of former Guadalajara President José Luis Higuera as well as various businessmen from the state of Michoacán. The ownership group acquired the rights to the club&#x27;s name and logo, both which were owned by Grupo Salinas.

The club&#x27;s colors are generated from the city&#x27;s flag which are yellow and red, which are the same colors in the Spanish flag, because the city is a novohispana city.

In the club&#x27;s beginnings the club went under the name of Oro and were known as the &quot;canarios&quot; (canary) until 1999 when the club changed its name to Monarcas, due to the 3 monarchs found in the city&#x27;s flag, which has been used from its foundation.

==Stadium==

Towards the end of the 1980s it was decided that their stadium (Estadio Venustiano Carranza) was lacking capacity and that a new stadium with a greater number of seats needed to be constructed. On April 9, 1989, after several construction delays, Stadium Jose Maria Morelos and Pavón (located on the outskirts of the Quinceo mountain) was opened, and the inaugural game was between Atlético Morelia and Club América. The stadium has an official capacity of 45,000, although on inauguration in 1989 it is estimated that more than 50,000 were in attendance. Morelia won the match with the score 2–1. In 2011, the stadium was given a new look, seeing as the FIFA U-17 World Cup was taking place in Mexico.

<doc id="1035878" wikidata="Q7676572" url="?curid=1035878" title="Taiwan Security Enhancement Act">
<text>The Taiwan Security Enhancement Act () was a U.S. Congressional bill which never became law. It was passed by one of the Houses of the U.S. Congress, the House of Representatives, on February 1, 2000, by a vote of 341 to 70. It envisaged greater United States military support of the Republic of China/Taiwan, including training and equipment. It also contemplated establishing direct military communication lines between the United States and Taiwan. It was never approved by the U.S. Senate or signed into law by the U.S. president.

Its proponents intended the proposed law to strengthen and update the Taiwan Relations Act, which was passed soon after the U.S. ceased official relations with the Republic of China (now commonly known as Taiwan) on December 31, 1978, and instead recognized the People&#x27;s Republic of China on January 1, 1979. President Jimmy Carter had unilaterally withdrawn from the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty establishing a defense pact between the United States and the Republic of China in January 1979, and the Taiwan Relations Act was Congress&#x27;s response to enforce and prevent excessive unilateral foreign policy change at the hands of the President without consent of Congress.

==U.S. President opposed proposed law==
The U.S. president at the time, Bill Clinton, opposed the proposed legislation. However, most Democrats in Congress supported the legislation despite President Clinton&#x27;s opposition.

==Beijing response==
From the Chinese perspective, the bill was incompatible with the policies of the previous six United States administrations, particularly Ronald Reagan&#x27;s 1982 Joint Communique. The Chinese Government&#x27;s spokesperson, responding to press inquiries, gave the Beijing Government&#x27;s response as follows:

<doc id="1035880" wikidata="Q1147054" url="?curid=1035880" title="Tokyo Metro Tozai Line">
<text>The is a rapid transit line in Tokyo and Chiba Prefecture, Japan, owned and operated by Tokyo Metro. Its name translates to &quot;East-West Line&quot;. The line runs between Nakano in Nakano-ku, Tokyo and Nishi-Funabashi in Funabashi, Chiba Prefecture. The Tōzai Line was referred to as Line 5 during the planning stages; the seldom-used official name is . The line carries an average of 1,642,378 passengers daily (2017), making it the busiest line on the Tokyo Metro network. On maps, diagrams and signboards, the Tōzai Line is shown using the color &quot;sky blue&quot; and its stations are given numbers using the letter &quot;T&quot;.

==Overview==
The line runs through central Tokyo from east to west via Takadanobaba, Waseda, Ōtemachi, Nihombashi, Kiba and Urayasu. It was opened as a bypass route for the Chuo Rapid Line and the Sobu Line, which were heavily congested at the time. It is the only Tokyo Metro line to extend into Chiba Prefecture (although the Shinjuku Line operated by Toei also extends into Chiba Prefecture.) It also runs above-ground for from to , nearly half of the line and longer than any other railway line in the Tokyo subway network.

The Tōzai Line features through services at both ends of the line. Trains run onto the JR East Chūō-Sōbu Line for at the western (Nakano) end, and onto either the Chūō-Sōbu Line for or the Tōyō Rapid Railway Line for at the eastern (Nishi-Funabashi) end.

According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation in 2018, the Tokyo Metro Tōzai Line continues to be most crowded subway line in Tokyo, and the most crowded train line in all of Japan, with its peak running at 199% capacity between and stations. Women-only cars were introduced on the line for use during morning rush hour on November 20, 2006.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, peak ridership dropped from a rate of 199% in 2019 to 123% in 2020.

==History==

The Tōzai Line was planned by a review committee of the then Ministry of Transportation in 1962 and numbered Line 5. Its name literally means &quot;East-West Line&quot;, and it was primarily planned to relieve traffic on the busy Sōbu Main Line as well as provide a straight crosstown connection through north-central Tokyo. Although this corridor is also served by the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation (Toei) Shinjuku Line and JR Keiyō Line, the Tōzai Line continues to operate beyond capacity due to its accessibility to other lines, as well as to growing condominium developments in eastern Tokyo.

The to section opened in 1964, and the remainder opened in stages until its completion in 1969. Through service with the then Japanese National Railways (today part of the JR Group) – a first for a Tokyo subway line – began in 1969 connecting the Chūō and Sōbu lines. This is a rare situation in Tokyo, as the only other subway line with through services onto JR lines is the Chiyoda Line.

The Tōyō Rapid Railway Line, effectively an eastward extension of the line, opened in 1996. It nevertheless remains a private entity to which the Tōzai lines offers through services.

===Chronology===

<text>Sacred groves, sacred woods, or sacred forests are groves of trees that have special religious importance within a particular culture. Sacred groves feature in various cultures throughout the world. These are forest areas that are, for the most part, untouched by local people and often protected by local communities. They often play a critical role in protecting water sources and biodiversity, including essential resources for the groups that protect them.

They were important features of the mythological landscape and cult practice of Celtic, Estonian, Baltic, Germanic, ancient Greek, Near Eastern, Roman, and Slavic polytheism. They are also found in locations such as India (Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu), Japan (sacred shrine forests), China (Fengshui woodland), West Africa and Ethiopia (church forests). Examples of sacred groves include the Greco-Roman &quot;temenos&quot;, various Germanic words for sacred groves, and the Celtic &quot;nemeton&quot;, which was largely but not exclusively associated with Druidic practice.

During the Northern Crusades of the Middle Ages, conquering Christians commonly built churches on the sites of sacred groves. The Lakota and various other North American tribes regard particular forests or other natural landmarks as sacred places. Singular trees which a community deems to hold religious significance are known as sacred trees.

==In history==
===Ancient Greece and Rome===
The most famous sacred grove in mainland Greece was the oak grove at Dodona. Outside the walls of Athens, the site of the Platonic Academy was a sacred grove of olive trees, still recalled in the phrase &quot;the groves of Academe&quot;.

In central Italy, the town of Nemi recalls the Latin &quot;nemus Aricinum&quot;, or &quot;grove of Ariccia&quot;, a small town a quarter of the way around the lake. In antiquity, the area had no town, but the grove was the site of one of the most famous of Roman cults and temples: that of Diana Nemorensis, a study of which served as the seed for Sir James Frazer&#x27;s seminal work on the anthropology of religion, &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;.

A sacred grove behind the House of the Vestal Virgins on the edge of the Roman Forum lingered until its last vestiges were burnt in the Great Fire of Rome in 64 CE.

In the town of Spoleto, Umbria, two stones from the late third century BCE, inscribed in archaic Latin, that established punishments for the profanation of the woods dedicated to Jupiter (&quot;Lex Luci Spoletina&quot;) have survived; they are preserved in the National Archeological Museum of Spoleto.

The &quot;Bosco Sacro&quot; (literally &quot;sacred grove&quot;) in the garden of Bomarzo, Italy, lends its associations to the uncanny atmosphere.

&quot;Lucus Pisaurensis&quot;, the Sacred Grove of Pesaro, Italy was discovered by Patrician Annibale degli Abati Olivieri in 1737 on property he owned along the &#x27;Forbidden Road&#x27; (&quot;Collina di Calibano&quot;), just outside Pesaro. This sacred grove is the site of the Votive Stones of Pesaro and was dedicated to &quot;Salus&quot;, the ancient Roman demi-goddess of well-being.

The city of Massilia, a Greek colony, had a sacred grove so close by it that Julius Caesar had it cut down to facilitate his siege. In &quot;Pharsalia&quot;, the poet Lucan dramatized it as a place where sunlight could not reach through the branches, where no animal or bird lived, where the wind did not blow, but branches moved on their own, where human sacrifice was practiced, in a clear attempt to dramatize the situation and distract from the sacrilege entailed in its destruction.

===Ancient Near East===
There are couple of mentions on this tradition in the Bible:

The Garden of Eden, described in the Bible, is viewed as a divine, paradisiacal grove. In Judaism and Christianity, the Garden is often interpreted as the idealized afterlife paradise. In Christianity, it represents a state of purity and communion with God before the Fall of Man. The Garden of Eden is also regarded as a symbolic station in the journey to the Kingdom of Heaven, which will be fully realized at the Second Coming of Christ.

In Gethsemane, the olive grove where Jesus prayed before his crucifixion, Christians believe the garden symbolizes divine interaction with nature, marking a pivotal moment in Christian salvation history. Similarly, Abraham’s grove

And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of God.
:—Genesis 21:33
Which emphasizes the religious importance of groves as sites for worship and connection to God. And as a symbolic representation where the women wove hangings for the grove.
:—II Kings 23:7
In both Judaism and Christianity, sacred groves were often protected spaces, where worship was believed to maintain the divine order, and their destruction was considered sacrilegious.Excavations at Labraunda, located in modern-day Turkey, have uncovered a significant sacred grove dedicated to Zeus Stratios, a deity associated with the protection of the people and the well-being of the land. The grove was central to the Carian people, serving as a space for both religious ceremonies and communal gatherings. The ritual use of this grove highlights the belief in trees as intermediaries between the divine and human realms, where offerings and prayers were made to ensure divine favor and prosperity.Similarly, at Afqa, located in Lebanon, there was a sacred grove dedicated to Adonis, a god of fertility, death, and rebirth. The Adonis grove was a focal point for fertility rites, symbolizing the seasonal cycle of nature. As with other sacred groves in the ancient world, the trees here were seen as living symbols of the deity’s presence, reinforcing the connection between nature, agriculture, and the divine. The reverence for groves dedicated to gods like Zeus and Adonis shows how sacred natural spaces were integral to the religious and social fabric of ancient Near Eastern cultures.

These sacred groves often became the heart of religious life in their respective regions, not only as sites for ritual but also as places of healing and divine communication, reinforcing the deep connection between nature and the divine in ancient belief systems.

===Baltic polytheism===
A sacred grove is known as &quot;alka(s)&quot; in Lithuanian and &quot;elks&quot; in Latvian, however, the terms are also sometimes used to refer to natural holy places in general.

The first mention of Baltic sacred groves dates back to 1075 when Adam of Bremen noted Baltic Prussian sacred groves and springs whose sacredness was believed to be polluted by the entry of Christians (&quot;solus prohibetur accessus lucorum et fontium, quos autumant pollui christianorum accessu&quot;). A few sacred groves in Sambian Peninsula are mentioned in the 14th-century documents of the Teutonic Order (&quot;sacra sylva, que Scayte vulgariter nominatur..., silva, quae dicitur Heyligewalt...&quot;). A religious centre of intertribal significance was Romuva (&quot;Romow&quot;) in Nadruvia, Prussia, as described by Peter of Dusburg in 1326.

For Curonians sacred groves were closely associated with the cult of the dead. By the early 15th century, with the disappearance of cremation traditions among the Curonians the sacred groves of Courland had lost their crematory function but remained as an inviolable place reserved for the dead. The role of the sacred forests in the 16th-century traditions of Curonian Kings is described in a travel description by Königsberg apothecary Reinhold Lubenau:

===Celtic polytheism===

The Celts used sacred groves, called &quot;nemeton&quot; in Gaulish, for performing rituals, based on Celtic mythology. The deity involved was usually Nemetona – a Celtic goddess. Druids oversaw such rituals. Existence of such groves have been found in Germany, Switzerland, Czech Republic and Hungary in Central Europe, in many sites of ancient Gaul in France, as well as England and Northern Ireland. Sacred groves had been plentiful up until the 1st century BC, when the Romans attacked and conquered Gaul. One of the best known &quot;nemeton&quot; sites is that in the &quot;Nevet&quot; forest near Locronan in Brittany, France. Gournay-sur-Aronde (Gournay-on-Aronde), a village in the Oise department of France, also houses the remains of a &quot;nemeton&quot;.

Nemetons were often fenced off by enclosures, as indicated by the German term &quot;Viereckschanze&quot; – meaning a quadrangular space surrounded by a ditch enclosed by wooden palisades.

Many of these groves, like the sacred grove at Didyma, Turkey are thought to be &quot;nemeton&quot;s, sacred groves protected by druids based on Celtic mythology. In fact, according to Strabo, the central shrine at Galatia was called &quot;Drunemeton&quot;. Some of these were also sacred groves in Greek times (as in the case of Didyma), but were based on a different or slightly changed mythology.

===Germanic paganism===

Trees hold a particular role in Germanic paganism and Germanic mythology, both as individuals (sacred trees) and in groups (sacred groves). The central role of trees in Germanic religion is noted in the earliest written reports about the Germanic peoples, with the Roman historian Tacitus stating that Germanic cult practices took place exclusively in groves rather than temples. Scholars consider that reverence for and rites performed at individual trees are derived from the mythological role of the world tree, Yggdrasil; onomastic and some historical evidence also connects individual deities to both groves and individual trees. After Christianization, trees continue to play a significant role in the folk beliefs of the Germanic peoples.

==Today==

=== Africa ===

==== Benin and Togo ====
Across Benin and Togo (Dahomey Gap, West Africa), sacred forests form islands of biodiversity in the middle of overgrazed, woody, semiarid savannahs and croplands. Due to their tendency to be maintained over long periods of time, the sacred forests contain valuable remnants of ecological communities from the once extensive forests. Soils in these forests store significant amounts soil carbon as both soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC). Soil inorganic carbon is an important carbon sink because it preserved over a longer time frame than the soil organic carbon. There is a high potential for development of the soils for potential carbon sequestration.

==== Ghana ====
Sacred groves are also present in Ghana. One of Ghana&#x27;s most famous sacred groves – the Buoyem Sacred Grove – and numerous other sacred groves are present in the Techiman Municipal District and nearby districts of the Brong Ahafo Region. They provide a refuge for wildlife which has been exterminated in nearby areas, and one grove most notably houses 20,000 fruit bats in caves. The capital of the historical Ghana Empire, contained a sacred grove called &quot;al-gâba&quot; (Ar. &quot;the forest&quot;) for performing religious rites of the Soninke people. Other sacred groves in Ghana include sacred groves along the coastal savannahs of Ghana. Many sacred groves in Ghana are now under federal protection – like the &quot;Anweam Sacred Grove&quot; in the Esukawkaw Forest Reserve Other well-known sacred groves in present-day Ghana include the &quot;Malshegu Sacred Grove&quot; in Northern Ghana – one of the last remaining closed-canopy forests in the savannah regions, and the Jachie sacred grove.

The Tanoboase Sacred Grove and Shrine is located near the village of Tanoboase in the Techiman, Brong Ahafo region of Ghana. The site is home of the Bono people.

==== Kenya ====
There are many groups of trees and groves that remain sacred to local indigenous populations, such as the Kikuyu, the Maasai, and the Mbeere tribe of central Kenya. In 2008, the Kaya forests, a group of 10 forest sites spread over 200 km (124 mi), were made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. They are a series of forests located along the coast of Kenya, accompanied by fortified villages known as kayas. These kayas were originally built in the 16th century but have uninhabited since the 1940s. They are now regarded as sacred sites.

Mount Kenya is a mountain of volcanic origin that stands 5,199 metres (17,057 feet) tall. It has a unique forest and plant ecosystem that holds significant biological and cultural importance, and is home to over 882 plant species. In 1949, it was designated a national park, and in 1978, the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme named it a Biosphere Reserve. It is considered a sacred site by the Kikuyu, who believed that the top of the mountain was the ‘house’ of God.

Ramogi hill is located in the Siaya County of western Kenya. The hill and forest cover a distance of 283 hectares (699 acres) and is home to rich flora including trees, shrubs, flowers, over 100 plant species in total. It is an important historical site for the Luo people of western Kenya, and is said to be the first site they established after migrating from South Sudan. The hill is named after Ramogi, a notable Luo leader. The hill and forests are considered holy and sacred, and the Luo people use the hill for cultural and religious practices, including as a source of herbal medicine and a place of meditation. According to the Luo people, the medicinal plants that grow in the forests of Ramogi hill are considered to have strong healing powers.

==== Nigeria ====

The concept of sacred groves is present in Nigerian mythology as well. The Osun-Osogbo Sacred Grove, containing dense forests, is located just outside the city of Osogbo, and is regarded as one of the last virgin high forests in Nigeria. It is dedicated to the fertility goddess in Yoruba mythology, and is dotted with shrines and sculptures. Oloye Susanne Wenger, an Austrian artist, helped revive the grove. The grove was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005.

=== Asia ===

Sacred forests continue to hold an important place in the everyday lives of Indigenous and rural people across South, East, and Southeast Asia. A large-scale comparative analysis of sacred groves in ten countries within these regions indicates that they have long played a critical role in the protection of watersheds and water sources.

==== Cambodia ====
Indigenous Bunong people in Mondulkiri province, Cambodia consider forests to be sacred. Deforestation and land concessions in the country has threatened their land tenure and traditions.

==== India ====

In India, sacred groves are scattered all over the country, and do enjoy protection. Prior to 2002, these forest regions were not recognized under any of the existing laws. But in 2002 an amendment was brought in Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 to include Sacred Groves under the act. In 2016, a framework was published by the intergovernmental organization ICIMOD to help assess the present day significance of sacred natural sites, including sacred groves in all Himalayan countries to enable better policy uptake of these sites. Some NGOs work with local villagers to protect such groves. Each grove is associated with a presiding deity, and the groves are referred to by different names in different parts of India. They were maintained by local communities with hunting and logging strictly prohibited within these patches. While most of these sacred deities are associated with local Hindu gods, sacred groves of Islamic and Buddhist origins are also known. Sacred groves occur in a variety of places – from scrub forests in the Thar Desert of Rajasthan maintained by the Bishnois, to rain forests in the Kerala Western Ghats. Himachal Pradesh in the North and Kerala in the South are specifically known for their large numbers of sacred groves. The Kodavas of Karnataka maintained over 1000 sacred groves in Kodagu alone.

The district of Uttara Kannada in Karnataka also harbours a large number of sacred groves.

Around 14,000 sacred groves have been reported from all over India, which act as reservoirs of rare fauna, and more often rare flora, amid rural and even urban settings. Experts believe that the total number of sacred groves could be as high as 100,000. Threats to the groves include urbanization, and over-exploitation of resources. While many of the groves are looked upon as abode of Hindu gods, in the recent past a number of them have been partially cleared for construction of shrines and temples.

Ritualistic dances and dramatizations based on the local deities that protect the groves are called &quot;Theyyam&quot; in Kerala and &quot;Nagmandalam&quot;, among other names, in Karnataka. There are sacred groves in Ernakulam region in a place named Mangatoor in Kerala. Sacred groves are being destroyed as a part of urbanization. The family &quot;Nalukettil Puthenpurayil&quot; still protects sacred groves.

Dev Bhoomi, or the &quot;Land of Gods,&quot; is part of the 133 sacred groves in the foothills of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand. Known for its rivers, lakes, caves, and forests, it is considered the holiest land in the region. Local communities honor deities like Haat Kaali, Kotgyari Devi, and Mahakaali. Unlike typical forests, these sacred groves are alpine meadows, deeply tied to the ethnic identity of local groups. Their survival is believed to depend on oral traditions, with no written laws. Customary taboos forbid harming the groves, including plucking flowers, uprooting plants, or disturbing animals and religious objects. Despite the abundance of sacred groves in India, they are gradually disappearing due to cultural shifts and growing pressure to exploit the natural resources within these groves.

==== Japan ====
Sacred groves in Japan are typically associated with Shinto shrines and are located all over Japan. They have existed since ancient times and shrines are often built in the midst of preexisting groves. The Cryptomeria tree is venerated in Shinto practice, and considered sacred.

Among the sacred groves associated with such &quot;jinja&quot;s or Shinto shrines is the 20-hectare wooded area associated with at Atsuta-ku, Nagoya. The 1500-hectare forest associated with Kashima Shrine was declared a &quot;protected area&quot; in 1953. Today it is part of the Kashima Wildlife Preservation Area. The woods include over 800 kinds of trees and varied animal and plant life.

 is a general term for a wooded area associated with the Kamo Shrine, which is a Shinto sanctuary near the banks of the Kamo River in northeast Kyoto. The ambit of today&#x27;s forest encompasses approximately 12.4 hectares, which are preserved as a national historic site (国の史跡). The Kamigamo Shrine and the Shimogamo Shrine, along with other Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto (Kyoto, Uji and Otsu Cities), have been designated World Heritage Sites since 1994.

===== Okinawa =====
The Utaki sacred sites (often with associated burial grounds) on Okinawa are based on Ryukyuan religion, and usually are associated with toun or &quot;kami-asagi&quot; – regions dedicated to the gods where people are forbidden to go. Sacred groves are often present in such places, as also in Gusukus – fortified areas which contain sacred sites within them. The Seifa-utaki was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site designated in 2003. It consists of a triangular cavern formed by gigantic rocks, and contains a sacred grove with rare, indigenous trees like the Kubanoki (a kind of palm) and the &quot;yabunikkei&quot; or Cinnamomum japonicum (a form of wild cinnamon). Direct access to the grove is forbidden.

==== Malaysia ====

Much of the ways of the ancient inhabitants of Malaysia have largely been forgotten, mostly due to the taboos among the local populace on putting certain esoteric knowledge down in ink, thus only passed down through examples and word of mouth from mother to daughter and father to son. However, much can be observed by the ways and habits of the natives of Malaysia which include 18 tribes of Orang Asli (Malay for Natural People) and the Malays, who are often regarded as the 19th tribe.

There is a practice of tree planting around houses to the extent that the walls and wooden structures are allowed to give way to the roots of creeping plants, purposely sown at the bases of these structures. With increased migration towards the larger cities, these houses are abandoned and allowed to return to nature. As most traditional Orang Asli and Malay houses are made of only wood, bamboo, rattan and woven palm leaves (being built without using a single nail), the remains of those houses crumble easily into its surrounding.

Besides that, a practice of creating arches of vine and creeping flowering plants so that each time one were to enter the gates of the house, one has to bow, as if implying or imitating respect upon entry to a sacred grove which were practiced by their ancestors. Such practices are even performed by those who have migrated into the cities who prefer to live in houses on the ground, rather than in high rise apartments. A garden of fruit trees surrounded by larger trees are planted around the houses to provide shade and an illusion of being at &#x27;home&#x27; as well as to provide sustenance (in the form of fruits and seeds) to squirrels, foxes, insects and birds. Commonly, a cat, or in most instances, many cats are kept to patrol the gardens and guard from harmful spirits as well as against rats which were believed to carry unclean spirits and diseases.

However, one of the most striking examples of the tree reverence among them can be seen in the graveyards which are considered as holy ground, on which no stone structure can be built upon. The whole area are covered by large and tall trees, so much foliage that the scorching tropical sun is reduced to a dim shadow as temperatures drop to a comfortable cool. Malay folklore relates that the trees whisper prayers to the creator in absolution of the past transgression of the ground&#x27;s once human inhabitants. The trees are also allowed to take root into the graves where the grave keepers (&quot;penjaga kubur&quot; in Malay) slowly remove gravestones (which used to be made from wood) as they are ejected from the grounds onto the surface. There is also a ritual of planting small tree sapling on fresh graves by family members who will then water it and tend to it periodically. Petals from fresh red and pink roses are also brought upon visitation to be scattered on the graves and a ritual of pouring rose water upon the soils are also performed.

The Malays regard visiting the graves from between sunset to sunrise as a taboo as it is believed that as sunrise is the beginning of the day to mankind, sunset is perceived as the beginning of &quot;day&quot; to those who dwell in the grave area. Burials are almost always postponed until the next day except in certain cases where it is allowed, provided that additional rules are observed, such as, women and children are not allowed at the night time burial ceremony.

An ancient ritual of renaming the deceased as she or he is laid into the earth is also practiced. The Orang Asli and Malay (see Malaysian names) naming system has a living name and a spirit name, which is given during the ritual of burial. This name is known as &quot;nama arwah&quot; (spirit name). The living name is usually the given name plus the word &#x27;anak&#x27; which means &#x27;son/daughter of&#x27; or &#x27;bin&#x27; and &#x27;binti&#x27; which mean &#x27;son of&#x27; or &#x27;daughter of&#x27; respectively; followed by the name of the father. When a person dies, the father&#x27;s name is replaced with his or her mother&#x27;s name and this is made known during the reading of burial sentences.

==== Nepal ====
Granted World Heritage status by UNESCO in 1997, Lumbini Grove is a Buddhist pilgrimage site in the Rupandehi District of Nepal. It is the place where, according to Buddhist tradition, Queen Mayadevi gave birth to Siddhartha Gautama in 623 BCE. Gautama, who achieved nirvana some time around 543 BCE, became the Lord Gautama Buddha and founded Buddhism after achieving Enlightenment. The Mayadevi Temple is located at Lumbini.

==== Philippines ====
In the animistic native Filipino religion called Bathala, the worshiping &quot;anito&quot; spirits, &quot;balete&quot; trees (&quot;Ficus&quot; spp.), also known as &quot;nonok&quot; or &quot;nunuk&quot;, are regarded as abodes of spirits or gateways to the spirit world. Cutting them down was taboo, a superstition that is still followed today. Outdoor shrines or altars known as &quot;dambana&quot;, &quot;latangan&quot;, and &quot;tambara&quot; among other names were often built near the trees during shaman rituals. Aside from individual trees, natural formations, bodies of water, rocks, groves, and even entire forests also commonly became sacred places to various communities.

==== Thailand ====

Sacred groves, mostly connected to Thai folk belief, are known to have existed in Thailand since medieval times. Recently, new areas are being marked off as sacred as an environmental movement.

==== Singapore ====
Keramat Kusu is an island with &quot;keramat&quot; graves.

===Europe===

====Estonia====

Based on historical data, it is estimated that there are around 2500 sacred natural sites in Estonia, the largest of them covering up to 100 hectares. Although rather exceptional among most of the technologically developed countries, in Estonia both the sacred natural sites and indigenous customs connected to them are still in use. Therefore, the heritage that is connected to sacred natural sites has great importance to the national identity and environment of Estonians.

In a collaboration between followers of Estonian native religion (Maausk) and governmental ministries, a national plan was prepared in 2008: &quot;Sacred Natural Sites in Estonia: Study and Conservation 2008–2012&quot; which includes about 550 sacred groves (). The National Plan on Sacred Natural Sites consists of a historical overview of sacred natural sites in Estonia, a current situation analysis, and several concrete conservation measures and instructions on how to apply them. The coordinating steering committee of the Conservation Plan consists of Environment, Agriculture, Internal Affairs and Education and Research ministries, National Heritage Board and MK. The University of Tartu is the implementing agency. Measures of the Conservation Plan are designed to handle natural sanctuaries and values connected to them in all aspects.

The Conservation Plan foresees creating a database which supports researching and managing natural sanctuaries. The database would consist of folkloric, archaeological, natural, historical and other data on sacred natural sites and provide information on the exact location, condition and form of ownership of each site. In 2011 a scandal occurred when a company started clearcutting Rebala&#x27;s sacred grove nearby Maardu manor due to a misunderstanding between the Environmental Board and the National Heritage Board.

==== Russia ====
Both the prechristian Slavic pagans and some Siberian pagans of the modern era considered trees or forests themselves sacred. Throughout the boreal forests of Siberia, there are upwards of 600 known sacred groves and over twice that number are estimated to exist. These are most prominent in Komi, Buryatia, Irktusk, and the Sakha Republic.

==== Finland ====
Finnish &quot;hiisi&quot; sites are locations where the dead and spirits of ancestors are worshipped and respected. While the exact definition of the word &quot;hiisi&quot; is still unclear, they are often describes as situated on the top of stony mountains or hills and are often close to water. &quot;Hiisi&quot; sites are considered holy groves. In 1967, the linguist Mauno Koski produced a list of &quot;hiisi&quot; sites in his doctoral thesis. In list, he mentions 14 possible &quot;hiisi&quot; sites, mostly from the provinces of Southwest Finland, Satakunta, and Häme. The word &quot;hiisi&quot; is used in archaeological literature as denoting a pre-Christian burial site or sacred grove, and the negative connotations of the word (devil, demon) probably developed during Christian times.

====Latvia====

There are three known sacred groves associated with the seven Curonian King villages in Turlava parish, Courland. The most famous one of them is the Ķoniņi Elka Grove (&quot;Ķoniņu Elka birzs&quot;) or simply Elka that today covers around one hectare of land and is protected as an archaeological monument of national importance. Folklore researcher Sandis Laime has suggested that the sacred grove might have been a religious centre and probably covered a more extensive area in the past. He points to the toponym Elka Meadow (&quot;Elku pļava&quot;) localized approximately 1.5 kilometres from the remaining grove and speculates that the meadow could have retained its original name even after the part of the sacred grove on it was cut down. Nowadays a strong oral tradition persists among the Turlava area residents regarding the prohibition of certain actions in the grove and the misfortune that may follow if the prohibitions are not abided.

==== Lithuania ====

There are around 40 known sacred groves and forests in Lithuania. Lithuanian archaeologist Vykintas Vaitkevičius has grouped some of the sacred forests and groves according to the components &quot;šventas&quot; (13), &quot;alka&quot; (11) and &quot;gojus&quot; (more than 520) in their name.
==== Poland ====
Kleczanów Forest is a sacred forest in the vicinity of Kleczanów village in Sandomierz County, Poland. It features an ancient site of 37 Slavic kurgans (burial mounds) 4–10 metres high.

===Americas===

====United States====
The Lakota and various other North American tribes consider particular forests or other natural landmarks to be sacred. This is one of the reasons that there has been recent dispute over the nullification of acknowledgment of Native American reservation land by the US government and an attempt to compensate Native Americans for the reacquisition of this sacred space.

== Ecology ==

Sacred groves are found to be some of the first examples of habitat and ecological protection in human history, due to the spiritual importance of the area. Due to this historical protection, sacred groves have been found to harbor larger amounts as well as more breadth of biodiversity than surrounding areas.

== In fiction ==

* J. R. R. Tolkien included many magical trees and woods in his fictional writings which he based on English and Norse mythology. 
* George R. R. Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; features &quot;godswoods&quot;, sacred groves containing sacred trees, notably &quot;weirwood&quot; trees but also oaks, et al.
* In &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; video game series there is a location called the Sacred Grove in Hyrule, usually depicted as a gateway to the Temple of Time and thus the Sacred Realm, one of the most important locations in the series&#x27; backstory.
* In MTV&#x27;s &quot;Teen Wolf&quot;, a sacred tree known as a nemeton serves as a beacon for supernatural creatures and retained some of its power even after being cut down.
* In the Hayao Miyazaki animated film &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; the large tree in which the Totoros live is modeled after a 2000-year-old sacred camphor tree in Japan.
* James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot;, the natives of Pandora, the Na&#x27;vi, live in a massive tree called Hometree and at the center of their sacred grove is the Tree of Souls.

<doc id="1035887" wikidata="Q844697" url="?curid=1035887" title="Jimmy Kudo">
<text>, known in some major English adaptations as Jimmy Kudo, is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the manga series &quot;Case Closed&quot;, created by Gosho Aoyama. A high school detective, he is forced to ingest a poison after an encounter with members of a criminal organization. Due to a rare side effect, the poison did not kill him, but instead shrunk his body into that of a child, forcing him to adopt the pseudonym . He lives with his childhood friend Ran Mouri and her father as he awaits the day he can take down the organization that poisoned him and reclaim his original identity.

==Creation and conception==
The idea that Shinichi Kudo would be turned into a child stemmed from the idea of a Tortoiseshell cat Sherlock Holmes as a protagonist. Gosho Aoyama&#x27;s idea was the cat would indicate the crucial evidence needed to solve the case; a performance the child-turned Shinichi does to help those around with the investigation. Shinichi was inspired by the fictional private eye Shunsaku Kudo. Aoyama revealed that his editor was against the name Conan due to the protagonist from the anime series &quot;Future Boy Conan&quot; sharing the same name and had suggested to name him Doyle instead. The author stuck with the name Conan believing it would overtake the &quot;Future Boy&quot; series. According to Aoyama, Shinichi&#x27;s catch phrase, , was thought of by the anime adaptation&#x27;s script writer and written into chapter 95 of the manga at the same time. In the English localizations, the catch phrase is translated as &quot;One Truth Prevails&quot;.

Aoyama said that Conan&#x27;s hair was similar to the character in his previous manga work &quot;Yaiba&quot;, and that the cowlick was inspired by Kabu from &quot;Sally the Witch&quot;. His outfit is inspired from what boys wear for the Shichi-Go-San festivals; having worn such things himself when he was a kid. Conan&#x27;s glasses were based on Clark Kent and were discussed in series with Anita in volume 24. Jimmy&#x27;s manner of speech is inspired from Joe Yabuki from &quot;Ashita no Joe&quot;.

==Appearances==
===In &quot;Case Closed&quot;===
Shinichi appears at the beginning of the series as a gifted 16-year-old student at Teitan High School in Tokyo. He was already well known as a brilliant young detective who had closed many difficult cases that the professionals could not. He is also secretly in love with his childhood best friend Ran Mouri (Rachel Moore), but refuses to admit his feelings due to both stubbornness and shyness. Later while on a date with Ran to a theme park, Shinichi leaves Ran and follows two suspicious characters, Gin and Vodka, suspecting they are criminals. Gin ends up attacking Shinichi and forces him to drink an experimental poison APTX (Apotoxin) which is supposed to kill him, and then leaves him for dead. However, instead of killing Shinichi, a rare side-effect occurs, causing his age to regress, and he shrinks into the form of a young child. With advice from Dr. Hiroshi Agasa, Shinichi adopts the identity of Conan Edogawa, devised from the names of Arthur Conan Doyle and Edogawa Rampo to prevent Gin, Vodka, and their syndicate, the Black Organization, from returning to kill him and those around him. For this reason, he chooses not to reveal his true identity to anyone else, to keep them safe.

Shinichi pretends to be a distant relative of Dr. Agasa&#x27;s and is placed in the care of Ran and her father, Kogoro Mouri (Richard Moore), who owns a detective agency. Shinichi and Dr. Agasa feel that some clues regarding the Black Organization may possibly filter through the agency, allowing Shinichi to learn more about them to ultimately bring them down. As for Shinichi&#x27;s disappearance, Conan has to constantly find creative ways to fool Ran into believing he is off solving a very difficult case and will return once the investigation is concluded. This becomes increasingly difficult as she begins to suspect who he really is.

As a child, Conan must attend Teitan Elementary, where he inadvertently forms a detective club called the Detective Boys (Junior Detective League) with friends he makes at the school. Conan is forced to adapt to his new daily life and becomes accustomed to attending elementary school while secretly helping Richard solve crimes with the use of his gadgets invented by Dr. Agasa. The most prominent of these are: his voice-changing bowtie, allowing him to impersonate anyone&#x27;s voice; his customized glasses which allow him to track and listen through his covert listening devices; his super sneakers which multiply his kicking force; his wrist watch stun gun, which allows him to tranquilize Richard or a criminal; his Solar Powered skateboard as well as a soccer ball dispenser belt, super strong/elastic suspenders, among others.

Conan eventually meets Heiji Hattori (Harley Hartwell), a detective from Osaka who is seeking to challenge Shinichi in a deductive battle. After drinking baijiu while sick with a cold, Conan reverts to a teenager and rectifies a deduction made by Heiji. In their second encounter, Heiji is able to deduce Conan&#x27;s identity as Shinichi Kudo and confronts him about it. The two later become good friends.

As the series progresses, Conan befriends biochemist Shiho Miyano, a former member of the Black Organization and inventor of the APTX-4869 drug. She and her sister had grown up within the organization, as their scientist parents had been members too, before their deaths. After her sister was killed by Gin, she took the poison to commit suicide. However, like Shinichi, her age regressed and she shrank back to a small child&#x27;s size. She then escapes and adopts the pseudonym Ai Haibara (Anita Hailey). Dr. Agasa ends up taking her in, and she vows to help Conan take down the Black Organization. She later invents a prototype antidote to the APTX-4869 allowing Conan to temporarily become Shinichi again, which Conan uses on occasion to fool Ran when she suspects his true identity. During the events of &quot;Holmes&#x27; Revelation&quot;, Shinichi, while in his original form, confesses his feelings to Ran in London. In &quot;The Scarlet School Trip,&quot; Ran returns those feelings by giving Shinichi a kiss on the cheek.

Conan&#x27;s investigation of the Black Organization leads him to discover the American FBI&#x27;s existence in Japan, as they are also investigating the syndicate. The head of the syndicate, often referred to as &#x27;that person&#x27; and &#x27;boss&#x27; by syndicate members, who is at least one-hundred and thirty, is Renya Karasuma. However, the FBI and Conan are currently unaware of this. His collaboration with FBI agents Jodie Starling and Shuichi Akai allows them to capture organization member Kir. They discover she is really an undercover CIA agent and return her to the organization to continue to spy from within.

===In other media===
Shinichi Kudo has appeared in all of the feature films of the series, both the original video animation series (Shōnen Sunday Original animations and the Magic Files), the two-hour cross-over television special &quot;Lupin the 3rd vs Detective Conan&quot;, and is the protagonist in all &quot;Case Closed&quot;-related video games. He is the protagonist in the novels of the series. In the 2006–2007 live-action series, he is portrayed by Shun Oguri as a teenager and Nao Fujisaki in child form. In the 2011 live-action movie and TV drama series, Junpei Mizobata portrays the teenage Shinichi.

In 2006, the Japanese government used Conan in campaigns to help promote crime awareness among children. Targeting the same audience, Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs used Conan and his friends in two pamphlets: one to promote the ministry&#x27;s mission, the other to introduce the 34th G8 summit held in the country in 2010. Conan and his friends were also featured in the sixth installment of the Anime, Heroes and Heroines commemorative stamp series issued by Japan Post in 2006.

==Reception==
In the survey &quot;friendship&quot; developed by &quot;rankingjapan.com&quot; in which people had to choose what anime character they would like to have as a friend, Shinichi ranked third. In &quot;Newtype&quot; magazine Shinichi ranked fourth and ninth in the 2001 and 2010 polls for most popular male anime character, respectively. In the &quot;Animage&quot;″s Anime Grand Prix awards from 1998, Shinichi was voted as the tenth most popular male anime character. Mania Entertainment rated Conan as the third greatest anime detective. Shinichi Kudo and Conan Edogawa were the second and third most popular characters in the series defined by a poll on ebooksjapan.jp. Jian DeLeon of &quot;Complex&quot; magazine named him eighteenth on a list of &quot;The 25 Most Stylish Anime Characters.&quot; Additionally, in 2017 Charapedia poll, Kudo ranked as the 5th most ideal Prime Minister in anime series. Conan won the &quot;clever&quot; award in the &quot;Animedia&quot;&#x27;s magazine &quot;Animedia Character Awards 2019&quot; for standout anime characters chosen by the readers. In Japanese, &quot;Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair&quot; protagonist Hajime Hinata was voiced by Takayama. Due to Kudo&#x27;s popularity, the game staff developed a snowboarding minigame as Kudo often surfs a turbo skateboard. In a Japanese poll from &quot;AnimeAnime&quot;, Kudo was voted as the best character voiced by Takayama.

<text>Gateway STEM High School (formerly known as Gateway Institute of Technology) is a public magnet high school in St. Louis, Missouri, United States.

==History==
Gateway opened as John O&#x27;Fallon Technical High School in 1956, named in honor of John O&#x27;Fallon. Under its former name it opened in August 1992, in response to a court order mandating the establishment of a high technology magnet school. The school integrates a strong academic curriculum emphasizing mathematics and science with career preparation in highly technical fields. Accelerated and advanced placement courses are available for students. Inquiry, innovation, creativity and exploration are encouraged throughout the school. In June 2012 The School was renamed as Gateway STEM High School or Gateway Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics High School.

Gateway was one of ten schools recognized as a New American High School by the United States Department of Education in 1996. Gateway serves as a model school and is visited regularly by educators from the U.S. and elsewhere. The school also has the long time Music and Band instructor Steven Hill who has been at the school since its opening in 1992.

==Student body==
The school has 970 students, who are accepted on a lottery basis. Approximately 200 of the students have disabilities, including severe orthopedic disabilities, learning disabilities, and behavior challenges. Gateway accepts gifted students.

==Academics==
At the ninth and tenth grade level students are in &#x27;houses&#x27; of 85 to 100 students supported by four teachers (covering English, social studies, math, and science, respectively) and a counselor. The school is designed to integrate academic and technological education in career clusters that require students to have a strong background in mathematics and science. All the students take a broad mathematics curriculum, biology, chemistry, and physics.

Going into their junior year, students pick a career strand, or &#x27;major&#x27;, within one of several specialty areas:
*Agricultural, Biological, and Health Sciences.
*Applied Physical Sciences.
*Computer Science and Mathematics.
*Engineering Technology, which can include an Aviation Maintenance Program that lasts five years and is certified by the Federal Aviation Administration.

<doc id="1035899" wikidata="Q263176" url="?curid=1035899" title="Basters">
<text>The Basters (also known as Baasters, Rehobothers, or Rehoboth Basters) are a Southern African ethnic group descended from Cape Coloureds and Nama of Khoisan origin. Since the second half of the 19th century, the Rehoboth Baster community has been concentrated in central Namibia, in and around the town of Rehoboth. Basters are closely related to Afrikaners, Cape Coloureds, and Griquas of South Africa and Namibia, with whom they share a largely Afrikaner-influenced culture and Afrikaans language. Other groups of similar mixed ethnic origin, living chiefly in the Northern Cape, also refer to themselves as Basters.

The name &quot;Baster&quot; is derived from &quot;bastaard&quot;, the Dutch word for &quot;bastard&quot; or &quot;mongrel&quot;. While some people consider this term demeaning, the Basters reappropriated as an ethnonym, in spite of the negative connotation. Their 7th Kaptein is Jacky Britz, elected in 2021; he has no official status under the Namibian constitution. The Chief&#x27;s Council of Rehoboth was replaced with a local town council under the new government.

45,629 Namibians identified as Basters in the 2023 Census. Survival of the Baster culture and identity have been called into question in modern Namibia. Modern Namibia&#x27;s politics and public life are largely dominated by the ethnic Ovambo and their culture. Baster politicians and activists have called Ovambo policies oppressive towards their community.

==History==
===Origins===
Basters were mainly persons of mixed-race descent who at one time would have been absorbed in the white community. This term came to refer to an economic and cultural group, and it included the most economically advanced non-white population at the Cape, who had higher status than the natives. Some of the Basters acted as supervisors of other servants and were the confidential employees of their white masters. Sometimes, these were treated almost as members of the white family. Many were descended from white men, if not directly from men in the families for whom they worked.

The group also included Khoi, Free Negro, and persons of mixed-race descent who had succeeded in acquiring property and establishing themselves as farmers in their own right. The term Orlam (&quot;Oorlam&quot;) was sometimes applied to persons who could also be known as Baster. Orlams were the Khoi and Coloured (mixed-race) people who spoke Dutch and practised a largely European way of life. Some Basters distinguished themselves from the Coloured, whom they described as descendants of Europeans and Malay or Indonesian slaves brought to South Africa.

In the early 18th century, Basters often owned farms in the colony, but with growing competition for land and the pressure of race discrimination, they were oppressed by their white neighbours and the government. Some became absorbed into the Coloured servant class, but those seeking to maintain independence moved to the fringes of settlement. From about 1750, the Kamiesberge in the extreme north-west of the colony became the main area of settlement of independent Baster farmers, some of whom had substantial followings of servants and clients.

After about 1780, increasing competition and oppression from whites in this area resulted in the majority of the Baster families moving to the frontier of the interior. They settled in the middle valley of the Orange River, where they settled near De Tuin. Basters of the middle Orange were subsequently persuaded by London Missionary Society missionaries to adopt the name Griqua. Some sources say they chose the name themselves in honour of an early leader.

===Move to central Namibia===
Basters announced their intention to leave the Cape Colony in 1868 to search for land in the interior north. About 90 families of 100 left the region, the first 30 in 1869, with others following. They settled in Rehoboth in what is now central Namibia, on a high plateau between the Namib and Kalahari deserts. There they continued an economy based on managing herds of cattle, sheep, and goats. They were followed by Johann Christian Friedrich Heidmann, a missionary of the Rhenish Mission, who served them from 1871 until his retirement in 1907.
By 1872, Basters numbered 333 in Rehoboth. They founded the Free Republic of Rehoboth (Rehoboth Gebiet) and designed a German-influenced national flag. They adopted a constitution known as the &quot;Paternal Laws&quot; (original title in ). It continues to govern the internal affairs of the Baster community into the 21st century. The original document survived and is stored at the National Archives of Namibia in Windhoek.

Basters established a community based on birth. Under these laws, a citizen is a child of a Rehoboth citizen, or a person otherwise accepted as a citizen by its rules. Families continued to join them from the Cape Colony, and the community reached about 800 by 1876, when 80 to 90 families had settled there. The area was also occupied by native Damara people, but Basters did not include them in population reports.

While Basters remained predominantly based around Rehoboth, some Basters continued to trek northward, settling in the southern Angolan city of Lubango. There they became known as the &quot;Ouivamo.&quot; They had a similar culture based on maintaining herds of livestock.

Through the 1870s, Basters of Rehoboth suffered frequent losses from their herds, with livestock raided and stolen by the much larger groups of surrounding Nama and Herero peoples, who were themselves in competition. In 1880, Jan Afrikaner gathered 600 men against the Herero, and different Nama groups mustered about 1,000 warriors, with the Herero fielding about the same number. Basters tried to make alliances to survive, as they were outnumbered by both sides. The wars continued until about 1884, and, while suffering losses, Basters continued.

Through the 1880s, the community at Rehoboth were joined by other Baster families from Grootfontein (South) (whom missionary Heidmann had earlier tried to recruit), Okahandja, and Otjimbingwe. While based on descent within the families, they also accepted both blacks and whites who applied to join the community.

===German South West Africa===
In the process of the German annexation of South West Africa, Baster Kaptein Hermanus van Wyk signed a &#x27;Treaty of Protection and Friendship&#x27; with the German Empire on 11 October 1884. It was the first of its kind between any native-descended peoples in the territory and the Germans (Basters were considered native because of their partial African descent). Other sources date this treaty 15 September 1885, Under this, &quot;the independent executive powers of the Kaptein and Baster Council, especially for &quot;foreign policy&quot;, were significantly curtailed.&quot;

In 1893, the Germans established the territory of the Basters, known as the Rehoboth &quot;Gebiet,&quot; which the settlers tried to expand through negotiation. In this area, the Paternal Laws were recognised. In addition, the German colony had an administrative district known as Rehoboth, which was larger than the Baster-governed area, with the outside areas under German (white) colonial law. Most of the land was developed as farms owned by European, especially German whites.

A second &quot;Treaty concerning National Service of the Rehoboth Basters&quot; of 1895 established a small armed contingent among the Basters, which fought alongside German colonists and forces in a number of battles and skirmishes against indigenous peoples. When the German colonists encountered a new wave of conflicts with native peoples, Basters fought with them in quelling the uprisings of the OvaHerero (1896), the Swartbooi Nama (1897), and the Bondelswarts (1903). They also participated in the German colonial war and widespread genocide against the OvaHerero and Nama in the Herero Wars of 1904–1907.
German census reporting on Basters noted their high mobility. The numbers they recorded for the people changed as the Germans changed their racial classifications. Rather than using people&#x27;s citizenship (as in the community of Basters), they began to classify people according to appearance, as was done in South Africa. A comparison of records suggests that, in 1912, there were about 3,000 Basters in the Rehoboth District. Most Basters were concentrated in the Rehoboth Gebiet, where they lived under their own law.

Relations between Rehoboth and Germany remained close for more than 20 years until 1914, following the outbreak of World War I. The German &quot;Schutztruppe&quot; ordered all Baster able-bodied men into military service, which they resisted. Believing that the German &quot;Schutztruppe&quot; had little chance against the superior South African forces (allied with the British), Basters tried to maintain neutrality towards both, but feared losing their limited autonomy.

The Baster Council believed they reached agreement with Governor Theodor Seitz of South-West Africa that their men would only be used behind the lines. They did not want to participate in a war between whites. They disapproved of their men being issued German uniforms, fearing they would be considered regular soldiers. Despite their protests, Baster soldiers were assigned to duties far from the &quot;Gebiet.&quot; When Basters were assigned to guard South African prisoners of war in February 1915 at a camp at Uitdraii, they protested because nearly 50 of their men were connected to the people through historic kinship and language. Some aided escape by prisoners, and the Germans limited the number of bullets they issued to the Basters. The South Africans in turn protested being guarded by men they considered as Coloured (according to their racial classifications).

General Louis Botha had earlier written to Lieutenant Colonel Franke against using armed non-whites in service, as he was aware of both Cameroons and Basters serving under arms. Botha said he was ensuring that non-whites were not armed; Franke said that he was using the Cameroon and Baster companies only to police non-white communities.

Cornelius van Wyk, second &quot;Kaptein&quot; of the Rehoboth Basters, arranged to secretly meet with South African General Louis Botha on 1 April in Walvis Bay to assure him of the Basters&#x27; neutrality. No record was made of the meeting so it is unclear exactly what was promised. Van Wyk was hoping for assurances to have Baster territory and rights acknowledged if South Africa took over the German colony. Botha advised him to stay out of the war.

Due to South African successes, the German officers advised the Baster Council that they were moving the prisoners of war and Baster guards to the north. At a meeting, they said Basters had three days to decide whether to comply; the latter feared that having their men in the north would mean they would be considered true combatants against South Africa, endangering their own position. Learning of the planned deployment, the Baster guards advised the Council they would not go. Although negotiations were in process, they learned the trains were due to leave the next day, and the night of 18 April, numerous Basters defected from German service, taking arms with them that they intended to turn in at Rehoboth. About 300 men set up defences in two laagers. Learning of this, the Germans disarmed other Baster soldiers in other posts; in the process, one unarmed Baster was killed. Rehoboth was in an uproar, although leaders tried to meet with the Germans to resolve the issues.

In the meantime, Basters and Nama policemen worked to disarm German officers within the Rehoboth Gebiet, but wounded one fatally and killed another outright. An armed contingent including Nama policemen killed several German citizens, including all of the Karl Bauer family. With that, negotiations were over.

On 22 April 1915, Lieutenant Colonel Bethe informed the Basters in writing that they had violated the protection treaty and their acts were considered hostile by the Germans. Governor Theodor Seitz cancelled the protection treaty with the Basters, intending to attack Rehoboth. Van Wyk informed General Botha, who advised him to try to get the Basters out of the area. They started moving by wagons and taking large herds of livestock, with many Basters trying to reach the mountains. German attacks against Basters took place around the region.

According to Baster history, a 14-year-old Baster girl, who worked for the Germans in a camp, overheard a drunken conversation about their planned attack against the Basters. She took the word to the Kaptein, and around 700 Basters retreated to Sam Khubis south-east of Rehoboth in the mountains, to prepare for German attack. This group included women and children. Van Wyk had hidden his wife and children at farm Garies, along with the wives and children of Stoffel and Willem van Wyk. Stoffel&#x27;s wife, two children, an adult daughter of Cornelius van Wyk, and his 18-year-old son, were all killed there. The others, including van Wyk&#x27;s wife Sara, were taken to Leutwein station and released on 13 May.

On 8 May 1915, the Germans attacked in the Battle of Sam Khubis, where the stronghold was defended by 700 to 800 Basters. Despite repeated attacks and the use of two cannons and three Maxim machine-guns, the Germans were unable to destroy the Basters&#x27; position. They ended the attack at sunset. At the end of the day, Basters had all but run out of ammunition and expected defeat. That night they appealed to God, pledging to commemorate the day forever should they be spared.

Their prayer is engraved on a memorial plaque they later installed at Sam Khubis and reads:
&quot;God van ons vaderen / sterke en machtige God / heilig is Uw naam op die ganse aarde / Uw die de hemelen geschapen heft / neigt Uw oor tot ons / luister na die smekingen van Uwe kinderen / de dood staart ons in het gesicht / die kinderen der bose zoeken onze levens / Red ons uit die hand van onze vijanden / en beskermt onze vrouen en kinderen / En dit zult vier ons en onze nacheschlacht zijn een dag als een Zondag / waarop wij Uw naam prijzen en Uw goedertierenheid tot in euwigheid niet vergeten&quot;

&quot;God our father / strong and powerful / holy be Thy name all over the earth / Thou that made heaven / bow Thou down to us / listen to the cries of Thy children / death stares us in the face / the children of evil seek our lives / Save us from the hand of our enemies / and protect our wives and children / and this shall be for us and our kin a day like a Sunday / on which we shall praise Thy name / and Thy gratitude shall not be forgotten in eternity.&quot;
The Germans had received orders to retreat, which they did the next morning. Rehoboth&#x27;s Baster community survived. This day is celebrated annually by Basters as integral to their history and fortitude. Both units of the Germans were ordered to retreat in order to mobilise against advancing South African troops which reached Rehoboth.

As Basters returned to Rehoboth, some killed Germans on their farms. The Germans posted some forces for protection, but withdrew them on 23 May as the South Africans approached. Basters took German livestock and plundered their farms, also attacking the two missionaries&#x27; houses. The bloodshed on both sides left long resentment after the war.

===South African mandate rule (1915–1966)===
South Africa defeated the Germans, concluding the Peace of Khorab on 9 July 1915. It formally took over administration of South-West Africa and established martial law. Colonel H. Mentz advised the Baster leaders to avoid all confrontation with the Germans, in an effort to defuse tensions, and to report livestock losses or other problems to his administration at Windhoek. He also said that South African patrols would regularly be sent to the Rehoboth area to keep the peace.

After the conclusion of the Great War, Basters applied to have their native land become a British Protectorate like Basutoland, but were turned down by South Africa. All special rights as granted to Basters by the Germans were revoked under the South African mandate to govern South-West Africa. South Africa conducted regular censuses of the Basters from 1921 to 1991; the records reflect their ideas about racial classifications.

Some Basters continued to push for the legitimacy of the &#x27;Free Republic of Rehoboth.&#x27; Claiming that the republic had been recognised by the League of Nations, they said international law supported their desire for self-determination, which the League used as a principle in the organisation of new nations after the Great War. They asserted that the Republic should have the status of a sovereign nation. In 1952, Basters presented a petition to the United Nations (the successor to the League of Nations) to this effect, with no result. But they had some practical autonomy under South Africa.
During this period, some Baster leaders founded new political parties and were active in various movements in South-West Africa, also known as Namibia. By the early 1960s, they were among the first to petition the United Nations for international intervention to end the South African control of Namibia. The Owambo and other indigenous peoples also agitated for an end to South African colonialism, especially as that state had established apartheid with severe legal racial discrimination against the African peoples.
South Africa passed the &#x27;Rehoboth Self-government Act&#x27; of 1976, providing a kind of autonomy for the Basters. They settled for a semi-autonomous Baster Homeland (known as &quot;Baster Gebiet&quot;) based around Rehoboth, similar in status to the South African bantustans.

This was established in 1976, and an election was held for Kaptein. In 1979, Johannes &quot;Hans&quot; Diergaardt won a court challenge to the disputed election, in which incumbent Ben Africa had placed first. Diergaardt was installed as the 5th Kaptein of the Basters in accordance with the regulations of the 1976 Rehoboth Self-Determination Act and the Basters&#x27; Paternal Laws.

In 1981, South West Africa had a population of one million, divided into more than a dozen ethnic and tribal groups, and 39 political parties. With not more than 35,000 people at the time, Basters had become one of the smaller minority groups in the country of over one million.

In the 1980s, Basters still controlled about 1.4 million hectares of farmland in this territory. In earlier times, requirements for farms were thought to be about 7,000 ha, but Basters claimed they could also survive with farms of 4,000 ha. Nonetheless, even by the 1930s they were having to find alternative forms of employment to support their population. In 1981, the Baster population was estimated to at about 25,181 by Hartmut Lang, according to his 1998 article on the Baster group. Requirements for viable farms suggest that Namibia could not achieve self-sufficiency for its expanding population through farming; land redistribution could not yield enough area for viable farms.

===Independence===
The &quot;Baster Gebiet&quot; operated until 29 July 1989 and the imminent independence of Namibia. Upon assuming power in 1990, Namibia&#x27;s new ruling party, the South West African People&#x27;s Organisation (SWAPO) announced it would not recognise any special legal status for the Baster community. Many Basters felt that while SWAPO claimed it spoke for the whole country, it too strongly promoted the interests of its own political base in Ovamboland.

The Kaptein&#x27;s Council sought compensation for Rehoboth lands that it claimed had been confiscated by the government, with much sold to non-Basters. The council was given &quot;locus standi&quot; (the right of a party to appear and be heard before a court), but &quot;in 1995, a High Court verdict declared that Rehoboth lands were voluntarily handed over by the Rehoboth Baster community to the then new Namibian government.&quot;

In 1998, Kaptein Hans Diergaardt, elected in 1979 when Rehoboth had autonomous status under South Africa, filed an official complaint with the United Nations Human Rights Committee, charging Namibia with violations of minority rights of Basters. In &quot;Diergaardt v. Namibia&quot; (2000) the committee ruled that there was evidence of linguistic discrimination, as Namibia refused to use Afrikaans in dealing with Basters.

In 1999, following the death of Diergaardt, Basters elected John McNab as the 6th Kaptein of their community. He has no official status under the Namibian government. He has protested against the government&#x27;s management of former Baster land and says his farmers were forced to buy it back at high prices. Much of it has been sold to others since independence.

As preparations were underway for Sam Khubis Day in 2006, a respected social worker, Hettie Rose-Junius, asked the organising committee to &quot;consider inviting a delegation from the Nama-speaking people to this year’s festivities and in future.&quot; The chairperson rejected the suggestion by saying that historically the Nama had a separate fight with the Germans and were not involved with the Basters. Activities on this day include a re-enactment of the attack on the Basters in 1915, a flag raising, wreath laying and a church service.

In February 2007, the Kapteins Council has represented the Basters at the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO), an international pro-democracy organisation founded in 1991. Operating in The Hague, it works to &quot;facilitate the voices of unrepresented and marginalised nations and peoples worldwide, helping minorities to gain self-determination.&quot; Since November 2012, the UNPO has called on the Namibian government to recognise Basters as a &#x27;traditional authority&#x27; in their historic territory, as it has for some other ethnic groups in the country.

==Culture==

===Paternal Laws===
The first Kaptein&#x27;s Council established the &quot;Vaderlike Wette&quot; (Paternal Laws), established as a constitution of Baster people in the Free Republic of Rehoboth. These have influenced the actions of the Baster community into the 21st century, although they no longer have the force of law.

Basters have a long democratic tradition of electing their leadership. According to the Paternal Laws of 1872, a Kaptein is elected for life. This Kaptein was granted the powers to appoint members of a Council, and together they formed the Executive government of Rehoboth. The Paternal Laws also provided for a Peoples Council (&quot;Volksraad&quot;) which was elected every five years; it formed the Legislature of the Rehoboth government.

The Basters have had seven Kapteins since the Paternal Laws were enacted:
* 1872–1905: Hermanus van Wyk
* 1905–1914: Germans suspended the Kapteinship position and instead established a &quot;Basterrat&quot; ()
* 1914–1924: Cornelius van Wyk
* 1924–1925: Albert Mouton
* 1925–1975: The South African administration transferred all power from the &quot;Raad&quot; and the Kaptein to the Rehoboth Magistrate
* 1977–1979: Ben Africa
* 1979–1998: Hans Diergaardt
* 1999–2020: John McNab
* since 2021: Jacky Britz

Every male &quot;burger&quot; (citizen) of Rehoboth had the right to apply for a free piece of land at the age of 18. Although the size of this erf was decreased from to about , due to land shortage and servicing costs, Basters continued to honour this provision until 21 March 1990, when the new socialist government took over the lands. The newly independent Namibian government passed legislation about land use and title that took precedence over Baster traditions. Basters can no longer allocate land to their young men. The land is controlled by the local town council, which replaced the Chief&#x27;s Council.

===Religion and genetics===
Basters from Mainline churches are mostly Calvinist. They sing traditional hymns almost identical to those of the 17th-century Netherlands; these songs were preserved in the colony and their group during a period when the Netherlands churches were absorbing new music.

The average gene pool of Basters is about 48.4% European, 28,5% Khoe-San, 17.1% Asian and 5.7% Bantu; according to a 2013 autosomal genealogical DNA testing.

===Traditional leadership===

Largely through missionary work during the 19th century, they coalesced into fiercely independent, autonomous communities that maintained their identities even after being incorporated into the Cape Colony. Others moved farther north into what is now Namibia in the late 1860s because of pressure from Boer settlers and eventually established a settlement that became known as Rehoboth.

The first Kaptein was Hermanus van Wyk, the &#x27;Moses&#x27; of the Baster nation, who led the community to Rehoboth from South Africa. He served as Kaptein until his death in 1905. After his death, the German colonial government established a separate council. The Rehoboth Basters did not elect another Kaptein until the United Kingdom took over the territory as a British Protectorate in 1914 during World War I. Basters elected Cornelius van Wyk as Kaptein. He was not officially recognised by the South African authorities, which administered the territory from 1915 to Namibian independence in 1990. 

==Other Baster communities==
Similar terms are used for unrelated mixed-race Dutch and native communities in South Africa and elsewhere. For instance, a mixed-race community in the Richtersveld in South Africa are known as the &#x27;Boslys Basters.&#x27;

In Indonesia, the people of mixed Dutch and Indonesian descent are called &quot;Blaster(an).&quot;

<text>A saber-tooth (alternatively spelled sabre-tooth) is any member of various extinct groups of predatory therapsids, predominantly carnivoran mammals, that are characterized by long, curved saber-shaped canine teeth which protruded from the mouth when closed.

Among the earliest animals that can be described as &quot;sabertooths&quot; are the gorgonopsids, a group of non-mammalian therapsids that lived during the Middle-Late Permian, around 270-252 million years ago. Saber-toothed mammals have been found almost worldwide from the Eocene epoch to the end of the Pleistocene epoch (42 million years ago – 11,000 years ago).

One of the best-known genera is the machairodont or &quot;saber-toothed cat&quot; &quot;Smilodon&quot;, the species of which, especially &quot;S. fatalis&quot;, are popularly referred to as &quot;saber-toothed tigers&quot;, although they are not closely related to tigers (&quot;Panthera&quot;). Despite some similarities, not all saber-tooths are closely related to saber-toothed cats or felids in-general. Instead, many members are classified into different families of Feliformia, such as Barbourofelidae and Nimravidae; the oxyaenid &quot;creodont&quot; genera &quot;Machaeroides&quot; and &quot;Apataelurus&quot;; and two extinct lineages of metatherian mammals, the thylacosmilids of Sparassodonta, and deltatheroideans, which are more closely related to marsupials. In this regard, these saber-toothed mammals can be viewed as examples of convergent evolution. This convergence is remarkable due not only to the development of elongated canines, but also a suite of other characteristics, such as a wide gape and bulky forelimbs, which is so consistent that it has been termed the &quot;saber-tooth suite.&quot;

Of the feliform lineages, the family Nimravidae is the oldest, entering the landscape around 42 mya and becoming extinct by 7.2 mya. Barbourofelidae entered around 16.9 mya and were extinct by 9 mya. These two would have shared some habitats.

==Morphology==

The different groups of saber-toothed predators evolved their saber-toothed characteristics entirely independently. They are most known for having maxillary canines which extended down from the mouth when the mouth was closed. Saber-toothed cats were generally more robust than today&#x27;s cats and were quite bear-like in build. They are believed to have been excellent hunters, taking animals such as sloths, mammoths, and other large prey. Evidence from the numbers found at the La Brea Tar Pits suggests that &quot;Smilodon&quot;, like modern lions, was a social carnivore.

The first saber-tooths to appear were non-mammalian synapsids, such as the gorgonopsids; they were one of the first groups of animals within Synapsida to experience the specialization of saber teeth, and many had long canines. Some had two pairs of upper canines with two jutting down from each side, but most had one pair of upper extreme canines. Because of their primitiveness, they are extremely easy to tell from machairodonts. Several defining characteristics are a lack of a coronoid process, many sharp &quot;premolars&quot; more akin to pegs than scissors, and very long skulls. Despite their large canines, however, most gorgonopsians probably lacked the other specializations found in true saber-toothed predator ecomorphs. Two gorgonopsians, &quot;Smilesaurus&quot; and &quot;Inostrancevia&quot;, had exceptionally large canines and may have been closer functional analogues to later sabertooths.

The second appearance is in Deltatheroida, a lineage of Cretaceous metatherians. At least one genus, &quot;Lotheridium&quot;, possessed long canines, and given both the predatory habits of the clade as well as the generally incomplete material, this may have been a more widespread adaptation.
The third appearance of long canines is &quot;Thylacosmilus&quot;, which is the most distinctive of the saber-tooth mammals and is also easy to tell apart. It differs from machairodonts in possessing a very prominent flange and a tooth that is triangular in cross section. The root of the canines is more prominent than in machairodonts and a true sagittal crest is absent.

The fourth instance of saber-teeth is from the clade Oxyaenidae. The small and slender &quot;Machaeroides&quot; bore canines that were thinner than in the average machairodont. Its muzzle was longer and narrower.

The fifth saber-tooth appearance is the ancient feliform (carnivoran) family Nimravidae. Both groups have short skulls with tall sagittal crests, and their general skull shape is very similar. Some have distinctive flanges, and some have none at all, so this confuses the matter further. Machairodonts were almost always bigger, though, and their canines were longer and more stout for the most part, but exceptions do appear.

The sixth appearance is the barbourofelids. These feliform carnivorans are very closely related to actual cats. The best-known barbourofelid is the eponymous &quot;Barbourofelis&quot;, which differs from most machairodonts by having a much heavier and more stout mandible, smaller orbits, massive and almost knobby flanges, and canines that are farther back. The average machairodont had well-developed incisors, but barbourofelids&#x27; were more extreme.

The seventh and last saber-toothed group to evolve were the machairodonts themselves.
==Diet==

The evolution of enlarged canines in Tertiary carnivores was a result of large mammals being the source of prey for saber-toothed predators. The development of the saber-toothed condition appears to represent a shift in function and killing behavior, rather than one in predator-prey relations. Many hypotheses exist concerning saber-tooth killing methods, some of which include attacking soft tissue such as the belly and throat, where biting deep was essential to generate killing blows. The elongated teeth also aided with strikes reaching major blood vessels in these large mammals. However, the precise functional advantage of the saber-tooth&#x27;s bite, particularly in relation to prey size, is a mystery. A new point-to-point bite model is introduced in the article by Andersson et al., showing that for saber-tooth cats, the depth of the killing bite decreases dramatically with increasing prey size. The extended gape of saber-toothed cats results in a considerable increase in bite depth when biting into prey with a radius of less than 10 cm. For the saber-tooth, this size-reversed functional advantage suggests predation on species within a similar size range to those attacked by present-day carnivorans, rather than &quot;megaherbivores&quot; as previously believed.

A disputing view of the cat&#x27;s hunting technique and ability is presented by C. K. Brain in &quot;The Hunters or the Hunted?&quot;, in which he attributes the cat&#x27;s prey-killing abilities to its large neck muscles rather than its jaws. Large cats use both the upper and lower jaw to bite down and bring down the prey. The strong bite of the jaw is accredited to the strong temporalis muscle that attach from the skull to the coronoid process of the jaw. The larger the coronoid process, the larger the muscle that attaches there, so the stronger the bite. As C.K. Brain points out, the saber-toothed cats had a greatly reduced coronoid process and therefore a disadvantageously weak bite. The cat did, however, have an enlarged mastoid process, a muscle attachment at the base of the skull, which attaches to neck muscles. According to C.K. Brain, the saber-tooth would use a &quot;downward thrust of the head, powered by the neck muscles&quot; to drive the large upper canines into the prey. This technique was &quot;more efficient than those of true cats&quot;.

==Biology==
The similarity in all these unrelated families involves the convergent evolution of the saber-like canines as a hunting adaptation. Meehan &quot;et al.&quot; note that it took around 8 million years for a new type of saber-toothed cat to fill the niche of an extinct predecessor in a similar ecological role; this has happened at least four times with different families of animals developing this adaptation. Although the adaptation of the saber-like canines made these creatures successful, it seems that the shift to obligate carnivorism, along with co-evolution with large prey animals, led the saber-toothed cats of each time period to extinction. As per Van Valkenburgh, the adaptations that made saber-toothed cats successful also made the creatures vulnerable to extinction. In her example, trends toward an increase in size, along with greater specialization, acted as a &quot;macro-evolutionary ratchet&quot;: when large prey became scarce or extinct, these creatures would be unable to adapt to smaller prey or consume other sources of food, and would be unable to reduce their size so as to need less food.

More recently, it has been suggested that &quot;Thylacosmilus&quot; differed radically from its placental counterparts in possessing differently shaped canines and lacking incisors. This suggests that it was not ecologically analogous to other saber-teeth and possibly an entrail specialist. Another study has found that other saber toothed species similarly had diverse lifestyles and that superficial anatomical similarities obscure them.

==Saber-tooth taxonomy==

All saber-toothed mammals lived between 33.7 million and 9,000 years ago, but the evolutionary lines that led to the various saber-tooth genera started to diverge much earlier. It is thus a polyphyletic grouping.

The lineage that led to &quot;Thylacosmilus&quot; was the first to split off, in the late Cretaceous. It is a metatherian, and thus more closely related to kangaroos and opossums than the felines. The hyaenodonts diverged next, possibly before Laurasiatheria, then the oxyaenids, and then the nimravids, before the diversification of the truly feline saber-tooths.

<text>Philadelphia Field Club is a name used by four soccer teams based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. All four versions of Philadelphia F.C. competed in the first American Soccer League, but none were in any way related to the other three teams which shared its name.

==Philadelphia F.C.==
Philadelphia F.C. was an inaugural club of the American Soccer League based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Before the season, the owners of the powerful Bethlehem Steel F.C. decided to disband the club and form Philadelphia F.C. The club re-signed most of the top players from Bethlehem and players from elsewhere. Not surprisingly the team won the first ASL championship. After the season, the management broke up the team selling many of its top players due to financial trouble and lack of support. The team then returned to Bethlehem.

===Year-by-year===
==Philadelphia F.C./Celtic==
After the first Philadelphia F.C. returned to Bethlehem, a new team also called Philadelphia F.C. joined the American Soccer League for its second season. The new team was the polar opposite of the powerful Bethlehem languishing at the bottom of the table

After the 1926/27 season, the team was bought by new management who bought top talent from Ireland and renamed the club Philadelphia Celtic. The spending spree left the owners in financial straits and the club went bankrupt and were suspended by the league after playing only 10 games in the first half of the 1927/28 season.

===Year-by-year===
==Philadelphia F.C. III==
A third Philadelphia F.C. joined the American Soccer League the season after the Philadelphia Celtic was suspended. The team played a limited schedule and folded after its only season.

===Year-by-year===
==Bridgeport Bears/Philadelphia F.C.==
The Bridgeport Bears joined the American Soccer League in the fall of 1929. After only six games the team moved to Philadelphia to become another Philadelphia Field Club. They played eight more games before the season was suspended due to the merger of the ASL and the Eastern Soccer League.

<text>The Lerner symmetry theorem is a result used in international trade theory, which states that an ad valorem import tariff (a percentage of value or an amount per unit) will have the same effects as an export tax. The theorem is based on the observation that the effect on relative prices is the same regardless of which policy (ad valorem tariffs or export taxes) is applied.

The theorem was developed by economist Abba P. Lerner in 1936.

<doc id="1035915" wikidata="Q2517976" url="?curid=1035915" title="Sieve theory">
<text>Sieve theory is a set of general techniques in number theory, designed to count, or more realistically to estimate the size of, sifted sets of integers. The prototypical example of a sifted set is the set of prime numbers up to some prescribed limit &quot;X&quot;. Correspondingly, the prototypical example of a sieve is the sieve of Eratosthenes, or the more general Legendre sieve. The direct attack on prime numbers using these methods soon reaches apparently insuperable obstacles, in the way of the accumulation of error terms. In one of the major strands of number theory in the twentieth century, ways were found of avoiding some of the difficulties of a frontal attack with a naive idea of what sieving should be.

One successful approach is to approximate a specific sifted set of numbers (e.g. the set of prime numbers) by another, simpler set (e.g. the set of almost prime numbers), which is typically somewhat larger than the original set, and easier to analyze. More sophisticated sieves also do not work directly with sets &quot;per se&quot;, but instead count them according to carefully chosen weight functions on these sets (options for giving some elements of these sets more &quot;weight&quot; than others). Furthermore, in some modern applications, sieves are used not to estimate the size of a sifted
set, but to produce a function that is large on the set and mostly small outside it, while being easier to analyze than the characteristic function of the set.

The term &quot;sieve&quot; was first used by the Norwegian mathematician Viggo Brun in 1915. However Brun&#x27;s work was inspired by the works of the French mathematician Jean Merlin who died in the World War I and only two of his manuscripts survived. 
== Basic sieve theory ==
For information on notation see at the end. We follow the Ansatz from &quot;Opera de Cribro&quot; by John Friedlander and Henryk Iwaniec.

We start with some countable sequence of non-negative numbers formula_1. In the most basic case this sequence is just the indicator function formula_2 of some set formula_3 we want to sieve. However this abstraction allows for more general situations. Next we introduce a general set of prime numbers called the &quot;sifting range&quot; formula_4 and their product up to formula_5 as a function formula_6.

The goal of sieve theory is to estimate the &quot;sifting function&quot;
:formula_7
In the case of formula_2 this just counts the cardinality of a subset formula_9 of numbers, that are coprime to the prime factors of formula_10.

=== The inclusion–exclusion principle ===
For formula_11 define
:formula_12
and for each prime formula_13 denote the subset formula_14 of multiples formula_15 and let formula_16 be the cardinality.

We now introduce a way to calculate the cardinality of formula_17. For this the sifting range formula_11 will be a concrete example of primes of the form formula_19.

If one wants to calculate the cardinality of formula_17, one can apply the inclusion–exclusion principle. This algorithm works like this: first one removes from the cardinality of formula_21 the cardinality formula_22 and formula_23. Now since one has removed the numbers that are divisible by formula_24 and formula_25 twice, one has to add the cardinality formula_26. In the next step one removes formula_27 and adds formula_28 and formula_29 again. Additionally one has now to remove formula_30, i.e. the cardinality of all numbers divisible by formula_31 and formula_32. This leads to the inclusion–exclusion principle
:formula_33

Notice that one can write this as
:formula_34
where formula_35 is the Möbius function and formula_36 the product of all primes in formula_11 and formula_38.

=== Legendre&#x27;s identity ===
We can rewrite the sifting function with &quot;Legendre&#x27;s identity&quot;
:formula_39
by using the Möbius function and some functions formula_40 induced by the elements of formula_11
:formula_42
==== Example ====
Let formula_43 and formula_44. The Möbius function is negative for every prime, so we get
:formula_45

=== Approximation of the congruence sum ===
One assumes then that formula_40 can be written as
:formula_47
where formula_48 is a &quot;density&quot;, meaning a multiplicative function such that
:formula_49
and formula_50 is an approximation of formula_51 and formula_52 is some remainder term. The sifting function becomes
:formula_53
or in short
:formula_54
One tries then to estimate the sifting function by finding upper and lower bounds for formula_55 respectively formula_56 and formula_57.

The partial sum of the sifting function alternately over- and undercounts, so the remainder term will be huge. Brun&#x27;s idea to improve this was to replace formula_58 in the sifting function with a weight sequence formula_59 consisting of restricted Möbius functions. Choosing two appropriate sequences formula_60 and formula_61 and denoting the sifting functions with formula_62 and formula_63, one can get lower and upper bounds for the original sifting functions
:formula_64

Since formula_65 is multiplicative, one can also work with the identity
:formula_66

Notation: a word of caution regarding the notation, in the literature one often identifies the set of sequences formula_67 with the set formula_68 itself. This means one writes formula_69 to define a sequence formula_1. Also in the literature the sum formula_40 is sometimes notated as the cardinality formula_72 of some set formula_40, while we have defined formula_40 to be already the cardinality of this set. We used 
formula_75 to denote the set of primes and formula_76 for the greatest common divisor of formula_77 and formula_78.

== Types of sieving ==

Modern sieves include the Brun sieve, the Selberg sieve, the Turán sieve, the large sieve, the larger sieve and the Goldston–Pintz–Yıldırım sieve. One of the original purposes of sieve theory was to try to prove conjectures in number theory such as the twin prime conjecture. While the original broad aims of sieve theory still are largely unachieved, there have been some partial successes, especially in combination with other number theoretic tools. Highlights include:

# &quot;Brun&#x27;s theorem&quot;, which shows that the sum of the reciprocals of the twin primes converges (whereas the sum of the reciprocals of all primes diverges);
# &quot;Chen&#x27;s theorem&quot;, which shows that there are infinitely many primes &quot;p&quot; such that &quot;p&quot; + 2 is either a prime or a semiprime (the product of two primes); a closely related theorem of Chen Jingrun asserts that every sufficiently large even number is the sum of a prime and another number which is either a prime or a semiprime. These can be considered to be near-misses to the twin prime conjecture and the Goldbach conjecture respectively.
# The &quot;fundamental lemma of sieve theory&quot;, which asserts that if one is sifting a set of &quot;N&quot; numbers, then one can accurately estimate the number of elements left in the sieve after formula_79 iterations provided that formula_80 is sufficiently small (fractions such as 1/10 are quite typical here). This lemma is usually too weak to sieve out primes (which generally require something like formula_81 iterations), but can be enough to obtain results regarding almost primes.
# The &quot;Friedlander–Iwaniec theorem&quot;, which asserts that there are infinitely many primes of the form formula_82.
# Zhang&#x27;s theorem , which shows that there are infinitely many pairs of primes within a bounded distance. The Maynard–Tao theorem generalizes Zhang&#x27;s theorem to arbitrarily long sequences of primes.

== Techniques of sieve theory ==

The techniques of sieve theory can be quite powerful, but they seem to be limited by an obstacle known as the &quot;parity problem&quot;, which roughly speaking asserts that sieve theory methods have extreme difficulty distinguishing between numbers with an odd number of prime factors and numbers with an even number of prime factors. This parity problem is still not very well understood.

Compared with other methods in number theory, sieve theory is comparatively &quot;elementary&quot;, in the sense that it does not necessarily require sophisticated concepts from either algebraic number theory or analytic number theory. Nevertheless, the more advanced sieves can still get very intricate and delicate (especially when combined with other deep techniques in number theory), and entire textbooks have been devoted to this single subfield of number theory; a classic reference is and a more modern text is .

The sieve methods discussed in this article are not closely related to the integer factorization sieve methods such as the quadratic sieve and the general number field sieve. Those factorization methods use the idea of the sieve of Eratosthenes to determine efficiently which members of a list of numbers can be completely factored into small primes.

<text>Alfred Edward Woodley Mason (7 May 1865 – 22 November 1948) was an English author and Liberal Party Member of Parliament. He is best remembered for his 1902 novel of courage and cowardice in wartime, &quot;The Four Feathers&quot;, and is also known as the creator of Inspector Hanaud, a French detective who was an early template for Agatha Christie&#x27;s famous Hercule Poirot.

His prolific output in short stories and novels were frequently made and remade into films during his lifetime; though many of the silent versions have been lost or forgotten, the productions of &quot;Fire Over England&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Four Feathers&quot; (1939) remain enduring classics of British cinema.

== Life ==
Mason was born in Camberwell. He studied at Dulwich College and graduated from Trinity College, Oxford, in 1888. He was a contemporary of fellow Liberal Anthony Hope, who went on to write the adventure novel &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;. He was an actor before he became a writer, and took the role of Major Plechanoff in the premiere of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; in 1894. He was also an avid cricket player.

Arthur Quiller-Couch and Oscar Wilde encouraged him to write, and his first novel, &quot;A Romance of Wastdale&quot;, was published in 1895. He was the author of more than 30 books, including &quot;At The Villa Rose&quot; (1910), a mystery novel in which he introduced his French detective, Inspector Hanaud; Hanaud&#x27;s career in six novels spanned from before World War I to after World War II.

His best-known book is &quot;The Four Feathers&quot;, which has been made into several films (see below). Many consider it his masterpiece. Other books are &quot;The House of the Arrow&quot; (1924), &quot;No Other Tiger&quot; (1927), &quot;The Prisoner in the Opal&quot; (1929) and &quot;Fire Over England&quot; (1937). He contributed a short story, &quot;The Conjurer&quot;, to &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Book of the Red Cross&quot;.

Mason was elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Coventry in the 1906 general election. He served only a single term in Parliament, retiring at the next general election in January 1910.

His first play was the four-act comedy &quot;Marjory Strode&quot;. Mason wrote three plays that were produced and presented by Sir George Alexander in St James&#x27;s Theatre. He wrote, &quot;I had three plays produced by George Alexander; one a failure, &quot;Colonel Smith&quot;, one which made a moderate profit, &quot;Open Windows&quot;, and one which was a considerable success, &quot;The Witness for the Defence&quot;. The light farce &quot;Colonel Smith&quot; opened on 23 April 1909. &quot;The Witness for the Defence&quot; opened on 1 February 1911, starring Sir George Alexander as Henry Thresk. In 1913 Mason&#x27;s problem play &quot;Open Windows&quot; opened on the evening of 11 March, starring Sydney Valentine as &quot;Phillip Hammond&quot;, Irene Vanbrugh as &quot;Cynthia Herrick&quot;, Sir George Alexander as &quot;John Herrick&quot;, with Rosalie Toller as &quot;Elsie Herrick&quot;.

Mason served with the Manchester Regiment in the First World War, being commissioned captain in the 21st Battalion in December 1914. In 1915 he transferred to the 22nd Battalion and then to the General List (reservists). In March 1917 he was granted the temporary rank of major and in October he relinquished his Army commission and joined the Royal Marine Light Infantry with the rank of major. His military career included work in naval intelligence, serving in Spain and Mexico, where he set up counter-espionage networks on behalf of the British government.

Mason turned to non-fiction as well; he wrote a biography of Sir Francis Drake (1941), whose piratical exploits for the Queen figure in &quot;Fire Over England&quot;. He was working on a non-fiction book about Admiral Robert Blake when he died in 1948.

Mason had been offered a knighthood but reportedly declined it, declaring that such honours meant little to a childless man.

== Works ==
Mason&#x27;s prolific output included over 30 novels as well as plays, short stories and articles. Many of his novels were adapted for the screen, several multiples times. During the 1910s and 1920s he worked closely with many film directors of the silent era.

== Inspector Hanaud ==

In 1910, Mason undertook to create a fictional detective as different as possible from Sherlock Holmes, who had recently been resuscitated after his supposed death by Arthur Conan Doyle in 1903. Inspector Gabriel Hanaud was stout, not gaunt like Holmes; a professional policeman, not a gentleman amateur; from the French Sûreté, not Victorian England; and relying on psychological insights rather than physical evidence. His &quot;Watson&quot; is a retired London banker named Mr. Julius Ricardo.

Hanaud&#x27;s appearance in the 1910 novel &quot;At The Villa Rose&quot; marks &quot;the first major fiction detective of the Twentieth Century,&quot; according to a historian of the genre. Set in the south of France, its plot also ridicules spiritualism and mediums, well-known enthusiasms of A. Conan Doyle. 
Four more Hanaud novels and several short stories followed, the last, &quot;The House in Lordship Lane&quot;, in 1946 and the only one set in England. 
The first Hanaud book was a best-seller, as were several of Mason’s 30 novels, and as such often adapted into films, often more than once. A 1920 version of &quot;At the Villa Rose&quot; was a great success in British movie theatres that year, even as a play version of the novel simultaneously began a long run at the Strand. A successful silent version of &quot;The Four Feathers&quot; followed the next year.

The first sound version of &quot;At the Villa Rose&quot; was shot both in English and in French at Twickenham Studios in 1930, making it the first British bi-lingual production, released in America under the name &quot;The Mystery of the Villa Rose&quot;. This marked the film début of Austin Trevor, an actor from Northern Ireland, in the role of Mr. Ricardo. Trevor would go on to be the first actor to create Hercule Poirot on the screen. Veteran British director Walter Summers directed &quot;At the Villa Rose&quot;, aka &quot;House of Mystery&quot;, in 1940.

== Film adaptations ==

Mason&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Fire Over England&quot; (1936) was set in the 16th century as a beleaguered Elizabeth I of England prepares for invasion by a tyrannical Spain in the throes of the Inquisition. A thinly veiled metaphor for then-neutral Britain&#x27;s need to prepare for the threat of Nazi invasion, and published while the Spanish Civil War was raging, the book was adapted for film by the author Clemence Dane for Alexander Korda, England&#x27;s leading film producer; Korda was helping Winston Churchill in his struggle to alert the British people to the military threat of the Third Reich. The lavish costume drama also made stars of Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier in their first pairing as lovers onscreen, as they were off-screen.

Korda also produced &quot;The Four Feathers&quot; (1939), directed by his brother, Zoltan Korda. Filmed on location in the desert of Sudan, starring Ralph Richardson and John Clements; its technicolor cinematography was nominated for an Oscar. Released before Britain&#x27;s entry into World War II, its pro-British theme also features valiant British fighting against hopeless odds, this time in a late 19th century imperial setting.

Zoltan Korda directed a remake, the much less successful &quot;Storm Over the Nile&quot; (1955), starring Anthony Steel. Other film versions include three earlier silent films, from 1915, 1921 and 1929, a 1978 American television film with Beau Bridges in the lead role, and &quot;The Four Feathers&quot; (2002), starring Heath Ledger and Kate Hudson.

<text>The Cincinnati Museum Center is a museum complex operating out of the Cincinnati Union Terminal in the Queensgate neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio. It houses museums, theater, a library, and a symphonic pipe organ, as well as special traveling exhibitions.

==Museums==
The museum provides a home to five organizations:
* Cincinnati History Museum
* Museum of Natural History &amp; Science
* Robert D. Lindner Family Omnimax Theater
* Cincinnati History Library and Archives
* Duke Energy Children&#x27;s Museum

===Museum of Natural History &amp; Science=== 
The Museum of Natural History &amp; Science includes a space called Dinosaur Hall, featuring skeletons and fossils, including skeletons in the Galeamopus, Daspletosaurus, and Torvosaurus genera. The Torvosaurus skeleton, installed in 2018, is the most complete skeleton of the genus, at 55 percent complete, and the only Torvosaurus skeleton publicly exhibited.

The natural history museum also includes a reproduction of a limestone cave. The exhibit, titled &quot;The Cave&quot;, was first installed as &quot;The Cavern&quot; in the museum&#x27;s Gilbert Avenue location in 1967, ten years after the location opened. It was reinstalled in Union Terminal around 1994. It was designed to resemble Mammoth Cave National Park, the longest cave system in the world, in nearby Kentucky. Workers with extensive cave knowledge sculpted the cave from gunite. The exhibit has two levels and spans for 500 feet. It includes an underground stream and vertical cavities (dome pits), one of which is 40 feet high.
===Exhibits===
Holiday Junction is an annual rail-themed event at the museum center.

==History==
Beginning in the early 1980s, the Cincinnati Historical Society and Cincinnati Museum of Natural History were searching for larger spaces. Both had their origins in the early-mid 1800s, and the historical society was interested in creating a museum. The most favorable options in their studies were to join in occupying space in Union Terminal. In May 1986, the voters of the surrounding county approved $33 million in funding to transform the building into museum space. The state of Ohio provided $8 million, the city provided $3 million, while about 3,000 individuals, corporations, and foundations also donated to the effort. Talk show host and former Cincinnati mayor Jerry Springer was one of the major proponents of saving the building and transforming it into a museum. The terminal&#x27;s 200,000 square feet of underground space, then used as parking space, as well as its taxi and bus ramps, were renovated into exhibition space. The main concourse was restored, retail space was refurbished, and the theater was restored. The entrance to the train concourse was renovated into the Omnimax theater, and the men&#x27;s lounge became Amtrak&#x27;s waiting room and ticket counter.

In 1986, the Union Terminal Association (UTA) was created to facilitate long-term preservation of the terminal. The organization included community members and city and county officials. The UTA leased the building from the city and searched for tenants. The UTA joined the Historical Society and Museum of Natural History in creating the Heritage Center at Union Terminal.

The first exhibit shown in the terminal was &quot;U.S.S.R.: Individual, Family, Society&quot; in February 1988, in a cultural agreement between US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

The museum as a whole opened on November 10, 1990, though it had its &quot;grand opening day&quot; on November 2, 1991, with the two museum&#x27;s first permanent exhibits there. The original members of the museum center were the Cincinnati Historical Society Library, Cincinnati History Museum, Cincinnati Museum of Natural History, and the Robert D. Lindner Family Omnimax Theater. The museum center opened with the largest display of robotic dinosaurs, the largest World War II commemorative exhibit, and one of fourteen Omnimax theaters in the United States. Museum center officials were unsure if people would travel to the new museums as predicted, though the center became the fourth-largest attraction in the area, behind the Cincinnati Reds, Kings Island, and the Cincinnati Zoo. The renovations included the installation of the Grand E.M. Skinner Concert Organ. In 1995, the entities officially merged to create the Cincinnati Museum Center, also joined by the Cinergy Children&#x27;s Museum in October 1998.

In 2004, the county again approved an operating levy for the building&#x27;s operating costs and capital repairs. In 2009, the museum center began a project to restore the southwest wing of the terminal, including new roofing, masonry repairs, a new HVAC system, and restoration of four dining rooms on the south side of the terminal. In 2009, county residents approved an extension of the 2004 levy for further repairs.

From July 2016 until November 2018, the museum was shut down in order to complete a $228 million renovation throughout the entire building, in addition to restoring numerous rooms original to the building. The renovation was approved by Hamilton County voters through an increased sales tax, bringing $176 million, and was also funded by $5 million in state grants, $7.5 million in donations, and $39 million in federal historic tax credits. It was the first full renovation of the building, after two smaller renovations that made the Land of Oz shopping center and the Cincinnati Museum Center operable. Original plans called for leaving the Duke Energy Children&#x27;s Museum and the Cincinnati History Museum open, but it was decided to shutter the entire building after water damage proved to be more extensive than previously thought. During the closure, items located in the museum were stored in the Geier Center, the museum&#x27;s research and storage facility, and in various traveling exhibits across the country.

The building and museum center had their reopening ceremony on November 17, 2018. The terminal expanded its foodservice contract from 2014 for operation of three dining rooms on the main concourse, two on the lower level, a retail shop, and other rotating operations. The main level operation Cup and Pint now serves pizzas, coffee, and draft beer, while Nourish 513 serves sandwiches, salads, and fast food. The Rookwood Tea Room reopened as a Graeter&#x27;s location. In January 2019, the terminal gained another museum as a tenant, the Nancy &amp; David Wolf Holocaust and Humanity Center, in the former space of the History Library.

==Events==
One of the museum center&#x27;s largest events is its annual 1940s Day, a celebration of the decade, every year on the second weekend in August. The event includes a classic car show, swing dancing, big band music, and a vintage costume contest. The museum center began hosting 1940s-themed celebrations during its 75th anniversary celebration in 2008. It celebrates the 1940s, which was the peak passenger traffic period for Union Terminal, especially during World War II.

The museum center is also host to public speakers, including then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaking alongside 2020 candidate Elizabeth Warren in 2016. Mitt Romney held his first presidential rally there in 2012, while then-candidate Barack Obama held a discussion on healthcare in 2008. Presidential nominee John Kerry gave a speech in 2004. In 2002, sitting president George W. Bush made his case for declaring war with Iraq. Presidential nominee and former vice president Joe Biden gave a speech at the terminal in 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Beside speeches, vice president Dan Quayle visited the museum in 1991, and president Dwight D. Eisenhower was greeted by the public, prominent Republicans, and a band in 1952. President Harry S. Truman visited the terminal on five occasions between 1948 and 1952, and Franklin D. Roosevelt visited in 1936.

==Collection==
The museum center has a collection of materials relating to Union Terminal, including 14 of the architects&#x27; drawings of the terminal, the silver trowel used at the cornerstone laying in 1931, the gold key used by Cincinnati mayor Russell Wilson in dedicating the terminal in 1933, the dedication book published by the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce, a collection of Union Terminal and Western Hills viaduct photographs taken between 1929 and 1933, a collection of construction photographs, source photographs for the Winold Reiss murals that decorate Union Terminal, Cincinnati Union Terminal Company records for 1940-1963 and 1968–1972, menus from the restaurants housed at Union Terminal, and papers from Save the Terminal Inc.

===E.M. Skinner organ===

The Grand E.M. Skinner Concert Organ is a blend of two former instruments. The primary instrument was the Skinner Opus 660, which was installed at Immaculate Conception Roman Catholic Church in East Germantown, a neighborhood of Philadelphia. The other portion is an antiphonal division, originally a smaller organ (Skinner Opus 726) in Powel Crosley Jr.&#x27;s Cincinnati residence, Pinecroft. The Opus 660 portion speaks from hidden chambers behind grills on either side of the hallway and stairs, grills that formerly fronted the terminal&#x27;s ticket windows. The Opus 726 portion speaks from a chamber behind a window above the history museum entrance. Both instruments were built in 1929, when the station building began construction. The Skinner Opus 660 was sold to the museum center in 1987, which installed it during its 1990s renovations.

<doc id="1035922" wikidata="Q2189097" url="?curid=1035922" title="Bursting Out">
<text>Bursting Out is a 1978 live double album by the rock band Jethro Tull. The album was recorded during the band&#x27;s European Heavy Horses Tour in May/June of that year. 

==Background==

The exact date for every single song has not been made public, but the introduction by Claude Nobs, most of &quot;Flute Solo Improvisation&quot;, &quot;Too Old to Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll: Too Young to Die&quot;, &quot;Aqualung&quot;, &quot;Locomotive Breath&quot; and &quot;The Dambusters March&quot; were recorded at the Festhalle in Bern, Switzerland, on May 28, 1978. The Bern show was recorded on a 24-track tape recorder, while the rest of the shows were recorded on a TEAC TASCAM 80-8 eight-track recorder. Ian Anderson recalled going through &quot;hours and hours&quot; of recordings in order to select the best takes. Additional sweetening was done at Maison Rouge Studio in June 1978. 

==Release==

A spelling error on the spine of the first US, Canada, Spain and Sweden LP pressings listed the title as &quot;Busting Out&quot;.

The album was later re-released as a double-disc CD in the UK and Europe. The original CD release in the United States was only one disc, with three tracks (&quot;Quatrain&quot;, &quot;Sweet Dream&quot; and &quot;Conundrum&quot;) omitted and some of the stage banter shortened to fit the 80 minutes running length. The double-disc 1990 CD version in the UK and Europe incorporated the first track, the introductions, in the song that followed. In 2004, the complete album was remastered and released worldwide as a two-disc set, with the introductions as separate tracks. A deluxe remixed edition was released June 21, 2024, incorporating new mixes of the Bern tracks that had been missing on the original album (but were released, albeit mixed by Jakko Jakszyk, on the &quot;New Shoes Edition&quot; of &quot;Heavy Horses&quot;) for a complete representation of the live setlist, previously unreleased soundcheck recordings and a remix of the Live at Madison Square Garden show, the latter also including the filmed footage on DVD.

<text>The Laguna Mountains are a mountain range of the Peninsular Ranges in eastern San Diego County, California. The mountains run in a northwest/southeast alignment for approximately .

The mountains have long been inhabited by the indigenous Kumeyaay people.

==Geography==
The Laguna Mountains are bordered by the Cuyamaca Mountains area on the west and the Colorado Desert on the east, where the mountains form a steep escarpment along the Laguna Salada Fault. To the north the Laguna Mountains are bounded by the Elsinore Fault Zone and to the south by Cameron Valley and Thing Valley.

The highest point is Cuyapaipe Mountain at . The mountains are largely contained within Cleveland National Forest. Snow falls on the highest peaks several times a year. Mount Laguna is a village in the Laguna Mountains with a population of about 80.

The headwaters of three perennial streams begin in the Laguna Mountains: Noble Creek, Cottonwood Creek, and Kitchen Creek.

The Laguna Mountains extend northwest about from the Mexican border at the Sierra de Juárez range. 
The Sawtooth Range and In-Ko-Pah Mountains are adjacent to the east. The Santa Rosa Mountains lie further to the northeast. The Cuyamaca Mountains are adjacent along the west.

The southern section is in the Mountain Empire region of San Diego County, and the northern section is in the East County region.

==Recreation==
The Laguna Mountains are a popular recreation area in Cleveland National Forest. They comprise the southernmost crest along the Pacific Crest Trail.

Their relatively high altitude induces the highest snowfall in San Diego County making it one of the few local places to offer snow activities like sledding and snowshoeing.

<doc id="1035926" wikidata="Q7238822" url="?curid=1035926" title="Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra">
<text>The Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra (Sanskrit; ; Vietnamese: Kinh Bát Chu Tam Muội) is an early Mahayana Buddhist scripture, which probably originated between the 1st century BCE and 2nd century CE in the Gandhara area of northwestern India. The full title for this text is Pratyutpannabuddha Saṃmukhāvasthita Samādhi Sūtra, which translates to, &quot;Sūtra on the Samādhi for Encountering Face-to-Face the Buddhas of the Present&quot;.

The &quot;Pratyutpanna&quot; is a particularly important Mahayana sutra in East Asian Pure Land Buddhism and Tiantai (Jp: Tendai) Buddhism, since it contains key teachings on Buddha contemplation and Buddha recollection (nianfo). It is the main source for the Tiantai school&#x27;s &quot;constantly walking samadhi&quot; practice (taught in Zhiyi&#x27;s &quot;Mohe Zhiguan&quot;), also known as the pratyutpanna-samādhi (the meditative absorption of direct encounter [of the Buddhas]). The sutra was commented on and relied upon by numerous Chinese Pure Land masters, like Huiyuan, Shandao (613–681), Cimin Huiri, and Fazhao. 

==History==
The &quot;Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra&quot; was first translated into Chinese by the Kushan Buddhist monk Lokaksema in 179 CE, at the Han capital of Luoyang. This translation is, together with the &quot;Prajnaparamita Sutra&quot;, one of the earliest historically datable texts of the Mahayana tradition.

In 2018, the discovery of fragments of a birch bark manuscript in the Gāndhārī language and written in Kharoṣṭhī script was announced by scholars Paul Harrison, Timothy Lenz, and Richard Salomon, who wrote regarding the dating of the manuscript:

The post-script of the same paper notes that as the article went to press, scholar Mark Allon brought to the authors&#x27; attention &quot;another set of birch-bark fragments, possibly from the same scroll or set of scrolls, containing a large section of Chapter 9 of the PRaS&quot;, which the authors state will be included in a follow-up article in the future.

==Contents==
The &quot;Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra&quot; contains the first known mentions of the Buddha Amitābha and his pure land, said to be at the origin of Pure Land Buddhism in China:

==Pratyutpanna samadhi==

The full practice developed by Zhiyi is 90 days long. Lay practitioners often take a much shorter time. Any practice that exceeds one day requires a bystander called a dharma protector (護法) to look after the practitioner. The exercise includes constant walking or praying to Amitabha, sometimes accompanying or helped by the bystander. The practitioner should avoid sitting, laying, resting or sleeping during the period of practice. The bystander would warn the practitioner if he or she engages in prolonged resting. Very few Buddhists practice this. Shi Yinguang (印光) suggested that people should practice the much easier recitation of name of the Buddha nianfo instead. But some buddhists have said that they feel healthier after the practice.

<text>The Broadsword and the Beast is the 14th studio album by rock band Jethro Tull, released in April 1982 by Chrysalis Records. The album&#x27;s musical style features a cross between the dominant synthesizer sound of the 1980s and the folk-influenced style that Jethro Tull used in the previous decade. As such, the band&#x27;s characteristic acoustic instrumentation is augmented by electronic soundscapes. The electronic aspects of this album would be explored further by the band on their next album, &quot;Under Wraps&quot; (1984), as well as on Ian Anderson&#x27;s solo album &quot;Walk into Light&quot; (1983).

Paul Samwell-Smith produced the album, making &quot;The Broadsword and the Beast&quot; the first and only Jethro Tull album produced by an external producer outside of the band and their management. Early sessions for the album were produced by Keith Olsen. However, Olsen was dismissed amid creative differences in December 1981; he was not credited on the album. The album was the first Jethro Tull album to feature Peter-John Vettese on keyboards and Gerry Conway on drums.

==Background and recording==
After the conclusion of the &quot;A&quot; tour in late February 1981, Jethro Tull was in need of a new keyboardist and drummer, as keyboardist Eddie Jobson, who billed himself as a &quot;special guest&quot; when performing with Tull, and drummer Mark Craney had departed with the conclusion of the tour. Cat Stevens drummer Gerry Conway was recruited due to being a longtime acquaintance of the band as well as his connections to Fairport Convention, Tull bassist Dave Pegg&#x27;s band. Anderson, Barre, Pegg and Conway began recording sessions in March 1981 at Maison Rouge Studios with Anderson playing keyboards, recording until July when the band took a four-month break. While the sessions had produced several tracks, only two (&quot;Beastie&quot; and &quot;Watching Me, Watching You&quot;) would make it to the final album, with the rest cut as Anderson felt that &quot;overall they didn&#x27;t have a theme or a concept about them that was driving them towards a certain conclusion.&quot; In late summer, Peter-John Vettese was hired as the band&#x27;s new keyboardist after answering an ad for the position placed in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;.

Chrysalis Records had suggested that the band pursue working with an outside producer on their next album. Canadian producer Bob Ezrin, known for his work with Pink Floyd, Kiss and Alice Cooper, was initially selected, however after Ezrin had to pull out at the last minute, American producer Keith Olsen was selected. Recording resumed at Maison Rouge in November 1981 with the newly completed band and Olsen producing. The band quickly found Olsen&#x27;s working style clashing with theirs; while Anderson described Olsen as &quot;a nice enough chap&quot; he described his method of recording with no equalization or effects as &quot;a way of working that was completely alien to me&quot;. Other members of the band also found themselves in disagreement with Olsen, including Pegg who described Olsen&#x27;s selection as &quot;record company shite&quot;. The band were also disturbed that Olsen&#x27;s &quot;personal lifestyle choices were not those of the rest of us.&quot;

Former Yardbird Paul Samwell-Smith was ultimately brought in as a new producer for the album after a recommendation from Conway, who had previously worked with him in Cat Stevens&#x27; band. Samwell-Smith arrived in mid-December and the band recorded with him until the album was mastered in February 1982. Samwell-Smith, who described his role on the album as &quot;very much a case of looking to Ian to see what he wanted and then to help him do it&quot;, was praised by the band who found him easy to work with. The album was the last recorded by Tull at Maison Rouge, as Anderson sold it in 1983. 

The album was originally intended to be called &quot;Beastie&quot;, corresponding to the first track on side one. But during production, the band deliberated over the preference between &quot;Beastie&quot; and &quot;Broadsword&quot;, the first track on side two. In the end, they decided (as on &quot;Aqualung&quot;) to give each side its own title and thus its own identity, and this time to combine both in the album title.

==Artwork and packaging==
The cover art was illustrated by American artist Iain McCaig, a longtime fan of the band who later went on to work as a concept artist for successful film series including &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. McCaig was such a fan of the band that he cancelled a surprise trip to Paris where he planned to propose to his girlfriend so that he could get the job to design the cover. The art was made after McCaig visited Maison Rouge to meet the band and discuss the cover with Anderson, who gave McCaig a cassette of demos to listen to. McCaig has stated that he intentionally drew hidden &quot;easter eggs&quot; in the album art, including runes on the back cover which spell out the initials of McCaig&#x27;s brother. 

The edges of the front cover feature writing in Anglo-Saxon runes, which translate to the opening verse of the song &quot;Broadsword&quot;:

&quot;I see a dark sail on the horizon,
set under a black cloud that hides the sun.
Bring me my broadsword and clear understanding. 
Bring me my cross of gold as a talisman.&quot;
==Release==
In 1984, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab issued a half-speed mastered edition of the album (MFSL 1-092) which was a minor seller at the time.

The 2005 CD reissue of the album was heavily expanded to include eight bonus tracks recorded during the &quot;Broadsword&quot; sessions, but not included in the original 1982 album.

A greatly expanded, eight-disc (five CDs and three DVDs) re-release of the album titled &quot;The 40th Anniversary Monster Edition&quot; was released on September 1, 2023, featuring new stereo and surround remixes by Steven Wilson, additional demos and session recordings, plus a 1982 live concert. The re-release has been stated to be the last of the Steven Wilson anniversary box set series the band has released since 2011. 

==Live performance==

The tour for &quot;Broadsword&quot; was the last of the band&#x27;s to be exceedingly theatrical. It included the entire stage being decorated to look like a pirate ship, which Ian Anderson, as he said in the liner notes for the remastered CD, thought was &quot;very silly&quot;. Extensive notes on the production of the album and subsequent tour can be found at the official Jethro Tull website.

In a 1982 concert review, Chris Welch reported: &quot;Squire Anderson waved a huge broadsword dangerously near Martin&#x27;s nether extremities during songs from their latest album (&quot;The Broadsword And The Beast&quot;), and punted huge exploding balloons out into the audience. But it was the roar of the band as they got into their heaviest moments that ultimately captivated an audience who seemed evenly mixed between 14-year-old novice Tull freaks and silver-haired rock business veterans. [...] Tull have a vast library of music to perform. They could have played on for another two hours and the audience would have been with them, cheering all the way.&quot;

&quot;Cheerio&quot;, the final track of the original release, was for some years played as the final encore at Jethro Tull concerts.

==Critical reception==

The review by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; was ambiguous, calling the album tracks &quot;emotional pieces of composition depending on how much attention you are prepared to give&quot; but overall stated that &quot;If you&#x27;re a fan, buy it, it may have some pleasant surprises. If, like me, you&#x27;re not, borrow it from someone who is. You might be surprised too&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, in their two stars review stated: &quot;There&#x27;s nothing wrong with living in the past, perhaps. Indeed, Ian Anderson can make the wisdom of the ages seem preferable to the rootless philandering of the present day. But on &quot;The Broadsword and the Beast&quot;, the real beast may be Anderson&#x27;s penchant for ponderous sermonizing.&quot; Bruce Eder of AllMusic was not too impressed with the album. Recalling the production and the music overall, he stated that &quot;this time in the hands of ex-Yardbird Paul Samwell-Smith, is smoother, less heavy, and more thinly textured than their past work, and there are times most especially on &quot;Flying Colours&quot; where they could almost pass for the latter-day Moody Blues, something the band never would have permitted in earlier days&quot;.

Former Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett has stated that &quot;The Broadsword and the Beast&quot; is one of his favourite albums.

Overall sales for &quot;The Broadsword and the Beast&quot; were better than &quot;Stormwatch&quot; and &quot;A&quot;. The album charted at No. 14 in Germany and Norway, No. 19 in the United States and No. 27 in the UK, while the single &quot;Fallen On Hard Times&quot; was a modest hit, reaching No. 20 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart.

<text>The Cirrus Design Corporation, doing business as Cirrus Aircraft (formally Cirrus Design), is an aircraft design, manufacturing, maintenance and management company, as well as a provider of flight training services, that was founded in 1984 by Alan and Dale Klapmeier to produce the VK-30 homebuilt aircraft. The company is headquartered in Duluth, Minnesota, United States, with operational locations in six other states across the US including North Dakota, Tennessee (where its customer headquarters are based), Texas, Arizona, Florida and Michigan, and additional sales locations in France and the Netherlands. It is majority-owned by a subsidiary of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC).

Cirrus markets several versions of its three certificated single-engine light aircraft models: the SR20 (certified in 1998), SR22 (certified in 2000), and SR22T (certified in 2010). As of July 2024, the company had delivered 10,000 SR-aircraft in 25 years of production, and has been the world&#x27;s largest producer of piston-powered aircraft since 2013 and general aviation aircraft since 2022. It is currently the third-largest aviation manufacturer in the world overall.

Sales of the SR-series grew rapidly during the 2000s, until the economic crisis of 2008. Cirrus was planning to market a light-sport aircraft called the SR Sport, but suspended the project in 2009 due to financial challenges and a lack of market demand. This has since been cancelled. After a return to company growth and United States–based expansion in the 2010s, Cirrus certified and began deliveries of the Vision SF50 very light jet in 2016. Upon its delivery, the aircraft became the first civilian single-engined jet to enter the market, and is often referred to as a &quot;personal jet&quot;.

The company produces all of its aircraft with composite materials and is known for pioneering new technologies in the light general aviation aircraft manufacturing industry, including glass cockpits and full-airframe ballistic parachutes.

In 2001, Cirrus sold a majority of the company to Bahrain-based Arcapita. Ten years later, the manufacturer was acquired by China Aviation Industry General Aircraft (CAIGA), which is a division of the Chinese state-owned AVIC. In 2024, it became a minority publicly-owned company as a component of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

==History==
===1980s===

In the early 1980s, while still in college, brothers Alan and Dale Klapmeier began making drawings and building foam models of the Cirrus VK-30. By 1984, they founded the Cirrus Design Company and along with spouses Jeff and Sally Viken, started developing the VK-30 as a kit aircraft project in the basement of the Klapmeier family&#x27;s barn in rural Baraboo, Wisconsin. After a few years in the design phase, the brothers borrowed money to construct their own hangars on the Baraboo–Wisconsin Dells Airport, where they began flight testing. The VK-30 was introduced at the 1987 EAA Oshkosh Convention and first flew on 11 February 1988. Kit deliveries commenced shortly thereafter.

===1990s===

Cirrus began designing the ST-50 under contract to Israeli aircraft manufacturer IsrAviation in the early 1990s. The aircraft was configured like the Cirrus VK-30 but powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6-135 turboprop engine, in place of the piston engine used in the VK-30. The prototype was first flown on 7 December 1994 by Norman E. Howell. Earlier that year, the Klapmeier brothers moved company headquarters from southern Wisconsin to a much larger facility at the Duluth International Airport in Duluth, Minnesota, bringing 35 employees with them and hiring another 15 at once.

In August 1996, Cirrus announced plans to build a plant at the Grand Forks International Airport in Grand Forks, North Dakota.

By the middle of the decade the company had discontinued the VK-30 and began development of the Cirrus SR20, which was first flown on 21 March 1995 and type certified on 23 October 1998. This was followed by customer deliveries of the SR20 beginning in July 1999.

===2000s===

In June 2000, the company received an FAA Production Certificate for its SR20 aircraft. On 30 November of that year, Cirrus received a type certificate for its next model, the Cirrus SR22, which began deliveries in 2001.

In August 2001, Cirrus sold 58% of the company for $100 million to Crescent Capital, the U.S. arm of the First Islamic Investment Bank of Bahrain (now called Arcapita).

In July 2002, the company announced that it would collaborate with the University of North Dakota Aerospace Foundation to provide a new Cirrus Customer Training program. In February the following year, Cirrus delivered the industry&#x27;s first-ever all glass cockpit light aircraft, sparking a major transition in general aviation, whereby over 90% of all new light aircraft by the year 2006 were equipped with glass cockpits.
In June 2004, Cirrus received type certification for the SR20 from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). That same year, Cirrus accomplished record-breaking sales, up 69% over the previous year. The SR22 became the world&#x27;s best-selling general aviation aircraft.

Cirrus entered the civilian flight-training fleet market with SR20 deliveries to Sweden&#x27;s Lund University in January 2005, followed by Western Michigan University in September of that year.

In 2006, the company delivered 721 aircraft (at the time its most in a single year), celebrating the 3,000th SR-series airplane off the production line only seven years after deliveries commenced, something that no other aviation company had accomplished in the last half-century. That summer, Cirrus acquired a 25-percent stake in SATSair, a 2004 start-up air taxi operator that flew 26 SR22s. SATSair ceased operations on 24 October 2009.
On 28 June 2007 the Cirrus Vision SF50 single-engine light jet was unveiled (then known simply as &quot;The-Jet&quot;). At the 2007 EAA AirVenture Oshkosh airshow, the company unveiled the Cirrus SRS light sport aircraft. A version of the B&amp;F Fk14 Polaris, the type never entered production for Cirrus. In December 2007 Arcapita stated that it was looking to sell its share of the company. Cirrus indicated at the time of the announcement that this was expected as Arcapita was considered a medium-term investor.

The Jet took its first flight on 3 July 2008. In September 2008, the global sale slump in piston-engined aircraft impacted the company and it laid off 100 workers, or 8% of its workforce. This included 79 people at the main plant in Duluth, Minnesota and 29 employees at the composite construction plant in Grand Forks, North Dakota. After this round of lay-offs Cirrus had 1,230 employees remaining. Company COO Brent Wouters stated that the lay-offs were due to &quot;not selling as many airplanes as we&#x27;d hoped to this year.&quot;
Company CEO Alan Klapmeier announced in October 2008 that due to the economic situation and resulting lack of demand for Cirrus aircraft, the company was moving to a three-day work week. He reported that sales were down 10% over the same period in the previous year. Compared to the industry average in that same period sales were down 16%. Klapmeier also indicated that introduction of the SRS would be delayed until 2009, due to lack of demand in the light-sport aircraft market sector, but that the Cirrus Vision SF50 jet would not be delayed.

Cirrus eliminated 208 employee positions in the fall of 2008 and cut aircraft production from 14 to 12 aircraft per week in response to the economic situation. In November 2008, the company announced that it would lay-off about 500 production employees for one month to allow for reductions in excess stock of aircraft produced. Between December 2008 and January 2009, the company began the process of changing its name from Cirrus Design to Cirrus Aircraft.

Cirrus started recalling its workers on 5 January 2009 after the month-long shutdown. The furloughed workers were called back slowly over the month, to ramp up production to eight aircraft per week, compared to a company capacity of 16 aircraft per week. The company indicated at that time that it would retain the ability to reduce its workforce quickly as the economic situation and sales numbers dictate.

On 9 January 2009, Cirrus announced that it would lay off 50 administrative employees and extend the layoff period for 100 of the 500 employees laid off over Christmas 2008. Company spokesman Bill King stated that the cuts were necessary or else the company would not survive the current economic crisis.

In early February 2009, the company&#x27;s new CEO, Brent Wouters, indicated that the future of the company would likely hinge on the Vision SF50 jet design as production of the piston single-engine SR-series had fallen to 20% of its 2008 rate of 16 aircraft per week. Wouters characterized demand for new aircraft as &quot;awful&quot; and added, &quot;We are increasing our focus on the jet, because that is going to be our future engine for growth in my estimation.&quot;

In April 2009, the company announced that it was suspending the Cirrus SRS light sport aircraft project. It cited economic conditions, that the aircraft required development, an expanded flight-training strategy and that the LSA rules were expected to change over time to allow LSAs with a broader mission profile.

On 29 April 2009, the company announced that it was increasing production from the previous 3-4 aircraft per week back to 6 aircraft per week. The change was accomplished without recalling any laid-off workers. The company stated: &quot;We continue to see very encouraging trends in sales activities and interest from sales prospects domestically and around the world. Clearly, this is an upward move and is indicative of a stronger bias toward growth in aircraft orders. Though we remain in a very challenging environment, our hope is that this new rate is the first step and initial indicator of what will become a more substantial trend into the second half of the year and beyond.&quot;

On 1 June 2009, the company announced it was recalling 50 workers and boosting production to 8 aircraft per week.

The company stated:

On 26 June 2009, it was reported by AvWeb that Cirrus co-founder and former CEO Alan Klapmeier intended to buy the Vision SF50 project from Cirrus and its major shareholder Arcapita and produce the aircraft under a new company. The new venture had been receiving financial advice from Merrill Lynch. Klapmeier indicated that his reason for wanting to take over the project was to speed up development and get the aircraft on the market sooner. Cirrus CEO Brent Wouters indicated that while the company intended to proceed with the SF50 program itself, he would listen to Klapmeier&#x27;s proposal. On Monday 27 July 2009 Wouters and Cirrus co-founder Dale Klapmeier stated at a press conference that they would find a way to produce the SF50, either at Cirrus or through selling it to Alan Klapmeier. They both said that the key factor was raising enough capital to proceed with the project, complete certification and commence production. On Friday 31 July 2009 Alan Klapmeier announced that his offer to buy the SF50 program had not succeeded, with the key issue having been the program selling price, as well as other points and that the negotiations were at an end. Wouters responded saying further talks were possible, but that Cirrus would continue to develop the SF50 in house.

In late August 2009, Cirrus announced that it was laying off 85 employees, mostly office workers. Todd Simmons, vice president of marketing, stated: &quot;These are challenging days for Cirrus, but the decision made is in the best interest in the entire company. Our outlook is still positive. We are making forward progress within the industry.&quot;

In November 2009, the company laid off an additional 58 workers, or 10% of the remaining payroll. The company indicated that it had failed to achieve some &quot;institutional sales of aircraft&quot; and that meant the lay-offs were expected, emphasizing that it does not indicate deeper problems with the company. As of 11 November 2009, the company had about 550 production workers employed.

===2010s===
In March 2010, Cirrus went to court in an attempt to get an order to prevent former supplier L-3 Communications from telling other Cirrus suppliers that Cirrus was heading into bankruptcy and from discouraging companies from doing business with Cirrus. On 1 April 2010, Cirrus applied for a &quot;voluntary dismissal&quot; of the case against L3, before L3 had filed a response. L3 had been engaged in a lawsuit against Cirrus for non-payment of US$18.7M in development costs for flat panel electronics, with Cirrus countering that L3 did not abide by the contract terms.

In June 2010, the company began paying back-rent owed to the city of Grand Forks. Cirrus had stopped paying its rent 16 months earlier. It also owed the city of Duluth back rent, which the city has indicated would be forgiven in exchange for job creation.

In February 2011, Cirrus was sold for US$210M to China Aviation Industry General Aircraft (CAIGA), a subsidiary of Aviation Industry Corporation, which is wholly owned by the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The announcement of the sale was met with mixed responses. The &quot;Duluth News-Tribune&quot; labelled it &quot;a sinking feeling of impending loss&quot;, while Russ Niles of &quot;AvWeb&quot; said &quot;Chinese participation in the aviation industry isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing and the folks in Duluth and Grand Forks could have suffered a worse fate. In the absence of a sale, bankruptcy was a real possibility for Cirrus and it might have been hard for a trustee to justify operating the business with the numbers it was showing. As for where it leaves current Cirrus owners and those thinking of buying one, the sale is probably a positive thing.&quot;

In mid-March 2011, aviation industry analyst Brian Foley indicated that he was trying to organize a group of US investors to make a counter-offer to the Chinese buy-out to keep Cirrus as a US-owned company. Foley stated that he had seen an &quot;overwhelming response&quot; from the U.S. aviation community, indicating that Americans want Cirrus &quot;to be owned and operated on American soil, period.&quot; Foley&#x27;s counter-offer did not materialize.

In late March 2011, freshman Minnesota congressman Chip Cravaack urged the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to exercise &quot;extreme caution&quot; over allowing the sale of Cirrus to the Chinese government, indicating that he was concerned that company technology would be used for Chinese military programs. Cirrus spokesman Todd Simmons responded to the congressman&#x27;s remarks with surprise, responding that, &quot;the CAIGA transaction is an investment in Duluth and our local communities.&quot; On 30 March 2011, at the Sun &#x27;n Fun airshow, company co-founder Dale Klapmeier provided reassurances that Chinese ownership would not result in production being moved out of the US. Klapmeier also expressed disappointment in the political issues raised, particularly by Cravaack. Klapmeier explained, &quot;His concerns are unfounded,&quot; detailing that Cirrus did not have any unique technology that could be employed in military applications. Former 18-term Minnesota Congressman Jim Oberstar also came out in support of Cirrus and the acquisition, saying Cravaack was &quot;undermining&quot; the situation, and that &quot;we have nothing to fear from an investment such as this by the Chinese.&quot;

The sale was reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and was approved, as Cirrus has no national security-sensitive trade secrets. The sale to CAIGA was completed as a merger of the two companies on 28 June 2011.

In July 2011, CAIGA president Xiangkai Meng and Duluth Mayor Don Ness signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding that the jobs at Cirrus would remain in Duluth and not be moved to China. Ness said &quot;Verbal assurances are wonderful, but a written assurance, signed by the president of CAIGA, certainly carries much more weight.&quot;

Following the company&#x27;s merger with CAIGA in July 2011, company CEO Brent Wouters indicated that Cirrus would move quickly to expand its line of aircraft, including bringing the Vision SF50 jet to market. Wouters said &quot;We need to expand our product line -- bigger, smaller, faster airplanes, a much broader range, and very quickly. And we need more penetration in the top 10 foreign markets. And we must go forward quickly on both avenues.&quot;

On the first anniversary of Chinese government ownership in 2012, company CEO Dale Klapmeier indicated that Cirrus was financially in a much better position and progress was being made with certifying the Vision SF-50 jet.

In March 2013, the company was granted a loan for US$950,000 from the city of Grand Forks, North Dakota to purchase an autoclave for composite production at the company&#x27;s Grand Forks facility. The loan was originally turned down by the city, questioning whether the company would ever repay it. The loan was later allowed and an apology issued.

In July 2013, Cirrus president and COO Pat Waddick indicated that the ongoing Chinese government investment would allow it to continue to develop new models of aircraft with innovative powerplants. CEO Dale Klapmeier stated that the company hopes to eventually establish additional aircraft manufacturing facilities in China.

In 2013 the company delivered 276 new aircraft. This was a 10 percent increase in the number of deliveries over 2012 and the company&#x27;s best year since before the 2008 recession. In 2013 the SR22 and SR22T were the highest-selling general aviation fixed-wing aircraft in the world and had been for eleven years in a row. Cirrus passed Textron Aviation as the largest producer of piston aircraft by unit-volume in 2013, and has remained the largest ever since.

On 25 March 2014 the company&#x27;s first conforming Vision SF50 jet flew. Cirrus also indicated that it was continuing to hire engineers, technicians and designers for the jet program. From 2011 to 2014 Cirrus hired more than 300 new workers, bringing the total number of employees to over 800.

In May 2015, Dale Klapmeier announced plans for the company to expand to the McGhee Tyson Airport in Knoxville, Tennessee and establish a customer delivery center there, which officially opened on 12 January 2017 with a focus on aircraft maintenance and support, design personalization, fixed base operations (FBO), flight training and more.

On 28 October 2016, Cirrus received FAA type certification for the Vision SF50 very light jet, with deliveries beginning in December of that year in the company&#x27;s new Duluth aircraft finishing facility.

In April 2018, the company was named the 2017 winner of the Collier Trophy for the &quot;greatest achievement in aeronautics or astronautics in America&quot; in the past year. The trophy was awarded for &quot;designing, certifying, and entering-into-service the Vision Jet — the world&#x27;s first single-engine general aviation personal jet aircraft with a whole airframe parachute system&quot;.

By the end of 2019, Cirrus employed 1,600 people and produced 81 Vision Jets and 384 SR-series aircraft that year, resulting in the company&#x27;s fifth year of growth and its best year in sales. The Vision SF50 became the world&#x27;s best-selling general aviation jet.

===2020s===
The company has continued to rapidly grow and expand into the 2020s, adding a thousand jobs from 2021 to 2023, growing its operational footprint with several new facilities in U.S. states such as Texas, Arizona, Florida and Michigan, as well as European countries like France and the Netherlands, and seeing an increase in demand since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2022, Cirrus sold 539 SR-aircraft (almost 40% of the entire piston market) and 90 Vision Jets, totaling 629 deliveries, the most since 2007 and nearly $1 billion in total revenue. It also became the largest single producer of general aviation aircraft in 2022 for the first time in the manufacturer&#x27;s history. It continued this trend in 2023, with SR shipments accounting for over 50 percent of the worldwide piston market, more than twice the output of any competitor.

Since the start of the pandemic, the company has experienced supply chain problems resulting in a backlog of almost 700 SR aircraft (as of March 2022) or nearly two years (as of January 2023). It has also faced challenges from the FAA with two separate airworthiness directives dealing with its Continental piston engines and SR power levers, as well as a company service bulletin dealing with its firing mechanisms for the primer material that ignites the parachute rocket on some SR and Vision Jet aircraft.

Cirrus has helped lead sustainable efforts in the general aviation industry, becoming one of the first OEMs to conduct tests of unleaded fuel in SR22/22Ts and continuing tests of G100UL as part of a program to move towards full unleaded fuels, along with being an early adopter of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the Vision Jet&#x27;s Williams FJ33 engine.

In June 2023, Cirrus filed an application for an initial public offering (IPO) on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange with the aim of raising around US$300 million for expansion and selling up to 20% of the company. The Chinese government-owned manufacturer does not plan to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and thus will not be offering shares to Americans during the IPO, although U.S. investors may be able to buy stock in Cirrus following the IPO. The company ultimately raised HK$1.4 billion in net proceeds, or about US$180 million, and began trading in Hong Kong on Friday, July 12, 2024. In February of that year, the company rebranded to highlight its broadened focus from manufacturing to &quot;flight training, product services and support, aircraft management, upgrades and accessories, sales, finance, insurance, and more”, with CEO Zean Nielsen saying, &quot;Cirrus continues its legacy of delivering innovative products and services that make aircraft ownership easy and synonymous with premium car ownership... The new brand identity honors Cirrus’ history while positioning itself for the future where the company will leverage its intelligent aircraft and connected digital ecosystem.”

In 2024, Cirrus delivered 731 aircraft, its most in a single year to date (topping its 2006 record of 721) and totaling over $1 billion in revenue.

==Facilities==

Cirrus Aircraft has several operational facilities throughout the United States and Europe.

The company&#x27;s first headquarters was located in Baraboo, Wisconsin. Since 1994, its headquarters and main manufacturing facilities have been in Duluth, Minnesota. An additional manufacturing facility, which opened in 1997 and produces the composite components for the planes, is located in Grand Forks, North Dakota. The Grand Forks facility was owned by the city of Grand Forks and leased to the company for many years up until November 2020, when Cirrus purchased it for US$1.9M. In the fall of 2002, Cirrus opened an &quot;aviation incubator&quot; building adjacent to its Duluth headquarters, which it was preparing to buy from the city for US$3.45M in April 2023.

On 27 December 2007, the company secured a lease for a hangar formerly owned by Northwest Airlines (who opened the facility in 1996 and closed it in 2005) at Duluth International Airport. The building was to be used for construction of its new Cirrus Jet. Cirrus canceled the lease in 2009 during the height of the Great Recession. In February 2022, Minnesota&#x27;s St. Louis County approved plans for the company to expand back into the building (formerly used by AAR Corp. from 2012 to 2020) as it ramps up production, with the city of Duluth selling it to Cirrus in September of that year for just $1 in exchange for 80 additional jobs at an hourly rate of at least $36.05. Cirrus invested US$20M into the facility as its flagship &quot;Innovation Center&quot; to support engineering, design, testing, product development and other technical operations by the company. It opened on 26 September 2023.

In February 2015, Duluth agreed to put up US$6M and asked the state contribute the remaining US$4M to build a US$10M factory on the Duluth Airport dedicated to the production of SF50s. The city would then try to recoup its costs for the facility from lease payments by Cirrus over time. The space opened on 19 December 2016, and was expanded on 15 July 2022.

On 6 May 2015, Cirrus announced that it will establish a new facility campus called the &quot;Vision Center&quot; in Knoxville, Tennessee on the city&#x27;s McGhee Tyson Airport. The facility will focus on all customer interactions and aircraft service including training (with a full level-D flight simulator), maintenance &amp; repair, personalization, and deliveries for both the Vision Jet and SR-series. The center opened on 12 January 2017. All manufacturing operations were said to remain in Duluth and Grand Forks.

In May 2019, the company announced that it will open its first factory-direct satellite service facility outside of Knoxville, at McKinney National Airport near Dallas, Texas, where it will expand its flight training, maintenance, and aircraft management operations.

In February 2020, Cirrus announced plans to establish a new engineering and design center in the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area, unveiled in September 2021 to be an Innovation Center located in the city of Chandler. Also in September, the company announced plans to open another Cirrus Innovation Center in McKinney, Texas, and expand its flight training services to a facility on the Scottsdale Airport in Scottsdale, Arizona. Later that same month, Cirrus Orlando was introduced, with two new training and service locations in Central Florida at the Kissimmee Gateway Airport in Kissimmee, Florida and Orlando Executive Airport in Orlando, Florida.

In February 2022, Cirrus announced that it had acquired the assets of Benton Harbor, Michigan–based Flying Colors Aviation, Inc., to expand the current facility there and increase its paint production capabilities, and in April announced the opening of both Cirrus France and Cirrus Rotterdam, two regional sales offices located in Valenciennes, France and Rotterdam, Netherlands, that will also support existing Cirrus training and service centers across Europe.

In May 2023, the company started construction of a addition to its existing facility at the McKinney National Airport at a cost of US$13 million, with the airport, city of McKinney and McKinney Economic Development Corporation contributing funds. The new construction will provide space for aircraft sales, flight training, factory service and aircraft management. It will also include a maintenance hangar, storage hangar, eight shade hangars, a flight simulator room, retail store and customer lounge area.

==Management==
From 1984, co-founder Alan Klapmeier served as president until January 2006 and chief executive officer (CEO) until February 2009, while co-founder Dale Klapmeier led the company&#x27;s design, testing and production and served as executive vice president until January 2006.

On 19 January 2006, Cirrus and the Klapmeier brothers announced that chief operating officer (COO) David Coleal had been named president.

On 18 December 2008, the company made public that COO Brent Wouters would be appointed president and CEO effective 1 February 2009. David Coleal was no longer with the company and Alan Klapmeier continued as chairman of the board, with Dale Klapmeier as vice-chairman.

On 1 August 2009, Cirrus Aircraft CEO Brent Wouters announced that Alan Klapmeier&#x27;s contract as chairman would not be renewed when it expired at the end of that month. Alan left Cirrus on 21 August 2009 and Dale became interim chairman the following month.

On 19 September 2011, the company announced that Dale Klapmeier has been named CEO and that Brent Wouters, previously president and CEO, is no longer with the company.
On 12 March 2013, early Cirrus employee Patrick Waddick, who originally became hired as an intern by the Klapmeier brothers in 1988 to sweep floors for the company, was named president, adding this to his COO position.

On 6 May 2015, Cirrus reported that chief customer officer (CCO) Todd Simmons will lead the new Vision Center in Knoxville, Tennessee, where all customer activities and operations for the company will take place.

On 19 December 2018, it was announced that Dale Klapmeier will step down as CEO sometime in the first half of 2019, and transition into a senior advisory role for the company. During that time, Cirrus will conduct an internal and external search for a new CEO.

On 4 June 2019, Cirrus announced that former Tesla Inc., James Hardie and Bang &amp; Olufsen executive Zean Nielsen has been selected as its next CEO, marking the first time in the company&#x27;s 35-year history without a Klapmeier at the helm.

==Products==

===SR aircraft series===
The Cirrus SR (Single Reciprocating) Series aircraft (including the SRV, SR20, SR22 and SR22T) are produced with &quot;Cirrus Perspective&quot; by Garmin (and previously Avidyne Entegra) integrated digital flight displays and modern avionics as standard equipment since 2008, a first in the light general aviation (GA) manufacturing industry when the Entegra instrument panel became available on the series starting in 2003. The aircraft are all electric - no vacuum systems are used. Redundancy is provided by dual batteries and alternators. The series originally began as a four-seat aircraft, with a smaller fifth seat added in 2013. The SR22 is also available with TKS anti-icing equipment, which has enabled flight into known icing (FIKI) conditions since 2009. The SR aircraft series was the first of its kind to come equipped with flight envelope protection in the form of an electronic &quot;level&quot; button, as well as &quot;airbag seatbelts&quot;, two airbags installed in the shoulder harnesses of both the pilot and co-pilots&#x27; seat belts.

The series incorporates other unusual design elements. All SR-aircraft use a mechanical side yoke instead of the traditional yoke or stick flight controls, and a single power lever that adjusts both throttle and propeller RPM via a mechanical cam actuated throttle and propeller control system. The aircraft also include a leading-edge cuff on the wing for improved spin protection and 26G energy-absorbing seats for improved crashworthiness. Construction is dominated by composite materials (a technique the company has used with every model since its first design in 1988, the VK-30), with traditional aluminum being used only for flight control surfaces. Although not the first certified GA aircraft built with composites, the SR-series was the first composite aircraft produced in large numbers (over 4,000 units delivered from 1999 to 2008 alone). 

The SR22T, introduced in 2010, is powered by a Continental TSIO-550-K turbocharged piston engine. Turbocharging allows the engine to maintain maximum power at higher altitudes while increasing the maximum operating altitude to .

===Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS)===

SR-series aircraft are equipped with the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS), developed in association with Ballistic Recovery Systems (BRS), a ballistic parachute deployed from the back of the aircraft. In many inflight emergencies, it allows the entire airplane to descend safely to the ground and has been credited with saving over 250 lives to date. Cirrus was the first manufacturer to receive FAA certification for production aircraft with ballistic parachute systems, and remains the only aviation company to implement the device as a standard equipment on all its models. The Klapmeier brothers decided to make CAPS standard after Alan survived a deadly mid-air collision in 1985, which inspired them to develop a new safety system for future Cirrus models that would give the pilot and passengers a way out in the worst-case scenario. It was first tested in 1998 by Air National Guard F-16 pilot and chief Cirrus test pilot Scott D. Anderson, who completed all CAPS testing that year in an SR20 prototype over the southern California desert.

The turbofan-powered Vision SF50 also comes equipped with CAPS, making it the first jet with a whole-plane parachute to receive certification.

===Safe Return autoland system===
In October 2019, Cirrus became the first GA company, along with Piper Aircraft, to announce an emergency autoland system, developed by Garmin, which Cirrus calls &quot;Safe Return&quot; on the Vision SF50. It initiates at the push of a button and allows landing on runways over 5,836 ft (1,779 m) without any human input. The SF50 became the first jet, and third GA aircraft, to become certified with the system, earning certification in August 2020. In June 2021, Garmin won the Collier Trophy for its development of autoland, an award Cirrus had been honored with three years prior for the SF50, as the first certified single-engine civilian jet.

<text>The Balinese people (, ) are an Austronesian ethnic group native to the Indonesian island of Bali. The Balinese population of 4.2 million (1.7% of Indonesia&#x27;s population) live mostly on the island of Bali, making up 89% of the island&#x27;s population. There are also significant populations on the island of Lombok and in the easternmost regions of Java (e.g. the regency of Banyuwangi). The Balinese are distinctive amongst Indonesian ethnic groups for their adherence to Balinese Hinduism rather than Sunni Islam.
==Origins==

The Balinese originated from three periods of migration. The first waves of immigrants came from Java and Kalimantan in prehistoric times and were of Proto-Malay stock. The second wave of Balinese came slowly over the years from Java during the Hindu period. The third and final wave came from Java, between the 15th and 16th centuries, about the same time as the conversion to Islam in Java, causing aristocrats and peasants to flee to Bali after the collapse of the Javanese Hindu Majapahit Empire to escape Mataram&#x27;s Islamic conversion. This in turn reshaped the Balinese culture into a syncretic form of classical Javanese culture mixed with many Balinese elements.

==Genetics==
A DNA study in 2005 by Karafet et al., found that 11% of Balinese Y-chromosomes are of likely Austroasiatic origin, while 84% are of likely Austronesian 1% of likely Indian origin and 2% of likely Melanesian origin. According to a recent genetic study, Balinese, together with Javanese and Sundanese, has a significant admixture of Austroasiatic and Austronesian ancestries. 
==Culture==

Balinese culture is a mix of Balinese Hindu-Buddhist religion and Balinese customs. It is perhaps most known for its dance, drama, and sculpture. The island is also known for its Wayang Kulit or Shadow play theatre. Even in rural and neglected villages, beautiful temples are a common sight; and so are skilful gamelan players and talented actors. Even layered pieces of palm leaf and neat fruit arrangements made as offerings by Balinese women have an artistic side to them. According to Mexican art historian José Miguel Covarrubias, works of art made by amateur Balinese artists are regarded as a form of spiritual offering, and therefore these artists do not care about recognition of their works. Balinese artists are also skilled in duplicating artworks such as carvings that resemble Chinese deities or decorating vehicles based on what is seen in foreign magazines.

The culture is noted for its use of the gamelan in music and various traditional events of Balinese society. Each type of music is designated for a specific type of event. For example, music for a &quot;piodalan&quot; (birthday celebration) is different from music used for a &quot;metatah&quot; (teeth grinding) ceremony, just as it is for weddings, &quot;Ngaben&quot; (cremation of the dead ceremony), &quot;Melasti&quot; (purification ritual), and so forth. The diverse types of gamelan are also specified according to the different types of dance in Bali. According to Walter Spies, the art of dancing is an integral part of Balinese life as well as an endless critical element in a series of ceremonies or for personal interests.

Traditionally, displaying female breasts is not considered immodest. Balinese women can often be seen with bared chests; however, a display of the thigh is considered immodest. In modern Bali, these customs are normally not strictly observed, but visitors to Balinese temples are advised to cover their legs.

In the Balinese naming system, a person&#x27;s rank of birth or caste is reflected in the name. Balinese are generally patrilineal, but in the case where a family only has daughters, they can decide if a daughter is the confirmed heir (&quot;sentana rajeg&quot;). She will then have the same status as if she were a son. The marriage proposal will be carried in reverse; she will be considered the husband (&quot;meawak muani&quot;) and he the wife (&quot;meawak luh&quot;), and the children are considered to be part of their mother&#x27;s family.


===Puputan===

A puputan is an act of mass suicide through frontal assaults in battle and was first noted by the Dutch during the colonization of Bali. The latest act of puputan was during the Indonesian War of Independence, with Lt. Colonel I Gusti Ngurah Rai as the leader in the Battle of Margarana. The airport in Bali is named after him in commemoration.

==Religion==


The vast majority of the Balinese believe in &quot;Agama Tirta&quot;, the &quot;holy-water religion&quot;. It is a part of Hinduism. Traveling Indian priests are said to have introduced the people to the sacred literature of Hinduism and Buddhism centuries ago. The people accepted it and combined it with their pre-Hindu mythologies. The Balinese from before the third wave of immigration, known as the Bali Aga, are mostly not followers of Agama Tirta but retain their animist traditions.

Wet rice agriculture is a mainstay of Balinese food production. This system of agriculture is extremely water-intensive and requires a substantial network of irrigation to be effective as a subsistence strategy in Bali. A system of irrigation networks (&quot;subak&quot;) exists to redistribute access to water in Bali. This network of both underground tunnels (weirs) and canals diverts water from natural water sources into the wet-rice cultivation fields utilized by Balinese farmers to grow their staple crops.

The system of cooperative water redistribution is tied to religious and cultural practices among the Balinese and represents an economic system based on mutual obligation, and managed by the personnel of the water temples (&quot;Pura Tirta&quot;). Religious officials from these water temples exert spiritual and cultural pressure on the participants in this system and ensure its continuation. These water temples are largely located at the loci of the irrigation networks and manage the distribution of water from the mountainous water sources of the island to lowland areas where water is too scarce for the natural cultivation of rice.

There is evidence this system developed as early as the 11th century CE and has been in continuous use since that time. Genetic evidence indicates that this system spread along kinship lines as the original farming villagers of Bali spread from areas where wet-rice farming originated to less climatically favorable areas of the island. The cultural prestige of certain &quot;Pura Titra&quot; largely correlates to their position within the &quot;subak&quot; system, with temples located at major water sources having significant cultural influence. Royalty has associated themselves with major temples of this type, to link their prestige with that of the &quot;Pura Titra&quot;, and have taken part in the operations of water temples as a means of gaining influence in society.

This system of physical infrastructure represents a durable network of belief that encourages its continuation by the people who participate and provides a levelling mechanism where people who would otherwise be incapable of participating in wet-rice agriculture to take part in the same subsistence activities as those who live in regions more naturally supportive of water-intensive crop growth.

==Festivals==

Balinese people celebrate multiple festivals, including the Kuta Carnival, the Sanur Village Festival, and the Bali Kite Festival, where participants fly fish-, bird-, and leaf-shaped kites while an orchestra plays traditional music.

<doc id="1035948" wikidata="Q1146816" url="?curid=1035948" title="Honda Gold Wing">
<text>The Honda Gold Wing is a series of touring motorcycles manufactured by Honda. Gold Wings feature shaft drive and a flat engine. Characterized by press in September 1974 as &quot;The world&#x27;s biggest motor cycle manufacturer&#x27;s first attack on the over-750cc capacity market...&quot;, it was introduced at the Cologne Motorcycle Show in October 1974.

==The Gold Wing series==
Total sales are more than 640,000, most of them in the U.S. market. Gold Wings were assembled in Marysville, Ohio, from 1980 until 2010, when motorcycle production there was halted. No Gold Wings were produced for the 2011 model year, and production resumed in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan in 2011 using tooling transported from the American factory.

The includes a Honda Gold Wing GL1000 manufactured in 1974 as one of their &quot;240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology&quot;. Through 2012, Honda GL models have appeared eighteen times in the &quot;Cycle World&quot; list of Ten Best bikes.

Over the course of its production history, the Gold Wing had many design changes, beginning in 1975 with a flat-four engine; by 2001, this had grown to a flat-six. The 2012 model had anti-lock braking, cruise control, electrically assisted reverse gear, an optional airbag, a fairing with heating and an adjustable windscreen, panniers and a trunk, a pillion backrest, satnav, and a six-speaker radio/audio system with MP3/iPod connectivity.

==Gold Wing development==
In 1972, following the success of the CB750 superbike, the company assembled an R&amp;D design team to explore concepts for a new flagship motorcycle. The project leader was Shoichiro Irimajiri, who in the 1960s had designed Honda&#x27;s multi-cylinder Grand Prix engines and their Formula One V12 engine.

The 1974 Gold Wing with its flat-four shaft-drive powertrain used technologies both from earlier motorcycle and automotive designs.

Although preceded by the 1971 water-cooled Suzuki GT750 two-stroke triple, the Gold Wing was the first Japanese production motorcycle with a water-cooled four-stroke engine. The first four-cylinder boxer engine was produced in 1900.

===Target market===
During its development, the CB750 was known within Honda as their &quot;King of Motorcycles.&quot; As it would sit atop the CB750 as the top of the line Honda motorcycle, the project that would become the Gold Wing was informally called the &quot;King of Kings.&quot; Honda first envisaged the Gold Wing as a large sport motorcycle, but on learning that customers were &quot;piling miles on touring&quot;, Honda reconsidered the bike&#x27;s design objectives, realising that the primary market for the Gold Wing was the long-distance motorcyclist. In North America a motorcycle suitable to that task would need comfort for the long haul, wind protection, a smooth ride, a comfortable seat, luggage storage, and power in abundance.

In America in the early 1970s, long-distance motorcyclists had only a few manufacturers to choose from: Harley-Davidson, Moto Guzzi and BMW. The H-D Electra Glide was a touring motorcycle with a loyal cult following. It faced strong competition from Moto Guzzi&#x27;s 850cc Eldorado. BMW motorcycles were smoother and more reliable, if expensive. Other large Japanese motorcycles, such as the Honda CB750 and the Kawasaki Z1 were cheaper but were not ideal tourers with their small fuel tanks and rear drive-chains needing regular maintenance. The Gold Wing was aimed at a newly emerging market segment, namely, a new kind of American long-distance rider who was not likely to buy a Harley-Davidson or BMW but who would open their wallets for a reliable machine offering comfort, endurance, low maintenance, and a smooth, torquey, quiet engine.

The Gold Wing&#x27;s secondary target market was Europe, where riders prioritised handling and performance over luxury. (The European market&#x27;s special demands subsequently led to the Honda Pan European). Though other motorcycle manufacturers build touring bikes, no other touring bike has achieved the popularity of the Gold Wing.

===M1 prototype &amp; Project 371===
In 1972, the project team broke from Honda practice to produce an experimental prototype motorcycle code-named &quot;M1&quot;. Instead of the usual transverse engine layout with a chain final drive, the M1 had a longitudinal engine suitable for shaft drive. The M1 had a 1470cc liquid-cooled flat-six engine, (twice the displacement of the CB750). Instead of seeking high performance (as some engineers had wanted), the M1 engine was designed to have a broad torque output and to produce at 6700 rpm, with a top speed of .

The brainstorming team&#x27;s M1 project was never intended as a production prototype. Nonetheless, the M1 should be seen as the primordial Gold Wing because so many of its distinctive features appeared on the GL1000. The flat-six gave the M1 a low center of gravity, enhancing stability, but the extreme length of the engine/gearbox unit resulted in a cramped riding position. Instead, the project team chose to build a bike with a compact one liter flat-four engine. This bike was code-named &quot;Project 371&quot;, and Toshio Nozue (who had worked on CB750 development) took over from Irimajiri as project leader.

==First generation==
===GL1000===
The Project 371 team finally settled on a layout that became the characteristic Gold Wing: a liquid-cooled flat-four SOHC engine, with a gear-driven generator that contra-rotated to counteract the engine&#x27;s torque reaction. Cylinder blocks and crankcase were integral, with the transmission situated beneath the crankcase to keep the unit construction engine as short as possible. Final drive was by shaft.

Before going on sale in the US and in Europe in 1975, the Gold Wing was revealed to dealers in September 1974 at American Honda&#x27;s annual dealer meeting in Las Vegas, and then shown to the public the following month at the IFMA (International Bicycle and Motorcycle Exhibition; today Intermot) in Cologne.

Small fairings had been mounted on two of the show models at the US dealer show in Las Vegas. These Honda-designed fairings were to be manufactured in the US by the Vetter Fairing Company and sold as &quot;Hondaline&quot; accessories; but they never went into production after the molds were accidentally destroyed. Consequently, the Gold Wing was born into the world naked, lacking saddlebags and having no place for luggage, without even a windshield. This created a for accessory manufacturers, who quickly offered a range of fairings and luggage accessories, particularly the Craig Vetter &quot;Windjammer&quot; series.

The original GL1000 (designated K0) had an electric starter backed up by a kick start lever stored inside a dummy fuel tank, which also housed the radiator expansion tank, electrical components, as well as the air filter supplying four Keihin 32 mm CV carburetors. The real fuel tank was under the seat, in order to keep the center of mass as low as possible. The bike had a dry weight of . 13,000 Gold Wings were sold in the United States in 1975.

There were no significant changes in the standard Gold Wing for 1976 (the K1 model). To mark the United States Bicentennial year Honda announced the GL1000 LTD with distinctive insignia and color scheme (e.g., gold stripes, gold wheels) plus some extra amenities. The LTD was a genuine limited edition with production restricted to about 2,000 units.

In the third model year (K2) Honda began refining the Gold Wing, although the changes for 1977 were small, such as exhaust pipe heat shields, revised seat and handlebar, as well as a new fuel gauge. Weight increased to . The motorcycle division of Honda UK produced 52 &quot;Executive&quot; GL1000 K1 bikes by adding premium accessories to 1977 Gold Wings.

The engine was modified in 1978 for the GL1000 K3 model, in order to make more torque available at lower engine speeds; the carburetors were reduced in size by 1 mm, the exhaust system was redesigned, valve timing and ignition timing were altered. The kick-start mechanism was removed from the engine, and a reserve lighting module for the headlight and taillight (automatically switching to the second filament when one burns out) was removed from the electrics. A small instrument panel appeared on top of a restyled dummy fuel tank. Wire-spoke wheels were replaced with Honda&#x27;s new ComStar wheels, but the existing tires with inner tubes remained. Dry weight grew to .

1979 marked the end of GL1000 development with the K4 model (the UK version was designated KZ). Dry weight increased slightly to . for the last Gold Wing to be powered by a one-liter engine. There were only minor changes for this model year, except for the ComStar wheels; new ComStars had stronger steel spokes on aluminum rims instead of the original aluminum spoked wheels that precipitated a 1979 recall (for the 1978 model year). During the final run of the GL1000 in 1979, &quot;Hondaline&quot; saddlebags and trunk were available, but Honda still did not offer a fairing.

Honda sold more than 97,000 units of the GL1000 in the United States between 1975 and 1979.

==Second generation==

===GL1100(SC02)===
After five years of the GL1000, the second-generation Gold Wing was released in 1979 as a 1980 model, and the GL1100 would be continued through the 1983 model year. The GL1100 was manufactured in Japan until May 1980 when Honda started assembling 1981 models at the Marysville Motorcycle Plant in Ohio, which had been making frames and parts for various models since 1974. Gold Wings would be built at a rate of 150 units a day for the years 1981–1983. Engines were still being built in Japan, but Honda began to market the machine as being made in America.

The Gold Wing faced competition from Japan in the form of the Suzuki GS1000 with an inline-four engine, and especially in the Kawasaki Z1300 that had a massive DOHC 1300cc straight-six engine with water cooling. Honda responded by increasing the displacement of the Gold Wing, and then followed-up by announcing the first Japanese full-dress tourer. The new engine was more than just a GL1000 with a 3 mm larger bore, the alterations clearly emphasized torque over horsepower. The cylinder heads were modified to improve combustion at low and middle engine speeds, transmission gear ratios were changed and the final drive ratio shortened to make more torque available at highway speeds. The bore size for all four carburetors was again reduced by 1 mm, to 30 mm.

The wheelbase was lengthened over that of the GL1000, and air suspension was added. The GL1100 had an adjustable seat, and for the first time used tubeless tires, mounted on black reverse ComStar wheels. The naked Gold Wing, which would become known as the &quot;Standard&quot; model, weighed dry. In spite of the fact that here were only minor changes to differentiate the GL1100 &#x27;81 edition from the previous year.

Ridden by Emilio Scotto, the GL1100 is the bike that toured the world. Holding the record for the longest distance of any motorcycle total distance of 457,000 miles (735,000 km).

All the 1982 Gold Wings had transmission ratios revised (again) to lower engine rpm at cruising speeds, new brakes with twin-piston calipers and wider tires on smaller wheels. Dry weight for the GL1100 &#x27;82 was .

Transmission gear ratios were revised yet again for the 1983 Gold Wings to lessen engine speed on the highway. But the significant changes were not to the engine, they were to the running gear in this last year for GL1100s. Cast aluminum eleven-spoke wheels replaced the ComStars. The front suspension was endowed with TRAC anti-dive forks with an integrated fork brace, and the rear suspension worked even with no air pressure. Honda&#x27;s first combined braking system, dubbed &quot;Unified Braking&quot; at the time, debuted in 1983; it engaged both front and rear brakes in unison when the brake pedal was applied. Dry weight for the standard GL1100 inched up to .

===GL1100 Interstate===
Honda went beyond the mechanical makeover of the naked Gold Wing in March 1980 by releasing the first Japanese turn-key tourer, the &quot;Interstate&quot; model (GL1100I) with a factory-installed full fairing, saddlebags and a removable trunk, plus a long list of optional extras including a stereo system. This bike was called the &quot;De Luxe&quot; model (GL1100DX) in some markets. The fairing was designed to protect both the rider and a passenger from the wind. Likewise, the saddlebags and trunk were intended to carry the baggage of two people. This made the Interstate significantly heavier than the standard model, with a dry weight of . The almost identical Interstate model was made for 1981.

The GL1100I &#x27;82 model offered more options, such as a new stereo, a 40-channel CB transceiver, and an on-board compressor to adjust the suspension air pressure. Dry weight was .

The GL1100I &#x27;83 received the engine and running gear updates of the standard model; dry weight increased to .

===GL1100 Aspencade===
Starting in 1982, Honda offered three different Gold Wing models. With the introduction of the &quot;Aspencade&quot; (GL1100A) Honda took the full-dress tourer to a new level of luxury, with a larger seat, two-tone paint and more storage compartments, together with many options from the Interstate that were being included as standard. All three brake disks on the GL1100A were internally ventilated. The additional items jacked up the dry weight to .

The GL1100A &#x27;83 received the same engine and running gear updates of the other models. The Aspencade also got new front and rear brakes, with internally ventilated front discs (only), as well as a digital LCD instrument panel and some additional amenities for rider and passenger. Weight went up just a bit to .

==Third generation==

===GL1200(SC14)===
In 1983 Honda was facing a challenge in the marketplace from a new full-dress tourer, the Yamaha Venture XVZ 1200 with its DOHC four valve per cylinder V4 engine (as Yamaha&#x27;s XS Eleven Venturer had challenged the GL1100 two years earlier). Honda hit back at the Milan motorcycle show late that year by announcing a new 1984 Gold Wing that pushed its four-cylinder engine design to its limits. The bored and stroked boxer produced more power and torque; a new final drive ratio gave the GL1200 taller gearing in order to reduce noise and vibration. The four Keihin 32 mm CV carburetors were larger than those on the GL1100 engine, on the other hand, they were the same size as the &#x27;75–&#x27;76 GL1000 carbs. Incorporating hydraulic actuation for the clutch, in addition to hydraulic tappets for the valves, made the new engine virtually maintenance-free. In order to make the Gold Wing more nimble, front and rear wheel diameters contracted (and tire widths expanded) one more time. The GL1200 was built on a new, stronger frame and despite all the improvements, the claimed dry weight of the naked bike remained unchanged at for the 1984 model year.

1984 was the one and only year for the GL1200 &quot;Standard&quot; (which was not exported to Europe) for the reason that sales had decreased in favor of the Interstate and Aspencade models. This led to the decline of aftermarket manufacturers such as the Vetter Fairing Company.

The GL1200&#x27;s competitors were becoming more numerous. Last of the big Japanese manufacturers to do so, Suzuki finally entered the marketplace in 1985 with their full-dress tourer, the GV1400 Cavalcade with a DOHC, four valves per cylinder, V4 engine. In 1986 Yamaha enlarged the Venture&#x27;s V4 engine to 1300cc, and Kawasaki introduced the ZG 1200 Voyager XII with a four-valve, DOHC, Inline-four engine.

With three versions of the Gold Wing boxer motor spanning a dozen years, by 1987 further development of the flat-four engine was regarded as being constrained by the law of diminishing returns. Piston displacement had been increased twice to generate more torque, but this also made each power stroke more intense. During the same time period, gear ratios had been raised to decrease engine RPM (boosting fuel economy and reducing vibration as well as noise levels) which in turn made pulses through the drivetrain seem rougher to the rider because firing intervals were farther apart. The obvious way to deliver power more smoothly (as Irimajiri-san had demonstrated with the M1 engine) was to step up from four cylinders to six.

===GL1200 Interstate===
Having introduced the full-dress Interstate with the GL1100, Honda used the GL1200I &#x27;84 to refine the Gold Wing&#x27;s fairing so that it would come across as a basic part of the bike and not as an afterthought. The new model Interstate (still called De Luxe in Europe) had an automotive-style instrument panel up front and increased luggage capacity in back: in each saddlebag plus another in the trunk. Dry weight for the 1984 Interstate was .

Despite giving the Gold Wing &quot;taller&quot; gearing the year before, in 1985 Honda &quot;shortened&quot; the overall gearing to improve performance. There were many small changes to the GL1200I &#x27;85 but atypically its price was the same as it was the previous year, and at its weight was basically stable.

The GL1200I &#x27;86 got more small updates, but the significant change was that all Gold Wing engines were being produced in Honda&#x27;s Anna, Ohio plant from July 1985. Claimed dry weight for the 1986 Interstate was unchanged. The GL1200I &#x27;87 got a new seat design with three-stage foam; the weight was unchanged for 1987, the last year of the four-cylinder Gold Wing Interstate.

===GL1200 Aspencade===
The GL1200A &#x27;84 had all the features of the GL1200I, plus a new Panasonic audio system that combined AM/FM radio, cassette player and an intercom between the rider and passenger. Unlike the analog instruments of the Interstate, the Aspencade had a dashboard with an LCD digital display. The GL1200A also had foot boards for the passenger instead of footpegs. Claimed dry weight for the 1984 Aspencade was .
The price was unchanged for 1985, and the Aspencade received the same updates as the Interstate model for that year. Dry weight for the Aspencade was in both &#x27;85 and ’86.

In 1986 Dolby noise reduction was added to the audio system, which was replaced with an improved Panasonic system in 1987. In its final year, the GL1200A got the same seat upgrade as the GL1200I &#x27;87 model and some amenities that had been optional were made standard, increasing the dry weight of the Aspencade to .

===Fuel-injected models===

In 1985 Honda marked the tenth anniversary of the Gold Wing by launching a gold-painted &quot;Limited Edition&quot; model (GL1200L) luxuriously equipped with cruise control, auto-leveling rear suspension, an electronic trip computer and a four-speaker audio system. The significant development was that the GL1200L was furnished with Honda&#x27;s programmed fuel injection system, previously used on the turbocharged CX500T and CX650T (variants of the GL500 and GL650 Silver Wing). Also known as the &quot;LTD&quot;, 5372 units were built and sold only in North America. Claimed dry weight for the GL1200L was .

To a limited extent, the &quot;Limited Edition&quot; turned out to be a sham when the &quot;SE-i&quot; (Special Edition—injected) debuted in 1986, as essentially a repainted GL1200L. The SE-i had the same Dolby audio system as the GL1200A &#x27;86 and was only available in the US. This was the only year for the SE-i because the high cost of the fuel injection system forced Honda to return to carburetors for 1987.
==Fourth generation==

===GL1500(SC22)===

A new design team began work on the fourth-generation Gold Wing in 1984. Honda describes prototype testing as involving sixty developmental stages, and building fifteen different test bikes, including one made from a GL1200 frame coupled with the original M1 engine so that a six-cylinder could be compared to a four-cylinder head-on. This early &#x27;70s prototype had an influence far beyond what the M1&#x27;s initial designers could have expected.

New Gold Wing engine design goals were smoothness, quietness and enormous power. Ultimately, a redesigned Gold Wing made its debut at the 1987 Cologne Motorcycle Show, 13 years after the original GL1000 was first shown to the public at the same venue, and the GL1500 brought the most changes seen to the Gold Wing series since its inception. The biggest difference was that the flat-four engine was replaced with a flat-six engine. Although the GL1500 still used carburetors, there were just two large 36 mm CV Keihins supplying all six cylinders, the first time any Gold Wing had less than one carb per cylinder.

Honda also enclosed the entire motorcycle in plastic, giving it a seamless appearance. The seat height was lowest yet on a Gold Wing, the passenger back rest and trunk were integrated, and a central mechanism locked the trunk lid and saddlebags. Rear suspension air pressure was adjusted by an on-board compressor. One major innovation was the addition of a &quot;reverse gear&quot;, which was actually a creative use of the electric starter motor linked to the transmission. Because of the size and weight, Honda felt that some people would have problems backing it up.

The new Gold Wing had grown in nearly every dimension. A larger windshield, longer wheelbase, two more cylinders, more horsepower, more bodywork, more electronics, more accessories and more mass: dry. Options include a passenger audio control and rear speakers, CB radio, auxiliary lights and exterior trim. In another first for the GL1500, 1988 was the year Honda exported Gold Wings from the US to Japan for the first time.

For 1989 Honda modified the brake discs, and raised the price. Brake discs were modified again in 1990, as were the carbs and camshafts, without a price increase. The claimed GL1500 dry weight for &#x27;90 was . In addition, a Gold Wing 15th Anniversary Special Edition model (GL1500SE) made its debut in 1990.

The following year, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of American-made Gold Wings, every bike produced for 1991 came with a numbered plaque and anniversary edition insignia. There were three &#x27;91 models: &quot;Aspencade&quot; indicated the regular GL1500 model; the luxurious Special Edition from the year before carried on as the &quot;SE&quot; model; and the &quot;Interstate&quot; name denoted a stripped-down model.

===GL1500 Aspencade===
When the Honda of America Manufacturing (HAM) plant in Marysville, Ohio produced its 500,000th vehicle in 1991, it was a Gold Wing Aspencade. The claimed dry weight for the GL1500A &#x27;91 was . Honda began offering extra cost paint options, and Honda Canada inaugurated &quot;Canadian Edition&quot; Gold Wings in &#x27;92.

Beginning in 1993, all GL1500 rocker arms pivoted on needle bearings, and the cruise control was updated to directly read crankshaft speed for enhanced precision. 1994 was the seventh year of GL1500 production (longer than any of its forerunners) and nothing significant changed except the asking price.

1995 was the 20th anniversary of the Gold Wing. American Honda published a special hard-cover book All 1995 models got commemorative emblems, cosmetic changes, a thinner and narrower seat and suspension improvements which reduced ground clearance, contributing to an even lower seat height (offsetting the weight gain). The GL1500A was at its heaviest in &#x27;95; the claimed dry weight would stay at until the end of this model.

The 1996 Aspencade received an upmarket audio system that had been exclusive to the GL1500SE. Yet another milestone was reached in mid-1996 when a Gold Wing Aspencade was the millionth Honda motorcycle made in America to roll off the assembly line at the Marysville Motorcycle Plant. The GL1500 family got bigger when Honda created the first GL1500C &quot;Valkyrie&quot; in May 1996 (for the 1997 model year). The Valkyrie was the first naked GL since 1984.

1997 GL1500s received engine, transmission and final drive improvements first introduced on the GL1500C. A 1998 Gold Wing styling makeover extended to the engine with redesigned valve covers, but no price increase. Honda commemorated 50 years in America by adding 50th Anniversary emblems to all 1999 Gold Wings; the GL1500A &#x27;99 price increased. The 2000 Gold Wings had chrome-plated valve covers, Canadian and American models also had gold-plated 25th Anniversary emblems marking 25 years since the first GL1000 debuted for the 1975 model year.

The 2000 model was the last GL1500 Aspencade model. A complete redesign of the Marysville Motorcycle Plant began In January 2000 to build the next Gold Wing, and stories soon came out in the motorcycle press that the Gold Wing itself was being redesigned. The GL1500 had been in production for 13 model years, which was as long as all of the four-cylinder Gold Wings combined; moreover, GL1500 engine continued to be used in the Valkyrie through the 2003 model year.

===GL1500 SE===
The original 15th Anniversary &quot;Special Edition&quot; model had a vented windshield, additional lights, upgraded sound system, two-tone paint with special insignia, adjustable passenger floorboards and adjustable foot pegs as well as foot heaters for the rider. In 1990 It had a weight of dry. The GL1500SE &#x27;91 was essentially unchanged, though weight and price were up a bit at .

Hitherto optional rear speakers and CB radio became standard on the GL1500SE &#x27;93; boosting both its weight—.

The GL1500SE &#x27;97 had powertrain updates. Honda marked its 50th anniversary in 1999 without a GL1500SE price increase, and the American-made GL1500SE &#x27;99 that was exported to Japan got a two-tone paint job. More significantly, the export model got an exhaust air-injection system along with carburetor modifications in order to pass Japan&#x27;s new emission regulations.

The 25th Anniversary GL1500SE in 2000 had a claimed dry weight from 1995 to 2000 was .

===GL1500 Interstate===
The GL1500I &#x27;91 model had its weight and price cut by eliminating the reverse gear, cruise-control, the passenger footboards, and by replacing the audio system with a small Kenwood radio. The seat was lowered by . Claimed dry weight for the 1991 Interstate was . In 1992 the Kenwood radio was, in turn, replaced by a new Panasonic 25-watt-per-channel sound system with intercom. Weight for the GL1500I &#x27;92 rose slightly to .

As with the other 20th Anniversary models, the cost of a GL1500I &#x27;95 jumped. The last GL1500I was the 1996 model. Claimed dry weight for &#x27;95 and &#x27;96 was . The Interstate model was discontinued, replaced in 1997 by the &quot;Valkyrie Tourer&quot; (GL1500CT) as well as the 1999 &quot;Valkyrie Interstate&quot; (GL1500CF).


==Fifth generation==

===GL1800(SC47)===
The first new model for 13 years, the 2001 GL1800 had a larger engine with fuel injection, and a power increase from to . The GL1800&#x27;s extruded aluminium frame, comprising 31 elements (barely half the GL1500&#x27;s number) resulted in an overall weight decrease. Options included ABS braking.

The 2006 model had further options: an airbag, in-dash GPS called Internavi, with audio information provided through the speakers and headset cables, plus a rider &quot;comfort package&quot; comprising saddle heating, heated grips, and adjustable engine-air vents ahead of the driver&#x27;s foot pegs.

===Update(SC68)===
The 2010 model year was the last to be produced in the United States, and no 2011 model year Gold Wings were produced while manufacturing was transferred to Japan in 2012. Some retailers and aftermarket traders group all GL1800 models into two categories: US made GL1800s (2001–2010) are &quot;1st Generation&quot;, and Japanese-built GL1800&#x27;s (2012–2017) are &quot;2nd Generation&quot;.

2nd Gen GL1800 had minor updates: restyled bodywork made the fairing and saddlebags seem less bulbous, despite being more capacious. A revised fairing gave better protection to the rider&#x27;s legs, with vents channelling warm engine air onto the rider&#x27;s feet. The trunk, fairing pockets and saddlebags gave a storage capacity of . The instrument display has a brighter screen, an updated satellite navigation / radio, and a revised six-speaker audio system with MP3 and iPod connectivity.

==Sixth generation==

===2018 GL1800(SC79)===
For its sixth generation, in 2018, Honda produced a completely redesigned Gold Wing. The new model has a new four-valve engine and is available in two versions: the standard Gold Wing (replacing F6B bagger) and the &quot;top trunk&quot; Gold Wing Tour. Sportier in appearance, technologically more advanced, and more compact, the 2018 Gold Wing is lighter than before. Its new robotically welded frame has a double wishbone front suspension, resembling the Duolever from BMW. New features include throttle by wire, four ride modes, traction control, LED lighting, hill start assist, Apple CarPlay, and (on the Tour model) electronically adjustable suspension. Options include automatic dual clutch transmission with a forward and reverse &quot;walking mode&quot;.

In mid-June 2020, Honda introduced Android Auto. For 2021, Honda increased the size of the top trunk from 50 litres to 61 litres. The passenger&#x27;s back seat rest features a more relaxed angle with thicker foam and taller profile. Speakers were changed to 45 watt with automatic volume adjustment and standard XM radio. Rear turn signals were changed to all red.

==F6C &quot;Valkyrie&quot;==


In 1997 Honda brought back an incarnation of the &quot;Standard&quot; or &quot;classic&quot; Gold Wing, renamed the Valkyrie in the US, and called F6C in the rest of the world. It had a higher performance engine, based on the GL1500, in a cruiser-style frame. The Valkyrie Tourer version had a windshield and saddlebags. A more touring-oriented version was introduced in 1999 as the Valkyrie Interstate with a full fairing, saddlebags and trunk. It was released as a naked bike, but also had a Tourer and an Interstate model. These two incarnations lasted relatively short and were (re-absorbed by the Goldwing line.

These Valkyrie models were dropped due to slow sales, leaving the standard Valkyrie, which was discontinued after the 2003 model year and since then intermittently new Valkyrie models introduced into the market as &quot;limited&quot; editions. One such case was the in 2004 released Limited Edition model, the Valkyrie Rune, complete with engine and unique styling.

The Valkyrie engine is based on the Gold Wing engine, but has solid lifters instead of hydraulic lifters, six carburetors instead of the Goldwing&#x27;s two (carbs ≤ 2000, FI ≥ 2001), more aggressive camshafts, a free flowing exhaust, and altered ignition timing to increase performance.

===Valkyrie revival===
At the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show, Honda revealed a new naked version of the GL1800, the 2014 Valkyrie, using the same 1832cc six-cylinder engine as the Gold Wing but weighing less. The new Valkyrie has increased rake and trail, front and rear suspension revised for the reduced weight, 50/50 weight distribution and large tires after the fashion of sport-bikes. Going beyond the naked bike genre, the Valkyrie&#x27;s horsepower-to-weight ratio puts it clearly into the &quot;muscle bike&quot; class.

==F6B &quot;Bagger&quot;==
In 2013, Honda brought out a new variation on the traditional Gold Wing, itself being available in two models, The F6B and F6B Deluxe. The F6B is basically a greatly stripped-down version of the &#x27;standard&#x27; Gold Wing with most of the chrome trim being &#x27;blacked out&#x27;, giving the F6B a look that should appeal to many cruiser buyers. It is affectionately known as the Bagger. The rear trunk has been eliminated and the windshield is much smaller. The seat is changed for both the passenger and the rider with the most obvious difference being that the passenger no longer has the oversize backrest – a result of the removal of the trunk. The F6B Deluxe does, however, come with a small passenger backrest, heated grips, self cancelling turn signals &amp; center stand as standard equipment. The basic design is, otherwise, the same as the full blown Gold Wing except that there is no reverse gear and early models did not have cruise control. For 2018 this model is now just called the standard Gold Wing.
== In popular culture ==
The 4th generation Honda GL1500 Goldwing served as basis for Gunmax&#x27;s Gun Bike in Japanese mecha anime series &quot;The Brave Police J-Decker&quot;.

<text>The is a railway line that runs through Tokyo and Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Part of the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) network, the line operates on separate tracks along the right-of-way of the Chūō Main Line (Chūō Line (Rapid)) and Sōbu Main Line (Sōbu Line (Rapid)), providing service between Mitaka Station in the cities of Mitaka and Musashino and Chiba Station in Chiba.

The term distinguishes local trains on the Chūō-Sōbu line from rapid service trains running on the Chūō Main Line between Mitaka and and on the Sōbu Main Line between and Chiba.

== Service patterns ==
===Chūō-Sōbu Line===

*Regularly, trains terminate at Chiba or Tsudanuma at the east side, and terminate at Nakano or Mitaka at the west side
*All trains stop at every station.
**For station information on the parallel rapid/express lines, see the Chūō Line (Rapid) and Sōbu Line (Rapid) articles.

=== Tōzai Line through service ===
All through service trains enter the Tōzai Line at either Nakano, or Nishi-Funabashi. These trains operate within the following routes:

* Mitaka – Nakano – (Tōzai Line) – Nishi-Funabashi – Tsudanuma (weekday mornings/evenings only) 
* Nakano – (Tōzai Line) – Nishi-Funabashi – Tsudanuma (weekday mornings/evenings only) 
* Mitaka – Nakano – (Tōzai Line) – Nishi-Funabashi
* Mitaka – Nakano – (Tōzai Line) – Nishi-Funabashi – (Tōyō Rapid Railway Line) – Tōyō-Katsutadai (mornings/evenings only)

=== Limited express ===
Prior to March 2024, seasonal Limited Express &quot;Shinjuku Wakashio&quot; and &quot;Shinjuku Sazanami&quot; trains stopped at on the Chūō-Sōbu Line &quot;mainly on weekends and holidays when service is heavy&quot;. , these trains no longer stop at Akihabara. 

=== Former Early morning / Late night ===
At around 9 -10pm, a few westbound trains headed beyond Mitaka onto the Chūō Line (Rapid), with some terminating at Musashi-Koganei, and the others at Tachikawa. The other trains during the hour operated regularly.

At around 4 - 6am and 11pm - 1am, Chūō-Sōbu Line services were divided at Ochanomizu Station, into two sections. 

* At the western section (Mitaka – Ochanomizu), Chūō Line (Rapid) trains ran through the Chūō-Sōbu Line tracks between and , with services serving between and as far as , or even Ōme, which stops at all stations. 
* At the eastern section (Ochanomizu – Chiba), local trains operated and terminated at the two ends of the section.

This service pattern last operated on 13 March 2020. To prepare for the eventual installation of platform doors on Chūō-Sōbu Line platforms and the future addition of Green Cars on the Rapid line, Chūō Line Rapid service trains no longer regularly operate on the Chūō-Sōbu Line tracks.

<text>James Beck Gordon (July 14, 1945 – March 13, 2023) was an American musician, songwriter, and convicted murderer. Gordon was a session drummer in the late 1960s and 1970s and was the drummer in the blues rock supergroup Derek and the Dominos.

In 1983, in a psychotic episode associated with undiagnosed schizophrenia, Gordon murdered his mother and was sentenced to 16 years to life in prison, remaining incarcerated until his death in 2023.

==Music career==
Gordon was raised in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles and attended Grant High School. He passed up a music scholarship to UCLA in order to begin his professional career in 1963, at age 17, backing the Everly Brothers. He went on to become one of the most sought-after recording session drummers in Los Angeles. The protégé of studio drummer Hal Blaine, Gordon performed on many notable recordings in the 1960s, including &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; by the Beach Boys (1966); &quot;The Spirit of &#x27;67&quot; by Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders; &quot;Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers&quot; by Gene Clark (1967); &quot;Who Knows Where the Time Goes&quot; by Judy Collins (1968)&quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot; by the Byrds (1968); and the hit &quot;Classical Gas&quot; by Mason Williams (1968). At the height of his career Gordon was reportedly so busy as a studio musician that he flew back to Los Angeles from Las Vegas every day to do two or three recording sessions and then returned in time to play the evening show at Caesars Palace.

In 1969 and 1970 Gordon toured as part of the backing band for Delaney &amp; Bonnie, which at the time included Eric Clapton. Clapton subsequently took the group&#x27;s rhythm section — Gordon (drummer), Carl Radle (bassist), Bobby Whitlock (keyboardist, singer, songwriter) — and they formed a new band, later called Derek and the Dominos. The band&#x27;s first studio work was as the house band for George Harrison&#x27;s three-disc set &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; (1970).

Gordon then played on Derek and the Dominos&#x27; 1970 double album &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot; and also played with the band on subsequent U.S. and UK tours. The group split in spring 1971 before they finished recording their second album. In addition to his drumming, Gordon was credited with contributing the elegiac piano coda for the title track, &quot;Layla&quot;. In later years, Whitlock claimed that the coda was not actually written by Gordon: &quot;Jim took that piano melody from his ex-girlfriend Rita Coolidge. I know because in the D&amp;B days I lived in John Garfield&#x27;s old house in the Hollywood Hills and there was a guest house with an upright piano in it. Rita and Jim were up there in the guest house and invited me to join in on writing this song with them called &#x27;Time&#x27;. (Her sister Priscilla wound up recording it with Booker T. Jones) Jim took the melody from Rita&#x27;s song and didn&#x27;t give her credit for writing it. Her boyfriend ripped her off&quot;. Graham Nash (who later dated Coolidge) substantiated Whitlock&#x27;s claim in his memoir. &quot;Time&quot; was not released by Priscilla Coolidge and Booker T. until 1973, on their album &quot;Chronicles&quot;.

In 1970 Gordon was part of Joe Cocker&#x27;s &quot;Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen&quot; tour and played on Dave Mason&#x27;s album &quot;Alone Together&quot;. In 1971, he toured with Traffic and appeared on two of their albums, including &quot;The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys&quot;. That same year he played on Harry Nilsson&#x27;s album &quot;Nilsson Schmilsson&quot;, contributing the drum solo on the track &quot;Jump into the Fire&quot;.

Gordon was the drummer on the Incredible Bongo Band&#x27;s album &quot;Bongo Rock&quot;, released in 1972, and his drum break on the LP version of &quot;Apache&quot; has been frequently sampled by rap music artists. He recorded with Frank Zappa, including on the title track of the 1974 album &quot;Apostrophe (&#x27;)&quot;. Also in 1972, Gordon played drums on Helen Reddy&#x27;s Top 20 US album &quot;I Am Woman&quot;.

In 1973 Gordon played on Johnny Rivers&#x27; &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; as well as on Art Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Angel Clare&quot; albums, and toured with Rivers through 1974 appearing on the &quot;Last Boogie in Paris&quot; live album. Also in 1974, Gordon played on most of the tracks on Steely Dan&#x27;s album &quot;Pretzel Logic&quot;, including the single &quot;Rikki Don&#x27;t Lose That Number&quot;. He again worked with Chris Hillman of the Byrds as the drummer in the Souther–Hillman–Furay Band from 1973 to 1975. He also played drums on three tracks on Alice Cooper&#x27;s 1976 album, &quot;Alice Cooper Goes to Hell&quot;.

==Mental health==
Gordon developed schizophrenia and began to hear voices (including his mother&#x27;s) which compelled him to starve himself and prevented him from sleeping, relaxing or playing drums. His physicians misdiagnosed the problems and instead treated him for alcohol abuse.

While on tour with Joe Cocker in the early 1970s, Gordon reportedly punched his then-girlfriend Rita Coolidge in a hotel hallway, causing her to end their relationship.

==Murder of mother, conviction and incarceration==
On June 3, 1983, Gordon attacked his 71-year-old widowed mother, Osa Marie (Beck) Gordon, with a hammer, then fatally stabbed her with a butcher knife, claiming that a voice told him to kill her.

Only after his arrest for murder was Gordon properly diagnosed with schizophrenia. At his trial, the court accepted that he had acute schizophrenia, but he was not allowed to use an insanity defense because of changes to California law arising from the federal Insanity Defense Reform Act.

On July 10, 1984, Gordon was sentenced to 16 years to life in prison. He was first eligible for parole in 1991, but it was denied several times because he never attended a parole hearing. 

In 2014, he declined to attend his hearing and was denied parole until at least 2018. A Los Angeles deputy district attorney stated at the hearing that Gordon was still &quot;seriously psychologically incapacitated&quot; and &quot;a danger when he is not taking his medication&quot;.

In November 2017, Gordon was rediagnosed with schizophrenia. On March 7, 2018, he was denied parole for the tenth time and was tentatively scheduled to become eligible again in March 2021. At the time of his death in 2023, he was serving his sentence at the California Medical Facility, a medical and psychiatric prison in Vacaville, California.

== Death ==
Gordon died in prison on March 13, 2023, at the age of 77. Two marriages, to singer Renee Armand and dancer Jill Barabe, both ended in divorce. He was survived by his daughter, who was born in 1968.

<text>Without a Paddle is a 2004 American adventure comedy film directed by Steven Brill, written by Jay Leggett and Mitch Rouse, and based on a story by Harris Goldberg, Tom Nursall, and Fred Wolf. The film stars Seth Green, Matthew Lillard, Dax Shepard, Ethan Suplee, Abraham Benrubi, Rachel Blanchard, Christina Moore, Bonnie Somerville, Ray Baker, and Burt Reynolds. It tells the story of three reunited childhood friends going on a trip up a remote river in order to search for the loot of long-lost airplane hijacker D. B. Cooper.

A direct-to-video sequel, entitled &quot;Without a Paddle: Nature&#x27;s Calling&quot;, was released in January 2009.

==Plot==
Twelve years after graduating from high school, three friends, Jerry, Dan, and Tom, learn that their childhood friend Billy has died in a parasailing accident. After the funeral, they revisit the group&#x27;s old tree house and find a map leading to D. B. Cooper&#x27;s lost treasure, which Billy had apparently been working on for his entire life. Dan takes annual leave from his job as a doctor and joins Jerry and Tom on a camping trip to find the treasure.

Canoeing down the river, they eventually stop on the riverbank for the night. They realize that they forgot to bring food, so Tom goes out to catch fish with a flashlight. However, the activity attracts a grizzly bear, which chases them. When Dan falls, the bear seemingly treats him like a cub until he breaks free, following the others up a tree. In the morning, they find all of their gear has been ripped up and completely destroyed by the bear.

The trio take off into the river but are unable to read the damaged map as well as avoiding a pair of fisherman, causing them to miss a split in the river and travel the wrong way. They go over a waterfall and survive, although their canoe is destroyed. Venturing into the woods with a compass, they find themselves at a pot farm, where rednecks Dennis and Elwood mistake them for thieves and start shooting at them. They escape, accidentally triggering flares which burn down the pot garden. This enrages Dennis and Elwood, who decide to hunt them down and kill them.

Later, far into the forest, after being shot at by the farmers, the trio meet hippie girls Flower and Butterfly, who treat them in their tree. The farmers find them by answering their distress radio call, but the women drop paper bags full of feces on the farmers to distract them while the trio escape. They are saved from the thunderstorm by a mountain man, who takes them to his hut and provides them with clothes. He later reveals himself to be Del Knox, Cooper&#x27;s partner before his death.

The next morning the farmers find them, and shoot-up the hut. The trio escape while Del distracts the farmers by shooting at the two with his dual wield revolvers. The trio stumbles upon the site of Cooper&#x27;s crash landing, discovering his skeleton and the suitcase he used to hold the ransom money down an old mine shaft. They realize he burned his share of the money in an attempt to keep warm and survive.

As Dan crawls through a small tunnel to find a way out, the farmers find Tom and Jerry, and a fistfight ensues. Eventually, Sheriff Briggs, who had earlier helped the trio, intervenes. He then reveals himself to be the farmers&#x27; employer. Jerry arms a grenade taken from Dennis and throws it at the pot dealers. It explodes, causing a tree to fall on the farmers and the sheriff, who are soon arrested.

In the closing scenes, Del gives Tom, Jerry, and Dan what&#x27;s left of D. B.&#x27;s non-burnt money ($100,000), but Jerry and Dan decide Tom needs it more than they do. Del begins his travels to give D. B. a proper funeral. Jerry proposes to his girlfriend Denise, Dan starts a relationship with Flower, and Tom becomes a camp counsellor for a children&#x27;s summer camp, where he tells his troop an exaggerated version of the trip.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Without a Paddle&quot; ranked second in its opening weekend behind fellow newcomer &quot;&quot;, earning $13,528,946. It ultimately grossed $58,169,327 in North America and $14,859,863 internationally, for a worldwide total of $73,029,190.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 14% based on 126 reviews, with an average rating of 3.9/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Without a Paddle&quot; has a few laughs, but not enough to sustain its running time.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 29 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Dennis Harvey of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;an unstable—if mostly painless—mix of low comedy, stabs at higher silliness, and schmaltz.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Scott Brown was more positive and wrote: &quot;There are some genuinely clever moments of physical comedy, and the inevitable crudeness is offset by winning whimsy. Without has all the freshness of moldering Playboys stashed under a mattress, but it evokes what few boys-will-be-boys larks can: chumminess.&quot;

==Sequel==
A sequel to the film, titled &quot;Without a Paddle: Nature&#x27;s Calling&quot;, was released direct-to-video on January 13, 2009. None of the cast and crew from the first film returned.

<doc id="1035967" wikidata="Q1310548" url="?curid=1035967" title="Mount Stromlo Observatory">
<text>Mount Stromlo Observatory located in the west of Canberra, Australia, is part of the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Australian National University (ANU). Australia&#x27;s oldest telescope and several others at the observatory were destroyed by bushfire in 2003.

==History==
The observatory was established in 1924 as The Commonwealth Solar Observatory. The Mount Stromlo site had already been used for observations in the previous decade, a small observatory being established there by Pietro Baracchi using the Oddie telescope located there in 1911. The dome built to house the Oddie telescope was the first Commonwealth building constructed in the newly established Australian Capital Territory. In 1911 a delegation for an Australian Solar Observatory went to London seeking Commonwealth assistance. The League of the Empire sought subscriptions to assist raising funds. Survey work to determine the site&#x27;s suitability had begun as soon as the idea of a new Capital was established. By 1909 the Australian Association for the Advancement of Science was assisted in this effort by Hugh Mahon (Minister for Home Affairs). Until World War II, the observatory specialised in solar and atmospheric observations. During the war the workshops contributed to the war effort by producing gun sights, and other optical equipment. After the war, the observatory shifted direction to stellar and galactic astronomy and was renamed The Commonwealth Observatory. Dr R. Wooley Director of the Observatory, worked to gain support for a larger reflector, arguing that the southern hemisphere should attempt to compete with the effectiveness of American telescopes. The ANU was established in 1946 in nearby Canberra and joint staff appointments and graduate studies were almost immediately undertaken. A formal amalgamation took place in 1957, with Mount Stromlo Observatory becoming part of the Department of Astronomy in the Research School of Physical Sciences at ANU, leading eventually to the formation of the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics in 1986.

On 18 January 2003, the devastating Canberra firestorm hit Mount Stromlo (which was surrounded by a plantation pine forest), destroying five telescopes, workshops, seven homes, and the heritage-listed administration building. The only telescope to escape the fires was the 1886 15-centimetre Farnham telescope. Relics from the fire are preserved in the collection of the National Museum of Australia. They include a melted telescope mirror and a piece of melted optical glass (flint). The latter has pieces of charcoal and wire fused into it from the fierce heat of the fire.

Redevelopment is completed and the Observatory is now a major partner in the construction of the Giant Magellan Telescope. The current observatory director is Stuart Wyithe

The director&#x27;s residence, destroyed in the 2003 fire, was rebuilt and opened to the public as a memorial in 2015.

In 2023, the Quantum Optical Ground Station was launched. It allows for terabit-per-second communication using adaptive optics and lasers.

==Research==
The MACHO project detected the first instance of the gravitational lensing of one star by another, known as gravitational microlensing, in 1993 (Alcock et al. 1993; Paczynski 1996). This discovery was made by repeated imaging of the Magellanic Clouds with the refurbished 50-inch Great Melbourne Telescope which was equipped with a mosaic of eight 2048 by 2048 pixel CCDs. The camera was constructed by the Centre for Particle Astrophysics in California (CFPA), and at the time was the largest digital camera ever built (Frame &amp; Faulkner 2003). Observations began in July 1992 and the project concluded in December 1999. In total, the MACHO project made over 200 billion stellar measurements, with the
data processed both at the observatory and at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

Brian Schmidt organised an international collaboration, known as the High-z Supernova Search Team, to study the rate of change of the Cosmic Expansion using type Ia supernovae. In 1998, the team reach the conclusion that the cosmic expansion was accelerating, contrary to expectations. This universal acceleration implies the existence of dark energy and was named the top science breakthrough of 1998 by &quot;Science&quot; magazine. In 2011, Brian P. Schmidt shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Saul Perlmutter and Adam Riess for such observations which provided evidence for the accelerating Universe.

The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, co-led by Matthew Colless, undertook the largest galaxy redshift survey of its time, and was conducted at the Anglo-Australian Observatory (AAO) with the 3.9m Anglo-Australian Telescope between 1997 and 11 April 2002. In total, the survey measured more than 245,000 galaxies, providing, along with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the definitive measurements of large scale structure in the low-redshift Universe.

==Advanced instrumentation==
The instrumentation group at Mount Stromlo Observatory has built two instruments for the Gemini Telescope. This includes the near infrared integral field spectrometer, NIFS, deployed on Gemini-North, and the adaptive optics imager for Gemini-South, GSAOI. NIFS, when nearly completed, was destroyed in the bushfires of 18 January 2003, and rebuilt.

A new rapid survey telescope, SkyMapper, was completed in 2014. SkyMapper resides at the ANU&#x27;s other observatory (Siding Spring) and can be operated remotely from Mount Stromlo.

Mount Stromlo hosts a DORIS (geodesy) earth station installed by France&#x27;s CNES.

==Location==
Mount Stromlo Observatory is located at an altitude of 770 metres above sea level on Mount Stromlo. Situated west of the centre of Canberra, near the district of Weston Creek. Canberra&#x27;s main water supply treatment plant is located nearby.

== Engineering heritage award ==
The observatory received an Engineering Heritage International Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.

== IEEE Special Citation ==
The observatory received an IEEE Special Citation from IEEE as part of its IEEE Milestone Program.

<text>The Cirrus SR20 is an American piston-engined, four- or five-seat composite monoplane built since 1999 by Cirrus Aircraft of Duluth, Minnesota. The aircraft is the company&#x27;s earliest type-certified model, earning certification in 1998.

It was the first production general aviation (GA) aircraft equipped with a parachute to lower the airplane safely to the ground after a loss of control, structural failure, or midair collision. The SR series was also the first mass-manufactured light aircraft with all-composite construction and flat-panel avionics.

The SR20 was developed into the Cirrus SR22, which was introduced in 2001 and is the most-produced GA aircraft of the 21st century.

==Design and development==


The SR20 mock-up was unveiled in 1994. The aircraft first flew on 21 March 1995 and FAA certification was achieved on 23 October 1998. At the time of the airplane&#x27;s release, the GA industry was struggling; the SR20 was one of the first of its kind to earn FAA Part 23 certification in several years. 
Over a thousand SR20s have been sold since deliveries began in July 1999. From 1999 to 2015, more than 6,000 SR-series aircraft had been delivered, something that no other aviation company had accomplished for the last half-century.

One of the major selling points for the SR20 is its Garmin Cirrus Perspective avionics suite with dual or screens: one primary flight display (PFD) and one multifunction display (MFD), first introduced by the company in May 2008. This provides all standard communication, navigation (GPS and conventional VHF), and surveillance (Mode S transponder) functions. Other avionics features include in-flight weather information and TCAS-like traffic information.

SR20s made from 1999 to 2003 were equipped with traditional analog instruments and a 10&quot; MFD. In July 2003, Cirrus made Avidyne Entegra PFDs standard on the SR20 and faster SR22, pioneering the use of glass cockpits in the light aircraft GA industry.

The SR-series remains the only airplane in its class to include side-stick flight controls that combine aspects of a traditional yoke handle (this has been referred to in the industry as a &quot;side yoke&quot;).

The SR20 and SR22 are equipped with the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS), a large parachute that can be deployed in an emergency to lower the entire aircraft to the ground safely.

On 1 June 2004, the SR20 became the first aircraft to achieve the new European Aviation Safety Agency certificate for aircraft imported into the European Union.

In 2004, Cirrus introduced the SR20 G2 (Generation 2) and in 2008, the SR20 G3 (Generation 3). Both were defined by airframe modifications, G2 by fuselage and G3 by wing/landing gear changes.

In 2012, &quot;60/40 flex seating&quot; was introduced, allowing up to three passengers in the rear with a split fold-down seat arrangement. This five-seat configuration was optional in 2012, but became standard equipment for 2013 SR20 models.

In 2016, Cirrus introduced enhancements to the SR series, including Bluetooth wireless connectivity, a remote keyless entry, a convenience lighting system, and a new easy-access door latch, among other interior and exterior improvements.

In 2017, the company introduced the SR20 G6 (Generation 6), with several upgrades to the avionics, new navigation lights, and an increased useful load.

In September 2019, Cirrus unveiled the TRAC, a training-oriented version of the SR20, with a simplified interior, more durable seat material, backseat radio transmit switch to allow an observer to communicate with air traffic control, electronic stability and protection system, integrated engine indication and crew alerting/warning systems, and simulated retractable landing gear controls and position lights to allow cadets and instructors to feign landing-gear operation and failures during instructional flights (the actual landing gear remains permanently fixed).

In January 2020, the company introduced a new mobile application for the SR series, called &quot;Cirrus IQ&quot;, which enables remote aircraft communication including access to preflight status information such as fuel and oxygen levels, battery voltage, oil temperature, aircraft location, and flight hours. Upgrades also included a new stabilized approach-advisory system for the flight deck. In January 2022, speed and aesthetic improvements were added to the G6 SR-series, with a increased cruise speed, upgrades to the mobile IQ app, USB-A and USB-C charging ports and more.

In January 2024, the company announced the SR20 G7 (Generation 7), with a major overhaul to the interior and avionics, making it more comparable to the cockpit of a Cirrus Vision Jet, as well as safety and engine-start improvements and an automatic fuel selection system.

==Operational history==

In 2011, the accident records of the SR20 and -22 were the subject of a detailed examination by &quot;Aviation Consumer&quot; magazine. The review concluded that the series has an overall accident record that is better than average for light aircraft, exceeded only by the Diamond DA40 and DA42. However, its fatal accident rate is much worse at 1.6/100,000 hours, placing it higher than the U.S. general aviation rate of 1.2 and higher than the Diamond DA40 (0.35), Cessna 172 (0.45), Diamond DA42 (0.54), Cessna 182 (0.69), and Cessna 400 (1.0), despite the Cirrus&#x27;s CAPS.

By 2014, the accident rate had been dramatically reduced, with a 2013 fatal rate of 1.01 per 100,000 flight hours. This was attributed to better training, particularly in when to deploy the ballistic parachute system.

By 2015, the accident rate had continued to decrease, with a 2014 fatal rate of 0.42 per 100,000 flight hours, making it one of the best safety records in the industry. This marked the fewest fatalities in a single year for Cirrus since 2001, and the first year where the number of CAPS deployments (12) exceeded the number of fatal accidents (3).

As of September 2018, the SR-series has had its parachute system deployed 79 times, with 163 survivors.

==Variants==
;SR20 
:Original version produced from 1999
;SR20 G2
:Improved variant introduced in 2004, including Avidyne Entegra avionics

;SRV
:Introduced at the 2003 EAA AirVenture Convention and brought to market in 2004, the Cirrus SRV was a VFR-only version of the SR20 for the low-end private ownership and flight-training market. As such, it omitted some standard equipment available on the SR20 such as wheel fairings. For 2008, the SRV model was updated to G3 configuration, with the SR22 wing. Cirrus discontinued the SRV for the 2010 model year.

;SR20 G3
:Introduced in 2007, the G3 has a lighter wing of greater area, incorporating a carbon-fiber spar. The new wing increased the SR20&#x27;s cruise speed by . The G3 also added a increased useful load by increasing the take-off weight to , a redesigned main landing gear that is 2 inches (5 cm) taller, giving greater propeller and tail clearance, improved aircraft handling due to increased dihedral, improved aerodynamics including new wing root fairings, LED recognition lights, improved heat and ventilation, dual-redundant GPS WAAS-certified Garmin GNS 430W comm-navigators (that include a VHF radio and a VOR/LOC/ILS receiver) and an S-Tec Autopilot.
;T-53A
:In 2011, the SR20 was selected for cadet flight training with the 557th Flying Training Squadron at the United States Air Force Academy and given an Air Force model/design/series (MDS) designation as the T-53A. Twenty-five examples were to be purchased to replace the academy&#x27;s current stock of 20 leased T-52As by May 2012, and included new features such as Cirrus Perspective avionics (by Garmin) as well as airbag seat belts.

;SR20 G6

==Accidents and incidents==
Between 1999 and September 2022, the SR20 was involved in 40 known fatal accidents. Listed below are some of the most notable ones.

*On March 23, 1999, Duluth native Scott D. Anderson was killed in a plane crash while flight-testing the first production model SR20 before it went on sale. Anderson was a pilot, author, engineer, and adventurer who served as chief test pilot at Cirrus in the mid- to late 1990s, performing all the in-flight test deployments of the CAPS. His plane, which had not yet been equipped with CAPS, experienced an aileron jam during experimental stress-testing and went down in a field near the Duluth International Airport. Anderson was posthumously inducted into the Minnesota Aviation Hall of Fame in 2010.

*On October 11, 2006, New York Yankees pitcher Cory Lidle and certified flight instructor Tyler Stanger were killed in the 2006 New York City plane crash when their SR20 crashed into the Belaire Apartments located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The aircraft struck the north side of the building, causing a fire in several apartments. The accident resulted from a combination of high winds and pilot error.

North Pole is located in Adirondack Park at the northern edge of Essex County near Whiteface Mountain, 12 miles (19 km) from Lake Placid and approximately 30 miles (48 km) from Plattsburgh.

Fitting with the name of the hamlet, North Pole is one of the best places in the Northeast for snow. According to historical weather data that has been gathered at Tupper Lake every year since 1948, there&#x27;s a 96% chance of some amount of snow for Christmas.

== Demographics ==
The United States Census Bureau treated North Pole as part of a larger area including Lake Placid, NY for its 2000 census figures. Out of 8,098 people in the region, 1,444 are under 18, 1,072 are age 65 or over, 87% are White and 10.7% are African American.

North Pole does not have its own bank, school, library, fire department, newspaper, police station or community organizations and most local businesses have closed their doors. North Pole has a small community postal station at 201 Main St, which is open only on a seasonal basis.

== Media ==
In 1954, Burlington/Plattsburgh-market NBC affiliate WPTZ (channel 5) was licensed to North Pole at the time of its sign-on (as WIRI). In 1999 the station petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to reallocate its broadcast frequency (now on digital channel 14) to Plattsburgh, on the grounds that the hamlet has always been small and continues to lose population, with only four houses remaining near North Pole&#x27;s main crossroads.

While the station&#x27;s studios were built on Television Drive in Plattsburgh, that lakeside city is low-lying ground relative to the surrounding Adirondack Mountains. The station&#x27;s analog broadcast transmitter had therefore been situated upon a mountaintop near North Pole, operating from this location until 2009. While WPTZ&#x27;s digital UHF TV transmitter facilities are now located atop Mount Mansfield, Vermont, alongside WCAX-TV and other broadcasters in the region, the station&#x27;s license (and therefore the on-air station ID) remained in North Pole until January 5, 2011, when the FCC approved WPTZ&#x27;s request and formally moved its license to Plattsburgh.

== Tourism ==
North Pole, New York&#x27;s main attraction is the amusement park Santa&#x27;s Workshop on Whiteface Mountain Memorial Highway, Route 431.

<text>North Sydney railway station is a suburban railway station located on the North Shore line, serving the Sydney suburb of North Sydney. It is served by Sydney Trains&#x27; T1 North Shore Line and T9 Northern Line services.

==History==
North Sydney station opened on 20 March 1932 at the same time as the North Shore line over the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Prior to the bridge&#x27;s opening, North Shore line trains had diverged from the current line at Waverton to the original Milsons Point station at Lavender Bay.

The station was built in a rock cutting with a street level overhead concourse above the platforms. The station has four platforms which correspond with the four railway tracks that were designed to cross the Sydney Harbour Bridge. At the Waverton end of the station there are four tunnels which have been cut into the rock. Unused tunnel stubs of 260 metres for proposed lines to Newport and Northbridge were cut at the same time with Chief Design Engineer John Bradfield calculating that without these, later construction of these lines would interfere with the North Shore line.

From 1932 until 1958, two of the rail tracks designed for the bridge were used by trams, the latter being diverted onto Blue Street just before they would have entered North Sydney Station. After 1958 the tram tracks were removed from the Sydney Harbour Bridge and replaced by the Cahill Expressway.

Beginning in 1968 when the North Sydney Travelodge was built, the air rights over the station have progressively been redeveloped. In December 1972, the awning over platforms 3 and 4 was demolished. The station became totally enclosed with the opening of Zurich Insurance House in 1984.

===Upgrade===
Between April 2006 and December 2008, the station was upgraded to handle extra traffic expected with the opening of the Epping to Chatswood line in 2009. The work included an expanded concourse and the installation of escalators and lifts.

==Services==
===Platforms===
The four platforms at North Sydney can have different usages, but the outer platforms are generally the only ones used in off-peak; the middle platforms generally serve terminating trains arriving from the city. Because the four platforms at North Sydney serve a double track railway to the north and south of the station, it has significant capacity for terminating traffic.

The line north through the tunnel from Platform 3 was not laid until 1992 and commissioned in August 1993. The tunnel roads serving platforms 2 and 3 both have a 10 km/h speed limit and are occasionally used by passenger services.
===Transport links===

<doc id="1035992" wikidata="Q208229" url="?curid=1035992" title="Vasyl Ivanchuk">
<text>Vasyl Mykhailovych Ivanchuk (; born March 18, 1969), is a Ukrainian chess grandmaster. He was awarded the title of Grandmaster by FIDE in 1988. A leading chess player since 1988, Ivanchuk has been ranked at No. 2 on the FIDE world rankings three times (July 1991, July 1992, October 2007).

Ivanchuk has won Linares, Wijk aan Zee, Tal Memorial, Gibraltar Masters and M-Tel Masters titles. He has also won the World Blitz Championship in 2007 and the World Rapid Championship in 2016.

==Career==

===Early years===
Ivanchuk was born in Kopychyntsi, Ukraine. He won the 1987 European Junior Chess Championship in Groningen and first achieved international notice by winning the 1988 New York Open scoring 7½/9 points, ahead of a field of grandmasters. He tied for first place in the 1988 World Junior Chess Championship at Adelaide, but lost the title on tiebreak to Joël Lautier. He was awarded the Grandmaster title in 1988, and entered the world top 10 the same year.

===Reaches world elite===
Ivanchuk attained chess world fame in 1991 at the age of 21 when he won the Linares tournament. Fourteen players participated, eight of them, including World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov, rated in the top ten in the world, and another two among the world&#x27;s top 50 players. Ivanchuk beat Kasparov by a half point, defeating Kasparov in their head-to-head game.

It was widely believed that Ivanchuk might become world champion. He came close in 2002, when he reached the final of the FIDE World Chess Championship 2002. Ivanchuk consistently ranked among the top 10 from July 1988 to October 2002 and among the top 20 up to June 2009, but Mark Crowther&#x27;s &quot;The Week in Chess&quot; said his erratic play was due to &quot;poor temperament.&quot; His results saw him drop as low as 30th in July 2009, but he returned to the top ten in the next list. His inability to become world champion despite his immense talent and longevity has been attributed to his admittedly poor nerves, demonstrated by blunders such as at the 1994 London Grand Prix blitz, when he failed to complete a strong attack on Viswanathan Anand with a mate in one despite having 0:54 left on the clock. Ivanchuk&#x27;s nerves were notably exposed during the high-tension atmosphere of World Championship match-format tournaments, such as in 2002 where he was heavily favored in the FIDE championship final after having defeated defending champion Anand in the semifinals, only to lose to countryman Ruslan Ponomariov in a major upset, denying him the championship. Subsequent match-play tournaments in World Championship cycles saw Ivanchuk consistently underperform; in the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004, Chess World Cup 2005, Chess World Cup 2007, and Chess World Cup 2009, he failed to advance past the third round despite being seeded No. 5, No. 1, No. 1 and No. 6 respectively in those events.

Ivanchuk&#x27;s world championship aspirations were also dampened by the title split from 1993 to 2006. Due to obligations with FIDE, Ivanchuk and Anand did not participate in the 2002 Dortmund Candidates tournament for the Classical World Chess Championship 2004. He was then narrowly excluded, on the basis of rating, from the rival FIDE World Chess Championship 2005. While he won one of the events of the FIDE Grand Prix 2008–2010, his overall performance was not enough to qualify him for the World Chess Championship 2012 candidates tournament.

===Since 2013===
Ivanchuk played in the 2013 Candidates Tournament, which took place in London, from 15 March to 1 April. He finished seventh, with a score of +3−5=6. The tournament was notable for his unusually poor time management (he lost two games on time), as well as his major impact on the leaderboard despite being a tail ender: he managed to defeat both leaders Magnus Carlsen (round 12) and Vladimir Kramnik (round 14), resulting in Carlsen qualifying for the World Chess Championship by tiebreak.

In 2016, Ivanchuk won the World Rapid Chess Championship in Doha, Qatar, with a score of 11/15. He defeated Carlsen, among many others.

In July 2016, Ivanchuk began playing checkers and has achieved a certain level of success. In the World Draughts Federation&#x27;s database, he achieved his peak rating of 1997 in July 2019, and his peak ranking at No. 1089 in October 2021.

== Playing style ==
Vasyl Ivanchuk is possessing of a unique and daring playing style consisting of extraordinary creativity fused with high-level technical play, often leading to considerable inbalances. Ivanchuk is well known for his imaginative play, seemingly breaking all principles with sudden sacrifices consisting of deep and immense calculation rather than material balances. The sharp contrast of Ivanchuk creating a narrow path, a path only fit for one to prevail and enter through.

Ivanchuk is regarded by his peers and many observers as a chess genius. Kasparov explained in an interview that Ivanchuk had a level equivalent to that of a world champion although he had never been one.

== Assessment and personality ==

In 2013, Gawain Jones called Ivanchuk &quot;possibly the most talented [player] ever&quot;. When asked in 2012 to name chess players she considered geniuses, Judit Polgár named only Ivanchuk, Carlsen and Anand.

Anand has called Ivanchuk the most eccentric player in the chess world, and has said:

He&#x27;s someone who is very intelligent ... but you never know which mood he is going to be in. Some days he will treat you like his long-lost brother. The next day he ignores you completely.

The players have a word for him. They say he lives on &quot;Planet Ivanchuk&quot;. [Laughs] ... I have seen him totally drunk and singing Ukrainian poetry and then the next day I have seen him give an impressive talk.

His playing style is unpredictable and highly original, making him more dangerous but sometimes leading to quick losses as well.

From the &quot;Mammoth Book of The World&#x27;s Greatest Chess Games&quot;:
If he were able to make the most of his talent, he would surely be a real contender for the World No. 1 spot, but he is a highly emotional player, who takes losses badly, tends to rush critical decisions when under pressure and sometimes lacks motivation.

Ivanchuk played board 1 for Ukraine in the 2008 Chess Olympiad in Dresden, Germany. Going into the last round, Ukraine was second with decent chances of placing first, and only a strong loss against a 10th-seeded U.S. would leave them without a medal. Ivanchuk was chosen to be tested for illegal substances in his system immediately after the last round. But in a major upset, Ivanchuk lost his game against Gata Kamsky, causing Ukraine to fall to fourth and miss out on a medal. U.S. defeated Ukraine 3½ to ½. Ivanchuk was so distraught after the game that he was seen &quot;kicking a large concrete pillar&quot;. He refused to take a doping test and stormed out, risking punishment under FIDE rules and forfeiting his games in the event as had happened in the 2004 Chess Olympiad in Majorca. Ivanchuk was cleared when it emerged that he had not been warned of the test, and that in his distraught frame of mind, he had not fully understood the arbiter&#x27;s request.

After a string of unsuccessful performances culminated in his elimination at the early stages of the 2009 World Cup, Ivanchuk announced, in a highly emotional interview, his retirement from professional chess, but he soon reversed that decision.

<doc id="1035996" wikidata="Q1939314" url="?curid=1035996" title="Mr. Magoo">
<text>Quincy Magoo, better known as Mr. Magoo, is a fictional cartoon character created at the UPA animation studio in 1949. Voiced by Jim Backus, Mr. Magoo is an elderly, wealthy, short-statured retiree who gets into a series of comical situations as a result of his extreme near-sightedness, compounded by his stubborn refusal to admit the problem. However, through uncanny streaks of luck, the situation always seems to work itself out for him, leaving him no worse than before. Bystanders consequently tend to think that he is a lunatic, rather than just being near-sighted. In later cartoons, he is also an actor, and generally a competent one, except for his visual impairment.

&quot;Magoo&quot; episodes were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film four times, and received the award twice, for &quot;When Magoo Flew&quot; (1954) and &quot;Magoo&#x27;s Puddle Jumper&quot; (1956).

In 2002, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked Mr. Magoo number 29 on its &quot;50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time&quot; list.

==History==
Mr. Magoo&#x27;s first appearance was in the theatrical short cartoon &quot;The Ragtime Bear&quot; (1949), scripted by Millard Kaufman. His creation was a collaborative effort; animation director John Hubley is said to have partly based the character on his uncle Harry Woodruff, and W. C. Fields was another source of inspiration. Columbia was reluctant to release the short, but did so, only because it included a bear. The usage of the titular ursine paid off, as Magoo became a notable human breakout amongst the much more prominent anthropomorphic animal cartoon characters of his contemporary, alongside his debut short being a box-office success.

The Magoo character was originally conceived as a mean-spirited reactionary. Hubley, who had created Magoo, handed the series completely over to creative director Pete Burness. Under Burness, Magoo won two Academy Awards for the studio with &quot;When Magoo Flew&quot; (1954) and &quot;Magoo&#x27;s Puddle Jumper&quot; (1956). Burness scrubbed Magoo of his meanness and left only a few strange comments that made him appear senile or somewhat mad. At the same time, art director Sterling Sturtevant redesigned the character&#x27;s appearance. Magoo was frequently accompanied in his on-screen escapades with his nephew Waldo, voiced at various times by either Jerry Hausner or Daws Butler.

In 1957, the record album &quot;Magoo in Hi-Fi&quot; was released. Side 1 consisted of a dialogue between Magoo and Waldo taking place while Magoo was attempting to set up his new sound system. Music on the album was composed and conducted by Dennis Farnon and his orchestra. Side 2, &quot;The Mother Magoo Suite&quot;, was a series of musical pieces which included two solos by Marni Nixon.

In 1959, Mr. Magoo starred in &quot;1001 Arabian Nights&quot;, directed by Jack Kinney, UPA&#x27;s first feature-length production.

In 1994, a Sega Mega Drive game starring Mr. Magoo was in development and planned to be published by Millennium Interactive but never released.

In 1997, the live-action comedy film &quot;Mr. Magoo&quot;, produced by Walt Disney Pictures and starring Leslie Nielsen as the title character, was released in December to overwhelmingly negative critical reception.

In 2010, a direct-to-video action-comedy film based on the character, &quot;Kung Fu Magoo&quot;, was released on DVD on May 11, 2010. It features the voices of Jim Conroy, Chris Parnell, Dylan and Cole Sprouse, and Alyson Stoner. The film is a Mexican–American co-production, produced by Classic Media, Ánima Estudios, and Santo Domingo Films. The film was directed by Andrés Couturier. His most recent appearance was in DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s &quot;The Boss Baby&quot;, where he briefly appears on the cover of a comic book.

==On television and in popular culture==

In the 1960s, UPA turned its attention to television and began producing the series &quot;Mister Magoo&quot; for the character. Because UPA had shut down its animation studio in 1959, the animation for these cartoons was done by Jack Kinney Productions and Larry Harmon Pictures. The cartoons suffered from varying character designs and choppier animation, due to rushed production schedules. Magoo&#x27;s nephew Waldo (voiced, as in most of the theatrical cartoons, by Jerry Hausner) was seldom seen with his uncle, now appearing in his own episodes, introduced by a brief phone conversation from Magoo&#x27;s point of view, which acted as a teaser. The Waldo episodes also featured a slick-talking con man named Prezly, and they always ended with a return to Magoo saying, &quot;Oh, that Waldo and Prezly. What&#x27;ll they be up to next? Hee hee hee!&quot;

Magoo&#x27;s houseboy Cholly (i.e., &quot;Charlie&quot;) took up a lot of Waldo&#x27;s slack. Cholly was an Asian stereotype with huge buck teeth and fractured English pronunciation.

Still other cartoons featured Tycoon Magoo, voiced by Mel Blanc, and his bumbling assistant Worcestershire.

During the UPA television era came &quot;Mister Magoo&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, an abbreviated but largely faithful retelling of Charles Dickens&#x27; tale. It was the first ever animated Christmas special made for television and the first hour-long animated TV special and is considered to be a holiday classic of the 1960s, ranking alongside &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; and &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot;. The special inspired the production of an animated TV series titled &quot;The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo&quot;, which placed Magoo as an actor in other well-known stories. After an introduction in Magoo&#x27;s backstage dressing room, Magoo was depicted in such roles as &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, Merlin in an upbeat retelling of the story of King Arthur, Friar Tuck in &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, and Puck in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

In 1970, Mr. Magoo starred as Uncle Sam in the TV special &quot;Uncle Sam Magoo&quot;.

In the late 1970s, Mr. Magoo appeared in a new Saturday morning CBS television series called &quot;What&#x27;s New, Mr. Magoo?&quot; This series was made under license by the DePatie–Freleng studio, as UPA had by this time ceased in-house cartoon production.

Mr. Magoo was planned to have a cameo in the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, but this was dropped for unknown reasons.

Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Weinerville&quot; anthologizes most of his shorts.

In 1997, Mr. Magoo was portrayed by Leslie Nielsen in a live-action &quot;Mr. Magoo&quot; feature film. It failed to find critical or popular success, and some support groups for the disabled, including the National Federation of the Blind, protested it on behalf of the blind and sight-impaired.

A Mexican-U.S. animated feature, &quot;Kung-Fu Magoo&quot;, was released as a direct-to-DVD release in 2010 and made its TV debut on Disney XD in 2011.

Mr. Magoo helped advertise the General Electric line of products throughout the 1950s and 1960s, sometimes under the name Quincy Magoo. In 2005, Mr. Magoo became the spokesman of the optical retail store Sterling Optical. Magoo also was featured in a series of commercials for Stag Beer in the 1960s. Also in the 1960s, the Polaner company sold its line of preserves in jars decorated with images of Mr. Magoo which, when empty, could then be used as drinking glasses.

ASI Entertainment has used Mr. Magoo cartoons to &quot;warm up&quot; audiences when testing television comedy pilots.

Mr. Magoo is an alumnus of Rutgers University, Class of 1928. The reason behind this is that his creators wanted him to be &quot;a college alumnus who was still fired up with the old school spirit [and they felt] Rutgers was the embodiment of the &#x27;old school tie&#x27; in America.&quot;. He was definitely in a fraternity, since he would often shout out, &quot;Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Rho – Rutgers, Rutgers, Go – Go – Go!&quot;

In 2012, Mr. Magoo appeared in MetLife&#x27;s &quot;Everyone&quot; commercial during Super Bowl XLVI.

Another television series, simply titled &quot;Mr. Magoo&quot;, began airing in 2018. Produced by the company Xilam, this series depicts a younger looking Magoo and his pet dog named Mr. Cat (because it meows), who replaces McBarker, the dog depicted in earlier cartoons. An antagonist is added in the form of a hamster named Fizz and his human assistant named Weasel.

==Characters==
* Mr. Quincy Magoo (voiced by Jim Backus) – An elderly man whose eyesight is failing, although he either does not know it or is too stubborn to admit it and/or do anything about it. His catchphrase, usually said by him as his closing line, is: &quot;Oh Magoo, you&#x27;ve done it again.&quot;
* Waldo (voiced by Jerry Hausner from 1949 to 1955 and in the 1960s series, Daws Butler from 1956 to 1959 and on the 1957 record album &quot;Magoo in Hi-Fi&quot;, and Casey Kasem in the 1970s series) – Mr. Magoo&#x27;s nephew.
* Bowser - Mr. Magoo&#x27;s dog (actually a Siamese cat) in the 1960s cartoons.
* McBarker (voiced by Bob Ogle) – Mr. Magoo&#x27;s dog in the 1970s cartoon series &quot;What&#x27;s New, Mr. Magoo?&quot; A talking white Bulldog, he shares his owner&#x27;s facial features and poor eyesight.
* Mother Magoo (voiced first by Henny Backus in &quot;Meet Mother Magoo&quot; (1956), then June Foray) – Mr. Magoo&#x27;s &quot;Momma&quot;, Linda.
* Grandma &quot;Granny&quot; Magoo.
* Charlie (voiced by Benny Rubin) – Mr. Magoo&#x27;s houseboy. Charlie&#x27;s depiction as an Asian stereotype was controversial. The character was prone to unusual misuses of English, such as referring to himself in the third person as &quot;Cholly&quot;, and calling Mr. Magoo &quot;Missuh Magloo&quot; and &quot;Bloss&quot; instead of &quot;Boss&quot;. In the late 1960s, episodes featuring Charlie were dropped from the series and his character was never seen, referred to or even mentioned again. A version of the series that runs on the Christian network KTV retains Charlie, but dubs over his ethnic-sounding voice track.
* Prezly (voiced by Daws Butler) – Waldo&#x27;s &quot;partner in crime&quot; in the 1960s cartoons.
* Wheeler and Dealer – Two children Mr. Magoo occasionally babysits in &quot;The Mister Magoo Show&quot; (1960–1961).
* Tycoon Magoo (voiced by Mel Blanc) – Mr. Magoo&#x27;s rich uncle. His catchphrase is &quot;Worcestershire, get in here!&quot;
* Worcestershire (voiced by Mel Blanc) – Tycoon Magoo&#x27;s butler, who is always trying to prevent Mr. Magoo from ruining Tycoon Magoo&#x27;s property.
* Additional character voices were provided by Paul Frees, Frank Nelson and Mel Blanc, among others.

==Theatrical cartoon shorts==

The following Mr. Magoo cartoons were either nominees for, or recipients of, the Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons):
*1950: &quot;Trouble Indemnity&quot;
*1952: &quot;Pink and Blue Blues&quot;
*1954: &quot;When Magoo Flew&quot; (winner)
*1956: &quot;Magoo&#x27;s Puddle Jumper&quot; (winner)

==Home media==
On February 8, 2005, Sony BMG Music Entertainment’s former kids and family entertainment division, Sony Wonder (under license from Classic Media) released &quot;The Mr. Magoo Show: Complete DVD Collection&quot;. This four-disc set featured all 26 uncut episodes of the 1960 series, digitally remastered from original film prints and presented in its original broadcast presentation and order, as well as bonus features. This release has been discontinued and is now out of print.

On November 8, 2011, Shout! Factory (under license from Classic Media) released &quot;Mr. Magoo: The Television Collection 1960–1977&quot; on DVD in Region 1. This 11-disc collection contains all the episodes from all three Mr. Magoo television series, including all 26 episodes of &quot;The Mister Magoo Show&quot;, all 26 episodes of &quot;The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo&quot;, all 16 episodes of &quot;What&#x27;s New, Mister Magoo?&quot;, and the prime-time TV special &quot;Uncle Sam Magoo&quot;, as well as several bonus features.

<doc id="1036000" wikidata="Q5470869" url="?curid=1036000" title="Fort Burgoyne">
<text>Fort Burgoyne, originally known as Castle Hill Fort, was built in the 1860s as one of the Palmerston forts around Dover in southeast England. It was built to a polygonal system with detached eastern and western redoubts, to guard the high ground northeast of the strategic port of Dover, just north of Dover Castle. The fort is named after the 19th century Field Marshal Sir John Fox Burgoyne, Inspector-General of Fortifications and son of the John Burgoyne who fought in the American Revolutionary War.

After the First World War Fort Burgoyne was used as a military depot or store for Connaught Barracks. Until recently the central part of the fort was still owned by the Ministry of Defence, forming part of the Connaught Barracks site, which is now being redeveloped for housing.

In 2014, Fort Burgoyne and a total of 42 Hectares of land was acquired by the Land Trust. Since acquiring the site the Trust has spent over £2.5 million on priority works (informed by a Coastal Revival Fund grant aided condition survey) to stabilise the site together with transforming the West Wing Battery of the site from condition of derelict buildings and structures lost in woodland to an informal recreation space for the community opened in 2023.

As part of the Trust&#x27;s long term aspiration to see the Fort become a vibrant business and community space in 2023 a project was completed providing opportunities for businesses to become the first tenants on site.

== Community Participation ==

Since acquiring the Fort, the Land Trust has sought to promote public engagement and participation with the site. While the condition of Fort Burgoyne is such that access to the site is for events only, building a relationship with the community is seen as vital for the future success of the site.

In partnership with White Cliffs Countryside Partnership, the Fort hosts a weekly volunteer group, education visits, and children&#x27;s activities. The Land Trust &#x27;Green Angels&#x27; training programme also runs a number of courses on site annually.

As part of the West Wing Battery transformation project, a 2 week community archaeology dig was undertaken to inform proposals for landscaping works.

The Fort has hosted Dover Armed Forces Weekend in 2022 and 2023 together with community events on fields surrounding the main Fort area. An annual wildlife family funday provides an opportunity for visitors to witness both the historic and wildlife value of Fort Burgoyne.

On the 29 February 2020, Fort Burgoyne was opened to the public for a day. The event was called Waking the Giant and was run by Albion Inc, as part of a commission for Pioneering Places East Kent funded by National Lottery Heritage Fund and Arts Council Great Places programme to map out the future uses of the fort. The event featured: The Museum Of British Folklore, Weaving &amp; Knitting by Robert George Sanders &amp; Katherine Woodward, Blacksmithing by Michael Hart, Ceramics by Ceramic Art Dover &amp; Keith Brymer-Jones, A showing of the film &quot;Fortopia&quot; By Matt Rowe, a demo of the virtual reality game &quot;Escape&quot; created by Jake Price, A presentation of future fort use by Central St. Martins, A Makers Market by Future Foundry and Food &amp; Drink by The White Cliffs &amp; Real Deal Roasters.

<text>The [[Visual Studio]] Industry Partner (VSIP) Program (formerly Visual Studio Integration Program) allows third-party developers and software vendors to develop tools, components and languages for use in the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET IDE. The program offers partnership benefits including co-marketing opportunities, and Visual Studio licensing options as well as extended access to Microsoft technical and premier support.

The VSIP SDK (software development kit) facilitates development of integrated tools and includes development software and documentation that can be used within the Visual Studio .NET IDE directly. Extensions to the IDE, also known as &quot;Add-ins&quot;, can be as simple as adding a custom server control to the toolbox, or as complex as adding support for a new CLR-compliant language.

Visual Studio Express is limited and does not support third-party extensions.

<doc id="1036008" wikidata="Q11481625" url="?curid=1036008" title="Hugs and kisses">
<text>Hugs and kisses, abbreviated in the Anglosphere as XO or XOXO, is an informal term used for expressing sincerity, faith, love, or good friendship at the end of a written letter, email or text message.

== Origins ==
The earliest attestation of the use of either &quot;x&quot; or &quot;o&quot; to indicate kisses identified by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; appears in the English novellist Florence Montgomery&#x27;s 1878 book &quot;Seaforth&quot;, which mentions &quot;This letter [...] ends with the inevitable row of kisses,—sometimes expressed by × × × × ×, and sometimes by o o o o o o, according to the taste of the young scribbler&quot;. Here it appears that &quot;x&quot; and &quot;o&quot; are both ways to indicate a kiss. (Earlier versions of the dictionary identified an example from 1763, one Gil. White signing off a letter with &quot;I am with many a xxxxxxx and many a Pater noster and Ave Maria, Gil. White&quot;. This has, however, since been reinterpreted as an indication of blessings rather than kisses, perhaps evoking the Christian sign of the cross.)

Unfortunately, nothing more is known about the origins of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;o&quot; meaning &#x27;hugs&#x27; or &#x27;kisses&#x27;. A 2014 article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that drew on interviews with scholars noted that &quot;the Internet abounds with origin theories&quot; yet that &quot;there is no definitive answer to how a cross came to mean a kiss&quot; and even that &quot;less is known about how &#x27;o&#x27; came to signify a hug&quot;.

Speculations include that the use of &quot;x&quot; to indicate a kiss was transferred from earlier symbolic uses of the letter. Allegedly, in the Middle Ages, a Christian cross might be drawn on documents or letters to mean sincerity, faith, and honesty; the sign was certainly sometimes used in place of a signature. Unscholarly speculations sometimes extend to the idea that after a cross was written at the end of a document, the writer might kiss it as a show of their sincerity. The Greek word for Christ, &quot;ΧΡΙΣΤΟΣ&quot;, gave rise to the practice of using the Latin letter &quot;X&quot; as an abbreviation for &#x27;Christ&#x27; (similar to the more elaborate Chi Rho symbol). Supposedly, this was then kissed in this tradition of displaying a sacred oath.

There is speculation on the Internet that the &#x27;O&#x27; is of North American descent: when arriving in the United States, Jewish immigrants, most of whose first language was Yiddish, would use an &#x27;O&#x27; to sign documents, thus not using the sign of the cross, and shop keepers would often use an &#x27;O&#x27; when signing documents, in place of an &#x27;X&#x27;.

<text>Sandgate Castle is an artillery fort originally constructed by Henry VIII in Sandgate in Kent, between 1539 and 1540. It formed part of the King&#x27;s Device programme to protect England against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended a vulnerable point along the coast. It comprised a central stone keep, with three towers and a gatehouse. It could hold four tiers of artillery, and was fitted with a total of 142 firing points for cannon and handguns.

Sandgate was taken by Parliament in 1642 at the start of the first English Civil War, and was seized by Royalist rebels in the second civil war of 1648. The castle was extensively redesigned between 1805 and 1808 during the Napoleonic Wars. The height of the castle was significantly reduced and the keep was turned into a Martello tower; when the work was completed, it was armed with ten 24-pounder (11 kg) guns and could hold a garrison of 40 men.

The castle had begun to suffer damage from the sea by the early 17th century, and by the middle of the 19th century, the receding coastline had reached the edge of the castle walls. The high costs of repair contributed to the government&#x27;s decision to sell the site off in 1888. It was initially bought by a railway company and then passed into private ownership.

Coastal erosion continued and by the 1950s, the southern part of the castle had been destroyed by the sea. The remaining castle was restored between 1975 and 1979 by Peter and Barbara McGregor, who turned the keep into a private residence. In the 21st century, Sandgate remains in private ownership, and is protected under UK law as a grade I listed building.

==History==

===16th century===

Sandgate Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities, only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely. Modest defences, based around simple blockhouses and towers, existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale.

In 1533, Henry broke with Pope Paul III in order to annul the long-standing marriage to his wife, Catherine of Aragon and remarry. Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, and he took the annulment as a personal insult. This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England. An invasion of England appeared certain. In response, Henry issued an order, called a &quot;device&quot;, in 1539, giving instructions for the &quot;defence of the realm in time of invasion&quot; and the construction of forts along the English coastline.

Sandgate was intended to defend a vulnerable point along the Kent cliffs, just west of Folkestone, where an enemy force could potentially land and make their way easily further inland. Sandgate&#x27;s construction was supervised by the Moravian engineer Stefan von Haschenperg, and Thomas Cockys and Richard Keys acted as commissioners for the project. In the initial stages of the work in 1539, a team of 237 men were employed, with masons, quarrymen, limeburners and wood fellers preparing the site; the masons were drawn from as far away as Somerset and Gloucestershire. By the summer, over 500 were at work, including labourers, bricklayers, carpenters and sawyers. After a pause during the winter months, work picked up again in the summer of the next year, with 630 working on the castle that July.

The castle&#x27;s foundations rested on the underlying shingle of the beach. The walls were made from Kentish ragstone, mostly roughly laid, with some work using finer ashlar, with Caen stone used in the detailing. Most of the ragstone was collected from the local beaches, where there were suitable outcrops to the west and east of the site. 459 tons of Caen stone was recycled from the priories of Christ Church and Horton, which had recently been dissolved by Henry. In total, 147,000 bricks were used, produced at 13 different brickyards, and 44,000 tiles, mostly manufactured in Wye, along with 1,829 loads of lime, 110 tons of coal and 979 tons of timber. The total cost of the project came to £5,584.

At the centre of the new castle was a circular keep, with three ovoid towers and bastions around it on the northwest, northeast and south sides, and a gatehouse to the north. These were surrounded by two curtain walls, forming a triangular inner and outer ward. Covered stone passageways, three storeys high, linked the towers, the keep and the gatehouse. The outer ward was grassed over, with a stone cesspool by the side of the north-east tower, linked by sewers to the inside of the castle. The castle was entered through a doorway in the rear of the gatehouse, originally called the &quot;Half Moon&quot;, linked by a stairway in the covered passageway to the keep. There were four tiers of guns in the finished castle, from the ground level up to the roof of the keep, and a total of 142 firing points for cannon and handguns; their design closely resembling those at nearby Walmer and Deal castles.

Sandgate was completed by the autumn of 1540; Henry may have come to the castle when he was visiting Folkestone in May 1542. Elizabeth I visited the fortification in 1573, and also used it to imprison the courtier Thomas Keyes for a period, after he married Lady Mary Grey against the Queen&#x27;s wishes. In 1593, the castle was reported to be equipped with seven artillery pieces - one culverin, two demi-culverins, three sakers and one minion - along with muskets, bows and arrows.

===17th–18th centuries===

In 1609, the garrison comprised a captain and his lieutenant, five soldiers, two porters and ten gunners. The mortar used in the castle was particularly poor, and had begun to seriously decay by 1616. A survey that year showed the castle to be substantially dilapidated, with the cost of the proposed repairs estimated at £260, and noted that a gun platform for ten weapons had been built along the southern walls to replace the original southern battery. A 1623 report echoed the same problems, noting that the sea had caused a third of the southern wall to collapse; the necessary repairs, including strengthening the walls, were projected at £560.

Four years later, amid fears of war with France and Spain, the castle&#x27;s captain, Richard Chalcroft, reported that the fortification was in such a poor condition that &quot;neither habitable or defensible against any assault, nor any way fit to command the roads&quot;. An inspection team observed that it was straightforward to climb over the castle&#x27;s ruined walls and rotten timbers, and that as a result its artillery had been dismounted and placed along the beach instead. The castle was probably not repaired, however, until after 1638.

Sandgate Castle was seized in 1642 by Parliamentary forces at the start of the first English Civil War between the supporters of King Charles I and Parliament, although its captain, Richard Hippesley, remained in post. The war ended in 1646 but, after the few years of unsteady peace, the Second Civil War broke out in 1648. The Parliamentary navy was based in Kent, protected by the other Henrician castles of Walmer, Deal and Sandown, but by May a Royalist insurrection was under way across the county, and the fleet joined the rebellion. Sandgate and its sister castles were occupied by the Royalists. Parliament defeated the wider insurgency at the Battle of Maidstone at the start of June, however, and then sent a force under the command of Colonel Rich to deal with the Kentish castles. Sandgate was still occupied by the Royalists that August, when Rich sent forces to prevent its garrison intervening to disrupt his assault on Deal and Sandown, but was recaptured soon after.

During the interregnum, Hippesley initially continued as captain of Sandgate, until he was replaced in 1653, resulting in complaints from him that he had been unfairly treated and that he was owed money by Parliament. During this period the garrison was increased to include a governor, two corporals, twenty soldiers and three gunners. When Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660, Sandgate and the other Device Forts initially remained at the heart of the south coast defences, but by now their design was antiquated. The garrison was cut back to its pre-war levels, and then reduced further in 1682 to only ten men. Sandgate had fallen into a poor condition, and £200 was assigned in 1663 for the repair of the castle, to be met partially from the proceeds of lands around Sandgate confiscated from former supporters of Parliament.

===19th century===

Sandgate Castle was still in use during the Napoleonic Wars at the start of the 19th century, but was heavily rebuilt. Brigadier-General William Twiss surveyed the south coast in 1804, and proposed building a series of 58 new defensive towers along it, as part of which he proposed converted Sandgate into a &quot;secure sea battery&quot;. After some opposition, and many delays within the War Office, the work on the castle finally began in 1805.

The project lowered the height of the castle considerably, destroying much of the fortification in the process. The upper storeys of the keep, the towers, the covered passageways and the gatehouse were all demolished, along with some of the buildings in the inner ward. The resulting rubble was used to backfill the outer ward, raising its height and effectively turning the inner ward into a dry moat. The inner curtain wall was reduced to one storey in height, and the outer curtain wall was refaced. An esplanade and wall-walk were built around the remaining outer walls, which supported at least eight gun emplacements.

The circular keep was turned into a Martello tower, a type of Napoleonic artillery fortification. It was now only two storeys tall, although remaining original interior walls and doorways largely survived untouched. It was accessed on the first floor via an unusual sliding drawbridge, which was supported on rails and could retract into the floor, and the different storeys were linked by a spiral staircase. The ground floor of the keep included a brick-built magazine, and the roof, supported by a central pillar running up through the building, held a single, large gun emplacement.

The north-east and north-west towers, now only one-storey tall, were covered with turf, turning the rear of the outer ward into a flat, grassed esplanade. The southern tower was reduced in height to two storeys, but remained in use as a gun platform. The covered corridors between the keep and the towers were now one-storey high as well, linking to the buried towers in the north-east and north-west bastions. The upper storeys of the gatehouse were rebuilt, although the ground floor remained in its 16th-century condition.

The modified castle was completed by 1808, and held eight 24-pounder (11 kg) guns along the outer wall, a gun on the roof of the southern bastion, and another on top of the keep itself. The new castle could hold a garrison of 40 men.

In 1859, the castle was re-equipped with heavier artillery, a combination of 32-pounder (15 kg) and 68-pounder (31 kg) guns. A new magazine was constructed, comprising a large, brick-built building divided into three rooms for storing gunpowder, specially designed to keep the powder dry. The exterior gun emplacements were also redesigned, reusing the 1806 foundations; the two surviving emplacements, in the north-east and north-west bastions, date from 1859.

Coastal erosion remained a problem. By the middle of the century, the tides had reached the southern edge of the castle, and an 1866 report stated that the walls had been undermined by the sea. Despite protective piles being driven around the castle, it was badly affected by flooding in 1875 and 1878, creating serious fissures in the stonework. The high costs of maintaining the property, combined with its dwindling utility, encouraged the government to sell the castle to the South Eastern Railway company in 1888, who intended to turn it into a railway station. It was then sold to private owners and a small museum was created in the castle, which was sometimes opened to the public for an entry price of one penny.

===20th–21st centuries===

The receding coast line continued to threaten Sandgate Castle, and severe storms in 1927 and 1950 undermined large parts of the castle. By the time that a new seawall was built in the early 1950s, the southern third of the castle had been entirely destroyed.

In 1975, Peter and Barbara McGregor began to restore the ruins of the castle, with the support of the Department of the Environment, Kent County Council and the British Army. As part of the project, archaeological investigations were carried out between 1975 and 1979 by Edward Harris.

The part of the 1806 esplanade around the northeast bastion was excavated, revealing the lower 16th-century stonework of the tower and the east side of the 1859 magazine, and a retaining wall was built to support the newly exposed walls. This created two levels in the outer bailey: a higher level on the western side, which still covered the northwest tower, and a lower one on the eastern. The keep was turned into a private residence, with a new sun room built on top of the gun platform.

In 2000, Lord Geoffrey Boot and his wife acquired the castle, which is now used by Boot&#x27;s company, AMT South Eastern Ltd.

The castle is protected under UK law as a grade I listed building. The two 16th-century ledger books from the original construction, written by the project clerk Thomas Busshe, survive in the British Library. They are 350 pages long, and form what the historian Peter Harrington has described as the &quot;most complete building account of any Tudor fortification&quot;.

<doc id="1036013" wikidata="Q1140434" url="?curid=1036013" title="Solovetsky Monastery">
<text>The Solovetsky Monastery (, ) is a fortified monastery located on the Solovetsky Islands in the White Sea in northern Russia. It was one of the largest Christian citadels in northern Russia before it was converted into a Soviet prison and labor camp in 1926 to 1939, and served as a prototype for the camps of the Gulag system. The monastery has experienced several major changes and military sieges. Its most important structures date from the 16th century, when Filip Kolychev was its hegumen (comparable to an abbot).

== History ==
The Solovetsky Monastery was founded in 1436 by the monk Zosima; however, monks Herman and Savvatiy from the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery lived on the island from 1429 to 1436, and are considered to be co-founders of the monastery. Zosima later became the first hegumen of the monastery. After Marfa Boretskaya, wife of the posadnik of Novgorod, donated her lands at Kem and Summa to the monastery in 1450, the monastery quickly enlarged its holdings, which was situated strategically on the shores of the White Sea.

In the 15th and 16th centuries, the monastery extended its commercial activities, becoming an economic and political center of the White Sea region. This included saltworks (in the 1660s, it owned 54 of them), trapping, fishing, mica works, ironworks, pearl works, among others. Archmandrites of the monastery were appointed by the tsar himself and the patriarch.

By the 17th century, the Solovetsky Monastery had about 350 monks, 600–700 servants, artisans and peasants. In the 1650s and 1660s, the monastery was one of the strongholds of the Old Believers of the Raskol (schism) in the Russian Orthodox Church. The Solovetsky Monastery Uprising of 1668–1676 was aimed at Patriarch Nikon&#x27;s ecclesiastic reform and took on an anti-feudal nature. In 1765, the monastery became stauropegic (from the Greek &quot;stauros&quot; meaning &quot;cross&quot; and &quot;pegio&quot; meaning &quot;to affirm&quot;), i.e. it was subordinated directly to the Synod.

Together with the Sumskoy and Kemsky stockades, the Solovetsky Monastery served as an important frontier fortress with dozens of cannons and a strong garrison. In the 16th to 17th centuries, the monastery succeeded a number of times in repelling the attacks of the Livonian Order and the Swedes (in 1571, 1582 and 1611).
During the Crimean War, the Solovetsky Monastery was attacked by three British ships. After nine hours of shelling on the 6 and 7 July 1854 the vessels left with nothing.

Between the 16th and the early 20th centuries, the monastery was also a place of exile for the opponents of autocracy and official Orthodoxy and a center of Christianization in the north of Russia. The monastery also had a large library of manuscripts and books.
The monastery garden also had some exotic flora, such as the Tibetan wild roses presented to the monks by Agvan Dorzhiev, a Lama.

After the Bolshevik Revolution and Russian Civil War, the Soviet authorities closed down the monastery and incorporated many of the buildings into Solovki prison camp, one of the earliest forced-labor camps of the gulag during the 1920s and 1930s. &quot;In the earliest years of the Soviet prison system, the Solovetsky Special Prison Camp (SLON) was home to a large group of . . . imprisoned writers.&quot; The camp main activity was logging, and when most of the surrounding area had been deforested, the camp was closed. Before the Second World War, a naval cadet school was opened on the island.

A small brotherhood of monks has re-established activities in the monastery after the collapse of communism, and it currently houses about ten monks. The monastery has also recently been extensively repaired, but remains under reconstruction. The Solovetsky Monastery is also an historical and architectural museum. It was one of the first Russian sites to have been inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List.

== Layout ==
The Solovetsky Monastery is located on the shores of the Prosperity Bay (&quot;бухта Благополучия&quot;) on Solovetsky Island. The monastery is surrounded by massive wall 8 to 11 meters high and 4 to 6 meters thick. The wall incorporates 7 gates and 8 towers (built in 1584–1594 by an architect named Trifon), made mainly of huge boulders up to several tonnes of weight. There are also religious buildings on the monastery&#x27;s grounds with the principal structures interconnected with roofed and arched passages. They are in turn surrounded by multiple household buildings and living quarters, including a refectory (a 500 m² chamber) with the Uspensky Cathedral (built in 1552–1557), Preobrazhensky Cathedral (1556–1564), Church of Annunciation (1596–1601), stone chambers (1615), watermill (early 17th century), bell tower (1777), and Church of Nicholas (1834).

<doc id="1036019" wikidata="Q1104802" url="?curid=1036019" title="Coburg North, Victoria">
<text>Coburg North is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Darebin and Merri-bek local government areas. Coburg North recorded a population of 8,327 at the 2021 census.

Although most of Coburg North is within the City of Merri-bek, a handful of properties on Elizabeth Street, Coburg North&#x27;s eastern boundary, are located in the City of Darebin.

The suburb lies north of Coburg, and has the same postcode (3058). The majority of Coburg North is zoned residential, though there are some industrial pockets. The major commercial strip on Sydney Road is primarily automotive-related businesses. Merlynston has a small shopping strip with some cafes. The rest of the suburb is reliant on corner shops for everyday needs.

==History==
Coburg North Post Office opened on 1 August 1857 and closed in 1980.

==Housing==

A large number of the houses in the area have two bedrooms and are made of brick, some with a weatherboard extension. These were constructed in bulk by the Housing Commission of Victoria, and most follow a standard design and layout. The weatherboard extension appears to be standard feature on houses of this period, and can take the form of a third bedroom, extended kitchen or laundry, or a standalone shed. Some houses share a common wall as a duplex unit.

After the closure of the Kodak Factory in 2005, the land began was developed into a A$250 million housing site for 1000 people.

==Local industry==

Industry in Coburg North is concentrated in the area bounded by Gaffney Street, Sydney Road, Shorts Road and Sussex Street. A notable and major industry in the suburb used to be a factory owned by Kodak, on two sites either side of the Edgars Creek, used for photographic paper manufacture and film processing. With the popularity of digital photography, Kodak has closed the factory.

==Geography==

Geographical features in North Coburg include:
* The Coburg Olympic Pool
* Edgars Creek
* Merlynston Creek
* Merri Creek
* Village Coburg Drive-In
* Coburg Lake
* Cash Reserve
* Richards Reserve (where the Velodrome is)
* Parker Reserve (Baseball Diamond) with two cricket fields next to it
* Harold Stevens Athletics Track
* Cox Reserve
* Hosken Reserve
* Sanger Reserve

Increased urban consolidation has added to 1-in-100 year flash flooding risk in Coburg North along the course of Merlynston Creek, according to the State Emergency Service (SES). The State Emergency Services says flooding has occurred along the creek path through Coburg North historically in 1891, 1916, 1934, 1954, 1974, 1978, 1981, 1983, 1989, 2003, and 2011.

==Educational facilities==

Coburg North has one State primary school (Coburg North Primary School), with buildings by Percy Everett, a former chief architect of the Public Works Department of Victoria (PWD). Coburg North Primary (No 4543) was built in 1937 in a restrained Art Deco mode in cream brick and is Heritage listed by Merri-bek City Council.

Other schools in Coburg North are the Australian International Academy, an Islamic school which offers primary and secondary schooling across two campuses, and Mercy College, an all girls Catholic high school.

<text>Milsons Point railway station is a heritage-listed suburban railway station located on the North Shore line, serving the Sydney suburb of Milsons Point. It is served by Sydney Trains T1 North Shore line services. The station is elevated and is accessible via both stairs and a lift. It was designed and built by the Sydney Harbour Bridge Branch of the NSW Department of Public Works. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

==History==


In 1815, government architect Francis Greenway, in a report to Governor Macquarie, proposed the building of a bridge from Dawes Point at the city&#x27;s edge to the northern shore. The original Milsons Point station was not in its present location, but on the edge of Sydney Harbour approximately on the site of the present northern pylon of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the North Sydney Olympic Pool. This location enabled passengers from the North Shore to transfer directly from steam trains to ferries to reach Circular Quay. It opened as the southern terminus of the North Shore railway line on 1 May 1893. when extended from its previous terminus at St Leonards (opened from Hornsby 1 January 1890). The site, squeezed between the rock cliffs and the edge of Sydney Harbour was cramped, with two side platforms, one of which was built on piles partly over the water&#x27;s edge, and three tracks between, including a centre road. Immediately adjoining it to the west was the colonnaded Milsons Point ferry wharf for the ferry service to Circular Quay in the Sydney central business district and tram terminus for the North Sydney cable tramway (opened 22 May 1886) and subsequently electrified from 11 February 1900.

Concrete had been extensively used for foundations and walls since the 1890s. By 1910, reinforced concrete was in use, but not for superstructures directly supporting railway tracks. The Bellevue Street underbridge at Glebe was the first to use it for this purpose, in 1919.

In 1915, to enable a start on the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge between Milsons Point and Dawes Point, the Government instructed the Railway Commissioners to vacate the station and a new four platform, station was constructed at the site of the boundary fence between the present-day Luna Park and Lavender Bay Sidings. This station was in operation for just seven weeks, from 30 May 1915 to 18 July 1915, as the inconvenience to passengers transferring between ferries and trains was unacceptable. Due to later overcrowding, a third platform was added on 12 December 1920 by removing the centre road track and laying a new track on inland side of the new platform 2. This station remained in use until the site was requisitioned to allow construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

It was not until 1922 that legislation was passed and acted upon, authorising the construction of a bridge. Tenders were invited in 1923 in accordance with general plans and specification prepared by Dr John Bradfield, Chief Engineer, Sydney Harbour Bridge and Railway Construction. The plans and specification provided the alternatives of a cantilever or an arch bridge. Twenty proposals were received from six different companies of various types of design. The tender of Dorman Long &amp; Co Ltd, of Middlesbrough, England, for an arch bridge was accepted, the design being substantially in accordance with one of Dr Bradfield&#x27;s proposals. The detailed design was carried out by the contractor&#x27;s consulting engineer, Sir Ralph Freeman, and the fabrication and construction were under the direct charge of Mr Lawrence Ennis, a director of the firm. The design and construction of the bridge were supervised at all stages by Dr Bradfield and his staff.

=== Temporary station ===
From 27 April 1924, a new temporary station was brought into use, approximately back along the line on the site of the present Lavender Bay car sidings, just beyond the present Luna Park amusement park. It was linked to the street by stairs and three escalators, and to a new adjacent ferry wharf. The escalators at Milsons Point were the first installed in Australia, one of which was transferred to Town Hall station when the temporary station closed. The tram line was also relocated to terminate adjacent to the entrance to the new station in Glen Street. First work on the bridge commenced in 1924 with construction of the bridge approaches and the approach spans. Construction of the approach spans was undertaken concurrently with erection of the steelwork for the actual bridge structure. The building of the approaches on the north side included the construction of North Sydney Station, Milsons Point Station and a number of underbridges to carry the railway. The approaches were designed and built by the Sydney Harbour Bridge Branch of the Public Works Department and the Metropolitan Railway Construction Branch of the NSW Government Railways. The northern approaches were built using spoil from the excavation of the North Sydney station site to build a ramp up to the main bridge level. Retaining walls of concrete, built by Monier Concrete, were built along Broughton and Alfred Streets and Bradfield and Pacific Highways.

The line from Hornsby to Milsons Point was electrified from 2 August 1927.

===Current station===
The Milsons Point station was constructed between 1929 and 1932 as part of the northern approaches. It was initially called Kirribilli Station, but was changed to Milsons Point before its opening. By June 1931 the station platform had been completed and a portion of the platform awnings had also been erected. The railway decking had advanced as far as Milsons Point, tracks had begun to be laid and the transoms delivered for installation. By January 1932 the platforms had been covered with asphalt, the brickwork of the shops in the arcade below the station was completed as was the tiling, the laying of magnesite flooring in the station office, terrazzo flooring in the lavatories, the erection of the metal awnings at the Alfred Street and Broughton Street entrances, terracotta facing to the station and installation of gates and barriers. Trackwork was completed and ballast laid along the tracks at the same time.

On 19 March 1932, the Milsons Point station was officially opened as part of the larger bridge opening celebrations to roadway, railway and pedestrian traffic by the then Premier, Jack Lang. As part of the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and relocation of the North Shore Line to extend across the bridge into the city, a new Milsons Point station was built on the northern approach to the bridge and opened on 19 March 1932. This station was in two parts: two platforms each side of the roadway. The western platforms were connected to the North Shore line with the eastern pair used for a tramway service between Wynyard and the northern suburbs. The tramway and the associated platforms at Milsons Point were removed in 1958 as part of the conversions of lanes 7 and 8 of the Harbour Bridge to become the Cahill Expressway.

The station was upgraded and received a lift connecting the platform and underneath concourse at some point between January 1992 and September 1998.

== Description ==
===Buildings===
The complex comprises platform office and shelter (1932), platform faces (1932), subway entrances (1932), concourse (1932), walls and abutments (1932), and the Burton Street Under-bridge (1932).

====Platform office and platform (1932)====
Platform structures include a platform office and shelter awnings over. The platform office retains timber double-hung sash windows. The island platform configuration is accessed via concrete stairs and a recently installed elevator.

====Entrances (1932)====
The Alfred Street entrance retains its 1932 decorative awning and original light fittings either side. The Broughton Street awning has been replaced (date unknown) with a modern awning that extends over the entrances to shops that face Broughton Street. Above each entrance is fixed a cartouche with &quot;1932&quot; written on it.

====Concourse (1932)====
The concourse level includes station managers office, ticket and booking offices, amenities and a series of small shop outlets on the northern side. Access is via covered subway entrance ways in Alfred and Broughton streets. The stairs and walls of the concourse are tiled in cream-coloured ceramic tiles with maroon bands as top courses. The concourse includes a number of small shop fronts used for take away and small businesses, with shops facing Broughton Street. These were included in the original 1932 layout.

====Walls and abutments (1932)====
The external walls and abutments are finished in rendered concrete in keeping with the overall bridge design.

====Burton Street Under-bridge (1932)====
The south end of the Station group area includes the Burton Street Under-bridge , a high arch reinforced concrete underbridge constructed as part of the northern approaches to the Sydney Harbour Bridge and a similar design as the neighbouring Fitzroy Street Underbridge . The northern end is defined by the Lavender Street Underbridge. This is a reinforced concrete bridge with open spandrels. It is a unique design among the Sydney Harbour Bridge approach under-bridges. These underbridges are dealt with as individual items on separate listings

=== Condition ===
The station building, platform and under-bridge are in good condition. Some small cracks are visible in the external render around both the Alfred and the Broughton Street entrances. The Milsons Point Station group is largely intact and retains a high level of integrity.

=== Modifications and dates ===
*s: Shop and entrance awnings replaced on Broughton Street side
*: Platform elevator installed.
*N.d: Internal walls in the concourse, stairways and subway areas painted.

=== Further information ===
Historic photos of the station construction in 1932 indicate that the fasciae of the station platform shelter are original, as is the decorative awning for the Alfred Street entrance. Tiles are as specified in Bradfield&#x27;s colour scheme for the city railway.

<doc id="1036025" wikidata="Q369388" url="?curid=1036025" title="House of Flying Daggers">
<text>House of Flying Daggers () is a 2004 &quot;wuxia&quot; martial arts film directed by Zhang Yimou and starring Takeshi Kaneshiro, Andy Lau, and Zhang Ziyi. It opened in limited release within the United States on 3 December 2004, in New York City and Los Angeles, and opened on additional screens throughout the country two weeks later. The film grossed $11,050,094 at the United States box office and went on to significantly overperform in home video market in the United States.

The film was chosen as China&#x27;s entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for the year 2004, but was not nominated in that category. It did receive a nomination for Best Cinematography.

== Plot ==
In AD 859, as the Tang dynasty declines, several rebel groups emerged. The largest of them is the House of Flying Daggers in Fengtian, who battle the corrupt government. Its members steal from the rich and give to the poor, gaining the locals&#x27; support. Two police officers, Leo and Jin, are ordered to kill the group leader within ten days, an impossible task given no one even knows the leader&#x27;s identity.

To accomplish this, Leo arrests Mei, a blind dancer suspected of being the previous leader&#x27;s daughter. Pretending to be a rebel sympathiser, Jin breaks Mei out of the jailhouse, gaining her trust. The two travel to the Flying Dagger headquarters, with Leo trailing behind with reinforcements. Slowly, Mei and Jin fall in love.

To make the deception more realistic, Leo and his policemen pretend to ambush the pair. Later, though, they are ambushed for real by soldiers. At a secret meeting, Leo explains that the military has gotten involved and wants Jin and Mei dead. 

A few days later, Jin and Mei are attacked again in a bamboo forest and almost killed, before the House of Flying Daggers saves them and takes them to their headquarters. At this point, Mei is revealed to have been faking her blindness and is not the former leader&#x27;s daughter. Furthermore, she is engaged to Leo, who turns out to be the Flying Daggers&#x27; mole. The Flying Daggers are not afraid of the military and are actually looking forward to an open battle. 

A heartbroken Leo tells Mei that he waited for her for three years since he went undercover, and asks how she could fall in love with Jin after only three days, only to be told she has her heart set on Jin. Leo tries to attack Mei, but their superior Nia intervenes and gives him new assignments, separating them. Mei is ordered to execute Jin. She frees him instead but refuses to run away with him. Later, Mei changes her mind and rides after Jin, but is ambushed by Leo, who casts two daggers at her. Mei manages to deflect one while the other seemingly kills her. Jin and Leo fight but are evenly matched. A raging blizzard falls upon them, while the military approaches the House.

With both men badly wounded and exhausted, Leo prepares to kill Jin with Nia&#x27;s dagger. Mei reappears, Leo&#x27;s dagger still stuck in her chest, and threatens to kill Leo with it. Jin begs her to save herself. After several tense moments, Leo decides to pretend to throw his dagger, intending to die by Mei&#x27;s dagger while sparing Jin. However, Mei attempts to use her dagger to intercept Leo&#x27;s dagger in flight. The result is that neither Leo nor Jin dies, but only Mei. In the end, Leo stumbles away in guilt while Jin cries over Mei&#x27;s body, singing a song praising her as a &quot;rare beauty&quot;, the likes of which he will never see again. Whether the House won against the military is left ambiguous.

==Cast==
* Takeshi Kaneshiro – Captain Jin ()
* Andy Lau – Captain Leo ()
* Zhang Ziyi – Mei ()

==Production==
Anita Mui was originally cast for a major role, which was to be her final film appearance. She died of cervical cancer before any of her scenes were filmed. After her death on 30 December 2003, director Zhang Yimou decided to alter the script rather than find a replacement. The film is dedicated to her memory.

To prepare for her role, Zhang Ziyi lived for two months with a blind girl who had lost her sight at the age of 12 because of a brain tumor. Takeshi Kaneshiro injured his leg when he went horseback riding. As a result, Yimou had Kaneshiro spend two scenes sitting or kneeling down to alleviate the pain, which was stated in Yimou&#x27;s audio commentary.

Most of the film was shot in Ukraine&#x27;s Carpathian Mountains (the Hutsul Region National Park), such as the scenes in the snow or birch forests. The cast and production team spent 70 days on location from September to October 2003, and were largely based in Kosiv. The notable bamboo forest sequences were filmed in China. However, due to the early snowfall, the filmmakers opted to alter the script and certain sequences, rather than wait for the snow to thaw, as the leaves were still on the trees. Zhang Yimou later stated that despite the unpredictable weather forcing the alterations, he had achieved the desired effect in the scenery, and was happy with the final result.

Like its predecessor &quot;Hero&quot;, &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; uses wuxing colour theory, in both a deliberate and ironic manner.

==Literary origins==

The film features the theme of a beautiful woman who brings woe to two men. This theme is borrowed from a famous poem written by the Han dynasty poet Li Yannian ():
 ， 。
 。

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; opened in North America on 3 December 2004 in 15 theatres. It grossed US$397,472 ($26,498 per screen) in its opening weekend. The film&#x27;s total North American gross is $11,050,094. Afterwards, the film went on to earn at least 50% more in the United States home video market than at the theatrical box office.

The film made an additional $81,751,003 elsewhere in the world, bringing its total worldwide box-office gross to $92,801,097. It was also the third-highest-grossing foreign-language film in the North American market in 2004.

===Critical reception===
&quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; debuted in May at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival to an enthusiastic reception. The film reportedly received a 20-minute standing ovation at its Cannes Film Festival premiere.

At film review aggregation website Metacritic, the film received an average score of 89 out of 100, based on 37 reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 87%, based on reviews from 171 critics, and an average rating of 7.7/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;The visual splendor of the movie makes up for the weak story&quot;. Metacritic also ranked the film at the end of the year as the fifth-best reviewed film of 2004.

Phil Hall of &quot;Film Threat&quot; wrote: &quot;Quite simply, &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; is a film that sets several new standards for production and entertainment values. It is a wild riot of color, music, passion, action, mystery, pure old-fashioned thrills, and even dancing. With an endless supply of imagination and a kinetic force of nature in its amazing star Zhang Ziyi, &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; cuts all other films to shreds.&quot; Desson Thomas of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the director Zhang Yimou&#x27;s use of color in the film as &quot;simply the best in the world&quot;, and described the film as: &quot;the slow-motion trajectory of a small bean, hurled from a police captain&#x27;s hand, is a spectacular thing. It&#x27;s a stunning, moving image, like a hummingbird caught in action.&quot; While Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the film by stating: &quot;&quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; finds the great Chinese director at his most romantic in this thrilling martial arts epic that involves a conflict between love and duty carried out to its fullest expression.&quot;

A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as: &quot;A gorgeous entertainment, a feast of blood, passion, and silk brocade.&quot; The review also stated: &quot;&quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; for all its fire and beauty, may leave you a bit cold in the end.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; gave the film four out of four stars and states: &quot;Forget about the plot, the characters, the intrigue, which are all splendid in &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot;, and focus just on the visuals&quot;, and Ebert also states: &quot;the film is so good to look at and listen to that, as with some operas, the story is almost beside the point, serving primarily to get us from one spectacular scene to another.&quot; &quot;House of Flying Daggers&quot; was placed at number 93 on &quot;Slant&quot;″s best films of the 2000s. and ranked number 77 in &quot;Empire&quot;″s &quot;The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema&quot; in 2010.

<doc id="1036038" wikidata="Q6965028" url="?curid=1036038" title="Napoleon Disentimed">
<text>Napoleon Disentimed is a science fiction novel by American writer Hayford Peirce, first published by Tor Books in 1987. It is a humorous treatment of two standard science fiction themes, those of time travel and of parallel universes. The protagonist is a dapper, clever con man who, although born to humble origins in Bangor, Maine, United States, calls himself Sir Kevin Dean de Courtney MacNair of MacNair. Part of it is set in two alternate universes to our own. In one of them, Napoleon won the Napoleonic Wars and subdued Great Britain and Russia in 1806, thereafter securing global dominance for him and his descendants- a Napoleon V still sits on his world&#x27;s French imperial throne in its 1980s. In another, the British royal family made different dynastic arrangements, leading to the birth of a male heir to King William IV rather than Queen Victoria, Frederick I, whose descendants still rule the United Kingdom- Frederick IV is the reigning monarch in its 1987. Through a complicated series of misadventures MacNair ends up impersonating Napoleon Bonaparte for the dictator&#x27;s so-called &quot;Missing Years&quot;, 1806–1808. By the end of the book he has succeeded in not only acquiring a beautiful wife and a slightly run-down château in France but in also inventing both the modern indoor flush toilet and Champagne. A sequel to &quot;Napoleon Disentimed&quot;, also featuring the MacNair, is &quot;The Burr in the Garden of Eden&quot;.

<doc id="1036039" wikidata="Q1652615" url="?curid=1036039" title="Paul Caligiuri">
<text>Paul David Caligiuri (born March 9, 1964) is an American former professional soccer player who played as a defensive midfielder.

Caligiuri&#x27;s professional career spanned 16 years, during which he played for numerous teams in the United States and Germany, and for the U.S. national team. During his 14 years as a defender and defensive midfielder with the national team, he earned 110 caps and scored five goals.

Caligiuri is best remembered for his game-winning goal widely dubbed the &quot;Shot heard round the world,&quot; which he scored in a 1–0 World Cup qualifier victory over Trinidad and Tobago on November 19, 1989. The victory qualified the United States for the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy, its first World Cup berth since 1950. There Caligiuri notched the first World Cup goal for the U.S. national team in 40 years, scoring in a 5–1 defeat against Czechoslovakia. He is a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

==High school and college==
Caligiuri was born in Westminster, California. After graduating from Walnut High School, he attended UCLA from 1982 to 1985. During his four seasons with the Bruins, he was twice named an NCAA All-American. He also captained the Bruins to an NCAA Championship his junior year.

==Club career==
===San Diego Nomads===
After graduating from UCLA, Caligiuri played the 1986 season with the San Diego Nomads of the Western Soccer Alliance, earning the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award. He was also named the 1986 U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year.

===Germany===
Caligiuri&#x27;s rookie professional accomplishments attracted the attention of German Bundesliga club Hamburger SV, who signed him after his appearance in the 1986 FIFA/UNICEF All Star Game.

In 1988, Hamburg transferred Caligiuri to SV Meppen of the German 2. Bundesliga, where he played for two seasons. From Meppen, he moved to FC Hansa Rostock in East Germany, with whom he would win the East German professional championship. From 1991 to 1992 he played for Second Bundesliga club SC Freiburg.

===Los Angeles Salsa===
On May 4, 1995, Caliguiri returned to the United States from Germany to sign with the Los Angeles Salsa of the American Professional Soccer League to gain match fitness before the U.S. national team&#x27;s games that summer. (The Salsa played the season however in the USISL Pro League.) Caligiuri donated his entire salary from the Salsa to the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing.

====Loan to St. Pauli====
In August, the Salsa loaned Caligiuri to Bundesliga club FC St. Pauli, where he appeared in 14 games. In January 1996, the team elected not to exercise an option in Caligiuri&#x27;s contract.

===Major League Soccer===
Caligiuri returned to the United States, where he signed with the emergent Major League Soccer. Despite Caligiuri&#x27;s stated position that a contract clause that dictated he play for his hometown Los Angeles Galaxy, MLS allocated Caligiuri to the Columbus Crew. During his lone season with the Crew, he scored three goals. 
Caligiuri sued Major League Soccer to play for the LA Galaxy, and in March 1997 was placed with Los Angeles for the 1997 season, despite his high salary and the fact that the Galaxy were close to the salary cap. He played there until his 2001 retirement, finishing his MLS career with nine goals and 14 assists accumulated during 135 games, including 123 starts.

Caligiuri&#x27;s final professional appearance was in the 2001 U.S. Open Cup Final on October 27, 2001, where the LA Galaxy defeated New England Revolution 2–1 in extra time.

==International career==
Caligiuri represented the U.S. at the 1983 Pan American Games. While at UCLA Caligiuri had earned his first cap for the national team, playing October 9, 1984 against El Salvador. Caligiuri eventually tallied 110 appearances for the United States, and scored five goals from his position in the midfield. Perhaps his biggest goal was in a 1989 World Cup qualifier in Trinidad and Tobago that gave the U.S. a 1–0 victory and sent the Americans to the World Cup finals for the first time in 40 years.

On March 14, 1990, Caligiuri signed a contract with USSF making him a full-time national team member. He remained on contract with USSF for several years. In 1993, he briefly considered moving to a British or German club after being omitted from the U.S. team&#x27;s Gold Cup roster, but ultimately chose to dedicate himself to the national team as it prepared for the 1994 World Cup.

Caligiuri was a central figure in the national team from the 1980s through the mid-1990s, and started every U.S. match in both the 1990 and 1994 World Cups. In 1997, he played his final game for the national team.

Caligiuri played with the U.S. Futsal team in 1996, earning four caps and scoring one goal.

==Post-soccer career==
Caligiuri was appointed head coach of both the men and women&#x27;s soccer teams at Cal Poly Pomona before the beginning of their 2001 fall seasons, although he did not take over until 2002. He held the women&#x27;s team&#x27;s coaching position through the 2005 season and the men&#x27;s team&#x27;s coaching position through the end of the 2008 season. Later Caligiuri coached youth soccer for socal reds in Irvine, California as well as their UPSL team from 2023 to 2024.

==Personal life==
In 2004, Caligiuri was inducted into the U.S. National Soccer Hall of Fame. He serves as an athlete representative on the board of directors of the United States Soccer Federation. Caligiuri coached a BU-19 and GU-14 team for California Football Academy in Mission Viejo, California. He is currently an Area Director for the Pateadores Soccer Club. He is also the Head Coach for the Orange County Football Club, Men&#x27;s Semi-Pro soccer team in the NPSL (National Premier Soccer League). This was OCFC&#x27;s first season in the league where they ended the season in a 1–0 loss in the Western Conference Final of the NPSL.

<text>Hougham Battery is a World War II coastal defence battery built in 1941 between Dover and Folkestone in southeast England.
It is on the cliff-edge between Abbot&#x27;s Cliff and Shakespeare Cliff.

The battery was equipped with three 8-inch (203 mm) Mark VIII naval guns.
The complex was built in 1941 and manned by men of 520 Coastal Regiment Royal Artillery

The construction of the A20 in the 1970s caused most of the battery to be covered with earth, so little can be seen on the surface, though access is possible to the underground battery plotting room. Some of the observation posts on the cliff edge are also visible.

The batteries to the east and west of Dover were each designated as a fortress and each fortress had an underground plotting room from where the guns could be controlled.
At Hougham. there are No.1, No.2 and No.3 Gun emplacements.

The North Downs Way (long-distance path) leads over Round Down (on the Dover Cliffs) between Folkestone and Dover. 
The path passes by several observation posts of the battery.

<text>Lydden Spout Battery is a World War II coastal defence battery built in 1941 west of Dover. Originally armed with three 6-inch Mark VII naval guns on Mark V mountings, later upgraded to Mark XXIV guns on the same mountings. Fan Bay Battery to the east of Dover is built to the same plan.

The battery is to the south of the current A20. Most of the buildings have been demolished and the emplacements filled with concrete, but the catering rooms survive.

<doc id="1036054" wikidata="Q1241167" url="?curid=1036054" title="Psycho Realm">
<text>The Psycho Realm is a Mexican-American hip hop group started in 1989 by the brothers Sick Jacken and Big Duke both born in Mazatlán, Sinaloa, Mexico raised in the Downtown neighborhood of Pico-Union area of Los Angeles.

==History==
The group started as a duo of Sick Jacken (Joaquín Gonzalez) and Big Duke (Gustavo Gonzalez) in 1989; the two were later joined by Ferruco (Jose Martinez) in 1993. The group recorded various demo songs, but one track (&quot;Scandalous&quot;) appeared on the soundtrack to the 1994 film &quot;Mi Vida Loca&quot;. Ferruco departed from the group in 1994. The following year, B-Real (Louis Freese) of the rap group Cypress Hill saw Psycho Realm performing at Olvera Street for an End Barrio Warfare concert. Their performance inspired B-Real to the point that he wanted to join the group.

In 1997 Sony released the first Psycho Realm album, labelled as an addition to the Cypress Hill Family by the sticker placed on the CD case. Due to conflicts with the record label, the Gonzalez brothers were dropped from Sony. As Jacken explains, &quot;the machine was just trying to censor me / Didn&#x27;t do it for Sony so they ended up releasing me / Independent, no longer locked down for an infinity / So my vicinity stays true to my identity.&quot; The brothers then went on to form Sick Symphonies, their own record label, which lacked the big budget for promotion and distribution in chain stores along with group member B-Real, who was stuck on his contract with Sony for Cypress Hill.

===Tragedy===
At 12:35 a.m. on January 29, 1999, one month before the expected release of the second Psycho Realm album, Duke was shot in the neck in a confrontation while trying to split up a fight at Tommy&#x27;s Burger Stand at Beverly and Rampart Boulevard in Los Angeles. This left him paralyzed from the neck down for life. The shooter, a 24-year-old named Robert Gorcsi, who was on parole at the time of the shooting, was given a bond set at $1.6 million. He was eventually jailed for attempted murder. Later in 2000, Jacken released &quot;A War Story Book I&quot; with B-Real only appearing on one song. In 2001, the Sick Symphonies label released &quot;The Steel Storm&quot;, the first album of a new group called Street Platoon. Jacken, with the help of Street Platoon, finished &quot;A War Story Book II&quot;, which was released in the latter half of 2003 and nearly complete before the shooting of Duke.

==Style and lyrics==
The group aims to inject pride and knowledge into those who live in gang-infested, poverty-ridden neighborhoods, while at the same time aiming to open the minds of the ones on the outside who look down upon them. Jacken attempts to explain to outsiders with his statement: &quot;my people’s exodus results in prejudice / you ask us why in poverty we become terrorists/ well let me tell you this we don’t choose to tote gats / and selling on the corner is to avoid tax.&quot; Duke views the group not as rappers, but neighborhood reporters. They choose to document &quot;a time when it&#x27;s in fashion to be gun-flashing, blasting... strapped ready for rivals harassing.&quot; The Psycho Realm spoke about the corruption of Rampart police officers from their experiences living in the Rampart district, before the Rampart Scandal hit the media. The group also promotes the unification of gangs with remarks such as, &quot;think about who dies when we let the lead out, we’re killing family tragically.&quot; The Psycho Realm has grown a worldwide following of &quot;soldiers,&quot; and have performed in Mexico, Latin America, Japan, and Europe. At the moment, Duke is in charge of all merchandising for Psycho Realm. Duke is known to personally reply to many of his fans&#x27; emails, and is actively involved in a large percentage of production in Psycho Realm&#x27;s and other affiliates&#x27; works.

<doc id="1036055" wikidata="Q2286606" url="?curid=1036055" title="Silverton, New South Wales">
<text>Silverton is a small village at the far west of New South Wales, Australia, north-west of Broken Hill. At the , Silverton had a population of 50.

The town sprang up after the discovery of rich silver deposits, although it was soon eclipsed by an even richer silver-lead-zinc ore body at nearby Broken Hill. The town is often referred to as a ghost town; however, there remains a small permanent population and a few businesses, mainly related to tourism.

==History==
The earliest human settlers in the area are thought to be the Wiljakali people. Their presence was probably only intermittent due to lack of permanent water sources. As in much of Australia, a combination of disease and pressure from European settlement drove them from their lands.

The first European to visit the area was the then-Surveyor General of New South Wales, Major Thomas Mitchell, in 1841. Three years later, the explorer Charles Sturt saw and named the Barrier Range while searching for an inland sea; the range was so named as it was a barrier to his progress north. Burke and Wills passed through the area in their famous 1860–61 expedition, setting up a base camp at nearby Menindee. Pastoralists first began settling the area in the 1850s, with the main trade route to the area along the Darling River.

Prospectors began working in the area in 1867 when a local station-hand claimed to have found gold there. It was later discovered that his plan was merely a pretext for stealing a horse.

Some years later in 1875, two men drilling a well on a station south of the town site hit a lode of silver. Silverton was recognised as a town on 17 September 1880 and Richard O&#x27;Connell was sent in charge of the police. Among his many other duties was Acting Clerk of Petty Sessions, Mining Registrar and Warden&#x27;s Clerk.

In October 1886, the Silverton Municipal Council was formed and held its inaugural meeting in January 1887 in the Silverton Municipal Chambers, which still exist. The town&#x27;s population quickly increased reaching a peak around 3,000 in the 1890s, and the Silverton Tramway was opened in 1888 connecting the town to South Australia. The Municipality of Silverton was formally dissolved on 24 September 1907 by a proclamation of Governor of New South Wales Harry Rawson; however by then it had already been effectively defunct for several years.

Many of the houses built were of simple iron and canvas construction. The rapid depletion of the high-grade ore around Silverton, along with the discovery of an even richer silver-lead-zinc ore body in nearby Broken Hill led to a sudden decline in Silverton&#x27;s population, with many of those leaving taking their homes with them.

===20th century===
By 1901, the town and immediate area was home to less than 300 people, but it remained popular as a venue for recreational outings by Broken Hill residents. In 1915, the Battle of Broken Hill took place when a New Year&#x27;s Day picnic train from Broken Hill to Silverton was attacked by two armed persons, one from Afghanistan, and the other from modern-day Pakistan.

===Penrose Park===
Penrose Park, named after John Penrose, a pioneering brewer at Silverton, was the attraction for these picnic excursions. Located beside Umberumberka Creek in a rare belt of greenery at the outskirts of Silverton, it was not so much a product of the early mining era at Silverton as of the mining boom at Broken Hill. In 1893, it was the unsuccessful site for a racecourse. 

Then for decades it became a picnic ground, but remained relatively neglected until the mid-1930s when the Broken Hill mining companies decided it was an admirable recreation site for their employees. Money was spent on upgrading sporting facilities, playgrounds, and parklands, such that throughout the 1940s and 50s it became a major recreational facility. Huge annual picnics and fairs were held there by social and sporting clubs, and by mining companies. For example, it was reported that the eighth annual Zinc Mine employees picnic in 1941 attracted one fifth of the entire town of Broken Hill. The convoys of family cars headed to and from Broken Hill to Penrose Park were so heavy that it became one of the first sealed roads outside Broken Hill. By the mid-1960s, interest began to wane, as did support from the mining companies, and so the park fell into slow decline. 

Penrose Park remains today, known as Penrose Park Recreation Reserve, with camping facilities. During the annual Mundi Mundi Bash each August, the campground fills up with people attending the music festival at Belmont Station.

==Demographics==
In the 2016 Australian census, Silverton inhabitants were 46.9% male and 53.1% female with a median age of 53. It has a total of 12 families in 39 private dwellings with a median household income of $899 per week.

==Present day==
Silverton today is inhabited by a permanent population of only about 50 people, but its history and location make it a relatively popular tourist destination. Several artists live in or around the town, including Peter Browne, Albert Woodroffe and John Dynon, with some maintaining their own galleries. This is in line with the significant number of artists working out of nearby Broken Hill, as the surrounding landscape and lighting is particularly amenable to the creation of art.

Most of the original buildings have now vanished or lie in ruins, but there are some interesting buildings that remain, including the &quot;Silverton Hotel&quot; and the Silverton Gaol. By 2007, Silverton had been the scene for more than 140 films and commercials thanks to the light, the character-filled colonial buildings and its scenic desert surrounds.

The hotel has been seen in several productions, and its inside walls are covered with memorabilia. These productions include &quot;Razorback&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot;, &quot;The Flying Doctors&quot;, and &quot;Dirty Deeds&quot;. A &#x27;lookalike&#x27; of the famous Mad Max car the &#x27;Interceptor&#x27; was on display outside the hotel from 2002 but has since been sold and is no longer there. There is now, however, a privately owned &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; Museum that pays homage to the movie that was filmed in the region, with much memorabilia and housing two Interceptor replicas. The Silverton Hotel was used in the series &quot;800 Words&quot; as the location where Woody tracked down his wife to sign divorce papers.

==Silverton cemetery==
Just outside town, there is the Silverton cemetery (GPS ). It houses 402 identified grave sites and has an area of .

<doc id="1036056" wikidata="Q336913" url="?curid=1036056" title="Neelam Sanjiva Reddy">
<text>Neelam Sanjiva Reddy (19 May 1913 – 1 June 1996) was an Indian politician who served as the president of India, serving from 1977 to 1982. Beginning a long political career with the Indian National Congress Party in the independence movement, he went on to hold several key offices in independent India – as deputy chief minister of Andhra state and the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, a two-time Speaker of the Lok Sabha and a Union Minister— before becoming the Indian president.

Born in present-day Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh, Reddy completed his schooling at Adayar and joined the Government Arts College at Anantapur. He quit to become an Indian independence activist and was jailed for participating in the Quit India Movement. He was elected to the Madras Legislative Assembly in 1946 as a Congress party representative. Reddy became the deputy chief minister of Andhra State in 1953 and the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh in 1956. He was a union cabinet minister under Prime Ministers Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi from 1964 to 1967 and Lok Sabha Speaker from 1967 to 1969. He later retired from active politics but returned in 1975, responding to Jayaprakash Narayan&#x27;s call for &quot;Total Revolution&quot; against the Indira Gandhi Government.

Elected to Parliament in 1977 as a candidate of the Janata Party, Reddy was unanimously elected speaker of the 6th Lok Sabha and three months later, was elected unopposed as president of India. As president, Reddy worked with prime ministers Morarji Desai, Charan Singh, and Indira Gandhi. Reddy was succeeded by Zail Singh in 1982, and he retired to his farm in Anantapur. He died in 1996 and his &quot;samadhi&quot; is at Kalpally Burial Ground, Bangalore. In 2013, the Government of Andhra Pradesh commemorated Reddy&#x27;s birth centenary.

== Education and family ==
Reddy was born into a Telugu Hindu family in Illur village, Madras Presidency (present-day Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh) on 19 May 1913. He studied at the Theosophical High School at Adayar in Madras and later enrolled at the Government Arts College at Anantapur, an affiliate of the University of Madras, as an undergraduate. In 1958, Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati bestowed the degree of Honorary Doctor of Laws on him because of his role in its founding.

Reddy was married to Neelam Nagaratnamma, the sister of politician T. Nagi Reddy. The couple had one son and three daughters.

== Role in the Indian independence movement ==
Reddy joined the Indian struggle for independence from the British Raj following Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s visit to Anantapur in July 1929 and dropped out of college in 1931. He was closely associated with the Youth League and participated in a student satyagraha. In 1938, Reddy was elected Secretary of the Andhra Pradesh Provincial Congress Committee, an office he held for ten years. During the Quit India Movement, he was imprisoned and was mostly in jail between 1940 and 1945. Released in March 1942, he was arrested again in August and sent to the Amraoti jail where he served time with activists T Prakasam, S. Satyamurti, K Kamaraj and V V Giri till 1945.

==Political career==
Elected to the Madras Legislative Assembly in 1946 as a Congress representative, Reddy became secretary of the Congress&#x27; legislature party. He was also a Member of the Indian Constituent Assembly from Madras. From April 1949 to April 1951, he was the Minister for Prohibition, Housing and Forests of the Madras State. Reddy lost the 1951 election to the Madras Legislative Assembly to the Communist leader Tarimela Nagi Reddy, his brother-in-law.

=== Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra State ===
In 1951, in a closely contested election, he was elected President of the Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee defeating N G Ranga. When the Andhra State was formed in 1953, T. Prakasam became its Chief Minister and Reddy became the deputy.

=== Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh (1956–60, 1962–64) ===
After the formation of the state of Andhra Pradesh by incorporating Telangana with the Andhra State, Reddy became its first Chief Minister from 1 November 1956 to 11 January 1960. He was Chief Minister for a second time from 12 March 1962 to 20 February 1964, thus holding that office for over five years. Reddy was MLA from Sri Kalahasti and Dhone respectively during his stints as Chief Minister. The Nagarjuna Sagar and Srisailam multipurpose river valley projects were initiated during his tenure. The Government of Andhra Pradesh later renamed the Srisailam project to Neelam Sanjiva Reddy Sagar in his honour.

The Congress governments under Reddy placed emphasis on rural development, agriculture and allied sectors. The shift towards industrialisation remained limited and was largely driven by the central government&#x27;s investments in large public sector enterprises in the state. Reddy&#x27;s first term as Chief Minister ended in 1960 after he resigned on being elected President of the Indian National Congress. In 1964, he resigned voluntarily following unfavourable observations made against the Government of Andhra Pradesh by the Supreme Court in the Bus Routes Nationalisation case.

=== Congress President (1960–62) and Union Minister (1964–67) ===
Reddy served thrice as President of the Indian National Congress at its Bangalore, Bhavnagar and Patna sessions during 1960 to 1962. At the Congress session at Goa in 1962, Reddy&#x27;s speech stating India&#x27;s determination to end the Chinese occupation of Indian territory and the irrevocable nature of the liberation of Goa was enthusiastically received by attendees. He was thrice member of the Rajya Sabha. From June 1964, Reddy was Union Minister of Steel and Mines in the Lal Bahadur Shastri government. He also served as Union Minister of Transport, Civil Aviation, Shipping and Tourism from January 1966 to March 1967 in Indira Gandhi&#x27;s Cabinet.

=== Speaker of the Lok Sabha (1967–69) ===
In the general elections of 1967, Reddy was elected to the Lok Sabha from Hindupur in Andhra Pradesh. On 17 March 1967, Reddy was elected Speaker of the Fourth Lok Sabha becoming only the third person to be elected Speaker of the house during their inaugural term. To emphasize the independence of the Speaker&#x27;s office, Reddy resigned from the Congress Party. His term as Speaker was marked by several firsts including the admission of a No-Confidence Motion on the same day as the President&#x27;s address to a joint session of Parliament, the handing down of a sentence of imprisonment for Contempt of the house and the setting up of the Committee on the Welfare of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. During his term as Speaker a defamation suit filed against him by an MP resulted in the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling that parliamentarians had complete freedom of speech in the House and that the courts had no say in such matters. Reddy described his role as being the &#x27;watchman of the Parliament&#x27;. He however had several hostile encounters with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the House that proved costly when he became, two years later, the Congress Party&#x27;s nominee to succeed Zakir Hussain as president.

=== Presidential election of 1969 ===
In 1969, following President Zakir Husain&#x27;s death, the Congress party nominated Reddy, a member of its Syndicate faction, as candidate for president although Prime Minister Indira Gandhi opposed him. She was forced to accept Reddy as the Congress party&#x27;s official candidate and feared his election would allow the Syndicate to expel her from office. She asked Congress legislators to &quot;vote according to their conscience&quot; rather than blindly toe the Party line, in effect giving a call to support the independent candidate V V Giri. In a closely fought election held on 16 August 1969, V V Giri emerged victorious, winning 48.01 per cent of the first preference votes and subsequently getting a majority on counting the second preference votes. In the final tally, Giri had votes against the quota of votes required to be elected president and Reddy had votes. The election led to much discord within the Congress Party and culminated in the historic split of 1969 and the subsequent rise of Indira Gandhi in Indian politics.

Subsequently, Reddy, who had resigned as Speaker of the Lok Sabha to contest the election, retired from active politics and moved back to Anantapur where he took to farming.

=== Return to active politics (1975–82) ===
In response to Jayaprakash Narayan&#x27;s call for a Total Revolution, Reddy emerged from his political exile in 1975. In January 1977, he was made a member of the Committee of the Janata Party and in March, he fought the General Election from the Nandyal (Lok Sabha constituency) in Andhra Pradesh as a Janata Party candidate. He was the only non-Congress candidate to be elected from Andhra Pradesh. The Congress Party led by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was defeated, ending 30 years of Congress rule in India and a five party coalition with Morarji Desai as its leader came to power. Reddy was unanimously elected Speaker of the Sixth Lok Sabha on 26 March 1977. However he resigned a few months later to contest in the presidential elections of July 1977. Reddy&#x27;s second term as Speaker lasted three months and 17 days and remains till date the shortest tenure for anyone to have held that post.

=== Presidential election of 1977 ===
The presidential election of 1977 was necessitated by the death in office of the incumbent Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed. Although Prime Minister Morarji Desai wanted to nominate danseuse Rukmini Devi Arundale for the post, she turned down the offer. Reddy was elected unopposed, the only President to be elected thus, after being unanimously supported by all political parties including the opposition Congress party. At 64, he was the youngest person to be elected President of India until Droupadi Murmu was elected President in 2022. He was also the only serious presidential candidate to have contested twice – in 1969 against V V Giri and in 1977. 37 candidates had filed their nominations for the presidency of whom 36 were rejected by the returning officer. Following these disqualifications, Reddy remained the only validly nominated candidate in the fray which made elections unnecessary. Reddy thus became the first person to be elected President of India without a contest and remains the only President to have been elected unopposed.

==President of India==

Neelam Sanjiva Reddy was elected on 21 July 1977 and was sworn in as the sixth President of India on 25 July 1977. Reddy worked with three governments, with Prime Ministers Morarji Desai, Charan Singh and Indira Gandhi. Reddy announced, on the eve of India&#x27;s thirtieth anniversary of Independence, that he would be moving out of the Rashtrapati Bhawan to a smaller accommodation and that he would be taking a 70 percent pay cut in solidarity with India&#x27;s impoverished masses.

=== Morarji Desai government (1977–79) ===

Relations between Reddy and Desai soon soured over the latter&#x27;s promotion of his son, Kanti Desai, in politics and over Desai&#x27;s communication with Chief Ministers Vengala Rao and Channa Reddy on the issue of land ceilings in Andhra Pradesh. Following mass defections from the Janata Party and from the cabinet, Morarji Desai&#x27;s 30-month-old government ended in July 1979 after he handed in his resignation to Reddy before a no-confidence motion could be tabled against his government in Parliament. Reddy&#x27;s actions following Desai&#x27;s resignation have been much debated. His decision to accept Desai&#x27;s resignation before an alternative government created a ministerial vacuum in the executive according to H. M. Seervai. The faction of the Janata Party supporting Desai continued to have the support of 205 MPs as opposed to Charan Singh&#x27;s 80 MPs. Reddy used presidential discretion in choosing Charan Singh as the next Prime Minister over a contending claim from Jagjivan Ram, the leader of the Janata Party.

=== Charan Singh government (1979) ===

Following Desai&#x27;s resignation and the fall of the Janata government headed by him, Reddy appointed Charan Singh as prime minister. This was on the condition that he should prove his majority on the floor of the House before the end of August. Singh was sworn in on 28 July 1979 but never faced Parliament to prove his majority when Reddy convened it on 20 August. Reddy had appointed him Prime Minister since he had produced a letter claiming to have a parliamentary majority with the support of the opposition Congress Party led by his rival, the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In return for her support, Gandhi demanded that a law establishing special courts to try her and her son Sanjay Gandhi be repealed – a proposition that was unacceptable to Charan Singh. Gandhi therefore withdrew her support, forcing Singh to resign. His government lasted 24 days and he never faced Parliament. The convention of appointing a prime minister in a hung House but with conditions on time to prove majority was later adopted by President R Venkataraman.

Following Charan Singh&#x27;s resignation, Reddy summoned Chandrashekhar and Jagjivan Ram to Rashtrapati Bhavan to look into the possibility of forming an alternate government. Reddy, convinced that they would not be able to form one, accepted Singh&#x27;s advice and dissolved Lok Sabha, calling for a mid term election. Singh was asked to continue as the caretaker prime minister till a new government was sworn in after the election. Reddy&#x27;s decision was met with angry denunciations and protests by members of the Janata Party who even threatened to have him impeached. Although heading a caretaker government, Singh proposed as many as seven ordinances on a broad range of matters from effecting changes in company law, providing state funding of elections and reservation of jobs for the backward classes. Reddy however refused to promulgate the ordinances arguing that such momentous changes could not be made by a caretaker government.

=== Indira Gandhi&#x27;s return to power (1980–82) ===

In the elections of 1980, Indira Gandhi&#x27;s party the Indian National Congress (I) returned to power by winning 351 seats in the Lok Sabha. Neither the Janata Party nor Charan Singh&#x27;s Lok Dal won the 54 seats needed for recognition as the official opposition in Parliament. Indira was sworn in as prime minister by Reddy for what would become her last term in office in January 1980. Between 1980 and 1982 President Reddy led seven state visits abroad, visiting the USSR, Bulgaria, Kenya, Zambia, the UK, Ireland, Indonesia, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Yugoslavia. At home, as president, he signed an ordinance that gave the new government wide powers to imprison people for up to a year without trial under preventive detention and ordered the imposition of President&#x27;s rule in nine opposition-ruled states on the advice of the government.
== Later life and death ==

Reddy was succeeded as president by Giani Zail Singh, who was sworn in on 25 July 1982. In his farewell address to the nation, Reddy criticised the failure of successive governments in improving the lives of the Indian masses and called for the emergence of a strong political opposition to prevent governmental misrule. Following his presidential term, the then Chief Minister of Karnataka Ramakrishna Hegde invited Reddy to settle down in Bangalore but he chose to retire to his farm in Anantapur. He died of pneumonia in Bangalore in 1996 at the age of 83. His &quot;samadhi&quot; is at Kalpally Burial Ground, Bangalore. Parliament mourned Reddy&#x27;s death on 11 June 1996 and members cutting across party lines paid him tribute and recalled his contributions to the nation and the House.

Reddy authored a book, &quot;Without Fear or Favour: Reminiscences and Reflections of a President&quot;, published in 1989.

== Commemoration ==
Sanjiva Reddy&#x27;s birth centenary was celebrated in 2013 by the Government of Andhra Pradesh with the concluding ceremony in Anantapur being addressed by President Pranab Mukherjee and with the Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in attendance. The Postal Department of India released a commemorative stamp and special cover in honour of Reddy on the occasion of his birth centenary. In Hyderabad, there is the Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy College of Education. As part of the centenary celebrations of his birth, the Government of Andhra Pradesh has announced that it will rename the Andhra Pradesh State Revenue Academy, Reddy&#x27;s alma mater the Government Arts College and the Government Medical College, Anantapur after the former president. In the 1960s, when he was Union Minister for Mines, a statue of him had been unveiled at Vijayawada by K. Kamaraj, the then president of the Congress Party, prompting Reddy to ask for its removal as he deemed the practice of erecting statues of people holding public office undesirable. A statue of Sanjiva Reddy, unveiled in 2005, stands at the Andhra Pradesh Secretariat (now Telangana Secretariat) in Hyderabad.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Neelam Sanjiva Reddy – President of India&quot; is a 1982 short documentary film directed by Prem Vaidya &amp; C. L. Kaul and produced by the Films Division of India, covering his term of presidency.

The character Mahendranath, Chief Minister of the fictional state of Afrozabad in former Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Insider&quot;, is based on Reddy, portraying his career in Andhra Pradesh and his political rivalry with Kasu Brahmananda Reddy.

It lacks the caponiers or musketry galleries of the otherwise similar Eastbourne Redoubt. Beyond the moat, an earth bank or glacis helped to protect the masonry from artillery fire. Built on two stories, the upper floor had open emplacements for ten 24 pounder guns mounted on wooden traversing platforms. The lower floor featured twenty-four vaulted barrack and storage casemates that opened onto a circular parade ground. They were designed to accommodate 350 officers and men. Entry was originally via a wooden footbridge supported by stilts, which could be collapsed in an emergency.

==History==
The design and purpose of the redoubt were finalised at a conference in Rochester in 1804. It was built between 1804 and 1812 to support a chain of 21 Martello Towers that stretched between Hythe in Kent and Rye in Sussex, and to act as a supply depot for them. It specifically protected the sluices that were the key to the drainage of Romney Marsh. By the time it was finished, the invasion threat was over. During World War I, it was used for troop accommodation, although there was a question in Parliament about the damp conditions. In World War II, the south coast was again at risk of invasion, and two 6 inch breech-loading guns were mounted in casemates built over the original gun emplacements. A prominent battery observation post was built and pillboxes were sited on the parapet in order to repel an infantry attack. It was fully operational by 1942 as an Emergency Coastal Battery. After the war, the observation post was used as a Coastguard lookout and radar was installed to monitor shipping in the English Channel. The army constructed a mock-up of a street of buildings in the interior, for training in urban warfare. The redoubt remains the property of the Ministry of Defence. It is a Scheduled Monument and is listed by English Heritage as a Building at Risk, although a conservation plan has been agreed.

==Location==
The Dymchurch Redoubt is located on the south (seaward) side of the A259 main road roughly halfway between the village of Dymchurch and the town of Hythe. It is located on the edge of the Palmarsh community, and about two miles from Dymchurch, whose name it bears. It is not open to the public, but walking along the sea wall allows a close approach on the south side. Further access may be restricted when there is firing on Hythe Ranges. When the ranges are in use, prominent red flags are flown, supplemented by red lights during night firing practice. Due to the risk of ricochet during firing, a Range Safety Boat is present to prevent boats entering the danger area.
