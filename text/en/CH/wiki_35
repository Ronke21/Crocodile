<text>Norrköping ( , ) is a city in the province of Östergötland in eastern Sweden and the seat of Norrköping Municipality, Östergötland County, about 160 km southwest of the national capital Stockholm, 40 km east of county seat Linköping and 60 km west of the Södermanland capital of Nyköping. The city has a population of 95,618 inhabitants in 2016, out of a municipal total of 130,050, making it Sweden&#x27;s tenth largest city and eighth largest municipality.

The city is situated by the mouth of the river Motala ström, at Bråviken, an inlet of the Baltic Sea. Water power from the Motala ström and the good harbour were factors that facilitated the rapid growth of this once industrial city, known for its textile industry. It has several nicknames such as: &quot;Sweden&#x27;s Manchester&quot;, &quot;Peking&quot; and &quot;Surbullestan&quot; (Surbulle [sour bun] was a local nickname for the textile workers, and stan is short for Staden, which means The City or The Town in Swedish).

==History==
In 1993–1994, archaeological excavations at Borg in Norrköping revealed a farmstead established in the 7th century and continuously used through the Middle Ages, later becoming a royal manor under King Magnus Eriksson in the 14th century. Structures dating from the late 7th century to around 1000 AD were uncovered, along with evidence of ritual activities beginning in the 8th century and a possible cult building. It has been theorized that the farmstead&#x27;s location, near but not at the highest point in the landscape, may indicate an earlier burial ground adjacent to which the farm was constructed.

The city has medieval foundations by settlers around the Motala stream estuary, who used the falls and rapids to power their mills. The stream was also full of fish such as salmon. Exact dates are uncertain, but there are mentions of a church in the 12th century. It was dedicated to Saint Olaf, Norway&#x27;s patron.

The first trace of the city&#x27;s name is from 1283, when Sophia of Denmark donated her rights of salmon fishing to the Skänninge monastery. The town is estimated to have received city status in the early 14th century, although no written documents exist prior to a document from 1384. This document, signed by Albrekt of Sweden is stored in the city archive today. Köping means there was a market there, while Nörr or Norr means &quot;north&quot;. There is a smaller town nearby named Söderköping, or &quot;South market&quot;.

The city was the location of several battles in the ensuing centuries. As a consequence, nothing of the medieval Norrköping remains today. During the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War (1563–1570), the entire southern part of Norrköping was burnt. It was rebuilt by John III of Sweden, who designed the current street pattern.

In 1618, a weapon industry was established by supervision of Gustavus Adolphus. The harbour also attracted ships due to its proximity to the industries of Finspång. In addition to the weapon industry, a large scale industry of textile was also initiated. An important benefactor was the industrial man Louis De Geer (1587–1652). At De Geer&#x27;s death, Norrköping had 6,000 inhabitants and was Sweden&#x27;s second largest city.

The city again burnt in 1655, and again in 1719 during the Russian Pillage of 1719-21 when the Russians burnt it to the ground. Stones from the Johannisborg castle were used to build new houses, and today only a few stones remain.

During the 18th century it was rebuilt and several industries soon got a stronghold: In the 1740s, Norrköping boasted three sugar refineries; in the 1750s the large scale influential snus industry was established. From this time stems the city churches of Saint Olof and Saint Hedvig, and several other old houses. In 1762, the first theater in Sweden outside of Stockholm was established in the city, the Egges Teater.

Norrköping&#x27;s importance again flourished. In 1769 the Swedish Riksdag assembled there. In 1800 King Gustav IV of Sweden was crowned in the Church of Saint Olof.

In the later 18th and early 19th Centuries, Norrköping was one of the three Swedish cities where Jews were allowed to live (see History of the Jews in Sweden).

The city again suffered fires in 1822 and 1826. Thereafter wooden houses were banned. In 1841 a ship industry was initiated as a branch of Motala Verkstad in Motala. In 1850 the industry had over 600 employees making it Sweden&#x27;s largest ship industry at the time. During the remaining 19th century, the industries kept expanding. The area by the Motala Stream was developed further with the construction of a cotton refinery, and a paper mill was constructed in 1854, specializing in newspaper, and is still today exporting to customers around the world.

The industry, including textile manufacturers, also expanded into the 20th century. In 1950 a total of 54 factories had 6,600 employees in town. By 1956, however, 18 of them had been closed due to competition from countries abroad with lower wages, such as Italy and Japan. In 1970 only 10 factories and 1,200 employees remained. In that year, the renowned Holmen paper mill, with its 350 years long history, announced closure, and another 900 people were let go. To counter the effects, several governmental authorities were relocated to Norrköping from Stockholm. See also Braviken Paper Mill.

As of 2002, Norrköping is now seeing a revival, as a center of culture and education. The Norrköping symbol represents the &quot;new&quot; Norrköping.

==Main sights==
The Motala ström river flows through the city has a parade annexed. In connection to the latter is the industrial landscape where the old textile industries once were situated.

In the summer, there is a cactus plantation in &quot;Carl Johans Park&quot;. 25,000 cacti are planted there every summer.

Kolmårdens Djurpark is a zoo located north of Norrköping. In connection to the large outdoor zoo, there is also Tropicariet, an aquarium, where for example snakes, crocodiles and sharks can be seen.

The archipelagos away from Norrköping are called St Anna and Gryt.

Other locations of note includes a campus of Linköping University, its own symphonic orchestra, an airport called Kungsängen with 170,000 traveling (2006), a high-tech industry park called Norrköping Science Park, and Petroglyphs from the Nordic Bronze Age.

== Climate==
Norrköping had a humid continental climate (Dfb) for the reference period of 1961–1990, but it was borderline four-season oceanic (Cfb) during that period and has since more resembled the latter, with somewhat warmer temperatures year-round. In spite of it being located near the Baltic Sea, Norrköping has a relatively dry climate with precipitation levels averaging between 1961 and 1990. That would in turn be very low for a marine climate, but some way above more arid climates. The humidity for most of the year combined with there being no pronounced dry season keeps the surroundings green in spite of the rain shadow effect. Winter precipitation is quite low, but often falls as snow. On August 26, 2016, Norrköping set a nationwide record for the hottest temperature in the latter parts of August with during a sudden and brief burst of extreme heat. The warmest temperature on record was set in July 2022 with .

The Dagsbergsfältet track staged a qualifying round of the Speedway World Championship in 1954.

==Government agencies==
As part of the Swedish government decentralisation policies of the 1960s and 1970s, a number of government agencies saw their national headquarters relocated from Stockholm to other parts of the country. A government inquiry suggested in 1970 that six such agencies should be relocated to Norrköping, with a particular focus on maritime and aviation transport and related services.
After parliamentary debate, five agencies were established in Norrköping over a period of years in the early 1970s. While reorganized, restructured and renamed, in general, the same agencies are still headquartered in Norrköping, namely:

* Air Navigation Services of Sweden 
* Swedish Maritime Administration
* Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute
* Swedish Migration Agency
* Swedish Prison and Probation Service

The establishment of government agencies in Norrköping was partly understood as a response to the decline in the textile industry, which had struck Norrköping hard in the 1960s. The city needed new jobs. The relocation of government jobs, however, also meant a major shift in the structure of the city labour market. Unqualified or highly structured industrial work in the private sector was replaced by more than 1 400 qualified and independent work positions in the public sector.

At a later point, the Norrköping cluster of transport authorities was augmented by one more:

* Swedish Transport Agency ()

In 1997, a state university also opened a subsidiary campus in Norrköping, again, relating to the industry changes and being an important part of the government response to unemployment and labour market policy. Although not a headquarter, it is the seventh government agency stationed in Norrköping, and with more than 5 000 students on campus it is a major hub of activities in the city.

* Linköping University, Campus Norrköping

==Logistics and Infrastructure==
With a deep sea harbour, a position on the Southern Main Line railway, Norrköping Airport and being the intersection of European route E4 and European route E22, Norrköping is particularly well situated for logistics related business. This is further underlined by the presence of three transport related government agencies, the national weather services and Linköping University transports and logistics research and education programmes in place. 

Norrköping is highly involved in the East Link, &quot;Ostlänken&quot;, which will increase travel speed and freight capacity on the Southern Main Line. As preparation, the &quot;Kardonbanan&quot; freight feeder line from Norrköping Harbour to the Southern Main Line was inaugurated in February 2021. A new freight railway terminal and a relocation of Norrköping Central Station is currently being studied.

Norrköping is one of two Swedish cities (the other being Gothenburg) that retained its tram system after the 1967 conversion to right-hand drive, see Norrköping Tramway.

<text>Motala () is a locality and the seat of Motala Municipality, Östergötland County, Sweden with a municipal population of 43,717 inhabitants in 2024. It is the third largest city of Östergötland, following Linköping and Norrköping. Motala is situated on the eastern shore of Lake Vättern and is regarded as the main centre of both the Göta Canal and the surrounding lake region.

== History ==

Motala Church dates from the 13th century. For several centuries, Motala remained a small village, mainly regarded as a stopping post on the road to the nearby town of Vadstena, one of the cultural centres of medieval Sweden. However, King Gustav Vasa had a manor house built at Motala and later Queen Kristina had a summer residence built at the spa resort of Medevi, north of the town.

When the Göta Canal was built in the early 19th century, Motala became an important town for the trade on the canal. The builder of the canal, Baltzar von Platen, has his grave beside it. The town received the minor privilege status of &quot;köping&quot; in 1823, while full city rights were granted as of April 1, 1881. With the Swedish municipal reform of 1971, Motala became the seat of Motala Municipality.

Motala Verkstad is an engineering company specialising in bridge and railway construction equipment. In the 1870 science fiction novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; by Jules Verne, the prow of the submarine &quot;Nautilus&quot; was built at Motala Verkstad. Later major Swedish industrial manufacturers such as Electrolux and Luxor had their main factories built in the city.

In 1963, Tetra Pak installed the first Tetra Brik packaging machine in Motala.

== Climate ==
Motala has a temperate climate. Lake Vättern provides Motala with slightly cooler summers and milder winters compared to areas of inner Östergötland (± compared to the nearby city of Linköping). The warmest month is July with an average daily mean temperature at , and an average daytime temperature at . The coldest month is February with an average daily mean at , and an average daytime temperature at . Record temperatures between 1961 and 1990, as registered by Motala Kraftverk weather station, reaches from in February 1985 to in August 1975. The most recent data is from Swedish Armed Forces&#x27; weather station located approximately 30 km north-east of the city centre. Its inland position renders greater diurnal temperature difference. In addition the geographic location makes seasonal lag is less visible compared to station located near Vättern. 
Motala generally experiences much rainfall, with the wettest month being August with an average of of rain. The driest month is March, with an average of of rain.

== Longwave radio ==
Another important episode of Motala history began in 1927, when the Swedish national Motala longwave transmitter station was built. The town marks the middle of a straight line between Sweden&#x27;s two biggest cities, Stockholm and Gothenburg. Radio programs were transferred from studios in Stockholm to Motala by telephone wire. The call was &quot;Stockholm-Motala&quot;. The transmitter operated on 191 kHz until 1962, when the transmissions were moved to Orlunda. Since 1991 there have been no longwave transmissions at all by the Swedish Broadcasting Company, but the Motala transmitter, which is a museum today, sometimes makes low power transmissions which may only be received in the Motala area.

At Ervasteby, near Motala, there is a tall guyed mast, used for FM- and TV-broadcasting.

Some years before the broadcasting station was established the Luxor company was founded in Motala. Luxor soon became one of the largest radio and later television manufacturers in Sweden. In the 1980s Luxor started producing their own line of computers, like the ABC 80. In 1985 Luxor was acquired by Nokia, and eventually production moved elsewhere.

<doc id="1019543" wikidata="Q2571758" url="?curid=1019543" title="Cloyne">
<text>Cloyne () is a small town located to the southeast of Midleton in eastern County Cork, Ireland. It is also a see city of the Anglican (Church of Ireland) Diocese of Cork, Cloyne and Ross, while also giving its name to a Roman Catholic diocese. The town is in a civil parish of the same name. St Colman&#x27;s Cathedral in Cloyne is a cathedral church of the Church of Ireland while the Pro Cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cloyne, Cobh Cathedral of Saint Colman, overlooks Cork Harbour. Cloyne is within the Cork East Dáil constituency.
==History==

The first evidence of settlement in Cloyne is a 4000-year-old portal dolmen that lies to the West of the town. The bishopric of Cloyne was founded by St. Colman Mac Léníne, (530–606 A.D.) as his principal monastery in the sixth century. The origin legend &quot;Conall Corc and the Corco Loígde&quot; claims that the land for the foundation of the monastery was not given by the local king, but by Coirpre mac Crimthainn (d. &quot;c&quot;. 580 A.D.), who was king of Munster from the Eóganacht Glendamnach:
:Coirpre mac Crimthainn it was who gave Cloyne to God and to Colman mac Colcon who is also called Mac Lénéne and Aired Cechtraige and Cell Náile. Because of this they [the Eoganacht Glendamnach] are entitled to secular rule.
The Danes plundered Cloyne in 822, 824 and again in 885 when, according to the Annals of the Four Masters, the Abbot and Prior of the monastery were killed. The Annals of Inisfallen mention that in 978 A.D. the people of Ossory plundered Cloyne and that in 1088 A.D. Diarmait Ua Briain devastated it. Cloyne was recognised as a diocese at the Synod of Kells in 1152. The only major action of the Irish War of Independence in Cloyne was on 4 May 1920 when Irish Republican Army volunteers of the Fourth Battalion attacked the local Royal Irish Constabulary barracks. The volunteers at first failed to gain entry but succeed in setting fire to the building, which resulted in the entire surrender of the garrison. The prisoners had their hands tied before being ordered to march the road to Midleton while the flying column made their escape.

==Climate and geography==

Cloyne is situated approximately 7.6 kilometres from the major town of Midleton. The town is located at the bottom of a valley and is surrounded by large hills to the North and South as well as the Celtic Sea to the East and Cork Harbour to the West.

Being only 2 miles (3.2 km) from Cork harbour and 3.5 miles (5.6 km) from the open ocean, Cloyne has a mild climate with few extremes of temperature. The highest recorded temperature was 31.1 °C (88.0 °F), on 3 August 1995 and the lowest was −7.1 °C (19.2 °F), recorded on 2 January 1979 and also on 13 January 1987.

The climate of Cloyne is mild all year round, with an average of only six days of frost each year. Snow is almost unknown, with notable exceptions in March 1993, January 2010, and Storm Emma in March 2018. 2010 was also one of the frostiest years recorded for the Cloyne area, with 62 days recording an air frost, over 10 times the average.

Rainfall averages around 1041 mm (41.5 in) per annum, with the wettest weather usually occurring between October and January. The driest year ever recorded was in 1975 when 583.7 mm fell, while the wettest was in 2009 with 1433.4 mm.

==Places of interest==

Cloyne has a round tower which is the town&#x27;s symbol. The tower dates back to about 560 A.D. when St. Colman founded his monastery. In 1749 a lightning strike caused some damage to the top of the tower. There is also ruins of a Norman watchtower on a hill overlooking the town. The Church of Ireland in Cloyne, St. Colman&#x27;s Cathedral, was first founded in 1250 AD. The local Roman Catholic church, St. Colmans, was built in 1815 and celebrates Mass every day of the week.

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 Census, people of Irish ethnicity make up 86.2% of the population with mostly Polish and British people making up the rest. In terms of religion, 87% of Cloyne&#x27;s population are Roman Catholic, 7% belong to other religions (e.g. Church of Ireland, Presbyterian, Islam) and 6% state no religion. 601 persons could speak the Irish language and 71 people could speak Polish.

==Economy==
The land around Cloyne is rich and fertile, being mainly of limestone base. This makes it suitable for agriculture, with many acres of wheat and barley harvested each year. The underlying limestone rock also gives rise to a network of caves under and to the south of the town. Cloyne Cave, which is the biggest in County Cork, is estimated to be up to 7 km long. A section of the main street collapsed into the caves during the 20th century. The cave is accessible from the grounds of Cloyne House on Rock Street. (Permission must be sought from the owner as these are private grounds). The town has a number of pubs and small shops in the centre of town while there is also a Thai and traditional Irish restaurant in the town.

<text>Landskrona is a town in Scania, Sweden. Located on the shores of the Öresund, it occupies a natural port, which has lent the town at first military and subsequent commercial significance. Ferries operate from Landskrona to the island of Ven, and for many years there was also a connection to Copenhagen. Landskrona is part of the Øresund region.

It is the seat of Landskrona Municipality. Landskrona is also the name of a district in Landskrona Municipality which is slightly smaller than the urban area.

==History==
The city of Landskrona is usually claimed to have been founded in 1413 by the King of Denmark, Eric of Pomerania, as a trading city intended to compete with Danish towns under the control of the Hanseatic League. There is, however, evidence found in the Danish National Archive, which mention the town by the name &quot;Landzcrone&quot; already in 1405.

The site occupies one of a few natural harbours in Scania, which at that time was part of Denmark. At the time of foundation, the site held a fishing settlement named &quot;Sønder Sæby&quot;. The original name of the officially founded town was &quot;Landszcrone&quot;, which changed to &quot;Landskrone&quot; sometime before 1450.

A Carmelite monastery was founded in 1410, English merchants were granted the privileges in a royal charter in 1412, and the town itself was chartered in 1413. The monastery was closed by King Christian III after the reformation, but survives in the name of the street &quot;Karmelitergatan&quot;.

Construction of Landskrona Citadel started in the 1540s under the orders of Christian III. The castle was completed in 1559, and consisted of a fortress with a surrounding wall and moat. A huge system of moats was constructed around the castle over the centuries; parts of four of the moats survive. Sweden&#x27;s second, and oldest surviving, allotment area is located in the northern part of the citadel.

The town supported the king Christian II in 1525, and opposed the Reformation in Denmark (1535); in both cases it found itself on the losing side. The reformist king Christian III of Denmark opted not to retaliate against the town, and instead founded a castle to protect the harbour. The castle, built where the monastery had been situated until the Reformation, was completed by 1559.

After Scania was ceded to Sweden in 1658, the good harbour and strong fort motivated plans to make Landskrona a commercial center of the acquired territory, with extraordinary privileges for foreign trade. The castle was reinforced by bastions, and the area inside the moats extended to 400x400 meters. The castle was considered the strongest and most modern in Scandinavia, but was temporarily lost to the Danes after a comparably short siege lasting from July 8 to August 2, 1676. The commandant, Colonel Hieronymus Lindeberg, was consequently sentenced to death for high treason. During the Danish occupation in 1676–1679, Landskrona Citadel constituted a mobilisation centre for formal enlistment of pro-Danish guerrilla fighters.

In 1753 the Swedish military commander feared that the tower of Sancti Johannis Baptistae church could be a threat to the citadel and demanded the demolition of the church. Even though the cornerstone of the new Sofia Albertina Church was laid the following year, it was not inaugurated until 1788, and was finally completed in 1812. Unusually for a church that is not a diocesan seat, the new church was built with two towers, possibly in compensation for its much larger medieval predecessor.

Landskrona&#x27;s military importance declined after the 18th century. The continued Swedish–Danish wars led to Karlskrona replacing Landskrona as a naval base, as it is located at a safer distance from Denmark. Although the fortifications at Landskrona were expanded considerably between 1747 and 1788, they were condemned in 1822, whereafter the garrison was abolished in 1869. The last military regiment, &quot;Skånska Husarregimentet, K5&quot; was renamed and moved from Landskrona to Uppsala in 1926. Today the walls and moats of the fortifications of Landskrona Citadel are a recreational area and the castle holds a museum. On the northern side, an allotment-garden area of cottages was founded in the final years of the 19th century, and is today the oldest of its kind in Sweden. The military&#x27;s large exercise field became a public heath, today called &quot;&quot;Exercisfältet&quot; or &quot;Exan&quot;&quot;.

The town grew quickly after the industrial revolution and the subsequent urbanization. During the First World War, a large shipyard, Öresundsvarvet, was constructed. In the mid-1970s the shipyard employed more than 3,500 people, in a town with only 30,000 inhabitants. The shipyard was closed down in stages from the late 1970s, finally closing in 1983.

On 14 May 1919 the Swedish engineer and flight pioneer Enoch Thulin, who lived and worked in Landskrona, died when he crashed his own airplane at the &quot;Södra Fäladen&quot; fields. His funeral service was held in Sofia Albertina Church.

Between 1930 and 1939 the Saxtorp TT-races were held just south of the town. The races attracted up to 160,000 attendees and are considered the largest sporting events by crowd size ever held in Sweden.

==Geography==
=== Townscape ===

The town&#x27;s centre and buildings along the entrance streets generally consist of buildings with between two and seven floors. As a fortified town, stone houses were preferred instead of wooden houses, so the city boasts few examples of traditional Danish and Scanian half-timbered houses. Apart from the Citadel and Sofia Albertina Church, other notable 19th-century or older buildings are &quot;Rådhuset&quot;, the Town Hall, , the old railway station building and the theatre.
Much of the town&#x27;s central parts, and buildings along the entrance roads are characterized by the work of the former town architects &quot;Fredrik Sundbärg&quot; 1901–1913 and &quot;Frans Ekelund&quot; 1913–1949.
Sundberg created a number of monumental buildings such as the old water tower, the school &quot;Tuppaskolan&quot;, the power station, a hot bathhouse (demolished in the 1970s), and two large blocks of flats intended for the working class, &quot;Falken&quot; and &quot;Gripen&quot; .
Ekelund, who was a believer in the Garden city movement, reserved areas for people to build customised homes, typically smaller houses with cellars and two floors.

Ralph Erskine created the row house area called &quot;Esperanza&quot; (Spanish for &quot;hope&quot;) around 1970. The new water tower came into operation the same year.

Around the Town Hall Square, all but one building was built before functionalist architecture became popular. Some older buildings were demolished in the mid-20th century. &quot;Falcks hörna&quot;, a block-corner building with a rather unusual appearance, was demolished in the middle of the night in 1971 amid protests.
A now-defunct water tower in town was built in 1904 after drawings from the then city architect Fredrik Sundbärg and has a height of 65,9 meters. The Water Tower was taken out of use in 1975 and in 1992 parts of the building was converted into rental estate.

===Harbour===


A natural deep harbour has existed here since before the history of the town. It&#x27;s mentioned in the Danish historical work &quot;Saxo Grammaticus&quot; from around 1200 The port is based on a natural chute in the sandy sea floor, despite the lack of any nearby debouching river. Since the 18th century, the harbour has been protected by the artificial island Gråen. In the 1960s it had a total quay length of around 3 km As of 2017 its usable quay length has been greatly reduced, with a tally of approximately 1250 meters of remaining quay, and its activity has been low for decades.

The former car ferries to Copenhagen-Tuborg departed from the &quot;Nyhamn&quot; port, in the northern end. At a common map, it looks like the harbour has two inlets. But the waters immediately south of the harbor are extremely shallow. The northernmost part of Lundåkrabukten, the bay between Landskrona and Barsebäck, is not just shallow, but also largely free of stronger currents. During cold winter periods, Sea ice can then be formed here, much faster than at most other places in Øresund.

===History of the Øresund traffic===
For many years, Landskrona was serviced by car ferries and other ships to and from Copenhagen. From 1951 to 1980 did the SL ferries operate the route between Port of Tuborg in northern Copenhagen and Landskrona. During a larger part of that period, also the &quot;Viking Bådene&quot; operated smaller passenger ships between the Inner Harbour of the Port of Copenhagen and Landskrona. They were owned in Denmark, but from around 1970 they were purchased by the Swedish &quot;Centrumlinjen&quot; but kept their name. The 1973 energy crisis eventually caused the end of this shipping line.

Between 1980 and 1984 different kind of ships and shipping lines offered at least summer time traffic to Copenhagen. And From 1985 Scarlett Line was formed, and once again sailed to Port of Tuborg. From the spring of 1991 did Danish &quot;Vognmandsruten A/S&quot; merge with Scarlett Line, maintained the established name and began to sail every hour. 
The new shipping line mainly was intended to live on transport of lorries. In the autumn of 1993 &quot;Vognmandsruten A/S&quot; went bankrupt and this put an end to the car and lorry ferry traffic from Landskrona.

However, hydrofoil speedboats &quot;Flygbåtarna AB&quot;, which previously only had served passenger traffic in the southern part of Øresund, between Malmö and Copenhagen, now began to operate also from both Landskrona as well as from Helsingborg. Not until March 2002, almost two years after the inauguration of the Øresund Bridge did &quot;Flygbåtarna AB&quot; threw in the towel.

===Allotments===
Landskrona is well known for having several allotment areas in and around the city centre. The first allotment area in Sweden was located in Malmö; however, it has long been gone since. The allotments located between the inner and outer moats of the Landskrona Citadel area make up the oldest allotment area in Sweden currently in use to date and are therefor of historic significance. There are currently around 1400 allotments in total located in Landskrona and its periphery, distributed over 6 allotment areas.

===Copenhagen Airport influence===
Aircraft approaching the nearby Copenhagen Airport to land on Runway 22L pass over the northern part of the town, where they make a sharp right turn towards the south to intercept the localiser around Barsebäck. Most landings at Copenhagen take place at Runway 22L. At the busiest times this can lead to consecutive aircraft passing over Landskrona with less than a minute&#x27;s gap between them.

==Demographics==

From the late Middle Ages to the Industrial Revolution, the town&#x27;s population was fairly stable at around 2,000. Between 1860 and 1918 it grew to a little below 20,000. But from around 1919 until the mid-1970s, Landskrona just grew to some 30,000 inhabitants. Due to the closing of Öresundsvarvet shipyard (only a fraction of its close to 4000 employees work at the &quot;new&quot; renovation shipyard with the same name) and of other heavy industries, the population instead began to fall. Around 1985–1995 Landskrona&#x27;s population were approximately some 25,000. Thanks to the general immigration (both from upper Sweden and from other countries) to western Scania and the Øresund coast, and due to the new railway station (opened in 2001), the town&#x27;s population has again grown, and has once again exceeded 30,000 inhabitants, which equals the situation in the early 1970s. The town had 32,229 inhabitants in 2015.

Landskrona was also relatively larger a century ago compared with today. After World War I the town was among the 15 largest in the country. But no longer holds that position.
Between approx. 1880 and 1920 was the town transformed from a military town to a town with much heavy industry within many sectors. The Öresundsvarvet shipyard, which opened in 1917, became the largest employer (with close to 4000 employees in the early 1970s). But the industry was not limited to shipbuilding, and a sugar refinery, several textile industries, fertilizers and other chemical plants, as well as a spectrum of various manufacturing industries, grew up. But after the First World War, the town stopped growing as fast as many other Swedish towns did. And the very last military regiment moved to Hässleholm in 1924. Between the mid-1920s and mid-1970s the town grew from approx. 20,000 inhabitants to 30,000. And after the Swedish municipality reforms reached its end point, in 1974, the municipality counted around 38,000 inhabitants.

Landskrona has traditionally been seen as a working-class city, with a strong focus on heavy industry. In the 21st century, development has instead tended towards a labour market with services in contemporary industrial production along with a general range of tertiary sector jobs, which has attracted more residents to the city.

== Culture ==
Landskrona Konsthall opened in 1963 in the park attached to Landskrona Citadell. In the surrounding parkland there are sculptures by twenty artists.

Carl Fredrik Reuterswärd, was a Swedish painter and sculptor. He lived in Landskrona at the end of his life and died of pneumonia at Landskrona Hospital, on 3 May 2016, aged 81. He was a professor of painting at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts in Stockholm from 1965 until 1969. In 1974, he was a guest professor at Minneapolis School of Art in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 1986 he was awarded the Prince Eugen Medal for painting. Reuterswärd is known for his sculpture showing a revolver tied in a knot, called &quot;Non violence&quot;, which is exhibited outside the United Nations headquarters in New York City.

British artist Ian Berry, who makes artwork from denim jeans, lived in Landskrona between 2010-2015 and made some of his artwork based on Landskrona and the Oresund Region.

==Sports==

The Landskrona BoIS football club was formed through a merger of two older clubs in 1915. &quot;BoIS&quot; was one of the twelve original football clubs in Sweden&#x27;s premier football league, Allsvenskan. , Landskrona BoIS play in Sweden&#x27;s second-tier league, Superettan. They are based at the Landskrona IP stadium.

Between 1930 and 1939 the annual Saxtorp TT-races motorcycle events saw crowds of up to 160,000. Saxtorp is located some 10–15 km south-east of the town centre.

== Transport ==

The island of Ven can be reached through a regular ferry connection. The ships used for this transport usually depart 9 times a day. Extended service is also available during July and August.

The town&#x27;s first railway station opened in 1863 and was located a short walk from &quot;Rådhustorget&quot;, the City Hall Square. In the 1920s was Landskrona station the western terminal of three railway lines. To Eslöv, Kävlinge (from which some trains continued to Lund and Malmö) and to Billesholm. It&#x27;s notable that during the 1860 to 1940 construction of the Swedish railway network, no railway was built to the nearby city of Helsingborg. 
The line to Billesholm was short-lived and closed before the 1960s. During the mid-1970s the Swedish National Railways, SJ, was considering closing all local train service in the south. But along with other towns and cities in the former Malmöhus län, Landskrona participated in forming a new local railway system, which got the very Scanian name Pågatåg. This new railway system, which opened in a minor scale in 1983, was the first of its kind in Sweden, outside the Stockholm area. 
In connection with the construction of the Øresund Bridge, another train system was introduced, called the Øresundståg. They are Inter-regional trains as well as international ones, and link Denmark and Sweden together via railways. For Landskrona this meant that there was a call for a new location for the station, in order to avoid both the terminal type station, and provide better routing for northbound traffic.
After political discussions it was decided to build a new dual track high speed railway between Helsingborg and Lund, as a part of a planned &quot;West Coast Railway&quot; between Copenhagen and Gothenborg. As Landskrona is located between Helsingborg and Lund, Landskrona was included in the planning for the new railway. But, as the new railway just &quot;touched&quot; the town&#x27;s eastern end, there was a need for a new station in that area. The new Landskrona Station, which opened in January 2001, allowed for a greater range of train operations compared to the old terminal station that accommodated southbound trains only. Today, all local Pågatågen trains and inter-regional Øresundståg trains stop at the new station, which gives the new station a weekday service frequency of 4-6 trains per hour in each direction.

A trolleybus shuttle service, the &quot;Station Shuttle&quot;, was introduced in September 2003, and links the new station with the city centre and the ferry terminal in the harbour. This service is the shortest trolleybus route currently operating in the world.

The new services meant that, as of 2017, Copenhagen Airport can be reached in 50 minutes and central Copenhagen in 65 minutes. It&#x27;s also possible to reach Copenhagen by northbound trains to Helsingborg and then by the HH ferry route make a 20-minute sea travel to Helsingør, and from there take another train to Copenhagen. Although the (initially) northbound route to central Copenhagen includes two changes, the Danish Capital is normally reached in less than 90 minutes.

<text>Coachford () is a village in County Cork, Ireland. It is located on the north side of the River Lee. The village is located in the civil parish of Magourney. Coachford is part of the Dáil constituency of Cork North-West.

Coachford owes its name to once being a crossing point over a stream for horse-drawn coaches, and this stream continues to flow beneath the village to the present day. The Lee was flooded for a hydroelectric power plant and farmland including many houses was flooded by the newly formed lake. Coachford is located around a crossroads where the R618 and R619 regional roads intersect. Mallow is north of the village, Macroom is west, Cork City is east and Bandon is south.

==History==
Coachford does not feature on the 1811 Grand Jury Map of Cork, but is mentioned in the &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, dated 10 January 1822, and the area and its environs were known as &quot;Magourney&quot;. The village developed rapidly during the Famine (when it was a centre of relief within the mid Cork area) and subsequently. By 1888, the Cork &amp; Muskerry Light Railway had a terminus at Coachford, adding to local business, accessibility and vibrancy. By the end of the 19th-century, the village also had a creamery, complimenting its agricultural hinterland.

By the 1950s, a Vocational School was established, known today as Coachford College (sometimes referred to as Coachford Community College). The 2011-15 Aghabullogue-Coachford-Rylane Community Council commissioned URS consultants to draw up a &quot;Village Design Statement&quot; (VDS) for the three villages in 2012.

=== Deaths during the War of Independence and Civil War ===
Mrs. Mary (or Maria) Lindsay, Leemount House, Coachford, an elderly widow, was executed by the IRA (along with her driver, James Clarke), on 9 March 1921. Attempting to prevent bloodshed she, along with a Roman Catholic priest, tried to persuade members of the IRA against a planned ambush. The IRA ignored them and she then warned the British Army of a planned ambush in nearby Dripsey, for which six IRA volunteers were later executed. She and her driver were shot and her home, Leemount House, burned down, after the British authorities refused to commute the executions of the six IRA volunteers. A character (&quot;Lady Fitzhugh&quot;) based on Mrs. Lindsay was played by Dame Sybil Thorndike in the 1959 film, &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot;, which starred James Cagney, Don Murray and Michael Redgrave. An IRA man named Frank Busteed later claimed credit for the killings and for burning down Mrs. Lindsay&#x27;s home.

Near Rooves Bridge is a monument to Captain Tadhg Kennefick of the Irish Republican Army, who was killed during the Irish Civil War by the Free State Army. On his way home to his mother&#x27;s funeral, he was stopped at a checkpoint where Free State soldiers tied him to the back of a truck near a hamlet called Peake and dragged him a distance of four miles (6 km) to the bridge where he was shot by soldiers and his body dumped in a ditch. Local people who witnessed this recovered his body. A monument now stands on the site where his body was recovered. 

==Sites==
Close to Coachford is Mullinhassig Waterfall. It is about west of Coachford just off the Macroom Road. 
About south of Coachford on the road to Bandon is Rooves Bridge, constructed over the River Lee in the 1950s to replace the old bridge which was submerged due to the building of the hydroelectric dam at Inniscarra about down river. Rooves Bridge is the longest bridge spanning the River Lee. 

==Sport and community==
The village is the home of Aghabullogue GAA, best known for capturing Cork&#x27;s first hurling All-Ireland title in 1890 when they defeated Castlebridge, Wexford in the final.

A local amateur drama group, the Coachford Players, was established in 1987 and performs a full-length play each year.

The village is also home to a tennis club, soccer club, a pub, and a Centra. 

==Education==

The village and its environs are served by Coachford National School and Coachford College. The latter is a co-educational secondary school which, as of 2017, had an enrollment of over 610 students. An extension was completed in 2002 and provided the college with a sports hall. In October 2020, funding was allocated for the extension and refurbishment of facilities at Coachford College.

==Transport==
Coachford was formerly connected by railway to Cork City with a narrow gauge railway, opened in 1888 by the Cork and Muskerry Light Railway. The line was closed in 1934 by the GSR. Coachford railway station opened on 19 March 1888, but finally closed on 31 December 1934.

<doc id="1019550" wikidata="Q16385319" url="?curid=1019550" title="Comanche Moon">
<text>Comanche Moon (1997) is a Western novel by American writer Larry McMurtry. It is the fourth and final book he published in the &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; series. In terms of chronology, it is the second installment of the narrative. A Comanche Moon in Texas history was a full moon in autumn which permitted Comanche warriors to ride by night journeying southward to raid Mexico for livestock and captives.

The novel was adapted as a three-part television miniseries of the same name, first aired in January 2008.

==Plot introduction==
In this bridge novel between McMurtry&#x27;s &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Walk&quot; and &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;, Woodrow Call and Gus McCrae are in their middle years, still serving as respected Texas Rangers.

==Plot summary==

Texas Governor Elisha Pease sends a small troop of Texas Rangers, under the leadership of Captain Inish Scull, to the Llano Estacado in pursuit of Kicking Wolf, a celebrated Comanche horse thief. The Comanche steals Scull&#x27;s horse Hector and takes it to the Sierra Perdida as a gift for Mexican bandit Ahumado. Scull promotes McCrae and Call to captains and orders them to lead the Ranger troop back to Austin. He sets off on foot after Kicking Wolf and his horse, accompanied only by Famous Shoes, a Kickapoo tracker.

Ahumado captures Kicking Wolf and his companion, Three Birds. The latter man leaps off a cliff to avoid Ahumado&#x27;s plans for his death. Scull finds Kicking Wolf being dragged by the horse, and cuts the Comanche&#x27;s bonds. Kicking Wolf survives to return to his tribe. Scull is captured by Ahumado, and placed in a cage for a slow death.

Having returned to Austin, McCrae learns that his beloved Clara Forsythe intends to marry his rival, horse trader Bob Allen. Call learns that his lover, Maggie Tilton, is pregnant with his child. Governor Pease sends Call and McCrae out with a typically small Ranger troop to rescue Captain Scull. While they are on this mission, Comanche chief Buffalo Hump takes his warriors on the warpath. They attack Austin. Prepared by Call, Maggie hides under a smokehouse and escapes their notice. The Rangers turn back to Austin as soon as they hear of the raid there.

Scull handles the cage so well that Ahumado has him taken down, and inflicts more pain. Ahumado sends word to Austin that he will return Scull for a ransom of one thousand cattle. Governor Pease sends the Rangers out again, to collect the cattle and exchange the herd for Scull. The Rangers go to Lonesome Dove in search of cattleman Captain King. Realizing they won&#x27;t be able to collect that many cattle nor persuade King to sell them, Call and McCrae try to rescue Scull on their own terms. Bitten by a venomous spider, Ahumado goes South to die. Call and McCrae find Scull going insane in a pit, but they rescue him in time for his nearly total recovery. Scull returns to Austin and later becomes a general with the Union army.

Meanwhile, Buffalo Hump banishes his half-Mexican son Blue Duck. Blue Duck goes East and acquires wealth and notoriety as the leader of a gang of bandits. The novel moves more quickly, covering the period leading up to the sequel, &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;. Maggie gives birth to Call&#x27;s son Newt, but Call refuses to acknowledge the boy. Maggie goes to work at the general store, and Jake Spoon moves in with her. The Civil War takes most of the soldiers away from the frontier, enabling the Comanche to push back the white settlers. After the Civil War, Call and McCrae are sent in pursuit of Blue Duck and his band of renegades. Buffalo Hump has gone off to die. When Blue Duck learns of this he pursues his father. The Rangers attack his band, but Blue Duck has already left. He finds his father at his chosen place of death and kills him there. Maggie dies while the Rangers are on this expedition.

<text>Courtmacsherry (), often referred to by locals as Courtmac, is a seaside village in County Cork, on the southwest coast of Ireland. It is about 30 miles southwest of Cork, and 15–20 minutes drive east from the town of Clonakilty. The village consists of a single long street on the southern shore of Courtmacsherry Bay, with thick woods on rising ground behind. The woods (planted by the Earl of Shannon in the late 18th century) continue beyond the village eastwards to the open sea, ending at Wood Point. Between the village and &quot;The Point&quot;, the trees run right to the water&#x27;s edge and there are several natural bathing coves along the way. The village is located in the Barony of Ibane and Barryroe.

==History==
Around the time of the Norman invasion of Ireland, the major townships in the area were those now known as Timoleague, Lislee, Barryroe and Dunworly. The Normans build a fortified house near the modern site of the Courtmacsherry Hotel. Among the Norman settlers were the De Barrys and the Hodnetts; the former built a castle at Timoleague, and the latter settled in Lislee. The Barrys flourished and gave their name to Barryroe, Rathbarry, etc., whereas the Hodnetts &quot;degenerated into mere Irish&quot;, one branch changing their name to &quot;Mac Seafraidh&quot; (son of Geoffrey), subsequently anglicised to MacSherry or McSharry. Although Barrys and Hodnetts still live in the district, there are no MacSherrys.

One, Patrick McSherry (1725-1795) from the County Armagh side of Newry in the south-east of Ulster, a descendant of a Courtmacsherry Hodnett, emigrated to America in 1745 and founded McSherrystown in Adams County, Pennsylvania.

In 1760, the First Earl of Shannon, Henry Boyle, inherited the Boyle estate in the region of Barryroe, which included the Courtmacsherry area. His grandson Henry Boyle, 3rd Earl of Shannon arranged for the building of Courtmacsherry House in the 1840s, as a family residence. Following the third Earl&#x27;s death in 1842, his six adult daughters (known as &quot;the Ladies Boyle&quot;) were granted the Courtmacsherry estate of 6,000 acres. The last of the third Earl&#x27;s daughters passed away in 1894, at which point Courtmacsherry estate reverted to the Boyle estate. The Boyle estate was then in the possession of Richard Boyle, 6th Earl of Shannon, and the grandnephew of &quot;the Ladies Boyle&quot;. Boyle leased Courtmacsherry House and 10 acres of land to a Bandon businessman, James Brennan, in 1897. Brennan opened Courtmacsherry House as a hotel. In 1923, Robert Henry Boyle, 8th Earl of Shannon (1900–1963) converted this lease into a sale, and since then, Courtmacsherry House has been the location of the Courtmacsherry Hotel.

The Grand Jury Map of County Cork, published in 1811, shows Courtmacsherry as a small cluster of houses near Wood Point. 

==Climate==
Courtmacsherry is the mildest place in Ireland, with a mean annual temperature of 11o. The climate zone is Cfb, temperate maritime.
==Economy and amenities==
The village&#x27;s main industry consists of commercial and charter angling. A moderately sized tourist industry exists during the summer months. There are several beaches nearby, namely Dunworley Strand, Moloney Strand, Broadstrand and Blind Strand. The village has a hotel and a caravan park, catering mainly for visitors from Cork. About half of this new housing is owner-occupied, the remainder being rented to visitors.

There are several bars and pubs in and around the village. Courtmacsherry is an angling center, and known for its many record catches. There is also a festival at the end of July - the beginning of August. It also hosts a horse race meeting on the strand each year.

==Lifeboat==

A lifeboat was placed at Courtmacsherry in December 1825, one of the first three in Ireland, by the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (RNIPLS). However, kept out in the open, the lifeboat gradually fell into disrepair, and it is thought that it was no longer in use by 1840. This didn&#x27;t stop the local Coastguard and fishermen from performing rescues, by means of their own open boats, and gallantry medals were awarded for rescues during this time.

The RNIPLS, founded by Sir William Hillary, Bt., would become the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1854, but it wasn&#x27;t until 1867 that they established a lifeboat station at Courtmacsherry. A boathouse was constructed, and a 32-foot (10-Oared) self-righting lifeboat, named &quot;City of Dublin&quot; after the &quot;City of Dublin Lifeboat Fund&quot;, arrived on 13 February 1867.

In 1901, the station would receive the &quot;Kezia Gwilt&quot; (ON 467), a self-righting lifeboat. To house the boat, a new boathouse and slipway was built at Barry&#x27;s Point, some south of Courtmacsherry. On 7 May 1915, the &quot;Kezia Gwilt&quot; was launched to the aid of ocean liner &quot;RMS Lusitania&quot;, torpedoed off the Old Head of Kinsale by German submarine U-20. She sank in just 17 minutes, with the loss of 1197 passengers and crew. &quot;Kezia Gwilt&quot; was the first &#x27;rowed&#x27; boat to arrive, but after 6 hours hard rowing, she was too late to rescue any survivors. Lifeboatmen involved on that day included Tim Keohane (father of Antarctic explorer Patsy Keohane), John Murphy, and his son Jerry.

In 1928, the station was closed, it is thought due to lack of crew. When the station was reopened in 1929, the new motor-powered lifeboat would be located back at Courtmacsherry, the lifeboat station being renamed Courtmacsherry Harbour.

In January 2009, ultimately unsuccessful efforts were made by Courtmacsherry Lifeboat to save an fin whale, which was stranded at Kilbrittain, opposite Courtmacsherry. The whale&#x27;s remains were preserved and are displayed in Kilbrittain.

Courtmacsherry Harbour lifeboat station currently operates 13-45 &quot;Val Adnams&quot; (ON 1352), a All-weather lifeboat, on station since 2023.

==Transport ==
Courtmacsherry railway station on the Timoleague and Courtmacsherry Extension Light Railway opened on 23 April 1891, closed for passenger traffic on 24 February 1947 and for goods traffic on 10 March 1947, finally closing altogether on 1 April 1961. The line had three locomotives, &quot;Slaney&quot;, &quot;St. Molaga&quot; and &quot;Argadeen&quot;.

<doc id="1019554" wikidata="Q52502" url="?curid=1019554" title="Gothenburg Municipality">
<text>Gothenburg Municipality ( or ) is a municipality in Västra Götaland County in western Sweden. Its seat is located in the city of Gothenburg.

When the first Swedish local government acts were implemented in 1863 the City of Gothenburg, founded and chartered in 1621, became a city municipality with an elected city council (). Its territory has since then been added through amalgamations in 1868, 1906, 1922, 1931, 1945, 1948, 1967 and 1974. The local government reform of 1971 made the city a unitary municipality, like all others in the country. The municipality prefers, however, to style itself (&quot;City of Gothenburg&quot;), whenever legally possible.

In March 2018 it was reported that the municipality and municipality-owned companies had 236 employees working with public relations (Swedish: kommunikation), more than Stockholm, to a cost of 400 000 SEK daily or 151 million SEK annually.

==Localities==
The major part of the Gothenburg urban area () is situated within the municipality, but there are also some other localities as well as rural areas.
*Billdal (part of)
*Donsö
*Hjuvik
*Nolvik
*Olofstorp
*Styrsö
*Torslanda
*Vrångö

===Boroughs===
In 1990 the municipality was subdivided into 21 (district boards), sometimes translated to boroughs, which they really are not. In 2009 the two district boards of Frölunda and Högsbo were joined. It has been decided that from the start of 2011 many more will be joined leaving 10 new district boards.

The boards carry responsibility for primary school, social, leisure, and cultural services within their respective areas. In the election of 1998 three boroughs (Askim, Torslanda and Älvsborg) held local referendums on forming their own municipalities, but their petitions were rejected by the government of Sweden.

Boroughs:
==Politics and government==
The municipality has a municipal assembly (), consisting of 81 members, elected for four years. The municipal assembly meets in the Bourse, a building located on Gustaf Adolfs torg. There are nine political parties represented in the council elected in 2022:
After the 2022 election it was clear that the governing Alliance could not rule any longer with them winning only 27 seats in the chamber. Soon after the election the Centre Party announced they were starting negotiations with the Social Democrats (S), Left Party (V) and the Green Party (MP) about forming a majority coalition that could rule the city for the next four years. These negotiations broke down but S, V and MP could still take the power despite being a minority with only 40 out of 81 seats since C continues to refuse cooperation with the Sweden Democrats (SD).

There were ten political parties represented in the council elected in 2018: 
Following the 2018 municipal elections, neither traditional coalition of parties (the Alliance and the Red-Greens) was able to obtain a majority in the municipal assembly. The newly formed Democrats party, whose primary campaign promise is to stop the construction of the West Link, obtained 14 seats in the assembly, making it the second-largest party. The Green Party and the Left Party announced on 6 November that they would draft their own municipal budget together, along with Feminist Initiative - thus abandoning their traditional cooperation with the Social Democrats. This has been recognized as the three parties forming a local political alliance which has been referred to as the &quot;Red-green-pink coalition&quot;. As a result of this the Alliance were able to take the power in Gothenburg for the first time in nearly 30 years.

The municipal executive committee (&quot;kommunstyrelsen&quot;) has 13 members, representing the six parties from the two major political coalitions who have seats in the assembly.

The chairwoman of the municipal assembly is Åse-Lill Törnquist (MP) and the chairman of the municipal executive committee (sometimes titled mayor) is Jonas Attenius from the Social Democrats.

=== List of mayors ===

*Sören Mannheimer, (Social Democrats) 1985-1988

<text>Älvsbyn (; translating to &quot;the river village&quot;) is a locality and the seat of Älvsbyn Municipality in Norrbotten County, Sweden with 4,967 inhabitants in 2010. It is known as &quot;The Pearl of Norrbotten&quot;.

Älvsbyn has a railway station that is served by trains running between Boden and Stockholm along the Swedish east coast. It has a youth hostel with a small recreational park, including a swimming pool.

==Climate==
Älvsbyn is as its name suggest located right on the Pite River. Being in a relatively deep valley by Swedish standards, the location is prone to temperature inversion. As a result, diurnal temperature variation is usually high and winter nights can be extremely cold and average near the coldest among Swedish municipal seats. Under the Köppen system, Älvsbyn has a subarctic climate with four pronounced seasons. The inland location warms summer up compared to coastal areas nearby, whereas winters are highly variable depending on wind patterns.

<text>Malmö Municipality (), or City of Malmö (&quot;Malmö stad&quot;), is a Swedish municipality in Skåne County, the southernmost of the counties of Sweden (and conterminous with the historical province (&quot;landskap&quot;) of Scania). The central city is Malmö. The municipality is part of Metropolitan Malmö and constitutes its own constituency in parliamentary elections in Sweden.

When the first Swedish local government acts were implemented in 1863, the Old City of Malmö was made one of the country&#x27;s 88 city municipalities and the first city council was elected. The municipal territory has been augmented through mergers in 1911, 1915, 1931, 1935, 1952, 1967 and finally in 1971.

The landscape of the municipality is one of Sweden&#x27;s most urbanized. For a long time, the municipality was one of Sweden&#x27;s most important industrial municipalities, but this era is over. Major sectors are instead trade and business services, but above all the public sector.

After the formation of the municipality in 1971, the population was declining, but the trend reversed in the early 2000s and has continued to rise since then. The municipality is a stronghold of the Social Democrats, who have been in power since 1994. For the 2018-2022 term, they govern in coalition with the Liberals.

==Administrative history==

The municipal area corresponds to the parishes of Bunkeflo, Fosie, Glostorp, Husie, Hyllie, Lockarp, Oxie, Södra Sallerurp, Tygelsjö, Västra Klagstorp and Västra Skrävlinge. In these parishes, rural municipalities with corresponding names were formed during the 1862 municipal reform. The area also included the city of Malmö, which formed a city municipality in 1863.

Limhamn&#x27;s municipal community was established on June 7, 1901 and was dissolved in 1906 when Limhamn&#x27;s borough was formed from Hyllie county municipality and part of Fosie county municipality. The borough became part of the City of Malmö in 1915. Sofielund municipal community was established on February 21, 1896 in Västra Skrävlinge county municipality which in 1911 became part of the City of Malmö. Fosie municipal community was established on May 30, 1919 and was dissolved in 1931 when Fosie county municipality became part of the City of Malmö. In 1935 Husie county municipality was incorporated into the City of Malmö.

== Geography ==

The municipality is located in the southwestern part of the province of Skåne with the Öresund in the west. Malmö municipality borders Burlöv municipality and Staffanstorp municipality to the north, Svedala municipality to the east and Vellinge municipality to the south. The municipality has a sea border in the north with Kävlinge municipality and Lomma municipality. On the other side of Öresund, Malmö Municipality borders Dragør Municipality, Tårnby Municipality and Copenhagen Municipality in the Capital Region of Denmark on the island of Zealand, to which it is connected by the Öresund Bridge.

===Topography and hydrography===

The municipal area is one of Sweden&#x27;s most urbanized landscapes. There is not much left of the original wet meadows south of the town. These have been shaped by being used as grazing land for centuries. The coast has changed significantly since the beginning of the 20th century with the filling of the limestone quarry in Klagshamn. Today it is a peninsula with rich flora and fauna. The beach between the white overburden of the waste mountain Lernacken and the landfill Spillepengen in the north is entirely urban, with the exception of smaller areas used for recreation, swimming and boating, and hiking areas. At Oxie there is a more undulating landscape where sorted sediments form hills which are partly covered with cultivated clay and fertile moraine.

===Nature conservation===

In 2022 there were three nature reserves in Malmö municipality - Bunkeflo strandängar, Foteviksområdet and Limhamns kalkbrott (Limhamn limestone quarry).

The municipality&#x27;s first nature reserve, Bunkeflo Strandängar, was established in 2006 and is a reserve managed by the municipality. This includes 300 different plants including some unique and rare species such as &quot;Iris spuria&quot; (blue flag), &quot;Odontites litoralis&quot; and &quot;Artemisia maritima&quot; (sea wormwood). The next reserve, Limhamns kalkbrott, was established in 2010 and is also managed by Malmö municipality. Access to the area, which is home to 2000 different species, requires a guide.

The Fotevik area was created in 2011 and is also classified as a Natura 2000 site. The area is the most important Swedish site for the very rare subspecies of Dunlin, &quot;Calidris alpina schinzii&quot;. In addition, the rare amphibians European green toad and Natterjack toad are found. The rare moth Morris&#x27;s wainscot (&quot;Chortodes morrisii&quot;) can be found in areas with reeds.

===Administrative subdivision===
From 2016, the municipality is divided into 19 districts:

===Localities===
As of 2015, there were six urban areas ( or locality) and six smaller settlements () in the municipality.

The localities are listed in the table according to the size of the population in 2018. Note that a small part of Malmö (Arlöv) is situated in Burlöv Municipality.

==Governance and politics==

The municipality of Malmö has traditionally been governed by the Social Democrats since the introduction of universal suffrage in 1919, with the exception of two terms in 1985-1988 (the 1985 municipal elections broke a 66-year Social Democratic hold on power) and 1991-1994 when bourgeois coalitions ruled.

The municipal legislative body of the municipality is the 61-member municipal assembly (&quot;kommunfullmäktige&quot;), elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The assembly appoints the municipality&#x27;s main governing bodies, the 11-member executive committee (&quot;kommunstyrelsen&quot;) and the 8 governing commissioners. The executive committee and the commissioners are headed by a municipal commissioner (&quot;kommunstyrelsens ordförande&quot;) or &quot;mayor&quot;. The mayor is Katrin Stjernfeldt Jammeh of the Social Democratic Party.

There are seven political parties represented in the council elected in 2022: Social Democratic Party (20 seats), Moderate Party (13), Sweden Democrats (10), Left Party (9), Liberals (3), Green Party (4) and Centre Party (2).

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Malmö is twinned with:
* Port Adelaide Enfield, Australia (1988)
* Stralsund, Germany (1991)
* Szczecin, Poland (1990)
* Tallinn, Estonia (1989)
* Tangshan, China (1987)
* Vaasa, Finland (1940)
* Varna, Bulgaria (1987)
In addition to its twin towns, Malmö also co-operates with the Province of Chieti in Italy and with Newcastle upon Tyne in the United Kingdom.

<text>Dromod or Drumod () is a village in County Leitrim, Ireland. Dromod is a fishing village beside Bofin and Boderg, which are threaded by the River Shannon. Built along the River Shannon, this is a Tidy Towns winner with a modern harbour that is frequently used by cruiser traffic. A water feature in the centre of the village, entitled &#x27;The Weeping Tree&#x27;, and was made by a local craftsman from a piece of bog oak which was found nearby.

==Demographics==
Between 2006 and 2022, the population of Dromod increased from 210 to 753, an increase of 258.6%.

==Dromod railway station==
The village has a station on the Dublin-Sligo railway line connecting Sligo and Dublin Connolly long the mainline. Dromod railway station opened on 3 December 1862 and remains in operation, despite closing for goods services on 3 November 1975. Dromod also had a railway station on the narrow gauge Cavan and Leitrim Railway. It opened on 24 October 1887 and finally closed on 1 April 1959. A short section of narrow gauge line has been reopened at the station as part of preservation efforts.

==History==

In Gaelic Ireland the place was called &quot;Dromode mac Shanley&quot; in recognition of the dominant Mac Shanly sept of Muintir Eolais. The town is mentioned once in the Irish Annals- &quot;&quot;.

An Iron works was established at Dromod . Pig iron brought to Dromod Finery forge was used to produce an malleable iron product, for transportation to Dublin and Limerick. The operation was closed down in the 1790s, due to an exhaustion of forests locally.

Through at least the 19th and 20th century, seven annual fairs were held at Dromod- 1 January, 28 March (or 29th), 15 May, 26 June (or 29th), 14 August, 10 October (or 11th), and 11 December.

Between 2000 and 2007, during the Celtic Tiger period, the village grew and several new housing estates and buildings were built in the area. Dromod was classified, by the Central Statistics Office, as a census town for the first time in the 2006 census. At that time it had a population of 210 people. By the 2022 census, the population had grown to 753 people.

The N4 national road, which previously ran through the village, was routed around Dromod and neighbouring Roosky with the opening of the N4 Dromod Roosky Bypass in December 2007.

<text>Saint Joseph&#x27;s Prairie Church is a former Catholic parish of the Archdiocese of Dubuque. The parish was located in Washington Township, Dubuque County, Iowa - which is about ten miles south of Dubuque.

In 1843, Father T.J. Donaghoe and five Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary (B.V.M.) were invited to move to the Dubuque area by Bishop Mathias Loras. They moved from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to a wooded area in nearby Table Mound Township. A chapel and a convent were built on the land. The Sisters remained in the area until their original convent was destroyed by fire. At that point the Sisters moved north to Dubuque.

After the death of Fr. Donaghoe in 1869, Bishop Hennessy of Dubuque sent Father Monaghan to establish the St. Joseph&#x27;s Prairie parish. Matthew Powers, who was an area farmer, donated land for the church and cemetery. The church was built by 1875 for $4,000. A bell was added to the church, it had the distinction of being the largest bell in the Archdiocese of Dubuque. The bell weighed 5,247 pounds. For many years the bell stood in a tower at the north side of the church building. Eventually the bell was placed on a concrete platform on the church grounds. In 1894 the rectory was built for $1,500.

One of the more famous pastors of St. Joseph&#x27;s was Raymond Ettledorf, who as an archbishop served as Apostolic Delegate to New Zealand, as a pro-Nuncio to Ethiopia, and as an Official of State at the Vatican.

In 1952, nearby Holy Family parish had been put under the supervision of the Archdiocese after having been the responsibility of the New Melleray Abbey for many years. St. Joseph&#x27;s Prairie and Holy Family were affiliated, and shared pastors from then until the closing of the parish.

In 1989, it was decided to place the church on oratory status. The rectory was sold at this point. Most of the families were transferred over to Holy Family parish. The parish still owned the church building and grounds. For the next five years regular Sunday Masses were not celebrated at the church, but the church building could still be used on special occasions - such as weddings and funerals. In 1994, it was finally decided to permanently close the church. One last Mass was held at the old church building.

A decree was issued relegating the church to Profane Use - or that it was no longer a church building. The building was sold to the family that had purchased the rectory. The building has since been converted into a storage shed. The bell has since been moved from its location just north of the church, south to the church cemetery.

<text>Drumshanbo (, ridge of the old huts) is a small town situated in the heart of County Leitrim, Ireland. Drumshanbo is surrounded by a scenic area of soft rolling hills, woodlands, lakes and the Sliabh an Iarainn and Arigna mountains. It is a well preserved town with traditional pubs, shops, and restaurants.

==Geography==
Drumshanbo is situated at the lower tip of Lough Allen the third biggest lake on the Shannon. It is overlooked by Sliabh an Iarainn, the iron mountain, which is approximately 585 metres high, with a history of iron being mined there for over three hundred years.

==Economy==
Local industries include: metalwork fabrication, sign-makers, plant hire and refuse disposal, tele-sales, joinery works, and many small craft businesses. Laird House was developed recently and it includes offices and a crèche facility. Currently the site of the old factory premises is being redeveloped by the Community Council to house a large food production facility. Anchor tenants are already secured and it is anticipated to generate up to 100 jobs in the industry. Drumshanbo is well supplied with housing, much of it unoccupied, after the collapse of the housing market in 2007.

== Transport ==
The town is centred on the crossroads of the R207 and R208 regional roads.

===Rail transport===
Drumshanbo railway station opened on 2 May 1888, but finally closed on 1 April 1959. It was part of the narrow gauge Cavan and Leitrim Railway. Today the nearest rail services may be accessed at Carrick-on-Shannon railway station around 14 km (8.5 miles) away.

===Bus/coach transport===
Westlink Coaches operate a daily commuter service between Drumshanbo and Sligo via Carrick-on-Shannon.
Drumshanbo is also served by Bus Éireann route 462 on Fridays and Saturdays linking it to Sligo and by Saturday-only route 469 linking it to Carrick-on-Shannon and Longford.

==Tourism and facilities==
In the centre of the town there is the Sliabh an Iarainn Visitor Centre, where an audio-visual display takes visitors through local scenery and highlights the history of coal and iron mining in the area. A wide variety of walks, including hill-walking, can be explored within a 5-km (3 mile) radius of Drumshanbo. Many walking routes around the lake have been signed posted by the Council. Also, for the more adventurous, Slí Liatroma is a 48-km (30 miles) walk between Drumshanbo, Dowra, and Manorhamilton.

A kilometre outside the town is the heated outdoor swimming pool at Acres Lake Amenity. Also there are tennis courts, a playground, and a jetty for cruisers which have travelled from Carrick on Shannon via Leitrim Village. The Teach Ceoil or Music House is also situated here. It is used as a venue for music sessions etc.

In 2003 the opened on the shore of Lough Allen, and offering hotel accommodation, lodges, and apartments. Nearby, the hosts bingo every Monday night, provides Irish handball and badminton facilities, and hosts occasional events such as Discos, Concerts, plays and the mobile cinema. is another community premises which is used for various local groups to meet, and some classes are organised there by a local women&#x27;s group.

==Sport==
Lough Allen is the largest lake in the vicinity and has a reputation for coarse angling with a plentiful supply of trout, pike, perch, rudd and roach. It is possible to rent cruisers to navigate the waterways and enjoy the surrounding countryside. Lough Allen also is used for wind surfing, canoeing and other water sports.

Moorlands Equestrian Centre has been established over ten years ago and provides a range of activities including pony trekking, mountain trails, lakeside rides or cross-country treks.

There are four golf courses in the area, namely Carrick on Shannon (18 holes), Blacklion (9 holes), Slieve Russell (18 holes), and Ballinamore (9 holes).

Allen Gaels are the local GAA club, and have been county champions in both Gaelic football and hurling.

==Events==
Drumshanbo has a growing population of over 1,000. In the third week of July, the town hosts the Joe Mooney Summer School for Irish Music. This festival is now in its sixteenth year and attracts Irish music enthusiasts from all over the world. As the name suggests it is a memorial and tribute to the late Joseph Mooney, County Councillor and townsman who did so much to promote the cause of Leitrim and his beloved town.

An Tóstal festival in June also has an emphasis on Irish music and culture. This was established nationwide in the 1950s by An Bord Fáilte as a tourist promotion to encourage emigrants home. Drumshanbo is the only location in Ireland where it has survived into the 21st century.

The Sliabh An Iarainn Walking Festival takes place 11 and 12 April 2015. There are two days of graded A,B,C walks for walkers of all abilities.

==Religion==
Drumshanbo has three churches and a convent.

The Roman Catholic Church built in 1845 is dedicated to St Patrick and commemorates his first crossing of the Shannon nearby. The old church stood on a site in the famine graveyard in 1744 further out of town.

St John&#x27;s Church of Ireland dates back to 1829. It is a gothic style structure ornamented with a tower and pinnacles.

The present Methodist Church on the Carrick Road was built in 1860; however, there had been an earlier chapel dating back to 1760s.

The Poor Clare Convent was built in 1860. The Sisters are Franciscian Poor Clares and as such observe strict enclosure, recite the Divine Office in choir and maintain Perpetual Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. The nuns pray around the clock and as it is an enclosed order they never leave the convent except in the event of a medical emergency. In the last refurbishment of the convent chapel, it was possible to integrate the community of nuns with the Public to a greater degree than previously.

==Education==
Drumshanbo has both a large primary school and a vocational secondary school, which provide education for local children until the age of eighteen. Drumshanbo Vocational was opened in 1964, with major extensions in 1985 and 2012 and a further extension due to start in 2015. In 2014 a 50th anniversary magazine was launched with over 50 contributions from pupils and teachers from all decades, photos from same and a comprehensive list of all past pupils.

==History==

Drumshanbo town originated from the extensive iron industry around Slieve Anierin from the 17th century. Pig iron produced at iron smelting works on the east of Slieve Anierin was brought south across Lough Allen to Drumshanbo finery forge where a malleable iron product was produced and transported to Dublin and Limerick by boat. The first ship built by the East India company in Limerick was supposedly finished with the product from Drumshanbo Iron works. According to folklore the &quot;. Long ago Ireland had been covered in Woodland, a claim echoed in a 19th-century survey of Leitrim- &quot;. These great forests in Leitrim and on the west side of Lough Allen were denuded for the making for Charcoal for Iron works around Slieve Anierin. Immense piles of cleared timber existed at Drumshanbo in 1782.

Throughout at least the 19th and 20th centuries, fairs were held at Drumshanbo on- 12 February (or 15th), 12 May (or 17th), 11 (or 16) July, 6 October, and 16 November. In 1925, Drumshanbo village comprised 77 houses, 17 being licensed to sell alcohol.

Some 500 victims of the Great Famine are buried at a famine-period burial ground at Drumshanbo.

Historical figures include

* Father Canice Mooney (1911-1963), a respected Franciscan nuascoláirí (new scholar), was born in Drumshanbo. An academic he wrote books on the Irish Franciscans.

==International relations==
===Twin towns – Sister cities===
Drumshanbo is twinned with Locquirec in Brittany, France, and Emerson, Georgia, United States.

<doc id="1019567" wikidata="Q2531890" url="?curid=1019567" title="Republic of Singapore Navy">
<text>The Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) is the maritime service branch of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) responsible for defending the country against any seaborne threats and as a guarantor of its sea lines of communications. The RSN traces its origins to the Royal Navy when Singapore was still a crown colony of the British Empire. The service was formally established in 1967, two years after its independence from Malaysia in 1965, and had undergone a substantial modernisation ever since – which has led them into becoming the most powerful navy in Southeast Asia.

The RSN also regularly conducts operations with the navies of its neighbouring countries to combat piracy and terrorist threats in the congested littoral waters of the Strait of Malacca and Singapore. It also jointly operates the Fokker 50 maritime patrol aircraft with its counterparts from the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) to provide air surveillance of the seaward approaches to Singapore, which is one of the busiest sealanes in the world. The RSN has engaged in international anti-piracy operations further abroad, partaking in the multinational Combined Task Force 151 off the Gulf of Aden.

Though numerically small in comparison to its much larger neighbours in terms of tonnage and manpower reserves, the RSN counteracts by continuously seeking to maintain a qualitative superiority over any adversary through the implementation of new technologies, fostering of alliances with extra-regional navies, and increased reliance on automation and unmanned assets. This has made the RSN one of the most sophisticated and well trained navies in the region. In addition, bilateral exercises with foreign navies are also held regularly. 

All commissioned ships of the RSN have the ship prefix &quot;RSS&quot; standing for &quot;Republic of Singapore Ship&quot;.

==Mission==

As an island nation, the RSN forms part of Singapore&#x27;s first line of defence. Its stated mission objectives are to:
*Protect Singapore&#x27;s sealine of communications and contribute to regional peace and security. 
*Maintain continuous surveillance on the Singapore Strait to prevent sea robberies, piracy, terrorism and unwanted incursions during peacetime.
*Work to secure a swift and decisive victory over any enemy at sea during war.
*Conduct diplomacy by exercising with foreign navies and taking part in international operations for peace support, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.

==History==

===Colonial and pre-independence era===

The Republic of Singapore Navy traces its origins to the Royal Navy in the 1930s with only two patrol craft. The Straits Settlements Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (SSRNVR) was established on 27 April 1934, and in 1941 became the Singaporean division of the Malayan Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (MRNVR) during World War II. The service received several 75&#x27; motor launches built locally by John I. Thornycroft &amp; Company Shipyard in Tanjong Rhu: HMS &quot;Pahlawan&quot; and the first HMS &quot;Panglima&quot; in 1937; the latter would later be sunk during the fall of Singapore in February 1942. A new 90&#x27; motor vessel bearing the name &quot;Panglima&quot; was launched in 1944, but upon its transfer to the MRNVR in 1948, proved unsuited for tropical waters and began deteriorating rapidly.

In 1948, the Malayan Force was raised by the Singaporean government, and was later granted the title of the Royal Malayan Navy in 1952 in recognition of its services in action during the Malayan Emergency. The third and final &quot;Panglima&quot; was launched in January 1956 to replace the second vessel. Being more technologically advanced than her predecessors, she became an indispensable part of the local fleet.

On 16 September 1963, Singapore was admitted as a state of Malaysia under the terms of confederation and the Royal Malayan Navy was renamed the Royal Malaysian Navy. The Singapore division of the MRNVR was formally transferred from the command of the Royal Navy to the Royal Malaysian Navy on 22 September 1963, becoming the Singapore Volunteer Force. During the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, Singapore-based ships were charged with defending the southern border against infiltrators and saboteurs, and also undertook local minor engagements against the Indonesian Navy.

===Independence of Singapore===

On 9 August 1965, Singapore seceded from Malaysia to form an independent republic inside the Commonwealth. The SVF became the &quot;de facto&quot; naval force of the new state, though it remained under the command of the Royal Malaysian Navy. Three ships remained in Singapore after separation: KD &quot;Singapura&quot;, a captured Japanese minelayer; KD &quot;Bedok&quot;, a patrol boat from Malaysia; and KD &quot;Panglima&quot;, the former Royal Navy inshore patrol boat built in 1956. &quot;Panglima&quot; was recommissioned as a Singaporean ship on 1 January 1966. On 1 February, the service ceased to be under Malaysia and became the Singapore Naval Volunteer Force (SNVF); &quot;Bedok&quot; and &quot;Singapura&quot; were also recommissioned and the latter became a floating headquarters.


A new naval ensign was hoisted at the Telok Ayer Basin for the first time on 5 May 1967 and is marked as the day of the Navy&#x27;s official establishment. In September, the service was renamed the People&#x27;s Defence Force – Sea and placed under the Sea Defence Command, with the command being thereafter renamed the Maritime Command in December. The name changes reflected the internal restructuring within the Singapore Armed Forces and the growing realisation that maritime security was a crucial element to national security. Headquarters was shifted ashore to Pulau Belakang Mati in 1968. In order to develop local expertise in seamanship and naval engineering, 160 naval recruits underwent training by Royal New Zealand Navy instructors in 1969. At the same time, aspiring officers were sent overseas to learn from established navies in Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand.

The Maritime Command launched an expansion program with the objectives of combating sea robberies and smuggling, and improving seaward power projection. In June 1968, six &quot;Independence&quot;-class patrol crafts were purchased and commissioned between 1970 and 1972, marking the first purpose-built ships the Navy possessed. Part of the urgency stemmed from British prime minister Harold Wilson&#x27;s intention to withdraw British troops East of Suez by 1971, which would leave a security vacuum, though a smaller British presence eventually remained under the Five Power Defence Arrangements. Growing constraints and strategic need for a base located nearer to the strait was solved by the opening of Brani Naval Base in December 1974. The foresight was validated a few weeks later when terrorists from the Japanese Red Army attacked an oil complex on Pulau Bukom and hijacked the Laju ferry. Four vessels, RSS &quot;Sea Hawk&quot;, RSS &quot;Independence&quot;, RSS &quot;Sovereignty&quot; and RSS &quot;Daring&quot; together with the Marine Police, were able to surround the fleeing ferry and prevent it from escaping.

Colonel James Aeria would be the final commander of the Maritime Command. On 1 April 1975, the Maritime Command was renamed the Republic of Singapore Navy as part of the reorganisation of the Singapore Armed Forces into three distinct services, and has kept the name ever since.

===Fleet modernisation===

The RSN was the first navy in the region to successfully fire a live anti-ship missile when RSS &quot;Sea Wolf&quot; fired two Gabriel missiles in March 1974. From 1975 to 1976, six &quot;Sea Wolf&quot;-class missile gunboats were commissioned, which proved vital during Operation Thunderstorm when they were deployed to patrol and apprehend the influx of boat people fleeing the fall of South Vietnam. In order to support sealift operations, six County-class tank landing ships were purchased from the United States; these were popularly referred to as dollars ships due to the price ($1) paid for each vessel. Two &quot;Bluebird&quot;-class minesweepers were also transferred from the United States to combat the threat of mine warfare within the narrow and shallow channels of the Singapore Strait. Prior to this, the SAF Diving Center had already been established in 1971 to train the first batch of frogman recruits in conducting underwater mine disposal operations. In 1975, the service was reformed as the Naval Diving Unit and based at Sembawang Camp, where it remains.

During the latter half of the decade, the increased operational demands and rate of patrols led the Navy to seek three additional missile gunboats and an upgrade to the Harpoon missile for the existing fleet under Project Albatross. Due to budgetary constraints in the early 1980s, Defence Minister Howe Yoon Chong decided to allocate more funds to the Air Force for the acquisition of a squadron of F-16s; the fighter jets were deemed to possess a higher strategic strike value and capable of more diverse roles compared to ships. Howe claimed the Navy&#x27;s function was best relegated to coastal defence and suggested mounting Oerlikon guns on towed barges as a replacement to guard the nation&#x27;s maritime borders. Nevertheless, the reduced budget was still sufficient to commission twelve coastal patrol craft which freed the missile gunboats from daily patrols for more strategic operations.

With the Navy being the lowest priority among the three services, it saw little hope of an expanded fleet with a larger stake in Singapore&#x27;s defence and many people left the service. This created a &quot;crisis of confidence&quot; within the RSN in the next few years, which defence planners regarded as lacking a proper doctrine for existence beyond patrols and tackling illegal immigration. It was not until 1984 that naval officials convinced the government of the necessity of a seagoing fleet to secure the nation&#x27;s sea lines of communication in the Malacca Strait and South China Sea, both of which lead to the Port of Singapore; a major contributor to the economy. To combat the growing technological obsolescence and decline in morale, the government launched the &quot;Navy 2000&quot; program. The service underwent an internal restructuring with the formation of the Coastal Command (COSCOM) in 1988 and the Fleet in 1989, formalising the responsibilities of each class of ship. Between 1990 and 2001, the resurgent navy acquired six &quot;Victory&quot;-class missile corvettes, twelve &quot;Fearless&quot;-class patrol vessels, four &quot;Endurance&quot;-class landing ship tanks and also commissioned four secondhand &quot;Challenger&quot;-class submarines from Sweden to hone its underwater domain skills.

In 1979, Malaysia published a map laying claim to Pedra Branca, an offshore island controlled by Singapore. The resultant Pedra Branca dispute lasted 29 years until 2008 when the island was awarded to Singapore by the International Court of Justice, during which the Navy was heavily involved in patrols and maintained an active presence in the waters surrounding the island. In January 2003, RSS &quot;Courageous&quot; collided with a merchant vessel within the vicinity of Pedra Branca during a patrol, resulting in four casualties and the first ship to be stricken as a total loss. As a result of the accident, additional safety measures were implemented and the training program enhanced, including the requirement for all officers to better understand the manoeuvring characteristics of their ship and take a COLREGs test every six months.

The RSN had also participated in operations other than war within Southeast Asia and abroad. The Navy deployed its &quot;Bedok&quot;-class mine-countermeasure vessels to search the Musi River for SilkAir Flight 185; served as part of the Australian-led International Force East Timor to address the humanitarian and security crisis in the aftermath of the territory&#x27;s referendum for independence in 1999; deployed three ships to provide humanitarian assistance and emergency aid to the Indonesian town of Meulaboh in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake; and was part of the Multi-National Force – Iraq coalition force maintaining maritime security around key Iraqi installations in the Persian Gulf.

===Evolving security challenges===

The Coastal Command was revamped in 2009 into the Maritime Security Task Force to improve coordination between national maritime agencies such as the Police Coast Guard and harbour authorities. Between 2007 and 2020, the RSN has introduced new &quot;Archer&quot;-class submarines, &quot;Formidable&quot;-class frigates and &quot;Independence&quot;-class littoral mission vessels to its fleet to enhance its deterrence amidst rising tensions in the surrounding seas. Unmanned assets such as the Specialised Marine Craft patrol boat and Protector USV have been commissioned to combat the personnel shortfall in Singapore due to falling birthrates.

The RSN has engaged in multilateral anti-piracy operations in the Malacca Strait with neighbouring nations; and in the Gulf of Aden and Horn of Africa under the multinational naval Combined Task Force 151, taking command of the task force thrice; It participated in both the search for MH Flight 370 in the Gulf of Thailand and QZ Flight 8501 in the Karimata Strait in 2014. In an analysis of the SAF humanitarian response to Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen noted that the disruption of communications on the ground underscored the need for a platform which could provide &quot;centralised ability for command and control&quot; in the air.

The RSN celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2017 and hosted an international fleet review, with twenty nations participating.

In October 2018, Malaysia extended its Johor Bahru port limits past its 1979 maritime claims into waters off the reclaimed Tuas sector which Singapore claims as its own. Singapore responded by extending its port limits to overlap with Malaysia&#x27;s new port limits. As Malaysia deployed elements of the Malaysia Coast Guard and government ships to enforce their claims, the RSN&#x27;s littoral mission vessels were stationed on location 24/7 with the Police Coast Guard. Both side eventually suspended the overlapping port limits and withdrew from the area following successful negotiations.

The Navy underwent a comprehensive restructuring in June 2020 which dissolved all the existing squadrons, reorganising each class of ship into its separate flotilla. The Maritime Security Task Force was restructured, with the newly created Sea Security Group and Force Protection Group placed under it.

===Future procurement plans===

The RSN launched its first newly built &quot;Invincible&quot;-class submarine in 2019, with the second and third submarines RSS Impeccable and RSS Illustrious launched on 13 December 2022. All three submarines will be expected to be commissioned in 2023, with an operationalisation date set for 2024. The fourth submarine RSS Inimitable remains in construction, together with a fifth, previously undisclosed, submarine. 

Contract for the procurement for six multi-role combat vessels (MRCV) was signed between ST Engineering Marine Ltd and SAAB on 28 March 2023 while procurements plans for the drone-laden Joint Multi-Mission Ships (JMSS) are ongoing. The MRCVs will act as a &#x27;mothership&#x27; for unmanned assets and host mine-countermeasure Venus-16 USVs, while the JMSS will increase the RSN&#x27;s aviation capabilities in supporting disaster relief operations. A new class of patrol vessels to operate alongside the existing littoral mission vessels are to enter service in 2026.

==Organisation==



===Command structure===

The Republic of Singapore Navy is led by the Chief of Navy (CNV), who reports directly to the Chief of Defence Force (CDF). The CNV is responsible for the RSN&#x27;s overall operational capabilities and administration. The organisational chart shows the peacetime administrative chain of command with five formations: the Fleet, Maritime Security Command, Naval Engineering and Logistics Command, Naval Diving Unit, and the Maritime Training and Doctrine Command.

The current Chief of Navy is Rear Admiral Sean Wat, who took over command on 10 March 2023.

===Operating forces===

The Fleet is responsible for operations beyond the Singapore Strait and represents the main strike arm of the navy. Its frigates and missile corvettes are capable of conducting anti-surface, anti-air and anti-submarine operations with their equipped armaments and sensors. Its landing ships tank and civil resource vessels provide sea transportation and logistics support overseas, while the submarines force provides a subsurface capability for the navy.

The Maritime Security Task Force (MSTF) is a SAF-level standing task force formed after the restructuring of Coastal Command. Its role is to ensure Singapore&#x27;s maritime security and act as a co-ordinating agency for all national maritime agencies to allow for the seamless execution of maritime security operations.

The Naval Diving Unit is charged with &quot;explosive ordnance disposal, underwater mine demolition and commando-type missions&quot;. Its personnel are considered among the elite forces of Singapore.

===Engineering and Logistics===

The Naval Engineering and Logistics Command (NELCOM) is responsible for up-keeping and planning the maintenance schedules of ships and the equipping of supplies and assets. It also conducts weapons readiness checks on ships and works closely with the Defence Science and Technology Agency and ST Electronics.

===Training===

As with the army and air force, all officers of the navy are trained and commissioned at the Officer Cadet School with their interservice counterparts. As midshipmen, part of their training involves being deployed four weeks at sea with the regular fleet to hone their skills in leadership, navigation and basic seamanship. Navy officers are also offered specialisation courses later in their careers at the Naval Officers&#x27; Advanced Schools (NAS) which is part of the SAF Advanced School (SAS). The courses offered are Naval Advanced Officer Course (NAOC), Mine Hunting Officer Course (MHOC), Naval Warfare Officer Course (NWOC) and Command Preparatory Programme (CPP).

Enlisted specialists and regular military experts (ratings) are instructed in their specialised domains at the Naval Military Experts Institute, under the Maritime Training and Doctrine Command (MTDC), based at Changi Naval Base. This training consists of all the key aspects of the duties the sailors are expected to perform on board the ships. This includes basic firefighting and damage control skills, rope handling and seamanship skills as well as shiphandling which is done through a ship simulator allowing trainees to practice their watchkeeping skills inside a safe, controlled environment. The enlisted specialists and military experts undergo a rigorous and realistic Summative Exercise (SUMEX) at the end of their course prior to joining the operational ships.

The RSN has also partnered with ST Education and Training to operate the training ship STET &quot;Polaris&quot; since 2010. &quot;Polaris&quot; was specially constructed with a &quot;dual bridge&quot; to facilitate training requirements for two navigation teams to operate simultaneously and can carry 30 trainees and instructors; the ship was named after the North Star, which mariners had traditionally used as a navigational reference point in ancient times.

While submarine training was initially conducted in Sweden by the Royal Swedish Navy, training for submariners are now conducted locally in Singapore. Submariners are trained at the Submarine Training Centre (STC) also known as RSS &quot;Challenger&quot;, named after the first submarine acquired by the RSN. It is located in Changi Naval Base and is designed to be a state-of-the-art facility featuring submarine simulators in order to enhance the realism and effectiveness of submarine training. Training in the simulators can be up to several days in order to simulate actual deployments when the submariners are training in the STC. Prospective submariners are put through a nine-month-long course which consists of a series of tough tests in order to ensure that every qualified submariner is able to meet operational requirements at sea. The simulators housed in the facility are known as the Submarine Steering and Diving Trainer (SSDT) and Submarine Combat Tactical Trainer (SCTT). The two simulators allow the flotilla to conduct training that closely simulates at-sea conditions without the logistical costs involved in deploying submarines out at sea. The SSDT is designed based on the Archer-class submarine and trains the helmsman to steer the submarine as well as the diving officer in diving the submarine while allowing the “Officer of the Watch” to oversee the entire process. The SCTT is designed to train the submariners in combat operations, which consists of four consoles modelled after those installed on board the actual submarines. These are used to train the crew in submarine combat operations such as analysis, surveillance, command and control, and weapons control. Singapore is also known to have sent prospective submarine Commanding Officers for the Royal Netherlands Navy Submarine Command Course as well as the German Navy Submarine Commanding Officer Course. A training suite for crew members of the new Invincible class submarines is now being developed, which is planned to operationalise by 2024. Like the previous simulators before it, it will consist of the combat trainer as well as diving and steering trainer among others. It will additionally feature a virtual procedural trainer that replicates the submarine with all its more than 12 million parts, that offers both physical and tactile training opportunities for the crew members while ashore.

Enlistees to the Naval Diving Unit are selected based on their eyesight and medical fitness and trained at Frogman School located within Sembawang Camp. Trainees are required to pass a vocational assessment prior to beginning nine weeks of basic military training. Those who qualify then undergo the twenty weeks Combat Diver Course where they are taught dive theory and must qualify for drown proofing, pool competency and survival skills requirements.

==Current fleet==

===Frigates===

The multi-role stealth frigates entered service with the RSN in 2007 and are derivatives of the French Navy&#x27;s . The frigates are key information nodes and fighting units, and were, at time of launch, &quot;by far the most advanced surface combatants in Southeast Asia&quot; with a special surface-to-air missile configuration which combines the Thales Herakles radar with the Sylver A50 launcher and a mix of MBDA Aster 15 and 30 missiles. Other armaments include Boeing Harpoon missiles and an OTO Melara 76 mm gun for surface defence. The Blue Spear SSM is planned to be equipped onboard the Formidable class Frigates on completion of the mid-life upgrade program. 

Equipped with Sikorsky S-70B naval helicopters, an international derivative of the Sikorsky SH-60B Seahawk. These naval helicopters feature anti-surface and anti-submarine combat systems, extending the ship&#x27;s own surveillance and over-the-horizon targeting and anti-submarine warfare capabilities. The naval helicopters are part of the 123 squadron of the RSAF and piloted by air force pilots. Two more S-70B helicopters were ordered in February 2013.

The lead ship of the class, RSS &quot;Formidable&quot; was built overseas in Lorient, France and commissioned locally on 5 May 2007, marking the 40th anniversary of the RSN. The final two ships, RSS &quot;Stalwart&quot; and RSS &quot;Supreme&quot; were commissioned on 16 January 2009. The six frigates form the First Flotilla of the RSN.

===Littoral mission vessels===

The &quot;Independence&quot;-class littoral mission vessel is a class of eight surface platforms succeeding the &quot;Fearless&quot; class. In January 2013, the Ministry of Defence awarded ST Engineering a contract to build and design eight vessels. A subsidiary of the company, ST Marine was charged with building the ships at Benoi Yard and integrating the combat systems supplied by the group&#x27;s electronics arm, ST Electronics. The class was designed with the &quot;lean manning&quot; concept to facilitate a smaller crew complement to reflect the declining birthrate in Singapore, with increased levels of automation and remote monitoring systems. This has resulted in its combat information center, machinery control room, and bridge being co-located in a single location known as the integrated command center. Its modularity also allows the ship to deploy unmanned and mine-countermeasure systems or be reconfigured to support disaster-relief operations. The ships have been sent on overseas deployments. The last three ships of the class were commissioned in January 2020.

The littoral mission vessels were formerly under 182 Squadron until June 2020 with the inauguration of the Maritime Security Command. The eight &quot;Independence&quot;-class littoral mission vessels now form the Second Flotilla of the RSN.

===Tank landing ships===

The tank landing ships are the largest class of ships in the RSN. They were designed and built locally by ST Marine to replace the old County-class tank landing ships (LST). Each ship is fitted with a well dock that can accommodate four landing craft and a flight deck that can accommodate two medium lift helicopters. While the RSN describes the &quot;Endurance&quot; class as LSTs, they lack the beaching capability traditionally associated with LSTs, and their well docks and flight decks qualify the &quot;Endurance&quot; class more as amphibious transport docks.

The ships provide sea transportation for personnel and equipment for SAFs overseas training, as well as a training platform for RSN&#x27;s midshipmen. RSS &quot;Endurance&quot; became the first RSN ship to circumnavigate the globe when it participated in the 2000 International Naval Review in New York City. The ships are also actively involved in humanitarian and disaster relief operations, notably in East Timor, the Persian Gulf, the tsunami-hit Indonesian province of Aceh and most recently, disappearance of Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501. The four ships form the Third Flotilla of the RSN.

===Mine countermeasures vessels===

The RSN acquired mine countermeasure capabilities as early as 1975, when the USN&#x27;s and were reactivated by the RSN&#x27;s engineers and technicians in California. The &quot;Bluebird&quot;-class coastal minesweepers were commissioned as RSS &quot;Jupiter&quot; and RSS &quot;Mercury&quot;.

These two ships were eventually replaced by the mine countermeasures vessels. The first ship, RSS &quot;Bedok&quot;, was built by Karlskronavarvet in Sweden based on the design. The remaining three ships were prefabricated in Sweden and transferred to Singapore for final assembly by ST Marine. The ships are constructed of glass reinforced plastic to maintain low magnetic and acoustic signatures, and are fitted with Voith Schneider Propellers, giving it the highest manoeuvrability in the navy.

The RSN also operates the Protector unmanned surface vehicles. They were deployed together with the &quot;Endurance&quot;-class landing ships tank to the North Persian Gulf for peacekeeping operations in 2005, where they performed surveillance and reconnaissance, as well as force protection duties for more than eight hours at a go.

Unmanned assets and the mine countermeasures ships form the Sixth Flotilla of the RSN.

===Submarines===

====&quot;Archer&quot; class====

The submarines were also former Swedish Navy combatants and known as the . In November 2005, an agreement was signed with Kockums for the same tropicalisation modifications for two submarines. Amidst the refitting process, an air independent propulsion system was installed, which necessitated the cutting apart of the submarine&#x27;s hull to fit new components. RSS &quot;Archer&quot; was relaunched on 16 June 2009 and recommissioned on 2 December 2011, with her sister boat RSS &quot;Swordsman&quot; being commissioned on 30 April 2013. The AIP modification enables the submarines to have longer submerged endurance and lower noise signature, enhancing its stealth capability. The advanced sonar system is capable of detecting contacts at a further distance, while the torpedo system has a better target acquisition capability, which allows the submarines to engage contacts at a further range.

An upgrade program was conducted between 2016 and early 2019, which involved the installation of CM010 optronic periscopes and new combat management, sonar and countermeasure systems.

====&quot;Invincible&quot; class====

The , also known as Type 218SG, is a submarine class ordered from Germany&#x27;s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems. Two &quot;Invincible&quot;-class submarines were procured in November 2013 and another two in May 2017. Several German industry experts commented then that the project would cost about one billion Euros and take six years to complete, with the first submarine expected to be delivered in 2020.

The diesel electric submarines will have 50 per cent longer endurance, more firepower, more capable sensors and advanced automation than the existing fleet of RSN submarines. Armed with eight torpedo tubes and manned by a crew of 28, they can travel at a surface speed of more than 10 knots and a submerged speed of more than 15 knots. These submarines are particularly customised for Singapore&#x27;s shallow and busy waters.

The first of four, RSS &quot;Invincible&quot;, was launched on 18 February 2019. She will undergo sea trials in Germany before delivery in 2022. The second and third boat, RSS &quot;Impeccable&quot; and RSS &quot;Illustrious&quot; were launched on 13 December 2022, expected to be delivered in 2023. The remaining one is scheduled to follow by 2024. The &quot;Invincible&quot; and &quot;Archer&quot;-class submarines are projected to replace the &quot;Challenger&quot;-class afterwards.

All submarines, regardless of class, form the Seventh Flotilla of the RSN. The RSN also operates the submarine support and rescue vessel .

===Corvettes===

In 1983, the RSN ordered six corvettes from Friedrich Lürssen Werft of Germany, with the first being built in Germany and remaining five locally by ST Marine. The corvettes represented a strategic change in Singapore&#x27;s defence posture as the Navy sought to redefine its purpose to be &quot;more than a coastguard&quot; and project power in the region for deterrence purposes; they were the first ships in the RSN to have an anti-submarine capability, and remain the fastest ships in the fleet with a speed in excess of 30 knots. A244-S torpedoes were reportedly acquired to counter the threat of an increased number of submarines passing through the Malacca Strait, with Soviet submarines having been tracked passing through entirely submerged. The first three ships were commissioned in August 1990 and the remaining three in May 1991.

The corvettes have been continuously upgraded to incorporate new technologies and better sea keeping capabilities. Two sets of 8-cell Barak I were installed in 1996 as part of a general refit. A life extension program between 2009 and 2013 redesigned the mast to incorporate new sensors, overhauled the combat management system, and added the ability for the ship to launch a single ScanEagle UAV for remote surveillance without the need to approach a target. The anti-submarine torpedoes and variable depth sonar detectors were removed during the refit. The six corvettes form the Eighth Flotilla of the RSN.

The &quot;Victory&quot;-class corvettes are projected to be replaced by six multi-role combat vessels by 2030, with the first ship to be delivered in 2025.

=== Maritime security and response vessels===

The &quot;Sentinel&quot;-class maritime security and response vessels (MSRV) are four refurbished &quot;Fearless&quot;-class patrol vessels. The refurbishment plan was announced in March 2020 in response to the increase of sea robberies within the region, and foreign intrusions of Singapore territorial waters. As part of the refit, non-lethal LRAD and laser warning systems were added to increase operational flexibility, while fenders were incorporated into the hull to enable quicker alongside operations of suspicious vessels. The forward part of the bridge was also reinforced with ballistic-resistant armour.

The first two vessels MSRV &quot;Sentinel&quot; and MSRV &quot;Guardian&quot; entered operational service on 26 January 2021, with the latter two MSRV &quot;Protector&quot; and MSRV &quot;Bastion&quot; on 20 January 2022. Other than the MSRVs, the flotilla will also operate two Maritime Security Tugboats (MSRTs), and will operate new purpose-built vessels from 2026. The ships form the Maritime Security and Response Flotilla of the RSN.

==Historical fleet==

===Missile gunboats===

The &quot;Sea Wolf&quot;-class missile gunboats were acquired in 1968 and based on the TNC 45 design from Fredrich Lürssen Werft. The first two gunboats—RSS &quot;Sea Wolf&quot; and RSS &quot;Sea Lion&quot;—were constructed in West Germany in 1972, while the remaining four were constructed locally by Singapore Shipbuilding and Engineering, with all six ships being commissioned by 1976. The gunboats were initially equipped with Israeli-manufactured anti-ship Gabriel missiles and Bofors guns. &quot;Sea Wolf&quot; fired the first missile by the RSN in March 1972.

As new technology became available, a number of upgrading programmes were initiated to increase their strike capability and sophistication. Between 1986 and 1988, they were upgraded to launch Boeing Harpoon (SSM) surface-to-surface missiles, and in 1994, the Bofors gun was replaced with Mistral surface-to-air (SAM) missiles. The continuous upgrades to the gunboats&#x27; armaments and sensors made them regarded as being at the forefront of naval warfare technology between the 1980s and 1990s.

The gunboats engaged in numerous exercises with foreign navies and visited many port of calls throughout their lifespan. On 13 May 2008, all six gunboats were retired at a sunset decommissioning ceremony held at Changi Naval Base following 33 years of service.

===Patrol vessels===

Between the 1970s and 1990s, the RSN operated and coastal patrol crafts. They were gradually replaced by the patrol vessels built locally by ST Marine to replace the ageing coastal patrol craft, with all ships in commission by August 1989. The first six vessels of the &quot;Fearless&quot; class were armed for anti-submarine warfare missions and placed under the Fleet as 189 Squadron, with the remaining six being allocated to 182 Squadron under Coastal Command. was badly damaged in a collision with a container ship in the Singapore Strait in January 2003 and removed from service.

189 Squadron was subsequently transferred to Coastal Command in January 2005, placing all eleven ships under the same formation; the anti-submarine suite was also gradually removed as the RSN refocused its ASW capability on other platforms. The eleven patrol vessels formed the combined 182/189 Squadron until May 2016 when the first &quot;Independence&quot;-class littoral mission vessel completed its sea trials; 189 Squadron was subsequently subsumed into 182 Squadron.

On 11 December 2020, the final two patrol vessels RSS &quot;Gallant&quot; and RSS &quot;Freedom&quot; were decommissioned. Four vessels of the class were converted into &quot;Sentinel&quot;-class maritime security and response vessels.

====&quot;Challenger&quot; class====

In 1995, the RSN acquired a from the Swedish Navy and rechristened it the . Another three were transferred in 1997, making them Singapore&#x27;s first underwater platforms. As the submarines were designed for operations in the Baltic Sea, various modifications were required to suit them to tropical waters. A comprehensive tropicalisation refitting programme was implemented for all four submarines, which involved the installation of air conditioning, marine growth protection systems and corrosion-resistant piping.

It was believed that the &quot;Challenger&quot; class were purchased to develop the required submarine operations expertise before selecting a modern class of submarines to replace them, since all the boats were then over 40 years old. RSS &quot;Challenger&quot; and RSS &quot;Centurion&quot; were retired from service in 2015. The remaining two &quot;Challenger&quot; class, RSS &quot;Conqueror&quot; and RSS &quot;Chieftain&quot; were decommissioned on 25 November 2024.

==Bases==

===Tuas Naval Base===

Tuas Naval Base (TNB) is located at the western tip of Singapore and occupies 0.28 km2 (0.11 mi2) of land. It was officially opened on 2 September 1994 by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. For about two decades, Brani Naval Base was the RSN&#x27;s only base. An expansion of the fleet in the early 1980s meant that more space was needed for the fleet and its shore infrastructure. However, this was not possible as the land around Brani was reserved for use by the port authority to develop container facilities. As a result, Tuas was selected as the site for a new naval base.

Better utilisation of space at TNB resulted in two and a half times more berthing space than Brani, even though TNB only has a shoreline of 850 m (0.5 mi). Provision was also made for recreational facilities. Automation was incorporated into the design of TNB to reduce manpower requirements, such as mechanical ramps for the loading and unloading of vehicles and an automatic storage and retrieval system. It also has a floating dock which can lift 600 tonnes and transfer a ship from sea to land to facilitate repairs and maintenance.

The base has since been enclosed to the west by land reclamation in Tuas South. The missile corvettes, patrol vessels, littoral mission vessels and mine counter-measures vessels are based at TNB.

===RSS Singapura Changi Naval Base===

Changi Naval Base (CNB) is the latest naval facility of the RSN and was built to replace Brani Naval Base. Located on 1.28 km2 (0.50 mi2) of reclaimed land at the eastern tip of Singapore, it was officially opened on 21 May 2004 by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. Its 6.2 km (3.9 mi) berthing space can accommodate an aircraft carrier and is often used by visiting ships of the USN.

Automation was incorporated into the design of CNB to reduce manpower requirements. It has an automated underground ammunition depot that allows ammunition to be loaded onto the ships and an automated warehouse system to store items. The base has a fibre optic broadband network for information management. The base was also designed to be environment-friendly, with small-scale wind turbines powering the lights along the breakwaters at night. Conventional roof construction materials were substituted by thin film solar panels and the solar energy generated lights the base. In addition, seawater is used in the air-conditioning system.

The submarines, frigates and landing ships tank are based at CNB. Co-located in CNB is the Naval Military Experts Institute, also known as RSS &quot;Panglima&quot;— named in honour of the first ship of the navy.

<text>Ennistymon or Ennistimon () is a country market town in County Clare, near the west coast of Ireland. The River Inagh, with its small rapids known as the Cascades, runs through the town, behind the main street. A bridge across the river leads to nearby Lahinch. The town is at the junction of the N67 and N85 roads.

==Name==
The town&#x27;s official name is Ennistimon, although Ennistymon is the spelling most widely used. Historically, it was spelt &quot;Inishdymon&quot;. This is believed to derive from &quot;Inis Diomáin&quot; meaning &quot;Diomán&#x27;s island&quot;. However, Míchéal Ó Raghallaigh argues that the name is derived from &quot;Inis Tí Méan&quot; meaning &quot;island of the middle house&quot; or &quot;river meadow of the middle house&quot;.

==Geography==
Ennistymon is located on the border of the upland area of County Clare known as the Burren. The Cullenagh River is called Inagh after the Ennistymon cascades, at which point it becomes tidal.

==History==
Ennistymon grew from just three cabins in 1775 to 120 houses in 1810 (70 of which were slated). The oldest part of town is the narrow street near the bridge. A Christian Brothers Monastery, Mount St. Joseph&#x27;s, was established in 1824.

==Economy==
Shops in Ennistymon include a SuperValu supermarket, an Aldi supermarket, two bookshops, several art galleries, a bakery, several hairdressers, a butcher, a hardware shop, a print shop, dry cleaners, launderette, builders&#x27; suppliers, several cafés and restaurants. In addition to The Falls Hotel, and a number of B&amp;Bs, there are also several pubs which host Irish traditional musicians.

==Transport==
===Bus===
Two Bus Éireann routes, 333 and 350, serve the town. Route 350 links Ennistymon to Ennis, Lahinch, Cliffs of Moher, Doolin (where it is possible to connect with a ferry to the Aran Islands), Lisdoonvarna and Galway. There are a number of journeys each way daily. Onward rail and bus connections are available at Ennis and Galway. Route 333 links the town to Kilfenora, Corofin, Miltown Malbay and Doonbeg. There are also Local Link routes 331/C23 and C5 serving some local places.

===Rail===
The West Clare Railway formerly passed through the town, connecting it to Ennis and the West Clare coastal towns and villages. Ennistymon railway station opened on 2 July 1887. The railway closed on 1 February 1961. The closest station today is Ennis.

===Roads===
The principal thoroughfare through Ennistymon is New Road (part of the N85) and Main Street (part of the N67). The N67 runs from Galway city to Tarbert, County Kerry, and the N85 runs to Ennis.

==Features==
===Notable places===

&quot;Teach Ceoil Saint Andrews&quot; is a Gothic revival Church of Ireland from the 1830s which was converted to a hall and cultural centre in 1989.

The Falls Hotel, formerly Ennistymon House, is a Georgian house built on the site of an earlier castle. It takes its name from the nearby waterfalls (falls or cascades).

The ruins of Glen Castle are located near the road to Ennis. Also in ruins is the nearby Protestant church and graveyard, built by the Archdeacon of Kilfenora James Kenny (appointed in 1775). This nave-and-chancel church was built in 1778 and fell into disuse after the new Church of Ireland was constructed in the 1830s. It features a single Gothic door, three windows on the north and one on the east side.

===Memorial===

The Memorial &quot;An Gorta Mór&quot; (&quot;The Great Hunger&quot;) was erected a mile outside Ennistymon on the road to Lahinch to commemorate the memory of the victims of the Great Famine from 1845 to 1850. It was dedicated on 20 August 1995 – the 150th anniversary of the Famine. Located across from Palladian Ennistymon Hospital, itself built on the grounds of the local workhouse (Union of Kilmanaheen), it was erected by a combined effort of the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH), Board of Erin, Board of America and Clare County Council.

The monument was designed by an artist from County Kerry and depicts an account found in the Minutes of the Meetings of the Boards of Guardians for Ennistymon Union held in the County Archives. The account centred on a note that was pinned to the torn shirt of a barefoot orphan boy who was left at the workhouse door on the freezing cold morning of 25 February 1848. The note read:

&quot;Gentlemen,
&quot;There is a little boy named Michael Rice of Lahinch aged about 4 years. He is an orphan, his father having died last year and his mother has expired on last Wednesday night, who is now about to be buried without a coffin!! Unless ye make some provision for such. The child in question is now at the Workhouse Gate expecting to be admitted, if not it will starve. -- Rob S. Constable&quot;&quot;
One side of the memorial depicts a child standing before the workhouse door, while across from that is the head of an anguished mother and two hands clenched in frustration or anger above the sorrowful text of the pleading note.

==Education==

Ennistymon has two primary schools: &quot;Scoil Mhainchin/Ennistymon National School&quot; and what began as &quot;Mol an Oige Steiner School&quot;. Mol an Oige National School became the first Steiner method school in Ireland to be given permanent recognition as a national school, granted in 2015 by the Department of Education. Patronage of Mol an Óige Steiner National School was transferred on 1 September 2019 to the Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board and it became Mol an Óige Community National School (CNS) in 2019.

Scoil Mhainchin was formed as an amalgamation of the CBS Primary School and The Convent of Mercy National School.

There are also three secondary schools in the town: Ennistymon CBS, which is the only all-boys school in the county, the Vocational School and Scoil Mhuire. Plans are in place to amalgamate these three schools.

<doc id="1019574" wikidata="Q4139528" url="?curid=1019574" title="Glandore">
<text>Glandore (, meaning &quot;harbour of the oak trees&quot;) is the name of a village and harbour in County Cork, Ireland. It is off the N71 road, about 10 km east of Skibbereen.

The village has several pubs, with traditional music performances. It is a popular holiday destination. Notable homeowners and residents include Margaret Jay, former leader of the House of Lords, and at one time the businessman Tony O&#x27;Reilly. The former Church of Ireland rectory (originally called East View), along with Bearna Donn (originally called West View) and Stone Hall were built in the 19th century by the Allen family. The village yacht club&#x27;s headquarters is located near the pier on the Old School Road.

The Irish Coast Guard has a unit based in Glandore at the &quot;Rocket House&quot; at the western end of the village.

An annual regatta takes place on the third weekend of August. Sailing is one of the main attractions, with rowing and swimming also popular. The Lar Casey Cup is awarded to the winning Dragon class yacht. In former years there were Irish dancing competitions in the village square.

Every two years (on odd years) the Glandore Classic Boat Regatta is held during the second week of July.

==Geography==
The village is located on the east side of Glandore Harbour. The harbour is approximately three miles long north to south with the village of Leap at the north end, Union Hall on the west side and two small islands, named Adam and Eve, at the mouth of the harbour at the south end. The sailing directions in the harbour are &quot;to avoid Adam and hug Eve&quot;.
Rocks in the middle of the harbour called &#x27;The Perches&#x27; have a flashing green mark to the western extremity indicating a safe channel. The Danger Rock further up the harbour is indicated with a flashing northern cardinal mark.
The harbour itself is located midway in Glandore bay which is the area between The Galley Head and Toe Head.

Townlands in the Glandore area include Rushanes, Aughatubber, Drombeg (in which Drombeg stone circle is located), Kilfinnan, Kilfaughnabeg, Brulea, Maulmarine, Kilcosan, Reenogreena, Cregg, Tralong, Carriglusky and Knockardan.

==History==

Due to its location, Glandore was one of the earlier settlements in the area. In 1215, the Normans built two castles here. The present pier and wall were built in the first half of the 19th century. A fair was held at &quot;Trá an Aonaigh&quot; (Beach of the Fair) also known as Tralong (Beach of the ship) in the 18th century.

Glandore was then for centuries closely associated with the O&#x27;Donovan family, who gained control of the harbour from the Normans and occupied its castles.

==Wildlife==

The harbour supports a wide array of species. Seabirds include grey herons, oystercatchers, gannets, shags, cormorants, herring gulls and black tipped gulls. A number of seals live in the harbour. Whale, dolphin, porpoise and shark are frequently found in the greater bay area between the Galley Head and Toe Head. There are many seals in the area also. Mackerel can be plentiful in the harbour depending on the time of year.

==Sailing==
The local yacht club organizes 16+ courses every year for junior sailors and adults, as well as powerboat and instructors&#x27; courses. Every odd year, Glandore hosts its &quot;Classic Boat Regatta&quot; which takes place over the space of a week. Boats from all over the country participate in the event.
The Dragon and Squib keelboat classes and many dinghy classes, including Topaz, are raced by club members. The club has turned out many talented sailors. For many years, Glandore has been home to veteran transatlantic yachtsman and sailing author Don Street who continues to participate in local Dragon racing.

==Places of interest==
Drombeg stone circle is located (1.5 miles) east of Glandore. There is no entry fee for this site.

==Churches==
There is a Roman Catholic church one mile away on the Rosscarbery side of the village in the townland of Kilfaughnabeg (meaning &quot;Little church of Faughna&quot;). This church was built circa 1929. The building of a church at another location was abandoned before commencement of the construction of the existing church. The abandoned structure was in Killacoosane. Its erection had been undertaken by Fr. John Power, but the project was abandoned after his death.

The Church of Ireland Christ Church is on the Leap side of the village. It was consecrated in 1861. It contains a bell cast by the Murphy foundry in 1889.

==Notable residents==
* Seán Hayes (1884–1928) was a Sinn Féin TD 1918–1923
* Michael MacWhite (1883–1958), the first Irish permanent delegate to the League of Nations
*Tony O&#x27;Reilly, Chryss Goulandris and family, at one time lived at Shorecliffe, a complex of buildings centred on an old guesthouse at which O&#x27;Reilly used to stay with his family.

<text>Glounthaune () is a village in County Cork, Ireland, some east of Cork city, on the north shore of Cork Harbour, the estuary of the River Lee.

==History==
The village, originally named &quot;New Glanmire&quot;, was built as a planned town on a tidal quay wall between 1810 and 1819. A new school was built in the 1820s. The current Catholic church, built , replaced an earlier chapel which had been built in 1803.

In 1842, Glounthaune landowner William O&#x27;Connor built a castellated neo-Gothic stone tower to commemorate the teetotalist and abolitionist Father Theobald Mathew on what was then called Mount Patrick and is now known as Tower Hill in Glounthaune. The tower is still standing and has since been converted into a private residence while retaining many of its original features including a life-sized statue of Father Mathew. The refurbished and modernised tower was sold in 2014.

==Transport==
Glounthaune railway station opened in 1859. It is served by the commuter railway line between Cork and Cobh. The next station in the Cork direction is Little Island, while towards Cobh the next stop is at Fota Island. With the reopening, in 2009, of the railway line to Midleton, Glounthaune railway station became the junction between the Cobh and Midleton lines.

==Sport==
The parish of Glounthaune is the main base for Gaelic Athletic Association club Erin&#x27;s Own GAA. Erin&#x27;s Own won the Cork Senior Hurling Championship on three occasions: in 1992, 2006 (defeating Cloyne) and 2007 (defeating Newtownshandrum). Association football (soccer) is also played in Glounthaune, with Glounthaune United A.F.C. fielding teams in the Cork Schoolboys League.

<doc id="1019577" wikidata="Q310350" url="?curid=1019577" title="Al Hoceima">
<text>Al Hoceima () is a city in the north of Morocco, on the northern edge of the Rif Mountains and on the Mediterranean coast. It is the capital city of the Al Hoceima Province. The city is a known tourist destination despite its small size. It has a population of about 50,225 (2024 census).

Al Hoceima is distinguished by its pristine sandy beaches such as Cala Iris, Bades, Quemado, and Tala Youssef, as well as its mountainous rocky terrain.

==Name==
Al Hoceima is an Arabised version of a Spanish word (Alhucemas – meaning &#x27;Lavenders&#x27;), derived from the Andalusi Arabic term &#x27;Al Khazama&#x27;. After independence, the Moroccan government established an Arabised name for Alhucemas coming up with Al Hoceima, following the standard French spelling.

==History==
===Early and colonial history===
The Ait Ouriaghel Berber tribe (also &#x27;Beni Urriaguel&#x27;) dominated the area around Al Hoceima. Abd el-Krim, whose father was a qadi of the Aith Yusuf clan, organized a guerilla force against the Spanish during the Rif War, establishing the Republic of the Rif in 1921. In September 1925, Spanish General José Sanjurjo landed at Al Hoceima and claimed the territory for Spain.
The Spanish developed the town and named it Villa Sanjurjo after General Sanjurjo. The first mayor was Florian Gómez Aroca.

===Since Moroccan independence===

After Morocco gained its independence in 1955, Al Hoceima developed quickly, and the Moroccan government changed its name from the Spanish &quot;Villa Alhucemas&quot; to &quot;Al Hoceima&quot;.

The years from 1956 to 1959 were marked by challenges for the Rif region. Morocco&#x27;s Hassan II, then crown prince, assumed the role of military commander, and during this period, a significant number of people lost their lives in the Rif. In October 1958, the Beni Urriaguel community rebelled against the central administration, prompting the deployment of two-thirds of Morocco&#x27;s army, led by Hassan, to Al Hoceima.

In the early 1950s and 1960s, during a period of economic hardship when many of the city&#x27;s inhabitants were of modest means, the small houses in the city were predominantly painted white and blue. These colors, symbolizing the sea and sky, were commonly regarded as the city&#x27;s official colors. As economic conditions improved over time, residents began to paint their houses in a wider range of colors.

The city and surrounding villages were hit by two large earthquakes within ten years. The first ( 6.0 event occurred on May 26, 1994, and the second event ( 6.4) occurred on February 24, 2004, killing more than 560 people (see 2004 Al Hoceima earthquake). In 2007, Al Hoceima&#x27;s mayor stated that all new houses would be painted white and blue in an effort to restore the city&#x27;s traditional appearance.

Al Hoceima is now a moderate-size city with a population of 56,716 recorded in the 2014 Moroccan census. It has the second-largest port of the Rif region (Nador being the largest). The first schools built by the Spanish colonials, (a college and an elementary school) and a Spanish catholic church, still exist today.

Playa Quemado, where General Sanjurjo and his troops landed in 1925, is one of Al Hoceima&#x27;s well-known beaches. Situated beneath the Mohammed V hotel, the beach is frequented by visitors. The hotel offers amenities such as a tennis court, restaurant, cocktail bar, and nightclub.

Al Hoceima has been the centre of repression by and political protest against the Moroccan government in the 21st century. Five young protesters were murdered, and their burned bodies found in Al Hoceima, in 2011. On October 28, 2016, a fish-seller, Mouhcine Fikri, was crushed to death in a rubbish truck while trying to retrieve fish confiscated by the authorities, which led to large anti-government protests in November 2016 known as Hirak Rif. Protests in Al Hoceima continued after the start of Ramadan, 26 May, and culminated on 26 June with &quot;bloody clashes&quot;, then spreading to other parts of northern Morocco and the country. On 7 January 2023, A 5.3 Magnitude Earthquake hit Al Hoceima Province, Nekkour. On 12 February 2023, National Institute of Geophysics announced two earthquakes that occurred in the Al Hoceima region, in the north of the country, measuring 3.8 and 4.3 degrees.

==Climate==
==Economy==
The city&#x27;s income is based on fishing and tourism. Many of its former inhabitants migrated to Europe during the 1960s through 1980s; large numbers of Moroccans in the Netherlands, France and Belgium were Al Hoceima natives, many of whom return to Al Hoceima during the summer, when the town is also frequented by tourists from Germany and France.

The town beach is Plage Quemado, which is also where fishers bring in their catch. A quieter beach is in nearby Asfiha. The Torres de Alcala and Kalah Iris beaches are also considered Al Hoceima beaches, though they are 60 km from town.

== Transport ==
The city is served by the Cherif Al Idrissi Airport.

== Education ==
There is a Spanish international school, Instituto Español Melchor de Jovellanos.

Abdelmalek Essaâdi University - Campus of Al Hoceima contains:

Faculty of Science and Technology - FST

National School of Applied Sciences - ENSA&#x27;H

Multidisciplinary Faculty - FPH (Under Construction)

National School of Commerce and Management - ENCG (Under Construction)

<doc id="1019578" wikidata="Q5328210" url="?curid=1019578" title="East Deccan dry evergreen forests">
<text>The East Deccan dry evergreen forests is an ecoregion of southeastern India. The ecoregion includes the coastal region behind the Coromandel Coast on the Bay of Bengal, between the Eastern Ghats and the sea. It covers eastern Tamil Nadu, part of Puducherry and south eastern Andhra Pradesh.

==Setting==
The East Deccan dry evergreen forests lie in the rain shadow of the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats, which block the rain-bearing summer southwest monsoon.

The ecoregion covers an area of , extending from Ramanathapuram District of Tamil Nadu to Nellore District of Andhra Pradesh. Most of the terrain is flat and under 100 m elevation, except for small hillocks and low hills. Parts of the ecoregion occur between the Godavari-Krishna mangroves ecoregion along the coast to the east and the Deccan thorn scrub forests to the west.

Much of the ecoregion is densely settled, and has been substantially altered by human activity, including agriculture, grazing, and forestry, over the centuries. The ecoregion is home to the metropolis of Chennai (Madras), and a number of other cities, including Pondicherry, Thanjavur, Kanchipuram and Nellore. It is estimated that 95% of the original forest cover has been cleared, and the species composition of the remaining forests have been altered by intensive human use including the removal of all the taller trees.

Unlike most of the world&#x27;s tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests, whose trees tend to lose their leaves during the dry season to conserve moisture, the East Deccan dry evergreen forests retain their leaves year round. Only two other ecoregions exhibit a similar pattern, the Sri Lanka dry-zone dry evergreen forests and the Southeastern Indochina dry evergreen forests.

The ecoregion is home to two important wetlands, Kaliveli Lake in Viluppuram District of Tamil Nadu, and Pulicat Lake north of Chennai. Kaliveli Lake is one of the largest wetlands in peninsular India, and is deemed a wetland of national and international importance by the IUCN. It is a seasonal wetland, with a gradient from freshwater to brackish water, and is an important feeding and breeding ground on migratory bird flyway. It is currently threatened by encroachment by agricultural fields, wildlife poaching, loss of the surrounding forests, and increases in commercial prawn farming.

==Climate==
Annual rainfall in this ecoregion ranges between 1000 mm and 1800 mm, while the mean annual temperature is around 27.5°C (ranging from an absolute minimum of about 17°C in January to a maximum of around 40°C in May-June). Rain mostly falls during the highly variable northeast monsoon between October and December.

==Flora==
The original vegetation of the ecoregion consisted of forests with an understory of evergreen trees and an emergent canopy of taller deciduous trees, including &quot;Albizia amara&quot;, and &quot;Chloroxylon swietenia&quot;. Intensive human use of the forests over the centuries has mostly eliminated the deciduous canopy species, and the ecoregion&#x27;s remaining forests are now characterized by areas of leathery-leaved evergreen forest, with a relatively low (10-meter) closed canopy. Predominant species are &quot;Manilkara hexandra&quot;, &quot;Mimusops elengi&quot;, Ceylon ebony (&quot;Diospyros ebenum&quot;), strychnine tree (&quot;Strychnos nux-vomica&quot;), &quot;Eugenia&quot; spp., &quot;Drypetes sepiaria&quot;, and &quot;Flacourtia indica&quot;.

Across 75 sites of tropical dry evergreen forests, one study enumerated 149 woody plant species, including 102 trees, 47 lianas, and 3 herbs, with the number of woody plant species per site ranging from 10 to 69 species. 

One study in two remnant sacred groves in this ecoregion recorded 169 angiosperm species, of which the dominant tree species were &quot;Albizia amara, A. odoratissima, Borassus flabellifer, Buchanania axillaris, Chloroxylon swietenia, Drypetes sepiaria, Ficus benghalensis, Lannea coromandelica, Lepisanthes tetraphylla, Memecylon umbellatum, Pterospermum suberifolium&quot;, and &quot;Syzygium cumini&quot;. Puthupet forest (12°05’702”N – 79° 87’ 148” E) is predominantly &quot;Memecylon umbellatum&quot;, with &quot;Pterospermum canescens&quot;, &quot;Diospyros ebenum&quot;, &quot;Drypetes sepiaria&quot;, &quot;Aglaia elaeagnoidea&quot;, &quot;Pongamia pinnata&quot;, &quot;Azadirachta indica&quot;, &quot;Walsura trifoliolata&quot;, &quot;Calophyllum inophyllum&quot;, and &quot;Albizia amara&quot;.

The density of trees in the forest stands ranges from 953 to 1357 stems (of girth greater than 20 cm at breast height) per hectare. 6-8 percent of the ecoregion remains in forest, which is found in isolated pockets. Most of the ecoregion&#x27;s forests have been degraded into tropical dry evergreen scrublands, characterized by thorny species such as &quot;Ziziphus glaberrima&quot;, &quot;Dichrostachys cinerea&quot;, &quot;Catunaregam spinosa&quot;, and &quot;Carissa spinarum&quot;. 

The plant community of remnant dry evergreen forest patches in sacred groves includes rare evergreen species such as &quot;Polyalthia suberosa&quot;, &quot;Aglaia elaeagnoidea&quot;, and &quot;Pamburus missionis&quot;, besides medicinal herbs like &quot;Hemidesmus indicus&quot;, &quot;Gloriosa superba&quot;, &quot;Andrographis paniculata&quot;, &quot;Dioscorea oppositifolia&quot;, and &quot;Tinospora cordifolia&quot;.

==Fauna==
Mammals found in this ecoregion include the dhole (&quot;Cuon alpinus&quot;), sloth bear (&quot;Melursus ursinus&quot;) and Indian spotted chevrotain (&quot;Moschiola indica&quot;).

==Protected areas==
Two percent of the ecoregion lies in reserves and protected areas. Another 6% is forested but unprotected. Many forest areas are very small, and include temple groves and reserved forests.

Protected areas include Guindy National Park in Chennai District, and Nanmangalam, and Vandalur reserve forests in Kanchipuram District. In Villupuram District, the Marakkanam reserve forest includes the three forest areas of Marakkanam, Kurumpuram, and Agaram. The sacred grove of Marakkanam preserves a section of evergreen closed canopy forest. Kurumpuram forest (12º4’N-79º44’E) was designated a reserve forest in 1960, but has suffered degradation from timber poaching, firewood harvesting, and hunting wild animals. Several other temple groves in the area around Puducherry, including Puthupet, Pillaichavadi, Mudaliarchavadi, and Kottakarai, preserve small enclaves of forest.

The Point Calimere Wildlife and Bird Sanctuary protects a 17.26 km2 enclave of dry evergreen forest, as well as tidal wetlands and mangroves. Other coastal preserves in the region include Vettangudi Bird Sanctuary (30 km2) in Sivaganga district of Tamil Nadu, Nelapattu Bird Sanctuary (160 km2) on Pulicat Lake in Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh, and Pichavaram reserve in Cuddalore district.

Since the 1973, the Auroville Foundation has undertaken restoration of dry evergreen forest at Pitchandikulam in Auroville, near Pondicherry. The forest covers 28 ha (70 acres), and includes many native plants collected from nearby remnant forests and propagated in their nursery. In 2003 the foundation established a 14 ha (35 acre) forest and resource centre at Nadukuppam, near Marakkanam, with both dry evergreen forest species and various agro-forestry crops.

<text>Gougane Barra () is a scenic valley and heritage site in the Shehy Mountains of County Cork, Ireland. It is near Ballingeary in the Muskerry &quot;Gaeltacht&quot;. Gougane Barra is at the source of the River Lee and includes a lake with an oratory built on a small island. It also includes a forest park.

==History==
The name &quot;Guagán Barra&quot; comes from Saint Finnbarr (or Barra), who is said to have built a monastery on the island in the lake during the sixth century. The present ruins of a hermitage date from around 1700 when a priest called Denis O&#x27;Mahony retreated to the island. During the times of the Penal Laws, Gougane Barra&#x27;s remoteness meant that it became a popular place for the celebration of the Roman Catholic Mass. The nineteenth century oratory which stands near the original hermitage is famous for its picturesque location and richly decorated interior and is a popular place for wedding photography. St Finbar&#x27;s Oratory is the final destination for one of the five Pilgrim Paths of Ireland, St Finbar&#x27;s Pilgrim Path, which starts away in Drimoleague.

Reforestation of Gougane Barra began in 1938 and it is now home to a forest park with 20 tree species, mainly non-native Sitka spruce, Japanese larch and Lodgepole pine, but also Scots pine and other native species of flora and fauna. The source of the River Lee rises in the hills above the park and flows into Gougane lake. The forest park has of motor trail and of hill walks, nature points and vista trails. The Coillte-owned forest at Gougane Barra was temporarily closed in 2014 to allow felling of 16,000 trees, mostly larches, infected with or susceptible to &quot;Phytophthora ramorum&quot;, a pathogen responsible for sudden oak death. These trees were to be replaced with native species such as oak and Scots pine.

Since 2021, the company Wingleaf Ltd plans to erect a wind farm of seven turbines in the area, which would be among the tallest in Ireland. Their application was refused by Cork County Council, who voted unanimously against it. The company appealed to An Bord Pleanála. Their inspector also rejected it, stating that it &quot;would have significant adverse environmental and visual impacts and is not sustainable at this highly sensitive location&quot;. Despite this, An Bord Pleanála granted permission, on the grounds that the wind farm would contribute &quot;to the implementation of Ireland&#x27;s national strategic policy on renewable energy&quot;. Tim Lucey, spokesman of the campaigners against the wind farm, said the decision was undemocratic as the local people and council opposed it.

<text>Hiram B. Warner (October 29, 1802 – June 30, 1881) was an American politician, lawyer, educator and jurist from Georgia. He served on the Supreme Court of Georgia (1846–1853) and represented Georgia in the U.S. Congress (1855–1857). He was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Georgia on two occasions: first, from 1867 to 1868 and second, from 1872 to 1880.

Warner was born in Williamsburg, Massachusetts, in 1802. In 1819, he moved to Georgia and taught school for three years. After studying law, Warner gained admittance to the state bar and began practicing law in Knoxville, Georgia, in 1825

After serving in the Georgia General Assembly from 1828 until 1831, Warner did not seek reelection and moved to Talbotton, Georgia in 1830 and then to Greenville, Georgia at a later date. He was elected as a judge to the Georgia Superior Court and presided from 1833 to 1840. In 1846, he became a judge on the Supreme Court of Georgia and remained on that body until his resignation in 1853.

In 1854, Warner won election to the 34th United States Congress as a Democratic Representative of Georgia&#x27;s 4th congressional district and served one term from March 4, 1855, to March 3, 1857. He did not run for reelection in 1856.

Georgia Governor Charles J. Jenkins appointed Warner as judge of the Coweta Circuit Court in 1865 and he remained in that position until 1867 when he was appointed as Chief Justice of the State supreme court. He was subsequently elected to that position and served in that capacity until he resigned in 1880. He died in Atlanta, Georgia, on June 30, 1881, and was buried in Town Cemetery in Greenville, Georgia.

<doc id="1019585" wikidata="Q287965" url="?curid=1019585" title="Kanturk">
<text>Kanturk () is a town in the north west of County Cork, Ireland. It is situated at the confluence of the Allua (Allow) and Dallow (Dalua) rivers, which stream further on as tributaries to the River Blackwater. It is about from Cork and Limerick, and lies just north of the main N72 road, from Mallow and about from Killarney. Kanturk is within the Cork North-West Dáil constituency.

==History==
Located at a crossing point at the confluence of the River Allow and River Dalua, evidence of ancient settlement near Kanturk includes a number of ringfort, holy well and fulacht fiadh sites in the surrounding townlands of Coolacoosane, Curragh, Greenane and Gurteenard. The town&#x27;s English name, Kanturk, derives from the Irish or , meaning head (or headland) of the boar.

To the south of the town, in Paal East townland, is Kanturk Castle. Known locally as the Old Court, this fortified house was built for MacDonogh McCarthy as a defence against English settlers during the Plantation of Ireland. The building was a limestone rubble Tudor mansion four storeys high, 28 metres in length and 11 metres wide, with four towers of five storeys high and a height of 29 metres. The castle was never fully completed. Work stopped , reputedly because local English settlers were concerned that the structure was too large and fortified, and could be used as a base to attack them. Accordingly, the Privy Council in England ordered that building works be stopped. After changing hands several times in the intervening centuries, Kanturk Castle is now owned by &quot;An Taisce&quot; (the National Trust for Ireland), and is a designated National Monument.

As of 2015, there were 32 buildings or structures listed on the Record of Protected Structures for County Cork. These include a number of the town&#x27;s bridges, which date to the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The larger religious and administrative buildings in Kanturk date to the early to mid-19th century, including the former market house (1810), court house (1825), Church of Ireland church (1858), and Roman Catholic church (1867).

==Economy and amenities==
The local creamery, North Cork Creameries, was founded in 1928 and produces casein powder and other milk products.
Kanturk&#x27;s library offers lending facilities, newspapers, reference books, internet access and also organises cultural events.

Kanturk Town Park is a short distance from the town shopping centre. The &quot;Unity Stone&quot; monument is located near the park&#x27;s entrance. The park has oak, beech, chestnut and ash trees, a children&#x27;s playground, some cultural exhibits, and a walkway by the banks of the Dalua.

The town&#x27;s schools include a number of national (primary) schools and two co-educational secondary schools. The secondary schools, Coláiste Treasa and Scoil Mhuire, have enrollments of over 500 and 270 students respectively.

==Sport==
Kanturk GAA club has a hurling team and a football team, both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s from underage to Intermediate level. The local pitch is located in Kilroe, just outside the town. Kanturk RFC is a rugby union club which is also located just outside the town, at Knocknacolan. Founded in 1927, the club played in the All-Ireland League for five years and now plays in the Munster Junior League. An eighteen-hole golf course is located on Mill Road, where milling used to take place. The local association football soccer pitch has facilities to accommodate a number of teams. Kanturk also has a cycling club with its own outdoor 250m velodrome, one of only three on the island of Ireland.

Kanturk has a trout fishing club which maintains the rivers that flow through the town. From Newmarket, the Dalua river flows into the Allow (Freemount River) in the centre of the town. A further south of the town the river Brogeen flows into the Allow. The Allow joins the River Blackwater; known for its salmon fishing, a further downstream at Leaders Bridge on the N72 Mallow to Killarney road. The Kanturk Trout Anglers Association has been represented on the international stage on several occasions, with past members participating at the World Fly Fishing Championships.

==Transport==

By rail, Kanturk is served by the nearby Banteer railway station, which is from Kanturk. The town&#x27;s one-time railway station opened on 1 April 1889, closed for passenger traffic on 27 January 1947 and finally closed altogether on 4 February 1963.

Bus routes serving Kanturk include weekday services to Mallow, one of which continues to Cork. On Saturdays, there is a single bus service to Cork via Mallow. Kanturk is not served by bus on Sundays.

<text>Kilflynn () is a village and a civil parish in north County Kerry, Ireland. It is 11 km north-east of Tralee just off the N69 road from Tralee to Listowel.

== Etymology ==

The origin of the place name Cill Flainn is unknown. Two suggestions are commonly circulated. ‘Cill’ in Irish can mean &#x27;cell&#x27; or &#x27;churchyard&#x27; so in context might mean &#x27;church of Flainn.&#x27; A popularised tale is that it was named after a Roman Catholic hermit monk, Flainn, said to have lived by the River Shannow (which runs through Kilflynn). Crippled and blind, he was visited by the Virgin Mary, who offered to restore his ailing sight. Flainn declined, asking for the miraculous power to be transferred to others via a local well (now Tobar Flainn, well or spring of Flainn). Some refer to this person as ‘St Flainn,’ but no such person was canonised. There is possible confusion with St Flannan, originally from Killaloe in County Clare.
The alternative suggestion is that the name derives from the &#x27;O’Flannan tribe&#x27;: in August 1931, in the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, a paper referencing a 15th-century manuscript (itself said to be a copy of a 12th-century document) listing rents in Clanmaurice presents both &#x27;O Flannayn&#x27; and &#x27;Kyllflanyn&#x27; as &#x27;Kilflyn&#x27; in the English translation from the original Latin, a significant error which may be the root of the suggestion. The cantred (cf. Welsh cantref or English hundred) or rural deanery of Othorna &amp; Oflannan (Irish Uí Thorna &amp; Uí Flannáin) was an Anglo-Norman sub-division, in this case generally along the historical boundaries of much older kingdoms and regions which were part of West Munster (Irish Iarmuman or Iar Mbumba), in the realm of the Ciarraighe, and which later became County Kerry some time between 1222 and 1229.

Different anglicised spellings appeared over the years. In William Petty&#x27;s Down Survey of Ireland (1655-1656) the parish appears as &#x27;Kilfloinie Parish&#x27;. Charles Smith wrote it as &#x27;Kilflin&#x27; in 1756, as did William Wilson 30 years later. In Taylor and Skinner&#x27;s road maps of 1777 it is spelt &#x27;Kilftyn&#x27;, likely a transcription error. Samuel Lewis wrote it &#x27;Kilflyn&#x27; in 1840 and this spelling is extant in places like official Ordnance Survey Ireland maps or on new road signs (particularly the one on Shanow Bridge near Abbeydorney). Locally, and in most documentation, it is spelt Kilflynn.

== Geography ==

The village lies in the southern part of the Listowel or Kerry plain. The rocks underlying the village area are typically Namurian sandstone and shale which formed between 326 and 313 million years ago during the Carboniferous period and cover 27% of County Kerry. The centre of Kilflynn is actually on the edge of this area.
Immediately to the north and west the bedrock is limestone (later to be sourced from nearby Lixnaw and Abbeydorney for use in lime kilns). These rocks, as part of the Western Irish Namurian Basin (or Clare Basin) were formed in a sub-equatorial tropical environment, due to the deposition of fine particles in a delta, likely from a river flow to the south-west on a continental mass formed from what are now North America, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and Africa. This area is thus part of the Iapetus Suture, that is a region where the ancient Iapetus Ocean closed up. The Atlantic Ocean had yet to form.

The area was subject to glaciation during the ice ages. The glacial meltwater evidence coincides with an area to the south and east of Kilflynn and the N26 road, broadly in line with the edge of the hills facing the north-west. The ice sheet that covered Ireland split about 19,000 years ago, along a corridor that included the area where Kilflynn lies and going down past Banna Strand (the sea level was lower then) towards the Atlantic. The main ice sheet retreated northwards, separated from the Kerry-Cork ice cap to the south which disappeared approximately 1000 years later.

Kilflynn centre is currently 59m above sea-level, but the village elevation is between 45 and 70m. Its latitude and longitude are 52.3505 and -9.6253 respectively (52° 21&#x27; 2&quot; N, 9° 37&#x27; 31&quot; W). As with most of the West of Ireland, the weather of the area is strongly affected by the North Atlantic drift and the prevailing south-westerly winds. Being 10 km inland and well beyond the hills to the south-west, Kilflynn is somewhat sheltered from extremes of wind speed and precipitation experienced largely in the south and west of County Kerry. The average monthly rainfall (full years from 1981 to 2020) is 98mm, with an average of 20 days per month registering rain (&gt;0.1mm) and 15 wet days per month (&gt;1.0mm), with the wettest months usually between October and January. The average daily maximum temperature is 14 °C and the average daily minimum temperature is 7 °C. Summer and winter temperatures (between 2009 and 2021) are 16 °C and 6 °C respectively. For agriculture and horticulture, the last spring air frost is typically in late March or April, that is to say about five to six weeks later than coastal areas (on exposed land). This is still favourable compared to areas further inland. The agricultural land surrounding the village is regarded as good and mostly unspoilt.

Surface spring water was used until the late 1970s for drinking in some surrounding areas. The regional bedrock aquifers for the purposes of drinking water are regarded as locally important and moderately productive, used where there was no water main connection. In the limestone areas to the north, the aquifers are regionally important. The River Shannow, which runs through Kilflynn, emanates from the hills south-west of the N69 from Tooreen to Stacks Mountain townlands and is a tributary of the River Brick, which in turn joins the River Feale, entering the Atlantic south of Ballybunion. Up until the 1980s, there were eels and fish such as brown trout to be found in the river up at least as far as the Waterfall (where the N69 crosses), with birdlife such as various types of finch, dippers and what are locally called &#x27;cranes&#x27; (grey herons, which were caught and eaten historically). Since then, the river life has been affected by pollution.

Kerry County Council, which expects a modest increase in population, has made plans for updated local water treatment, improvements for pedestrians and cyclists, and supporting repopulation with associated services, also commenting on Kilflynn as a choice for commuters [into Tralee and Listowel] while impressing the need to retain its peaceful character.

== History until 1900 ==

The first known human presence in Ireland after the last ice age has been determined as c.10,500 years B.C.

When the original Celts of Ireland actually arrived is unknown, with suggestions having been made of between 100 and 5000 years B.C. from linguistic and other evidence. The late Neolithic Beaker folk introduced their cultural advances possibly from the Low Countries or from Iberia; this resulted in key changes and Irish becoming a unique Celtic language. Recent evidence shows a huge number of Irish men have the R1b DNA marker with similarly high percentages also found in other modern Celtic areas on the European Atlantic coast, including the Basque region. The first known farmers in Ireland or Britain landed in Kerry c.4350 B.C. but the incidence of their DNA markers is now very scarce, the R1b marker replacing it c.2500 B.C. This coincides well with the arrival of a dominant Beaker culture, including the introduction of copper mining and metallurgy in Kerry.

In 2011, archaeologists working on the site of the realignment of the N69 Tralee-Listowel road found evidence for early Bronze Age and mediaeval activity in the townlands of Gortclohy and Cloonnafinneela. The Gortclohy dig provided evidence for tool usage from the Beaker period; alder charcoal from the site was carbon-dated to between 2132 and 1920 B.C. This is the most northerly evidence for the Beaker folk in County Kerry. The first Cloonnafinneela dig provided evidence of early mediaeval iron-working, with oak and alder charcoal carbon-dated to between 432 and 595 A.D. and further evidence of pit-kiln charcoal production 200–300 years later. A second dig at Cloonafinneela gave up evidence of various plants as burnt roofing thatch including rushes, cereals, hazel, oak and willow charcoal, the hazel dated to between 1450 and 1635 A.D.

Kilflynn is in the middle of the area settled in the first century by the Ciarraighe (also Ciarraigh or Ciarraidh], the mediaeval tribe (from which the county name Kerry is derived) and claimed descendants of Ciar the son of the mythological queen Medb of Connacht and one of her lovers, king Fergus mac Róich of Ulster.


Prior to this the Velabri around Kerry Head and further south the Iverni people (or Iernoi from the earlier Greek) were noted by Ptolemy to be concentrated in the south-west area of Ireland, speaking the most primitive Goidelic language similar to Gaulish (as recorded on Ogham stones, with examples found close by in Knockbrack and Tralee, from the 6th Century). The Érainn, in Irish tradition, may be the name for the same group of people as there are linguistic links.

Kilflynn was a historical civil parish in the barony of Clanmaurice. This barony developed from the area which had been in the control of native leaders (especially O&#x27;Conors) but was taken over by the Norman, Maurice, son of Thomas FitzGerald of Shanid who died in 1213. Thomas FitzGerald himself was son of Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Llanstephan, who had supported &#x27;Strongbow&#x27;, Lord Pembroke, in his Cambro-Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169 and who began the Geraldine dynasty in Ireland and their House of Desmond. Later earls of all County Kerry were scions of the FitzMaurice barons.

Kilflynn has sixteen constituent townlands: Ballyconnell, Cappagh, Castletown, Cloghaneleskirt, Cloonnafinneela, Crotta, Fahavane, Glanballyma, Gortclohy, Kilflynn (village), Knockbrack East, Knockbrack West, Knocknahila, Rea, Stack&#x27;s Mountain and Tooreen.

The Stack family, also of Norman heritage, had their seat at Crotto (later known as Crotta) just north of Kilflynn and also owned surrounding townlands.
Kilflynn had been known as Stackstown, and the name remains geographically in Stack&#x27;s Mountains south-east of Kilflynn. The family landowners, namely James (owner of Garrynagore, Gortclohy and Cloghanaleskirt), John (owner of Aghacoora), Richard (owner of Killaspicktarvin (and more northerly townlands)) and Thomas Stack (owner of Gortaneare, Ballyconnell, Castletown, Crotta, Glanballyma, Knocknahila, Cloonnafinneela, and Cappagh) forfeited their landed possessions because of their support for the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and the subsequent Catholic Confederation. The reconquest of Ireland between 1649 and 1652 by Cromwellian forces after the English Civil War resulted in the Act for the Settlement of Ireland of 1652 which required a survey for the redistribution of land (hence Sir William Petty&#x27;s survey) often to invading soldiers in lieu of wages. Henry Ponsonby, the younger brother of Sir John Ponsonby (a colonel of horse in the New Model Army), was the recipient of most of the Stacks&#x27; (and others&#x27;) confiscated land - much of which was profitable. This was reconfirmed in 1666, after the Acts of Settlement. Part of the Down&#x27;s Survey was Pender&#x27;s Census, taken between 1654 and 1659. The census refers to &#x27;The Barony of Clanmorice&#x27;, the townland of &#x27;Crottoe&#x27; and the &#x27;Tituladoe&#x27; as Henry Ponsonby Esq. The population for the whole of Clanmaurice is given as 1126, of whom 86 are English and 1040 Irish. There are 17 with the surname &#x27;Stack&#x27; and 17 with &#x27;FitzMorrice and MacMorrice&#x27;.

Ponsonby built Crotta House in 1669. The house was sold in 1842 by Thomas Carrique Ponsonby (later resident in Dublin, so this possibly marked the end of the Ponsonbys in Kerry) and was being leased by about 1850 by Lieutenant Colonel Henry Horatio Kitchener, father to Horatio Herbert Kitchener, the first Earl Kitchener, Earl of Khartoum, Field Marshal of the British Army and Minister for War for Great Britain, who spent most of his youth at Crotta. The mostly derelict remains of the house itself collapsed or were demolished in the 20th century.

From 1840 the Poor Law Union plans (as basic administrative division) of Listowel replaced the Norman Clanmaurice barony and civil parish boundaries (although the latter continued to be used to make comparisons) after the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act 1838.

Kilflynn was on the main road from Tralee to County Limerick. Farming was the principal industry for centuries and services such as forges for smithing, and lime kilns from the late 1600s (to make lime for acidic soils) developed around this. Local forges were still operational in the mid-20th century. The remains of some kilns can still be found dotted about the landscape. There was a population decline, possibly partly associated with the opening of what is now the main Tralee-Listowel road to the south in 1846, and then the North Kerry railway line with stations opening at Abbeydorney and Lixnaw in 1880 (the line ceasing services entirely from 1978). However, there was also from the 1840s onwards the significant effect of the peak years of the Great Famine in which between 20% and 30% of the population of Kerry died or emigrated (see map). In 1841, 1851 and 1861 the population of Kilflynn village was 147, 134 and 119 respectively (in 2011 it was 126). The area covers two election districts (Kilflynn and Kilfeighny) so these figures may not be entirely representative.

== History from 1900 ==

Kilflynn people joined the Irish Volunteers, were involved in the War of Independence and the Civil War.

The Kilflynn company of the Irish Volunteers was formed in 1913 of about 100 men, drilled by two ex-British soldiers and reservists named Collins and Sheehy. On 13 June 1914 a separate corps formed in Lixnaw, supported on the day by the Kilflynn and other Volunteers. Later in 1914, the reservists were called up to fight in what became World War I and in addition John Redmond encouraged the Irish to join the Allied forces, so the company disbanded as a result and didn&#x27;t reform until 1917 at Lixnaw. Engagements with the Royal Irish Constabulary (R.I.C) and the &quot;Tans&quot; (&quot;Black and Tans&quot;, officially the R.I.C. Reserve Force) became vehement from 1919 after Churchill&#x27;s call to British war veterans to assist in Ireland. In March 1921 British forces created a cordon starting from Kilflynn to the Atlantic coast in an attempt to trap and round up IRA members: hundreds of men were imprisoned in Ballyheigue Castle, including just one IRA man.

After two previous failures, the IRA succeeded in blowing up the bridge over the Shannow where the road to Kilflynn joins the Abbeydorney-Lixnaw road (R557). Units from Kilflynn and Abbeydorney lay in wait for Crown forces and opened fire. There were injuries on both sides and a British officer was killed attempting to cross the river.

Kilflynn IRA members in the Civil War (‘Irregulars’) included John McElligott, Danny O’Shea, George O’Shea, Stephen Fuller and Tim Twomey. The latter three were blown up by Free State soldiers using a landmine at Ballyseedy Cross, near Tralee, along with six other Irregulars. Fuller, the only survivor of the explosion, was blown clear and escaped the subsequent coup-de-grâce shooting and bombing. A fabricated explanation of the event, blaming Irregulars for the mine, was given official approval. An investigation by Free State Lieutenant Niall Harrington referred to the report as &quot;totally untrue.&quot; The killings came to represent a defining event in modern Irish history.

Fuller later became a Fianna Fáil TD for North Kerry.

==Modern-day village==
In recent decades, especially in the surrounding farmland, migration of youth for better financial prospects has kept a smaller, ageing population present, as is typically reflected elsewhere in rural villages of Ireland. However, a number of new houses have been built and the local school, Scoil Treasa Naofa (St.Teresa&#x27;s National School) (first sited at Castletown in 1821, just north of the village), has had increased admissions.

Kilflynn has two pubs, a fast food restaurant and a beauty parlour. The Catholic Church is St.Mary&#x27;s and there is also the 18th century Kilflynn Church of Ireland which is used as St.Columba’s Heritage Centre and Museum; these buildings are Recorded Protected Structures. The latter contains the life story of the major local historical figure of note, Horatio Herbert Kitchener, Earl of Khartoum, the former British Field Marshal and Secretary of State for War, who was born in Ballylongford and spent most of his youth at nearby Crotta House. A few outbuildings are all that remain of the original estate.

Kilflynn and Abbeydorney are the two villages in which church services are held in the modern Roman Catholic parish of Abbeydorney, whose priest is Fr. Jerry Keane. The parish is in the deanery of St.Brendan&#x27;s and is one of 53 in the diocese of Kerry, whose bishop is The Most Reverend Raymond Anthony Browne.

The local parliamentary constituency (since 2016) is Kerry, returning five Teachtaí Dála (TDs) to the Dáil Éireann. The current TDs (34th Dáil, 2024) are Norma Foley (Fianna Fáil), Michael Cahill (Fianna Fáil), Pa Daly (Sinn Féin), Danny Healy-Rae (Independent) and Michael Healy-Rae (Independent).

<text>Vanity 6 was an American female vocal trio that gained popularity in the early 1980s. They were protégées of musician Prince. Led by singer Vanity, they are known for their song &quot;Nasty Girl&quot;. Vanity left in 1983 and the band was reformed as Apollonia 6.

== History ==

===Formation===
In 1981, Prince, himself a rising musical star, suggested that Susan Moonsie and her sister Loreen, along with Cavallo, Ruffalo &amp; Fargnoli employee Jamie Shoop form a girl group that would be called the Hookers. Prince&#x27;s vision was that the three women would perform in lingerie and sing sensual songs with lyrics about sex, romance, and fantasy. Later, musician Rick James claimed that Prince had stolen the idea for creating a sexy trio in negligees who sang about love, pain, money, and power from him while Prince was the opening act on James&#x27;s tour in 1980. Set designer Roy Bennett&#x27;s wife Brenda Bennett, who later joined the group stated that Prince was looking to create a somewhat &quot;1980s version of The Supremes.&quot;

The original trio recorded a few demos before Prince met Canadian model and B movie actress Denise Matthews at the American Music Awards in January 1982. Prince was so taken by her charisma that he decided she would be the perfect lead vocalist for his group the Hookers. He also suggested that Matthews use the stage name Vagina. She agreed to be part of the act, but insisted that the name of the group be changed from the Hookers, and that she will not be using the stage name Vagina. They settled on her stage name as Vanity and the group&#x27;s name became Vanity 6. Prince chose the name because he said that looking at her was like looking in a mirror at the female version of himself. Around this time, Prince and Vanity began a romantic relationship. Loreen and Jamie were not in the group, and with Vanity&#x27;s arrival, that left Vanity 6 as Vanity on lead vocals, and Brenda Bennett and Susan Moonsie on backing vocals. Prince provided the group, now dressed in lingerie and high heels, with provocative songs (although within the album credits, group members were sometimes given writing credits).

=== Career ===
Their first single, &quot;He&#x27;s So Dull&quot;, failed to chart on the main US Hot 100 chart and was a minor hit in Australia and the Netherlands; it appeared in the film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot;. 

The second single, &quot;Nasty Girl&quot;, was also not a hit on the US Hot 100, but did become a hit on the U.S. R&amp;B chart, hitting number 7, and the U.S. Dance chart, hitting number one. The song was a top 10 hit in the Netherlands, and a top 20 hit in the Flanders region of Belgium. &quot;Nasty Girl&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;, although it was not included on the soundtrack. It was also featured in the 1983 sex comedy film &quot;Private School&quot; and the 1996 black comedy film Girl 6.

The third single, &quot;Drive Me Wild&quot;, was another minor hit. Music videos were shot for all three singles. Their first and only album, &quot;Vanity 6&quot;, was eventually certified gold. Members of the group sometimes provided backing vocals on Prince&#x27;s albums. The group was the opening act of Prince&#x27;s 1999 tour for his album with the same name in 1982 and 1983, which also featured The Time. 

The hierarchy in the group caused friction between Vanity and Bennett. Prince often put Bennett in charge of rehearsals and checking Vanity&#x27;s vocals when Vanity saw herself as the one in charge of the group. Vanity appeared in a Richard Avedon photoshoot with Prince with one of the photos being used on the cover of the April 28, 1983 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. The issue also contained a two-page Avedon photo of Vanity 6. In 1983, Vanity recorded demos for a number of new songs, including &quot;Sex Shooter&quot;, intended for the ill-fated second Vanity 6 album. During pre-production of the movie &quot;Purple Rain&quot; in August 1983, Vanity decided to leave the group and relinquish her role in the film. Many possible reasons were given for her departure, such as disbursement of royalties, Prince being too controlling, and the end of their romantic relationship.

=== Post-Vanity 6 ===
Vanity was replaced by Apollonia in the group, which was renamed Apollonia 6. She also took over Vanity&#x27;s role in the film &quot;Purple Rain&quot;. The new trio recorded their only album, &quot;Apollonia 6&quot;, in 1984.

Former front woman Vanity went on to have a solo music and acting career. In 1994, Vanity overdosed on crack cocaine and suffered from near-fatal kidney failure. Upon recovering, she became a born again Christian and renounced her stage name and her career in show business. She died from kidney disease on February 15, 2016. Moonsie went on to work as a realtor and later became a restaurateur.

===Singles===
===Unreleased second Vanity 6 album===
A number of songs were intended for the Vanity 6 follow up album, but due to Vanity&#x27;s departure, these songs ended up performed by others.
* &quot;Sex Shooter&quot;, which was released by Apollonia 6. Vanity 6 did record at least one version of this song which has been leaked on the internet. 
* &quot;17 Days&quot;, the B-side to Prince&#x27;s &quot;When Doves Cry&quot;, ended up being released by Prince, with Bennett&#x27;s background vocals still on the recording.
* &quot;G-Spot&quot;, which ended up on Jill Jones&#x27; debut album. The Vanity 6/Prince with Jill Jones background vocals demo has been leaked on the internet as well.
* &quot;Vibrator&quot;, which has been leaked online. The song features Prince in a comedic sketch as well as Jill Jones. It is about Vanity feeling ignored by her lover only to find solace with her &quot;body massager&quot; which midway through the song loses power prompting Vanity to go purchase batteries at two different stores. The song is set in three distinct parts: The verse and chorus portions, then the comedic sketch, and finally, Vanity achieving an orgasm with her vibrator. Vanity&#x27;s vocal track from this song would later be reused by Prince in 1994 for the Come (Prince album) on the outro track &quot;Orgasm&quot;, the final part of a full track &quot;Poem&quot; which is heard throughout the duration of the album. She is credited in the liner notes as &quot;She knows...&quot; by Prince.

<doc id="1019595" wikidata="Q1522881" url="?curid=1019595" title="Killaloe, County Clare">
<text>Killaloe ( ; ) is a small town in east County Clare, Ireland. It lies on the River Shannon on the western bank of Lough Derg and is connected by Killaloe Bridge to the &quot;twin town&quot; of Ballina on the eastern bank of the lake.

The Killaloe Electoral Area is one of six such areas in County Clare and returns four members to Clare County Council.
Killaloe is at the center of the Killaloe Civil parish.

==History==

The town owes its origin to a sixth-century monastic settlement founded by Saint Molua, or Lua, on an island in the Shannon 1 km downstream from the present Killaloe Bridge which later moved onto the mainland. In the tenth century it was base for Brian Boru as it controlled the strategic crossing of the Shannon above Limerick, where the Vikings were in control. Brian Boru had his palace, Kincora (Ceann Coradh), on the high ground where the current Catholic church stands. Therefore, between 1002 and 1014, when he was the High King, Killaloe was effectively the capital of all Ireland. 2 km north of the town, his fort, Beal Boruma, stood on the site of an Iron Age ring at the head of Lough Derg, where a ford crossed the river. The word &quot;Boruma&quot; comes from the tribute paid by those crossing the river and is thought to be the origin of Brian Boru&#x27;s name.

St Flannan&#x27;s Cathedral (Church of Ireland) was built between 1185 and 1225, with an oratory for the same saint, who had been the abbot of Killaloe in the seventh century. The cathedral was destroyed and rebuilt in the fourteenth century. Of the original building, only a romanesque arch survives. In Elizabethan times, Ennis was chosen as the county town of Clare, and the importance of Killaloe declined.

In 1650, Cromwell spent 10 days on the opposite side of the Shannon at Ballina, exploring ways to cross the river, which was the defensive line of Catholic and Royalist forces before the Siege of Limerick. 40 years later, Patrick Sarsfield was the leader of the Jacobite forces here, harrying the Williamite forces advancing on Limerick.

The earliest mention of a (wooden) bridge across the river is in 1013. This was often repaired and eventually replaced by a 17 arch stone bridge in the early eighteenth century, later reduced to 13 arches. Most of the houses in the lower part of the town were built in the eighteenth century. In the nineteenth century the &quot;Shannon Steam Navigation Company&quot; had its headquarters here and constructed a canal to bypass the rapids below the town.

St. Lua&#x27;s oratory, built between 1000 and 1150, was moved from Friar&#x27;s island to the site of the Catholic Church when the hydroelectric scheme at Ardnacrusha was constructed in the 1920s. Killaloe parish is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe. Parish churches are Sacred Heart &amp; St Lua&#x27;s in Garraunboy, St Flannan&#x27;s in Killaloe and St Thomas&#x27; in Bridgetown.

In 2022, Killaloe became twinned as a sister city with New London, Wisconsin USA.

==Amenities==

Killaloe is home to the secondary school, St Anne&#x27;s Community College, which opened in 1987. The University of Limerick has an outdoor pursuits centre near Killaloe on the shore of the lake.

Killaloe has marina facilities for private and rented pleasure craft on the River Shannon network. A parkrun takes place in Clarisford Park each Saturday.

==Natural environment==
A trap and transport scheme is in force on the Shannon as part of an eel management programme following the discovery of reducing populations within the River Shannon. This scheme is intended to ensure safe passage for young eels between Killaloe Bridge and the Shannon Estuary.

==People==
Killaloe was the birthplace of Ireland&#x27;s noted High King, Brian Boru. He ruled from Kincora, which is believed to have been in modern-day Killaloe. American president Ronald Reagan&#x27;s history has been traced back to Killaloe, to Brian Boru&#x27;s father, Cennétig mac Lorcáin.

Former Ireland rugby international captain Keith Wood, also the inaugural IRB International Player of the Year in 2001, is a Killaloe native and owner of the Wood &amp; Bell Café and Restaurant.

Anthony Foley, also a rugby international, and captain of Munster&#x27;s 2005–06 Heineken Cup winning team, was also a resident.

Brendan Grace, an Irish comedian, also had a house and a pub called Brendan Grace&#x27;s in Killaloe. It closed in 2011.

==In fiction==
Killaloe is the home town of Phineas Finn, the fictional hero of two of Anthony Trollope&#x27;s Palliser novels, &quot;Phineas Finn&quot; and &quot;Phineas Redux&quot;. In &quot;Phineas Finn&quot;, Killaloe is presented as a lively, if provincial, social centre. Phineas&#x27;s father, Dr Malachai Finn, is well known and respected &#x27;in counties Clare, Limerick, Tipperary, and Galway&#x27;. Dr Finn is a friend of the Roman Catholic Bishop, another prominent Killaloe resident, and personal physician to the Earl of Tulla, who lives on his estate &#x27;not more than ten miles from Killaloe&#x27;. Phineas returns to Killaloe for extended periods to spend time with his parents and with his five sisters and their friend, Miss Mary Flood Jones, who later becomes his first wife.

The 1917 comic song &quot;Paddy McGinty&#x27;s Goat&quot; mentions Killaloe as the scene of the events it describes, while the &quot;Gaelic Storm&quot; song &quot;Damn Near Died in Killaloe&quot; from the 2017 album &quot;Go Climb a Tree&quot; is set in the town and mentions it repeatedly.

<text>Killala () is a village in County Mayo in Ireland, north of Ballina. The railway line from Dublin to Ballina once extended to Killala. To the west of Killala is the townland of Townsplots West (known locally as Enagh Beg), which contains a number of ancient forts. Historically associated with Saint Patrick, and the seat of an episcopal see for several centuries, evidence of Killala&#x27;s ecclesiastical past include a 12th-century round tower and the 17th century Cathedral Church of St Patrick. As of the 2016 census of Ireland, the village had a population of 562. The village is in a civil parish of the same name.

==History==

=== Ecclesiastical history ===

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Killala (&quot;Alladenis&quot; in Latin) is one of the five suffragan sees of the ecclesiastical Province of Tuam, comprising the north-western part of County Mayo with the Barony of Tireragh in County Sligo. In all there are 22 parishes, some of which, bordering on the Atlantic Ocean, consist mostly of wild moorland, sparsely inhabited. Lewis&#x27;s Topographical Dictionary sets down the length of the diocese as , the breadth , and the estimated superficies as – of which are in County Sligo and in County Mayo.

The foundation of the diocese dates from the time of Saint Patrick, who placed his disciple St. Muredach over the church called in Irish Cell Alaid. In a well that still flows close to the town, local suggests that Patrick baptized 12,000 converts on a single day. Muredach is described as an old man of Patrick&#x27;s family, and was appointed to the Church of Killala as early as 442 or 443. It is possible that he resigned his see after a few years, and retired to end his life on an island in Donegal Bay, which now bears his name, Inishmurray. At Killala, Patrick reputedly also baptized the two maidens whom he met in childhood at Focluth Wood by the western sea, and whose voices in visions of the night had apparently called to him. He came, baptized them and built them a church where they spent the rest of their days as nuns.

Little is known of the successors of Muredach in Killala down to the 12th century. According to an entry in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, the &quot;people of Killala recall that John MacHale, Archbishop of Tuam, was a child of their diocese&quot;. He became Coadjutor Bishop of Killala in 1825, bishop in 1834, and later in the same year was transferred to Tuam. He died in 1881. After him came Francis Joseph O&#x27;Finan, a Dominican priest. On his resignation in 1838, a parish priest of the Archdiocese of Tuam, Thomas Feeney, who had formerly been professor and president of St. Jarlath&#x27;s College at Tuam, was chosen for the post.

Along the left bank of the river are the ruins of several monasteries. Rosserk, a Franciscan house of strict observance, was founded in 1460. The Abbey of Moyne still stands on a site just over the river, and further on, north of Killala, was the Dominican Rathfran Friary. On the promontory of Errew running into Lough Conn stood another monastery. A round tower in Killala itself is still standing.

=== 18th century ===
By the end of the 18th century, Killala had established a small sea port, where fishing was the primary activity. The town also produced coarse linens and woollen products.

=== French invasion ===

Killala was the site of the first engagement, during the Irish Rebellion of 1798, to involve the French force of General Jean Joseph Amable Humbert. On 22 August 1798, Humbert landed at nearby Kilcummin harbour, with 1,109 French troops, with the objective of supporting the rebellion. Humbert&#x27;s force seized Killala and advanced to Ballina, which was also captured with little trouble. The force then moved further inland and, on 27 August, it won the Battle of Castlebar against a larger government force commanded by General Gerard Lake. 
The defeat of the government forces at Castlebar caused a panic in Dublin, and the British government sent reinforcements to Ireland. Humbert and his Irish allies were eventually defeated at the Battle of Ballinamuck in Longford. On 23 September, a government force led by Major-General Eyre Power Trench attacked Killala and ejected the remnants of Humbert&#x27;s invasion force who were still in the town. The defeat was the last land major engagement of the 1798 rebellion. Killala had remained under rebel control for thirty-two days.

== Transport ==

===Harbour===
Killala has a harbour at the south end of Killala Bay.

===Road===
The R314 road connects Killala south to Ballina (and the N26 and N59 roads) and north to Ballycastle.

Bus Éireann route 445 serves Killala a few times a day on weekdays with service to Ballina and Ballycastle.

===Railway===
The line from Ballina to Killala opened on 2 January 1893. It took two years and £29,000 to complete the line, carrying both passengers and freight, the line had a total of five gatehouses, one tunnel and four bridges. At Killala station there was a turntable, two sidings, a signal cabin and a stationmaster&#x27;s house that is now privately owned. The line proved to be unprofitable and was discontinued for passengers on 1 October 1931 and finally for goods on 1 July 1934.

== Industry ==
Asahi manufactured acrylic fibre from acrylonitrile which was transported to Ballina railway station by rail from Dublin Port. The former Midland Great Western Railway line to Killala had been dismantled and built over prior to the factory&#x27;s establishment south of the village in the 1970s so the remainder of the journey was completed by road. This facility closed in 1997. A proposal to handle asbestos waste at the Asahi site was withdrawn in 2005 due to strong local opposition.

As of 2011, a 50 MW combined heat and power plant using biomass fuel was planned for the former Asahi site. A nearby 20 MW wind farm has a 10 MW battery.

A transatlantic communications cable was expected to come ashore at Killala in 2013 en route to Northern Ireland as part of &quot;Project Kelvin&quot;.

== Places of interest ==
Killala&#x27;s round tower is the last remaining medieval structure of a monastic establishment, thought to have been built in the 12th century. The monastery is traditionally said to have been founded here by Saint Patrick, who appointed St. Muiredach as the first bishop of Killala. The tower stands 52 metres (170 feet) high, and it is composed of limestone.

The Cathedral Church of St. Patrick, built in the 1670s, is one of two cathedral churches belonging to the Church of Ireland&#x27;s Diocese of Tuam, Limerick and Killaloe.

== Culture ==
Killala was used as a location for the 1981 television series &quot;The Year of the French&quot; which was based on the novel by Thomas Flanagan.

In 1989, sculptor Carmel Gallagher unveiled a bust of General Humbert in the area to mark the then upcoming bicentennial of the 1798 Rebellion. In 1998, Killala celebrated the bicentenary of this event by twinning with the commune of Chauvé in France.

<doc id="1019602" wikidata="Q1800597" url="?curid=1019602" title="Lahinch">
<text>Lahinch or Lehinch ( &quot;or&quot; ) is a small town on Liscannor Bay, on the northwest coast of County Clare, Ireland. It lies on the N67 national secondary road, between Milltown Malbay and Ennistymon, roughly by road southwest of Galway and northwest of Limerick. The town is a seaside resort and is home to the Lahinch Golf Club. It has become a popular surfing location.

==Etymology==
Lahinch is the anglicised form of Leath Inse, meaning half island or peninsula. This is not related to &quot;Leacht Uí Chonchubhair&quot;, which means &quot;O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Grave&quot;, referring to the memorial cairn (Leacht) marking the burial place of one of the O’Connor chieftains, who were the ruling clan of the district of Corco Modhruadh Iartharach.

The town was recorded by the Annals of the Four Masters as &quot;Leith Innse&quot;, which is a variant of the Irish word for a peninsula &quot;leithinis&quot; (&quot;half island&quot;), which describes the village&#x27;s location between the Inagh River and the sea. The town today is mostly spelled &quot;Lahinch&quot;, but some road signs in the area use the spelling &quot;Lehinch&quot;.

==History and landmarks==

Several earth forts in the area indicate that the area was inhabited in ancient times, the most prominent of which is on the northern side of the hill above the village along the road to Ennistymon.
The fort is believed to have been built by the Danish Vikings and lies on a hill which later became known as &quot;Doctor&#x27;s Hill&quot; after a doctor was murdered there. In 2020, an ancient monument, believed to be a cliff ring fort created thousands of years ago, was discovered near the coastal area of Lahinch. 

In the Middle Ages, the O&#x27;Brien clan dominated the coastline; Liscannor Castle and Dough Castle are now ruins. The tower of Dough Castle stands on the golf course, and O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Bridge across the Inagh River is in the vicinity. As late as the 18th century, Lahinch was still a small hamlet with only a few fisherman&#x27;s huts. It grew in the 19th century to over 1000 people by 1835, but it was not until later in the century that the infrastructure of the town developed and it became a seaside resort following the opening of the West Clare Railway in 1887. In 1883, the town was struck by a severe storm which destroyed the sea wall and promenade and damaged many buildings. Local governor William Edward Ellis overlooked the repair work which followed and the construction of a new sea wall and promenade were inaugurated by the wife of the Viceroy, Lady Aberdeen, in July 1893.

A book &quot;Holiday Haunts of the West Coast of Clare&quot; (1891) stated that Lahinch&#x27;s &quot;strand for length, width and evenness is not to be excelled in Ireland&quot;, noting that the &quot;accommodation is excellent, neat and respectable&quot;. The following year, the establishment of Lahinch Golf Club further contributed to the growth of the town. In 1900, Gertrude Crowe of &quot;Times Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;Lahinch, a restful picturesque spot on the west coast of Clare, retains much of its primitive old world charm. In the good times, it is celebrated for the assemblage of rank and beauty and fashion who resorted thither for bathing. An 1822 Guide mentions that the neighbouring gentry was in the habit of having warmly contested races on the strand.&quot; Historically the people of the town celebrated Garland Sunday on the last Sunday of July, attracting people from across the county. Stalls lined the main street with numerous other attractions for the visitors.

On 22 and 23 September 1920, British RIC troops avenged the Rineen Ambush, in which they lost six men, by scorching some 26 buildings, including Lahinch Town Hall and the local dance club on the Promenade. Aideen Carrol describes the RIC as running &quot;amok in Lahinch and Miltown Malbay in an orgy of burning and beating&quot;. Dan Lehane&#x27;s house at Cragg near Lahinch was raided and he was interrogated at gunpoint, but to no avail.

The West Clare Railway closed in 1961, but the town has retained its popularity and in recent times has become a renowned surfing location. Today the town contains several small cafes and restaurants, a church, a pub, the Lahinch and Shamrock Hotels, a bookstore and a surfing school. Just outside the town is Moy House, a country house set in 15 acres of woodland on the River Moy, voted Country House of the Year by &quot;Georgina Campbell&#x27;s Ireland&quot; in 2003. In the summer of 1996, Lahinch Seaworld and Leisure Centre with an aquarium, a 25 m indoor swimming pool, children&#x27;s pool, sauna, Jacuzzi, and other facilities opened. In 2002 G. A. Finn published &quot;Lazy Days at Lahinch&quot;, a light-hearted collection of short stories about local golfers. A scene from the TV series Father Ted was shot on Lahinch beach. This scene was included in the &quot;A Christmassy Ted&quot; episode, released on DVD, in October 2009. Due to its coastal location, Lahinch often bears the brunt of Winter storms. In January, 2014, a major storm occurred, which produced massive spectacular waves, which crashed against the main Promenade. Pictures of the massive waves, received widespread media coverage. 

=== Lahinch Church ===
The current Catholic church replaced an older church, at the same location, which was built in 1831. This church was demolished in 1947, due to its dilapidated condition. The new church, which was designed by Corr and McCormick architects, had a capacity for 450 parishioners. This was the same firm, which had designed the nearby Ennistymon Catholic church. The new church was significantly larger than the old church, which held just 250 parishioners. Creation of the new larger church proved a challenge for the architects, as the old site was small, had adjacent houses, and backed up to steep hill. This resulted in an adjacent house being demolished, and a retaining wall being constructed at the rear of the site. The new church was opened in 1954, by the then Bishop of Galway, Michael Browne, at a cost of 38,000 Irish pounds. The church is in the Modernist style, yet has an Italianate feel, being gable-fronted to the north, with its dominant square belfry. The roof has a low pitch, due to storms from the sea in winter. The sanctuary floor was made from imported Italian marble. Major alterations were carried out in 1991, when side alters were removed, and the sanctuary was remodeled, at a total cost of 45,000 Irish Pounds. In 1995, a three-light window depicting The Annunciation, The Nativity, and The Presentation was added. In addition, a circular stained-glass window, showing the Virgin as the Mother of the Seasons, was also added over the entrance.

==Sport==

Lahinch is home to the 36-hole Lahinch Golf Club, founded in 1892. The original links was laid out by Old Tom Morris. Alister MacKenzie, who co-designed Augusta National Golf Club, redesigned and extended the links in 1927 for a fee of £2,000. Lahinch Golf Club is home to the South of Ireland Championship, an amateur golf tournament which began in 1895. It was also host to the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open, in July 2019.

Lahinch has become one of the foremost surfing locations in Ireland, and is home to a surfing school. On 14 May 2006, 44 surfers managed to ride one small wave, setting a new world record. Lahinch is also a location for other watersports including kitesurfing and windsurfing. Lahinch Sea Rescue, an independent lifeboat service, provides protection for water-users.

Moher Celtic and Sporting Ennistymon are the local soccer clubs. The clubs have underage teams from U8s up to U16s who play in the Clare Schoolboy/Girls Soccer League. The Youths and Junior A and B teams play in the Clare District Soccer League. The A team play in the Premier Division in the Clare District Soccer League and the B team play in the Third Division. The underage teams and only one of the Junior teams play their home fixtures in Lahinch Sportsfield. Mohers Celtics B team plays their fixtures at Liscannor Sportsfield while Sporting Ennistymon B team plays at Mullagh Sportfield.

Other activities in the area include fishing, cycling, hiking, and pony trekking.

==Transport==

===Bus===
Bus Éireann route 350 links Lahinch to several locations: Ennis, Ennistymon, Cliffs of Moher, Doolin, Lisdoonvarna and Galway. There are a number of journeys each way daily. Onward rail and bus connections are available at Ennis and Galway. Lahinch is also linked to Doonbeg, Spanish Point, Miltown Malbay, Kilfenora, Corofin and Ennis by Route 333, with services running Monday to Saturday once daily.

===Rail===
Lahinch was formerly served by the narrow gauge West Clare Railway, which linked Kilrush, Kilkee and Milltown Malbay with Ennis. The railway station opened on 2 July 1887; the entire line (including Lahinch station) closed on 1 February 1961. Nowadays Ennis railway station is the nearest and Bus Éireann route 350 stops outside it.

<doc id="1019604" wikidata="Q1016915" url="?curid=1019604" title="Liscannor">
<text>Liscannor () is a coastal village in County Clare, Ireland. It is located on the R478 road between Lahinch and Doolin, close to the Cliffs of Moher. As of the 2016 census it had a population of 113.

==Geography==
Lying on the west coast of Ireland, on Liscannor Bay, the village is located on the R478 regional road between Lahinch, to the east, and Doolin, to the north. The Cliffs of Moher are about north west of the village. Between Lahinch and Liscannor lies the small village of Moymore. Liscannor is located in the civil parish of Kilmacrehy.

==History==

Liscannor probably takes its name from an old fort that was located here. &quot;Lis&quot; meaning a &quot;fort&quot; and &quot;Cannor&quot; a corruption of the name &quot;Connor&quot;.

The area around Liscannor was part of the Barony of Corcomroe, controlled by the O&#x27;Connor family.

At least 30 ships of the Spanish Armada, sent to invade England in the summer of 1588, were lost along the coast of Ireland, mainly along the western seaboard. The oar-powered galleass Zuñiga was damaged, and anchored off-shore of Liscannor. The ship came under surveillance by the High Sheriff of Clare and by crown forces, and those Spanish sailors who had come ashore had to withdraw to their ship. One captive was taken and sent for interrogation. The Zuñiga escaped the coast with favorable winds, and later reached Le Havre.

The village of Liscannor is of late 18th century origin. According to an 1814 survey there were nearly 200 houses in it at the time, and about ten of them had flag roofs. 40 houses were used by fishermen.

While there was once a &quot;Gaeltacht&quot; (Irish-spealing area) around the Liscannor area, by 1956 the loss of native speakers meant that it could no longer be considered a Gaeltacht area.

==Points of interest==
=== Cliffs of Moher ===
The Cliffs of Moher are one of Ireland&#x27;s top visitor attractions, and include a protected colony of cliff-nesting seabirds. The area was designated as a Refuge for Fauna in 1988, and as a Special Protection Area for Birds (SPA) under the EU Birds Directive in 1989.

=== Kilmacreehy Church and graveyard ===
&quot;Cill MacCreiche&quot; (Kilmacreehy Church) is first documented in the 14th century, but some of the church&#x27;s structures, including its Gothic ornamentation, are later additions.

===Liscannor Castle===
Liscannor Castle was an O&#x27;Connor stronghold which, like Dough Castle, later passed to the O&#x27;Briens. In 1712, the Earl of Thomond let the estate to William Fitzgerald (annual rent £14). Under the Fitzgerald family, the town began to grow in the later 18th century.

The ruined remains include a six-story tower with a spiral stairway to the east and a lower main building next to it. This latter was described in some detail by Thomas Johnson Westropp in the late 19th century, who noted that it had five floors.

=== St. Brigid&#x27;s Well ===

Located at a site of pre-Christian Lughnasadh celebrations, &quot;Dabhach Bhríde&quot; (or Brigid&#x27;s Vat) is located near the Cliffs of Moher. Behind the well, on a higher level to which steps lead, is an ancient cemetery. There is a large cross here and a circular path around it, and part of the Rite of the Holy Well is performed in this area known as the &quot;Ula Uachtarach&quot; or upper sanctuary.

The well, dedicated to Brigid of Kildare, is in the lower ground, the &quot;Ula íochtarach&quot; or lower sanctuary, enclosed in a little house which contains votive offerings left by pilgrims.

The well has been a pilgrimage site since at least the 1830s, when following a personal cure which he attributed to the waters of the well, Cornelius O&#x27;Brien had the well house built. Pilgrims from elsewhere in County Clare and from the Aran Islands came to Liscannor. Pattern Days on which large groups attended included St Brigid&#x27;s Day (1 February) and Garland Sunday (late July).

=== Liscannor Harbour ===

The harbour was built between 1825 and 1831 for £2,900, of which £2,000 was a government grant.

In modern times, the harbour has a number of fishing vessels moored there as well as smaller boats using it is a launching site for sea fishing/recreational sports. During summer months there is also a ferry service to the base of the Cliffs of Moher as well as to the Aran Islands.

In the past the harbour was a hub for fishing vessels as well as a location to export locally quarried Liscannor Stone and to receive in coal supplies. Some historical documents note that due to the silting of the harbour, ships could only carry approximately 380 tonnes into port. At low tides ships had to be winched into harbour. A currach would bring the rope out to the ship. Locally quarried flag was cut and polished beside the harbour and winched onto ships by steam crane. These slabs were transported to several British cities.

===John P. Holland memorials===
The engineer John Philip Holland (1841–1914), who was born in Liscannor, developed some of the first submarines commissioned by the US Navy, Japanese Navy and Royal Navy. Castle Street, on which Holland was born, was renamed &#x27;Holland Street&#x27; in his honour.

There are several memorials to Holland in the area, including one erected on the 50th anniversary of his death in 1964. A further memorial, donated by the Submarine Veterans of the US Navy, was erected in Liscannor in 1977.

A visitor centre, the John P. Holland Centre, opened in 2016. A statue of Holland, originally on public display on Liscannor&#x27;s Main Street, was moved into the centre, alongside displays about his life and work with submarines.

== Churches ==
=== St. Brigid&#x27;s Church ===

St Brigid&#x27;s Church in Liscannor was built in 1858. It is a single-cell, four-bay church built of rubble masonry. A new roof was later added but the gallery, y-mullioned windows and semi-Tudor door were retained. Although the construction of a round tower was suggested in the 1920s, this &quot;Touheran&quot; tower which would have housed the bell as well as cottage industries on the lower floors was never built.

Liscannor has been referred to as &quot;the Pope&#x27;s Own Parish&quot;. Located in the Diocese of Kilfenora, of which the Pope is the Bishop and the Bishop of Galway is the Apostolic Administrator, Liscannor is a mensal parish, i.e. directly under the direct authority of the bishop.

=== Moymore Church ===

The church of Moymore was built in 1877, on an elevated site overlooking the bay. There was no church previously at this location. Before that the people of the area attended Mass in a small thatched chapel a quarter mile to the east in Caheraderry (Derry).

=== Derry Church ===

The Caheraderry (Derry) church probably dates from the 17th century penal times, built either to facilitate travelling friars or possibly as an out-chapel or hermitage for Kilmacreehy Church. Beside the ruins stand two small one-room attached cottages. According to local tradition, one of these cottages was a sheebeen known as Gleeson&#x27;s and the other a schoolhouse, where a hedge-schoolmaster taught.

==Infrastructure==
===Transport===
Bus Éireann route 350 links Liscannor to several locations: Ennis, Ennistymon, Cliffs of Moher, Doolin, Lisdoonvarna and Galway. There are a number of journeys each way daily. Onward rail and bus connections are available at Ennis and Galway.

== Sports ==
===Liscannor GAA===
Liscannor won a county title in 1940 – with a combined team from the broader North Clare area. Liscannor GAA Club was reformed in 1985 as a separate entity after players from the area had played with The St Michaels team for a number of years. Liscannor were promoted to Intermediate ranks after winning the Junior title in their first year after reforming in 1985. Liscannor also won the league title in 1985. An intermediate title followed in 1988, but Liscannor were to revert to the Intermediate grade after one year at Senior level. It would be 12 years later, in 2000, before Liscannor returned to the Senior Grade.

===Moher Celtic===
Moher Celtic is the local football club. They have reached two Clare Cup finals in their history but have been edged out on both occasions.

<doc id="1019608" wikidata="Q1025582" url="?curid=1019608" title="Loughrea">
<text>Loughrea ( ; ), is a town in County Galway, Ireland. It lies to the north of a range of wooded hills, the Slieve Aughty Mountains and Lough Rea, the lake from which it takes its name. The town&#x27;s cathedral, St Brendan&#x27;s, dominates the urban skyline. The town is in a townland and civil parish of the same name.

The town increased in population in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Although Loughrea serves as a commuter town for the city of Galway, it remains an independent market town. Loughrea is the fourth most populous settlement in County Galway, with a population of 6,322 as of 2022.

== Name ==
The town takes its name from Lough Rea, ( being a variant of meaning grey or speckled). It is situated on the northern shore of the lake. The lake&#x27;s Irish name is used in the name of the local Irish-language multi-faith primary school: Gaelscoil Riabhach. The town is located within an area that was historically called Trícha Máenmaige.

==History==
===Pre-Norman===
The town is in an area that was historically called Trícha Máenmaige, which was under the control of Ui Fhiachrach Fionn, and later of the Uí Maine. The area contains many examples of Gaelic and Early Christian settlements. There is evidence of crannog settlements on the Lake of Loughrea, with up to 14 individual crannogs identified dating back to the 6th–7th centuries AD.

===Norman settlement===

The modern town was founded in 1236 by Richard de Burgo, an Anglo-Norman knight who built a castle along an ancient route between the River Shannon and the west coast. Today the remains of the medieval town wall, medieval priory, moat and a town gate are all still to be seen. The House of Burgh adopted the names and customs of Gaelic Ireland and became closely intermarried and related to the local Gaelic nobility of Ireland. The Burghs even assumed the White Wand and the role of Irish clan chiefs in the following centuries, until 1543 when Ulick &quot;Bourck, alias Mac William&quot;, embraced the surrender and regrant policies of Henry VIII, receiving it back to pass down under primogeniture with the new title, the Earl of Clanricarde.

===Pre-Famine===
By the 1700s, Loughrea was a regional market and garrison town. During the Williamite War in Ireland, an attempt by Williamite forces to take Galway was defeated in a short skirmish at Loughrea.

===Post-Famine===
Loughrea was at the centre of the Gaelic Revival towards the end of the 19th century. The various elements of this revival in the town included Celtic Revival Art, the Irish Literary Revival, Gaelic games and the Irish language revival.

===Independence===
Like many towns with garrisons, there was little support for the 1916 rebellion in Dublin, though some locals supported the rising in Galway. There was a Battalion of Irish Volunteers in Loughrea. They were not involved in any major battles and instead they mainly protected the local Sinn Féin Club members.

===20th century===
From 1920 until 1960 Loughrea maintained its role as a market town. The town is also the cathedral town of the Roman Catholic diocese of Clonfert, and the 20th century saw a number of large-scale religious events. The 1960s brought industrial developments such as the Tynagh Mines.

Loughrea was historically a farming town that cut its industrial teeth with the Tynagh mines, to the east. There is now a gas-powered electricity power station on the site of the mines. As well as being a dormitory town for Galway, Loughrea now hosts a number of pharmaceutical and data-processing industries. Loughrea&#x27;s tourist infrastructure is supported by several hotels, a country resort, as well as many bed-and-breakfasts, restaurants, coffee shops and pubs.

== Places of interest ==

The Cathedral of St. Brendan on the lakeshore, in the town centre, is considered an important repository of Celtic Revival art and architecture. St. Brendan&#x27;s Catholic Cathedral was designed by William Byrne in 1897 and completed five years later. Its double transepts are an unusual architectural feature. Spring-fed Loughrea Lake (Lough Rea) is overlooked by Knockash and fished for brown trout, pike and perch. There are also rudd, brook lamprey, three-spined stickleback, nine-spined stickleback and eels in the lake. The lake is home to many waterbirds. Migratory species from Europe live at the lake during the winter, and it provides nesting grounds for other species during the summer. The lake is listed as a site of international importance for the shoveler and a site of national importance for the coot and tufted duck. It is also used for water sports and swimming. Immediately behind the Loughrea boathouse are the remains of an old crannog. The Loughrea dwellers in ancient times would have sought protection from raiders by living in the comparative security provided by the lake.

There is a stone relief sculpture in town, on Millenium House, West Bridge, of Stoney Brennan&#x27;s face. Brennan &quot;according to legend, was hanged on Gallows’ Hill at Mount Carmel for stealing a turnip&quot; during the 1700s.

== Transport ==
Loughrea is connected to the M6 Dublin-Galway motorway via the N65. The town was historically served by the Midland Great Western Railway and a railway branch from Attymon Junction, in use until 1975. This line was Ireland&#x27;s last operational rural railway branch line, having outlasted most other country railway lines of this type by 10–20 years, and even surviving to have diesel trains used on it. The link road from the Ballinasloe–Galway motorway to Loughrea removed most of the remains of the original track bed. Loughrea railway station opened on 1 December 1890 and finally closed on 3 November 1975.

== Sport and culture ==

Hurling, is the dominant sporting hobby in the town and also the immediate outskirts. Loughrea GAA Club were 2006 winners of both the Galway and Connacht Senior Club Hurling Championships. They also reached the 2007 All-Ireland Club Hurling Championship final, losing out to Ballyhale Shamrocks. Loughrea also has a rugby club, a soccer club, a Gaelic football club, a volleyball club, an 18-hole golf course, a cycling club and an athletic club. Actor Kiefer Sutherland has an affection for the town, twice visiting family as a young boy and is said to have been amazed at the skill of the players down at the handball alley.

Each year, in October, the town plays host to the BAFFLE International Poetry Festival. Loughrea also boasts a Musical and Dramatic Society, historical society, and a community association. In the 2018 National Glór na nGael awards for &quot;Irish language in local communities&quot;, Loughrea&#x27;s &quot;Gaeilge Locha Riach&quot; was awarded best voluntary committee in Connaught. Gaeilge Locha Riach promotes the Irish language in Loughrea among the community and businesses. There is also a Foróige Youth club in the town.

Each year the Local Triathlon club called Predator organise a junior and senior triathlon event. The race was created by French coach Sebastien Locteau in 2006 with Tony Daly. Loughrea Triathlon is part of the national event calendar under Triathlon Ireland rules.

<text>Millstreet () is a town in north County Cork, Ireland. As of the 2022 census, it had a population of 1,722.

Millstreet is within the civil parish of Drishane, and within a Poor Law Union also called Millstreet. The Millstreet Union encompasses the civil parishes of Drishane and Kilcorney.

==Geography==
The town is at the foot of Clara Mountain, part of the Derrynasaggart range.

The townlands within Millstreet Poor Law Union were part of the barony of West Muskerry. Aubane was an area within Millstreet Poor Law Union, in the townlands of Tooreenbane and Tullig, and is outside the town itself.

==History==
Evidence of ancient settlement within the town include a ringfort and souterrain site within Coomlogane townland. A number of lintel stones, with Ogham inscriptions, were uncovered on the site in the 1980s. The ruins of Dromsicane Castle, dating to at least the 16th century, are located nearby.

A tower, dating to , is within the enclosure of Millstreet&#x27;s former Church of Ireland church. This church, built in the 1790s and dedicated to Saint Anna, was demolished (apart from the tower) in 1959.

The town&#x27;s present Roman Catholic church was built in 1833 in a neo-classical style, and is dedicated to Saint Patrick. The building was enlarged and modified between 1931 and 1932, with the side walls moved out and the front moved closer to the entrance gate and given a new facade. A presbytery and the Presentation convent, which opened on 28 May 1840, were also built on the site.

==Culture==
The Green Glens Arena, an entertainment complex and large equestrian centre, is located in Millstreet. It has hosted a number of major events, including the Eurovision Song Contest 1993, with Millstreet being the smallest town to host the competition. After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the arena was agreed to be used for temporary accommodation for Ukrainian refugees.

Since 1961, Millstreet Town Park has been used for a &#x27;Christmas meeting&#x27; of a local coursing club. In 2021, the controversial practice of live hare coursing was subject to protest by local residents.
Since 1985, the town has been twinned with Pommerit-le-Vicomte in Brittany, France.

==Transport==
The town is on the Mallow–Killarney–Tralee line of the Irish railway network. Millstreet railway station, which opened in 1853 and closed for some goods traffic in 1976, was refurbished in 1993 and remains open for passenger train services.

Bus Éireann provides bus service via the Macroom - Killarney route.

<doc id="1019612" wikidata="Q336487" url="?curid=1019612" title="Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer">
<text>Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer, (; 26 February 1841 – 29 January 1917) was a British statesman, diplomat and colonial administrator. He served as the British controller-general in Egypt during 1879, part of the international control which oversaw Egyptian finances after the Egyptian bankruptcy of 1876. He later became the agent and consul-general in Egypt from 1883 to 1907 during the British occupation, prompted by the Urabi revolt. This position gave Baring de facto control over Egyptian finances and governance.

Baring&#x27;s programmes led to limited economic development in Egypt in certain areas, but deepened its dependence on cash crops, as well as regressing some of its social developments (such as the state school system).

==Early life and military career==
Baring was the ninth son of Henry Baring and his second wife, Cecilia Anne (née Windham). The English branch of the Baring family descends from Johann Baring (later, &quot;John&quot;), who emigrated from Germany in 1717. John&#x27;s son Sir Francis was the founder of Barings Bank. Henry was the third son of Sir Francis. When he died in 1848, seven-year old Evelyn was sent to boarding school. When he was 14, he entered the Royal Military Academy, graduating at 17 with a lieutenant&#x27;s commission in the Royal Artillery. He was initially posted to a battery on the island of Corfu.

While on Corfu, Baring became aware of his own lack of education, and began a campaign of self-education, learning Greek and becoming fluent in Italian. He also took a mistress and fathered a daughter out of wedlock, Louisa Sophia. In 1862, he accepted a position as aide-de-camp to Sir Henry Storks, High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands. This position ended in 1864, with the union of Corfu with Greece. Later in 1864, Storks was appointed the governor of Malta, again employing Baring as an aide-de-camp. The next year Baring accompanied Storks to Jamaica, where Storks headed the official inquiry into the Morant Bay rebellion. In 1868, Baring was selected to attend the Army&#x27;s Staff College; he graduated in late 1869. He then worked for two years in the War Office, helping to implement post-Crimean War reforms. In 1871 he was promoted to second captain.

Finding a military career not to his liking, Baring went to India in 1872 as private secretary to his cousin Lord Northbrook, Viceroy of India, and quickly discovered that he had a knack for administration. With Northbrook&#x27;s resignation in 1876, Baring returned to England and married Ethel Errington, daughter of Sir Rowland Errington, 11th Baronet. He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Star of India (CSI) and promoted to major in 1878. The following year he resigned from the army.

==British Controller-General of Egypt==
When Baring first arrived in Egypt in 1877, the country&#x27;s finances were in shambles. Ismail Pasha, Khedive of Egypt, borrowed millions of pounds from European financiers for projects to build the Suez Canal, his personal use, and to cover persistent tax shortfalls. His finances depended on money obtained from Egypt&#x27;s cotton industry, which flourished during the American Civil War. But after the war, as American cotton entered European markets once again, the price of cotton fell dramatically. As a result, Egypt&#x27;s cotton was no longer the cash crop it used to be. Ismail Pasha found himself unable to pay off even the interest on his debts.

At first, Ismail attempted to call on his parliament to raise more tax money, but Parliament resisted, as it consisted mostly of large landowners, who were lightly taxed. In desperation, Ismail turned to the European powers to help him out of his financial troubles. After some rocky negotiations the Dual Control system was instituted, whereby a French and a British controller were appointed to oversee Egypt&#x27;s finances. Sir Evelyn Baring was appointed as the British Controller. Egyptian historian Afaf Lufti al-Sayyid-Marsot considers this desperate attempt on Ismail&#x27;s part to obtain European help to have opened the way for foreign control of Egypt&#x27;s finances, and eventual incorporation of Egypt into the British Empire.

Despite, Sir Evelyn&#x27;s ties to Barings Bank through his family, and that bank&#x27;s significant financial stake in Egyptian debt, no concern for apparent conflict of interest in his appointment was ever apparent; nor did the possibility of mixed motives ever give the government pause in supporting Baring&#x27;s economic programmes. 

Baring and his fellow controller&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; control of Egypt&#x27;s finances meant they wielded considerable influence in both the Egyptian and British governments. When Ismail refused to declare bankruptcy, Baring pressured his government to depose Ismail, which they did in 1879. The general population of Egypt widely blamed Ismail for the country&#x27;s financial struggles, and his removal was greeted with relief. Ismail was succeeded by his son Tawfiq, who cooperated with the European consuls.

==Consul-General of Egypt==
The &#x27;Urabi Revolt, led by Ahmed &#x27;Urabi, a rising Egyptian colonel, endangered the Khedivate. After the subsequent intervention by the British in Alexandria (the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War), Baring returned from India to Egypt as the British agent and consul-general, &quot;with a mandate for minor reforms and a prompt withdrawal of British troops&quot;. Baring though advocated for a continued occupation of Egypt and disparaged Egyptian demands for independence.

Baring&#x27;s first act as Consul-General was to approve of the Dufferin Report, which essentially called for a puppet parliament with no real power. The report asserted the need for British supervision of reforms deemed necessary for the country. It stated the interests of the Suez Canal zone should always be maintained. Baring believed that because of Egyptian administrative incompetence, a long occupation was essential to any sort of reform. He established a new guiding principle for Egypt known as the Granville Doctrine (named for the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Granville). The doctrine enabled Baring and other British officials to fill the government with those Egyptian politicians that would be cooperative with the British and the power to dismiss Egyptian ministers who refused to accept British directives. Under Baring, British officials were positioned in key ministries and a new system, known as the Veiled Protectorate, was introduced. Essentially, the government was a façade. Egyptian ministers were the outward form, yet British officials held the actual power. Baring thus remained the real ruler of Egypt until 1907, and this arrangement worked well for the first ten years of British control because Tawfiq Pasha was a weak man more than happy to abdicate any governmental responsibility. 

The Egyptian army, which Baring considered utterly untrustworthy due to its previous mutinies against the Khedive, was disbanded and a new army organised along British lines (much like in India). With Egyptian finances stabilised by 1887, Baring also compelled the government in Cairo to abandon any pretension of reconquering the Sudan, which Egypt had lost control of following the Mahdist Rebellion. Careful –and often stingy– handling of the budget, plus promotion of irrigation projects, brought considerable economic prosperity to Egypt. Baring believed that at some point in the future, British control of Egypt would end, and full independence would be restored, but only once the Egyptian people learned proper self-governance. Al-Sayyid-Marsot contends that under Baring, Egyptian nationalists were inert and many Egyptians believed in Britain&#x27;s policy of &quot;rescue and retire&quot;, but that Baring had no intention of doing so as, al-Sayyid says, &quot;Baring believed that &#x27;subject races&#x27; were totally incapable of self-government, that they did not really need or want self-government, and that what they really needed was a &#x27;full belly&#x27; policy which kept it quiescent and allowed the elite to make money and so cooperate with the occupying power.&quot;

In 1892, Tawfiq died and Abbas Hilmi II succeeded him. The young, ambitious khedive wanted to expel foreign influence and to that end encouraged a nationalist movement, but he had not reckoned with Baring, who quickly intimidated him into submission. Research, however, has shown that the Egyptian nationalist movement was active until the late 1890s, mainly from the secret societies surrounding the new Khedive. These were led by the young nationalist leader Mustafa Kamil and supported by foreign local elements, especially among the French and Greek communities of Egypt. Lord Cromer had a negative experience in India, where advanced education led to Indian nationalism that was highly critical of the Raj. In Egypt Cromer reduced the budget for education, closed many of the specialised postsecondary institutions, and refocused the curriculum on vocational topics. Tuition fees were imposed which reduced the availability for most Egyptians.

Baring was embroiled in controversy in both Egypt and Britain in the wake of severe punishments meted out to Egyptian peasants following the 1906 Denshawai Incident, even though he was out of the country at the time and had no direct involvement. The new Liberal government under Prime Minister Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman decided to adopt a more lenient policy towards Egypt, and Baring, sensing the end was near, offered his resignation in April 1907. The official reason given for his departure was health issues. In July 1907, Parliament awarded him £50,000 in recognition of his &quot;eminent services&quot; in Egypt.

=== Honours===
Baring was in August 1901 created Viscount Errington, of Hexham, in the County of Northumberland, and Earl of Cromer, in the County of Norfolk. In June 1902 he received an honorary doctorate (D.C.L.) from the University of Oxford, and in 1906, Baring was made a Member of the Order of Merit by King Edward VII.

== Baring, women, and Islam ==
Baring held a &#x27;traditional Orientalist&#x27; perspective in relation to the East, Egypt in particular, believing Westerners to be inherently superior in every way when compared to Egyptians. According to Edward Said, Baring believed the &#x27;Orient&#x27; and its inhabitants were meant to be subdued and disciplined by the Western world.

In 1901 Baring discovered that increased enrollment in primary schools had resulted in a growing demand for secondary school enrollment opportunities. Women and men alike had begun to seek higher education as an opportunity to be eligible for government positions and upward mobility. Instead of increasing Egyptians&#x27; opportunities to receive education, Baring held that subsidised education was not the province of the government and instead raised tuition fees at existing primary schools in order to cut enrollment. Both women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s institutions suffered from Baring&#x27;s new legislation, fuelled by his fear that an educated working class might foster dangerous nationalistic sentiments against the colonial government. Baring went on to curb opportunities for women already working in the professional world by discrediting their skill; he urged Egyptians that female doctors were not as adept as their male counterparts and that, in the Western world, men were the most trusted medical practitioners. When Egyptians complained about the lack of jobs available to them (due in large part to limited access to education), Baring went so far as to deny the existence of an Egyptian nationality. He worked specifically to limit employment opportunities for women.

In line with his Orientalist views, Baring believed Egyptian society and the Islamic world as a whole to be inherently inferior to the Western world. As such, it was a culture that, in Baring&#x27;s eyes, bred inferior people with inferior minds and ideas. According to Baring, Egypt could only succeed in the modern world once it had eliminated Islam from its culture. In particular, Baring believed the subordinate nature of Eastern culture was made blatantly obvious in its treatment of women. Baring argued that Westernised Christianity elevated the status of women while Islam taught that women should be degraded through the veil and segregation based on gender.

Baring&#x27;s opinions on segregation and the veil in particular went on to influence popular and academic discourse surrounding issues of women and Islam. Baring initiated unveiling campaigns during his time in Egypt. Qasim Amin, a French-educated upper-middle class lawyer was deemed one of the first feminists due to his rejection of the veil as oppressive—an opinion grounded largely in Baring&#x27;s original argument. Amin&#x27;s work, influenced by Baring&#x27;s ideas, served as some of the foundational literature that inserted women and their &#x27;subjugation&#x27; in Islam into prominent discourse surrounding colonial rule and westernisation. Outside of written works, the artist Ya’qub Sanu’a (educated, like Amin, in Europe) drew political cartoons, one of which depicted women representing Egypt, Russia, France, and Britain with the Egyptian woman entirely covered. His policies are considered to by some to be representative of the &quot;white man&#x27;s burden&quot; attitude.

== Later years ==

Baring returned to Britain at the age of 66 and spent a year regaining his health. In 1908, he published, in two volumes, &quot;Modern Egypt&quot;, a narrative of events in Egypt and the Sudan since 1876. In 1910, he published &quot;Ancient and Modern Imperialism&quot;, an influential comparison of the British and Roman Empires. In 1914, after World War I broke out, the Khedive Abbas II of Egypt supported the Ottomans and was deposed by the British. This freed Baring to publish his impressions of the Khedive, &quot;Abbas II&quot;, in 1915.

A lover of the classics, Baring was very well-read and spoke Greek, Latin, Italian, French, and Turkish, but he never bothered to learn Arabic – the language of the lower classes in Egypt. During the opening years of the 20th century, a nationalist movement began to appear in Egypt, but Baring, who became increasingly aloof with age, brushed it off as inconsequential.

Baring was active in politics. Having been raised to the peerage as Lord Cromer in 1892, Baring was entitled to sit in the House of Lords. He joined the free-trade wing of the Unionist Party. Baring was a leader of the anti-suffragette cause, serving as the president of the Men&#x27;s League for Opposing Woman Suffrage in 1908, then in 1910–1912, the subsequent National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage.

In 1916 and aged 75, Cromer was appointed to chair the Dardanelles Commission, but it was too much strain for him to handle. In poor health, he would summon meetings at his house if forbidden to go out of doors. Historian John Grigg writes that he was &quot;in effect killed by&quot; the strain of the Commission.

Baring died on 29 January 1917; he is buried at Wimborne Road Cemetery, Bournemouth, at that in time in Hampshire, now in Dorset.

==Family==
Among his siblings were brothers Edward Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke, diplomat Walter Baring, and banker Tom Baring. Cromer&#x27;s only daughter, Louisa Sophia, an ex-nuptial child, was born between 1859 and 1864. He had three sons: Rowland Baring, 2nd Earl of Cromer (1877–1953), who succeeded to his title; the Hon. Windham Baring (1880–1922), who became a director of Baring Brothers bank; and Evelyn Baring, 1st Baron Howick of Glendale (1903−1973), who was a High Commissioner for Southern Africa, and a Governor of Kenya.

<doc id="1019616" wikidata="Q741617" url="?curid=1019616" title="Hanno (crater)">
<text>Hanno is a lunar impact crater that lies near the southeastern limb of the Moon, along the western edge of the Mare Australe. About a crater diameter to the southwest is the prominent crater Pontécoulant.

Hanno is a heavily worn crater formation with an outer rim that has been battered and pock-marked by small impacts. A small crater attached to the north-northeastern rim forms a depression in the side. The inner walls are nearly featureless except for a few small craterlets, and the interior floor is likewise level and battered by tiny craters.

The Hanno crater was named after Hanno the Navigator.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hanno.

<doc id="1019617" wikidata="Q192916" url="?curid=1019617" title="PEGI">
<text>PEGI ( ), short for Pan-European Game Information, is a European video game content rating system established to help European consumers make informed decisions when buying video games or apps through the use of age recommendations and content descriptors. It was developed by the Interactive Software Federation of Europe (ISFE) and came into use in April 2003, replacing many national age rating systems with a single European system. The PEGI system is now used in 41 countries and is based on a code of conduct, a set of rules to which every publisher using the PEGI system is contractually committed. PEGI self-regulation is composed by five age categories and nine content descriptors that advise the suitability of a game for a certain age range based on the game&#x27;s content. The age rating is not intended to indicate the difficulty of the game or the skill required to play it.

== Age ratings ==

PEGI has six age categories.
=== Content descriptions ===
In addition to the above ratings, PEGI also uses nine content descriptors:

==== Current ====
====Former====
In Portugal, the PEGI 3 and 7 categories were originally aligned with the age ratings of the film classification system – 4 &amp; 6, respectively – to avoid confusion. Finland also used a modified scale, where the PEGI 12 and 16 categories became 11 and 15, respectively. Finland fully adopted PEGI on 1 January 2007, while Portugal fully adopted it on 14 January 2021, and the standard ratings were fully enforced as well in both countries at the respective dates. 

== Rating process ==
To obtain the ratings for any piece of interactive software, the applicant submits the game with other supporting materials and completes a content declaration, all of which is evaluated by an independent administrator called the Netherlands Institute for the Classification of Audiovisual Media (NICAM). It is based on the Dutch Kijkwijzer system as well.
Following the evaluation the applicant will receive a license to use the rating logos. If the applicant disagrees with the rating, they can ask for an explanation or make a complaint to the complaints board. Consumers may also make complaints to this board.

Although PEGI was established by an industry body (ISFE) the ratings are given by a body independent of the industry and the whole system is overseen by a number of different Boards and Committees. There is the PEGI Council, composed mainly by national representatives for PEGI, that recommends adjustments to the code in light of social, legal and technological developments. Members of the PEGI Council are recruited for their skill and experience from among parent/consumer body representatives, child psychologists, media specialists, civil servants, academics and legal advisers versed in the protection of minors in Europe.

There is also a Complaints Board with experts from various European countries. They deal with complaints related to breaches of requirements of the code of conduct or to age rating recommendations. Should a complaint be received from a consumer or publisher regarding a rating given to a game and no satisfactory settlement can be reached by the PEGI administrator through discussion, explanation or negotiation the complainant may formally request the Complaints Board to mediate. Three board members will then convene, hear the complaint and decide on a ruling. Publishers using the PEGI system are bound by the decision of the Complaints Board. Consequently, they are obliged to carry out any corrective actions required and, in cases of non-compliance, are subject to sanctions as laid out by the code.

== Global cooperation in IARC ==
In 2013, PEGI co-founded the International Age Rating Coalition with USK and the ESRB. IARC aims to streamline the rating of digitally distributed games and apps by providing a single online system that produces age ratings for all participating regions. By filling out one questionnaire, a publisher instantaneously receives ratings from PEGI, USK, ESRB, ACB and others.

== PEGI Online ==
In 2007, the PEGI Online division of PEGI was formed as an addition to the PEGI system for online games. Goals include giving young people in Europe improved protection against unsuitable online gaming content and educating parents on how to ensure safe online play. This project is supported directly by the European Commission:

PEGI Online is based on four principles:
* The PEGI Online Safety Code and Framework Contract which is signed by all participants
* The PEGI Online Logo which will be displayed by holders of a licence
* The website for applicants and for the general public
* An independent administration, advice, and dispute settlement process

The licence to display the PEGI Online Logo is granted by the PEGI Online Administrator to any online gameplay service provider that meets the requirements set out in the PEGI Online Safety Code (POSC).

== Usage ==

PEGI is the standard age rating system for video games in 40 European countries alongside Israel, but products with PEGI labels can be found across the globe alongside other rating systems as a result of import for linguistic reasons (e.g.: English versions in India, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates, Spanish or Portuguese versions in Latin America). The official status of PEGI ratings varies from country to country, depending on the way national legislation deals with age classification and the protection of minors. In some countries, PEGI is the de facto standard without specific regulation, other countries have officially acknowledged PEGI as the sole system for age ratings, while yet another number of countries have incorporated the PEGI rating system into laws governing the age classification of media, making the labels enforceable in retail.

== Reception ==
=== Portrayals of gambling ===
Games containing minigames resembling casino games and gambling may be subject to heightened ratings due to &quot;12&quot; being the minimum for the &quot;Gambling&quot; descriptor. A 2016 re-release of &quot;Pokémon Red and Blue&quot; for Nintendo 3DS received a &quot;12&quot; rating (despite receiving the &quot;E&quot; rating from the U.S.-based ESRB) due to its &quot;Game Corner&quot; feature, which includes slot machines that can be played with in-game cash to earn coins redeemable for items. The European release of &quot;Pokémon Platinum&quot; (2009) was modified to remove the slot machines and replace them with non-interactive &quot;game machines&quot;. As of 2020, PEGI&#x27;s policies regarding content that resemble casino games and gambling have gotten stricter, with new games featuring the &quot;Simulated Gambling&quot; content descriptor automatically receiving an &quot;18&quot; rating from that point forward.

In 2019, the basketball video game &quot;NBA 2K20&quot; received criticism for a trailer, focused on its &quot;MyTeam&quot; mode, which depicted chance-based minigames styled after casino games such as roulette, slots and pachinko. The visuals were considered to be sensitive due to increasing controversy over use of &quot;loot box&quot; mechanics in video games. After receiving an e-mail expressing concern over the trailer, PEGI clarified in response that the &quot;Gambling&quot; descriptor applies only to games that &quot;teach&quot; and &quot;encourage&quot; gambling, although admitting that the trailer&#x27;s imagery may have been &quot;too close for comfort&quot; for some viewers, and that PEGI did not base its ratings decisions on singular trailers.

&quot;Balatro&quot;, a roguelike deck-building game, had its PEGI rating changed from 3+ to 18+ shortly after its February 2024 release due to perceived gambling imagery, and was pulled from some online stores. Playstack, the game&#x27;s publisher, argued that while the game was based on poker and features poker hands, it does not feature or encourage gambling. &quot;Balatro&quot; was restored to the Nintendo eShop in Europe, Australia and New Zealand on 8 March with the higher 18+ rating. In a Reddit AMA, &quot;Balatro&quot; developer Localthunk criticised PEGI for re-rating the game after its release, writing &quot;I still believe that the rating is unwarranted, but there is some gray area for interpretation from PEGI and at this point it is what it is. I think the one thing I am most disappointed by is the fact that other games with actual gambling mechanics aren&#x27;t rated the same way because of their appearance/theme.&quot; PEGI reclassified &quot;Balatro&quot; as well as &quot;Luck Be a Landlord&quot;, which, &quot;Balatro&quot; was inspired by, to PEGI 12 in February 2025, saying that the gambling aspects were mitigated by the fantasy nature of gameplay, and for future games, they will devise a more granular approach when considering gambling-like elements in games.

<doc id="1019618" wikidata="Q674377" url="?curid=1019618" title="Mizen Head">
<text>Mizen Head () is traditionally regarded as the most southerly point of mainland Ireland although Brow Head is the actual southernmost point. It is at the end of the Mizen Peninsula in the district of Carbery in County Cork.

==Geography==
Mizen Head is one of the extreme points of the island of Ireland and is a major tourist attraction, noted for its dramatic cliff scenery. One of the main transatlantic shipping routes passes close by to the south, and Mizen Head was, for many seafarers, the first (or last) sight of Europe. 

The tip of the peninsula is almost an island, cut off by a deep chasm, now spanned by a bridge; this gives access to an old signal station, a weather station, and a lighthouse. The signal station, once permanently staffed, is now a museum housing displays relating to the site&#x27;s strategic significance for transatlantic shipping and communications, including the pioneering efforts of Guglielmo Marconi. The &quot;99 steps&quot; which formed part of the original access route have been supplemented by a series of paths and viewing platforms, and a full range of visitor facilities is available at the entrance to the site. The villages of Ballydehob, Crookhaven, Goleen, and Schull are located on the peninsula to the east.

Nearby Brow Head, also on the Mizen Peninsula and a short distance to the east, is several metres further south than Mizen Head. Nevertheless, geography books have long measured the length of Ireland, diagonally northeast-to-southwest, as &quot;from Fair Head to Mizen Head&quot; or north-to-south &quot;from Malin Head to Mizen Head&quot;.

==History==
Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; (2nd century AD) referred to the point as the &quot;southern headland&quot; ().

The headland&#x27;s Irish name, &quot;Carn Uí Néid&quot;, means &quot;cairn of Néid&#x27;s grandson&quot;. This refers to Balor, a leader of the Fomorians in Irish mythology. In a tale dating from at least the 12th century, the god Lugh defeats Balor in combat and chases him to Mizen Head. There, Lugh beheads Balor and sets the severed head on a large rock, which then shatters.

<text>Monkstown ( - &#x27;the town of the monk&#x27;, formerly anglicised as &quot;Ballinvannegh&quot;) is a village in County Cork, Ireland, in the old barony of Kerrycurrihy. It lies 14 kilometres southeast of Cork city on the estuary of the River Lee, facing Great Island and looking onto Monkstown Bay. For census purposes, Monkstown is combined with the nearby town of Passage West, and the combined area has a population of approximately 5,800 residents. The village is in a townland and civil parish of the same name. The Catholic parish of Monkstown includes the nearby villages of Shanbally and Ringaskiddy.

==History and name==
The name of the village is said to derive from an early monastic site near to where Monkstown Castle now stands. Although no archaeological evidence remains for the monastery, the site of the monastery&#x27;s abbey is referenced (as Legan Abbey) in 19th century maps and works. Over time, the name Baile an Mhanaigh/Monkstown overtook the old name &quot;Baile an Fealach&quot; (Foley&#x27;s homestead), although the latter name persists in the name of a townland of the village: Ballyfouloo.

==Monkstown Castle==

Monkstown Castle is a fortified tower house that was constructed around 1636 by Anastasia Archdeacon, reputedly as a surprise gift for her husband John. He had been fighting with the Spanish Catholics in the continental wars of the time. As implausible legend has it that, when John Archdeacon&#x27;s ship entered Monkstown bay, a cannonball was fired at the castle, as it was believed to have been built by an occupying force. Anastasia Archdeacon hired workers to come to Monkstown to build the castle. She housed the workers (in accommodation built specially for them), and fed and clothed them (for a price). Once the workers had settled up their bills with her, it is said that the overall cost of the castle worked out at about four pence.

The castle was, over the centuries, owed or occupied by Cromwellian soldier Thomas Plunkett, Archbishop of Armagh Michael Boyle, and the Bernard Shaw family. Later used as a club house for the nearby Monkstown Golf Club, the castle was seriously damaged by fire in the 1970s. The castle has since been partially renovated and, as of 2021, on the market for sale.

<doc id="1019626" wikidata="Q3990574" url="?curid=1019626" title="Thomas Anstey Guthrie">
<text>Sir Thomas Anstey Guthrie (8 August 1856 – 10 March 1934) was an English writer (writing as F. Anstey or F. T. Anstey), most noted for his comic novel &quot;Vice Versa&quot; about a boarding-school boy and his father exchanging identities. His reputation was confirmed by &quot;The Tinted Venus&quot; and many humorous parodies in &quot;Punch&quot; magazine.

==Early life and family==
He was born in Kensington, London, to Augusta Amherst Austen, an organist and composer, and Thomas Anstey Guthrie. He was educated at King&#x27;s College School and at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and was called to the bar in 1880.

Guthrie&#x27;s younger brother was the physician Leonard Guthrie (1858–1918).

==Writing career==
The popular success of his story &quot;Vice Versa&quot; (1882) with its topsy turvy substitution of a father for his schoolboy son, at once made his reputation as a humorist of an original type. In 1883, he published a serious novel, &quot;The Giant&#x27;s Robe&quot;, which George Gissing described as &#x27;very poor stuff&#x27;. Anstey discovered (and again in 1889 with &quot;The Pariah&quot;) that it was not as a serious novelist but as a humorist that the public insisted on regarding him. As such, his reputation was further confirmed by &quot;The Black Poodle&quot; (1884), &quot;The Tinted Venus&quot; (1885), &quot;A Fallen Idol&quot; (1886), and other works.

Guthrie became an important member of the staff of &quot;Punch&quot; magazine, in which his &quot;voces populi&quot; and his humorous parodies of a reciter&#x27;s stock-piece (&quot;Burglar Bill, &amp;c.&quot;) represent his best work. In 1903, his successful farce &quot;The Man from Blankley&#x27;s&quot; based on a story that originally appeared in &quot;Punch&quot;, was first produced by Sir Charles Hawtrey at the Prince of Wales Theatre, in London. It starred Hawtrey, Arthur Playfair and Faith Stone. After London, it played in New York, Washington DC, Detroit and Chicago. He wrote &quot;Only Toys&quot; (1903) and &quot;Salted Almonds&quot; (1906).

Many of Anstey&#x27;s stories have been adapted into theatrical productions and motion pictures.

&quot;The Tinted Venus&quot; was adapted into a silent film, &quot;The Tinted Venus&quot;, in 1921.

&quot;The Tinted Venus&quot; was adapted by S. J. Perelman, Ogden Nash, and Kurt Weill into &quot;One Touch of Venus&quot; in 1943. A 1948 film, &quot;One Touch of Venus&quot;, was based on Guthrie&#x27;s book and the musical.

&quot;Vice Versa&quot; was adapted as a play in 1883 and has been filmed many times, usually transposed in setting and without any credit to the original book. Another of his novels, &quot;The Brass Bottle&quot;, has also been filmed more than once, including &quot;The Brass Bottle&quot; (1964). His &quot;Tourmalin&#x27;s Time Cheques&quot; (1891) is one of the earliest stories featuring the science fiction concept of intentional and frequent movement in time, and probably the first to investigate the practical paradoxes such a concept would create.

Guthrie wrote an autobiography, under both his pen and true names, in 1936 entitled &quot;A Long Retrospect&quot;.

==Death==
Guthrie died on 10 March 1934.

<text>Howard Thomas Odum (September 1, 1924 – September 11, 2002), usually cited as H. T. Odum, was an American ecologist. He is known for his pioneering work on ecosystem ecology, and for his provocative proposals for additional laws of thermodynamics, informed by his work on general systems theory.

==Biography==
Odum was the third child of Howard W. Odum, an American sociologist, and his wife, Anna Louise (née Kranz) Odum (1888–1965). He was the younger brother of Eugene Odum. Their father &quot;encouraged his sons to go into science and to develop new techniques to contribute to social progress&quot;. Howard learned his early scientific lessons about (a) birds from his brother, (b) fish and the philosophy of biology while working after school for marine zoologist Robert Coker, and (c) electrical circuits from &quot;The Boy Electrician&quot; (1929) by Alfred Powell Morgan.

Howard Thomas studied biology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he published his first paper while still an undergraduate. His education was interrupted for three years by his World War II service with the Army Air Force in Puerto Rico and the Panama Canal Zone, where he worked as a tropical meteorologist. After the war, he returned to the University of North Carolina and completed his B.S. in zoology (Phi Beta Kappa) in 1947.

In 1947, Odum married Virginia Wood, and they later had two children. After Wood&#x27;s death in 1973, he married Elisabeth C. Odum (who had four children from her previous marriage) in 1974. Odum&#x27;s advice on how to manage a blended family was ; Elisabeth&#x27;s was to hold back on discipline and new rules.

In 1950, Odum earned his Ph.D. in zoology at Yale University, under the guidance of G. Evelyn Hutchinson. His dissertation was titled &quot;The Biogeochemistry of Strontium: With Discussion on the Ecological Integration of Elements&quot;, which brought him into the emerging field of systems ecology. He made a meteorological &quot;analysis of the global circulation of strontium, [and] anticipated in the late 1940s the view of the earth as one great ecosystem&quot;.

While at Yale, Howard began his lifelong collaborations with his brother Eugene. In 1953, they published the first English-language textbook on systems ecology, &quot;Fundamentals of Ecology&quot;. Howard wrote the chapter on energetics, which introduced his energy circuit language. They continued to collaborate in research as well as writing for the rest of their lives. For Howard, his energy systems language (which he called &quot;energese&quot;) was itself a collaborative tool.

From 1956 to 1963, Odum worked as the director of the Marine Institute of the University of Texas. During this time, he became aware of the interplay of ecological-energetic and economic forces. He taught in the Department of Zoology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and was one of the professors in the new curriculum of Marine Sciences until 1970.

That year he moved to the University of Florida, where he taught in the Environmental Engineering Sciences Department, founded and directed the Center for Environmental Policy, and founded the university&#x27;s Center for Wetlands in 1973; it was the first center of its kind in the world that is still in operation today. Odum continued this work for 26 years until his retirement in 1996.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Odum was also chairman of the International Biological Program&#x27;s Tropical Biome planning committee. He was supported by large contracts with the United States Atomic Energy Commission, resulting in participation by nearly 100 scientists, who conducted radiation studies of a tropical rainforest. His featured project at University of Florida in the 1970s was on recycling treated sewage into cypress swamps. This was one of the first projects to explore the now widespread approach of using wetlands as water quality improvement ecosystems. This is one of his most important contributions to the beginnings of the field of ecological engineering.

In his last years, Odum was Graduate Research Professor Emeritus and Director of the Center for Environmental Policy. He was an avid birdwatcher in both his professional and personal life.

The Ecological Society awarded Odum its Mercer Award to recognize his contributions to the study of the coral reef on Eniwetok Atoll. Odum also received the French Prix de Vie, and the Crafoord Prize of the Royal Swedish Academy of Science, considered the Nobel equivalent for bioscience. Charles A. S. Hall described Odum as one of the most innovative and important thinkers of the time. Hall noted that Odum, either alone or with his brother Eugene, received essentially all international prizes awarded to ecologists. The only higher education institute to award honorary degrees to both Odum brothers was Ohio State University, which honored Howard in 1995 and Euene in 1999.
Odum&#x27;s contributions to ecosystems ecology have been recognized by the Mars Society, who named their experimental station the &quot;H. T. Odum Greenhouse&quot; at the suggestion of his former student Patrick Kangas. Kangas and his student, David Blersch, made significant contributions to the design of the waste water recycling system on the station.

Odum&#x27;s students have furthered his work at institutions around the world, most notably Mark Brown at the University of Florida, David Tilley and Patrick Kangas at the University of Maryland, Daniel Campbell at the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Enrique Ortega at the UNICAMP in Brazil, and Sergio Ulgiati at the University of Siena. Work done at these institutions continues to evolve and propagate the Odum&#x27;s concept of emergy. His former students Bill Mitsch, Robert Costanza, and Karin Limburg are some former students who have been recognized internationally for their contributions to ecological engineering, ecological economics, ecosystem science, wetland ecology, estuarine ecology, ecological modeling, and related fields.

==Work: an overview==
Odum left a large legacy in many fields associated with ecology, systems, and energetics. He studied ecosystems all over the world, and pioneered the study of several areas, some of which are now distinct fields of research. According to Hall (1995, p.ix), Odum published one of the first significant papers in each of the following areas:
*Ecological modeling (Odum 1960a)

Odum also wrote on radiation ecology, systems ecology, unified science, and the . He was one of the first to discuss the use of ecosystems for life-support function in space travel. Some have suggested that Odum was technocratic in orientation, while others believe that he sided with those calling for &quot;new values&quot;.

==Ecological modeling==

===A new integrative approach in ecology===
In his 1950 Ph.D. thesis, Odum gave a novel definition of ecology as the study of large entities (ecosystems) at the &quot;natural level of integration&quot;. In the traditional role of an ecologist, one of Odum&#x27;s doctoral aims was to recognize and classify large cyclic entities (ecosystems). However, another one of his aims was to make predictive generalizations about ecosystems, such as the whole world for example. For Odum, as a large entity, the world constituted a revolving cycle with high stability. It was the presence of stability, which Odum believed enabled him to talk about the teleology of such systems. While he was writing his thesis, Odum felt that the principle of natural selection was more than empirical, because it had a teleological, &quot;stability over time&quot; component. As an ecologist interested in the behavior and function of large entities over time, Odum sought to give a more general statement of natural selection so that it was equally applicable to large entities as it was to small entities traditionally studied in biology.

Odum also wanted to extend the scope and generality of natural selection to include large entities such as the world. This extension relied on the definition of an as a combination of properties that have some stability with time. Odum&#x27;s approach was motivated by Lotka&#x27;s idea&#x27;s on the energetics of evolution.

===Ecosystem simulation===
Odum used an analog of electrical energy networks to model the energy flow pathways of ecosystems. His analog electrical models had a significant role in the development of his approach to systems and have been recognized as one of the earliest instances of systems ecology.

Electron flow in the electrical network represented the flow of material (e.g. carbon) in the ecosystem, charge in a capacitor was analogous to storage of a material, and the model was scaled to the ecosystem of interest by adjusting the size of electrical component.

===Ecological analog of Ohm&#x27;s Law===

In the 1950s Odum introduced his electrical circuit diagrams of ecosystems to the Ecological Society of America. He claimed that energy was driven through ecological systems by an &quot;ecoforce&quot; analogous to the role of voltage in electrical circuits.

Odum developed an analogue of Ohm&#x27;s Law which aimed to be a representation of energy flows through ecosystems. In terms of steady state thermodynamics, Ohm&#x27;s Law can be considered a special case of a more general flux law, where the flux (formula_1) &quot;is proportional to the driving thermodynamic force (formula_2) with conductivity (formula_3)&quot;, or formula_4.

Kangas states that Odum concluded that as thermodynamic systems, ecosystems should also obey the force-flux law, and that Ohm&#x27;s law and passive electrical analog circuits can be used to simulate ecosystems. In this simulation, Odum attempted to derive an ecological analog for electrical voltage. Voltage, or driving force, is related to the biomass in pounds per acre. The analogous concept required is the biomass activity, that is, the thermodynamic thrust, which may be linear. Exactly what this is in nature is still uncertain, as it is a new concept.

Such a consideration led Odum to ask two important methodological questions:

* What is the electrical significance of a function observed in nature? 
* Given an electrical unit in a circuit, what is it in the ecological system?

For example, what is a diode in nature? One needs a diode to allow biomass to accumulate after the voltage of the sun has gone down, or else the circuit reverses. Higher organisms like fish are diodes.

===The Silver Springs study===
Silver Springs is a common type of spring-fed stream in Florida with a constant temperature and chemical composition. The study Odum conducted here was the first complete analysis of a natural ecosystem.

Odum started with an overall model and in his early work used a diagramming methodology very similar to the Sankey diagrams used in chemical process engineering.

Starting from that overall model, Odum &quot;mapped in detail all the flow routes to and from the stream. He measured the energy input of sun and rain, and of all organic matter - even those of the bread the tourists threw to the ducks and fish - and then measured the energy that gradually left the spring. In this way he was able to establish the stream&#x27;s energy budget.&quot;

===Ecological and biological energetics===
Around 1955 Odum directed studies into radioecology, which included the effects of radiation on the tropical rainforest in El Verde, Puerto Rico (Odum and Pidgeon), and the coral reefs and ocean ecology at Eniwetok atoll. The Odum brothers were approached by the Atomic Energy Commission to undertake a detailed study of the atoll after nuclear testing; the atoll was sufficiently radioactive that upon their arrival the Odums were able to produce an autoradiographic image of a coral head by placing it on photographic paper. These studies were early applications of energy concepts to ecological systems, and explored the implications of the laws of thermodynamics when used in these new settings.

From this view, biogeochemical cycles are driven by radiant energy. Odum expressed the balance between energy input and output as the ratio of production (&quot;P&quot;) to respiration (&quot;R&quot;): &quot;P-R&quot;. He classified water bodies based on their &quot;P-R&quot; ratios, which separated autotrophic from heterotrophic ecosystems: &quot;[Odum&#x27;s] measurements of flowing water metabolism were measurements of whole systems. Odum was measuring the community as a system, not adding up the metabolism of the components as Lindeman and many others had done&quot;. This reasoning appears to have followed that of Odum&#x27;s doctoral supervisor, G. E. Hutchinson, who thought that if a community were an organism then it must have a form of metabolism. However, Golley notes that Odum attempted to go beyond the reporting of mere ratios, a move which resulted in the first serious disagreement in systems energetics.

===Maximum power theory and the proposal for additional laws of thermodynamics/energetics===

In a controversial move, Odum and Richard Pinkerton (at the time physicist at the University of Florida) were motivated by Alfred J. Lotka&#x27;s articles on the energetics of evolution, and subsequently proposed the theory that natural systems tend to operate at an efficiency that produces the maximum power output, not the maximum efficiency.

===Energy Systems Language===

By the end of the 1960s, Odum&#x27;s electronic circuit ecological simulation models were replaced by a more general set of energy symbols. When combined to form systems diagrams, these symbols were considered by Odum and others to be the language of the macroscope which could portray generalized patterns of energy flow: &quot;Describing such patterns and reducing ecosystem complexities to flows of energy, Odum believed, would permit discovery of general ecosystem principles.&quot; Some have attempted to link it with the universal scientific language projects which have appeared throughout the history of natural philosophy.

Kitching claimed that the language was a direct result of working with analogue computers, and reflected an electrical engineer&#x27;s approach to the problem of system representation: &quot;Because of its electrical analogy, the Odum system is relatively easy to turn into mathematical equations ... If one is building a model of energy flow then certainly the Odum system should be given serious consideration... &quot;

===Emergy===

In the 1990s in the latter part of his career, Odum and David M. Scienceman developed the idea of emergy as a specific use of the term embodied energy. Some consider the concept of &quot;emergy&quot;, sometimes briefly defined as &quot;energy memory&quot;, as one of Odum&#x27;s more significant contributions, but the concept is neither free from controversy nor without its critics. Odum looked at natural systems as being formed by the use of various forms of energy in the past: &quot;emergy is a measure of energy used in the past and thus is different from a measure of energy now. The unit of emergy (past available energy use) is the emjoule, as distinguished from joules used for available energy remaining now.&quot; This was conceived as a principle of maximum empower, which might explain the evolution of self-organising open systems. However, the principle has only been demonstrated in a few experiments and is not widely recognized in the scientific community.

==Ecosystem ecology and systems ecology==

For J. B. Hagen, the maximum power principle, and the stability principle could be easily translated into the language of homeostasis and cybernetics systems. Hagen claims that the feedback loops in ecosystems were, for Odum, analogous to the kinds of feedback loops diagrammed in electronic circuits and cybernetic systems. This approach represented the migration of cybernetic ideas into ecology and led to the formulation of systems ecology. In Odum&#x27;s work these concepts form part of what Hagen called an, &quot;ambitious and idiosyncratic attempt to create a universal science of systems&quot;.

===Macroscope===
Hagen identified the systems, thinking of Odum as a form of holistic thinking, who contrasted the holistic thinking of systems science with reductionistic microscopic thinking, and used the term &quot;macroscope&quot; to refer to the holistic view, which was a kind of &quot;detail eliminator&quot; allowing a simple diagram to be created.

===Microcosms===
Odum was a pioneer in his use of small closed and open ecosystems in classroom teaching, which were often constructed from fish tanks or bottles and have been called . His microcosm studies influenced the design of Biosphere 2.

==Ecological economics==

Ecological economics is an active field between economics and ecology with annual conferences, international societies, and an international journal. From 1956 to 1963, Odum worked as Director of the Marine Institute of the University of Texas. During this time Odum became aware of the interplay of ecological-energetic and economic forces. He therefore funded the research into the use of conventional economic approaches to quantify dollar values of ecological resources for recreational, treatment and other uses. This research calculated the potential value of primary production per bay surface area.

For Hall the importance of Odum&#x27;s work came through his integration of systems, ecology, and energy with economics, together with Odum&#x27;s view that economics can be evaluated on objective terms such as energy rather than on a subjective, willingness to pay basis.

==Ecological engineering==
Ecological engineering is an emerging field of study between ecology and engineering concerned with the designing, monitoring and constructing of ecosystems. The term ecological engineering was first coined by Odum in 1962, before he worked at the University of Florida. Ecological engineering, he wrote, is &quot;those cases where the energy supplied by man is small relative to the natural sources but sufficient to produce large effects in the resulting patterns and processes.&quot; Ecological engineering as a practical field was developed by his former graduate student Bill Mitsch, who started and continues to edit the standard journal in the field and helped to start both international and U.S. societies devoted to ecological engineering, and has written two textbooks on the subject One of Odum&#x27;s last papers was his assessment of ecological engineering that was published in the journal Ecological Engineering in 2003, a year after Odum died.

==General systems theory==
In 1991, Odum was elected the 30th president of the International Society for the Systems Sciences, formerly named the International Society for General Systems Research. He presented many papers on the general systems theory at its annual conferences, and edited the last published General Systems Yearbook. The second, revised edition of his major lifework was retitled &quot;Ecological and General Systems: An Introduction to Systems Ecology&quot; (1994). Some of his energy models and simulations contained general systems components. Odum has been described as a &quot;technocratic optimist&quot;, and his approach was significantly influenced by his father, who was also an advocate of viewing the social world through the various lenses of physical science. Within the processes on earth, Odum (1989) believed humans play a central role: he said that the &quot;human is the biosphere&#x27;s programmatic and pragmatic information processor for maximum performance&quot;.

==Publications==
Odum wrote around 15 books and 300 papers, and a &quot;Festschrift&quot; volume (&quot;Maximum Power: The Ideas and Applications of H. T. Odum&quot;, 1995) was published in honor of his work.

Odum was also honored by the journal &quot;Ecological Engineering&quot; for his contributions to the field of ecological engineering and general ecology in recognition of his 70th birthday. The publication included over 25 letters from distinguished scientists from all over the world including Mitsch (lead editorial), John Allen, Robert Ulanowitcz, Robert Beyers, Ariel Lugo, Marth Gilliland, Sandra Brown, Ramon Margalef, Paul Risser, Eugene Odum, Kathy Ewel, Kenneth Watt, Pat Kangas, Sven Jørgensen, Bob Knight, Rusong Wang, John Teal, Frank Golley, AnnMari and Bengt-Owe Jansson, Joan Browder, Carl Folke, Richard Wiegert, Scott Nixon, Gene Turner, John Todd, and James Zuchetto.

<text>The Iraqi National Guard (ING; ) was an armed force originally established by the United States Coalition Provisional Authority. Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, CPA Administrator Paul Bremer disbanded the apparatus of the Iraqi Armed Forces through Coalition Provisional Authority Order 2. U.S. divisions of Combined Joint Task Force 7 then began recruiting and training auxiliary forces, the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps, in order to combat the insurgency.

The ING replaced the former Iraqi Civil Defense Corps.

==History==
&quot;On 20 June 2004, with the concurrence of the Iraqi Interim Government, the ICDC was redesignated as the Iraqi National Guard (ING).&quot; 

As the ICDC became the ING, the United States Army was &quot;..ordered to expand their efforts to train and equip the new ING forces. The 1st Infantry Division and the 1st Cavalry Division in particular devoted a significant amount of resources to establishing these units. In ..Tikrit, units of the 1st ID designed a 3-week course that included training on rifle marksmanship, conduct of traffic checkpoints, map reading, basic drill, and first aid. The ING soldiers continued to improve their skills as they conducted joint missions with Coalition forces. Iraqi Colonel Shaker Faris Al Azawi, commander of the 203d ING Battalion, commented, “Our relationship with the Coalition forces is very good. They give us ammunition, supplies, vehicles, and experience, and the training they’ve given us is very important. Because of it, we’re operating at a very high level.” In addition to providing training to the ING, the 1st ID, with support from Multi-National Security Transition Command – Iraq’s nascent logistics structure,&quot; provided &quot;equipment to the new ING units.&quot;

Despite attacks by the Iraqi insurgency, the Iraqi National Guard was able to recruit many Iraqis from the vast ranks of the unemployed. 

However, there have been several instances where the ING have refused to take military action against fellow Iraqis, deserted, or allegedly aided the resistance. ING units in Fallujah came under attack after the First Battle of Fallujah. In August 2004, insurgents in Fallujah kidnapped the Commanders of the 505th and 506th ING Battalions. One was beheaded. One of the battalion&#x27;s headquarters was overrun, and insurgents &quot;stole a fleet of ING trucks and cars, 10 rocket-propelled grenades, 300 AK-47s, machine guns, ammunition, computers, radios and furniture.&quot; Mass desertions from the two battalions followed. I Marine Expeditionary Force ordered the new battalion commanders to reform their units; an assessment at the time noted that if the reformation was successful, it would be &quot;the third time these two units have been reformed and refitted with equipment and weapons after such desertions (UPI, Marines Disband, 15 Aug 04). The new battalion commanders are now discussing with U.S. forces the possibility moving their soldiers and their families to more secure, isolated bases outside the city.&quot; 

&quot;..ICDC troops and police were sometimes so enmeshed in local dynamics that they used their status and power to engage in corrupt practices..&quot; (Salmoni, 54) 

&quot;National Guard battalions based on the Kurdish militia (peshmerga) or Shi&#x27;a militias, performed adequately. Battalions based on Sunnis did not. Disaffected from the Iraqi government and angry at the Coalition, at this stage in the war, Sunnis generally sympathized with the insurgency and had no intention of fighting their fellow tribesmen or family members. There is little doubt that the U.S. military could have done a better job advising and training the Iraqis. Few commanders embedded advisers with local forces.&quot;

In September 2004, a senior member, General Talib al-Lahibi was arrested on suspicion of having links with insurgent groups. In October 2004, the commander of the 507th ING Battalion, Colonel Mohamed Essa Baher, in Mahmoudiyah, south of Baghdad, barely escaped assassination. Lieutenant Colonel Haydar Rasool, an Iraqi national guard battalion commander based in Baghdad, said he lost more than 30 of his 1,000 men over the past year.

In December 2004, it was announced that the Iraqi National Guard would be dissolved and merged into the New Iraqi Army. At this time its strength was officially over 40,000 men. The merger was planned to take place on Iraqi Army Day, January 6, 2005.

===New National Guard===
In 2016 the Iraqi parliament approved a draft law to recreate a National Guard. The draft law has raised disputes between political parties, and parliament has not yet set a date to take further action. Supporters believe the proposal eventually will be approved.

As of 2024, this proposal was never carried out.

<text>Mohill (, meaning &quot;soft ground&quot;) is a town in County Leitrim, Ireland. The town of Carrick-on-Shannon is approximately 16 km (10 miles) away.

==History==
The Justinian plague of Mohill devastated the local population in the 6th century. Mohill, or &quot;Maothail Manachain&quot;, is named for St. Manachan, who founded the Monastery of Mohill-Manchan here AD. Some sources and folklore say the shrine of Manchan was kept at the Monastery of Mohill-Manchan, before being moved to Lemanaghan in county Offaly for some unrecorded reason. The Monastery was taken over by Augustinians in the 13th century and was later closed in the 16th century, after the time of King Henry VIII. The site of the church is now occupied by a Church of Ireland church and graveyard.

Ownership of the town passed to the Crofton family during the plantations and areas around the town were owned by the Clements family (Lord Leitrim), who built the nearby Lough Rynn estate and was also the owner of what is now Áras an Uachtaráin (Viceregal Lodge, Dublin). Mohill Poor Law Union was formed 12 September 1839 and covered an area of . The population falling within the union at the 1831 census had been 66,858. The new workhouse, built in 1840–42, occupied a site and was designed to accommodate 700 inmates. During the great famine, Anthony Trollope wrote a voyeuristic narrative on Mohill in his novel &quot;The Macdermots of Ballycloran&quot;, an early work.

Hyde Street is named after Rev Arthur Hyde, grandfather of Douglas Hyde, first President of Ireland, who spent part of his childhood in the town. Through at least the 19th and 20th centuries, an impressive number of annual fairs were held at Mohill on: 14 January, February 4, February 25 (Monaghan Day), 8 April, 8 May (or 10 May), 3 June, 1 July, 31 July (or 2 August), 19, 9 and 30 August September, 19 October, 11 November, and 2 December. Back in 1925, Mohill town had population of 755 people, and contained 29 houses licensed to sell alcohol.

==Religion==
The Roman Catholic parish of Mohill also includes the nearby church areas of Eslin and Gorvagh and is administered from St Patrick&#x27;s Church at the top of the town. The Church of Ireland is located at the bottom (east) of the town where the Augustinian Monastery once stood.

==Transport==
The town was served by the narrow-gauge Cavan and Leitrim Railway, which closed in 1959. Mohill railway station opened on 24 October 1887 and finally closed on 1 April 1959.

The R201 regional road runs through the centre of the town, as does the R202. The nearest station is Dromod railway station on the Dublin–Sligo railway line. Mohill is served four times daily Monday to Saturday by the Locallink Ballinamore to Carrick on Shannon bus service which also gives two daily connections to Dromod.

==Events==
The town hosts a large Agricultural Show and Summer festival in August. On the last Sunday in August.

==Sport==

The parish of Mohill currently has two Gaelic Football Clubs, Mohill who play in Division One and Eslin a Division Two team. The Mohill Club also fields teams in Divisions 3 and 5, whilst Eslin field their second team in Division 5 also. Both Clubs have won Senior Titles in the past and in fact, Mohill Faugh-an-Bealaghs won the first-ever Leitrim Championship in 1890, defeating Ballinamore in the final. Ironically Eslin won their first title the following year by defeating Mohill in the Final. Eslin won the last of their three titles in 1917 but have won several Junior Championships in the meantime. Mohill won the last of their five Senior Titles in 2006 defeating St. Marys by one point in a game which saw them complete a dramatic comeback. Mohill and Eslin have often amalgamated for underage competition under the name St. Manachans, named after the patron saint of the parish.

One of Leitrim and Ireland&#x27;s greatest footballers, Packy McGarty, was born in Mohill. McGarty had the distinction of playing for his county over four decades from 1949 to 1973, but his finest hour was in the 1958 Connacht Final, despite the heartbreaking defeat to Galway. There was in fact at one time three Senior teams in the parish as Gorvagh also had a club. In fact, Gorvagh were the kingpins of Leitrim football in the 1920s and are the only team in the county to win four titles in a row between 1924 and 1928, when they were led by their inspirational captain Jack Bohan. The top scorer on the Leitrim team in the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s was Cathal Flynn who was born in Gorvagh and formed a lethal partnership with McGarty during this period.

Mohill also had a successful soccer team, Mohill Town FC and a Hurling club, St. Finbarrs but sadly both are now defunct. Some Mohill players do however still line out with the neighbouring Gortlettragh Hurling Club. Mohill also has a well known Basketball Club and in 2008 the Mohill Under 16 Girls basketball team won the National Title in the Community Games competition. Mohill is also home to the South Leitrim Harriers who hunt throughout the winter in the surrounding countryside. Mohill also had a very successful athletic club which its participants won multiple races all over the country.

==Culture==
In 1856 &quot;Slater&#x27;s Directory&quot; described Mohill as a prosperous, thriving market town: &quot;(Main Street) contains several good shops well-stocked with the various articles of fashion and of local requisites. Great progress is manifest in its general appearance and of its size is considered one of the most stirring, and is certainly the most thriving town of any in the surrounding counties&quot;.

==Education==
Primary school(s): St. Manchan&#x27;s National School (an amalgamation of St. Joseph&#x27;s Girls National School and St. Michael&#x27;s Boys National School, opened in 2005) and the Hunt National School.

Secondary school(s): Mohill Community College ()— an amalgamation of Marian College and Mohill Vocational School, opened in 2008.

==Services==
Mohill Fire Station has nine retained personnel, with one Scania Class B appliance and one Dennis Class B Appliance. Mohill responds to on average 70 calls per year with 10% RTC&#x27;s.

==People==
Mohill is closely associated with Turlough Carolan, the blind harpist, who lived in the town after his marriage. Douglas Hyde, the first president of Ireland, whose family originated from the town, also spent some of his childhood there. Thomas Moran from Drumrahill, near the town, was a renowned 20th-century ballad singer whose songs were collected by the BBC. Matthew Sadlier, a 20-year-old from Mohill, was among 1500 passengers of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; who did not survive the sinking in 1912.

The cleric Charles Reynolds, born and reared at Saint Mary&#x27;s Priory of Mohill, was a leading figure in the 1535 Irish clerical revolt against Henry VIII. Reynolds was attainted of treason in 1536, for persuading the Pope to excommunicate Henry VIII of England.

<text>Mountshannon (, historically anglicised as &quot;Ballybolan&quot;) is a village in east County Clare, Ireland. It is part of the Catholic parish Mountshannon-Whitegate. The village is on the western shore of Lough Derg, north of Killaloe. Mountshannon won the Irish Tidy Towns Competition in 1981.

==History==
The village was designed and built from scratch by Alexander Woods, a Limerick merchant, who intended it as a purely Protestant settlement from which the surrounding Catholic population would be so impressed by the thrift and industry of the settlers that they would quickly convert to the Reformed Church; even as late as the 1830s there was not a single Catholic resident in the village. In fact the reverse happened - it was the Catholics who colonised the village, and the Protestant church in a wooded churchyard bears mute testimony to Woods and his scheme.

Mountshannon was home to the last manually operated telephone exchange in Ireland. The exchange was finally converted to automatic service at noon on May 28, 1987.

==Amenities==
Mountshannon is close to Inis Cealtra, or Holy Island, an uninhabited island that was once home to a monastic settlement. The island has a round tower, and the ruins of several small churches, as well as part of four high crosses and a holy well. The cemetery on this island is still in use, the coffins being transported from the Clare side in small boats. Boat trips can be taken from the harbour to the island. Mountshannon is also on the route of the East Clare Way walking trail.

There is a maze in the centre of town in a small park with views of Lough Derg. The maze features information about the development of the Irish spiritual tradition. Alongside is a picnic area made out of wood carved by local artists, encircled by willow hedging. In the entrance is a stone with a hole facing toward Holy Island. The maze is modelled on the pavement labyrinth at Chartres Cathedral in France.

Mountshannon village has two pubs, a restaurant, a petrol station/shop and a pizzeria. The town has been a recurring winner in the Tidy Towns competition having won the national prize in 1981, silver in 2004 and numerous bronzes over the years. It also took bronze in its population category in 2010.

==Harbour==

Mountshannon Harbour is a sheltered, south-facing harbour, used in the summer months with cruisers, who pull up for the night and visit the village. A separate bathing area is used by local families. A slipway is available for launching small craft.

==White-tailed Sea Eagles==
A breeding pair of white-tailed eagles nested on a nearby island in Lough Derg in 2012. This marked a success for the Irish reintroduction programme which started in County Kerry in the summer of 2007. In early May 2013, the first eaglets were born in Ireland since the re-introduction programme began; one in the Killarney National Park and two here. In 2014 and 2015 further chicks were hatched.

==Civil parish==
The village of Mountshannon lies in the civil parish of Inishcaltra.
In 1898, the parishes of Inishcaltra and Clonrush were transferred from County Galway to County Clare.

==Catholic parish==

==Church of Ireland==
The Church of Ireland parish of Mountshannon and Tuamgraney encompasses the villages of Mountshannon and Tuamgraney. This parish contains the 10th century St. Cronan&#x27;s Church, Tuamgraney, the oldest church in continuous use in Ireland and the United Kingdom.

==Festivals==
Mountshannon hosts a number of events such as the Mountshannon Trad Festival, the Lough Derg Rally, and the annual Mountshannon Festival of Arts which usually takes place around the end of May into the beginning of June.

<text>Newmarket-on-Fergus, historically known as Corracatlin (), is a town in County Clare, Ireland. It is 13 kilometres from Ennis, 8 kilometres from Shannon Airport, and 24 kilometres from Limerick.

==History==

The English rendering of the name &#x27;Newmarket-on-Fergus&#x27; probably owes its origin to the fact that an older &#x27;Market&#x27; at nearby Bunratty (on the Ogarney River) predated the &#x27;newer&#x27; market located at the village and hence Newmarket-on-Fergus; there is also a popular myth attributing the name-change to Lord Inchiqin who supposedly renamed the village after the famous racecourse, and following a victory at the horse-racing centre in England having wagered Dromoland Estate on the race. In the grounds of his neo-Gothic mansion, Dromoland Castle, is the most extensive hill-fort in Ireland, Mooghaun Hill-Fort, with several acres of ground encompassed within its treble walls. It is supposed to have been the site of a prehistoric walled village and a meeting- place in about 500 BC. It is regarded as the oldest ring fort of its kind in Europe. The Gaelic name Cora Chaitlín is reputed to have its origins in a 19th-century famine where weirs were placed across the river Canny at Newtown Canny (i.e. Limerick Road near the present entrance to O&#x27;Regan Park) and Finn mill race, in which to snare eels, hence Cathleen&#x27;s Weir. The proper and original name is transliterated &#x27;Tradaree&#x27; from the Gaelic &#x27;Tradraigh&#x27;; the village being the centre of that ancient district of Tradaree which extended from Bunratty in the south and to Latoon in the north.

One of the earliest known references to the area was in the Book of Survey and Distribution, written in 1636 by James Frost. In it he mentions the main landowners of the area, among them the Earl of Thomond.

There is also mention of Bonratty (later Bunratty) of which Newmarket was in the Barony of, in a 1574 document written by Edward White. His document was written to give an accurate account of the lands of Thomond of which at the time there had been several incorrect descriptions made.

The Parish of Newmarket-on-Fergus is a union of seven ancient parishes: Bunratty, Fenloe, Kilnasoolagh, Drumline, Clonloghan, Kilconry and Kilmaleery. During the Penal Law period of 1744, the High Sheriff of Clare, John Westropp, had all the Churches in these seven Parishes closed.

In a letter to The Secretaries of the Baptist Irish Society dated 20 December 1823, a travelling preacher named W. Thomas stopped over in Newmarket for a night and wrote a letter the aforementioned Society. In it he described the difficulties that people had in hearing a sermon with some people walking miles over land just to hear the word of God. He also gives an insight into the poverty of the time describing children in various states of dress akin to their poorness. He also describes the children&#x27;s eagerness to learn scripture by heart.

In March 1854, about two miles from the centre of the village an immense amount of gold was found in what appeared to be a hastily hidden trove concealed in a stone chamber under a cam of slight elevation, near the lake of Mooghaun, or Lougha- traska.

At 5 August 1920, during the War of Independence the village was the scene of a successful attack on the police barracks. With help from a turncoat, the Irish Republican Army entered the barracks and captured the present members of the Royal Irish Constabulary. The IRA seized weapons and official police documents before leaving.

In a 1962 published autobiography, &#x27;My Father Marconi&#x27;, Degna Marconi, the daughter of the inventor of the radio, Guglielmo Marconi, describes in detail holidaying on the Dromoland Estate in 1905.

In late June 2004, the first summit to take place between the US and the enlarged EU 25 Member States took place in Newmarket at Dromoland Castle.

In the Spring of 2007, six skeletal remains were found during the archaeological monitoring of improvement works to a local water network near Barnhill, Newmarket-on-Fergus. Dating showed that the remains were Pre-Christian.

==Geography==
The town is situated about 10 km from Ennis. As its name implies, it lies close to the River Fergus. The main N18 Limerick–Ennis road passed through Newmarket until the town was bypassed in 2002. That main bypass road was renamed as the M18 on 28 August 2009 as part of a national programme to increase the amount of motorways available to road users.

Neighbouring towns and villages include Clarecastle, Ennis, Cratloe, Sixmilebridge, Quin and Shannon.

To the west of the town is Lough Gash, a turlough (disappearing lake) of considerable size.

==People==

The earliest census to record the population of Newmarket took place in 1659. Newmarket, listed as Corraeathelin in the census as a part of the Barony of Bunratty showed the population as just 9 people living within the confines the village. As of 2016 census, the population of Newmarket-on-Fergus was given as 1,784.

The town is the birthplace of Irish nationalist William Smith O&#x27;Brien. Irish President Michael D. Higgins, though born in Limerick, was educated in Ballycar National School.

==Commerce and tourism==
The town has several small shops and public houses. The proximity of Shannon Airport, and the presence of several places of interest nearby (such as Bunratty Castle and Craggaunowen) brings some tourism to the area, providing business for local bed and breakfast establishments and hotels, like Dromoland Castle. On the grounds of Dromoland Castle is Mooghaun, a late Bronze Age hill fort.

Newmarket-on-Fergus houses the O&#x27;Regan Park, established on a site of about 6 hectares bought and donated by Brendan O&#x27;Regan. The park officially opened in 2003.

==Education==
There are four primary schools in the parish: Scoil na Maighdine Muire/Newmarket-on-Fergus National School, Ballycar National School, Stonehall National School and Clonmoney National School. For secondary education, students attend schools in Ennis and Shannon.

==Transport==
Newmarket-on-Fergus is located on the R471/R458. The N18/M18 is located 1 km away on the Newmarket-on-Fergus bypass. The nearest railway station is in Sixmilebridge.
There is a bus service that services the area on an hourly basis

<text>O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Bridge or O&#x27;Briensbridge () is a village in east County Clare, Ireland, on the west bank of the River Shannon, in a civil parish of the same name. It is named for the bridge across the Shannon at that point, built by Turlough O&#x27;Brien in 1506.

==Location==
The village is 13 km north east of Limerick city. Facing it, on the other side of the river, at the eastern end of the bridge, is the County Limerick village of Montpelier. The two villages are treated as one urban area, O&#x27;Briensbridge-Montpelier, for census purposes.

The parish of O&#x27;Briensbridge, which includes the village of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Bridge, is in the barony of Tulla Lower. (The village was formerly part of the parish of Killaloe.) It is and covers , including a detached district to the southwest. The parish is bounded on the east by the River Shannon. The narrow northern section in mountainous, rising to , and the western part of the parish is also upland.
There were two castles in the parish. The one at the village of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Bridge was inhabited by Murtagh O&#x27;Brien, Baron of Inchiquin, in 1580. It is now entirely gone. The other, Aherinagh, was still reasonably well preserved at the end of the 19th century. In 1580 it belonged to Donogh, son of Conor MacNamara.

==History==
The first bridge across the river here was built in 1506 by Turlough O&#x27;Brien, first Earl of Thomond and his brother, the Bishop of Killaloe.
This first bridge was made of wood, and was burned in 1510 by Gearóid Mór FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare.
The O&#x27;Briens rebuilt the bridge, this time erecting two castles, each with walls thick, one on each side of the river. The castles stood in the water close to shore, and were connected by a 7-arch wooden bridge that rose to above the water. This bridge was destroyed in 1537 by Leonard Grey, the Lord Deputy of Ireland under King Henry VIII of England, after an extended battle against the O&#x27;Briens, who had rebelled. A 12-arch stone bridge was built next. It was replaced around 1750, partially replaced in 1842, and modified to include a navigation arch in the 1920s.

The ancient river-crossing here is believed to be identical with &quot;Áth Caille&quot; (meaning &quot;Ford of the Wood&quot;): one of the three fords mentioned in the &quot;Triads of Ireland&quot;, the others being &quot;Áth Clíath&quot; (Dublin) and &quot;Áth Lúain&quot; (Athlone).

==Sports==

The local soccer club is Bridge Celtic AFC, which was formed in 1963 and currently plays in the Clare Soccer League. The club won the Clare Premier title in 2006/07, for the first time in 28 years.

==Townlands==

The parish contains the townlands of Aharinaghmore, Ardataggle, Ballybrack, Ballycar North, Ballycar South, Ballyknavin, Cappakea, Carrownagowan, Cloghera, Clonboy, Coolnalira, Coumbrack, Earlhill, Fahy Beg, Fahy More North, Fahy More South, Glenlon North, Glenlon South, Kilcredaun, Kilroughil, Knockaderreen, Knockdonagh, Lackareagh Beg, Lackareagh More, Magherareagh, O&#x27;Briensbridge, Ross, Roo East, Roo West and Trough.

<text>Oysterhaven () is a sea inlet on the coast of County Cork, Ireland, immediately to the east of Kinsale harbour. The townlands bordering the northern and eastern sides of the inlet are also known as Oysterhaven.

During the Siege of Kinsale, the English forces besieging the town brought supplies to their camp (which was located to the north of the town) by ship into Oysterhaven and thence by boat up the creek to Brown&#x27;s Mills.

Oysterhaven is associated with the Gaelic Long family. Mount Long castle, now partly in ruin, was built by John Long in 1631. Located in a rural setting on the bank of Oysterhaven bay, this is a very striking feature in the landscape. The castle is a good example of a seventeenth century fortified house, built at a time when more domestic houses were coming to replace the defensive tower house. It is thought to have been burnt by its owners only twelve years after its construction, in 1643.

Oysterhaven is now home to a watersports and &quot;outdoor education&quot; centre.

<doc id="1019643" wikidata="Q310834" url="?curid=1019643" title="Vox populi">
<text>&#x27; ( ) is a Latin phrase (originally Vox populi, vox Dei&quot; – &quot;The voice of the people is the voice of God&quot;) that literally means &quot;voice of the people.&quot; It is used in English in the meaning &quot;the opinion of the majority of the people.&quot; In [[journalism]],vox poporman on the street&quot;&#x27; refers to short interviews with members of the public.

==Man on the street==
American television personality Steve Allen as the host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; further developed the &quot;man on the street&quot; interviews and audience-participation comedy breaks that have become commonplace on late-night TV. Usually the interviewees are shown in public places, and supposed to be giving spontaneous opinions in a chance encounter – unrehearsed persons, not selected in any way. As such, journalists almost always refer to them as the abbreviated &quot;vox pop&quot;. In U.S. broadcast journalism, it is often referred to as a man on the street interview or MOTS.

The results of such an interview are unpredictable at best, and therefore vox pop material is usually edited down very tightly. This presents difficulties of balance, in that the selection used ought to be, from the point of view of journalistic standards, a fair cross-section of opinions.

Although the two can be quite often confused, a vox pop is not a form of a survey. Each person is asked the same question; the aim is to get a variety of answers and opinions on any given subject. Journalists are usually instructed to approach a wide range of people to get varied answers from different points of view. The interviewees should be of various ages, sexes, classes and communities so that the diverse views and reactions of the general people will be known.

Generally, the vox pop question will be asked of different persons in different parts of streets or public places. But as an exception, in any specific topic or situation which is not concerned to general people, the question can be asked only in a specific group to know what the perception/reaction is of that group to the specific topic or issue; e.g., a question can be asked to a group of students about the quality of their education.

With increasing public familiarity with the term, several radio and television programs have been named &quot;vox pop&quot; in allusion to this practice.

==&quot;Vox populi, vox Dei&quot;==
The Latin phrase (), &#x27;The voice of the people [is] the voice of god&#x27;, is an old proverb.

An early reference to the expression is in a letter from Alcuin of York to Charlemagne in . The full quotation from Alcuin reads:

Writing in the early 12th century, William of Malmesbury refers to the saying as a &quot;proverb&quot;.

Of those who promoted the phrase and the idea, Archbishop of Canterbury Walter Reynolds brought charges against King Edward II in 1327 in a sermon &quot;&quot;.
 John Locke in his &quot;Of the Conduct of the Understanding&quot; (1706) criticises the phrase, writing &quot;I don’t remember God delivering his oracles by the multitude, or nature delivering truths by the herd!&quot;.

==Cultural references==
* &quot;Vox Populi&quot; is a paper by Sir Francis Galton, first published in the 7 March 1907 issue of &quot;Nature&quot;, that demonstrates the &quot;wisdom of the crowd&quot; by a statistical analysis of the guesses from a weight-judging contest.
* A variant was used in the 1920 United States presidential election, in which the main candidates were Warren G. Harding and James M. Cox: &quot;Cox or Harding, Harding or Cox? / You tell us, populi, you got the vox.&quot;
* In CollegeHumor&#x27;s actual play Dungeons &amp; Dragons show &quot;Dimension 20: The Unsleeping City&quot;, Kingston Brown holds the title of &quot;Vox Populi of New York City&quot;, the individual selected to be the voice of the people of New York, regarding matters involving magical forces from the Dream Realm.
* The &quot;Vox Populi&quot; are a faction in the 2013 video game &quot;BioShock Infinite&quot; as a communist revolutionary force led by Daisy Fitzroy against the tyrant Zachary Comstock.
*Vox Populi is referenced in the film &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; when V performs his alliterative speech for Evey.
* Sherlock Holmes, in the story &quot;The Adventure of the Abbey Grange&quot;, asks Watson to give judgment regarding a criminal, and after his choice to let him go, Sherlock quotes the phrase &quot;Vox Populi, Vox Dei&quot; and sends the criminal free.
*After his acquisition of Twitter, Elon Musk conducted a poll asking whether or not he should reinstate the account of the former President Donald Trump. Upon the results of the poll, Musk tweeted &quot;The people have spoken. Trump will be reinstated. Vox Populi, Vox Dei.&quot; This poll stated &quot;Reinstate former President Trump&quot; and after 15,085,458 votes, resulted in 51.8% voting &quot;Yes.&quot; Musk used the phrase, once again, in response to a poll he posted on Twitter on November 23, 2022. That poll asked, &quot;Should Twitter offer a general amnesty to suspended accounts, provided that they have not broken the law or engaged in egregious spam?&quot; After being active for one day, the results were 72.4% in favor of account amnesty. 3,162,112 accounts voted. To this, Musk tweeted &quot;The people have spoken. Amnesty begins next week. Vox Populi, Vox Dei.&quot;
*In reference to the decline of legacy media, American journalist and Youtube personality, Andrew Callaghan has criticized the overuse of Vox populi interviews by fellow online content creators, stating in a February 11, 2025 interview, &quot;Most journalists today, it&#x27;s just &#x27;Vox Pop&#x27;, and what that refers to--I read it on Wikipedia one time--it&#x27;s you just get peoples&#x27; reactions to what&#x27;s already happening&quot;. Callaghan points to this as a strategy used to drive online viewership through collective outrage on an issue without the burden of providing any new substantive journalistic reporting.

<doc id="1019645" wikidata="Q174545" url="?curid=1019645" title="Portmagee">
<text>Portmagee () is a village in County Kerry, Ireland. The village is located on the Iveragh peninsula south of Valentia Island, and is known locally as &#x27;the ferry&#x27;, in reference to its purpose as a crossing point to the island. Access to Valentia Island is now via the Maurice O&#x27;Neill Memorial Bridge (R565 road) from Portmagee, which was built in 1970 and named in memory of a member of the IRA executed in 1942 for his part in the shooting dead of Detective George Mordaunt in Dublin.

==Name==
The name Portmagee (Port Magee and Magee&#x27;s Port as it was formerly known) comes from Captain Theobald Magee, a notorious 18th-century smuggler. Having served in the army of King James as an officer, Magee &#x27;retired&#x27; to a life of merchant shipping between France, Portugal and Ireland. Thanks to the many inlets around the South West coast, his trade in contraband spirits, textiles and tea and tobacco was hard to police and therefore very profitable. He married Bridget Morgell, the widow of a rich Dingle merchant and also the daughter of the then representative for Dingle, Thomas Crosbie. 
There is some suspicion that Magee&#x27;s death in a Lisbon monastery was due to some exile imposed by Crosbie, an influential MP. However, his wife and sons continued the family business of smuggling.

==Tourism==
In December 2012, Portmagee was awarded the Fáilte Ireland National Tourism Town Award, the first town to be awarded the accolade.

==Places of interest==
The village serves as a departure point for tourists travelling to visit &#x27;Skellig Michael&#x27;, an island off the coast featuring a 6th-century monastic settlement. Skellig Michael (from Sceilig Mhichíl in the Irish language, meaning Michael&#x27;s rock), also known as Great Skellig, is a steep rocky island in the Atlantic Ocean about from the coast of County Kerry. It is the larger of the two Skellig Islands. Probably founded in the 7th century, for 600 years the island was a centre of monastic life for Irish Christian monks. The Gaelic monastery, which is situated almost at the summit of the 230-metre-high rock became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. It is one of Europe&#x27;s better known but least accessible monastic sites.
Since the extreme remoteness of Skellig Michael has until recently discouraged visitors, the site is exceptionally well preserved. The very spartan conditions inside the monastery illustrate the ascetic lifestyle practiced by early Irish Christians. The monks lived in stone &#x27;beehive&#x27; huts (clochans), perched above nearly vertical cliff walls.

Another monastery, Illaunloughan, is located in the Portmagee Channel north of the town.

South of the town are the popular Kerry Cliffs.

==Traditions==
The &quot;Old Year&quot; celebrations originated in 1727 when a ships crew arrived in Portmagee from Nantes during a heavy winter storm three days after Christmas. Some days later, the locals heard a deafening screech emanating from the end of the pier. The locals tentatively gathered to watch assuming it to be a Banshee but discovered the crew of the French ship carrying torches on a procession through the village. An old ragged man was at the centre wobbling up the street. He fell three times mirroring Christ&#x27;s walk at Calvary and was helped by members of the procession.

At exactly midnight, a shot rang out and the old man fell for the final time. Silence fell until a newly dressed man clad in white and a top hat lept out of the darkness and the music started up playing livelier. The procession began once again as the new man shook hands and gave kisses to the locals. He then gave a speech explaining that the old man represented the year just gone by and the new man symbolised all that was new as the year begun.

The tradition has been commemorated every year since in the village on New Years Eve.

== Skellig Rangers ==
The local GAA team, Skellig Rangers, was founded in 1895 (originally as Portmagee G.A.A, before adopting its present name in the 1930s), and plays at &quot;Pairc Chill Imeallach&quot; in Portmagee.

<doc id="1019647" wikidata="Q937016" url="?curid=1019647" title="Gimme Gimme Gimme (TV series)">
<text>Gimme Gimme Gimme is a BBC television sitcom by Tiger Aspect Productions that was first aired in three series from 1999 to 2001. It was written by Jonathan Harvey, who developed the series with Kathy Burke, who stars as loudmouthed Londoner Linda La Hughes, with James Dreyfus co-starring as her gay flatmate, actor Tom Farrell.

The title from the show stems from both the main characters&#x27; continual search for a male partner, and the theme music is a cover of ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)&quot;. The first two series were originally shown on BBC Two and were deemed successful enough for the third series to be shown on BBC One.

Burke received two BAFTA nominations for Best Comedy Performance for playing the lead character, Linda La Hughes. The show received a nomination in the Best Scripted Comedy category for its third series.

==Premise==
&quot;Gimme Gimme Gimme&quot; centres on loudmouthed Londoner Linda La Hughes (played by comedian and director Kathy Burke) and her gay flatmate, actor Tom Farrell (played by James Dreyfus). A modern twist on the traditional &quot;odd couple&quot; format, much of &quot;Gimme Gimme Gimme&#x27;s&quot; humour springs from its lubricious innuendo subplot, which comes from the mouths of both Tom and Linda.

Linda is characterised by her red hair, white glasses and plump, lycra-clad figure. Boorish, unattractive Linda is convinced she is a &quot;stunner&quot;; in series three she is finally diagnosed with reverse body dysmorphic disorder. It is suggested that Linda and Tom first met at a nightclub, bonded instantly (due to both being on ecstasy), and decided to live together. What follows is, as writer Jonathan Harvey describes, &quot;one long comedown&quot;. Linda often tells humorous anecdotes about her family and childhood which suggest abuse or neglect (such as how she apparently slept on a doormat as a baby, lived in a kennel as a child, and was left in a car-boot for the two weeks her aunt went on holiday), but she always thinks of these as positive experiences. She also claims that her Daddy now lives in an iron lung, although the only proof she has is a photo of a sideboard. Linda also lived in a convent and was sent to a borstal as a teenager. She has crushes on Liam Gallagher (in whom she lost interest after series one as she &quot;couldn&#x27;t bring up another bird&#x27;s child&quot;), Robbie Williams, and both male members of Hear&#x27;Say. She also imagines having sex with Dale Winton in a toilet cubicle.

Tom is melodramatic yet fails in his desire to get acting roles. He believes himself to be truly gifted in the art of acting, and often blames his failures on his agent or society itself. He did appear in one episode of &quot;EastEnders&quot; and often brags about it, delaying for as long as he can the fact that he was in one scene, had one line, and did nothing but buy a from Bianca Jackson&#x27;s market stall. He also appeared in &quot;Daylight Robbery&quot; as an extra, standing in a queue in the background. He had one line but it was cut due to timekeeping. He insists that the entire series was ruined due to the axing of his line. Tom has an obsession with appearing to be middle-class even though he hails from a working-class background, possibly because he also hates his parents. It is often suggested that Tom has no friends whatsoever (apart from Linda and his housemates) but unlike Linda he usually tries to pretend he is popular. Tom is in love with the actor Simon Shepherd.

Although they appear to loathe each other, Tom and Linda are beholden to each other due to the simple fact that nobody else can tolerate them. They are in many ways alike: selfish, unsuccessful, and physically and personally unattractive - although Tom less so. The hapless duo live in a Kentish Town flat (69 Paradise Passage, Kentish Town) rented from elderly ex-prostitute Beryl Merit (Rosalind Knight), who lives in the upstairs flat. Other regular characters are the middle-class, horny married couple Jez (Brian Bovell) and Suze (Beth Goddard), who live in the basement flat. Many of the storylines revolve around the fact that Tom and Linda find Jez sexually attractive and (particularly Linda) despise the oblivious Suze. Another recurring character is Sugar Walls (Elaine Lordan), Linda&#x27;s celebrity sister. Many of the other characters can be just as hapless as Tom and Linda; Beryl still engages in sexual activities such as S&amp;M and picking up young and married men, while Jez and Suze generally lack common sense. For example, they once cancelled their holiday to the Algarve and paid £500 to stay in their own back garden after Linda opened it up as a campsite.

On at least one occasion the fourth wall is broken when a previous series was referenced by Linda.

At the end of series three, Tom finally got his big break in TV soap opera &quot;Crossroads&quot;. The last episode ended with Tom leaving the flat and Linda taking off her hair (revealing it to be a wig) and sitting in the flat alone.

==Characters==
===Regular===
Linda La Hughes (Kathy Burke) – Linda is portrayed as an unattractive middle-aged woman who usually wears skin tight, colourful clothing. Linda grabs any opportunity to bluntly flirt with any man she sees. She is delusional about her appearance. Her age is uncertain as she has announced different ages through the three series.

Thomas Thessalonius &quot;Tom&quot; Farrell (James Dreyfus) – Tom is a 30-year-old wannabe (but bad) actor who has only had small roles on TV and on stage. Tom is openly gay and seizes every possible opportunity to get a boyfriend.

Beryl Merit (Rosalind Knight) – Beryl is the elderly landlady of 69 Paradise Passage. She is a retired prostitute but stays involved in criminal activities such as shoplifting and bootlegging.

Jez Littlewood (Brian Bovell) – Jez is Tom and Linda&#x27;s hunky middle-class neighbour.

Suze Littlewood (Beth Goddard) – Suze is Jez&#x27;s ditzy wife. She can sometimes be nice but on other occasions she can be hyperactive and rather irritating, unintentionally coming off as a burden. Tom and Linda loathe Suze for standing in the way of their pursuit of Jez. 

===Recurring===
Norma (Doña Croll) – Tom&#x27;s agent who features in every series.

Sharon Hughes/Sugar Walls (Elaine Lordan) is Linda&#x27;s famous sister. She is a model, but is more famous for her promiscuity than her modelling career. She appears in series 1 and returns in series 2.

Simon Shepherd is Tom&#x27;s celebrity crush. Simon is famous for starring in &quot;Peak Practice&quot;. He appears in every series.

<doc id="1019648" wikidata="Q2566718" url="?curid=1019648" title="Ringaskiddy">
<text>Ringaskiddy () is a village in County Cork, Ireland. It is located on the western side of Cork Harbour, south of Cobh, and is from Cork city, to which it is connected by the N28 road. The village is a port with passenger ferry, with two bi-weekly sailings to Roscoff in France. A ferry service to Swansea in Wales closed in 2012.

During the 20th century, Ringaskiddy changed from a fishing village to a centre of transport and industrial activity. It is now one of the largest employment hubs in the pharmaceuticals sector in the region. The village is close to a number of tourist areas, including Crosshaven, Curraghbinny and Monkstown. A motorway project, to connect Cork city with Ringaskiddy, was given the &quot;green light&quot; by the supreme court in March 2021.

==Places of interest==

Barnahely Castle, later known as Warren&#x27;s Castle, is located near Ringaskiddy. Originally the site of an Anglo-Norman castle, a new fortification was built here during the 15th or 16th century. In 1796, the site was bought and a mansion house (incorporating the remnants of the earlier castle) was built by the Warren family. The remaining ruins of the castle include a rectangular bawn.

A Martello tower sits on a hilltop at Ringaskiddy, and is one of several other forts and towers designed to protect Cork Harbour. It is accessed via the Loughbeg road and overlooks the harbour.

There are two beaches near Ringaskiddy: Lough beach (also known locally as Luc beach) and Gobby beach. Lough beach, a sandy beach with shallow water, is served by an access path and seasonal toilet facilities. Gobby beach is a rocky beach with direct views over Spike Island.

In mid-2020, a Ringaskiddy Tidy Towns group was set up.

==Economy==
===Industry===
Ringaskiddy is an important industrial centre, particularly for pharmaceutical companies such as Centocor, GlaxoSmithKline, Hovione, Novartis, Pfizer, and Recordati. Most of the world&#x27;s supply of the erection-treatment drug Viagra is manufactured there. As of 2021, more than 3,800 people were reportedly employed in the Ringaskiddy area.

The Port of Cork facilities at Ringaskiddy handle much of the vehicle imports for the southern part of Ireland, with 34,000 trade vehicles imported through Cork in 2017.

===Incinerator proposal===
An application to build a domestic waste incinerator in Ringaskiddy was rejected by An Bord Pleanála in 2011. The incinerator&#x27;s proposed owners, Indaver Ireland, said the facility would relieve pressure on landfill, while locals and environmentalists feared the incinerator would impact on public health and the environment in the area. Indaver Ireland said that they had not abandoned their plans, and in 2018 were granted planning permission for the plant. However, this decision was subject to a legal challenge and, as of 2021, the High Court was due to rule on whether An Bord Pleanála could reconsider its permission decision, or if the entire planning process had to be restarted.

==Amenities==

Amenities in Ringaskiddy, and nearby Shanbally, include a church, primary school, shop, preschool and community centre. The local Gaelic Athletic Association club is Shanbally GAA. Ringaskiddy also has a bar/restaurant (the Ferry Boat Inn).

The National Maritime College of Ireland was officially opened in Ringaskiddy in 2006, and has drawn a student population to the village. The college provides the only training in Ireland of Merchant Navy personnel, and the Irish Naval Service also carry out their non-military training there. The Irish Naval Service base at Haulbowline is 3 kilometres (2 miles) from Ringaskiddy on the L2545 local road.

<doc id="1019649" wikidata="Q7715329" url="?curid=1019649" title="The Bagford Ballads">
<text>The Bagford Ballads were English ballads collected by John Bagford (1651 - 1716) for Robert Harley, first Earl of Oxford. Bagford was originally a cobbler, but he became a book collector in his later years, and he assembled this set of ballads from the materials he had been collecting. Harley was interested in all sorts of antiquarian literature, and the Harleian collection is a major contribution to scholarship.

The Bagford Ballads are generally folk compositions that document the last years of the Stuart reign in the close of the 17th century (a subject that was not remote for Harley). Therefore, in contrast to what Thomas Percy would collect, these ballads were not primarily antiquarian or efforts at preserving a vanished literature. Rather, they seem to have been selected for their value as genuine folk art and populist ephemera.

After Harley&#x27;s death, the Bagford Ballads were obtained by the Duke of Roxburge. They were published by the Ballad Society in 1878, edited by Joseph Woodfall Ebsworth.

<doc id="1019650" wikidata="Q7062" url="?curid=1019650" title="Monheim am Rhein">
<text>Monheim am Rhein () is a town on the right (eastern) bank of the river Rhine in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Monheim belongs to the district of Mettmann – with the southern suburbs of Düsseldorf to the north, and the Bergisches Land to the south. It consists of the city districts (from north to south) Baumberg (about one third) and Monheim (two thirds).

==Adjacent cities and districts==
The following cities and districts border Monheim am Rhein:
to the north Düsseldorf, to the east Langenfeld (also part of the district of Mettmann), to the south Leverkusen and (both divided by the river Rhine) Cologne to the southwest, and Dormagen to the west (part of the district of Neuss).

==History==

Monheim has approximately 850 years of recorded history. It was first documented in 1150 as a fishermen&#x27;s village in the (Earldom) Berg. It became the administrative centre for the surrounding villages (including many of the villages that now form Düsseldorf) in 1363, and stayed in that position until Napoleon formed the Rhine Confederation in 1806. Monheim, Baumberg and Hitdorf were then combined into a municipal corporation. Monheim gained city status in 1960, ten years after it finally incorporated the neighbouring villages Baumberg and Hitdorf. At the end of 1974 Monheim was incorporated by Düsseldorf as part of a major municipal corporation reform. After a successful complaint in the federal state&#x27;s constitutional court in Münster, the city became independent again on 1 July 1976, but lost Hitdorf to Leverkusen. Since 1994 the official city name has been &quot;Monheim am Rhein&quot;.

==Sites of interest==

* Schelmenturm – The 26m-high (85 ft) landmark of Monheim is a tower from the early 15th century, which was part of the former fortification built by the Earls of Berg. Since 1972, the tower has been reorganised, also being used as a cultural meeting place.
* Deusserhaus – The Deusser manor house, built around 1848, today is the museum of the &quot;Heimatbund&quot; (local history society) &quot;Monheim e.V.&quot;
*Haus Bürgel – This house is located on the border between Baumberg and Düsseldorf in a landscape conservation area called &quot;Urdenbacher Kämpe&quot;, a flood plain of the Rhine. The earliest source from 1019 states that the &quot;Castrum in Burgela&quot; was built in the 4th century as part of the Roman defences against the Franks on the left bank of the Rhine. In the 14th century, the broadly meandering river changed its bed after a flood, so that &quot;Haus Bürgel&quot; is actually on the right bank of the Rhine today. Some remains of the Roman walls are still visible, although the place was transformed into a larger Frankish manor house. In recent years, it has been used as a museum and biological-environmental research and information station.
* Gänselieselbrunnen – The fountain known locally as Gänselieselbrunnen is located next to the town hall of Monheim am Rhein.
* Friedenskirche - The Friedenskirche (Peace Church) is a Protestant church in Monheim-Baumberg, built from 1968 to 1974 according to the plans of Walter Maria Foerderer and an outstanding example of Brutalism in the Rhineland.

* Franz Boehm Memorial - The Catholic priest Franz Boehm, who became a parish priest in St. Gereon in 1938, was a resistance fighter against the Nazi regime who died in 1945 in the Dachau concentration camp. A life-size bronze bust was erected in his honor in 2020 to mark his 140th birthday. Behind the life-size bust are two panes, each measuring 4.2 meters by 2.25 meters, which was designed by Thomas Kesseler using the silkscreen technique.

==Transport==
Monheim is part of both of the public transport associations Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (VRR) and the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Sieg (VRS), situated on their borders. There are several bus lines running between the city districts, neighbouring towns, and the closest S-Bahn railway stations on the border with Langenfeld, Langenfeld-Berghausen station and Langenfeld (Rheinland) station, as well as Düsseldorf. The Monheim ticket has enabled citizens of Monheim to use public transport free of charge within Monheim am Rhein and the neighbouring town Langenfeld (VRR tariff zone 73) as well as to the near train station in Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf-Hellerhof station since 1 April 2020. This was prolonged by the town council until 31 March 2025.

Many of Monheim&#x27;s residents are commuters to nearby Düsseldorf (20 minutes) and Cologne (30 minutes).
The A59 is connected to Monheim which connects to the nearby A46, as is the A542 which connects with the nearby A3 and A1.

The town is in the vicinity of both Düsseldorf Airport and the Cologne Bonn Airport.
==Music==
The band Godspeed You! Black Emperor would use the name of the town As a title for the first section of the song sleep off their second studio album Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Monheim am Rhein is twinned with:

* Wiener Neustadt, Austria (1971)
* Tirat Carmel, Israel (1989)
* Delitzsch, Germany (1990)
* Bourg-la-Reine, France (2000)
* Malbork, Poland (2005)
* Ataşehir, Turkey (2015)

<doc id="1019653" wikidata="Q2279663" url="?curid=1019653" title="Roosky">
<text>Roosky, Ruskey, or Rooskey () is a village on the River Shannon in the northern midlands of Ireland, near the point where counties Leitrim, Longford, and Roscommon meet. The N4 road from Dublin to Sligo passes by the Leitrim side of the village.

== History ==
In 1798 the local rebels defeated the army of General Lake on the shores of Lough Bofin as part of the 1798 rebellion. There was also a &#x27;Pleasure House&#x27; on the shores of the same lake, including a man-made beach only accessible to people from the Anglo-Irish Protestant class, which was later burned down. The Protestant church, in the centre of the village, was also attacked at this time.

Roosky was a lively market village in the mid 20th Century. The bridge was the scene of conflict during the Irish Civil War in 1922 and was also an important focal point for the National Farmers Association strike in 1967.

The portion of the village in County Leitrim was formerly known as Georgia or Gorteenoran () and constituted 5 houses and three licensed premises in 1925. This name is not in use today.

== Facilities ==
Our Lady of Mount Carmel, the Roman Catholic church built in 1844, holds regular masses.The village has a supermarket, a Chinese restaurant, a Garda Station and a number of pubs. The community centre is located on the site of the old primary school. 

== Culture ==
The Shannon Key West Hotel was an entertainment venue in the village, until it went into liquidation, closing its doors on 18 October 2011. Every year, the village holds the &#x27;Rooskey Heritage Festival,&#x27; usually in July.
== Tourism ==
Roosky is a destination for anglers, as the River Shannon and the nearby loughs are well stocked with coarse fish including roach, perch and bream. The harbour and marina are especially busy in the summer, with cruise vessels regularly stopping here.

The Rooskey Heritage Festival is also held annually in the village. This community festival includes live music and heritage displays and promotes Rooskey village as a tourist destination. There are also art exhibitions, watersport displays and markets. Proceeds raised by the festival go towards the next year&#x27;s festival and community projects which have included commissioning a wooden sculpture for the village, promoting the village&#x27;s rich history by using plaques near points of interest and organising events all year celebrating heritage.

Outdoor activities that take place locally include watersports, horse-riding, pony-trekking and walking.

== Education ==
The village is served by the local primary school, Our Lady of Mount Carmel N.S., which was opened in 1997. An afterschool was built on the school grounds in the late 2010&#x27;s and early 2020&#x27;s at the back of the school.

== Industry ==
On 8 May 2002, a fire destroyed much of the premises of the Glanbia pork processing plant. Furthermore, the following year it was announced that the plant would not be rebuilt. On the Leitrim side of the village, there is also a test tube making factory.

==Rail access==
The nearest railway station is located on the County Leitrim side of the River Shannon at Dromod which is on the Dublin–Sligo railway line.

== Sport ==
Roosky is represented in GAA and soccer by Kilglass Gaels and Dynamo Rooskey, respectively.

There are three 18-hole golf courses in the area.

== People ==
*Albert Reynolds, politician and 9th Taoiseach of Ireland, born in Roosky.
* John Bannon (1829–1913), Jesuit priest
* John Waters (born 1955) columnist and author

<text>Rosscarbery () is a village and census town in County Cork, Ireland. The village is on a shallow estuary, which opens onto Rosscarbery Bay. Rosscarbery is in the Cork South-West (Dáil Éireann) constituency, which has three seats.

==History==
The area has been inhabited since at least the Neolithic period, as evidenced by several Neolithic sites such as portal dolmens. The area is also home to a number of Bronze Age remains, including a number of stone circles and ring forts. There are two inscribed stones in Burgatia, and several (later) holy wells nearby.

Rosscarbery was home to the School of Ross, a major centre of learning, at one time being a university town, and one of the major cities in Europe, around the 6th century. Due to its popularity as a centre of pilgrimage it was also known as &quot;Ros Ailithir (&quot;Wood of the Pilgrims&quot;)&quot;. The hereditary chieftains of the area, or tuath, were the O&#x27;Learys, known as Uí Laoghaire Ruis Ó gCairbre, until it passed to Norman control in the early thirteenth century. The entire region had belonged to the ancient Corcu Loígde, of whom the O&#x27;Learys were one of the leading septs.

In March 1921, during the Irish War of Independence, Tom Barry&#x27;s 3rd Cork (IRA) Brigade attacked and destroyed the Royal Irish Constabulary barracks in Rosscarbery. Two RIC officers were killed in the attack, and nine others were injured. There is a plaque on the site of the former barracks, beside the current Garda station, commemorating the event.

==Demographics==
In the 20 years between the 1991 and 2011 census, the population of Rosscarbery grew by approximately 17%, from 455 to 534 people. As of the 2016 census, the population was 490.

As a tourist area, there are a number of holiday homes around Rosscarbery, which results in an annual swell in population during summer months.

==Religion==

The Church of Ireland&#x27;s dioceses of Cork, Cloyne and Ross were effectively merged during rationalisation in the 1860s. The bishop of this tridiocese, Paul Colton, is based in Cork.

There is a cathedral in Rosscarbery, an unusual feature for what is now a relatively small settlement. It is a Church of Ireland cathedral - St. Fachtna&#x27;s Cathedral. St Fachtna&#x27;s is the smallest cathedral in Ireland, and is the size of a typical parish church.

The Catholic church, in the diocese of Cork and Ross, is also called St. Fachtna&#x27;s and dates from 1820.

==Places of interest==
===Square===
An annual horse fair is held in Rosscarbery&#x27;s square every year in August.

===Beaches===
Rosscarbery is a tourist destination in the summertime, being in proximity to at least three beaches. The nearest of these, the &quot;Warren Beach&quot;, is about a mile from the village, and is designated a blue flag beach, along with the nearby Owenahincha beach. Extensive coastal erosion at Warren Beach resulted in remedial works being undertaken throughout 2004 and 2005. Rosscarbery Pitch &amp; Putt Club is located at the beach.

===Estuary===
Rosscarbery has a tidal estuary and mudflat on the south side of the main road and causeway (N71) and a large brackish lagoon on the north side. At the west end of the causeway, south of the main road is a small lagoon with reed beds.

===Antiquities===
Bohonagh is a recumbent stone circle located 2.4 km east of Rosscarbery. It dates to the Bronze Age and a boulder-burial is located nearby.

Castle Salem is also near the village, and was the home to the Morris family from around 1660 until the early 1800s. The castle is now a guest house and run by the family who bought the castle in 1895.

==Transport==

Rosscarbery is on the N71 road that runs through counties Cork and Kerry. The nearest town is Clonakilty ( to the north-east).Cork city is to the north-east.

There are bus routes serving Rosscarbery that operate along the N71.

The nearest airport is Cork Airport.

==Sport==
The local Gaelic Athletic Association club is Carbery Rangers, founded in 1887. In November 2003, Carbery Rangers won their first ever football County Junior A title, and subsequently a Junior Munster, Intermediate County, Munster, and All-Ireland titles. The club has since graduated to the senior ranks.

Rosscarbery Rowing Club competes at regattas in West Cork and at the Irish Coastal Rowing Federation Championships each August.

<doc id="1019659" wikidata="Q2118312" url="?curid=1019659" title="Aleksander Jabłoński">
<text>Aleksander Jabłoński (born 26 February 1898 in Woskresenówka, in Imperial Russia; died 9 September 1980 in Skierniewice, Poland) was a Polish physicist and member of the Polish Academy of Sciences. His research was in molecular spectroscopy and photophysics.

==Life and career==
He was born on 26 February 1898 in Woskresenówka near Kharkiv in Imperial Russia. He attended &quot;Gymnasium&quot; high school in Kharkiv as well as a music school where he learned to play the violin under supervision of Konstanty Gorski. In 1916, he started to study physics at the University of Kharkiv.

During the World War I he served in the Polish I Corps in Russia. After the war he settled in Warsaw in 1918. In 1919–1920 he fought for Poland against aggression by Soviet Russia (and was consequently decorated with the Polish Cross of Valour).

Jabłoński initially studied the violin at Warsaw Conservatory, under the virtuoso Stanisław Barcewicz, but later switched to science.

He received a Ph.D. from the University of Warsaw in 1930, writing a thesis &quot;On the influence of the change of the wavelength of excitation light on the fluorescence spectra&quot;. He then went to Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Berlin, Germany for two years (1930–31) as a fellow of the Rockefeller Foundation. He worked with Peter Pringsheim at the FWU and later with Otto Stern in Hamburg. In 1934 Jabłoński returned to Poland to receive habilitation from the University of Warsaw. His thesis was &quot;On the influence of intermolecular interactions on the absorption and emission of light&quot;, the subject to which he would devote the rest of his life. He served as president of the Polish Physical Society between 1957 and 1961.

Jabłoński was a pioneer of molecular photophysics, creating the concept of the &quot;luminescent centre&quot; and his own theories of concentrational quenching and depolarization of photoluminescence. He also worked on pressure broadening of emission spectra lines and was the first to recognize the analogy between pressure broadening and molecular spectra. This led to development of the quantum-mechanical pressure broadening theory.

Fluorescence is illustrated schematically with the classical Jablonski diagram, first proposed by Jabłoński in 1933 to describe absorption and emission of light.

In 1946, he settled in Toruń where he was appointed Head of the Faculty of Physics at the Nicolaus Copernicus University.

==Awards and honours==
*Cross of Valour (1920)
*Fellow of the Rockefeller Foundation (1930–31)
*Golden Cross of Merit (1951)

<text>Dallas Theological Seminary (DTS) is an evangelical theological seminary in Dallas, Texas. It is known for popularizing the theological system of dispensationalism. DTS has campuses in Dallas, Houston, and Washington, D.C., as well as extension sites in Atlanta, Austin, San Antonio, Nashville, Northwest Arkansas, Europe, and Guatemala, and a multilingual online education program. DTS is the largest non-denominational seminary accredited by the Association of Theological Schools.

==History==
DTS was founded as Evangelical Theological College in 1924 by Rollin T. Chafer and his brother, Lewis Sperry Chafer, who taught the first class of thirteen students, and William Henry Griffith Thomas, who was to have been the school&#x27;s first theology professor but died before the first classes began. Their vision was a school where expository Bible preaching was taught simply, and under Chafers&#x27; leadership, DTS pioneered one of the first four-year degrees in theology, the Master of Theology (Th.M.). The present location of the school was purchased in 1926, and the Doctor of Theology (Th.D.) program was started in 1927. Chafer remained president until his death in 1952.

The seminary had a considerable influence in the fundamentalist movement by training students who established various Bible Colleges and independent fundamentalist churches in the southern United States.

DTS has continually published a quarterly entitled &quot;Bibliotheca Sacra&quot; initially edited by Rollin T. Chafer since 1934. In 1983, a complete collection of articles was published as a book commemorating fifty years 
of the journal.

John F. Walvoord took over as president in 1952 after Chafer&#x27;s death in 1952. In 1974, DTS added a two-year Master of Arts (MA) program in biblical studies, and in 1982, a two-year program in Christian Education was begun. In addition to these, a Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.) program was opened in 1980. Walvoord retired as DTS president in 1986.

From 1986 to 1994, Donald K. Campbell served as president of DTS. During his tenure, DTS opened a three-year MA program in Biblical Counseling and a two-year MA program in Biblical exegesis and linguistics.

Chuck Swindoll served as president of the seminary from 1994 to 2001. Mark Bailey followed, serving as president from 2001 to 2020. Under Bailey&#x27;s tenure, the seminary added a two-year MA program in media and communication, a two-year MA in Christian leadership, a Spanish D.Min. program, and a multi-lingual online education program. He was succeeded by Mark Yarbrough in 2020.

As of Spring 2014, DTS had over 15,000 alumni serving in various ministerial capacities in 97 countries worldwide.

==Accreditation==
DTS was first accredited in 1944 by the Board of Regents, State Education Department of the University of the State of New York of Albany. After that institution stopped accrediting institutions outside of New York, DTS was accredited in 1969 by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and in 1994 by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada.

The school is also a member of the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI), the Evangelical Training Association (ETA), the Jerusalem University College, and the Institute of Theological Studies (ITS).

==Theology==

DTS is known as a center of modern dispensational teaching due to Dr. Chafer&#x27;s development of a systematic theology which approaches the Bible with a &quot;premillennial, dispensational interpretation of the Scriptures.&quot; &quot;Systematic Theology&quot;, his eight-volume work describing this approach, was first published in 1948 and is still a required textbook for some courses at DTS.

Notable theological beliefs of the school include: premillennialism, dispensationalism, and Biblical inerrancy. The school considers itself non-denominational within Protestantism, and offers classes in all 66 books of the Protestant Bible.

== Notable people ==
In a 2009 study conducted by LifeWay Research, Protestant pastors named preachers who had most influenced them. Three DTS alumni were among the top ten: Chuck Swindoll (&#x27;63), founder of radio broadcast Insight for Living; David Jeremiah (&#x27;67), founder of Turning Point Radio and Television Ministries; and Andy Stanley (&#x27;85), founder of North Point Ministries.

<doc id="1019670" wikidata="Q2566224" url="?curid=1019670" title="Schull">
<text>Schull or Skull ( ; or &quot;Scoil Mhuire&quot;, meaning &quot;Mary&#x27;s School&quot;) is a town on the south-west coast of County Cork in Ireland.

Located on the southwest coast of Ireland in the municipal district of West Cork, the town is dominated by Mount Gabriel (407 m). It has a sheltered harbour, used for recreational boating. The area, on the peninsula leading to Mizen Head, is a tourist destination, and there are numerous holiday homes along the adjoining coast. Schull had a population of 669 in 2022. The town&#x27;s secondary school, Schull Community College, houses one of the only planetariums in Ireland, along with a sailing school. Each year Schull harbour hosts the Fastnet International Schools Regatta.

==Name==
The first recorded place name for this area is &quot;scol&quot;, from a Decretal Letter of Pope Innocent III in 1199 to the bishop of Cork confirming the rights of the bishop of Cork. Both Skull and Skul are used in the Down Survey of 1656–58. Skull is also used in the Grand Jury Map surveyed in the 1790s and published 1811.

The Placenames (County Cork) Order of 2012 lists &quot;An Scoil&quot; as the Irish name for the village, in which &quot;Scoil&quot; is translated from &quot;school&quot;. This is attributed by some to a school which was ostensibly located in the area.

However, others question this derivation, and Gary Dempsey&#x27;s thesis (&quot;Whispered in the Landscape/Written on the Street, A Study of Placename Policy and Conflict in Ireland from 1946 to 2010&quot;) suggests that the &quot;Scoil Mhuire&quot; form dates to 1893 when the parish priest of Schull at the time, Very Rev. John O&#x27;Connor (P.P. Schull 1888–1911), who &quot;fancied himself as a historian, misread a Latin sentence as referring to a &#x27;College of St. Mary&#x27; in Skull; in fact, the text referred to a collegiate church in Waterford but the PP had set the ball rolling&quot;.

==History==
Evidence of ancient settlement in the area includes a number of ringfort, rock art and fulacht fiadh sites in the townlands of Skull, Caherlusky, Cooradarrigan and Gubbeen. The megalithic Altar Wedge Tomb lies to the west of the town. The tomb, which is estimated to have been built between 3000 and 2000 BC, was used as a Mass rock in the 18th century. Settlement in Schull itself dates to at least the 12th century,

In the early 17th century, the townland of Leamcon was a pirate stronghold, at a time when pirates traded in nearby Baltimore and Whiddy Island. Between the 17th and 18th centuries, the center of the town may have shifted somewhat, from the now ruined medieval church, towards the modern main road. The now ruined church that stands in the graveyard in Schull was first referenced, alongside the town, in a letter to the Bishop of Cork from Pope Innocent III in 1199. The medieval church itself was largely rebuilt in 18th century, but later fell into ruin when the Holy Trinity church, closer to today&#x27;s town centre, was built.

The workhouse, which still stands in Schull, was home to around 600 inmates during the Great Famine. During this period, in the mid-19th century, the graveyard near the workhouse doubled in size.

By the late 19th century, businesses in Schull (including banks, pubs and an inn) served the surrounding area. In 1889, a stick barometer was gifted to the people of Schull by representatives of the London Meteorological Office who gave a series of lectures on barometers to fishermen and sailors. The barometer is now on display next to the local An Post office.

==Demographics==
As of the 2022 census, the town of Schull had a usual resident population of 627. Of these, 75.2% were White Irish, 0.5% were White Irish Travellers, 17.1% were Other White ethnicities, 0.5% were Black or Black Irish, 1.8% were Asian or Asian Irish, 1.9% were of other ethnicities, and 3.2% did not state their ethnicity. 75.4% of the usual residents were born in the Republic of Ireland, 12.6% in the United Kingdom, 5.9% in the rest of the world, 5.1% in other EU countries excluding Ireland and Poland, 0.6% in Poland and 0.3% in India.

==Transport==
Schull once had its own railway station, which was the western terminus of the Schull and Skibbereen Railway, a steam-operated narrow gauge railway. Schull railway station opened on 6 September 1886, closed for passenger and goods traffic on 27 January 1947, and finally closed altogether on 1 June 1953.

The main bus route is Bus Éireann&#x27;s number 237 to/from Cork City, though only some services reach Schull. Also, on occasional days there are buses to/from other towns/villages in the local area.

There is a ferry service between Schull and Cape Clear Island.

== Amenities ==
Schull&#x27;s Garda station is located on the main road into the town (R592). Schull&#x27;s fire station was inaugurated on 1 March 1984.

There is also a Coast Guard station, which was established in the 19th century, and has since been replaced by holiday homes called the Coast Guard Cottages. Schull&#x27;s second Coast Guard station was renovated into a Garda station in the early 2000s. Since then, a new Coast Guard station has been built by the Garda station.

There is also a tourist office, medical centre and community hospital.

A planetarium, which is one of the only planetariums in Ireland, is located and operated from Schull Community College.

== In literature ==
The book &quot;Silver River&quot; (2007) by Daisy Goodwin includes a section on the efforts of her 3x great-grandfather, the Rector of Skull, to help the populace during the Great Famine.

==Events==
The Schull Show, an agriculture show, takes place in late July in Schull Town Park. The Schull Regatta, which started in 1884, was &quot;re-vamped&quot; in 2014.  Taking place over a weekend, usually in early August, markets stalls are typically set-up around Schull Harbour Pier. The weekend is centered around the rowing and sailing races, but also has food and shop stalls, carnival games, bouncy castles, music events and other activities.

<doc id="1019671" wikidata="Q1320312" url="?curid=1019671" title="Samsung Tower Palace 3 – Tower G">
<text>Tower G, or simply Tower Palace Three, is a 73-floor luxury residential skyscraper in Seoul, South Korea. The structure was originally designed to be 93 stories high, but was later scaled down due to zoning rights imposed by city regulations. A notable feature of this structure is the implementation of the Y-shaped tripartite floor geometry which maximizes views and floor space. This innovation pioneered the way for the development of the buttressed core, which is used in the floor plan of the Burj Khalifa as a result of its potential application in megatall skyscrapers. It was the tallest building in the country in 2004 but was surpassed in height by the Northeast Asia Trade Tower in Incheon when it was topped out in 2009. It was designed by United States–based architectural firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.

The building is high. Its shape is formed by three oval lobes joined together. It is the eighth-tallest all-residential building in the world.

<doc id="1019672" wikidata="Q3008290" url="?curid=1019672" title="The Pendragon Cycle">
<text>The Pendragon Cycle is a series of historical fantasy books based on Arthurian legend, written by Stephen R. Lawhead. The cycle was originally planned as a four-book series, but the original publisher opted to stop after the first three books, resulting in an abrupt ending to &quot;Arthur&quot; and the existence of many unexplored stories and plotlines. The first three books were thus originally called &quot;The Pendragon Trilogy&quot;. Lawhead moved to a new publisher a few years later. It was decided to expand on the trilogy by finishing the series, and two additional books were planned. These books, &quot;Pendragon&quot; and &quot;Grail&quot;, are set in between events covered in &quot;Arthur&quot;. Lawhead later wrote a final book &quot;Avalon&quot;, which is not considered to be a true addition to the cycle but rather a &quot;related semi-sequel&quot; to round out the &quot;Once and Future King&quot; aspect of the legend. The film and television rights to the series were purchased by DailyWire+ in November 2022.

A seventh book, Aurelia, was published in January of 2025.

The series is a work of fiction that takes place in the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries and attempts to present the Arthurian legends in a historical setting while presenting the story with a reality the reader can connect with. Lawhead bases his stories on the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, the &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; and other works of Geoffrey of Monmouth, the writings of Taliesin, Gildas, and Nennius, and several other legends that he manages to interweave into the Arthurian legend.

The books, with the exception of &quot;Taliesin&quot; and &quot;Avalon&quot;, are narrated in the first-person, and, except for &quot;Pendragon&quot;, &quot;Grail&quot;, and &quot;Avalon&quot;, are each split into three sections (&quot;Pendragon&quot; has four, &quot;Grail&quot; one, and &quot;Avalon&quot; five). &quot;Merlin&quot; and &quot;Pendragon&quot; are narrated by Myrddin (Merlin). The first third of &quot;Arthur&quot; is narrated by Pelleas, the second by Bedwyr (Bedivere), and the third by Aneirin/Gildas. &quot;Grail&quot; is mostly narrated by Gwalchavad (Galahad), with a short narration by Morgian (Morgan le Fay) at the beginning of most chapters. &quot;Taliesin&quot; follows Taliesin and Charis (the Lady of the Lake), alternating in each chapter; &quot;Avalon&quot; mostly follows James Stuart (the reborn Arthur), Merlin, and the fictional Prime Minister Thomas Waring.

The series proceeds as told in the following descriptions:

=== &quot;Taliesin&quot; ===
Tells simultaneously the story of the fall of Atlantis, the subsequent travel of Princess Charis and her family to Ynys Prydein (Britain), and the discovery and training of Taliesin as a druid/bard. The two eventually meet and marry, and Myrddin (Merlin) is born just weeks before a tragedy brought about by Charis&#x27; jealous half-sister, Morgian.

=== &quot;Merlin&quot; ===
Narrated by Myrddin. Tells of Myrddin&#x27;s dual upbringing among the druids and Christian priests, his capture and mystical training among the Hill Folk, and his brief time as a king of Dyfed. He experiences a doomed romance with Princess Ganieda and long years of madness as a wild man of the woods before finding his destiny.

=== &quot;Arthur&quot; ===
Narrated by Pelleas (first third), Bedwyr (second third), and Aneirin (last third). Tells of Arthur and Myrddin&#x27;s attempt to create the paradisaical &quot;Kingdom of Summer&quot;. Arthur is made Duke and Battlechief of Britain after drawing the Excalibur from a stone, but must fight back the Saecsens and other barbarian invaders and unite the peoples of Britain before he can be accepted as High King.

=== &quot;Pendragon&quot; ===
Narrated by Myrddin. Tells of an invasion of Ireland and Britain by the Vandal army of Twrch Trwyth, the Black Boar, and a subsequent plague that sweeps across Britain, threatening Arthur&#x27;s Kingdom of Summer while it is still newborn.

=== &quot;Grail&quot; ===
Narrated by Gwalchavad (majority) and Morgian (short narration at each chapter&#x27;s beginning). Tells of Arthur building a shrine to house the Holy Grail and how the beautiful and mysterious Morgaws joins his court. When treachery follows, Arthur&#x27;s warriors brave the Wasteland of Lyonesse to retrieve the sacred relic.

=== &quot;Avalon: The Return of King Arthur&quot; ===
In Portugal, the reprobate King Edward the Ninth has died by his own hand. In England, the British monarchy teeters on the edge of total destruction.

And in the Scottish Highlands, a mystical emissary named Mr. Embries—better known as &quot;Merlin&quot;—informs a young captain that he is next in line to the throne. James Arthur Stuart is not the commoner he has always believed himself to be; he is Arthur, the legendary King of Summer, reborn. The road to England&#x27;s salvation is dangerous, however, and powerful enemies wait in ambush. Arthur is not the only one who has returned from the mists of legend, and Merlin&#x27;s magic is not the only sorcery that has survived the centuries.

== Characters ==
Many historical personas (some already included in the Arthurian legend) exist in the cycle, alongside less &quot;factual&quot; characters: Taliesin, Magnus Maximus, Theodosius, Ambrosius Aurelianus, Vortigern, Constantine III, Myrddin Wyllt, Clovis I, Gwyddno Garanhir, Elffin ap Gwyddno, Horsa, Hengest, Cerdic, Aelle, Gildas, and Aneirin (in the series, it is revealed that the last two are the same person; born with the name Aneirin, he changes it to Gildas after Arthur&#x27;s death).

==Television series== 
In November 2022, &quot;The Daily Wire&quot; announced its intention to produce an adaptation of the series.

In July 2023, it was announced that &quot;The Daily Wire&quot; Co-CEO Jeremy Boreing would be taking a leave of absence from the company, to co-direct the seven-episode television series. Additionally, it was revealed that the series would outsource its filming and production abroad, namely Italy and Hungary, and would premiere on &quot;DailyWire+&quot; in 2025. In September, British actor Tom Sharp was announced to have been in the series&#x27; lead role as Merlin, as filming began in Europe. Later that month, the series&#x27; main cast was revealed, which includes Brett Cooper as Ganieda, Rose Reid as Charis and James Arden as Taliesin.

<text>Shanagarry () is a village in east County Cork in Ireland. The village is located near Ireland&#x27;s south coast, approximately east of Cork, on the R632 regional road.

Shanagarry is known for the Ballymaloe Cookery School, in the home and gardens of celebrity chef Darina Allen. Also resident here is Darina&#x27;s daughter-in-law and chef Rachel Allen.

Shanagarry Castle passed to the family of William Penn in the 1660s; it was his occasional residence before he left for Pennsylvania and started his Holy Experiment. Also to be found in Shanagarry is the historic Old Road, an ancient Irish causeway and home to the original residents of the village.

Shanagarry is also the home village of the Russell Rovers hurling and football teams. The teams are made up of people from Shanagarry, Ballycotton and Churchtown South.

==Surrounding area==
About from Shanagarry, just off the road to Ballycotton, lies Ballynamona beach. The coastline at Shanagarry and Ballynamona forms part of the Ballycotton Bay Special Protection Area (SPA) and is home to herons, oystercatchers and cormorants.

<text>Sylwester Kaliski (19 December 1925 – 16 September 1978) was a Polish engineer, professor and military general. He was a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN).

Born in Toruń, Kaliski was a specialist in the field of applied physics. He developed the theory of continuous amplification of ultra and hyper-sounds in semiconductive crystals and obtained plasma temperature of tens of millions of kelvins using laser impulse. He died in Warsaw, Poland in car crash. It has been speculated that Kaliski was killed by the Soviet KGB, as he headed the Polish clandestine program of developing thermonuclear devices intended for military use. The program began on orders from the highest levels of Polish communists and was reportedly opposed by the Soviet Union. He was honored with an entry in the &quot;Honorary Book of Soldierly Deeds&quot; in 1973.

<doc id="1019679" wikidata="Q2707869" url="?curid=1019679" title="Sheep's Head">
<text>Sheep&#x27;s Head, also known as Muntervary (), is the headland at the end of the Sheep&#x27;s Head peninsula situated between Bantry Bay and Dunmanus Bay in County Cork, Ireland.

The peninsula is popular with walkers, and the Sheep&#x27;s Head Way is an 88 km long-distance trail which follows old tracks and roads around the peninsula from Bantry to the headland and back. The trail is very accessible and is well signposted (see image on right). The route combines low and rugged hills with coastline and cliffs.

The walkway is straightforward and can be walked during any time between April and October. The trail is divided into eight stages—each representing a half-day&#x27;s walking. Among those responsible for establishing the Sheep&#x27;s Head Way were Tom Whitty, an American, local farmer James O’Mahony, and Jim Leonard.

The Sheep&#x27;s Head Way network of trails includes 20 looped walks, and extends eastwards to include Kealkill, Drimoleague and Gougane Barra where it intersects with the Beara-Breifne Way. The Lighthouse Loop reaches all the way to the Sheep&#x27;s Head Lighthouse situated at the far west end of the peninsula.

A Sheep&#x27;s Head Way cycle trail also exists, and begins in Ballylickey, County Cork. It extends around the coastline of the Sheep&#x27;s Head peninsula, and ends in Ballydehob.

The peninsula has three villages, Durrus (six miles from Bantry), Ahakista (twelve miles from Bantry), and Kilcrohane (sixteen miles from Bantry). Durrus has been identified as one of the key staging posts on the Wild Atlantic Way driving route along the Irish coastline and is the home to Durrus Cheese.

==Awards==
The peninsula was named as a European Destination of Excellence for Sustainable Tourism in 2009. In March 2015, the Sheep&#x27;s Head won Silver at the Irish Responsible Tourism Awards, and was longlisted for &#x27;Best Destination&#x27; in the World Responsible Tourism Awards 2015.

The area&#x27;s tourism cooperative won a special judge&#x27;s commendation at the Irish Tourism Industry Awards in 2015.

<doc id="1019683" wikidata="Q2471318" url="?curid=1019683" title="Spanish Point, County Clare">
<text>Spanish Point () is a village in the parish of Milltown Malbay in County Clare on the west coast of Ireland. It has many holiday homes, and in winter a significantly smaller population. The Beach, over a kilometre long, has Blue Flag Status and is suitable for swimming and surfing. It is also one of the better known surf breaks in County Clare. The name refers to the wrecking of some ships of the Spanish Armada off the coast.

==History==
On the coast, from Milltown Malbay, Spanish Point was named after the Spanish who died here in 1588, when many ships of the Spanish Armada were wrecked during stormy weather. Those who escaped from their sinking ships and made it safely to land were later executed by Sir Turlough O&#x27;Brien of Liscannor and Boethius Clancy, High Sheriff of Clare.

It was not known by the English authorities in Ireland whether the Spanish sailed this way around Ireland because their ships were damaged and the storm prevented them from sailing back the quick way or if it was part of a Spanish plan to invade Ireland. As news of the English victory had not reached William FitzWilliam, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, he had issued a blanket command that all Spanish found in Ireland were to be executed with their ships and treasure seized. The executed Spanish were buried in a mass grave in an area of Spanish Point known locally as Tuama Na Spáinneach (Tomb of the Spaniards). Despite this, there was no archaeological evidence for the claim until 2015 when a group of historians investigating the location of the wreck of &quot;San Marcos&quot; stated they had found a mass grave under Spanish Point which contained the bodies of the executed Spanish sailors.

== Hotel ==
Spanish Point is home of the Atlantic Hotel which was built in 1810 and was promoted as the largest hotel in the British Isles. The hotel closed in 1930 as it had relied upon members of the British nobility visiting for income. This was as a result of the Irish War of Independence and subsequent establishment of the Irish Free State that dissuaded the wealthy from travelling to Spanish Point.

==Sport==
Spanish Point has a nine-hole golf course which was founded in 1896, making it one of the oldest courses in Ireland.

Spanish Point Beach has Blue Flag Status, with facilities and free parking, and is a top surfing spot in Clare. Celtic Surf School is based here.

<text>Michael Dennis Bryant (5 April 192825 April 2002) was a British stage and television actor. An eight-time Olivier Award nominee, Bryant won three. He was also a three-time British Academy Television Award nominee for Best Actor.

==Biography==
Bryant attended Battersea Grammar School and, after service in the Merchant Navy and the Army, attended drama school and appeared in many productions on the London stage. He made his film debut in 1955. He had a role as Mathieu in the BBC2 serial &quot;The Roads to Freedom&quot;, a 1970 adaptation of Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s trilogy of the same name. His guest star appearance as Wing Commander Marsh, who feigns insanity in the &#x27;Tweedledum&#x27; episode of the BBC drama series &quot;Colditz&quot; (1972), is still widely remembered.

Bryant was chosen by Orson Welles to play the lead role in &quot;The Deep&quot;, Welles&#x27;s adaptation of the Charles Williams novel &quot;Dead Calm&quot;. The production frequently ran out of money, and following the death of actor Laurence Harvey in 1973, Welles stopped production and announced the movie – which had been completed except for one special effects shot of a ship exploding – would not be released. (The novel was finally adapted to film in 1989.)

In 1969 Bryant took his love of the stage on a strange trip into the realm of cult films, playing a clever male prostitute who outwits a delusional family of killers in the dark comedy &quot;Mumsy, Nanny, Sonny and Girly&quot;, an adaptation of a play by Maisie Mosco. Due to poor marketing and a lack of faith in the project by the distributor, the film quickly sank into obscurity.

One of Bryant&#x27;s most memorable performances was in the classic BBC television play &quot;The Stone Tape&quot; (1972), in which he plays the leader of a team of scientists who investigate ghost sightings in a brooding Gothic mansion. Equally memorable is his later performance in an adaptation of M. R. James&#x27;s &quot;The Treasure of Abbot Thomas&quot; (1974). 

Bryant also had a supporting role as a sadistic psychiatrist in the cult classic black comedy &quot;The Ruling Class&quot;, with Peter O&#x27;Toole and Alastair Sim. He also appeared in Richard Attenborough&#x27;s &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982) as a British diplomat.

Having played Vladimir Lenin in the film &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot;, Bryant later reprised the role in Robert Bolt&#x27;s play &quot;State of Revolution&quot; (1977), having previously co-starred in Bolt&#x27;s unsuccessful &quot;Gentle Jack&quot;. &quot;State of Revolution&quot; was significant for featuring the first role Bryant performed at the National Theatre, where he went on to be a constant presence for a quarter of a century. Described by Michael Billington as a &quot;rock-solid company man&quot;, he had earlier performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company from 1964, including the premiere production of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Homecoming&quot; (1965), in which he played Teddy, the returning academic.

In 1980, Bryant won the London Drama Critics Circle Theatre Award for Best Actor, and his other theatrical performances were equally well-thought-of. He won Laurence Olivier Awards in 1988 and 1990 and was nominated twice more.

<text>Spiddal, also known as Spiddle (Irish and official name: , , meaning &#x27;the hospital&#x27;), is a village on the shore of Galway Bay in County Galway, Ireland. It is west of Galway city, on the R336 road. It is on the eastern side of the county&#x27;s Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking area) and of the Connemara region. According to the 2022 census, approximately 75% of the population are Irish-speaking and, of these, approximately 40% speak Irish on a daily basis outside the education system. It is a centre for tourism with a beach, harbour, and shore fishing. The village is part of the civil parish of Moycullen.

== Name ==
The name of the village in Irish, , derives from the word , which in turn derived from the Insular French, or Anglo-Normand, word .

The name originates from a mediaeval leper hospital situated in (West Spiddal). A number of other hospital facilities were based in the area over the years, including a famine hospital during the Great Famine of the mid-1840s. While &quot;Spiddle&quot; is recorded in the Placenames Database of Ireland as the English variant of the name, &quot;Spiddal&quot; is used locally.

== History ==
Spiddal, like much of the west of Ireland, suffered greatly during the Great Famine of the 1840s, with many people being evicted, and many starving. Appeals were made by the parish priest John O&#x27;Grady and by A.W. Blake and, as a result, the Board of Works employed some men in improvements to the village harbour.

From 1848, the evangelical Protestant Irish Church Missions were active, establishing the Connemara Orphan&#x27;s Nursery (Spiddal Orphanage or ) in the early 1850s, the home could accommodate up to 90 boys and girls, and became affiliated with the Protestant-run Smyly Homes (and was even referred to as &quot;The Bird&#x27;s Nest&quot;, the name of the home in Dublin). Following its closure as an orphanage, it became a secondary school for girls run by the Catholic Sisters of Mercy.

The local Catholic church, (church of Saint Enda), was built in 1904. The ruin of an older chapel, dating to 1776, is nearby.

== Amenities ==

There are a number of pubs, shops and other services in the village. Spiddal&#x27;s Garda (police) station is on Mountain Road. (&quot;the workshop&quot; in Irish) is a craft centre east of the village where craft works are made and sold.

There is a primary school () and secondary school ().

The area is served by Bus Éireann route 424 from Galway City. The Boluisce River flows south from Boluisce Lake and enters Galway Bay at Spiddal.

== Culture and sport ==
Each summer, groups of Irish teenagers visit Spiddal for three-week Irish language courses. and are two Irish language summer schools. American students visit for the autumn term each year to study Irish-language literature and culture.

Live traditional Irish music is regularly performed in the village&#x27;s pubs. The music group The Waterboys recorded part of their &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Blues&quot; album in Spiddal. They also recorded a song called &quot;Spring Comes to Spiddal&quot; on their album &quot;Room to Roam&quot;. The television series is filmed there, and broadcast on TG4.

The local Gaelic Athletic Association club is , with Gaelic football and hurling being the most popular sports. There is also a sailing club in the village.

<text>Timoleague () is a village in the eastern division of Carbery East in County Cork, Ireland. It is located along Ireland&#x27;s southern coast between Kinsale and Clonakilty, on the estuary of the Argideen River. Nearby is the village of Courtmacsherry. It is about south of Bandon and from Cork on the R600 coastal road. The village is in a townland and civil parish of the same name.

==History==
Timoleague gets its name from its original Irish name &quot;Tigh Molaga&quot;, meaning the &#x27;home (or house) of Molaga&#x27;. St. Molaga was reputed to have brought beekeeping/honey to Ireland. Honey production is still evident in the area. The village was formerly spelt Tagumlag, Tymulagy, Tymoleague. The town of Timoleague and much of the adjacent country belonged to the Hodnetts, an English family who settled in the area from Shropshire. Prior to this, it belonged to the O&#x27;Cowigs. In the reign of Henry III, a great battle was fought at Timoleague, between the Hodnetts, under Lord Phillip Hodnett, and the Barrys, under Lord Barrymore. The Hodnetts were routed, and their leader was killed. The Barrymores then became the owners of Timoleague, and they and their descendants retained possession until the 1800s, when it was purchased by the Travers family.

In 1832, the Timoleague parish priest, Reverend Mr. Charles Ferguson, was murdered when trying to collect tithes by force.

==Places of interest==
Timoleague Friary was founded by the Franciscan order in 1240. The abbey was built on the site of a monastic settlement founded by Saint Molaga in the sixth century. The Four Masters state that the Monastery of Timoleague was founded by MacCarthy Reagh, who lived near Kinsale, in 1240. The McCarthys were over-lords of Corca Laidhe, at least since the 13th century, and received tribute from the chiefs of the district. The abbey was extended by Donal Glas McCarthy in 1312, and by Irish and Norman patrons in the 16th century. The monks were dispersed by the Reformation, but returned in 1604. In 1612, the abbey was sacked by English soldiers who also smashed all of the stained glass windows, but much of the significant architecture remains. The friars remained in the abbey until 1642 when the friary and town were burnt by English soldiers under Lord Forbes.

In Abbeymahon, on the road to Courtmacsherry is the ruins of a Cistercian Abbey – Abbeymahon Abbey. The abbey was founded in 1172 by Dermot MacCormac MacCarthy, King of Desmond. The site was originally at Aghamanister and was colonized with a group of monks from Baltinglass. Almost a century lapsed before the monks decided to move to a new site. The monks moved to Abbeymahon in 1278 when Diarmuit MacCarthaig, son of Domnall Cairbreach, was buried in the new monastery.

The Church of Ireland church, the Church of the Ascension, is also decorated internally in mosaic work carried out and paid for by the Travers family and the final wall completed by the then Maharajah of Gwalior (Madho Rao Scindia) of India in 1925 in memory of his doctor, Dr Crofts, who came from Timoleague. The church itself dates from 1811.

==Economy==
Some of the local industries are based around tourism, agriculture and craft. One of the main employers in the local area is Stauntons Food a local producer of Pork/Bacon products. There are many other small and medium-sized businesses in the area including a small local maker of bespoke kitchens/furniture.

Timoleague Brown Pudding, a type of blood sausage, has been granted Protected Geographical Status under European Union law.

==Demographics==

As of the 2011 census, Timoleague had the highest proportion of Polish people of any settlement in Ireland at 25% of the population of the village.

==Events==
The Timoleague Harvest Festival is held every year in August. In 2006 it attracted acts like Mundy and The Walls, and also hosts events in the village.

==Sport==
The local GAA club, Argideen Rangers, have won the 2005 Cork Intermediate Hurling Championship as well as a number of Junior Football and Hurling County Championships.

The club was home to Mark Foley, who scored 2–7 from play during the 1990 All-Ireland Hurling championship against All-Ireland champions (Tipperary) in the Munster Final in Thurles. He went on to score 1–1 in the All-Ireland Final against Galway in September of that year and brought the Liam MacCarthy Cup to the streets of Timoleague a few days later.

==Transport==
Timoleague railway station once connected the village to the West Cork Railway, by a branch onto the Clonakilty railway line, opened by the Ballinascarthy &amp; Timoleague Junction Light Railway in 1890. The Timoleague &amp; Courtmacsherry Extension Light Railway later extended this to Courtmacsherry in 1891 and its pier in 1892.
It had three locomotives, &quot;Slaney&quot;, &quot;St. Molaga&quot; and &quot;Argadeen&quot;. Regular passenger traffic ceased in 1947 with post-war fuel shortages, and the line was closed completely by CIÉ in 1961. Timoleague railway station opened on 20 December 1890, closed for passenger traffic on 24 February 1947 and finally closed altogether on 1 April 1961.

She also played Sweet Gam Gam on &quot;The Thundermans&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Marla Gibbs was born Margaret Bradley on June 14, 1931, in Chicago, Illinois, at Cook County Hospital. The middle of three sisters, Gibbs was raised in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the city&#x27;s south side. Her father, Douglas Bradley of Waterproof, Louisiana (d. 1947), was a self-taught mechanic of Creole ancestry who owned an ice company. Her mother, Ophelia Birdie (née Kemp; d. 1967) was a businesswoman of Haitian descent who occasionally ran numbers in the gambling trade. In 1936, Gibbs&#x27; parents divorced. Her mother married Charles Cady and relocated to Detroit. Gibbs and her siblings remained in Chicago with their father and grandmother Hattie Sims.

Gibbs attended Corpus Christi Elementary School. After graduating from Corpus Christi in 1945, Gibbs attended St. Elizabeth High School, where she completed her freshman year and the first semester of her sophomore year. During the middle of her sophomore year, Gibbs transferred to Wendell Phillips Academy High School. When she was 16, her father died and Gibbs was sent to live with her mother and stepfather in Detroit where she attended Northern High School for a semester during her junior year. After months in Detroit, Gibbs returned to Chicago, re-enrolling at Phillips where she graduated in June 1949. Several years later, Gibbs returned to Detroit, Michigan, where she attended Peters Business School.

===Career===
In 1963, Gibbs relocated to Los Angeles to recuperate from an ulcer and began working as a reservations agent for United Airlines. She first acted in local Los Angeles black theater before she got her first acting job in the early 1970s, in the blaxploitation films &quot;Sweet Jesus&quot;, &quot;Preacher Man&quot; and &quot;Black Belt Jones&quot;.

In 1975, she was cast in the CBS comedy series &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; as Florence Johnston, the family&#x27;s maid. For the first two years with CBS, Gibbs continued working for United Airlines. She would work at CBS during the day and then leave for her second job, where she worked the night shift. When the series became an established success, CBS requested that she take a leave of absence from her United job. Gibbs&#x27;s performance on the series garnered her five nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and one nomination for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film.

In 1981, she starred in a short-lived spin-off of &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; titled &quot;Checking In&quot;. Gibbs responded in a 2015 interview on Broadway Showbiz, when asked if she&#x27;d based any of her characters on real-life people:
&quot;Yes, Florence was like my aunt and grandmother so I lived it. She came easy to me so I&#x27;m like Florence in giving smart answers, but I was also shy so I wouldn&#x27;t have dared to say some of the things Florence said. I prefer to do whatever I can do at the moment. Whoever&#x27;s hiring me at the moment...that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m supposed to do. My favorite is drama. I&#x27;m doing that now (on &quot;Scandal&quot;), but also still doing comedy on &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;.&quot;

In 1985, when &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; was cancelled after 11 seasons, Gibbs was the lead actress in the NBC sitcom &quot;227&quot;. &quot;227&quot; was adapted from a play directed by Cambridge Players&#x27; then-president Ed Cambridge and was presented to NBC by Cambridge at Gibbs&#x27;s Crossroads Theater in L.A. Cambridge served as artistic director. The series aired until 1990, producing 116 episodes. Two decades later, Gibbs teamed with former &quot;227&quot; co-star Jackée Harry in &quot;The First Family&quot;, where Gibbs had a recurring role as Harry&#x27;s mother Grandma Eddy. She worked with Harry again in the independent film &quot;Forbidden Woman&quot;.

Gibbs had a number of supporting film roles. She also guest starred on &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, &quot;Martin&quot;, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; (with Della Reese), &quot;Judging Amy&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, and &quot;Southland&quot;. From 1998 - 2002 she had a recurring role on &quot;The Hughleys&quot;. Gibbs appeared in the 2012 Tyler Perry film &quot;Madea&#x27;s Witness Protection&quot;, and starred in the 2012 independent film &quot;Grantham &amp; Rose&quot;.

In 2015, Gibbs made two appearances in the Shonda Rhimes&#x27; drama series, &quot;Scandal&quot;. She later guest starred on &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, &quot;American Horror Story: Hotel&quot; and &quot;This Is Us&quot;. In 2018, she was cast in a recurring role on the ABC drama series &quot;Station 19&quot;. Gibbs also had starring roles in two television pilots: &quot;Old Soul&quot; alongside Ellen Burstyn and Rita Moreno for NBC in 2014, and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Jalen Vs. Everybody&quot; in 2017. In film, she co-starred in &quot;Lemon&quot; and &quot;Please Stand By&quot;.
 In 2019, Gibbs reprised her role as Florence on &quot;Live in Front of a Studio Audience: Norman Lear&#x27;s All in the Family and The Jeffersons&quot;, less than a month before her 88th birthday.

In 2021, Gibbs began appearing as Olivia Price in a recurring role on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. That same year, for her contributions to the television industry, she was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

===Other ventures===
From 1981 to 1999, Gibbs owned a jazz club in South Central L.A. called Marla&#x27;s Memory Lane Jazz and Supper Club. She released a number of albums as a singer. In 1990, she moved her Crossroads Arts Academy and Theatre into the former Leimert Theatre in Los Angeles. Plans included the construction of a second stage, but the project ended in debt in June 1997.

==Personal life==
Gibbs was married to her high school sweetheart Jordan Gibbs from 1955 - 1973. The couple had three children: Angela, Dorian, and Joseph. Her older sister, actress Susie Garrett, played Cherie&#x27;s grandmother Betty Johnson on the NBC series &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;. Her daughter Angela, also an actress, appeared on &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; and in films such as &quot;Together Brothers&quot;, &quot;Drumline&quot; and &quot;Think Like a Man Too&quot;.

On July 31, 2014, Gibbs attended the Leimert Park Village Book Fair in Los Angeles to pay tribute to Maya Angelou, who died on May 28, and Ruby Dee, who died on June 11. On January 11, 2016, Gibbs and former &quot;227&quot; co-star Jackée Harry attended the funeral of Grammy Award-winning singer Natalie Cole at the West Angeles Church of God in Christ in Los Angeles. Gibbs co-starred opposite Cole in the television film &quot;Lily in Winter&quot;.

<doc id="1019702" wikidata="Q378452" url="?curid=1019702" title="Travis Tomko">
<text>Travis David Tomko (born March 23, 1976) is an American retired professional wrestler. He is best known for his appearances with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) from 2003 to 2006 under the ring name Tyson Tomko, with New Japan Pro-Wrestling from 2006 to 2008 under his real name, and with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) between 2006 and 2010 under the mononymous name Tomko. Championships held by Tomko include the IWGP Tag Team Championship and TNA World Tag Team Championship.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment (2002–2006) ===

==== Ohio Valley Wrestling (2002–2003) ====
Tomko was signed to a World Wrestling Federation (WWF) developmental contract in April 2002 and assigned to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) to sharpen his skills. While in OVW he was a member of the Disciples of Synn stable and along with stablemate Seven captured the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship, on March 5, 2003, though they lost them less than a month later to the Acolytes Protection Agency (APA).

==== Raw (2003–2006) ====
In July 2003, Tomko began working dark matches for the Raw brand. He made his television debut on the April 19, 2004, &quot;Raw&quot;, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, interfering in a Christian versus Chris Jericho match on Christian&#x27;s behalf and helping him pick up the win. His gimmick was that of &quot;The Problem Solver&quot;, and acting as an &quot;enforcer for hire&quot; for Christian and his kayfabe girlfriend Trish Stratus in their feud with Chris Jericho. His singles matches were few and far between; his main goal was ensuring victory for his clients, usually by interfering. When Christian suffered a legit back injury, Tomko continued to stand by Stratus and aid her in gaining an advantage in feuds against Jericho, Victoria, and Steven Richards, among others. The duo occasionally paired together for mixed tag team matches. Upon Christian&#x27;s return, Tomko immediately paired with him again, filling the same role as before. Following the on-screen split between Stratus and Christian (their dispute was seemingly over Tomko&#x27;s services), Tomko remained Christian&#x27;s enforcer. The duo also wrestled as a tag team on occasion, sometimes aligning themselves with Christian&#x27;s former tag team partner and real-life friend Edge. In June 2005, Tomko, Christian, and Edge joined forces with Eric Bischoff in his crusade against Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW).

Tomko and Christian were separated in June 2005 when Christian was drafted to SmackDown!. Now on his own, Tomko was pushed as a &quot;monster heel&quot;, winning singles matches against many jobbers by (kayfabe) knock out after hitting a big boot to the back of the head. On &quot;Raw&quot;, he knocked out both World Tag Team Champions, The Hurricane and Rosey. His winning streak ended after he was pinned by John Cena on &quot;Raw&quot; two weeks in a row. Tomko then went on to form a tag team with Snitsky, however, they were not given much of a push.

On April 3, 2006, Tomko quit WWE on good terms. He then began to work in Japan.

===New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2006–2008)===
Tomko debuted in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) on July 1, 2006, participating in an eight-man tag match which he won. A few days later, Tomko and Giant Bernard took part in a tournament to determine the interim IWGP Tag Team Champions and reached the finals before losing to Shiro Koshinaka and Togi Makabe. Tomko participated in a tournament for the vacant IWGP Heavyweight Championship, which had been vacated by Brock Lesnar, and lost in the first round to Yuji Nagata. He also participated in G1 Tag League 2006 in block B with Giant Bernard and reached the semi-final before losing to the eventual winners, Masahiro Chono and Shinsuke Nakamura.

At Wrestle Kingdom in Tokyo Dome, Tomko teamed up with D&#x27;Lo Brown and Buchanan to take on Tomohiro Ishii, Togi Makabe and Toru Yano, Makabe pinned Buchanan. Tomko lost to Togi Makabe in the first round of the New Japan Cup 2007. On March 11, 2007, Tomko and Giant Bernard defeated Manabu Nakanishi and Takao Omori to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship. Tomko and Bernard joined Masahiro Chono&#x27;s BLACK faction and would eventually defect to RISE. The pair won G1 Tag League 2007 by defeating Hiroshi Tanahashi and Koji Kanemoto.

At Wrestle Kingdom in Tokyo Dome II, Tomko and Bernard defeated The Steiner Brothers. They lost the titles on February 2, 2008, to Great Bash Heel members Togi Makabe and Toru Yano. Tomko was released early in March 2008 after NJPW decided not to renew his contract. NJPW were struggling financially and could not afford to keep him going. They did however, re-sign his tag team partner Giant Bernard.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2006–2008) ===

==== Christian&#x27;s Coalition (2006–2007) ====

On the November 23, 2006 episode of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;, Tomko made his debut in a run-in during a NWA World Heavyweight Championship number one contender&#x27;s match between Christian Cage and Sting, attacking Sting and siding with Cage, once again acting as Christian&#x27;s enforcer. On the January 11, 2007 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Tomko went one on one against NWA World Heavyweight Champion Abyss in a non-title match. To avoid interference, Jim Cornette locked Christian in a cage, and also had Kurt Angle at ringside. During the bout, Angle got into a brawl with Samoa Joe, leaving Cage to escape the cage and interfere in the match, causing a disqualification. On the March 1 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot; he beat Samoa Joe for a chance for an NWA title shot against Cage.

On the March 8 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Christian&#x27;s Coalition lost to Kurt Angle, Rhino and Samoa Joe by disqualification after interference from Abyss who Black Hole slammed Angle. At Destination X, while getting out of the limo onto the black and blue carpet, Christian Cage received a telegram from Tomko stating that Tomko was in Japan and would come back if Cage would give him a title shot. Once Tomko returned from Japan, Cage offered Tomko a spot on Team Cage at Lockdown, but Tomko said he would not choose a team until he got a title shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. It ended up being that Jim Cornette came out and said that the main event on &quot;Impact!&quot; that night would be one member from Team Cage fighting one member from Team Angle. Whichever team member won, Tomko would go to the team the member was from. It would be Abyss from Team Cage fighting Kurt Angle from Team Angle. In the end, Kurt Angle won by pinfall, but after the match, Tomko signed on to Team Cage instead of Team Angle, making him the final member of Team Cage to fight Team Angle at Lockdown along with Abyss, A.J. Styles, Scott Steiner, and Christian Cage. A match was held to see who would go into the cage first. It would be a match between Samoa Joe and Styles, Jeff Jarrett interfered to become the fifth member of team Angle. Tomko entered that match as the third member, and was successful, until being gored through the cage door. In the end Jeff Jarrett hit Abyss with a guitar full of tacks, and Sting got the pin.

On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Tomko took part in Team Cage&#x27;s attack on Abyss for being a liability to the team&#x27;s success after Abyss and Cage failed to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship from Team 3D. One week later, Tomko and Scott Steiner were given a tag team title shot of their own, but failed thanks to botched interference from The Latin American Xchange (LAX). At Sacrifice, Tomko and Steiner met LAX and 3D in a three-way match for the title, but failed again.

After this loss, Rick Steiner debuted in TNA and helped Scott attack Tomko. Tomko remained in what was from then on once again known as Christian&#x27;s Coalition, once again focused on aiding Cage. Some friction did set in after Cage cost Tomko his May 31, 2007 King of the Mountain qualifying match by distracting him with a chair. Tomko had been placed in the match against fellow Coalition member A.J. Styles because original contestant Jeff Jarrett no-showed (due to his wife&#x27;s death). Christian was able to convince Tomko to continue on as his ally, which later came in handy as Tomko would go on to do much of the brunt work in the Coalition&#x27;s feud against the returned Abyss and Sting, though he would be twice pinned by Abyss at PPV&#x27;s after taking a Black Hole Slam each time. However, the Coalition finally avenged these losses with another bloody beatdown of Abyss which also featured the laying-out of Sting on the July 26 &quot;Impact!&quot;.

On the PPV that followed, Hard Justice, Tomko, along with Styles and Christian, had taken part in a &quot;Doomsday Chamber of Blood Match&quot;, which Abyss picked a week after winning the contract to make it. The match was a barbed-wire six sides of steel cage match in which the objective was to make an opponent bleed and pin that opponent. The Coalition was able to lock Sting out for a while, but after he appeared in the ring, Tomko would be the first man busted open. After a long match, Christian would escape the cage, and Styles was pinned by Abyss.

====Teaming with Styles (2007)====

At No Surrender he and Styles won a 10-tag team gauntlet match to win title shots at Bound For Glory. At Bound for Glory on October 14, A.J. Styles and Tomko won the TNA World Tag Team Championship from Team Pacman.

Styles and Tomko defeated LAX on the November 1 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot; to retain the TNA Tag Team title. Styles and Tomko&#x27;s success led to some uncertainty within the Coalition, causing Tomko to ask Christian what the chain of command was. Christian said that when he wasn&#x27;t around, it was Styles - disappointing Tomko. AJ would go on to make some foolish decisions without Tomko&#x27;s advice or help, starting with a take-down match against Scott Steiner that night. The last major choice Styles made for the Coalition was to join forces with Kurt Angle, forming the Angle Alliance at Genesis by assisting Angle in retaining his TNA World Heavyweight Championship. This plan quickly fell apart, as Christian and Angles could not cooperate, leaving them to fight over Styles and Tomko. The tension between Christian and Kurt would make Styles doubt himself, and he&#x27;d often turn to Tomko for advice, which Tomko would not give, telling Styles that he got into this mess himself since he was the one in charge. Tomko&#x27;s continued distancing of himself from both groups would lead him to separate from the Alliance two weeks before Final Resolution on an episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, stating that from now on he works for Tomko. He and A.J. Styles defeated Kevin Nash and Samoa Joe to retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship at Final Resolution. When Styles interfered on behalf of Kurt Angle to help him retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Christian Cage, staying with the Angle Alliance and turning his back on Cage, Tomko was not present with him, leaving both Christian and Angle, staying true to his word.

====Kurt Angle&#x27;s henchman (2008)====
On the January 3 &quot;Impact!&quot; clarified Tomko&#x27;s new outlook. While Styles worried about Christian&#x27;s wrath in Kurt Angle&#x27;s dressing room, Tomko explained to him that he&#x27;s on his own. The following week, in an interview, Tomko said Styles got himself into the situation - matter of fact, he created it - and that Tomko knew it was no-win, generally stayed out of it, and now is making his own decisions. That same night, Tomko had his first singles match since becoming independent against Shark Boy, who in storyline was injured, and quickly defeated him. At Against All Odds Tomko cost Christian the world title, then reluctantly aligned with Kurt Angle, following Styles&#x27; example so they could stay partners - with no intention of being a team player to the point of becoming a lapdog again. He also became frustrated with Styles constant attraction to Karen Angle, claiming it&#x27;s hurting the team&#x27;s focus and even exploding on Styles on an episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;.

At the 2008 Lockdown PPV, Tomko was captain of his own team in the Lethal Lockdown match, though his team lost to Team Cage after Rhino pinned James Storm. The following episode of &quot;Impact&quot;, Styles and Tomko lost the TNA Tag Team Titles to Eric Young and Kaz in controversial fashion relating to Young&#x27;s alter-ego of &quot;Super Eric&quot;. This resulted in the titles being vacated and put on the line in a tournament at Sacrifice, which was won by The Latin American Xchange. Following the tournament, Tomko returned from a storyline injury suffered in Japan, and expressed unhappiness towards Styles for participating in the tournament with Super Eric, who was responsible for their title loss in the first place. Styles, in turn, expressed frustration over having to follow others for the past months and wanted to break out on his own. Following that, Tomko wished Styles the best of luck and officially disbanded their tag team.

Tomko continued to act as Kurt Angle&#x27;s henchman, notably harassing Karen Angle on the debut of her interview segment &quot;Karen&#x27;s Angle&quot; on the July 31 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;. He was then scheduled to feud with Matt Morgan but the program was cut short when Tomko parted ways with TNA in late July 2008, with reports circulating that he was unhappy with management. His final television appearance was on the August 7 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot; in an 8-man gauntlet in which he was pinned by Samoa Joe.

Tomko had planned on working regularly for the Inoki Genome Federation in Japan but they cancelled many of their upcoming shows, opening up his schedule to appear one last time with TNA on a non-contractual basis. On the September 11, 2008, edition of &quot;Impact!&quot; he appeared as the third of three challengers to Samoa Joe as a part of Kevin Nash&#x27;s challenge.

=== Hustle (2009) ===
Tomko debuted in June 2009 under a mask and the ring name Arma in the Japanese wrestling promotion Hustle, where he formed a villainous tag team called &quot;Armageddon&quot; with fellow former WWE star René Duprée, who served as his partner Geddon. This team would disband shortly thereafter when Geddon turned face and changed his ring name back to René Bonaparte. On July 30, 2009, Bonaparte defeated Arma in Tomko&#x27;s final Hustle appearance.

=== Return to TNA Wrestling (2009–2010) ===
On the November 19, 2009, edition of &quot;Impact!&quot; Tomko officially returned to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in an interview with Lauren, seemingly as a face. He made his in-ring return on the December 17 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, where he, A.J. Styles, Kurt Angle, Abyss and Bobby Lashley defeated Scott Steiner, Doug Williams, Brutus Magnus, Dr. Stevie and Raven. On the January 14 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot; Tomko turned heel as he was revealed as the man who had attacked Styles multiple times during the past three months, successfully scoring a match for Styles&#x27; TNA World Heavyweight Championship later that night as a result. However, Styles defeated him to retain the title. On the February 4 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Tomko lost to Kurt Angle in an 8 Card Stud Tournament Qualifying match. On the March 4 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Tomko lost to Jeff Jarrett. On the March 22 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Tomko was defeated by Rob Terry in a match for the TNA Global Championship. He was seen in a group of heels Eric Bischoff had directed to remove Abyss&#x27; mask, and on the May 13 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Tomko lost to Orlando Jordan via submission which turned out to be his last match in TNA. On August 19, 2010, Tomko&#x27;s profile was placed in the alumni section on TNA&#x27;s official website.

===Independent circuit (2013–2016)===
On September 4, 2013, Tomko made his debut in Ring Warriors, where he claimed to be the next Ring Warriors Grand Champion. The following week, Tomko defeated Michael Sain. On November 2, 2013, Tomko challenged Bruce Santee for the NWA FUW Bruiserweight Championship, but the match ended in no contest. On February 1, 2014, Tomko wrestled Francisco Ciatso at the USA PRO WRESTLING 20th Anniversary Show in Orlando, Florida. Tomko won by disqualification when Ciatso introduced a chair into the match. On January 21, 2016, Tomko made a tweet on Twitter that he his returning to the ring. Tomko faced Locke and QT Santee at FHW Wrestling in Palm Beach, Florida. on January 22, 2016. On February 13, 2016, Tomko faced Tommy Vandal at Independent Championship Wrestling in Miami, Florida. On February 22, 2016, Tomko faced James &quot;The Kid&quot; Sabin at Florida Hardcore Wrestling and ended up in a disqualification when Sabin hit the referee with the chair.

<doc id="1019703" wikidata="Q708193" url="?curid=1019703" title="German occupation of Luxembourg during World War II">
<text>The German occupation of Luxembourg in World War II began in May 1940 after the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg was invaded by Nazi Germany. Although Luxembourg was officially neutral, it was situated at a strategic point at the end of the French Maginot Line. On 10 May 1940, the German &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; invaded Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands. Luxembourg was initially placed under a military administration, but later became a civilly administrated territory and finally was annexed directly into Germany. The Germans believed Luxembourg to be a Germanic state, and attempted to suppress what they perceived as alien French language and cultural influences. Although some Luxembourgers joined the resistance or collaborated with the Germans, both constituted a minority of the population. As German nationals, from 1942, many Luxembourgers were conscripted into the German military. Nearly 3,500 Luxembourgish Jews were murdered during the Holocaust. The liberation of the country by the Allies began in September 1944, but due to the Ardennes Offensive it was not completed until early 1945.

==Eve of the invasion==
The outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939 put Luxembourg&#x27;s government in a delicate situation. On the one hand, the population&#x27;s sympathy lay with Belgium and France; on the other hand, due to the country&#x27;s policy of neutrality since 1867&#x27;s Treaty of London, the government adopted a careful non-belligerent stance towards its neighbours. As of 1 September, Radio Luxembourg stopped broadcasting. In spring 1940, fortifications were erected along the borders with Germany and France. The so-called Schuster Line, named after its constructor, consisted of massive concrete roadblocks with steel doors. The official aim of these road blocks was to slow down the progress of any invading army and give time for the guarantors of Luxembourg&#x27;s neutrality to take counteractions against the invaders. However, compared to the massive power of the German forces, it had only symbolic character and helped to calm down the population. Except for its small &quot;Corps des Gendarmes et Volontaires&quot;, Luxembourg did not possess an army, due to the treaty&#x27;s restrictions.

After several false alarms in the spring of 1940, the probability of a military conflict between Germany and France grew. Germany stopped the export of coke for the Luxembourgish steel industry.

==Invasion==

The steel doors of the Schuster Line were ordered closed on 10 May 1940 at 03:15, following movements of German troops on the east side of the border rivers Our, Sauer and Mosel. In the meantime, German special forces dressed as civilians and supported by Germans living in Luxembourg - the so-called &quot;Stoßtrupp Lützelburg&quot; - tried to sabotage radio broadcasting and the barricades along the German-Luxembourgish border but their attempt failed. The Royal Family was evacuated from its residence in Colmar-Berg to the Grand Ducal palace in Luxembourg City.

The German invasion, made up of the 1st, 2nd, and 10th Panzer Divisions began at 04:35. They encountered no significant resistance save for some bridges destroyed and some land mines, since the majority of the Luxembourgish Volunteer Corps stayed in their barracks. Luxembourgish police resisted the German troops, however, to little avail; the capital city being occupied before noon. Total Luxembourgish casualties amounted to 75 police and soldiers captured, six police wounded, and one soldier wounded. At 08:00, elements of the of General Robert Petiet, supported by the 1st Spahi Brigade of Colonel Jouffault and the 2nd company of the 5th Armoured Battalion, crossed the southern border to conduct a probe of German forces; these units later retreated behind the Maginot Line. By the evening of 10 May 1940, most of the country, with the exception of the south, was occupied by German forces. More than 90,000 civilians evacuated from the canton of Esch-sur-Alzette as a consequence of the advance. 47,000 fled to France, 45,000 fled into the central and northern part of Luxembourg.

Grand Duchess Charlotte and the government of prime minister Pierre Dupong fled to France, Portugal and the United Kingdom, before finally settling in Canada for the duration of the war. Charlotte, exiled in London, became an important symbol of national unity. Her eldest son and heir, Jean, volunteered for the British Army in 1942. The only official representative left behind was , head of a governmental commission, as well as the 41 members of the Chamber of Deputies.

== Governance ==

=== Military administration ===

Early on 10 May 1940, the German diplomat Von Radowitz handed the general secretary of the Luxembourgish government a memorandum from the German government, stating that Germany had no intention of changing the territorial integrity or political independence of the Grand Duchy. The following day, a military administration for Luxembourg was set up. Luxembourgish interests were represented by a governmental commission under Albert Wehrer, which consisted of senior civil servants and had been legitimated by the Chamber of Deputies. There was a good relationship between this commission and the military authorities, as Colonel Schumacher showed a broad-minded attitude towards the country&#x27;s problems and a willingness to solve these in consultation with the government commission.

On 13 July 1940, the &quot;Volksdeutsche Bewegung&quot; (VdB) was founded in Luxembourg City under the leadership of Damian Kratzenberg, a German teacher at the Athénée de Luxembourg. Its main goal was to push the population towards a German-friendly position by means of propaganda, and it was this organisation that used the phrase &quot;Heim ins Reich&quot;.

Several Deputies and high-ranking civil servants were of the opinion that Luxembourg could retain a measure of autonomy under the military administration, as had occurred in World War I, and attempts were made to come to some sort of arrangement with Germany. However, it was soon made clear by the authorities in Berlin that Luxembourg&#x27;s fate would be very different this time. The Nazis considered the Luxembourgish people as just another Germanic ethnic group and the Grand Duchy a German territory. The military authorities were withdrawn from Luxembourg by 31 July 1940, to be replaced by a civil administration under Gustav Simon.

=== Civil administration and annexation===

Gustav Simon was appointed &quot;Chef der Zivilverwaltung&quot; (&quot;CdZ&quot;; &quot;Chief of the Civil Administration&quot;) by the &quot;Oberkommando des Heeres&quot; on 21 July 1940. Luxembourg was then included into the &quot;CdZ-Gebiet Luxemburg&quot; on 29 July. While initially subordinate to the military commands in Belgium and northern France, Simon was confirmed in his appointment on 2 August by Adolf Hitler himself, indicating that he reported directly to the &quot;Führer&quot; and no one else. This granted him a wide degree of autonomy with regards to the military and civil authorities of Nazi Germany.

Simon, who was also the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of the neighbouring &quot;Gau Trier-Koblenz,&quot; later &quot;Moselland &quot;(&quot;Gauleiter &quot;being a title denoting the leader of a regional branch of the Nazi party), led a propaganda and later terror campaign, known as &quot;Heim ins Reich&quot;, to convince the population that they were ethnic Germans and a natural part of the Third Reich. His objective was &quot;to win Luxembourg back over to the German nation as soon as possible.&quot; He was convinced that Luxembourgers only needed a level of education and enlightenment in order to voluntarily declare their loyalty to Germany. He deduced this from his belief that they were, in fact, German &quot;by blood and by descent&quot;. To the &quot;Gauleiter&quot;, Luxembourgish independence was an &quot;absurd idea,&quot; which existed only because the monarchy and government had nurtured it: if the Luxembourgers were shown evidence of their belonging to the German nation, the will to be independent must disappear.

==Life in occupied Luxembourg==
The general public were slow to react at first, still feeling shock from the invasion of 1914–1918. Furthermore, the royal family and the government had silently fled into exile. The majority of the population kept their heads low to avoid any conflict with the authorities; others participated in acts of passive resistance.

===Germanification===
The administration of Simon arrived in Luxembourg fully persuaded that the &quot;German-ness&quot; of the Luxembourgers merely lay under a thin external layer of French influence. This in turn meant that, with a bit of determined &quot;unraveling&quot; by his administration, the German character of the population would essentially reveal itself.

Simon had two clear goals:
* The Nazification and Germanisation of Luxembourg, i.e., the extinction of everything that was not of German source, like French names and words of French origin or a French way of life
* The destruction and dismemberment of the Luxembourgish state institutions, and the country&#x27;s incorporation into the Third Reich

His very first series of decrees made this policy very clear:

* 6 August 1940: German became the only official language, and the usage of the French language was banned. The ban applied to official and administrative usage as well as everyday life. French expressions of courtesy such as &quot;Bonjour&quot;, &quot;Merci&quot;, &quot;Monsieur&quot;, &quot;Madame&quot;, etc. were included; people greeting each other had to say &quot;Heil Hitler&quot;. 
* Autumn 1940. The political parties and independent labour unions, the Parliament and the Conseil d&#x27;État were dissolved. All civil society organisations and the press were subjected to Nazi control.
* Till end 1940. German law was introduced including the &quot;Sondergerichte&quot; and the Nuremberg Laws.
* 31 January 1941: French-sounding family names, first names, and the names of streets, towns, shops and companies were Germanised, that is, translated into their German counterpart or simply replaced by something more Germanic. Henri became Heinrich, Dupont became Brückner.
* 18 February 1941: Wearing a beret (a traditional cap from the Northern Basque Country) was forbidden.
* From May 1941 many Luxembourgish youth were ordered to participate in the Reichsarbeitsdienst.

A massive propaganda campaign was launched to influence the population, while not only dissidents and critics but also teachers, officials and leading business figures were threatened with losing their jobs unless they joined Nazi organisations, which led to much increased recruitment from all professions. A central registry documented the personal opinion regarding the Nazi regime of almost every citizen. People who were openly opposed to the regime lost their jobs or were deported, mainly to eastern Germany and in the worst cases sent to the death camps where many of them were murdered.

The occupation authorities attempted to cover Luxembourg with a net of political, social and cultural organisations, such as also existed in Germany, including the Hitler Youth, the League of German Girls, the &quot;Winterhilfswerk&quot;, the &quot;NS-Frauenschaft&quot; and the &quot;Deutsche Arbeitsfront&quot;.

=== Catholic Church ===
The Catholic Church in Luxembourg was relatively silent during the war, and took no public stance regarding the fate of the Jews or the Nazi regime. On the one hand, the Bishop, Joseph Laurent Philippe, was bedridden due to illness, and was therefore in no state to provide active opposition. On the other hand, the Bishop did not want to further antagonise the occupiers and endanger the already precarious religious life of the Church, which was heavily restricted during wartime. Bishop Philippe did, however, refuse to meet with the Nazi leadership, and made preparations in case his post should fall vacant. 

The Church saw its very existence threatened as it was pushed out of public life by the anti-religious policies of the Nazis: public religious events such as the Octave celebration or the dancing procession were banned, Christian organisations were dissolved, religious education in schools was abolished, and a ban on the religious orders was put in place.

At the same time, the diocese administration remained one of very few Luxembourgish institutions that stayed intact during the war, although this was in doubt for a while, and a deportation of the Bishop was considered by the occupation authorities. Plans were made to deport him to Vichy France, though this failed due to the objections of the German ambassador in Paris and of the Sicherheitsdient headquarters in Berlin.

The Bishop&#x27;s primary concern was to maintain pastoral care. In order to preserve this, he was prepared to give way on individual points. Thus, he made no official protest against the measures of the Zivilverwaltung, and tried to keep members of the clergy from &quot;ill-considered&quot; actions.

Many priests felt differently from the Bishop and used their influence on their congregations to strengthen their patriotic feelings, and protested against the occupation or became active in the Resistance. In the course of the war, out of 446 Catholic priests in Luxembourg, 58 were arrested, 16 imprisoned in Dachau and 7 were killed there. Another 18 clerics were deported to Vichy France.

=== Economy ===
Luxembourg&#x27;s economy was dominated by heavy industry, especially mining and the steel industry. For its raw materials, and to sell its finished products it depended on the overseas market. Economically it could only survive by adhering to a wider economic area. In the 19th century it had been part of the German Confederation and the German customs union. After World War I, under Allied pressure, it re-oriented itself towards the West. German capital and companies — heavily present in the steel industry until then — left the country, and Luxembourg joined the Belgium–Luxembourg Economic Union (UEBL).

In the 1920s, Germany once again became Luxembourg&#x27;s second-biggest economic partner, far ahead of France or Britain. As Germany was a large buyer of its heavy industry products, and provided 90% of Luxembourg&#x27;s coal needs, the smaller country was dependent on Germany and susceptible to its pressures or threats.

As soon as the country was occupied, German heavy industry declared its interest in the Luxembourgish iron/steel mills. They let their wishes be known in Berlin and staked their claims. The Vereinigte Stahlwerke requested to take over Hadir; both the Reichswerke and Hoesch AG wanted to take over ARBED.

On 15 August 1940 the German currency and customers border was extended, so that Luxembourg was brought into the German economic area and its economic union with Belgium dissolved. On 29 January 1941 the Reichsmark became the only legal payment method, and the Cdz ordered all Luxembourgish curency to be handed in. The most important of the German tax laws were gradually rolled out in Luxembourg.

===Resistance===

The Luxembourgish resistance was carried out by only a small fraction of the population. Its formation was spontaneous and slow at first. The first groups were formed from autumn 1940 to summer 1941. In the beginning they worked without coordination and from different motivations, for instance Liberals opposed to the anti-Jewish policies and in favour of democracy as well as conservative Roman Catholics with sometimes more or less anti-national socialist tendencies. Some of the latter category also were at the same time opposed to the Soviet Union and &quot;Bolshevism&quot;, hoping that the generals of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; would defeat Joseph Stalin and the Red Army, while at the same time hiding Jews and anti-Nazi clergy mixed together in their farms. The Luxembourg Resistance was joined by the Communist Party of Luxembourg only after the invasion of the USSR in June 1941.

The activities of the Resistance were largely directed towards undermining the German monopoly on information, and providing moral support to the population, by spreading counter-propaganda by word-of-mouth, leaflets, posters and later whole newspapers. Additionally, the Resistance helped Allied POWs and shot-down pilots, &quot;deserters&quot; from the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and other endangered Luxembourgers to cross the borders into Belgium or France. The introduction of forced labour and conscription into the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; added to the Resistance&#x27;s tasks: a large number of youths who refused to serve in the German armed forces now had to be hidden around the country and kept safe and fed, or helped to escape abroad. Collections of food and money were also made to help the families of those who were arrested, deported, or fired from their jobs. An increasingly important part of the Resistance&#x27;s activities was to provide military, political and economic intelligence to the Allies. While some acts of sabotage did take place, they were rare and were seen as too risky in a small country with no remote areas to which they could withdraw. For similar reasons, armed combat by the Resistance against the occupiers was rare. Finally, many of the movements made contact with the government-in-exile, the Allies, and the French and Belgian resistance movements, with about 400 men joining the armed resistance in France. Additionally around 300 men from Luxembourg left their country to fight in the Ardennes section of the Witte Brigade, where they formed the so-called &quot;Red Lion Brigade&quot;.

Several well-known Catholic and Communist households, and many parishes and priories, also kept a number of Jewish Luxembourgish civilians and foreign Jews hidden and safe.

====Passive resistance====
Non-violent passive resistance was widespread in Luxembourg during the period. From August 1940, the &quot;Spéngelskrich&quot; (the &quot;War of Pins&quot;) took place as Luxembourgers wore patriotic pin-badges (depicting the national colours or the Grand duchess), precipitating attacks from the VdB.

In October 1941, the German occupiers took a survey of Luxembourgish civilians who were asked to state their nationality, their mother tongue and their racial group, but contrary to German expectations, 95% answered &quot;Luxembourgish&quot; to each question. The refusal to declare themselves as German citizens led to mass arrests.

Conscription was particularly unpopular. On 31 August 1942, shortly after the announcement that conscription would be extended to all men born between 1920 and 1927, a strike began in the northern town of Wiltz. The strike spread rapidly, paralysing the factories and industries of Luxembourg. The strike was quickly repressed and its leaders arrested. 20 were summarily tried before a special tribunal (in German, a &quot;Standgericht&quot;) and executed by firing squad at nearby Hinzert concentration camp. Nevertheless, protests against conscription continued and 3,500 Luxembourgers would desert the German army after being conscripted.

===Collaboration===

Collaboration with the Nazi occupation is an aspect less often talked about in Luxembourg. Studies have shown that collaboration was a phenomenon in all layers of society. There was, however, an over-representation of civil servants among the collaborators. On average, the collaborators were younger than the general population. In early September 1944, approximately 10,000 people left Luxembourg with the German civil administration: it is generally assumed that this consisted of 3,500 collaborators and their families. In 1945, 5,101 Luxembourgers, including 2,857 men and 2,244 women were in prison for political activities, constituting 1.79% of the population. Twelve collaborators were sentenced to death and were shot in Reckenthal in Luxembourg City. 249 were sentenced to forced labour, 1366 were sentenced to prison and 645 were sent to workhouses.

===Repression===
Faced with opposition from the general public the regime took brutal measures against any form of resistance. After the general strike of 1942, Gustav Simon proclaimed a state of emergency and introduced the German &quot;Standgerichte&quot;. Thousands were arrested and tortured. Hundreds were murdered in the concentration camps. Whole families were deported to eastern Germany and replaced by German families, mainly from South-Tyrol and Eastern Europe. The headquarters of the Gestapo, the Villa Pauly, became the symbol of this terror.

In August 1940, the Gestapo had established its headquarters in the Villa Pauly in Luxembourg City, with field offices in the Villa Seligmann in Esch and the Villa Conter in Diekirch.

On 9 September 1942, the Gauleiter announced a &quot;Resettlement operation for Luxembourg. From then until 1944, more than 1,410 families (4,200 individuals) were resettled to the East, the Sudetenland and Upper Silesia. Their property was stolen and they were to be educated into becoming &quot;good Germans&quot;, being forbidden from returning to Luxembourg. From 1943, in addition to families deported for political reasons, the Germans started resettling families whose sons evaded conscription into the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; or who had deserted from their units. Out of these resettled people, 73 died in the camps, including 9 children, mostly due to malnutrition and the lack of medical facilities.

=== Culture and arts ===
After a short period of boycott, from 1941 cinemas became a place to escape and forget everyday life, in this generally dark period for the country. Alongside the increadingly tough repression of the German apparatus from 1941/42, the public&#x27;s passion for cinema increased. In a time of war, occupation and repression, cinema was one of few means of distraction available to the wider public.

Audiences eagerly consumed comedies, love films, high-spectacle productions and musical films. Aside from numerous reactions of disapproval in cinemas when films of explicit propaganda or the news were shown, the Luxembourg public&#x27;s hostility towards Nazi German and the occupation manifested itself in other domains of social, cultural and political life (boycotting official events, the census of 10 October 1941, strike of 31 August 1942). But unlike most events organised by the occupiers (plays, concerts, public lectures), cinema was not seen as explicitly Nazi, despite most of the films being from Germany, and watching German entertainment films was not seen as expressing support for the occupiers.

The Luxembourgish public were generally hostile towards films whose Nazi propaganda message was too conspicuous. Films such as &quot;Ohm Krüger&quot;, &quot;Cadets&quot;, or &quot;Sieg im Westen&quot; were intended to praise the German spirit, glorify heroic deaths, stigmatise Germany&#x27;s enemies, appeal to unconditional submission to Nazi Germany and convince Luxembourgers that their destiny lay in the German fold; these films were accompanied by aggressive advertising. In spite of this, they were rejected by most Luxembourgish cinema-goers, and German propaganda cinema did not succeed in putting a stop to the Luxembourgish public&#x27;s pro-American and pro-British sympathies.

Yet at the same time, the public&#x27;s majority anti-German attitude did not prevent it from becoming infatuated with a certain number of film productions that were fiercely conservative, if not explicitly Nazi. In Luxembourg, even among the fiercest opponents of the occupation, some were characterised by ideological convictions that were aggressively conservative, in some cases reactionary and authoritarian. This may explain the (relative) success of films such as the antisemitic &quot;Jud Süß&quot;, or &quot;Die goldene Stadt&quot;, a melodrama with racist undertones celebrating Germanic virtues and imbued with the &quot;blood and soul&quot; ideology.

==The Holocaust==

Before the invasion, 3,900 Jews lived in Luxembourg, many of them refugees from Germany and Austria. On the night of 10 May 1940, about 1,600 of them left the country. After Simon introduced the Nuremberg Laws, life became unbearable for the Jewish population. Their shops, possessions and money were confiscated and all Jewish employees were fired. They were not allowed inside public buildings or to keep pets. Up until 15 October 1941, a further 1,500 Jews left the country on the orders of the authorities. The Gestapo accompanied them to France and Spain but, since they were rejected there, they went on an endless odyssey.

On 23 August 1941, a curfew was introduced for the Jewish population and they were degraded to second class citizens. The synagogues in Luxembourg City and Esch-sur-Alzette were destroyed; the ones in Ettelbruck and Mondorf-les-Bains were devastated. The Nazis concentrated most of the remaining 800 Jews in the old monastery of Cinqfontaines (Fünfbrunnen). From here, they were deported on 7 trains from 16 October 1941 to 17 June 1943 to the ghetto of Litzmannstadt and the concentration camps of Lublin and Theresienstadt, and from 1943 directly to the extermination camp of Auschwitz.

On 17 June 1943, Gustav Simon announced Luxembourg to be &quot;Judenfrei&quot;. From the 683 deported, only 43 survived.

==Liberation==

Luxembourg was liberated by Allied forces in September 1944, specifically U.S. Army Combat Command A (CCA), 5th Armored Division. The first U.S. forces entered Luxembourgish territory near Petange on 9 September, and liberated the capital city on 10 September 1944. The Germans retreated without fighting. By 12 September 90% of the Grand Duchy had been liberated. One month before the start of the Battle of the Bulge, 250 soldiers of the Waffen-SS had unsuccessfully tried to recapture the town of Vianden from the Luxembourgish Resistance during the Battle of Vianden. During the Battle of the Bulge, the northern part of the country was hit by artillery from a special unit that the Germans designed to send shells up to away (see V3), but the Germans did not retake the city.

==Casualties and damage==
In total, 5,700 Luxembourgish citizens died during World War II, which corresponds to 2% of the population of 1940, the highest such loss in Western Europe. Additionally, 18,658 buildings were destroyed or heavily damaged, counting for 1/3 of all buildings in Luxembourg (affecting 39% the population). These numbers put into perspective how high the losses of Luxembourg actually were during World War II. (Most of the damages occurred during the Battle of the Bulge.)

== Legacy ==

The government-in-exile in 1941 declared all measures by the German occupiers to be null and void, which it re-affirmed in 1944. However, it also stated that &quot;[n]ot all is bad in the German system, we would do well to conserve some of the institutions that they have introduced.&quot; Hence, when the exiled government returned, it retained certain German regulations and dispositions in the areas of employment law, tax law and social legislation.

After the war the organisation &quot;Ons Jongen&quot; (&quot;Our Boys&quot;) was formed to represent Luxembourgish conscripts into the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. The 10,000 affected young men and their families constituted a significant force in a country of around 300,000 inhabitants; they lobbied both the Luxembourgish government and the Federal Republic of Germany; later, they were represented by the &quot;Federation of Victims of Nazism Forcibly Conscripted&quot;. Apart from lobbying, the organisation also undertook commemorative work. It almost certainly contributed to slowing the normalisation of Germano-Luxembourgish relations.

The Centre for Documentation and Research on the Resistance and the Centre for Documentation and Research on forced Conscription were founded in 2002 and 2005, respectively, to conduct research on the period of German occupation. They are funded by the government.

The German occupation period features in the following drama films: &quot;Déi zwéi vum Bierg&quot; (1985), &quot;Der neunte Tag&quot; (2004), &quot;Réfractaire&quot; (2009), and &quot;Emil&quot; (2010); it is also the subject of the 2004 documentary &quot;Heim ins Reich&quot;.

Several street names in the capital city are named after World War II events in Luxembourg, or pay tribute to Allied military or political leaders in the war, especially those that had a hand in the liberation of Luxembourg:

* Allée des Résistants et des Déportés
* Avenue Charles-de-Gaulle
* Avenue du Dix-Septembre
* Boulevard d&#x27;Avranches
* Boulevard Franklin-D.-Roosevelt
* Boulevard Général-George-S.-Patton
* Rue de la Grève
*Place des Martyrs
*Rue du Plébiscite
*Rue General-Major-Lunsford-E.-Oliver
*Rue George-C.-Marshall

<doc id="1019708" wikidata="Q1670786" url="?curid=1019708" title="Young Justice">
<text>Young Justice is a fictional DC Comics superhero team consisting of teenaged heroes. The team was formed in 1998 when DC&#x27;s usual teen hero group, the Teen Titans, had become adults and changed their name to the Titans. Like the original &quot;Teen Titans&quot;, &quot;Young Justice&quot; was centered on three previously established teen heroes: Superboy, Robin, and Impulse, but grew to encompass most teenaged heroes in the DC Universe.

In the 2003 mini-series &quot;Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day&quot;, both groups disbanded and members of each formed two new teams of Teen Titans and Outsiders.

The series was revived in 2019 under the Wonder Comics imprint for teen readers, reuniting most of the original core cast.

==Fictional history==

Robin, Superboy, and Impulse first join in a one-shot, part of the &quot;GirlFrenzy&quot; Fifth week event, called &quot;Young Justice: The Secret&quot;, written by Todd DeZago, where they first encounter the mysterious superheroine Secret and free her from captivity of the DEO (Department of Extranormal Operations). They next appear together in the Justice League miniseries, &quot;World Without Grown-Ups&quot;, also written by DeZago, in which a magical being, commanded by new child villain Bedlam, moves all adults to an alternate world. This is when they first stumble upon the abandoned Justice League Cave in Happy Harbor (formerly called &quot;The Secret Sanctuary&quot;), which would later become their headquarters, re-christened the &quot;Justice Cave.&quot; After managing to thwart Bedlam&#x27;s adolescent paradise, the three boys agree that they were effective as a team and should officially band together as their own group.

When the ongoing title, written by Peter David, begins in September 1998, the three heroes have formed a clubhouse in the Cave. However, in the first issue, they awaken the android superhero Red Tornado from a self-imposed dormancy; Red Tornado would remain a supporting character in the title, acting as a mentor/chaperone to the founding team, feeling that his interaction with the boisterous teens will help salvage what he felt was left of his humanity. In issue 4, the group doubles in number with the addition of three teen superheroines: the second Wonder Girl (Cassandra Sandsmark), struggling to make her mark as a serious crimefighter, the ethereal and mysterious Secret (Greta Hayes, but nicknamed &quot;Suzie&quot; throughout most of the series), and Arrowette (Cissie King-Jones), attempting to humiliate her estranged domineering mother, the retired Miss Arrowette, by outshining her own brief super-heroic career. The stern and calculating Robin and the cocky and brazen Superboy occasionally compete for leadership; Robin is the one most commonly deferred to, though routinely teased by the others for what they consider his over-pragmatic nature, initially refusing to share his face or his true identity with any of them; a slightly jealous Wonder Girl overcomes her initial distaste for Arrowette and the two quickly become close friends; Wonder Girl&#x27;s schoolgirl crush on Superboy slowly begins to develop into genuine feelings shared between the two of them for one another; the team as a whole usually find the ability to trust in Impulse in spite of his whimsical character, yielding mixed results in various adventures; Secret, amnesiac to her true identity and history, is accepted for her innocent nature and forms a kinship with Wonder Girl and Arrowette, and later on in the series she develops a crush on Robin.

In their earliest adventures, the team mostly faced threats of varying severity; from the Mighty Endowed, an archaeologist named Nina Dowd (&quot;N. Dowd&quot;) who was transformed into a top-heavy feline figure too well endowed to support her own weight, to the deadly Harm. This man was an aspiring super-villain bent on battling and killing young metahumans for &quot;practice,&quot; later revealed to be Secret&#x27;s adopted brother in her previous life. Harm was responsible for her death and subsequent transfiguration. Young Justice discovers and &quot;adopts&quot; the Super-Cycle, a sentient vehicle capable of flight from New Genesis which they come to rely as their primary means of transportation. They are also persistently badgered by APES (All Purpose Enforcement Squad) Agents Donald Fite and Ishido Maad (loosely coined as &quot;Fite n&#x27; Maad&quot;). Writer Peter David, in a column about jokes he was not allowed to do, revealed that he had considered naming the two &quot;Nuck&quot; and &quot;Futz&quot;, but had been overruled by DC editors who did not like the combination &quot;Nuck&#x27;n&#x27;Futz&quot;. These men are acting on behalf of the Department of Extranormal Operations. They are seeking to recapture Secret; instead she leads a revolt that frees all of their other captives.

Red Tornado faces losing custody of his adoptive daughter, Traya. He flees the state with her, placing the team in a legal predicament because they assisted him. Traya is eventually returned to her mother after she is awakened from her coma by Secret, while Red Tornado is temporarily impounded. Arrowette suffers the murder of a close friend at her school and nearly kills the attacker. This places the team in further trouble with the government. It helps stir an already-ensuing media blitz aimed at all young super-heroes turning public sway towards the opinion that all teenage heroes are too reckless and more of an endangerment to society than a protection. This situation is further exacerbated when Young Justice, in an attempt to free Secret who had been taken captive by the DEO, inadvertently defaces Mount Rushmore. These events quickly give rise to building tensions between Young Justice and their adult counterparts in the Justice League, and a rising amount of petitioning in Washington against &quot;underage&quot; crime-fighters, spurred by the newly formed team of Golden Age sidekicks, Old Justice. Remorseful over her lack of restraint, and feeling burnt-out on a life that was mostly forced on her by her mother in the first place, Cissie retires as Arrowette and quits the team in the midst of these events, much to the dismay of her best friend Wonder Girl (who would go on to continually pester Cissie for some time later about rejoining the team). In the midst of these events, unbeknownst to the team, Superboy is taken captive and detained by the villainous Agenda, while his villainous counterpart, Match, is implanted within the team. Shortly after, they meet and are aided by a mysterious new heroine, the enigmatic Empress, later revealed to be Anita Fite, daughter of Donald Fite, one of the agents who had previously plagued the team up through this point. The team soon becomes targeted by a federally-operated group of metahumans known as the Pointmen, and is forced to flee their headquarters in Happy Harbor, now officially wanted by the government.

===Sins of Youth===
These developments spin off into one of the series&#x27; key events, &quot;Young Justice: Sins of Youth&quot; fifth week event in March 2000 (takes place between &quot;Young Justice&quot; issues #19 and 20), as the team&#x27;s troubles come to a head when all members of Young Justice, the Justice League, the Justice Society, the Titans, and several other costumed heroes are, in a catastrophic chain of events involving Klarion the Witch Boy, are either aged to adulthood or de-aged to adolescence, thanks to the machinations of the Agenda, headed by former wife of Lex Luthor, Contessa Erica Alexandra Del Portenza, who had been manipulating events from the beginning in an attempt to discredit all costumed super-heroes, young and old alike, by targeting Young Justice and the teen heroes as the weakest link in the chain. During this crisis, as the heroes scatter to find a reversal to Klarion&#x27;s magic, the DCU is given a glimpse of the quality of heroism that may one day arise from its youngest generation of super-heroes (much to the surprise of many within the super-heroic community, as well as a few members of Young Justice themselves), as well as a glimpse of its senior generations in their teen years or younger. Also during the event, or as indirect results of the event, Superboy&#x27;s girlfriend Tana Moon is murdered by an agent of the Agenda, marking a turning point in his life, Wonder Girl began to bloom into her role as a hero, even abandoning her wig. Jack Knight (Starman), impressed with the competence and intelligence he witnessed in the then-adult Courtney Whitmore, the second Star-Spangled Kid, would later pass his Cosmic Rod and the Starman mantle on to Courtney, spurring the precocious heroine to later become Stargirl. It also marked the transition between the original six and the new cast, with Empress joining right after this storyline and a newly de-aged Lobo, or Li&#x27;l Lobo, being created by it.

In the aftermath of these events, negative public opinion against the young crime-fighters subsides, and the team reconciles with their friends and mentors in the Justice League and with the government. Superboy temporarily loses his powers, but regains his ability to age normally (as a result from an earlier story arc in his own title, Kon-El was permanently suspended in age as a 16-year-old). The team re-locates its headquarters to an abandoned hotel in the Catskills and takes a temporary leave of absence to recuperate, allowing for a substitute team consisting of Beast Boy, Flamebird, Batgirl, Captain Marvel Jr., and Lagoon Boy to fill in for one issue, as they intervene in a battle royale between Klarion and Li&#x27;l Lobo.

When Cissie is selected to represent the United States in the archery games for the 2000 Summer Olympics at the encouragement of her mother, the team accompanies her to Australia and thwarts an effort to sabotage the games by the criminal nation of Zandia. Cissie, a natural-born marksman, wins the gold medal for the US, effectively gaining her celebrity status without the need of her heroic identity. They team up once again with Empress, finally learning her true identity, much to Anita&#x27;s chagrin. Young Justice quickly warms up to the young mystic and welcomes her within their ranks, though Cissie initially rejects Anita out of resentment towards feeling replaced.

The team later make an expedition to outer space at the behest of Doiby Dickles, former sidekick to Alan Scott, and former member of Old Justice, to free his previous homeworld Myrg from invading forces. In this adventure they encounter Li&#x27;l Lobo once again, who agrees to join them for the expectation of violence. Robin begrudgingly allows Young Justice to accept Lobo&#x27;s help in this instance, primarily out of a desire for any chance of evening their odds for success. After liberating Myrg and returning home (after yet another brief excursion to New Genesis, in which Secret meets and unwittingly strikes up a rapport with the despotic Darkseid), Lobo continues to exercise his presence with Young Justice and participating in their adventures for no real reason that anyone within the group can discern; he is never officially accepted as a member. He develops an attraction for Empress; a mildly interested but mostly apathetic Anita obliges to go on a date with him at one point.

===Our Worlds at War===
During 2001&#x27;s &quot;Our Worlds at War&quot; storyline, the universe is faced with the dual threat of impending annihilation at the hands of Imperiex and conquest/enslavement at the hands of Brainiac 13. Many tenuous alliances are formed, particularly between then-US President Lex Luthor and the Justice League, not to mention Earth and the dark world Apokolips. In the midst of intergalactic war, Young Justice is drafted into the combat strictly for search and rescue purposes. As a result of the aftermath of the &quot;&quot; storyline, in which Batman had been revealed to be keeping extensive and invasive dossiers on his teammates in the Justice League for purposes of neutralizing and subduing in the event of any of them going rogue, similar suspicions of Robin had begun to circulate amongst his teammates in Young Justice. When the team crash lands and is left stranded on Apokolips after Superboy took control of their shuttle in an attempt to rescue Steel from the Black Racer, tensions explode between Superboy and Robin and those suspicions are brought to light, leaving the team divided; Superboy, Wonder Girl, Impulse, and Cissie all express concerns regarding whether Robin is capable of doing the same thing to them, but Secret reaffirms her faith in Robin while Empress acknowledges Batman&#x27;s reasons for developing the strategies, with Lobo dismissing it as impossible for anyone to take him out so he doesn&#x27;t care. The group agree to put the matter aside for the time being as they attempt to get off of Apokolips.

The team quickly begins drawing enemy fire; Impulse is left shaken and temporarily traumatized when one of his super-speed &quot;scouts&quot; (vibrational &quot;clones&quot; Impulse learned to make of himself that could function independently for short time periods) is killed in the line of fire, giving the lackadaisical hero a harsh confrontation with his own mortality; Li&#x27;l Lobo is all but annihilated by Parademons, ultimately finished off by the Black Racer. The rest of the team is taken captive and put into the care of Granny Goodness, where she and her Female Furies subject them to various cruel forms of mental torture. Secret is taken to confer with Darkseid, who had taken an interest in the powerful, yet naive young heroine the last time they had met. Secret, who had recently begun to learn more about her powers and her connections with the afterlife and who had consequently began to ponder her true nature, is informed by Darkseid that she is &quot;evil.&quot; Young Justice eventually breaks free from Granny&#x27;s captivity and lashes out at their tormentors before making another desperate attempt at escape. Due to Li&#x27;l Lobo&#x27;s ability to replicate clones of himself for every drop of his blood spilled, the team is aided by an army of Lobo clones who are unleashed on the Apokoliptian forces, as they lash out against everyone and everything around them before turning on each other and killing one another off to the last surviving Lobo. The team finally makes good their escape from Apokolips in the midst of the chaos, with the help of one additional genetically inferior teenage Lobo that had remained hidden from the fight in their spaceship. Ashamed of his perceived inferiority and cowardice, this less imposing, less threatening Lobo renames himself &quot;Slo-Bo.&quot; The team, who had been listed as missing in action for some time finally return to Earth safely a few days after the Imperiex War had finally ended, collectively and individually jarred by their wartime experience.

In the aftermath of this adventure, for the first time frightened for his life, Impulse decides to quit the team, retiring from his super-hero life altogether. He is joined by Robin, who decides to sever ties with the team out of hurt feelings inflicted by teammates that he feels no longer trust him. After the loss of two founding members, they are joined by former Justice League mascot Snapper Carr, who agrees to assume Red Tornado&#x27;s mentoring position; with his own unique form of counsel, Snapper attempts to help the remaining members get their feet back on the ground. To re-bolster their ranks, the team soon recruits the older Ray as its newest member. Meanwhile, in an effort to help Secret come to terms with her tragic past and assuage her concerns over what she considers her &quot;true nature&quot;, Snapper arranges for Suzie to be taken in by the Spectre Hal Jordan in a mentoring capacity. The full details of her life and death are brought to light, as well as her role as a &quot;gatekeeper&quot; between the realm of the dead and the living. She is never shown divulging the information of her origin to her teammates, though she does supply them with her true name, Greta Hayes.

===World Without Young Justice===
All four series featuring Young Justice characters take part in the &quot;World Without Young Justice&quot; crossover in April 2002. The five-part story arc features old Young Justice opponent Bedlam from &quot;World Without Grown-Ups&quot; returning and once again recreating the world to suit his will. In this new reality, Young Justice consists of distorted, and in some cases amoral, parodies of their proper selves. Reunited with Bart Allen and Tim Drake, Young Justice manages to defeat Bedlam once again and restore reality to its rightful state.

With Young Justice once again in full force, the team decides to take a vote on who should become team leader, due to the feeling that despite Robin&#x27;s return, they question whether or not he deserves the position of leader, particularly in light of having quit the team so abruptly. In the end, Wonder Girl, having blossomed into a competent, level-headed heroine since her more awkward days hiding under her wig and goggles, and also having stuck with the team through thick and thin since close to its beginning, wins the election, and is given full blessings from former leader, Robin. Though Robin loses his leadership position, he continues to act as the team&#x27;s chief tactical mind, similar to Batman&#x27;s role with the JLA.

Wonder Girl assumes responsibility just in time to lead Young Justice to its next challenge. When Empress&#x27;s father is kidnapped and murdered by her super-villain grandfather, Agua Sin Gaaz, a prominent and powerful resident of the nation of Zandia, populated primarily with criminals, Young Justice assembles a legion of young heroes from across the DCU to assist in Sin Gaaz&#x27;s apprehension, including Stargirl, Jakeem Thunder, Lagoon Boy, Kid Devil, the Wonder Twins, and dozens of others. The assault on Zandia is met with an equally staggering assemblage of villains, resulting in an all-out battle royale. Empress confronts Sin Gaaz, but the villain is defeated and murdered by Arrowette – not Cissie, but her mother, Bonnie King-Jones, passing off as her own daughter. After Sin Gaaz&#x27;s demise, Empress is left in the care of two newborn infants suddenly created in his lab – the reincarnations of Anita&#x27;s own deceased parents.

The final storyline of the series witnesses the building subplot of Secret&#x27;s dark side coming to light. As Young Justice prepares to boost its image and expand by agreeing to star in a new reality show, Secret learns that her father is to soon be sentenced to death for the murder of her brother, Harm. She pleas for her teammates help in breaking him out of jail. When they refuse and later condemn her after freeing her father anyway, a betrayed Secret erupts in a fit of anger, violently attacks her friends, and agrees to leave Earth for Apokolips with Darkseid, at last giving in to his offer of tutelage. With Secret now in service to one of humanity&#x27;s greatest adversaries, and now totally in control of her vast power linking her to the abyss, the team apprehensively prepares to face their former friend. Impulse confesses his fear over his own lack of regard for his own life; Empress, now left to care for two newborn infants faces the possibility that her career as a super-hero may be over; Slo-Bo, with his physically inferior body, is slowly beginning to degrade; Cissie at last establishes peace with her mother; and Superboy and Wonder Girl finally confess their feelings for one another. When Secret finally attacks in a final confrontation condemning her friends for failing her, Robin admits their failings and appeals to Secret&#x27;s reason and inner goodness. Upon breaking down in tears and giving up the people she had previously consumed, Secret is confronted and scorned by an angered Darkseid. Slo-Bo attempts to attack the New God but is seemingly obliterated by a shot of Darkseid&#x27;s Omega Effect. Darkseid then uses his Omega Effect to strip Secret of her immortality and her power, rendering her &quot;normal&quot; as punishment for her betrayal; ironically, being &quot;normal&quot; was all Secret really yearned for all along. The last page reveals that Slo-Bo, rather than being killed by Darkseid, was instead flung into the far future, where he is (consciously) imprisoned as a statue in the Young Justice of the 853rd Century&#x27;s cave headquarters.

===Graduation Day===
The team is next seen in the &quot;Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day&quot; mini-series. A casual business meeting with a potential money source and the Titans goes awry when the two teams are attacked by the android Indigo, leaving Empress, Argent, Cyborg, and Jesse Quick hospitalized. The Ray is absent, but unmentioned. Upon further pursuance of the situation, the unwitting android activates a dormant Superman replicate android that had been left in the care of STAR Labs. The Superman android turns out to be hostile, and the resulting clash leads to the deaths of long-time Titans Lilith and Donna Troy (who, unknown to the Titans and Young Justice, was resurrected by the Titans of Myth), leaving both teams devastated. Wonder Girl, enraged at being unable to save either of them and particularly saddened by the loss of her friend and predecessor, has come to see herself and Young Justice ineffective as heroes, and turns away from her teammates. Young Justice finally dissolves. The kids, choosing to shoulder the weight of the responsibility for the fiasco, drop out of communication with one another until Wonder Girl, Robin, Superboy, and Impulse are brought back together by Cyborg, Starfire, and Beast Boy to form the new Teen Titans.

Meanwhile, Ray joins the new Freedom Fighters, while Snapper Car joins Checkmate. Secret, without powers retires from the superhero world to attend school with Cissie and Wonder Girl. Empress also goes into semi-retirement but would occasionally re-don her costume during the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, and during a brief team-up with Supergirl. She apparently came out of retirement in &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, joining Mas y Menos and Sparx in forming a Teen Titans spin-off known as the &quot;League of Titans&quot;. The League is easily defeated by Mirror Master and Arthur Light, and are last seen recuperating at the Hall of Justice. Red Tornado meanwhile later rejoins the Justice League. After over a year of inactivity, Lagoon Boy is recruited by Cyborg for his new Titans East roster, only to be severely injured and rendered comatose on the team&#x27;s first training exercise. The Super-Cycle meanwhile has disappeared without a trace.

A short Young Justice story is added into &quot;Teen Titans&quot; #50, where Wonder Girl and Robin remembering their old Young Justice days, and in particular the newly deceased Bart Allen. The pair would share stories about how Bart would impulsively make mistakes such as causing an international incident in Gorilla City, failing to realize his teammates were badly-made robots and publishing the team&#x27;s secret identities in a Young Justice comic book.

===Unofficial reunions===
In the &quot;Wonder Girl&quot; mini series, the then living remaining core members of Young Justice, consisting of Wonder Girl, Robin, Empress, and Arrowette (Secret was absent due to her powers being gone and Superboy and Kid Flash had not yet been resurrected), along with Hercules, teamed up to defeat Granny Goodness and her Female Furies.

In the first six issues of &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; (collected in &quot;Superboy: The Boy of Steel&quot;), Wonder Girl, Red Robin (Tim Drake), and Kid Flash come together in Smallville to offer Superboy support after an incident with Lex Luthor.

===Wonder Comics===
In the years following DC&#x27;s The New 52 and DC Rebirth soft reboots, a new &quot;Young Justice&quot; series was launched in January 2019 as part of DC&#x27;s teen-oriented Wonder Comics imprint, written by the imprint&#x27;s curator Brian Michael Bendis. The first story arc featured the reunion of original team members Robin (Tim Drake), Superboy (Conner Kent), Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark) and Impulse (Bart Allen). They were joined by new team members Teen Lantern (Keli Quintela), a young girl who managed to hack a Green Lantern Corps power battery; Jinny Hex, the descendant of Jonah Hex; and Amethyst, Princess of Gemworld. This series saw the reintroduction of the pre-New-52 Conner Kent and Bart Allen to the main DC continuity, apart from the latter&#x27;s one-page reappearance in &quot;The Flash&quot; vol. 5 #51.

The team initially came together in Metropolis, when responding to an incursion from the forces of the Dark Lord Opal from Gemworld. Being drawn into Gemworld after the retreating invaders, the team were reunited with Superboy – who had been marooned on Gemworld for some time, and so had been unaffected by the cosmic reboots that had altered continuity since his last appearance – and introduced to Amethyst. After defeating the Dark Lord Opal, the team were set adrift in the multiverse and travelled through a variety of alternate realities in their attempt to get home. While on Earth-Three, on Impulse&#x27;s encouragement Robin took up the new codename Drake.

Upon returning to their home reality, the team encountered Naomi McDuffie, main character of the Wonder Comics series &quot;Naomi&quot;. Soon afterwards, Superboy was again sent to an alternate reality by the villainous S.T.A.R. Labs scientists who had initially sent him to Gemworld, this time ending up on Skartaris. In their effort to find out what happened to him, Young Justice teamed up with Naomi, along with Jayna &amp; Zan from &quot;Wonder Twins&quot; and Miguel Montez &amp; Summer Pickens from &quot;Dial H For Hero&quot; (both series also under the Wonder Comics imprint).

David F Walker became co-writer of the series as of issue #13. More allies were recruited for the mission to recover Superboy, including Spoiler, Aqualad (Jackson Hyde), Sideways, and original team member Arrowette. After the defeat of the S.T.A.R. Labs scientists and Superboy&#x27;s return, the team decided to accept all their allies on the mission as new members, transforming Young Justice from a self-contained team into a broadly-connected network of young superheroes.

==All-ages series==

A second, unrelated &quot;Young Justice&quot; title was launched by DC in 2011, set within the continuity of the &quot;Young Justice&quot; animated series (placing it on Earth-16 in the DC Multiverse). The series was part of DC&#x27;s kid-friendly all-ages line, which also included comics based on other popular cartoons such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;Ben 10&quot;. Issue #0 was written by TV series writers Greg Weisman and Kevin Hopps. Issues 1–6 and the 2011 Free Comic Book Day Special were written by Art Baltazar and Franco Aureliani. As of issue #7 TV series writers Greg Weisman and Kevin Hopps resumed writing the series. Mike Norton provided the art for issues 0–4 and the 2011 Free Comic Book Day Special, while Christopher Jones became the new artist as of issue #5. The series concluded with issue #25, less than one month before the animated series&#x27; apparent cancellation.

The series featured a team consisting of teen superheroes Superboy, Aqualad, Artemis, Robin, Miss Martian and Kid Flash. Issues #0-19 were set during the events of the first season of the animated series, with stories taking place between episodes. The final six-part story arc &quot;Invasion&quot;, published over issues #20-25, was set one month before the beginning of the second season.

Issues #5 and #6 of the title feature the kids on a camping trip in homage to issue #7 of the original series, which featured a similar storyline.

In advance of the animated series returning for its third season after a six-year hiatus, the comic was also revived for a one-shot story titled &quot;Torch Songs&quot; intended to lead into the new season&#x27;s first episode. The story was ultimately released digitally in two chapters, over the two days preceding the third-season premiere. Greg Weisman returned as writer and Christopher Jones as artist.

==In other media==

* On November 26, 2010, the &quot;Young Justice&quot; animated television series pilot premiered in the United States on Cartoon Network. Despite its title, the show is not an adaptation of the &quot;Young Justice&quot; series of comics, but rather, an adaptation of the entire DC Universe with a focus on young superheroes. The television series is based on a concept of a cross between &quot;Teen Titans&quot; and &quot;Young Justice&quot;, rather than a direct adaptation of one of them. It draws influences from the 1960s &quot;Teen Titans&quot; run and the 1990s &quot;Young Justice&quot; run, in addition to subsequent comics. The line-up includes a version of Superboy, the Dick Grayson incarnation of Robin, the Wally West incarnation of Kid Flash, Miss Martian, Artemis, and a newly created version of Aqualad. Other members join and make appearances on an intermittent or permanent basis. On April 25, 2017, Warner Brothers announced that the third season would be titled &quot;Young Justice: Outsiders&quot;.
* The animated series incarnation of Young Justice appears in the &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; episode &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Serious&quot;.

==Awards==
The 1,000,000 issue of the series was a part of the &quot;DC One Million&quot; storyline, which was a top votegetter for the Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide Fan Award for Favorite Story for 1999. Said story involved Justice Legion T, an 853rd Century trio of young heroes: Robin the Toy Wonder (a robotic Robin), Superboy OMAC (One Millionth Actual Clone, a play on the classic OMAC character) and Impulse (a Speed Force-influenced energy being, presumably either personified by the spirits of previous persons who used the heroic name, or else the living embodiment of random thoughts lost in the Speed Force, but most probably a time misplaced Scout of the original Impulse).

==Collected editions==
Additionally, selected &quot;Young Justice&quot; comics were reprinted as part of the &quot;DC Comics Presents: Young Justice&quot; series. Each issue was square-bound with approximately 100 pages each, in the &quot;100-Page Spectacular&quot; format.
* &quot;DC Comics Presents: Young Justice&quot; #1 (published October 2010): collects &quot;JLA: World Without Grown-Ups&quot; #1–2
*&quot;DC Comics Presents: Young Justice&quot; #2 (published November 2010): collects &quot;Young Justice Secret Files and Origins&quot; #1, &quot;Young Justice in No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, and &quot;Young Justice: The Secret&quot;.
*&quot;DC Comics Presents: Young Justice&quot; #3 (published December 2010): collects &quot;Secret Origins 80-Page Giant&quot; #1, &quot;Young Justice&quot; #7

<text>Jorge Duílio Lima Menezes (born March 22, 1939) is a Brazilian popular musician, performing under the stage name Jorge Ben Jor since the 1980s, though commonly known by his former stage name Jorge Ben (). Performing in a samba style that also explored soul, funk, rock and bossa nova sounds, Ben has recorded such well-known songs as &quot;Chove Chuva&quot;, &quot;Mas Que Nada&quot;, &quot;Ive Brussel&quot; and &quot;Balança Pema&quot;. His music has been covered by artists such as Caetano Veloso, Sérgio Mendes, Miriam Makeba, Soulfly and Marisa Monte.

Ben&#x27;s broad-minded and original approach to samba led him through participation in some of Brazilian popular music&#x27;s most important musical movements, such as bossa nova, Jovem Guarda, and Tropicália, with the latter period defined by his albums &quot;Jorge Ben&quot; (1969) and &quot;Fôrça Bruta&quot; (1970). He has been called &quot;the father of samba rock&quot;, by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine. According to American music critic Robert Christgau, Ben and his contemporary Gilberto Gil were &quot;always ready to go further out on a beat than the other samba/bossa geniuses&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Born Jorge Duílio Lima Menezes in Rio de Janeiro, he first took the stage name Jorge Ben after his mother&#x27;s name (Sílvia Saint Ben Lima, Brazilian-born of Ethiopian origin) but in the 1980s changed it to Jorge Ben Jor (commonly written Benjor).

Jorge Ben obtained his first pandeiro (Brazil&#x27;s most popular type of tambourine) when he was thirteen, and two years later, was singing in a church choir. He also took part as a pandeiro player in the blocos of Carnaval, and from eighteen years of age, he began performing at parties and nightclubs with the guitar given to him by his mother. He was given the nickname &quot;Babulina&quot; after his enthusiastic pronunciation of rockabilly singer Ronnie Self&#x27;s song &quot;Bop-A-Lena&quot;. Was introduced to Tim Maia by Erasmo Carlos. It was in 1963 at one of those clubs in which he performed that Jorge&#x27;s musical career took off; he came on stage and sang &quot;Mas, que Nada!&quot; to a small crowd that happened to include an executive from the recording company, Philips. One week later, Jorge Ben&#x27;s first single was released.

The hybrid rhythms that Jorge employed brought him some problems at the start of his career, when Brazilian music was split between the rockier sounds of the Jovem Guarda and traditional samba with its complex lyrics. However, as that phase in Brazilian pop music history passed and bossa nova became better known throughout the world, Ben rose to prominence.

Holdings both television programs O Fino da Bossa and Jovem Guarda from Rede Record, after being reprimanded by the production of &quot;O Fino da Bossa&quot;, chose to participate in the Jovem Guarda, soon after, joined the program Divino, Maravilhoso from TV Tupi, presented by Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil.

Jorge Ben&#x27;s first public appearances were in small festivals organised by his friends, where bossa nova and rock and roll predominated. As with most musicians of the time, Ben was initially influenced by João Gilberto even though he was quite innovative in his own right. Outside of Brazil, the song is better known in cover versions by Sérgio Mendes and the Tamba Trio. The song has also been reinterpreted by prominent jazz artists including Ella Fitzgerald, Oscar Peterson, Dizzy Gillespie and Al Jarreau; as well as other samba artists of the time, such as Elza Soares. His musical work has been vastly sampled by music producers and DJs in a variety of genres such as jazz funk, disco, and acid jazz.

Ben composed song &quot;Mas, que Nada!&quot; in 1963. Ben&#x27;s 1963 debut album &quot;Samba Esquema Novo&quot; was met with great acclaim from fans, and encouraged Philips to capitalize on the success with immediate follow-up albums. The label pressured Ben to hastily record songs imitative of his debut, along with cover songs, resulting in the three albums within the span of 18 months and a strain on the singer&#x27;s relationship with Philips. He left the label after his 1965 album &quot;Big Ben&quot;.

===Success===
In 1969, Jorge Ben released his eponymous album amid the excitement of the cultural and musical Tropicália movement. The album featured Trio Mocotó as his backing band, who would go on to launch a successful career on the back of their association with Ben. The album was noted for &quot;País Tropical&quot;, one of his most famous compositions, although it would be Wilson Simonal who would take his recording of the song to the top of the charts in Brazil that same year. Instead, the song &quot;Charles, Anjo 45&quot;, also from the self-titled album, would become Ben&#x27;s biggest self-performed chart hit of the year. Ben recorded &quot;Taji Mahal&quot; in 1972.

Jorge Ben released his most esoteric and experimental albums in the 1970s, most notably &quot;A Tábua de Esmeralda&quot; in 1974 and &quot;Solta o Pavão&quot; in 1975. The following year he released one of his most popular albums, &quot;África Brasil&quot; (1976), a fusion of funk and samba which relied more on the electric guitar than previous efforts. This album also features a remake of his previously released song &quot;Taj Mahal.&quot; With its commercial success and sustained radio play, the melody made its way into the 1979 hit &quot;Da Ya Think I&#x27;m Sexy?&quot; by Rod Stewart. Ben sued for plagiarism and Stewart settled the lawsuit and donated the single’s royalties to UNICEF. 

In 1989, Jorge changed his recording label as well as his artistic name, becoming Jorge Benjor (or Jorge Ben Jor). At the time, it was said that there were numerous reasons for his change in name; other sources say it was in response to an incident where some of his royalties accidentally went to American guitarist George Benson.

===Recent career===

In 2002, Jorge Ben contributed to the critically acclaimed Red Hot + Riot, a compilation CD created by the Red Hot Organization in tribute to the music and work of Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, which raised money for various charities devoted to raising AIDS awareness and fighting the disease. He collaborated with hip-hop artists Dead Prez, Talib Kweli, and Bilal to remake Fela Kuti&#x27;s famous song &quot;Shuffering and Shmiling&quot; for the CD.

Ben was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Latin Recording Academy in 2005. A year later, a remake of Ben&#x27;s &quot;Mas, que Nada!&quot; became an international chart hit for Sérgio Mendes with The Black Eyed Peas after being used by Nike in a global TV advertisement during the 2006 FIFA World Cup; this remake (the second time Mendes had covered the track) reached the Top 10 in several European countries, including the UK and Germany, in addition to reaching Number 1 in the Netherlands.

Jorge Ben is also a big fan of Flamengo, a Brazilian football club, located in Rio de Janeiro, which counts Zico, Junior and Leandro among their former star players. Ben&#x27;s interest in football carries over to his music, as many of his songs deal with the subject, such as &quot;Flamengo&quot;, &quot;Camisa 10 da Gávea&quot;, &quot;Ponta De Lança Africano (Umbabarauma)&quot;, &quot;Zagueiro&quot;, &quot;Fio Maravilha&quot;, and &quot;A Loba Comeu o Canário&quot;.

On July 7, 2007, he performed at the Brazilian leg of Live Earth in Rio de Janeiro.

<doc id="1019715" wikidata="Q336899" url="?curid=1019715" title="George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton">
<text>George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton, (17 January 1709 – 22 August 1773), known between 1751 and 1756 as Sir George Lyttelton, 5th Baronet, was a British statesman. As an author himself, he was also a supporter of other writers and as a patron of the arts made an important contribution to the development of 18th-century landscape design.

==Life==
Lord Lyttelton was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Lyttelton, 4th Baronet, of Frankley, in the County of Worcester, by his wife Christian, daughter of Sir Richard Temple, 3rd Baronet. Educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, he afterwards went on grand tour, visiting Europe with his tutor. It was during this time that he started publishing his early works in both poetry and prose. Even after he was elected to Parliament in 1735, he continued to publish from time to time. In 1742 he married Lucy, daughter of Hugh Fortescue, and following her death in 1747 he later married Elizabeth, daughter of Field Marshal Sir Robert Rich, 4th Baronet, in 1749. He died in August 1773, aged 64, and was succeeded as baron by his eldest son, Thomas. Though Samuel Johnson&#x27;s biographical notice of Lyttelton is characterised by a conspicuous show of dislike, it diverges at the end into a long description of his exemplary death and the plain inscription he asked to have added to his first wife&#x27;s monument in St John the Baptist Church, Hagley.

==Political career==
Lyttelton was Member of Parliament (MP) for Okehampton from 1735 to 1756 and, as one of Cobham&#x27;s Cubs during the 1730s, opposed the Prime Minister Robert Walpole. He served as secretary to Frederick, Prince of Wales from 1737, and then, after Walpole&#x27;s fall, as a Commissioner of the Treasury in 1744. That year too he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Lyttelton was made a Privy Councillor in 1754 and in the following year became briefly Chancellor of the Exchequer, but performed poorly in that role. In 1756 he was raised to the peerage as Lord Lyttelton, Baron of Frankley in the County of Worcester, and continued to speak in the House of Lords until the year before he died.

Lyttelton was later described as &quot;an amiable, absent-minded man, of unimpeachable integrity and benevolent character, with strong religious convictions and respectable talents&quot;, but ultimately as &quot;a poor practical politician&quot;. His political opponent Lord Hervey spitefully characterised his performance as a speaker as &quot;a great flow of words that were always uttered in a lulling monotony, and the little meaning they had to boast of was generally borrowed from the commonplace maxims and sentiments of moralists, philosophers, patriots, and poets, crudely imbibed, half digested, ill put together, and confusedly refunded&quot;.

==Poetry and patronage==

Lord Lyttelton was a friend and supporter of Alexander Pope in the 1730s and of Henry Fielding in the 1750s; the latter dedicated his novel &quot;Tom Jones&quot; to Lyttelton. He had written his &quot;Epistle to Mr. Pope, from a young gentleman at Rome&quot; while still on the European tour, advising him to abandon satire for a patriotic theme more worthy of his greatness. Later on the poem was used to preface editions of Pope&#x27;s work.

Throughout his life, he acted as a friendly patron of poets. James Thomson, for whom Lyttelton eventually arranged a pension, was a frequent visitor to Hagley Hall. Joseph Warton he appointed his domestic chaplain and it was at his suggestion that David Mallet was made undersecretary to the Prince of Wales.

Lyttelton&#x27;s own poetic reputation was guaranteed continuity by his work being included in the collection of English poets prefaced by Johnson&#x27;s Lives. Variously annotated and augmented, the collection appeared in succeeding editions into the start of the 19th century. The monody &quot;To the Memory of a Lady lately Deceased&quot;, written on the death of his first wife, had an even longer lasting reputation. Though Thomas Gray found &quot;parts of it too stiff and poetical&quot;, he especially praised the fourth stanza as &quot;truly tender and elegiac&quot;. The poem was alluded to or parodied by others well into the 19th century, particularly the invocation of the &quot;shades of Hagley&quot; in the fifth stanza. Anna Seward, in answer to a correspondent who preferred Lyttelton&#x27;s ode to the newly fashionable sonnet, ingeniously rearranged the lines of the poem into a series of sonnets, in which the &quot;shades of Hagley&quot; passage headed the second. And William Gladstone acknowledged that his &quot;Church Principles&quot; was &quot;completed beneath the shades of Hagley&quot; as late as 1840.

Despite his long political career, it was as a poet that Lyttelton was chiefly remembered in the 19th century. But he was author also of many works in prose, chiefly historical and theological. Two, however, are distinguished by their humour. &quot;Letters from a Persian in England, to his Friend at Ispahan&quot; (1735) ironically comments on the idiosyncrasies of the time from the naïve point of view of an outsider. On attending a wedding ceremony in &quot;one of their Mosques&quot;, for example, the visitor remarks that &quot;Marriage here is esteemed a Religious Ceremony, and that I believe is one Reason among others why so little Regard is paid to it&quot;. Oliver Goldsmith was later to borrow the same approach for his Chinese philosopher in &quot;Letters from a Citizen of the World to his Friends in the East&quot; (1760). There were, nevertheless, French models for both in the &quot;Lettres Persanes&quot; of Montesquieu (1721) and the &quot;Lettres Chinoises&quot; (1735) of Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d&#x27;Argens, both of which had been translated soon after into English.

Another work with prior French counterparts was Lyttelton&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues of the Dead&quot; (1760). Though these had Classical precedents, the more immediate models were François Fénelon&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues des morts anciens et modernes&quot; and Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle&#x27;s &quot;Nouveaux Dialogues des morts&quot;, which had also appeared in popular English translations as &quot;Dialogues of the Dead&quot;. The themes treated in Lyttelton&#x27;s are political, literary and philosophical, although the characters sometimes stray from their expected role. Joseph Addison and Jonathan Swift&#x27;s conversation is of politics, while Charles XII of Sweden proposes to Alexander the Great an alliance against Alexander Pope for insulting them both in a satire. Included among these conversations were three that Lyttleton had encouraged the bluestocking leader Elizabeth Montagu to write (Dialogues 26–8).

All of Lyttelton&#x27;s writing was collected shortly after his death by his nephew, G. E. Ayscough. In 1791 an edition of his poems appeared in Germany accompanied by J. G. Weigel&#x27;s prose translations. During his lifetime Lyttelton&#x27;s &quot;Observations on the Conversion and Apostleship of St. Paul&quot; was translated into French in 1750 by Jean Deschamps (1707–67) and again in 1754 by the Abbé Antoine Guénée (1717–1803); his &quot;Dialogues of the Dead&quot; was also translated into French in 1760 as &quot;Dialogues des morts&quot; by Élie de Joncourt (1697–1765) and Jean Deschamps.

==Hagley Hall and grounds==

Lyttelton spent many years and a fortune developing Hagley Hall and its park, which contained many follies as well as memorials to the poets Milton, Pope, Thomson and the neighbouring landscaper William Shenstone. Also included among the latter was a &#x27;druid&#x27;s temple&#x27; of standing stones commemorating Ossian that Lyttelton had erected outside his grounds on nearby Clent Hill. The hall itself was designed by Sanderson Miller and is the last of the great Neo-Palladian houses to be built in England.
