<text>Strikes can be offensive moves in professional wrestling, that can sometimes be used to set up an opponent for a hold or for a throw. There are a wide variety of strikes in pro wrestling, and many are known by several different names. Professional wrestlers frequently give their finishers new names. Occasionally, these names become popular and are used regardless of the wrestler performing the technique.

Professional wrestling contains a variety of punches and kicks found in martial arts and other fighting sports; the moves listed below are more specific to wrestling itself. Many of the moves below can also be performed from a raised platform (the top rope, the ring apron, etc.); these are called aerial variations. Moves are listed under general categories whenever possible.

==Body press==
A maneuver that involves a wrestler attacking with the core of the body. It is executed from an upright, running position using momentum and weight to run over the opponent.

===Body avalanche===
The wrestler takes a short charge into an opponent in the corner of the ring without leaving the feet as they open both arms just before reaching the opponent, resulting in hitting with the chest and abdominal area while throwing both arms inward as in a bearhug, crushing the opponent into the turnbuckle. This is normally used by bigger, heavier wrestlers.

====Stinger splash====
A variation innovated by, popularized by, and named after Sting. It involves the wrestler trapping the opponent in a corner. Then the wrestler charges at the opponent, usually from the opposite corner, launching themselves and sandwiching the opponent between them and the turnbuckle while grabbing hold of the top rope.

===Thesz press===
This move, originally called a flying body scissors, was innovated by, popularized and subsequently named after Lou Thesz, sees the attacking wrestler jumping toward a standing opponent, knocking them over their back, sitting on their waist and pinning them in a body scissors. It was initially developed by Thesz as a legitimate move and has since been seen in modern submission grappling contests. A variation, popularized by Stone Cold Steve Austin, is done in reverse; the attacking wrestler performs the Thesz press on a charging wrestler from a standing position, then instead of pinning them, they attack them with mounted punches.

===Vertical press===
Also known as vertical splash body press, this variation is made by a charging wrestler (usually standing on the second or top rope) against a standing opponent, landing on their chest and shoulders while remaining upright. The wrestler employs the momentum to bring their opponent down to the mat into a seated senton.

==Chop==
A chop is a strike to the opponent&#x27;s neck, shoulders or chest with the edge of a hand.

===Backhand chop===

Also known as a knife edge chop, back-hand slice or , is the act of a wrestler slice-chopping the chest of the opponent using an upward backhand swing. Many wrestlers, especially &quot;brawlers&quot; and Japanese wrestlers, use this maneuver, and some crowds (especially American wrestling crowds) respond with a &quot;Woooo!&quot; noise in honor of Ric Flair, who popularized the move.

====Cross chop====
A double variation of the aforementioned chop, the wrestler lunges forward or jumps forward in a pressing fashion while crossing arms forming an &quot;X&quot;, hitting both sides of the opponent&#x27;s neck.

====Spinning knife edge chop====
This variation sets the wrestler spinning 180 or full 360Â° striking the opponent&#x27;s chest with a backhand chop.

===Kesagiri chop===
A downward diagonal attack to the side of the opponent&#x27;s neck or shoulder. The words &quot;kesa&quot; and &quot;giri&quot; in Japanese mean &quot;monk&#x27;s sash&quot; and &quot;cut&quot; respectively, and it is based on a legitimate defensive cut in traditional Japanese swordsmanship. This move is notably used by Kenta Kobashi.

====Mongolian chop====
The act of chopping both the opponent&#x27;s shoulders or sides of the neck in a downward swinging motion at the same time.

===Overhead chop===
The wrestler draws a hand back and hits the opponent vertically, atop the head. This move is primarily used by very tall wrestlers such as The Great Khali and Andre the Giant. It is also known as the tomahawk chop when used as part of a Native American gimmick, ostensibly due to it resembling a tomahawking motion. It was used as a finisher by Wahoo McDaniel, Chief Jay Strongbow and Tatanka, neither of whom were particularly tall.

===Throat thrust===
Also known as throat strike or sword stab. Similar to a conventional wrestling uppercut, the wrestler strikes the opponent&#x27;s throat upward with the tips of all five stiffed fingers of a supine hand. Abdullah the Butcher and Sgt. Slaughter were professional wrestlers known for its use as signature move.

===Thumb to the throat===
A simple maneuver derived from the thumb chokehold having a wrestler drawing back a hand and striking the windpipe with only the thumb, sometimes while holding the opponent by the nape. Performed by wrestlers like Ernie Ladd. Others include Umaga who dubbed the move the &quot;Samoan Spike&quot;; the move would later be used by his nephew Solo Sikoa. Bad Luck Fale uses a variation, what is preceded by a choke-lift, called &quot;Grenade&quot; Terry Gordy used this as a move alongside the Thumb choke hold which he dubbed the &quot;Oriental Spike&quot;. Dabba-Kato also used this move during his WWE main roster tenure as Commander Azeez called the &quot;Nigerian Nail&quot;.

==Clothesline==

===Double clothesline===
Any variant where instead of aiming at just one opponent, the attacking wrestler knocks down two opponents at once.

===Leaping clothesline===
Also known as a jumping clothesline or a flying clothesline, this move involves the attacking wrestler running toward an opponent, then leaping into the air before connecting with a clothesline. This variant&#x27;s use is commonly associated with The Undertaker, The Rock, and Roman Reigns. Another version sees an attacking wrestler leap up into the air and connecting with a clothesline onto an opponent leaning against the corner turnbuckle. 

The Rock also used a lesser variant of this move which saw him jump into the air at the exact moment the clothesline connected.

===Rebound clothesline===
As the opponent runs to the ropes on one side of the ring and rebounds against them, the attacker also runs to the same ropes and rebounds ensuring to be behind them and performs the clothesline as the opponent turns to face them.

==Double axe handle==
Also known as a double sledge or polish hammer after its most noted user, Ivan Putski. It sets an attacking wrestler clutching both hands together, swinging them downward hitting usually the opponent&#x27;s back, face, or top of the head. The many names of this move come from the attack mimicking the motion seen when people swing a sledgehammer or axe. There is also a top rope variation.

===Discus double axe handle===
The Wrestler performs a &quot;discus&quot; before clutching the hands together and delivering the double axe handle. It was used by Manabu Nakanishi as &quot;Yaijin Hammer&quot;.

==Drops==
Attacks in which an attacking wrestler jumps and falls down onto an opponent on the floor, striking with a specific part of the body.

===Chop drop===
The wrestler either falls forward, or jumps up and drops down, hitting a lying opponent with a kesagiri chop on the way down, usually landing in a kneeling position. Scotty 2 Hotty is best known for performing the chop drop which is always preceded by a routine that involves him hopping on one leg four times (as the crowd chants W-O-R-M), doing worm dance moves toward the opponent and swinging his arms just before hitting the chop drop, while his opponent lies face up and motionless on the mat.

===Elbow drop===

A move in which a wrestler jumps or falls down on an opponent driving their elbow into anywhere on the opponent&#x27;s body. A common elbow drop sees a wrestler raise one elbow before falling to one side and striking it across an opponent. The Rock popularized the high impact elbow drop and called it &quot;The People&#x27;s Elbow&quot;.

Another common elbow drop is the pointed elbow drop, that sees a wrestler raise both elbows up and drop directly forward dropping one, or both elbows onto the opponent.

====Corkscrew elbow drop====
This variation sees the wrestler raise one elbow before falling and simultaneously twisting around as falls to one side, striking the opponent with the elbow anywhere on the body. Sometimes, the wrestler will swing one leg around before the fall, gaining momentum for the corkscrew twist, first invented by &quot;Nature Boy&quot; Buddy Landel in 1984.

====Spinning headlock elbow drop====
This is any elbow drop which is performed after applying a headlock, the most widely known variation is the inverted facelock elbow drop, in which a wrestler puts the opponent into an inverted facelock, and then turns 180Â°, dropping the elbow across the opponent&#x27;s chest, driving them down to the mat. This was used by The Hurricane as the &quot;Eye of The Hurricane&quot;.

Another variation of this move sees the executor use the whole arm as a lariat instead of just the elbow, a side headlock from a jumping position variant can also be executed and twisted around into a sitout lariat. An inverted variation of this move sees the wrestler applying a front facelock before executing an elbow or a lariat to the back of the opponent&#x27;s head causing them to land on the mat or into a facebreaker where the wrestler places their knee in front of the opponent whilst when executing the move.

===Fist drop===

A wrestler performs a series of theatrics before jumping or falling down, driving a fist usually to the opponent&#x27;s forehead. Utilized by wrestlers including Jerry Lawler, Ted DiBiase, The Honky Tonk Man and John Cena, the latter of whom calls it the &quot;Five Knuckle Shuffle&quot;.

There is a snapping variation called karate fist drop that can be performed in a series, setting the wrestler besides a fallen opponent in a front stance known as &quot;Zenkutsu dachi&quot;. Then the wrestler drops to their rear leg&#x27;s knee delivering the fist at the opponent&#x27;s stomach, to rise up back again.

===Knee drop===

A move in which a wrestler jumps/falls down on an opponent, driving their knee into anywhere on the opponent&#x27;s body. It is often sold as more powerful if the wrestler bounces off the ropes first. Ric Flair, Randy Orton and Samoa Joe are examples of wrestlers who use this move. A variation sets the wrestler kneeling besides a fallen opponent, then performing a handstand to drive their knee to the opponent&#x27;s midsection.

===Leg drop===

A whole number of attacks in which a wrestler will jump/fall and land the back of their leg across an opponent&#x27;s chest, throat, or face. The running variation is used by Hulk Hogan as his finisher. Nia Jax also uses the running variation as one of her signature moves.

===Bionic elbow===

This move is a strike that is brought from a high position and travels vertically toward the floor, dropping the point of the elbow directly on the target. Often this will set an attacking wrestler bending an opponent over to deliver the elbow at the back of the opponent. This type of &quot;12-6 elbow&quot; is illegal in the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. This move was made famous by WWE Legend and Hall of Famer &quot;The American Dream&quot; Dusty Rhodes.

====Mounted elbow drop====
The wrestler approaches to a cornered opponent and climbs the second or top rope beside the opponent with a leg on each side. The wrestler then jumps down off the ropes, delivering a bionic elbow to the opponent&#x27;s head, neck (if the opponent&#x27;s neck is bent-down or sideways) or the shoulder.

===Elbow smash===

The wrestler makes a punching motion, but tucks their hand toward the chest so the elbow and forearm make contact. These can be used in place of punches, for striking with a clenched fist is illegal in most wrestling matches. A high impact version is used by Wade Barrett as his finishing move known as the &quot;Bull Hammer&quot;, also used by Karrion Kross known as the &quot;Kross Hammer&quot;.

====Rolling elbow====

==Facewash==

A maneuver aiming to hurt and/or humiliate an opponent, usually having them sitting or leaning the back of the head against the bottom corner turnbuckle, while the attacking wrestler repeatedly rubs their boot&#x27;s sole across their face. Once the maneuver is finished, the attacking wrestler can execute either a running kick, knee, drop or many other strikes that first sees them running toward or rebounding off the opposing ropes and charging at the fallen opponent. The moves most famous user is Shinjiro Otani who, throughout the entirety of his career, has used the move to theatrical affect. The move is also used by Samoa Joe and Matt Cardona, the latter of whom calls the move the &quot;Reboot&quot; (formerly known as the &quot;Broski Boot&quot; during his WWE tenure as Zack Ryder).

===Boot lace eye-rake===

===Forearm chops===
The wrestler clenches both fists and rises both arms, striking the sides of a cornered opponent&#x27;s head in a stabbing motion one forearm at a time. Popularized by Big Van Vader as the &quot;Vader Hammer&quot;.

===Forearm club===
An attacking wrestler uses one hand to take hold of an opponent by the nape or hair and leans them forward while extending the other arm in a raised position, clenching the fist before throwing the forearm forward down onto the opponent, clubbing the opponent across the back of the head/neck. This will often send the opponent to the mat front-first.

====Inverted forearm club====
A variation that sees the attacking wrestler take hold of an opponent and lean them backward to expose the chest, allowing the attacking wrestler to club the opponent and send them to the mat back-first.

The attacker may also throw additional strikes while maintaining their hold on the opponent.

====Flying forearm smash====
While running toward an opponent (usually after bouncing off the ropes), an attacking wrestler would leap up into the air, before connecting the forearm smash with their arm held at 90 degrees towards the opponent while remaining standing, falling chest first, or dropping into a kneeling/seated position after striking the opponent. Tito Santana used this move as a finisher as did Lex Luger who used the version that saw him using the inside flat portion of the forearm, held at a 90 degree angle, while falling to his knees or chest first. Shawn Michaels who uses this move as a signature which sees him use the falling version rolling onto his back after hitting the move to then perform a kip-up to sometimes set up for his &quot;Sweet Chin Music&quot;.

Some attackers would perform a springboard propelling themselves airborne to hit the standing opponent with the forearm. This version was popularized by A.J. Styles called &quot;Phenomenal Forearm&quot; as a finisher while Will Ospreay uses it as &quot;Pip Pip Cheerio&quot; as a signature.

==Headbutt==

An attack where a wrestler uses the head to strike a part of the opponent&#x27;s body, usually the forehead or chin (unlike a legitimate headbutt), to daze the target, counting on the superior hardness of the wrestler&#x27;s head and the momentum delivered to hurt the opponent without hurting the wrestler. Many wrestlers deliver a headbutt to an opponent&#x27;s head by holding the opponent&#x27;s head and delivering the headbutt to their own intervening hand instead, relying on it to cushion the blow.

===Battering ram===
The wrestler stands facing an upright opponent, lowers the head and then jumps or charges forward, driving the top of the head into the abdomen of the opponent. There is also a double-team version of the move.

====Reverse battering ram====

=== &quot;Bomaye&quot; ===
An attack where the wrestler stands behind or in front of the opponent and smashes their knee into the opponent&#x27;s back or head.

An attack where a charging wrestler jumps, striking both knees simultaneously into the head, chest, or back of the opponent. Harashima uses it as a finishing maneuver called &quot;Somato&quot;.

===Go 2 Sleep===

Sometimes abbreviated to &quot;GTS&quot;, this move sees a wrestler place an opponent in a fireman&#x27;s carry to drop the opponent in front of them. While the opponent is falling, the wrestler quickly lifts the left knee up toward the opponent&#x27;s face. Kenta, the innovator of the maneuver, also uses an inverted variation in which he lifts his opponent into an Argentine backbreaker rack, throwing the opponent forward and striking his knee in the back of the opponent&#x27;s head, called &quot;Ura Go 2 Sleep&quot; (&quot;Ura&quot; means inverted). CM Punk popularized the regular variant. As of 2022, the move was used by Logan Paul. Matt Riddle uses this move, calling it &quot;Bro to Sleep&quot;. Another version sees the wrestler kick the opponent&#x27;s face as done by Dakota Kai, who occasionally uses this move, calling it &quot;GTK&quot; (&quot;Go to Kick&quot;). There is also a variant of this move in which a wrestler holds up their opponent in an Argentine Backbreaker Rack and then pop them up like an inverted fireman&#x27;s carry takeover but then does a knee lift to their opponent. This variation is used by Sammy Guevara called &quot;GTH&quot; (&quot;Go to Hell&quot;) and Donovan Dijak called &quot;Feast your Eyes&quot;.
A modified version sees the wrestler performing the &quot;GTS&quot; but, rather than dropping the opponent to execute the move, throwing the legs of the opponent out backward to rotate them 180Â°, before performing the knee lift to the opponent&#x27;s face or lowering to a kneeling on a far knee to drop the opponent on whichever near knee. This version is best known as the &quot;TopSpin Facebuster&quot; used and named by Shane Helms. Another modified version sees a belly-to-back variation and the opponent is rotated in a full 360Â° motion as used by Zoey Stark, known as the &quot;Z-360&quot;.

===High knee===

An attack in which a wrestler charges toward the opponent, then jumps up and raises a knee to hit the opponent, usually into the side of the head.

====Running single leg high knee====
This variation, more akin to a running single leg dropkick, sees the attacking wrestler running and leaping toward the opponent while throwing one knee forward to strike the opponent&#x27;s face. This move was made popular in Japan by Kenta (&quot;Busaiku&quot; knee) and later adopted by Daniel Bryan. Wrestlers Kenny Omega, Buddy Matthews, and Matt Riddle use a bicycle variant of the knee strike.

===Kitchen sink===

===Knee lift===
An attack in which a wrestler brings the knee up to hit the opponent under the chin as if performing an uppercut. This can either be performed in mid clinch or with the attacking wrestler charging at a kneeling or bent over opponent, lifting the knee upward to strike underneath the jaw or the side of the head. A double variation sets a wrestler standing in front of the opponent, then while performing the mid clinch, leaping to throw both knees upward to strike the opponent&#x27;s chin, then releasing the hold to fall back on their feet. This move is notably used as a finisher by Giulia, who calls the move &quot;Arrivederci&quot;.

===Shining wizard===
A strike invented by The Great Muta delivered to an opponent down on one knee. After stepping off the opponent&#x27;s raised knee with one foot, the wrestler swings the other leg and strikes the opponent&#x27;s head with either the side of the knee or shin. A slight variation known as shining apprentice sees the wrestler use a running enzuigiri to the kneeling opponent&#x27;s head without the use of the opponent&#x27;s knee for leverage. Many other &quot;shining&quot; attacks exist, including big boots and dropkicks. The shining wizard can be applied to a standing opponent as well; this would be likely applied by stepping off the opponent&#x27;s chest and then delivering a knee smash to the opponent&#x27;s face. AJ Lee used this move as her finisher in her time in WWE. Nixon Newell uses this move as her finisher called &quot;The Shiniest Wizard.&quot; Eddie Edwards uses a version of this move as his finisher where he uses his knee to strike his opponent, known as the &quot;Boston Knee Party&quot;. Adam Cole uses a version of this move, called &quot;The Boom&quot; (formerly known as &quot;The Last Shot&quot;), where he strikes his opponent at the back of their head and neck.

===Spinning knee===
Also known as a discus knee or rolling knee, the wrestler advances toward a sitting or bent over opponent, performs a 360Â° spin and uses the momentum to deliver a jumping knee strike to the opponent&#x27;s head. AEW wrestler Malakai Black uses this move as a signature against a standing opponent.

===Back kick===
Involves the attacker beginning by facing their opponent, then turning 180Â° and bending the rear leg at the knee or extending it backward in full, exploiting the turning momentum to strike the opponent in the chest or stomach. Also known as reverse side kick or heel kick. It is a very popular attack in Mexico, known by its original name &quot;La Filomena&quot;, for it was innovated and named by MurciÃ©lago VelÃ¡zquez. A jumping back kick is a variation that involves the attacker conducting the turning motion while jumping.

Even though several other kicks may be confused with a back kick, it must be considered that these attacks are distinctively applied heel/calf-first.

===Calf kick===

A variation has the attacking wrestler standing on the top turnbuckle or springboarding from the top rope to get the required height to execute it. Matt Cardona uses this move, calling it the &quot;Rough Ryder&quot; during his time in WWE as Zack Ryder before renaming it the &quot;Radio Silence&quot; after leaving WWE. Cardona&#x27;s wife Chelsea Green also uses this move. Booker T also used this move throughout his WCW, WWF/E, and TNA career in which he stands in front of his opponent and then takes a few steps forward doing a Leg Lariat, he used this as a signature move, dubbing it the &quot;Harlem/Houston Sidekick&quot;.

===Spin kick===
Also known as reverse roundhouse kick, it sees the attacking wrestler spinning 360Â° on their rear foot gaining power and momentum from spinning in place, then connecting their lead foot&#x27;s heel/calf to a charging opponent&#x27;s face. It is common to see this move executed after an opponent is Irish whipped off the ropes. A short-arm variation is also possible. Malakai Black uses this move and calls it &quot;Black Mass&quot;. Mickie James also uses this move and calls it the &quot;Mick Kick&quot;.

===Spinning heel kick===

Also known as a &quot;Spinning wheel kick&quot;, this is a jumping version of the spin kick that usually involves the wrestler spinning 360Â° so their body is somewhat horizontal before hitting the opponent with the back of their leg(s) or heel(s) on the opponent&#x27;s face or chest. Tyler Breeze uses this move as his finisher called the &quot;Beauty Shot&quot;.

===Dragon whip===
This attack is performed after an opponent catches the leg of a wrestler who has attempted a kick of some sort (performing a maneuver known in wrestling as &quot;Leg-feed&quot;), then while the opponent throws the leg out away from themself, the wrestler continues spinning all the way out with their leg still extended to connect the kick.

===Superkick===

Often referred to as side kick or crescent kick, it sees the wrestler delivering a kick with the lead foot to the opponent&#x27;s face, chin, neck or breastbone, usually preceded by a sidestep. &quot;Gentleman&quot; Chris Adams is credited for its innovation. It is famously the finisher of Shawn Michaels, who calls it &quot;Sweet Chin Music&quot; and usually adds theatrics before using the move. Nic Nemeth also uses this move as a tribute to Michaels, Tyler Breeze uses this as his signature move called the &quot;Supermodel Kick&quot;. James Storm uses this move as his finisher called the &quot;Last Call&quot;. The Usos and The Young Bucks also perform a simultaneous double superkick variation, the latter calling it &quot;Superkicks in Stereo&quot;. A slight variation of the Superkick where the wrestler performs the attack on an opponent who is on a lowered position, as in a seated or kneeling position, is sometimes referred to as Low Superkick. Sometimes, a Superkick can be added with a thigh slap, so it adds that signature âpopâ.

===Sole kick===
A thrust where the wrestler turns the torso away lifting one leg horizontally and extending it toward the opponent, striking in the torso with the sole of their foot. A spin kick variation sees the wrestler spin around and then performing the kick with the outer leg, which is known as rolling sole butt in Japan. There is also jumping variation where the wrestler jumps straight up, spins in the air, and then delivers the sole butt with the outer leg targeting the head of the opponent.

A sole kick can be differentiated from any other because it is always applied with the ball/core of the foot in a thrusting fashion.

====Big boot====

This attack is usually done with the opponent charging toward the wrestler, using the opponent&#x27;s momentum to deliver the wrestler&#x27;s sole to the upper-body or head. This move is commonly performed by tall wrestlers to enhance its view as a strong attack even though the wrestler themselves are not moving and the opponent is running into the foot, and because of that their height makes it easy for their legs to reach the head of normal-sized wrestlers. There is also an arched variation of this move. Sami Zayn uses this move calling it the &quot;Helluva Kick&quot; onto the cornered opponent. Billie Kay also uses this move calling it the &quot;Shades of Kay&quot;. Masahiro Chono uses a running variation on a seated opponent, called the &quot;Yakuza Kick&quot;. Charlotte Flair calls this move the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Boot&quot;. Grado uses a running variation called the &quot;Wee Boot&quot;.

====Bicycle kick====

An attacking wrestler jumps up and kicks forward with one foot after the other in a pedalling motion, with the foot that gets lifted second being extended fully to catch a charging opponent directly in the face. Another variation sees the attacking wrestler charge at a standing opponent before delivering the attack. Similar in effect to the big boot. This move is used by Sheamus as a finisher, the &quot;Brogue Kick&quot;.

====Dropkick====

An attack where the wrestler jumps up and kicks the opponent with the soles of both feet, this usually sees the wrestler twist as they jump so that when the feet connect with the opponent one foot is raised higher that the other (depending on which way they twist) and the wrestlers fall back to the mat on their side or front. This is commonly employed by light and nimble wrestlers who can take advantage of their agility.

====Kangaroo Kick====
This attack sees a wrestler lying back on the mat or leaning at the turnbuckle, resting both arms on the top rope, waiting for the opponent&#x27;s charge, the wrestler then throws both feet forward driving them to the opponent&#x27;s stomach or face. Popularized by Bruno Sammartino.

====Legsweep====
The wrestler drops to one knee and extends the other leg to knock away the opponent&#x27;s legs, then quickly pivots their body around.

=====Sweeping kick=====
In this variation of the legsweep the wrestler kicks one or both of the opponents legs to &quot;sweep them off their feet&quot;, usually while either running towards the opponent or if the opponent is running towards them. Noam Dar uses this variant.

====Mule kick====
While facing away from a charging opponent, the wrestler bends down and pushes out one foot, striking the opponent with the bottom of it. A double mule kick variation is usually done with the wrestler facing away from the opponent, bending over and making a handstand. If acrobatically inclined, the wrestler can then roll forward, back into a standing position. Sometimes done in a corner, the wrestler takes hold on the top rope and kicks backward with both legs to the opponent, hitting with both soles.

====Savate kick====
The most commonly used savate kick in wrestling is the &quot;ChassÃ© jambe arriÃ©re&quot;, a piston-action kick to an opponent&#x27;s head or chin. This kick is often confused with the Superkick, but it can be differentiated for it is performed from an upright stance with the rear foot, instead of the lead foot. Miro used a jumping version as a finishing move, calling it the &quot;Machka Kick&quot;.

===Toe kick===

This kick, used by almost all wrestlers, is appealed just for show or as a setup for a hold or throw. The most common way to perform this attack is known as snap kick and sees the wrestler striking the opponent upward in the midsection or stomach to bend the opponent over. Another variation sees the wrestler holding back their own foot with one hand, taking it up their side or lower back and releasing it, striking a bent over opponent in the back of the head.

This maneuver can be differentiated from any other kick noting that it is always performed striking with the point of the foot-instep-shin area.

====Backflip kick====
Also known as the PÃ©le kick after the association football player, the attacker performs a standing back flip while having their back to the opponent. The attacker then hits the opponent in the head with one or both legs, with the wrestler usually landing on hands and feet facing downward. Popularized by AJ Styles and also by Jinsei Shinzaki which he calls it &quot;Rinne&quot;. There are many variations of this maneuver since it can be performed from a backroll, a corkscrew, a handspring or a handstand.

====Corner backflip kick====
This variation, also known as tiger wall flip and popularized by Satoru Sayama, sees an opponent propped up in the corner as an attacking wrestler charges toward them, running up the ropes (beside the opponent), or in some cases, up the opponent, and, as they reach the top, kicking off the opponent&#x27;s chest to perform a backflip so the wrestler lands on their hands and feet.

====Cartwheel kick====
The wrestler performs a cartwheel toward the opponent, hitting them in the head with the rear leg&#x27;s shin as it comes up in the air. Popularized by Ernest &quot;The Cat&quot; Miller.

====Crane kick====
The wrestler first performs a crane stance by standing on one leg with the other knee raised and arms extended in a crane position. The wrestler then strikes the opponent&#x27;s head or face with either the standing or raised leg.

====Enzuigiri====
The term &quot;enzui&quot; is the Japanese word for medulla oblongata and &quot;giri&quot; means &quot;to chop&quot;. Thus, an &quot;enzuigiri&quot; (often misspelled &#x27;ensuigiri&#x27; and mispronounced as &#x27;enziguri&#x27;) is any attack that strikes the back of the head. It is usually associated with lighter weight class wrestlers, as well as wrestlers who have a martial arts background or gimmick. It is often used as a countermove after a kick is blocked and the leg caught, or the initial kick is a feint to set up the real attack. A common variation of the enzuigiri sees the wrestler stepping up the opponent&#x27;s midsection and hitting the back of the opponent&#x27;s head with the other foot. Invented by Antonio Inoki. This move was also the finisher of the late WWF Superstar Bad News Brown dubbed the &quot;Ghetto Blaster&quot;.

=====Jumping high kick=====
Properly called &quot;Gamengiri&quot; (from the original Japanese &quot;Gamen&quot; / &quot;face&quot; and &quot;Giri&quot; / &quot;Cut&quot;), it is a variation of an &quot;enzuigiri&quot; where the wrestler jumps up, not taking a step or hold with the lead foot and kicks the opponent in the side of the head/face. Sonya Deville uses this move. Noam Dar uses this move as his finisher called the &quot;Nova Roller&quot;.

====Overhead kick====
In this version, the wrestler either starts by lying down or dropping down on the mat while the opponent stands near to their head. The wrestler then throws a leg and kicks up over their waist and chest, hitting the opponent with the point of the foot, usually in the head. It can be used as a counter to an attack from behind. For example, an opponent attempts a full nelson, the wrestler breaks the opponent&#x27;s lock by raising both arms, falling to the canvas back-first and kicking the opponent in the head with one foot. This was used by Finn Balor. The move is also used by T.J. Perkins as his finisher, first lifting the opponent up in a fireman&#x27;s carry position, then drops them down to execute the kick; the move is called the &quot;Detonation Kick&quot;.

====Shoot kick====
A kickboxing-style kick with the shin (generally protected by a shin guard) striking an opponent&#x27;s face, chest or thighs. This move is used in shoot-style environments and by many Japanese wrestlers. In WWE, Daniel Bryan popularized the shoot kicks as the &quot;Yes! Kicks&quot; while the crowd would respond with a chant of &quot;Yes!&quot; every time a kick connected. The Miz would begin to use this move following his feud with Daniel Bryan, which would be dubbed the &quot;It Kicks&quot;. Shayna Baszler also uses this move.

====Football kick====
Sometimes also referred to as soccer kick. The wrestler strikes an opponent sitting on the mat with the foot extended downward vertically from the base of the spine to the back&#x27;s midsection. Used by Katsuyori Shibata as the &quot;P.K.&quot; (penalty kick).

====Punt====
Based on the field goal kick but named for the punt kick used in American football, sees the wrestler taking a run up to a kneeling opponent and strike them in the head with the point of the foot. It is similar to the soccer kick in MMA. WWE wrestler Randy Orton performed this move as his finisher maneuver to cause storyline concussions.

====Roundhouse kick====
Properly speaking, a roundhouse kick in wrestling is a variation of a shoot kick with a slight difference. While in the latter (a proper roundhouse kick in execution) the attack stops after connecting with the opponent, in a roundhouse kick the wrestler will keep spinning well past a sitting/kneeling opponent&#x27;s head or a standing opponent&#x27;s ribcage, giving a 180Â° or even a full 360Â° turn. This is famously used by Trish Stratus, which she calls the &quot;Chick Kick&quot;.

====Tiger feint kick====
A move in which a wrestler jumps through the second and top rope while holding on to the ropes, using the momentum to swing back around into the ring. Originally performed as a &quot;fake&quot; dive to make opponents and fans think that the wrestler was about to dive through the ropes to opponents outside of the ring, later modified to become a kick to the head of an opponent who is hung on the second rope. This move requires high agility and is mainly used by smaller wrestlers in Japan and Mexico. It was popularized internationally by Rey Mysterio, who called the move &quot;619&quot; (after the area code for Mysterio&#x27;s hometown). It would since also be used by &quot;Dirty&quot; Dominik Mysterio, Iyo Sky and Claudio Castagnoli, with the latter referring to the move as the &quot;Swiss-1-9&quot;.

==Lariat==
In wrestling, a lariat is performed when an attacking wrestler runs toward an opponent and wraps an arm around the opponent&#x27;s upper chest or neck, forcing them to the ground. This move is similar to a clothesline, the difference being that in a clothesline the wrestler&#x27;s arm is kept straight to their side during the move, while in the lariat the wrestler strikes the opponent with their arm often in a swinging motion and sometimes dropping face first besides the opponent.

Typically, a lariat is used as a finishing move while the clothesline is simply a basic strike attack. The main difference aside from the mechanics of the movement is the stiffness: a lariat is essentially a very stiff, swinging clothesline.

===Crooked arm lariat===
Performed when an attacking wrestler runs toward an opponent with the arm bent upward at the elbow 60â90 degrees and wraps the arm around the opponent&#x27;s neck, forcing them to the ground. Hulk Hogan is often credited with being its innovator, popularizing it as &quot;Axe Bomber&quot;. Brian Myers uses this move called the &quot;Roster Cut&quot;.

===Discus lariat===
The attacker performs a spinning motion before leaping their arm forward and knocking them down. This variation is notably used by Mike Santana as a finisher, who calls the move &quot;Spin the Block&quot;.

===Flying lariat===
The attacking wrestler first uses the ropes to build up speed, then leaps forward and wraps their arm around the opponent&#x27;s neck, knocking them down. The move is noted to have been used by several high-flying wrestlers such as Ricochet, Will Ospreay (who refers to the move as &quot;Pip Pip Cheerio&quot;) and Logan Paul, and is also used by mat-based wrestler &quot;Hangman&quot; Adam Page (who refers to the move as the &quot;Buckshot&quot;).

===Lariat takedown===
The wrestler runs toward their opponent, wraps an arm around the opponent&#x27;s upper chest and neck, and swings both legs forward, using this momentum to pull the opponent down with them to the mat back-first. Popularized by &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage.

===Leg drag===
Also known as low-angle discus lariat or dragon screw sets the attacking wrestler waiting for a charging opponent, the wrestler then takes a sidestep, extends an arm and lowers the upper body all at once in a swinging motion, turning up to 180 degrees, hooking the back of the opponent&#x27;s nearest knee to trip them down to the mat back first. It was one of Bob Backlund&#x27;s many signature moves.

===Northern lariat===
Also called enzui lariat, it sets the attacking wrestler charging against the opponent&#x27;s back, driving them to the mat face first.

===Pendulum lariat===
A wrestler performs a tilting sequence, similar to that of an actual pendulum, in between the ring ropes (usually near a ringpost) in order to gain momentum to perform an attack or a counterattack before striking the opponent hard. Nigel McGuiness is known for utilizing it as the &quot;Jawbreaker Lariat&quot; and Jon Moxley as the &quot;Lunatic Lariat&quot;.

===Short-arm lariat===
A variation where the wrestler grabs one of the opponent&#x27;s wrists with a hand and pulls the opponent closer, striking with their other arm. This was popularized by Kazuchika Okada as the &quot;Rainmaker&quot;. This can also be used in combination with a hammerlock as in the case of Ariya Daivari.

===Western lariat===
This maneuver is performed when the wrestler does not run, but simply strikes the opponent while standing next to them or waiting for a charging opponent. Popularized by Stan Hansen. The wrestler can also hold the opponent&#x27;s head up before performing the lariat with their other arm. Kenta Kobashi uses this variation as one of his finishing moves, calling it the &quot;Burning Lariat&quot;. Shingo Takagi uses this move as one of his finishing moves, calling it the &quot;Pumping Bomber.&quot; Go Shiozaki uses this move as his finishing move and calls it &quot;Gowan Lariat&quot;.

==Palm strike==
This move sees the wrestler delivering an open-handed strike with arm movement akin to a cross, usually to the opponent&#x27;s chin, face or chest. This is a legitimate offensive-defensive maneuver in karate known as &quot;Shotei uchi&quot; and is often performed by wrestlers with known martial arts background, particularly in Japan where is often associated to former &quot;sekitori&quot;. Several of these attacks can also be performed with the opponent in a side headlock. Io Shirai uses this move. Juice Robinson, formerly known as CJ Parker during his tenure in FCW and NXT, used this move as a signature move and referred to it as the &quot;Left Hand of God&quot;, later calling it the &quot;Third Eye&quot;. CJ Parker accidentally broke Kevin Owens&#x27; nose performing a palm strike when Kevin Owens made his NXT debut.

===Forehand chop===
Sometimes referred to as a frying pan or an open-hand chop. Despite the name, it refers to a slap properly and not a chop. The wrestler strikes downward the chest, nape or back of an opponent, using the open palm of the hand.

====Double open hand chop====
Also called blazing chop, this variation sees a standing wrestler striking the chest of a charging opponent with both palms sideways, shoving them down to the mat back first.

===Slap===
The wrestler delivers an overpowering open-hand slap crossing the opponent&#x27;s face, ears, or nape. This simple strike is more often performed by female wrestlers or villains. A variation associated to Dusty Rhodes and his family involves a charging wrestler attacking with a slap as if performing a clothesline. Human Tornado often used a backhand variation called the Pimp Slap.

====Double slap====
Also known as a bell clap, the wrestler slaps both ears of an opponent simultaneously with the palms of both hands, disorienting their balance. It is often used as a counter for a bear hug.

===Uppercut===

Properly speaking, an uppercut is a punch used in boxing that usually aims at the opponent&#x27;s chin. It is, along with the hook and the overhand, one of the main punches that count in statistics as a &quot;Power punch&quot;, while in wrestling, any close-fisted punch is considered an illegal attack. Therefore, it is an upward variant of a palm strike in execution. Usually seen performed by tall, heavy wrestlers like Kane and Goldust.

Nevertheless, a close-fisted uppercut has been seen in wrestling from time to time usually meant as a &quot;cheap shot&quot;. Extensively used by &quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper in that same matter.

==Punch==
An illegal attack using a simple close-fisted punch, normally to the stomach, lower back, or head of the opponent. Unlike most illegal attacks, punches almost never result in disqualification in North America. Instead, the referee simply admonishes the wrestler to stop, usually to no effect. In traditional-style European wrestling, if spotted by the referee, it usually results in a formal warning (such as the British &quot;public warning&quot;, French &quot;avertisement&quot; or German yellow card) three of which bring disqualification - consequently in these territories heels go to great lengths to conceal punches from the referee and thus trigger major crowd heat when they succeed. 

In America, punches are often used by both heels and faces alike. When heels perform the strike either while the opponent is not expecting it, or while the referee is in some way distracted, it seems more devastating.

Several boxing punches can be found in wrestling, such as jabs, straights, hooks and overhands.

===Back fist===
Often aimed at a kneeling opponent or one sat on the top turnbuckle. In this variation of a simple close-fisted punch, the wrestler strikes the opponent with the back of the fist in the head or chest, often repeatedly.

====Spinning back fist====

The wrestler holds an arm out horizontally and executes a back fist whilst turning the body swiftly, hitting the opponent on rotation. Used by Aja Kong as &quot;Uraken,&quot; Vader, Awesome Kong, Andrade, and Eddie Kingston, who calls it the &quot;Backfist to the Future&quot;.

===Discus punch===
Also named spinning punch or tornado punch. The attacker performs a 180 or 360 degree turn similar to a discus motion and hits the opponent in the head with a swinging hook.

===Double punch===
This simply sees the attacker punching with both fists simultaneously, usually targeting the opponent&#x27;s head or chest. Dusty Rhodes is best noted for this type of attack as a signature in which he stuns his opponents with a series of jabs first then punches them in their chest.

===Flapjack punch===
The attacker lifts a charging opponent up in the air as if performing a back body drop, but instead of tossing them over their head, the attacker pushes the opponent upward, performing a flapjack. As the opponent falls to the mat face-first, the attacker hits the opponent with a liver shot. Popularized by Ludvig Borga.

===Heart punch===
The wrestler raises the opponent&#x27;s left arm up over their head, sometimes folding it back behind the neck as well, then delivers a strong straight into the side of the ribcage. The move is alleged to rely on &quot;Oriental pressure points&quot; to strike a nerve causing the opponent&#x27;s heart to momentarily stop, rendering them unconscious. Stan &quot;The Man&quot; Stasiak, Ox Baker and Big John Studd are professional wrestlers well known for their use of the heart punch as a wrestling maneuver. Mean Mark Callous used this move as a finisher early in his career.

===Mounted punches===
This attack involves a wrestler standing on the middle or top ropes and delivering repeated crosses to the face while the opponent is backed up against the turnbuckles. A variation sees the wrestler striking a fallen opponent, either mounting in front of them or kneeling beside, and having the opponent in a side headlock. The crowd tends to count the punches, which typically end at ten, provided they&#x27;re not interrupted by the opponent pushing the wrestler off or by the referee admonishing the attacking wrestler.

===Superman punch===

Similar to the Muay Thai version, this attack sees a wrestler leap into the air, snapping the rear leg back before striking with a swinging overhand to the opponent&#x27;s head. Popularized by Roman Reigns.

===Wind-up punch===
A theatrical variation in which the wrestler rotates the attacking arm in a &quot;winding-up&quot; motion before striking the opponent, making the punch appear more effective in the same way as a bolo punch in boxing. Hulk Hogan is know for this move as a babyface earlier in his career.

==Senton==
In the same sense of a press or a splash, the wrestler jumps over an opponent, but in this case the attacker falls lower-back first or into a sitting position. Some wrestlers may perform this move in a cannonball style.

In Spanish, the word senton (Properly spelled as ) refers to landing on the lower back or buttocks after taking a fall, either on purpose (as for comedic effect) or accidentally.

===Body guillotine===
Having a fallen opponent lying next to the apron, the attacking wrestler grabs the opponent&#x27;s head, torso, or leg and places it on the bottom rope. Taking hold of the top rope, the wrestler proceeds to jump and sit repeatedly on the opponent&#x27;s neck, chest, or leg as they stomp hard, to hurt or incapacitate the opponent.

====Leapfrog body guillotine====

This move sees the opponent&#x27;s chest resting on the second rope, facing out of the ring. The attacker runs from behind, performs a leapfrog, and lands on their opponent&#x27;s back, neck, or head, sliding through the ropes out of the ring as they force the opponent&#x27;s chest against the second rope.

===Bronco buster===
With an opponent seated in the corner of the ring, the attacking wrestler jumps in the corner, straddling on the opponent&#x27;s midsection, bouncing up and down. Often treated as having comic or sexual connotations rather than as a legitimately painful move, due to the move&#x27;s resemblance to a teabag. Popularized by Sean Waltman, although Mae Young was known for using it long beforehand.

====Koronco buster====
Similar to a bronco buster, the attacking wrestler jumps onto a standing opponent in the corner, straddling and sitting on the opponent&#x27;s chest, while resting feet on the second rope. The attacking wrestler then follows with mounted punches.

===Hip attack===

Also named &quot;rear view&quot; or &quot;butt thump&quot;, is usually performed with a running start, then the attacking wrestler jumps into the air, spinning around, and thrusting the pelvis backward, thus hitting the opponent&#x27;s face or chest with hip or buttocks. A standing variation called &quot;butt-butt&quot; is performed by a wrestler turning the back to a charging opponent and then just bending over so the opponent bumps their stomach against the wrestler&#x27;s hip. Another variation called reverse body avalanche sees large, heavy wrestlers giving the back to a cornered opponent as they take hold on the top rope, thrusting the pelvis repeatedly against the opponent&#x27;s midsection as if performing turnbuckle thrusts.

===Seated senton===
Also known as vertical splash or butt drop, is the most common form to perform this maneuver. A wrestler jumps down to a sitting position across the chest or stomach of a fallen opponent. This particular move is usually executed one of two ways. One sees the wrestler stand over the opponent and drop to either a seated position (like Rikishi) or a kneeling position (like Bastion Booger&#x27;s &quot;Trip to the Batcave&quot;). The other is performed with the opponent lying near one of the turnbuckles, with the wrestler climbing to the middle rope and bouncing on it before performing the senton (Yokozuna&#x27;s &quot;Banzai Drop&quot;). A variation of the seated senton was performed by Earthquake, whose &quot;Earthquake Splash&quot; would see him run off the ropes to gain momentum for the senton and then jump onto the opponent while running. It is also an obvious and often-used counter to the sunset flip.

===Somersault senton===
Another slight variation on a standard senton sees the attacking wrestler jump and flip forward 180Â° so that the lower back impacts on the opponent&#x27;s chest or head.

====Cannonball====
A somersault senton performed to an opponent sitting in a corner to be sandwiched between the turnbuckle and the wrestler&#x27;s lower back, commonly used by Kevin Owens.

==Shoulder block==
A maneuver that sees a standing wrestler strike usually ramming with a shoulder, by keeping an arm down by the side into a charging opponent&#x27;s chest or abdomen. Often this will see a larger wrestler displaying superior size and strength by challenging an opponent to attack, standing still slightly to one side and having the opponent charging toward trying to execute a strike, only to get knocked down (often several times) and see any attempt of the hapless opponent having no effect. A slight variation called body block, sees an opponent run at the large wrestler who would simply engulf the charging opponent by swinging their arms round and forcing the opponent to impact the wrestler&#x27;s entire body.

===Chop block===
This variation, based on the illegal American football block, sees the wrestler performing this attack coming from behind an opponent and dropping down to connect with their shoulder into the back of one of the opponent&#x27;s knees. This is often used to weaken the leg for submission holds, as noted by Ric Flair&#x27;s extensive use of the move as a set-up for his &quot;Figure Four Leglock&quot;. AJ Styles and Cash Wheeler use this move as set-up for the &quot;Calf Crusher&quot; and &quot;Indian Deathlock&quot;, respectively.

===Pounce===
The attacking wrestler runs the ropes to gain momentum before leaping at the opponent with a high shoulder block. This variation is usually either preceded by an Irish Whip to an adjacent side of the ring or used to cut-off an opponent already running the ropes, further increasing the move&#x27; s impact. It was popularized by Monty Brown and named for his &quot;Alpha Male&quot; gimmick. The move is also used by Mojo Rawley, Keith Lee, Lance Archer and Nyla Rose.

===Short-arm shoulder block===
A variation where the wrestler grasps one of the opponent&#x27;s wrists firmly with both hands and pulls the opponent&#x27;s arm toward them. From this point on, the attack can be executed one of two ways. In one, the wrestler rams their shoulder repeatedly against the opponent&#x27;s own to incapacitate or hurt the arm, setting it up for a submission or as a mean of punishment. Popularized by Diamond Dallas Page and Batista.

In the other, the wrestler strikes lunging their shoulder against the opponent&#x27;s chest or chin, then releasing the hold to leave the opponent fall to the mat. This maneuver was performed extensively by Beth Phoenix.

===Spear===

This sets an attacking wrestler charging toward a standing opponent, bringing the body parallel to the ground and driving one shoulder into the opponent&#x27;s midsection, pulling on their legs, as in a double leg takedown, and forcing them back-first into the mat. This 
move has been used by many famous wrestlers as a signature and finisher. Goldberg is the wrestler who is credited to have invented the spear and is most commonly associated with the move, using it as a set-up for his &quot;Jackhammer&quot; slam. Other wrestlers including Cope, Batista, Bobby Lashley, Roman Reigns, Moose, Christian Cage and Jey Uso have made the spear either their finishing or signature moves.

====Jumping spear====
Also known as a leaping spear, this version sees the wrestling jump as they are charging towards to opponent just before making contact with their shoulder. Ricky Starks uses the move as a finisher.

====Striking spear====

In this variation, the wrestler does not pull on the opponent&#x27;s legs in a double leg takedown, relying only on the strike&#x27;s momentum to force the opponent down. Rhyno uses this variation as his finisher, calling it the &quot;Gore&quot;.

====Spear with multiple punches====
This variation of spear is laying the opponent down with a spear and punching them with Thesz press punches.

===Turnbuckle thrust===
This move is performed to an opponent set up resting back first against the turnbuckle. Then the wrestler takes hold of the second rope with both hands, opens their arms, and strikes, driving the attacking shoulder into the opponent&#x27;s midsection, often repeatedly, as the attacker swings their legs back and forth to gain momentum. A variation sees smaller wrestlers using the tops of their heads instead of the shoulder or running from the center of the ring.

==Splash==

A splash is an attack very similar to a body press in function but not in execution. The difference lies in that it is executed from a falling position. Most of the times the attack is performed horizontally, and most variations can seamlessly transition into a pin.

===Big splash===

This maneuver involves a wrestler jumping forward and landing stomach-first across an opponent lying on the ground below. On some occasions a wrestler has a short running start before executing the move. This was the finisher of many super heavyweight superstars back in the 80s and 90s, used by superstars such as the One Man Gang, Kamala, Tugboat, Tyrus, Mark Henry, Haystacks Calhoun, Bam Bam Bigelow, Vader, Viscera, Big Boss Man, King Kong Bundy, Rikishi, and many other super heavyweights throughout the years. It is also even used by some non-superheavyweights, such as The Ultimate Warrior and Big E.

===Cartwheel splash===
The attacking wrestler performs a cartwheel before landing stomach-first across an opponent lying on the mat. Usually performed by small, nimble wrestlers.

===Crossbody===
Also known as crossbody block, a wrestler jumps onto their opponent and lands horizontally across the opponent&#x27;s torso, forcing the opponent to the mat and usually resulting in a pinfall attempt. There is also an aerial variation, known as a diving crossbody, where a wrestler leaps from an elevated position toward the opponent. This attack is known as a &quot;Plancha&quot; in Lucha libre.

====Tilt-a-whirl crossbody====
An uncommon variation of the move which sees the wrestler being held and spun into a tilt-a-whirl by the opponent. When the wrestler reaches a point where they are horizontally positioned against the opponent&#x27;s torso, they fall down, pushing the opponent onto their back against the canvas. This move is better described as a counter for a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker, or for a tilt-a-whirl mat slam. The most devastating splash was in 2025 when Coach Brewer stinger splashed Coach Krieger. It caused multiple injuries that he is still recovering from

==Stomp==
Also known as foot stomp, this attack sees a wrestler stamping a foot on any part of a fallen opponent. One variation performed by large, heavy wrestlers implies simply to step on the opponent&#x27;s stomach as they walk, often referred to as a big walk. This variation, when performed by a villain, aims to the head of the opponent but in a crudest, vicious way.

===Curb stomp===

A move where a wrestler grabs the opponent&#x27;s legs lying on the floor before wrapping them in a standing inverted Indian deathlock position and then pulling their arms in a standing surfboard before stomping the back of the opponent&#x27;s head. This was invented by Super Dragon. Naomichi Marufuji innovated a facebuster version of this move which sees him perform a running jumping stomp to the back of the head of an opponent who&#x27;s bent-over or on all fours, forcing the opponent face-first into the ground. WWE wrestler Seth &quot;Freakin&quot; Rollins currently uses this move as a finisher. He has also used diving and springboard versions of this move.

===Double foot stomp===
When a wrestler jumps and stamps both feet on any part of an opponent. Also known as double stomp. This can be performed from an elevated position as a diving double foot stomp as done by Finn BÃ¡lor, who uses this move as his finisher called the &quot;Coup de GrÃ¢ce&quot;. Cameron Grimes uses a running variation called the &quot;Cave-In&quot;, formerly known as the &quot;Caveman Stomp&quot;. Swerve Strickland also uses the diving variant, but executes it on an opponent on a seated position, which has been dubbed the &quot;Swerve Stomp&quot;. Large, heavy wrestlers often perform this move by simply standing over a defenseless opponent next to the apron both feet and grabbing a hold on the top rope, squashing the fallen body.

===Garvin stomp===
A wrestler performs a series of stomps all over the body of a fallen opponent in the order of left arm, left chest, left stomach, left upper leg, left lower leg, right lower leg, right upper leg, right stomach, right chest, right arm, and finally the jaw. Innovated by and named after the former NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ron Garvin in the late 1980s. It was later popularized by Randy Orton.

==== Moonsault double foot stomp ====
This variation sees the wrestler perform a moonsault, but instead of landing on a fallen opponent in the splash position, the wrestler continues the rotation driving both feet into the opponent. Sonjay Dutt uses this as an occasional finishing move named Moonstomp.

==Transition moves==
Some moves are meant neither to pin an opponent, nor weaken them or force them to submit, but are intended to set up the opponent for another attack.

===Discus===
This is a move in which a wrestler will spin in place before hitting an attack, like the discus clothesline, discus punch, discus forearm or the discus lariat. The move is usually used instead of charging toward an opponent to build up momentum for an attack, often the discus spin is used to evade incoming attacks.

===Handspring===
The wrestler runs toward the ropes and performs a handstand right next to them, using their momentum to throw their legs against the ropes, springing backward onto their feet, and using the momentum still to leap backward, usually to deliver an attack. A back elbow strike variation is the most common. Another common variation of the handspring transition sees the attacking wrestler Irish-whip their opponent onto a turnbuckle from an adjacent corner. Once the opponent crashes with their back onto the turnbuckle, the wrestler immediately performs a handspring combo toward the opponent across the ring. The acrobatic combination usually consists of a cartwheel followed by one or two back-tucks, leaving the wrestler&#x27;s back facing the opponent. When the wrestler is in close range of the opponent, they are free to use the momentum of the handspring combination to leap backward and strike with any convenient attack.

===High-impact===
Sometimes abbreviated to &quot;Hi-impact&quot;, this term defines any attack performed by a charging wrestler with enough speed and momentum that once started it cannot be stopped. The opponents receiving such attacks can be against the ropes/turnbuckle, lying on the mat or even trying to perform an attack against the charging wrestler themselves.

===Leapfrog===
Named after the children&#x27;s game, an evasion maneuver that sees a wrestler standing in front of an incoming opponent as they leap upward, performing a split, so the opponent&#x27;s onrush misses. It can also be employed to set up an attack. In WWE, this move is commonly used by Bobby Lashley.

===Matrix===
This is an evasion performed by bending over backward into a bridging position to counter any clothesline, punch, etc. This is named after &quot;The Matrix&quot; film series, as it is performed similarly to when Neo, in the movies, avoids a string of bullets.

===Pendulum===
This is a move in which a wrestler performs a tilting sequence, similar to that of an actual pendulum, in between the ring ropes (usually near a ringpost) in order to gain momentum to perform an attack or a counterattack. The usual move was the clothesline or a lariat notably used by wrestlers such as Jon Moxley and Kyle O&#x27;Reilly.

====Tiger feint====

A variation of the pendulum, this move sees a wrestler jump through the second and top rope while holding on to the ropes, using the momentum to swing back around into the ring. The move was originally performed as a &quot;fake&quot; dive to make opponents and fans think that the wrestler was about to dive through the ropes to opponents outside of the ring. The variation that ends with a kick to an opponent draped over the second rope was popularized internationally by Rey Mysterio, who called the move &quot;619&quot;, while Ilja Dragunov uses a variation that transitions into a lariat, referring to it as the &quot;Constantine Special&quot;.

===Rolling Thunder===

A rolling thunder refers to the action of a forward roll toward an opponent using the complete rotation to spring up onto their feet and into the air and perform an attack. The most popular version of this ends it with a jumping somersault senton. Rob Van Dam popularized this move.

===Short-arm===
This transitioning maneuver is a set up for a short ranged attack, performed by Irish-whipping the opponent, but holding onto the wrist. When the held arm is completely extended, the wrestler pulls the opponent back and strikes them with the free arm. Alternatively, the Irish whip is used instead of or replaced by an arm wrench or a wrist lock, or by simply grabbing a hold of one of the opponent&#x27;s wrists with one of the wrestler&#x27;s hands, pulling it toward themselves and striking with their spare arm or going for a hold or sweep.

====Ripcord====
A variation of the short-arm, this transitioning maneuver begins with the attacking wrestler behind the opponent as they grab one of their wrists with their opposite hand (grabbing the opponent&#x27;s right wrist with their left hand, and vice versa). They then spin the opponent around while still maintaining their grip on the opponent, so that both wrestlers are facing one another. From there, the attacking wrestler pulls the opponent toward them and strikes as in a normal short-arm.

===Skin the cat===
This defensive maneuver is used when a wrestler is thrown over the top rope. While being thrown over, the wrestler grabs the top rope with both hands and holds on so that they end up dangling from the top rope but not landing on the apron or floor. The wrestler then proceeds to lift their legs over their head and rotates their body back toward the ring to go back over the top rope and into the ring, landing in the ring on their feet. The wrestler can also perform a head scissor hold or a type of kick to strike an opponent on the inside to throw them over. A wrestler may deploy this tactic in a Royal Rumble or Battle Royal match to save themself from being eliminated, or to set up another springboard maneuver or a top rope maneuver in a normal match. This move was made famous by Ricky &quot;The Dragon&quot; Steamboat and Shawn Michaels.

==Illegal attacks==
In kayfabe, any attack meant to incapacitate or disable an opponent is theoretically an offense punishable by disqualification in regular singles or team matches. Typically performed when the referee is disabled or otherwise distracted. Most of these attacks are legal in hardcore or no-disqualification matches.

===Cheap shots===
Mainly used by heels. Often, wrestlers will perform these strikes while the referee is in some way distracted. In Lucha libre, this is referred to as a &quot;fault&quot; or &quot;foul&quot;. The most well-known illegal moves are those that attack the groin of a male wrestler.

====Back rake====
The attacking wrestler drags both hands&#x27; stiff fingers down the opponent&#x27;s back to cause pain with his fingernails.

====Biting====
The wrestler seizes a body part of the opponent and bites down with their teeth. Biting is often used when a wrestler is &quot;trapped&quot;, either in a corner of the ring or in a submission hold, as a desperation move.

====Eye poke====
Also called a thumb to the eye. When a wrestler pokes their thumb or finger(s) into an opponent&#x27;s eye(s).

====Eye rake====
When a wrestler moves their hand down past an opponent&#x27;s eye(s), making it appear that the wrestler has dragged their fingers across the opponent&#x27;s eye(s), to cause pain and visual problems.

====Hair pull====
As the name implies, this move sees one wrestler take advantage of another&#x27;s long hair by pulling it. In modern mainstream wrestling, it is more commonly used by female wrestlers. Similarly to a submission hold in the ropes, or a choke, the wrestler is given a five count to stop, before being disqualified.

====Hangman====
Seen when a wrestler who is on the opposite side of the ring ropes from an opponent (on the &#x27;apron&#x27;) grabs the opponent by the head and drops down, forcing the opponent&#x27;s throat across the ropes. This is an illegal attack because of its use of the rope. A common variation sees the wrestler perform a catapult to the opponent while the opponent is lying down in between the bottom and second ropes.

=====Reverse hangman=====
Similar to the normal hangman, which sees the wrestler standing outside the ring or on the apron, grabs the back of the opponent&#x27;s head or neck (who is lying against the set of ropes, facing to the inside of the ring) into the ropes. The move can be alternatively called a &quot;reverse&quot; hotshot.

====Low blow====

A direct shot to the groin of an opponent; otherwise known as a groin attack, utilized by heel wrestlers such as Ric Flair and Jerry Lawler. It is an offense punishable by disqualification. This illegal attack is mainly used by heel superstars or valets to gain the upper hand on their male opponents. Although kicking an opponent in the groin is the most obvious method, the most popular version sees an attacking wrestler drop to their knees and raise their arm up between the opponent&#x27;s legs, striking the groin with the inside of their elbow-joint. Shinsuke Nakamura, Seth Rollins, Toru Yano and Daniel Bryan are other wrestlers who use the move.

Veteran wrestler Dustin Rhodes uses a unique version of this move as a finisher called &quot;Shattered Dreams&quot;. He begins by placing the dazed opponent into the corner, straddling both their legs across the middle ropes and seating them onto the second turnbuckle. The opponent often places both arms on the tope rope and their back against the top turnbuckle as they remain seated trying to recover as Dustin moves away from them to create space. He then charges forward to kick the second turnbuckle upward and into the opponent&#x27;s groin causing damage. He often used this move when the referee was distracted or knocked out. In other cases, an obvious loophole by the very nature of the move would allow it to be exploited as it Dustin doesn&#x27;t kick the opponent in the groin directly thus avoiding a DQ loss.

===Foreign objects===
Many items are used as weapons in professional wrestling. Some of the more common weapons used include chairs, guitars, folding tables, lifting belts, title belts, &quot;kendo sticks&quot;, trash cans and bells. While picking up the upper half of the ring steps for use as a weapon is illegal, slamming an opponent into the ring steps is not considered illegal, though it is frowned upon.

====Asian mist====
The illegal maneuver of spitting a colored liquid into the face of an opponent in professional wrestling. After doing so, the opponent will (in storyline) be blinded and experience intense stinging in the eyes. Asian mist can come in almost any color, but the most common one used is green. This was invented by The Great Kabuki and popularized by The Great Muta, Tajiri, Bushi and El Desperado.

====Chair shot====

A wrestler hits the opponent with a chair. In modern wrestling, folding chairs are used with the strike being performed with the flat face of the chair to slow the swing and distribute the impact, to prevent injury. Although chair shots to the body are legal in the WWE, chair shots to the head were banned in March 2010, due to high risk of concussion and long-term brain damage. AEW wrestler Shawn Spears executed a chair shot to the head of Cody at Fyter Fest in 2019, causing AEW to ban the move as well.

=====Chair thrust=====
This chair shot variation sees the wrestler placing the top of a folded chair under the opponent&#x27;s chin or by the Adam&#x27;s Apple, and then while holding the chair with one hand and the back of the opponent&#x27;s head with another, the wrestler hits the mat with the legs of the folded chair while still placed under the opponent&#x27;s chin and simultaneously forcing the opponent&#x27;s head down, thus highly damaging that part of the opponent. The move can be alternatively called a guillotine shot.

=====Con-chair-to=====
This particular attack was popularized by Edge and Christian and involved two wrestlers sandwiching an opponent&#x27;s head between two chairs with a simultaneous chair shot from both sides. The &quot;One Man Con-chair-to&quot; involves a wrestler placing their opponent so that they are horizontal with their head resting on a chair, then hitting their head from above with a second chair, squashing the head of the opponent between both.

====Fireball====
The wrestler (using a concealed lighter) lights a piece of flash paper or a firecracker and throws it at the opponent, giving the impression of a supernatural ball of fire emerging from their hand. Other variation sets a wrestler spitting a flammable substance (e.g., alcohol) onto a lighter or torch. The move was used by Karrion Kross and Scarlett Bordeaux during their run in NXT. It was used by Chris Jericho during his run with the Jericho Appreciation Society in All Elite Wrestling.

====Guitar shot====
Simply involves breaking a guitar over an opponent&#x27;s head or against their back. Also known as the &quot;El Kabong&quot;, a reference to Quick Draw McGraw who would say this phrase prior to hitting someone with a guitar. This was used by The Honky Tonk Man, Jeff Jarrett, and most recently, Elias (Samson).

<doc id="1033828" wikidata="Q2044321" url="?curid=1033828" title="IBM PL/S">
<text>PL/S, short for Programming Language/Systems, is a &quot;machine-oriented&quot; programming language based on PL/I. It was developed by IBM in the late 1960s, under the name Basic Systems Language (BSL), as a replacement for assembly language on internal software projects; it included support for inline assembly and explicit control over register usage.

Early projects using PL/S were the batch utility, IEHMOVE, and the Time Sharing Option of MVT, TSO.

By the 1970s, IBM was rewriting its flagship operating system in PL/S. Although users frequently asked IBM to release PL/S for their use, IBM refused, saying that the product was proprietary. Their concern was that open PL/S would give competitors, Amdahl, Itel (National Advanced Systems), Storage Technology Corporation, Trilogy Systems, Magnuson Computer Systems, Fujitsu, Hitachi, and other PCM vendors a competitive advantage. However, even though they refused to make available a compiler, they shipped the PL/S source code to large parts of the OS to customers, many of whom thus became familiar with reading it.

Closed PL/S meant that only IBM could easily modify and enhance the operating system.

PL/S was succeeded by PL/S II, PL/S III and PL/AS (Programming Language/Advanced Systems), and then PL/X (Programming Language/Cross Systems). PL/DS (Programming Language/Distributed Systems) was a closely related language used to develop the DPPX operating system, and PL/DS II was a port of the S/370 architecture for the DPPX/370 port.

As the market for computers and software shifted away from IBM mainframes and MVS, IBM recanted and has offered the current versions of PL/S to select customers (ISVs through the Developer Partner program.)

== Rand Compiler for PL/S ==

The Rand RL/S compiler for IBMâs PL/S language was developed in the early 1970s by the Computation Center of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, CA.Â  It was implemented using the XPL compiler generator system by a team of three Rand programmers (R. Lawrence Clark, James S. Reiley, and the team leader David J. Smith).Â  The Rand RL/S compiler was developed independently of and without any assistance from IBM.Â  Only publicly available, non-copyrighted PL/S documentation and PL/S source and generated assembler code examples from IBM distributed source files for the MVS operating system were used.

RL/S is fully compatible with IBMâs PL/S II language.Â  This was assured by parsing many thousands of lines of IBM written PL/S code taken from the MVS distribution files.Â  The assembler language code produced by the Rand RL/S compiler is not identical to the code produced by IBMâs PL/S compiler, but it is functionally equivalent.

Rand has been a long-time contributor to computer research and development (e.g., JOSS, the Rand tablet, WYLBUR) and was an early pioneer in the definition and development of âpacket switchingâ network technology (Baran).Â  Rand was also one of the early nodes on the Arpanet, the Defense Departmentâs precursor to the Internet.

Randâs interest in PL/S derived from extensive modifications that the Computation Center had made to IBMâs MVT operating system, including modifications to improve the performance of the Arpanet on its IBM 360 computer.Â  Because MVT did not process network interrupts quickly enough to handle the Arpanet traffic, a âhypervisorâ was developed to allow Arpanet interrupts to be handled by specially written code while all other interrupts were handled by MVT.Â  When the MVS operating system was announced by IBM, Rand volunteered as an early âbetaâ site for the operating system with the intent of porting the hypervisor and other modifications to MVS.

As is well documented, IBM, however, refused to provide its PL/S compiler to customers, claiming it was a significant competitive advantage.Â  Not having the compiler meant that neither competitors nor customers could modify the MVS code at the PL/S source level, and could only modify the generated assembler code.Â  However, modifications made at the generated assembler level were easily obsoleted when IBM modified the PL/S source code and distributed re-generated assembler code. This was particularly true of modifications to PL/S generated data structures.Â  Rand, therefore, decided to develop its own version of a PL/S compiler to meet both operational objectives and contractual commitments.

The RL/S compiler was initially written in PL/I and later converted to RL/S to improve performance. With few restrictions, RL/S programs could be developed using IBMâs PL/I compiler for preprocessing and debugging, with the final code then compiled by RL/S.

The Rand RL/S language and compiler were publicly announced in August, 1976, at a Share meeting where numerous copies of the &quot;&quot; were distributed to attendees.Â  IBM quickly responded claiming the language was âproprietaryâ.Â  While Rand admitted no wrong doing in developing RL/S, Rand management agreed not to distribute the compiler publicly.Â  Rand, however, continued to use the RL/S language and compiler internally for many projects.

== Fujitsu &quot;Developments&quot; ==

A fully compliant PL/S compiler was &quot;developed&quot; by Fujitsu Ltd in the late-1970s, adapting IBM&#x27;s PL/I Optimizer compiler source code as its starting point. This PL/S compiler was used internally by Fujitsu, and also by Fujitsu&#x27;s external affiliates. Whether or not IBM was aware of this unlicensed use of its licensed intellectual property is not known. The phase names of this PL/S compiler were the same as the corresponding phase names of IBM&#x27;s PL/I Optimizer compiler, with the initial &quot;I&quot; (IBM) in each phase name being replaced by an initial &quot;J&quot; (Japan). All IBM copyright notices (source and object) within the modules were deleted to hide their true origin and ownership.

<text>The Sybil Brand Institute is a disused women&#x27;s jail in Monterey Park, Los Angeles County, California. It is named for 20th century jail conditions activist Sybil Brand.

The jail was completed in 1963 and at one time had over 2,000 inmates. It was closed in 1997 because of its poor physical condition as a result of damage suffered during the 1994 Northridge earthquake.

The jail was referenced in the legal drama TV series &quot;Perry Mason&quot; in the 1965 episode &quot;The Case of the Laughing Lady&quot;.

Hedy Lamarr was briefly jailed at the Sybil Brand Institute after being arrested for shoplifting in January 1966.

The jail is referenced in Kate Braverman&#x27;s 1993 fiction novel Wonders of the West starting on the very first page of the text. 

Since 1997, the former jail location has been used in movies and television shows such as &quot;24&quot;, &quot;Reno 911!: Miami&quot;, &quot;CSI&quot;, &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;, &quot;&quot; &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;, and &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;.

<text>The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) () is the general communications regulator for Ireland, covering almost all possible types of communications.

Founded on 1 December 2002, ComReg took over from the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation (ODTR), amongst other bodies. The ODTR was established in 1997 to take over the licensing and regulatory functions of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communication which related primarily to broadcasting and communications. The first (and only) Director of Telecommunications Regulation was Etain Doyle, who was subsequently appointed Chairperson of ComReg, on its establishment.

Under the Communications Regulation Act, 2002 the Minister for Communications, Marine, and Natural Resources appoints the chairperson and up to two other commissioners of ComReg. Currently the commissioners are Garrett Blaney, Helen Dixon and Robert Mourik.
Sectors regulated by ComReg include post, telecoms, internet, cable television, terrestrial television, radio and domain name under the Communications Regulation Act, 2002 (No. 20 of 2002), S.I. No. 510 of 2002 Communications Regulation Act 2002 (Establishment Day) Order 2002 and other acts. For a full list of legislation underpinning ComReg&#x27;s responsibilities.

ComReg set prices, allocate frequencies, and issue licenses to those involved in these sectors and provides statistical data, consumer product price comparisons to assist consumers in achieving value for money on a fair basis. In relation to terrestrial television and radio, the commission acts in conjunction with CoimisiÃºn na MeÃ¡n (formerly the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland). After the enactment of the Broadcasting Act 2009 RTÃ and TG4 authorities were disbanded and now come under CoimisiÃºn na MeÃ¡n&#x27;s remit.

ComReg is also tasked with enforcing wireless telegraphy legislation, in particular the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, in relation to use of the radio spectrum, which includes actions against pirate radio stations, distributors of mobile phone repeaters and other unlicensed users of radio spectrum.

<text>Hietaniemi beach ( or &#x27;, or&#x27;; colloquially &quot;Hietsu&quot;) is a popular sand beach in central Helsinki, Finland. It is located in the TÃ¶Ã¶lÃ¶ district, next to the Hietaniemi Cemetery and is the most popular beach in central Helsinki.

On the hill next to the beach is a stone sundial designed in 1931 by Gerda Qvist.

==History==
In the beginning of the 20th century the remote area of Hietaniemi was being used as a landfill and was converted into an area for sand storage. Sand was brought in by barges from the bottom of the sea for a number of years. The sand was never really used, however, but was just left there to spread. In 1929, the locals adopted the area as a sand beach.

Being close to the city centre, the beach is nowadays a popular summer destination for locals and tourists. It is also a popular place for playing beach volleyball, and since 1995 the Hietsu Beach Volley tournament has taken place there.

In 2013 and 2017, the beach hosted the Rock the Beach Festival and in 2014 the Sonisphere Festival. The Weekend Festival was held on the beach in August 2018.

<doc id="1033846" wikidata="Q4706706" url="?curid=1033846" title="Alan Gilbert (Australian academic)">
<text>Alan David Gilbert AO (11 September 1944 â 27 July 2010) was an Australian historian and academic administrator who was president and vice-chancellor of the University of Manchester between 2004 and 2010.

During his tenure (1996â2004) as vice-chancellor of the University of Melbourne, he pushed for and established Melbourne University Private, a private university offshoot which ultimately failed. This, and his well-known controversial views on private funding of universities, led to Richard Davis in 2002 dubbing him the &quot;doyen of economically rationalist vice-chancellors&quot;.

==Early academic career==
Gilbert graduated with a first class BA at the Australian National University in 1965, then took an MA in history and took a post as lecturer at the University of Papua New Guinea in 1967. He gained a scholarship at Nuffield College, Oxford and he was awarded a DPhil in 1973.

He returned to Australia as a lecturer at the University of New South Wales, where he established an academic reputation as an historian working in the social, socio-economic and religious history of modern Britain and Australia.

He was appointed professor of history in the Faculty of Military Studies in 1981. He was elected as a fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia in 1990. He became chair of the Faculty of Military Studies in 1982, and later pro-vice chancellor of the University of New South Wales (1988â1990). In 1991, he became vice-chancellor and principal of the University of Tasmania at the time of the merger of the university with the Launceston CAE.

==University of Melbourne==
In 1996, Gilbert was appointed vice-chancellor of the University of Melbourne. He played the key role in establishing and subsequently developing Melbourne University Private Limited (MUP), a private university established to work alongside the University of Melbourne, so as to circumvent regulations strictly limiting the money-making educational ventures of Australian universities. This was pursued despite numerous buildings on campus in serious states of disrepair and inadequate funding to allow lecture theatres to be heated.
The venture was a financial disaster and was widely criticised by academics, politicians and the media. To rescue MUP, the University Council borrowed $150 million from the National Australia Bank and agreed to provide additional money from its investment reserves. The present University of Melbourne VC, Glyn Davis, announced the closure of MUP on 7 May 2005, citing no need for such a venture now that market ventures are permitted in the public university sector, and their plans to integrate most of MUP back into the public university. Gilbert declined to comment on the actions of his successor. The building originally intended for MUP, and now a part of the public university, has been named the Alan Gilbert Building.

Gilbert attracted the ire of both students and staff. A staff strike took place on 22 October 1999 over lack of clarity over pay and conditions; administrative offices were occupied by students protesting the introduction of fee-paying places in 1997, and again in April 2001 when there were 70 arrests.

In the book &quot;Off Course: From Public Place to Market Place at Melbourne University&quot;, Gilbert was accused of making the university a &quot;quasi-privatised institution in the corporate mould&quot;.

==University of Manchester==
Gilbert left the University of Melbourne to be appointed president and vice chancellor of the new University of Manchester in England, an institution established in October 2004 by the merger of the Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST. He was quoted as saying he had &quot;no plans for a private university of Manchester&quot;, although he is said to advocate performance-related pay, a position thought likely to put him in conflict with the university lecturers union, the UCU.

Gilbert&#x27;s plans for the new university were ambitious:
Our aim is to make the University of Manchester one of the top 25 research-led universities in the world. It will be an educational and research powerhouse that is at home in England&#x27;s North-West and committed to regional as well as national and international agendas. Without seeking to emulate the social cachet of Oxbridge or America&#x27;s Ivy League, it will take its place confidently alongside those virtuoso institutions in its research capability and performance, in the quality of the students and staff that it attracts and in the reputation for scholarly excellence that it secures.

According to the university&#x27;s strategic plan (largely a copy of his earlier and now abandoned &quot;Melbourne Agenda&quot; (2002)) the university aims to have five Nobel Laureates on its staff by 2015, at least two of whom will have full-time appointments, and three of which it is intended to secure by 2007. During Gilbert&#x27;s tenure as vice chancellor, a Nobel Prize winner in economics, Joseph Stiglitz, was appointed the head of the Brooks World Poverty Institute at Manchester, and Sir John Sulston was appointed to a chair in the Faculty of Life Sciences. After Gilbert&#x27;s death Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, both of whom were appointed before Gilbert moved to Manchester, were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2010.

Gilbert continued:
By investing heavily in world class people and offering them state-of-the-art facilities, we aim to make the University of Manchester a destination of preference for many of the best students, teachers, researchers and scholars in the world. More than anything else, the success of the Manchester 2015 Agenda will be driven by the impact of internationally pre-eminent researchers and research clusters on the scholarly culture of the University generally.

Central to &quot;Project Unity&quot;, the name given to the plan to merge, was the idea of extending the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; of Oxford Cambridge and the London universities UCL and Imperial to a &quot;Golden Quadrilateral&quot;. &quot;With this work much progress has been made&quot; by the results for 2008.

Gilbert&#x27;s address to the university during the inauguration ceremony in the Whitworth Hall on 22 October 2004 made it very clear that he believed the plan was achievable and listed five key elements in the transition from &quot;good to great&quot;. quoting the book of that title by Jim Collins.

One of the intentions of Gilbert&#x27;s 2015 agenda was an improvement in Manchester&#x27;s position in international league tables. In 2004 the university ranked 78th in the Shanghai Jiao Tong Academic Ranking of World Universities, which rose to 53rd in 2005 following the merger with UMIST. Progress continued over the next few years, with the university being ranked 50th in 2006, 48th in 2007, and 40th in 2008, before falling back to 41st in 2009. This ranking measures indicators such as Nobel Prize winners and highly cited authors 154 are listed on ISI HighlyCited.com, for Manchester, and has improved partly as a result of the appointment of such people. Gilbert has been quoted in an interview as saying that &quot;there is only one ranking that matters-âthe world ranking of global universities produced by Shanghai Jiao Tong University&quot;.

Up to 2007 Â£388.5m had been spent on new buildings, funded in part by government grants and sale of other assets. However, Gilbert announced that due to increases in salary costs, energy bills and lower than expected revenue the university was about Â£30m (5% of its annual turnover) in deficit. Gilbert announced plans for 400 redundancies and he and the university management were criticised by the University and College Union. However Gilbert had as of 2007 honoured his pledge to achieve the staff reductions without compulsory redundancies, and in October 2007 announced that the university&#x27;s budget had been brought in to &quot;a modest surplus&quot; as a result mainly of a voluntary redundancy scheme.

In 2008 Gilbert announced a &quot;root-and-branch review&quot; of Manchester&#x27;s teaching quality that the university&#x27;s &#x27;strategy to join the world&#x27;s elite universities will be worthless unless staff can be &#x27;re-invented&#x27; to interact more with students&quot;.

In the aftermath of the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise Gilbert is quoted by Prof. Dame Nancy Rothwell as saying to the Senate of the university
It is vital for the University to be strengthening its research profile through research selectivity (in the sense of investing in quality and divesting in [sic] mediocrity) and research concentration (in the sense of investing to develop and/or sustain world leading clusters of supreme excellence). If we do not make major progress on that research re-profiling agenda over the next year or so we will have lost a priceless opportunity.

On 14 January 2010, the University of Manchester announced Alan Gilbert would be retiring from his position as president and vice chancellor of the university. Professor Dame Nancy Rothwell was then appointed acting vice chancellor. Her appointment as the new vice chancellor was announced on 21 June 2010.

October 2012 saw the opening of the Alan Gilbert &quot;Learning Commons&quot;, named in honour of the former president. This building provides a variety of state of the art individual and group study facilities, and is managed by the University of Manchester Library.

==Personal life and death==

Gilbert was married to Ingrid, whom he married in 1967. They had two daughters, Michelle and Fiona.

Gilbert died on 27 July 2010 in hospital in Manchester following a serious illness for the last few months of his life.

<doc id="1033847" wikidata="Q304043" url="?curid=1033847" title="Transient receptor potential channel">
<text>Transient receptor potential channels (TRP channels) are a group of ion channels located mostly on the plasma membrane of numerous animal cell types. Most of these are grouped into two broad groups: Group 1 includes TRPC ( &quot;C&quot; for canonical), TRPV (&quot;V&quot; for vanilloid), TRPVL (&quot;VL&quot; for vanilloid-like), TRPM (&quot;M&quot; for melastatin), TRPS (&quot;S&quot; for soromelastatin), TRPN (&quot;N&quot; for mechanoreceptor potential C), and TRPA (&quot;A&quot; for ankyrin). Group 2 consists of TRPP (&quot;P&quot; for polycystic) and TRPML (&quot;ML&quot; for mucolipin). Other less-well categorized TRP channels exist, including yeast channels and a number of Group 1 and Group 2 channels present in non-animals. Many of these channels mediate a variety of sensations such as pain, temperature, different kinds of taste, pressure, and vision. In the body, some TRP channels are thought to behave like microscopic thermometers and used in animals to sense hot or cold. Some TRP channels are activated by molecules found in spices like garlic (allicin), chili pepper (capsaicin), wasabi (allyl isothiocyanate); others are activated by menthol, camphor, peppermint, and cooling agents; yet others are activated by molecules found in cannabis (i.e., THC, CBD and CBN) or stevia. Some act as sensors of osmotic pressure, volume, stretch, and vibration. Most of the channels are activated or inhibited by signaling lipids and contribute to a family of lipid-gated ion channels.

These ion channels have a relatively non-selective permeability to cations, including sodium, calcium and magnesium.

TRP channels were initially discovered in the so-called &quot;transient receptor potential&quot; mutant (&quot;trp&quot;-mutant) strain of the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila&quot;, hence their name (see History of &quot;Drosophila&quot; TRP channels below). Later, TRP channels were found in vertebrates where they are ubiquitously expressed in many cell types and tissues. Most TRP channels are composed of 6 membrane-spanning helices with intracellular N- and C-termini. Mammalian TRP channels are activated and regulated by a wide variety of stimuli and are expressed throughout the body.

== Families ==
In the animal TRP superfamily there are currently 9 proposed families split into two groups, each family containing a number of subfamilies. Group one consists of TRPC, TRPV, TRPVL, TRPA, TRPM, TRPS, and TRPN, while group two contains TRPP and TRPML. There is an additional family labeled TRPY that is not always included in either of these groups. All of these sub-families are similar in that they are molecular sensing, non-selective cation channels that have six transmembrane segments, however, each sub-family is unique and shares little structural homology with one another. This uniqueness gives rise to the various sensory perception and regulation functions that TRP channels have throughout the body. Group one and group two vary in that both TRPP and TRPML of group two have a much longer extracellular loop between the S1 and S2 transmembrane segments. Another differentiating characteristic is that all the group one sub-families either contain an N-terminal intracellular ankyrin repeat sequence, a C-terminal TRP domain sequence, or bothâwhereas both group two sub-families have neither. Below are members of the sub-families and a brief description of each:

===TRPA===

TRPA, A for &quot;ankyrin&quot;, is named for the large amount of ankyrin repeats found near the N-terminus. TRPA is primarily found in afferent nociceptive nerve fibers and is associated with the amplification of pain signaling as well as cold pain hypersensitivity. These channels have been shown to be both mechanical receptors for pain and chemosensors activated by various chemical species, including isothiocyanates (pungent chemicals in substances such as mustard oil and wasabi), cannabinoids, general and local analgesics, and cinnamaldehyde.

While TRPA1 is expressed in a wide variety of animals, a variety of other TRPA channels exist outside of vertebrates. TRPA5, painless, pyrexia, and waterwitch are distinct phylogenetic branches within the TRPA clade, and are only evidenced to be expressed in crustaceans and insects, while HsTRPA arose as a Hymenoptera-specific duplication of waterwitch. Like TRPA1 and other TRP channels, these function as ion channels in a number of sensory systems. TRPA- or TRPA1-like channels also exists in a variety of species as a phylogenetically distinct clade, but these are less well understood.

===TRPC===

TRPC, C for &quot;canonical&quot;, is named for being the most closely related to &quot;Drosophila&quot; TRP, the namesake of TRP channels. The phylogeny of TRPC channels has not been resolved in detail, but they are present across animal taxa. There are actually only six TRPC channels expressed in humans because TRPC2 is found to be expressed solely in mice and is considered a pseudo-gene in humans; this is partly due to the role of TRPC2 in detecting pheromones, which mice have an increased ability compared to humans. Mutations in TRPC channels have been associated with respiratory diseases along with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in the kidneys. All TRPC channels are activated either by phospholipase C (PLC) or diacyglycerol (DAG).

===TRPML===

TRPML, ML for &quot;mucolipin&quot;, gets its name from the neurodevelopmental disorder mucolipidosis IV. Mucolipidosis IV was first discovered in 1974 by E.R. Berman who noticed abnormalities in the eyes of an infant. These abnormalities soon became associated with mutations to the MCOLN1 gene which encodes for the TRPML1 ion channel. TRPML is still not highly characterized. The three known vertebrate copies are restricted to jawed vertebrates, with some exceptions (e.g. &quot;Xenopus tropicalis&quot;).

===TRPM===

TRPM, M for &quot;melastatin&quot;, was found during a comparative genetic analysis between benign nevi and malignant nevi (melanoma). Mutations within TRPM channels have been associated with hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia. TRPM channels have also become known for their cold-sensing mechanisms, such is the case with TRPM8. Comparative studies have shown that the functional domains and critical amino acids of TRPM channels are highly conserved across species.

Phylogenetics has shown that TRPM channels are split into two major clades, Î±TRPM and Î²TRPM. Î±TRPMs include vertebrate TRPM1, TRPM3, and the &quot;chanzymes&quot; TRPM6 and TRPM7, as well as the only insect TRPM channel, among others. Î²TRPMs include, but are not limited to, vertebrate TRPM2, TRPM4, TRPM5, and TRPM8 (the cold and menthol sensor). Two additional major clades have been described: TRPMc, which is present only in a variety of arthropods, and a basal clade, which has since been proposed to be a distinct and separate TRP channel family (TRPS).

===TRPN===

TRPN was originally described in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; and &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; as nompC, a mechanically gated ion channel. Only a single TRPN, N for &quot;no mechanoreceptor potential C,&quot; or &quot;nompC&quot;, is known to be broadly expressed in animals (although some Cnidarians have more), and is notably only a pseudogene in amniote vertebrates. Despite TRPA being named for ankyrin repeats, TRPN channels are thought to have the most of any TRP channel, typically around 28, which are highly conserved across taxa Since its discovery, &quot;Drosophila&quot; nompC has been implicated in mechanosensation (including mechanical stimulation of the cuticle and sound detection) and cold nociception.

===TRPP===

TRPP, P for &quot;polycistin&quot;, is named for polycystic kidney disease, which is associated with these channels. These channels are also referred to as PKD (polycistic kidney disease) ion channels.

PKD2-like genes (examples include TRPP2, TRPP3, and TRPP5) encode canonical TRP channels. PKD1-like genes encode much larger proteins with 11 transmembrane segments, which do not have all the features of other TRP channels. However, 6 of the transmebrane segments of PKD1-like proteins have substantial sequence homology with TRP channels, indicating they may simply have diversified greatly from other closely related proteins.

Insects have a third sub-family of TRPP, called brividos, which participate in cold sensing.

===TRPS===
TRPS, S for Soromelastatin, was named as it forms a sister group to TRPM. TRPS is broadly present in animals, but notably absent in vertebrates and insects (among others). TRPS has not yet been well described functionally, though it is known that the &quot;C. elegans&quot; TRPS, known as CED-11, is a calcium channel which participates in apoptosis.

===TRPV===

TRPV, V for &quot;vanilloid&quot;, was originally discovered in &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, and is named for the vanilloid chemicals that activate some of these channels. These channels have been made famous for their association with molecules such as capsaicin (a TRPV1 agonist). In addition to the 6 known vertebrate paralogues, 2 major clades are known outside of the deterostomes: nanchung and Iav. Mechanistic studies of these latter clades have been largely restricted to &quot;Drosophila&quot;, but phylogenetic analyses has placed a number of other genes from Placozoa, Annelida, Cnidaria, Mollusca, and other arthropods within them. TRPV channels have also been described in protists.

===TRPVL===
TRPVL has been proposed to be a sister clade to TRPV, and is limited to the cnidarians &quot;Nematostella vectensis&quot; and &quot;Hydra magnipapillata&quot;, and the annelid &quot;Capitella teleta&quot;. Little is known concerning these channels.

===TRPY===
TRPY, Y for &quot;yeast&quot;, is highly localized to the yeast vacuole, which is the functional equivalent of a lysosome in a mammalian cell, and acts as a mechanosensor for vacuolar osmotic pressure. Patch clamp techniques and hyperosmotic stimulation have illustrated that TRPY plays a role in intracellular calcium release. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that TRPY1 does not form a part with the other metazoan TRP groups one and two, and is suggested to have evolved after the divergence of metazoans and fungi. Others have indicated that TRPY are more closely related to TRPP.

== Structure ==
TRP channels are composed of 6 membrane-spanning helices (S1-S6) with intracellular N- and C-termini. Mammalian TRP channels are activated and regulated by a wide variety of stimuli including many post-transcriptional mechanisms like phosphorylation, G-protein receptor coupling, ligand-gating, and ubiquitination. The receptors are found in almost all cell types and are largely localized in cell and organelle membranes, modulating ion entry.

Most TRP channels form homo- or heterotetramers when completely functional. The ion selectivity filter, pore, is formed by the complex combination of p-loops in the tetrameric protein, which are situated in the extracellular domain between the S5 and S6 transmembrane segments. As with most cation channels, TRP channels have negatively charged residues within the pore to attract the positively charged ions.

=== Group 1 Characteristics ===
Each channel in this group is structurally unique, which adds to the diversity of functions that TRP channels possess, however, there are some commonalities that distinguish this group from others. Starting from the intracellular N-terminus there are varying lengths of ankryin repeats (except in TRPM) that aid with membrane anchoring and other protein interactions. Shortly following S6 on the C-terminal end, there is a highly conserved TRP domain (except in TRPA) which is involved with gating modulation and channel multimerization. Other C-terminal modifications such as alpha-kinase domains in TRPM7 and M8 have been seen as well in this group.

=== Group 2 Characteristics ===
Group two most distinguishable trait is the long extracellular span between the S1 and S2 transmembrane segments. Members of group two are also lacking in ankryin repeats and a TRP domain. They have been shown, however, to have endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention sequences towards on the C-terminal end illustrating possible interactions with the ER.

== Function ==
TRP channels modulate ion entry driving forces and Ca2+ and Mg2+ transport machinery in the plasma membrane, where most of them are located. TRPs have important interactions with other proteins and often form signaling complexes, the exact pathways of which are unknown. TRP channels were initially discovered in the &quot;trp&quot; mutant strain of the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila&quot; which displayed transient elevation of potential in response to light stimuli and were so named &quot;transient receptor potential&quot; channels. TRPML channels function as intracellular calcium release channels and thus serve an important role in organelle regulation. Importantly, many of these channels mediate a variety of sensations like the sensations of pain, temperature, different kinds of taste, pressure, and vision. In the body, some TRP channels are thought to behave like microscopic thermometers and are used in animals to sense hot or cold. TRPs act as sensors of osmotic pressure, volume, stretch, and vibration. TRPs have been seen to have complex multidimensional roles in sensory signaling. Many TRPs function as intracellular calcium release channels.

=== Pain and temperature sensation ===
TRP ion channels convert energy into action potentials in somatosensory nociceptors. Thermo-TRP channels have a C-terminal domain that is responsible for thermosensation and have a specific interchangeable region that allows them to sense temperature stimuli that is tied to ligand regulatory processes. Although most TRP channels are modulated by changes in temperature, some have a crucial role in temperature sensation. There are at least 6 different Thermo-TRP channels and each plays a different role. For instance, TRPM8 relates to mechanisms of sensing cold, TRPV1 and TRPM3 contribute to heat and inflammation sensations, and TRPA1 facilitates many signaling pathways like sensory transduction, nociception, inflammation and oxidative stress.

=== Taste ===
TRPM5 is involved in taste signaling of sweet, bitter and umami tastes by modulating the signal pathway in type II taste receptor cells. TRPM5 is activated by the sweet glycosides found in the stevia plant.

Several other TRP channels play a significant role in chemosensation through sensory nerve endings in the mouth that are independent from taste buds. TRPA1 responds to mustard oil (allyl isothiocyanate), wasabi, and cinnamon, TRPA1 and TRPV1 responds to garlic (allicin), TRPV1 responds to chilli pepper (capsaicin), TRPM8 is activated by menthol, camphor, peppermint, and cooling agents; TRPV2 is activated by molecules (THC, CBD and CBN) found in marijuana.

== TRP-like channels in insect vision ==

The &quot;trp&quot;-mutant fruit flies, which lack a functional copy of trp gene, are characterized by a transient response to light, unlike wild-type flies that demonstrate a sustained photoreceptor cell activity in response to light.
A distantly related isoform of TRP channel, TRP-like channel (TRPL), was later identified in &quot;Drosophila&quot; photoreceptors, where it is expressed at approximately 10- to 20-fold lower levels than TRP protein. A mutant fly, &quot;trpl&quot;, was subsequently isolated. Apart from structural differences, the TRP and TRPL channels differ in cation permeability and pharmacological properties.
TRP/TRPL channels are solely responsible for depolarization of insect photoreceptor plasma membrane in response to light. When these channels open, they allow sodium and calcium to enter the cell down the concentration gradient, which depolarizes the membrane. Variations in light intensity affect the total number of open TRP/TRPL channels, and, therefore, the degree of membrane depolarization. These graded voltage responses propagate to photoreceptor synapses with second-order retinal neurons and further to the brain.

It is important to note that the mechanism of insect photoreception is dramatically different from that in mammals. Excitation of rhodopsin in mammalian photoreceptors leads to the hyperpolarization of the receptor membrane but not to depolarization as in the insect eye. In &quot;Drosophila&quot; and, it is presumed, other insects, a phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated signaling cascade links photoexcitation of rhodopsin to the opening of the TRP/TRPL channels. Although numerous activators of these channels such as phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were known for years, a key factor mediating chemical coupling between PLC and TRP/TRPL channels remained a mystery until recently. It was found that breakdown of a lipid product of PLC cascade, diacylglycerol (DAG), by the enzyme diacylglycerol lipase, generates PUFAs that can activate TRP channels, thus initiating membrane depolarization in response to light. This mechanism of TRP channel activation may be well-preserved among other cell types where these channels perform various functions.

== Clinical significance ==
Mutations in TRPs have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders, skeletal dysplasia, kidney disorders, and may play an important role in cancer. TRPs may make important therapeutic targets. There is significant clinical significance to TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV3 and TRPM8âs role as thermoreceptors, and TRPV4 and TRPA1âs role as mechanoreceptors; reduction of chronic pain may be possible by targeting ion channels involved in thermal, chemical, and mechanical sensation to reduce their sensitivity to stimuli. For instance the use of TRPV1 agonists would potentially inhibit nociception at TRPV1, particularly in pancreatic tissue where TRPV1 is highly expressed. The TRPV1 agonist capsaicin, found in chili peppers, has been indicated to relieve neuropathic pain. TRPV1 agonists inhibit nociception at TRPV1

=== Role in cancer ===
Altered expression of TRP proteins often leads to tumorigenesis, as reported for TRPV1, TRPV6, TRPC1, TRPC6, TRPM4, TRPM5, and TRPM8. TRPV1 and TRPV2 have been implicated in breast cancer. TRPV1 expression in aggregates found at endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus and/or surrounding these structures in breast cancer patients confer worse survival.

TRPM family of ion channels are particularly associated with prostate cancer where TRPM2 (and its long noncoding RNA &quot;TRPM2-AS&quot;), TRPM4, and TRPM8 are overexpressed in prostate cancer associated with more aggressive outcomes. TRPM3 has been shown to promote growth and autophagy in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, TRPM4 is overexpressed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma associated with poorer survival, while TRPM5 has oncogenic properties in melanoma.

TRP channels take center stage in modulating chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer. Some TRP channels such as TRPA1 and TRPC5 are tightly associated with drug resistance during cancer treatment; TRPC5-mediated high Ca2+ influx activates the transcription factor NFATC3 (Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells, Cytoplasmic 3), which triggers p-glycoprotein (p-gp) transcription. The overexpression of p-gp is widely recognized as a major factor in chemoresistance in cancer cells, as it functions as an active efflux pump that can remove various foreign substances, including chemotherapeutic agents, from within the cell.

Contrarily, other TRP channels, such as TRPV1 and TRPV2, have been demonstrated to potentiate the anti-tumorigenic effects of certain chemotherapeutic agents and TRPV2 is a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in triple negative breast cancer.

=== Role in inflammatory responses ===
In addition to TLR4 mediated pathways, certain members of the family of the transient receptor potential ion channels recognize LPS. LPS-mediated activation of TRPA1 was shown in mice and &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; flies. At higher concentrations, LPS activates other members of the sensory TRP channel family as well, such as TRPV1, TRPM3 and to some extent TRPM8. LPS is recognized by TRPV4 on epithelial cells. TRPV4 activation by LPS was necessary and sufficient to induce nitric oxide production with a bactericidal effect.

==History of &quot;Drosophila&quot; TRP channels==
The original TRP-mutant in &quot;Drosophila&quot; was first described by Cosens and Manning in 1969 as &quot;a mutant strain of &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; which, though behaving phototactically positive in a T-maze under low ambient light, is visually impaired and behaves as though blind&quot;. It also showed an abnormal electroretinogram response of photoreceptors to light which was transient rather than sustained as in the &quot;wild type&quot;. It was investigated subsequently by Baruch Minke, a post-doc in the group of William Pak, and named TRP according to its behavior in the ERG. The identity of the mutated protein was unknown until it was cloned by Craig Montell, a post-doctoral researcher in Gerald Rubin&#x27;s research group, in 1989, who noted its predicted structural relationship to channels known at the time and Roger Hardie and Baruch Minke who provided evidence in 1992 that it is an ion channel that opens in response to light stimulation. The TRPL channel was cloned and characterized in 1992 by the research group of Leonard Kelly. In 2013, Montell and his research group found that the TRPL (TRP-like) cation channel was a direct target for tastants in gustatory receptor neurons and could be reversibly down-regulated.

<text>The political views of Adolf Hitler, dictator of Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945, have presented historians and biographers with some difficulty. Hitler&#x27;s writings and methods were often adapted to need and circumstance, although there were some steady themes, including antisemitism, anti-communism, anti-slavism, anti-parliamentarianism, German (), belief in the superiority of an &quot;Aryan race&quot; and an extreme form of German nationalism. Hitler personally claimed he was fighting against &quot;Jewish Marxism&quot; and &quot;international Jewish finance&quot;.

Hitler&#x27;s political views were formed during three periods; namely (1) his years as a poverty-stricken young man in Vienna and Munich prior to World War I, during which he turned to nationalist-oriented political pamphlets and antisemitic newspapers out of distrust for mainstream newspapers and political parties; (2) the closing months of World War I when Germany lost the war, since Hitler claimed to have developed his extreme nationalism and allegedly pledged to &quot;save&quot; Germany from both external and internal enemies, who in his view betrayed it; (3) and the 1920s, during which his early political career began and he wrote . Hitler formally renounced his Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925, but did not acquire German citizenship until almost seven years later in 1932; thereby allowing him to run for public office. Hitler was influenced by Benito Mussolini, who was appointed Prime Minister of Italy in October 1922 after his &quot;March on Rome&quot;. In many ways, Hitler epitomized &quot;the force of personality in political life&quot; as described by Friedrich Meinecke. Hitler was essential to Nazism&#x27;s political appeal and its manifestation in Germany. So important were Hitler&#x27;s views that they immediately affected the political policies of Nazi Germany. He asserted the (), which advocated the absolute obedience of all subordinates to their superiors. Correspondingly, Hitler viewed himself at the top of both the party and government in this structure.

Hitler firmly believed that the force of &quot;will&quot; was decisive in determining the political course for a nation and rationalized his actions accordingly. Given that Hitler was appointed &quot;leader of the German Reich for life&quot;, he &quot;embodied the supreme power of the state and, as the delegate of the German people&quot;, it was his role to determine the &quot;outward form and structure of the Reich&quot;. To that end, Hitler&#x27;s political motivation consisted of an ideology that combined traditional German and Austrian antisemitism with an intellectualized racial doctrine resting on an admixture of bits and pieces of social Darwinism and the ideasâmostly obtained second-hand and only partially understoodâof Friedrich Nietzsche, Arthur Schopenhauer, Richard Wagner, Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Arthur de Gobineau and Alfred Rosenberg as well as Paul deÂ Lagarde, Georges Sorel, Alfred Ploetz and others.

== Pre-World War I ==
During his life in Vienna between 1907 and 1913, Hitler was exposed to racist rhetoric. Populists such as mayor Karl Lueger exploited the city&#x27;s prevalent anti-Semitic sentiment, blamed Jews &quot;for simply anything and everything&quot;, and also espoused German nationalist notions for political benefit. German nationalist sentiments were widespread in the Mariahilf district, where Hitler then lived. Hitler read local newspapers that promoted prejudice, along with pamphlets in relation to philosophers and theoreticians such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, Gustave Le Bon, and Arthur Schopenhauer.

Hitler developed fervent anti-Slavic sentiments during his life in Vienna. He became strongly influenced by the ideas of Nordicist philosophers like JÃ¶rg Lanz von Liebenfels and Houston Stewart Chamberlain who promulgated the theory of &quot;Aryan &quot;Herrenvolk&quot;&quot; and advocated notions of racial superiority of Nordic peoples. These philosophers claimed that the &quot;Aryan people&quot; were facing dangerous threats from those whom they considered inferior, such as Jews and Slavs. They further advocated for implementing what they regarded as &quot;racial purity&quot;, arguing that it was necessary for the survival of Nordic peoples in the modern world, while also denouncing communism. Hitler was also influenced by the Austrian politician Georg Ritter von SchÃ¶nerer, a radical pan-Germanic nationalist who campaigned for the incorporation of Austria into the German empire and fervently denounced the Jewish and Slavic minorities living in the Austro-Hungarian empire.

During his time in Vienna, Hitler also became vehemently opposed to ideas of social democracy. Earlier, he had a favourable opinion of the social democratic party, since he viewed them as a political faction that could facilitate the collapse of the Habsburg government, which he regarded as a pro-Slavic and anti-Germanic regime. Hitler regarded Slavs as inferior people who were incapable of political organising skills and regarded them as the biggest threat to pan-Germanic movement. Hitler eventually turned against the social democrats for their policy of accepting Slavic members within their ranks. Describing his experience with the social democrats he encountered in Vienna, Hitler wrote in his manifesto &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;: 

== Army intelligence agent ==

During World War I, Hitler was temporarily blinded in a mustard gas attack on 15 October 1918 for which he was hospitalised in Pasewalk. While there, Hitler learned of Germany&#x27;s defeat, with the armistice to take effect on 11 November. By his own accountâupon receiving this news, he suffered a second bout of blindness. Days after digesting this traumatic news, Hitler later stated his decision: &quot;...Â my own fate became known to meÂ ... IÂ ... decided to go into politics.&quot; On 19 November 1918, Hitler was discharged from the Pasewalk hospital and returned to Munich, which at the time was in a state of socialist upheaval. Arriving on 21 November, he was assigned to 7th Company of the 1st Replacement Battalion of the 2nd Infantry Regiment. In December he was reassigned to a Prisoner of War camp in Traunstein as a guard. There he would stay until the camp dissolved January 1919.

Returning to Munich, Hitler spent a few months in barracks waiting for reassignment. During this time Munich was a part of the People&#x27;s State of Bavaria, which was still in a state of chaos with a number of assassinations occurring including that of socialist Kurt Eisner who was shot dead in Munich by a German nationalist on 21 February 1919. Other acts of violence were the killings of both Major Paul Ritter vonÂ JahreiÃ and the conservative MP . In this political turmoil, Berlin sent in the military, whom the communists called the &quot;White Guards of Capitalism&quot;. On 3 April 1919, Hitler was elected as the liaison of his military battalion and again on 15 April. During this time he urged his unit to stay out of the fighting and not join either side. The Bavarian Soviet Republic was officially crushed on 6 May 1919, when Lt. General Burghard von Oven and his military forces declared the city secure. In the aftermath of arrests and executions, Hitler denounced a fellow liaison, Georg Dufter, as a Soviet &quot;radical rabble-rouser.&quot; Other testimony he gave to the military board of inquiry allowed them to root out other members of the military that &quot;had been infected with revolutionary fervor.&quot; For his anti-communist views he was allowed to avoid discharge when his unit was disbanded in May 1919.

In June 1919 he was moved to the demobilization office of the 2nd Infantry Regiment. Around this time the German military command released an edict that the army&#x27;s main priority was to &quot;carry out, in conjunction with the police, stricter surveillance of the population ... so that the ignition of any new unrest can be discovered and extinguished.&quot; In May 1919 Karl Mayr became commander of the 6th Battalion of the guards regiment in Munich and from 30 May the head of the &quot;Education and Propaganda Department&quot; (Dept Ib/P) of the Bavarian , Headquarters 4. In this capacity as head of the intelligence department, Mayr recruited Hitler as an undercover agent in early June 1919. Under Captain Mayr &quot;national thinking&quot; courses were arranged at the Reichswehrlager Lechfeld near Augsburg, with Hitler attending from 10 to 19 July 1919. During this time Hitler so impressed Mayr that he assigned him to an anti-bolshevik &quot;educational commando&quot; as one of 26 instructors in the summer of 1919.

These courses he taught helped popularize the notion that there was a scapegoat responsible for the outbreak of war and Germany&#x27;s defeat. Hitler&#x27;s own bitterness over the collapse of the war effort also began to shape his ideology. Like other German nationalists, he believed the () which claimed that the German Army, &quot;undefeated in the field&quot;, had been &quot;stabbed in the back&quot; on the home front by civilian leaders and Marxists, later dubbed the &quot;November criminals&quot;. &quot;International Jewry&quot; was described as a scourge composed of communists relentlessly destroying Germany. Such scapegoating was essential to Hitler&#x27;s political career and it seems that he genuinely believed that Jews were responsible for Germany&#x27;s post-war troubles.

The origin and development of Hitler&#x27;s anti-Semitism remains a matter of debate. His friend August Kubizek claimed that Hitler was a &quot;confirmed anti-Semite&quot; before he left Linz. However, historian Brigitte Hamann described Kubizek&#x27;s claim as &quot;problematical&quot;. While Hitler asserted in his autobiographical manifesto &quot;&quot; that he had first become an anti-Semite in Vienna, Reinhold Hanisch, who helped him sell his paintings, disagreed with that assertion. Hitler had dealings with Jews while living in Vienna. Historian Richard J. Evans stated that &quot;historians now generally agree that his notorious, murderous anti-Semitism emerged well after Germany&#x27;s defeat [in World War I], as a product of the paranoid &quot;stab-in-the-back&quot; explanation for the catastrophe&quot;.

In July 1919, Hitler was appointed () of an () of the , both to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the German Workers&#x27; Party (DAP). Much like the political activists in the DAP, Hitler blamed the loss of the war on Jewish intrigue at home and abroad, espousing -nationalist political beliefs with the intention of resurrecting Germany&#x27;s greatness by smashing the Versailles Treaty. Along those lines, Hitler proclaimed that the &quot;German yoke must be broken by German iron&quot; ().

== National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party ==
In September 1919 Hitler wrote what is often deemed his first antisemitic text, requested by Mayr as a reply to an inquiry by Adolf Gemlich, who had participated in the same &quot;educational courses&quot; as Hitler. In this report, Hitler argued for a &quot;rational anti-Semitism&quot; which would not resort to pogroms, but instead &quot;legally fight and remove the privileges enjoyed by the Jews as opposed to other foreigners living among us. Its final goal, however, must be the irrevocable removal of the Jews themselves&quot;. Most people at the time understood this as a call for forced expulsion. Europe has a long history of expelling Jews and the of the Inquisition.

While he studied the activities of the German Workers&#x27; Party (DAP), Hitler became impressed with founder Anton Drexler&#x27;s antisemitic, nationalist, anti-capitalist and anti-Marxist ideas. Drexler was impressed with Hitler&#x27;s oratory skills and invited him to join the DAP on 12 September 1919. On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party and within a week was accepted as party member 555 (the party began counting membership at 500 to give the impression they were a much larger party). In , Hitler later claimed to be the seventh party member, one of many myths in designed, as biographer Ian Kershaw writes, &quot;to serve the FÃ¼hrer legend&quot;.

Hitler was discharged from the army on 31 March 1920 and began working full-time for the party. Displaying his talent for oratory and propaganda skills, with the support of Drexler, Hitler became chief of propaganda for the party in early 1920. When early party members promulgated their 25-point manifesto on 24 February 1920 (co-authored by Hitler, Anton Drexler, Gottfried Feder and Dietrich Eckart), it was Hitler who penned the first point, revealing his intention to unify German-speaking peoples, claiming that the party demanded &quot;all Germans be gathered together in a Greater Germany on the basis of the right of all peoples to self-determination&quot;. By the spring of 1920, he engineered the change of name to the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (NSDAP), commonly known as the Nazi Party. Under his influence, the party adopted a modified swastika, a well-known good luck charm that had previously been used in Germany as a mark of &quot;volkishness&quot; and &quot;Aryanism&quot;, along with the Roman salute used by Italian fascists. At this time, the Nazi Party was one of many small extremist groups in Munich, but Hitler&#x27;s vitriolic beer hall speeches began attracting regular audiences. He became adept at using populist themes, including the use of scapegoats, who were blamed for his listeners&#x27; economic hardships. He gained notoriety for his rowdy polemic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians and especially against Marxists and Jews. Hitler used personal magnetism and an understanding of crowd psychology to advantage while engaged in public speaking.

While Hitler and Eckart were on a fundraising trip to Berlin in June 1921, a mutiny broke out within the Nazi Party in Munich. Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival German Socialist Party (DSP). Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would mean the end of the party. Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich. They capitulated to Hitler&#x27;s demand and on 29 July 1921 a special congress was convened to formalize Hitler as the new chairman (the vote was 543 for Hitler and one against).

Hitler asserted the (). The principle relied on absolute obedience of all subordinates to their superiors as he viewed the party structure and later the government structure as a pyramid, with himselfâthe infallible leaderâat the apex. Rank in the party was not determined by electionsâpositions were filled through appointment by those of higher rank, who demanded unquestioning obedience to the will of the leader.

Early followers of the party included Rudolf Hess, Hermann GÃ¶ring (command of the (SA) as in 1923), Ernst RÃ¶hm (later head of the SA), Alfred Rosenberg (prominent racial theorist), Gregor Strasser, Dietrich Eckart (a key founder of the party), Hermann Esser, Ludwig Maximilian Erwin von Scheubner-Richter and Erich Ludendorff (Field-Marshal who was the party&#x27;s candidate for President of the Republic in 1925).

== Beer Hall Putsch ==
Hitler enlisted the help of World War I General Ludendorff to try to seize power in Munich (the capital of Bavaria) in an attempt later known as the &quot;Beer Hall &quot;Putsch&quot;&quot; of 8â9 November 1923. This would be a step in the seizure of power nationwide, overthrowing the Weimar Republic in Berlin. On 8 November, Hitler&#x27;s forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters; however, neither the army nor the state police joined forces with him. The next day, Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the Bavarian War Ministry to overthrow the Bavarian government on their &quot;March on Berlin&quot;. Hitler wanted to emulate Benito Mussolini&#x27;s &quot;March on Rome&quot; (1922) by staging his own coup in Bavaria to be followed by a challenge to the government in Berlin. However, the Bavarian authorities ordered the police to stand their ground. The putschists were dispersed after a short firefight in the streets near the Feldherrnhalle. In all, sixteen Nazi members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup.

Hitler fled to the home of Ernst Hanfstaengl and by some accounts contemplated suicide, although this state of mind has been disputed. Hitler was depressed but calm when he was arrested on 11 November 1923. Fearing &quot;left-wing&quot; members of the Nazi Party might try to seize leadership from him during his incarceration, Hitler quickly appointed Alfred Rosenberg as the party&#x27;s temporary leader.

== &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; ==

Beginning in February 1924, Hitler was tried for high treason before the special People&#x27;s Court in Munich. He used his trial as an opportunity to spread his message throughout Germany. At one point during the trial, Hitler discussed political leadership, during which he stated that leading people was not a matter of political science () but an innate ability, one of statecraft (). He further elaborated by claiming that out of 10,000 politicians, only one, Otto von Bismarck, emerged, subtly implying that he too had been born with this gift. Continuing, he declared that it was not Karl Marx who stirred the masses and ignited the Russian Revolution, but Vladimir Lenin, by making his appeal to the senses rather than the mind. 

Hitler&#x27;s speeches during the trial made him famous, but they did not exonerate him. In April 1924, he was sentenced to five years&#x27; imprisonment in Landsberg Prison, where he received preferential treatment from sympathetic guards and received substantial quantities of fan mail, including funds and other forms of assistance. During 1923 and 1924 at Landsberg, he dictated the first volume of (&quot;My Struggle&quot;) to his deputy Rudolf Hess. Originally entitled &quot;Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice&quot;, his publisher shortened the title to .

The book, dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart, was an autobiography and exposition of his ideology. In , Hitler speaks at length about his youth, his early days in the Nazi Party and general ideas on politics, including the transformation of German society into one based on race, with some passages implying genocide. Published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, it sold 228,000 copies between 1925 and 1932. In 1933, Hitler&#x27;s first year in office, 1,000,000 copies were sold. The book acts as a reference, giving insight into the world view from which Hitler never wavered throughout his life.

In &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, Hitler states that he had little interest in politics as a child, aspiring instead to become a painter. Like other boys in his part of Austria, he was attracted to pan-Germanism, but his intellectual pursuits were generally those of a dilettante. Hitler portrays himself as a born leader interested in knightly adventures and exploration. By the time he was 11, Hitler was a nationalist and interested in history.

Hitler never finished his primary schooling, dropping out by the time he was 16. He devoted his attention instead to his artistic pursuits, which led him to move to Vienna in 1905. Hitler was later to proclaim that he learned some hard lessons in Vienna, namely that life was a critical struggle between the weak and the strong; in Hitler&#x27;s worldview, morality did not matter, and everything simply boiled down to &quot;victory and defeat&quot;.

While Hitler was incarcerated at the Landsberg prison writing , he had routine visits from the respected First World War veteran, Major General Dr. Karl Haushofer, who was the chair of the military science and geography department at the University of Munich. These meetings consisted of lectures and academic briefings on geopolitics, most certainly covering the Nazi ideal of and which likely influenced the views Hitler laid out in . Haushofer espoused the theory that Germany was defeated in World War I by lack of sufficient space and autarchy. More importantly, Haushofer believed that nations which rested their power upon command of the sea and maritime trade routes were doomed to fail, since any such control &quot;would soon be broken&quot;, writing that human history stood &quot;at the great turning-point in the favourable position of the island empires&quot;. Hitler believed that for Germany to expand its influence, it would have to rely on continental space and abundant arable soil, which could only be found eastward. 

Influenced by Haushofer&#x27;s theories, Hitler believed it was Germany&#x27;s right to seize the cultivatable land in Russia, since the earth belonged to those people willing to till it &quot;industriously&quot;. Describing the Russians in the harshest of terms while intimating that the German people were more deserving by virtue of their alleged superior intellect, Hitler stated: &quot;It is criminal to ask an intelligent people to limit its children in order that a lazy and stupid people next door can literally abuse a gigantic surface of the earth&quot;. Presaging this Nazi goal, Hitler wrote in : &quot;Without consideration of traditions and prejudices, Germany must find the courage to gather our people and their strength for an advance along the road that will lead this people from its present restricted living space to new land and soil, and hence also free it from the danger of vanishing from the earth or of serving others as a slave nation&quot;. In this sense, social Darwinism and geography were merged in Hitler&#x27;s mind.

Many historians contend that Hitler&#x27;s essential character and political philosophy can be discovered in . Historian James Joll once claimed that constituted &quot;all of Hitler&#x27;s beliefs, most of his programme and much of his character&quot;. According to Andreas Hillgruber, evident within the text of is nothing less than the very crux of Hitler&#x27;s program. One of Hitler&#x27;s foremost goals was that Germany should become &quot;a World Power&quot; on the geopolitical stage, or as he stated, &quot;it will not continue to exist at all&quot;. Biographer Joachim Fest asserted that contained a &quot;remarkably faithful portrait of its author&quot;.

In , Hitler categorized human beings by their physical attributes, claiming German or Nordic Aryans were at the top of the hierarchy, while assigning the bottom orders to Jews and Romani. Hitler claimed that dominated people benefit by learning from superior Aryans and said the Jews were conspiring to keep this &quot;master race&quot; from rightfully ruling the world by diluting its racial and cultural purity and exhorting Aryans to believe in equality rather than superiority and inferiority. Within , Hitler describes a struggle for world domination, an ongoing racial, cultural and political battle between Aryans and Jews, the necessary racial purification of the German people and the need for German imperial expansion and colonisation eastwards. According to Hitler and other pan-German thinkers, Germany needed to obtain additional living space or which would properly nurture the &quot;historic destiny&quot; of the German people. This was a key idea he made central in his foreign policy. 

Hitler wrote in of his hatred of what he believed were the world&#x27;s twin evils, namely communism and Judaism. He said his aim was to eradicate both from Germany and moreover stressed his intention to unite all Germans in the process of destroying them.

== &quot;VÃ¶lkisch&quot; nationalism ==

Hitler was a pan-Germanic nationalist whose ideology was built around a philosophically authoritarian, anti-Marxist, antisemitic and anti-democratic worldview. Such views of the world in the wake of the fledgling Weimar government were not uncommon in Germany since democratic/parliamentary governance seemed ineffectual to solve Germany&#x27;s problems. Correspondingly, veterans of the First World War and like-minded nationalists formed the which promoted expansionism, soldierly camaraderie and heroic leadership, all under the guise of traditions like ethnic and linguistic nationalism, but which also included obedience to authority as well as the belief in political salvation through decisive leadership. The parties began to fractionalize during Hitler&#x27;s absence from the revolutionary scene in Germany after the failed &quot;Beer Hall Putsch&quot; of November 1923. When he re-emerged upon release from Landsberg Prison, his importance to the movement was obvious and he came to believe that he was the realization of nationalistic ideals in a sort of near messianic narcissism which included his conviction to shake off the restrictive Treaty of Versailles and to &quot;restore Germany&#x27;s might and power&quot;, creating a reborn German nation as the chosen leader of the Nazi Party.

Hitler stressed the ideology, claiming Germanic/Aryan superiority in :

::Every manifestation of human culture, every product of art, science and technical skill, which we see before our eyes today, is almost exclusively the product of the Aryan creative power. This very fact fully justifies the conclusion that it was the Aryan alone who founded a superior type of humanity; therefore he represents the archetype of what we understand by the term: MAN. He is the Prometheus of mankind, from whose shining brow the divine spark of genius has at all times flashed forth, always kindling anew that fire which, in the form of knowledge, illuminated the dark night by drawing aside the veil of mystery and thus showing man how to rise and become master over all the other beings on the earth. Should he be forced to disappear, a profound darkness will descend on the earth; within a few thousand years human culture will vanish and the world will become a desert.

The nationalism of Hitler and convinced Nazis encompassed the notion that the German were epitomized by German farmers and peasants; people who remained uncorrupted by modern ideals and whose greatest attribute was their &quot;cheerful subservience&quot; and their capacity to respond to their &quot;monarchical calling&quot;. Hitler was their new monarch in a manner of speaking. nationalism also forged into its ideals, the importance of nature, the centrality of a knightly savior (Hitler in this case) and the belief in the superior Aryan. Antisemitism remained a key component of the movement and a permanent undercurrent throughout conservative parties in German history and after many years culminated with the view that the Jews were the only thing standing in the way of the ideal society. As Germany&#x27;s newfound nationalist leader, Hitler initiated a policy of ethnic nationalism replete with directives to eliminate Jews and other identified enemies as Nazism ultimately became the religion of the movement and the &quot;irrational became concrete&quot; under the terms of its &quot;ideological framework&quot;.

== Social conservatism ==
Hitler and the Nazis promoted a socially conservative view concerning many aspects of life, supported by harsh discipline and a militaristic point of view. Conservative opinions about sexuality amid the Nazis led to extreme homophobia which resulted in the systematic persecution of homosexuals. Hitler and his paladins also controlled what constituted acceptable artistic expression in Nazi Germany, abolishing what they considered to be &quot;degenerate art&quot;. The Nazis strongly discouraged and in some cases outright rejected the following behaviors, namely the use of cosmetics, premarital sex, prostitution, pornography, sexual vices, smoking and excessive drinking. In many ways, there was a distinct anti-intellectualism present within Nazi philosophy. Hearkening back to a simpler time, Hitler and the Nazis attempted to vindicate the glorious past as the key to a more promising future.

Evidence of Hitler&#x27;s disdain for Weimar&#x27;s cultural and social decadence appears on multiple occasions in . In his seminal tome, he expresses an ultraconservatism:
Hitler raved against what he considered to be tasteless and morally destructive art on display throughout Germany in , calling some of it morbid and declaring that &quot;people would have benefited by not visiting them at all&quot;. Convinced that it was necessary to show the German people what comprised, &quot;degenerate art&quot; so as to protect them in the future, Hitler arranged for a formally commissioned exhibit in July 1937 of specially selected carvings, sculptures, and paintings. Once the exhibit was at an end, selected artists&#x27; works were banned from Nazi Germany.

Well known was Hitler&#x27;s vehement opposition to racial-mixing. He was also a natalist as he believed, as did other pan-Germans, that Germans had an obligation to procreate:
Another area of concern for Hitler and which was mentioned by his childhood companion in Vienna, August Kubizek, was prostitution. Hitler associated it with venereal disease and cultural decline. Moreover, Hitler found the practice counter to proper family development and displayed a puritanical view in , writing:
He goes on asserting that prostitution was dangerous and intimated much more significant, destructive socio-political implications. Once Hitler came to power, his regime moved against all forms of sexual deviations and sexual crimes, especially homosexuality, which was prosecuted as a crime as many as 30,000 times between 1934 and 1939. Hitler&#x27;s social conservatism was so extreme towards homosexuals that he deemed them &quot;enemies of the State&quot; and grouped them in the same category as Jews and communists; a special department of the Gestapo was formed to deal with the matter.

Hitler&#x27;s general perception about women was ultra-conservative and patriarchal, with their foremost task being a domestic one as a mother of children who worked contentedly at home, ensuring it remained clean and orderly. Meanwhile, it was the woman&#x27;s role to educate her children to be conscious of their importance as Aryans and instill within them a commitment to their ethnic community. Consequently, Hitler believed women had no place in public or political life due to their differing nature from men. Like many Romantic artists, musicians, and writers, the Nazis valued strength, passion, frank declarations of feelings and deep devotion to family and community (with women being seen as the center of the family in Nazi Germany). So great was Hitler&#x27;s influence in all political aspects of social life that even education for children was subordinate to his opinion. Profoundly anti-intellectual and against conventional education for children, Hitler determined instead that training and education should be designed to create young German &quot;national comrades&quot; who were utterly convinced of their &quot;superiority to others&quot;. Moreover, Hitler wanted to create young German soldiers who were willing to fight for their convictions so they were accordingly indoctrinated by Nazi propaganda, trained in military discipline and taught obedience to authority in the Hitler Youth.

== Contempt for democracy ==
Hitler blamed Germany&#x27;s parliamentary government for many of the nation&#x27;s ills. The Nazis and especially Hitler associated democracy with the failed Weimar government and the punitive Treaty of Versailles. Hitler often denounced democracy, equating it with internationalism. Since democratic ideals espoused equality for all men, it represented to Hitler and his Nazi ideologues the notion of mob rule and the hatred of excellence. Not only was democracy antithetical to their social-Darwinist abstractions, but its international-capitalist framework was considered an exclusively Jewish-derived conception. Hitler also thought democracy was nothing more than a preliminary stage of Bolshevism.

Hitler believed in the leader principle (hence his title, the Leader, ) and considered it ludicrous that an idea of governance or morality could be held by the people above the power of the leader. Joachim Fest described a 1930 confrontation between Hitler and Otto Strasser as such: &quot;Now Hitler took Strasser to task for placing &#x27;the idea&#x27; above the FÃ¼hrer and wanting &#x27;to give every party comrade the right to decide the nature of the idea, even to decide whether or not the FÃ¼hrer is true to the so-called idea.&#x27; That, he cried angrily, was the worst kind of democracy, for which there was no place in their movement. &#x27;With us the FÃ¼hrer and the idea are one and the same, and every party comrade has to do what the FÃ¼hrer commands, for he embodies the idea and he alone knows its ultimate goal&#x27;&quot;.

Although Hitler realized that his ascension to power required the use of the Weimar Republic&#x27;s parliamentary system (founded on democratic principles), he never intended for the continuation of democratic governance once in control. Contrarily, Hitler proclaimed that he would &quot;destroy democracy with the weapons of democracy&quot;. The rapid transition made by the Nazis once they assumed control clearly reveals that Hitler succeeded in this regard. For the most part, democratic governance was never embraced by the German masses or by the elite. The ill-fated Weimar democracy&#x27;s inability to provide economic relief to the German people during the Great Depression further enhanced its image as an ineffectual system of government amid the masses. Hitler offered people the prospect of a &quot;new and better society&quot;. He exploited the conditions in Germany in the ultimate expression of political opportunism when he brought his dictatorial and totalitarian government to power and thereafter attempting to impose himself and his system upon the world in the process.

== Anti-communism ==
In Hitler&#x27;s mind, communism was a major enemy of Germany, an enemy he often mentions in . During the trial for his involvement in the Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler claimed that his singular goal was to assist the German government in &quot;fighting Marxism&quot;. Marxism, Bolshevism, and communism were interchangeable terms for Hitler as evidenced by their use in :

Later in his seminal tome, Hitler advocated for &quot;the destruction of Marxism in all its shapes and forms&quot;. According to Hitler, Marxism was a Jewish strategy to subjugate Germany and the world, as well as a mental and political form of slavery. From Hitler&#x27;s vantage point, Bolsheviks existed to serve &quot;Jewish international finance&quot;. When the British tried negotiating with Hitler in 1935 by including Germany in the extension of the Locarno Pact, he rejected their offer and instead assured them that German rearmament was important in safeguarding Europe against communism, a move which clearly showed his anti-communist proclivities.

In 1939, Hitler told the Swiss Commissioner to the League of Nations Carl Burckhardt that everything he was undertaking was &quot;directed against Russia&quot; and that &quot;if those in the West are too stupid or too blind to understand this, then I shall be forced to come to an understanding with the Russians to beat the West, and then, after its defeat, turn with all my concerted force against the Soviet Union&quot;. When Hitler finally ordered the attack against the Soviet Union, it was the fulfillment of his ultimate goal and the most important campaign in his estimation, as it comprised a struggle of &quot;the chosen Aryan people against Jewish Bolsheviks&quot;.

Biographer Alan Bullock avows Hitler &quot;laid great stress&quot; on the need to concentrate on a single enemy, an enemy he lumps together as &quot;Marxism and the Jew&quot;. Shortly in the wake of the Commissar Order, a directive pursuant to the German invasion of the Soviet Union, SS Deputy Reinhard Heydrich informed the SS of Hitler&#x27;s geopolitical philosophy which conflated Bolshevism and Jews, writing that &quot;eastern Jewry is the intellectual reservoir of Bolshevism and in the FÃ¼hrer&#x27;s view must therefore be annihilated&quot;. Considering the eventual Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa), no additional inducements are really requisite concerning Hitler&#x27;s hatred of communism, particularly since the Nazi persecution and extermination of these groups was not only systematic, but it was extensive both within Germany and only intensified in the occupied zones during the war under Hitler&#x27;s leadership.

Because Nazism co-opted the popular success of socialism and Communism among working people while simultaneously promising to destroy Communism and offer an alternative to it, Hitler&#x27;s anti-communist program allowed industrialists with traditional conservative views (tending toward monarchism, aristocracy and &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism) to cast their lot with and help underwrite the Nazi rise to power. When asked in a 1923 interview why Hitler called himself a National Socialist when the Nazi Party was &quot;the very antithesis of that commonly accredited to socialism&quot;, Hitler responded: &quot;Socialism is the science of dealing with the common weal. Communism is not Socialism. Marxism is not Socialism. The Marxians have stolen the term and confused its meaning. I shall take Socialism away from the Socialists.&quot;

== Antisemitism, anti-slavism&quot;, Lebensraum&quot;, and the invasion of the Soviet Union ==

Antisemitism and anti-Slavism were central components in Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Lebensraum&quot; settler-colonial programme, and constituted the ideological basis of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. Hitler&#x27;s push for eastward expansion (&quot;&quot;Drang nach Osten&quot;) of German territories, outlined in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;&quot;, was driven significantly by his hatred and contempt of Slavs and Jews alike, both groups well-represented in the East. This contempt included the notion that the Slavs in particular, were manipulated by the Jews; Hitler being utterly convinced that the people of Soviet Russia were &quot;controlled by Jews.&quot;

In this, Hitler exploited the historic Prussian and German revulsion against Slavs to ideologically defend his bio-political agenda to German audiences. There were also deeply antisemitic and anti-Slavic elements among German scholars, particularly by the twentieth-century concerning the need for &quot;Lebensraum&quot;, who opined that the vast natural resources of the East were &quot;wasted on racially âinferiorâ peoples like Slavs and Jews&quot;.

Historian Roderick Stackelberg contended that Hitler&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union was the result of &quot;mutually reinforcing ideological, racial, and geopolitical assumptions&quot; that Hitler had plainly laid out in . German historian Andreas Hillgruber shared Stackelberg&#x27;s view. In fact, Hillgruber encapsulates Hitler&#x27;s political views (which drove German policy throughout his rule) in summary through the invasion of the Soviet Union. He places it within the context of Hitler&#x27;s intent to create a continental Reich which included the destruction of the Jews. According to Hillgruber, Hitler had the following objectives in mind when he invaded the former Soviet Union:

::1. The total eradication of all forms of &quot;Judeo-Bolshevik&quot; leadership, which encompassed its perceived biological roots, namely the millions of Jews occupying central and eastern Europe.
::2. The requisite acquisition of &quot;Lebensraum&quot; or colonial space necessary for German settlement in the finest and most arable territories within Russia, or in those parts of Russia which provided political or strategic advantages in Hitler&#x27;s mind.
::3. The subjugation and decimation of the Slavic people, which was to be divided into four German territories or &quot;Reich Commissariats&quot; entitled Ostland, Ukraine, Moskovia and Caucasus, with each subordinated to German &quot;viceroys&quot;. One of the principal aims of German leadership in these Reich Commissariats would be the cancellation of any semblance or memory of Russian statehood and the conditioning of these subordinated &quot;states&quot; to German mastery.
::4. Ultimately, a &quot;great space&quot; autarchy in Continental Europe under German suzerainty would result, one capable of defeating any possible Allied blockade and for whom the vanquished eastern territories could provide a theoretically inexhaustible source of raw materials and food necessary for any protracted war against the Allied powers. The establishment of this &quot;German Reich of the Germanic nation&quot; also included in its planning to feed its soldiers off the Russian land, although that meant that &quot;many millions of people will be starved to death&quot;, a directive already contemplated by the Economic Staff East no later than 2 May 1941.

Not alone in this interpretation of Hitler&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union as a move of continental expansion and one with an antisemitic eliminationist political intent, Hillgruber is joined by the likes of historian Karl Dietrich Bracher, among others. In his work &quot;The German Dictatorship&quot;, Bracher called the invasion the consequence of Hitler&#x27;s &quot;ideological obsession&quot; and stated that &quot;Hitler&#x27;s drive for territorial expansion and the relentless expansion of the SS state ushered in the final phase of National Socialist rule&quot;. That final phase proved disastrous for the Jews, Slavs, Roma-Sinti and countless others.

== The Holocaust ==

Among scholars of the Nazi era, Hitler&#x27;s role and relationship to the regime and the Holocaust has been a source of consternation and acrimonious historiographical debate. Biographer Ian Kershaw wrote that for historians Hitler was &quot;unreachable&quot; and that he was &quot;cocooned in the silence of the sources&quot;. What Kershaw was referencing was the absence of any clear political directives accompanied by Hitler&#x27;s signed authorization (primary source documents) regarding the atrocities carried out by his Nazi underlings. Given the abounding circumstantial evidence in Hitler&#x27;s speeches, writing in , administrative meeting notes taken by subordinates and the recollections of those in or near his inner-circle, it seems that his political intention was for Jews, Slavs and other &quot;enemies&quot; of the Nazi state to be persecuted without mercy in lieu of how gradual the process actually developed. A debate between two primary schools of thought emerged about Hitler&#x27;s political role in Nazi policy and the Holocaust. One is termed intentionalist, represented by scholars who contend that virtually all Nazi policies (including the extermination of the Jews) were resultant from Hitler&#x27;s desires; whereas the other school, entitled functionalist/structuralist, consists of scholars who see the intensification of Nazi persecution policies due to power struggles within the Nazi government as his minions attempted to &quot;interpret&quot; their master&#x27;s wishes, often acting autonomously.

Either way, antisemitism always constituted one of the most important aspects of Hitler&#x27;s political views. Historian Peter Longerich writes: &quot;There can be no doubt that Hitler&#x27;s behaviour during his entire political career... was characterised by radical antisemitism&quot;. Correspondingly, Germanic cultural and racial purity remained paramount in his understanding of the world, having once exclaimed: &quot;The greatest danger is and remains for us, the alien racial poison in our body. All other dangers are transitory&quot;.

Hitler wrote his first antisemitic letter to Adolf Gemlich on 16 September 1919 stating that Jews were a race and not a religious group and that the aim for the government &quot;must unshakably be the removal of the Jews altogether&quot;. According to journalist and retired major, Josef Hell, Hitler told him in 1922 that: &quot;Once I really am in power, my first and foremost task will be the annihilation of the Jews.&quot; Throughout , Hitler employs biological crudity by describing the Jews as &quot;parasites&quot; or &quot;vermin&quot;. Reflecting back on the beginning of the First World War, Hitler makes the eerily prescient statement that if &quot;twelve or fifteen thousand of these Hebrew corrupters of the people had been held under poison gas, as happened to hundreds of thousands of our very best German workers in the field, the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain.&quot;
Underlining the argument that Hitler had overt eliminationist intentions for the Jews is the &quot;prophecy&quot; quote from the 30 January 1939 Reichstag speech:
German historian Klaus Hildebrand insisted that Hitler&#x27;s moral responsibility for the Holocaust was the culmination of his pathological hatred of the Jews and his ideology of &quot;racial dogma&quot; formed the basis of Nazi genocide. Historian David Welch asserts that even if Hitler never gave the direct order for the implementation of the Final Solution, this is nothing more than a &quot;red herring&quot; as it fails to recognize his &quot;leadership style&quot; where Hitler&#x27;s simple verbal statements were sufficient to launch initiatives &quot;from below&quot;. Those &quot;working towards the FÃ¼hrer&quot; would often implement &quot;his totalitarian vision without written authority&quot;. Longerich also stresses, &quot;A history of the &#x27;final solution&#x27; must... take account of his central role in the decision-making process, not least because Hitler&#x27;s constant authorization and legitimization of this policy articulated the central importance of persecuting the Jews for National Socialist policies as a whole.&quot;

Throughout his work &quot;Hitler and the Final Solution,&quot; historian Gerald Fleming demonstrates that on multiple occasions Heinrich Himmler referenced a FÃ¼hrer-Order concerning the destruction of the Jews, making it abundantly clear that Hitler had at the very least verbally issued a command on the matter. The diary entries of Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels allude to Hitler being the driving force behind the Nazi genocide, that he followed the subject closely and that Goebbels even described Hitler as &quot;uncompromising&quot; about eliminating the Jews. Taking the scale of the logistical operations that the Holocaust comprised in the middle of a war into consideration alone, it is highly unlikely, if not impossible, that the extermination of so many people and the coordination of such an extensive effort could have occurred in the absence of Hitler&#x27;s authorization. As Welch relates, if Himmler was the &quot;architect of genocide&quot;, he was merely &quot;an instrument of Hitler&#x27;s will&quot;. In the final analysis, Hitler was essentially omnipotent as the FÃ¼hrer of Nazi Germany with all encompassing power as the &quot;supreme legislator, supreme administrator, and supreme judge&quot; along with being the &quot;leader of the Party, the Army, and the people&quot;. Hitler ruled the Nazi Party autocratically by asserting the (leader principle). The principle relied on absolute obedience of all subordinates to their superiors; thus he viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himselfâthe infallible leaderâat the apex.

<text>Julius Korir (born 21 April 1960) is a former Kenyan athlete, who won the 3.000 m steeplechase at the 1984 Summer Olympics.

Korir was born in Nandi, Kenya. He rose into the international athletics scene in 1982, when he surprisingly won the gold medal at the Commonwealth Games. Korir improved his times during the 1983 season, but finished only seventh at the first World Championships. He continued to improve in 1984 and, after winning his semi-final at the 1984 Summer Olympics, established himself as a serious medal contender for the gold medal. In the Olympic final, Korir was always with the leaders, and when he started his sprint for home with just over half a lap remaining, the rest of the field were unable to match his speed.

Korir missed the 1985 season due to injury, and although he competed for several more years, he never again represented his country at a major international championships.

Running for the Washington State Cougars, he won the 1984 NCAA Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships title in the 5000 m, and the 1986 NCAA Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships title in the 3000 m steeplechase.

<doc id="1033865" wikidata="Q3454686" url="?curid=1033865" title="Reduction (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, reduction refers to the rewriting of an expression into a simpler form. For example, the process of rewriting a fraction into one with the smallest whole-number denominator possible (while keeping the numerator a whole number) is called &quot;reducing a fraction&quot;. Rewriting a radical (or &quot;root&quot;) expression with the smallest possible whole number under the radical symbol is called &quot;reducing a radical&quot;. Minimizing the number of radicals that appear underneath other radicals in an expression is called denesting radicals.

==Algebra==
In linear algebra, &quot;reduction&quot; refers to applying simple rules to a series of equations or matrices to change them into a simpler form. In the case of matrices, the process involves manipulating either the rows or the columns of the matrix and so is usually referred to as &quot;row-reduction&quot; or &quot;column-reduction&quot;, respectively. Often the aim of reduction is to transform a matrix into its &quot;row-reduced echelon form&quot; or &quot;row-echelon form&quot;; this is the goal of Gaussian elimination.

==Calculus==

In calculus, &quot;reduction&quot; refers to using the technique of integration by parts to evaluate integrals by reducing them to simpler forms.

==Static (Guyan) reduction==
In dynamic analysis, static reduction refers to reducing the number of degrees of freedom. Static reduction can also be used in finite element analysis to refer to simplification of a linear algebraic problem. Since a static reduction requires several inversion steps it is an expensive matrix operation and is prone to some error in the solution. Consider the following system of linear equations in an FEA problem:

:formula_1

where &quot;K&quot; and &quot;F&quot; are known and &quot;K&quot;, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;F&quot; are divided into submatrices as shown above. If &quot;F&quot;2 contains only zeros, and only &quot;x&quot;1 is desired, &quot;K&quot; can be reduced to yield the following system of equations

:formula_2

formula_3 is obtained by writing out the set of equations as follows:

Equation () can be solved for formula_4 (assuming invertibility of formula_5):

:formula_6

And substituting into () gives

:formula_7

Thus

:formula_8

In a similar fashion, any row or column &quot;i&quot; of &quot;F&quot; with a zero value may be eliminated if the corresponding value of &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; is not desired. A reduced &quot;K&quot; may be reduced again. As a note, since each reduction requires an inversion, and each inversion is an operation with computational cost &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;3), most large matrices are pre-processed to reduce calculation time.

==History==
In the 9th century, Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi&#x27;s &quot;Al-Jabr&quot; introduced the fundamental concepts of &quot;reduction&quot; and &quot;balancing&quot;, referring to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation and the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation. This is the operation which Al-Khwarizmi originally described as &quot;al-jabr&quot;. The name &quot;algebra&quot; comes from the &quot;al-jabr&quot; in the title of his book.

<doc id="1033871" wikidata="Q1272905" url="?curid=1033871" title="D'Arcy Wentworth">
<text>D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth (14 February 1762 â 7 July 1827) was an Irish-Australian surgeon and the first paying passenger to arrive in the new colony of New South Wales. He served under the first seven governors of the Colony, and from 1810 to 1821, he was &quot;great assistant&quot; to Governor Lachlan Macquarie. Wentworth led a campaign for the rights and recognition of emancipists and for trial by jury.

== Early life ==
D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth was born in Portadown, County Armagh, Ireland, the sixth child and fourth son of Martha and D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth. His family had left Yorkshire for safe haven in Ireland after the execution of Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, in 1641. In 1778, aged sixteen, D&#x27;Arcy was apprenticed to Alexander Patton, a surgeon-apothecary, in nearby Tandragee. In 1782, he joined the Irish Volunteers, one of the local regiments formed during the American Revolutionary War, to defend Ireland against invasion from France; his commission as a junior officer was signed by George III. In May 1785, having completed a seven-year apprenticeship, D&#x27;Arcy left Ireland. He was seeking an appointment with the East India Company, and as the training of Irish surgeons was not recognised in England, it was necessary to go to London to gain accreditation.

== Life in England ==
Wentworth sailed on the mailboat from Donaghadee to Portpatrick in Scotland. First he went to South Yorkshire, as the guest of his cousin, William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam, at &quot;Wentworth Woodhouse&quot;. It was the beginning of a lifelong friendship. Fitzwilliam gave D&#x27;Arcy encouragement and advice. He attended Whig party gatherings and race meetings at York, Doncaster and Wakefield with Fitzwilliam, who introduced him to the societies of York and London, their up and coming lawyers, young politicians and aspiring bureaucrats.

On 1 December 1785, Wentworth went before the Court of Examiners of the Company of Surgeons in London. He qualified as a &quot;Mate to Indiamen&quot;, eligible to work with the East India Company, once he had twelve months practical experience &quot;walking the wards&quot; in one of London&#x27;s large charity hospitals. Wentworth accepted the invitation of Percivall Pott, one of his examiners, to &quot;walk the wards&quot; of St Bartholomew&#x27;s, Smithfield under his direction. He attended lectures by other prominent physicians including John Hunter, and dissections held in the Company of Surgeons&#x27; anatomy theatre at the Old Bailey.

Wentworth waited in vain for a position to become available in the East India Company. Warren Hastings had brought peace to India, and the company had an oversupply of surgeons. Wentworth supported himself in London by mastering the art of card playing, gambling at card tables in several inns and coffee houses, but he found many of those who lost to him would simply refuse to pay.

Eventually, Wentworth pursued a number of prominent players who had defaulted on their debts. Chief Magistrate and novelist Henry Fielding described gambling as &quot;the School in which most Highwaymen of great Eminence have been bred.&quot; Wentworth was arraigned before the Courts four times for highway robbery, but never convicted. On each occasion his defaulter either failed to appear to prosecute him, found himself unable to positively identify D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth, or sought only to name and shame him.

In March 1787, Fitzwilliam&#x27;s patronage secured Wentworth a direction from the Home Office, to leave without delay for Portsmouth, where the First Fleet was making ready to sail to Botany Bay. He was to seek out John White, Principal Surgeon, on the &quot;Charlotte&quot;, who could advise him of any vacancies for assistant surgeons on the Fleet. D&#x27;Arcy learnt that to become a naval surgeon would require further accreditation from the Company of Surgeons. He returned to his studies, and on 5 July 1787, examined a second time by the Court of Examiners he qualified as an Assistant Surgeon, Second Mate, Third Rate.

== Arrival in the Colony of New South Wales ==
On 17 January 1790, Wentworth left England on the Second Fleet on board the &quot;Neptune&quot;, the most notorious of the convict transports. The neglect and ill treatment of her convicts resulted in the deaths of one hundred and forty-seven men and eleven women, over 30% of the convicts she transported. Wentworth was on board as a passenger; he had no influence, no position on the ship and no employment arranged in the Colony. He arrived in Sydney on 26 June 1790, and spent his first five weeks assisting the local surgeons to care for the newly arrived convicts.

The Colony was short of food, strict rationing had been in place for three months. Five weeks after the &quot;Neptune&quot; arrived, to avoid a worsening disaster, Governor Arthur Phillip sent nearly 200 convicts and their superintendents to Norfolk Island on the &quot;Surprize&quot;, en route to China. Wentworth went with them, &quot;to act as an assistant to the surgeon there, being reputed to have the necessary requisites for such a situation&quot;&quot;.&quot;

Wentworth disembarked at Norfolk Island on 16 August 1790. The Commandant, Lieut. Governor Philip Gidley King appointed him as an unpaid Assistant Surgeon. On the island, he became friends with Captain John Hunter, whose vessel, &quot;HMS Sirius&quot;, had been wrecked on a sunken reef off the island five months earlier. Hunter and most of his crew were stranded on Norfolk Island for nearly a year, awaiting a vessel to return them to Sydney.

In December 1791, King appointed Wentworth to a second position on Norfolk Island, Superintendent of Convicts, responsible for overseeing up to 150 convict labourers on building projects, land clearing and farm work. In June 1793, Earl Fitzwilliam offered him a lifeline; he appointed his London lawyer, Charles Cookney, Wentworth&#x27;s agent, making it possible for him to become an early trader in the Colony.

== Land grants and later subdivisions ==
By the time of his death in 1827, D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth had acquired around 22,000 acres of land.

The estate&quot; Darcyville &quot;was later subdivided as the â&quot;Toongabbee Subdivisionâ&quot;. Section 2 of this subdivision includes area along Wentworth Avenue to the North of the Railway line was made available for sale in 1886. 

== Street names and suburbs ==

Wentworth Avenue is named in honour of DâArcy Wentworth and his family who held land the parcel of land known as &quot;Darcyville&quot; in the area. The avenue is parallel to the railway line and extends from Bridge Road, Westmead, New South Wales to Toongabbie railway station, passing through the suburbs of Wentworthville, New South Wales and Pendle Hill, New South Wales .

== Public life ==
During his thirty-seven years in New South Wales, D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth served under the first seven governors of the Colony.

The second governor, Captain John Hunter, gave Wentworth permission to leave Norfolk Island, and he arrived back in Sydney on 5 March 1796. He had worked without a break for six years on the island. He received Â£40 a year as Superintendent of Convicts, but had not been paid for his work as Assistant Surgeon. His applications for leave and requests for his position to be regularised had been ignored. In London, Earl Fitzwilliam pursued the matter of payment for his service as Assistant Surgeon, and in 1798, as a result of his efforts, Wentworth was paid arrears of Â£160, for six years work.

Soon after Wentworth&#x27;s return, Hunter appointed him to Sydney Cove Hospital as an Assistant Surgeon, replacing Samuel Leeds, who had disqualified himself though drunkenness. In Sydney, Hunter allowed several people, including Wentworth, to act as traders, in an attempt to break the power of the Rum Corps officers through competition, and to lower the price of commodities. On 11 May 1799, he appointed Wentworth Assistant Surgeon at Parramatta, in charge of the hospital there, replacing James Mileham, who was later court martialled for refusing to attend the settlers, free people, and others.

Wentworth took up duty at Parramatta Hospital, &quot;two long sheds, built in the form of a tent, and thatched... capable of holding two hundred patients.&quot; &quot;It was large and clean with a large vegetable garden attached to it.&quot; A week later, on 16 May 1799, Hunter granted him a fourteen year lease over six acres and twenty roods at Parramatta, on a knoll overlooking the river. Wentworth planted a dozen young Norfolk Island pines along the ridge line, and built a comfortable two storey house, that he named &quot;Wentworth Woodhouse&quot;. John Price, surgeon on the &quot;Minerva&quot;, visited him there, he described it as &quot;charmingly situated and, as John Milton says, &#x27;Bosom&#x27;d high in tufted trees&#x27;.&quot;

=== Governor Philip Gidley King, RN, 28 September 1800 to 12 August 1806 ===
Wentworth had been friendly with Philip Gidley King on Norfolk Island. On 15 April 1800, King returned to Sydney from London with a dormant commission, to act as governor in the case of the death or during the absence of Captain John Hunter. During Hunter&#x27;s final five months in the Colony, Wentworth provided friendship, assistance and undivided loyalty. His support rankled King. Wentworth had been friendly with Philip Gidley King on Norfolk Island, but when King took over as governor, he curtailed Wentworth&#x27;s trading, impounded his trading stock and sent him back to Norfolk Island. John Grant, an emancipist, commented, &quot;Governor King hates Hunter&#x27;s friends.&quot;

=== Captain William Bligh, RN, 13 August 1806 to 26 January 1808 ===
Captain William Bligh, who succeeded King, had D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth court martialled for disrespect, the result of conflicting instructions given by the Governor. As a consequence of Bligh&#x27;s belligerence, Wentworth supported Major George Johnston and John Macarthur in the Rum Rebellion on 26 January 1808, that overthrew the Governor and placed him under house arrest.

=== Major-General Lachlan Macquarie, CB, 1 January 1810 to 1 December 1821 ===
Lachlan Macquarie came ashore in Sydney on 1 January 1810. On 7 January he issued a Government and General Order declaring all official appointments made since Bligh&#x27;s arrest null and void. On 20 February 1810, he ordered that D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth remain as Principal Surgeon, pending instructions from London. Macquarie recommended his appointment in his first despatch.

Under Governor Macquarie, D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth found great recognition. From the outset Macquarie respected his judgement, he placed new and heavy responsibilities on his shoulders, and Wentworth responded with absolute loyalty and diligence. Macquarie found him &quot;indefagitable in his Exertions and Assiduity&quot;. The two men, both over six feet tall, were the same age, forty-seven, born a fortnight apart in 1762. They shared their generation&#x27;s belief in the principles of the Enlightenment. They recognized that reason, science, and an exchange of ideas, knowledge and experience were necessary to progress the Colony and to achieve Macquarie&#x27;s vision for a more harmonious and inclusive society.

On 31 March 1810, Macquarie appointed Wentworth Treasurer of the Colonial Police Fund, the consolidated revenue fund of the Colony. He was effectively the Treasurer of the Colony, responsible for receiving revenue raised from government activities, including three-quarters of all customs duties, fees collected at the port and town of Sydney, licensing fees from markets, inns, hotels and breweries, and the licences &quot;recently issued to publicans for vending spirituous liquors&quot;.

On 7 April 1810, Macquarie made Wentworth a Commissioner of the new turnpike road to be built from Sydney to Parramatta and the Hawkesbury. On 17 May 1810, the Governor appointed Wentworth one of two Justices of the Peace. On 11 August 1810, D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth was made a member of the Court of Civil Jurisdiction.

On 6 October 1810, Macquarie announced Sydney was to have a single effective police force. He appointed D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth Chief Magistrate and Superintendent of Police.

In 1814, Macquarie set up the &quot;Native Institute for the Education of Indigenous Children&quot;, and appointed D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth to the committee of management. Wentworth had the respect and trust of the Aboriginal people in Sydney, they could take their grievances to him as Police Magistrate and could look to him for support and redress.

==== The Rum Hospital ====
One of Wentworth&#x27;s achievements was the construction of new hospital for Sydney. In 1806, Governor Bligh reported the wooden hospital at Dawes Point, that arrived on the Second Fleet, was &quot;rotten and decayed, not worth rep&#x27;g&quot;, and the other hospitals were in &quot;a ruinous state&quot;.
Macquarie confirmed this in his first despatch to London: &quot;there will be an absolute necessity for building a new general hospital as soon as possible&quot;. It was necessary to provide &quot;a proper place of reception, and more secure detention of the sick, and of moving it to a more airy and retired situation in the town&quot;. Without waiting for a reply, within two months the Governor had called for tenders.

Macquarie signed the contract for construction of a new hospital on 6 November 1810, with a consortium of businessmen â Garnham Blaxcell and Alexander Riley, later joined by D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth. They would receive convict labour and a monopoly on rum imports, from which they expected to recoup the cost of the building and gain considerable profits. The contract allowed them an exclusive right to import 45,000 (later increased to 60,000) gallons of rum to sell, with the excise collected, paid into the Colonial Fund. Their projected profit on the building of the hospital did not eventuate, as a result of many unforeseen problems and the cost of the remedial work required. On its completion in 1816, convict patients were transferred to the new hospital, known as the &quot;Rum Hospital&quot;.

Wentworth made lifelong friends among his fellow surgeons and colleagues in the Colony, but he remained detached from its social castes and allegiances. Historian James Auchmuty commented that &quot;despite his general popularity, comparative wealth and powerful connexions at home, Wentworth mixed little in non-official social life,&quot; observing, &quot;the liberal views imbibed in the Ireland of his youth,&quot; which had &quot;resulted in more than usual sympathy with the convict population,&quot; and &quot;the circumstances of his personal life in the Colony prevented him from fully sharing in the social round.&quot;

==== Bank of New South Wales ====
The Colony of New South Wales was established without any cash. Coinage brought to the Colony leaked out rapidly, mainly on ships that called with necessities, clothes, food, and knick knacks. As a result there was insufficient coinage to permit normal business transactions, forcing the population to rely on local promissary notes and rum.

On 30 April 1810, Macquarie wrote to Lord Castlereagh:
there is one circumstance to which I beg your Lordship&#x27;s most serious attention, as on it seems to hinge much of the future prosperity of this colony. In consequence of there being neither gold nor silver coins of any denomination, nor any legal currency, as a substitute for specie in the colony, the people have been in some degree forced on the expedient of issuing and receiving notes of hand to supply the place of real money, and this petty banking has thrown open a door to frauds and impositions of a most grievous nature to the country at largeâ¦At present the agricultural and commercial pursuits of the territory are very much impeded and obstructed by the want of some adequately secured circulating medium.

Under D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth, the Colonial Fund had a quasi-bank role, printing and issuing bank notes to people who had claims on the Fund. Wentworth had the &quot;Sydney Gazette&quot; print books of notes, labelled Police Fund, with four different Sterling values: two shillings and sixpence, five shillings, ten shillings and one pound. To protect against forgery, he had a Latin quotation from Cicero with a decorative border printed on the reverse side, and he signed each note. They circulated throughout the Colony, helping to overcome the shortage of small change.

The idea of establishing a bank was raised in March 1810, but it wasn&#x27;t until November 1816 that a meeting was held to discuss the proposal. In February 1817, the Bank of New South Wales was established; Macquarie gave it a Charter as a joint stock company, providing its directors with limited liability. The first directors were: D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth, John Harris, Robert Jenkins, Thomas Wylde, Alexander Riley, William Redfern and John Thomas Campbell. Campbell, Macquarie&#x27;s secretary, was elected the bank&#x27;s first president; D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth was elected president in 1825. The new bank facilitated financial transactions and encouraged commerce; it helped bring to an end the Colony&#x27;s dependence on rum as money, and the need for dubious promissary notes. The bank received deposits from the Colonial Fund, previously held by Wentworth.

==== Macquarie and the Emancipists ====
In his third despatch to London, written on Easter Monday 1810, Macquarie reported on what he saw was the Colony&#x27;s most pressing problem:&quot;I was very much surprised and Concerned, on my Arrival here, at the extraordinary and illiberal Policy I found had been adopted by all the Persons who had preceded me in Office, respecting those Men who had been originally sent out to this Country as Convicts, but who, by long Habits of Industry and total Reformation of Manners, had not only become respectable, but by Many Degrees the most Useful Members of the Community. Those persons have never been Countenanced or received into Society.&quot;

&quot;I have nevertheless, taken upon my self to adopt a new Line of Conduct, Conceiving that Emancipation, when united with Rectitude and long-tried good Conduct, should lead a Man back to that Rank in Society which he had forfeited, and do away, in as far as the Case will admit, All Retrospect of former bad Conduct. This appears to me to be the greatest inducement that Can be held out towards the Reformation of Manners of the establishment, and I think it is Consistent with the gracious and humane Intentions of His Majesty and His Ministers.&quot;

Macquarie welcomed the emancipists into society, he appointed them to positions in the public sector, reversing the previous policy towards former convicts. Most likely D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth had advocated on their behalf, for Macquarie had assumed he was an emancipist. He listed for Castlereagh the men who gave the most liberal assistance to government and conducted themselves with the greatest propriety, whom he had: &quot;admitted to my table&quot;,&quot;namely Mr D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth, principal Surgeon; Mr William Redfern, Assistant Surgeon; Mr Andrew Thompson, an opulent Farmer and Proprietor of Land; and Mr Simeon Lord, an opulent Merchant.&quot;,
On 26 July 1811, Lord Liverpool acknowledged the principles Macquarie had outlined.

The Governor resolutely pursued his new Line of Conduct, championing emancipists of good conduct, raising them into key positions of authority and to a new rank in society. His approach startled and dismayed the Exclusives and wealthier free settlers, and met immediate opposition within the barracks, from the officers of the 73rd Regiment, sent to the Colony to replace the discredited Rum Corps. The most vigorous opponents of the Governor&#x27;s new inclusiveness were the clergy and judiciary. They worked to frustrate and denigrate his progress, and complained noisily to London. They petitioned Members of Parliament, the Colonial Office and influential spokesmen within their own hierarchies, belaboring them with an increasing stream of grievances and gossip. D&#x27;Arcy, working close to Macquarie, became an easy target for much of the venom directed towards the Governor.

In London, Opposition support for their campaign spurred the Secretary of State, Earl Bathurst, to propose in April 1817: &quot;the appointment of commissioners who shall forthwith proceed to the settlement with full powers to investigate all the complaints which have been made, both with respect to the treatment of convicts, and the general administration of the government.&quot;

==== John Thomas Bigge &amp; his Report ====
Nearly two years later, on 19 January 1819, John Thomas Bigge was appointed Commissioner of Inquiry, with a private instruction from Earl Bathurst to end Macquarie&#x27;s dream of an inclusive society in the Colony.

Bigge did not attack Macquarie directly in his report, tabled in Parliament in 1822 and 1823, though he maligned him to the authorities in London. In his attempt to discredit Macquarie, Bigge&#x27;s report took aim at those closest to the Governor. He attacked D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth in particular, personally and professionally, and others who supported Macquarie&#x27;s policy of a more inclusive society, including William Redfern and J.T. Campbell, the Governor&#x27;s Secretary.

In May 1818, D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth had submitted his resignation as Principal Surgeon. Macquarie recommended that William Redfern, his Assistant Surgeon, an emancipist, replace him. Bigge opposed his appointment. On 23 October 1819, three weeks after James Bowman, Wentworth&#x27;s replacement, arrived with Commissioner Bigge, he retired as Principal Surgeon. He had served 29 years as a surgeon in New South Wales, ten of those as Principal Surgeon. 

In March 1820, Wentworth resigned as Superintendent of Police, and six months later, he resigned as Treasurer of the Police Fund. A few months later, on 26 March 1821, Wentworth&#x27;s replacement William Minchin died. Macquarie persuaded him to return as Superintendent of Police and Treasurer of the Colonial Revenue, writing to Earl Bathurst, &quot;there was no-one else in the Colony capable of performing the duties&quot;. D&#x27;Arcy agreed to his request.

On 31 January 1822, his sixtieth birthday, Macquarie invited D&#x27;Arcy and other close friends to celebrate. At day break on 12 February 1822, with his wife Elizabeth and son Lachlan, he passed through an &quot;immense concourse&quot; to the harbour, filled with &quot;a great gathering of launches, barges, cutters, pinnaces and wherries&quot;, and went aboard the &quot;Surry&quot;, for the voyage home.

=== Major-General Sir Thomas Brisbane, CB, 1 December 1821 to 1 December 1825 ===
D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth continued to serve and advise Macquarie&#x27;s successor, Governor Thomas Brisbane. He remained Treasurer of the Colonial Revenue until the arrival of his replacement, William Balcombe, in April 1824. Brisbane recommended him as chairman of the Court of Quarter Sessions, and he was elected by his brother magistrates in November 1824, but he declined, reluctant to implement the more punitive regime recommended by Bigge, and to be responsible for ensuring his fellow magistrates did likewise. He served as Superintendent of Police until Captain Francis Rossi arrived to replace him on 19 May 1825, when he retired altogether from public life. The Bench of Magistrates publicly thanked him on his retirement, stating they &quot;echoed the Public voice&quot;, and were &quot;indebted to his superior information in dispensing Justice&quot;.

As a public official, Wentworth&#x27;s capacity to advocate openly for reform had been constrained. Free of the obligations of public office, he was free to give his full support to the emancipist cause, to enter political debate, and to work with his son William Charles, as an advocate for an independent constitution for the Colony. In October he made a formal request to Brisbane, with two Parramatta magistrates, for &quot;respectable&quot; emancipists to be added to the lists of jurors. Brisbane sent their petition to Earl Bathurst for his attention.

In May 1825, Governor Brisbane was recalled. On 26 October 1825, D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth presented an Address of Farewell to him on behalf of the Emancipists. He arranged the Official Farewell Dinner for the Governor, with one hundred guests, at the Woolpack Inn in Parramatta on 7 November 1825. D&#x27;Arcy sat beside the Governor at the dinner, but he was ill and he retired early.

His son William proposed the toasts, to the King, to Governor Thomas Brisbane, to the prosperity of Australia and to the memory of Governor Phillip. In solemn silence they toasted the memory of Governor Macquarie. Then they charged their glasses and drank to the health of D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth. William returned thanks on his behalf, acknowledging he was proud to be the son of such a worthy man, proud that the community possessed this &quot;upright and zealous friend of liberty&quot;.

At his farewell dinner, Governor Brisbane, in defiance of the Exclusives and the Bigge Report, recognised the importance and significance of the Emancipists, and he undertook to champion their cause with the British Government.

=== Lieut. General Sir Ralph Darling, GCH, 19 December 1825 to 21 October 1831 ===
Governor Ralph Darling arrived in Sydney on 17 December 1825, to actively implement the socially destructive policies recommended in the Bigge Report. Darling&#x27;s policies made life more punitive for the convicts and more onerous for the soldiers. Emancipists and convicts were now excluded from Government employment. Freed convicts who had been given pardons by the Crown were now dealt with by the courts as convicts without status; emancipists and descendants of convicts were excluded from Government House.

Under Darling, no longer an officer of the Crown, D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth was free to promote the cause of the Emancipists and trial by jury, and he became their figure head and leader. The press came under pressure for its criticism of the Governor and government policies. D&#x27;Arcy initially led the protagonists supporting freedom of the press, a fully elected representative government for the Colony, and no taxation without representation. Amongst the leading agitators were &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper and its proprietors: two barristers, Robert Wardell and William Charles Wentworth, D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth&#x27;s son. Following Darling&#x27;s persecution of two soldiers, Sudds and Thompson in November 1826, that resulted in the death of Sudds, &quot;The Australian&quot; pressed for the recall of Governor Darling. William Wentworth became the voice for representative government for the Colony and for Governor Darling&#x27;s recall.

== Private life ==

On board the convict transport &quot;Neptune&quot; Wentworth entered a relationship with a convict girl, Catherine Crowley. She remained his partner in the Colony until her death at Parramatta in January 1800. Their son William Charles Wentworth was born at sea on the &quot;Surprize&quot;, standing off Norfolk Island in a violent storm on 13 August 1790; a daughter, Martha, died at four months, during an outbreak of fever carried by the Third Fleet; two more sons followed: Dorset (D&#x27;Arcy) born in 1793, and Matthew (John) in 1795.

After Catherine&#x27;s death, D&#x27;Arcy and his sons moved to Sydney; in 1801, two convicts were assigned to him; one, Catherine Melling, lived in and cared for his three sons, aged ten, seven and six. A year later, after she left to be married, Maria Ainsley, an emancipist and widow, took her place and brought her own young son to live with them. Maria became a mother figure to D&#x27;Arcy&#x27;s three sons, and they loved her.
In 1807, Fitzwilliam, appalled by reports of Bligh&#x27;s behaviour towards D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth, applied to Viscount Castlereagh, Secretary of State for the Colonies, for him to be given leave of absence to return to London. Fitzwilliam wrote again the following year, to inform Castlereagh that Wentworth had been: &quot;suspended from the duties of his office &amp; consequently from its emoluments, this devoted man is retained a prisoner in the Colony.&quot;

Bligh named D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth as one of the twelve ringleaders of the Rum Rebellion, declaring them to be in a state of mutiny and rebellion He wanted them arrested and charged with treason. He forbad them leaving the Colony under any circumstances, proclaiming that ships&#x27; masters would take them, at their peril.

In late July 1808, Wentworth finally received permission from Lord Castlereagh to leave the Colony, allowing him to return to England, but it had come too late. Bligh was under house arrest in Government House, his rage undiminished, and plans were under way for him to return to England. All those involved in the Rum Rebellion anticipated harsh repercussions. Wentworth knew Bligh&#x27;s anger would be directed at him; he believed he would be arrested and charged with treason when he arrived in England. He expected no leniency. He resolved to remain in the Colony and see out the storm from a safe distance. He replied, &quot;I am under the painful necessity of declining to avail myself of the leave granted me, until the result be known.&quot;

One evening in 1810, a young woman, Ann Lawes, came to D&#x27;Arcy&#x27;s house in Sydney seeking medical attention. She was weeping, she had been cruelly beaten by her husband and was afraid to return home, even to her own child. D&#x27;Arcy took pity on her, he gave her shelter for the night and next morning returned her to the house of her employer, William Gore, the Provost Marshall. Ann Lawes, a free woman, had come to the Colony in 1806 with the Gore family, as nanny and governess to his four children. They travelled with Governor Bligh on the Lady Sinclair.

After the Rum Rebellion on 26 January 1806, Gore was arrested and imprisoned; his wife, Ann and the children were evicted and on 29 February his effects sold at auction. During this period of uncertainty Ann Lawes had married James Macneal.

When Wentworth returned Ann to the Gore&#x27;s house, he asked about her situation. Gore, reinstated by Macquarie, told him Ann&#x27;s husband was violent and had threatened to murder her. D&#x27;Arcy offered her temporary shelter and she remained with him; they had eight children, the last born after his father&#x27;s death: George Wentworth (1810â1851), Martha Wentworth (1813â1847), Sophia Wentworth (1816â1878), Robert Charles Wentworth (1818), Charles John Wentworth (1819â1854), Mary-Ann Wentworth (1820â1870), Katherine Wentworth (1825â1898), D&#x27;Arcy Charles Wentworth (1828â1866).

Wentworth&#x27;s hopes for a quiet retirement were disrupted by the arrival of Commissioner Bigge, who asserted his authority over the Governor, attacking him and his administration. Wentworth was called to attend Macquarie, as stress and despair affected his health.

In 1821, Wentworth leased &quot;Wentworth Woodhouse&quot; in Parramatta and moved to his farm &quot;Home Bush&quot;. By 1823, he had acquired 17,000 acres of land, using it to produce meat for the Colony as he had done on Norfolk Island. In the early 1800s, he bought a prize stallion named Hector, imported from India, from Arthur Wellesley, later Duke of Wellington. When Hector arrived, there were fewer than three hundred horses in the Colony, by 1821, there were more than four thousand.

With his prize sire, Wentworth bred carriage horses and racehorses, Hector was the great foundation sire of Australian Cavalry horses known as Walers, from New South Wales. The first exports of Walers, as light cavalry horses, began in 1816. In the First World War around one hundred and sixty thousand Walers were sent overseas; between 1861 and 1931 almost half a million were exported.

== Death ==
In the winter of 1827, a severe strain of influenza swept through the Colony. On Saturday, 7 July 1827, a cold winter morning, D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth died of pneumonia at &quot;Home Bush&quot;.

On Monday 9 July, despite dreadful weather and the risk of influenza, a funeral procession more than a mile long, with forty carriages and more than fifty men on horseback, accompanied his hearse on its journey to Parramatta. D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth was buried there, in St John&#x27;s cemetery. The inscription on his tomb reads: &quot;an honest man, the noblest work of God&quot;. He left two mature sons, William Charles and D&#x27;Arcy, children of Catherine Crowley, and seven children with Mary Ann Lawes, three sons and four daughters; their fourth son was born in 1828. Wentworth named her in his will as: &quot;my dear friend Ann Lawes the mother of seven of my children&quot;. After his funeral the mourners gathered at Hannah Walker&#x27;s &quot;Red Cow Inn&quot; at Parramatta, to salute his life and drink a toast to his memory.

&quot;The Monitor&quot; described D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth as &quot;a lover of liberty on whom the people could rely, the natural protector of the people&#x27;s rights. He was a lover of freedom; a constant and steady friend to the people; a kind and liberal master; a just and humane magistrate; a steady friend&quot;.

&quot;The Australian&quot; noted his reputation as a doctor and as a magistrate: &quot;As a medical practitioner, Mr Wentworth was distinguished for his tenderness with which he treated his patients of every degree, and that class of unfortunate persons whom the charge of General Hospital placed so extensively under his care. He was peculiarly skilful in treating the diseases of childrenâ¦ As an able, upright and impartial Magistrate, Mr Wentworth&#x27;s merits were well remembered by all classes of the community&quot;. 

The &quot;Sydney Gazette&quot; acknowledged Wentworth had &quot;studiously devoted the best part of his eventful life to the service of its public, he was loyal from principle, and indefatigable in his public career; a Patriot in whom were blended the political virtues of loyalty and independence&quot;.

== Recognition and legacy ==
The Sydney suburbs of Wentworthville and Wentworth Point, the New South Wales town, Wentworth, the federal electorate of Wentworth, more than sixty avenues, drives, places, roads, streets and ways in Sydney, and more than twenty in both Melbourne and Brisbane, are named Wentworth, in honour of D&#x27;Arcy and his son, William Charles. Darcy Street (formerly D&#x27;Arcy Street), within Parramatta, was named for D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth. Woodhouse Lane, also within Parramatta, was named after the two storey house, &quot;Wentworth Woodhouse&quot;, he built nearby. In 1824, explorer Hamilton Hume named an imposing peak in the Victorian Central Highlands, Mount Wentworth, after D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth. In 1836, Sir Thomas Mitchell noting that Port Philip was visible from the summit, renamed it &quot;Mount Macedon&quot;.

<doc id="1033877" wikidata="Q1231787" url="?curid=1033877" title="Dixon's factorization method">
<text>In number theory, Dixon&#x27;s factorization method (also Dixon&#x27;s random squares method or Dixon&#x27;s algorithm) is a general-purpose integer factorization algorithm; it is the prototypical factor base method. Unlike for other factor base methods, its run-time bound comes with a rigorous proof that does not rely on conjectures about the smoothness properties of the values taken by a polynomial.

The algorithm was designed by John D. Dixon, a mathematician at Carleton University, and was published in 1981.

==Basic idea==
Dixon&#x27;s method is based on finding a congruence of squares modulo the integer N which is intended to factor. Fermat&#x27;s factorization method finds such a congruence by selecting random or pseudo-random &quot;x&quot; values and hoping that the integer &quot;x&quot;2Â modÂ N is a perfect square (in the integers):

:formula_1

For example, if , (by starting at 292, the first number greater than and counting up) the is 256, the square of 16. So . Computing the greatest common divisor of and &quot;N&quot; using Euclid&#x27;s algorithm gives 163, which is a factor of &quot;N&quot;.

In practice, selecting random &quot;x&quot; values will take an impractically long time to find a congruence of squares, since there are only squares less than &quot;N&quot;.

Dixon&#x27;s method replaces the condition &quot;is the square of an integer&quot; with the much weaker one &quot;has only small prime factors&quot;; for example, there are 292 squares smaller than 84923; 662 numbers smaller than 84923 whose prime factors are only 2,3,5 or 7; and 4767 whose prime factors are all less than 30. (Such numbers are called &quot;B-smooth&quot; with respect to some bound &quot;B&quot;.)

If there are many numbers formula_2 whose squares can be factorized as formula_3 for a fixed set formula_4 of small primes, linear algebra modulo 2 on the matrix formula_5 will give a subset of the formula_6 whose squares combine to a product of small primes to an even power â that is, a subset of the formula_6 whose squares multiply to the square of a (hopefully different) number mod N.

==Method==
Suppose the composite number &quot;N&quot; is being factored. Bound &quot;B&quot; is chosen, and the &quot;factor base&quot; is identified (which is called &quot;P&quot;), the set of all primes less than or equal to &quot;B&quot;. Next, positive integers &quot;z&quot; are sought such that &quot;z&quot;2Â modÂ &quot;N&quot; is &quot;B&quot;-smooth. Therefore we can write, for suitable exponents &quot;ai&quot;,

: formula_8

When enough of these relations have been generated (it is generally sufficient that the number of relations be a few more than the size of &quot;P&quot;), the methods of linear algebra, such as Gaussian elimination, can be used to multiply together these various relations in such a way that the exponents of the primes on the right-hand side are all even:

: formula_9

This yields a congruence of squares of the form which can be turned into a factorization of &quot;N&quot;, This factorization might turn out to be trivial (i.e. ), which can only happen if in which case another try must be made with a different combination of relations; but if a nontrivial pair of factors of &quot;N&quot; is reached, the algorithm terminates.

==Pseudocode==
This section is taken directly from Dixon(1981).

Dixon&#x27;s Algorithm

&quot;Initialization.&quot; Let &quot;L&quot; be a list of integers in the range [1, &quot;n&quot;], and let &quot;P&quot; = {&quot;p&quot;â, ..., &quot;p&quot;â} be the list of the &quot;h&quot; primes â¤ &quot;v&quot;. Let &quot;B&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; be initially empty lists (&quot;Z&quot; will be indexed by &quot;B&quot;).

Step 1. If &quot;L&quot; is empty, exit (algorithm unsuccessful). Otherwise, take the first term &quot;z&quot; from &quot;L&quot;, remove it from &quot;L&quot;, and proceed to Step 2.

Step 2. Compute &quot;w&quot; as the least positive remainder of &quot;zÂ² mod n&quot;. Factor &quot;w&quot; as:

formula_10

where &quot;w&quot;â² has no factor in &quot;P&quot;. If &quot;w&quot;â² = 1, proceed to Step 3; otherwise, return to Step 1.

Step 3. Let &quot;a&quot; â (&quot;a&quot;â, ..., &quot;a&quot;â). Add &quot;a&quot; to &quot;B&quot; and &quot;z&quot; to &quot;Z&quot;. If &quot;B&quot; has at most &quot;h&quot; elements, return to Step 1; otherwise, proceed to Step 4.

Step 4. Find the first vector &quot;c&quot; in &quot;B&quot; that is linearly dependent (mod 2) on earlier vectors in &quot;B&quot;. Remove &quot;c&quot; from &quot;B&quot; and formula_11 from &quot;Z&quot;. Compute coefficients formula_12 such that:

formula_13

Define:

formula_14

Proceed to Step 5.

Step 5. Compute:

formula_15

so that:

formula_16

If formula_17 or formula_18, return to Step 1. Otherwise, return:

formula_19

which provides a nontrivial factor of &quot;n&quot;, and terminate successfully.

== Step-by-step example : factorizing ( n = 84923) using Dixonâs Algorithm ==
This example is lifted directly from the LeetArxiv substack. Credit is given to the original author.
* Initialization:
** Define a list of numbers &quot;L&quot;, ranging from 1 to 84923: 
::: formula_20
:* Define a value &quot;v&quot;, which is the smoothness factor: 
::: formula_21
:* Define a list &quot;P&quot; containing all the prime numbers less than or equal to &quot;v&quot;: 
::: formula_22
:* Define &quot;B&quot; and &quot;Z&quot;, two empty lists. &quot;B&quot; is a list of powers, while &quot;Z&quot; is a list of accepted integers:
::: formula_23
::: formula_24
* Step 1: Iterating formula_25 values 
** Write a for loop that indexes the list formula_26. Each element in formula_26 is indexed as formula_25. The for loop exits at the end of the list. 
int n = 84923;
for(int i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++)
 int z = i;

* Step 2: Computing formula_29 and v-smooth Prime Factorization 
** To proceed, compute formula_30 for each &quot;z&quot;, then express the result as a prime factorization.
:: formula_31
:: formula_32
:: formula_33
::formula_32
::formula_35
::formula_36

::This step continues for all values of &quot;z&quot; in the range.

* Step 3: If formula_30 is &quot;7-smooth&quot;, then append its powers to list formula_38 and append formula_25 to list formula_40.
::formula_41
::formula_42

* Step 4: This step is split into two parts.
:: Part 1: Find formula_38 modulo 2.
::formula_44

:: Part 2: Check if any row combinations of formula_38 sum to even numbers

:::For example, summing Row formula_46 and Row formula_47 gives us a vector of even numbers.

:::formula_48 and formula_49

:::then 
:::formula_50 
:::formula_51.
* Step 5 : This step is split into four parts.
** Part 1. (Finding x): Multiply the corresponding formula_25 values for the rows found in Step 4. Then find the square root. This gives us formula_53. 
*** For Row 2, we had formula_54. 
*** For Row 3, we had formula_55. 
*** Thus, we find formula_53 :

::::formula_57

:* Part 2. (Finding y): Multiply the corresponding smooth factorizations for the rows found in Step 4. Then find the square root. This gives us formula_58. 
:::formula_59

:* Part 3. (Find x + y and x - y) where &quot;x = 20712&quot; and &quot;y = 16800&quot;.
::: formula_60
::: formula_61

:* Part 4. Compute GCD(x+y, n) and GCD(x-y, n), where &quot;n = 84923&quot;, &quot;x+y = 292281&quot; and &quot;x-y = 258681&quot;
:::formula_62

Quick check shows formula_63.

==Optimizations==
The quadratic sieve is an optimization of Dixon&#x27;s method. It selects values of &quot;x&quot; close to the square root of such that &quot;x2&quot; modulo &quot;N&quot; is small, thereby largely increasing the chance of obtaining a smooth number.

Other ways to optimize Dixon&#x27;s method include using a better algorithm to solve the matrix equation, taking advantage of the sparsity of the matrix: a number &quot;z&quot; cannot have more than formula_64 factors, so each row of the matrix is almost all zeros. In practice, the block Lanczos algorithm is often used. Also, the size of the factor base must be chosen carefully: if it is too small, it will be difficult to find numbers that factorize completely over it, and if it is too large, more relations will have to be collected.

A more sophisticated analysis, using the approximation that a number has all its prime factors less than formula_65 with probability about formula_66 (an approximation to the Dickmanâde Bruijn function), indicates that choosing too small a factor base is much worse than too large, and that the ideal factor base size is some power of formula_67.

The optimal complexity of Dixon&#x27;s method is 
:formula_68
in big-O notation, or
:formula_69
in L-notation.

<text>For the past three millennia, there have been attempts to determine the link between damage to specific areas of the brain and behavioural differences. However, the first systematic neuropsychological assessment and a battery of the behavioural tasks to investigate specific aspects of behavioural regulation was developed by Alexander Luria in 1942-1948. Luria was working with big samples of brain-injured Russian soldiers during and after the second World War. Among many insights from Luria&#x27;s rehabilitation practice and observations, was the fundamental discovery of the involvement of frontal lobes of the cortex in plasticity, initiation, planning and organization of behaviour. His Go/no-go task, which was one of the tasks screening for the frontal lobe damage, &quot;count by 7&quot;, hands-clutching, clock-drawing task, drawing of repeatitive patterns, word associations and categories recall and others became standard components of neuropsychological assessment and mental status screening. Considering the originality and multiplicity of neuropsychological components offered by Alexander Luria, he is recognized as a father of neuropsychological assessment.
Alexander Luria&#x27;s neuropsychological battery was adapted in the United States in the form of Luria-Nebraska neuropsychological battery in 1970s. Then the tasks used in this battery were borrowed in more modern neuropsychological batteries and in the Miniâmental state examination test for screening of demenia.
==History==
Neuropsychological assessment was traditionally carried out to assess the extent of impairment to a particular skill and to attempt to determine the area of the brain which may have been damaged following brain injury or neurological illness. With the advent of neuroimaging techniques, location of space-occupying lesions can now be more accurately determined through this method, so the focus has now moved on to the assessment of cognition and behaviour, including examining the effects of any brain injury or neuropathological process that a person may have experienced.

A core part of neuropsychological assessment is the administration of neuropsychological tests for the formal assessment of cognitive function, though neuropsychological testing is more than the administration and scoring of tests and screening tools. It is essential that neuropsychological assessment also include an evaluation of the person&#x27;s mental status. This is especially true in assessment of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and other forms of dementia. Aspects of cognitive functioning that are assessed typically include orientation, new-learning/memory, intelligence, language, visuoperception, and executive function. However, clinical neuropsychological assessment is more than this and also focuses on a person&#x27;s psychological, personal, interpersonal and wider contextual circumstances.

Assessment may be carried out for a variety of reasons, such as:
* Clinical evaluation, to understand the pattern of cognitive strengths as well as any difficulties a person may have, and to aid decision making for use in a medical or rehabilitation environment.
* Scientific investigation, to examine a hypothesis about the structure and function of cognition to be tested, or to provide information that allows experimental testing to be seen in context of a wider cognitive profile.
* Medico-legal assessment, to be used in a court of law as evidence in a legal claim or criminal investigation.

Miller outlined three broad goals of neuropsychological assessment. Firstly, diagnosis, to determine the nature of the underlying problem. Secondly, to understand the nature of any brain injury or resulting cognitive problem (see neurocognitive deficit) and its impact on the individual, as a means of devising a rehabilitation programme or offering advice as to an individual&#x27;s ability to carry out certain tasks (for example, fitness to drive, or returning to work). And lastly, assessments may be undertaken to measure change in functioning over time, such as to determine the consequences of a surgical procedure or the impact of a rehabilitation programme over time.

== Diagnosis of a neuropsychological disorder ==
Certain types of damage to the brain will cause behavioral and cognitive difficulties. Psychologists can start screening for these problems by using either one of the following techniques or all of these combined:

=== History taking ===

This includes gathering medical history of the patient and their family, presence or absence of developmental milestones, psychosocial history, and character, severity, and progress of any history of complaints. The psychologist can then gauge how to treat the patient and determine if there are any historical determinants for his or her behavior.

=== Interviewing ===

Psychologists use structured interviews in order to determine what kind of neurological problem the patient might be experiencing. There are a number of specific interviews, including the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, Neuropsychological Impairment Scale, Patient&#x27;s Assessment of Own Functioning, and Structured Interview for the Diagnosis of Dementia.
=== Test-taking ===

Scores on standardized tests of adequate predictive validity predictor well current and/or future problems. Standardized tests allow psychologists to compare a person&#x27;s results with other people&#x27;s because it has the same components and is given in the same way. It is therefore representative of the person&#x27;s&#x27;s behavior and cognition. The results of a standardized test are only part of the jigsaw. Further, multidisciplinary investigations (e.g. neuroimaging, neurological) are typically needed to officially diagnose a brain-injured patient.

==== Intelligence testing ====

Testing one&#x27;s intelligence can also give a clue to whether there is a problem in the brain-behavior connection. The Wechsler Scales are the tests most often used to determine level of intelligence. The variety of scales available, the nature of the tasks, as well as a wide gap in verbal and performance scores can give clues to whether there is a learning disability or damage to a certain area of the brain.

==== Testing other areas ====
Other areas are also tested when a patient goes through neuropsychological assessment. These can include sensory perception, motor functions, attention, memory, auditory and visual processing, language, problem solving, planning, organization, speed of processing, and many others. Neuropsychological assessment can test many areas of cognitive and executive functioning to determine whether a patient&#x27;s difficulty in function and behavior has a neuropsychological basis.

== Information gathered from assessment ==
Tsatsanis and Volkmar believe that assessment can provide unique information about the type of disorder a patient has which allows the psychologist to come up with a treatment plan. Neuropsychological assessment can clarify the nature of the disorder and determine the cognitive functioning associated with a disorder. Assessment can also allow the psychologist to understand the developmental progress of the disorder in order to predict future problems and come up with a successful treatment package. Different assessments can also determine if a patient will be at risk for a particular disorder. However, assessing a patient at one time is not enough to go ahead and continue treatment because of the changes in behavior that can occur frequently. A patient must be retested multiple times in order to make sure that the current treatment is still the right treatment. For neuropsychological assessments, researchers discover the different areas of the brain that is damaged based on the cognitive and behavioral aspects of the patient.

== Benefits of assessment ==
The most beneficial factor of neuropsychological assessment provides an accurate diagnosis of the disorder for the patient when it is unclear to the psychologist what exactly the patient has. This allows for accurate treatment later on in the process because treatment is driven by the exact symptoms of the disorder and how a specific patient may react to different treatments. The assessment allows the psychologist and patient to understand the severity of the deficit and to allow better decision-making by both parties. It is also helpful in understanding deteriorating diseases because the patient can be assessed multiple times to see how the disorder is progressing.

One area where neuropsychological assessments can be beneficial is in forensic cases where the defendant&#x27;s competency is being questioned due to possible brain injury or damage. A neuropsychological assessment may show brain damage when neuroimaging has failed. It can also determine whether the individual is faking a disorder (malingering) in order to attain a lesser sentence.

Most neuropsychological testing can be completed in 6 to 12 hours or less. This time, however, does not include the role of the psychologist interpreting the data, scoring the test, making formulations, and writing a formal report.

== Qualifications for conducting assessments ==
Neuropsychological assessments are usually conducted by doctoral-level (Ph.D., Psy.D.) psychologists trained in neuropsychology, known as clinical neuropsychologists. The definition and scope of a clinical neuropsychologist is outlined in the widely accepted Houston Conference Guidelines. They will usually have postdoctoral training in neuropsychology, neuroanatomy, and brain function. Most will be licensed and practicing psychologists in their particular field. Recent developments in the field allow for highly trained individuals such as psychometrists to administer selected instruments, though determinations regarding testing results remain the responsibility of the doctor.

<text>In the Easter Rising in Dublin on 24 April 1916, the Proclamation of the Irish Republic read by Padraig Pearse was headed and signed as being issued by the &#x27;Provisional Government of the Irish Republic&#x27;. The Rising lasted five days and, despite controlling only a few strategic sites, transformed the political picture in Ireland and began a chain of events that led to Independence for the Irish Free State six years later.

It is probable that all the leaders of the Rising expected to be defeated, and in a very short time. The object of their action was to strike the first blow in the struggle for freedom, rather than actually to establish a republic, with institutions, policies and government. The establishment of a Provisional government, therefore, was symbolic rather than practical. In contrast with the DÃ¡il government of 1919â1922, which had a cabinet, a police force and a courts system, or the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State, the Provisional Government of April 1916 does not appear ever to have operated as such.

==Members of the Provisional Government==
The Proclamation was signed &quot;on Behalf of the Provisional Government&quot; by seven men, whose names were printed as follows:

Since no manuscript of the Proclamation exists, there are no holograph signatures. The seven signed âon behalf ofâ the Provisional Government, but it is generally accepted that they were themselves the government. However, there is no evidence that there were any designated responsibilities for any of the seven. It is not obvious in what order they signed. The signatures are commonly read from left to right and top to bottom, but they could just as easily be read from top to bottom on the left and then on the right. This would put Pearse in third place, after Clarke and Mac Diarmada, the original organisers of the Rising. Connolly, as leader of the Irish Citizen Army, would come after him. These four (plus Plunkett) were in the GPO Headquarters during the Rising, and military orders were issued by all four. Even the identity of the head of government is not altogether clear-cut. In all probability, such distinctions were unimportant to the leaders of the Rising, and in the lead-up to Easter 1916, and during Easter Week itself, all their energies were devoted to the military campaign. With their deaths in the first two weeks of May 1916 the first government of the Irish Republic came to an end.

Pearse is generally believed to have been the leader of the rebels, and therefore assumed to have been the Head of Government and President of the Republic, and is described as the &quot;first President of the Irish Republic&quot; by historian Tim Pat Coogan. However Kathleen Clarke, the widow of Tom Clarke, maintained that, by inviting Clarke to sign first, the other signatories acknowledged him as first President of the Republic, and said that Clarke confirmed that interpretation to her. On the 50th anniversary ceremonies in 1966, Mrs Clarke said in an interview that Pearse had &quot;wanted to grab what was due to others . . . surely Pearse should have been satisfied with the honour of Commander-in-Chief when he knew as much about commanding as my dog â¦ I had not intended raising the issue in public but I shall be forced to come out very strongly in public if the powers that be attempt to declare Pearse as President&quot;. Clarke&#x27;s son, however, accepted that Pearse and not his father had been President of the Irish Republic.

<doc id="1033890" wikidata="Q7103439" url="?curid=1033890" title="Ormond Castle">
<text>Ormond Castle, also known as Avoch Castle, was a powerful stronghold, overlooking the village of Avoch, on the Black Isle, in the former county of Ross and Cromarty, now part of Highland, Scotland. It controlled a prominent position overlooking the Moray Firth and critical to the sea access to Inverness.

==Origins==

The castle dates from the late 12th century and was rebuilt as a strong rectangular fortress with square corner towers (in the Norman style) between 1200 and 1214 by William the Lion as a royal fortress.

==De Moravia==
By the thirteenth century, the castle was in the hands of the de Moravias of Petty and was where they ruled their vast tracts of land across Moray. Andrew de Moravia mustered the men of Moray to join King John Balliol at Ormond Castle following his dishonour in front of Edward I of England, at the outset of Wars of Scottish Independence.

Sir Andrew Murray died here in 1338.

==Douglas==
The heiress to the de Moravias of Petty was Joanna of Bothwell, in 1362 she married Archibald the Grim, Lord of Galloway and later 3rd Earl of Douglas who claimed her estates and titles &quot;de jure uxoris&quot; (by right of marriage). Ormond Castle was the caput of the &quot;Barony of Ormonde&quot;, and was created into an Earldom in 1445 for Hugh Douglas, Earl of Ormonde, third son of James Douglas, 7th Earl of Douglas. Following the fall of the Black Douglases after the Battle of Arkinholm in 1455 and the execution of the earl, his properties, like those of his brothers, was forfeit. Ormond Castle was taken by the crown and regranted to George Douglas, 4th Earl of Angus. Angus, the &quot;Red Douglas&quot;, was a kinsman and enemy of the Black Douglases, and became the new power from that mighty house.
The title of Earl of Ormonde was recreated for the elder son of the 1st Marquess of Douglas in 1651, but became extinct upon the death of Archibald Douglas, 3rd Earl of Ormonde in 1715, who died of wounds following the Battle of Sheriffmuir.

==Munro==
From 1560 to 1568 the castle was owned by David Chalmers, Lord Ormond, but his support of Mary Queen of Scots forced him into exile in 1568 and he was forced to sell the castle and the adjacent estates of Suddie and Avoch.

In 1568 Ormond Castle and the lands of Suddie in Avoch were acquired under feu from the Earls of Angus and Ormonde, by Andrew Munro, 5th of Milntown, also known as Andrew Munro of Newmore during his father&#x27;s lifetime.

==Cromwell==

Ormond Castle was destroyed in the 1650s by Oliver Cromwell, in order for him to build his fortress at Inverness. Only ruins of the castle remain today.

<text>Adolf Hitler, chancellor and dictator of Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945, committed suicide via a gunshot to the head on 30 April 1945 in the in Berlin after it became clear that Germany would lose the Battle of Berlin, which led to the end of World WarÂ II in Europe. Eva Braun, his wife of one day, also committed suicide by cyanide poisoning. In accordance with Hitler&#x27;s prior written and verbal instructions, that afternoon their remains were carried up the stairs and through the bunker&#x27;s emergency exit to the Reich Chancellery garden, where they were doused in petrol and burned. The news of Hitler&#x27;s death was announced on German radio the next day, 1Â May.

Eyewitnesses who saw Hitler&#x27;s body immediately after his suicide testified that he died from a self-inflicted gunshot, presumably to the temple. Otto GÃ¼nsche, Hitler&#x27;s personal adjutant, who handled both bodies, testified that while Braun&#x27;s smelled strongly of burnt almondsan indication of cyanide poisoningthere was no such odour about Hitler&#x27;s body, which smelled of gunpowder. Dental remains found in the Chancellery garden were matched with Hitler&#x27;s dental records in May 1945. The dental remains were later confirmed as being Hitler&#x27;s.

The Soviet Union restricted the release of information and released many conflicting reports about Hitler&#x27;s death. Historians have largely rejected these as part of a deliberate disinformation campaign by Joseph Stalin to sow confusion regarding Hitler&#x27;s death, or have attempted to reconcile them. Soviet records allege that the burnt remains of Hitler and Braun were recovered, despite eyewitness accounts that they were almost completely reduced to ashes. In June 1945, the Soviets began seeding two contradictory narratives: that Hitler died by taking cyanide or that he had survived and fled to another country. Following extensive review, West Germany issued a death certificate in 1956. Conspiracy theories about Hitler&#x27;s death continue to attract interest.

==Preceding events==
By early 1945, Nazi Germany was on the verge of total military collapse. Poland had fallen to the advancing Soviet Red Army, which was preparing to cross the Oder between KÃ¼strin and Frankfurt-an-der-Oder with the objective of capturing Berlin to the west. German forces had recently lost to the Allies in the Ardennes Offensive, with British and Canadian forces crossing the Rhine into the German industrial heartland of the Ruhr. US forces in the south had captured Lorraine and were advancing towards Mainz, Mannheim, and the Rhine. German forces in Italy were withdrawing north, as they were pressed by United States and Commonwealth forces as part of the Spring Offensive to advance across the Po and into the foothills of the Alps.

Hitler retreated to the in Berlin on 16 January 1945. It was clear to the Nazi leadership that the Battle of Berlin would be the final battle of the war in Europe. Some 325,000 soldiers of Germany&#x27;s Army GroupÂ B were surrounded and captured in the Ruhr Pocket on 18 April, leaving the path open for US forces to reach Berlin. By 11 April, the Americans crossed the Elbe, to the west of the city. On 16 April, Soviet forces to the east crossed the Oder and commenced the battle for the Seelow Heights, the last major defensive line protecting Berlin on that side. By 19 April, the Germans were in full retreat from the Seelow Heights, leaving no front line. Berlin was bombarded by Soviet artillery for the first time on 20 April, Hitler&#x27;s birthday. By the evening of 21 April, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of the city.

On 21 April, Hitler ordered a special detachment commanded by SS-&quot;ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer&quot; Felix Steiner to counterattack the Soviets. At the next day&#x27;s afternoon situation conference, Hitler suffered a nervous collapse when he was informed that these orders had not been obeyed. He launched into a tirade against his generals, calling them treacherous and incompetent, culminating in a declarationfor the first timethat the war was lost. Hitler announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself. Later that day, he asked SS physician Werner Haase about the most reliable method of suicide. Haase suggested the &quot;pistol-and-poison method&quot; of combining a dose of cyanide with a gunshot to the head. &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; chief Hermann GÃ¶ring learned about Hitler&#x27;s admission of defeat and declaration of his intended suicide and sent a telegram to Hitler, asking for permission to take over the leadership of the Reich in accordance with Hitler&#x27;s 1941 decree naming him as his successor. Hitler&#x27;s secretary Martin Bormann convinced Hitler that the letter from GÃ¶ring was an attempt to overthrow the dictator. In response, Hitler informed GÃ¶ring that he would be executed unless he resigned all of his posts. Later that day, he sacked GÃ¶ring from all of his offices and ordered his arrest. Hitler also ordered his chief aide and adjutant, Julius Schaub, to destroy safeguarded documents and his personal train.

By 27 April, Berlin&#x27;s communication had been all but cut off from the rest of Germany. Secure radio contact with defending units had been lost; the command staff in the had to depend on telephone lines for passing instructions and orders, and on public radio for news and information. On 28 April, Hitler received a BBC report originating from Reuters: it stated that Heinrich Himmler had offered to surrender to the western Allies. The offer was declined. Himmler had implied to the Allies that he had the authority to negotiate a surrender, which Hitler considered to be treason. That afternoon, Hitler&#x27;s anger and bitterness escalated into a rage against Himmler. He ordered Himmler&#x27;s arrest and had SS-&quot;GruppenfÃ¼hrer&quot; Hermann Fegelein (Himmler&#x27;s SS representative at Hitler&#x27;s headquarters) shot for desertion.

By this time, the Red Army had advanced to the Potsdamer Platz, roughly a kilometre away from the bunker, and all indications were that they were preparing to storm the Reich Chancellery. This report and Himmler&#x27;s betrayal prompted Hitler to make the last decisions of his life. Shortly after midnight on 29 April, he married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony in a map room within the . The two then hosted a modest wedding breakfast, after which Hitler took his secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated his last will and testament. It left instructions to be carried out immediately following his death, with Grand Admiral Karl DÃ¶nitz and Joseph Goebbels assuming Hitler&#x27;s roles as head of state and chancellor, respectively. Hitler signed these documents at 04:00 and then went to bed. Some sources say that he dictated the last will and testament immediately before the wedding, but all agree on the timing of the signing.

On the afternoon of 29 April, Hitler learned that his ally, Benito Mussolini, had been executed by Italian partisans. The bodies of Mussolini and his mistress, Clara Petacci, had been strung up by their heels. The corpses were later cut down and thrown into the gutter, where they were mocked by Italian dissidents. These events may have strengthened Hitler&#x27;s resolve not to allow himself or his wife to be made a &quot;spectacle&quot; of, as he had earlier recorded in his testament. Hitler had been given some capsules of prussic acid by Himmler through SS physician Ludwig Stumpfegger, and initially had intended to use them for his suicide. When he received the news that Himmler had contacted the Allies through a Swedish diplomat to arrange for an end to the war, Hitler was outraged. With this betrayal in his mind, Hitler began to doubt whether the ampoules would be effective. He ordered Haase to test one on his dog Blondi. The capsule workedthe dog died instantly.

==Suicide==
Hitler and Braun lived together as husband and wife in the bunker for less than 40 hours. By 01:00 on 30 April, Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel had reported that all of the forces on which Hitler had been depending to rescue Berlin had either been encircled or forced onto the defensive. At around 02:30, Hitler appeared in the corridor where about twenty people, mostly women, were assembled to give their farewells. He went down the line, shaking hands and speaking with each of them, before retiring to his quarters. Late in the morning, with the Soviets less than from the &quot;FÃ¼hrerbunker&quot;, Hitler had a meeting with General Helmuth Weidling, the commander of the Berlin Defence Area. Weidling told Hitler that the garrison would probably run out of ammunition that night, and that the fighting in Berlin would inevitably come to an end within the next 24 hours. Weidling asked for permission for a breakout; this was a request he had unsuccessfully made before. Hitler did not answer, and Weidling went back to his headquarters in the Bendlerblock. At about 13:00, he received Hitler&#x27;s permission to attempt a breakout that night. Hitler, two secretaries, and his personal cook then had lunch, after which Hitler and Braun said goodbye to members of the bunker staff and fellow occupants, including Bormann, Goebbels, the secretaries, and several military officers. At around 14:30 Adolf and Eva Hitler went into his personal study. Hitler&#x27;s adjutant SS-&quot;SturmbannfÃ¼hrer&quot; Otto GÃ¼nsche stood guard outside the study door.

After some time, Hitler&#x27;s valet, Heinz Linge, entered the antechamber to Hitler&#x27;s quarters, where he discovered the door closed and could smell gunpowder smoke. Linge went back out to the corridor where Bormann was standing, and the two then entered the study together. Linge later stated that while in the room he immediately noted a scent of burnt almonds, which is a common observation in the presence of hydrogen cyanide. Linge saw the bodies of Hitler and Braun sitting upright on the sofa, with Hitler to Braun&#x27;s right. His head was canted to his right. GÃ¼nsche entered the study shortly afterwards, later stating that Hitler &quot;sat... sunken over, with blood dripping out of his right temple. He had shot himself with his own pistol.&quot; According to Linge, the 7.65-mm weapon was a WaltherÂ PP or PPK, while GÃ¼nsche specified it was the latter. The gun lay at his feet. Hitler&#x27;s dripping blood had made a large stain on the right arm of the sofa and was pooling on the rug. According to Linge, Braun&#x27;s body had no visible wounds, and her face showed how she had diedfrom cyanide poisoning. GÃ¼nsche and SS- Wilhelm Mohnke stated &quot;unequivocally&quot; that all outsiders and those performing duties and work in the bunker &quot;did not have any access&quot; to Hitler&#x27;s private living quarters during the time of death (between 15:00 and 16:00).

GÃ¼nsche left the study and announced that Hitler was dead to a group in the briefing room, which included Goebbels and Generals Hans Krebs and Wilhelm Burgdorf. These three, in addition to others including Hitler Youth leader Artur Axmann, viewed the bodies. Linge and another man rolled up Hitler&#x27;s body in a blanket, and then, in accordance with Hitler&#x27;s prior written and verbal instructions, his and Braun&#x27;s bodies were carried up the stairs and through the bunker&#x27;s emergency exit to the garden behind the Reich Chancellery, where they were to be burned with petrol. Although Hitler&#x27;s corpse was partially covered by the blanket, numerous witnesses testified to recognising him, as the top of his head was not covered, nor were his lower legs and feet.

The bunker telephone operator SS- Rochus Misch reported Hitler&#x27;s death to (&quot;FÃ¼hrer&quot; Escort Command) chief Franz SchÃ¤dle and returned to the switchboard, later recalling someone shouting that Hitler&#x27;s body was being burned. After the first attempts to ignite the petrol did not work, Linge went back inside the bunker and returned with a thick roll of papers. Bormann lit the papers and threw them onto the bodies. As the two corpses caught fire, a group including Bormann, GÃ¼nsche, Linge, Goebbels, Erich Kempka, Peter HÃ¶gl, Ewald Lindloff, and Hans Reisser raised their arms in salute as they stood just inside the bunker doorway.

At around 16:15, Linge ordered SS- Heinz KrÃ¼ger and SS- Werner Schwiedel to roll up the rug in Hitler&#x27;s study to burn it. Schwiedel later stated that upon entering the study, he saw a pool of blood the size of a &quot;large dinner plate&quot; by the arm-rest of the sofa. Noticing a spent cartridge case, he bent down and picked it up from where it lay on the rug about from a 7.65 pistol. The two men removed the blood-stained rug and carried it up the stairs and outside to the Chancellery garden, where it was placed on the ground and burned.

The Red Army shelled the area in and around the Reich Chancellery on and off during the afternoon. SS guards brought over additional cans of petrol to further burn the corpses. Although the corpses were being burned in the open, where the distribution of heat varies (as opposed to in a crematorium), according to eyewitnesses, the copious amount of fuel applied from about 16:00 to 18:30 reduced the remains to something between charred bones and piles of ashes which fell apart to the touch. At approximately 18:30, Lindloff (and perhaps Reisser) covered up the ashen remains in a shallow bomb crater. The shelling and a fire from napalm incendiary bombs continued until 2 May. During this period it was difficult to spend any time in the garden because of the continuous shelling.

==Aftermath==

Krebs met Soviet general Vasily Chuikov just prior to 04:00 on 1 May, giving him the news of Hitler&#x27;s death, while attempting to negotiate a ceasefire and open &quot;peace negotiations&quot;. Joseph Stalin was informed of Hitler&#x27;s suicide around 04:05 Berlin time, thirteen hours after the event. He demanded unconditional surrender, which Krebs lacked authorisation to give. Stalin wanted confirmation that Hitler was dead and ordered the Red Army&#x27;s counterespionage unit, SMERSH, to find his corpse.

The first inkling to the outside world that Hitler was dead came from the Germans themselves. On the night of 1 May, the radio station interrupted their normal program to announce that Hitler had died that afternoon, and introduced his successor, DÃ¶nitz. DÃ¶nitz called upon the German people to mourn their &quot;FÃ¼hrer&quot;, whom he stated had died a hero defending the capital of the Reich. Hoping to save the army and the nation by negotiating a partial surrender to the British and Americans, DÃ¶nitz authorised a fighting withdrawal to the west. His tactic was somewhat successful: it enabled about 1.8Â million German soldiers to avoid capture by the Soviets, but came at a high cost in bloodshed, as troops continued to fight until 8 May.

In the early morning hours of 2 May, the Soviets captured the Reich Chancellery. Inside the , Krebs and Burgdorf shot themselves in the head. In early May, Hitler&#x27;s and Braun&#x27;s dental remains were extracted from the soil. Stalin was wary of believing Hitler was dead and restricted the release of information to the public. By 11 May, dental assistant KÃ¤the Heusermann and dental technician Fritz Echtmann, both of whom had worked for Hitler&#x27;s dentist Hugo Blaschke, identified the dental remains of Hitler and Braun. Both would spend years in Soviet prisons. An alleged Soviet autopsy of Hitler made public in 1968 was used by forensic odontologists Reidar F. Sognnaes and Ferdinand StrÃ¸m to confirm the authenticity of Hitler&#x27;s dental remains in 1972. In 2017, French forensic pathologist Philippe Charlier also found the dental remains in the Soviet archives, including teeth on part of a jawbone, to be in &quot;perfect agreement&quot; with X-rays taken of Hitler in 1944. Charlier used electron microscopy to examine the tartar, which contained only plant fibres, a detail consistent with Hitler&#x27;s vegetarianism. In May 2018, the &quot;European Journal of Internal Medicine&quot; published a paper co-authored by Charlier and four other researchers, which concluded that these remains &quot;cannot be a fake&quot;, citing their significant wear. No gunpowder residue was detected, indicating that Hitler did not die by a gunshot wound through the mouth, as Axmann contended.

In early June 1945, SMERSH moved the remains of several individuals, including the Goebbels family (Joseph, Magda, and their children), from Buch to Finow. Hitler and Braun&#x27;s remains were alleged to have been moved as well, but this is most likely Soviet disinformation. There is no evidence that any bodily remains of Hitler or Braunwith the exception of the dental remainswere found by the Soviets. The remains of the Goebbels family and others were buried in a forest in Brandenburg on 3 June 1945, then exhumed and moved to SMERSH&#x27;s new facility in Magdeburg, where they were in February 1946. By 1970, the facility was under KGB control and scheduled to be relinquished to East Germany. Concerned that a known Nazi burial site might become a neo-Nazi shrine, KGB director Yuri Andropov authorised an operation to exhume and destroy the decaying remains. On 4 April 1970, a KGB team thoroughly cremated them and cast the ashes into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the nearby Elbe.

For politically motivated reasons, the Soviet Union presented various versions of Hitler&#x27;s fate. On 5Â June, the Soviets claimed that his body had been examined and that he had died by cyanide poisoning. At a press conference on 9 June, the Soviets said they had not actually identified the body and that Hitler had likely escaped. When asked in July 1945 how Hitler had died, Stalin said he was living &quot;in Spain or Argentina&quot;. In November 1945, Dick White, the head of counter-intelligence in the British sector of Berlin, had their agent Hugh Trevor-Roper investigate. His report was expanded and published in 1947 as &quot;The Last Days of Hitler&quot;. In the years immediately after the war, the Soviets maintained that Hitler was not dead, but had escaped and was either being sheltered by the former western Allies, was in Francoist Spain, or was somewhere in South America. The 1947 American book &quot;Who Killed Hitler?&quot; suggests that Soviet leadership &quot;[kept] the ghost of Hitler alive&quot; to motivate its Communist forces to continue fighting against fascism.

Until the mid-1950s, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and Central Intelligence Agency investigated many claims that Hitler might still be alive, while lending none of them credence. The documents remained classified until the early 2010s, as authorised by the 1998 Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act. The secrecy in which the investigation was shrouded helped fuel fringe theories asserting Hitler&#x27;s survival. Presiding judge at the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; trial at Nuremberg Michael Musmanno considered all such claims contrary to the evidence.

Between 1948 and 1952, amid denazification proceedings in West Germany, legal disputes over Hitler&#x27;s former property (including &quot;The Art of Painting&quot; by Johannes Vermeer) were hindered by the lack of an official death declaration. Beginning in 1952, a federal court in Berchtesgaden interviewed 42 witnesses about Hitler&#x27;s suicidebehind closed doors to avoid testimonies influencing one another. After four years of extensive review, Judge Heinrich Stephanus concluded: &quot;There can no longer be the slightest doubt that on 30 April 1945 Adolf Hitler put an end to his life in the Chancellery by his own hand, by means of a shot into his right temple.&quot; A death certificate was issued on 25 February 1956, with an attached report of more than 1,500 pages. An 80-page expert criminological report was prepared in mid-1956, focusing on the &quot;substantial discrepancies&quot; between eyewitness testimonies and serving as a springboard for photographic reconstructions. Ballistic experiments were arranged to determine which interpretation of the fatal gunshot was most likely. The declaration became public and legally binding by the year&#x27;s end. Hitler&#x27;s demise was entered as an assumption of death on the basis that none of the witnesses had seen his body, which German historian Anton Joachimsthaler points out is incorrect. The federal court went on to publish a summary of its findings of fact in a 1958 press release.

===Further Soviet investigations and disinformation===
On 11 December 1945, the Soviets allowed a limited investigation of the bunker complex grounds by the other Allied powers (Britain, France, and the US). Two representatives from each nation watched several Germans dig up soil down to the concrete roof of the bunker; the excavation included the bomb crater where Hitler&#x27;s burnt remains had been buried. Found during the dig were two hats identified as Hitler&#x27;s, an undergarment with Braun&#x27;s initials, and some reports to Hitler from Goebbels. The Soviet People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) barred further excavation on the accusation that the representatives had removed documents from the Reich Chancellery.

At the end of 1945, Stalin ordered the NKVD to form a second commission to investigate Hitler&#x27;s death. On 30 May 1946, agents of the NKVD&#x27;s successor, the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), found part of a skull in the crater where Hitler&#x27;s remains had been exhumed. The remnant consists of part of the occipital bone and part of both parietal bones. The nearly complete left parietal bone has a bullet hole, apparently an exit wound. This remained uncatalogued until 1975, and was rediscovered in the Russian State Archives in 1993. In 2009, University of Connecticut archaeologist and bone specialist Nick Bellantoni examined the skull fragment, which Soviet officials believed to be Hitler&#x27;s. According to Bellantoni, &quot;The bone seemed very thin&quot; for a male, and &quot;the sutures where the skull plates come together seemed to correspond to someone under 40&quot;. A small piece detached from the skull was DNA-tested, as was blood from Hitler&#x27;s sofa. The skull was determined to be that of a woman, while the blood was confirmed to belong to a male.

On 29 December 1949, a secret dossier on Hitler was presented to Stalin, which was based upon the interrogation of Nazis who had been present in the , including GÃ¼nsche and Linge. Western historians were allowed into the archives of the former Soviet Union beginning in 1991, but the dossier remained undiscovered for twelve years; in 2005, it was published as &quot;The Hitler Book&quot;.

In 1968, Soviet journalist Lev Bezymenski published his book, &quot;The Death of Adolf Hitler&quot;, which includes previously unreleased photographs of the dental remains. The book transcribes a purported Soviet forensic examination led by Faust Shkaravsky, which concluded that Hitler died by cyanide poisoning. Bezymenski further theorised that Hitler requested a to ensure his quick death, but later admitted that his work included &quot;deliberate lies&quot;, such as the manner of Hitler&#x27;s death. The book and alleged autopsy have been widely derided by Western historians. Joachimsthaler, in his extensive analysis of the circumstances surrounding Hitler&#x27;s death, quotes a German pathologist as saying about the purported autopsy: &quot;Bezemensky&#x27;s report is ridiculous... Any one of my assistants would have done better... the whole thing is a farce... it is intolerably bad work... the transcript of the post-mortem section of 8 [May] 1945 describes anything but Hitler.&quot; Journalist James P. O&#x27;Donnell corrects the book&#x27;s claim that cyanide acts instantaneously, saying Hitler could have taken poison and still had enough time to shoot himself.

==Legacy==
After Hitler&#x27;s death and the end of World War II in Europe, the occupying Allies divided Germany into four zones. This led to the start of the Cold War between the Western Bloc, supported by the US, and the Eastern Bloc, supported by the Soviet Union. From 1961 until 1989, the divide was physically manifested via the Berlin Wall, followed by Germany&#x27;s reunification in 1990 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Following Hitler&#x27;s death, war veteran and future US president John F. Kennedy wrote in his diary that the dictator &quot;had a mystery about him in the way he lived and in the manner of his death that will live and grow after him&quot;. Historian Joachim Fest opines that the almost &quot;traceless&quot; death of Hitler allowed him to stay in the public eye, granting him a &quot;bizarre afterlife&quot;; conspiracy theoriesrooted in Soviet disinformation alleging his survivalbolstered continued doubts and speculation, including outlandish tabloid and journalistic reports published into the late 20th century. Conspiracy theories about Hitler&#x27;s death and about the Nazi era as a whole still attract interest, with books, TV shows, and films continuing to be produced on the topic. Historian Luke Daly-Groves wrote that Hitler&#x27;s death is not about the death of one man, but carries a greater significance as to the end of the regime and the ideological impact it left behind.

<text>Jim Norton (born 4 January 1938) is an Irish stage, film and television character actor, known for his work in the theatre, most notably in Conor McPherson&#x27;s &quot;The Seafarer&quot;, and on television as Bishop Brennan in the sitcom &quot;Father Ted&quot;.

==Early life==
Jim Norton was born on 4 January 1938 in Dublin, Ireland, and educated at Synge Street CBS. From an early age he wanted to be an actor, and regularly attended performances at the Abbey Theatre. His mother, Frances, played the violin and his father, Eugene, was a baritone singer. Eugene worked as a bakery manager. Jim had one sibling, the late acting teacher Betty Ann Norton.

==Career==
Norton has been acting for over fifty years in theatre, television, and film, and frequently plays clergymen, most notably Bishop Brennan in the sitcom &quot;Father Ted&quot;, as well as roles in &quot;The Sweeney&quot; (1975), &quot;Peak Practice&quot; (1993), &quot;Sunset Heights&quot; (1997), &quot;A Love Divided&quot; (1999), &quot;Rebus: Black and Blue&quot; (2000), &quot;Mad About Mambo&quot; (2000), Boxed (2003) and &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s Hall&quot; (2014).

Norton starred as Finian McLonergan in the critically acclaimed New York City Center&#x27;s 2009 production of &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, and in October 2009 reprised the role in the Broadway revival at the St. James Theatre. His co-stars were Cheyenne Jackson (Woody) and Kate Baldwin (Sharon).

Norton has appeared in two episodes of &quot;Van der Valk&quot;. On &quot;Babylon 5&quot; he appeared in a number of roles, including that of Ombuds Wellington in the 1994 episodes &quot;Grail&quot; and &quot;The Quality of Mercy&quot;; a Narn in &quot;Dust to Dust&quot; (1996); and Dr. Lazarenn, a Markab doctor, in &quot;Confessions and Lamentations&quot; (1995).

<doc id="1033900" wikidata="Q1072640" url="?curid=1033900" title="Opel (album)">
<text>Opel is a 1988 album compiled from recordings made by former Pink Floyd frontman Syd Barrett between 1968 and 1970. The album is a compilation of unreleased material and alternative takes of recordings from sessions for Barrett&#x27;s solo albums, &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; and &quot;Barrett&quot;.

&quot;Opel&quot; was released in October 1988 on Harvest in the UK, and on Capitol Records in the US. The album was remastered and reissued in 1993, along with Barrett&#x27;s other albums, &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; and &quot;Barrett&quot; (both 1970), independently and as part of the &quot;Crazy Diamond&quot; box set. A newly remastered version was released in 2010.

==Background==
The album was originally set to include the unreleased Barrett Pink Floyd songs &quot;Scream Thy Last Scream&quot; and &quot;Vegetable Man&quot;, which had been remixed for the album by Jones. However, the two songs were pulled by Pink Floyd before &quot;Opel&quot; was finalised.

While Barrett only released two albums, &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; and &quot;Barrett&quot;, both in 1970, the existence of unreleased studio work was widely reported. After years of demand from Barrett&#x27;s considerable fan base, &quot;Opel&quot; was compiled and released. Barrett personally approved the new release.

==Release and content==

&quot;Opel&quot; consists of eight previously unreleased songs and alternative versions of six already released songs. The album was released due to the constant pressure from &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; producer, Malcolm Jones. Despite its positive reviews, it failed to chart. AllMusic reviewer Richie Unterberger said the album was &quot;charming&quot;, with the title track, &quot;Swan Lee (Silas Lang)&quot;, &quot;Dark Globe&quot; and &quot;Milky Way&quot; as highlights.

&quot;Opel&quot; (along with &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; and &quot;Barrett&quot;) was reissued both independently and as part of the &quot;Crazy Diamond&quot; Barrett box set, on 26 April 1993. A newly remastered version was released in 2010.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Syd Barrett, except &quot;Golden Hair&quot; (music by Barrett, based on a poem by James Joyce). All track information is taken from the &quot;Crazy Diamond&quot; version of &quot;Opel&quot;.

<text>Sir Henry Drummond Charles Wolff (12 October 1830 â 11 October 1908), known as Henry Drummond Wolff, was an English diplomat and Conservative Party politician, who started as a clerk in the Foreign Office.

==Background==
Wolff was born in Malta, the son of Joseph Wolff and Lady Georgiana Mary Walpole, daughter of Horatio Walpole, 2nd Earl of Orford. His father was a missionary who had converted from Judaism to Catholicism and then Anglicanism, and his mother was the niece of Prime Minister Robert Walpole.

Wolff was educated at Rugby School.

==Political and diplomatic career==
Wolff sat in parliament for Christchurch from 1874 to 1880 and for Portsmouth from 1880 to 1885. While MP for Christchurch he lived in Boscombe, where he developed the Boscombe Spa estate, and he played an active role in the public life of Bournemouth. In 1870 he presented Bournemouth Rowing Club with a four-oared racing boat. He was one of the group known as the Fourth Party.

In 1885 he went on a special mission to Constantinople and Egypt in connection with the Eastern Question, and as a result various awkward difficulties, hinging on the Sultan&#x27;s suzerainty, were addressed. Wolff negotiated a settlement whereby Britain and Turkey would each appoint a commissioner to Egypt to help the khedive&#x27;s government conduct reforms of the army and the government. Wolff then assumed the role of British high commissioner in Egypt from 1885 to 1887. He was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Teheran in 1888, a post he held until 1891, and was then Ambassador to Madrid from 1892 to 1900. While serving in Spain, he would assist Ambassador Taylor, of the United States, in out maneuvering Foreign Minister O&#x27;Donnell.

Wolff was a notable raconteur and aided the Conservative Party by helping to found the Primrose League. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1862 for various services abroad. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in 1878 and made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in 1889.

As the British Minister of Iran, he assisted Antoine Kitabgi Khan, the Director General of Persian Customs, in the negotiations that led Nasir al-Din Shah to grant a concession of full monopoly over Iran&#x27;s tobacco industry to Major G. F. Talbot (20 March 1890). This concession resulted in the Tobacco Protest of 1891 and is generally considered to mark the beginning of social unrest and clear Islamic clerical influence leading up to the Persian Constitutional Revolution in 1905.

In 1901, as Kitabgi Khan was looking in Europe for capitalists who might be interested in investing in oil prospection in Iran, Wolff introduced him to Englishman William Knox D&#x27;Arcy, who had made a fortune in gold mines in Australia. On 28 May 1901, Mozaffar ad-Din Shah granted D&#x27;Arcy the first oil concession in Iran that later gave birth to British Petroleum. The deed of concession stipulated that Wolff would have 10% of the profits resulting from the venture.
==Personal life==
Wolff&#x27;s only daughter, Lucas Cleeve, was a novelist. Her son Algernon Kingscote was a notable tennis player. Wolff&#x27;s grandson Henry Maxence Cavendish Drummond Wolff was briefly the Conservative Member of Parliament for Basingstoke.

He died at Brighton, one day before his 78th birthday.

==In popular culture==

Wolff was portrayed by Charles Lloyd-Pack in the 1974 Thames TV mini-series &quot;Jennie: Lady Randolph Churchill&quot;.

<doc id="1033909" wikidata="Q1923612" url="?curid=1033909" title="Eastern panhandle of West Virginia">
<text>The eastern panhandle is one of the two panhandles in the U.S. state of West Virginia; the other is the northern panhandle. It is a small stretch of territory in the northeast of the state, bordering Maryland and Virginia. Some sources and regional associations only identify the eastern panhandle as being composed of Morgan, Berkeley, and Jefferson Counties. Berkeley and Jefferson Counties are geographically located in the Shenandoah Valley. West Virginia is the only U.S. state with two panhandles.

==History==
Berkeley, Hampshire, Hardy, Jefferson, and Morgan Counties were part of the Unionist state of West Virginia created in 1863. Shortly after West Virginia gained statehood, Mineral and Grant Counties were created from Hampshire and Hardy in 1866.

The eastern panhandle includes West Virginia&#x27;s oldest chartered towns (1762) of Romney and Shepherdstown. The panhandle also includes West Virginia&#x27;s two oldest counties: Hampshire (1753) and Berkeley (1772). West Virginia&#x27;s historically most famous towns, Harpers Ferry and Charles Town, are at the eastern end of the eastern panhandle. Harpers Ferry is the easternmost town in West Virginia.

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, now CSX, runs through the panhandle. Until 1861 Harpers Ferry was the site of a U.S. armory (weapons factory), briefly captured by John Brown during his famous raid. The strategic nature of the area influenced its inclusion in West Virginia by the Union Congress.

There has been talk about certain counties in the eastern panhandle rejoining Virginia, due primarily to poor economic conditions and perceived neglect from the state government. In 2011, West Virginia state delegate Larry Kump sponsored legislation to allow Morgan, Berkeley, and Jefferson Counties to rejoin Virginia by popular vote. The bill did not pass.

==Geography==
The eastern panhandle includes both West Virginia&#x27;s highest and lowest elevations above sea level: Spruce Knob, , in Pendleton and Harpers Ferry, , in Jefferson on the Potomac River. The region is separated from the remainder of the state by the Allegheny Front, which separates the Mississippi watershed from that of Chesapeake Bay.

The counties in the eastern panhandle are:
*Berkeley
*Grant
*Hampshire
*Hardy
*Jefferson
*Mineral
*Morgan
*Pendleton County is included in some definitions.

A short stretch of West Virginia Route 9 west of Berkeley Springs provides the only road connection between Berkeley Springs and points east to the rest of state without having to cross state lines.

== Population ==
According to the 2010 census, the eight counties of the eastern panhandle had a combined population of 261,041, giving the region 11.75% of West Virginia&#x27;s population. Berkeley County is the panhandle&#x27;s most populous county, with a census 104,169 residents (2010). Berkeley also includes the panhandle&#x27;s largest city, Martinsburg, with a 2010 census population of 17,227.

=== Housing growth ===
The eastern panhandle is West Virginia&#x27;s fastest-growing region in terms of population and housing. In July 2005, the United States Census Bureau released a list of the top 100 counties according to housing growth. Berkeley County grew 3.95 percent, from 36,365 housing units in 2003 to 37,802 units in 2004. That growth rate was 86th in the nation among the 3,143 United States counties. Jefferson County was not far behind at 88th in the nation. It grew 3.94 percent from 19,381 housing units in 2003 to 20,144 units in 2004.

=== Largest municipalities ===
The majority of the eastern panhandle&#x27;s growing residential developments are located outside city and town boundaries and are not included in the city or town&#x27;s official population.

&quot;NOTE: This list does not include the unincorporated census-designated places of Inwood (pop. 2,954) and Fort Ashby (pop. 1,380). The U.S. Census Bureau does not release estimates for CDPs. The population figures listed are from the 2010 census.&quot;

=== Statistical areas ===
Several counties in the eastern panhandle are part of metropolitan, micropolitan, and consolidated metropolitan statistical areas defined by the United States Office of Management and Budget.

== County information ==
==Places of worship==

*Hampshire County is home to two religious learning centers: the Buddhist Bhavana Society Forest Monastery and Retreat Center in High View and the Global Country of World Peace&#x27;s Transcendental Meditation Learning Center and Retreat in Three Churches.

== Potomac Highlands ==
Grant, Hampshire, Hardy, Mineral, and Pendleton counties belong to the geographical region of West Virginia known as the Potomac Highlands of West Virginia.

<doc id="1033910" wikidata="Q6593185" url="?curid=1033910" title="Thomas Jacomb Hutton">
<text>Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Jacomb Hutton, (27 March 1890 â 17 January 1981) was a British Army officer who held a variety of vital staff appointments between the First and Second World Wars, ultimately commanding the Burma Army during the early stages of the Japanese conquest of Burma in early 1942.

Hutton was married to Scottish psychiatrist Isabel Emslie Hutton.

==Early life and First World War==
Thomas Jacomb Hutton was born on 27 March 1890 in Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, the eldest son of William Henry Hutton. He was educated at Rossall School and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. On 23 December 1909, after passing out from Woolwich, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Royal Field Artillery. Promoted on 23 December 1912 to lieutenant, Hutton served with the RFA on the Western Front throughout the First World War, being promoted to captain in 1915 and brevet major in 1918. He became staff qualified, and served in 1918 as a General Staff Officer Grade 3 (GSO3) and as a brigade major from 1918 to 1919.

==Between the wars==
From 1919 to 1920, Hutton served in the War Office as the Assistant Military Secretary and from 1923 to 1924 as the Deputy Assistant Adjutant General. He met Scottish psychiatrist Isabel Galloway Emslie in Constantinople and they married in 1921.

After attending the Staff College, Camberley, as a student from 1922 to 1923, Hutton was a General Staff Officer Grade 2 (GSO2) on the staff of Eastern Command from 1924 to 1926, in the eastern counties of Britain. He was promoted to the substantive rank of major in 1927, and from 1927 to 1930 he was the Military Assistant to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) and later attended the Imperial Defence College. He was &quot;double jumped&quot; to the rank of full colonel in 1930 and served from 1933 to 1936 as General Staff Officer Grade 1 (GSO1) in the Directorate of Military Operations in the War Office.

In 1936, Hutton served in the British forces in Palestine during the Arab revolt. From 1936 to 1938 he was the GSO1 (Chief of Staff) in the 1st Infantry Division, which was sent to Palestine. He was promoted to major-general and appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) Western Independent District, in India in 1938.

==Second World War==
In 1940, after the outbreak of the Second World War, Hutton was appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff, GHQ India. The following year he was promoted lieutenant-general and became Chief of the General Staff at GHQ India.

===Burma Army===
In 1942, Hutton was appointed General Officer Commanding Burma Command, which was facing imminent invasion by Japanese troops. Burma Army was subordinated to the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command, of which Archibald Wavell was Commander in Chief.

Hutton initially ordered his subordinates to fight as close to the borders as possible. Some of them thought that he was doing so on Wavell&#x27;s orders, but Hutton actually wished to gain time for reinforcements to arrive. This resulted in the defeat of the ill-equipped and badly-trained Burmese and Indian formations that tried to fight close to the frontier.

Hutton now considered that Rangoon, the capital, could not be defended. He attempted to divert reinforcements to ports further north. Wavell considered this to be defeatism, and stormed at Hutton in front of witnesses at a meeting on 28 February. He did not argue back, feeling that a dignified silence was the best rebuke. Hutton had already been superseded by General Harold Alexander as GOC of Burma Army, and appointed Alexander&#x27;s Chief of Staff, an embarrassing appointment he held until Burma Army was disbanded later in the year.

During the crisis in Burma in 1942, it was felt by some senior officers (such as General Sir Alan Hartley, the acting Commander in Chief in India), that Hutton made a good chief of staff but was not fitted for command in the field. Hutton subsequently served until 1944 as Secretary of the War Resources and Reconstruction Committees of Council, India. In 1944, he retired from the army.

==Later career==
Hutton held a variety of Civil Posts after his retirement: from 1944 to 1946, he was Officiating Secretary, Viceroy&#x27;s Executive Council in India.

<doc id="1033912" wikidata="Q753582" url="?curid=1033912" title="Economic base analysis">
<text>Economic base analysis is a theory that posits that activities in an area divide into two categories: basic and nonbasic. Basic industries are those exporting from the region and bringing wealth from outside, while nonbasic (or service) industries support basic industries. Because export-import flows are usually not tracked at sub-national (regional) levels, it is not practical to study industry output and trade flows to and from a region. As an alternative, the concepts of basic and nonbasic are operationalized using employment data. The theory was developed by Robert Murray Haig in his work on the Regional Plan of New York in 1928.

==Application of the analysis==
The basic industries of a region are identified by comparing employment in the region to national norms. If the national norm for employment in, for example, Egyptian woodwind manufacturing is 5 percent and the region&#x27;s employment is 8 percent, then 3 percent of the region&#x27;s woodwind employment is basic. Once basic employment is identified, the outlook for basic employment is investigated sector by sector and projections made sector by sector. In turn, this permits the projection of total employment in the region. Typically the basic/nonbasic employment ratio is about 1:1. Extending by manipulation of data and comparisons, conjectures may be made about population and income. This is a rough, serviceable procedure, and it remains in use today. It has the advantage of being readily operationalized, fiddled with, and understandable.

==Formula==
The formula for computing location quotients can be written as:

formula_1

Where:

formula_2 Local employment in industry i

formula_3 Total local employment

formula_4 Reference area employment in industry i

formula_5 Total reference area employment

It is assumed that the base year is identical in all of the above variables.

==Example and methodology==
Economic base ideas can be easy to understand, as are measures made of employment. For instance, it is well known that the economy of Seattle, Washington is tied to aircraft manufacturing, that of Detroit, Michigan, to automobiles, and that of Silicon Valley to high-tech manufacturing. When newspapers discuss the closing of military bases, they may say something like: &quot;5,000 jobs at the base will be lost. That&#x27;s going to hit the economy hard because it means a loss of 10,000 jobs in the community.&quot;

To forecast, the main procedure is to compare the region with the nation and national trends. If the economic base of a region is in industries that are declining nationwide, then the region faces a problem. If its economic base is concentrated in sectors that are growing, then it is in good shape.

Methodologically, economic base analysis views the region as if it were a small nation and uses notions of relative and comparative advantage from international trade theory (Charles Tiebout 1963). In a sense, the activity is macroeconomics &quot;written small&quot;, and it has not been of much interest to urban economists in recent years because it does not get at within-city relationships. The analysis usually takes US growth patterns as a given. The fates of regions are determined by trends in the national economy.
==Assumptions==

As H. Craig Davis points out, there are a number of assumptions on which economic base analysis is conducted. These include (1) that exports are the sole source of economic growth (investment, government spending, and household consumption are ignored); (2) that the export industry is homogeneous (i.e., that an increase or decrease of one export does not affect another); (3) the constancy of the export/service ratio; (4) that there is no inter-regional feedback; and (5) that there is a pool of underutilized resources.

<text>Julius Kariuki (born June 12, 1961) is the winner of the 3,000 m steeplechase at the 1988 Summer Olympics.

Born in Nyahururu, Kenya, Kariuki&#x27;s athletic career started slowly. He made his international debut at the 1984 Summer Olympics, where he finished seventh in the 3000 m steeplechase.

The following year, Kariuki won the steeplechase at the African Championships in Athletics, and then followed that up with a victory in a slow race at the IAAF World Cup. At the Seoul Olympics, Kariuki was mostly considered as the third-string Kenyan runner, but in the final, after a very fast start, Kariuki and his fellow countryman Peter Koech broke clear, and a lap later, Kariuki sped away from his more experienced teammate, and went on to win the gold medal. He slowed down in the last few metres and finished in a time of 8:05.51, just outside Henry Rono&#x27;s world record of 8:05.40.

In 1989, Kariuki won the 10,000 m at the Universiade and the 3000 m steeplechase again in the IAAF World Cup. In 1990, he won gold easily at the Commonwealth Games and finished fourth at the following year&#x27;s World Championships. Kariuki remained one of the world&#x27;s top steeplechasers for several more years after that, but the dominance of Kenyan talent was so great, that he was never able again to gain representation on the national team to a major international championship.

<text>St. Stephen&#x27;s Basilica ( ) is a Roman Catholic basilica in Budapest, Hungary. It is named in honour of Stephen, the first King of Hungary (c. 975â1038), whose right hand is housed in the reliquary. 

Since the renaming of the primatial see, it has been the co-cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Esztergom-Budapest. Today, it is the third largest church building in present-day Hungary. It is the largest church in Budapest and a significant historical landmark within the city&#x27;s UNESCO World Heritage Site Buffer Zone.

==History==
The site was the location of the Hetz-Theater, noted for hosting animal fights. JÃ¡nos Zitterbarth of the newly formed district built a temporary church there. In the late 1810s, about a thousand people formed the LipÃ³tvÃ¡ros Parish and began fundraising and making plans for the future church. During a devastating flood in 1838 the high ground here provided a measure of safe refuge to the residents, who, in thanksgiving, subsequently donated toward the construction of the church.

At first, the building was supposed to be named after Saint Leopold, the patron saint of Austria, but was later changed to honour Saint Stephen I of Hungary, the first King of Hungary (c. 975â1038), whose mummified right hand is housed in a reliquary. In 1931, Pope Pius XI awarded it the title of basilica minor; and served as the main venue for the 34th International Eucharistic Congress in May 1938.

Although the church suffered serious damage during World War II the cellar provided shelter for many refugees and a valuable collection of the Hungarian National Archives. 

== Architecture ==
The church was designed in neo-classical style by JÃ³zsef Hild. In 1858 the dome collapsed, which required complete demolition of the completed works and rebuilding from the ground up. Upon Hild&#x27;s death in 1867, the project passed to MiklÃ³s Ybl, who modified Hild&#x27;s initial plan to a more neo-Renaissance style. Construction commenced in 1851 and continued for fifty-four years. Work was completed in 1905 by JÃ³zsef Kauser. The keystone was placed in the presence of the Emperor Franz Joseph I.

Equal with the Hungarian Parliament Building, it is one of the two tallest buildings in Budapest at - this equation symbolises that worldly and spiritual thinking have the same importance. Regulations prohibited for a long period the construction of any building taller than in Budapest. It has a width of , and length of . 

The tympanum over the main entrance holds an 1893 mosaic designed by MÃ³r Than, &quot;Our Lord on the Throne with Angels&quot; by Salviati of Venice. On the main facade, below the tympanum, is an inscription of Christâs words: &quot;Ego Sum Via, Veritas et Vita&quot; (I am the way the truth and the life).

==Interior== 
The basilica has a Greek cross ground plan. 

In the lobby of the main entrance you can see the Saint Stephen&#x27;s relief of KÃ¡roly Senyei, and mosaics by Bertalan SzÃ©kely. The dome above the sanctuary shows the representation of the Lord God, and the tambourine shows Christ as well as the prophets and evangelists (built by KÃ¡roly Lotz). The sanctuary vault features allegories of the Holy Mass on mosaics by Gyula BenczÃºr and highlights the important stages of St. Stephen&#x27;s life in the bronze relief series by Ede Mayer. The canopy altarpiece designed by JÃ³zsef Kauser is decorated with the statue of St. Stephen by Alajos StrÃ³bl.

The pulpit is also work of JÃ³zsef Kauser. The glass painting works were made by Miksa RÃ³th, and the pipe organ of the church is the product of the factory of PÃ©cs and JÃ³zsef Angster recognized in the era. He carried out the painting and, in particular, the gilding of the interior decoration.

Other works of art inside the basilica (builders in parentheses):
==Present day==
Saint Stephen&#x27;s is the most important church building in Hungary, one of the most significant tourist attractions and the third highest church in Hungary. The dome can be accessed either by elevator or 364 steps for a panoramic view.

A Christmas fair is held in the square in front of the basilica during the Advent season, and at that time of the year the faÃ§ade is decorated with special light paintings in the evenings.

Part of the 2016 movie Inferno was filmed in St. Stephen Square in front of the basilica.

===Concerts in the basilica===
The Saint Stephen Basilica has played an active role in the musical community since its consecration in 1905. Organ concerts are performed in the basilica every Monday. The head organists of the church have always been very highly regarded musicians. 

In the past century the Basilica has been home to choral music, classical music as well as contemporary musical performances. The Basilica choir performs often in different parts of Europe as well as at home. In the summer months they perform every Sunday. During these months you can see performances from many distinguished Hungarian and foreign organ players alike.

One of the most famous Hungarian organists is MiklÃ³s Teleki;
along with AndrÃ¡s VirÃ¡gh, he is among some of the best organ players in Hungary. The concerts include arias, which are sung by Kolos KovÃ¡ts, one of the most famous concert and oratorio singers in Hungary; among numerous prizes, in 1992 he received also the highest prize Hungarian artists can acquire: the Kossuth Prize. The flute is played by EleonÃ³ra Krusic, who is already known for her performances with different orchestras, from Barcelona to ZÃ¼rich, Granz and Viena. These concerts take place on Thursday evenings and last a little over an hour. There are other performances available, such as the 15 minute &quot;mini concerts&quot; on Fridays, performed by AndrÃ¡s VirÃ¡gh.

== Bells of the basilica ==
The faÃ§ade is anchored by two large bell towers. In the southern tower is Hungary&#x27;s biggest bell, weighing over . Its predecessor had a weight of almost , but it was used for military purposes during World War II. 

The two towers have six bells altogether: five small bells in the north tower and a single bourdon in the south tower. The bourdon called the Great St. Stephan bell is the biggest bell in Hungary with its 9250 kilograms and its diameter of 252 centimeters. Usually it is used twice a year, at 5pm on August 20, which is the date it was consecrated while the four smaller bells were consecrated three years later on the same day. It also tolls at midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve and some special events when it tolls like the death of a Prime Minister or tragic events like the 9/11, but it is quite rare. The four smallest bells are founded in Passau in 1993. 

*Great St. Stephan bell:

The largest bell in the church and in Hungary. Located in the south tower, it weighs 9250Â kg and has a diameter of 240Â cm. It was made by the Perner bell foundry in Passau, Germany in 1990, this bell chimes the hour.

*Blessed Virgin Mary bell:

The 2nd largest and oldest bell in the church, founded by Ferenc Walser in 1863 in Pest. It weighs 3100Â kg and has a diameter of 178,5Â cm, this bell chimes the quarter hours and has a unique looking clapper. 

*St. Henry II. bell:

It weighs 2150Â kg and has a diameter of 150Â cm. 

*Blessed Gizella bell:

It weighs 1250Â kg and has a diameter of 117,8Â cm.

*Saint Emeric bell:

The 2nd smallest bell in the church, weighing 750 kg. 

*Saint ErzsÃ©bet (Elizabeth) from the House of ÃrpÃ¡d bell:
The smallest bell in the church, weighing 500 kg.

<text>Charles Adrian Scott Stokes (23 December 1854 â 30 November 1935) was an English landscape painter. Born in Southport, Lancashire, he became a cotton broker in Liverpool, where his artistic talent was noticed by John Herbert RA, who advised him to submit his drawings to the Royal Academy. He entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1872 and exhibited at the Academy from 1876.

==Biography==

From 1876, travelling to Fontainebleau and Barbizon, he came under the influence of French &quot;plein air&quot; landscape painters including Jules Bastien-Lepage. He also painted genre works and portraits influenced by Frederic Leighton, John Everett Millais and Parisians such as Pascal Dagnan-Bouveret.

In 1884, he married Austrian artist Marianne Preindlesberger (1855â1927). She became a well-known artist under her married name of Marianne Stokes. The couple spent the summers of 1885 and 1886 at Skagen in the far north of Denmark where there was an artists&#x27; colony which became known as the Skagen Painters. There they struck up a close friendship with Michael and Anna Ancher. After an extended stay in France, the couple returned to Britain where they settled in Cornwall at Carbis Bay and joining the artists&#x27; colony at St Ives in 1886. The couple travelled frequently to Tyrol and in 1905 to Slovakia. 
In 1905, the couple made their first visit to Hungary, returning in 1907 and 1908.

Adrian Stokes was a landscape painter, concerned most with atmospheric effects, and later with decorative landscapes. He was the author of &quot;Landscape Painting&quot; (1925). He became ARA in 1909 and RA in 1919, won medals at the Paris Exhibition and Chicago World Fair (1889), became first President of the St Ives Arts Club (1890) and became Vice President of the Royal Watercolour Society (1932).

Marianne Stokes died during 1927. Adrian Stokes died during 1935. Both were buried at Mortlake Roman Catholic Cemetery, London. An obituary of Adrian Stokes was published in &quot;The Times&quot; on 2 December 1935.

<doc id="1033922" wikidata="Q6288052" url="?curid=1033922" title="Joseph Wolff">
<text>Joseph Wolff (1795 â 2 May 1862) was a Messianic Jewish missionary born in Weilersbach, near Bamberg, Germany, named Wolff after his paternal grandfather. He travelled widely, and was known as &quot;the missionary to the world&quot;. He published several journals of his expeditions, including &quot;Travels and Adventures of Joseph Wolff&quot; (2Â vols, London, 1860).

==Early life==
Wolff was born to David Wolff (b. 1760) and his wife in 1795. David Wolff became a rabbi in Weilersbach in 1794, and also served in Kissingen, Halle upon Saale and Uehlfeld, moving to Jebenhausen, WÃ¼rttemberg in 1806, whence he sent his son to the Lutheran lyceum at Stuttgart.

Wolff&#x27;s initial interest in Christianity came about through hearing conversations between his father and Jewish friends, but since he was not happy with his father&#x27;s concept of Jesus, he began standing outside churches and listening to the sermons. In his writings (written in the third person), Wolff told about his early conviction that Jesus is the Messiah:

At the age of 11, a conversation with a Christian neighbour led to Wolff&#x27;s decision to leave home in order to find truth for himself, resulting in six years of travel, visiting various Christian establishments and learned theologians and teachers, including Christian Frederick of Stolberg-Wernigerode. He became a Roman Catholic near Prague in September 1812, taking on the name Joseph. Four years later, he arrived in Rome, where he began training as a missionary at the seminary of the Collegio Romano. His behaviour led to him being escorted from the Holy City in 1818 at night by gendarmes, for attacking the doctrine of infallibility and criticizing his tutors.

During his time in Rome, Wolff had met Henry Drummond, and he received an invitation from Drummond to join him in England. Through Drummond Wolff was introduced to Lewis Way, whose conviction that Christ&#x27;s Second Coming was imminent influenced him. He decided to become a member of the Church of England, following which Drummond and Way persuaded him toÂ train as a missionary at Cambridge University, at the expense of The London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews.

==Travels==
Soon after returning to England, Joseph accepted an invitation from Drummond and Way to join some of the most eminent Adventist thinkers of the time, including Edward Irving, at Drummond&#x27;s country estate, Albury Park, for the first of a series of conferences dedicated to the study of Biblical prophecy.

A year later, Joseph embarked on a search for the Lost Tribes of Israel and second missionary journey and to the east which lasted from 18271834, and involved visits to Anatolia, Armenia, Turkestan Afghanistan, Kashmir, Simla, Calcutta, Madras, Pondicherry, Tinnevelly, Goa and Bombay, returning via Egypt and Malta. It was during this journey that he mentioned his belief concerning the return of Christ,Â fixing on the year 1847. In Loodhiana, India, he &quot;preached extempore on the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;, and a year later in Madras, he was invited to lecture on &quot;the personal reign of Christ, and state his proofs for believing that Christ would come again upon the earth in 1847.&quot;Â Concerning the exact year, in 1852, Joseph&#x27;s good friend Sir Charles Napier reminded him that &quot;in 1827 you told me that the world would come to an end in 1845&quot;, and Joseph himself had once written in relation to his settling on 1847, that &quot;if now an opponent were to ask Wolff, &#x27;why did you fix that time&#x27;, he has but one answer to give, which he candidly gives to every one, &#x27;because I was a great ass&#x27;&quot;.

In 1836, he found Samuel Gobat in Ethiopia, who took him to Jeddah, and visited Yemen and Bombay. He continued to the United States, where he was ordained deacon on 26 September 1837 at Newark, New Jersey. Trinity College Dublin awarded him an honorary Doctorate of Laws. Wolff was ordained as a priest in 1838 by Richard Mant, Bishop of Down and Connor. In the same year, he was given the rectory of Linthwaite in Yorkshire.

In his travels in Bukhara, he found the doctrine of the Lord&#x27;s soon coming held by a remote and isolated people. The Arabs of Hodeyda, he says, &quot;are in possession of a book called &#x27;Seera,&#x27; which gives notice of the coming of Christ and His reign in glory, and they expect great events to take place in the year 1840&quot;. &quot;In Yemen I spent six days with the Rechabites. They drink no wine, plant no vineyards, sow no seed, live in tents, and remember the words of Jonadab, the son of Rechab. With them were the children of Israel of the tribe of Dan ... who expect, in common with the children of Rechab, the speedy arrival of the Messiah in the clouds of heaven.&quot;

In 1843 Wolff went to Bukhara (home of the Bukharan Jews) to seek two British officers, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Stoddart and Captain Arthur Conolly, who had been captured by the Emir, Nasrullah Khan in June 1842. He learned that they had been executed, and he was spared death himself only because the Emir laughed uncontrollably at Wolff&#x27;s appearance in full canonical garb. His &quot;Narrative&quot; of this mission sold well and was printed in seven editions between 1845 and 1852. Fitzroy Maclean, then a junior diplomat travelling incognito, retraced Wolff&#x27;s trip in 1938. He wrote of Wolff in his memoir, &quot;Eastern Approaches.&quot; Almost fifty years later, Maclean contributed a foreword to a biography of the missionary.

When Joseph arrived in Mashad in late August 1844 on his return from Bukhara he noted, &quot;It is remarkable that dissenters in doctrine are now prevailing largely in the Mohammadan religion&quot; and that &quot;there had arisen there another partly, who may be called the Mohammadan tractarians&quot;. At that time, the Shaykhi branch of Islam in Persia was experiencing a growing Adventist movement in parallel to that taking place in Christian circles in North America, Britain and Europe. According to Islamic prophecy the Promised Mahdi would appear in the year 1260, which is 1844 in the Gregorian calendar. It was in Shiraz, during May 1844, thatÂ Siyyid &#x27;AlÃ­ Muá¸¥ammad ShÃ­rÃ¡zÃ­ declared Himself to be the BÃ¡b, the Gate, the Promised Mahdi.

==Personal life and legacy==
He met his first wife in 1826 through Edward Irving, who introduced him to Lady Georgiana Mary Walpole, daughter of Horatio Walpole, 2nd Earl of Orford, and a descendant of Robert Walpole, the first Prime Minister of Great Britain; the couple were married on 26 February 1827.

In 1845, he was presented to the vicarage of Isle Brewers, Somerset. He raised the funds to rebuild All Saints Church, Isle Brewers by 1861. After the death of his first wife on 16 January 1859, in May 1861, he married Louisa Decima, daughter of James King, rector of St Peter le Poer, London. He was planning another great missions tour when he died at Isle Brewers on 2 May 1862.

A patron when he was a young man was the eccentric politician, Henry Drummond, a member of the Catholic Apostolic Church. Wolff named his son Henry Drummond Wolff; the boy grew up to be a noted diplomat and Conservative politician who founded the Primrose League.

<text>The Nebraska panhandle is an area in the western part of the state of Nebraska and one of several U.S. state panhandles, or elongated geographical regions that extend from their main political entity.

The Nebraska panhandle is two-thirds as high and a quarter as broad as the rest of the state is. It is approximately east to west and north to south. The Nebraska panhandle roughly encompasses the area in Nebraska between 102Â° and 104Â°W longitude and 41Â° and 43Â°N latitude. It comprises 11 counties with a combined land area of , or about 18.45 percent of the state&#x27;s land. Its population as of the 2010 Census was 87,789 inhabitants, or about 4.70 percent of the state&#x27;s population. Its largest city is Scottsbluff, in the west-central part of the area.

==Counties==
==Cities and towns==
Major cities in the Nebraska panhandle include:

*Alliance
*Chadron
*Kimball
*Scottsbluff - Gering
*Sidney
*Bridgeport
*Hemingford

==Population shifts==
As part of a general trend in migration from rural to metropolitan areas, most counties in the Nebraska panhandle have seen population decreases in recent decades; however, Scotts Bluff, Dawes, and Cheyenne counties increased their populations from the years 1990 to 2000 and again from 2000 to 2010. While emigration from the panhandle exceeds immigration, a study coordinated by the University of NebraskaâLincoln surveyed and interviewed a sample of newcomers to the region in order to understand their demographic makeup and reasons for relocation. Results indicated that immigrants to the Nebraska panhandle were on average younger and had higher average incomes and educational levels than other area residents; immigrants cited a &quot;simpler pace of life,&quot; reduced congestion, and lower costs of living among their reasons for relocation.

==Points of interest==
The Nebraska panhandle has a great deal of geographical and geological diversity; the region itself is made up of several smaller areas. Areas, features, and sites of interest in the Nebraska panhandle include:
*Agate Fossil Beds National Monument
*Carhenge
*Chadron State Park
*Sandhills
*Chimney Rock
*Fort Robinson
*Pine Ridge
*Rush Creek Ranch
*Toadstool Geologic Park
*Scotts Bluff National Monument
*Wildcat Hills
*North Platte River

The Nebraska panhandle borders the states of South Dakota, Wyoming and Colorado and is in the Mountain Time Zone.

<text>Samuel Gobat (26 January 1799 â 11 May 1879) was a Swiss Calvinist who became an Anglican missionary in Africa and was the Protestant Bishop of Jerusalem from 1846 until his death.

==Biography==
Samuel Gobat was born at CrÃ©mines, Canton of Bern, Switzerland, and baptised a member of the Reformed Churches of Bern-Solothurn. After serving in the Reformed at Bettingen from 1823 to 1826, he went to Paris and London, whence, having acquired some knowledge of Arabic and Ge&#x27;ez, he went out to Ethiopia under the auspices of the Anglican church with the Church Missionary Society.
In 1834 Gobat married Marie Christine Regine Zeller (1813â1879), daughter of Christian Heinrich Zeller (1779â1860), educator, pioneer of the inner mission and Pietist hymnologist. They had ten children, among them:
* Hanna Maria Sophie Gobat (1838â1922), married in 1859 Reverend John Zeller (1830â1902), missionary in Nazareth who later became the leader of the Gobat School in Jerusalem,
* Sophie Rosine Dorothea (&quot;Dora&quot;) Gobat (1842â1923), a missionary of St. Chrischona Pilgrim Mission, married in 1867 Carl Heinrich Rappard (1837â1909), missionary in Alexandria for the Pilgrim Mission, 
* Maria Sophie Elisabeth Gobat (1844â1917), married in 1869 the Swiss publisher Paul Kober, and 
* Blandina Marianne Gobat (1850â1926), married Theodor Friedrich Wolters (1837â1910), pastor in Smyrna, missionary in Nazareth and Jerusalem. 

His nephew was Charles Albert Gobat.

==Missionary career==

He visited Ethiopia twice, the first time from the beginning of 1830 to the end of 1832; returning to Europe, he took his wife Maria May, 1834. He then returned in March 1835, but his own ill health (he writes that he was confined to his bed, &quot;suffering cruel pains&quot;) forced him to return to Europe in 1836. His journal of his stay in Ethiopia (&quot;Sejour en Abyssinie&quot;) was published in 1835 at Paris, and later translated into English as &quot;Journal of Three Years&#x27; Residence in Abyssinia&quot;. From 1839 to 1842 lived in Malta, where he supervised an Arabic translation of the Bible. During this time he was a missionary of the Church Mission Society.

==Episcopate in Jerusalem==
In 1846 he was consecrated second Protestant bishop of Jerusalem, under the agreement between the British and Prussian governments (1841) for the establishment of a joint bishopric for Anglicans, Lutherans and Calvinists in the Holy Land, carried by the Anglican Church of England and the united Evangelical Church in Prussia. Gobat succeeded the late Bishop Michael Solomon Alexander. He carried on a vigorous mission as bishop for over thirty years, his diocesan school (so-called Bishop Gobat School, established 1847, now the Jerusalem University College) and orphanage on Mount Zion being specially noteworthy.

Unlike his predecessor Bishop Alexander, who preferred missioning Jews and Muslims, however, with the latter being forbidden to convert and to be missioned by Ottoman law, Gobat had resorted to proselytising among Christians of other, mostly Orthodox denominations. The Porte had legalised this by a Firman in 1850 issued under the pressure of the Protestant powers of Britain and Prussia. Such proselytism had been criticised by proponents of the Anglican High Church faction.
In order to support Gobat&#x27;s effort (*1806-1873*), one of the royal Prussian court preachers at the Supreme Parish and Collegiate Church in Berlin, co-founded , a charitable organisation on 2 December 1852, also becoming its first president. Gobat could found a number of charitable institutions with the help of funds raised by this Association. In the 1850s Gobat invited the Church Mission Society (CMS), of which he had previously been a missionary, to open Palestine as a field of mission, which they did.

In 1866 Gobat integrated the Jaffa Protestant mission of Peter Metzler, a missionary of St. Chrischona Pilgrim Mission, to Johannes Gruhler, the ordained Anglican pastor of Immanuel Church in Ramle. However, most Jaffa congregants disliked the Anglican Rite and preferred to attend Metzler&#x27;s services. In 1871 he consecrated Christ Church, Nazareth, built under the supervision of John Zeller, a German CMS missionary. He also ordained the first Arab clergy of the dioceseâMichael Ka&#x27;war and Seraphim Boutaji.

Gobat and his wife died in Jerusalem and are buried in Mount Zion Cemetery, there. A record of his life, largely autobiographical, was published at Basel in 1884, and an English translation at London in the same year. Gobat was succeeded by Bishop Joseph Barclay.

<doc id="1033935" wikidata="Q3409313" url="?curid=1033935" title="Economic forecasting">
<text>Economic forecasting is the process of making predictions about the economy. Forecasts can be carried out at a high level of aggregationâfor example for GDP, inflation, unemployment or the fiscal deficitâor at a more disaggregated level, for specific sectors of the economy or even specific firms. Economic forecasting is a measure to find out the future prosperity of a pattern of investment and is the key activity in economic analysis.
Many institutions engage in economic forecasting: national governments, banks and central banks, consultants and private sector entities such as think-tanks, and companies or international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and the OECD. A broad range of forecasts are collected and compiled by &quot;Consensus Economics&quot;. Some forecasts are produced annually, but many are updated more frequently.

The economist typically considers risks (i.e., events or conditions that can cause the result to vary from their initial estimates). These risks help illustrate the reasoning process used in arriving at the final forecast numbers. Economists typically use commentary along with data visualization tools such as tables and charts to communicate their forecast. In preparing economic forecasts a variety of information has been used in an attempt to increase the accuracy.

Everything from macroeconomic, microeconomic, market data from the future, machine-learning (artificial neural networks), and human behavioral studies have all been used to achieve better forecasts. Forecasts are used for a variety of purposes. Governments and businesses use economic forecasts to help them determine their strategy, multi-year plans, and budgets for the upcoming year. Stock market analysts use forecasts to help them estimate the valuation of a company and its stock.

Economists select which variables are important to the subject material under discussion. Economists may use statistical analysis of historical data to determine the apparent relationships between particular independent variables and their relationship to the dependent variable under study. For example, to what extent did changes in housing prices affect the net worth of the population overall in the past? This relationship can then be used to forecast the future. That is, if housing prices are expected to change in a particular way, what effect would that have on the future net worth of the population? Forecasts are generally based on sample data rather than a complete population, which introduces uncertainty. The economist conducts statistical tests and develops statistical models (often using regression analysis) to determine which relationships best describe or predict the behavior of the variables under study. Historical data and assumptions about the future are applied to the model in arriving at a forecast for particular variables.

==Sources of forecasts==
===Global scope===
The Economic Outlook is the OECD&#x27;s twice-yearly analysis of the major economic trends and prospects for the next two years. The IMF publishes the World Economic Outlook report twice annually, which provides comprehensive global coverage. The IMF and World Bank also produces Regional Economic Outlook for various parts of the world.

There are also private companies such as The Conference Board and Lombard Street Research that provide global economic forecasts.

As of April 2024, the World Trade Organization (WTO) projects a rebound in global merchandise trade, forecasting a growth of 2.6% for the year, and an anticipated increase to 3.3% in 2025, following a 1.2% decline in 2023. During 2023, there was a significant reduction in merchandise exports, which fell by 5% to US$ 24.01 trillion, contrasting sharply with the commercial services sector, which saw a 9% increase in exports to US$ 7.54 trillion. The global GDP is expected to stabilize, maintaining a growth rate of 2.6% in 2024 and 2.7% in 2025. From a regional perspective, Africa is forecasted to experience the highest export growth at 5.3% in 2024, closely followed by the CIS region at nearly the same rate. Moderate growth is expected in North America, the Middle East, and Asia, with rates projected at 3.6%, 3.5%, and 3.4%, respectively, while European exports are anticipated to grow by only 1.7%. Import growth will likely be robust in Asia (5.6%) and Africa (4.4%), with Europe showing almost no growth at 0.1%. Digital services trade remains resilient, reaching US$ 4.25 trillion in exports in 2023, and accounting for 13.8% of global exports of goods and services, with significant growth observed in Africa (13%) and South and Central America and the Caribbean (11%). Additionally, the WTO has launched the Global Services Trade Data Hub to provide detailed insights into the evolving landscape of services trade, with a particular focus on digitalization.

===U.S. forecasts===
The U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) publishes a report titled &quot;The Budget and Economic Outlook&quot; annually, which primarily covers the following ten-year period. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board of Governors members also give speeches, provide testimony, and issue reports throughout the year that cover the economic outlook. Regional Federal Reserve Banks, such as the St Louis Federal Reserve Bank also provide forecasts.

Large banks such as Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase provide economics reports and newsletters.

=== European forecasts ===
The European Commission also publishes comprehensive macroeconomic forecasts for its member countries on a quarterly basis - Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter.

===Combining Forecasts===
Forecasts from multiple sources may be arithmetically combined and the result is often referred to as a consensus forecast. Private firms, central banks, and government agencies publish a large volume of forecast information to meet the strong demand for economic forecast data. Consensus Economics compiles the macroeconomic forecasts prepared by a variety of forecasters, and publishes them on a weekly and monthly basis. &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine regularly provides such a snapshot as well, for a narrower range of countries and variables.

Econometric studies have demonstrated that the use of past errors of each original forecast to determine the weights assigned to each forecast in the creation of a combined forecast results in a composite set of forecasts that generally yield to lower mean-square errors compared to either of the individual original forecasts. However, it has been found that the entry and exit of forecasters can have a substantial impact on the real-time effectiveness of conventional combination methods. The dynamic nature of the forecasting combination and adjusting weighting techniques is not neutral.

==Forecast methods==
The process of economic forecasting is similar to data analysis and results in estimated values for key economic variables in the future. An economist applies the techniques of econometrics in their forecasting process. Typical steps may include:
#Scope: Key economic variables and topics for forecast commentary are determined based on the needs of the forecast audience.
#Literature review: Commentary from sources with summary-level perspective, such as the IMF, OECD, U.S. Federal Reserve, and CBO helps with identifying key economic trends, issues and risks. Such commentary can also help the forecaster with their own assumptions while also giving them other forecasts to compare against.
#Obtain data inputs: Historical data is gathered on key economic variables. This data is contained in print as well as electronic sources such as the FRED database or Eurostat, which allow users to query historical values for variables of interest. 
#Determine historical relationships: Historical data is used to determine the relationships between one or more independent variables and the dependent variable under study, often by using regression analysis.
#Model: Historical data inputs and assumptions are used to develop an econometric model. Models typically apply a computation to a series of inputs to generate an economic forecast for one or more variables.
#Report: The outputs of the model are included in reports that typically include information graphics and commentary to help the reader understand the forecast.

Forecasters may use computational general equilibrium models or dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. The latter are often used by central banks.

Methods of forecasting include Econometric models, Consensus forecasts, Economic base analysis, Shift-share analysis, Input-output model and the Grinold and Kroner Model. See also Land use forecasting, Reference class forecasting, Transportation planning and Calculating Demand Forecast Accuracy.

The World Bank provides a means for individuals and organizations to run their own simulations and forecasts using its &quot;iSimulate platform&quot;.

==Issues in forecasting==
===Forecast accuracy===

There are many studies on the subject of forecast accuracy. Accuracy is one of the main, if not the main, criteria used to judge forecast quality. Some of the references below relate to academic studies of forecast accuracy. Forecasting performance appears to be time-dependent, where some exogenous events affect forecast quality. As expert forecasts are generally better than market-based forecasts, forecast performance depends on several factors: model, political economy (terrorism), financial stability etc.

In early 2014 the OECD carried out a self-analysis of its projections. &quot;The OECD also found that it was too optimistic for countries that were most open to trade and foreign finance, that had the most tightly regulated markets and weak banking systems&quot; according to the Financial Times.

In 2012 Consensus Economics launched its Forecast Accuracy Award, and each year publishes a list of winners who have most accurately predicted the final outcome of GDP and CPI for the prior year for over 40 countries. &quot;Consensus Economics Forecast Accuracy Award&quot;

In recent years, research has demonstrated that behavioral biases play a significant role in affecting the accuracy of forecasts. The education and working experience of forecasters influence the accuracy and boldness of their predictions. Forecasting accuracy is also impacted by the forecaster&#x27;s experience with high inflation rates. Additionally, political events such as terrorism have been shown to influence the accuracy of both expert- and market-based forecasts of inflation and exchange rates. This highlights the range of external factors and biases that should be considered when evaluating the accuracy of forecasts and making informed decisions.

===Forecasts and the Great Recession===
The financial and economic crisis that erupted in 2007âarguably the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930sâwas not foreseen by most forecasters, though a number of analysts had been predicting it for some time (for example, Stephen Roach, Meredith Whitney, Gary Shilling, Peter Schiff, Marc Faber, Nouriel Roubini, Brooksley Born, and Robert Shiller). The failure of the majority of them to forecast the &quot;Great Recession&quot; caused soul searching in the profession. The UK&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth herself asked why had ânobodyâ noticed that the credit crunch was on its way, and a group of economistsâexperts from business, the City, its regulators, academia, and governmentâtried to explain in a letter.

It was not just forecasting the Great Recession, but also forecasting its impact where it was clear that economists struggled. 

For example, in Singapore Citi argued the country would experience &quot;the most severe recession in Singaporeâs history&quot;. The economy grew in 2009 by 3.1% and in 2010, the nation saw a 15.2% growth rate. Similarly, Nouriel Roubini predicted in January 2009 that oil prices would stay below $40 for all of 2009. By the end of 2009, however, oil prices were at $80. In March 2009, he predicted the S&amp;P 500 would fall below 600 that year, and possibly plummet to 200. It closed at over 1,115, up 24%, the largest single year gain since 2003. In 2009 he also predicted that the US government would take over and nationalize a number of large banks; it did not happen. In October 2009 he predicted that gold &quot;can go above $1,000, but it canât move up 20-30%â; he was wrong, as the price of gold rose over the next 18 months, breaking through the $1,000 barrier to over $1,400. Although in May 2010 he predicted a 20% decline in the stock market, the S&amp;P actually rose about 20% over the course of the next year (even excluding returns from dividends).

<doc id="1033937" wikidata="Q846186" url="?curid=1033937" title="2004 Pitcairn Islands sexual assault trial">
<text>In 2004, seven men living on Pitcairn Island faced 55 charges relating to sexual offences against children and young adults. The accused represented one-third of the island&#x27;s male population and included Steve Christian, the mayor. On 24 October, all but one of the defendants were found guilty on at least some of the charges. Another six men living abroad, including Shawn Christian, who later served as mayor of Pitcairn, were tried on 41 charges in a separate trial in Auckland, New Zealand, in 2005.

The trial was repeatedly punctuated by legal challenges from island residents, who denied the island&#x27;s colonial status, and with it the United Kingdom&#x27;s judicial authority. Defence lawyers for the seven accused men claimed that British sovereignty over the islands was unconstitutional: HMS &quot;Bounty&quot; mutineers, from whom almost all of the current island population is descended (together with Polynesians), had effectively renounced their British citizenship by committing a capital offence in the burning of the &quot;Bounty&quot; in 1790, they said. According to the Public Defender of the Pitcairn Islands Paul Dacre (who was appointed in 2003), islanders still celebrated this act annually by burning an effigy of the &quot;Bounty&quot; in a symbolic rejection of British rule. The defence maintained that the UK never made a &quot;formal&quot; claim to Pitcairn, and never officially informed the islanders that British legislation, such as the Sexual Offences Act 1956, was applicable to them.

In a judgment delivered on 18 April 2004, the Pitcairn Supreme Court (specially established for the purpose of the trial, consisting of New Zealand judges authorised by the British government) rejected the claim that Pitcairn was not British territory. This decision was upheld in August 2004 by the Pitcairn Court of Appeal, endorsing the claim of Deputy Governor Matthew Forbes that Pitcairn was British territory. A delay of the trial until the United Kingdom&#x27;s Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC) decided on an additional appeal was rejected. The trial started on 30 September 2004. Verdicts were delivered on 24 October 2004, with all but one of the defendants convicted on at least some of the charges they were facing. Those found guilty were sentenced on 29 October 2004.

==Historical background==
The remoteness of Pitcairn (which lies about halfway between New Zealand and Peru) had shielded the tiny population (47 in 2004) from outside scrutiny. The islanders had for many decades tolerated what others classify as sexual promiscuity, even among the very young, claimed to be in line with traditional values of their Polynesian ancestors. This included a corresponding tacit acceptance of behaviour which in the UK would be considered child sexual abuse. Three cases of imprisonment for sex with underage girls were reported in the 1950s.

In 1999 Gail Cox, a police officer from Kent, UK serving a temporary assignment on Pitcairn, began uncovering allegations of sexual abuse. When a 15-year-old girl decided to press rape charges in 1999, criminal proceedings (code-named &quot;Operation Unique&quot;) were set in motion. The charges include 21 counts of rape, 41 of indecent assault, and two of gross indecency with a child under 14. Over the following two years, police officers in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom interviewed every woman who had lived on Pitcairn in the past 20 years, as well as all of the accused men. Pitcairn Public Prosecutor Simon Moore (an Auckland Crown Solicitor who was the first lawyer appointed to the position by the British government for the purposes of the investigation) held the file.

Australian Seventh-day Adventist pastor Neville Tosen, who spent two years on Pitcairn around the turn of the millennium, said that on his arrival, he had been taken aback by the conduct of the children. But he had not immediately realised what was happening. &quot;I noticed worrying signs such as inexplicable mood swings,&quot; he said. &quot;It took me three months to realise they were being abused.&quot; Tosen tried to bring the matter before the Island Council (the legislative body which doubles as the island&#x27;s court), but was rebuffed, and told &quot;the age of consent has always been twelve and it doesn&#x27;t hurt them.&quot;

A study of island records confirmed anecdotal evidence that most girls bore their first child between the ages of 12 and 15. &quot;I think the girls were conditioned to accept that it was a man&#x27;s world and once they turned 12, they were eligible,&quot; Tosen said. Mothers and grandmothers were resigned to the situation, telling him that their own childhood experience had been the same; they regarded it as just a part of life on Pitcairn. One grandmother wondered what all the fuss was about. Tosen was convinced, however, that the early sexual experience was very damaging to the girls. &quot;They can&#x27;t settle or form solid relationships. They did suffer, no doubt about it,&quot; he said emphatically.

Tosen opined that accounts of the Pitcairners&#x27; past transformation by Christianity, once popularised in missionary tracts, told only one side of the story. He noted that 13 of the original settlers were murdered, many in fights over women, before John Adams, the sole surviving mutineer, pacified them with the help of the Bible. &quot;This is the island that the gospel changed, but the changes were only superficial,&quot; he said. &quot;Deep down, they adhered to the mutineers&#x27; mentality. They must have known that their lifestyle was unacceptable, but it was too entrenched.&quot;

In 1999, a New Zealander visiting the island, Ricky Quinn, was sentenced by island magistrate Jay Warren to 100 days in prison for underage sex with a 15-year-old Pitcairn girl.

In 2002, the Queen-in-Council made the Pitcairn (Amendment) Order 2002, which paved the way for a trial based on Pitcairn law to be held in New Zealand in 2004. However, in 2004 the accused won a legal battle to be tried in Pitcairn. Three judges, several prosecution and defence lawyers, other court staff, and six journalists travelled from New Zealand to the island in late September for the seven-week trial. Their arrival doubled the number of people on the island during their stay. Witnesses living abroad gave evidence remotely by a video satellite link-up.
The forty-five islanders were ordered to surrender their twenty or so guns, both in view of the heightened emotions and to avoid hunting accidents &quot;because the island&#x27;s population will swell by about 25 during the trial.&quot;

In 2004 the biographer Diana Souhami visited Pitcairn, attempting to travel incognito, but her cover was blown early in her stay. Before she was told to leave the island, she gathered enough material for her next book, &quot;Coconut Chaos&quot;.

As of April 2006, the cost of the trial amounted to NZ$14.1 million.

==Local reaction==
Pitcairn&#x27;s 47 inhabitants, almost all of whom are interrelated, were bitterly divided by the charges against what constituted most of the adult male population. Many Pitcairn Island men blamed the British police for persuading the women involved to press charges. Some of the women agreed. Sources close to the case said that several women withdrew their charges due to family pressure.

On 28 September 2004, Olive Christian, wife of the accused mayor, daughter of Len Brown and mother of Randy Christian, both of whom were also among those accused, called a meeting of thirteen of the island&#x27;s women, representing three generations at her home, Big Fence, to &quot;defend&quot; the island&#x27;s men. Claiming that underage sex had been accepted as a Polynesian tradition since the settlement of the island in 1790, Olive Christian said of her girlhood, &quot;We all thought sex was like food on the table.&quot; Carol Warren&#x27;s two daughters also said that they had both been sexually active from the age of 12, with one of them claiming that she started having sex at 13, &quot;and I felt hot shit about it, too.&quot; They and other women present at the meeting, who endorsed their view that underage sex was normal on Pitcairn, stated emphatically that all of the alleged rape victims had been willing participants.

Charlene Warren, who withdrew charges against a Pitcairn man, claimed that detectives had offered her money to testify; when pressed, she clarified that the money referred to statutory &quot;compensation for victims of crime.&quot; Some women came up with a conspiracy theory that the trial was part of &quot;a British plot to jail the [community&#x27;s] able-bodied men and &#x27;close&#x27; the island.&quot; &quot;They&#x27;ve picked on all the viable young men, the ones who are the backbone of this place,&quot; said one, Meralda Warren. Not all women on the island were such defenders. Some present at the Big Fence meeting sat &quot;silent and appeared ill at ease,&quot; giving reporters the impression that they did not hold the same views.

While many islanders were fearful that the outcome of the trial could sound the death-knell of the small country, others expressed optimism that it could mark a new beginning for Pitcairn as people previously excluded from the power structure would find themselves needed and appreciated for their skills and contributions. Many Pitcairners felt unfairly treated; for instance, Mike Warren said the whole trial was a &quot;setup&quot; from the start. Former Pitcairn resident Reeve Cooze told Radio New Zealand &quot;The Pitcairn people have been bullied&quot;.

==Timeline of the trial==
The trial opened on Pitcairn on 30 September.

Four days later on 4 October, a former islander, in a written statement read out by police, alleged that Mayor Steve Christian had raped her twice in 1972 when she was 12, once in bushland and once in a boat moored at Bounty Bay. She said that he used adolescent girls as his personal harem. &quot;Steve seemed to take it upon himself to initiate all the girls, and it was like we were his harem,&quot; she stated. She had not informed her parents or others in the community, she said, because she &quot;knew nothing would be done about it because of previous experience on the island.&quot; 

On 8 October, Dave Brown, brother-in-law to Mayor Steve Christian, pleaded guilty to two charges of indecently assaulting a 14-year-old girl in the mid-1980s, and to a charge of molesting a 15-year-old girl during a spear-fishing trip in 1986.

The court listened to an interview recorded on Pitcairn in 2000, in which Brown, when asked if he had been in love, replied to police: &quot;Yes, I was. We got closer and closer,&quot; was his view of himself and the 13-year-old girl, with whom he had repeated sexual contact over a long period in the mid-1980s. He was then in his early 30s, and married with children. Their first sexual encounter had taken place in undergrowth behind the general store after he met her in the village square. About a month later, they had sex again when they met after swimming. According to Brown&#x27;s account to police, after the second sexual encounter, the girl had said that she enjoyed the sexual encounters and wanted more of it. Seeing each other more than once a month was difficult, however; greater frequency would make it difficult to keep what Brown characterised as an &quot;affair&quot; secret. Despite being confronted by his wife, Lea, and despite being asked by the island&#x27;s police officer on behalf of the girl&#x27;s mother to leave her alone, Brown renewed his sexual contacts with the girl after a six-month interval. &quot;She didn&#x27;t want to let go and neither did I,&quot; Brown said. The sexual contact continued until the girl left the island at the age of 16. At the beginning of the police investigation in 2000, the woman was one of many complainants, but she withdrew her allegations against Brown before the trial.

In the video, Brown told the police that it was &quot;a normal part of Pitcairn life&quot; for adult men to have sex with girls of 12 or 13. &quot;It didn&#x27;t seem wrong,&quot; he said. Most islanders, including his parents, had started having sex at a young age, and each generation had followed the one before it, he contended. He said, however, that he had rethought the widespread acceptance of underage sex, and had concluded that it was not appropriate. Of his own conduct with the 13-year-old girl, he said, &quot;I regret it now. Times are changing. Things are moving forward, and obviously what we did then was not normal.&quot; 

Defence lawyers representing the seven accused presented their final submissions on 21 October. Much of the day was dominated by the defence of Randy Christian, the 30-year-old son of Mayor Steve Christian. The younger Christian was accused of five rapes and seven indecent assaults against four women between 1988 and 1999. He was also alleged to have targeted a five- or seven-year-old girl from 1989 or 1991 onwards and to have abused her continuously over the following decade. He admitted to having sex with an under-age girl of 11 or 12.

Defence lawyer Allan Roberts claimed that Christian&#x27;s relationship with the child had been consensual. The girl, who was 20 at the time of the trial, was the one who sparked off the police inquiry four years previously when she told her mother of the abuse she had suffered. Her mother in turn told Gail Cox, the visiting British police officer. That was the first the outside world knew of the prevalence of sexual abuse on Pitcairn. Roberts produced love letters written by the girl before Christian left Pitcairn for Norfolk Island, to support his claim that she had been infatuated with Christian. According to Roberts, this infatuation continued after Christian left the island. He said that in her statement to police, she confessed to &quot;having a crush on Randy even though he is no longer on the island.&quot;
He called her &quot;a cold and cruel and vengeful liar who would stop at nothing to draw attention back to herself ... a woman scorned,&quot; whose complaint to the police was nothing other than revenge for his having abandoned her.

Public prosecutor Simon Moore rejected this defence, charging that Christian had exploited their ten-year age gap and his superior physical strength for his own advantage. While admitting that for a girl to have a crush on an older man was nothing out of the ordinary, and that there were few unattached young men available, Moore maintained that Christian had taken advantage of the girl&#x27;s naivety, ignorance, and innocence. &quot;He flattered her, he played her and he lured her into situations where he could do as he wished,&quot; Moore said. He added that, after reading a leaflet about sexual harassment distributed by Constable Cox, the girl had realized that Christian&#x27;s treatment of her was unacceptable. The court was told that during the period in question, Christian had two girlfriends of legal age. One was a pest control officer who came to Pitcairn to rid the island of rats.

==Verdict and aftermath==
On 24 October 2004, the Pitcairn Supreme Court convicted six of the seven accused on 35 of the 55 charges. Only Jay Warren, the former Magistrate (1990â1999), was acquitted on all counts. See the &quot;defendants&quot; section below for details. Chief Justice Charles Blackie ridiculed Mayor Steve Christian&#x27;s claim that his relationship with one of his victims had been consensual. &quot;She was young, naive and vulnerable,&quot; Blackie said. &quot;She was secreted into the bushes and there the accused took advantage of her. There had been no affection, kissing or romantic connection. She did not want it to happen.&quot;

The controversy over the trial continued. On 26 October 2004, prosecutor Simon Moore told Radio New Zealand that the charges and the verdicts were only the tip of the iceberg, accounting for only one-third of the cases police learned about when they began their investigations. He said that more charges were due to be laid involving people now living in Australia and New Zealand, but he declined to provide further details citing &quot;extensive name suppression orders in place.&quot; Moore said that some of these victims had indicated an interest in returning to Pitcairn. But, they would have had to be satisfied that justice had been done and that the island was a safe place for their families.

Auckland lawyer Christopher Harder, who represented one of the accused, appealed for mercy in view of the social devastation he said would be caused by the imprisonment of most of the island&#x27;s able-bodied men. He proposed that the men make a public apology and pay compensation to their victims, instead of facing imprisonment, which, he said, could mean the end of the microstate.

Professor John Connell of the University of Sydney said that if the men were imprisoned, they would have to be released temporarily whenever needed to man the longboat, without which the island could not connect with the outside world. &quot;It would be a punishment for the whole community&quot; if they were not, said the South Pacific scholar. Some islanders expressed fears that without the convicted men, there would not be enough who could handle the longboat. Others, less connected with the case, noted that the defendants had prevented other islanders from becoming more skilled at handling the boats. This was another example of the &quot;power and control&quot; problems which existed on the island. Public Defender Paul Dacre called on the court to impose sentences in keeping with the unique circumstances of the island society. &quot;We are talking about 50 people living on a rock, not 50 million in England,&quot; he said.

Pending sentencing on 27 October, lawyers for the six convicted pleaded for clemency, arguing that it was essential for the survival of the dependency. Only two of the six expressed regret. Dennis Christian emailed his principal victim to apologise and expressed his &quot;deep remorse,&quot; the court was told, and Dave Brown made a statement through his lawyer that he &quot;regretted any distress caused.&quot; His father, Len Brown, refused to apologise for his own offences; his lawyer, Allan Roberts, told the court that to do so would be &quot;fraudulent.&quot;

The Pitcairn Supreme Court handed down sentences tailored, said Chief Justice Charles Blackie, to the unique conditions of Pitcairn Island, on 29 October. Dennis Christian and Dave Brown were sentenced to community service, apparently in recognition of the remorse they had shown at the trial.

Mayor Steve Christian, Randy Christian, and Len Brown were all sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to six years. (See the defendants for details.) Elaborating on Chief Justice Blackie&#x27;s statement, Bryan Nicholson of the British High Commission in New Zealand said, &quot;The penalties were tailored to Pitcairn and take into account the unique isolation, population of less than 50, and the dependence of manpower.&quot; None of the sentences were carried out until 2006, pending a ruling by the Privy Council on the legal validity of British sovereignty and judicial authority on Pitcairn.

Bryan Nicolson, a spokesman for the British High Commission in New Zealand, announced on 30 October that Governor Richard Fell had formally dismissed Steve Christian from the mayoralty, and his son, Randy, from the chairmanship of the powerful Internal Committee. The dismissal followed Christian&#x27;s refusal to resign when asked to do so by Deputy Governor Matthew Forbes. Christian&#x27;s conviction and dismissal left the islanders with a power vacuum. On 8 November 2004, the Island Council named Christian&#x27;s sister, Brenda, interim mayor pending elections scheduled for 15 December 2004. The position was won by Jay Warren.

Brian Michael John Young was found guilty in January 2007 of rape and indecent assault. In December, he was sentenced to six years and six months in prison. He was ordered to be transported to Pitcairn to serve out his sentence.

==Appeals==
The six convicts began their appeal in the Pitcairn Supreme Court, in Papakura, New Zealand, on 18 April 2005. Defence lawyers argued that as Pitcairn&#x27;s colonial rulers had never enforced British law, the six men convicted of sex crimes could not have known that their acts were illegal, a claim rejected as &quot;extraordinary&quot; by public prosecutor Simon Moore. If true, he said, Pitcairn had been &quot;a zone of criminal immunity&quot;, an enclave where serious crimes could be committed with impunity. The proceedings were relayed live to the Adamstown courthouse, on Pitcairn, by a video linkup. About twenty locals, including the accused, watched the hearing.

Crown prosecutors produced numerous old documents to refute the defence that British law had never been enforced on Pitcairn, or that the Pitcairners had never known that they were subject to it. According to the documents, the islanders had, over a period of many years, sought British advice and intervention in cases related to adultery, abortion, kleptomania, attempted murder (including a 1936 case in which a husband and wife tried to kill each other), and the theft of women&#x27;s underwear. Crown Prosecutor Simon Mount said the charges had been referred to British authorities because they were too serious to be dealt with locally, and proved that Pitcairners were fully aware of British law and of its applicability to them.

Betty Christian, the Island Secretary, broke ranks with many of her fellow Pitcairners, testifying at the Pitcairn Supreme Court hearing in Papakura that the islanders were aware that they were British subjects and that British law was applicable to them. She also flatly contradicted the defence that sexual activity at a young age was considered &quot;normal&quot; on Pitcairn, saying that Pitcairn&#x27;s values were no different from those of any other modern society.

On 24 May 2005, the Auckland court rejected the appeal of the six convicted men. It carried over their bail until their further appeal could be heard by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in 2006. Former Pitcairn resident Shawn Christian, 29, then living in Australia, announced a legal challenge to the validity of New Zealand lawyers&#x27; and judges&#x27; participation in a trial in a British colony on 27 November 2005. Christian appeared to have the support of others awaiting trial. Shawn Christian, whose alleged offences (three rapes) are said to have happened between 1994 and 1996, is the younger son of former Mayor Steve Christian.

An additional appeal brought by the Public Defender was heard by the Court of Appeal on 31 January 2006. The basis of the appeal was the validity of the laws applied to the accused, with the defence arguing that British law had not been ratified on Pitcairn. &quot;We are arguing whether the English legal system applies to these people. That is it in a nutshell,&quot; defence lawyer Allan Roberts said. The Pitcairn Court of Appeal dismissed this claim. Randall Christian&#x27;s appeal against conviction of indecent assault of a girl aged under 13 was upheld, but that decision did not affect his sentence of six years on other charges. The men appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London. The Privy Council terminated the appeal abruptly in July 2006, saying that the argument that Pitcairn has always been self-governing was unrealistic. The final appeals for all six men failed on 30 October 2006.

==Defendants==
The defendants who lived on the island were:

* Steven Raymond Christian (Steve Christian) (born January 1951), mayor since 1999. He was charged with a total of six rapes and four indecent assaults committed between 1964 and 1975. He pleaded not guilty to all charges of rape and sexual abuse. He admitted to two sexual encounters with underage females, which he said were consensual. Christian was convicted of five rapes, and cleared of four indecent assaults and one rape. He was sentenced to three years&#x27; imprisonment. Still protesting his innocence and refusing to resign, he was dismissed from office on 30 October 2004 by Governor Richard Fell.
* Randy Christian (born March 1974) son of Steve Christian, was Chairman of the powerful Internal Committee, which effectively made him his father&#x27;s deputy. He faced five charges of rape and seven of indecent assault against four women between 1988 and 1999. He was also accused of targeting one girl from the age of five or seven, abusing her repeatedly over the next decade. He admitted to having under-age sex with a girl of 11 or 12. He was convicted of four rapes (against the same girl from the age of 10) and five indecent assault charges, but cleared of one rape and two indecent assaults. His six-year prison sentence was the most severe ever handed down on Pitcairn. Governor Fell dismissed him from the chairmanship of the Internal Committee on 30 October 2004, following his refusal to resign.
* Len Carlyle Brown (born March 1926) Steve Christian&#x27;s father-in-law, was convicted of two rapes. Through his lawyer, Allan Roberts, Brown refused to apologize. To do so would be &quot;fraudulent,&quot; Roberts said. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment, but on account of his age, he was allowed to apply for home detention instead.
* Dave Brown, or Len Calvin Davis Brown (born October 1954) son of Len Brown, pleaded guilty on 8 October 2004 to two charges of indecent assault against a 14-year-old girl and one charge of molesting a 15-year-old girl. He continued to deny 12 other charges, including one of forcing a 5-year-old girl to give him oral sex. Brown was found guilty of nine indecent assaults against three girls, but was cleared of four charges of indecent assault and two of gross indecency. Earlier, he had told British journalist Kathy Marks that he hated reporters and was sick of their &quot;lies.&quot; After the verdict, however, his lawyer, Charles Cato, told the court that Brown &quot;regretted any distress caused.&quot; He was sentenced to 400 hours&#x27; community service and was ordered to undergo counselling.
* Dennis Ray Christian (born 1957) pleaded guilty on 5 October 2004 to two charges of sexual assault and one of indecent assault against young girls. The court was told on 27 October 2004 that Christian had e-mailed his principal victim to apologize and express his &quot;deep remorse.&quot; He was sentenced to 300 hours&#x27; community service and was ordered to undergo counselling.
* Carlisle Terry Young (born 1958) a descendant of HMS &quot;Bounty&quot; midshipman Ned Young, faced one charge of rape and seven of indecent assault over a period of almost 20 years. He was convicted of one rape and six indecent assaults, but was cleared of one indecent assault charge. Young was sentenced to five years imprisonment. He resented being photographed at the trial, and shoved reporter Kathy Marks aside when she tried to take his picture.
* Jay Warren (born July 1956) former magistrate of the Pitcairn Islands from 1990 to 1999, when his office was replaced by that of the mayor following a constitutional revision. Warren was cleared of his indecent assault charge.

<text>Major General Christopher Michael Maltby, (13 January 1891 â 6 September 1980) was a senior officer in the British Indian Army who served as Commander of British Troops in Hong Kong in 1941 before the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong, after which he became a prisoner of war.

==Military career==
Educated at Bedford School, Maltby attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from where he was commissioned onto the Unattached List For Indian Army, with a view to an appointment to the Indian Army.

After passing his probationary year attached to a British Army regiment stationed in India, he was posted to the
95th Russell&#x27;s Infantry of the Indian Army. From 1913 to 1914, he served in the Persian Gulf.

In October 1914, the 95th Russell&#x27;s Infantry were sent to reinforce the British garrison in Muscat, as information had been received that the Imam and many local tribal leaders intended to attack.

It was while based here that 95th Russell&#x27;s Infantry took part in operations across the Straits of Hormuz, at Jask and Chahbar in Persia, during April and May 1915. It was during these operations that Maltby was awarded a Military Cross for gallantry displayed when defending the British post at Chabhar on the night of 2 May 1915.

Later in the year the 95th Russell&#x27;s Infantry returned to India and by October 1916 were stationed at Nowshera. While at Nowshera, to mobilize as part of the Peshawar Division on 1 October 1916. A few days later it left for Peshawar from where it was engaged in minor punitive columns on the North West Frontier until July 1917 when it was ordered to Saugor to mobilise for overseas service.

On 29 September 1917, the battalion landed at Basra; and after about a year in Mesopotamia it was despatched in November 1918 to Turkey.

In addition to being awarded the Military Cross, was wounded and thrice mentioned in dispatches.

With the war over, he then went to the Staff College in Quetta in 1923. He served on the North West Frontier in India and then became a general staff officer at Army Headquarters in India in 1925. He went on to the RAF Staff College at Andover in 1927 and then was appointed Deputy Assistant Adjutant General at Army Headquarters in India in 1930.

He was appointed to command the 3rd battalion, 9th Jat regiment on 1 February 1937, which in October 1937 moved to Landi Kotal on the North West Frontier of India and took part in the operations during 1937, for which he was again Mentioned in Despatches.

He was appointed an instructor at the Staff College at Quetta from June to December 1938 before being appointed a General Staff Officer, grade 1, Baluchistan District in India in January 1939.

He served in the Second World War. On 24 September 1939, he was appointed Commander of 3rd Jhelum Brigade, then as Commander of the Calcutta Brigade, and finally as Commander of 19th Indian Infantry Brigade in Deccan District in India.

He was made Commander of British Troops in China in August 1941. He was unimpressed when he assumed the post on 19 July 1941. In his first letter to his wife upon arrival, he wrote, &quot;the Governor is a very sick man and only wants to go quietly, and there is still a tremendous lot to be done on the civil defence side, so I am afraid my start must be demanding things. Why must one always have to fight the civil administration?&quot; Meanwhile, the Hong Kong sappers impressed Maltby during the ceremony on 1 August so much that he proposed to the War Office to raise a âChinese infantry battalionâ with the prospect of âfurther expansionâ on 8 August. The War Office approved the proposal on 24 August; it was the beginning of the first locally raised Hong Kong infantry unit in the British Army, the Hong Kong Chinese Regiment.

He initially established a 10-mile line of defence known as Gin Drinkers Line across the Southern part of the mainland but was rapidly forced to withdraw his troops back to Hong Kong Island. General Takashi Sakai began a bombardment of the Island and, after a brief counter-attack by British Troops which commenced on 19 December 1941, Maltby surrendered to the Japanese at Queen&#x27;s Pier on 25 December 1941. He was a prisoner of war from 1941 to 1945.

==Retirement==
Reverting to his permanent rank of colonel, Maltby retired on 10 June 1946. He was granted the honorary rank of major-general on 10 June 1946. In 1953, Maltby was granted a commission as a Deputy lieutenant of Somerset, where he spent his remaining years, the last five of them a widower.

<doc id="1033944" wikidata="Q762583" url="?curid=1033944" title="Catarrh">
<text>Catarrh ( ) is an inflammation of mucous membranes in one of the airways or cavities of the body, usually with reference to the throat and paranasal sinuses. It can result in a thick exudate of mucus and white blood cells caused by the swelling of the mucous membranes in the head in response to an infection. It is a symptom usually associated with the common cold, pharyngitis, and chesty coughs, but it can also be found in patients with adenoiditis, otitis media, sinusitis or tonsillitis. The phlegm produced by catarrh may either discharge or cause a blockage that may become chronic.

The word &quot;catarrh&quot; was widely used in medicine since before the era of medical science, which explains why it has various senses and in older texts may be synonymous with, or vaguely indistinguishable from, common cold, nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, or sinusitis. The word is no longer as widely used in American medical practice, mostly because more precise words are available for any particular disease. Indeed, to the extent that it is still used, it is no longer viewed nosologically as a disease entity but instead as a symptom, a sign, or a syndrome of both. The term &quot;catarrh&quot; is found in medical sources from the United Kingdom. The word has also been common in the folk medicine of Appalachia, where medicinal plants have been used to treat the inflammation and drainage associated with the condition.

== Clinical relevance ==
Because of the human ear&#x27;s function of regulating the pressure within the head region, catarrh blockage may also cause discomfort during changes in atmospheric pressure.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;catarrh&quot; comes from 15th-century French &quot;catarrhe&quot;, Latin catarrhus, and Greek (&quot;katarrhein&quot;): &quot;kata-&quot; meaning &quot;down&quot; and &quot;rhein&quot; meaning &quot;to flow.&quot; The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; quotes Thomas Bowes&#x27; translation of Pierre de la Primaudaye&#x27;s &quot;The [second part of the] French academic&quot; (1594): &quot;Sodainely choked by catarrhs, which like to floods of waters, runner downwards.&quot;

<doc id="1033948" wikidata="Q63689" url="?curid=1033948" title="Joanna Kerns">
<text>Joanna Kerns is an American actress and director best known for her role as Maggie Seaver on the ABC sitcom &quot;Growing Pains&quot; from 1985 to 1992. 

==Early life==
Kerns was born Joanna Crussie DeVarona in San Francisco, California. Her older sister is Olympic swimmer Donna de Varona and her aunt was silent film actress Miriam Cooper.

Kerns competed in the Olympic trials in 1968 and ranked 14th out of 28.

==Career==

===Early roles===
Kerns got her start in show business as a dancer before turning to acting. She attended UCLA and majored in dance. There, she saw an advertisement for a Gene Kelly production called &quot;Clown Around&quot; and applied for an audition. To take the part, however, she would have to drop out of college and move to New York, which she did. After &quot;Clown Around&quot;, Joanna also got parts in the New York Shakespeare Festival&#x27;s production of &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; and &quot;Ulysses in Nighttown&quot;, where she was directed by Burgess Meredith.

Meredith also introduced Kerns to Peggy Feury, under whom Kerns studied acting. In 1972, she moved back to California and landed a job as a backup dancer at Disneyland, and started auditioning for TV commercials and steady acting jobs.

On May 4, 1977, she made an appearance on &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; as Natalie, a worker at a massage parlor in the episode &quot;The Blue Angels&quot;.

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Kerns started making a name for herself in guest spots on many televisions shows that included: &quot;Emergency!&quot;, &quot;CHiPs&quot;, &quot;The A-Team&quot;, &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, &quot;Street Hawk&quot;, &quot;Laverne and Shirley&quot;, &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, and &quot;V&quot;, as well as many commercials. During an interview, Kerns said, &quot;I kind of was always looking for the next thing; I auditioned for anything, hoping to get a big break&quot; (Lifetime&#x27;s &quot;Intimate Portrait&quot;). Then, Kerns got her first steady acting job in 1983, starring as Pat Devon in a new CBS series called &quot;The Four Seasons&quot;, which lasted only one season. The sitcom, which was based on a 1981 movie of the same name, was about three couples who all lived under the same roof in California. Although the show was not well received by television critics, her part proved to producers that she was capable of acting as a leading lady.

===&quot;Growing Pains&quot;===
Soon after the cancellation of &quot;The Four Seasons&quot;, Kerns auditioned with Alan Thicke for a new family sitcom called &quot;Growing Pains&quot;. Kerns joked in interviews that Alan and she had immediate chemistry, especially when she kissed him on his nose by accident during their audition together. Kerns and Thicke&#x27;s chemistry won them both the parts, and the two became great friends off the show. The successful show, which dealt with two working parents raising their kids, ran on ABC from 1985-1992. Kerns reprised her role in two reunion TV movies, &quot;The Growing Pains Movie&quot; (2000) and &quot;Growing Pains: Return of the Seavers&quot; (2004).

During the success of &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, Kerns began to star in television movies, where she played controversial parts very different from the beloved all-American mom, Maggie Seaver. One such performance that shocked audiences was her 1992 movie, &quot;The Nightman&quot;, in which Kerns played a highly sexual business woman who was a motel owner. Her many TV movies include: &quot;Those She Left Behind&quot;, &quot;Blind Faith&quot;, &quot;The Big One: The Great Los Angeles Earthquake&quot;, &quot;Shameful Secrets&quot;, and &quot;No One Could Protect Her&quot;.

===After &quot;Growing Pains&quot; roles and directing career===
After &quot;Growing Pains&quot; ended, Kerns turned to directing. She directed one episode of &quot;Growing Pains&quot; while starring on the show and got hooked. In an interview, Kerns stated, &quot;Directing is where I&#x27;ve always wanted to go&quot;. She loved directing and decided to change the focus of her career from acting to directing, while continuing to make rare appearances in front of the camera when the right parts came along. She has also directed episodes of television shows including &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Titans&quot;, &quot;Scrubs&quot;, &quot;Private Practice&quot;, &quot;Psych&quot;, &quot;Felicity&quot;, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;Privileged&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Ghost Whisperer,&quot; &quot;Army Wives&quot;, &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot;, &quot;Switched at Birth&quot;, &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, &quot;This Is Us&quot;, and &quot;Fuller House&quot;. Kerns also directed Annie Potts in an original made-for-television movie for Lifetime TV entitled: &quot;Defending Our Kids: The Julie Posey Story&quot;. She has since made a number of shorts, and directed the sixth episode of &quot;Pitch&quot;, a sports drama on Fox.

Kerns has also made notable appearances in feature films, including &quot;A*P*E&quot; (1976), &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; (1999), and the comedy &quot;Knocked Up&quot; (2007).

She has also co-founded the Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards given to women in acting.

Kerns was a member of the Motion Picture and Television Fund Board of Trustees from 2004 through 2008.

==Personal life==
In 1974, Kerns met a commercial producer, Richard Kerns, on the set of a commercial, and they married two years later. Their marriage lasted nine years and the couple had a daughter, Ashley Cooper. In 1994, Kerns married Marc Appleton, a prominent Los Angeles architect. In August 2019, Kerns filed for divorce from Appleton.

Kerns dated comedian and actor Freddie Prinze a short time before he committed suicide. The two had worked together on the 1976 TV movie, &quot;The Million Dollar Rip-Off&quot;.

In 2004, Kerns wrote a letter of support for convicted sex offender Brian Peck, who had worked on the set of &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, before his sentencing in the case. Peck had been found guilty of sexually abusing a minor. Kerns stated in her letter of support for Peck that there must have been &quot;temptation exerted upon him&quot;. In March 2024, following the release of the documentary &quot;Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV&quot;, which discussed Kerns&#x27; letter of support for Peck, Kerns stated, &quot;Knowing what I know now, I never would have written [the letter].&quot;

In 2016, Kerns underwent a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with breast cancer, specifically a ductal carcinoma in situ.

She has raised funds for Planned Parenthood.

<text>Joshua Andrew Koenig (; August 17, 1968Â â February 16, 2010) was an American character actor, film director, editor, writer, and human rights activist. He was known for his role as Richard &quot;Boner&quot; Stabone in &quot;Growing Pains&quot;.

==Early life==
Andrew Koenig was born August 17, 1968, the son of &quot;Star Trek&quot; actor Walter Koenig and Judy Levitt. He was Jewish.

Writer Harlan Ellison spoke of the young Koenig as being the inspiration for his story &quot;Jeffty Is Five&quot;.

The story went on to win the 1977 Nebula Award and the 1978 Hugo Award for Best Short Story.

==Career==
From 1985 to 1989, Koenig played a recurring role as Richard &quot;Boner&quot; Stabone, best friend to Kirk Cameron&#x27;s character Mike Seaver in the first four seasons of the ABC sitcom &quot;Growing Pains&quot;. During the same period, he guest starred on episodes of the sitcoms &quot;My Sister Sam&quot; and &quot;My Two Dads&quot; as well as the drama &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;. In the early 1990s he provided a voice for the animated series &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; as Ambush and Night Creeper Leader, and had a minor role as Tumak in the 1993 &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Sanctuary&quot;.

Koenig played the role of The Joker in the 2003 fan film &quot;&quot;.

Onstage, he played the Page Boy in the eight performances of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot;, a production of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Carlo Maria Giulini at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, California, in April 1982. As an adult, he starred as the M.C. in the 2007 interactive theater play &quot;The Boomerang Kid&quot; and performed with the improv group Charles Whitman Reilly and Friends.

Though he continued his performing career in the 2006 independent film &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot; (2006), Koenig worked increasingly behind the scenes. He wrote, produced and/or directed the shorts &quot;Good Boy&quot; (2003) and &quot;Woman in a Green Dress&quot; and &quot;Instinct vs. Reason&quot; (2004). He worked as an editor on a number of films and was a video producer for the podcast &quot;Never Not Funny&quot; (2006â2010). His final role was in the film &quot;DaZe: Vol. TooÂ â NonSeNse&quot;, in post-production at the time of his death, with Koenig portraying the role of Vice Chancellor.

==Personal life==
Koenig was an important part of the nonviolent direct action community in Venice Beach that focused on environmental protection during the 1990s. Koenig, a vegan, traveled to Burma in July 2007 and visited Burmese refugee camps in Thailand with his father as part of the U.S. Campaign for Burma. The following January, he protested the Communist Party of China&#x27;s political and financial support of the military dictatorship in Burma during the 119th Tournament of Roses in Pasadena, California; after a pre-parade human rights march agreed to by parade officials was allegedly stifled by them, he entered the parade and stood in front of a Chinese float promoting the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Koenig, who carried a sign reading &quot;China: Free Burma&quot; in both English and Chinese, was arrested and briefly held for his act of civil disobedience. Koenig&#x27;s defense attorney was Bill Paparian, a fellow protester and former mayor of Pasadena.

&quot;China sits on the UN Security Council and they have refused to condemn Burma. China purchases gas from Burma and sells them weapons that the military uses on the Burmese people. So they are really quite complicit, and that was the whole point of protesting the China float,&quot; Koenig explained. Koenig also noted the Chinese government&#x27;s implicit support of the genocide in Sudan, sweatshops and tainted export products, saying of the float, &quot;China is putting on a good face because of the Olympics, but [it&#x27;s time to] send a message to the Chinese government that they have to not just change their face, but change the way they do things.&quot; &quot;The Pasadena Weekly&quot; quoted Koenig as stating, &quot;Their free speech rights have been totally censored. As a country with a Constitution and a Bill of Rights, we need to continue to support and enforce ours, and [use it to] recognize the rights of human beings all over the world&quot;.

===Death===
Koenig was last seen in Vancouver, British Columbia, on February 14, 2010, and missed a scheduled flight on February 16, which was the last day he used his cell phone or conducted any banking. On February 25, a group of friends and family found him dead in Vancouver&#x27;s Stanley Park; he had apparently hanged himself.

<doc id="1033965" wikidata="Q561053" url="?curid=1033965" title="Roy Buchanan">
<text>Leroy &quot;Roy&quot; Buchanan (September 23, 1939 â August 14, 1988) was an American guitarist and blues rock musician. A pioneer of the Telecaster sound, Buchanan worked as a sideman and as a solo artist, with two gold albums early in his career and two later solo albums that made it to the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. He never achieved stardom, but is considered a highly influential guitar player. &quot;Guitar Player&quot; praised him as having one of the &quot;50 Greatest Tones of All Time.&quot; He appeared on the PBS music program &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; in 1977 (season 2).

==Biography==
===Birth and early career: 1939â1960===
Leroy Buchanan was born in Ozark, Arkansas, and was raised there and in Pixley, California, a farming area between Visalia and Bakersfield. His father was a sharecropper in Arkansas and a farm laborer in California. Buchanan told interviewers the fiction that his father was a fiddle-playing preacher, which was repeated in &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine but disputed by his older brother J.D. Buchanan told how his first musical memories were of racially mixed revival meetings he attended with his mother, Minnie. &quot;Gospel,&quot; he recalled, &quot;that&#x27;s how I first got into black music.&quot; He in fact drew upon many disparate influences while learning to play the guitar (though he later claimed his aptitude derived from being &quot;half-wolf&quot;). He initially showed talent on steel guitar before switching to guitar in the early 50s, and started his professional career at age 15, in Johnny Otis&#x27;s rhythm and blues revue.

In 1958, Buchanan made his recording debut with Chicago&#x27;s Chess Records at age 19, accompanying Dale Hawkins by playing the solo on &quot;My Babe. Two years later, during a tour through Toronto, Buchanan left Dale Hawkins to play for Hawkins&#x27;s cousin Ronnie Hawkins and tutor Ronnie&#x27;s guitar player, Robbie Robertson. Buchanan plays bass on the Ronnie Hawkins single &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot;. Buchanan soon returned to the United States, and members of the Ronnie Hawkins&#x27; group later gained fame as the roots rock group the Band. In the early 1960s, Buchanan often played as a sideman with various rock bands, and he played guitar in recording sessions with Freddy Cannon, Merle Kilgore, and others. At the end of the 1960s, with a growing family, Buchanan left the music industry to learn a trade and trained as a barber.

===Recording career: 1961â1988===
In 1961 he released &quot;Mule Train Stomp&quot;, his first single for Swan, featuring rich guitar tones. Buchanan&#x27;s 1962 recording with drummer Bobby Gregg, nicknamed &quot;Potato Peeler,&quot; first introduced the trademark Buchanan &quot;pinch&quot; harmonic. An effort to cash in on the British Invasion caught Buchanan with the British Walkers. In the mid-1960s, Buchanan settled down in the Washington, D.C., area, playing for Danny Denver&#x27;s band for many years while acquiring a reputation as &quot;...one of the very finest rock guitarists around.&quot; The facts behind that claim are that in March 1968 a photographer friend, John Gossage gave Buchanan tickets to a concert by the Jimi Hendrix Experience at the Washington Hilton. &quot;Buchanan was dismayed to find his own trademark sounds, like the wah-wah that he&#x27;d painstakingly produced with his hands and his Telecaster, created by electronic pedals. He could never attempt Hendrix&#x27;s stage show, and this realization refocused him on his own quintessentially American roots-style guitar picking.&quot;

Gossage recalls how Roy was very impressed by the Hendrix 1967 debut album &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot;, which was why he made sure to give Roy a ticket to the early show at the Hilton. Gossage went backstage to take photos and tried to convince Jimi to go and see Roy at the Silver Dollar that night after the show, but Jimi seemed more interested in hanging out with the young lady who was backstage with him. Hendrix never showed up at the Silver Dollar, but Gossage did talk to Roy about seeing the Hilton show. That same night (as the Hilton show) Roy did several Hendrix numbers and &quot;from that point on, had nothing but good things to say about Hendrix&quot;. He later released recordings of the Hendrix composition &quot;If 6 Was 9&quot; and the Hendrix hit &quot;Hey Joe&quot; (written by Billy Roberts and first recorded by The Leaves). In the early 1970s he performed in the Washington, D.C.âMarylandâVirginia area with the Danny Denver Band, which had a following in the area. Buchanan was also popular as a solo act in the D.C. area at this time.

Buchanan&#x27;s life changed in 1971, when he gained national notice as the result of an hour-long PBS television documentary. Entitled &quot;Introducing Roy Buchanan,&quot; and sometimes mistakenly called &quot;The Best Unknown Guitarist in the World&quot;, it earned a record deal with Polydor Records and praise from John Lennon and Merle Haggard, besides an alleged invitation to join the Rolling Stones which he turned down and which gave him the nickname &quot;the man who turned the Stones down&quot;. He may have turned the Stones down for two reasons. He may have feared abusing drugs and alcohol more if he joined them, and dying, like Brian Jones. And he may have felt that his own career as he was then pursuing it had promising directions that he could not follow as well if he joined the Stones. In 1977, he appeared on the PBS music program &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; during Season 2. He recorded five albums for Polydor, one of which, &quot;Second Album&quot;, went gold, and after that another three for Atlantic Records, one of which, 1977&#x27;s &quot;Loading Zone&quot;, also went gold. Buchanan quit recording in 1981, vowing never to enter a studio again unless he could record his own music his own way. Four years later, Alligator Records coaxed Buchanan back into the studio.

His first album for Alligator, &quot;When a Guitar Plays the Blues&quot;, was released in the spring of 1985. It was the first time he had total artistic freedom in the studio. His second Alligator LP, &quot;Dancing on the Edge&quot; (with vocals on three tracks by Delbert McClinton), was released in the fall of 1986. He released the twelfth and last album of his career, &quot;Hot Wires&quot;, in 1987. Buchanan&#x27;s last show was on August 7, 1988, at Guilford Fairgrounds in Guilford, Connecticut.

===Death===

According to his agent and others, Buchanan was doing well, having gained control of his drinking habit and playing again, when he was arrested for public intoxication after a domestic dispute. He was found hanged from his own shirt in a jail cell on August 14, 1988, in the Fairfax County, Virginia, Jail. According to Thomas Hartman, who was in a cell near Buchanan&#x27;s, the deputy sheriff opened the door early in the morning and found Buchanan with the shirt around his neck. His cause of death was officially recorded as suicide, a finding disputed by Buchanan&#x27;s friends and family. One of his friends, Marc Fisher, reported seeing Roy&#x27;s body with bruises on the head.

After his death, compilation and other albums continue to be released, including in 2004 the never-released first album he recorded for Polydor, &quot;The Prophet&quot;. Roy Buchanan is interred at Columbia Gardens Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.

==Equipment==
Buchanan used a number of guitars in his career, although he was most often associated with a 1953 Fender Telecaster, serial number 2324, nicknamed &quot;Nancy.&quot; At some point &quot;Nancy&quot; had jumbo frets installed, but remained largely original. There are two very different stories explaining how Buchanan got the guitar. He himself said that, while enrolled in 1969 in a school to learn to be a hairdresser, he ran after a guy walking down the street with that guitar, and bought him a purple Telecaster to trade. Buchanan also owned a Butterscotch Blonde 1952 Fender Telecaster that eventually wound up in the possession of Wishbone Ash guitarist Andy Powell. A friend of Buchanan&#x27;s, however, said that Buchanan was playing a Gibson Les Paul at the time, and traded it for the &#x27;53 Tele. One of Buchanan&#x27;s Telecasters was later owned by Danny Gatton and Mike Stern, who lost it in a robbery. He was reported using a 1956 Gibson Les Paul Goldtop Reissue for some time. Early in 1979 he switched to a 1975 sunburst Fender Stratocaster for a few years. Also, he used to play a Gibson L-5 CES when he was very young.

==Tone and technique==
Buchanan played the Telecaster through a Fender Vibrolux
amplifier with the volume and tone &quot;full out,&quot; and used the guitar&#x27;s volume and tone controls to control volume and sound (he achieved a wah wah effect using the tone control). To achieve his desired distorted sounds, Buchanan at one point used a razor blade to slit the paper cones of the speakers in his amp, an approach also employed by the Kinks&#x27; Dave Davies and others. Buchanan rarely used effects pedals, though he started using an Echoplex on &quot;A Street Called Straight&quot; (1976). In his later career he played with a Boss DD-2 delay.

Buchanan taught himself various playing techniques, including &quot;chicken picking&quot;. He sometimes used his thumb nail rather than a plectrum, and also employed it to augment his index finger and pick. Holding the pick between his thumb and forefinger, Buchanan also plucked the string and simultaneously touched it lightly with the lower edge of his thumb at one of the harmonic nodes, thus suppressing lower overtones and emphasising the harmonic, sometimes referred to as pinch harmonics, though Buchanan called it an &quot;overtone.&quot; Buchanan could play harmonics at will, and could mute individual strings with free right-hand fingers while picking or pinching others. He was famous as well for his oblique bends.

This was particularly notable in his approach to using double and triple stops.

==Legacy==
Buchanan has influenced many guitarists, including Robbie Robertson, Gary Moore, Danny Gatton, Arlen Roth, Jeff Beck, David Gilmour, Jerry Garcia, Mick Ronson, Nils Lofgren, Jim Campilongo, and Steve Kimock; Beck dedicated his version of &quot;Cause We&#x27;ve Ended As Lovers&quot; from &quot;Blow by Blow&quot; to him. His work is said to &quot;stretch the limits of the electric guitar,&quot; and he is praised for &quot;his subtlety of tone and the breadth of his knowledge, from the blackest of blues to moaning R&amp;B and clean, concise, bone-deep rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&quot;

In 2004, &quot;Guitar Player&quot; listed his version of &quot;Sweet Dreams,&quot; from his debut album on Polydor, &quot;Roy Buchanan&quot;, as having one of the &quot;50 Greatest Tones of All Time.&quot; In the same year, the readers of &quot;Guitar Player&quot; voted Buchanan number 46 in a top 50 readers&#x27; poll.

<text>The Profit Impact of Market Strategy (PIMS) program is a project that uses empirical data to try to determine which business strategies make the difference between success and failure. It is used to develop strategies for resource allocation and marketing. Some of the most important strategic metrics are market share, product quality, investment intensity, and service quality (all measured by PIMS and strongly correlated with financial performance). One of the emphasized principles is that the same factors work identically across different industries.

== History ==

The PIMS project was originally initiated by senior managers of General Electric who wanted to know why some of their business units were more profitable than others. Under the direction of Sidney Schoeffler, an Economics professor hired by GE for the purpose, the PIMS project was launched in the 1960s as an internal empirical study. The aim was to make GE&#x27;s different strategic business units (SBUs) comparable.

Since GE was highly diversified at the time, key factors were sought that would have an impact on economic success regardless of the product. In particular, the return on investment (ROI), i.e. the profit per unit of tied capital, was used as the measure of success. In 1972, the project was transferred to the Marketing Sciences Institute (then under the wing of Harvard Business School, which extended it to other companies. In 1976, the American Strategic Planning Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, took charge of the project. 

Between 1970 and 1983, roughly 2600 strategic business units (SBUs) from around 200 companies took part in the surveys and provided key figures for the project. Today there are around 12,570 observations for 4200 SBUs. PIMS Associates in London has been the worldwide competence and design center for PIMS since the 1990s and has been part of Malik Management (Fredmund Malik) in St. Gallen (Switzerland) since 2005.

The PIMS project analyses the data they had gathered to identify the options, problems, resources and opportunities faced by each SBU. Based on the spread of each business across different industries, it was hoped that the data could be drawn upon to provide other businesses, in the same industry, with empirical evidence of which strategies lead to increased profitability. The database continues to be updated and drawn upon by academics and companies today.

The PIMS databases currently comprise over 25,000 years of business experience at the SBU level (i.e. where the customer interface takes place and where marketing and investment decisions are made). Each SBU is characterized by hundreds of factors over a period of 3+ years, including the market share of itself and its competitors, customer preference, relative prices, service quality, innovation rate, vertical integration, etc., as well as a number of market luring factors and fairly detailed income statement, balance sheet and employee data.

== Data collected ==

In the PIMS study, more than 50 different core metrics were regularly surveyed. The most important of these are presented below: 

Characteristics of the business environment (market attractiveness):
* (Short/long-term) market growth
* Market size
* Distribution channels (direct, wholesale, retail, etc.)
* Customer characteristics (purchase amount, frequency, importance, etc.)
* Inflation (materials and energy, labor costs, prices)
* Position in product life cycle

Competitive strength:
* Relative market share (compared to the 3 largest competitors)
* Relative innovation rate and product line breadth
* Location cost advantage
* Relative marketing effort (salesforce, advertising, promotion)
* Relative market coverage
* Relative product quality
* Characteristics of the service provision

Supply chain fitness:
* Investment intensity (= investment volume / turnover)
* Extent of vertical integration versus outsourcing
* Labor productivity
* Capacity utilization
* Investment mix (fixed vs working capital)
* Lean overheads
* Marketing intensity (= marketing expenditure / sales)
* Research and development intensity (= research and development expenses / sales)

Dynamics of change
* Changes in competitive strengths 
* Changes in supply chain fitness

Economic success factors (as variables to be explained):
* Return on investment (ROI) (= profit / tied capital)
* Return on sales (ROS) (= profit / sales)
* Real growth

While most of the variables appear obvious, PIMS has the advantage of providing empirical data that defines quantitative relationships and attributes them to what some would consider reasonable.

== Participation in the PIMS study: cost and benefits ==

Companies wishing to use the service will provide detailed information, for each of their main strategic business units including:
* Market and customer structure
* Competitive strengths and weaknesses
* Income statement and balance sheet
* Existing market projections and business plans.

Based on the data provided, PIMS provides four reports (Lancaster, Massingham and Ashford):

# A &quot;par&quot; report - shows the expected profitability for this business profile â and why that differs from an average business
# A &quot;strategic analysis&quot; report, which calculates the predicted consequences using several alternative strategic measures. It takes into account information from companies operating in a comparable business environment and facing a similar starting point.
# A &quot;Report on Look-Alikes&quot; (ROLA), which aims to understand why each SBU&#x27;s performance is above or below âparâ by analyzing income statements and balance sheets of strategically similar businesses in more detail.
# An &quot;Optimal Strategy&quot; report aims to predict the best combination of strategies for the company, based on the experience of other companies in &quot;similar&quot; circumstances which some would consider reasonable.

== Results==

The following factors correlate particularly strongly with the ROI and ROS success factors:

Investment intensity correlates negatively (explains approx. 15 %):

On the one hand, this has the formal-analytical reason that with increasing investment intensity, i.e. the investment volume in relation to sales, the depreciation volume in relation to sales, the depreciation intensity, also increases and thus the profit decreases. On the other hand, if the investment intensity is high, the fixed assets increase and there is an urge to also use these capacities, i.e. to increase the output volume and under certain circumstances to lower the prices and thus the profit margin.

Relative market share correlates positively (explains approx. 12 %):

The main reason for the positive influence of the relative market share is the economies of scale: The higher the market share, the larger the production volume and the lower the unit costs; this can also be explained by the experience curve. Moreover, as the market share increases, so does the power vis-Ã -vis the suppliers, which means that better conditions can be achieved.

Relative product quality correlates positively (explains approx. 10 %):

Important reasons for the positive correlation are above all higher achievable prices for premium products, but also the higher willingness of consumers to buy high-quality services, so that the sales volume increases and thus positively influences the market share (see above).
Another reason is the lower complaint costs.

Overall, the factors surveyed explain about 70 percent of the differences in profitability between successful and unsuccessful business areas in the PIMS database (measured as variance).

== Commentary about PIMS ==

It can be argued that a database operating on information gathered in the period 1970â1983 is outdated. However, data continues to be collected from participating companies and PIMS argues that it provides a unique source of time-series data, the conclusions from which have proven to be very stable over time.

It has also been suggested that PIMS is too heavily biased towards traditional such as car manufacturing; this is perhaps not surprising, considering the era in which the majority of the surveys were carried out. However, as of 2006, the 3,800+ businesses contained within the database include data from the consumer, industrial and service sectors.

It is also heavily weighted towards large companies, at the expense of small entrepreneurial firms. This resulted from the data collection method used. Generally, only larger firms are prepared to pay the consulting fee, provide the survey data, and in return have access to the database in which they can compare their business with other large businesses or SBUs. Mintzberg (1998) claims that because the database is dominated by large established firms, it is more suitable as a technique for assessing the state of &quot;being there rather than getting there&quot;. (page 99) This criticism is very important because if one is trying to get &quot;average&quot; results across industries to give us the &quot;laws of the marketplace&quot;, a dubious enterprise as it is, the sampling strategy is important if one wants to obtain results that are representative.

â &quot;The PIMS master database at the heart of the PIMS program now includes more than 25,000 years of business experience across a broad spectrum of industries worldwide. These are more than 90% of the companies to be processed. About one-third of them manufacture consumer goods, 15% manufacture capital goods. The remaining business units are suppliers of raw materials and semi-finished products, components or accessories for industry and commerce. Trade and services companies account for less than 10% of total companies and yet represent a fairly large sample (over 250) of strategic business units in this category. About&quot; &quot;half of the business units in the PIMS database market their products or services nationally in the United States or Canada, while 11% serve regional markets in North America. European companies are also numerous today, with around 1,000 business units from continental European countries and 600 from the UK.&quot; 

The most important criticism leveled at PIMS is the fact that causation implies correlation but correlation does not imply causation. One of the most important &quot;findings&quot; of the PIMS program was to find a statistically significant relationship between profitability and market share (see Buzz ell and Gale (1987)). The empirical work conducted by PIMS suggested that high market share yielded high profitability, but this correlation cannot be considered a &quot;true&quot; causal relationship because correlation does not imply causation. In the multivariate correlation analysis, high market share was associated with high profits, but high profits could have been associated with high market share, or a third factor common to both could have caused the correlation. Many analysts believe that it is possible to use a statistical causality test to determine causation, but if the whole problem is that correlation is insufficient to determine causation in the first place, then how can using another correlation, which is what is used in the tests, determine causation.

â &quot;In connection with the market share, already indicated and frequent allegations that correlations are used in the PIMS investigations to draw conclusions about causal relationships, i.e. correlation is equated with causality. However, this problem is too obvious not to have been examined in detail during the development of the PIMS program. Backhaus et al. formulate this aptly: &quot;The primary field of application of regression analysis is the investigation of causal relationships (cause-effect relationships), which we can also refer to as &quot;The more the&quot; relationships&quot;. Backhaus et al. (2006), p. 46 (Emphasis in the original.) These authors then add the following: &quot;It should be emphasized here that neither regression analysis nor other statistical methods can prove causalities beyond doubt. Rather, regression analysis can only prove correlations between variables. This is a necessary but not yet sufficient condition for causality.&quot; Backhaus et al. (2006), p.48 f. Within the framework of the PIMS studies, it was thus possible to determine causalities with the help of time series analyses due to the availability of data over longer periods. See, for example, Barylite (1994), p. 61. Correlations in this sense, including in the PIMS program, initially give nothing other than a reason to investigate possible causalities substantiated and intensively.&quot;&quot; Causation cannot be investigated by statistical methods. Granger causality utilizes time series methods to examine statistical causation. However, both regression analysis and granger causality rely on correlations between variables. Correlation is not sufficient to determine causation.

Another important criticism of PIMS is that it does not take into account heterogeneity in the data set. The presumption of PIMS analysis is that the same &quot;laws of the marketplace&quot; apply to all industries. However, the statistical assumptions employed in the econometric analysis make the assumption that all cross-sectional observations come from one statistical distribution that is the same for all cross-sectional observations. This tends to be the Achilles heel of virtually all cross-sectional analyses. If this homogeneous assumption is false, then cross-sectional observations are being drawn from different populations. While one can use estimation techniques such as fixed-effects to control for different population means, co-variances can also differ across populations (meaning behavior differs across populations) and the only way one can control for this aspect is to run regressions on each population separately. This means that the &quot;laws of the marketplace&quot; differ across populations, directly contradicting one of the main presumptions of using the PIMS data base for analysis.

Telis and Golder (1996) claim that PIMS defines markets too narrowly. Respondents described their market very narrowly to give the appearance of high market share. They believe that this self reporting bias makes the conclusions suspect. They are also concerned that no defunct companies were included, leading to &quot;survivor bias&quot;.

<text>The Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS), commonly known as the Flying Doctor, is an air medical service in Australia. It is a non-profit organisation that provides emergency and primary health care services for those living in rural, remote and regional areas of Australia who cannot access a hospital or general practice due to the vast distances of the Outback.

==History==
===&quot;Mantle of safety&quot;===

John Flynn had worked in rural and remote areas of Victoria and was commissioned by the Presbyterian Church to look at the needs of people living in the outback. His report to the Presbyterian Assembly in 1912 resulted in the establishment of the Australian Inland Mission (AIM), of which he was appointed Superintendent. In 1928, he formed the AIM Aerial Medical Service, a one-year experiment based in Cloncurry, Queensland. This experiment later became The Royal Flying Doctor Service.

Flynn&#x27;s missionary work involved the establishment of hospitals in bush communities, but this did not help those who lived far from any major community. In his public speaking he would often retell the tragic circumstances that had befallen several bush settlers. The fate of Jimmy Darcy, in 1917, was one of these stories.
==== Jimmy Darcy ====
:Darcy was a stockman at Ruby Plains, a remote cattle station in Western Australia. After being found injured with a ruptured bladder by some friends, he was transported over 30 miles (12 hours), to the nearest town, Halls Creek. Here, Darcy was met by FW Tuckett, the Postmaster, and the only man in the settlement trained in first aid. Tuckett said there was nothing he could reliably do for injuries so serious, and tried unsuccessfully to contact doctors at Wyndham, and then Derby, by telegraph. He eventually got through to a doctor in Perth. Through communication by morse code, Dr. Holland guided Tuckett through two rather messy bladder operations using the only sharp instrument available, a pen knife. Due to the total absence of any medical facilities, Darcy had been operated on strapped to the Post Office counter, having first been made insensible with whisky. Holland then travelled 10 days to Halls Creek on a boat for cattle transport, a Model T Ford, a horse-drawn carriage, and even on foot, only to find that Darcy had died the day before. The operations had been successful, but the stockman had died from an undiagnosed case of malaria and a ruptured abscess in his appendix.
It was from stories such as this that Flynn, and his following at the AIM, became inspired to develop a route of communications that could solve the problem of remoteness, but no feasible technology seemed apparent.

===Flight and radio: the fusion of two fledgling technologies===

Victorian pilot Lieutenant (John) Clifford Peel had heard Flynn&#x27;s public speeches, and on being shipped out to France for World War I in 1917, sent Flynn a letter explaining how he had seen a missionary doctor visiting isolated patients using a plane. Assisted by costing estimates by Peel, Flynn immediately took the idea of using aircraft to begin his idea, and published Peel&#x27;s idea in the church&#x27;s newsletter. Peel died in combat in September 1918, probably not even knowing the impact he had in the creation of an Australian icon.

Along with motorised flight, another new technology was being developed that could replace the complicated means of communication by telegraph. Together with Alfred Traeger, Flynn began experiments with radio in the mid-1920s to enable remote outposts to contact a centralised medical base. The pedal radio was the first result of this collaboration. These were distributed gradually to stations, missions and other human residences around Cloncurry, the base site for a 50-watt transmitter.

Experimental aerial medical services commenced in 1926 and an injured miner was transported by air from Mount Isa to Cloncurry in November 1927.

By 1928, Flynn had gathered sufficient funds through fundraising activities to launch the experiment of the AMS on 15 May. Its supporters included industrialist HV McKay, medical doctor George Simpson and Hudson Fysh, one of the founders of Qantas. Qantas supplied the first aircraft to the fledgling organisation, VH-UER a De Havilland DH.50, dubbed &quot;Victory&quot;. On 17 May 1928, two days after inception, the service&#x27;s first official flight piloted by Arthur Affleck departed from Cloncurry, 85 miles to Julia Creek in Central Queensland, where the plane was met by over 100 people at the airstrip. Qantas charged two shillings per mile for use of the Victory during the first year of the project.

===Continued success===
Within the first year of operations, the service flew approximately 20,000 miles in 50 flights, becoming the first comprehensive air ambulance service in the world. The service persisted through difficult first years, dealing with postwar Australia and the Great Depression of the 1930s. During its first few decades the service relied heavily on community fundraising, volunteer support and donations. Nowadays, the service is supported by the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments, but still relies heavily on fundraising and donations from the community to purchase and medically equip its aircraft, and to finance other major capital initiatives. Until the 1960s the service predominantly hired aircraft, pilots and service technicians from contractors. After this point, the service moved on to purchasing its own equipment and employing its own pilots and mechanics.

In 1932, the success from its operations in Cloncurry, and the increasing public awareness to this vital rural service, resulted in a push for a national network of flying doctors, hopefully with sponsorship from the government. In 1934 this was realised with the new Australian Aerial Medical Service opening up &quot;Sections&quot; across the nation. Bases were set up in Wyndham, Port Hedland, Kalgoorlie, Broken Hill, Alice Springs and Meekatharra. The Queensland experiment was expanded with two additional bases opening in Charters Towers and Charleville. An official Federal Council for the organisation was formed in 1936. In 1937, Dr Jean White became the first female flying doctor in Australia, and the world, when she started work at Normanton. In 1942 the service was again renamed as the Flying Doctor Service, with Royal being bestowed upon the service in 1955. On 22 October 1958, Holden car manufacturers donated its 500,000th vehicle to the service in Melbourne.

Sister Myra Blanch was one of the first nurses, known as &quot;Flying Sisters&quot;, to join the service. She was key in the New South Wales Section operations during the 1940s and 50s, even though Flying Nurses didn&#x27;t actually become regular until the 1960s. Many patient transports are conducted with an RFDS nurse and pilot only on board. Nurses have been responsible for many innovations to the service, including an addition to the RFDS medical chest to incorporate a &quot;body chart&quot; (1951). The chart was an anatomical representation of a human being, with areas clearly numbered. With such a chart, a remote doctor can ask the patient &quot;where is the pain felt?&quot; and receive a comprehensible reply. The medicines contained in the chest are similarly numbered for ease in communicating medical instructions.
The service is still heavily reliant on community support for funding, particularly through events such as the Simpson Desert Bike Challenge, and is well respected across the country as an organisation that has contributed much to rural, regional and remote communities.

Its services include:

* EmergencyÂ â primary aeromedical response to accident or illness
* Emergency â secondary aeromedical evacuation and medical retrieval services
* Non-Emergency Transport - by aeromedical and road ambulances
* TelehealthÂ â 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, medical consultation services by radio, telephone or video call
* Primary health care clinicsÂ â the transportation of a general practitioner for regular clinical visits to remote areas (often a circuit visiting several communities and/or stations). Clinics include general practice, nursing services, child and maternal health, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, Rural Women&#x27;s GP Service, mental health, dental services, allied health and medical specialists.
* Consultation, communication, and support for rural and remote doctors across Australia
* Inter-hospital transfer of patients
* Education and training opportunities and midwifery scholarships

The service also uses not just aircraft but also four-wheel drives and other utility land vehicles to aid in transportation and communications.

===Organisation===
The RFDS is made up of seven legal entitiesÂ â RFDS of Australia, Central Operations, Queensland Section, South Eastern Section, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Operations. The RFDS operates in a federated structure and each of the seven entities has its own Board and Management. Each entity operates independently, both financially and operationally.

The Flying Doctor operates from numerous bases, health services and other facilities (including marketing, fundraising and public relations as well as the national office) across Australia.

RFDS bases are operated by:
*Central OperationsÂ â with bases at Adelaide Airport, Alice Springs Airport and Port Augusta Airport, and health services at Andamooka, Marla and Marree.
*South Eastern SectionÂ â Broken Hill, New South Wales; Dubbo, New South Wales; Launceston, Tasmania; Essendon Airport; and Sydney Airport and Bankstown Airport in Sydney.
*Victoria OperationsÂ - bases across the state, including Essendon Airport; and a fleet of more than 100 road ambulances operating from more than 20 rural and regional bases. The Victorian Section office is in Richmond, an inner eastern suburb of Melbourne.
*Queensland SectionÂ â Brisbane Airport, Bundaberg Airport, Cairns Airport, Roma Airport, Charleville, Longreach, Mount Isa, Rockhampton and Townsville Airport
*Western OperationsÂ â Broome, Kalgoorlie, Meekatharra, Perth&#x27;s Jandakot Airport,and Port Hedland. The Rio Tinto LifeFlight Pilatus PC-24 jets are located in Broome and Jandakot.

Bases at Carnarvon, Geraldton, Derby, and Wyndham have closed, while the original base at Cloncurry was moved to Mount Isa in 1965 and the early base at Charters Towers moved to Cairns in 1972. The most recent new base was opened in Broome in 2016.

===Aircraft===
The first aircraft operated by the &quot;Aerial Medical Service&quot; in 1928 was a de Havilland DH.50 hired from the fledgling Qantas. It was replaced in 1934 by a DH.83 Fox Moth.

During the 1930s and 1940s the fleet consisted of a mix of de Havilland DH.50s, DH.83 Fox Moths, DH.84 Dragons, DH.104 Doves and the de Havilland Australia DHA-3 Drover.

From the 1950s to 1970s, the fleet included the Beechcraft Baron, Beechcraft Travel Air, Beechcraft Queen Air, Beechcraft Duke, Cessna 180, Cessna 182, Cessna 421, Piper Cherokee and Piper PA-31 Navajo.
Aircraft were provided by contractors until the 1960s. Subsequently, the RFDS owned its own aircraft and employed its own pilots and engineers.

In the late 60s the NSW Section operated two British built Beagle B.206 Mk2 until replaced in the late 70s when the RFDS base at Broken Hill operated the Australian-made GAF Nomad.

From the 1980s to the 2000s, the fleet included the Cessna 404 and Cessna 441.

For a time in the mid-2000s the aeromedical evacuation aircraft used were either the Pilatus PC-12 or the Beechcraft King Air 200 series. The internal configuration of these two aircraft varies in the different RFDS sections. Typically they are configured with two rear-facing seats which look onto two stretchers. In some aircraft, one stretcher can be removed quickly and two seats slipped into place instead.

The PC-12, PC-24 and King Air are pressurised and so can safely transport patients who would not otherwise tolerate the decreased air pressure in a in non-pressurised aircraft. The internal cabin pressure can be maintained throughout the flight at that of sea level. This is important for patients critically sensitive to pressure changes. Also, pressurised aircraft can fly at high enough altitude to be above turbulent weather. This is of great benefit in providing an environment safe for the patient and staff, and also limits complications of aeromedical transport such as motion sickness and exacerbation of injuries such as unstable fractures.

In October 2009 the standardisation on the two aircraft types ended when two Cessna 208B Grand Caravans and a Hawker 800XP joined the fleet.

The South Eastern Section operates 18 King Airs (B200, B200C, B300C); The Queensland Section operates 20 King Airs (B200, B200C, B300C) and 3 PC-12s; The Western Operations operates 16 PC-12s and 3 PC-24; and Central Operations operates 19 PC-12 and 2 PC-24.&lt;ref name=&quot;rfd-anrep-2015/16&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2021, the RFDS had received their 4 Pilatus PC-24 jets, replacing their Hawker 800XP jet. They are based at Jandakot Airport and Broome in WA and Adelaide SA. The PC-24 can fit 3 stretcher beds and two seated patients. The aircraft can cruise at and halves the time of flight compared to the existing propeller driven fleet. The PC-24 can also operate out of paved and unpaved runways.

In 2022, The Western Operations started operating its own helicopters. Two Airbus EC145 were imported from Germany and reconfigured at Jandakot Airport into hospital retrieval platforms. The aircraft are operated single pilot IFR with NVIS (NVG). The service provides retrievals up to from Perth, landing in sports ovals or helipads. Patients are then flown directly to rooftop helipads located on all the major hospitals in Perth.

===Medical retrieval equipment===
The RFDS uses a wide range of contemporary emergency medical equipment to provide aeromedical retrieval services. These include transport ventilators, critical care monitors, infusion devices, point-of-care testing, portable diagnostic ultrasound and a range of other splints and devices.

===Statistics===
According to the RFDS of Australia 2015/16 Annual Report the service owns 67 aircraft, and operates 23 bases with 1,225 employees.
Each day, on average, the service:
* travels 73,554 kilometres by air
* performs 211 landings
* has 800 patient contacts (includes patients at clinics, patient transports and telehealth)
* transports 177 patients (includes primary evacuations, inter-hospital transfer, transports from clinics, repatriations and road transports by Victoria Mobile Patient Care Service)
* conducts 254 telehealth sessions.

===School of the Air===

The School of the Air, which links outback students with centralised teachers, until recently used the same radio equipment as the RFDS. This has been superseded with the availability of internet services.

== Notable people ==
Notable people associated with the RFDS include:
* Arthur Affleck, first pilot/doctor 
* Marie Bashir, former NSW Governor, official patron

== Cultural references ==
* The RFDS was the subject of the TV drama series &quot;The Flying Doctors&quot;. The series followed the lives of an RFDS crew based in a fictional township called &quot;Coopers Crossing&quot; (set in the real-life town of Minyip in north-western rural Victoria) and the members of the local population that they served.
* &quot;RFDS: Royal Flying Doctor Service&quot; is an Australian drama television series which centres around the lives of workers for the Royal Flying Doctors Service. It commenced airing on the Seven Network in 2021.
* In the 1950s the RFDS featured in a BBC Radio series &quot;The Flying Doctor&quot;, which became well known for the catchphrase &quot;Flying Doctor calling Wollumboola Base&quot;. A television show of the same title based on this radio series and starring Richard Denning ran on the British ITV network for one season (1959â60).
* At the closing of Charlie Drake&#x27;s humorous song &quot;My Boomerang Won&#x27;t Come Back&quot;, it is implied that the narrator accidentally downs a Flying Doctor plane with his boomerang.
*The Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia is featured in the outback map of the video game &quot;Flight Control&quot;.
*The British space rock group Hawklords released a song called &quot;Flying Doctor&quot; on their album &quot;25 Years On&quot; (1978). It describes an Australian flying doctor who has a drug cabinet key.
* In the television series &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;, Season 22 introduces Isla, a plane in service to the RFDS, who is good friends with Shane, the Australian engine Thomas first met back in the special &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends: The Great Race&quot;. The episode &quot;Cyclone Thomas&quot; has Isla shown flying to various medical emergencies with her on-board doctor, Dr. Claire, and attempting to help evacuate residents from a town threatened by a hurricane.
* Air Hawk and the Flying Doctors was a long-running cartoon that featured the service.

== Heritage listings ==
The First and Second Australian Inland Mission Hospitals in Birdsville are listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.

In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Royal Flying Doctor Service was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as an iconic &quot;innovation and invention&quot;.

In 2011 the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia (Queensland Section) was inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame in recognition of its contribution to rural health and rural community building in Australia.

<text>The Travel Air Manufacturing Company was an aircraft manufacturer established in Wichita, Kansas, United States in January 1925 by Clyde Cessna, Walter Beech, and Lloyd Stearman.

An early leader in single-engine, light-aircraft manufacturing, from 1925 to 1931, Travel Air was the largest-volume aircraft manufacturer in the United States in 1928 -- the principal contributor to Wichita becoming named the &quot;Air Capital City&quot; by the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce.

Travel Air produced the trend-setting Travel Air &quot;Mystery Ship&quot; racer, which forced radical changes in U.S. military aircraft. Travel Air also developed early small airliners, including Delta Airlines&#x27; first, and the first civilian plane to reach Hawaii by air.

With Walter Beech as its last President, the company was acquired by Curtiss-Wright Corporation, and moved to St. Louis, Missouri, before production ceased in the Great Depression. However, Beech returned to Wichita in 1932, acquired the abandoned Travel Air factory, and resumed production under his own name, with the Beech Aircraft Corporation â producing what would have been the 17th Travel Air model, but as the Beech Model 17 &quot;Staggerwing.&quot;

==History==
===Early biplanes===

The company initially built a series of sporting and training open-cockpit biplanes, including the Model A, Model B, Model BH, and Model BW (These were subsequently renumbered.) Other types included the 5000 and 6000 high wing cabin monoplanes and the CW / 7000 mailplane.

The A differed in some minor details such as lacking the overhanging Fokker style ailerons that gave the rest of the series the nickname &quot;Wichita Fokker&quot; (not present on all of the later models though), while the B, BH and BW differed only in the engine installed â the A and B had a Curtiss OX-5, the BH had a Hispano-Suiza V-8, the BW had a Wright radial (of various types) though other radials would be installed later (especially after it became the 4000). 

Aside from the Wichita Fokkers seen in such movies as Howard Hughes&#x27; Hell&#x27;s Angels, likely the most famous of the open cockpit biplanes was N434N, a D4D (the ultimate derivative of the BW) painted in Pepsi colors for airshow and skywriting use which survives in the National Air &amp; Space Museum&#x27;s Udvar-Hazy annex. A second, backup D4D, N434P, used by Pepsi in later years to supplement and fill-in for the original aircraft, is housed in the Hiller Aviation Museum in San Carlos, California.

===Cabin monoplanes===
 The Travel Air 5000 was a Cessna design, ordered in small numbers for National Air Transport. Two were custom-built long-range endurance aircraft similar in concept to Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s Spirit of St. Louis. &quot;Woolaroc&quot;, flown by Art Gobel won the disastrous Dole Air Race from Oakland, California to Hawaii in which the majority of contestants disappeared at sea or otherwise died attempting the crossing.

Travel Air then produced the Model 6000, a five or six-seat high-wing cabin monoplane â intended for airline use, and for very wealthy private owners.

 A small fleet of Travel Air 6000s were the first airliners for Delta Air Service (eventually renamed Delta Airlines). In 1928, National Air Transport operated the Type 6000 on their mail and passenger routes from Chicago to Dallas, Kansas City and New York. 

Two Travel Air 6000 were purchased by the Paraguayan government during the Chaco War (1932â1935) for the Transport Squadron of its Air Arm. These planes belonged to TAT with the registrations NC624K (c/n 6B-2011) and NC9815 (c/n 6B-1029); They received the military serials T-2 and T-5 (later reserialled as T-9). The planes were intensively used during the conflict as air ambulances. They both survived the war and continued flying in the air arm. In 1945, they were transferred to the first Paraguayan airline, &quot;LÃ­neas AÃ©reas de Transporte Nacional (LATN)&quot; and received the civil registrations ZP-SEC and ZP-SED. They were withdrawn from use in 1947.

===Cabin biplanes===
The CH or 7000 â a single-engine, cabin biplane, with a pilot&#x27;s open-cockpit above and behind the small, enclosed cabin for cargo or passengers â found little success, but ended up in Alaska as an early bushplane.

===Racing monoplanes===
Travel Air was also responsible for a series of very successful racing aircraft, which due to the company being extremely secretive about them during development, were named &quot;Mystery Ships&quot; by the press. In 1929, at the National Air Races in Cleveland, the first Travel Air Model R Mystery Ship became the first American airplane to outrun the nation&#x27;s top fighter aircraft, winning the Thompson Trophy unlimited-class pylon race. The &quot;Mystery Ships&quot; dominated the racing circuit for several years and had the distinction of being faster than anything the U.S. military had on strength. It forced the U.S. military to face the need to give up biplane fighters and water-cooled engines.

Its renown led to one example being sold to the Italians which inspired the design of a racing aircraft and the Breda Ba.27 fighter.

===Acquisition by Curtiss-Wright===
Travel Air merged with the Curtiss-Wright Corporation in August 1929. Curtiss-Wright continued to manufacture some of the Travel Air designs though they were renumbered again so that the 4000 became the 4, the 6000 became the 6. Additional types that had been close to production number from 8 to 16 were built while under Curtiss-Wright management such as the Curtiss-Wright CW-12. which in various marks was sold to several South American countries.

Travel Air Founder (with Clyde Cessna and Lloyd Stearman) Walter Beech resigned from the Curtis-Wright Corporation in March 1932 to form Beech Aircraft Company in Wichita,Ks.

===Powder Puff Derby===

In August 1929, the first Women&#x27;s Air Derby was held. Of the 20 entrants in the Women&#x27;s Air Derby, otherwise known as &quot;the Powder Puff Derby&quot;, seven flew Travel Airs and it was Louise Thaden who won the Santa Monica, Calif., to Cleveland race. Opal Kunz finished eighth. The other five Travel Airs were flown by Pancho Barnes, Claire Fahy, Marvel Crosson, Mary von Mack, and Blanche Noyes.

One of the odd qualifications was that the aircraft would have to have horsepower âappropriate for a woman.â Opal Kunz was told her airplane was too fast for a woman to handle, and had to get another aircraft or stay out of the race. ââ¦Though Opal Kunz owned and flew her own 300 horse power Travel Air, it was disallowed since it was deemed by the judges to be âtoo fast for a woman to fly.â With 25,000.00 in prize money at stake, she bought a lower powered Travel Air to race with.â

<doc id="1033997" wikidata="Q682813" url="?curid=1033997" title="Heinz Reinefarth">
<text>Heinz Reinefarth (26 December 1903 â 7 May 1979) was a German SS commander during World War II and government official in West Germany after the war. During the Warsaw Uprising of August 1944 his troops committed numerous atrocities. After the war, Reinefarth became the mayor of the town of Westerland, on the isle of Sylt, and member of the Schleswig-Holstein Landtag. Polish demands for extradition were never accepted, and Reinefarth was never convicted of any war crime.

==Early years==
Reinefarth was born in Gnesen (Gniezno), Province of Posen. After finishing the gymnasium in 1922, he studied law at the University of Jena. He became a member of the student fraternity (this was the origin of the &quot;Schmiss&quot; â German for &quot;dueling scar&quot; â on his left cheek). He graduated in 1927 and passed the 1st degree state exams. Until 1930 he completed his application at the local court in Jena and was promoted to judge. On 1 August 1932, he joined the NSDAP and received party identification card 1,268,933. In December of the same year, he joined the SS.

==World War II==
Shortly before the outbreak of World War II, Reinefarth was conscripted as a reserve Feldwebel. For his actions during the invasion of Poland he received the 2nd Class Iron Cross. He took part in the 1940 campaign against France, for which he was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross. On 20 April 1942, he was promoted to &quot;SS-BrigadefÃ¼hrer&quot;, the equivalent of Generalmajor in the Wehrmacht.

After promotion to brigadier, Reinefarth was appointed as General Inspector of SS in the Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia. In September 1943, he was transferred to Berlin where he served in the Ministry of Order Police (&quot;Hauptamt Ordnungspolizei&quot;). On 29 January 1944, Reinefarth was assigned to be SS and Police Leader in Reichsgau Wartheland (Polish PoznaÅ Voivodeship annexed by Germany in 1939).

===Warsaw Uprising===
After the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising, Reinefarth was ordered to organise a military unit consisting of personnel from various security units and head for Warsaw. Upon arrival, his forces (Kampfgruppe Reinefarth) were included in the Korpsgruppe von dem Bach of General Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski who was ordered by Heinrich Himmler to quell the rebellion. From 5 August 1944, Reinefarth&#x27;s group took part in mass murders in the undefended Wola area.

====Murder of civilians====

In two days, the units of Reinefarth, which included the notorious SS-Sturmbrigade Dirlewanger under SS-OberfÃ¼hrer Oskar Dirlewanger, murdered approximately 60,000 civilian inhabitants of Warsaw in what is known as the Wola massacre. In one of his reports to the commander of the German 9th Army Reinefarth stated that &quot;we have more prisoners than ammunition to kill them&quot;. After securing the Wola area, his troops took part in heavy fighting against the Armia Krajowa in the Old Town. In September, his forces were transferred to attack the boroughs of PowiÅle and CzerniakÃ³w, where they committed further atrocities, including killing of POWs and wounded found in military hospitals. In all 150,000â200,000 Polish civilians were killed during the uprising. For his actions during the Warsaw Uprising Reinefarth was awarded the Oak Leaves to his Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross on 30 September 1944.

===Later war activity===
In November 1944, Reinefarth was given command over the XIV SS Corps on the Upper-Rhine and in December 1944 over the XVIII SS Corps in the central Oder river area. Between January and March 1945, he commanded the defence of &quot;Festung KÃ¼strin&quot; (Kostrzyn nad OdrÄ). He declined to defend it to the last man and Hitler found fault with the way he withdrew his troops. Himmler, acting on Hitler&#x27;s order, had Reinefarth arrested at the end of March 1945. Later he was sentenced to death by a military court. However, the sentence was not carried out, and he continued to command those of his troops that managed to leave the fortress. He moved his troops to the west and surrendered to the British.

==Postwar==
After World War II, the Polish communist authorities demanded his extradition. However, the British and American authorities of occupied West Germany decided that Reinefarth could be useful as a witness at the Nuremberg Trial. After the trials, he was arrested for war crimes, but the local court in Hamburg released him shortly afterwards on the grounds of lack of evidence. Reinefarth went on to live a normal life. In December 1951, he was elected mayor of the town of Westerland, the main town on the island of Sylt. In 1962, he was elected to the parliament (&quot;Landtag&quot;) of Schleswig-Holstein. After his term ended in 1967, he worked as a lawyer. Despite numerous demands by Communist Poland, he was not extradited as the German courts had ruled that there was no evidence of him committing any crimes. He was considered not guilty in the eyes of the law and the federal government. He received a general&#x27;s pension upon retirement. He died on 7 May 1979 in his mansion on Sylt.

==Legacy==
In 2014, the local authorities of Westerland raised a memorial table remembering Polish victims of Reinefarth. A local SPD member, Ernst Wilhelm Sojan, who was present at the ceremony had campaigned since the 1960s to raise awareness of acts committed by Reinefarth but said that he was always met with a &quot;wall of silence&quot;. The regional Schleswig-Holstein government issued a special statement expressing regret that Heinz Reinefarth had been allowed to work as politician in the region. Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski praised the authorities of Sylt for attempting to deal with its past.

<text>The Rutan Model 54 Quickie is a lightweight single-seat taildragger aircraft of composite construction, configured with tandem wings.

The Quickie was primarily designed by Burt Rutan as a low-powered, highly efficient kit-plane. Its tandem wing design has one anhedral forward wing and one slightly larger dihedral rear wing. The forward wing has full-span control surfaces and is thus similar to a canard wing, but is considerably larger. The aircraft has unusual landing gear, with the main wheels located at the tips of the forward wing.

==Design and development==
The Quickie Aircraft Corporation was formed to produce and market the Quickie in kit form after 1978. Two years later a two-seater variant of the same layout followed as the Q2. The original &quot;Quickie&quot; (Model 54 in Rutan&#x27;s design series) is one of several unconventional aircraft penned by Rutan for the general aviation market.

The Quickie followed from Jewett and Sheehan&#x27;s intention in 1975 for a low-cost, low-power, single-seat homebuilt aircraft. The first element to be found by Jewett and Sheehan was the engine, which â although low-powered (they had anticipated 12Â hp) â had to be reliable for aviation work. With the help of Onan, a manufacturer of industrial four-stroke engines, they were able to procure a engine that would deliver 18Â hp (14Â kW) at 3,600 rpm.

Rutan was then involved with the design; Sheehan and Jewett suggesting a scaled-down Vari-Eze. After a preliminary pusher canard configuration design (Rutan Model 49) had been discarded, his solution to the design issues of low drag without retractable undercarriage and a workable center of gravity travel, was a tractor engine/tandem wing layout. Conversely to canard layout, the conventional front engine location put the pilot close to the center of gravity, a key point for a light aircraft. The wheels were incorporated into wingtip fairings without much drag penalty and the tandem layout gave safe stalling characteristics. Rutan produced the first drawings in May 1977 and thereafter the three of them worked on the design drawings over the next two months with construction beginning in August After the first flights, Rutan spent more time with his Defiant design and other projects, and it was Jewett and Sheehan who continued development of the design and market it for home-build use. An agreement was reached that Rutan would fund the development and testing and once the design was complete they would pay Rutan back from future sales of the designs and kits.

===Configuration===
The Quickie is a tandem wing taildragger, having one forward wing and one rear wing (instead of the more usual main wing and tailplane). According to Rutan this layout was not new, having previously been used in aircraft such as the Mignet &quot;Flying Flea&quot;.

As with other Rutan designs, the Quickie is constructed of glass fibre and resin over a foam core. The wings are foam blanks cut to shape with a hot wire before covering, and the fuselage made up of 1 inch-thick (25.4Â mm) foam slabs.

The forward wing provides around 60% of the lift. The full-span control surfaces on the forward wing serve as combined elevators and flaps. Ailerons are located inboard on the rear wing which is shoulder-mounted just aft of the pilot. The tandem layout provides positive lift from both pairs of wings; whereas on a conventional aircraft, the tailplane mostly provides negative lift.

The Quickie has fixed (non-retractable) main wheels faired into spats located at the tips of the forward wing. The absence of separate landing gear helps to reduce both weight and drag, such savings allowing a smaller engine and a smaller fuel tank. Even though the propeller is of small diameter, propeller clearance remains limited and the Quickie is rather vulnerable to ground strikes.

Pilot controls include a side-stick on the right and a throttle on the left. Rudder pedals are linked to the steerable tailwheel. The rather crude cable-operated brake comprises a cockpit lever operating steel tire-scrubbers on each main wheel.

===Construction and flight tests===

Construction of the prototype commenced in August 1977 at the Rutan Aircraft Factory; Gene did the majority of the construction work and the prototype was completed in about 400 hours. The prototype Quickie registered &quot;N77Q&quot; (77 for 1977, Q for Quickie.) started its flight test program in November 1977. All three of the designers flew it on the first day. The prototype was modified during its test program. The span of both the canard and main wing were increased to improve lifting ability. These reduced stall speed and shortened takeoff and landing distances; its attitude on the ground was also adjusted for optimal takeoff and landing. Originally designed with a fixed fin and only the faired tailwheel acting as the rudder, a conventional rudder was substituted. The steerable tailwheel allows directional control up to the point of liftoff, as the Quickie does not lift its tail during the takeoff run. Although it takes off at around 55Â mph and its maximum speed of 126Â mph is impressive for its engine power, the rate of climb is &quot;modest&quot;. The flight test program was completed in mid-April 1978, five months after its first flight.

===Recognition and records===
In June 1978 a Quickie prototype was flown to the Experimental Aircraft Association&#x27;s annual gathering at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, where the aircraft drew intense public interest and won the Outstanding New Design Award.

==Production==
In June 1978, only two months after the prototype&#x27;s first flight, Jewett and Sheehan formed the Quickie Aircraft Corporation to produce and sell complete aircraft kits. Production began in June 1978, and by 1980 the Corporation had sold 350 kits. Other firms were granted marketing rights, and ultimately some 1,000 Quickie kits were sold. The Corporation closed its doors in the mid 1980s.

==Plot summary==
=== Persepolis 1: The Story of a Childhood ===
&quot;Persepolis&quot; 1 begins by introducing Marjane, the ten-year-old protagonist. Set in 1980, the novel focuses on her experiences of growing up during the Islamic Revolution in Iran. Her story details the impact of war and religious extremism on Iranians, especially women. Belonging to an upper-middle-class family, Marji has access to various educational materials, such as books and a radio, which expose her to Western political thought at a very young age. By discovering the ideas of numerous philosophers, Marji reflects on her class privilege and is eager to learn about her family&#x27;s political background. This inquiry inspired her to participate in popular demonstrations against the Shah&#x27;s regime, in which people asked for his exile to safeguard their rights. Unfortunately, after the Shah&#x27;s departure, Marji notices the rise of religious extremism in her society and is unhappy about it. Her uncle Anoosh&#x27;s visit deepens her interest in politics when he tells her stories of being imprisoned as a communist revolutionary. His stories cause her to value ideas of equality and resistance. The new government then began to reform Iranian society, especially by having women cover themselves publicly and restricting social freedoms. Marji&#x27;s family begins to fear for their lives since many of their friends and thousands of Iranians have fled the new regime to Europe or the USA, but they resolve to stay. Anoosh is arrested again and accused of being a spy. He is executed for his political beliefs. Marji is upset that God did nothing to help her uncle and rejects her faith.

After an abrupt family vacation to Europe, Marji returns to Iran, where she learns from her grandmother that the government has declared war against Iraq. As her hometown of Tehran comes under attack, she finds safety in her basement, which doubles as a bomb shelter. One night, the family hears the Iranian national anthem play on the TV, moving them to tears. It is later revealed that the government released the soldiers and air pilots from prison who were in jail for protesting. The soldiers agreed to fight on the condition that the country&#x27;s national anthem be played on public broadcasting. Amidst the chaos of an ongoing war, her family secretly revolts against the new regime by having parties and consuming alcohol, which is prohibited in the country. Two years of war force Marji to explore her rebellious side by skipping classes, obsessing over boys, and visiting the black market that has grown due to the shortages caused by war and repression.

As the war intensifies, Marji rushes home one day to find that a long-range ballistic missile has hit her street. Her family escaped the missile as it hit the neighboring building, which housed their neighbors of Iran&#x27;s minor population of Jews, the Baba Levys. She is traumatized by seeing her friend&#x27;s dead body and expresses her anger against the Iranian political system. Her family begins to worry about her safety and decides to send her off to Austria for further study and to escape the war. The novel ends with her departure to Europe and the final sight of her mother fainting in her father&#x27;s hands, unable to bear letting go of Marjane.

=== Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return ===
The second part of the series takes place in Vienna, where Marji starts her new life as a student at the LycÃ©e FranÃ§ais de Vienne, at a boarding house because her mother&#x27;s friend has no room for her at her own apartment. Since she cannot speak German upon arrival, Marji finds it hard to communicate, but eventually overcomes it and makes friends. She assimilates into the culture by celebrating Christmas and going to Mass with her roommate. Away from home, Marji&#x27;s Iranian identity deepens, and she is expelled from the boarding house after a verbal altercation with a nun who makes xenophobic comments against Marji.

Marji starts living with her friend Julie and her mother. Here, she experiences more culture shock when Julie talks about her sexual endeavors, as such topics are prohibited in Iran. Soon she undergoes a physical and ideological transformation by using drugs and changing her appearance while continuing to move house. Marji finally settles on a room with Frau Dr. Heller, but their relationship is unstable. Issues also arise in many of Marji&#x27;s relationships, in which she finds comfort in drugs. She forms a relationship with Markus, but breaks up with him when she discovers that he has been cheating on her. Marji leaves Frau Dr. Heller&#x27;s house after she accuses Marji of stealing her brooch. She spends the day on a park bench and ends up living on the streets for two months. When she catches bronchitis, she almost dies, but is found and taken to a hospital. Marji reaches out to her parents who arrange for her to move back and thus, after living in Vienna for four years, she returns to Tehran.

At the airport, she recognizes how different Iran is from Austria. Donning her veil once more to go out, she takes in the 65-foot murals of martyrs, rebel slogans, and the streets renamed after the dead. At home, her father tells her the horrors of the war, and they talk deep into the night about what she had missed. After hearing what her parents had gone through while she was away in Vienna, she resolves never to tell them of her time there. However, her trauma from Austria makes her fall into depression, forcing her to attempt suicide twice. When she survives, she takes it as a sign to live and starts her process of recovery by looking after her health and taking up a job. She also begins art classes at the local university. However, due to the restrictions of showing female nudity, Marji and her friends attend secret sessions and parties, away from the prying eyes of the religious police.

Following her return to Iran, Marji meets Reza, also a painter, and they soon begin to date, but this proves to be frowned upon by the religious police. They are caught holding hands and their families are forced to pay a fine to avoid their lashings. In 1991, Reza proposes marriage to Marji, and after some contemplation, she accepts. Her mother, Taji, warns her that she has gotten married too young, and Marji soon realizes that she feels trapped in the role of wife. Marji attends a party, but someone warns them about the religious police. They quickly discard the alcohol and the women cover themselves as the police enter the building. The men make their escape by jumping from the rooftop, but Marji&#x27;s friend Nima hesitates and falls to his death. Later on in 1994, her marriage has deteriorated and Marji confides in her friend, Farnaz, that she no longer loves Reza and wants a divorce. Farnaz advises her to stay with her husband because divorced women are social outcasts, but her grandmother urges her to get a divorce. After much contemplation, Marji decides to separate from a reluctant Reza. She goes to her parents and tells them about her and Reza&#x27;s divorce, and they comment on how proud they are of her and suggest that she should leave Iran permanently and live a better life back in Europe.

In late 1994 before her departure for Europe, Marji visits the countryside outside Tehran. She also visits the Caspian Sea, the grave of her grandfather, and the prison building where her uncle Anoosh is buried. In the autumn, Marji along with her parents and grandmother go to Mehrabad Airport for their final goodbye as she heads off to live in Paris. Marji then reveals that her grandmother died in 1996. The book ends with the message: &quot;Freedom had a price.&quot;

==Background==

Marjane Satrapi&#x27;s use of graphic novels to depict her own life events has made her reading easily accessible to people throughout the world. In an article titled &quot;Why I wrote &quot;Persepolis&quot;&quot;, Satrapi says &quot;Images are a way of writing. When you have the talent to be able to write and to draw, it seems a shame to choose only one. I think it&#x27;s better to do both&quot;. Her first novel in this series, &quot;Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood&quot;, depicts her childhood experiences in Iran during the Islamic Revolution, while her subsequent novel, &quot;Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return&quot;, depicts her high school years in Vienna, Austria. &quot;Persepolis 2&quot; also includes Satrapi&#x27;s return to Iran where she attends college, marries, and later divorces before moving to France. Hence, the series is not only a memoir, but a &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;. Throughout both books, she focuses on the idea of &quot;witnessing&quot;. Meaning, the motivation behind her writing involves describing her life from the viewpoint of someone viewing political and social chaos. This displays the &quot;survival&quot; aspect behind Satrapi as a young girl, and eventually young woman within this context. The influences of Satrapi&#x27;s past education in Iran and Europe, and specifically German expressionism, can be felt throughout her writings and drawings as well. She seeks to create a visual context for not only those from the West, but also those from the Middle-East due to the lack of physical optics for this important time in history.

Both describe her life experiences of being Iranian and the way in which the Revolution shaped her life and the lives of her friends and family. The novel narrates &quot;counter-historical narratives that are mostly unknown by a Western reading public.&quot;

Satrapi chose the name Persepolis, originating from the Ancient Greek term for Iran, in order to convey the message that the current state of Iran comes from thousands of years of background, not just recent hostile events.

After the writing and publication of &quot;Persepolis,&quot; Satrapi herself has transformed into a diplomat for her home country of Iran. She has &quot;become a spokeswoman for greater freedom [in Iran], and a voice against war and for cross-cultural understanding&quot;.

== Genre and style ==
&quot;Persepolis&quot; is an autobiography written as a graphic novel based on Satrapi&#x27;s life. The genre of graphic novels can be traced back to 1986 with Art Spiegelman&#x27;s &quot;Maus&quot;, portraying the Holocaust through the use of cartoon images of mice and cats. Later, writers such as Aaron McGruder and Ho Che Anderson used graphic novels to discuss themes such as Sudanese orphans and civil rights movements. This genre has become an appropriate forum for examining critical matters by using illustrations to discuss foreign topics, such as those discussed in &quot;Persepolis&quot;. The &quot;graphic novel&quot; label is not so much a single mindset as a coalition of interests that happen to agree on one thingâthat comics deserve more respect. Nima Naghibi and Andrew O&#x27;Malley, English professors at Ryerson University, believe that &quot;Persepolis&quot; is part of a larger movement of autobiographical books by Iranian women. Satrapi wrote &quot;Persepolis&quot; in a black-and-white format: &quot;the dialogue, which has the rhythms of workaday family conversations and the bright curiosity of a child&#x27;s questions, is often darkened by the heavy black-and-white drawings&quot;. The use of a graphic novel has become much more predominant in the wake of events such as the Arab Spring and the Green Movement, as this genre employs both literature and imagery to discuss these historical movements. In an interview titled &quot;Why I Wrote Persepolis&quot;, Marjane Satrapi said that &quot;graphic novels are not traditional literature, but that does not mean they are second-rate.&quot;

&quot;Persepolis&quot; uses visual literacy through its comics to enhance the message of the text. Visual literacy stems from the belief that pictures can be &quot;read.&quot; As defined by the Encyclopedia of the Social and Cultural Foundations of Education, &quot;Visual literacy traces its roots to linguistic literacy, based on the idea that educating people to understand the codes and contexts of language leads to an ability to read and comprehend written and spoken verbal communication.&quot;

Due to the nature of artistic choices made in &quot;Persepolis&quot; by virtue of it being an illustrated memoir, readers have faced difficulty in placing it into a genre. The term &quot;novel&quot; most commonly refers to books that are fiction. Thus, there is some controversy surrounding how to classify the genre of &quot;Persepolis&quot;, being that it is non-fiction. Nima Naghibi and Andrew O&#x27;Malley, illustrate this by stating how bookstores have had issues with shelving &quot;Persepolis&quot; under a single label. Furthermore, scholars like Hillary Chute argue that &quot;Persepolis&quot;, like other similar books, should be called a &quot;graphic narrative&quot; instead of a &quot;graphic novel.&quot; She argues that the stories these works contain are unique in themselves and challenge popular historical narratives. Chute explains that graphic narratives defy convention portraying complex narratives of trauma emphasize a different approach on discussing issues of &quot;unspeakability, invisibility, and inaudibility that have tended to characterize recent trauma theory-as well as a censorship-driven culture at large.&quot; She adds that this technique of uncovering the invisible is an influential feminist symbol. Chute contends that &quot;Persepolis&quot; highlights this &#x27;unseen&#x27; by appearing to be visually simplistic so that it can draw attention to the intense political events happening in the story.

Professor Liorah Golomb from the University of Oklahoma states about Persepolis and related books; &quot;As time went on the comics still tended towards the autobiographical, but storytelling gained importance. Most of the women creating comics today are still doing so from a woman&#x27;s point-of-view, but their target audience seems more universal.

An article from a journal on multicultural education written about teaching &quot;Persepolis&quot; in a middle school classroom acknowledges Satrapi&#x27;s decision to use this genre of literature as a way for &quot;students to disrupt the one-dimensional image of Iran and Iranian women.&quot; In this way, the story encourages students to skirt the wall of intolerance and participate in a more complex conversation about Iranian history, U.S. politics, and the gendered interstices of war.&quot; Satrapi utilizes a combination of the text and accompanying drawings to represent Iranian and European culture through both images and language, asserts Marie Otsby in an article for the Modern Language Association of America published in 2017.

== Analysis ==
&quot;Persepolis&quot; reminds readers of the &quot;precarity of survival&quot; in political and social situations.

=== Feminism in the East ===
Satrapi&#x27;s graphic memoir contains themes concerning feminist ideals and the hegemonic power of the state. Satrapi uses the context of the Iranian Revolution to criticize the hypocrisy of state-enforced social pressures that seek to enact violence. During the Iranian Revolution, martyrdom had been nationalized by the state in order to encourage young men to participate in the revolution and strict social rules were forced upon women and were justified as protection. Satrapi&#x27;s recount of her harassment by both male and female members of the Guardians of the Revolution because of her untraditional behavior and clothing exemplifies the hypocrisy of the state&#x27;s beliefs. Although Satrapi criticizes the socio-political pressures, she does not fully dismiss her Iranian identity. Marji struggles with finding her identity because she is torn between a deep connection with her Iranian heritage and culture and the political and religious pressure enforced by the state. Satrapi&#x27;s struggle with societal pressures is based on her belief that the Islamic state oppresses women when it regulates their expression and dictates their beliefs.

Jennifer Worth, an Adjunct Assistant Professor at Wagner College, presents that Satrapi uses the veil as a metaphor to describe the desire to control women. Worth proposes that the Guardians of the Revolution wield the cultural symbolism of the veil to oppress the social liberties of women, while Marji herself dons the symbolic veils of makeovers in Austria to escape social ostracization for her Iranian identity. Through her utilization of the veil as a symbol of concealing latent struggles, Satrapi contends that the confusion surrounding Marji&#x27;s transition into adulthood stems from her complex beliefs and feelings about her Iranian heritage.

The portrayal of the veil in &quot;Persepolis&quot; has also been used to combat the Western perception that the veil is solely a symbol of oppression. The perceptions are challenged in the first chapter of &quot;Persepolis&quot; similarly titled &#x27;The Veil,&#x27; where Satrapi illustrates young girls playing in the schoolyard with their veils. Lisa Botshon, a professor of English, and Melinda Plastas, a professor of Women and Gender studies, comment that Satrapi&#x27;s depictions of the veil illuminate for Western audiences the extent of Middle Eastern women&#x27;s agency. The depictions challenge the Western notion that women who wear the veil are helpless and victims of brutal social oppression. 

Manuela Constantinoâs article, published as part of the University of Toronto Press, argues that &quot;Persepolis&quot; was released during a crucial time that aided its reception in North America. In 2003-04, tensions over middle eastern evasion were on the rise in the United States. At the same time, &quot;Persepolis&quot; started to circulate in the North American education system. Itâs possible that âits arrival could be read as a political attempt to shape an understanding of Middle Eastern cultural practices by presenting a liberal Middle Eastern viewpoint amidst radical unrestâ Constantino speculates if Satrapiâs memoir had anti-American or anti-Western sentiment, âwould it have been so widely circulated and therefore so popularâ?Â  This makes &quot;Persepolis&quot; &quot;easily accessible and seemingly transparent,&quot; Constantino states that these childlike reactions to the horrors they are exposed to bridge the gap between human and history. The complicated historical facts of war are broken down into easily understandable moments in history, and help people understand what is usually complex and culturally intricate into relatable and educational.

Mahdiyeh Ezzatikarami and Firouzeh Ameri of the International Journal of Applied Linguistics &amp; English Literature published their article the strengths of &quot;Persepolis&quot; as a memoir. Telling the story from a child&#x27;s point of view allows Satrapi to facilitate &quot;supreme authenticity and immediacy&quot; to her memoir. Satrapi created an identity that readers immediately relate and identify with. This is seen through her childish ways of coping with evil. When Marji&#x27;s grandmother asks how she will install the rule of old people never feeling pain, Marji states she will simply forbid it. Seeing how children react to the violence of war makes &quot;Persepolis&quot; &quot;easily accessible and seemingly transparent.&quot;

==Publication history==
The original French series was published by L&#x27;Association in four volumes, one volume per year, from 2000 to 2003. Marie Ostby, professor at Connecticut College, noted that, David Beauchard, a co-founder of L&#x27;Association, strove to &quot;create a forum for more culturally informed, self-reflective work,&quot; especially consisting of female writers. L&#x27;Association published &quot;Persepolis&quot; as one of their three &quot;breakthrough political graphic memoirs.&quot; &quot;Persepolis, tome 1&quot; ends at the outbreak of war; &quot;Persepolis, tome 2&quot; ends with Marji boarding a plane for Austria; &quot;Persepolis, tome 3&quot; ends with Marji putting on a veil to return to Iran; &quot;Persepolis, tome 4&quot; concludes the work.

When the series gained critical acclaim, it was translated into many different languages. In 2003, Pantheon Books published parts 1 and 2 in a single volume English translation (with new cover art) under the title &quot;Persepolis&quot; which was translated by Blake Ferris and Mattias Ripa, Satrapi&#x27;s Swedish husband and edited by Anjali Singh; parts 3 and 4 (also with new cover art) followed in 2004 as &quot;Persepolis 2&quot;, with the translation credited to Anjali Singh. In October 2007, Pantheon repackaged the two English language volumes in a single volume (with film tie-in cover art) under the title &quot;The Complete Persepolis&quot;. The cover images in the publications from both countries feature Satrapi&#x27;s own artwork; however, the French publication is much less ornamented than the United States equivalent.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Upon its release, the graphic novel received high praise, but was also met with criticism and calls for censorship. In the September/October 2003 issue of &quot;Bookmarks&quot;, the first part was scored 3.5 out of 5. The second part, in the November/December 2004 issue, was scored four out of five. The magazine&#x27;s critical summary reads: &quot;Highly recommended, across the board&quot;. According to Book Marks, the book received a &quot;rave&quot; consensus, based on six critics: three &quot;rave&quot; and three &quot;positive&quot;. On Metacritic, the second part was scored 84 out of 100 from eleven critic reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. On the French site &quot;Zoo Le Mag&quot;, the comic received 4.0 out of 5 from press. Globally, on &quot;Complete Review,&quot; received ratings such as &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B+&quot; for press reviews of individual volumes.

Andrew Arnold of &quot;Time&quot; described &quot;Persepolis&quot; as &quot;sometimes funny and sometimes sad but always sincere and revealing.&quot; Kristin Anderson of &quot;The Oxonian Review of Books&quot; of Balliol College, University of Oxford said, &quot;While &quot;Persepolis&quot;â³ feistiness and creativity pay tribute as much to Satrapi herself as to contemporary Iran, if her aim is to humanise her homeland, this amiable, sardonic and very candid memoir couldn&#x27;t do a better job.&quot;

===Awards, lists, and impact===
The book continued to receive acclaim among many critics lists. According to &quot;The Greatest Books&quot;, a site that aggregates book lists, it is &quot;the 592nd greatest book of all time&quot;.&quot;Persepolis&quot; has won numerous awards, including one for its text at the AngoulÃªme International Comics Festival Prize for Scenario in AngoulÃªme, France, and another for its criticism of authoritarianism in Vitoria, Spain. Marie Ostby points out that &quot;Satrapi&#x27;s work marks a watershed movement in the global history of the graphic novel,&quot; exemplified by the recent increase in use of the graphic novel as a &quot;cross-cultural form of representation for the twenty-first century Middle East.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine included &quot;Persepolis&quot; in its &quot;Best Comics of 2003&quot; list.

Despite the controversy surrounding the novel, &quot;Persepolis&quot; has turned into an important piece of literature which connects the Western and Iranian world. The graphic novel was awarded to &quot;Newsweek&quot;â³s Ten Best Fiction books list, and was created into a film in 2007. Reading &quot;Persepolis&quot; &quot;lends itself to discussion of literary strategies and to teaching visual literacy, as well as to broader discussions of cultural difference as constructed in art and the media and as experienced in life&quot;.

Friere and Macedo argue that teaching &quot;Persepolis&quot; in a middle school classroom has proved to be beneficial in the development of students&#x27; literacy and critical thinking skills, which are necessary to help them interpret the world around them. In a journal article on how to teach &quot;Persepolis&quot; in a post 9/11 classroom, Lisa Botshon and Melinda Plastas from the University of Illinois assert that &quot;Persepolis&quot; offers a platform for students to question Western stereotypes and fear surrounding the Middle East. Another study that was done also showed that &quot;Persepolis&quot; has greatly impacted the thinking skills of middle school students who were taught it in their ELA classroom. Despite the images and easy-to-read text, &quot;Persepolis&quot; is also often taught at the high school level because high-school aged students would be able to take the information learned and thoroughly discuss it to enhance their literary skills. From writing about her life and the people in it, Satrapi&#x27;s writing also denies the typical assumptions made by the world about Western Iranian women. Friere and Macedo believe that the way women and Iranian society in general are presented in the book can help students come to doubt their perceived sense of national insecurity when it comes to the Middle East.

In 2019, the graphic novel was ranked 47th on &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 best books of the 21st century. In 2024, it was ranked 48th of the 100 best books of the 21st century by the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

===Censorship in the United States===
Despite the positive reviews, &quot;Persepolis&quot; faced some attempts at censorship in school districts across the United States. In March 2013, the Chicago Public Schools ordered copies of &quot;Persepolis&quot; to be removed from seventh-grade classrooms after Chicago Public Schools CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett determined that the book &quot;contains graphic language and images that are not appropriate for general use&quot;. Upon hearing about the proposed ban, upperclassmen at Lane Tech High School in Chicago flocked to the library to check out &quot;Persepolis&quot; and organized demonstrations in protest. CPS reinstituted the book in school libraries and classrooms.

In 2014, the book faced three different challenges across the United States, which led to its placement as #2 on the ALA&#x27;s list of &quot;Top Ten Most Challenged Books of 2014&quot;. The first of these controversies occurred in Oregon&#x27;s Three Rivers School District, where a parent insisted on the removal of the book from its high school libraries due to the &quot;coarse language and scenes of torture&quot;. The book remained in libraries without any restriction after school board meetings to discuss this challenge. Another case of censorship arose in central Illinois&#x27; Ball-Chatham School District, where a student&#x27;s parent stated that the book was inappropriate for the age group assigned. The parent also inquired into why &quot;Persepolis&quot; was assigned to the students to read on September 11. Despite this opposition, the school board unanimously voted to keep the book both in the school libraries and within the curriculum. The third case occurred in Smithville, Texas, where parents and members of the school community challenged the book being taught in Smithville High School&#x27;s World Geography Class. They voiced concerns about &quot;the newly-introduced Islamic literature available to students&quot;. The school board met to discuss this issue at a meeting on February 17, 2014, after a formal complaint was filed against the book. The board voted 5â1 to retain the novel.

In 2015, Crafton Hills College, in Yucaipa, California, also witnessed a challenge to the incorporation of &quot;Persepolis&quot; in its English course on graphic novels. After her completion of the class, Tara Shultz described &quot;Persepolis&quot; as pornographic and lacking in quality. Crafton Hills administrators released a statement, voicing strong support of academic freedom, and the novel was retained.

In 2022, Franklin Regional High School, located near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, paused teaching of &quot;Persepolis&quot; after complaints to the district. The book was reinstated to the curriculum as of a meeting on March 31, 2022.

===Film===

&quot;Persepolis&quot; has been adapted into an animated film, by Sony Pictures Classics. The film was co-directed by Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud. It was voiced by Catherine Deneuve, Chiara Mastroianni, Danielle Darrieux and Simon Abkarian. Debuting at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, Persepolis won the Jury Prize but also drew complaints from the Iranian government before its screening at the festival. It was nominated for an Academy Award in 2007 for best animated feature. The film has also received high honors, specifically, in 2007, when it was named the Official French Selection for the Best Foreign Language Film.

===Persepolis 2.0===
&quot;Persepolis 2.0&quot; is an updated version of Satrapi&#x27;s story, created by different authors who combined Satrapi&#x27;s illustrations with new text about the 2009 Iranian presidential election. Only ten pages long, &quot;Persepolis 2.0&quot; recounts the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on June 12, 2009. Done with Satrapi&#x27;s permission, the authors of the comic are two Iranian-born artists who live in Shanghai and who give their names only as Payman and Sina. The authors used Satrapi&#x27;s original drawings, changing the text where appropriate and inserting one new drawing, which has Marjane telling her parents to stop reading the newspaper and instead turn their attention to Twitter during the protests.

&quot;Persepolis 2.0&quot; was published online, originally on a website called &quot;Spread Persepolis&quot;; an archived version is available online.

<text>Ryman Auditorium (originally Union Gospel Tabernacle and renamed Grand Ole Opry House for a period) is a historic 2,362-seat live-performance venue and museum located at 116 Rep. John Lewis Way North, in the downtown core of Nashville, Tennessee, United States. It is best known as the home of the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; from 1943 to 1974. It is owned and operated by Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc. Ryman Auditorium was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 and was later designated as a National Historic Landmark on June 25, 2001, for its pivotal role in the popularization of country music. A storied stage for Rock &amp; Roll artists for decades, the Ryman was named a Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Landmark in 2022.

==History==

===Union Gospel Tabernacle===

The auditorium opened as the Union Gospel Tabernacle in 1892. Its construction was spearheaded by Thomas Ryman (1843â1904), a Nashville businessman who owned several saloons and a fleet of riverboats. Ryman conceived the idea of the auditorium as a tabernacle for the influential revivalist Samuel Porter Jones. He had attended one of Jones&#x27; 1885 tent revivals with the intent to heckle, but was instead converted into a devout Christian who pledged to build the tabernacle so the people of Nashville could attend large-scale revivals indoors. It took seven years to complete and cost . Jones held his first revival at the site on May 25, 1890, when only the building&#x27;s foundation and walls had been completed.

Architect Hugh Cathcart Thompson designed the structure. Exceeding its construction budget, the tabernacle opened in debt. Jones sought to name the tabernacle in Ryman&#x27;s honor, but Ryman denied the request several times. When Ryman died in 1904, his memorial service was held at the tabernacle, with Jones officiating. During the service, Jones proposed the building be renamed as Ryman Auditorium, which was met with the overwhelming approval of the attendees. Jones died less than two years later in 1906.

The building was originally designed to contain a balcony, but a lack of funds delayed its completion. The balcony was built and opened in time for the 1897 gathering of the United Confederate Veterans, with funds provided by members of the group. As a result, the balcony was once called the Confederate Gallery. Upon completion of the balcony, the Ryman&#x27;s capacity rose to 6,000. In 2017, the &quot;Confederate Gallery&quot; plaque was removed and replaced with one that reads &quot;1892 Ryman Auditorium.&quot; A stage was added in 1901 that reduced the capacity to just over 3,000.

===Under the leadership of Lula C. Naff===
Though the building was designed as a house of worship â a purpose it continued to serve throughout most of its early years â it was often leased to promoters for nonreligious events in an effort to pay off its debts and remain open. In 1904, Lula C. Naff, a widow and mother who was working as a stenographer, began to book and promote speaking engagements, concerts, boxing matches, and other attractions at the Ryman in her free time. In 1914, when her employer went out of business, Naff made booking these events her full-time job. She eventually transitioned into a role by 1920 as the Ryman&#x27;s official manager. She preferred to use the name &quot;L.C. Naff&quot; in an attempt to avoid initial prejudices as a female executive in a male-dominated industry. Naff gained a reputation for battling local censorship groups, who had threatened to ban various performances deemed too risquÃ©. In 1939, Naff won a landmark lawsuit against the Nashville Board of Censors, which was planning to arrest the star of the play &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; due to its provocative nature. The court declared the law creating the censors to be invalid.

Naff&#x27;s ability to book stage shows and world-renowned entertainers in the city&#x27;s largest indoor gathering place kept the Ryman at the forefront of Nashville&#x27;s consciousness and enhanced the city&#x27;s reputation as a cultural center for the performing arts, even as the building began to age. Harry Houdini in 1924, W.C. Fields, Will Rogers in 1925, Charlie Chaplin, Bob Hope with Doris Day in 1949, and John Philip Sousa (among others) performed at the venue over the years, earning the Ryman the nickname &quot;The Carnegie Hall of the South&quot;. The Ryman also hosted lectures by U.S. presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft in 1907 and 1911, respectively. Italian opera singer Enrico Caruso appeared in concert there in 1919. It also hosted the inaugurations of three governors of the state of Tennessee.

The first event to sell out the Ryman was a lecture by Helen Keller and Anne Sullivan Macy in 1913. While being a trailblazer for working women, Naff also championed the cause of racial diversity. The building was used as a regular venue for the Fisk Jubilee Singers (they performed there in 1913) from nearby Fisk University, a historically black college. The state&#x27;s Jim Crow laws required Ryman audiences to be segregated, with some shows designated for &quot;White Audiences Only&quot; and others for &quot;Colored Audiences Only&quot;. But period photographs show that, in practice, Ryman audiences were often integrated. Naff retired in 1955 and died in 1960.

===&quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;===
After debuting in 1925, the local country music radio program known as the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; (originally called the &quot;WSM Barn Dance&quot;) became a Nashville institution. Broadcast over clear-channel AM radio station WSM, it could be heard in 30 states across the eastern part of the nation. Although not originally a stage show, the &quot;Opry&quot; began to attract listeners from around the region who would go to the WSM studio to see it live. When crowds got too large for the studio, in 1934 WSM began broadcasting the show from the Hillsboro Theatre (now Belcourt Theatre). The &quot;Opry&quot; moved to East Nashville&#x27;s Dixie Tabernacle in 1936 and then to War Memorial Auditorium in 1939.

After four years â and several reports of upholstery damage caused by its rowdy crowds â the &quot;Opry&quot; was asked to leave War Memorial and sought a new home yet again. Thanks to Ryman Auditorium&#x27;s wooden pews and central location, Naff and other institution leaders thought the auditorium would be a perfect venue for such an audience. They began renting the venue to WSM for its shows. The &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; was first broadcast from the Ryman on June 5, 1943, and it originated there every week for nearly 31 years thereafter. Every show sold out, and hundreds of fans were often turned away.
During its tenure at Ryman Auditorium, the &quot;Opry&quot; hosted the major country music stars of the day and became a show known around the world. In addition to its home on WSM, portions of the show (at various times throughout its history) were also broadcast on network radio and television to a wider audience. Melding its then-current usage with the building&#x27;s origins as a house of worship, the Ryman got the nickname &quot;The Mother Church of Country Music&quot;, which it holds to this day.

Because of the period during which it was constructed and because it was not designed to be a performance venue, the Ryman lacked a true backstage area. It had only one dressing room for the men, and women were relegated to an inadequate ladies&#x27; restroom. The shortage of space forced performers to wait in the wings, the narrow hallways, and the alley behind the building&#x27;s south wall. Thus, many performers often ventured across the alley to Tootsie&#x27;s Orchid Lounge and other bars, where they drank alongside patrons and sometimes performed. This practice enhanced the popularity and appeal of the honky-tonk bars along Nashville&#x27;s Lower Broadway.

The Ryman through the mid-1960s hosted many musicians: Marian Anderson in 1932, Bill Monroe and the Bluegrass Boys in 1945, Little Jimmy Dickens in 1948, Hank Williams in 1949, The Carter Sisters with Mother Maybelle Carter in 1950, Elvis in 1954, Johnny Cash in 1956, trumpeter Louis Armstrong in 1957, Patsy Cline in 1960, Lester Flatt &amp; Earl Scruggs (bluegrass) in 1964, and Minnie Pearl in 1964.
Prior to September 27, 1963, Ryman Auditorium had no singular owner; it was an independent entity governed by a board of directors. That changed when WSM, Inc., purchased the building for . When WSM assumed total control of the auditorium, it renamed the building as the Grand Ole Opry House. Many people continued to refer to it by the familiar Ryman name, well-known after 60 years in use.

WSM financed minor upgrades to the Opry House in 1966 to maintain its functionality, but soon began making plans to move the &quot;Opry&quot; to a new location altogether. Despite the building&#x27;s deteriorating condition, the lack of air conditioning, and the abundance of unsavory surroundings in its urban neighborhood, the show&#x27;s increasing popularity often attracted crowds too large to fit inside the venue. Plans announced in 1969 centered around a larger, custom-built auditorium that would provide a more controlled and comfortable atmosphere for audiences and performers alike, as well as better radio and television production facilities. 

The company purchased a large tract of land in a then-rural area a few miles away. The new &quot;Opry&quot; theater served as the anchor of a grand entertainment complex. The development became known as Opryland USA. It eventually included the Opryland theme park and the Opryland Hotel.

The amusement park opened on May 27, 1972, and the new venue (also called the Grand Ole Opry House) debuted on Saturday, March 16, 1974. The last &quot;Opry&quot; show at the Ryman occurred the previous evening, on Friday, March 15. The final shows downtown were emotional. Sarah Cannon, performing as Minnie Pearl, broke character and cried on stage. In an effort to maintain continuity with the &quot;Opry&quot;&#x27;s storied past, a large circle was cut from the floor of the Ryman stage and inlaid into the center of the new &quot;Opry&quot; stage. In another traditional holdover, the new Opry House was also designed to feature pew seating, although (unlike the Ryman) they are cushioned.

Eventually and without fanfare, the building downtown resumed using the Ryman Auditorium name to differentiate it from the new Grand Ole Opry House. 

===Facing demolition===

When the plans for Opryland USA were announced, WSM president Irving Waugh also revealed the company&#x27;s intent to demolish the Ryman and use its materials to construct a chapel called &quot;The Little Church of Opryland&quot; at the amusement park. Waugh brought in a consultant to evaluate the building, noted theatrical producer Jo Mielziner, who had staged a production at the Ryman in 1935. He concluded that the Ryman was &quot;full of bad workmanship and contains nothing of value as a theater worth restoring.&quot; Mielziner suggested the auditorium be razed and replaced with a modern theater. But Waugh&#x27;s plans were met with resounding resistance from the public, including many influential musicians of the time. Architectural critic Ada Louise Huxtable ridiculed the decision in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, writing: &quot;First prize for the pious misuse of a landmark, and a total misunderstanding of the principles of preservation. Gentlemen, for shame.&quot; (She had won a Pulitzer Prize for her writing.)

However, Roy Acuff, an &quot;Opry&quot; stalwart and a major stakeholder of Opryland USA, reportedly said, &quot;I never want another note of music played in that building.&quot; He led the unsuccessful charge to tear down the Ryman. Acuff, a staunch supporter of moving the &quot;Opry&quot; to a modern home, told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1974, &quot;Most of my memories of the Ryman Auditorium are of misery, sweating out here on this stage, the audience suffering too... We&#x27;ve been shackled all of my career.&quot; Acuff notably hated the dressing room situation at the Ryman so much that he bought a nearby building just to have a bigger one. A life-sized statue of Acuff (alongside one of Sarah Cannon as Minnie Pearl) has been installed in the lobby of the preserved Ryman Auditorium.

Members of historic preservation groups argued that WSM, Inc. (and Acuff, by proxy) exaggerated the Ryman&#x27;s poor condition, saying the company was worried that attachment to the old building would hurt business at the new Opry House. Preservationists emphasized the building&#x27;s importance to regional religious history and gained traction for their case as a result. The building was formally assessed and approved for the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. In 1974, United States Senators from Tennessee Howard Baker and Bill Brock, together with officials of the United States Department of the Interior, pleaded with WSM, Inc. (and its parent company, NLT Corporation) to preserve the building. The company tabled the decision on the Ryman&#x27;s fate. The building was ultimately saved from demolition, although no active efforts were made to improve its condition.
===Dormancy===
Following the departure of the &quot;Opry&quot;, the Ryman failed to attract new performers. It was mostly vacant and deteriorating for nearly 20 years. In that period, the surrounding neighborhood also declined. Despite its regressing condition and the absence of performances, Ryman Auditorium was never closed. It remained a destination for heritage tourism in the city.

On August 30, 1979, following a tip from a citizen, the Nashville bomb squad discovered and disarmed a massive car bomb that could have damaged or destroyed a three-block area of downtown Nashville that included the Ryman. A nearby strip club was found to be the bomber&#x27;s target. The device was disarmed less than 20 minutes before it was timed to detonate.

In September 1983, soon after NLT Corporation was acquired in a hostile takeover bid by American General Insurance, the building was included in the sale of all the WSM and Opryland properties to Oklahoma-based Gaylord Broadcasting Company for . (The WSM assets were organized into a subsidiary holding company called Opryland USA, Inc., which would change its name to Gaylord Entertainment Company following a 1991 corporate spin-off.) The company&#x27;s chief executive, Ed Gaylord, had become acquainted with many of the &quot;Opry&quot; stars during his involvement with the long-running television series &quot;Hee Haw&quot;. His fondness for the &quot;Opry&quot; and friendships with its figures â particularly Sarah Cannon â are often cited as reasons for his interest in the acquisition. Ryman Auditorium was included in the sale almost as an afterthought, but Gaylord&#x27;s appreciation of its history helped preserve it. 

In 1986, as part of the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; 60th-anniversary celebration, CBS aired a special program that featured some of the &quot;Opry&quot;&#x27;s legendary stars performing at the Ryman. While the auditorium was dormant, major motion pictures continued to be filmed on location there, including John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Elvis&quot; (1979), &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1980 â Loretta Lynn Oscar-winning biopic), &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; (1985 â story of Patsy Cline), and Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Honkytonk Man&quot; (1982). A 1979 television special, &quot;Dolly &amp; Carol in Nashville&quot;, included a segment featuring Dolly Parton performing a gospel medley on the Ryman stage.

===Revival and renovations===

In 1989, Opryland USA, Inc. began work to beautify the Ryman&#x27;s exterior. The structure of the building was also improved, as the company installed a new roof, replaced broken windows, and repaired broken bricks and wood. The building&#x27;s interior, however, was left mostly untouched.

From April 30 to May 2, 1991, Emmylou Harris and the Nash Ramblers performed three acoustic concerts at the dilapidated building, during which no one was allowed to sit on or beneath the balcony due to safety concerns. Capacity was limited to around 200. Some of the recordings were released as an album entitled &quot;At the Ryman&quot;, which won the Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group at the 35th Annual Grammy Awards in 1993. The concerts and album&#x27;s high acclaim are given near-universal credit for renewed interest in reviving Ryman Auditorium as an active venue.

The Ryman hosted a concert and one-act play entitled &quot;The Ryman: The Tabernacle Becomes A Shrine&quot; on May 18, 1992, to celebrate the building&#x27;s centennial. In October 1992, executives of Gaylord Entertainment announced plans to renovate the entire building and expand it to create modern amenities for performers and audiences alike. This was part of their larger initiative to invest in the city&#x27;s revitalization of the downtown area.

In September 1993, renovations were begun to develop it as a world-class concert hall. Building systems were upgraded, such as air conditioning for the first time. The auditorium&#x27;s original wooden pews were removed, refurbished, and returned to the building to serve as the auditorium&#x27;s seating. Both far-reaching ends of the U-shaped balcony (which had previously extended all the way to the building&#x27;s south wall) were removed. New backstage facilities were built inside the original building. An addition containing a lobby, restrooms, concessions, offices, and a grand staircase leading to the balcony was constructed and attached to the east side of the auditorium. With this change, the Ryman&#x27;s main entrance was moved from the west side of the building (Fifth Avenue North) to the east side (Fourth Avenue North). An outdoor entry plaza was also added here, and a large statue of Thomas Ryman was installed. 
The first performance at the newly renovated Ryman was a broadcast of Garrison Keillor&#x27;s &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; on June 4, 1994. Keillor said he was inspired to create &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; while reporting on the final &quot;Opry&quot; show at the Ryman in 1974 for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Following that, the Ryman hosted an extended residency of the original musical &quot;Always... Patsy Cline,&quot; which starred Mandy Barnett in the titular role about the life of the legendary singer.

===Return of the &quot;Opry&quot;===
On Sunday, October 18, 1998, the &quot;Opry&quot; held a benefit show at Ryman Auditorium, marking its return to the venue for the first time since its final show on March 15, 1974. The show was well received by fans, performers, and management alike, so the decision was made to host the &quot;Opry&quot;&#x27;s regular shows there on January 15 and 16, 1999, as part of the celebration to commemorate 25 years at the new venue.

Given the success of the January shows that year, beginning in November 1999, the &quot;Opry&quot; was produced at Ryman Auditorium for three months. In addition, this enabled them to avoid performance conflicts from construction of the Opry Mills shopping mall (which replaced the Opryland USA theme park in 2000) next door to the Grand Ole Opry House. The &quot;Opry&quot; returned to the Ryman annually for all of its November, December, and January shows until 2019â20. This enabled the production to acknowledge its roots while taking advantage of a smaller venue during the off-peak season for tourism. It also freed the Grand Ole Opry House for special holiday presentations. The Ryman also served as the primary venue for the &quot;Opry&quot; in the summer of 2010, while the Grand Ole Opry House was undergoing repairs after damage from a devastating flood.

The annual winter season at the Ryman was suspended in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the &quot;Opry&quot; performed abbreviated shows for broadcast in front of an empty Grand Ole Opry House. The Winter Ryman residency was not revived in 2021 although pandemic-related attendance restrictions were lifted. &quot;Opry&quot; shows returned to Ryman for a one-month run in January 2023, and a three-night run in January 2024. While still officially the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;, the shows there have been billed as &quot;Opry at the Ryman&quot;. 

===The Ryman today===
Gaylord Entertainment Company, the venue&#x27;s owner since 1983, adopted the Ryman&#x27;s name as its own when it transitioned into a real estate investment trust in 2012. The company is now known as Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc. Ryman Auditorium is managed within the company&#x27;s majority-owned subsidiary, Opry Entertainment Group. The renovation of the Ryman, combined with the construction of other attractions such as Bridgestone Arena and Wildhorse Saloon, helped revitalize Nashville&#x27;s downtown district into a destination for tourists and locals alike in the mid-1990s. 

Since then, the Ryman has become one of the most venerable performance venues in Nashville. Performers have praised Ryman Auditorium&#x27;s acoustics, calling them among the best in the world.

The Ryman was unharmed in the 2010 Tennessee floods and the 2020 Nashville bombing, both of which resulted in major damage to parts of the downtown neighborhood. 

In January 2012 plans were announced to replace the Ryman&#x27;s 61-year-old stage with one of medium-brown Brazilian teak. The new stage floor, the facility&#x27;s third, retained an 18-inch lip of its predecessor&#x27;s blonde oak at its front edge, similar to the way the Ryman stage had been commemorated with an inlaid circle of wood at the new Opry House. The stage&#x27;s original hickory support beams were reinforced with concrete foundations, crossbeams, and joist work that helped triple the stage&#x27;s load capacity, ensuring it would remain viable for performances in the decades to come.

In 2015, the Ryman underwent another renovation and expansion. Much of the 1994 expansion was gutted and remodeled. The original building received only minor touch-ups and remained in use throughout the construction. The renovation and expansion includes more lobby space, plus expanded restrooms, concessions, and a retail shop. A new quick-service restaurant was added, called &quot;Cafe Lula&quot; and named in memory of Lula C. Naff. The cafe closed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and was not reopened. An expanded retail shop selling Ryman memorabilia opened in its place in 2023. The previous retail shop was then converted to a VIP lounge.

Prior to the pandemic, Opry Entertainment Group held regular shows at the Ryman year-round. In addition to the &quot;Opry at the Ryman&quot; shows in the winter, the auditorium hosted &quot;Opry Country Classics&quot; each spring and autumn, and &quot;Bluegrass Nights at the Ryman&quot; each summer. Due to the scheduling of concerts postponed during the pandemic, those Opry spin-off shows were canceled or moved to the Grand Ole Opry House in 2021. As COVID-19 hit Nashville, live music at the Ryman briefly came to a halt, until the venue launched the Livestream concert series, &quot;Live at the Ryman&quot; in August 2020. For King &amp; Country, Cam, Chris Janson, Scotty McCreery, Brett Young, and Old Crow Medicine Show put on Friday night shows from the Ryman stage for a completely digital audience. Ultimately, &quot;Bluegrass Nights&quot; returned to the Ryman in 2021 and &quot;Opry at the Ryman&quot; returned in January 2023. &quot;Opry Country Classics&quot; has remained at the Grand Ole Opry House, except for a yearly matinee during CMA Fest in June.â¯

The Ryman has welcomed a wide variety of talent since its inception. In recent years, Wu-Tang Clan made history as the Ryman&#x27;s first hip-hop headliner; the Ryman welcomed its first headlining drag queens, Trixie and Katya; and the venue hosted its first comedy residency in August, 2022, with comedian John Mulaney doing four stand-up shows in three nights.

Ryman Auditorium has hosted several notable residencies including a string of 10 shows from Little Big Town in 2017 that took place as part of the Ryman&#x27;s 125th anniversary celebration. In 2022 alone, Vince Gill and Amy Grant, Vince Gill (solo), Jason Isbell, and Brett Eldredge all held residencies at the Ryman.â¯

In 2018, the Ryman was named the most iconic structure in Tennessee by Architectural Digest. The Ryman has been named &quot;Pollstar&#x27;s&quot; Theater of the Year 13 times and was named the Academy of Country Music&#x27;s Theater of the Year in 2022. The Academy of County Music Awards, Americana Music Association Awards, Nashville Songwriter Awards, and several other industry award ceremonies have taken place on the Ryman stage.

The Ryman features prominently in the music video of the 2021 song &quot;Where Have You Gone&quot; by Alan Jackson.

On May 26, 2022, the Ryman officially became a Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Landmark. Later that year, Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame partnered with the Ryman to transform a wing of the building into a tour feature dedicated to rock history in Nashville. &quot;Rock Hall at the Ryman&quot; opened to the public on Nov. 2, 2022, and includes artifacts from artists including Elvis Presley, James Brown, Joan Jett, Foo Fighters and Dolly Parton. 

The Ryman has also served as a gathering place for the memorial services of many prominent country music figures. Tammy Wynette, Chet Atkins, Skeeter Davis, Harlan Howard, Bill Monroe, Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash, Billy Block, George Hamilton IV, Earl Scruggs, Jim Ed Brown, and Naomi Judd have all been memorialized from the Ryman stage.

==Museum and tours==
The Ryman is open for tours during daytime hours when the performance venue is not in active use. Guided tours include access to backstage facilities, while self-guided tours feature exhibits displayed in cases throughout the auditorium, which are shielded from view when the building is being used for a show. Permanent exhibits include the Rock Hall At The Ryman, a collaboration with the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame showcasing the venue&#x27;s influence in the rock genre, as well as the &quot;Soul of Nashville&quot;, a short holographic film that serves as the first stop on the tour. Situated in an immersive 100-seat theatre, the film features an actress portraying Lula C. Naff in presenting the history of the Ryman. It also features an original song performed by Darius Rucker, Sheryl Crow, Vince Gill, and the Fisk Jubilee Singers.

<text>Lawrence Oglethorpe Gostin (born October 19, 1949) is an American law professor who specializes in public health law. He was a Fulbright Fellow and is best known as the author of the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act and as a significant contributor to journals on medicine and law.

== Early life and education ==
Larry Gostin was born in New York City in 1949, the son of Joseph and Sylvia Gostin. He received a B.A. in psychology from the State University of New York at Brockport in 1971 and a J.D. from Duke Law School in 1974.

He was an adjunct professor at Harvard University from 1986 to 1994 and went on to be a professor of law at Georgetown University&#x27;s Law Center and a professor of law and public health at Johns Hopkins University&#x27;s School of Hygiene and Public Health.

==Career in health law==
In the 1970&#x27;s, Gostin relocated to the United Kingdom and joined the mental health charity MIND, where he helped establish its Legal Welfare and Rights Department in 1975. He served as the organization&#x27;s legal director until 1983. During his time at MIND, he was instrumental in the organization&#x27;s campaign regarding reform of mental health legislation. According to Jennifer Brown, Gostin&#x27;s writings on &quot;new legalism&quot; â a regulatory philosophy which combined protection of mental health patients&#x27; civil rights with entitlement to proper mental health treatment â was a big influence on the Mental Health Act 1983. Gostin himself estimated that two thirds of the act were based on proposals from MIND or from his writings. As legal director of MIND, Gostin also oversaw the filing of many test cases at the European Commission of Human Rights and European Court of Human Rights &quot;highlighting the absence of possibilities for a legal review of detention [under UK mental health legislation] for many.&quot;

From January 1984 to 1985, Gostin was general secretary of the National Council for Civil Liberties in the United Kingdom. From 1986 to 1994, he was executive director of the American Society for Law, Medicine, and Bioethics. He worked on Hillary Clinton&#x27;s health plan, serving as chairman of the health information privacy and public health committees of the President&#x27;s Task Force on Health Care Reform.

His proposed Model State Emergency Health Powers Act ignited a firestorm of controversy across the ideological spectrum, from Phyllis Schlafly to LAMBDA, for being overly broad and ripe for abuse.

He is also Professor of Public Health at the Johns Hopkins University and Director of the Center for Law &amp; the Public&#x27;s Health at Johns Hopkins and Georgetown UniversitiesâA Collaborating Center of the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He is Adjunct Professor of Public Health (Faculty of Medical Sciences) and Research Fellow (Centre for Socio-Legal Studies) at Oxford University.

Gostin chairs a World Health Organization project on the law and ethics of public health strategies for pandemic influenza and is leading a drafting team on developing a Model Public Health Law for the World Health Organization.

In a January 25, 2020 interview with NPR, Gostin argued against travel restrictions to prevent the spread of coronavirus, stating, âThe risk is extraordinarily low for people in the United States.â

In an April 2021 interview with Vox, he described his previous belief about travel restrictions being bad as an &quot;almost religious belief&quot; with no evidence behind it, saying âI have now realized [..] that our belief about travel restrictions was just that â a belief. It was evidence-freeâ. 

He is the Linda D. and Timothy J. O&#x27;Neill Professor of Global Health Law at the Georgetown University Law Center, where he directs the O&#x27;Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law.

<text>&quot;The Last Word&quot; is a dystopian short story by the author Graham Greene, written in 1988 (see 1988 in literature). It first appeared in &quot;The Independent&quot; but can also be found in collections of his short fiction, notably the Penguin edition of &quot;The Last Word and Other Stories&quot;, for which it is the lead story. The story, written toward the end of Greene&#x27;s life, reflects his frustration at the declining influence of religion, particularly Catholicism, in the modern world.

&quot;The Last Word&quot; is Greene&#x27;s final short story, before his death from leukaemia in 1991.

==Plot summary==
The story revolves around the last Pope, John XXIX, who was overthrown more than twenty years earlier with the establishment of a new world government under General Megrim. The pope is now a frail old man, who lives in obscurity under a moderate form of house arrest, ignored by his neighbours and forbidden to keep any religious items. All he has left is a book, possibly a Bible, that he has managed to hide, and a crucifix with an arm broken off. He is already feeble-minded and has forgotten most of his past, and the world has forgotten him as wellâwhen the concierge at a hotel is told that he is the pope, he answers, &quot;The Pope? What&#x27;s the Pope?&quot;

When the Pope was toppled, there was an attempt to assassinate him, but this failed, and it was afterwards decided not to make him a martyr to the few surviving Christians. Since then, Christianity has been eradicated, and the Pope is now the last surviving Christian.

In the story, the Pope is flown for a formal meeting with the General, the new leader of the new world order. After many long years, it is a formal meeting, much publicized in the world press. The Pope&#x27;s robes and even his papal ring are restored to him from the World Museum of Myths, and he is forced to don them for the occasion, faintly remembering earlier days when they were his normal attire. At 11:30 am sharp, he is taken to meet the general, who reminds him that he is &quot;The last Pope, but still a Pope,&quot; and therefore still a threat. The general places a gun on the table and offers him an opportunity to die with dignity, &quot;The last Christian. This is a moment of history.&quot; After many long years of isolation, this is a relief to the Pope. The two men share a glass of wine before the execution is to take place. His last words, before he is shot, are 

Greene ends the story by reflecting on the General&#x27;s concern that Christianity may be abandoned and its last believers persecuted, but that somehow the faith will survive. Even after performing the execution himself, the General is plagued by the doubt, &quot;...is it possible that what this man believed may be true?&quot;

<text>Solanine is a glycoalkaloid poison found in species of the nightshade family within the genus &quot;Solanum&quot;, such as the potato (&quot;Solanum tuberosum&quot;). It can occur naturally in any part of the plant, including the leaves, fruit, and tubers. Solanine has pesticidal properties, and it is one of the plant&#x27;s natural defenses. Solanine was first isolated in 1820 from the berries of the European black nightshade (&quot;Solanum nigrum&quot;), after which it was named. It belongs to the chemical family of saponins.

== Solanine poisoning ==

=== Symptoms ===
Solanine poisoning is primarily displayed by gastrointestinal and neurological disorders. Symptoms include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach cramps, burning of the throat, cardiac dysrhythmia, nightmares, headache, dizziness, itching, eczema, thyroid problems, and inflammation and pain in the joints. In more severe cases, hallucinations, loss of sensation, paralysis, fever, jaundice, dilated pupils, hypothermia, and death have been reported.

Ingestion of solanine in moderate amounts can cause death. One study suggests that doses of 2 to 5Â mg/kg of body weight can cause toxic symptoms, and doses of 3 to 6Â mg/kg of body weight can be fatal.

Symptoms usually occur 8 to 12 hours after ingestion, but may occur as rapidly as 10 minutes after eating high-solanine foods.

=== Correlation with birth defects ===
Some studies show a correlation between the consumption of potatoes suffering from late blight (which increases solanine and other glycoalkaloid levels) and the incidence of spina bifida in humans. However, other studies have shown no correlation between potato consumption and the incidence of birth defects.

=== Livestock poisoning ===
Livestock can also be susceptible to glycoalkaloids. High concentrations of solanine are necessary to cause death to mammals. The gastrointestinal tract cannot efficiently absorb solanine, which helps decrease its strength to the mammal body. Livestock can hydrolyze solanine and excrete its contents to diminish its presence in the body.

== Mechanism of action ==
There are several proposed mechanisms of how solanine causes toxicity in humans, but the true mechanism of action is not well understood. &quot;Solanum&quot; glycoalkaloids have been shown to inhibit cholinesterase, disrupt cell membranes, and cause birth defects. One study suggests that the toxic mechanism of solanine is caused by the chemical&#x27;s interaction with mitochondrial membranes. Experiments show that solanine exposure opens the potassium channels of mitochondria, increasing their membrane potential. This, in turn, leads to Ca2+ being transported from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm, and this increased concentration of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm triggers cell damage and apoptosis. Potato, tomato, and eggplant glycoalkaloids like solanine have also been shown to affect active transport of sodium across cell membranes. This cell membrane disruption is likely the cause of many of the symptoms of solanine toxicity, including burning sensations in the mouth, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, internal hemorrhaging, and stomach lesions.

== Biosynthesis ==

Solanine is a glycoalkaloid poison created by various plants in the genus &quot;Solanum&quot;, such as the potato plant. When the plant&#x27;s stem, tubers, or leaves are exposed to sunlight, it stimulates the biosynthesis of solanine and other glycoalkaloids as a defense mechanism so it is not eaten. It is therefore considered to be a natural pesticide.

Though the structures of the intermediates in this biosynthetic pathway are shown, many of the specific enzymes involved in these chemical processes are not known. However, it is known that in the biosynthesis of solanine, cholesterol is first converted into the steroidal alkaloid solanidine. This is accomplished through a series of hydroxylation, transamination, oxidation, cyclization, dehydration, and reduction reactions. Specifically, solanidine formation involves sequential hydroxylation, transamination, and cyclization reactions.The solanidine is then converted into solanine through a series of glycosylation reactions catalyzed by specific glycosyltransferases.

Plants like the potato and tomato constantly synthesize low levels of glycoalkaloids like solanine. However, under stress, such as the presence of a pest or herbivore, they increase the synthesis of compounds like solanine as a natural chemical defense. This rapid increase in glycoalkaloid concentration gives the potatoes a bitter taste, and stressful stimuli like light also stimulate photosynthesis and the accumulation of chlorophyll. As a result, the potatoes turn green, and are thus unattractive to pests. Other stressors that can stimulate increased solanine biosynthesis include mechanical damage, improper storage conditions, improper food processing, and sprouting. The largest concentration of solanine in response to stress is on the surface in the peel, making it an even better defense mechanism against pests trying to consume it.

== Safety ==

=== Suggested limits on consumption of solanine ===
Toxicity typically occurs when people ingest potatoes containing high levels of solanine. The average consumption of potatoes in the U.S. is estimated to be about 167 g of potatoes per day per person. There is variation in glycoalkaloid levels in different types of potatoes, but potato farmers aim to keep solanine levels below 0.2Â mg/g. Signs of solanine poisoning have been linked to eating potatoes with solanine concentrations of between 0.1 and 0.4Â mg per gram of potato. The average potato has 0.075Â mg solanine/g potato, which is equal to about 0.18Â mg/kg based on average daily potato consumption.

Calculations have shown that 2 to 5Â mg/kg of body weight is the likely toxic dose of glycoalkaloids like solanine in humans, with 3 to 6Â mg/kg constituting the fatal dose. Other studies have shown that symptoms of toxicity were observed with consumption of even 1Â mg/kg.

=== Storage of potatoes ===
Various storage conditions can have an impact on the level of solanine in potatoes. Glycoalkaloid levels increase when potatoes are exposed to light because light increases synthesis of glycoalkaloids like solanine. Potatoes stored in a dark place avoid increased solanine synthesis. Potatoes that have turned green due to increased chlorophyll and photosynthesis are indicative of increased light exposure and are therefore associated with high levels of solanine. Synthesis of solanine is also stimulated by mechanical injury because glycoalkaloids are synthesized at cut surfaces of potatoes. Storage of potatoes for extended periods of time has also been associated with increased solanine content. A study found that the solanine levels in Kurfi Jyoti and Kurfi Giriraj potatoes increase solanine levels by 0.232Â mg/g and 0.252Â mg/g respectively after being poorly stored in a heap.

=== Effects of cooking on solanine levels ===
Most home processing methods like boiling, cooking, and frying potatoes have been shown to have minimal effects on solanine levels. For example, boiling potatoes reduces the Î±-chaconine and Î±-solanine levels by only 3.5% and 1.2% respectively, but microwaving potatoes reduces the alkaloid content by 15%. Deep frying at also does not result in any measurable change. Alkaloids like solanine have been shown to start decomposing and degrading at approximately , and deep-frying potatoes at for 10 minutes causes a loss of ~40% of the solanine. Freeze-drying and dehydrating potatoes has a very minimal effect on solanine content.

The majority (30â80%) of the solanine in potatoes is found in the outer layer of the potato. Therefore, peeling potatoes before cooking them reduces the glycoalkaloid intake from potato consumption. Fried potato peels have been shown to have 1.4â1.5Â mg solanine/g, which is seven times the recommended upper safety limit of 0.2Â mg/g. Chewing a small piece of the raw potato peel before cooking can help determine the level of solanine contained in the potato; bitterness indicates high glycoalkaloid content. If the potato has more than 0.2Â mg/g of solanine, an immediate burning sensation will develop in the mouth.

== Recorded human poisonings ==
Though from solanine poisoning are rare, there have been several notable cases of human solanine poisonings. Between 1865 and 1983, there were around 2000 documented human cases of solanine poisoning, with most recovering fully and 30 deaths. Because the symptoms are similar to those of food poisoning, it is possible that there are many undiagnosed cases of solanine toxicity.

In 1899, 56 German soldiers fell ill due to solanine poisoning after consuming cooked potatoes containing 0.24Â mg of solanine per gram of potato. There were no fatalities, but a few soldiers were left partially paralyzed and jaundiced. In 1918, there were 41 cases of solanine poisoning in people who had eaten a bad crop of potatoes with 0.43Â mg solanine/g potato with no recorded fatalities.

In Scotland in 1918, there were 61 cases of solanine poisoning after consumption of potatoes containing 0.41Â mg of solanine per gram of potato, resulting in the death of a five-year old.

A case report from 1925 reported that 7 family members who ate green potatoes fell ill from solanine poisoning two days later, resulting in the deaths of the 45-year-old mother and 16-year-old daughter. The other family members recovered fully. In another case report from 1959, four members of a British family exhibited symptoms of solanine poisoning after eating jacket potatoes containing 0.5Â mg of solanine per gram of potato.

There was a mass solanine poisoning incident in 1979 in the U.K., when 78 adolescent boys at a boarding school exhibited symptoms after eating potatoes that had been stored improperly over the summer. Seventeen of them ended up hospitalized, but they all recovered. The potatoes were determined to have between 0.25 and 0.3Â mg of solanine per gram of potato.

Another mass poisoning was reported in Canada in 1984, after 61 schoolchildren and teachers showed symptoms of solanine toxicity after consuming baked potatoes with 0.5Â mg of solanine per gram of potato.

== In potatoes ==
Potatoes naturally produce solanine and chaconine, a related glycoalkaloid, as a defense mechanism against insects, disease, and herbivores. Potato leaves, stems, and shoots are naturally high in glycoalkaloids.

When potato tubers are exposed to light, they turn green and increase glycoalkaloid production. This is a natural defense to help prevent the uncovered tuber from being eaten. The green colour is from chlorophyll, and is itself harmless. However, it is an indication that increased level of solanine and chaconine may be present. In potato tubers, 30â80% of the solanine develops in and close to the skin, and some potato varieties have high levels of solanine.

Some potato diseases, such as late blight, can dramatically increase the levels of glycoalkaloids present in potatoes. Tubers damaged in harvesting and/or transport also produce increased levels of glycoalkaloids; this is believed to be a natural reaction of the plant in response to disease and damage.

Also, the tuber glycoalkaloids (such as solanine) can be affected by some chemical fertilization. For example, different studies have reported that glycoalkaloids content increases by increasing the concentration of nitrogen fertilizer.

Green colouring under the skin strongly suggests solanine build-up in potatoes, although each process can occur without the other. A bitter taste in a potato is another â potentially more reliable â indicator of toxicity. Because of the bitter taste and appearance of such potatoes, solanine poisoning is rare outside conditions of food shortage. The symptoms are mainly vomiting and diarrhea, and the condition may be misdiagnosed as gastroenteritis. Most potato poisoning victims recover fully, although fatalities are known, especially when victims are undernourished or do not receive suitable treatment.

The United States National Institutes of Health&#x27;s information on solanine strongly advises against eating potatoes that are green below the skin.

== In other plants ==
Fatalities are also known from solanine poisoning from other plants in the nightshade family, such as the berries of &quot;Solanum dulcamara&quot; (woody nightshade).
Some, such as the California Poison Control Center, have claimed that unripe tomatoes and tomato leaves contain solanine. However, Mendel Friedman of the United States Department of Agriculture contradicts this claim, stating that tomatine, a relatively benign alkaloid, is the tomato alkaloid while solanine is found in potatoes. Food science writer Harold McGee has found scant evidence for tomato toxicity in the medical and veterinary literature.

== In popular culture ==
Dorothy L. Sayers&#x27;s short story &quot;The Leopard Lady&quot;, in the 1939 collection &quot;In the Teeth of the Evidence&quot;, features a child poisoned by potato berries injected with solanine to increase their toxicity.

<doc id="1034011" wikidata="Q2529782" url="?curid=1034011" title="Sympodial branching">
<text>In botany, sympodial growth is a branching pattern where one branch develops more strongly than the other, resulting in the stronger branches forming the primary shoot and the weaker branches appearing laterally. A sympodium, also referred to as a sympode or pseudaxis, is the primary shoot, comprising the stronger branches, formed during sympodial growth. The pattern is similar to dichotomous branching; it is characterized by branching along stems or hyphae.

Sympodial growth occurs when the apical meristem is terminated and growth is continued by one or more lateral meristems, which repeat the process. The apical meristem may be consumed to make an inflorescence or other determinate structure, or it may be aborted.

==Types==

If the sympodium is always formed on the same side of the branch bifurcation, e.g. always on the right side, the branching structure is called a helicoid cyme or bostryx.

If the sympodium occurs alternately, e.g. on the right and then the left, the branching pattern is called a scorpioid cyme or cincinus (also spelled cincinnus).

Leader displacement may result: the stem appears to be continuous, but is in fact derived from the meristems of multiple lateral branches, rather than a monopodial plant whose stems derive from one meristem only.

Dichotomous substitution may result: two equal laterals continue the main growth.

==In orchids==
In some orchids, the apical meristem of the rhizome forms an ascendent swollen stem called a pseudobulb, and the apical meristem is consumed in a terminal inflorescence. Continued growth occurs in the rhizome, where a lateral meristem takes over to form another pseudobulb and repeat the process. This process is evident in the jointed appearance of the rhizome, where each segment is the product of an individual meristem, but the sympodial nature of a stem is not always clearly visible.

<doc id="1034012" wikidata="Q417915" url="?curid=1034012" title="Sufentanil">
<text>Sufentanil, sold under the brand names Sufenta among others, is a synthetic opioid analgesic drug approximately 5 to 10 times as potent as its parent drug, fentanyl, and 500 to 1,000 times as potent as morphine. Structurally, sufentanil differs from fentanyl through the addition of a methoxymethyl group on the piperidine ring (which increases potency but is believed to reduce duration of action), and the replacement of the phenyl ring by thiophene. Sufentanil first was synthesized at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1974.

==Medical uses==
Sufentanil offers properties of sedation and can be used as analgesic component of anesthetic regimen during an operation.

Because of its extremely high potency, it is often used in surgery and post-operative pain management for patients that are heavily opioid dependent/opioid tolerant because of long term opiate use for chronic pain or illicit opiate use. It is also used in surgery and post-operative pain control in people that are taking high dose buprenorphine for chronic pain because it has the potency and binding affinity strong enough to displace buprenorphine from the opioid receptors in the central nervous system and provide analgesia.

In 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dsuvia, a sublingual tablet form of the drug, that was developed in a collaboration between AcelRx Pharmaceuticals and the United States Department of Defense for use in battlefield settings where intravenous (IV) treatments may not be readily available. The decision to approve this new potent synthetic opioid came under criticism from politicians and from the chair of the FDA advisory committee, who fear that the tablets will be easily diverted to the illegal drug market. Dsuvia has since been withdrawn from the market due to &quot;unresolvable manufacturing constraints.&quot;

==Overdose==

===Management===
Because sufentanil is very potent, practitioners must be prepared to reverse the effects of the drug should the patient exhibit symptoms of overdose such as respiratory depression or respiratory arrest. As for all other opioid-based medications, naloxone (trade name Narcan) is the definitive antidote for overdose. Depending on the amount administered, it can reverse the respiratory depression and, if enough is administered, completely reverse the effects of sufentanil.

== Society and culture ==
=== Brand names ===
Sufentanil is marketed under various brand names including Dsuvia, Dzuveo, Sufenta, and Sufentil.

<doc id="1034014" wikidata="Q1575288" url="?curid=1034014" title="William Sharp (writer)">
<text>William Sharp (12 September 1855 â 12 December 1905) was a Scottish writer, of poetry and literary biography in particular, who from 1893 wrote also as Fiona Macleod, a pseudonym kept almost secret during his lifetime. He was also an editor of the poetry of Ossian, Walter Scott, Matthew Arnold, Algernon Charles Swinburne and Eugene Lee-Hamilton.

==Early life==
Sharp was born in Paisley and educated at Glasgow Academy and the University of Glasgow, which he attended 1871â1872 without completing a degree. In 1872 he contracted typhoid. During 1874â5 he worked in a Glasgow law office. His health broke down in 1876 and he was sent on a voyage to Australia. In 1878 he took a position in a bank in London.

==Career==
He was introduced to Dante Gabriel Rossetti by Sir Noel Paton, and joined the Rossetti literary group; which included Hall Caine, Philip Bourke Marston and Swinburne. He married his cousin Elizabeth Sharp in 1884, and devoted himself to writing full-time from 1891, travelling widely.

Also about this time, he developed an intensely romantic attachment to Edith Wingate Rinder, another writer of the consciously Celtic Edinburgh circle surrounding Patrick Geddes and &quot;The Evergreen&quot;. It was to Rinder (&quot;EWR&quot;) he attributed the inspiration for his writings as &quot;Fiona Macleod&quot; thereafter, and to whom he dedicated his first Macleod novel (&quot;Pharais&quot;) in 1894. Sharp had a complex and ambivalent relationship with W. B. Yeats during the 1890s, as a central tension in the Celtic Revival. Yeats initially found Macleod acceptable and Sharp not, and later fathomed their identity. Sharp found the dual personality an increasing strain.

On occasions when it was necessary for &quot;Fiona Macleod&quot; to write to someone unaware of the dual identity, Sharp would dictate the text to his sister (Mary Beatrice Sharp), whose handwriting would then be passed off as Fiona&#x27;s manuscript. 

===Hermeticism===
During his Macleod period, Sharp was a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. In August 1892, he published what became the only issue of the &quot;Pagan Review&quot;, in which he, under a set of pen names (including &quot;W. H. Brooks&quot;, &quot;W. S. Fanshawe&quot;, &quot;George Gascoigne&quot;, &quot;Willand Dreeme&quot;, &quot;Lionel Wingrave&quot;, &quot;James Marazion&quot;, &quot;Charles Verleyne&quot;, and &quot;Wm. Windover&quot;) argued for the establishment of a neo-paganism which would abolish gender inequality. The review was received negatively; among other things, critics wrote that its paganism was far removed from the pagan writings of the ancient world. The &quot;Saturday Review&quot; wrote:

==Death==
He died in 1905 at the &quot;Castello di Maniace&quot; near Bronte, in Sicily, where he was the guest of Sir Alexander Nelson Hood, 5th Duke of BrontÃ© (1904â1937), and was buried there in the ducal cemetery. He described the duchy and aspects of its history in his &quot;Attraverso la Ducea Nelson&quot;. 

In 1910, Elizabeth Sharp published a biographical memoir attempting to explain the creative necessity behind the deception, and edited a complete edition of his works.

==The Belgian Revival==

Sharp took an early interest in the Belgian avant-garde and disseminated knowledge of La Jeune Belgique movement in a number of essays published in English-language literary periodicals, including two essays entitled &quot;La Jeune Belgique&quot;, a biographical and critical essay titled &quot;Maeterlinck&quot;, a reflection on &quot;Ruysbroeck and Maeterlinck&quot; and a review of GÃ©rard Harry&#x27;s production of &quot;Princess Maleine&quot; and &quot;The Intruder&quot; (1892). He translated Auguste Jenart&#x27;s &quot;The Barbarian&quot; (1891) into English. His translation of Charles van Lerberghe&#x27;s &quot;Les Flaireurs&quot; was published as &quot;The Night-Comers&quot; in &quot;The Evergreen: A Northern Seasonal: Autumn&quot; in 1895.

==Musical Settings==
The poems of Fiona Macleod attracted the attention of composers in the first half of the 20th century as part of the Celtic Twilight movement in the UK and the US. By far the best known setting was the adaptation of the verse drama &quot;The Immortal Hour&quot; as the libretto for Rutland Boughton&#x27;s hugely successful opera of the same name, completed in 1914. The opera ran in London for 216 consecutive performances in 1922, and for a further 160 performances the following year, and was staged in New York City in 1926. It was revived at the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in London in 1953. The first recording of the complete work, sponsored by The Rutland Boughton Trust, took place in 1983 and was released the following year by Hyperion Records on CD and as a boxed vinyl set.

* Samuel Barber: &quot;Two Poems of the Wind&quot; (1924)
* Arnold Bax: &quot;A Celtic Song Cycle&quot;, (1904) and other songs
* Rutland Boughton: &quot;Five Celtic Songs&quot; (1910)

<text>The San Antonio Rampage were a professional ice hockey team in the American Hockey League based in San Antonio, Texas. The Rampage was primarily owned by Spurs Sports &amp; Entertainment throughout the team&#x27;s existence. In 2020, the franchise was sold to the Vegas Golden Knights and relocated as the Henderson Silver Knights.

==History==
In 2000, construction began on the SBC Center, located next to the Freeman Coliseum, home of the Central Hockey League&#x27;s San Antonio Iguanas. Partnering with the Florida Panthers, the Spurs bought the dormant Adirondack Red Wings franchise and moved it to San Antonio. Following the acquisition of an AHL franchise, local investment for the Iguanas quickly dissipated, and the CHL franchise folded. Originally, the team was to be named the San Antonio Stampede. However, when a local semipro football team objected, the name was changed to the Rampage.

On June 30, 2005, Spurs Sports &amp; Entertainment purchased the Panthers&#x27; interest in the franchise, assuming sole ownership of the AHL club. They also entered a multi-year affiliation agreement with the Phoenix Coyotes. On September 7, 2006, the Rampage unveiled their new uniforms with the official colors now being black, white and silver (the same motif used by the Spurs, as well as other Spurs-owned teams). While the primary and secondary logos remain the same, the crest of the jerseys now displayed just the bull&#x27;s head.

On April 11, 2007, the Coyotes announced that they had fired Rampage general manager Laurence Gilman, who had been with the Coyotes organization for 13 years. On November 23, 2009, the Phoenix Coyotes fired Greg Ireland. He was replaced by assistant coach Ray Edwards; Mike Pelino was named assistant coach. Ray Edwards was officially named head coach of the San Antonio Rampage prior to the 2010â11 season.

After the 2010â11 AHL season, the Coyotes came to an agreement with the Portland Pirates to be their new AHL affiliate, and San Antonio became Florida&#x27;s top affiliate for a second time.

In the 2011â12 season, the Rampage finished with a record of 41â30â3â2, good for 87 points to qualify for the sixth playoff seed in the Western Conference. They faced the third-seeded Chicago Wolves in the first round, taking Game 1 and Game 2 at home to take a 2â0 series lead in the best-of-five series. They then lost to the Wolves in Games 3 and 4 in Chicago, leading to a Game 5. In Game 5, the Rampage took a 2â0 lead, but the Wolves rallied to tie the game, sending it into overtime. After 25 minutes of overtime, San Antonio winger Bill Thomas passed to center Jon Matsumoto, feeding defenceman Roman Derlyuk to score the series winning goal on his belly to secure the first series win in franchise history for the Rampage. The goal is known to many fans as the Goal Heard Round the Alamo, and is considered the most important in Rampage history.

On March 18, 2015, the Florida Panthers announced they had entered into an affiliation agreement with the Portland Pirates to begin in the 2015â16 season, thus ending the Panthers&#x27; second term as San Antonio&#x27;s NHL affiliate. On April 17, 2015, it was announced that the Rampage had come to a five-year affiliation agreement with the Colorado Avalanche.

During the 2017 off-season, it was reported that the Avalanche would promote its ECHL affiliate, the Colorado Eagles, to the AHL in 2018 while the Rampage would officially affiliate with the St. Louis Blues beginning with the 2018â19 AHL season. For the 2017â18 season, as the Blues did not have an official AHL affiliate after the Vegas Golden Knights partnered with their former affiliate, both the Avalanche and Blues would send AHL prospects to the Rampage.

On February 6, 2020, the Vegas Golden Knights announced it had purchased the franchise from the Spurs with the intent to relocate it to the Las Vegas area. The purchase and relocation was approved by the league on February 28. The team initially played at the Orleans Arena in Paradise, Nevada, while the club&#x27;s new 6,000-seat arena, named Dollar Loan Center, was constructed in downtown Henderson, Nevada.

Their main rivals were the Texas Stars (located near Austin) and, from 2002 to 2013, the Houston Aeros.

<text>Alvise Cadamosto (surname cf. &quot;Ca&#x27; da Mosto, da Cadamosto, da Ca&#x27; da Mosto&quot;; also known in Portuguese as &quot;LuÃ­s Cadamosto&quot;; mononymously &quot;Cadamosto&quot;)(; )(c. 1432 â 16 July 1483) was a Venetian explorer and slave trader, who was hired by the Portuguese prince Henry the Navigator and undertook two known journeys to West Africa in 1455 and 1456, accompanied by the Genoese captain Antoniotto Usodimare. Some have credited Cadamosto and his companions with the discovery of the Cape Verde Islands and the points along the Guinea coast from the Gambia River to the Geba River (in Guinea-Bissau), the greatest leap in the Henrican discoveries since 1446. Cadamosto&#x27;s accounts of his journeys, including his detailed observations of West African societies, have proven invaluable to historians.

== Background ==

Alvise was born at the Ca&#x27; da Mosto, a palace on the Grand Canal of Venice from which his name derives. His father was Giovanni da Mosto, a Venetian civil servant and merchant, and his mother Elizabeth Querini, from a leading patrician family of Venice. Alvise was the eldest of three sons, having younger brothers Pietro and Antonio.

At a remarkably young age, Alvise was cast out as a merchant adventurer, sailing with Venetian galleys in the Mediterranean. From 1442 to 1448, Alvise undertook various trips on Venetian galleys to the Barbary Coast and Crete, as a commercial agent of his cousin, Andrea Barbarigo. In 1451, he was appointed noble officer of the marine corps of crossbowmen on a galley to Alexandria. The next year, he served the same position on a Venetian galley to Flanders. Upon his return, he found his family disgraced and dispossessed. His father, caught in a bribery scandal, had been banished from Venice, and taken refuge in the Duchy of Modena. His Querini relatives took the opportunity to seize possession of his family&#x27;s property. This setback marred the future prospects of Cadamosto&#x27;s career in Venice, and probably encouraged his spirit of adventure, hoping to restore his family name and fortune with great feats of his own.

== Expeditions to Africa ==

In August 1454, at the age of 22, Alvise and his brother Antonio embarked on a Venetian merchant galley, captained by Marco Zen, destined for Flanders. On the outward journey, the galley was detained by bad weather near Cape St. Vincent, Portugal. While waiting for the weather to improve, the Portuguese Prince Henry the Navigator, who had his seat nearby at Sagres, dispatched a couple of his commercial agents, led by his secretary AntÃ£o GonÃ§alves and the local Venetian consul Patrizio di Conti, to interest the stranded Venetian merchants in opening trade contracts for sugar and other goods from the prince&#x27;s Madeira island. Informed by the visitors of Henry&#x27;s recent discoveries in Africa, Cadamosto, &quot;inflamed with the desire of visiting these newly discovered regions&quot;, immediately applied to Prince Henry at his residence at Raposeira to undertake an expedition on his behalf. Henry hired him on the spot.

(Note: the 16th-century Portuguese chronicler DamiÃ£o de GÃ³is, uniquely among historians, mistakenly asserted that Cadamosto&#x27;s encounter took place in 1444 rather that 1454. Given the eminence of GÃ³is, this erroneous dating has been cited by others, and has been a cause of much confusion for later histories and chronologies.)

=== First Journey (1455) ===

Alvise Cadamosto set out on 22 March 1455 on a 43-tonne caravel supplied by Prince Henry, with Vicente Dias as ship master He proceeded to Porto Santo and Madeira, and thereafter weaved his way through the Canary islands, making stops in La Gomera, El Hierro and La Palma before reaching the African coast around Cape Blanc. Cadamosto made note of the existence of the Portuguese factory-fort at Arguin, but does not seem to have stopped there himself.

Cadamosto cruised down the west African coast to the mouth of the Senegal River (which he calls the &quot;Rio do Senega&quot;, the first recorded use of that name.) He does not seem to have stopped here, his destination being further south, at an anchorage point along the Grande CÃ´te he called the &quot;Palma di Budomel&quot; (location uncertain, probably around Mboro, ). Cadamosto notes that this spot (or &quot;resgate&quot;) was already used by Portuguese traders. He dates that trade between the Portuguese and the Wolof people of the Senegal region was opened around 1450 (&quot;five years before I went on this voyage&quot;). This Latin translation was reprinted in Simon Grynaeus, &quot;Novus orbis regnorum et insularum veteribus incognitorum&quot;, 1532.

<text>Matthew Kiprotich Birir (born 5 July 1972) is a former athlete from Kenya and a winner of the 3000 m steeplechase at the 1992 Summer Olympics.

==Biography==
Born in Eldama Ravine, Matthew Birir started running, when he attended the famous St. Patrick&#x27;s High School in Iten, which has produced many great Kenyan runners.

==Career==
At the Barcelona Olympics, the main favourite was Patrick Sang. At the Olympic final, it was soon clear, that all the medals are going to Kenya. At the last lap, the 20-year-old Birir outsprinted his older countryman Sang to win a gold 0.69 seconds ahead of latter.

At the 1993 World Championships Birir was fourth, behind Italian Alessandro Lambruschini, who repeated this feat three years later at the 1996 Summer Olympics, where Birir had to settle again for fourth place.

<text>Abraham or Abram Robertson FRS (4 November 1751 â 4 December 1826), was a Scottish mathematician and astronomer. He held the Savilian Chair of Geometry at the University of Oxford from 1797 to 1809.

Robertson was born at Duns, Berwickshire, the son of Abraham Robertson, âa man of humble stationâ. He attended school at Great Ryle in Northumberland, and later at Duns. At age 24, he moved to London, he had hopes of travelling to the East Indies, but his patron died. During the 1770s, Robertson completed a Bachelor of Arts and Master in Arts.

<doc id="1034056" wikidata="Q1967852" url="?curid=1034056" title="National Women's Hall of Fame">
<text>The National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame (NWHF) is an American institution founded to honor and recognize women. It was incorporated in 1969 in Seneca Falls, New York, and first inducted honorees in 1973. As of 2024, the Hall has honored 312 inductees.

Inductees are nominated by members of the public and selected by a panel of judges on the basis of the changes attributed to the honoree, that affect the social, economic or cultural aspects of society; the significant national or global impact; as well as, the enduring value of their achievements. Induction ceremonies are held every odd- numbered year in the fall, with the names of the women to be honored announced earlier in the spring, usually during March, Women&#x27;s History Month.

The NWHF is a private 501(c)(3) non-profit organization funded by philanthropy, admissions, and other income. In July 2021, Jennifer Gabriel was named executive director.

==Location==
The National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame was hosted by Eisenhower College until 1979/1980, when the organization rented out a historic bank building in the Seneca Falls Historic District. The historic bank was renovated to house the NWHF&#x27;s permanent exhibit, historical artifacts, and offices. In August 2020, the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame opened its door to the third and final home: the historic Seneca Knitting Mill, which resides across the canal of the Women&#x27;s Rights National Historical Park which includes the Wesleyan Chapel where the 1848 women&#x27;s rights convention took place, an event that kickstarted the women&#x27;s rights movement in America. This renovation and move into the historic Seneca Knitting Mill took several years to accomplish. 

In 2014, the organization&#x27;s board undertook a $20 million capital campaign to fund the development of the 1844 Seneca Knitting Mill, which is associated with the abolitionist movement and with the birthplace of women&#x27;s rights. The move and completion of Phase 1 doubled the size of the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. campaigning for Phase 2: an elevator, additional staircase, and other renovations was underway. Once the Homecoming Campaign is complete, the historic Seneca Knitting Mill will quadruple the available space to , including exhibit space, offices, and meeting space for conferences, wedding receptions, and community events.

<doc id="1034057" wikidata="Q783871" url="?curid=1034057" title="Alchemist (band)">
<text>Alchemist was an Australian progressive metal band from Canberra whose style combined death metal, progressive rock, psychedelic, Eastern, Aboriginal and electronic influences. The band formed in 1987 and released six studio albums, an EP and a compilation album. Work began on a new EP in 2010 but the band went on an indefinite hiatus and then split up. They are the only group to appear at every Metal for the Brain festival, an event they ran and organised from 1996. Alchemist also played at the Big Day Out and toured Europe several times.

==History==
===1987â1992===
Alchemist was formed in 1987 by Adam Agius (lead vocals/guitar) as a death metal act. The band released a demo the same year entitled &quot;Eternal Wedlock&quot;. The band&#x27;s style was raw and undeveloped, and began to evolve with the addition of new drummer Rodney Holder in 1989. The following year, the line-up of Agius, Holder, Andrew Meredith (guitar) and James Preece (bass) recorded a second demo. The demo showed the beginning of the band&#x27;s experimentation with avant-garde arrangements and psychedelic influences inspired by the likes of Pink Floyd and Frank Zappa. Another demo was produced in 1991, with Preece replaced by John (The Seal) Bray from another local band called Exceed. Alchemist also performed at the first Metal for the Brain festival in Canberra, eventually becoming the only group to feature at every occasion. The track &quot;Escapism&quot; from the demo recording was featured the following year on the Roadrunner (Australia) compilation album &quot;Redrum&quot;, which included other rising metal acts of the time such as Sadistik Exekution, Allegiance, and Shihad.

===1992â1996===
In 1992, Roy Torkington joined Alchemist in place of Meredith. By this time the demos had created enough interest for them to be approached by Austrian label Lethal, who released their first album, &quot;Jar of Kingdom&quot;, the next year. The album was recorded in Sydney and featured an eclectic mixture of death metal, grindcore and psychedelia. Two songs featured vocals from Michelle Klemke, a friend of Agius&#x27; mother. According to the notes accompanying the 2005 compilation album &quot;Embryonics&quot;, Agius lost his voice during the recording. Dissatisfied with the sound of the album, the band re-mastered and re-released it in 1999. Alchemist was also dissatisfied with Lethal&#x27;s handling of &quot;Jar of Kingdom&quot; and soon parted ways with them. After releasing &quot;Jar of Kingdom&quot;, the band went on their first tour.

During 1994, Alchemist recorded a promotional tape to shop to record companies and a version of the Venom song &quot;Black Metal&quot; for a Swedish tribute album called &quot;The Promoters of the Third World War: A Tribute to Venom&quot;, now a collector&#x27;s item. The band also began work on its next album, titled &quot;Lunasphere&quot;, which was released in 1995 by Melbourne label Shock Records through its subsidiary Thrust. &quot;Lunasphere&quot; showed a further development of Alchemist&#x27;s unusual style, adding Eastern motifs and keyboards to its already diverse style. The track &quot;Garden of Eroticism&quot; was added to the Triple J compilation album &quot;This Is Twelve&quot; (ABC/EMI) in 1996 and both this song and &quot;Yoni Kunda&quot; became live staples. The group supported the release of &quot;Lunasphere&quot; with a heavy touring schedule that included several shows with joint UK/Australian ambient act Deathless, a slot on the Sydney leg of the 1996 Big Day Out, supporting Cathedral and Paradise Lost on their dual headlining tour, and also opening for Fear Factory a second time. They performed live-to-air on the Triple J metal program &quot;Three Hours of Power&quot;. Two songs from this session would later be included on the &quot;Embryonics&quot; compilation album in 2005. During the same year, pioneering Canberra death metal band Armoured Angel disbanded. The band&#x27;s drummer Joel Green handed over the running of the festival to Holder, who with the rest of Alchemist was responsible for the event for the next decade.

===1996â2000===
Alchemist began recording &quot;Spiritech&quot; in late 1996. After enduring a problematic recording process, the band handed production over to D.W. Norton, the guitarist with Melbourne band Superheist and the part-owner of Back Beach Studios in Rye, Victoria. &quot;Spiritech&quot; introduced more electronic elements as well as tribal rhythms and heavy sampling into the band&#x27;s &quot;oeuvre&quot; and opened with the sprawling nine-minute &quot;Chinese Whispers&quot;, which remains a particular favourite for group and fans alike.

In 1999, the band&#x27;s next project was an EP that featured as its title track a version of &quot;Eve of the War&quot;, the opening piece from the 1978 production, &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s Musical Version of The War of the Worlds&quot;. Josh Nixon from Canberra doom metal band, Pod People featured as a guest guitarist. The EP also included live versions of &quot;Yoni Kunda&quot; and &quot;Chinese Whispers&quot;, an electronica remix of &quot;Yoni Kunda&quot; retitled as &quot;Koni Yunda&quot; and two &quot;Jar of Kingdom&quot; tracks, &quot;Brumal: A View from Pluto&quot; and &quot;Worlds within Worlds.&quot; These last two were a precursor to the band&#x27;s re-release of &quot;Jar of Kingdom&quot; the following year. This re-release included some new overdubs as the album&#x27;s original master tapes were damaged, and included the 1991 demo in its entirety. This release completed their contractual obligation to Shock Records and Alchemist began to shop for a new local deal as well as international distribution. The group&#x27;s albums had attained a heavy cult following in parts of Europe, particularly in the Netherlands, but they had not had European representation since their failed association with Lethal. In the meantime, Alchemist toured with Entombed and Pitchshifter.

Late in 1999, a new Alchemist track called &quot;Austral Spectrum&quot; appeared on a compilation of Australian metal called &quot;Under the Southern Cross&quot; and issued by Sydney label Chatterbox Records (with whom the band had just signed for Australian release). A slightly different version of the song then appeared on the &quot;Organasm&quot; album, again recorded with D.W. Norton in Rye and released in early 2000. To promote &quot;Organasm&quot;, Alchemist undertook a three-month Australian tour during autumn. Billed as &quot;World War Three&quot;, the tour also featured Sydney thrash bands Cryogenic and Psi.Kore, both of whom had also just released CDs. &quot;Organasm&quot; featured a warmer sound and a focus on tighter songwriting with tracks embellished even more by duelling slide guitars, keyboards and samples.

===2000â2005===
Following 2000&#x27;s Metal for the Brain, Alchemist went off the road for more than a year to work on &quot;Austral Alien&quot;, which was released by Chatterbox in May 2003. This latest album showed a mellower side of Alchemist, with highly polished production and a heavily electronic sound. Influenced by the rock band Midnight Oil, the lyrics of the semi-conceptual album focused on environmental issues affecting their country, specifically the impact of man on the ecology. Alchemist added a fifth member, Nick Wall, to provide samples during live shows.

In late 2004, Alchemist embarked on their first tour outside of Australia. Because of these commitments, Metal for the Brain was held off until February 2005. In the same month Alchemist won their first Australian Heavy Metal Music Awards, with &quot;First Contact&quot; awarded Best Video Clip, and Agius awarded Best Keyboardist.

===2005â2010===
A compilation album, &quot;Embryonics&quot;, was released in October 2005. It covered material recorded between 1990 and 1998, including tracks from the first three albums, the 1998 EP release and demo songs. Bonus tracks included two of the songs recorded on the radio in 1996. The band also announced a companion DVD release due for 2006, which, however, is yet to be released.

After ten years of successfully organising Metal for the Brain, Alchemist laid the festival to rest, playing the final event on 4 November 2006. Holder, now based in Brisbane, moved on to organise the 20-band Abducted Metal Horror Festival held in July 2007. In May of that year Alchemist completed work on their next album &quot;Tripsis&quot;, which the band declared to be a return to the earlier sound of &quot;Lunasphere&quot; and &quot;Spiritech&quot;. To coincide with the release of &quot;Tripsis&quot;, Alchemist headlined the European ProgPower event and played selected other dates. In July 2008 the band played at the Graspop Metal Meeting in Belgium as part of their European tour. In October 2008, Alchemist returned to Australia to tour with Meshuggah. Afterwards, the band premiered the video for &quot;Tongues and Knives&quot; on 9 December. In January 2010 Alchemist began recording a new EP as a follow-up to &quot;Tripsis&quot;. In an article in Sydney&#x27;s &quot;Drum Media&quot; in July, drummer Rodney Holder claimed that Alchemist was currently on &quot;extended hiatus&quot;. The band&#x27;s website reflected this with a splash page declaring that &quot;Alchemist are hibernating indefinitely&quot;. Holder went on to create and run a new heavy music festival named Bastardfest, inaugural shows held on 28 August in Brisbane, 4 September in Melbourne, and 16 October in Perth.

Adam Agius formed the Levitation Hex in 2010 with Mark Palfreyman of Melbourne band Alarum. They released a self-titled album in August 2012, during which time Agius talked about the hard work of being in a band, and Alchemist&#x27;s eventual demise.

In 2013, just before the birth of his first child, Rodney Holder started the &#x27;Music Business Facts&#x27; podcast, aimed at sharing tricks of the trade in interviews with successful musicians and music professionals from all over the world. He also ran a number of high-profile artist webinars and online music and production courses with artists like Devin Townsend.

Rodney Holder currently lives with his wife and two children in Brisbane.

<text>The 1921 [[Copa AmÃ©rica|South American Championship]] was the fifth continental championship for nations in South America. It was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, from 2 to 30 October 1921.

The participating countries were Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay (which debuted in this edition) and Uruguay. Chile was also invited but withdrew before the draw due to internal dissent, and an invitation was sent to Argentine dissident AsociaciÃ³n Amateurs de Football that originated a conflict with the Argentine Football Association (the official local governing body and organiser of the competition).

Argentina won the tournament, being also its first official title, after several friendly competitions won such as Copa Lipton or Copa Newton.

==Squads==
For a complete list of participating squads see: &quot;1921 South American Championship squads&quot;

==Venues==
== History ==
=== Background ===
The tournament was marked by the strong dispute between the Argentine Football Association (AFA) and dissident AsociaciÃ³n Amateurs de Football (AAmF, formed one year before). The AAmF had received an invitation from the Football Federation of Chile to play a tournament in that country. Most of the &quot;Big Five&quot; (with the exception of Boca Juniors) were affiliated to AAmF, which had 20 teams competing in their own championship. After the AAmF accepted the invitation, some of its most prominent players trip to Chile by train. Manuel Seoane, Humberto Recanatini, Luis CÃ©lico, CÃ¡ndido GarcÃ­a, AlbÃ©rico Zabaleta, were among them. The invitation was taken as a pure provocation by the AFA, which requested South American Football Confederation (CSF) the FFCh to be punished.

Being aware that they could receive a punishment, the FFCh retired its team from the competition so Chile did not attended the cup. Brazil did not include &quot;Paulista&quot; players (only &quot;Cariocas&quot;) due to a strong conflict, similar to what happened in Argentina. Paraguay arrived in Buenos Aires via Rosario, where the squad played some friendly matches v Newell&#x27;s Old Boys and Tiro Federal. As a curious fact, it is worth mentioned that the Paraguayan ship also brought Rosarian players Ernesto Celli, Gabino Sosa, and Julio Libonatti (called up for Argentina) to Buenos Aires.

On 29 September, there was a meeting where the Chilean case was debated. Argentine Minister of Foreign Affairs, Honorio PueyrredÃ³n, host the meeting, where the Paraguayan delegate complained about the few time to train before their debut, contrasting with other teams that would play their first matches with more time to rest. That was solved after Argentina and Brazil agreed to open the competition. Following that discussion, the Chilean representative stated that the invitation sent to AAmF had to be seen as &quot;a step forward to the reunification of Argentine football&quot;. On the other hand, the Uruguayan representative threatened to suspend the competition in case of Chile was penalised. After the other delegates supported the argument, Argentina was forced to accept those conditions and the competition was held with no punishment for Chile.

The AAmF ignored the competition, with its Primera DivisiÃ³n championship running at the same time that Campeonato Sudamericano. In fact, the 35th. round was scheduled for 30 October, the same day as the final match where Argentina crowned champion.

=== Tournament ===

The inaugural match between Argentina and Brazil was attended by 30,000 spectators (although the maximum capacity of Estadio Sportivo Barracas was 22,000) due to reselling ticket for twice or more its original value. Brazil came into the field with no black players because they had been banned after a &quot;suggestion&quot; from the President of Brazil, EpitÃ¡cio Pessoa. Therefore Arthur Friedenreich, considered the first star of Brazilian football, was not part of that team. Argentina won 1â0 with a goal scored by Julio Libonatti.

There was great expectations for the final match between Argentina and Uruguay. SebastiÃ¡n GarcÃ­a, president of Liga Rosarina de Football, made the arrangements for people to attend the match travelling from Rosario to Buenos Aires, with tickets at low prices. Near 3,000 people from Rosario travelled to support fellow citizens Julio Libonatti, Blas Saruppo, Adolfo Celli and Florindo Bearzotti. The train departed at 6 a.m., returning to Rosario at 6 p.m.

To take pressure off the players, Argentine executives carried them to a training camp in Tigre, Buenos Aires Province. Bocce, fishing and music were some of the activities during their time there.
The Friday before the final, while the Uruguayan players played basketball in their camp in Vicente LÃ³pez, the Argentine executives moved the players from Tigre to a hotel in Buenos Aires downtown, where they were strictly controlled. No one could escape from there, although the duo Carlos GardelâJosÃ© Razzano were performing at Teatro Esmeralda, not far from the hotel.
The championship received wide media coverage, especially from &quot;CrÃ­tica&quot;, a newspaper founded and directed by Natalio Botana which increased its sales to become the most selling newspaper in Argentina. Botana would be then preside the AFA for a brief period in 1926. The newspaper took on a critical position regarding the AAmF and its leaders, sometimes in very harsh terms, even calling them &quot;cretins&quot;.

The final was attended by near 40,000 people, who were at the stadium three hours prior to the start. Argentina beat Uruguay 1â0 in the last match and won the competition after earning the most points (6 in 3 games). When the match ended, the players of both teams were raised by the crowd that had entered to the pitch and carried them to the hotel where the Argentine stayed during the competition, sited on the corner of Florida and Cangallo streets.

Argentina won all the games without conceding any goal, helped by the good performance of goalkeeper AmÃ©rico Tesoriere, one of the most notable footballers of the team along with Julio Libonatti, who scored three goals (one per match).

== Aftermath ==

The large number of people who attended the matches at Sportivo Barracas and the celebrations after the victory consolidated football as a popular passion throughout the country.

The South American championship was also a commercial success, with $147,033 income from ticket sales and a $15,000 donation from the Buenos Aires City Council against total expenses of $113,801; this gave a profit of $48,232, a substantial sum at a time when football was still amateur in Argentina.
