<text>Xiao Qian (27 January 1910 – 11 February 1999), alias Ruoping (), was a famous essayist, editor, journalist and translator from China. His life spanned the country&#x27;s history before and after the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
Xiao was born on 27 January 1910 in Beijing. His name at birth was Xiao Bingqian (). He was born into a sinicized Mongol family. His father died before his birth, leaving only his mother to raise him. His mother died when he was seven, and he was sent to live with his cousins.

===School days===
In 1917, at the age of 7, Xiao entered the Chongshi School (). It was a church school run by European missionaries. He took up part-time jobs to pay the tuition fees (e.g. weaving Turkish rugs, delivering milk and mimeographing lecture notes in the school administration office). He worked in the morning and studied in the afternoon. In summer 1924, about half a year before completing junior middle school, he worked as a trainee in Beixin Press bookstore. This sparked his interest in literature. In the same year he joined the Communist Youth League.

In 1931 Xiao enrolled at Fu Jen Catholic University. Together with an American youth William Allen he published a magazine in English &quot;China in Brief&quot; (中國簡報, &quot;Zhōngguó Jiǎnbào&quot;). It presented works of famous authors such as Lu Xun, Mao Dun, Guo Moruo, Wen Yiduo and Yu Dafu. Due to insufficient funding the magazine ended after eight issues, but it influenced the foreign readers in Beijing. In this period he became a student of Shen Congwen, who greatly influenced Xiao&#x27;s early writings.

In 1933 Xiao entered the Faculty of English in Yenching University and in autumn of the same year he switched to the Faculty of Journalism. His teacher was an American journalist Edgar Snow. Snow encouraged him to use various literary techniques in journalistic reporting, which became characteristic to Xiao&#x27;s writing. He graduated in June 1936 and continued the studies as a postgraduate student at Cambridge University. Soon after he became a lecturer at University College London.

===Life in England===
In 1939, at the age of 28, Xiao Qian returned to England to work as an instructor in modern Chinese language for the School of Oriential and African Studies (SOAS) in London. SOAS was moved to Cambridge when Germany began the devastating bombing campaign Blitz.

Xiao Qian was politically active and made regular speeches for the China Campaign Committee, a left-wing group which campaigned against the Japanese occupation in China.

===Marriage and family===
He married four times. In 1936 he met his first wife Wang Shucang () while working on the Shanghai edition of the &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot;. The couple only stayed together for two years before he fell in love with another woman during his stay in Hong Kong. They had an extramarital son born in 1948. Xiao tried to get a divorce, but Wang opposed it and as a result Xiao Qian left China for England.

In 1954, Xiao married his fourth wife, Wen Jieruo (). They had two sons and a daughter. On 30 January 1955 the daughter Xiao Lizi () was born.

===Later years===
During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) Xiao Qian was regarded by the Chinese Communist Party as right wing and was banished to the countryside. In 1968 he tried to commit suicide. In 1978 he received a redress as one of the mishandled cases. In 1979 he was a resident in the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa.

In 1999 Xiao Qian died at the age of 89 of myocardial infarction and renal failure in Beijing.

==Personal life==
Xiao had a child named Xiao Tiezhu () with Xie Gewen ().

Xiao married translator Wen Jieruo in the spring of 1954, the couple has two sons and a daughter. Their daughter Xiao Lizi () was born on 30 January 1955. Their son, Xiao Tong (), was born on November 10, 1956. All of her children are living in the United States.

==Major works of journalism==

===Feature articles===
Between the 1940s and the 1990s, Xiao wrote many famous articles. Many of his published feature reports are distinctive for their combination of news-accuracy and literary style of writing.

The early reports are considered of great historical value by the academic community in China and are currently in the care of the Chinese Literature Society. Most of Xiao&#x27;s featured reports were based on first hand experience from the front line. He selected scenes that he believed would reflect society at that time. He also used contour drawing to vividly depict events, display emotions, and illustrate the story for the reader. His work acts like a camera, capturing moments of real life. Not only did his reports offer insights into the harsh realities of the time, they also reflected his deep sentiments toward his country and its people.

===Wartime writings===
The following books were written between 1939 and 1946 and reflected Xiao Qian&#x27;s experience during the Second World War while he was living in the United Kingdom and Western Europe:

#Symphony of Contradictions
#Bloody September
#London under Silver Kites

These works were mostly concerned with the day-to-day life of ordinary English citizens. They contained an analysis or speculation about political and military matters. While he was impressed by the determination of the English to defeat Germany, he also observed their negative cultural traits.

==Major works of literature==

===Popular publications===
As a journalist, he wrote a variety of publications. One of them is his book: &quot;xin bian wen shi biji cong shu&quot; (). The series contains 50 books, in which 6,000,000 words were written. These series were written between the 1980s and early 1990s. The books collected a range of anecdotes and highlights from over 2000 celebrities and researchers. The series became highly reputable and widely accepted when it was released. As the last volume of the series published in October 1994, another edition of the series were published in Hong Kong and Taiwan shortly after. The work was awarded the &quot;Chinese Book Prize&quot; in 1993.

===Essays===
In addition to his books Xiao also wrote several notable essays.

Though Xiao wrote no more than 20 essays, they played a very important role in the development of Chinese essay history. All his works were published under the name of &quot;Tatamulin&quot;, an exiled Latvian merchant, between the years 1946 and 1948. His essays were satirical and often contained criticisms of contemporary political issues at that time.

His essays also include a considerable amount of poetry which express his strong feelings toward China at that time. The sole purpose of all his essays was to end the political dictatorship of the Kuomintang in China, and thus promote a peaceful, democratic Utopia. His magnum opus is &quot;Long talk by red hair&quot; (红毛长谈, &quot;hóngmáo chángtán&quot;). In the polarised political climate of that time in China, his two essays — &quot;Ease, tolerance &amp; personnel work&quot; () and &quot;Why do people&#x27;s presses become the government offices?&quot; () — caused him to be labelled a rightist in 1957.

===Translations===
Apart from his work as a journalist and a writer, Xiao also translated important works of European literature into Mandarin Chinese. He translated several books and plays by William Shakespeare, Stephen Leacock and Henrik Ibsen. These were widely published in mainland China and Taiwan.

In 1990, as invited by Nanjing YiLin Publication (), he translated &quot;Ulysses&quot; by James Joyce into Mandarin, assisted by his wife Wen Jieruo, who was fluent in both English and Japanese. When the book was released in 1994, it became a surprise best-seller in China. Because of this, he received the Caihong Translation Prize () and the Best Foreign Literature Book-First Class ().

== Beliefs ==

===As an author===
Xiao views were shaped by the poverty and hardships of his childhood. He witnessed the suffering of the lower classes at first hand. His reports attempted to address the injustices and disparity in Chinese society.

Xiao strongly believed that the truth is what moves people, and his writings often encouraged his readers to come to their own conclusions. His writings &quot;Lu Xi Liu Ming Tu&quot; () and &quot;Lin Yan Fa Ru Yu&quot; () best illustrate his beliefs.

===As a journalist===
Xiao entered the field of journalism in April 1935. He first worked for Tianjin&#x27;s &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot;, where he published his early writings including his first novel, as an editor for &quot;Literary Arts&quot; (). In 1936, he moved to Shanghai to prepare for the publication of Shanghai&#x27;s Takung Pao. Then in 1938, when full-scale war against the Japanese broke out in China, Xiao was offered a job by the &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; in Hong Kong to work as an editor and journalist.

Later in 1939, he traveled to London, and continued his job as a journalist for &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; until 1946. While the British took part in the Second World War, he gave up his place at the University of Cambridge in 1944, and became the only Chinese war correspondent in Western Europe.

As World War II came to an end, he produced a number of reportages such as &quot;Symphony of Contradictions,&quot; &quot;Bloody September&quot; and &quot;London under Silver Kites&quot;, which all reflected the (often harsh) reality during wartime. Thereafter, he worked for several newspaper companies such as the English version of &quot;People&#x27;s China&quot; ().

While being a journalist in the World War II, Xiao entered Rhine with the 7th troop of the Allied Forces. When the Allied Forces entered Berlin, Xiao was one of the first journalists who entered the city. He attended and collected news from the Potsdam Conference in July 1945, which was one of the most significant conferences marking the end of the World War II.

In May 1945, Xiao gained fame after writing a piece of exclusive news about Vyacheslav Molotov inviting T. V. Soong to sign the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance during his trip to San Francisco while reporting on the United Nations Conference. He was also involved in the reporting of the trials of Nazis in Nuremberg, Germany.

== Literary friends ==
According to Xiao&#x27;s autobiography, he met the English novelist E.M. Forster, on 9 May 1941 at the Tagore Memorial Meeting. The event was organized by the English PEN Club. The two became very close friends and often exchanged letters. They disagreed with each other over the issue of homosexuality (Xiao was opposed to legalization).

The friendship, however, did not last. Xiao, fearing for the safety of his family during the Cultural Revolution, destroyed all the letters he had received from Forster and asked Forster not to contact him again. Because Forster might have assumed that Xiao was ignoring him, he burned some of the letters he had kept as a memento of their friendship.

<text>A benefice () or living is a reward received in exchange for services rendered and as a retainer for future services. The Roman Empire used the Latin term  as a benefit to an individual from the Empire for services rendered. Its use was adopted by the Western Church in the Carolingian era as a benefit bestowed by the crown or church officials. A benefice specifically from a church is called a precaria (pl. &quot;precariae&quot;), such as a stipend, and one from a monarch or nobleman is usually called a fief. A benefice is distinct from an allod, in that an allod is property owned outright, not bestowed by a higher authority.

==Catholic Church==

===Roman imperial origins===
In ancient Rome a &quot;benefice&quot; was a gift of land (precaria) for life as a reward for services rendered, originally, to the state. The word comes from the Latin noun &quot;beneficium&quot;, meaning &quot;benefit&quot;.

=== Carolingian era ===

In the 8th century, using their position as Mayor of the Palace, Charles Martel, Carloman I and Pepin III usurped a large number of church benefices for distribution to vassals, and later Carolingians continued this practice as emperors. These estates were held in return for oaths of military assistance, which greatly aided the Carolingians in consolidating and strengthening their power. Charlemagne (emperor 800–814) continued the late Roman concept of granting benefices in return for military and administrative service to his empire. Thus, the imperial structure was bound together through a series of oaths between the monarch and the recipient of land (and the resulting income) (see Fief). He ordered and administered his kingdom and later his empire through a series of published statutes called capitularies. The Capitulary of Herstal (AD 779) distinguished between his vassals who were styled &quot;casati&quot; (sing. &quot;casatus&quot;) and &quot;non-casati&quot;, that is those subjects who had received a benefice from the hand of the king and those who had not, and

In the year 800 Pope Leo III placed the crown of Holy Roman Emperor on the head of Charlemagne. This act caused great turmoil for future generations, who would afterward argue that the emperor thereby received his position as a &quot;benefice&quot; from the papacy. In his March 1075 &quot;Dictatus Papae&quot;, Pope Gregory VII declared that only the pope could depose an emperor, which implied that he could do so just as a lord might take a benefice away from a vassal. This declaration inflamed Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and furthered the friction caused in the Investiture Conflict.

===Middle Ages===
The expanded practice continued through the Middle Ages within the European feudal system. This same customary method became adopted by the Catholic Church.

The church&#x27;s revenue streams came from, amongst other things, rents and profits arising from assets gifted to the church, its endowment, given by believers, be they monarch, lord of the manor or vassal, and later also upon tithes calculated on the sale of the product of the people&#x27;s personal labour in the entire parish such as cloth or shoes and the people&#x27;s profits from specific forms of likewise God-given, natural increase such as crops and in livestock.

Initially the Catholic Church granted buildings, grants of land and greater and/or lesser tithes for life but the land was not alienated from the dioceses. The Synod of Lyon of 567 annexed these grants to the churches. By the time of the Council of Mainz of 813 these grants were known as &quot;beneficia&quot;.

Holding a benefice did not necessarily imply a cure of souls although each benefice had a number of spiritual duties attached to it. For providing these duties, a priest would receive &quot;temporalities&quot;.

Benefices were used for the worldly support of much of its pastoral clergy – clergy gaining rewards for carrying out their duties with rights to certain revenues, the &quot;fruits of their office&quot;. The original donor of the temporalities or his nominee, the patron and his successors in title, held the advowson (right to nominate a candidate for the post subject to the approval of the bishop or other prelate as to the candidate&#x27;s sufficiency for the demands of the post).

Parish priests were charged with the spiritual and temporal care of their congregation. The community provided for the priest as necessary, later, as organisation improved, by tithe (which could be partially or wholly lost to a temporal lord or patron but relief for that oppression could be found under canon law).
Some individual institutions within the church accumulated enormous endowments and, with that, temporal power. These endowments sometimes concentrated great wealth in the mortmain (&quot;dead hand&quot;) of the church, so called because it endured beyond any individual&#x27;s life. The church was exempt from some or all taxes. This was in contrast to feudal practice where the nobility would hold land on grant from the king in return for service, especially service in war. This meant that the church over time gained a large share of land in many feudal states and so was a cause of increasing tension between the church and the Crown.

=== Pluralism ===
The holder of more than one benefice, later known as a pluralist, could keep the revenue to which he was entitled and pay lesser sums to deputies to carry out the corresponding duties.

By a Decree of the Lateran Council of 1215 no clerk could hold two benefices with cure of souls, and if a beneficed clerk took a second benefice with cure of souls, he vacated &quot;ipso facto&quot; his first benefice. Dispensations could easily be obtained from Rome.

The benefice system was open to abuse. Acquisitive prelates occasionally held multiple major benefices. The holding of more than one benefice is termed &quot;pluralism&quot; (unrelated to the political theory of the same name). An English example was Stigand, Archbishop of Canterbury (1052–72).

After the Reformation, the new denominations generally adopted systems of ecclesiastical polity that did not entail benefices and the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) called &quot;for the abandonment or reform of the system of benefices&quot;.

===French Revolution===
The French Revolution replaced France&#x27;s system by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy following debates and a report headed by Louis-Simon Martineau in 1790, confiscating all endowments of the church, which was until then the highest order (&quot;premier ordre&quot;) of the Ancien Régime; instead, the state awarded a salary to the formerly endowment-dependent clergy, and abolished canons, prebendaries and chaplains. This constitution kept the separation between the nomination (advowson) and the canonical institution (benefice/living, which conferred a jurisdiction) but the state set a fixed system of salaries and would elect the metropolitan bishops who in turn would elect the curates.

Parts of these changes remain such as the abolition of the three historic roles mentioned, and the constitution is still in force in Belgium.

==Church of England==

The term benefice, according to the canon law, denotes an ecclesiastical office (but not always a cure of souls) in which the incumbent is required to perform certain duties or conditions of a spiritual kind (spiritualities) while being supported by the revenues attached to the office (temporalities).

The spiritualities of parochial benefices, whether rectories, vicarages or perpetual curacies, include due observation of the ordination vows and due solicitude for the moral and spiritual welfare of the parishioners. The temporalities are the revenues of the benefice and assets such as the church properties and possessions within the parish.

By keeping this distinction in mind, the right of patronage in the case of parochial benefices, or advowson, appears logical, being the right originally vested in the donor of the temporalities to present to his bishop a clerk to be admitted, if found fit by the bishop, to the office to which those temporalities are annexed. In other words, the gift of the glebe (a rectory manor or church furlong) was only ever granted subject to receiving an incorporeal hereditament (inheritable and transferable right) for the original donor.

Nomination or presentation on the part of the patron of the benefice is thus the first requisite in order that a clerk should become legally entitled to a benefice. The next requisite is that he should be admitted by the bishop as a fit person for the spiritual office to which the benefice is annexed, and the bishop is the judge of the sufficiency of the clerk to be so admitted.

===Parochial clergy suitability===
Under the early constitutions of the Church of England a bishop was allowed a space of two months to inquire and inform himself of the sufficiency of every presentee, but by the 95th of the Canons of 1604 that interval was reduced to 28 days, within which the bishop must admit or reject the clerk. If the bishop rejects the clerk within that time he is liable to a &quot;duplex querela&quot; (Latin: &quot;double complaint&quot;, the procedure in ecclesiastical law for challenging a bishop&#x27;s refusal to admit a presentee to a benefice) in the ecclesiastical courts or to a &quot;quare impedit&quot; in the common law courts, and the bishop must then certify the reasons of his refusal.

In the rare cases where the patron happens to be a clergyman (&quot;a clerk in orders&quot;) and wishes to be admitted to the benefice of his own advowson, he must proceed by way of petition instead of by &quot;deed of presentation&quot;, reciting that the benefice is in his own patronage, and petitioning the bishop to examine him and admit him.

Upon the bishop having satisfied himself of the sufficiency of the clerk, he proceeded to institute him to the spiritual office to which the benefice is annexed, but before such institution could take place, the clerk had to make the declaration of assent, the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion and the Book of Common Prayer, take the oaths of allegiance and canonical obedience and make a declaration against simony. The first was laid down by the Canons of 1603/04 and modified by the Clerical Subscription Act 1865 which also prescribed the form of the declaration against simony; the words of the oath of allegiance accorded to the form in the Promissory Oaths Act 1868. Current practice is to make a declaration of assent to the doctrine and liturgical practice of the Church of England, and take the oaths of allegiance and canonical obedience as defined by Canons of the Church of England.

The bishop, by the act of institution, commits to the presentee the cure of souls attached to the office to which the benefice is annexed. In cases where the bishop himself is patron of the benefice, no presentation or petition is required to be tendered by the clerk, but the bishop having satisfied himself of the sufficiency of the clerk, collates him to the benefice and office. A bishop need not personally institute or collate a clerk; he may issue a &quot;fiat&quot; to his vicar-general or to a special commissary for that purpose.

After the bishop or his commissary has instituted the presentee, he issues a mandate under seal, addressed to the archdeacon or some other neighbouring clergyman, authorizing him to induct the clerk into his benefice – in other words, to put him into legal possession of the temporalities, which is done by some outward form, and for the most part by delivery of the bell-rope to the presentee, who then tolls the church bell. This form of induction is required to give the clerk a legal title to his beneficium, although his admission to the office by institution is sufficient to vacate any other benefice which he may already possess.

A benefice is avoided or vacated
# by death;
# by resignation, if the bishop is willing to accept the resignation. (Before the introduction of the Church of England Pensions Board, by the Incumbents&#x27; Resignation Act 1871 (Amendment) Act 1887 (50 &amp; 51 Vict. c. 23), any clergyman who had been an incumbent of one benefice continuously for seven years, and became incapacitated by permanent mental or bodily infirmities from fulfilling his duties, could, if the bishop thought fit, have a commission appointed to consider the fitness of his resigning; and if the commission reported in favour, he could, with the consent of the patron (or, if that is refused, with the consent of the archbishop) resign the cure of souls into the bishop&#x27;s hands, and have assigned to him, out of the benefice, a retiring pension not exceeding one third of its annual value, recoverable as a debt from his successor);
# by cession, upon the clerk being instituted to another benefice or some other preferment incompatible with it;
# by deprivation and sentence of an ecclesiastical court; under the Clergy Discipline Act 1892 (55 &amp; 56 Vict. c. 32), an incumbent who has been convicted of offences against the law of bastardy, or against whom judgment has been given in a divorce or matrimonial cause, is deprived, and on being found guilty in the consistory court of immorality or ecclesiastical offences (not in respect of doctrine or ritual), he may be deprived or suspended or declared incapable of preferment;
# by act of law in consequence of simony;
# by default of the clerk in neglecting to read publicly in the church the Book of Common Prayer, and to declare his assent thereto within two months after his induction, pursuant to the Act of Uniformity 1662 (14 Cha. 2. c. 4);
# more recently, also on reaching statutory retirement age.

===Pluralities Act===

Dispensation, enabling a clerk to hold several ecclesiastical dignities or benefices at the same time, was transferred to the Archbishop of Canterbury by the Ecclesiastical Licences Act 1533, certain ecclesiastical persons having been declared by a previous statute (of 1529) to be entitled to such dispensations. The system of pluralities carried with it, as a direct consequence, systematic non-residence on the part of many incumbents, and delegation of their spiritual duties in respect of their cures of souls to &quot;assistant curates&quot;. The evils attendant on this system were found to be so great that the (1 &amp; 2 Vict. c. 106) was passed to abridge the holding of benefices in plurality, requiring that no person should hold under any circumstances more than two benefices and such privilege was subject to the restriction that both benefices must be within of each other.
By the (13 &amp; 14 Vict. c. 98) restrictions were further narrowed so that no spiritual person could hold two benefices except the churches of such benefices within of each other by the nearest road, and the annual value of one of such benefices did not exceed £100. By this statute the term &quot;benefice&quot; is defined to mean &quot;benefice with cure of souls&quot; and no other, and therein to comprehend all parishes, perpetual curacies, donatives, endowed public chapels, parochial chapelries and chapelries or districts belonging or reputed to belong, or annexed or reputed to be annexed, to any church or chapel.

The (48 &amp; 49 Vict. c. 54) superseded these and enacted that by dispensation from the Archbishop of Canterbury, two benefices can be held together, the churches of which are within of each other, and the annual value of one of which does not exceed £200.

===Current usage===
A benefice or living in the Church of England describes any ecclesiastical parish or group of ecclesiastical parishes under a single stipendiary minister, as well as its related historical meaning.

The term dates from the grant of benefices by bishops to clerks in holy orders as a reward for extraordinary services. The holder of a benefice owns the &quot;freehold&quot; of the post (the church and the parsonage house) for life.

Such a life freehold is now subject to certain constraints. To comply with European Regulations on atypical workers, the parson&#x27;s freehold is being phased out in favour of new conditions of service called &quot;common tenure&quot;.

Other unauthorized releases of some or all of the tracks on this recording include Runaround Ways, Introducing The Doobie Brothers, Still Smokin&#x27; and Excitement, among other titles. The covers of the releases commonly show pictures of later Doobie Brothers lineups, including members that don&#x27;t appear on the recording.

A later recording of &quot;Blue Jay&quot; (in a modified version) appears on the 1999 box set &quot;Long Train Runnin&quot;&#x27;. The melody &amp; chord changes for &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep On Givin&#x27;&quot; were later reworked on &quot;Another Park, Another Sunday&quot; (from &quot;What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits&quot;). None of the remaining songs on this collection appear on any official Doobie Brothers release in any form. Some CD releases of the demos erroneously swap the titles of &quot;Song to J.C.&quot; and &quot;Another Way.&quot; &quot;Tilted Park Crud Hunchery&quot; is unique in that it includes a short lead vocal by bassist Dave Shogren.

<doc id="1038383" wikidata="Q6765203" url="?curid=1038383" title="Marion G. Romney">
<text>Marion George Romney (September 19, 1897 – May 20, 1988) was an apostle and a member of the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

==Early life==
Romney was born in Colonia Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico, to expatriated parents, George S. Romney and Terressa Artemesia Romney ( Redd).

His cousin was Michigan governor George W. Romney, who was born in nearby Colonia Dublan. As such, he was the first cousin, once removed of Utah Senator and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney. 

Romney was the second of ten children. His younger sister, Lurlene Romney Cheney, later converted to Catholicism and entered a religious order as Sister Mary Catherine, a Carmelite nun at the Carmel of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in Holladay, Utah.

Romney studied at Academia Juárez until his family left Mexico in 1912, when violence from the ongoing Mexican revolution spread to their region. He lived with them for the remainder of his youth in California and Idaho. In 1917, the Romneys moved to Rexburg, Idaho, where his father became principal of Ricks Academy. Romney graduated valedictorian of Ricks high school in 1918.

From 1920 to 1923, Romney served as an LDS Church missionary in Australia. After returning, he worked in construction in Salt Lake City for his uncle, Gaskell Romney (father of George W. Romney).

==Higher education and family==
Romney studied at Brigham Young University (BYU) for a year. While there, he renewed his acquaintance with Ida Jensen, a former teacher at Ricks and then a post-graduate candidate at BYU. Romney and Jensen married September 12, 1924, in the Salt Lake Temple, officiated by Joseph Fielding Smith.

Romney next studied at the University of Utah, receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science and history in 1926. Romney studied law at the University of Utah, but did not complete course work there. He passed the Utah bar exam in 1929.

Romney and his wife had three children together; two died in infancy. Their son, George Jensen Romney, survived to adulthood. They also adopted a child, Richard Jensen Romney. George served an LDS Church mission. In April 1983, he delivered a General Conference sermon written by his father. Ida Romney died in 1979 at age 88.

==Church service and politics==
Romney first worked for the post office, and later became an assistant prosecuting attorney in Salt Lake City. In 1934, he successfully campaigned for the Utah House of Representatives as a Democrat. While campaigning, he was called as an LDS Church bishop by stake president Bryant S. Hinckley. After his election, his bishop ordination was delayed until after the legislature&#x27;s term in April 1935, with him seeking and serving only one term. While in the legislature, Romney helped author Utah&#x27;s liquor control law.

===General authority===

Romney&#x27;s 47 years as a general authority of the LDS Church began as one of the first five Assistants to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles called to the new position in 1941. In 1951, he was called to the Quorum of the Twelve. In 1960, Romney helped develop the home teaching program of the LDS Church.

In 1961, Romney was appointed area supervisor for the LDS Church in Mexico. Although he had lived his first fifteen years in Mexico, it was in the mainly American Mormon colonies, and he knew very little Spanish. Assisted by Eduardo Balderas in learning Spanish, Romney supervised the church&#x27;s growth in Mexico for the next eleven years. He oversaw construction of many meetinghouses in Mexico, along with organization of the first Spanish-language stakes in Mexico.

Romney became Second Counselor to church president Harold B. Lee in 1972.

Following Lee&#x27;s death the following year, Spencer W. Kimball became the church president and he retained Romney as the Second Counselor. As the First Presidency, Kimball, Tanner, and Romney announced the 1978 Revelation on Priesthood, canonized as &quot;Official Declaration 2&quot; in the Doctrine and Covenants.

When Kimball, Tanner, and Romney all aged and developed health problems at similar rates, Gordon B. Hinckley was added as an additional counselor in 1981. Upon Tanner&#x27;s death in 1982, Romney became First Counselor and Hinckley the Second Counselor, though Romney was relatively inactive in his position due to poor health. When Kimball died in 1985, press reports indicated that Romney had not been seen in public for many months.
Ezra Taft Benson, who had been President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, then became the church president and named Hinckley as First Counselor, with Thomas S. Monson as Second Counselor. Romney, as the apostle with the second-longest seniority in the church, became the quorum president. However, &quot;because President Romney’s health [kept] him from taking an active part in Church administration,&quot; Howard W. Hunter, the next in seniority, served as acting president.

Romney died from natural causes at his home in Salt Lake City at age 90. He served 47 years as a church general authority. Funeral services were held in the Salt Lake Tabernacle on May 23, 1988, presided over by Benson. Romney was buried at Wasatch Lawn Memorial Park in Salt Lake City, beside his wife, approximately 10 years after her death. The &quot;Deseret News Church Almanac&quot; remembered him as a &quot;renowned Church Welfare pioneer and Book of Mormon scholar&quot;.

<text>Marc Alexander is a New Zealand politician. He was elected to Parliament as a list MP for the United Future New Zealand party in 2002, and stood unsuccessfully as the National Party candidate for Wigram in 2008.

==Public activities==

Before entering politics, Alexander was a restaurateur in Christchurch, and also co-hosted a cooking program on local television. He authored &quot;From a Grasshut to the Beehive (2005)&quot; – a politically incorrect cookbook. He was also a spokesperson for the Sensible Sentencing Trust, a group which lobbies for reforms in the criminal justice system. He was then their Crime Prevention spokesperson.
After the 2005 general election, Alexander left the United Future Party, where many thought his atheistic, libertarian views clashed with the social conservatism of the majority (not to mention the willingness of the Party to support a Labour-led government). Although he voted against both the Prostitution Reform Act and the Civil Union Act (two pieces of legislation strongly opposed by Christian groups), he claims he did so due to concerns over the effects of the legislation as written, rather than any ideological opposition.

Since leaving the United Future Party, Alexander has been an involved member of the National Party in Christchurch. He served as Policy Chairman for Wigram, and also edited the Canterbury/Westland policy newsletter &#x27;Thinking National&#x27;. He was selected as the National Party candidate for Wigram in the 2008 general election, and was placed 61st on the party&#x27;s list. At this time he resigned his position with Sensible Sentencing, since the Trust&#x27;s rules require all spokespeople to be politically unaligned.

Alexander writes &quot;Marc My Words&quot;, an occasional political column, for the online New Zealand news website Scoop and has a daily political opinion spot on Coromandel FM called &#x27;Marc My Word&#x27;. He lives in Christchurch with his wife Angelika Frank-Alexander and son.

In June 2019 Alexander became the leader of the New NZ Party, founded by David Moffett.

<doc id="1038386" wikidata="Q1917925" url="?curid=1038386" title="My Dog Skip (film)">
<text>My Dog Skip is a 2000 American comedy-drama film, directed by Jay Russell and starring Frankie Muniz, Diane Lane, Luke Wilson, and Kevin Bacon, with narration by Harry Connick Jr. Based on the autobiographical book of the same name, the film tells the story of 9-year-old Willie Morris as he is given a Smooth Fox Terrier for his birthday and how the dog fundamentally changes several aspects of his life. &quot;My Dog Skip&quot; was released on January 12, 2000, by Warner Bros. and received generally positive reviews from critics. The film grossed $35.8 million on a $7 million budget.

==Plot==
Willie Morris looks back on the early 1940s and how it was colored by his dearly beloved dog, a Smooth Fox Terrier whom he had named Skip. Willie is a lonely boy with a gruff, proud father, Jack, a Spanish Civil War veteran, and a charismatic, talkative mother, Ellen, a housewife, but he is an only child with few friends. His one companion is a man who lives next door, Dink Jenkins, who is the local sports hero in Mississippi. However, when Dink is drafted to go to war, Ellen decides to buy Willie a dog, against Jack&#x27;s wishes, in order that he should have some company.

Willie and Skip became firm friends very quickly. However, Willie gets bullied at school by Big Boy Wilkinson, Henjie Henick, and Spit McGee, until Dink sends him a German helmet and belt from the front line. The other boys demand he play ball in order to win back his belongings, while Skip leaps in to help him. That same day, the three boys talk Willie into spending the night in a graveyard, where they claim a witch is buried. If he stays there, he gets to join their gang and also keep the ball Dink signed for them; otherwise, he has to give them his German helmet. Willie stays at the graveyard for a number of hours until he hears two moonshiners, Millard and Junior, who are loading crates into a crypt. Skip jumps on Millard until Junior comes at him with a spade. Willie slingshots Junior with an acorn and attempts to escape the graveyard with Skip, but they are soon captured by Junior. He threatens to kill Skip unless Willie stays before sunrise. After the two guys leave, the three boys return and accept Willie into their group as a reward.

Skip, having always been a friendly dog, is known by everyone in the town. Skip leads Willie through the best parts of his life- his early days. Thanks to Skip, Willie now has three friends and a girlfriend, Rivers. Skip is there for him when Dink gets home, shell-shocked and a drunkard since dishonorably discharged from the Army, presumably for desertion. However, when Willie&#x27;s first ball game comes along, Skip and Willie have their first falling out. Dink agrees to come along but does not bother because, since the war, he has found competitions do not interest him anymore. Skip, wanting to cheer Willie up, runs onto the field and sits, wagging his tail, refusing to leave. Angry and embarrassed by his poor performance at the game, causing his team to lose, Willie publicly hits Skip across the muzzle, and he disappears without a trace.

Unbeknownst to Willie, Skip has returned to the crypt and has been accidentally shut in the grave where moonshine is being stored. As Willie searches in the graveyard, he hears Skip&#x27;s bark and runs to save him, but Junior knocks the dog unconscious with the spade. Dink arrives and manages to eject the two moonshiners. As Willie and Dink&#x27;s families gather in solemnity in the vet&#x27;s waiting room, Skip nearly dies from his injuries in Willie&#x27;s arms, but the dog awakens, licking Willie&#x27;s face and hands.

Willie explains about his friendship with Skip that he had been an only child and Skip was an only dog. When Willie leaves to go to Oxford University in the 1950s, Skip remains with Jack and Ellen, sleeping in Willie&#x27;s old room, and then dies on Willie&#x27;s bed. Having succumbed to arthritis, he is then buried under the elm tree by Jack and Ellen, with Jack telling Willie of Skip&#x27;s death via a transatlantic call.

==Cast==
==Production==
Principal photography took place in Canton and Yazoo City, Mississippi, from May 10 to June 23, 1998.
The author of the book, Willie Morris, suffered from a heart attack right after the film was completed in 1999. Morris saw a preliminary screening of the film in New York and praised it as &quot;an absolute classic.&quot; Morris died a couple of days later and never saw the final version.

<text>The New York Public Interest Research Group (NYPIRG) is a New York statewide student-directed, non-partisan, not for profit political organization. It has existed since 1973. Its current executive director is Blair Horner and its founding director was Donald K. Ross.

NYPIRG is directed by a student-run and student-elected Board of Directors. Any issue that NYPIRG works on, or stance it takes, must be approved by its student board of directors. Kaylee Evans, student at SUNY Cortland, is the current chairperson of NYPIRG&#x27;s Board of Directors. NYPIRG is one of the largest of the Public Interest Research Groups, which were inspired by Ralph Nader in the 1970s, and operate at the state level. After leaving Columbia University, former U.S. President Barack Obama worked at NYPIRG at its City College Chapter.

NYPIRG works on a variety of socioeconomic issues such as college affordability, consumer protection, sustainable energy, government accountability, hunger &amp; homelessness, public transportation in New York City, and voter rights.

==Infrastructure==
NYPIRG has an office in lower Manhattan, New York City, and a legislative office located in Albany. NYPIRG also operates dozens of campus and regional offices statewide.

==Campus program==
The focus of NYPIRG&#x27;s program is the campus chapters. Campus chapters exist at schools in the State University of New York (SUNY), City University of New York (CUNY), and two private colleges (Pratt Institute and Syracuse University). The chapters are funded by activity fees which are voted on by students, and/or determined by student governments.

<text>Philip Shane Ardern (born 26 January 1960) is a New Zealand politician. He is a member of the National Party and represented the electorate of Taranaki-King Country from 1998 to 2014.

==Early years==
Ardern is the son of Noel and Olive Ardern. He was born and raised in Ōpunake, and attended Opunake High School. Before entering politics, he was a dairy farmer, and many of his political activities have been on behalf of the farming community. He is a distant cousin of former New Zealand Prime Minister and Labour MP Jacinda Ardern.

==Member of Parliament==


Ardern first became a member of parliament due to the Taranaki-King Country by-election of 1998, which resulted from the retirement from politics of former Prime Minister Jim Bolger. He held that seat from 1998 to 2014.

Ardern became one of the driving forces behind the legislation that enabled the setting up of the dairy company Fonterra in 2001. He came to nationwide attention in late 2003 when he drove a tractor up the front steps of Parliament House as part of a protest against a proposed agricultural emissions research levy, nicknamed the &quot;flatulence&quot; or &quot;fart tax&quot;. The police investigated him for dangerous conduct and charged him with disorderly conduct. At a pre-trial hearing the judge said the case was a waste of court and police resources, and next month the police withdrew the charge. From 2008 until his retirement from parliament in 2014 he served as chairman of the parliamentary Primary Production Select Committee. In late 2013 bloggers and media speculatively named Ardern as one of the National Party MPs likely to retire due to a perceived need for rejuvenation of the National Party parliamentary caucus.

==Retirement==

Ardern announced he was stepping down from his seat in December 2013 and that he would remain an MP until the end of the 50th New Zealand Parliament. Since retiring from Parliament, Ardern has returned to his Central North Island farms, having been succeeded in the Taranki-King Country seat by Barbara Kuriger. Ardern has also begun advocating again at the grassroots levels for the Taranaki farming communities that supply Fonterra having been noted at several post-election forums held by the dairy industry.

<text>Live at Wolf Trap is the third live album by US rock band The Doobie Brothers, released in 2004.

Wolf Trap is a National Park in Virginia, where the band performed live on July 25.

In addition to the CD, a DVD was released featuring, in addition to the CD setlist, &quot;People Gotta Love Again&quot;, &quot;Spirit&quot;, &quot;Nobody&quot;, &quot;Neal&#x27;s Fandango&quot;, &quot;Takin&#x27; It to the Streets&quot; and &quot;Without You&quot;, interviews, a photo gallery and other bonus features.

The album was also released as a double LP vinyl set, same tracklist as the CD version.

The album revived a handful of tracks the Doobies had not released live versions of before from Tom Johnston&#x27;s original stint with the band. The set also included a cover of the rock and roll standard &quot;Little Bitty Pretty One&quot;.

The album contains the final recordings of drummer and vocalist Keith Knudsen, who died shortly after its release.

<text>&quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot; (original title: &quot;The Yellow Wall-paper. A Story&quot;) is a short story by American writer Charlotte Perkins Gilman, first published in January 1892 in &quot;The New England Magazine&quot;. It is regarded as an important early work of American feminist literature for its illustration of the attitudes towards mental and physical health of women in the 19th century. It is also lauded as an excellent work of horror fiction.

The story is written as a collection of journal entries narrated in the first person. The journal was written by a woman whose physician husband has rented an old mansion for the summer. Forgoing other rooms in the house, the husband confines the woman to an upstairs nursery. As a form of treatment, the husband forbids the journal writer from working or writing, and encourages her to eat well and get plenty of air so that she can recuperate from what he calls a &quot;temporary nervous depression – a slight hysterical tendency&quot;, a common diagnosis in women at the time. As the reader continues through the journal entries, they experience the writer&#x27;s gradual descent into madness with nothing better to do than observe the peeling yellow wallpaper in her room.

==Plot summary==
The story describes a young woman and her husband. He imposes a rest cure on her when she suffers &quot;temporary nervous depression&quot; after the birth of their baby. They spend the summer at a colonial mansion, where the narrator is largely confined to an upstairs nursery. The story makes striking use of an unreliable narrator in order to gradually reveal the degree to which her husband has &quot;imprisoned&quot; her due to her physical and mental condition. She describes torn wallpaper, barred windows, metal rings in the walls, a floor &quot;scratched and gouged and splintered&quot;, a bed bolted to the floor, and a gate at the top of the stairs, but blames all these on children who must have resided there.

The narrator devotes many journal entries to describing the wallpaper in the room – its &quot;sickly&quot; color, its &quot;yellow&quot; smell, its bizarre and disturbing pattern like &quot;an interminable string of toadstools, budding and sprouting in endless convolutions,&quot; its missing patches, and the way it leaves yellow smears on the skin and clothing of anyone who touches it. She describes how the longer one stays in the bedroom, the more the wallpaper appears to mutate, especially in the moonlight. With no stimulus other than the wallpaper, the pattern and designs become increasingly intriguing to the narrator. She soon begins to see a figure in the design. Eventually, she comes to believe that a woman is creeping on all fours behind the pattern. Believing she must free the woman in the wallpaper, she begins to strip the remaining paper off the wall.

When her husband arrives home, the narrator refuses to unlock her door. When he returns with the key, he finds her creeping around the room, rubbing against the wallpaper, and exclaiming, &quot;I&#x27;ve got out at last... in spite of you.&quot; He faints, but she continues to circle the room, creeping over his inert body each time she passes it, believing herself to have become the woman trapped behind the yellow wallpaper.

==Interpretations==

===Gilman===

Gilman used her writing to explore the role of women in America around 1900. She expounded upon many issues, such as the lack of a life outside the home and the oppressive forces of a patriarchal society. Through her work, Gilman paved the way for writers such as Alice Walker and Sylvia Plath. 

In &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper,&quot; she portrays the narrator&#x27;s insanity as a way to protest the professional and societal oppression against women. While under the impression that husbands and male doctors were acting with their best interests in mind, women were depicted as mentally fragile. Women’s rights advocates of the era believed that the &quot;outbreak&quot; of this mental instability was the manifestation of their setbacks regarding the roles they were allowed to play in a male-dominated society. Women were even discouraged from writing because it would ultimately create an identity and become a form of defiance. Gilman realized that writing became one of the only forms of expression for women at a time when they had very few rights.

After the birth of her first daughter, Gilman suffered postnatal depression and was treated by Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell, the leading expert on women&#x27;s mental health at the time. He suggested a strict &#x27;rest cure&#x27; regimen involving much of bed rest and a blanket ban on working, including reading, writing, and painting. After three months and almost desperate, Gilman decided to contravene her diagnosis, along with the treatment methods, and started to work again. Aware of how close she had come to a complete mental breakdown, the author wrote ”The Yellow Wallpaper” with additions and exaggerations to illustrate her criticism of the medical field. Gilman sent a copy to Mitchell but never received a response. (Gilman was ultimately proven right in her disdain for the &quot;rest cure&quot; when she sought a second opinion from Mary Putnam Jacobi, one of the first female doctors and a strong opponent of this theory, who prescribed a regimen of physical and mental activity that proved a much more successful treatment.)

She added that &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot; was &quot;not intended to drive people crazy, but to save people from being driven crazy, and it worked&quot;. Gilman claimed that many years later, she learned that Mitchell had changed his treatment methods. However, literary historian Julie Bates Dock has discredited this. Mitchell continued his methods, and as late as 1908 – 16 years after &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot; was published – was interested in creating entire hospitals devoted to the &quot;rest cure&quot; so that his treatments would be more widely accessible.

===Feminist interpretations===
This story has been interpreted by feminist critics as a condemnation of the male control of the 19th-century medical profession. Throughout the short story, the narrator offers many suggestions to help her get better, such as exercising, working, or socializing with the outside world. Her ideas are dismissed immediately while using language that stereotypes her as irrational and, therefore, unqualified to offer ideas about her condition. This interpretation draws on the concept of the &quot;domestic sphere&quot; that women were held in during this period.

Many feminist critics focus on the degree of triumph at the end of the story. Although some claim the narrator slipped into insanity, others see the ending as a woman&#x27;s assertion of agency in a marriage in which she felt trapped. The emphasis on reading and writing as gendered practices also illustrated the importance of the wallpaper. If the narrator were allowed neither to write in her journal nor to read, she would begin to &quot;read&quot; the wallpaper until she found the escape she was looking for. Through seeing the women in the wallpaper, the narrator realizes that she could not live her life locked up behind bars. At the end of the story, as her husband lies on the floor unconscious, she crawls over him, symbolically rising over him. This is interpreted as a victory over her husband at the expense of her sanity.

Susan S. Lanser, a professor at Brandeis University, praises contemporary feminism and its role in changing the study and the interpretation of literature. &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot; was one of many stories that lost authority in the literary world because of an ideology that determined the works&#x27; content to be disturbing or offensive. Critics such as the editor of the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; rejected the short story because &quot;[he] could not forgive [himself] if [he] made others as miserable as [he] made [himself]&quot;. Lanser argues that the same argument of devastation and misery can be said about the work of Edgar Allan Poe. &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot; provided feminists the tools to interpret literature in different ways. Lanser argues that the short story was a &quot;particularly congenial medium for such a re-vision... because the narrator herself engages in a form of feminist interpretation when she tries to read the paper on her wall&quot;. The narrator in the story is trying to find a single meaning in the wallpaper. At first, she focuses on the contradictory style of the wallpaper: it is &quot;flamboyant&quot; while also &quot;dull&quot;, &quot;pronounced,&quot; yet &quot;lame,&quot; and &quot;uncertain&quot; (p. 13). She takes into account the patterns and tries to organize them geometrically, but she is further confused. The wallpaper changes colors when it reflects light and emits a distinct odor that the protagonist cannot recognize (p. 25). At night the narrator can see a woman behind bars within the complex design of the wallpaper. Lanser argues that the unnamed woman was able to find &quot;a space of text on which she can locate whatever self-projection&quot;. Just like the narrator as a reader, when one comes into contact with a confusing and complicated text, one tries to find a single meaning. &quot;How we were taught to read,&quot; as Lanser puts it, is why a reader cannot fully comprehend the text. The patriarchal ideology had kept many scholars from being able to interpret and appreciate stories such as &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot;. With the growth of feminist criticism, &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot; has become a standard text in many curricula. Feminists have made a significant contribution to the study of literature, according to Lanser, but she also remarks that if &quot;we acknowledge the participation of women writers and readers in dominant patterns of thought and social practice then perhaps our own patterns must also be deconstructed if we are to recover meanings still hidden or overlooked.&quot;

Martha J. Cutter points out that many of Charlotte Perkins Gilman&#x27;s works address a &quot;struggle in which a male-dominated medical establishment attempts to silence women&quot;. Gilman&#x27;s works challenge the social construction of women by a patriarchal medical discourse that forced them to be &quot;silent, powerless, and passive&quot;. In the period in which Gilman wrote, women were frequently considered (and treated) as inferiors, prone to be sickly and weak. In this time period, it was thought that women who received formal education (amongst other causes) could develop hysteria, a now-discredited catchall term referring to most mental health diseases identified in women and erroneously believed to stem from a malfunctioning uterus (from the Greek &quot;hystera&quot;, &quot;womb&quot;). At the time, the medical understanding was that women who spent time in serious intellectual pursuits (such as university education) over-stimulated their brains, which in turn led to states of hysteria. Many of the diseases diagnosed in women were considered to be a matter of a lack of self-control or self-rule. Medical practitioners argued that a physician must &quot;assume a tone of authority&quot; and that a &quot;cured&quot; woman is defined by being &quot;subdued, docile, silent, and above all subject to the will and voice of the physician&quot;. A hysterical woman craves power. To be treated for her hysteria, she must submit to her physician, whose role is to undermine her desires. Often women were prescribed bed rest as a form of treatment, which was meant to &quot;tame&quot; them and keep them imprisoned. Treatments such as this were a way of ridding women of rebelliousness and forcing them to conform to expected social roles. In her works, Gilman highlights that the harm caused by these types of treatments for women, i.e., &quot;the rest cure&quot;, has to do with how her voice is silenced. Paula Treichler explains: &quot;In this story diagnosis &#x27;is powerful and public... It is a male voice that... imposes controls on the female narrator and dictates how she is to perceive and talk about the world.&#x27; Diagnosis covertly functions to empower the male physician&#x27;s voice and disempower the female patient&#x27;s.&quot; The narrator in &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot; is not allowed to participate in her treatment or diagnosis and is completely forced to succumb to everything in which her doctor and in this particular story, her husband, says. The male voice is the one which forces control on the female and decides how she is allowed to perceive and speak about the world around her.

===Other===
&quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot; is sometimes cited as an example of Gothic literature for its themes of madness and powerlessness. Alan Ryan introduced the story by writing: &quot;quite apart from its origins [it] is one of the finest, and strongest, tales of horror ever written. It may be a ghost story. Worse yet, it may not.&quot; Pioneering horror author H. P. Lovecraft writes in his essay &quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&quot; (1927) that &quot;&#x27;The Yellow Wall Paper&#x27; rises to a classic level in subtly delineating the madness which crawls over a woman dwelling in the hideously papered room where a madwoman was once confined&quot;. 

Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz wrote that &quot;the story was a &quot;cri de coeur&quot; against Gilman&#x27;s first husband, artist Charles Walter Stetson and the traditional marriage he had demanded.&quot; Gilman attempted to deflect blame to protect her daughter Katharine and Stetson&#x27;s second wife Grace Ellery Channing, who was also Gilman&#x27;s close friend and cousin. Horowitz consults the sources of Charlotte&#x27;s private life, including her daily journals, drafts of poems and essays, and intimate letters, and compares them to the diary accounts of her first husband. She also mines Charlotte&#x27;s diaries for notes on her reading. She shows how specific poetry, fiction, and popular science shaped her consciousness and understanding of sex and gender, health and illness, emotion and intellect. Horowitz makes a case that &quot;The Yellow Wall-Paper&quot;, in its original form, did not represent a literal protest against Mitchell (a neurologist who treated Gilman in 1887) and his treatment. Rather, it emerged from Charlotte&#x27;s troubled relationship with her husband Walter, personified in the story&#x27;s physician. In demanding a traditional wife, Walter denied Charlotte personal freedom, squelched her intellectual energy, and characterized her illness.

In another interpretation, Sari Edelstein has argued that &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot; is an allegory for Gilman&#x27;s hatred of the emerging yellow journalism. Having created &quot;The Forerunner&quot; in November 1909, Gilman made it clear she wished the press to be more insightful and not rely upon exaggerated stories and flashy headlines. Gilman was often scandalized in the media and resented the sensationalism of the media. The relationship between the narrator and the wallpaper within the story parallels Gilman&#x27;s relationship with the press. The protagonist describes the wallpaper as having &quot;sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin&quot;. Edelstein argues that given Gilman’s distaste for the Yellow Press, this can also be seen as a description of tabloid newspapers of the day.

Paula A. Treichler focuses on the relationship portrayed in the short story between women and writing. Rather than write about the feminist themes which view the wallpaper as something along the lines of &quot;...the &#x27;pattern&#x27; which underlies sexual inequality, the external manifestation of neurasthenia, the narrator&#x27;s unconscious, the narrator&#x27;s situation within patriarchy&quot;, Treichler instead explains that the wallpaper can be a symbol to represent discourse and the fact that the narrator is alienated from the world in which she previously could somewhat express herself. Treichler illustrates that through this discussion of language and writing, in the story, Charlotte Perkins Gilman is defying the &quot;...sentence that the structure of patriarchal language imposes&quot;. While Treichler accepts the legitimacy of strictly feminist claims, she writes that a closer look at the text suggests that the wallpaper could be interpreted as women&#x27;s language and discourse. The woman found in the wallpaper could be the &quot;...representation of women that becomes possible only after women obtain the right to speak&quot;. In making this claim, it suggests that the new struggle found within the text is between two forms of writing; one rather old and traditional, and the other new and exciting. This is supported by the fact that John, the narrator&#x27;s husband, does not like his wife to write anything, which is why her journal containing the story is kept a secret and thus is known only by the narrator and reader. A look at the text shows that as the relationship between the narrator and the wallpaper grows stronger, so too does her language in her journal as she begins to increasingly write of her frustration and desperation.

<doc id="1038417" wikidata="Q6594922" url="?curid=1038417" title="List of presidents of the United States by time in office">
<text>The length of a full four-year term of office for a president of the United States usually amounts to 1,461 days (three common years of 365 days plus one leap year of 366 days). The listed number of days is calculated as the &quot;difference between dates&quot;, which counts the number of &quot;calendar days&quot; except the first day (&quot;day zero&quot;). If the first day were included, all numbers would be one day more, except Grover Cleveland would have two more days, as he served two non-consecutive terms.

Of the individuals elected president of the United States, four died of natural causes while in office (William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G. Harding and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley and John F. Kennedy) and one resigned from office (Richard Nixon).

William Henry Harrison spent the shortest time in office, while Franklin D. Roosevelt spent the longest. Roosevelt is the only American president to have served more than two terms. Following ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment in 1951, presidents—beginning with Dwight D. Eisenhower—have been ineligible for election to a third term or, after serving more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected president, to a second term. The amendment contained a grandfather clause that explicitly exempted the incumbent president, then Harry S. Truman, from the new term limitation.

Grover Cleveland and Donald Trump were voted out of office after one term, but they were later elected to a second non-consecutive term. Consequently, while there have been 47 presidencies in the nation&#x27;s history, only 45 people have been sworn into office.

<doc id="1038423" wikidata="Q229511" url="?curid=1038423" title="3Xtrim 3X55 Trener">
<text>The 3X55 Trener (&quot;Trainer&quot;) and 3X47 Ultra are a family of ultralight aircraft produced in Poland by the 3Xtrim Aircraft Factory. Both are two-seat, high-wing, strut-braced monoplanes with fixed tricycle undercarriage and available only as completed aircraft. There are also 450 Ultra and 495 Ultra Plus sub-variants of the 3X47 Ultra, with gross weights adjusted for national ultralight regulations.

The US light sport aircraft version of the 3X55 is known as the Navigator 600 and has a 1320-pound maximum gross takeoff weight

3Xtrim take their company name from a double entendre, as they refer to their designs being &quot;triple trimmed&quot; (or more exactly &quot;triple-tested&quot;) during the design, prototype and production stages and also that the aircraft is designed for &quot;extreme conditions&quot;. In English the company name is pronounced &quot;Three-Extreme&quot;.

==Development==
Former SZD sailplane engineer Adam Kurbiel designed the predecessor of 3X55, the EOL-VLA, to conform to European JAR-VLA rules. That plane was modified through the years to meet Canadian Advanced Ultralight and US Light Sport Aircraft rules. The 3X47 version is specifically for the European market to meet those standards.

The designation 3X55 means &quot;3Xtrim Aircraft – 550 kg gross weight&quot; while the 3X47 refers to its 470 kg gross weight.

The European versions feature extensive structural use of carbon fibre to achieve lightness, while the 3X55 is predominantly of fibreglass construction. Otherwise the two aircraft are similar in appearance and performance.

The 3X55 first flew in 1996 and by the summer of 2006 about 60 aircraft of both types had been produced.


==Design==
The fuselage and vertical tail of the 3X55 is a one-piece structure made from fibreglass. The firewall is a Fiberfrax ceramic/aluminium sandwich.

The cockpit is wide at the elbows. Crew access is via a door on each side of the cockpit that hinges upwards and is supported by a gas strut.

The control sticks are located conventionally in front of each seat. The standard throttle arrangement is one panel-mounted centre throttle, but a second throttle located on the left side of the panel is optional, allowing the left-seat pilot to fly with either hand on the throttle or stick.
The wings are strut-braced with a single spar and are made from fibreglass and foam with a 15.5% CAGI.R3 airfoil. The wing has a span of 31 .5 feet and an area of , which gives it a wing loading of 9.5 lbs/sq ft at gross weight. The aircraft has removable wings, with single locking pins and quick-disconnect controls which can be easily hooked up and inspected from inside the cockpit.

The wings have conventional Frise ailerons and slotted flaps. The elevator and rudder are also conventional. Ailerons and elevator are controlled by dual centre-mounted sticks through push-pull tubes, while the rudder is controlled by cables. The rudder cables attach to the rudder by wrapping around the wide bottom diameter of the rudder itself. The pitot tube is mounted on the left-hand strut.

The flaps are operated by a ceiling-mounted flap handle with detents for 0, 15 and 30 degrees of deflection. The flaps are controlled directly with the handle attached to a flap centre-section behind the fuselage and the wing flaps plug into the flap centre-section. Flaps are normally set to 15 degrees for takeoff and 30 degrees for landing.

The plane comes in one colour – white, but owners can add their own vinyl decals to finish the plane as desired.

===Fuel capacity===
The fuel tank is located behind the right-hand seat. The quantity can be read directly through a sight gauge behind the seat. The standard tank is 70 litres (18 US gallons) with 87 litres (23 US gallons) optional. Behind the left-hand seat is a small baggage compartment, with additional baggage space above and behind both seats.

===Powerplant===
The 3X55 powerplant options are the Rotax 912UL, the 912ULS or the Jabiru 2200. The standard fuel is premium auto fuel, but it can run on 100LL as well.

The 3X55 can be equipped with either a three-bladed, fixed pitch Czech-made Woodcomp wood/fibreglass SR 200 propeller or an electrically adjustable Woodcomp SR 2000 propeller, with an optional constant speed unit.

===Landing gear===
The main landing gear consists of sprung fibreglass gear legs with 5X5.00 tires as standard on graphite wheel rims. Larger 6X6.00 tires are optional. The nose gear is a single-fork design also made from fibreglass. Nose gear suspension is a compressed rubber donut system.

==Competition history==
Krzysztof Wieczorek won the 16th FAI World Precision Flying Championship in 2004 and took the 3rd place in the 14th FAI World Rally Flying Championship in 2004 flying 3Xtrim aircraft. In the 17th FAI World Precision Flying Championship in 2006, 3Xtrim took the 1st (Krzysztof Wieczorek) and 3rd (Krzysztof Skrętowicz) places.

<text>Lower Queen Anne is a neighborhood in northwestern Seattle, Washington, at the base of Queen Anne Hill. While its boundaries are not precise, the toponym usually refers to the shopping, office, and residential districts to the north and west of Seattle Center. The neighborhood is connected to Upper Queen Anne—the shopping district at the top of the hill—by an extremely steep section of Queen Anne Avenue N. known as the Counterbalance, in memory of the cable cars that once ran up and down it.

In early April 2021, the Seattle City Council passed a resolution that officially recognized changing the name of the area previously known as Lower Queen Anne to Uptown.

While &quot;Lower Queen Anne&quot; and &quot;Uptown&quot; are rarely used to refer to the grounds of Seattle Center itself, most of Seattle Center is in the neighborhood; these include Climate Pledge Arena (home of the Seattle Storm of the WNBA and the Seattle Kraken of the NHL), the Exhibition Hall, McCaw Hall (home of the Seattle Opera and Pacific Northwest Ballet), the Cornish Playhouse (home of the Intiman Summer Theatre Festival and Cornish College of the Arts), the Bagley Wright Theater (home of Seattle Repertory Theatre), and the studios for KEXP radio.

Lower Queen Anne also has a three-screen movie theater, the SIFF Cinema Uptown, and On the Boards, a center for avant-garde theater and music.

==Geography==
Lower Queen Anne can be considered either a distinct neighborhood, or part of the larger Queen Anne neighborhood. Although the borders of Lower Queen Anne are not clearly defined, they usually include the area from Ward St. to Denny Way. Additionally, the area from the intersection of W. Galer St. and 5th Ave W. to W Prospect St. and Queen Anne Ave. N. are also usually considered part of the Lower Queen Anne area. However, as no borders for neighborhoods in the city of Seattle have been clearly defined, the boundaries of Lower Queen Anne remain merely set by popular opinion.

== Transit ==

The Seattle Center Monorail, the city&#x27;s only monorail line, runs from Lower Queen Anne to Downtown. King County Metro operates several bus routes that travel through the neighborhood, including the RapidRide D Line.

==Economy==
The Seattle-based newspaper known as the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; was located in Lower Queen Anne. Local radio station KEXP-FM moved its headquarters to Lower Queen Anne in a building adjacent to the Climate Pledge Arena in December 2015.

The neighborhood is also home to numerous high-tech companies. The corporate headquarters of F5 Networks was located in Lower Queen Anne until it was moved to F5 Tower. It is the home of business texting startup Zipwhip. It was the home of Quicksoft, the first company to score commercial success with shareware. Prior to its dissolution, Pro Air was also headquartered in Lower Queen Anne. Outreach, a sales software company, moved their offices to Lower Queen Anne in 2018, filling a space previously held by Big Fish Games.

Lower Queen Anne is home to many restaurants.

<text>John Todhunter (30 December 1839 – 25 October 1916) was an Irish poet and playwright who wrote seven volumes of poetry, and several plays.

== Life ==
Todhunter was born in Dublin, the eldest son of Thomas Harvey Todhunter, a Quaker merchant of English origin. He was educated at Quaker schools, including Bootham School, York and Mountmellick in Ireland. He started work at his father&#x27;s offices in Dublin and London before continuing on to attend Trinity College, where he studied medicine. While at Trinity, Todhunter won the Vice-Chancellor&#x27;s prize for English Verse 1864, 1865 and 1866, and the Gold Medal of the Philosophical Society 1866 for an essay. He also clerked for William Stokes while studying. Todhunter received his Bachelor of Medicine in 1867, and his Doctorate of Medicine degree in 1871. At Trinity he also contributed to the literary magazine &quot;Kottabos&quot;.

In 1870 (one year prior to his DM) he became a Professor of English Literature at Alexandra College, Dublin. Four years later, Todhunter resigned from that position and travelled to Egypt and several places in Europe. He married Dora L. Digby in 1879. In 1881, he finally settled in London, where his home in Bedford Park, Chiswick was located in a small community of writers and artists, including W. B. Yeats. He was involved in the founding of the Irish Literary Society there.

His tragedy, &quot;The Black Cat&quot; only received one performance, on 8 December 1893 at the Opera Comique, by the Independent Theatre Society—a private club formed to forestall censorship by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office.

== Works ==

* Laurella and Other Poems (1876)
* Alcestis: A Dramatic Poem (1878)
* The True Tragedy of Rienzi; Tribune of Rome (1881)
* Forest Songs &amp; Other Poems (1881)
* The Banshee and Other Poems (1888)
* How Dreams Come True (1890)
* The Poison Flower (1891)
* The Legend of Stauffenberg (1890)
* The Irish Bardic Tales (1896)
* Sounds and Sweet Airs (1904)
*An Irish Love song
*The Black Knight

=== Plays ===
* Helena in Troas (1886)
* A Sicilian Idyll (1890)
* The Black Cat (1893)
* A Comedy of Sighs (1894)

=== Prose ===
* A study of Shelley (1879)
* The Life of Patrick Sarsfield, Earl of Lucan (1901)

=== Translation from German ===
* Heinrich Heine&#x27;s Book of Songs (1907)

Many of Todhunter&#x27;s poems are available online, and some of his works are being processed by Distributed Proofreaders.

== Obituary ==

&quot;The Times of London&quot; published an obituary of Todhunter, which included the following passage:


Todhunter&#x27;s first volume was a collection of narrative and lyrical poems entitled &quot;Laurella&quot; (1876). Grace, tenderness, and melody marked these poems; in later years he did much stronger work under the influence of ancient Celtic literature, to the study of which he was led by the memorable rendering of the Cuchullin legend published in 1878 by Standish O&#x27;Grady. The &quot;Banshee&quot; (1888) and &quot;Three Bardic Talcs&quot; (1896) contain the best of Todhunter&#x27;s work in poetry. Three plays of his have been acted with success; one of them, The Black Cat, produced by the Independent Theatre in 1893, was a factor in the revival of the literary drama. His translation of Heine&#x27;s &quot;Buch der Lieder&quot; is perhaps the best complete English version of a work than which none more irresistibly attracts or more cruelly eludes the art of the translator. He was also author of a few brief prose works, including a &quot;Life of Sarsfield&quot; and a &quot;Study of Shelley.&quot;

At one time he was a familiar figure at the Savile Club, but for some years his delicate health and his constitutional hatred of noise and bustle kept him far from town life. He was a man of striking appearance, and the sweetness, unselfishness, and loyalty of his character gave to intimacy with him a charm and fragrance which his friends will not easily forget.

<doc id="1038491" wikidata="Q265936" url="?curid=1038491" title="Kawasaki disease">
<text>Kawasaki disease (also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome) is a syndrome of unknown cause that results in a fever and mainly affects children under 5 years of age. It is a form of vasculitis, in which medium-sized blood vessels become inflamed throughout the body. The fever typically lasts for more than five days and is not affected by usual medications. Other common symptoms include large lymph nodes in the neck, a rash in the genital area, lips, palms, or soles of the feet, and red eyes. Within three weeks of the onset, the skin from the hands and feet may peel, after which recovery typically occurs. The disease is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries, which include the formation of coronary artery aneurysms and myocarditis.
While the specific cause is unknown, it is thought to result from an excessive immune response to particular infections in children who are genetically predisposed to those infections. It is not an infectious disease, that is, it does not spread between people. Diagnosis is usually based on a person&#x27;s signs and symptoms. Other tests such as an ultrasound of the heart and blood tests may support the diagnosis. Diagnosis must take into account many other conditions that may present similar features, including scarlet fever and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, a &quot;Kawasaki-like&quot; disease associated with COVID-19, appears to have distinct features.
Typically, initial treatment of Kawasaki disease consists of high doses of aspirin and immunoglobulin. Usually, with treatment, fever resolves within 24 hours and full recovery occurs. If the coronary arteries are involved, ongoing treatment or surgery may occasionally be required. Without treatment, coronary artery aneurysms occur in up to 25% and about 1% die. With treatment, the risk of death is reduced to 0.17%. People who have had coronary artery aneurysms after Kawasaki disease require lifelong cardiological monitoring by specialized teams.
Kawasaki disease is rare. It affects between 8 and 67 per 100,000 people under the age of five except in Japan, where it affects 124 per 100,000. Boys are more commonly affected than girls. The disorder is named after Japanese pediatrician Tomisaku Kawasaki, who first described it in 1967.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Kawasaki disease often begins with a high and persistent fever that is not very responsive to normal treatment with paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen. This is the most prominent symptom of Kawasaki disease, and is a characteristic sign that the disease is in its acute phase; the fever normally presents as a high (above 39–40 °C) and remittent, and is followed by extreme irritability. Recently, it is reported to be present in patients with atypical or incomplete Kawasaki disease; nevertheless, it is not present in 100% of cases.

The first day of fever is considered the first day of the illness, and its duration is typically one to two weeks; in the absence of treatment, it may extend for three to four weeks. Prolonged fever is associated with a higher incidence of cardiac involvement. It responds partially to antipyretic drugs and does not cease with the introduction of antibiotics. However, when appropriate therapy is started – intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin – the fever subsides after two days.

Bilateral conjunctival inflammation has been reported to be the most common symptom after fever. It typically involves the bulbar conjunctivae, is not accompanied by suppuration, and is not painful. This usually begins shortly after the onset of fever during the acute stage of the disease. Anterior uveitis may be present under slit-lamp examination. Iritis can occur, too. Keratic precipitates are another eye manifestation (detectable by a slit lamp, but are usually too small to be seen by the unaided eye).

Kawasaki disease also presents with a set of mouth symptoms, the most characteristic of which are a red tongue, swollen lips with vertical cracking, and bleeding. The mucosa of the mouth and throat may be bright red, and the tongue may have a typical &quot;strawberry tongue&quot; appearance (marked redness with prominent gustative papillae). These mouth symptoms are caused by necrotizing microvasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis.

Cervical lymphadenopathy is seen in 50% to 75% of children, whereas the other features are estimated to occur in 90%, but sometimes it can be the dominant presenting symptom. According to the diagnostic criteria, at least one impaired lymph node ≥ 15 mm in diameter should be involved. Affected lymph nodes are painless or minimally painful, nonfluctuant, and nonsuppurative; erythema of the neighboring skin may occur. Children with fever and neck adenitis who do not respond to antibiotics should have Kawasaki disease considered as part of the differential diagnoses.


In the acute phase of the disease, changes in the peripheral extremities can include erythema of the palms and soles, which is often striking with sharp demarcation and often accompanied by painful, brawny edema of the dorsa of the hands or feet, so affected children frequently refuse to hold objects in their hands or to bear weight on their feet. Later, during the convalescent or the subacute phase, desquamation of the fingers and toes usually begins in the periungual region within two to three weeks after the onset of fever and may extend to include the palms and soles. Around 11% of children affected by the disease may continue skin-peeling for many years. One to two months after the onset of fever, deep transverse grooves across the nails may develop (Beau&#x27;s lines), and occasionally nails are shed.

The most common skin manifestation is a diffuse macular-papular erythematous rash, which is quite nonspecific. The rash varies over time and is characteristically located on the trunk; it may further spread to involve the face, extremities, and perineum. Many other forms of cutaneous lesions have been reported; they may include scarlatiniform, papular, urticariform, multiform-like erythema, and purpuric lesions; even micropustules were reported. It can be polymorphic, not itchy, and normally observed up to the fifth day of fever. However, it is never bullous or vesicular.

In the acute stage of Kawasaki disease, systemic inflammatory changes are evident in many organs. Joint pain (arthralgia) and swelling, frequently symmetrical, and arthritis can also occur. Myocarditis, diarrhea, pericarditis, valvulitis, aseptic meningitis, pneumonitis, lymphadenitis, and hepatitis may be present and are manifested by the presence of inflammatory cells in the affected tissues. If left untreated, some symptoms will eventually relent, but coronary artery aneurysms will not improve, resulting in a significant risk of death or disability due to myocardial infarction. If treated quickly, this risk can be mostly avoided and the course of illness cut short.

Other reported nonspecific symptoms include cough, rhinorrhea, sputum, vomiting, headache, and seizure.

The course of the disease can be divided into three clinical phases.
* The acute febrile phase, which usually lasts for one to two weeks, is characterized by fever, conjunctival injection, erythema of the oral mucosa, erythema and swelling of the hands and feet, rash, cervical adenopathy, aseptic meningitis, diarrhea, and hepatic dysfunction. Myocarditis is common during this time, and a pericardial effusion may be present. Coronary arteritis may be present, but aneurysms are generally not yet visible by echocardiography.
* The subacute phase begins when fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy resolve at about one to two weeks after the onset of fever, but irritability, anorexia, and conjunctival injection persist. Desquamation of the fingers and toes and thrombocytosis are seen during this stage, which generally lasts until about four weeks after the onset of fever. Coronary artery aneurysms usually develop during this time, and the risk for sudden death is highest.
* The convalescent stage begins when all clinical signs of illness have disappeared, and continues until the sedimentation rate returns to normal, usually at six to eight weeks after the onset of illness.
Adult onset of Kawasaki disease is rare. The presentation differs between adults and children: in particular, it seems that adults more often have cervical lymphadenopathy, hepatitis, and arthralgia.

Some children, especially young infants, have atypical presentations without the classic set of symptoms. Such presentations are associated with a higher risk of cardiac artery aneurysms.

=== Cardiac ===

Heart complications are the most important aspect of Kawasaki disease, which is the leading cause of heart disease acquired in childhood in the United States and Japan. In developed nations, it appears to have replaced acute rheumatic fever as the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children. Coronary artery aneurysms occur as a sequela of the vasculitis in 20–25% of untreated children. It is first detected at a mean of 10 days of illness and the peak frequency of coronary artery dilation or aneurysms occurs within four weeks of onset. Aneurysms are classified into small (internal diameter of vessel wall &lt;5 mm), medium (diameter ranging from 5–8 mm), and giant (diameter &gt; 8 mm). Saccular and fusiform aneurysms usually develop between 18 and 25 days after the onset of illness.

Even when treated with high-dose IVIG regimens within the first 10 days of illness, 5% of children with Kawasaki disease develop at the least transient coronary artery dilation and 1% develop giant aneurysms. Death can occur either due to myocardial infarction secondary to blood clot formation in a coronary artery aneurysm or to of a large coronary artery aneurysm. Death is most common two to 12 weeks after the onset of illness.

Many risk factors predicting coronary artery aneurysms have been identified, including persistent fever after IVIG therapy, low hemoglobin concentrations, low albumin concentrations, high white-blood-cell count, high band count, high CRP concentrations, male sex, and age less than one year.
Coronary artery lesions resulting from Kawasaki disease change dynamically with time. Resolution one to two years after the onset of the disease has been observed in half of vessels with coronary aneurysms. Narrowing of the coronary artery, which occurs as a result of the healing process of the vessel wall, often leads to significant obstruction of the blood vessel and the heart not receiving enough blood and oxygen. This can eventually lead to heart muscle tissue death, i.e., myocardial infarction (MI).

MI caused by thrombotic occlusion in an aneurysmal, stenotic, or both aneurysmal and stenotic coronary artery is the main cause of death from Kawasaki disease. The highest risk of MI occurs in the first year after the onset of the disease. MI in children presents with different symptoms from those in adults. The main symptoms were shock, unrest, vomiting, and abdominal pain; chest pain was most common in older children. Most of these children had the attack occurring during sleep or at rest, and around one-third of attacks were asymptomatic.

Valvular insufficiencies, particularly of mitral or tricuspid valves, are often observed in the acute phase of Kawasaki disease due to inflammation of the heart valve or inflammation of the heart muscle-induced myocardial dysfunction, regardless of coronary involvement. These lesions mostly disappear with the resolution of acute illness, but a very small group of the lesions persist and progress. There is also late-onset aortic or mitral insufficiency caused by thickening or deformation of fibrosed valves, with the timing ranging from several months to years after the onset of Kawasaki disease. Some of these lesions require valve replacement.

=== Other ===
Other Kawasaki disease complications have been described, such as aneurysm of other arteries: aortic aneurysm, with a higher number of reported cases involving the abdominal aorta, axillary artery aneurysm, brachiocephalic artery aneurysm, aneurysm of iliac and femoral arteries, and renal artery aneurysm. Other vascular complications can occur such as increased wall thickness and decreased distensibility of carotid arteries, aorta, and brachioradial artery. This change in the vascular tone is secondary to endothelial dysfunction. In addition, children with Kawasaki disease, with or without coronary artery complications, may have a more adverse cardiovascular risk profile later in life, and may benefit from long term monitoring and prevention approaches to both detect cardiovascular disease early such as thrombosis or stenosis and prevent onset. Examples of prevention approaches include lipid lowering medications, blood pressure medication, smoking cessation, and healthy active living.

Gastrointestinal complications in Kawasaki disease are similar to those observed in Henoch–Schönlein purpura, such as: intestinal obstruction, colon swelling, intestinal ischemia, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and acute abdomen.

Eye changes associated with the disease have been described since the 1980s, being found as uveitis, iridocyclitis, conjunctival hemorrhage, optic neuritis, amaurosis, and ocular artery obstruction. It can also be found as necrotizing vasculitis, progressing into peripheral gangrene.

The neurological complications per central nervous system lesions are increasingly reported. The neurological complications found are meningoencephalitis, subdural effusion, cerebral hypoperfusion, cerebral ischemia and infarct, cerebellar infarction, manifesting with seizures, chorea, hemiplegia, mental confusion, lethargy and coma, or even a cerebral infarction with no neurological manifestations. Other neurological complications from cranial nerve involvement are reported as ataxia, facial palsy, and sensorineural hearing loss. Behavioral changes are thought to be caused by localised cerebral hypoperfusion, can include attention deficits, learning deficits, emotional disorders (emotional lability, fear of night, and night terrors), and internalization problems (anxious, depressive or aggressive behavior).

== Causes ==
The specific cause of Kawasaki disease is unknown. A plausible explanation is that it may be caused by an infection that triggers an inappropriate immunologic cascade in a small number of genetically predisposed children. The pathogenesis is complex and incompletely understood. Various explanations exist. (See Classification)

Circumstantial evidence points to an infectious cause. Since recurrences are unusual in Kawasaki disease, it is thought that the trigger is more likely to be represented by a single pathogen, rather than a range of viral or bacterial agents. Various candidates have been implicated, including upper respiratory tract infection by some novel RNA virus. Despite intensive search, no single pathogen has been identified. There has been debate as to whether the infectious agent might be a superantigen (i.e. one commonly associated with excessive immune system activation). Current consensus favors an excessive immunologic response to a conventional antigen which usually provides future protection. Research points to an unidentified ubiquitous virus, possibly one that enters through the respiratory tract.

Seasonal trends in the appearance of new cases of Kawasaki disease have been linked to tropospheric wind patterns, which suggests wind-borne transport of something capable of triggering an immunologic cascade when inhaled by genetically susceptible children. Winds blowing from central Asia correlate with numbers of new cases of Kawasaki disease in Japan, Hawaii, and San Diego. These associations are themselves modulated by seasonal and interannual events in the El Niño–Southern Oscillation in winds and sea surface temperatures over the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. Efforts have been made to identify a possible pathogen in air-filters flown at altitude above Japan. One source has been suggested in northeastern China.

=== Genetics ===
Genetic susceptibility is suggested by increased incidence among children of Japanese descent around the world, and also among close and extended family members of affected people. Genetic factors are also thought to influence development of coronary artery aneurysms and response to treatment. The exact genetic contribution remains unknown. Genome-wide association studies and studies of individual candidate genes have together helped identify specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), mostly found in genes with immune regulatory functions. The associated genes and their levels of expression appear to vary among different ethnic groups, both with Asian and non-Asian backgrounds.

SNPs in &quot;FCGR2A&quot;, &quot;CASP3&quot;, &quot;BLK&quot;, &quot;ITPKC&quot;, &quot;CD40&quot; and &quot;ORAI1&quot; have all been linked to susceptibility, prognosis, and risk of developing coronary artery aneurysms. Various other possible susceptibility genes have been proposed, including polymorphisms in the HLA region, but their significance is disputed. Genetic susceptibility to Kawasaki disease appears complex. Gene–gene interactions also seem to affect susceptibility and prognosis. At an epigenetic level, altered DNA methylation has been proposed as an early mechanistic factor during the acute phase of the disease.

== Diagnosis ==

Since no specific laboratory test exists for Kawasaki disease, diagnosis must be based on clinical signs and symptoms, together with laboratory findings. Timely diagnosis requires careful history-taking and thorough physical examination. Establishing the diagnosis is difficult, especially early in the course of the illness, and frequently children are not diagnosed until they have seen several health-care providers. Many other serious illnesses can cause similar symptoms, and must be considered in the differential diagnosis, including scarlet fever, toxic shock syndrome, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and childhood mercury poisoning (infantile acrodynia).

Classically, five days of fever plus four of five diagnostic criteria must be met to establish the diagnosis. The criteria are:
# erythema of the lips or oral cavity or cracking of the lips
# rash on the trunk
# swelling or erythema of the hands or feet
# red eyes (conjunctival injection)
# swollen lymph node in the neck of at least 15 mm

Many children, especially infants, eventually diagnosed with Kawasaki disease, do not exhibit all of the above criteria. In fact, many experts now recommend treating for Kawasaki disease even if only three days of fever have passed and at least three diagnostic criteria are present, especially if other tests reveal abnormalities consistent with Kawasaki disease. In addition, the diagnosis can be made purely by the detection of coronary artery aneurysms in the proper clinical setting.

=== Investigations ===
A physical examination will demonstrate many of the features listed above.

Blood tests
* Complete blood count may reveal normocytic anemia and eventually thrombocytosis.
* Erythrocyte sedimentation rate will be elevated.
* C-reactive protein will be elevated.
* Liver function tests may show evidence of hepatic inflammation and low serum albumin levels.

Other optional tests include:
* Electrocardiogram may show evidence of ventricular dysfunction or, occasionally, arrhythmia due to myocarditis.
* Echocardiogram may show subtle coronary artery changes or, later, true aneurysms.
* Ultrasound or computerized tomography may show hydrops (enlargement) of the gallbladder.
* Urinalysis may show white blood cells and protein in the urine (pyuria and proteinuria) without evidence of bacterial growth.
* Lumbar puncture may show evidence of aseptic meningitis.
* Angiography was historically used to detect coronary artery aneurysms, and remains the gold standard for their detection, but is rarely used today unless coronary artery aneurysms have already been detected by echocardiography.

Biopsy is rarely performed, as it is not necessary for diagnosis.

=== Subtypes ===
Based on clinical findings, a diagnostic distinction may be made between the &quot;classic&quot; or &quot;typical&quot; presentation of Kawasaki disease and &quot;incomplete&quot; or &quot;atypical&quot; presentation of a &quot;suspected&quot; form of the disease. Regarding incomplete/atypical presentation, American Heart Association guidelines state that Kawasaki disease &quot;should be considered in the differential diagnosis of prolonged unexplained fever in childhood associated with any of the principal clinical features of the disease, and the diagnosis can be considered confirmed when coronary artery aneurysms are identified in such patients by echocardiography.&quot;

A further distinction between incomplete and atypical subtypes may also be made in the presence of non-typical symptoms.

=== Case definition ===
For study purposes, including vaccine safety monitoring, an international case definition has been proposed to categorize &#x27;definite&#x27; (i.e. complete/incomplete), &#x27;probable&#x27; and &#x27;possible&#x27; cases of Kawasaki disease.

===Differential diagnosis===
The broadness of the differential diagnosis is a challenge to timely diagnosis of Kawasaki disease. Infectious and noninfectious conditions requiring consideration include: measles and other viral infections (e.g. adenovirus, enterovirus); staphylococcal and streptococcal toxin-mediated diseases such as scarlet fever and toxic shock syndrome; drug hypersensitivity reactions (including Stevens Johnson syndrome); systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis; Rocky Mountain spotted fever or other rickettsial infections; and leptospirosis. Infectious conditions that can mimic Kawasaki disease include periorbital cellulitis, peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, cervical lymphadenitis, parvovirus B19, mononucleosis, rheumatic fever, meningitis, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Lyme disease.

==== Kawasaki-like disease temporally associated with COVID-19 ====
In 2020, reports of a Kawasaki-like disease following exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, emerged in the US and Europe. The World Health Organization is examining possible links with COVID-19. This emerging condition was named &quot;paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome&quot; by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, and &quot;multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children&quot; by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Guidance for diagnosis and reporting of cases has been issued by these organizations.

Several reported cases suggest that this Kawasaki-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome is not limited to children; there is the possibility of an analogous disease in adults, which has been termed MIS-A. Some suspected patients have presented with positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 and reports suggest intravenous immunoglobulin, anticoagulation, tocilizumab, plasmapheresis and steroids are potential treatments.

=== Classification ===
Debate has occurred about whether Kawasaki disease should be viewed as a characteristic immune response to some infectious pathogen, as an autoimmune process, or as an autoinflammatory disease (i.e. involving innate rather than adaptive immune pathways). Overall, immunological research suggests that Kawasaki disease is associated with a response to a conventional antigen (rather than a superantigen) that involves both activation of the innate immune system and also features of an adaptive immune response. Identification of the exact nature of the immune process involved in Kawasaki disease could help guide research aimed at improving clinical management.

Inflammation, or vasculitis, of the arteries and veins occurs throughout the body, usually caused by increased production of the cells of the immune system to a pathogen, or autoimmunity. Systemic vasculitides may be classified according to the type of cells involved in the proliferation, as well as the specific type of tissue damage occurring within the vein or arterial walls. Under this classification scheme for systemic vasculitis, Kawasaki disease is considered to be a necrotizing vasculitis (also called necrotizing angiitis), which may be identified histologically by the occurrence of necrosis (tissue death), fibrosis, and proliferation of cells associated with inflammation in the inner layer of the vascular wall.

Other diseases involving necrotizing vasculitis include polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Henoch–Schönlein purpura, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

Kawasaki disease may be further classified as a medium-sized vessel vasculitis, affecting medium- and small-sized blood vessels, such as the smaller cutaneous vasculature (veins and arteries in the skin) that range from 50 to 100 μm in diameter. Kawasaki disease is also considered to be a primary childhood vasculitis, a disorder associated with vasculitis that mainly affects children under the age of 18. A recent, consensus-based evaluation of vasculitides occurring primarily in children resulted in a classification scheme for these disorders, to distinguish them and suggest a more concrete set of diagnostic criteria for each. Within this classification of childhood vasculitides, Kawasaki disease is, again, a predominantly medium-sized vessel vasculitis.

It can also be classed as an autoimmune form of vasculitis. It is not associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, unlike other vasculitic disorders associated with them (such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis). This form of categorization is relevant for appropriate treatment.

== Treatment ==
Children with Kawasaki disease should be hospitalized and cared for by a physician who has experience with this disease. In an academic medical center, care is often shared between pediatric cardiology, pediatric rheumatology, and pediatric infectious disease specialists (although no specific infectious agent has yet been identified). To prevent damage to coronary arteries, treatment should be started immediately following the diagnosis.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is the standard treatment for Kawasaki disease and is administered in high doses with marked improvement usually noted within 24 hours. If the fever does not respond, an additional dose may be considered. In rare cases, a third dose may be given. IVIG is most useful within the first seven days of fever onset, to prevent coronary artery aneurysm. IVIG given within the first 10 days of the disease reduces the risk of damage to the coronary arteries in children, without serious adverse effects. A 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that no prediction models of IVIG resistance in patients with Kawasaki disease could accurately distinguish the resistance. The largest clinical study to date on treatment of resistant Kawasaki disease has shown that infliximab is more effective and safer than a second dose of IVIG in treating children with IVIG-resistant Kawasaki Disease, offering faster fever resolution and reduced hospitalization times without significant adverse events.

Salicylate therapy, particularly aspirin, remains an important part of the treatment (though questioned by some) but salicylates alone are not as effective as IVIG. There is limited evidence to indicate whether children should continue to receive salicylate as part of their treatment. Aspirin therapy is started at high doses until the fever subsides, and then is continued at a low dose when the patient returns home, usually for two months to prevent blood clots from forming. Except for Kawasaki disease and a few other indications, aspirin is otherwise normally not recommended for children due to its association with Reye syndrome. Because children with Kawasaki disease will be taking aspirin for up to several months, vaccination against varicella and influenza is required, as these infections are most likely to cause Reye syndrome.

High-dose aspirin is associated with anemia and does not confer benefit to disease outcomes.

About 15-20% of children following the initial IVIG infusion show persistent or recurrent fever and are classified as IVIG-resistant. While the use of TNF alpha blockers (TNF-α) may reduce treatment resistance and the infusion reaction after treatment initiation, further research is needed. Due to the potential involvement of the upregulated calcium-nuclear factor of activated T cells pathway in the development of the disease, a 2019 study found that the combination of ciclosporin and IVIG infusion can suppress coronary artery abnormalities. Further research is needed to determine which patients would respond best to this treatment.

Corticosteroids have also been used, especially when other treatments fail or symptoms recur, but in a randomized controlled trial, the addition of corticosteroid to immune globulin and aspirin did not improve outcome. Additionally, corticosteroid use in the setting of Kawasaki disease is associated with increased risk of coronary artery aneurysm, so its use is generally contraindicated in this setting. In cases of Kawasaki disease refractory to IVIG, cyclophosphamide and plasma exchange have been investigated as possible treatments, with variable outcomes. However, a Cochrane review published in 2017 (updated in 2022) found that, in children, the use of corticosteroids in the acute phase of KD was associated with improved coronary artery abnormalities, shorter hospital stays, a decreased duration of clinical symptoms, and reduced inflammatory marker levels. Patient populations based in Asia, people with higher risk scores, and those receiving longer steroid treatment may have greater benefit from steroid use.

== Prognosis ==
With early treatment, rapid recovery from the acute symptoms can be expected, and the risk of coronary artery aneurysms is greatly reduced. Untreated, the acute symptoms of Kawasaki disease are self-limited (&quot;i.e.&quot; the patient will recover eventually), but the risk of coronary artery involvement is much greater, even many years later. Many cases of myocardial infarction in young adults have now been attributed to Kawasaki disease that went undiagnosed during childhood. Overall, about 2% of patients die from complications of coronary vasculitis.

Laboratory evidence of increased inflammation combined with demographic features (male sex, age less than six months or greater than eight years) and incomplete response to IVIG therapy create a profile of a high-risk patient with Kawasaki disease. The likelihood that an aneurysm will resolve appears to be determined in large measure by its initial size, in which the smaller aneurysms have a greater likelihood of regression. Other factors are positively associated with the regression of aneurysms, including being younger than a year old at the onset of Kawasaki disease, fusiform rather than saccular aneurysm morphology, and an aneurysm location in a distal coronary segment. The highest rate of progression to stenosis occurs among those who develop large aneurysms. The worst prognosis occurs in children with giant aneurysms. This severe outcome may require further treatment such as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, coronary artery stenting, bypass grafting, and even cardiac transplantation.

A relapse of symptoms may occur soon after initial treatment with IVIG. This usually requires rehospitalization and retreatment. Treatment with IVIG can cause allergic and nonallergic acute reactions, aseptic meningitis, fluid overload, and rarely, other serious reactions. Overall, life-threatening complications resulting from therapy for Kawasaki disease are exceedingly rare, especially compared with the risk of nontreatment. Evidence indicates Kawasaki disease produces altered lipid metabolism that persists beyond the clinical resolution of the disease.

Rarely, recurrence can occur in Kawasaki disease with or without treatment.

== Epidemiology ==
Kawasaki disease affects boys more than girls, with people of Asian ethnicity, particularly Japanese people. The higher incidence in Asian populations is thought to be linked to genetic susceptibility. Incidence rates vary between countries.

Currently, Kawasaki disease is the most commonly diagnosed pediatric vasculitis in the world. By far, the highest incidence of Kawasaki disease occurs in Japan, with the most recent study placing the attack rate at 218.6 per 100,000 children less than five years of age (about one in 450 children). At this present attack rate, more than one in 150 children in Japan will develop Kawasaki disease during their lifetimes.

However, its incidence in the United States is increasing. Kawasaki disease is predominantly a disease of young children, with 80% of patients younger than five years of age. About 2,000–4,000 cases are identified in the U.S. each year (9 to 19 per 100,000 children younger than five years of age). In the continental United States, Kawasaki disease is more common during the winter and early spring, boys with the disease outnumber girls by ≈1.5–1.7:1, and 76% of affected children are less than 5 years of age.

In the United Kingdom, before 2000, it was diagnosed in fewer than one in every 25,000 people per year. Incidence of the disease doubled from 1991 to 2000, however, with four cases per 100,000 children in 1991 compared with a rise of eight cases per 100,000 in 2000. By 2017, this figure had risen to 12 in 100,000 people with 419 diagnosed cases of Kawasaki disease in the United Kingdom.

In Japan, the rate is 240 in every 100,000 people.

Coronary artery aneurysms due to Kawasaki disease are believed to account for 5% of acute coronary syndrome cases in adults under 40 years of age.

== History ==
The disease was first reported by Tomisaku Kawasaki in a four-year-old child with a rash and fever at the Red Cross Hospital in Tokyo in January 1961, and he later published a report on 50 similar cases. Later, Kawasaki and colleagues were persuaded of definite cardiac involvement when they studied and reported 23 cases, of which 11 (48%) patients had abnormalities detected by an electrocardiogram. In 1974, the first description of this disorder was published in the English-language literature. In 1976, Melish et al. described the same illness in 16 children in Hawaii. Melish and Kawasaki had independently developed the same diagnostic criteria for the disorder, which are still used today to make the diagnosis of classic Kawasaki disease.

A question was raised whether the disease only started during the period between 1960 and 1970, but later a preserved heart of a seven-year-old boy who died in 1870 was examined and showed three aneurysms of the coronary arteries with clots, as well as pathologic changes consistent with Kawasaki disease. Kawasaki disease is now recognized worldwide. Why cases began to emerge across all continents around the 1960s and 1970s is unclear. Possible explanations could include confusion with other diseases such as scarlet fever, and easier recognition stemming from modern healthcare factors such as the widespread use of antibiotics. In particular, old pathological descriptions from Western countries of infantile polyarteritis nodosa coincide with reports of fatal cases of Kawasaki disease.

In the United States and other developed nations, Kawasaki disease appears to have replaced acute rheumatic fever as the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children.

<text>The AAC SeaStar is an amphibious biplane that was produced in kitplane form. The aircraft is built largely of composite materials and features wings that may be easily removed for transport, and a ballistic recovery system in the form of a parachute that can be deployed from the engine nacelle.

AAC also marketed a Super Pétrel model in 2011.

This aircraft should not be confused with another composite-built small flying boat with the same name, the SeaStar Aircraft SeaStar.

<doc id="1038505" wikidata="Q2094875" url="?curid=1038505" title="Douglas A2D Skyshark">
<text>The Douglas A2D Skyshark was an American turboprop-powered attack aircraft built by the Douglas Aircraft Company for the United States Navy. The program was substantially delayed by engine reliability problems, and was canceled because more promising jet attack aircraft had entered development and the smaller escort carriers the A2D was intended to utilize were being phased out.

==Design and development==

On 25 June 1945, the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) asked Douglas Aircraft for a turboprop-driven aircraft. Three proposals were put forth in the next year and a half: the D-557A, to use two General Electric TG-100s (T31s) in wing nacelles; the D-557B, the same engine, with contra-rotating propellers; and the D-557C, to use the Westinghouse 25D. These were canceled due to engine development difficulties, but BuAer continued to seek an answer to the high fuel-consumption of jet aircraft.

On 11 June 1947 Douglas received the Navy&#x27;s letter of intent for a carrier-based turboprop. The need to operate from &quot;Casablanca&quot;-class escort carriers dictated the use of a turboprop instead of jet power.
While it resembled the AD Skyraider, the A2D was different in a number of unseen ways. The 5,100-equivalent shaft horsepower (3,800 kW) Allison XT40-A2 engine had more than double the horsepower of the Skyraider&#x27;s R-3350. The XT40 installation on the Skyshark used contra-rotating propellers to harness all the available power. Wing root thickness decreased from 17% to 12%, while both the height of the tail and its area grew.

Engine development problems delayed the first flight until 26 May 1950, made at Edwards Air Force Base by George Jansen.

Navy test pilot Cdr. Hugh Wood was killed attempting to land the first prototype XA2D-1, BuNo &quot;122988&quot;, on 19 December 1950, on its 15th flight. He was unable to check the rate of descent, resulting in a high-impact crash on the runway. The investigation found the starboard power section of the coupled Allison XT40A turboprop engine had failed and did not declutch. This meant the surviving engine was powering the failed engine&#x27;s compressor, using up much of its available power. Additionally, the propellers failed to feather. As the wings&#x27; lift disappeared, a fatal sink rate was induced.

Additional instrumentation and an automatic decoupler was added to the second prototype, but by the time it was ready to fly on 3 April 1952, sixteen months had passed, and with all-jet designs being developed, the A2D program was essentially dead. Total flight time on the lost airframe was barely 20 hours.

Allison failed to deliver a &quot;production&quot; engine until 1953, and while testing an XA2D with that engine, test pilot C. G. &quot;Doc&quot; Livingston pulled out of a dive and was surprised by a loud noise and pitch up. His windscreen was covered with oil and the chase pilot told Livingston that the propellers were gone. The gearbox had failed, but Livingston successfully landed the airplane. The A4D was ready to fly by the summer of 1954, but the escort carriers were being mothballed, so time had run out for the troubled A2D program.

Twelve Skysharks were built, two prototypes and ten pre-production aircraft. Most were scrapped or destroyed in accidents, and only one has survived.

<doc id="1038519" wikidata="Q81697" url="?curid=1038519" title="Barbette">
<text>Barbettes are several types of gun emplacement in terrestrial fortifications or on naval ships.

In recent naval usage, a barbette is a protective circular armour support for a heavy gun turret. This evolved from earlier forms of gun protection that eventually led to the pre-dreadnought. The name &quot;barbette&quot; ultimately comes from fortification: it originally meant a raised platform or mound, as in the French phrase &quot;en barbette&quot;, which refers to the practice of firing a cannon over a parapet rather than through an embrasure in a fortification&#x27;s casemate. The former gives better angles of fire but less protection than the latter. The disappearing gun was a variation on the barbette gun; it consisted of a heavy gun on a carriage that would retract behind a parapet or into a gunpit for reloading. Barbettes were primarily used in coastal defences, but saw some use in a handful of warships, and some inland fortifications. The term is also used for certain aircraft gun mounts.

Shipboard barbettes were primarily used in armoured warships, starting in the 1860s during a period of intense experimentation with other mounting systems for heavy guns at sea. In these, gun barrels usually protruded over the barbette edge, so barbettes provided only partial protection, mainly for the ammunition supply. Alternatives included the heavily-armoured gun turret and an armoured, fixed central gun battery. By the late 1880s, all three systems were replaced with a hybrid barbette-turret system that combined the benefits of both types. The armoured vertical tube that supported the new gun mount was referred to as a barbette.

Guns with restricted arcs of fire mounted in heavy bombers during World War II—such those in the tail of the aircraft, as opposed to fully revolving turrets—were also sometimes referred to as having barbette mounts, though usage of the term is primarily restricted to British publications. American authors generally refer to such mounts as tail guns or as tail gun turrets.

==Use in fortifications==

The use of barbette mountings originated in ground fortifications. The term originally referred to a raised platform on a rampart for one or more guns, enabling them to be fired over a parapet. This gave rise to the phrase &quot;en barbette&quot;, which referred to a gun placed to fire over a parapet, rather than through an embrasure, an opening in a fortification wall. While an &quot;en barbette&quot; emplacement offered wider arcs of fire, it also exposed the gun&#x27;s crew to greater danger from hostile fire. In addition, since the barbette position would be higher than a casemate position—that is, a gun firing through an embrasure—it would generally have a greater field of fire.

The American military theorist Dennis Hart Mahan suggested that light guns, particularly howitzers, were best suited for barbette emplacements since they could fire explosive shells and could be easily withdrawn when they came under enemy fire. Fortifications in the 19th century typically employed both casemate and barbette emplacements. For example, the Russian Constantine Battery outside Sevastopol was equipped with 43 heavy guns in its seaward side during the Crimean War in the mid-1850s; of these, 27 were barbette mounted, with the rest in casemates.

A modified version of the barbette type was the disappearing gun, which placed a heavy gun on a carriage that retracted behind a parapet for reloading; this better protected the crew, and made the gun harder to target, since it was only visible while it was firing. The type was usually used for coastal defence guns. As naval gun turrets improved to allow greater elevation and range, many disappearing guns, most of which were limited in elevation, were seen as obsolescent; with aircraft becoming prominent in the First World War, they were largely seen as obsolete. However, they remained in use through the early Second World War, at least by the United States, due to limited funding for replacement weapons between the wars.

Later heavy coastal guns were often protected in hybrid installations, in wide casemates with cantilevered overhead cover partially covering a barbette or gunhouse mount.

==Use in warships==

Following the introduction of ironclad warships in the early 1860s, naval designers grappled with the problem of mounting heavy guns in the most efficient way possible, beginning with broadside box batteries and quickly moving to rotating gun turrets, since these afforded the ability to fire directly ahead, which was deemed important due to the adoption of ramming tactic after the Battle of Lissa in 1866. But early turrets were very heavy, which necessitated a low freeboard to reduce topweight and a corresponding tendency to capsize. By the 1870s, designers had shifted to the rotating barbette mount, which eschewed armor protection to reduce weight; this would permit the use of heavy guns in high-freeboard ships. This new type of vessel was referred to as a barbette ship, to differentiate them from turret ships and central battery ships.

In the late 1880s, the British Royal Navy adopted a new mounting that combined the benefits of both kinds of mounts in the . A heavily armoured, rotating gun house was added to the revolving platform, which kept the guns and their crews protected. The gun house was smaller and lighter than the old-style turrets, which still permitted placement higher in the ship and the corresponding benefits to stability and seakeeping. This innovation gradually became known simply as a turret, though the armored tube that held the turret substructure, which included the shell and propellant handling rooms and the ammunition hoists, was still referred to as a barbette. These ships were the prototype of the so-called pre-dreadnought battleships, which proved to be broadly influential in all major navies over the next fifteen years.

==Use in bomber aircraft==
When applied to military aircraft, largely in aviation history books written by British historians, a barbette is a position on an aircraft where a gun is in a mounting which has a restricted arc of fire when compared to a turret, or which is remotely mounted away from the gunner. As such it is frequently used to describe the tail gunner position on bombers such as the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, with American aviation books frequently describing the position as a tail gun turret, or simply as a tail gun.

The term &quot;barbette&quot; is also used by some, again primarily British historians, to describe a remotely aimed and operated gun turret emplacement on almost any non-American military aircraft of World War II, but it is &quot;not&quot; usable in a direct translation for the varying German language terms used on &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft of that era for such emplacements. As just one example, the German Heinkel He 177A heavy bomber had such a remotely operated twin-MG 131 machine gun &quot;Fernbedienbare Drehlafette&quot; FDL 131Z &quot;(Z – &quot;zwilling&quot;&quot;/twin) powered forward dorsal gun turret, with the full translation of the German term comprising the prefix as &quot;Remotely controlled rotating gun mount&quot;. The term &quot;lafette&quot; in German actually refers to a gun carriage of nearly any type, with its original use as being for the mounting design for bombard-style siege guns of the Middle Ages.

<text>The Han River, also known by its Chinese names Hanshui and Hanjiang, is a major river in Central China. A left tributary of the Yangtze, the longest river in Asia, it has a length of and is the longest tributary of the Yangtze system.

The river gave its name to the ancient Chinese Han dynasty, which marked one of ancient China&#x27;s first golden ages and through it, to the Han Chinese, the dominant ethnic group in modern China and the most populous ethnic group in the world. It is also the namesake of the city of Hanzhong on its upper course.

==Geography==
The headwaters of the Han flow from Mount Bozhong in southwestern Shaanxi. The stream then travels east across the southern part of that province. Its highland valley—known as the Qinba Laolin—divides and is protected by the Qinling or Qin Mountains to its north and the Dabashan or Daba Mountains to its south. The main cities are Hanzhong in the west and Ankang in the east. It then enters Hubei. It crosses most of Hubei from the northwest to the southeast, flowing into the Yangtze at the provincial capital Wuhan, a city of several million inhabitants. The merging rivers divide the city of Wuhan into three sections: Wuchang in the south, Hankou to the northeast of the confluence, and Hanyang to its southwest. The area surrounding the confluence is known as the Jianghan Plain.

Apart from a few major basins, such as the area around Hanzhong, the highlands of the Han were covered in primeval forests as late as the 19th century. The Nanshan Forest covered the northern slopes; the Bashan Forest, the southern.

==Hydroelectric Projects==
Danjiangkou Dam was constructed on the Han River in northern Hubei in 1958. It has been heightened since. The Danjiangkou Reservoir created thereby is now used as part of the South–North Water Transfer Project.

==Culture==
The river was previously considered holy by the inhabitants on its banks. It is also considered part of the dividing line between northern and southern China.

<text>Popular Electronics was an American magazine published by John August Media, LLC, and hosted at TechnicaCuriosa.com. The magazine was started by Ziff-Davis Publishing Company in October 1954 for electronics hobbyists and experimenters. It soon became the &quot;World&#x27;s Largest-Selling Electronics Magazine&quot;. In April 1957, Ziff-Davis reported an average net paid circulation of 240,151 copies. &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; was published until October 1982 when, in November 1982, Ziff-Davis launched a successor magazine, Computers &amp; Electronics. During its last year of publication by Ziff-Davis, &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; reported an average monthly circulation of 409,344 copies. The title was sold to Gernsback Publications, and their &quot;Hands-On Electronics&quot; magazine was renamed to &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; in February 1989, and published until December 1999. The Popular Electronics trademark was then acquired by John August Media, who revived the magazine, the digital edition of which is hosted at TechnicaCuriosa.com, along with sister titles, &quot;Mechanix Illustrated&quot; and &quot;Popular Astronomy&quot;.

A cover story on &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; could launch a new product or company. The most famous issue, January 1975, had the Altair 8800 computer on the cover and ignited the home computer revolution. Paul Allen showed that issue to Bill Gates. They wrote a BASIC interpreter for the Altair computer and started Microsoft.

==How it started==

&quot;Radio &amp; Television News&quot; was a magazine for professionals and the editors wanted to create a magazine for hobbyists. Ziff-Davis had started &quot;Popular Aviation&quot; in 1927 and &quot;Popular Photography&quot; in 1934 but found that Gernsback Publications had the trademark on Popular Electronics. It was used in &quot;Radio-Craft&quot; from 1943 until 1948. Ziff-Davis bought the trademark and started &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; with the October 1954 issue.

Many of the editors and authors worked for both Ziff-Davis magazines. Initially Oliver Read was the editor of both &quot;Radio &amp; Television News&quot; and &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;. Read was promoted to Publisher in June 1956. Oliver Perry Ferrell took over as editor of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; and William A. Stocklin became editor of &quot;Radio &amp; Television News&quot;. In &quot;Radio &amp; TV News &quot;John T. Frye wrote a column on a fictional repair shop where the proprietor, Mac, would interact with other technicians and customers. The reader would learn repair techniques for servicing radios and TVs. In &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; his column was about two high school boys, Carl and Jerry. Each month the boys would have an adventure that would teach the reader about electronics.

By 1954 building audio and radio kits was a growing pastime. Heathkit and many others offered kits that included all of the parts with detailed instructions. The premier cover shows the assembly of a Heathkit A-7B audio amplifier. &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; would offer projects that were built from scratch; that is, the individual parts were purchased at a local electronics store or by mail order. The early issues often showed these as father and son projects.

Most of the early projects used vacuum tubes, as transistors (which had just become available to hobbyists) were expensive: the small-signal Raytheon CK722 transistor was US$3.50 in the December 1954 issue, while a typical small-signal vacuum tube (the 12AX7) was $0.61. Lou Garner wrote the feature story for the first issue, a battery-powered tube radio that could be used on a bicycle. Later he was given a column called Transistor Topics (June 1956). Transistors soon cost less than a dollar and transistor projects became common in every issue of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;. The column was renamed to Solid State in 1965 and ran under his byline until December 1978.

==Typical 1962 issue==
The July 1962 issue had 112 pages, the editor was Oliver P. Ferrell and the monthly circulation was 400,000. The magazine had a full page of electronics news that was called &quot;POP&#x27;tronics News Scope.&quot; In January 2000 a successor magazine was renamed Poptronics. In the 1960s, Fawcett Publications had a competing magazine, &quot;Electronics Illustrated&quot;.

The cover showed a 15-inch (38 cm) black and white TV kit by Conar that cost $135. The feature construction story was a &quot;Radiation Fallout Monitor&quot; for &quot;keeping track of the radiation level in your neighborhood.&quot; (The Cuban Missile Crisis happened that October.) Other construction projects included &quot;The Fish Finder&quot;, an underwater temperature probe; the &quot;Transistorized Tremolo&quot; for an electric guitar; and a one tube VHF receiver to listen to aircraft.

There were regular columns for Citizens Band (CB), amateur radio and shortwave listening (SWL). These would show a reader with his radio equipment each month. (Almost all of the readers were male.) Lou Garner&#x27;s Transistor Topics covers the new transistorized FM stereo receivers and several readers&#x27; circuits. John T. Frye&#x27;s fictional characters, Carl and Jerry, use a PH meter to locate the source of pollution in a river.

== Authors and kits ==

As Editor, Olivier Ferrell built a stable of authors who contributed interesting construction projects. These projects established the style of Popular Electronics for years to come. Two of the most prolific authors were Daniel Meyer and Don Lancaster.

Daniel Meyer graduated from Southwest Texas State (1957) and became an engineer at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. He soon started writing hobbyist articles. The first was in &quot;Electronics World&quot; (May 1960) and latter he had a 2 part cover feature for &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; (October, November 1962). The March 1963 issue of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; featured his ultrasonic listening device on the cover.

Don Lancaster graduated from Lafayette College (1961) and Arizona State University (1966). A 1960s fad was to have colored lights synchronized with music. This psychedelic lighting was made economical by the development of the silicon controlled rectifier (SCR). Don&#x27;s first published article was &quot;Solid-State 3-Channel Color Organ&quot; in the April 1963 issue of &quot;Electronics World&quot;. He was paid $150 for the story.

The projects in &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; changed from vacuum tube to solid state in the early 1960s. Tube circuits used a metal chassis with sockets, transistor circuits worked best on a printed circuit board. They would often contain components that were not available at the local electronics parts store.

Dan Meyer saw the business opportunity in providing circuit boards and parts for the &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; projects. In January 1964 he left Southwest Research Institute to start an electronics kit company. He continued to write articles and ran the mail order kit business from his home in San Antonio, Texas. By 1965 he was providing the kits for other authors such as Lou Garner. In 1967 he sold a kit for Don Lancaster&#x27;s &quot;IC-67 Metal Locator&quot;. In early 1967 Meyer moved his growing business from his home to a new building on a 3-acre (12,000 m2) site in San Antonio. The Daniel E. Meyer Company (DEMCO) became Southwest Technical Products Corporation (SWTPC) that fall.

In 1967, &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; had 6 articles by Dan Meyer and 4 by Don Lancaster. Seven of that year&#x27;s cover stories featured kits sold by SWTPC. In the years 1966 to 1971 SWTPC&#x27;s authors wrote 64 articles and had 25 cover stories in &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;. (Don Lancaster alone had 23 articles and 10 were cover stories.) The &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot; did a feature story on Southwest Technical Products in November 1972. &quot;Meyer built his mail-order business from scratch to more than $1 million in sales in six years.&quot; The company was shipping 100 kits a day from 1800 square feet (1,700 m2) of buildings.

Others noticed SWTPC success. Forrest Mims, a founder of MITS (Altair 8800), tells about his &quot;Light-Emitting Diodes&quot; cover story (&quot;Popular Electronics&quot;, November 1970) in an interview with &quot;Creative Computing&quot;.
In March, I sold my first article to Popular Electronics magazine, a feature about light-emitting diodes. At one of our midnight meetings I suggested that we emulate Southwest Technical Products and develop a project article for Popular Electronics. The article would give us free advertising for the kit version of the project, and the magazine would even pay us for the privilege of printing it!

The November 1970 issue also has an article by Forrest M. Mims and Henry E. Roberts titled &quot;Assemble an LED Communicator - The Opticon.&quot; A kit of parts could be ordered from MITS in Albuquerque, New Mexico. &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; paid $400 for the article.

== Merger with &quot;Electronics World&quot; ==

&quot;Radio &amp; Television News&quot; became &quot;Electronics World&quot; in 1959 and in January 1972 was merged into &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;. The process started in the summer of 1971 with a new editor, Milton S. Snitzer, replacing the longtime editor, Oliver P. Ferrell. The publishers decided to focus on topics with prosperous advertisers, such as CB Radio and audio equipment. Construction projects were no longer the feature articles. They were replaced by new product reviews. The change in editorial direction upset many authors. Dan Meyer wrote a letter in his SWTPC catalog referring to the magazine, &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; with &quot;Electronics World&quot;, as &quot;PEEW&quot;. He urged his customers to switch to &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot;.

Don Lancaster, Daniel Meyer, Forrest Mims, Ed Roberts, John Simonton and other authors switched to Radio-Electronics. Even Solid State columnist Lou Garner moved to &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; for a year. Les Solomon, the &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; Technical Editor, wrote 6 articles in the rival &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; using the pseudonym &quot;B. R. Rogen&quot;. In 1972 and 1973 some of the best projects appeared in &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; as the new &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; digested the merger. The upcoming personal computer benefited from this competition between &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; and &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;.

In September 1973 &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; published Don Lancaster&#x27;s TV Typewriter, a low cost video display. In July 1974 &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; published the Mark-8 Personal Minicomputer based on the Intel 8008 processor. The publishers noted the success of &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; and Arthur P. Salsberg took over as Editor in 1974. Salsberg and Technical Editor, Leslie Solomon, brought back the featured construction projects. &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; needed a computer project so they selected Ed Roberts&#x27; Altair 8800 computer based on the improved Intel 8080 processor. The January 1975 issue of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; had the Altair computer on the cover and this launched the home computer revolution.
(However, Walter Isaacson&#x27;s biography of Steve Jobs incorrectly identified the magazine that ran the article as &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;.)

The magazine was digest size () for the first 20 years. The cover logo was a sans-serif typeface in a rectangular box. The covers featured a large image of the feature story, usually a construction project. In September 1970 the cover logo was changed to an underlined serif typeface. The magazine&#x27;s content, typography and layout were also updated. In January 1972 the cover logo added a second line, &quot;including Electronics World&quot;, and the volume number was restarted at 1. This second line was used for two years. The large photo of the feature project was gone, replaced by a textual list of articles. In August 1974 the magazine switched to a larger letter size format (). This was done to allow larger illustrations such as schematics, to switch printing to offset presses, and respond to advertisers desire for larger ad pages. The longtime tag line, &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Selling Electronics Magazine&quot;, was moved from the Table of Contents page to the cover.

== Personal computers ==

There is debate about what machine was the first personal computer, the Altair 8800 (1975), the Mark-8 (1974), or even back to Kenbak-1 (1971). The computer in the January 1975 issue of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; captured the attention of the 400,000 or so readers. Before then, home computers were lucky to sell a hundred units. The Altair sold thousands in the first year. By the end of 1975 there were a dozen companies producing computer kits and peripherals using the Altair circuit bus, later renamed the S-100 bus and set as an IEEE standard.

The February 1975 issue featured an &quot;All Solid-State TV Camera&quot; by three Stanford University students: Terry Walker, Harry Garland and Roger Melen. While the Cyclops Camera, as it was called, was designed to use an oscilloscope for the image display, the article mentions that it could also be connected to the Altair computer. It soon was, the authors got one of the first Altair computers and designed an interface for the camera. They also designed a full color video display for the Altair, &quot;The TV Dazzler&quot;, that appeared on the cover of the February 1976 issue. This was the start of Cromemco, a computer company that grew to over 500 employees by 1983.

The internet did not exist in 1975 but time-sharing computers did. With a computer terminal and a modem a user could dial into a large multi-user computer. Lee Felsenstein wanted make low-cost versions of modems and terminals available to the hobbyist. The March 1976 issue had the &quot;Pennywhistle Modem&quot; and the July 1976 issue had the &quot;SOL Intelligent Terminal&quot;. The SOL, built by Processor Technology, was really an Altair compatible computer and became one of the most successful personal computers at that time.

&quot;Popular Electronics&quot; had many other computer projects such as the Altair 680, the Speechlab voice recognition board and the COSMAC ELF. They did not have the field to themselves. A dedicated computer magazine, &quot;Byte&quot;, was started in September 1975. It was soon followed by other new magazines. By the end of 1977, fully assembled computers such as Apple II, Radio Shack TRS-80, and the Commodore PET were on the market. Building computer kits was soon replaced by plugging in assembled boards.

In 1982, Popular Electronics helped to introduce personal computer programming with its Programmer’s Notebook column written by Jim Keogh . Each column focused on a game programming. The column continued onto Computer &amp; Electronics Magazine. 

== Computers &amp; Electronics ==

&quot;Popular Electronics&quot; continued with a full range of construction projects using the newest technologies such as microprocessors and other programmable devices. In November 1982 the magazine became &quot;Computers &amp; Electronics&quot;. There were more equipment reviews and fewer construction projects. One of the last major projects was a bidirectional analog-to-digital converter for the Apple II computer published in July and August 1983. Art Salsberg left at the end of 1983 and Seth R. Alpert became editor. The magazine dropped all project articles and just reviewed hardware and software. The circulation was almost 600,000 in January 1985 when Forrest Mims wrote about the tenth anniversary of the Altair 8800 computer.

In October 1984 Art Salsberg started a competing magazine, &quot;Modern Electronics&quot;. Editor Alexander W. Burawa and contributors Forrest Mims, Len Feldman, and Glenn Hauser moved to &quot;Modern Electronics&quot;. Here is how Art Salsberg described the new magazine.
Directed to enthusiasts like yourselves, who savor learning more about the latest developments in electronics and computer hardware, Modern Electronics shows you what&#x27;s new in the world of electronics/computers, how this equipment works, how to use them, and construction plans for useful electronic devices.

Many of you probably know of me from my decade-long stewardship of Popular Electronics magazine, which changed its name and editorial philosophy last year to distance itself from active electronics enthusiasts who move fluidly across electronics and computer product areas. In a sense, then, Modern Electronics is the successor to the original concept of Popular Electronics …
The last issue of &quot;Computers &amp; Electronics&quot; was April 1985. The magazine still had 600,000 readers but the intense competition from other computer magazines resulted in flat advertising revenues.

==Ziff-Davis asset sale==
In 1953, William B. Ziff, Jr. (age 23) was thrust into the publishing business when his father died of a heart attack. In 1982, Ziff was diagnosed with prostate cancer so he asked his three sons (ages 14 to 20) if they wanted to run a publishing empire. They did not. Ziff wanted to simplify the estate by selling some of the magazines. In November 1984, CBS bought the consumer group for $362.5 million and Rupert Murdoch bought the business group for $350 million.

This left Ziff-Davis with the computer group and the database publisher (Information Access Company.) These groups were not profitable. Ziff took time off to successfully battle the prostate cancer. (He lived until 2006.) When he returned he focused on magazines like &quot;PC Magazine&quot; and &quot;MacUser&quot; to rebuild Ziff-Davis. In 1994 he and his sons sold Ziff-Davis for $1.4 billion.

== Gernsback Publications ==
The title &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; was sold to Gernsback Publications and their &quot;Hands-On Electronics&quot; magazine was renamed to &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; in February 1989. This version was published until it was merged with &quot;Electronics Now&quot; to become &quot;Poptronics&quot; in January 2000. In late 2002, Gernsback Publications went out of business and the January 2003 &quot;Poptronics&quot; was the last issue.

<doc id="1038531" wikidata="Q1123441" url="?curid=1038531" title="Russian battleship Potemkin">
<text>The Russian battleship &quot;Potemkin&quot; (, &quot;Prince Potemkin of Taurida&quot;) was a pre-dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Russian Navy&#x27;s Black Sea Fleet. She became famous during the Revolution of 1905, when her crew mutinied against their officers. This event later formed the basis for Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s 1925 silent film &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot;.

After the mutineers sought asylum in Constanța, Romania, and after the Russians recovered the ship, her name was changed to Panteleimon. She accidentally sank a Russian submarine in 1909 and was badly damaged when she ran aground in 1911. During World War I, &quot;Panteleimon&quot; participated in the Battle of Cape Sarych in late 1914. She covered several bombardments of the Bosphorus fortifications in early 1915, including one where the ship was attacked by the Ottoman battlecruiser &quot;Yavuz Sultan Selim&quot; – &quot;Panteleimon&quot; and the other Russian pre-dreadnoughts present drove her off before she could inflict any serious damage. The ship was relegated to secondary roles after Russia&#x27;s first dreadnought battleship entered service in late 1915. She was by then obsolete and was reduced to reserve in 1918 in Sevastopol.

&quot;Panteleimon&quot; was captured when the Germans took Sevastopol in May 1918 and was handed over to the Allies after the Armistice in November 1918. Her engines were destroyed by the British in 1919 when they withdrew from Sevastopol to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using them against the White Russians. The ship was abandoned when the Whites evacuated the Crimea in 1920 and was finally scrapped by the Soviets in 1923.

==Background and description==
Planning began in 1895 for a new battleship that would utilise a slipway slated to become available at the Nikolayev Admiralty Shipyard in 1896. The Naval Staff and the commander of the Black Sea Fleet, Vice Admiral K. P. Pilkin, agreed on a copy of the design, but they were over-ruled by General Admiral Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich. The General Admiral decided that the long range and less powerful guns of the &quot;Peresvet&quot; class were inappropriate for the narrow confines of the Black Sea, and ordered the design of an improved version of the battleship instead. The improvements included a higher forecastle to improve the ship&#x27;s seakeeping qualities, Krupp cemented armour and Belleville boilers. The design process was complicated by numerous changes demanded by various departments of the Naval Technical Committee. The ship&#x27;s design was finally approved on 12 June 1897, although design changes continued to be made that slowed the ship&#x27;s construction.

&quot;Potemkin&quot; was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a maximum draught of . The battleship displaced , more than her designed displacement of . The ship&#x27;s crew consisted of 26 officers and 705 enlisted men.

&quot;Potemkin&quot; had a pair of three-cylinder vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each of which drove one propeller, that had a total designed output of . Twenty-two Belleville boilers provided steam to the engines at a pressure of . The 8 boilers in the forward boiler room were oil-fired and the remaining 14 were coal-fired. During her sea trials on 31 October 1903, she reached a top speed of . Leaking oil caused a serious fire on 2 January 1904 that caused the navy to convert her boilers to coal firing at a cost of 20,000 rubles. The ship carried a maximum of of coal at full load that provided a range of at a speed of .

===Armament===

The battleship&#x27;s main battery consisted of four 40-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure. The electrically operated turrets were derived from the design of those used by the s. These guns had a maximum elevation of +15° and their rate of fire was very slow, only one round every four minutes during gunnery trials. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . At an elevation of +10° the guns had a range of . &quot;Potemkin&quot; carried 60 rounds for each gun.

The sixteen 45-calibre,  Canet Pattern 1891 quick-firing (QF) guns were mounted in casemates. Twelve of these were placed on the sides of the hull and the other four were positioned at the corners of the superstructure. They fired shells that weighed with a muzzle velocity of . They had a maximum range of when fired at an elevation of +20°. The ship stowed 160 rounds per gun.

Smaller guns were carried for close-range defence against torpedo boats. These included fourteen 50-calibre Canet QF  guns: four in hull embrasures and the remaining ten mounted on the superstructure. &quot;Potemkin&quot; carried 300 shells for each gun. They fired an shell at a muzzle velocity of to a maximum range of . She also mounted six Hotchkiss guns. Four of these were mounted in the fighting top and two on the superstructure. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of .

&quot;Potemkin&quot; had five underwater torpedo tubes: one in the bow and two on each broadside. She carried three torpedoes for each tube. The model of torpedo in use changed over time; the first torpedo that the ship would have been equipped with was the M1904. It had a warhead weight of and a speed of with a maximum range of .

In 1907, telescopic sights were fitted for the 12-inch and 6-inch guns. In that or the following year rangefinders were installed. The bow torpedo tube was removed in 1910–1911, as was the fighting top. The following year the main-gun turret machinery was upgraded and the guns were modified to improve their rate of fire to one round every 40 seconds.

Two anti-aircraft (AA) guns were mounted on &quot;Potemkin&quot;″s superstructure on 3–6 June 1915; they were supplemented by two 75 mm AA guns, one on top of each turret, probably during 1916. In February 1916, the ship&#x27;s four remaining torpedo tubes were removed. At some point during World War I, her 75 mm guns were also removed.

===Protection===
The maximum thickness of the Krupp cemented armour waterline belt was which reduced to abreast the magazines. It covered of the ship&#x27;s length and plates protected the waterline to the ends of the ship. The belt was high, of which was below the waterline, and tapered down to a thickness of at its bottom edge. The main part of the belt terminated in transverse bulkheads.

Above the belt was the upper strake of six-inch armour that was long and closed off by six-inch transverse bulkheads fore and aft. The upper casemate protected the six-inch guns and was five inches thick on all sides. The sides of the turrets were thick and they had a two-inch roof. The conning tower&#x27;s sides were nine inches thick. The nickel-steel armour deck was two inches thick on the flat amidships, but thick on the slope connecting it to the armour belt. Fore and aft of the armoured citadel, the deck was to the bow and stern. In 1910–1911, additional armour plates were added fore and aft; their exact location is unknown, but they were probably used to extend the height of the two-inch armour strake at the ends of the ship.

==Construction and career==
Construction of &quot;Potemkin&quot; began on 27 December 1897 and she was laid down at the Nikolayev Admiralty Shipyard on 10 October 1898. She was named in honour of Prince Grigory Potemkin, a Russian soldier and statesman. The ship was launched on 9 October 1900 and transferred to Sevastopol for fitting out on 4 July 1902. She began sea trials in September 1903 and these continued, off and on, until early 1905 when her gun turrets were completed.

=== Mutiny ===
During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, many of the Black Sea Fleet&#x27;s most experienced officers and enlisted men were transferred to the ships in the Pacific to replace losses. This left the fleet with primarily raw recruits and less capable officers. With the news of the disastrous Battle of Tsushima in May 1905, morale dropped to an all-time low, and any minor incident could be enough to spark a major catastrophe. Taking advantage of the situation, plus the disruption caused by the ongoing riots and uprisings, the Central Committee of the Social Democratic Organisation of the Black Sea Fleet, called &quot;Tsentralka&quot;, had started preparations for a simultaneous mutiny on all of the ships of the fleet, although the timing had not been decided.

On 27 June 1905, &quot;Potemkin&quot; was at gunnery practice near Tendra Spit off the Ukrainian coast when many enlisted men refused to eat the borscht made from rotten meat infested with maggots. Brought aboard the warship the previous day from shore suppliers, the carcasses had been passed as suitable for eating by the ship&#x27;s senior surgeon Dr Sergei Smirnov after several perfunctory examinations.

The uprising was triggered when Ippolit Giliarovsky, the ship&#x27;s second in command, allegedly threatened to shoot crew members for their refusal. He summoned the ship&#x27;s marine guards as well as a tarpaulin to protect the ship&#x27;s deck from any blood in an attempt to intimidate the crew. Giliarovsky was killed after he mortally wounded Grigory Vakulinchuk, one of the mutiny&#x27;s leaders. The mutineers killed seven of the &quot;Potemkin&quot;″s eighteen officers, including Captain Evgeny Golikov (ru), Executive Officer Giliarovsky and Surgeon Smirnov; and captured the accompanying torpedo boat (No. 267). They organised a ship&#x27;s committee of 25 sailors, led by Afanasi Matushenko, to run the battleship.

The committee decided to head for Odessa flying a red flag and arrived there later that day at 22:00. A general strike had been called in the city and there was some rioting as police tried to quell the strikers. The following day the mutineers refused to supply a landing party to help the striking revolutionaries take over the city, preferring instead to await the arrival of the other battleships of the Black Sea Fleet. Later that day the mutineers aboard &quot;Potemkin&quot; captured a military transport, &quot;Vekha&quot;, that had arrived in the city. The riots continued as much of the port area was destroyed by fire. On the afternoon of 29 June, Vakulinchuk&#x27;s funeral turned into a political demonstration and the army attempted to ambush the sailors who participated in the funeral. In retaliation, &quot;Potemkin&quot; fired two six-inch shells at the theatre where a high-level military meeting was scheduled to take place, but missed.

Vice Admiral Grigoriy Chukhnin, commander of the Black Sea Fleet, issued an order to send two squadrons to Odessa either to force &quot;Potemkin&quot;″s crew to give up or sink the battleship. &quot;Potemkin&quot; sortied on the morning of 30 June to meet the three battleships &quot;Tri Sviatitelia&quot;, , and of the first squadron, but the loyal ships turned away. The second squadron arrived with the battleships and later that morning, and Vice Admiral Aleksander Krieger, acting commander of the Black Sea Fleet, ordered the ships to proceed to Odessa. &quot;Potemkin&quot; sortied again and sailed through the combined squadrons as Krieger failed to order his ships to fire. Captain Kolands of &quot;Dvenadsat Apostolov&quot; attempted to ram &quot;Potemkin&quot; and then detonate his ship&#x27;s magazines, but he was thwarted by members of his crew. Krieger ordered his ships to fall back, but the crew of &quot;Georgii Pobedonosets&quot; mutinied and joined &quot;Potemkin&quot;.

The following morning, loyalist members of &quot;Georgii Pobedonosets&quot; retook control of the ship and ran her aground in Odessa harbour. The crew of &quot;Potemkin&quot;, together with &quot;Ismail&quot;, decided to sail for Constanța later that day where they could restock food, water and coal. The Romanians refused to provide the supplies, backed by the presence of their small protected cruiser &quot;Elisabeta&quot;, so the ship&#x27;s committee decided to sail for the small, barely defended port of Theodosia in the Crimea where they hoped to resupply. The ship arrived on the morning of 5 July, but the city&#x27;s governor refused to give them anything other than food. The mutineers attempted to seize several barges of coal the following morning, but the port&#x27;s garrison ambushed them and killed or captured 22 of the 30 sailors involved. They decided to return to Constanța that afternoon.
&quot;Potemkin&quot; reached its destination at 23:00 on 7 July and the Romanians agreed to give asylum to the crew if they would disarm themselves and surrender the battleship. &quot;Ismail&quot;″s crew decided the following morning to return to Sevastopol and turn themselves in, but &quot;Potemkin&quot;″s crew voted to accept the terms. Captain Nicolae Negru, commander of the port, came aboard at noon and hoisted the Romanian flag and then allowed the ship to enter the inner harbor. Before the crew disembarked, Matushenko ordered that &quot;Potemkin&quot;″s Kingston valves be opened so she would sink to the bottom.

===Later service===
When Rear Admiral Pisarevsky reached Constanța on the morning of 9 July, he found &quot;Potemkin&quot; half sunk in the harbour and flying the Romanian flag. After several hours of negotiations with the Romanian government, the battleship was handed over to the Russians. Later that day the Russian Navy Ensign was raised over the battleship. She was then easily refloated by the navy, but the salt water had damaged her engines and boilers. The ship left Constanța on 10 July, having to be towed back to Sevastopol, where she arrived on 14 July. The ship was renamed &quot;Panteleimon&quot; (), after Saint Pantaleon, on 12 October 1905. Some members of &quot;Panteleimon&quot;″s crew joined a mutiny that began aboard the protected cruiser &quot;Ochakov&quot; (ru) in November, but it was easily suppressed as both ships had been earlier disarmed.

&quot;Panteleimon&quot; received an experimental underwater communications set in February 1909. Later that year, she accidentally rammed and sank the submarine &quot;Kambala&quot; (ru) at night on 11 June [according to Russian sources, &quot;Kambala&quot; sank in a collision with &quot;Rostislav&quot;, not with &quot;Panteleimon&quot;, killing the 16 crewmen aboard the submarine].

While returning from a port visit to Constanța in 1911, &quot;Panteleimon&quot; ran aground on 2 October. It took several days to refloat her and make temporary repairs, and the full extent of the damage to its bottom was not fully realised for several more months. The ship participated in training and gunnery exercises for the rest of the year; a special watch was kept to ensure that no damaged seams were opened during firing. Permanent repairs, which involved replacing its boiler foundations, plating, and a large number of its hull frames, lasted from 10 January to 25 April 1912. The navy took advantage of these repairs to &quot;Panteleimon&quot;″s engines and boilers.

===World War I===
&quot;Panteleimon&quot;, flagship of the 1st Battleship Brigade, accompanied by the pre-dreadnoughts , , and &quot;Tri Sviatitelia&quot;, covered the pre-dreadnought &quot;Rostislav&quot; while she bombarded Trebizond on the morning of 17 November 1914. They were intercepted the following day by the Ottoman battlecruiser &quot;Yavuz Sultan Selim&quot; (the ex-German ) and the light cruiser &quot;Midilli&quot; (the ex-German ) on their return voyage to Sevastopol in what came to be known as the Battle of Cape Sarych. Despite the noon hour the conditions were foggy; the capital ships initially did not spot each other. Although several other ships opened fire, hitting the &quot;Yavuz Sultan Selim&quot; once, &quot;Panteleimon&quot; held her fire because her turrets could not see the Ottoman ships before they disengaged.

&quot;Tri Sviatitelia&quot; and &quot;Rostislav&quot; bombarded Ottoman fortifications at the mouth of the Bosphorus on 18 March 1915, the first of several attacks intended to divert troops and attention from the ongoing Gallipoli campaign, but fired only 105 rounds before sailing north to rejoin &quot;Panteleimon&quot;, &quot;Ioann Zlatoust&quot; and &quot;Evstafi&quot;. &quot;Tri Sviatitelia&quot; and &quot;Rostislav&quot; were intended to repeat the bombardment the following day, but were hindered by heavy fog. On 3 April, &quot;Yavuz Sultan Selim&quot; and several ships of the Ottoman navy raided the Russian port at Odessa; the Russian battleship squadron sortied to intercept them. The battleships pursued &quot;Yavuz Sultan Selim&quot; the entire day, but were unable to close to effective gunnery range and were forced to break off the chase. On 25 April &quot;Tri Sviatitelia&quot; and &quot;Rostislav&quot; repeated their bombardment of the Bosphorus forts. &quot;Tri Sviatitelia&quot;, &quot;Rostislav&quot; and &quot;Panteleimon&quot; bombarded the forts again on 2 and 3 May. This time a total of 337 main-gun rounds were fired in addition to 528 six-inch shells between the three battleships.

On 9 May 1915, &quot;Tri Sviatitelia&quot; and &quot;Panteleimon&quot; returned to bombard the Bosphorus forts, covered by the remaining pre-dreadnoughts. &quot;Yavuz Sultan Selim&quot; intercepted the three ships of the covering force, although no damage was inflicted by either side. &quot;Tri Sviatitelia&quot; and &quot;Panteleimon&quot; rejoined their consorts and the latter scored two hits on &quot;Yavuz Sultan Selim&quot; before it broke off the action. The Russian ships pursued it for six hours before giving up the chase. On 1 August, all of the Black Sea pre-dreadnoughts were transferred to the 2nd Battleship Brigade, after the more powerful dreadnought entered service. On 1 October the new dreadnought provided cover while &quot;Ioann Zlatoust&quot; and &quot;Pantelimon&quot; bombarded Zonguldak and &quot;Evstafi&quot; shelled the nearby town of Kozlu. The ship bombarded Varna twice in October 1915; during the second bombardment on 27 October, she entered Varna Bay and was unsuccessfully attacked by two German submarines stationed there.

&quot;Panteleimon&quot; supported Russian troops in early 1916 as they captured Trebizond and participated in an anti-shipping sweep off the north-western Anatolian coast in January 1917 that destroyed 39 Ottoman sailing ships. On 13 April 1917, after the February Revolution, the ship was renamed &quot;Potemkin-Tavricheskiy&quot; (), and then on 11 May was renamed &quot;Borets za svobodu&quot; ( – &quot;Freedom Fighter&quot;).

===Reserve and decommissioning===
&quot;Borets za Svobodu &quot; was placed in reserve in March 1918 and was captured by the Germans at Sevastopol in May. They handed the ship over to the Allies in December 1918 after the Armistice. The British wrecked her engines on 19 April 1919 when they left the Crimea to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using her against the White Russians. Thoroughly obsolete by this time, the battleship was captured by both sides during the Russian Civil War, but was abandoned by the White Russians when they evacuated the Crimea in November 1920. &quot;Borets za Svobodu&quot; was scrapped beginning in 1923, although she was not stricken from the Navy List until 21 November 1925.

==Legacy==

The immediate effects of the mutiny are difficult to assess. It may have influenced Tsar Nicholas II&#x27;s decisions to end the Russo-Japanese War and accept the October Manifesto, as the mutiny demonstrated that his régime no longer had the unquestioning loyalty of the military. The mutiny&#x27;s failure did not stop other revolutionaries from inciting insurrections later that year, including the Sevastopol Uprising. Vladimir Lenin, leader of the Bolshevik Party, called the 1905 Revolution, including the &quot;Potemkin&quot; mutiny, a &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; for his successful revolution in 1917. The communists seized upon it as a propaganda symbol for their party and unduly emphasised their role in the mutiny. In fact, Matushenko explicitly rejected the Bolsheviks because he and the other leaders of the mutiny were socialists of one type or another and cared nothing for communism.

The mutiny was memorialised most famously by Sergei Eisenstein in his 1925 silent film &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot;, although the French silent film &quot;La Révolution en Russie&quot; (&quot;Revolution in Russia&quot; or &quot;Revolution in Odessa&quot;, 1905), directed by Lucien Nonguet was the first film to depict the mutiny, preceding Eisenstein&#x27;s far more famous film by 20 years. Filmed shortly after the Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War of 1917–1922, with the derelict &quot;Dvenadsat Apostolov&quot; standing in for the broken-up &quot;Potemkin&quot;, Eisenstein recast the mutiny into a predecessor of the October Revolution of 1917 that swept the Bolsheviks to power. He emphasised their role, and implied that the mutiny failed because Matushenko and the other leaders were not better Bolsheviks. Eisenstein made other changes to dramatise the story, ignoring the major fire that swept through Odessa&#x27;s dock area while &quot;Potemkin&quot; was anchored there, combining the many different incidents of rioters and soldiers fighting into a famous sequence on the steps (today known as the Potemkin Stairs), and showing a tarpaulin thrown over the sailors to be executed.

In accordance with the Marxist doctrine that history is made by collective action, not individuals, Eisenstein forbore to single out any person in his film, but rather focused on the &quot;mass protagonist&quot;. Soviet film critics hailed this approach, including the dramaturge and critic, Adrian Piotrovsky, writing for the Leningrad newspaper &quot;Krasnaia gazeta&quot;: The hero is the sailors&#x27; battleship, the Odessa crowd, but characteristic figures are snatched here and there from the crowd. For a moment, like a conjuring trick, they attract all the sympathies of the audience: like the sailor Vakulinchuk, like the young woman and child on the Odessa Steps, but they emerge only to dissolve once more into the mass. This signifies: no film stars but a film of real-life types.

Similarly, theatre critic Alexei Gvozdev wrote in the journal &quot;Artistic Life&quot; (&quot;Zhizn ikusstva&quot;): &quot;In &quot;Potemkin&quot; there is no individual hero as there was in the old theatre. It is the mass that acts: the battleship and its sailors and the city and its population in revolutionary mood.&quot;

The last survivor of the mutiny was Ivan Beshoff, who died on 25 October 1987 at the age of 102 in Dublin, Ireland.

<doc id="1038535" wikidata="Q156020" url="?curid=1038535" title="State of the Teutonic Order">
<text>The State of the Teutonic Order () was a theocratic state located along the southeastern shore of the Baltic Sea in northern Europe. It was formed by the knights of the Teutonic Order during the early 13th century Northern Crusades in the region of Prussia. In 1237, the Livonian Brothers of the Sword merged with the Teutonic Order of Prussia and became known as its branch – the Livonian Order (while their state, &quot;Terra Mariana&quot;, covering present-day Estonia, Latvia, and a small part of Russia, became part of the State of the Teutonic Order). At its greatest territorial extent during the early 15th century, the State encompassed Chełmno Land, Courland, Gotland, Livonia, Estonia, Neumark, Pomerelia (Gdańsk Pomerania), Prussia and Samogitia.

Following the battles of Grunwald in 1410 and Wilkomierz in 1435, the State fell into decline. After losing extensive territories in the imposed Peace of Thorn in 1466, the extant territory of its Prussian branch became known as Monastic Prussia () or Teutonic Prussia () and existed until 1525 as a part and fiefdom of the Kingdom of Poland. The Livonian branch joined the Livonian Confederation and continued to exist as part of it until 1561.

== Overview ==
Established in Prussia and the Polish Masovian Chełmno Land in the 13th century, the state expanded mostly as a result of the 13th-century Prussian Crusade against the pagan Baltic Prussians and the 14th-century invasions of neighboring Christian countries of Poland and Lithuania. The conquests were followed by German and Polish colonization. In addition, the Livonian Brothers of the Sword controlling Terra Mariana were incorporated into the Teutonic Order as its autonomous branch, the Livonian Order in 1237. In 1346, the Duchy of Estonia was sold by the King of Denmark for 19,000 Cologne marks to the Teutonic Order. The shift of sovereignty from Denmark to the Teutonic Order took place on 1 November 1346. At the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, the Teutonic Order temporarily acquired the territories of Gotland and Neumark, which, however, it sold in the following decades.

Throughout its history, the Teutonic state waged numerous wars with Poland and Lithuania, encouraging the two countries to form a close alliance and personal union, which eventually led to the creation of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 16th century. Following its defeat in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 the Teutonic Order fell into decline, the region of Samogitia was restored to Lithuania.

The Prussian branch of the Teutonic Order returned Pomerelia (the previously Polish regions of Chełmno Land and Gdańsk Pomerania) and ceded the western part of Prussia (Warmia, as well as parts of Pomesania and Pogesania) to Poland after the Peace of Thorn in 1466. The territories ceded to the Kingdom of Poland formed the Polish province of Royal Prussia, while the eastern part remained under Teutonic Order rule, known thereafter as the Monastic Prussia () or Teutonic Prussia (), as a feudal fief and integral part of the Kingdom of Poland. The monastic state of the Order&#x27;s main (Prussian) branch was secularized in 1525 during the Protestant Reformation to become the Duchy of Prussia ruled by the House of Hohenzollern, remaining a fiefdom of the Polish Crown and later the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

The Livonian branch continued as part of the Livonian Confederation established in 1422–1435, which became a protectorate of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1559, and was finally secularised and split into the Duchy of Courland and Semigalia, as well as the Duchy of Livonia in 1561, both duchies being fiefs of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

== Background ==
===Poles in Old Prussia===
The Old Prussians had withstood many attempts at conquest preceding that of the Teutonic Knights. Bolesław I of Poland began the series of unsuccessful conquests when he sent Adalbert of Prague in 997. In 1147, Bolesław IV of Poland attacked Prussia with the aid of Kievan Rus&#x27; but was unable to conquer it. Numerous other attempts followed, and, under Duke Konrad I of Masovia, were intensified, with large battles and crusades in 1209, 1219, 1220 and 1222.
The West Baltic Prussians successfully repelled most of the campaigns and managed to strike Konrad in retaliation. However, the Prussians and the Yotvingians in the south had their territory conquered. The land of the Yotvingians was situated in the area of what is today the Podlaskie Voivodeship of Poland. The Prussians attempted to oust Polish or Masovian forces from Yotvingia, which by now was partially conquered, devastated and almost totally depopulated.

===Papal edicts===
Konrad of Masovia had already called a crusade against the Old Prussians in 1208, but it was not successful. Konrad, acting on the advice of Christian, first bishop of Prussia, established the Order of Dobrzyń, a small group of 15 knights. The Order, however, was soon defeated and, in reaction, Konrad called on the Pope for yet another crusade and for help from the Teutonic Knights. As a result, several edicts called for crusades against the Old Prussians. The crusades, involving many of Europe&#x27;s knights, lasted for sixty years.

In 1211, Andrew II of Hungary enfeoffed the Teutonic Knights with the Burzenland. In 1225, Andrew II expelled the Teutonic Knights from Transylvania, and they had to transfer to the Baltic Sea.

Early in 1224, Emperor Frederick II announced at Catania that Livonia, Prussia with Sambia, and a number of neighboring provinces were under imperial immediacy. This decree subordinated the provinces directly to the Roman Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Emperor as opposed to being under the jurisdiction of local rulers.

At the end of 1224, Pope Honorius III announced to all Christendom his appointment of Bishop William of Modena as the Papal Legate for Livonia, Prussia, and other countries.

As a result of the Golden Bull of Rimini in 1226 and the Papal Bull of Rieti of 1234, Prussia came into the Teutonic Order&#x27;s possession. The Knights began the Prussian Crusade in 1230. Under their governance, woodlands were cleared and marshlands made arable, upon which many cities and villages were founded, including Marienburg (Malbork) and Königsberg (Kaliningrad).

===Cities founded===
Unlike the newly-founded cities between the Rivers Elbe and Oder, the cities founded by the Teutonic Order had a much more regular, rectangular sketch of streets, indicating their character as planned foundations. The cities were heavily fortified, accounting for the long lasting conflicts with the resistive native Old Prussians, with armed forces under command of the knights. Most cities were prevailingly populated with immigrants from Central Germany and Silesia, where many knights of the order had their homelands.

The cities were usually given Magdeburg law town privileges, with the one exception of Elbing (Elbląg), which was founded with the support of Lübeckers and thus was awarded Lübeck law. While the Lübeckers provided the Order important logistic support with their ships, they were otherwise, with the exception of Elbing, rather uninvolved in the establishment of the Monastic State.

==History==
===13th century===
In 1234, the Teutonic Order assimilated the remaining members of the Order of Dobrzyń and, in 1237, the Order of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword. The assimilation of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword (established in Livonia in 1202) increased the Teutonic Order&#x27;s lands with the addition of the territories known today as Latvia and Estonia.

In 1243, the Papal legate William of Modena divided Prussia into four bishoprics: Culm (Chełmno), Pomesania, Ermland (Warmia) and Samland (Sambia). The bishoprics became suffragans to the Archbishopric of Riga under the mother city of Visby on Gotland. Each diocese was fiscally and administratively divided into one-third reserved for the maintenance of the capitular canons, and two-thirds were where the Order collected the dues. The cathedral capitular canons of Culm, Pomesania and Samland were simultaneously members of the Teutonic Order since the 1280s, ensuring a strong influence by the Order. Only Warmia&#x27;s diocesan chapter maintained independence, enabling to establish its autonomous rule in the capitular third of Warmia&#x27;s diocesan territory (Prince-Bishopric of Warmia).
===14th century===
====Danzig and the Hansa====
At the beginning of the 14th century, the Duchy of Pomerania, a neighboring region, plunged into war with Poland and the Margraviate of Brandenburg to the west. The Teutonic Knights seized the Polish port city of Gdańsk in November 1308. The Order had been called by King Władysław I of Poland to help repel a Brandenburgian invasion; however, the Teutonic Knights themselves began to occupy the city and the region. The Teutonic Knights then carried out a massacre of the inhabitants of the city, killing up to 10,000 people according to medieval sources, although the exact number of victims is a subject of disputes. In September 1309, Margrave Waldemar of Brandenburg-Stendal sold his claim to the territory to the Teutonic Order for the sum of 10,000 Marks in the Treaty of Soldin. This marked the beginning of a series of conflicts between Poland and the Teutonic Knights as the Order continued incorporating territories into its domains.
While the Order promoted the Prussian cities by granting them extended surrounding territory and privileges, establishing courts, civil and commercial law, it allowed the cities less outward independence than free imperial cities enjoyed within the Holy Roman Empire.

The members of the Hanseatic League did consider merchants from Prussian cities as their like, but also accepted the &quot;Grand Master&quot; of the Order as the sole territorial ruler representing Prussia at their Hanseatic Diets. Thus Prussian merchants, along with those from Ditmarsh, were the only beneficiaries of a quasi membership within the Hansa, although lacking the background of citizenship in a fully autonomous or free city. Only merchants from the six Prussian Hanseatic cities of Braunsberg (Braniewo), Culm (Chełmno), Danzig (Gdańsk), Elbing (Elbląg), Königsberg and Thorn (Toruń) were considered fully fledged members of the league, while merchants from other Prussian cities had a lesser status.
The Teutonic Order&#x27;s annexation and possession of Gdańsk (Danzig) and the surrounding region was consistently disputed by the Polish kings Władysław I and Casimir III the Great – claims that led to the Polish–Teutonic War (1326–1332) and, eventually, lawsuits in the papal court in 1320 and 1333, which ruled in favor of Poland, however, the Teutonic Knights did not comply and continued to occupy the annexed Polish territories. The Teutonic Knights even invaded Poland further and briefly occupied the regions of Kuyavia and Dobrzyń Land. A peace was concluded at Kalisz in 1343, Kuyavia and Dobrzyń Land were restored to Poland, and the Teutonic Order agreed that Poland should rule Pomerelia as a fief and Polish kings, therefore, retained the right to the title &quot;Duke of Pomerania&quot;. The title referred to the Duchy of Pomerelia. Unlike in English, German, Latin or Lithuanian language Polish uses the term &quot;Pomorze&quot; for Pomerania (a fief of Poland, Saxony and Denmark in the High Middle Ages, and first briefly in 1181, but since 1227 a permanent fief within the Holy Roman Empire) and Pomerelia alike. Both duchies were earlier ruled by related dynasties, thus the semantic title was Duke of Pomerania rather than Duke of Pomerelia, as it was referred to in other languages.

====Second Danish-Hanseatic War====
In the conflict between the Hanse and Denmark on the trade in the Baltic, King Valdemar IV of Denmark had held the Hanseatic city of Visby to ransom in 1361. However, the members of the Hanseatic league were undecided whether to unite against him. But when Valdemar IV then captured Prussian merchant ships in the Øresund on their way to England, Grand Master Winrich of Kniprode travelled to Lübeck to propose a war alliance against Denmark, accepted with some reluctance only by the important cities forming the Wendish-Saxon third of the Hanse.

Since Valdemar IV had also attacked ships of the Dutch city of Kampen and other destinations in the Zuiderzee, Prussia and Dutch cities, such as Kampen, Elburg and Harderwijk, allied themselves against Denmark. This resulted in the Hansa calling up a diet in Cologne in 1367 and convening the afore-mentioned non-member cities including Amsterdam and Brielle. The upshot was the founding of the Cologne Federation as a war alliance to counter the Danish threat. More cities, from the Lower Rhine area in the west to Livonia in the east, joined.

Of the major players only Bremen and Hamburg refused to send forces, but contributed financially. Besides Prussia, three more territorial partners, Henry II of Schauenburg and Holstein-Rendsburg, Albert II of Mecklenburg, and the latter&#x27;s son Albert of Sweden, joined the alliance, attacking via land and sea, forcing Denmark to sign the Treaty of Stralsund in 1370. Several Danish castles and fortresses were then taken by Hansa forces for fifteen years in order to secure the implementation of the peace conditions.

====English Merchant Adventurers====
The invasions of the Teutonic Order from Livonia to Pskov in 1367 had caused the Russians to recoup themselves on Hansa merchants in Novgorod, which again made the Order block exports of salt and herring into Russia. While the relations had eased by 1371 so that trade resumed, they soured again until 1388.

During the Lithuanian Crusade of 1369/1370, ending with the Teutonic victory in the Battle of Rudau, Prussia enjoyed considerable support from English knights. The Order welcomed English Merchant Adventurers, starting to cruise in the Baltic, competing with Dutch, Saxon and Wendish Hanseatic merchants, and allowed them to open outposts in its cities of Danzig and Elbing. This necessarily brought about a conflict with the rest of the Hansa, which was in a heavy argument with Richard II of England, over levies of higher dues. The Merchants struggled to achieve an unsatisfactory compromise.

Dissatisfied Richard II&#x27;s navy suddenly attacked six Prussian ships in May 1385 – and those of more Hanse members – in the Zwin, Grand Master Conrad Zöllner von Rothenstein immediately terminated all trade with England. When in the same year the Hansa evacuated all their Danish castles in fulfillment of the Treaty of Stralsund, Prussia argued in favour of a renewal of the Cologne Federation for the deeply concerned about the ensuing conflict with England, but could not prevail.

The cities preferred to negotiate and take retaliatory actions, such as counter-confiscation of English merchandise. So when in 1388 Richard II finally reconfirmed the Hanseatic trade privileges, Prussia once again permitted merchant adventurers, granting permissions to remain; for this action they were renounced once again by the Grand Master Conrad of Jungingen in 1398.

In the conflict with the Burgundian Philip the Bold on the Hansa privileges in the Flemish cities the positions of the Hanseatic cities and Prussia were again reversed. Here the majority of the Hansa members decided in the Hanseatic Diet on 1 May 1388 for an embargo against the Flemish cities. Meanwhile, Prussia could not prevail with its plea for further negotiations.

====Trading====
The Order&#x27;s &quot;Großschäffer&quot; was one of the leading functionaries of the order. The word translates roughly as &quot;chief sales and buying officer&quot; with procuration. This officer was in charge of the considerable commerce, import, export, crediting, real estate investment etc., which the Order carried out, using its network of bailiwicks and agencies which spanned much of Central, Western and Southern Europe as well as the Holy Land. The other Großschäffer in Marienburg had the grain export monopoly. As to imports, neither was bound to any particular merchandise. From Königsberg, holding the monopoly in amber export, achieved the exceptional permission to continue amber exports to Flanders and textile imports in return. On the occasion of the ban on Flemish trade, the Hansa urged Prussia and Livonia again to interrupt the exchange with Novgorod as well, but with both blockades Russian and Flemish commodities could not reach their final destinations. In 1392 it was Grand Master Conrad of Wallenrode who supported the Flemish to achieve an acceptable agreement with the Hansa resuming the bilateral trade; while a Hanseatic delegation under Johann Niebur reopened trade with Novgorod in the same year, after reconfirmation of the previous mutual privileges.

Since the late 1380s grave piracy by privateers, promoted by Albert of Sweden and Mecklenburg actually directed against Margaret I of Denmark, blocked seafaring to the herring supplies at the Scania Market; thus fish prices tripled in Prussia. The Saxon Hansa cities urged Prussia to intervene, but Conrad of Jungingen was more worried about a Danish victory. So only after the cities, led by Lübeck&#x27;s burgomaster Hinrich Westhof, had liaised the Treaty of Skanör (1395), Albert&#x27;s defeat manifested, so that Prussia finally sent out its ships, led by Danzig&#x27;s city councillor Conrad Letzkau.&lt;ref name=&quot;Borzestowska / Borzestowski 2005&quot;&gt;Natalia Borzestowska and Waldemar Borzestowski, &quot;Dlaczego zginął burmistrz&quot;, 17 October 2005, retrieved on 8 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1400 the united Teutonic-Hanseatic flotilla then thoroughly cleared the Baltic Sea of pirates, the Victual Brothers, and even took the island of Gotland in 1398.

===15th century===
====Konrad von Jungingen====
At the beginning of the 15th century, the State of the Teutonic Order stood at the height of its power under Konrad (Conrad) von Jungingen. The Teutonic navy ruled the Baltic Sea from bases in Prussia and Gotland, and the Prussian cities provided tax revenues sufficient to maintain a significant standing force composed of Teutonic Knights proper, their retinues, Prussian peasant levies, and German mercenaries.

In 1402, the Luxembourg dynasty, which ruled the Margraviate of Brandenburg, reached an agreement with Poland in Kraków, according to which Poland was to purchase and re-incorporate the region of New March (Neumark). Later that year, however, the Luxembourgs gave the region in pawn to the Teutonic Order despite prior arrangements with Poland, and the Order kept it until Brandenburg redeemed it again in 1454 and 1455, respectively, by the Treaties of Cölln and Mewe. Though the possession of this territory by the Order strengthened ties between the Order and their secular counterparts in northern Germany, it exacerbated the already hostile relationship between the Order and Polish–Lithuanian union.

In March 1407, Konrad died from complications caused by gallstones and was succeeded by his younger brother, Ulrich von Jungingen. Under Ulrich, the Teutonic State fell from its precarious height and became mired in internal political strife, near-constant war with Polish–Lithuanian union, and crippling war debts.

====Losses to Poland, Polish suzerainty====

In 1408, Conrad Letzkau served as a diplomat to Queen Margaret I and arranged that the Order sell Gotland to Denmark. In 1409, the Teutonic Order invaded Poland&#x27;s Dobrzyń Land again, and the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War broke out, in which the Teutonic Knights were supported by the Duchy of Pomerania, and the Polish-Lithuanian alliance was supported by Ruthenian, Tatar and Moldavian allies and auxiliary forces. Poland and Lithuania triumphed following a victory at the Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg), which marked the start of the decline of the State of the Teutonic Order, and the rise of the Polish–Lithuanian union as a major power in Central and Eastern Europe.

The Order assigned Heinrich von Plauen to defend Teutonic-held Eastern Pomerania (Pomerelia), who moved rapidly to bolster the defence of Marienburg Castle in Pomesania. Heinrich von Plauen was elected vice-grand master and led the Teutonic Knights through the Siege of Marienburg in 1410. Eventually von Plauen was promoted to Grand Master and, in 1411, concluded the First Treaty of Thorn with King Władysław II Jagiełło of Poland.

The next major Polish–Teutonic war was fought in 1431–1435, after the Teutonic Knights invaded Poland again, and was ended in the Peace of Brześć Kujawski, which was favorable for Poland.

In March 1440, gentry (mainly from Culmerland) and the Hanseatic cities of Danzig, Elbing, Kneiphof, Thorn and other Prussian cities founded the Prussian Confederation to free themselves from the overlordship of the Teutonic Knights. Due to the heavy losses and costs after the war against Poland and Lithuania, the Teutonic Order collected taxes at steep rates. Furthermore, the cities were not allowed due representation by the Teutonic Order.
In February 1454, the Prussian Confederation asked King Casimir IV of Poland to support their revolt and to incorporate the region to the Kingdom of Poland. King Casimir IV agreed and signed the act of incorporation in Kraków on 6 March 1454. The Thirteen Years&#x27; War, the longest of the Polish–Teutonic wars, (also known as the &quot;War of the Cities&quot;) broke out. Various cities of the region pledged allegiance to the Polish King in 1454.

The Second Peace of Thorn in October 1466 ended the war and provided for the Teutonic Order&#x27;s cession of its rights over the western half of its territories to the Polish Kingdom, which became the Polish province of Royal Prussia and the remaining part of the Order&#x27;s land became a fief and protectorate of Poland, considered part of one and indivisible Kingdom of Poland. In accordance to the peace treaty, from now on, every Grand Master was obliged to swear an oath of allegiance to the reigning Polish king within six months of taking office, and any new territorial acquisitions by the Teutonic Order, also outside Prussia, would also be incorporated into Poland. The Grand Master of the Teutonic Order became a prince and counselor of the Polish king and the Kingdom of Poland.

====Formation of a new nobility====
While the Knights of the Teutonic Order formed a thin ruling class by themselves, they extensively used mercenaries, mostly German, from the Holy Roman Empire, to whom they granted lands in return. This gradually created a new class of landed nobility. Due to several factors, among which was the high rate of early death in battle, these lands became concentrated over time in the hands of a relatively small number of noblemen each having a vast estate. This nobility would evolve to what is known as the Prussian Junker nobility.

===16th century and aftermath===
====Transformation to Ducal Prussia====
During the Protestant Reformation, endemic religious upheavals and wars occurred across the region. In 1525, during the aftermath of the Polish-Teutonic War (1519–1521), Sigismund I the Old, King of Poland, and his nephew, the last Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Albert of Brandenburg-Ansbach, a member of a cadet branch of the House of Hohenzollern, agreed that the latter would resign his position, adopt Lutheran faith and assume the title of Duke of Prussia. Thereafter referred to as &quot;Ducal Prussia&quot; (; ), remaining a Polish fief.
Thus in a deal partially brokered by Martin Luther, Roman Catholic Teutonic Prussia was transformed into the Duchy of Prussia, the first Protestant state. Sigismund&#x27;s consent was bound to Albert&#x27;s submission to Poland, which became known as the Prussian Homage. On 10 December 1525 at their session in Königsberg the Prussian estates established the Lutheran Church in Ducal Prussia by deciding the Church Order.

The Habsburg-led Holy Roman Empire continued to hold its claim to Prussia and furnished grand masters of the Teutonic Order, who were merely titular administrators of Prussia, but managed to retain many of the Teutonic holdings elsewhere outside of Prussia.

==Archaeology==
Fortifications of the Teutonic State have been examined through archaeological excavation since the end of World War II, especially those built or expanded during the 14th century. Fortifications are generally the best preserved material legacy of the Order&#x27;s presence in the Baltic today, and timber and earth, as well as brick examples, are attested in the archaeological record.

The earliest castles in the Teutonic State consisted of simple buildings attached to a fortified enclosure, and the quadrangular red-brick structure would come to typify convent buildings, single-wing castles would continue to be built alongside timber towers. Where they followed the conventional layout, castles included a connected set of communal spaces such as a dormitory, refectory, kitchen, chapter house, a chapel or church, an infirmary, and tower projecting over the moat.

===Marienburg fort===
Construction began on Marienburg during the third quarter of the 13th century, and work continued on it until the mid-15th century. A settlement developed alongside the castle, which together enclosed 25 hectares. Granted town rights in 1286, its castle is larger than any other built by the Order. Since 1997, the outer bailey has been thoroughly excavated and dates to the mid-1350s. Preserved at Marienburg was a polychrome statue of Mary about 8 m high, made of artificial stone and originally decorated with mosaic tiles. Sinc Mary was the most important patron of the knights and central to the liturgy of the Teutonic Order, it is not surprising to find such striking representations of her at its most prominent castle.

===Coins===
Coins were minted from the late 1250s. They were often simple in design, stamped with the cross of the Order on one side, but support the notion that crusading, colonisation, and a supporting infrastructure went hand in hand from the earliest years of the Prussian Crusade.

<text>Kyle Hunter Martino (born February 19, 1981) is an American former professional soccer player who spent seven seasons with the Columbus Crew and Los Angeles Galaxy in Major League Soccer as a midfielder. He is currently a television soccer analyst and host.

==Career==

===High school===
Martino attended Staples High School in Westport, Connecticut, where he played soccer and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year in 1998 after his senior season.

===College===
Martino attended the University of Virginia from 1999 to 2001. He played college soccer and scored 17 goals and provided 21 assists. In his junior season, Martino was named ACC Player of the Year. In both his sophomore and junior seasons, he was one of 15 finalists for the Hermann Trophy.

===Professional===
Martino left UVA after his junior season, signing a Project-40 contract with Major League Soccer (MLS) and entering the 2002 MLS Superdraft, where the Columbus Crew selected him eighth overall. He tallied two goals and five assists in 22 appearances and won the MLS Rookie of the Year Award, while running the Crew offense for much of the season. His following season was something of a disappointment, as Martino failed to develop into the dominant offensive force that many had expected, although he maintained a spot in the Crew&#x27;s starting lineup. His third season began like the second with Martino failing to stimulate the offense, but a move up to withdrawn forward saw a resurgence of his offensive abilities, and through the 2004 season he led the Crew to the longest unbeaten streak in MLS history. Martino had a down year in 2005, not scoring a goal and in early 2006 he was dealt to the LA Galaxy in a four-player deal. He and John Wolyniec were traded for Joseph Ngwenya and Ned Grabavoy. During the first 2006 match between the Crew and the Galaxy, before the trade, it was Martino who, in the last few seconds, scored the game&#x27;s only goal, delivering a defeat to his soon-to-be teammates.

In November 2006, Martino had a trial at Dutch Eredivisie side NEC Nijmegen, but did not earn a contract. Martino also had a trial at Leeds United.

Martino retired from professional soccer on February 19, 2008, having been advised by doctors that injuries he sustained throughout his career were severe enough that it would be in his best interest to retire.

===International===
Martino played for the United States at the 2001 World Youth Championship in Argentina. He saw little playing time for the senior national team, getting his first cap on November 17, 2002, against El Salvador. He scored his only international goal against Panama on October 12, 2005, in a 2-0 World Cup qualifier U.S. victory.

==International goals==
==Post-playing career==
Until the beginning of the 2020/21 season, Martino was a studio analyst and color commentator for NBC Sports coverage of the English Premier League. He was previously a color commentator for MLS on the ESPN family of networks. In addition to commentating, he is also a television host featured on Travel Channel&#x27;s &quot;36 Hours&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Spartan Race&quot;.

On November 6, 2017, Martino announced he was leaving NBC Sports temporarily to stand as a candidate for president of the United States Soccer Federation in the February 2018 election. His campaign was unsuccessful.

==Honors==

*Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup: 2002

<doc id="1038542" wikidata="Q7285244" url="?curid=1038542" title="Raj Bhakta">
<text>Raj Peter Bhakta (born 1975) is an American entrepreneur, spirits industry executive, real estate investor and former media and political personality. In 2004, Bhakta was a contestant on the second season of the reality show &quot;The Apprentice&quot;. He is also the founder of WhistlePig whiskey, a premium whiskey company. In 2006, he campaigned for a seat in the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania&#x27;s 13th district as a Republican, but lost to incumbent Democrat Allyson Schwartz.

==Early life and education==
Born to a Gujarati, Indian father from nansad near Surat, Gujarat, and an Irish mother, Bhakta moved from Oxford Circle, Philadelphia to Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, where he grew up. After graduating from The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, Bhakta earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Boston College in Economics and History with a concentration in Finance in 1998.

==Career==

=== Business ===
Bhakta began his career working at the investment banking firm of Violy &amp; Co. in New York City. Bhakta then founded Automovia, a technology startup specializing in the valuation of pre-owned vehicles. Thereafter, he led the Apex Vail condominium development project in Vail, Colorado.

=== &quot;The Apprentice&quot; ===
In the fall of 2004, Bhakta appeared on the second season of the business reality television show, &quot;The Apprentice&quot;. On the show, Bhakta propositioned Anna Kournikova and Donald Trump&#x27;s assistant to go out with him on dates, and was fired by Trump on the ninth week of the show. His relationships with women became fodder for gossip columns such as &quot;New York Post&quot;&#x27;s Page Six, and his frequent wearing of bow ties was credited with a surge in bow tie sales.

=== Political engagement and commentary ===
After appearing on &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, Bhakta advocated Social Security reform in meetings with Congressional leadership. Bhakta was also a guest on MSNBC and Fox News and appeared on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Crossfire&quot;.

=== 2006 Congressional campaign ===
With the support of Thomas J. Ellis, the Republican chairman of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners, he sought and won the Republican nomination for the 13th congressional district. In the general election, Bhakta lost to incumbent Democrat Allyson Schwartz by more than 30 points. Bhakta&#x27;s campaign generated significant national media attention as a consequence of Bhakta&#x27;s background on &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, his attention-getting campaign maneuvers, and his reputation as a playboy.

During the campaign, Bhakta&#x27;s judgment and fitness to lead were called into question as a result of his having been arrested twice, in 1997 and 2004, for drunk driving. After reports of the arrests surfaced during the campaign, Bhakta said &quot;I ask for the forgiveness and understanding of the voters, while giving them my solemn pledge that this behavior will not happen again&quot;, and said &quot;Politicians today need to come clean&quot;.

On October 10, 2006, Bhakta illustrated the ease of crossing the United States-Mexico border by riding an elephant along the border for ninety minutes, accompanied by a six-man mariachi band. Neither Bhakta nor the mariachi band broke the law by crossing the border, as they remained on private property along the Rio Grande in Texas. Bhakta said that he got the idea by seeing a Mexican man illegally cross the border by wading across the Rio Grande. Bhakta had a camera to record the man&#x27;s illegal crossing, and succeeded in getting the man detained by border authorities. The demonstration garnered national attention for Bhakta&#x27;s campaign. Bhakta was interviewed by Bill O&#x27;Reilly, Rita Cosby, Glenn Beck, and John Gibson. &quot;This is not about the poor Mexican immigrant who wants to come for a better life that&#x27;s the real problem here,&quot; Bhakta said. He added, &quot;The border security is a joke and this is a creative and very effective way of showing it.&quot;

On November 7, 2006, the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; reported that Bhakta&#x27;s campaign made &quot;stunning&quot; automated campaign calls to homes in Northeast Philadelphia and Montgomery County detailing the charges in 18 lawsuits against an abortion clinic founded by Schwartz.

==WhistlePig Whiskey==
Bhakta founded the WhistlePig brand of rye whiskey, which was initially launched as a non-distiller producer that bottled Canadian whiskey from the Alberta Premium distillery owned by Fortune Brands in Alberta, Canada. Starting in 2007, he purchased land in Vermont, on which he built a new distillery and aging facility for the brand. The brand was officially launched in 2010.

Bhakta was forced out of the WhistlePig. He sold his shares and fully exited the company in 2019.

== Bhakta Spirits ==
After leaving WhistlePig, Bhakta launched his new enterprise Bhakta Spirits in Shoreham, Vermont. In 2019, Bhakta negotiated purchase of a rare stock of aged Armagnac brandies while on vacation in Gers, France. With vintages dating from 1868 to 1970, these spirits were the basis for his new enterprise, Bhakta Spirits. After acquiring the brandy stocks, along with the Condom, Gers chateau where they were found, Bhakta brought them back to Vermont for blending and marketing. His flagship brandy, BHAKTA 50, launched in July 2020.

In 2019, Bhakta purchased the Whiteface Ranch in Indian River County, Florida for $5.9 million and began rum distilling operation on the site. 

== Purchase of Green Mountain College Campus ==
In August 2020, Bhakta purchased at auction the campus of Green Mountain College in Poultney, Vermont.

== Personal life ==
Bhakta met Danhee Kim, a Columbia University grad in 2010, while she was hired as his executive assistant. Kim later worked as a marketing and sales director for Bhakta&#x27;s WhistlePig whiskey company. The couple married in 2013 and lived in Vermont. The couple moved to Vero Beach, Florida in 2017.

<text>Berthelot&#x27;s pipit (Anthus berthelotii) is a small passerine bird which breeds in Madeira and the Canary Islands. It is a common resident in both archipelagos.
Berthelot&#x27;s pipit is found in open country. The nest is on the ground, with 3-5 eggs being laid.

This is a small pipit, in length. It is an undistinguished looking species on the ground, mainly grey above and whitish below, with some breast streaking. It has a whitish supercilium and eyering, with dark eye and moustachial stripes. The sexes are similar, but juveniles are browner than adults.

This species appears shorter tailed and larger headed than meadow pipit. Its call is a &quot;schrip&quot; like yellow wagtail, and the song, given in flight, is a chattery &quot;tsivrr tsivrr tsivrr tsivrr&quot;.

This species is named after the French naturalist Sabin Berthelot, one-time resident of the Canary Islands, by Carl Bolle.

<text>Albert Watson Newton (23 July 1938 – 30 October 2021) was an Australian media personality. He was a Logie Hall of Fame inductee, quadruple Gold Logie–winning entertainer, and radio, theatre, and television personality and compère.
Newton was known for his collaborations opposite Graham Kennedy and subsequently Don Lane on their respective variety shows, and appearances with his wife, singer Patti Newton.

Newton started his career in radio broadcasting, primarily as an announcer, before becoming a star and fixture of Australian television since its inception in 1956, and was considered both an industry pioneer icon and one of the longest-serving television performers in the world.

Newton was known for his association with both the Nine Network and Ten Network on numerous variety shows, including &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot;, &quot;New Faces&quot;, &quot;Good Morning Australia&quot;, &quot;20 to 1&quot;, and game show &quot;Bert&#x27;s Family Feud&quot;.

==Early life==
Newton was born in Fitzroy, an inner suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, to Joseph (Joe) and Gladys Newton. He had three brothers (Tom, Jack, and Bob) and two sisters (Alice and Elizabeth). He was educated at St Joseph&#x27;s Marist Brothers Roman Catholic college. In his early years, he had thoughts of entering the priesthood and remained an active Roman Catholic.

==Radio==
Newton&#x27;s first paid radio appearance was as a schoolboy on Melbourne radio station 3XY on 10 June 1952, doing advertisements dressed as a clown with Doug McKenzie, who later became Zag in Zig and Zag.
 This led to regular appearances on a Saturday morning children&#x27;s show, in which he worked with disc jockey Stan Rofe and McKenzie.

In May 1954, 3XY employed him as a junior announcer (aged 15); by 1955, he was presenting &quot;Melbourne Speaks&quot;, a vox pop program recorded on the streets of Melbourne&#x27;s CBD. After GTV-9 purchased 3AK in April 1961, all GTV-9 personalities were expected to present programs on 3AK. Graham Kennedy and Newton hosted a two-hour morning program. He began a morning program on 3UZ in 1976. The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd appointed Newton as general manager of 3DB in 1986, which he combined with on-air appearances until 1988.

==Television==
===Early television career===
Newton began his television career in 1957 at Melbourne&#x27;s HSV-7, hosting &quot;The Late Show&quot;. Newton left for GTV-9 in early 1959 to host &quot;In Melbourne Today&quot;. After appearing in a live commercial on &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot; with his friend Graham Kennedy in 1959, he began to make regular appearances on the show and assumed hosting duties on some episodes. This began a lifelong association with Kennedy.

From 1959 to 1960, he hosted &quot;The Bert Newton Show&quot; (later retitled &quot;Hi-Fi Club&quot;) on GTV-9, a series aimed at teenagers.

From 1960 to 1961, Newton appeared in the national &quot;Graham Kennedy&#x27;s Channel 9 Show&quot; (a weekly national version of &quot;IMT&quot;). In January 1962, the show was cancelled and replaced by the similar &quot;The Channel 9 Show&quot;, hosted by Newton.

===1975–92===
From 1975 to mid-1992 Newton mainly appeared on the Nine Network.

In 1975 Newton was cast in the role of sidekick and &quot;barrel boy&quot; on &quot;The Don Lane Show&quot;. He was dubbed &quot;Moonface&quot;, and the nickname stuck. Newton frequently appeared in outlandish costumes, often sending up celebrities. Newton memorably sent-up Demis Roussos, who was sent on set while Newton was doing the impersonation. Newton remained on the show until it ended in 1983. 

Newton briefly hosted his own program, &quot;The Bert Newton Show&quot;, recorded for the ABC. It was not a success, and he returned to working with Kennedy. 

In 1976, Newton replaced long-running compere Frank Wilson on Nine&#x27;s amateur talent program &quot;New Faces&quot;. The show was a success, and lasted until 1985. In 1992, Newton hosted another version of &quot;New Faces&quot;; however, it did not last for long.

In 1981, Newton (and wife Patti) presented a quiz show, &quot;Ford Superquiz&quot;, produced by the Reg Grundy organisation for the Nine Network. 

&quot;Tonight with Bert Newton&quot; was a short-lived attempt to bring back the spirit of IMT. It aired in 1984. &quot;The Bert Newton Show&quot; was created for the Seven Network in 1989 as an attempt to woo some of the audience away from &quot;The Midday Show&quot; with Ray Martin. This, however, didn&#x27;t rate well and was only on air for that year.

===1992–2005===
In 1992, Newton moved into daytime TV as host of &quot;The Morning Show&quot;, which was soon renamed &quot;Good Morning Australia&quot; (&quot;GMA&quot;) on Network Ten. The show revived Newton&#x27;s celebrity status and was a continuing success for Ten. &quot;GMA&quot; was a mix of interviews, music, cooking segments and infomercials. It was broadcast live-to-air on Mondays and Tuesdays, but for the rest of the week live-to-tape (recorded complete and aired later). &quot;GMA&quot; was cancelled in late 2005 after a 14-year run. Although Newton was offered ongoing employment at Network Ten, he stated that he would return to the Nine Network in 2006.

===2006–12===
After finishing on &quot;GMA&quot;. Newton returned to the Nine Network hosting &quot;Bert&#x27;s Family Feud&quot;, a revised version of &quot;Family Feud&quot;, from 2006 and until it was cancelled in May 2007.

From 2006 to 2011, Newton hosted &quot;20 to 1&quot; taking over from Bud Tingwell. In 2007, Newton hosted the retrospective program &quot;What a Year&quot; with comedian Julia Zemiro, replacing previous hosts Mike Munro and Megan Gale, which took a light-hearted look at significant events from a chosen year in history.

In 2008 Newton appeared as a celebrity contestant on &quot;Million Dollar Wheel of Fortune&quot; alongside Livinia Nixon and Dawn Fraser. He won the main game, with $3,235 (including a plasma TV) going to his chosen charity, the International Diabetes Institute. On 14 August 2012, Newton appeared as a celebrity contestant on &quot;Millionaire Hot Seat&quot; and won $5,000 for the charity Sids &amp; Kids.

Newton reputedly received a yearly salary of A$800,000 from Nine during this era.

==Theatre==
Newton&#x27;s stage appearances included Professor Marvel/the Wizard of Oz in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, Cogsworth in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, Franz Liebkind in &quot;The Producers&quot; and Max in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

From November 2008, Newton took over the role of The Wizard in the Melbourne production of the musical &quot;Wicked&quot;, after the sudden death of Rob Guest. The production transferred to Sydney from September 2009. Newton continued to play the role on the national tour, which began in January 2011, opposite Lucy Durack as Glinda, Jemma Rix as Elphaba, David Harris as Fiyero and Maggie Kirkpatrick as Madame Morrible. In 2011 he was part of the Australian cast performing &quot;Wicked&quot; in Singapore. Altogether, Newton had a three-year run in this show.

In July 2012 Newton joined the Melbourne cast of &quot;Annie&quot; for a few weeks, taking over the role of President Roosevelt from Alan Jones.

From August 2013 Newton returned to the stage in producer John Frost&#x27;s production of &quot;Grease The Musical&quot;, playing disc jockey Vince Fontaine.

Newton played the narrator in the 2015 Australian production of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===
Newton was an institution of the Logie Awards since the awards since 1959. He was nominated for many Logie Awards and won several:
Three &#x27;Best Compere&#x27; awards: 1972, 1973, 1974 (for his role in &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot; and &quot;The Graham Kennedy Show&quot;)

===Hosting===
Newton hosted the Logie Awards ceremony on 19 occasions: 1968–1980, 1982, 1984, 1989, 1993 and 2010, and co-host in 2006. He holds the record for both the most Logies hosted and the most Logies hosted in a continuous run. Some notable moments of his hosting include:

* At the 1979 Logies awards Newton said to Muhammad Ali, &quot;I like the boy&quot;, not knowing that &quot;boy&quot; could be taken as a racial slur. Ali responded &quot;Did he call me Roy?&quot; and members of the audience, including Don Lane, shouted to Newton to say &quot;Yes—&quot;Roy!&quot;&quot;. Newton looked puzzled and later explained to the media that he did not realise that &quot;boy&quot; was used as a racial slur. Ali realised Newton&#x27;s use was meant endearingly and they literally kissed and made up later on. Immediately after the incident, Newton lightened the tension of the incident by saying: &quot;I&#x27;ll change my name, my religion ... anything&quot;, referring to Ali&#x27;s change of name from Cassius Clay when he adopted Islam in 1964, and proceeding to shake his hands in feigned nervousness. &quot;I like the boy&quot; was a catchphrase Newton had previous used on a commercial playing Colonel Sanders.
* In 1973, American actor Michael Cole, best known for his role in the TV series &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;, accepted an award while obviously drunk and ended his barely coherent thank-you speech with the word &quot;shit&quot;, to which Newton, after a classic pause, merely added &#x27;congratulations&#x27;.
* In 2006, after the awards, he had a fall and injured himself. The injury was visible for a number of &quot;Bert&#x27;s Family Feud&quot; episodes.

==Honours==

Newton was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1979, for his service to the performing arts.

On 12 June 2006, he was made a Member of the Order of Australia &quot;for service to the entertainment industry as a presenter, actor, comedian, and through support for a range of medical research and charitable organisations&quot;.

Newton was the first Melbourne-born King of Moomba in 1978.

A song called &quot;For Bert&quot; was written by GTV-9&#x27;s musical director Brian Rangott. The lyrics include:
:Everything I do,
:I do for Bert –
:Some may think Bert&#x27;s not much,
:But they like his gentle touch –
:Everything I do,
:I do for Bert!

In 1997, Newton was the subject of a &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; tribute. His wife Patti was honoured with her own tribute in 2001.

&quot;The Best of Bert Newton&quot; was aired in 2002. &quot;Channel Nine Salutes Bert Newton&quot; was broadcast in early 2004, depicting the career of Newton from his earliest days.

In 2001, he was awarded the Centenary Medal.

Show business awards include a Mo Award (1995), two Television Society of Australia awards (1981 and 1983), three Penguin Citations and three Pater (Professional Excellence in Television and Radio Arts and Sciences) awards for radio.

To celebrate the 50th anniversary of television in Australia, Channel 9 ran a show titled &quot;50 Years, 50 Stars&quot;, where they looked back at the top 50 stars of Australian television. Newton was listed as the No. 1 Australian TV star of the past 50 years.

On 1 July 2008, Newton was named Victorian of the Year.

On 23 July 2008, Channel 9 marked Newton&#x27;s 70th birthday with a one-hour special of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; hosted by Mike Munro.
In 2018, he was honoured by Australia Post in a series of issued stamps called the Australian Legends series that features stars from Australian television.

Two weeks after his death, on 12 November 2021, Newton was given a Victorian state funeral, conducted at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in Melbourne.

==Personal life==
In 1974, Newton married Patti McGrath with whom he worked on television. The Newtons had two children, son Matthew and daughter Lauren. Matthew Newton is an actor who has appeared in a number of Australian films and television dramas. Lauren Newton married swimmer Matt Welsh.

In 1993, a gambling problem led Newton to near bankruptcy and a $1 million debt.

In 2020, Newton was the subject of an episode of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; which focused primarily on his father and maternal grandparents. The episode first aired on 26 May 2020.

===Health and death===
In November 2012, Newton underwent quadruple heart bypass surgery, having been admitted to hospital twice in the twelve months prior.

Newton was admitted to Epworth Hospital several times for pneumonia recovery in March and April 2017.

Newton had a toe infection in late 2020 and, due to complications treating this, one of his legs was amputated below the knee in May 2021. He died in Prahran, Victoria, on 30 October 2021, aged 83.
He is interred at the Cedars section of the Springvale Botanical Cemetery, Melbourne.

<doc id="1038555" wikidata="Q739391" url="?curid=1038555" title="Shiretoko National Park">
<text>covers most of the Shiretoko Peninsula at the northeastern tip of the island of Hokkaidō, Japan. The word &quot;Shiretoko&quot; is derived from an Ainu word &quot;sir etok&quot;, meaning &quot;the place where the earth protrudes&quot;.

One of the most remote regions in Japan, much of the peninsula is only accessible on foot or by boat. Shiretoko is best known as the home of Japan&#x27;s largest population of brown bears, and for offering views of Kunashiri Island, ownership of which Japan and Russia dispute. Shiretoko is also the home of many birds, such as Steller&#x27;s sea eagle and white-tailed eagle, and marine animals such as spotted seal, orca whale, and sperm whale. The park has a hot springs waterfall called . &quot;Kamui wakka&quot; means &quot;water of the gods&quot; in Ainu.

The forests of the park are temperate and subalpine mixed forests; the main tree species include Sakhalin fir (&quot;Abies sachalinensis&quot;), Erman&#x27;s birch (&quot;Betula ermanii&quot;) and Mongolian oak (&quot;Quercus mongolica&quot;). Beyond the forest limit there are impenetrable Siberian dwarf pine (&quot;Pinus pumila&quot;) thickets.

In 2005, UNESCO designated the area a World Heritage Site, advising to develop the property jointly with the Kuril Islands of Russia as a transboundary &quot;World Heritage Peace Park&quot;. Shiretoko&#x27;s listing as Natural Heritage was seen by the Indigenous Ainu as contradicting the long history of Ainu settlement in the park area.

The Shiretoko Park Nature Center is in Shari. It serves as the visitor center and includes a movie about the park, a restaurant, and a gift shop.

<text>Le Bourget () is a commune in the northeastern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the center of Paris.

The commune features Le Bourget Airport, which in turn hosts the Musée de l&#x27;Air et de l&#x27;Espace (Air and Space Museum). A very small part of Le Bourget Airport lies on the territory of the commune of Le Bourget, which nonetheless gave its name to the airport. Most of the airport lies on the territory of the communes of Dugny, Bonneuil-en-France, and Gonesse. The Bureau d&#x27;Enquêtes et d&#x27;Analyses pour la Sécurité de l&#x27;Aviation Civile is also headquartered on the airport grounds and in Le Bourget proper.

==Typology==
Le Bourget is an urban commune, as it is one of the dense or intermediate density communes, as defined by the Insee communal density grid. It belongs to the urban unit of Paris, an inter-departmental conurbation comprising 407 communes and 10,785,092 inhabitants in 2017, of which it is a suburban commune.

The commune is also part of the functional area of Paris where it is located in the main population and employment centre of the functional area. This area comprises 1,929 communes.

===Highways===
The town is served by two major Highways (&quot;Autoroutes&quot;), A1 autoroute in the north of the town, and A86 autoroute in the south of the city. Those two highways ensure a direct connection to major Paris Region hubs like La Defense (A86 West), Bobigny (A86 East), Roissy Charles de Gaulle Airport (A1 North), Paris (A1 South).

===Air===
Paris–Le Bourget Airport is the first business flights airport in Europe. It connects with 800 destinations in Europe.

On May 8, 1927, the White Bird (&quot;l&#x27;Oiseau blanc&quot;) took off from Le Bourget and its pilots, Charles Nungesser and François Coli, hoped to reach New York City without stopovers. The plane disappeared without a trace. It was finally Charles Lindbergh who made the first air crossing of the North Atlantic between New York and Paris on May 21, 1927. He was welcomed as the &quot;victor&quot; of the North Atlantic, posing on his &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;. An enormous crowd also welcomed Edouard Daladier on September 29, 1938, after the signing of the Munich Agreement signed between Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy represented respectively by Adolf Hitler, Edouard Daladier, Neville Chamberlain and Benito Mussolini (who had acted as intermediary).

<text>Tristar and Red Sector Incorporated (TRSI) is a demogroup which formed in 1990. It came about from the longest-running cooperation in scene history. RSI existed from 1985, before being joined by the &quot;T&quot; later on. Evolving from the Commodore 64 to the Amiga and later to PC and various game console platforms - like the PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo - and set-ups like Arduino, Android or Blu-ray, TRSI released a number of digital productions, dedicated to experimenting in phreaking or network alteration. Its members were spread around the world and still contribute to computer scene art and code after more than 27 years of history.

==History==
===1985 to 1987===
Red Sector Incorporated (RSI) was founded with a focus on the Commodore 64 as a group for cracks, fixes, trainers, packs, intros and demos. The founders were three suppliers from Canada: Bill Best, Greg and Kangol Kid. After the initial formation in the spring of 1985, The Skeleton and Baudsurfer set up RSI&#x27;s first domain, &quot;The Pirates Ship&quot; BBS the following summer, which eventually became the &quot;Dawn of Eternity&quot; BBS.

At the end of the year, Irata and Mister Zeropage were asked to join the group and set up a European section in Germany, with Irata being the group&#x27;s main trader, followed by additional importers in the United States. Slogans at the time included &quot;No risk, no fun - Red Sector Number One&quot; and &quot;Red Sector - The Leading Force&quot;. The Light Circle was a basis for several future European members of RSI, a coalition of Radwar Enterprises, Cracking Force Berlin and Flash Cracking Formation.

Red Sector Incorporated first released on the Amiga 1000 in 1986. During the summer, RSI decided to concentrate on the Amiga and formed an Amiga division.

In the beginning of 1987, Red Sector&#x27;s Commodore 64 section became dormant, to bundle forces on the Amiga. At this time, RSI&#x27;s first Amiga demo was coded by HQC and released to the Scene. It was followed by the second, &quot;Twilight with Music&quot; by Karsten Obarski. At the end of the year, a short-term cooperation was formed with Ghenna of Defjam, marking the first group cooperation on the Amiga.

<text>The Adaro 1.E.7 Chirta was a Spanish military trainer aircraft built shortly before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War.

==Design and development==
Designed in 1934 in response to a Spanish Air Force requirement as part of its modernisation programme, the Chirta was a conventional sesquiplane, constructed of wood and metal and seating the student and instructor in tandem open cockpits. Slightly tapered wings had ailerons only on the upper wings; unusually, these covered the full span. Fuel was carried in an upper wing tank. There was a cut-out in the trailing edge of the upper wing for better upward visibility from the rear seat; the front seat was under the wing. A triangular fin carried a slightly rounded, unbalanced rudder. The tailskid undercarriage had faired wheels on V-form main legs. The Chirta was intended to undertake fighter training and to be fully aerobatic.

Though the exact date of the first flight of the Chirta is not known, by early July 1935 it was flying and sufficiently developed to have taken part in competitive trials for the trainer contract. It was evaluated against the Gil-Pazó GP-1 and Hispano E-34 but was ranked third, so no production contract was awarded. No further examples were built, though the prototype survived undamaged until at least November 1936, when Francoist forces captured Cuatro Vientos, where the trials had taken place.

<text>Thomas Joseph Clancy (29 October 1924 – 7 November 1990) was a member of the Irish folk group the Clancy Brothers. He had the most powerful voice of the brothers and had previously been an actor in numerous stage productions, appearing with Orson Welles in &quot;King Lear&quot;. He also performed often on television and occasionally in the movies.

==Early years==

Tom Clancy was one of eleven children born to Johanna McGrath and Bob Clancy in Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary. After being apprenticed as a baker, Clancy followed his older brother Patrick &quot;Paddy&quot; Clancy into the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1943 during World War II, despite both having been members of the Irish Republican Army. In the RAF, Clancy worked as a radio operator on bombing runs over Germany.

Discharged from the RAF at the war&#x27;s end, Clancy toured with a British repertory company. In 1947 he and his brother Paddy emigrated to Canada. They then moved to New York where Tom met his first wife and his oldest daughter was born in 1950. They then soon moved to Cleveland, Ohio, to live with relatives. Tom worked for a while as a repertory actor at the Cleveland Playhouse, before returning temporarily to Ireland. While in Ireland, Clancy worked for the Shakespeareana Internationale company run by English actor and manager Geoffrey Kendal. After Paddy sent him extra money, Tom Clancy returned to the United States. The brothers planned to move to California, but their car broke down. They decided to try New York City instead and found work as actors, both on and off Broadway.

== The Clancy Brothers==
In 1956 their brother Liam Clancy joined them, accompanied by his friend Tommy Makem. Liam Clancy and Tommy Makem began singing together, and in 1959 were joined by the older Clancy brothers as The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. The group performed together until Liam left in 1976. Makem had left in 1969 to be replaced for a brief time by Bobby Clancy and later Louis Killen.

Tom Clancy continued singing with The Clancy Brothers until 1976, when the group was disbanded. The group reformed in 1977 with a new line-up. Clancy performed with his brothers Paddy and Bobby and their nephew Robbie O&#x27;Connell until his death. He also performed with Paddy, Liam, and Tommy Makem during their reunion tour from 1984 to 1985.

Tom took the lead vocals on many of the group&#x27;s songs, such as &quot;The Rising of the Moon&quot;, &quot;The Moonshiner&quot;, &quot;Haul Away Joe&quot;, &quot;Red Haired Mary&quot;, &quot;The Barnyards of Delgaty&quot;, &quot;Carrickfergus&quot;, &quot;I Once Loved a Lass&quot;, and &quot;The Bold Fenian Men&quot;, among others.

==Later acting career==
Clancy continued to act during his singing career, appearing in the movies &quot;The Killer Elite&quot; (1975) and &quot;Swashbuckler&quot; (1976). He also appeared on episodes of &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot;, and &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, among others. He acted in several TV movies as well.

After an absence of fifteen years, Clancy returned to Broadway in May 1974 in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;A Moon for the Misbegotten&quot;. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; reviewed his performance of Phil Hogan: &quot;In &#x27;Moon&#x27; he deftly measures up to the formidable company in which he finds himself – a wily, sly rogue with a whimsical humour and a genuine concern for his daughter&quot;. The play was a hit and won three Tony Awards.

==Death==
Clancy died from stomach cancer at the age of 66 in 1990 at Mercy Hospital in Cork City, County Cork.

He was survived by his wife Joan and their three daughters, Rayleen, Blawneen and Rosie, who was only two years old (at the time of his death, it was incorrectly reported that he and wife Joan had four daughters). Before his marriage to his wife Joan, he had had two children, Eileen and Thomas, with Yvonne Marcus, in Cleveland, Ohio. He also had a daughter, Cait, with his second wife Laine, in the mid-1950s.

His last recording was made in 1988 with Robbie O&#x27;Connell, Bobby Clancy, and Paddy Clancy at St. Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire. Unfortunately, the recording is marred by unevenly mixed instruments and voices. After Tom&#x27;s death, Liam returned to the Clancy Brothers to fill in his place.

Originally an all-boys school, the College now offers a co-education Kindergarten, and an all-boys environment from Foundation to Year 12. In 2011, the school had 2,085 students on roll, including 76 boarders.

The school is in the Archdiocese of Melbourne, and is affiliated with the Independent Primary School Heads of Australia (IPSHA) formerly the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA), the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Australian Boarding Schools&#x27; Association (ABSA), and the Associated Public Schools of Victoria (APS).

In December 2010, &quot;The Age&quot; reported that, on the number of alumni who had received a top Order of Australia honour, Xavier College ranked equal tenth among Australian schools.

Grant Thomas described the school as &quot;the best-connected school in Melbourne&quot;. Its notable alumni include one archbishop, two state governors, one deputy prime minister, one state premier, three deputy premiers, one High Court justice and numerous Supreme Court justices.

==History==

What is now called &quot;The Senior Campus&quot; is located on Barkers Road in Kew, 8 kilometres (5 miles) from the centre of Melbourne. The foundation stone of the campus was laid in 1872 and the school began formally in 1878 on land known originally as Mornane&#x27;s Paddock. Founded as a Jesuit school, it was originally named St Francis Xavier&#x27;s College. Construction continued during the school&#x27;s early years, with the main oval added in 1883, and the West Wing and Great Hall in 1890. In 1900, Xavier replaced St Patrick&#x27;s College in East Melbourne as the only Catholic institution among the six Associated Public Schools at that time. A Memorial Chapel on the Senior Campus was constructed in memory of Old Xaverians killed in World War I, opening in 1934.

In 1993, a multi-purpose sports centre, the Stephenson Centre (since renamed), was opened. A science facility and the Eldon Hogan Performing Arts Centre opened on the campus in 2008, with eleven science laboratories, a music rehearsal room, and a 500-seat auditorium.

At his appointment as principal in October 1997, Chris McCabe was the first lay head of a Jesuit school in Australia. On his retirement at the end of 2008, the post was filled by Chris Hayes, the former principal at St Edmund&#x27;s, Canberra.

Some buildings on the Senior Campus, and Studley House at the Burke Hall Campus, are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.

Xavier has a long-standing rivalry with St Kevin&#x27;s College, in legal circles, an Old Xaverian Supreme Court judge quipping that &#x27;You boys who were taught by the Brothers can never aspire to the Supreme Court. Positions on that Bench are reserved for those of us who were taught by the Jesuits&#x27;.

;Memorial Chapel
An Italian Renaissance style chapel was built in 1927 to celebrate the golden jubilee of Xavier College. From conception to completion, construction took around sixteen years and was led by Rectors Edmund Frost and Frank O’Keefe.

The foundation stone reads:
;Burke Hall

In 1920, Studley Hall, a gift from T.M. Burke, a Catholic businessman, was opened in 1921 as Xavier&#x27;s first preparatory school. James O&#x27;Dwyer SJ, Rector of Xavier between 1908 and 1917, became Burke Hall&#x27;s first headmaster, before the campus was renamed Burke Hall several years later in honour of its benefactor. Burke donated a classroom block in 1923 and, in 1926, Burke&#x27;s wife provided funding for a construction of a chapel in memory of her deceased brother. The campus was extended in 1966 with the donation of an adjacent mansion from the estate of John Wren following his death. After renovations to the original ballroom, which in 1975 became the library, and the original hall had been converted to classrooms, a new classroom block was built in 1987. A multi-purpose hall was constructed in 1997 overlooking the main oval that was re-graded in 1998. In 2002, a co-educational Early Years Centre was opened on the Burke Hall campus for students up to grade 4. In 2011, a new classroom block, the St Mary MacKillop Building, was added and named after the first Australian-born saint, the St Mary MacKillop is a space for classes year 5 &amp; 6.

;Kostka Hall
Following the request by Daniel Mannix, Archbishop of Melbourne, that the school should have a campus in the southern suburbs of the city, William Hackett SJ, Rector of Xavier opened the Kostka Hall Junior campus in Brighton in 1937, with the addition of a second building, Marchwood (also known as St Johns). This was demolished in 1959 to make way for a major building project, including classrooms, tuckshop, and administrative buildings, and a chapel was built in 1967. Science rooms were added in 1969, and in the 1970s the Jesuits bought various adjoining properties to expand the campus. In 1996 a multi-purpose hall was completed with a new arts centre opened in 1998. In 2005 an Early Years Centre based on the one at Burke Hall was opened. This campus was closed in 2021, due to a decline in enrollments, and in 2024 a new building called &#x27;The Kostka Building&#x27; was built at the Senior Campus, primarily to be used by year 7 and 8 students, who in 2024 transitioned from Burke Hall to the Senior Campus.

;Buxton Campus
In addition to the three main campuses, the school has an outdoor education facility in Buxton, near Marysville, and a rowing shed on the banks of the Yarra River. It previously leased the historical mansion Billilla in Halifax Street, Brighton, from the Bayside City Council. In 2009, the Buxton outdoor education centre was temporarily closed due to extensive damage from the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria, and was later sold in 2015.

==Houses==

===Senior Campus===
After existing in some form for several decades, in 1977, the system of inter-house sport and activities was restructured. Each house was assigned a housemaster and seven tutors. Boys are split up into these seven tutor groups within each house and the tutor group meets each day with the tutor acting as mentor during their four-year attendance. House meetings take place around once a week, lockers are organised according to house and several inter-house sporting events are held each year. In 1991, the houses, previously known by their colour, were given names. and in 2010, the new houses of MacKillop and Regis were added.
† Unawarded 2001–2002.

‡ Gonzaga and Claver shared the 2010 Old Xaverians Trophy for the Champion House, having accumulated the same number of points throughout the year.

===Burke Hall===
The six houses of Burke Hall had existed for many years as Hodgson, Ignatius, Studley, Surbiton, Trawalla, and Waverley. In 1987, two new houses were added and with the exception of Ignatius, the houses were renamed. Due to the Year Seven and Eights moving to the Senior Campus in 2024, new houses will be made for the Junior School and will be implemented at the start of the 2024 school year. 
‡ Tied premierships: 1987, 2006.

====Early Years Centre====
Upon its foundation in 2002, separate houses were created for the Early Years Centre students at Burke Hall.

===Kostka Hall===
Awards commenced in 1971.
==Curriculum==
Xavier offers its senior students the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE). Thirty-three VCE subjects and five external VET studies are offered. Xavier is one of only fifteen schools in Victoria to offer Latin and one of only two schools which offer Ancient Greek, which it has done continuously since 1878. Xavier and sister school Genazzano FCJ College have collaborated to develop a cross curriculum appreciation of the Classics as seen in both school&#x27;s Latin as a LOTE option. Xavier does not offer the International Baccalaureate.

Xavier has a strong academic history. For each of the past sixteen years (excluding 2009 and 2015) the Dux of the school received an ATAR score of 99.95, the highest possible. In 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2016, three students achieved this mark at Xavier out of 32 in the state. In 2012, five students achieved the maximum ATAR of 99.95.
==Co-curriculum==
The main activities include Sport, Music, Drama, Debating, and Community Service. Students may also join specific interest groups such as the Chess Club. Outdoor Education is compulsory in Years 5 to 10, and students spend up to one week at a range of venues, where they are given instruction in a variety of activities.

===Community service===
Students are encouraged to participate in community service, and a minimum amount of completed service hours is mandated. Each Friday evening Xavier students volunteer their time at a tutoring school in housing commission apartments in Richmond, where many residents are recent migrants or refugees. This activity is completed with students from the sister school Genazzano FCJ College. Year 11 students are required to participate in an additional 35 hours while on a week-long community service placement.

In collaboration with Genazzano FCJ College, Xavier College participates in a community outreach program in conjunction with the combined parishes of Our Lady of Good Counsel, Deepdene, Sacred Heart, Kew and Immaculate Conception, Hawthorn. For the duration of one week, 12 students from the partnered schools participate in a community building program in Bourke, an Outback town of New South Wales.

===Debating===
From Year 8 and above, students have the opportunity to participate in the Toorak division of the Debaters Association of Victoria competition. The college also takes part in the annual Jesuit Schools&#x27; Debating Carnival competing with Aloysius, Ignatius Riverview, Ignatius Adelaide and Loyola Mt Druitt.

===Sport===

Sport is compulsory for all students at Xavier, and in addition to cricket and Australian rules football, a range of sporting activities are offered including
athletics,
badminton,
basketball,
cross country,
hockey,
lawn bowls,
martial arts,
rowing,
rugby union,
sailing
soccer,
swimming,
table tennis,
tennis,
triathlon,
water polo, and volleyball.

Cricket alongside rowing (colloquially known as XCBC) are the two biggest summer sports at the college. Two alumni who pursued careers in cricekt were Percy McDonnell (1860–1896) who captained the Australian Test team in six matches, including the tour of England in 1888, and Karl Schneider (1905–1928), who is described in Cricinfo as one of &quot;the most naturally gifted batsmen to have graced the game&quot;. While at the school, he played in the 1st XI for four years, three of which as captain. He broke the APS runs (1642) and wickets (139) records which remain unbroken, and captained Xavier to back-to-back premierships in 1923–24. 

Xavier has won the rowing APS Head of the River 5 times. Sixteen Xavier rowers have gone on to represent Australia, winning multiple Olympic and World Championship medals, including, among others, Peter Antonie, Michael McKay, Nick Green &amp; Simon Keenan.

The school&#x27;s Australian rules football team has produced numerous VFL/AFL players, and has won thirty football premierships, third of the APS schools behind Scotch (36) and Melbourne Grammar (35). The Old Xaverians Football Club has also been successful in the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA), winning eight premierships in the last decade.

Along with football, the school&#x27;s Old Xaverian community also links with the Old Xaverians Soccer Club and Old Xaverians Athletics Club.

The two Junior Campuses also have Performing Arts and Dramatic programs, each staging a major production every year. With the development of both the Crypt Drama Studio, below the Memorial Chapel, in 1999 and the Eldon Hogan Performing Arts Centre, performing arts at the college has become an integral part in the school&#x27;s co-curricular program.

==Maytime Fair==
The Maytime Fair has been held annually in May since 1952 and is hosted by Xavier College. It raises funds for the work of the Jesuit Mission, with support from friends and benefactors connected with schools, parishes, and other communities in Victoria and beyond. The annual fairs have been assisted by traditional sister school Genazzano FCJ College, and together, the two schools have provided a number of student-run stalls such as &quot;Go Nuts for Donuts&quot;, a Fairy Tent and face-painting, amongst others.

Each stall and attraction at the Maytime Fair donates its profit to the work of Jesuit Mission. The Maytime Fair consistently contributes over $100,000 each year for work in the developing world, including India, Cambodia, East Timor and Myanmar. In 2008 over $130,000 was raised, which was given to assist in the relief effort by Jesuit Missionaries in response to the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. In 2010, over $150,000 was raised, and in 2016 $260,000 was raised

<text>Ameesha Patel (; born 9 June 1975) is an Indian actress who appears in Hindi and Telugu films. Patel is the recipient of several awards such as a Filmfare Award and a Zee Cine Award.

Patel made her acting debut in 2000 with the romantic thriller film &quot;Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai&quot;, a major commercial success, which earned her the Zee Cine Award for Best Female Debut. This success continued with the Telugu action film &quot;Badri&quot; (2000) and the top-grossing period film &quot;&quot; (2001), which won her a Filmfare Special Performance Award. After starring in &quot;Humraaz&quot; and &quot;Kya Yehi Pyaar Hai&quot; (both 2002), Patel&#x27;s career declined, and she took on supporting roles in &quot;Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd.&quot; (2007), &quot;Bhool Bhulaiyaa&quot; (2007) and &quot;Race 2&quot; (2013). 

After continued fluctuations, Patel made a career comeback by reprising her role in the sequel &quot;Gadar 2&quot; (2023), which emerged as her highest grossing release. In addition to her acting career, Patel is a humanitarian and works for a number of causes.

==Early life and background==
Patel was born to a Gujarati father, Amit Patel, and a Sindhi and Punjabi NRI mother, Asha, on 9 June 1975. She is the sister of Ashmit Patel and the granddaughter of lawyer-politician Barrister Rajni Patel, who was the Congress Pradesh Committee President of Mumbai. She was born in the Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai and has been a trained Bharatnatyam dancer since the age of five. Her birth-name is a blend of the first three letters of her father&#x27;s name Amit and the last three letters of her mother&#x27;s name Asha.

Patel studied at Cathedral and John Connon School in Mumbai and was head girl for the academic year 1992–93 before heading to Tufts University in Boston in the United States to study bio-genetic engineering, which she studied for two years, before eventually switching her major to economics.

Patel&#x27;s career began as an economic analyst at Khandwala Securities Limited after graduation. Later on, she received an offer from Morgan Stanley but turned it down. After returning to India, she joined Satyadev Dubey&#x27;s theatre group and acted in plays, including an Urdu language play titled &quot;Neelam&quot; (1999), that was written by Tanveer Khan, upon receiving permission from her conservative parents.
At the same time she plunged into modelling, appearing in several commercial campaigns. Patel has also modelled for well-known Indian brands such as &quot;Bajaj&quot;, &quot;Fair &amp; Lovely&quot;, &quot;Cadburys&quot;, &quot;Fem&quot;, &quot;Lux&quot; and many more.

Her grandfather Rajni Patel was a lawyer and Indian national congress&#x27;s politician. A street in Mumbai &#x27;Barrisrer Rajani Patel Marge&#x27; was named after him in 1986.

==Acting career==
===Debut and initial success (2000–2002)===
Patel&#x27;s first opportunity for acting came in the form of an offer from her father&#x27;s schoolmate, Rakesh Roshan, to star opposite his son, Hrithik Roshan, in the romantic thriller &quot;Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai&quot; (2000). The offer came immediately after she graduated from high school, but she refused the project because she wanted to continue her education in the US. Afterwards, Kareena Kapoor replaced her, but luckily, Kapoor dropped out a few days into the principal photography and Patel was given the opportunity once again during a family lunch. She readily agreed to do the project this time. The role of Sonia Saxena, an exuberant college girl in love, undergoing a tortuous time after losing her lover and rediscovering a more mature relationship, gave Patel scope to perform. The film was a major commercial success and established Patel as a rising star, earning her a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. In her second film, the Telugu language drama &quot;Badri&quot;, she starred opposite Pawan Kalyan. The film was a major success, earning more than ₹12 crore distributor share in India.

2001 saw her appearing in Anil Sharma&#x27;s cross-border romance , alongside Sunny Deol. Patel signed on much before she shot into the limelight with &quot;Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai&quot; and was among 22 girls that were screen-tested from 500 girls who came to audition for the film. Patel had gone through a 12-hour audition before she got the part. The film went on to become the top-grossing film of the year, as well as the biggest hit of the 21st century, earning Rs 973 million in India. Set during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, it featured Patel as Sakeena, a Muslim girl who finds refuge in Deol&#x27;s house during the riots, and subsequently falls for him. Her performance was praised, and won her the Filmfare Special Performance Award, in addition to her first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Taran Adarsh of &quot;IndiaFM&quot; concluded: &quot;Despite being one-film-old, Patel deserves full marks for handling the complex role with elegance. She looks the character she is portraying and impresses with a natural performance.&quot; The film was perceived as being excessively anti-Pakistani.

These successes were followed by a series of films that flopped at the box office. In the romantic drama &quot;Yeh Zindagi Ka Safar&quot; (2001) opposite Jimmy Sheirgill, she played a successful singer who was abandoned by her mother at the time of her birth.

In 2002, Patel starred in three consecutive flops. In &quot;Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage&quot;, she played the role of Sapna, who is caged in protective custody of her own father. The film marked her second collaboration with Hrithik Roshan. Unlike their successful pairing in &quot;Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai&quot;, the film proved to be a major disappointment and emerged as a critical and commercial failure. Patel&#x27;s performance in the film was highly criticised by a section of the media, but during an interview she clarified that there was an &quot;error&quot; because the scene explaining that her character is supposed to be asthmatic in the film was edited out not knowing that one shot would make such a difference, thus creating confusion to the viewer about her appearing out of breath, as if she&#x27;s overacting or crying. Patel&#x27;s unsuccessful follow-up continued with &quot;Kranti&quot; opposite Bobby Deol and David Dhawan&#x27;s comedy &quot;Yeh Hai Jalwa&quot; opposite Salman Khan. The same year, she tasted minor box office success with the romance &quot;Kya Yehi Pyaar Hai&quot;, in which she played a career-oriented young woman who rejects the advances of Aftab Shivdasani&#x27;s character. She found major success when her final release of the year, the musical romantic thriller &quot;Humraaz&quot; alongside Bobby Deol and Akshaye Khanna. The Abbas–Mustan directorial saw her play a character with negative shades for the first time. She played the girlfriend of Akshaye Khanna, who marries Bobby Deol to grab his wealth – but, seeing Bobby&#x27;s honesty, her character surrenders to him. Taran Adarsh commented: &quot;Patel is just about okay as Akshaye&#x27;s lover (first half), but splendid as Bobby&#x27;s wife (second half). This performance should silence her detractors for sure. Also, she&#x27;s looked her best with admirable outfits and perfect make-up.&quot; &quot;Humraaz&quot; emerged as the fifth highest-grossing film of the year at the box office, and her performance earned her a second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.

===Struggle phase (2003–2006)===
During 2003 to 2006, Patel&#x27;s acting career entered a slump. After the success of &quot;Humraaz&quot;, her string of unsuccessful films followed, and continued until 2006. In 2003, her only releases were the Tamil language film &quot;Pudhiya Geethai&quot; and the Hindi film Deepak Bahry&#x27;s &quot;Parwana&quot;. &quot;Pudhiya Geethai&quot; was the first and only Tamil film that she ever starred in. Her releases in 2004, Vimal Kumar&#x27;s comedy &quot;Suno Sasurjee&quot;, a delayed production since 2000, and her second Telugu language film &quot;Naani&quot;, followed. The same year, she also appeared in the music videos for &quot;O Meri Jaan&quot; and &quot;Hai Kasam Tu Na Ja&quot; by Adnan Sami.

In 2005, she starred in Satish Kaushik&#x27;s thriller &quot;Vaada&quot;, playing Arjun Rampal&#x27;s unfaithful wife who is followed by her obsessive ex-lover. In her next release, &quot;Elaan&quot;, she played a TV reporter. She later appeared in Ketan Mehta&#x27;s historical drama &quot;Mangal Pandey: The Rising&quot; alongside Aamir Khan, where she played the role of the soft-spoken Jwala, a Bengali widow who gets rescued from committing Sati by a British commanding officer. Patel was cast as a replacement for Aishwarya Rai under the recommendation of Khan, who was impressed by her IQ level when he saw her on &quot;BBC&quot; under the segment of &quot;Question Time India&quot; in 2003. The film, which saw her in a deglamorized role for the first time, emerged as an average grosser at the box office. Her other releases that year include &quot;&quot;, a delayed production since 2001, and the Telugu film &quot;Narasimhudu&quot;, both which failed at the box office.

Patel featured in six films in 2006, all of which failed commercially. She first appeared alongside Akshay Kumar and Karisma Kapoor in Suneel Darshan&#x27;s musical romance &quot;Mere Jeevan Saathi&quot;, a delayed production since 2003. Her second release, &quot;Humko Tumse Pyaar Hai&quot;, saw her playing a blind village girl who gets stuck in a love triangle after undergoing eye surgery. The production was halted since 2002 due to the passing of its director-producer, until Patel&#x27;s boyfriend then, Vikram Bhatt, took it upon himself to complete the project. The film had a limited release and failed to perform at the box office with some critics terming it as &quot;outdated&quot;. In &quot;Teesri Aankh: The Hidden Camera&quot;, Patel played the role of a mute girl who witnesses a murder. She learned sign language for the role. She was next cast alongside Sanjay Dutt in &quot;Tathastu&quot;, based on Denzel Washington&#x27;s thriller &quot;John Q,&quot; (2002). Patel&#x27;s fifth release in 2006, &quot;Ankahee&quot;, earned her critical praise, despite emerging as a commercial failure at the box office. The film centred around an extramarital affair with Patel playing a housewife whose husband cheats on her with a model. To understand the mentality of a wronged wife, Patel spoke to her own grandmother who had undergone a similar situation. Diganta Guha from &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; noted &quot;...it&#x27;s Patel&#x27;s performance that remains in your mind. She is dignity personified in the film, playing a woman betrayed in marriage, going all out to save it and in the end choosing her own path.&quot; Later that year, she appeared alongside Akshaye Khanna and Priyanka Chopra in Dharmesh Darshan&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Aap Ki Khatir&quot;.

===2007–present===

After appearing in a series of box office flops during 2003–2006, Patel&#x27;s career prospects improved in 2007. Her first release that year was the ensemble comedy drama &quot;Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd.&quot;. The low-budget film achieved moderate success at the box office. Patel played the role of Karan Khanna&#x27;s talkative wife who tries to overcome her husband&#x27;s gay leanings. Her comic timing in the film was well received. Later in 2007, she co-starred opposite Akshay Kumar, Vidya Balan and Shiney Ahuja in Priyadarshan&#x27;s horror comedy &quot;Bhool Bhulaiyaa&quot; as a rejected adopted girl who is accused of trying to disrupt the marriage of her childhood crush.

In an attempt to renew her image, Patel appeared in a bikini item number, &quot;Lazy Lamhe&quot;, in Kunal Kohli&#x27;s fantasy comedy-drama &quot;Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic&quot; (2008). She learned scuba diving for the song that took 15 days to complete. Although the film flopped at the box office, Patel managed to garner attention for her appearance.

After the release of &quot;Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic&quot;, Patel signed on to two comedies; &quot;Run Bhola Run&quot; and &quot;Chatur Singh Two Star&quot;. However, both films were continuously delayed despite being completed in 2009. She next attempted a comeback by signing on to Rajkumar Santoshi&#x27;s &quot;Power&quot;. Patel was set to alongside an ensemble cast which also included Amitabh Bachchan, Sanjay Dutt, Anil Kapoor, Ajay Devgn and Kangana Ranaut, but the film was shelved after eight days of principal photography. Despite repeated attempts to land a starring role, Patel dropped out of several projects due to various reasons.

Following a two-and-a-half-year sabbatical, she made a comeback to the Telugu film industry in a brief role with &quot;Parama Veera Chakra&quot; (2011) alongside Nandamuri Balakrishna; the film flopped. In the same year, the long-delayed &quot;Chatur Singh Two Star&quot; saw the light of day after three years and emerged as a critical and commercial disaster. &quot;Run Bhola Run&quot; remains unreleased following the shutting down of the production company Shree Ashtavinayak Cine Vision, despite the trailer and posters being unveiled in late 2010.

On 23 April 2011, Patel hosted an event launching her production company, Ameesha Patel Productions, in collaboration with her friend and business partner Kuunal Goomer. Their debut home production, &quot;Desi Magic&quot;, was launched at an event on 2 April 2013.

In 2013, Patel returned to Hindi cinema with a special appearance in Abbas–Mustan&#x27;s &quot;Race 2&quot;, replacing Sameera Reddy as Anil Kapoor&#x27;s ditzy assistant. Though the film was critically panned, it emerged a box office success. She followed it with a starring role alongside Neil Nitin Mukesh in &quot;Shortcut Romeo&quot;, a Hindi remake of the 2006 Tamil hit &quot;Thiruttu Payale&quot;. The film opened to mixed reviews and performed poorly at the box office.

The teaser trailer for &quot;Desi Magic&quot; was launched on 18 December 2014.

In 2018, she played a movie star in the ensemble action comedy &quot;Bhaiaji Superhit&quot; alongside Sunny Deol and Preity Zinta, a production in the making since 2012. The film was poorly received by critics.

On 19 January 2019, it was announced her debut home production &quot;Desi Magic&quot; has been complete after six years in the making. However, it remains unreleased due to a legal battle.

In the same year, she entered the reality show &quot;Bigg Boss 13&quot; with a twist. She was seen as the &quot;maalkin&quot; of the house for the first week to give different interesting tasks to the housemates.

In 2023, Patel returned to acting after five years by reprising her role as Sakeena in &quot;Gadar 2&quot;, 22 years since its predecessor released. Despite a mixed critical response, the film was declared an all time blockbuster. &quot;Ameesha Patel doesn’t have much to do and is competent in her emotional scenes,&quot; noted Devesh Sharma of &quot;Filmfare&quot;. She followed it up with a special appearance in &quot;Mystery of the Tattoo&quot;.

In 2024, Patel appeared in the romantic thriller &quot;Tauba Tera Jalwa&quot;, a delayed production since 2020.

==Other work==
===Stage performances===

Patel performed in a number of concerts and world tours during her career. Her first world tour; &quot;The Roshans: Hrithik Live in Concert&quot; (2001), along with Hrithik Roshan, was performed across India.
In 2004, Patel took part in a series of concerts in the world tour &quot;Craze 2004&quot; alongside Hrithik Roshan, Saif Ali Khan and Lara Dutta. In 2005, Patel participated in Adnan Sami&#x27;s world tour &quot;Kuch Dil Se…&quot; that was performed across the US and Canada from 15 April till 15 May.
In October 2008, she participated in Himesh Reshammiya&#x27;s comeback concert &quot;Karzzzz Musical Curtain Raiser&quot; joined by Neha Dhupia, Riya Sen and Amrita Arora. In December 2008, she took part in Akshay Kumar&#x27;s Christmas Eve show &quot;Chandni Chowk to Hong&quot; along with Bipasha Basu, Priyanka Chopra, Riya Sen, Aarti Chhabria, Himesh Reshammiya and Punjabi rapper Bohemia as part of a promotional campaign for Kumar&#x27;s film &quot;Chandni Chowk to China&quot; (2009). In response to 26/11, many New Year&#x27;s Eve concerts for 2009 were cancelled, but Patel and Country Club India decided to go ahead with their show because they thought it would be against the terrorists&#x27; will.

===Humanitarian work===
In September 2004, Patel joined PETA, one of the organisations championing the cause of animals, as part of an advertising campaign which highlights the lives of captive animals in a zoo who are robbed of their natural surroundings for the amusement of others. Patel posed as a petrified prisoner in a jail cell to throw focus on the plight of animals in zoos. She said: 

In February 2005, along with other Bollywood stars, Patel performed at the &quot;HELP! Telethon Concert&quot; raising money for the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. She also took part in the &quot;Temptations 2005&quot; charity function in New Delhi on 24 December 2005 at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium in aid of the National Centre for Promotion of Employment of Disabled Persons (NCPEDP), a leading disabled rights&#x27; group.

In November 2006, Patel joined an NGO called &quot;PlanetRead&quot;, which helps people in villages to learn reading through film songs. In October 2007, Patel along with John Abraham and Kirron Kher joined the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to curb human trafficking in India.

==In the media==
Between 2002 and 2005, Patel made an appearance in a number of talk shows such as &quot;Rendezvous with Simi Garewal&quot; and &quot;The Manish Malhotra Show&quot;. In 2006, Patel appeared as the guest judge on the special Valentine&#x27;s Day episode of the singing talent contest &quot;Indian Idol 2&quot;.

Patel is frequently cited as one of the sexiest Bollywood actresses. Rediff featured Patel as one of Bollywood&#x27;s sexiest actresses and top Bollywood actresses of 2001. She was ranked tenth on Rediff&#x27;s list of 2008&#x27;s Sexiest Actresses. Patel was also cited by Rediff as one of 2008&#x27;s Sexiest Magazine Cover Girls. She has featured on the cover of &quot;Maxim India&quot; three times, as well as other men magazines such as &quot;The Man&quot;, &quot;FHM&quot;, and &quot;Man&#x27;s World&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1999, Patel met filmmaker Vikram Bhatt on the set of their first film together; &quot;Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage&quot; (2002), and they started dating since the film&#x27;s release. Later, it caused a rift between the Patel and Bhatt families with Patel running through a financial crisis after her father used her hard-earned money to resurrect a family business, causing misunderstandings between Patel and her parents. In July 2004, Patel sent a legal notice to her father for mismanaging her accounts and assets amounting to Rs 120 million and demanding the money back. Patel&#x27;s relationship with Bhatt was often reported to the media speculating on a possible marriage. In January 2008, the media reported that Patel and Bhatt broke their five-year relationship. Bhatt confirmed the break-up in a conversation with &quot;Mid-Day&quot;. Shortly afterwards, Patel&#x27;s parents explained their willingness to reconcile with their daughter and that &quot;everybody is happy about the break-up&quot; but their relationship remained strained. On 12 March 2008, Patel was spotted with London-based businessman Kanav Puri at Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week. In June 2008, she confirmed their relationship in an interview with &quot;Mid-Day&quot;: &quot;I did not admit to Kanav sooner because he&#x27;s very special and I did not want to jinx it. It was too precious for me to talk about it to people. It&#x27;s almost six months now and now I am feeling secure and now I know our relationship is too strong for anything or anyone to come between us.&quot; The media once reported that she married Puri but she denied these rumours.

In August 2009, &quot;Mumbai Mirror&quot; reported that Patel and her brother, Ashmit, had patched up on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan and were spotted together at PVR Cinemas in Juhu. Although the siblings agreed that the matter is sorted, they preferred not to speak about it publicly. In December 2009, Patel&#x27;s mother Asha had revealed they have finally ended their five-year estrangement during an interview with &quot;The Times of India&quot;.

In September 2010, &quot;Mumbai Mirror&quot; reported that Patel broke off the relationship with her long-time boyfriend Kanav Puri, to focus on her career. She confirmed it via Twitter.

===Controversies===
In August 2006, an Air India employee had filed a police complaint, alleging that Patel had misbehaved with her after her companion was not upgraded to first class on the Mumbai-New York flight on 18 August. Patel was on her way to attend India&#x27;s Independence Day parade in New York. Officers at the police station said Patel could be called in and warned about her behaviour, if charges against her are proved, and would be questioned once she returns from abroad. Later, CISF personnel have corroborated the Air India employees&#x27; version of the incident. Once Patel returned to India, she stated that the employees &quot;are only trying to safeguard themselves by filing a false complaint against us.&quot; Incidentally, there was also a drunken passenger, who joined in this verbal fight. Afterwards, the organisers of the annual parade sent a written apology and a clarification to Patel and said it had booked two first class seats for Patel and her companion for the Mumbai-New York flight but the booking was automatically transferred from one flight to another, creating confusion.

<doc id="1038605" wikidata="Q6805358" url="?curid=1038605" title="MediEvil (series)">
<text>MediEvil is a series of action-adventure hack and slash video games developed by SCE Studio Cambridge and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The series revolves around an undead charlatan knight, Sir Daniel Fortesque, as he attempts to restore peace to the fictional Kingdom of Gallowmere whilst simultaneously redeeming himself. The first entry in the series, &quot;MediEvil&quot;, was released for the PlayStation in 1998 and was re-released on the PlayStation Network in 2007. Its direct sequel, &quot;MediEvil 2&quot;, was released for the PlayStation in 2000. The first game received two remakes, &quot;&quot; for the PlayStation Portable in 2005 and &quot;MediEvil&quot; for the PlayStation 4 in 2019.

The first three installments of the series were developed by SCE Studio Cambridge (formerly known as Millennium Interactive), a subsidiary of Sony Computer Entertainment in Cambridge. Development of the first &quot;MediEvil&quot; began in 1995 and was inspired by Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;. The game was initially aimed for multiple consoles including Microsoft Windows platforms and the Sega Saturn; however, upon being shown progress, Sony Computer Entertainment signed &quot;MediEvil&quot; to be PlayStation-exclusive and commissioned the studio as SCE Cambridge. The music for all games was composed by Andrew Barnabas and Paul Arnold, commonly known as &quot;Bob &amp; Barn&quot;. Critics have been mostly positive to the series, with its graphics and story being particularly praised in the first two games. However, common criticisms included lack of innovation and cumbersome camera controls.

==Games==
===&quot;MediEvil&quot;===

&quot;MediEvil&quot; is an action-adventure video game, released in Europe 9 October 1998 and North America on 21 October and in Japan on 17 June 1999. It was re-released on the PlayStation Network in 2007. The story of the game begins in the year 1286, when an evil sorcerer named Zarok plots to take over the kingdom of Gallowmere with his undead army. During the battle, a charlatan knight, Sir Daniel Fortesque, led an army that managed to kill Zarok; however, Dan was in reality struck down and killed by the first arrow fired in battle. 100 years later, Zarok reappears and casts a spell over Gallowmere to awaken his undead army. However, he unwittingly revives the corpse of Dan in the process. Dan uses this opportunity to defeat Zarok, save Gallowmere and earn his place as a true hero.

===&quot;MediEvil 2&quot;===

&quot;MediEvil 2&quot; is the second installment in the series and serves as a direct sequel to the first game. It was released on 19 April 2000 in Europe and 30 April in North America. The game takes place 500 years after the first game&#x27;s events and follows series&#x27; protagonist Sir Daniel Fortesque&#x27;s revival in Victorian era London as he attempts to stop sorcerer Lord Palethorn and Jack the Ripper&#x27;s plans to terrorise the city by raising the dead. Dan is accompanied by Winston, a ghost sidekick, and Kira, a mummy princess who serves as the player-character&#x27;s love interest. The game features several improvements over the original, including improved enemy artificial intelligence, increased strategy combat, larger and more detailed levels, more powerful and diverse range of strategic weapons, and a more detailed characterisation and storyline.

===&quot;MediEvil: Resurrection&quot;===

&quot;MediEvil: Resurrection&quot; is the third installment in the series and is a re-imagining of the first game. It was released as a launch title for the PSP on 1 September 2005 in Europe and 13 September in North America. It was re-released for the PlayStation Network in 2008. Similar to the first game, it is set in the medieval Kingdom of Gallowmere and centres around the charlatan protagonist, Sir Daniel Fortesque, as he makes an attempt to stop antagonist Zarok&#x27;s invasion of the kingdom whilst simultaneously redeeming himself. Unlike the original, Dan is accompanied by Al-Zalam, a genie whose powers were taken away by Zarok. The game features updated graphics and a variety of voice talents, including Tom Baker as the narrator and the Grim Reaper.

===&quot;MediEvil&quot; remake===

A remaster/remake of &quot;MediEvil&quot; for the PlayStation 4 was developed by Other Ocean Interactive and released in October 2019.

==Development==
All three games of the series were developed by Cambridge-based SCE Studio Cambridge, formerly known as Millennium Interactive. Chris Sorrell, previously known for the &quot;James Pond&quot; series, created the original concept for &quot;MediEvil&quot; and served as the first game&#x27;s creative director. The original design proposal for the game had the working title &quot;Dead Man Dan&quot;, and was described by Sorrell as a &quot;fusion&quot; of Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Ghost&#x27;n Goblins&quot; combined with the art style of Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;. As development progressed, lead artist Jason Wilson asserted the game into more of a &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; role-playing video game-influenced direction as opposed to the original arcade-style concept. Looking to attract a major publishing deal, Millennium Interactive initially began working on multiple platforms including Windows 95 and the Sega Saturn before giving Sony of Europe a demonstration of the game. Impressed by the progress, Sony signed &quot;MediEvil&quot; to be an exclusive PlayStation game and commissioned SCE Studio Cambridge as Sony&#x27;s second studio in the United Kingdom.

SCE Cambridge felt that the game should possess a unique lead character; therefore, Sorrell collaborated with script doctor Martin Pond whilst creating a backstory for the lead protagonist, Sir Daniel Fortesque. Pond created the idea that Sir Daniel could have been a failure in life whose reincarnation was his only attempt at redemption. This idea, along with the player-character&#x27;s unusual appearance, turned appealing to some sectors of the gaming community, as lead designer Jason Wilson later recalled that female gamers considered Sir Daniel to be &quot;endearing&quot;. &quot;MediEvil&quot; was one of the first games to be developed for exclusive use with the PlayStation analogue controller. During development, Sony requested that the game should utilise the new functions of the controller, which was described as a &quot;particularly fortuitous event&quot; by Sorrell.

In 1999, after the success of the first &quot;MediEvil&quot;, Sony requested that SCE Cambridge develop a sequel that would be released before the end of the PlayStation&#x27;s lifespan. Chris Sorrell, who previously served as director of the first game, was not involved in development thus the project was handed over to James Shepherd. SCE Cambridge decided it would not be difficult to make a sequel to the first &quot;MediEvil&quot;, considering that the ending of its predecessor would give the team an opportunity to set the next game in a different time period. Shepherd settled on &quot;MediEvil 2&quot; being set in the Victorian era, the centrepiece of the Neo-Gothic revival. Shepherd considered the hardest part of the development was deciding how to make the game superior to its predecessor through making certain aspects of the game humorous. To achieve this end, the studio recoded various core technology, which Shepherd considered was arguably similar to &quot;starting from scratch&quot;. By the time the game reached beta status the game offered larger levels, improved non-player character (NPC) logic, and more fighting abilities for the player-character.

Development of &quot;MediEvil: Resurrection&quot; began in 2003. Sony of Europe wanted a launch game for the PlayStation Portable and ordered SCE Cambridge to develop the game in time for the console&#x27;s release. Due to the short notice, the studio was given only a year to develop a game, thus it was decided that a remake of the original &quot;MediEvil&quot; would be feasible as developing an original title would have taken considerably longer. New additions to &quot;Resurrection&quot; included an expanded plot, added mini-games, extra characters, multiplayer facilities and a cloud save function.

===Music===
The soundtrack of the first game was composed by Paul Arnold and Andrew Barnabas, the musical duo more commonly known as &quot;Bob &amp; Barn&quot;. SCE Cambridge instructed them to compose a Danny Elfman-influenced score, similar to those of &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; and &quot;Batman Returns&quot;. The music was created using electronic synthesizers to simulate an entire orchestra and organ. The music for &quot;MediEvil 2&quot; was also composed by &quot;Bob &amp; Barn&quot;. &quot;MediEvil: Resurrection&quot; used parts of the original &quot;MediEvil&quot; score, along with elements composed by Bob &amp; Barn that was performed by a live orchestra and choir. An album was made from this music and signed copies can be purchased from the artists&#x27; website.

The soundtrack in &quot;MediEvil: Resurrection&quot; is orchestrated, unlike the first installment. Approximately half of the themes from the original were removed while new themes were created to fit with the new levels. The music is split into two halves; the cues from the first half are largely reminiscent of a select number of cues from the original game with the addition of extra thematic elements to strengthen them. The other half of the music is original and composed exclusively for &quot;Resurrection&quot;. The new soundtrack was composed by Bob &amp; Barn and features performances from members of the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra that was recorded in the Czech Republic. The orchestra, headed by Nic Raine, consisted of approximately 80 performers and in addition benefits from a 32 piece choir, also recorded in the same venue. This was in similar vain to SCE Studio Cambridge&#x27;s previous orchestral game &quot;Primal&quot;, which was also recorded in Prague by the same performers.

==Reception==

Overall, the &quot;MediEvil&quot; series has received positive to mixed reviews from critics. &quot;MediEvil&quot; and &quot;MediEvil 2&quot; were mostly praised upon release, with the atmosphere, visuals and music of both games being the prominently commended aspects. Chris Roper of IGN praised the game&#x27;s sense of humour and unique presentation, but was sceptical concerning the game&#x27;s &quot;sloppy&quot; controls, &quot;disjointed&quot; level designs and noted that the game&#x27;s graphics did not age well over time, in comparison to the graphically superior PSP remake. Joe Fielder of GameSpot credited the first &quot;MediEvil&quot; for its original look and number of unique puzzles, but criticised the camera work. Reviewing &quot;MediEvil 2&quot;, Doug Perry of IGN praised the graphical advancements of the game, noticing that the sharper detail brings out a more &quot;sophisticated feel&quot; to the story and the new addition of cutscenes create a better sense of continuity and story. Shawn Sparks of Game Revolution similarly praised the improved graphics of the second game, noting that smooth frame rate and sharper graphics brought out the original PlayStation&#x27;s power despite nearing the end of its lifespan. At the 2000 BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards, &quot;MediEvil 2&quot; won the best console game category.

&quot;MediEvil: Resurrection&quot; received largely mixed reviews from critics upon release. General criticisms of the game were directed at the camera controls, combat sequences, and occasional frame rate drops. Both Kristan Reed of Eurogamer and Jason Allen of IGN expressed concern over the camera work, stating that the camera was &quot;sloppy&quot; and that it proved particularly difficult during combat. However, the graphics and celebrity voice talent were praised; especially Tom Baker&#x27;s role as the narrator and Grim Reaper. Greg Mueller of GameSpot praised the soundtrack and dialogue, with Reed citing that Baker&#x27;s voice performance was &quot;majestic&quot; and &quot;eccentric&quot;. &quot;MediEvil&quot; creators Chris Sorrell and Jason Wilson expressed disappointment with the game, with Wilson stating that he felt disheartened with having to watch something he &quot;cherished&quot; to be altered with decisions he thought were &quot;questionable&quot;. Sorrell felt similar disappointment in the redesign of the game and there were a number of aspects of it that he disagreed with.

==Other media==
A graphic novel written by original co-creators Chris Sorrell and Jay Gunn, titled &quot;MediEvil: Fate&#x27;s Arrow&quot;, was released by Titan Comics on 29 October 2019 to coincide with the release of the PS4 remake. The story picks up after the events of &quot;MediEvil 2&quot; and sees Fortesque travel back in time to before the events of the first game. The series is referenced in the PlayStation 5 launch title &quot;Astro&#x27;s Playroom&quot;.

The series is a melodrama about life in the Soviet Union during the Khrushchev Thaw, specifically about film artists of the age. Relational is that Todorovsky&#x27;s father worked on film in roughly this era. In the West the series has been compared to &quot;Mad Men&quot; in terms of tone and visuals, though the subject and plots are quite different.

<text>The Sukhoi Su-9 (ASCC reporting name: Fishpot) is a single-engine, all-weather, missile-armed interceptor aircraft developed by the Soviet Union.

==Development==

The Su-9 emerged from aerodynamic studies by TsAGI, the Soviet aerodynamic center, during the Korean War, which devised several optimum aerodynamic configurations for jet fighters. The design first flew in 1956 as the T-405 prototype. The Su-9 was developed at the same time as the Su-7 &quot;Fitter&quot;, and the West first saw both at the Tushino Aviation Day on June 24, 1956, where the Su-9 was dubbed Fitter-B. It entered service in 1959.

The total production of the Su-9 was about 1,100 aircraft. It is believed that at least some Su-9s were upgraded to Su-11 &quot;Fishpot-C&quot; form. None were exported to any of the USSR&#x27;s client states nor to the Warsaw Pact nations. The remaining Su-9s and later Su-11s were retired during the 1970s. Some were retained as test vehicles or converted to remote-piloted vehicles for use as unmanned aerial vehicles. It was replaced by the upgraded Su-11 and the much-superior Su-15 &quot;Flagon&quot; and MiG-25 &quot;Foxbat&quot;.

The combat record of the &quot;Fishpot&quot; is poorly documented. It is possible that it was involved in the interception (or even shoot-down) of reconnaissance missions, but no information has been publicly declassified.

Being an interceptor, the Su-9 was used in routine patrols and interdictions over the Soviet Frontiers. The most widely known involved in the interception of Francis Gary Powers&#x27; U-2 on Soviet territory on May 1, 1960. The Su-9 was unarmed and was directed to ram the U-2. One ramming attempt was made, but the Su-9 missed the U-2 due to the significant difference in the speed of the two planes. Due to the Su-9&#x27;s lack of fuel, the pilot elected to break away from the U-2 and continue with the original flight plan.
Its pilot, Captain Igor Mentyukov, later claimed that his slipstream caused the U-2 to break apart. He discounts the official version that the U-2 was shot down by an SA-2 missile, explaining that Powers could not have survived such a hit.

On September 4, 1959 a modified Su-9 (designated T-431 by the bureau) piloted by Vladimir Sergeievitch Ilyushin set a new world record for absolute height, at 28,852 m (94,658 ft). In November of the same year, Ilyushin set several new sustained speed/altitude records in the same aircraft. This record was later broken on December 6, 1959, by Commander Lawrence E. Flint Jr., who performed a zoom climb to a world record of 98,557 feet (30,040 meters) while piloting an F4H-1 Phantom.

Bobrovka became the Soviet Union&#x27;s primary storage facility for the Su-9 as it was phased out, and by 1981 at least 243 Su-9 aircraft were observed parked at Bobrovka.

==Design==

The Su-9&#x27;s fuselage and tail surfaces resembled those of the Su-7, but unlike the swept wing of that aircraft, the &quot;Fishpot&quot; used a 53° delta wing with conventional slab tailplanes. It shared Sukhoi features like the rear-fuselage air brakes as well as the Su-7&#x27;s Lyulka AL-7 turbojet engine and nose intake. The translating shock cone contains the radar set.

The Su-9 was developed from earlier work on a developmental aircraft designated T-3, to which the Su-9 was nearly identical. Internally at Sukhoi, the Su-9 was known as the T-43.

The delta wing of the Su-9 was adopted because of its lower drag in the supersonic flight regime. Its greater volume also allowed a modest fuel capacity increase compared to the Su-7. The Su-9 was capable of Mach 1.8 at altitude or about Mach 1.14 with missiles. However, its fuel fraction remained minimal, and its operational radius was limited. Furthermore, rotation speeds were even higher than the Su-7, which was already high at 360  km/h (225  mph). Unlike the Su-7, which had cumbersome controls but docile handling characteristics, the &quot;Fishpot&quot; had light and responsive controls but was unforgiving of pilot error.

The Su-9 had primitive R1L (NATO reporting name &quot;High Fix&quot;) radar in the shock cone and was armed with four K-5 (AA-1 &quot;Alkali&quot;) beam-riding air-to-air missiles. Like all beam-riders, the K-5 was so limited as to be nearly useless for air-to-air combat. Unlike the Su-7 and later Su-15, Su-9 carried no cannon armament, although two fuselage pylons were reserved for the carriage of drop tanks.

A two-seat trainer version designated Su-9U was also produced in limited numbers (about 50 aircraft). It received the NATO reporting name &quot;Maiden.&quot; It had a full armament and radar system with displays in both cockpits, allowing trainees to practice all aspects of the interception mission. Still, because the second seat further reduced the already meager fuel fraction, it was not genuinely combat-capable.

The Su-9 has been frequently mistaken for the MiG-21 due to the many similarities in design. The primary distinguishing features are the Su-9&#x27;s size and its bubble canopy.

==Variants==
:Development of the Su-9.
;T-405
:Prototype model of the Su-9.
;Su-9
:Production variant, about 1,100 built.
;Su-9U
:Training variant, mounting the standard avionics suite without weapon systems or hardpoints. About 50 units were manufactured.
;T-431
:A specially modified Su-9 for setting the world record for absolute height in 1962.
;Sukhoi Su-11
:A upgraded design based on the Su-9. It was slightly lengthened compared to the Su-9. However, it was outmoded by the Sukhoi Su-15, which offered vastly increased range and aerodynamic performance.

<text>Rousham House (also known as Rousham Park) is a country house at Rousham in Oxfordshire, England. The house, which has been continuously in the ownership of one family, was built circa 1635 and remodelled by William Kent in the 18th century in a free Gothic style. Further alterations were carried out in the 19th century.

The celebrated gardens are open to the public every day; the house is open by appointment.

== History ==
In the 1630s Sir Robert Dormer bought the manor of Rousham. He immediately began construction of the present house but work was halted by the start of the English Civil War. The Dormers were a Royalist family and the house was attacked by Parliamentary soldiers.

In 1649 the estate was inherited by Robert Dormer&#x27;s son, also Robert. He left the house much as his father had created it, only repairing the damage of the Civil War. However, he did more to restore the family fortunes by marrying twice, each time to an heiress. His second wife was the daughter of Sir Charles Cottrell, a high-ranking courtier of Charles II.

Colonel Robert Dormer-Cottrell, the grandson of the house&#x27;s builder, inherited Rousham in 1719 and began the huge transformation of the gardens to its current appearance. Initially he employed Charles Bridgeman to lay out the gardens in the new and more naturalistic style that was becoming popular. Bridgeman&#x27;s layout of the garden was completed circa 1737. Rousham was then inherited by the Colonel&#x27;s brother, General James Dormer (1679–1741), who called in William Kent to further enhance and develop the garden that Bridgeman created. This Kent did with considerable success over the next four years.

On the death of James Dormer in 1741, unmarried and without issue, the estate passed to his first cousin Sir Clement Cottrell-Dormer(1686–1758) (the son of his aunt Anne Cottrell) who added the surname Dormer to his patronymic. At this time Kent also embellished the house itself, with crenellations and two wings containing a drawing room and a &quot;delightful&quot; library, according to Horace Walpole who said of Rousham in 1760 &quot;it reinstated Kent with me; he has no where shewn so much taste&quot;. The interiors were altered a century later but the hall, the principal room of the house, has survived alteration by successive generations unchanged, and remains as completed in the 17th century. Kent&#x27;s exterior work is today almost as built, but in 1876 the original octagonal paned glazing was replaced with innovative large sheets of plate glass, during a heavy-handed restoration of the house by the architect James Piers St Aubyn. The house contains fine collections of Jacobean and 18th-century furniture, paintings and statuary, all displayed in a domestic setting.

The gardens, created by Bridgeman and then Kent, overlook a curve of the River Cherwell. Bridgeman had laid out the garden, with meandering walks through the woods, and pools of varying degrees of formality. Kent&#x27;s theme was to create and transform the naturalistic landscape created by Bridgeman by introducing &#x27;Augustan&#x27; traits to recall the glories and atmosphere of ancient Rome. Thus the Roman Forum was to be recreated in the verdant English countryside. &quot;The garden is Daphne in little&quot;, Walpole told George Montagu: &quot;the sweetest little groves, streams, glades, porticoes, cascades, and river, imaginable; all the scenes are perfectly classic.&quot;

== The house and garden today ==
Away and unseen from the house, Kent&#x27;s garden extends past classical temples, follies and statuary representing the spirit of that era, dying gladiators, a horse being savaged by a lion and other statues depicting similar themes. Paths lead through woods where the abundant water from the Cherwell is fully utilised: small rills lead to larger ponds and formal pools, classical statuary of Roman gods and mythological creatures are skilfully positioned to catch the eye as one progresses from a cascade to the cold bath and on to the next temple or arcade, each set in its own valley or glade, a succession of picturesque tableaux. The statues are by Peter Scheemakers.

Among the most revealing and thought-provoking of the follies is a grotto with a small cascade with the inscription: &quot;In Front of this Stone lie the Remains of Ringwood an otter-hound of extraordinary Sagacity&quot;: this shows that while the English squire who created this garden attempted to achieve Arcadia, his interests and loves remained hunting and hounds.The largest structure in the gardens is the Praeneste. Based on the Temple of Fortuna Primigenia in Palestrina, Italy, the Roman-style colonnade provides views across the Cherwell. A separate garden closer to the house evokes the spirit of the Tudor and Stuart eras of English gardening. Box-edged beds and borders of old roses and herbaceous plants are surrounded by walls of ancient red brick; here an historic circular dovecote still retains its doves and close by through a small gate is the parish church where generations of Cottrell-Dormers are buried. One memorial in the church commemorates three sons of the family killed in combat in the First World War.

The house and grounds have been used as filming locations for productions including ITV&#x27;s &quot;Lewis&quot; (episode &quot;The Dead of Winter&quot;) and BBC&#x27;s 2021 miniseries &quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot;. English horticulturist Monty Don considers Rousham his favourite garden in England.

Rousham House is still the home of the Cottrell-Dormer family.

<doc id="1038627" wikidata="Q1771733" url="?curid=1038627" title="Ocean escort">
<text>Ocean escort was a type of United States Navy warship. They were an evolution of the World War II destroyer escort types. The ocean escorts were intended as convoy escorts and were designed for mobilization production in wartime or low-cost mass production in peacetime. They were commissioned from 1954 through 1974, serving in the Cold War and the Vietnam War.

==Designation==
The ocean escorts&#x27; hull classification symbol was DE, a carryover from the World War II era when vessels of similar size and role were classified as destroyer escorts. DEs were ASW vessels; DEGs were ASW and AAW vessels with the short-range Tartar guided missile added. Ships similar or identical to the World War II destroyer escorts and the Cold War ocean escorts were called &quot;frigates&quot; in most other navies.

Outside the US Navy, no other navy appears to have used the ship type of &quot;ocean escort&quot;. The closest equivalents in type name are the Soviet and classes, built circa 1954–65. These classes&#x27; Russian designation of &quot;storozhevoi korabi&quot; translates to &quot;escort ship&quot;, &quot;sentry ship&quot;, or &quot;guard ship&quot;. These were smaller than any of the US ocean escorts, at 1,416 tons (&quot;Riga&quot;) and 1,150 tons (&quot;Petya&quot;) full load, compared with at 1,877 tons full load. Many USN ocean escorts were transferred to foreign navies following USN service; they received pennant numbers beginning with &quot;D&quot;, &quot;DE&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, or (in the Mexican Navy) &quot;E&quot;. The &quot;E&quot; designator was also used for ex-USN s in that navy.

==Ocean escort classes==
* (13) 
* (4) 
* (2) 
* (11) 
* (6) (DEG)
* (46) 
* (82) total

==1975 reclassification==
The ocean escort type corresponded to other nations&#x27; frigates (convoy escorts). Until 1975, the US Navy used the term &quot;frigate&quot; for destroyer leaders (DL, DLG, DLGN).

The 1975 ship reclassification changed the ocean escorts (DE/DEG) to frigates (FF/FFG) to be in line with other nations&#x27; classifications. The DLG-type &quot;frigates&quot; became either destroyers or cruisers, depending on tonnage.

<text>Peter Woodward (born 24 January 1956) is an English actor, screenwriter and stuntman. He is best known for his role as Galen in the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; spin-offs &quot;Babylon 5: A Call to Arms&quot;, &quot;Crusade&quot; and &quot;Babylon 5: The Lost Tales&quot;. He is also known for his role as British Army Brigadier General Charles O&#x27;Hara in &quot;The Patriot&quot;.
==Early life and education==
Woodward was born in London, the second son of actors Venetia Mary Collett (also known as Venetia Barrett) and Edward Woodward. His siblings Tim and Sarah are also actors. He was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College before attending the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA).

==Career==
===Actor===
After graduation, he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, starring in many of their productions including &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Woodward has also played a wide range of major character roles in films and television including the role of the German Captain Stossel in the feature film &quot;The Brylcreem Boys&quot;. Woodward voiced the role of Edwin Carbunkle the main villain in the 3D Computer animation children&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Postman Pat: The Movie&quot;.

====&quot;Crusade&quot;====
As the Techno Mage Galen in the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; spin-off &quot;Crusade&quot;, Woodward played opposite his father in the episode &quot;The Long Road.&quot; In the episode, the Excalibur visits a planet that may contain a potent anti-viral agent in its minerals. Earth agencies are strip-mining the planet. Edward Woodward played Alwyn, a rogue Techno Mage living on the planet with its inhabitants who was a friend of Galen&#x27;s former teacher.

===Fight arranger &amp; &quot;Conquest&quot;===
As a former member of the British Academy of Dramatic Combat, Woodward is known in the film industry for his work as a fight arranger. Woodward&#x27;s dramatic combat training inspired him to study historical weaponry and combat techniques. This interest ultimately led him to create, co-write, and host The History Channel&#x27;s documentary series &quot;Conquest&quot;, a hands-on showcase of weapons, training and combat techniques throughout history. The series ran from 2002 to 2003.

===Writer===
Woodward has also worked as a post-production supervisor, writing the additional dialogue recording for films including: &quot;Columbus – 1492&quot;, &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot;, &quot;The Scarlet Tunic&quot;, &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and &quot;Dangerous Obsessions&quot; (1998).

Branching out in the late 1990s, Woodward and his father formed Tripal Productions, for which he wrote and produced his first feature film &quot;The House of Angelo&quot;, directed by Jim Goddard in 1997 with his father in the starring role as &quot;Angelo&quot;. Woodward also wrote the feature film &quot;Closing the Ring&quot;, which was directed by Richard Attenborough.

<doc id="1038631" wikidata="Q2825573" url="?curid=1038631" title="Aereon III">
<text>The AEREON III was an experimental hybrid airship of rigid construction built by the AEREON Corporation in the early 1960s. Of unconventional design, the airship featured three gas envelopes attached side-by-side, with the connecting structures shaped as airfoils to create extra lift as the craft moved forward. Intended as a small prototype craft that would precede the development of much larger hybrid airships, the &quot;AEREON III&quot; was constructed between 1959 and 1965 but was destroyed during taxiing tests in 1966 and scrapped without having flown. It was &quot;the first rigid airship to be built since &quot;Graf Zeppelin II&quot;&quot;.

==Background==

The AEREON Corporation had been founded in 1959 by Presbyterian minister and U.S. Naval Reserve chaplain turned airship enthusiast Monroe Drew and Navy airship veteran Lieutenant Commander John Fitzpatrick. The organization was named in honor of Solomon Andrews&#x27;s 1863 airship &quot;Aereon&quot;, a three-hulled craft—like &quot;AEREON III&quot;—that could make forward progress without an engine by alternately dropping ballast and valving hydrogen. (&quot;Aereon II&quot; was Andrews&#x27;s second airship, a single-hulled craft.)

&quot;AEREON III&quot; was designed by Fitzpatrick and constructed between 1959 and 1965 at Mercer County Airport in Trenton, New Jersey. The construction work was carried out by Everett Linkenhoker, an airship rigger hired on the recommendation of Aereon&#x27;s consultant, the distinguished airship aviator and retired U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Charles Rosendahl.

Future versions of the airship were envisaged as being up to long, possibly with nuclear propulsion. Even &quot;thousand-foot automated Aereons moving in connected trains through the lower atmosphere&quot; were foreseen by some of those involved.

==Description==

===Configuration===
The AEREON III comprised three rigid hulls, each in length and in maximum diameter, connected by truss members. The connecting structures between the hulls were faired in an airfoil section, and the aircraft as a whole functioned as an airfoil with an aspect ratio of 0.74. The design was intended to &quot;maximize the dynamic lifting forces acting on the airship hull and to take the fullest advantage of these forces in flight.&quot; Each hull contained six gas cells, for a total lifting gas volume of . There were ventral fins with rudders at the aft ends of the outer two hulls and elevons on the trailing edges of the connecting structures. The two-seat cockpit was located in the nose of the central hull.

===Structure and materials===
The hulls had a Zeppelin-type structure comprising seven 20-sided main rings, three intermediate rings between each pair of main rings, and wire bracing; however, the structural members were of Duralumin tubing, rather than the built-up girders of earlier rigids. The structure was described as &quot;half as heavy and twice as strong as the structural material in the ill-fated &quot;Hindenburg&quot;.&quot; The hulls were enclosed by a double-layer outer cover, comprising an outer Tedlar layer and an inner layer of ripstop nylon treated with dope. The gas cells were also made of Tedlar. The fins were of sheet Duralumin on frames of the same material, joined primarily with epoxy resin rather than by riveting.

===Landing gear===
The airship had a tricycle undercarriage with a non-steerable nosewheel beneath the central hull and steerable (via a connection with the rudders) wheels at the tips of the ventral fins at the aft ends of the outer hulls. The nosewheel functioned as an &quot;internal mooring mast,&quot; with a telescopic strut that allowed the ship&#x27;s angle of attack to be varied while moored (e.g. nose down to hug the ground or nose up in preparation for takeoff) and a tie-down fitting at its lower end.

===Propulsion===
The &quot;AEREON III&quot; was powered by a single engine located at the aft end of the central hull. This engine was reported in 1962 as being a Solar Titan gas turbine of , but the engine eventually installed was described as a &quot;four-cylinder McCullough&quot; (sic—presumably McCulloch). The engine drove a diameter, two-bladed pusher propeller (actually a helicopter rotor rotating in the vertical plane). The location of the propeller at the aft end of the hull was stated to assist in boundary layer control and its cyclic pitch feature to facilitate low-speed control. AEREON patented this propulsion and control system in 1966. However, the propeller required shortening before trials commenced because of its &quot;greatly excessive vibration.&quot;

===Buoyancy control===
Five propane burners in each hull enabled the helium to be heated to increase lift; the ship would be about heavy (i.e. weight greater than static lift) with the gas cells 83 percent filled with helium, but heating the gas would increase the static lift by . The helium could also be cooled by admitting air through vents in the noses of the hulls, with the assistance of blowers. The double-layer outer cover, mentioned above, facilitated thermal insulation of the gas cells. AEREON also patented the pressurization and buoyancy-control system, in 1965. 
One source states that the &quot;AEREON III&quot;&#x27;s buoyancy-control capabilities would allow it to fly using &quot;gravity propulsion&quot;—without the assistance of an engine—along the lines of Solomon Andrews&#x27;s original &quot;Aereon&quot; but substituting helium heating for Andrews&#x27;s dropping of ballast and helium cooling for his valving of hydrogen. However, Fitzpatrick is quoted elsewhere as &quot;deplor[ing] such exaggerations.&quot;

==Specifications==
==Destruction==
On April 15, 1966, the &quot;AEREON III&quot; was taxiing on a runway at Mercer County Airport in a crosswind when it failed to slow down, tried to turn at the end of the runway, and tilted over onto two wheels. One of the pilots jumped from the cockpit, and the airship then turned flat on its back. The second pilot then jumped straight down from the inverted cockpit, and the airship overturned a second time. According to John McPhee&#x27;s book &quot;The Deltoid Pumpkin Seed&quot;, the remains of the &quot;AEREON III&quot; were &quot;virtually bulldozed back into the hangar, arriving more or less in flakes.&quot; However, another source states that reconstruction into a new, larger &quot;AEREON IIIB&quot; was contemplated. This craft would have been long and in span, with a &quot;metal-clad, partially delta&quot; shape. According to this source, the damaged &quot;AEREON III&quot; was eventually broken up &quot;sometime in 1967.&quot;

The &quot;AEREON III&quot; was succeeded by the &quot;AEREON 26&quot;, which had an entirely different, deltoid shape. The new aircraft inherited its predecessor&#x27;s McCulloch engine, along with aluminum tubing from the structure of &quot;AEREON III&quot; and several of its instruments. One of the nosecones from &quot;AEREON III&quot; is reportedly in the Lighter-than-Air Society&#x27;s collection in Akron, Ohio.

<text>The Intelligence Directorate (), commonly known as G2 and, until 1989, named Dirección General de Inteligencia (DGI), is the main state intelligence agency of the government of Cuba. The DI was founded in late 1961 by Cuba&#x27;s Ministry of the Interior shortly after the Cuban Revolution. The DI is responsible for all foreign intelligence collection and comprises six divisions divided into two categories, which are the Operational Divisions and the Support Divisions. 

Manuel &quot;Redbeard&quot; Piñeiro was the first director of the DI in 1961, and his term lasted until 1964. Another top leader who directed the famous office, located on Linea and A, Vedado, was the now retired Div. General, Jesús Bermúdez Cutiño. He was transferred from being the chief of the Army Intelligence (DIM) to the Ministry of Interior after the corruption trials and executions of Arnaldo Ochoa and José Abrantes Fernández in 1989. The current head of the DI is Brig. Gen. Eduardo Delgado Rodríguez. 

The total number of people working for the DI is about 15,000. Given Cuba&#x27;s small size, the DI is considered to be an especially effective agency which &quot;punches above its weight&quot; in espionage operations, according to &quot;The Economist&quot;.

== Recruiting techniques ==
New recruits do research within the ministry, mostly on counterintelligence fields (which has its own five-year career academy) and also, over regular college students, who are recruited around the second year on their programs. Those students mostly study languages, history, communications, and sociology. Once they get their diplomas, they undergo several months of official intelligence training, and a year or so after, they receive the rank of lieutenant.

== KGB and StB relationship ==
The Soviet Union&#x27;s KGB and the Cuban DI had a complex relationship, marked by times of extremely close cooperation and by periods of extreme competition. The Soviet Union saw the new revolutionary government in Cuba as an excellent proxy agent in areas of the world where Soviet involvement lacked popular local-level support. Nikolai Leonov, the KGB chief in Mexico City, one of the first Soviet officials to recognize Fidel Castro&#x27;s potential as a revolutionary, urged the Soviet administration to strengthen ties with the new Cuban leader. Moscow saw Cuba as having far more appeal with new revolutionary movements, western intellectuals, and members of the New Left with Cuba&#x27;s perceived David and Goliath struggle against U.S. imperialism.

However, in the early 1960s, Czechoslovak intelligence (StB) had more intensive contacts with emerging Cuban DI than KGB. Czechoslovaks provided Cubans with intelligence reports, spy equipment, and training. Manuel Piñeiro was in regular contact with the StB station chief in Cuba and appreciated the quality of Czechoslovak intelligence reports that were important for sustaining the Cuban revolution in its early years. Cubans wanted to rely on the StB in building DI and the Ministry of Interior. However the Soviets soon stopped such initiatives. 

Czechoslovak intelligence cooperated with DI on top secret &quot;Operation Manuel&quot; which lasted from 1962 to 1969, moving 1179 Latin American revolutionaries via Prague back to Latin America. Czechoslovak intelligence helped DI to falsify the passports of Latin Americans who trained in Cuba to become guerrillas.

Shortly after the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, Moscow invited 1,500 DI agents, including Che Guevara, to the KGB&#x27;s Moscow Center for intensive training in intelligence operations.

Dismayed by Cuban debâcles in Zaire (1977 and 1978) and in Bolivia (1966–67) as well as by a perceived growing independence from Moscow, the Soviets sought a more active role in shaping the DI. In 1970 a team of KGB advisers led by Gen. Viktor Semyonov was sent to the DI to purge it of officers and agents considered anti-Soviet by the KGB. Manuel Piñeiro, becoming increasingly upset at the co-option of the DI by the Soviets, was removed during the 1970 purge and replaced with the pro-Soviet José Méndez Cominches as head of the DI.

Semyonov also took this opportunity to oversee a rapid expansion of the DI&#x27;s &quot;western&quot; operations. By 1971, 70 percent of the Cuban diplomats in London were actually DI agents and proved invaluable to Moscow after the British government&#x27;s mass expulsion of Soviet intelligence officers.

In 1962 the Soviet Union opened its largest foreign SIGINT site in Lourdes, Cuba, approximately from Havana. The Intelligence Resource Program of the Federation of American Scientists stated in 2001 that the Lourdes facility was reported to cover a 28 square-mile (73 km2) area, with 1,000 to 1,500 Soviet and later solely Russian engineers, technicians, and military personnel working at the base. Those familiar with the Lourdes facility confirmed that the base has multiple groups of tracking dishes and its own satellite system, with some groups used to intercept telephone calls, faxes, and computer communications in general, and with other groups used to cover targeted telephones and devices. In 2001, the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, announced that the facility would be shut down.

The Soviets also collaborated with the DI to assist Central Intelligence Agency defector Philip Agee in the publication of the &quot;Covert Action Information Bulletin&quot;.

== Operations abroad ==
Throughout its 40-year history the DI has been actively involved in aiding leftist movements, primarily in Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. 

There have also been allegations that Cuban DI agents interrogated U.S. POWs held at the Cu Loc POW camp in North Vietnam.

=== Chile ===
Shortly after the election of Salvador Allende as president of Chile in November 1970, the DI worked extremely closely to strengthen Allende&#x27;s increasingly precarious position. The Cuban DI station chief Luis Fernández Oña married Allende&#x27;s daughter Beatriz, who later committed suicide in Cuba.

=== Grenada ===
Shortly after a popular bloodless coup in Grenada, led by Maurice Bishop, the Cuban DI sent advisers to the island nation to assist the new government. The DI was also instrumental in persuading the Soviet Union to aid Grenada, aid that Grenadian general Hudson Austin called essential to the success of the Caribbean anti-imperialist movement. The DI coordinated 780 Cuban engineers and intelligence operatives.

=== Nicaragua ===
Beginning in 1967 the DI had begun to establish ties with various Nicaraguan revolutionary organizations. The Soviets were upset at what they saw as Cuba upstaging the KGB in Nicaragua. By 1970 the DI had managed to train hundreds of Sandinista guerrilla leaders and had vast influence over the organization. In 1969 the DI had financed and organized an operation to free the jailed Sandinistan leader Carlos Fonseca from his prison in Costa Rica. Fonseca was captured shortly after the jail break, but after a plane carrying executives from the United Fruit Company was hijacked by the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), he was freed and allowed to travel to Cuba.

DI chief Manuel Piñeiro commented that &quot;of all the countries in Latin America, the most active work being carried out by us is in Nicaragua.&quot;

The DI, with Fidel Castro&#x27;s personal blessing, also collaborated with the FSLN on the botched assassination attempt of Turner B. Shelton, the U.S. ambassador in Managua and a close friend to the Somoza family. The FSLN managed to secure several hostages, exchanging them for safe passage to Cuba and a $1 million ransom. After the successful ousting of Anastasio Somoza, DI involvement in the new Sandinista government expanded rapidly. An early indication of the central role that the DI would play in the Cuban–Nicaraguan relationship a meeting in Havana on 27 July 1979, at which diplomatic ties between the two countries were re-established after over 25 years. Julián López Díaz, a prominent DI agent, was named ambassador to Nicaragua.

Cuban military and DI advisers initially brought in during the Sandinistan insurgency, would swell to over 2,500 and operated at all levels of the new Nicaraguan government. Sandinista defector Álvaro Baldizón confirmed that Cuban influence in Nicaragua&#x27;s Interior Ministry (MINT) was more extensive than was widely believed at the time, and Cuban &quot;advice&quot; and &quot;observations&quot; were treated as though they were orders.

=== Puerto Rico ===
The DI sought to aid the growing Puerto Rican separatist movement. Dr. Daniel James testified before a U.S. Senate subcommittee that the DGI, working through Filiberto Ojeda Ríos, organized and trained the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional Puertorriqueña (FALN) in 1974. 

In October 1974, Ojeda was arrested and charged with terrorist acts against American hotels in Puerto Rico. Authorities found a substantial amount of Cuban government documents and secret codes in his possession. Shortly after his release on bail he disappeared but was credited with the 1979 unification of Puerto Rico&#x27;s five principal terrorist groups into the Cuban-directed National Revolutionary Command (CRN). According to the former chief investigator of the U.S. Senate, Alfonso Tarabochia, the DGI began directing criminal activities in Puerto Rico and the eastern and midwestern United States as early as 1974. That June the secretary general of the Puerto Rican Socialist Party, Juan Marí Bras, met in Havana with Fidel Castro to consolidate party solidarity.

Beginning in September 1974, the incidence of bombings by Puerto Rican extremists, particularly the FALN, escalated sharply. Targets included U.S. companies and public places. The FALN was responsible for a bombing that killed four and wounded dozens at the historic Fraunces Tavern in lower Manhattan on January 25, 1975. Later that year, Fidel Castro sponsored the First World Solidarity Conference for the Independence of Puerto Rico in Havana.

Ríos was killed by the FBI on Friday, September 23, 2005, in the town of Hormigueros, Puerto Rico.

== Camp Matanzas ==
Camp Matanzas is a training facility operated by the DI and is located outside Havana since early 1962. It has hosted the likes of Carlos the Jackal.

<text>Snottite, also snoticle, is a microbial mat of single-celled extremophilic bacteria which hang from the walls and ceilings of caves and are similar to small stalactites, but have the consistency of nasal mucus. In the Frasassi Caves in Italy, over 70% of cells in Snottite have been identified as &quot;Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans&quot;, with smaller populations including an archaeon in the uncultivated &#x27;G-plasma&#x27; clade of Thermoplasmatales (&gt;15%) and a bacterium in the Acidimicrobiaceae family (&gt;5%).

The bacteria derive their energy from chemosynthesis of volcanic sulfur compounds including H2S and warm-water solution dripping down from above, producing sulfuric acid. Because of this, their waste products are highly acidic (approaching pH=0), with similar properties to battery acid. Researchers at the University of Texas have suggested that this sulfuric acid may be a more significant cause of cave formation than the usual explanation offered of the carbonic acid formed from carbon dioxide dissolved in water.

Snottites were brought to attention by researchers Diana Northup and Penny Boston studying them (and other organisms) in a toxic sulfur cave called Cueva de Villa Luz (&quot;Cave of the Lighted House&quot;), in Tabasco, Mexico. Snottites were first discovered in this cave by Jim Pisarowicz in 1986, who also coined the term.

The BBC series &quot;Wonders of the Solar System&quot; saw Professor Brian Cox examining snottites and positing that if there is life on Mars, it may be similarly primitive and hidden beneath the surface of the Red Planet.

<doc id="1038639" wikidata="Q312614" url="?curid=1038639" title="Alessandro Petacchi">
<text>Alessandro Petacchi (born 3 January 1974) is an Italian former professional road racing cyclist, who rode professionally between 1996 and 2015. A specialist sprinter, Petacchi has won 48 grand tour stages with wins of the points jersey in the Giro d&#x27;Italia in 2004, the Vuelta a España in 2005 and the Tour de France in 2010. He also won the classics Milan – San Remo in 2005 and Paris–Tours in 2007. His career spanned over 18 years during which he earned 183 victories.

In 2007, Petacchi was banned from cycling and had his results achieved disqualified for doping. The court later said that he had not cheated on purpose but had not taken enough care when consuming his legal asthma drug. He announced his retirement as a lead sprinter on 23 April 2013, and terminated his contract at . He rejoined the professional peloton in August 2013, joining the squad as a lead-out man. In 2015, he joined the Southeast team, where he retired from cycling for good after that year&#x27;s Giro d&#x27;Italia.

==Career==
===1996–1999: The early years===
Born in La Spezia, Liguria, Petacchi turned professional in 1996 with . In the early years he won small races – most notably a stage in Tour de Langkawi in 1998 and the mountains classification in the same race the year after. Petacchi rode his first Grand Tour at the Vuelta a España in 1997, where his best finish was 6th on stage 2. He rode his first Giro in 1998, where he recorded his best finish with an impressive fourth on stage 3 and several other top 10 finishes during the race. He later retired from the race on stage 18.

In 2000, Petacchi signed for Fassa Bortolo. He got his breakthrough, when he won his first Grand Tour stage in Vuelta a España on stage 7 in a sprint where he beat Giovanni Lombardi in a bunch sprint. He was initially assigned as Fabio Baldato&#x27;s lead-out man at that year&#x27;s Vuelta. He won another stage later in stage 11. He ended the year with nine victories.

2001 became a mediocre year for Petacchi in difference to 2000. He decided to go to the Tour for the first time in his career, where he recorded several top 10 finishes and fourth in the points classification.

Petacchi got a great start to his 2002 campaign, when he won a stage in Tour Méditerranéen and two stages in Paris–Nice, where he also wore the leader jersey for two days. He came very close on winning a stage several times during the Giro d&#x27;Italia, where he got two second places and one third place. On the last stage he lost to Mario Cipollini. He came to the Vuelta with ambitions to win some stages and the points classification, where he also won a stage, but ultimately became second in the points classification beaten by Erik Zabel. He ended the year by being a part of the winning Italian lead-out train for Cipollini in the Road World Championship in Zolder.

===2003–2007: Domination in the sprints===
Petacchi started the season strongly by winning Trofeo Luis Puig and a stage in both Vuelta Ciclista a la Comunidad Valenciana and Paris–Nice. He continued his form going into the Giro. He won his first Giro stage on the first stage, beating the world champion Mario Cipollini in a head-to-head sprint. The stage win also gave Petacchi the maglia rosa. He wore the leader jersey in 5 days and was in all those days inside top 5 in every single stage and won two stages more in the process. He lost the jersey on the first mountain stage in stage 7. He later won three more stages in the race, bringing his Giro stage wins up to 6 stage wins, before leaving the race due to being outside the time limit on stage 18. He then rode Tour de France, where he won 4 stages – three stages in a row, before retiring on stage 7. He wore the green jersey, when he retired. After riding the Eneco Tour, he decided to ride the Vuelta. He won five stages and became the third rider ever, who have won a stage at each Grand Tour in a single year. He finished the season with 24 victories.

Petacchi started his 2004 season with three stage wins in Tirreno–Adriatico and a fourth-place finish in Milan–San Remo. Then he arrived to the Giro and won a record nine stages, the points classification and the Azzurri d&#x27;Italia classification. He attempted to recreate his 2003 season by participate in the Tour, however it became a disappointment and dropped out on stage 6 due to injuries. He bounced back in the Vuelta by winning four stages. 

Petacchi started his 2005 season early by winning GP Costa Degli Etruschi and several stages of Vuelta an Andalucia. He then won three stages of Tirreno–Adriatico and finished 2nd in the general classification. He continued his great form by winning Milano-San Remo. He had the better of a mass sprint, beating Danilo Hondo, Thor Hushovd, Stuart O&#x27;Grady and Óscar Freire. He later won four stages of the Giro and five stages and the points classification of the Vuelta.
In July 2005, Petacchi announced that, following the decision to disband , he would join for the 2006 season. In August, sprinter rival Erik Zabel also joined the team, which fused with to become .

His explosive speed won him stages in all three of the Grand Tours. He withdrew from the 2006 Giro d&#x27;Italia after crashing during the third stage. He had finished the stage with a broken kneecap. It was the first time that Petacchi did not win a stage in the Giro since 2002.

In 2007, he won five stages in the Giro d&#x27;Italia, bringing his tally of ProTour victories to 21 and making him the rider with most UCI ProTour victories. During that season, he registered a success of prestige in Paris–Tours. With support from his teammate Erik Zabel, Petacchi was the victor in the mass gallop, with Francesco Chicchi and Óscar Freire rounding up the podium.

==Doping allegations==
After he returned an &quot;Adverse Analytical Finding&quot; (AAF), a higher level than officially allowed of the asthma medication salbutamol, which Petacchi had clearance to use, he was placed on non-active status and missed the 2007 Tour de France. Petacchi was absolved when the Italian Cycling Federation ruled that overuse of Salbutamol was human error.

On 6 May 2008, the World Anti-Doping Agency won its challenge against the Italian national governing body at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Petacchi was banned from 1 November 2007 to 31 August 2008, and &quot;all competitive results obtained during the 2007 Giro d&#x27;Italia shall be disqualified with all of the resulting consequences including forfeiture of any medals, points and prizes&quot;, including five Giro d&#x27;Italia stage wins. The court said Petacchi had not intended to cheat and that it was likely that he had inadvertently consumed too much medication, but he had not exercised &quot;utmost caution.&quot; The case was considered controversial, as it kept Petacchi from starting the Tour de France as he had planned and for the court ruling that he should be suspended despite acknowledging that he had not cheated. Petacchi maintained that he had done no wrong.

As a result of this, on 16 May 2008, Petacchi was fired by . After his suspension he joined .

==LPR Brakes and beyond==
After winning a few minor races in 2008, Petacchi started 2009 strongly by winning the Scheldeprijs Vlaanderen semi-classic race. 
He was selected to ride the Giro d&#x27;Italia and won the second and third stages, wearing the pink jersey on stage 3 and the cyclamen jersey on stages 2 through 5.

Petacchi signed with for the 2010 season. Petacchi won that year the first and fourth stages of the Tour de France – his first stage wins in the race since 2003. Before going on to complete the grand slam as he won the green sprinters jersey to complete the feat at all the grand tours. In so doing he was the 1st person to complete the feat since 1999 and the first Italian to win the points classification in the Tour de France since 1968.

He announced his retirement after the 2013 Paris–Roubaix, citing a lack of motivation to continue as a lead sprinter. However he subsequently expressed a desire to take up an offer from the Omega Pharma–Quick-Step team to ride as a lead-out man for Mark Cavendish, which he said was made to him days after his retirement. The contract offer was blocked by the UCI as it forbids riders from transferring from one team to another mid-season. In July 2013 Patrick Lefevere announced that Petacchi would be joining Omega Pharma–Quick-Step from the start of August on a 14-month contract. On 12 April 2014 he got his first victory for his new team at Grand Prix Pino Cerami and also his first victory since 2012. In January 2015 it emerged that Petacchi would ride for in 2015. However, after racing in that year&#x27;s Giro at the age of 41 and being forced to withdraw from the race one day before its conclusion due to a virus, Petacchi announced his second retirement from the sport in June 2015.

==Second doping suspension==
On 14 May 2019, Petacchi was named by the French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; as an alleged client of doctor Mark Schmidt, who administered illegal blood transfusion for the purpose of performance enhancement to athletes in what has become known as &quot;Operation Aderlass&quot;. Petacchi denied the accusations, but was nevertheless provisionally suspended by the UCI. He subsequently stepped down from his role as commentator for Italian state television RAI. On 24 August 2019, the UCI gave Petacchi a two-year ban from competition for his involvement with Schmidt.

<text>Philippe René Gabriel Alliot (born 27 July 1954) is a French former racing driver and broadcaster, who competed in Formula One from to and from to . 

Born and raised in Voves, Alliot initially studied political science before dropping out of university to pursue his racing career. He competed at 116 Formula One Grands Prix across nine seasons for RAM, Ligier, Larrousse and McLaren. Alliot also competed intermittently in the World Sportscar Championship, winning three races from 21 starts and finishing third in the standings in 1991 and 1992 with Peugeot. He also entered 10 editions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, finishing third in , and .

==Early life and career==
Philippe René Gabriel Alliot was born on 27 July 1954 in Voves, Eure-et-Loir, France. Alliot initially enrolled as a political science student, before dropping out to pursue a racing career at the Motul Racing School at the Circuit de Nogaro.

Prior to his career in Formula One he competed during 1976 and 1977 in Formule Renault, and won the championship in 1978, in the BP Racing team. With said team he also won the French Formula Renault championship and went on to French Formula Three. He finished third in his first race and moved to the European Formula 3 Championship in 1980. By 1983 he moved to Formula Two but hit the headlines that year when he finished third in the Le Mans 24 Hours with Michael and Mario Andretti in a Kremer Porsche.

==Formula One==

In 1984 Alliot joined the Skoal Bandit RAM F1 team, but did not enjoy much in the way of success. After Jacques Laffite was injured at the 1986 British Grand Prix, Alliot took his place at Ligier, where he showed an improvement. He moved to Larrousse for 1987, but returned to Ligier in 1990, gaining a reputation for accidents. He has the record of most race starts without any lead lap finish.

==Sportscars==
Alliot left F1 for sports car racing in the early 1990s and enjoyed considerable success with the Peugeot team, run by Jean Todt. This included third-place finishes at the 1992 and 1993 24 Hours of Le Mans.

==Return to Formula One==
Alliot made another attempt at F1 with Larrousse in , achieving the best finish of his F1 career, fifth, at the San Marino Grand Prix. For , Alliot was actually out of a drive in Formula One until Peugeot insisted that McLaren, who they were supplying V10 engines for, take him on as a test/reserve driver (largely against the wishes of team boss Ron Dennis who only relented because of Peugeot&#x27;s insistence). This role led to a race at the 1994 Hungarian Grand Prix for the team as a replacement for Mika Häkkinen, while he was suspended. Qualifying 14th, he retired from the race itself. Alliot then replaced Olivier Beretta at Larrousse for the following race, the Belgian Grand Prix. Starting from 19th on the grid, he retired with engine failure and this proved to be his last race in F1. Alliot left Formula One as the driver with the most race starts who had never achieved at least one of a podium finish, a pole position, or a fastest lap.

==Later life==
After announcing his retirement from Formula One in 1995, he decided to try a career in politics, also did some TV commentary and competed in ice racing and the Paris–Dakar Rally, but ended running his own GT racing team.

<doc id="1038661" wikidata="Q5423824" url="?curid=1038661" title="F. B. Rogers Silver Co.">
<text>F. B. Rogers Silver Co. was a silversmithing company founded in Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts in 1883. It was acquired by Edmund W. Porter and L.B. West, who incorporated the company and moved manufacturing operations to Taunton, Massachusetts in 1886. For several years, the company was known as West Silver Company, and produced silver products for the William Rogers Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut.

 About 1904, West and Porter retired and sold the company to William Davison, Carleton A. Woodward and H.E. Nearing, who changed the company&#x27;s name back to F.B. Rogers.

In 1925 the company moved from 31 Winthrop Street to 59 Wales Street. In 1943 it moved to West Water Street, to a site formerly occupied by the Weir Stove Company, who produced Glenwood Ranges.

In 1955, it became a division of the National Silver Company.

The company used many different marks over the years. One of them is a crown with the number 18 at the left and 83 at the right (for 1883).

In 2009 the 414 West Water Street property was demolished.

<doc id="1038665" wikidata="Q2147056" url="?curid=1038665" title="Tension-leg platform">
<text>A tension-leg platform (TLP) or extended tension leg platform (ETLP) is a vertically moored floating structure normally used for the offshore production of oil or gas, and is particularly suited for water depths greater than 300 metres (about 1000 ft) and less than 1500 metres (about 4900 ft). Use of tension-leg platforms has also been proposed for offshore wind turbines.

The platform is permanently moored by means of tethers or tendons grouped at each of the structure&#x27;s corners. A group of tethers is called a tension leg. A feature of the design of the tethers is that they have relatively high axial stiffness (low elasticity), such that virtually all vertical motion of the platform is eliminated. This allows the platform to have the production wellheads on deck (connected directly to the subsea wells by rigid risers), instead of on the seafloor. This allows a simpler well completion and gives better control over the production from the oil or gas reservoir, and easier access for downhole intervention operations.

TLPs have been in use since the early 1980s. The first tension leg platform was built for Conoco&#x27;s Hutton field in the North Sea in the early 1980s. The hull was built in the dry-dock at Highland Fabricator&#x27;s Nigg yard in the north of Scotland, with the deck section built nearby at McDermott&#x27;s yard at Ardersier. The two parts were mated in the Moray Firth in 1984.

The Hutton TLP was originally designed for a service life of 25 years in North Sea depth of 100 to 1000 metres. It had 16 tension legs. Its weight varied between 46,500 and 55,000 tons when moored to the seabed, but up to 61,580 tons when floating freely. The total area of its living quarters was about 3,500 square metres and accommodated over 100 cabins though only 40 people were necessary to maintain the structure in place.

The hull of the Hutton TLP has been separated from the topsides. Topsides have been redeployed to the Prirazlomnoye field in the Barents Sea, while the hull was reportedly sold to a project in the Gulf of Mexico (although the hull has been moored in Cromarty Firth since 2009).

Larger TLPs will normally have a full drilling rig on the platform with which to drill and intervene on the wells. The smaller TLPs may have a workover rig, or with most recent TLPs, production wellheads located at remote drillcentres subsea.

The deepest (E)TLPs measured from the sea floor to the surface are:
* Big Foot ETLP
* Magnolia ETLP. Its total height is some . 
* Marco Polo TLP
* Neptune TLP
* Kizomba A TLP
* Ursa TLP. Its height above surface is making a total height of .
* Allegheny TLP
* W. Seno A TLP

==Use for wind turbines==
Although the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory explored the concept of TLPs for offshore wind turbines in September 2006, architects had studied the idea as early as 2003. Earlier offshore wind turbines cost more to produce, stood on towers dug deep into the ocean floor, were only possible in depths of at most , and generated 1.5 megawatts for onshore units and 3.5 megawatts for conventional offshore setups. In contrast, TLP installation was calculated to cost a third as much. TLPs float, and researchers estimate they can operate in depths between 100 and and farther away from land, and they can generate 5.0 megawatts.

MIT and NREL researchers planned a half-scale prototype south of Cape Cod to prove the concept. Computer simulations project that in a hurricane TLPs would shift 0.9 m to 1.8 m and the turbine blades would cycle above wave peaks. Dampers could be used to reduce motion in the event of a natural disaster.

Blue H Technologies of the Netherlands deployed the world&#x27;s first floating wind turbine on a tension-leg platform, off the coast of Apulia, Italy in December 2007. The prototype was installed in waters deep in order to gather test data on wind and sea conditions, and was decommissioned at the end of 2008. The turbine utilized a tension-leg platform design and a two-bladed turbine. Seawind Ocean Technology B.V., which was established by Martin Jakubowski and Silvestro Caruso (the founders of Blue H Technologies), acquired the proprietary rights to the two-bladed floating turbine technology developed by Blue H Technologies.

== In literature ==
A fictitious tension-leg platform anchored in the Gulf of Mexico is at the centre of the plot of the novel Seawitch (1977) by Alistair MacLean. At the time of publication there were no commercially active TLPs, and the plot involves a conspiracy to destroy &quot;Seawitch&quot; by competing oil companies. The prologue to the novel explains the principles of operation.

<text>The South Plains is a region in northwest Texas, United States, consisting of 24 counties.

==Counties==
The South Plains region includes 24 counties:

The northernmost four (Parmer, Castro, Swisher, and Briscoe) also form part of the Texas Panhandle region.

The region consists of a portion of the Texas side of the geographical Llano Estacado and the western portion of the lower part of the Southwestern Tablelands ecological region. South Plains extends south of the Texas Panhandle, centered at Lubbock.

While prominent in the area of petroleum production, the South Plains is mainly an agricultural region, producing a great percentage of the nation&#x27;s cotton and possessing numerous large cattle ranches. The South Plains is also home to several colleges and universities, the largest being Texas Tech University in Lubbock.

==Major cities and towns==
==Cotton==
Cotton is the most common crop grown in South Plains region. In 2004 and again in 2005, records were broken for cotton production. In an extended area comprising 31 counties in and near the South Plains, more than a million bales of cotton were harvested in 2005. This makes the South Plains the world’s largest cotton-producing region.

==Regional identity==
There are many businesses and organizations that use “South Plains” as part of their name, helping to form the South Plains regional identity. These include South Plains College in Levelland; the Panhandle-South Plains Fair held annually in Lubbock; Make-A-Wish Texas South Plains; the South Plains Regional Chapter of the American Red Cross; South Plains Council of the Boy Scouts of America; and numerous other public and private organizations.

<text>World Animal Day is an international day of action for animal rights and welfare celebrated annually on October 4, the feast day of Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals.

The World Animal Day movement is supported and endorsed by a number of celebrities, such as Anneka Svenska, Brian Blessed and Melanie C.

==History==

World Animal Day, was originated by cynologist Heinrich Zimmermann. He organized the first World Animal Day on March 24, 1925, at the Sport Palace in Berlin, Germany. Over 5,000 people attended this first event. The activity was originally scheduled for October 4, to align with the feast day of Saint Francis of Assisi, patron saint of animals. However, the venue was not available on that day. The event was then moved to October 4 for the first time in 1929. Every year, Zimmermann worked tirelessly on the promotion of World Animal Day. Finally, in May 1931 at a congress of the International Animal Protection Congress in Florence, Italy, his proposal to make October 4 as World Animal Day universal was unanimously accepted and adopted as a resolution.

It is sometimes cited, incorrectly, that World Animal Day started in 1931 at the convention of ecologists in Florence, Italy, who wished to highlight the plight of endangered species.

In 1948, Australian celebrations were organised by the RSPCA. According to &quot;The Examiner&quot;, the construction of a boarding home for dogs was scheduled and a donation had been received from the L.G.R.C. Since 2002, The Finnish Association of Animal Protection Associations (SEY) has organized various events during the Animal Week and distributed material to schools. On October 27, 2006, the Polish parliament adopted a resolution on the establishment of 4 October as Animal Day.

In Argentina, this day has been observed on April 29 since 1908, promoted by Ignacio Lucas Albarracín, president of the Animal Protection Association of Buenos Aires. Coincidentally Albarracín would die on the same date in 1926, making it a day to also pay tribute to him for pioneering the animal&#x27;s rights movement in the country.

Since 2003, World Animal Day has been coordinated by UK based animal welfare charity, Naturewatch Foundation with a new World Animal Day website launched for the 2023 celebration.

Many countries such as Bolivia, Bahamas, China, and Colombia have community driven annual events to promote the global celebration.

== Annual Themes ==
Starting in 2018, Naturewatch Foundation has included specific themes in the day&#x27;s celebration.

<text>Rallycross is a form of sprint style motorsport, held on a closed mixed-surface racing circuit, with modified production or specially built touring cars. It is mainly popular in the Nordic countries, the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Great Britain. An inexpensive, entry level type of rallycross is the Swedish &quot;folkrace&quot; or its Norwegian counterpart, the so-called &quot;bilcross&quot;. The &quot;folkrace&quot; is most popular in Finland where it was founded back in the late 1960s. In Europe, rallycross can also refer to racing 1:8 scale off-road radio-controlled buggies.

==History ==
===Origins of rallycross===

The sport started as a TV show (with especially invited rally drivers), produced by Robert Reed of ABC Weekend TV for ITV&#x27;s &quot;World of Sport&quot; programme, at Lydden Circuit (between Dover and Canterbury) in Great Britain on Saturday, 4 February 1967. The first true rallycross was organised by Bud Smith (d. 1994) and the &quot;Tunbridge Wells Centre of the 750 MC&quot;, with the aid of Lydden Circuit owner Bill Chesson (d. 1999), and was won by later Formula One driver as well as 1968 Rally Monte Carlo winner Vic Elford in a showroom Porsche 911 of the British importer AFN, ahead of Brian Melia in his Ford Lotus Cortina and Tony Fall in a BMC Mini Cooper S.

After that inaugural event there were another two test rallycrosses at Lydden, on 11 March and 29 July, before the new &quot;World of Sport Rallycross Championship&quot; for the ABC TV viewers started with round one on 23 September, to be followed by round two on 7 October. The series was run over a total of six rounds (three at Lydden and three at Croft) and was eventually won by Englishman Tony Chappell (Ford Escort Twin Cam), who became the first British Rallycross champion after winning the final round of the new series on 6 April 1968 at Lydden.

However, the true birth of rallycross is often wrongly connected with the cancellation of the 1967 RAC Rally, due to foot-and-mouth disease, in November 1967, about ten months after the maiden event. Some foreign entrants for the RAC had also planned to take part in the 1st international rallycross at Lydden Circuit, on Saturday, 25 November 1967, but went home immediately after the rally had been cancelled on the evening of 17 November, and was replaced by a single special stage (won by Swede Erik Carlsson in a Saab 96 V4) for the sake of the disappointed television companies. RAC Rally stage number one by then, Camberley, was on Ministry of Defence land and not affected by movement restrictions caused by the disease in rural areas. Subsequently, only British drivers competed in the maiden international rallycross event one week later, which was eventually won by Andrew Cowan and his Hillman Imp. &quot;Thames Estuary Automobile Club&#x27;s (TEAC)&quot; premier event, the original Clubman&#x27;s rallycross, was held the day after. It opened up the new rally drivers&#x27; fun-sport to many amateur competitors, proved very successful and thereby paved the way for the first generation of real rallycross specialists, many of them coming from the ranges of autocross and autograss racing.

After one and a half years and several rallycross events at Lydden as well as Croft Circuit (near Darlington) the BBC adopted the young sport for its &quot;Grandstand&quot; programme while ITV dropped it after the British Rallycross Winter Series 1968/69. In 1969 Lydden Circuit and Croft Circuit were joined by another RX venue, Cadwell Park in Lincolnshire. However, while both Lydden and Croft nowadays are still in use for rallycross Cadwell Park later dropped this type of car racing from its schedule.

===Expansion to the Netherlands===
Rob Herzet (AVRO), a Dutch counterpart to Robert Reed, discovered rallycross during a visit to Great Britain in 1968 and immediately understood its potential for the television viewers. By that time there were nearly ten million Britons watching some of the events on television. Back home in the Netherlands, Herzet contacted the race and rally driver as well as motoring journalist Gerard van Lennep (a cousin to Formula One driver Gijs van Lennep) to discuss his find. Both agreed that this form of sprint racing could be also appropriate for the Netherlands. Van Lennep soon started his investigations and found a military testing ground near the town of Venlo, close to the Dutch-German border. Actually there had been two venues available, the one at Venlo in Limburg and one at Elst in Gelderland, but the aid offered by the army turned the decision into the favour of Venlo.
On Saturday 17 May 1969 a group of invited rally and racing drivers went to the spot for a test day. Everybody was really satisfied and enthusiastic and only three weeks later, on Saturday 7 June the first rallycross event on the European continent was held. The track consisted of a section of concrete runway, loose sections through heathland and a hollow, about 40 metres long and 10 metres deep, usually used for tank testing. Although the soft heath soil and the muddy hollow hampered most of the two dozen or so competitors, or at least their mostly rather aged cars, the event produced much fun for all concerned as well as the TV audience. Overall victory went eventually to Hans Kok and his valuable NSU 1200 TT.
Davy Van Den Branden 9 Times Belgian Champion. And 5 times Netherlands Champion.

The Dutch television company AVRO gave green light to Rob Herzet as well as another three rounds counting towards the so-called AVRO-Trophy and on 16 August of the same year NSU campaigner Hans Kok claimed the first national Dutch rallycross title. On October 4 1969 Holland saw its last Rallycross event of the first season, a stand-alone one-off race organised on a temporary track that was quickly set up on pastureland near the ‘Europahal’ at the town of Elst, halfway between Arnhem and Nijmegen. Here it was young Briton ‘Jumping’ Jeff Wiliamson who drove his Riley 1300 to overall victory. On 1 November the Dutch Rallycross Association was founded and, during 1970, organised another five events at Venlo. For 1971 the Nederlandse Rallycross Vereniging (NRV) moved the sport to its new continental home at Valkenswaard near Eindhoven. The Eurocircuit opened on Saturday 17 April with a race that was won by Jan de Rooy and his famous DAF 555 Coupé 4WD and became the first track in the World that was especially designed and built purely for rallycross purposes.

===Expansion to Australia===
Rallycross came to Australia in 1969 with a one off meeting at Leppington in New South Wales. Events were held at Calder Park Raceway in Melbourne until the mid 1970s and at the Catalina Park circuit in Katoomba in New South Wales from 1972 until the early 1980s. Circuits at Towac near Orange in New South Wales as well as Tailem Bend and Whyalla in South Australia were also used, but after a dozen or so years the sport faded in Australia. Peter Brock was especially successful driving for the Holden Dealer Team in a supercharged Holden Torana GTR.

The inaugural Australian Rallycross Championship was held at the Tailem Bend circuit on 24 June 1979 and was won by Larry Perkins, driving a 2.0-litre Volkswagen Beetle for Kruger Motors. This was the only Australian Rallycross Championship to be contested.

A national rallycross championship was set to return to Australia in 2015 in the form of the Extreme Rallycross Championship, originally scheduled to consist of seven events held across 2015 and 2016. However, the series was cancelled after just one event had been held due to a lack of entries. A proposed Victorian championship, titled Rallycross Australia, was also cancelled before a single event had been run.

=== Soviet Union ===
In Soviet Union history of rallycross (under name of autocross) dates back to 1949 when first competitions were held for light trucks, as well as passenger cars. First competitions resembled more light offroad race over 20-40km course, but over time races shortened and purpose built tracks were established. In 1970s and 1980s autocross was among most popular autosport disciplines in Soviet Union with hundreds of racing tracks and various classes of trucks, light cars and purpose built buggies competing. Most classes were effectively one-make classes, with few performance upgrades available, which together with wide state support made autocross popular and easily accessible to enthusiasts. Since late 1970s local regulations for autocross were harmonized with FIA regulations for rallycross. Until that time most tracks were unpaved, since then more partially paved rallycross tracks were built. 

==In the United States==
In October 2009 Rally America (for two years operating under the tag RallyCar) announced it would begin sanctioning European style rallycross events in the United States. The inaugural season of the RallyCar Rallycross Championship, held in 2010, featured four events and several rally, rallycross and drifting competitors have shown an interest in contesting these races. All four events (August 29, October 3, November 6, November 7) were organised at New Jersey Motorsports Park.

A closed-format circuit race called Rallycross was a regular event at the X Games for some years. It was first added to the X Games XVI in 2010 under the name SuperRally. This event involved heavily modified production cars with turbocharged engines running at 600 hp, all-wheel drive, sequential gearboxes, and offroad style suspension tuned for long jumps.

The Global RallyCross Championship was a Red Bull-sponsored championship that began in 2011 with five rounds in Irwindale, California (The Revolution), Snoqualmie, WA (Twin Peaks), Fountain, CO (Last Chance) and X Games 17 in the streets of Downtown Los Angeles. The series had several popular drivers such as Tanner Foust, Ken Block, Travis Pastrana, Finn Marcus Grönholm, Kiwi Rhys Millen, Dave Mirra, Frenchman Stéphane Verdier, Swede Michael Jernberg and Briton Liam Doran. The events were televised on ESPN. In 2012, the series grew to seven events run in conjunction with NASCAR Sprint Cup and IndyCar weekends as well as X Games 18 in Los Angeles. Several marques fielded factory- or importer-supported efforts including Ford, Hyundai, Subaru and Dodge. In 2013 the series went to Foz do Iguaçu, Brazil, and Munich, Germany, and a rained-out event in Barcelona, Spain. 

In 2013, GRC Lites made their debut in Loudon, New Hampshire, with the series most exciting race held at Atlanta Motor Speedway pitting professional European rallycross drivers against newcomer, American Mitchell DeJong. Global Rallycross was also featured in X Games this year, held at the Irwindale Raceway. American newcomer, Mitchell deJong joined the series and made history as the youngest to win the Silver Medal in X-Games in his first attempt at age 16. 

In 2014 the Global Rallycross Championship Series traveled to tracks across the U.S. and Canada. The series traveled to Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas where American driver, Mitchell deJong made history again when he became the youngest to be invited and to win the Gold Medal in X-Games. 

In 2018, the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas, hosted the World Rallycross race event again on September 29–30 at the purpose-built track.

The Americas Rallycross Championship began competition in 2018. However, it was cancelled after the 2019 season due to a lack of sponsors.

Pastrana launched his own rallycross championship Nitro Rallycross in 2021.

==In the United Kingdom==
The Motorsport UK British Rallycross Championship presented by Cooper Tires is the current national series in the United Kingdom. The calendar features iconic rallycross circuits including Lydden Hill Race Circuit. Recognised as an official championship by the MSUK, the governing body of motorsport in Great Britain.

==FIA European Rallycross Championship and FIA World Rallycross Championship==

The first FIA World Rallycross Championship (World RX) took place from 4–5 May 2014, alongside the FIA European Rallycross Championship (Euro RX), the latter formerly known as FIA European Championships for Rallycross Drivers. Former World Rally Championship champion Petter Solberg took first place to become the first FIA World Rallycross Championship winner.

The 2014 FIA World Rallycross Championship consists of 12 events globally for the Supercar category.

FIA World and European Rallycross Championship cars are built based on production car body shells of vehicles homologated for Group A and Group N, or permitted by a special FIA list for non-homologated cars to be used in rallycross but are extensively modified.

==Race format==
Different rallycross championships and events use different formats and scoring systems.

==Electric rallycross==
The FIA made changes to rallycross categories before the beginning of 2021 season. The Supercar category was renamed to RX1, and a new electric rallycross supercar category RX1e was introduced. The Junior RX2 series were dropped, and Junior electric series RX2e were introduced. RX1e championship is expected to debut in 2022 season, consisting of the RX1 supercars retrofitted with two 250kW electric motors (equivalent of 680 horsepower), and equipped with 52kWh performance battery. 
==Similar types of racing==

In Australia and in the United States, dirt track racing is common, which is similar to rallycross with two main differences, the vehicles are sprint cars, late models, modifieds and midgets instead, and they usually run on oval dirt tracks.

In Great Britain, autocross was where some of the pioneers of rallycross got their starts. In other European countries, autocross is similar to in Britain, but with the cars starting at the same time like in rallycross. Crosskart is a later offshoot of this which commonly uses rallycross tracks.

Motocross, which is similar to rallycross, but with motorcycles, ATVs and pit bikes is very popular worldwide. It also spawned BMX and sidecarcross.

In France, camion cross is popular, which is a similar discipline to rallycross but uses trucks.

<doc id="1038716" wikidata="Q5522745" url="?curid=1038716" title="Garech Browne">
<text>Garech Domnagh Browne (25 June 1939 – 10 March 2018) was an Irish art collector and a notable patron of Irish arts, traditional Irish music in particular. He was often known by a Gaelic translation of his English name, Garech de Brún, or alternatively Garech a Brún, especially in Ireland.
==Family==
Browne was the eldest of the three sons of the 4th Baron Oranmore and Browne and his second wife, Oonagh, daughter of The Hon. Ernest Guinness, the second son of the 1st Earl of Iveagh. Oonagh was a wealthy heiress to the Guinness fortune and the youngest of the three &quot;Golden Guinness Girls&quot;. Garech&#x27;s father, Lord Oranmore and Browne, had the rare distinction of sitting in the House of Lords for 72 years, until his death at the age of 100 in August 2002, without ever speaking in a debate.

As both his parents were married three times, Garech had two stepmothers and two stepfathers, as well as a number of older half-siblings. His only full brother, The Hon. Tara Browne, was a young London socialite whose death at the age of 21 in a car crash in London&#x27;s West End helped inspire John Lennon when writing the song &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; with Paul McCartney. Garech was educated at Institut Le Rosey, Switzerland. Although a member of the extended Guinness family, he took no active part in its brewing business.

When in Ireland, Browne lived at Luggala, set deep in the Wicklow Mountains in County Wicklow. The house, which he inherited from his mother, has been variously described as a castle or hunting lodge of large proportions. In 2008, there was a major theft of silver and rare books from Luggala; previously, Browne had appointed as an adviser on the restoration of Luggala the architectural historian &quot;Count&quot; Randal MacDonnell, who called himself &quot;The MacDonnell of the Glens&quot; and formerly &quot;Baron Randal MacDonnell of the Isles&quot;, a well-known eccentric fantasist. While MacDonnell was there, Browne noticed &quot;the disappearance from the house of items of Georgian silver and other valuable chattels&quot;, resulting in a &quot;blistering row&quot; and MacDonnell&#x27;s escape from what was called the &quot;silver teapot affair&quot; to Prague.

A 2012 book, &quot;Luggala Days&quot;, by Robert O&#x27;Byrne details both the history of Luggala and of Garech&#x27;s life.

Browne once stated he would rather have not been born, calling it &quot;frightful to bring anyone into this world&quot;.

==Traditional Irish music==

Browne had been a leading proponent for the revival and preservation of traditional Irish music, through his record label Claddagh Records which he founded with others in 1959. His former home, Woodtown Manor near Dublin, was for many years a welcoming place for Irish poets, writers and musicians. The folk-pop group Clannad made many recordings of their music there.

Garech was instrumental in the formation of the traditional Irish folk group The Chieftains, including the launch of their first six LPs. In 1962, after setting up Claddagh Records, he asked his friend, the famed uileann piper Paddy Moloney, to form a group for a one-off album. Moloney responded with the first line-up for the band, which went on to achieve international commercial success.

He was interviewed at length for the &quot;Grace Notes&quot; traditional music programme on RTÉ lyric fm on 18 March 2010.

==Art patron==

Garech was a friend and patron of the artist Francis Bacon, and in January 2017 was featured in the BBC documentary &quot;Francis Bacon: A Brush with Violence.&quot;

==Marriage==
In 1981, Browne married HH Princess Harshad Purna Devi Jadeja of Morvi in Bombay (now Mumbai).

Garech Browne and the Luggala Estate feature in the 1991 film &quot;I Dreamt I Woke Up&quot; by John Boorman (online).

<text>Claddagh Records is a record label, based in Dublin&#x27;s Temple Bar area, founded in 1959 by Garech Browne and Ivor Browne. It specialises in Irish traditional music, song and spoken word. Garech Browne had been taking uilleann pipe lessons at the time from maestro Leo Rowsome, whom had made many of the earliest Irish music recordings in the 1920s and 1930s through His Master&#x27;s Voice and Decca; Rowsome went on to be the debut artist featured by the Claddagh label with his album &quot;Rí na bPíobairí&quot; (&quot;King of the Pipers&quot;; also the name of a traditional tune), producing virtuosic recordings. The second release by Claddagh was The Chieftains&#x27; debut album, a band who has made history as, arguably, the most globally well-known and longest-running Irish traditional group.

Some Claddagh records feature poets reading their own works, amongst whom include Patrick Kavanagh, John Montague, and a young Seamus Heaney. Liam O’Flaherty&#x27;s 1981 record was to be the only one of him reading his own work recorded by Claddagh.

Garech Browne, who died in 2018, was an Irish art collector and a notable patron of the Irish arts, traditional Irish music in particular. He was often known by his Irish name, &quot;Garech de Brún&quot;, or &quot;Garech a Brún&quot;, particularly in Ireland and by Irish speakers.

Ivor Browne, who died on 24 January 2024, was a jazz and traditional musician, as well as a retired psychiatrist and author. In addition to serving as former Chief Psychiatrist of the Eastern Health Board, Browne was also Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at University College Dublin. During his psychiatric career, he was well-known for his staunch opposition to traditional psychiatric treatment methods, particularly with regards to his skepticism surrounding psychiatric drugs; Browne openly discussed his early experiences with psychedelics, like LSD, in a quest for non-traditional, experimental &quot;treatments&quot; of his own mental conditions (such as depression).

<text>The Feldherrnhalle (&quot;Field Marshals&#x27; Hall&quot;) is a monumental loggia on the Odeonsplatz in Munich, Germany. Modelled after the Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence, it was commissioned in 1841 by King Ludwig I of Bavaria to honour the tradition of the Bavarian Army.

In 1923, it was the site of the brief battle that ended Hitler&#x27;s Beer Hall Putsch. During the Nazi era, it served as a monument commemorating the deaths of the 15 Nazis and one bystander killed during the revolt.

==Structure==
The Feldherrnhalle was built between 1841 and 1844 at the southern end of Munich&#x27;s Ludwigstrasse next to the Palais Preysing and southwest of the Hofgarten. Previously, the Gothic &quot;Schwabinger Tor&quot; (gate) occupied that place. Friedrich von Gärtner built the Feldherrnhalle at the behest of King Ludwig I of Bavaria after the example of the Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence.

The Feldherrnhalle was a symbol of the honours of the Bavarian Army, represented by statues of two military leaders Johann Tilly and Karl Philipp von Wrede. The first led Bavarians in the Thirty Years War; the second led the fight against Napoleon. The statues were created by Ludwig Schwanthaler.

Right from the start, some Munich folk used to (and still do) ridicule the two persons honoured in the &quot;Bayerische Feldherrnhalle&quot; (lit. &#x27;Bavarian Hall of Field Commanders / Field Marshals&#x27;) in reference to the descendance of Tilly and the military strategic capabilities of Wrede:
&quot;The one / first was&quot; indeed &quot;never anything like a Bavarian and the second / other&quot; imputedly &quot;never anything like a Feldherr&quot;.
It is a citation from Lion Feuchtwanger&#x27;s novel &quot;&quot;.

A sculptural group by Ferdinand von Miller was added to the centre of the monument in 1892, after the Franco-Prussian War, representing the victory over the French and the unification of Germany. The lions are a work of Wilhelm von Rümann, added in 1906 in imitation of the Medici lions of the Loggia dei Lanzi.

==Site of the Beer Hall Putsch==
The Feldherrnhalle was the scene of a confrontation on Friday morning, 9 November 1923, between the Bavarian State Police and the followers of Adolf Hitler in which the Nazi Party attempted to storm the Bavarian Defense Ministry. This was the culmination of the Nazis&#x27; failed coup attempt to take over the Bavarian State, commonly referred to as the &quot;Beer Hall Putsch&quot;. In the ensuing gun battle, four policemen and 15 putschists were killed. Many more were wounded, including Hermann Göring. As a result of the failure of the so-called Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler was arrested and sentenced to a prison term.

==Nazi memorial==

After the Nazis took power in 1933, Hitler turned the Feldherrnhalle into a memorial to the Nazis killed during the failed putsch. A memorial to the fallen SA men was put up on its east side, opposite the location of the shootings. This monument, called the &quot;Mahnmal der Bewegung&quot; was created to a design by Paul Ludwig Troost. It was a rectangular structure listing the names of the martyrs. This was under perpetual ceremonial guard by the SS. The square in front of the Feldherrnhalle (the Odeonsplatz) was used for SS parades and commemorative rallies. During some of these events the sixteen dead were each commemorated by a temporary pillar placed in the Feldherrnhalle topped by a flame. New SS recruits took their oath of loyalty to Hitler in front of the memorial. Passers-by were expected to hail the site with the Nazi salute.

Consequently, some people tried to avoid this. The structure&#x27;s back side was (and still is) occupied by a Rococo palace, the Palais Preysing, in front of which runs a lane, the Viscardigasse. This little detour helped to bypass the hall, subsequently earning it the nickname &quot;Drückebergergasse&quot; (lit. &#x27;shirker&#x27;s lane&#x27;).

One of the most prestigious decorations of the Nazi Party, the Blood Order medal, featured a relief of the entrance to the Feldherrnhalle on its reverse under an angled swastika and sun rays. 

==Post war==
At the end of the war the Feldherrnhalle was restored to its pre-Nazi appearance. Local people spontaneously smashed the &quot;Mahnmal der Bewegung&quot; to pieces on 3 June 1945. In the 1950s a plan to move Bavaria&#x27;s memorial to the unknown soldier to the Feldherrnhalle was halted on the grounds that it could provide an excuse for neo-Nazis to meet at the site.

On 25 April 1995, Reinhold Elstner, a World War II veteran, committed self-immolation in front of Feldhernhalle to protest against &quot;the ongoing official slander and demonization of the German people and German soldiers&quot;. Each year neo-fascist groups from various European countries try to hold a commemorative ceremony for him, which Bavarian authorities try to prevent through state and federal courts.

<doc id="1038736" wikidata="Q736864" url="?curid=1038736" title="Paddy Moloney">
<text>Paddy Moloney (; 1 August 1938 – 12 October 2021) was an Irish musician, composer, and record producer. He co-founded and led the Irish musical group the Chieftains, playing on all of their 44 albums. He was particularly associated with the revival of the uilleann pipes.

== Early life == 
Moloney was born in the Donnycarney area of Dublin on 1 August 1938, the son of housewife Catherine (&quot;née&quot; Conroy) and Irish Glass Bottle Company accountant John Moloney. His mother bought him a tin whistle when he was six and he started to learn the uilleann pipes at the age of eight.

== Musical career == 
In addition to the tin whistle and the uilleann pipes, Moloney also played button accordion and bodhrán.

=== As a band musician === 
==== Ceoltóirí Chualann ==== 
Moloney first met Seán Ó Riada in the late 1950s. He then joined Ó Riada&#x27;s group, Ceoltóirí Chualann, in 1960.
==== The Chieftains ==== 
Along with Sean Potts and Michael Tubridy, Moloney formed the traditional Irish band the Chieftains in Dublin in November 1962. As the band leader, he was the primary composer and arranger of much of the Chieftains&#x27; music, and composed for films including &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, &quot;The Grey Fox&quot;, &quot;Braveheart&quot;, &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;, and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;.

=== As a session musician === 
Moloney did session work for Mike Oldfield, The Muppets, Mick Jagger, Gary Moore, Paul McCartney, Sting, Don Henley, and Stevie Wonder.

=== As a producer === 
Together with Garech de Brún (anglicised to Garech Browne) of Luggala, he founded Claddagh Records in 1959. In 1968 he became a producer for the label and supervised the recording of 45 albums.

== Personal life and death ==
Moloney was married to artist Rita O&#x27;Reilly from 1962 until his death in 2021. They met during the 1950s while he was working for Baxendale &amp; Company. They had three children together named Aonghus, Padraig, and Aedin, the last of whom is an actress and producer. He was a fluent speaker of Irish.

Moloney died suddenly at a hospital in Dublin on 12 October 2021, at the age of 83. His funeral was held on 15 October at St. Kevin&#x27;s Church in Glendalough, followed by a burial at the adjoining cemetery.

==Tributes==
Irish President Michael D. Higgins said, &quot;The Irish music community, and indeed the much larger community throughout the world who found such inspiration in his work, will have learned with great sadness today of the passing of Paddy Moloney. [...] Paddy, with his extraordinary skills as an instrumentalist, notably the uilleann pipes and bodhrán, was at the forefront of the renaissance of interest in Irish music, bringing a greater appreciation of Irish music and culture internationally.&quot;

Maura McGrath, chairwoman of the National Concert Hall in Dublin, said, &quot;His musical achievement with the Chieftains was, and will continue to be, recognised as outstanding, transcending all musical boundaries, and connecting Irish people everywhere with their unique sound. Paddy&#x27;s contribution to, and support of, the National Concert Hall throughout his lifetime has been immense.&quot;

On 28 June of the following year, he and the other members of the Chieftains received the Castelao Medal by the Government of Galicia, Spain for services to Galician culture and society.

<text>The World Won&#x27;t Listen is a compilation album by English rock band the Smiths, released on 23 February 1987 by Rough Trade Records. The album is the second of three compilation albums—the others being &quot;Hatful of Hollow&quot; and &quot;Louder Than Bombs&quot;—released by the Smiths while they were still an active band. It reached No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart, staying on the charts for 15 weeks. In the United States &quot;Louder Than Bombs&quot; was released in place of &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Listen&quot;.

==Background==
The album is a collection of the band&#x27;s singles and select B-sides from 1985 to 1987. Additionally, the scrapped single &quot;You Just Haven&#x27;t Earned It Yet, Baby&quot; (which was passed over for &quot;Shoplifters of the World Unite&quot;) and the near-single &quot;There Is a Light That Never Goes Out&quot; (a single candidate from &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; that was passed over in favour of &quot;Bigmouth Strikes Again&quot;) were included.

The title reflects Smiths singer Morrissey&#x27;s belief that mainstream radio and record buyers weren&#x27;t paying attention to the band. The compilation was succeeded three months later by &quot;Louder Than Bombs&quot;. Originally intended solely for US release, Rough Trade chose to also release &quot;Louder Than Bombs&quot; in the UK. It featured a similar, but extended track listing to &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Listen&quot;. &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Listen&quot; contains two versions of songs that do not appear on &quot;Louder Than Bombs&quot;: the single version of &quot;The Boy with the Thorn in His Side&quot; and the single edit of &quot;That Joke Isn&#x27;t Funny Anymore&quot;. Additionally, &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Listen&quot; contains different versions of two songs that would appear on &quot;Louder Than Bombs:&quot; &quot;Stretch Out and Wait&quot; features an alternate vocal, and &quot;You Just Haven&#x27;t Earned It Yet, Baby&quot; appears in a slightly different and longer mix. In Australia and New Zealand, a double LP (and double cassette) second edition was released with an additional 12 tracks on the extra disc. The 12 extra tracks are mostly sourced (in order) from &quot;Louder than Bombs&quot; as well as &quot;Panic&quot; B-side &quot;The Draize Train&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t otherwise appear on either. The 2011 reissue replaced the single version of &quot;The Boy With the Thorn in His Side&quot; with the album version. Also of note is the fact that &quot;Ask&quot; appears on both &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Listen&quot; and &quot;Louder Than Bombs&quot; in a slightly different and longer mix than its single version.

After WEA acquired the Smiths&#x27; back catalogue in 1992, all Smiths albums were re-released in the UK in 1993 at mid-price, including &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Listen&quot;, which was expanded to include a cover of &quot;Golden Lights&quot; and the original Rough Trade cassette edition bonus track &quot;Money Changes Everything&quot; (the &quot;Bigmouth Strikes Again&quot; B-side, also later released on the deluxe edition of &quot;The Sound of The Smiths&quot;). In the US, the albums were also re-released in 1993, although &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Listen&quot; was not included among them.

==Artwork and packaging==
The CD sleeve for &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Listen&quot; is based on the cassette version of the sleeve layout; the original album featured a larger picture of a 1960s fairground scene, of which this is a crop. The sleeve was designed by Morrissey, using a photo by Jürgen Vollmer from the book &quot;Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Times: The Style and Spirit of the Early Beatles and Their First Fans&quot;.

==Release==
The album was released on 23 February 1987. It first charted on 3 March 1987, remaining in the top 100 for 15 weeks and peaking at No. 2. &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Listen&quot; returned to the UK top 100 for two weeks in 1995, following its re-release by WEA. In 2011, &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Listen&quot; was included in the Smiths&#x27; compilation box set &quot;Complete&quot;. This marked the first time the album was officially released in the US.

<doc id="1038746" wikidata="Q6502565" url="?curid=1038746" title="Fort Lauderdale Strikers (1977–1983)">
<text>The Fort Lauderdale Strikers were a professional soccer team based in the Miami metropolitan area. They competed in the North American Soccer League (NASL) from 1977 to 1983. They played their home matches at Lockhart Stadium.

Founded in 1967 as the Washington Darts, the team relocated to Florida in 1972. They were known as the Miami Gatos (1972) and the Miami Toros (1973–1976) before moving to nearby Fort Lauderdale. In addition to their time in the NASL outdoor league, the Strikers also played two indoor seasons while in Fort Lauderdale, at the West Palm Beach Auditorium for the 1979–80 season and the Hollywood Sportatorium for the 1980–81 season. After the 1983 season, the Strikers moved to Minneapolis and became the Minnesota Strikers. Among their players during its time in Fort Lauderdale were football legends George Best and Gerd Müller.

==History==

===Origins===
Founded in 1963 as the amateur club Washington Britannica and eventually rebranding as the Washington Darts, the team joined the North American Soccer League in 1970 after playing three seasons in the American Soccer League and winning two consecutive ASL championships. After the 1970 season, the team was sold to John Bilotta, former part owner of the Rochester Lancers, and Arthur Bant a hotel owner, who relocated and rebranded as the team as the Miami Gatos. After one season, the team was sold to a group of 25 local business leaders including Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie and his wife Elizabeth and renamed the Toros. In December 1976 and after five seasons in Miami, the team announced it was moving to Fort Lauderdale. The team played its first game, an indoor friendly, on February 27, 1977, against the Tampa Bay Rowdies, the first meeting in what was to become one of the most enduring rivalries in North American soccer, the Fort Lauderdale–Tampa Bay rivalry.

===Early Success===
The Strikers won their debut match 2–1 at Lockhart Stadium against the St. Louis Stars on April 10, 1977. They finished the 1977 season in first place of the Eastern Division American Conference with a record of nineteen wins and seven losses, tying the league record for most wins in a season. The team drew an average 8,148 fans for the season, a 165% increase over the team&#x27;s last season as the Toros, and head coach Ron Newman, who had been hired before the team announced its move to Fort Lauderdale, was named NASL coach of the year. In the first match of the Division Championship, the Strikers lost to the Pelé led New York Cosmos 8–3 at Giants Stadium in a match which drew 77,691 fans, a record for a non-exhibition domestic league soccer game. In the return leg played in Fort Lauderdale, the Strikers lost 3–2 in an overtime shootout. Finishing the 1978 season in third place with a record of sixteen wins and fourteen losses, the Strikers made it to the third round of the playoffs, losing the Conference Championship to the Tampa Bay Rowdies. The team was one of four to participate in the 1979 NASL Budweiser Indoor Soccer Invitational, losing both games the played The 1979 North American Soccer League season ended with the Strikers in second place of the Eastern Division behind the Rowdies with a record of seventeen wins, thirteen losses and averaging 13,774 attendance per game. The Strikers were knocked out of the first round of the playoffs by the Chicago Sting, losing both games without scoring a goal. The day before the second game, it was announced that the team had relieved Ron Newman as head coach and offered him a job in the team management.

===Post Newman Era===

After Newman declined the front office position, the Strikers hired Bob Lemieux who had been working as an executive for the Detroit Red Wings as the team&#x27;s General Manager.
In December 1979, the Strikers announced that Cor van der Hart had been hired as head coach. During the 1980 NASL Season there were several reports of arguments between van der Hart and the players as well as publicity referencing a drinking problem, both issues led to difficulties with the head office. Finishing with a record of eighteen wins and fourteen loses, the team ended the season in second place of the Eastern Division, behind the Tampa Bay Rowdies again. The Strikers advanced to Soccer Bowl &#x27;80 against the New York Cosmos after defeating the California Surf, Edmonton Drillers, and San Diego Sockers in the first three rounds of the playoffs. On September 21, 1980, at RFK Stadium in Washington, DC the Strikers lost to the Cosmos 3–0. In mid October, Lemieux was fired from his position as General Manager with Tim Robbie, son of owners Joe and Elizabeth Robbie, taking over the position. Then in late December 1980 with the team 0–6 in the 1980–81 NASL Indoor season and after having announced just after the Soccer Bowl that he would return as head coach for the following outdoor season, van der Hart was fired. Team spokesman stated &quot;personal issues&quot; and &quot;team morale&quot; as the primary reason and that Assistant Bill Nuttall was named caretaker for the reminder of the indoor campaign. German Eckhard Krautzun who had coached the Houston Hurricane during the 1980 season, was named head coach for the 1981 Outdoor season. The 1981 season saw the team&#x27;s first decline in average attendance since it had moved to Fort Lauderdale with 13,345 fans per game seeing them finish second in the Southern Division with a record of eighteen wins and fourteen losses, rather than the 14,360 who attended each game during the 1980 season. After defeating the Calgary Boomers and Minnesota Kicks in the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Strikers lost in the Semifinals to the Cosmos. The day after the Strikers were eliminated from contention for Soccer Bowl &#x27;81, the North American Soccer League announced that the team would not participate in the upcoming 1981–82 NASL Indoor season, but would return for 1982 outdoor season.

===Decline===
The Strikers ended the 1982 North American Soccer League season with an identical eighteen wins and fourteen losses from the previous season which won them the Southern Division title with another decline in attendance of 12,345 average attendance. After defeating the Montreal Manic in the first round of the playoffs, the Strikers failed to qualify for Soccer Bowl &#x27;82 when they lost the semifinals to Seattle Sounders. After two seasons, Krautzun was fired as head coach with former Striker player and head coach of the recently folded Georgia Generals David Chadwick rumored to be interested in the position. His hiring was confirmed a week later. In addition to compiling a record of one win and seven losses in the 1983 NASL Grand Prix of Indoor Soccer, the Strikers played two indoor friendlies during the offseason. The team&#x27;s attendance continued decline in the 1983 outdoor season and the team recorded their first losing record in an outdoor NASL season with fourteen wins and sixteen losses. Finishing second in the Southern Division, the team was eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Tulsa Roughnecks.

===Relocation===
Following the conclusion of the 1983 outdoor season season long rumors that the team was looking to move were confirmed when General Manager Tim Robbie met with officials in Minneapolis On November 30, 1983, team owner Elizabeth Robbie, Minnesota Governor Rudy Perpich, and NASL president Howard Samuels officially announced the team was moving and indicated the team had lost around $1 million in the last year. In 1984 the team began play as the Minnesota Strikers. The team survived the NASL folding after the 1984 season and competed in the Major Indoor Soccer League for an additional four seasons before going out of business.

Hopeless Records was founded in 1993 by Louis Posen.

Some of their best-known artists include All Time Low, Sum 41, Neck Deep, Avenged Sevenfold, Thrice, Yellowcard, Anarbor, Taking Back Sunday, Silverstein, Amber Pacific, We Are the In Crowd, Bayside, the Used, the Wonder Years, the Human Abstract and Enter Shikari.

In July 2008, Hopeless Records announced that it had launched a new imprint, P Is for Panda. It was originally started in 2007 as a clothing line by The Militia Group founder Chad Pearson. The P Is For Panda label released its first album, a various artists compilation in August 2008.

<doc id="1038753" wikidata="Q18400501" url="?curid=1038753" title="Cut rule">
<text>In mathematical logic, the cut rule is an inference rule of sequent calculus. It is a generalisation of the classical modus ponens inference rule. Its meaning is that, if a formula &quot;A&quot; appears as a conclusion in one proof and a hypothesis in another, then another proof in which the formula &quot;A&quot; does not appear can be deduced. This applies to cases of modus ponens, such as how instances of &quot;man&quot; are eliminated from &quot;Every man is mortal, Socrates is a man&quot; to deduce &quot;Socrates is mortal&quot;.

== Formal notation ==
It is normally written in formal notation in sequent calculus notation as :
: formula_1cut

== Elimination ==
The cut rule is the subject of an important theorem, the cut-elimination theorem. It states that any sequent that has a proof in the sequent calculus making use of the cut rule also has a cut-free proof, that is, a proof that does not make use of the cut rule.

<doc id="1038757" wikidata="Q1815107" url="?curid=1038757" title="Uraniidae">
<text>The Uraniidae are a family of moths containing four subfamilies, 90 genera, and roughly 700 species. The family is distributed throughout the tropics of the Americas, Africa and Indo-Australia. Some of the tropical species are known for their bright, butterfly-like colors and are called sunset moths (for example &quot;Chrysiridia rhipheus&quot;). Such moths are apparently toxic and the bright colors are a warning to predators.

The family Uraniidae contains both diurnal and nocturnal species. The day-flying species are usually more strikingly colored and vibrant than the nocturnal ones. Many diurnal species also have iridescent scales and multiple tails, which often led them to be mistaken for butterflies. In sharp contrast, the nocturnal species are generally small, pale-colored insects. The Uraniidae are similar to the geometer moths, to which they are related, but a different wing veining pattern distinguishes them.

<doc id="1038760" wikidata="Q1133600" url="?curid=1038760" title="Deep Forest">
<text>Deep Forest is a French music project that originally began as a duo consisting of Michel Sanchez and Éric Mouquet. They compose a style of world music, sometimes called ethnic electronica, mixing ethnic with electronic sounds and dance beats or chillout beats. Their sound has been described as an &quot;ethno-introspective ambient world music&quot;.

They were nominated for a Grammy Award in 1994 for Best World Music Album, and in 1995 they won the Award for the album &quot;Boheme&quot;. The group also became World Music Awards Winner – French group with the highest 1995 world sales. Their albums have sold over 10 million copies. Sanchez started his own career as a singer in 2005, while Mouquet continued working under the band&#x27;s original name.

== History ==

Michel Sanchez came up with the idea of mixing the native Baka pygmy spoken word with modern music after hearing on-site recordings of these tribes conversing. Along with Eric Mouquet they created the project Deep Forest. Their first self-titled album (nominated for a Grammy) was released in 1992, with &quot;Sweet Lullaby&quot; being the smash single which would put Deep Forest on the musical map (UK Top 10 hit). The song &quot;Sweet Lullaby&quot; is adapted from a traditional song from the Solomon Islands. A lullaby named &quot;Rorogwela&quot;, sung by Afunakwa, a Northern Malaita woman, was used as a vocal sample in the &quot;Sweet Lullaby&quot;. The album &quot;Deep Forest&quot; was dance-driven and the samples were heavily digitised and edited. It was re-released as a limited edition in 1994 under the name &quot;World Mix&quot;. &quot;Sweet Lullaby&quot; also uses Baka water drumming in the background. 

For their second album &quot;Boheme&quot;, Eric and Michel left behind the sounds of the forest and ventured into Eastern Europe bringing tender, lonesome Hungarian and Roma chants with upbeat, yet sad, music. Due to this shift, Dan Lacksman (from Telex, producer and sound-engineer of the first album) decided to go his separate way and continued working on other projects like Pangea. The chants were no longer brief, instead extended phrases had been sampled from Hungarian, and Russian. Hungarian singer Márta Sebestyén and Bulgarian Kate Petrova performed on this album. 
The duo also performed and produced the remixes for the Youssou N&#x27;Dour single &quot;Undecided&quot; in 1994, with guest vocals by Neneh Cherry (who featured on n&#x27;Dour&#x27;s break-through single &quot;Seven Seconds&quot;). That same year Deep Forest made remixes for Jon Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Deseo&quot;, Apollo 440&#x27;s &quot;Liquid Cool&quot; and Cesária Évora&#x27;s &quot;My Fatigue is Endless&quot;. In 1996 Deep Forest collaborated with Peter Gabriel on the song &quot;While the Earth Sleeps&quot; which was written for the film &quot;Strange Days&quot;.

The follow-up third album, &quot;Comparsa&quot;, contained Spanish chants and sounds. The music is often upbeat and celebratory. The last song from the album, &quot;Media Luna&quot;, which was also released as a single, features a duet of Syrian and Spanish singers Abed Azrei and Ana Torroja.The duo collaborated with Joe Zawinul on the song Deep Weather during the recording of the album.
Also Jorge Reyes (late Mexican musician), collaborated in this album with percussion, vocals and the flute.

A recording of their live concert in Japan was also released on a CD called &quot;Made in Japan&quot;. Although all the songs featured in the show are from the previous three albums, they have new often-longer arrangements and all the chants are performed and reinterpreted by live performers.

In 1999 Deep Forest worked with Cheb Mami and Catherine Lara on the song &quot;L&#x27;Enfant Fleur&quot; which had been composed for Sol En Si (a French charity which helps HIV families).

In 2000, Deep Forest released their fourth album, &quot;Pacifique&quot;. This album was composed to support the movie &quot;Le prince du Pacifique&quot; It mixes Pacific and island beats with electronic music.

&quot;Music Detected&quot; was the title of their fifth much-anticipated official Deep Forest album which saw the duo turn its attention to the Far East and the Orient for inspiration. It also signalled a change in musical style for Deep Forest, from dance to a more rock-influence. They collaborated with Indonesian pop musician Anggun on the bilingual song &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; which served as the lead single.

In 2003 Deep Forest released a compilation album &quot;Essence of the Forest&quot;, with some remastered tracks.
In 2004 Deep Forest collaborated with Josh Groban, he composed and produced 2 songs on the album Closer.
In 2006 Deep Forest collaborated with Josh Groban on the album Awake. 
In 2008 Deep Forest released the album Deep Brasil, a collaboration with Brazilian artist Flavio Dell Isola.
During 2009-2010 Deep Forest went with a new band formula on stage and Deep Forest performed in different countries and continents (China, Africa, the United States, Japan, France...).
In 2014 Deep Forest Released the Album &quot;Deep Africa&quot;

In 2013 Sony music India released Deep India, a Deep Forest and Rahul Sharma collaboration.

In 2017, the band collaborated with Ukrainian folk project Onuka on the song &quot;VSESVIT&quot;. The track is part of Onuka&#x27;s second studio album &quot;MOZAїKA&quot;

==Music for films==
In 1994, Deep Forest appeared on the soundtrack for Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Prêt-à-Porter&quot; with the song &quot;Martha&quot;.

Deep Forest was hired to provide a full original score for the 1995 movie &quot;Strange Days&quot; and their credit appears on early advertising for the film. In the end, the score was instead composed by Graeme Revell. One cue from Deep Forest&#x27;s original music remains in the film, titled &quot;Coral Lounge&quot;. Deep Forest also teamed with Peter Gabriel to write an original song, &quot;While the Earth Sleeps&quot;, for the film&#x27;s end credits. In addition, two tracks from Deep Forest&#x27;s album &quot;Boheme&quot; were featured in the film - &quot;Anasthasia&quot; and &quot;Bohemian Ballet. The two new Deep Forest tracks, &quot;Coral Lounge&quot; and &quot;While the Earth Sleeps&quot;, were included on the film&#x27;s soundtrack album. The version of &quot;While the Earth Sleeps&quot; on the album is an edited version. The complete film version was released by Columbia as a CD single in Austria and Japan.

One of Deep Forest&#x27;s songs, &quot;Night Bird&quot;, was used in the 1996 film version of &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot;.

In December 2000, Deep Forest composed a soundtrack for the French film &quot;Le Prince du Pacifique&quot;. The album, entitled &quot;Pacifique&quot;, is a return to a more ambient and melancholy sound, with piano themes riding above moody synth textures, Pacific Island chants, scratchy synth-leads and electronic drumming.

In 2004 the duo composed a soundtrack for the Japanese film &quot;Kusa No Ran&quot;. A remix of &quot;Sweet Lullaby&quot; was also used for Matt Harding&#x27;s viral hit &quot;Where the Hell is Matt?&quot;

==Side projects==
Both Sanchez and Mouquet have worked over a variety of side-projects and solo albums. Sanchez has two solo albums out and produced Wes successful debut album; while Mouquet created the group Dao Dezi, collaborated with Catherine Lara and arranged Thorgal, he composed and produced songs for Ana Torroja (Mecano), Jean Sebastien Lavoie, and composed and produced songs for Josh Groban.

==Live performances==
Deep Forest had their first live concert in 1996 at the G7 Summit in Lyon, France. They continued from there on to the Deep Forest &#x27;96 world tour. During the 1996 tour, Deep Forest performed a number of shows in France, Hungary, Greece, Australia, Japan, Poland and US. After the completion of Comparsa there was a &#x27;98 world tour. Since &#x27;98 there have been numerous live performances, including the Image Concerts, which took place in Japan. The concerts were based around the &#x27;Image&#x27; album (similar to Pure Moods) and featured a number of famous Japanese artists, also including Deep Forest.

==Donations==
A percentage of proceeds from Deep Forest&#x27;s debut album sales went to the Pygmy Fund, set up to aid the Democratic Republic of the Congo&#x27;s Efe pygmies in the transition from nomadic to agrarian subsistence, and to provide appropriate health care. However, music of the Efe people was not included on the record, and so the musicians sampled on the record would not have benefited.
A portion of the proceeds from &#x27;Boheme&#x27; go to the György Martin Foundation, which aids in protecting the Roma culture of Hungary.
Deep Forest also actively supports the Sana Madagascar Association starting with &#x27;Comparsa&#x27;. &quot;The aim of the Sana Madagascar Association is to contribute protecting the environment, to collect instruments and precious recordings in order to allow the Malagasy man to save his culture, his nature and his traditional music.&quot;

== Controversy ==
The song &quot;Freedom Cry&quot; from the album &quot;Boheme&quot; caused controversy when it was revealed that the Hungarian Roma singer, Károly Rostás (&quot;Huttyán&quot;), never received any monetary compensation from the song, and neither did his family after he died in 1986. His singing, archived by Claude Flagel, was sampled by Deep Forest. Flagel allegedly paid Huttyán (about in 1986) for the recording. The case was later documented in a movie entitled &quot;Huttyán&quot;, released in 1996.
The relatives did succeed to some extent in getting compensation from Deep Forest.

Deep Forest&#x27;s signature song &quot;Sweet Lullaby&quot; centres on an uncredited recording of ancestral Baegu lullaby &quot;Rorogwela&quot;, from Malaita, sung by a woman named Afunakwa, and recorded by ethnomusicologist Hugo Zemp. The recording was used without authorization from Afunakwa, Zemp, label UNESCO discs or distributor Auvidis, although Zemp had earlier reluctantly given oral permission for an unrelated recording to be used. The Deep Forest project has since become a &quot;cause celèbre&quot; as an example of primitivist caricature and cultural appropriation.

== Influences ==

Mouquet was influenced by his interests in house and techno music.

<doc id="1038761" wikidata="Q358193" url="?curid=1038761" title="Steve Reeves">
<text>Stephen Lester Reeves (January 21, 1926 – May 1, 2000) was an American professional bodybuilder and actor. He was famous in the mid-1950s as a movie star in Italian-made sword-and-sandal films, playing the protagonist as muscular characters such as Hercules, Goliath, and Sandokan. At the peak of his career, he was the highest-paid actor in Europe. Though best known for his portrayal of Hercules, he played the character only twice: in &quot;Hercules&quot; (1958), and in its 1959 sequel &quot;Hercules Unchained&quot;. By 1960, Reeves was ranked as the number-one box-office draw in 25 countries.

Prior to his acting career, Reeves was a bodybuilder. Known for his symmetry, he reigned as Mr. America of 1947, Mr. World of 1948, and Mr. Universe of 1950 in the pre Mr. Olympia era. Credited with popularising bodybuilding on a global level, he is regarded as one of the most influential bodybuilders of all time. As an author, he wrote &quot;Powerwalking&quot;, and two self-published books, &quot;Building the Classic Physique - The Natural Way&quot;, and &quot;Dynamic Muscle Building&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Glasgow, Montana, in 1926, Reeves moved to California at age 10 with his mother Goldie Reeves after his father Lester Dell Reeves died in a farming accident. Reeves developed an interest in bodybuilding at Castlemont High School and trained at Ed Yarick&#x27;s gym in Oakland, California. After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the United States Army during World War II, and served in the Philippines. After his military service Reeves attended California Chiropractic College in San Francisco.

==Bodybuilding career==

As a bodybuilder, Reeves trained three days a week. Every workout was a full-body workout, as opposed to a split workout. He did the standard three sets of 8 to 12 repetitions per exercise. 
During training he had no regard for time but worked until he had completed his routine, which took anywhere from two to four hours. He reigned as Mr. America of 1947, Mr. World of 1948, and Mr. Universe of 1950 in the pre Mr. Olympia era. He was contacted by an agent who suggested he go into acting.

Reeves wrote the book &quot;Powerwalking&quot;, and two self-published books, &quot;Building the Classic Physique - The Natural Way&quot;, and &quot;Dynamic Muscle Building&quot;. George Helmer published a revised and updated edition of the &quot;Powerwalking&quot; book in 2013.

==Acting career==
===Cecil B. de Mille===
Reeves moved to New York where he studied acting under Stella Adler, but after arguments he was refunded his tuition. He studied instead at the Theodora Irvin School of the Theatre. He began performing a vaudeville act with a comedian named Dick Burney. One of Cecil B. De Mille&#x27;s talent scouts saw him and had him tested for &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (1949). Reeves received a seven-year contract with Paramount. Reeves stated that De Mille wanted to cast him in the lead role, but told Reeves he had to lose 15 pounds in order to look convincing on-camera. Reeves says he tried to lose the weight and worked on his acting in preparation for the role over three months. Then, De Mille told him he was going to give the role to Victor Mature.

===Early acting appearances===
In 1949, Reeves filmed a Tarzan-type television pilot called &quot;Kimbar of the Jungle&quot;, and in 1950 became Mr. Universe. He appeared on television in &quot;Stars Over Hollywood &quot; in the episode &quot;Prison Doctor&quot; with Raymond Burr. He appeared on the TV series &quot;Topper&quot; (&quot;Reducing&quot;).

In 1954, Reeves had a small supporting role as a cop in the Ed Wood film &quot;Jail Bait&quot;. It was his first film and earned him his Screen Actors Guild card. &quot;I had a suit on at all times,&quot; he later recalled. &quot;I even had a tie. Only took my shirt off once. Those were the days, huh?&quot;

The same year Reeves was in the MGM musical &quot;Athena&quot;, playing the boyfriend of Jane Powell&#x27;s character.

Reeves guest-starred on &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot; as the owner of a gym. In 1955, Reeves appeared in two Broadway shows, &quot;Kismet&quot; and &quot;The Vamp&quot;. Pictures of Reeves&#x27; costume test for the lead in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; (1959) can be found on the Internet. He worked for American Health Studios in public relations, opening up fitness studios. That same year he married his first wife, teenaged starlet Sandra Smith.

===&quot;Hercules&quot;===

In Italy, director Pietro Francisci wanted to make a film about Hercules but could not find anyone suitable to play the role. His daughter recommended Reeves on the basis of his appearance in &quot;Athena&quot; and Francisci offered him the role and a plane ticket to Italy. Reeves at first did not think he was serious but eventually agreed and flew to Italy to make the film. His fee was $10,000. &quot;Hercules&quot; was a relatively low-budget epic based loosely on the tales of Jason and the Argonauts, though inserting Hercules into the lead role.

The film proved popular in Europe. What made it an international sensation was that US distribution rights were bought by Joseph E. Levine, who promoted it and turned it into a major box-office success, grossing $5 million in the United States in 1959. However this did not happen until Reeves had already made four more films in Europe.

The first was a sequel to &quot;Hercules&quot;, &quot;Hercules Unchained&quot; (1959), again directed by Francisci. Reeves was paid the same fee, although his wage would double from then on. This film was another huge success, being the third most popular film in Britain in 1960. Nonetheless Reeves would not play Hercules again, despite his identification with the role. Reeves&#x27; third film as star was &quot;The White Warrior&quot; (1959), based on &quot;Hadji Murat&quot;, the novel by Leo Tolstoy. He played Hadji Murad, a 19th-century Avar naib who led his warriors in raids against the Russians invading his homelands in the North Caucasus (modern-day Dagestan and Chechnya).
Reeves also played Emilio in &quot;Terror of the Barbarians&quot;, about the Lombard invasion of Italy. American International Pictures bought US rights and retitled it &quot;Goliath and the Barbarians&quot; (1959), with Reeves&#x27;s character renamed &quot;Goliath&quot;. The film earned $1.6 million in North America during its initial release, when it was double billed with &quot;Sign of the Gladiator&quot;.

===Injury===
Reeves portrayed Glaucus Leto in &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; (1959), based on the novel by Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton. It co-starred Christine Kaufmann and Fernando Rey and was mostly directed by Sergio Leone. During the filming, Reeves dislocated his shoulder when his chariot slammed into a tree; he re-injured it while swimming in a subsequent underwater escape scene. The injury would be aggravated by his stunt work in each successive film, ultimately leading to his retirement from filmmaking.

===American directors===
Reeves followed this with &quot;The Giant of Marathon&quot; (1959) where he was cast as Pheidippides, the famous wartime messenger of the Battle of Marathon. By now Reeves&#x27; success was such that his films would use Hollywood directors: &quot;Marathon&quot; was directed by Mario Bava and Jacques Tourneur. According to MGM records the film earned $1,335,000 in the US and Canada and $1.4 million elsewhere resulting in a profit of $429,000.

Reeves had a change of pace in &quot;Morgan the Pirate&quot; (1960) where he played pirate and occasional governor of Jamaica, Captain Henry Morgan. Andre de Toth and Primo Zeglio directed.
He then did an &quot;Eastern&quot;, &quot;The Thief of Baghdad&quot; (1961), playing Karim, directed by Arthur Lubin. In &quot;The Trojan Horse (film)&quot; (1961) Reeves played Aeneas of Troy, opposite John Drew Barrymore. He co-starred with fellow body builder Gordon Scott in &quot;Duel of the Titans&quot; (1961), playing Romulus and Remus respectively. Sergio Corbucci directed. Reeves played Randus, the son of Spartacus in &quot;The Slave&quot; (1962) then reprised his role as Aeneas in &quot;The Avenger (1962 film)&quot; (1962) aka &quot;The Legend of Aeneas&quot;.

===Later roles===

Reeves played Sandokan in two films, both directed by Umberto Lenzi: &quot;Sandokan the Great&quot; (1963) and &quot;Pirates of Malaysia&quot; (1964). Reeves said that by this stage his fee was $250,000 a film. In 1968, Reeves appeared in his final film, a spaghetti Western he co-wrote, titled &quot;I Live For Your Death!&quot; (later released as &quot;A Long Ride From Hell&quot;). &quot;I ended up with an ulcer from that,&quot; he said later. &quot;That was my last.&quot;

Reeves reportedly turned down the James Bond role in &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962) because of the low salary the producers offered. Reeves also declined the role that finally went to Clint Eastwood in &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; (1964) because he did not believe that Italians could make a western out of a Japanese samurai film.

George Pal contacted Reeves for the role of Doc Savage in &quot;Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze&quot;, the first of what was meant to be a film series, but when filming was about to begin a Hollywood writers strike put the film on hold with Reeves and the original director replaced. Reeves&#x27;s last screen appearance was in 2000 when he appeared as himself in the made-for-television &quot;A&amp;E Biography: Arnold Schwarzenegger Flex Appeal&quot;.

===Post-acting===
Reeves decided to retire for several reasons: stress, his injury, and the decline in the market for his sort of movies. He had earned enough to retire and moved to the Suncrest Stock Ranch he purchased in Jacksonville just outside of Medford, Oregon – north of the California border. He later purchased a ranch in Valley Center, California. It would be his home for the rest of his life. Reeves bred horses and promoted drug-free bodybuilding. The last two decades of his life were spent in Valley Center, where he lived with his second wife, Aline, until her death in 1989.

==Other interests==
Reeves&#x27; authorized biography, &quot;Steve Reeves – One of a Kind&quot;, was published in 1983 by Milton T. Moore. Moore worked with Reeves and Steve&#x27;s wife at the time, Aline, for over 12 years before receiving publishing approval. Reeves was reportedly to promote the book at public appearances.

In 1991, writer Chris LeClaire began writing and researching Steve Reeves&#x27; life and career for a biography. In 1999, LeClaire published &quot;Worlds To Conquer&quot;, which LeClaire described as an authorized biography. Deborah Reeves Stewart, Reeves&#x27; companion during the book&#x27;s development phases, who assisted him in reviewing drafts, stated that Reeves never approved or authorized &quot;Worlds to Conquer&quot; for final publication or release, due to inaccuracies, careless writing, and failure to add Reeves&#x27; final comments.

In 1994, Reeves, with long-time friend and business partner George Helmer, started the Steve Reeves International Society.

Freelance writer Rod Labbe interviewed Reeves in 1997, and the article appeared in &quot;Films of the Golden Age&quot; magazine, summer 2011.

==Death==
Reeves had exploratory surgery late Friday afternoon on April 28, 2000, while being treated for lymphoma, and died shortly before noon from a blood clot on Monday, May 1, 2000. He died at Palomar Hospital in Escondido, California, where his second wife had also died.

<doc id="1038764" wikidata="Q461891" url="?curid=1038764" title="Svalbard Treaty">
<text>The Svalbard Treaty (originally the Spitsbergen Treaty) recognises the sovereignty of Norway over the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, at the time called Spitsbergen. The exercise of sovereignty is, however, subject to certain stipulations, and not all Norwegian law applies. The treaty restricts military uses of the archipelago, but it is not demilitarized. The signatories were given equal rights to engage in commercial activities (mainly coal mining) on the islands. , Norway and Russia make use of this right.

Uniquely, the archipelago is an entirely visa-free zone under the terms of the Svalbard Treaty.

The treaty was signed on 9 February 1920 and submitted for registration in the &quot;League of Nations Treaty Series&quot; on 21 October 1920. There were 14 original High Contracting Parties: Denmark, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom (including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and India), and the United States. Of the original signatories, Japan was the last to ratify the treaty on 2 April 1925, and the treaty came into force on 14 August 1925.

Many additional nations acceded to the treaty after it was ratified by the original signatories, including several before it came into force. , there are 48 parties to the treaty.

==Name of the treaty==
The original treaty is titled the &quot;Treaty recognising the sovereignty of Norway over the Archipelago of Spitsbergen&quot;. It refers to the entire archipelago as &quot;Spitsbergen&quot;, which had been the only name in common usage since 1596 (with minor variations in spelling). In 1925, five years after the conclusion of the treaty, the Norwegian authorities proceeded to officially rename the islands &quot;Svalbard&quot;. This new name was a modern adaptation of the ancient toponym , attested in the Norse sagas as early as 1194. The exonym &quot;Spitsbergen&quot; subsequently came to be applied to the main island in the archipelago. Accordingly, in modern historiography the &quot;Treaty of Spitsbergen&quot; is commonly referred to anachronistically as the Svalbard Treaty to reflect the name change.

==History==
The archipelago was discovered by the Dutch explorer Willem Barentsz in 1596. It was named Spitsbergen, meaning &#x27;sharp-peaked mountains&#x27; (literally &#x27;spits-berg&#x27;). It was uninhabited. The islands were renamed in the 1920s by Norway as Svalbard.

Spitsbergen/Svalbard began as a territory free of a nation, with people from different countries participating in industries including fishing, whaling, mining, research and later, tourism. Not belonging to any nation left Svalbard largely free of regulations or laws, though there were conflicts over the area due to whaling rights and sovereignty disputes between England, the Netherlands and Denmark–Norway in the first half of the 17th century. By the 20th century mineral deposits were found on the main island and continual conflicts between miners and owners created the need for a government.

==Contents==
The Spitsbergen Treaty was signed in Paris on 9 February 1920, during the Versailles negotiations after World War I. In this treaty, international diplomacy recognized Norwegian sovereignty (the Norwegian administration went in effect by 1925) and other principles relating to Svalbard. This includes:

* Svalbard is part of Norway: Svalbard is completely controlled by and forms part of the Kingdom of Norway. However, Norway&#x27;s power over Svalbard is restricted by the limitations listed below:
* Taxation: Taxes are allowed to be collected, but only enough to support Svalbard and the Svalbard government. This results in lower taxes than mainland Norway and the exclusion of any taxes on Svalbard supporting mainland Norway directly. Svalbard&#x27;s revenues and expenses are separately budgeted from mainland Norway.
* Environmental conservation: Norway must respect and preserve the Svalbard environment.
* Non-discrimination: All citizens and all companies of every nation under the treaty are allowed to become residents and to have access to Svalbard including the right to fish, hunt or undertake any kind of maritime, industrial, mining or trade activity. The residents of Svalbard must follow Norwegian law, though Norwegian authority cannot discriminate against or favour any residents of any given nationality. Russia has exercised this right of residency and in 2022 announced new investment plans to support its presence at Barentsburg and Pyramiden.
* Military restrictions: Article 9 prohibits naval bases and fortifications and also the use of Svalbard for war-like purposes. Norway interprets this provision as still permitting access to the territory by the Norwegian Armed Forces to exercise sovereignty and protect the environment. This largely encompasses visits by Norwegian military forces, particularly Norwegian Coast Guard vessels, to the territory. However, certain other signatory states, particularly Russia, dispute this interpretation. Notably, while Norway maintains that it has exclusive rights under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to the continental shelf around Svalbard, Russia rejects this position. Russia also objects to Norwegian or NATO military activities around Svalbard which, Russia claims, undermine the treaty’s military restrictions.

==Disputes regarding natural resources==
There has been a long-running dispute, primarily between Norway and Russia (and before it, the Soviet Union) over fishing rights in the region. In 1977, Norway established a regulated fishery in a zone around Svalbard (though it did not close the zone to foreign access). Norway argues that the treaty&#x27;s provisions of equal economic access apply only to the islands and their territorial waters (four nautical miles at the time) but not to the wider exclusive economic zone. In addition, it argues that the continental shelf is a part of mainland Norway&#x27;s continental shelf and should be governed by the 1958 Continental Shelf Convention. The Soviet Union/Russia disputed and continues to dispute this position and consider the Spitsbergen Treaty to apply to the entire zone. Talks were held in 1978 in Moscow but did not resolve the issue. Finland and Canada support Norway&#x27;s position, while most of the other treaty signatories have expressed no official position. The relevant parts of the treaty are as follows:
Ships and nationals of all the High Contracting Parties shall enjoy equally the rights of fishing and hunting in the territories specified in Article 1 and in their territorial waters. (from Article 2)
They shall be admitted under the same conditions of equality to the exercise and practice of all maritime, industrial, mining or commercial enterprises both on land and in the territorial waters, and no monopoly shall be established on any account or for any enterprise whatever. (from Article 3)

&quot;Mainly the dispute is about whether the Svalbard Treaty also is in effect outside the 12 nautical mile territorial sea,&quot; according to Norway&#x27;s largest newspaper, &quot;Aftenposten&quot;. If the treaty comes into effect outside the zone, then Norway will not be able to claim the full 78% of profits of oil- and gas harvesting, said &quot;Aftenposten&quot; in 2011.

<doc id="1038765" wikidata="Q707708" url="?curid=1038765" title="Cedric Bixler-Zavala">
<text>Cedric Bixler-Zavala (born November 4, 1974) is an American musician. He has been the lead singer and lyricist of the progressive rock band the Mars Volta since its inception in 2001. He was the lead singer and only constant member of the post-hardcore group At the Drive-In, the lead singer of the band Antemasque, and singer and guitarist in the band Zavalaz.

==Early life==
Cedric Bixler-Zavala was born as Cedric Bixler in Redwood City, California. His father, Dennis Bixler-Marquez, was born in Mexico City to a white American man of partial German ancestry and a Mexican woman. His mother, Rosa Zavala, is Mexican-American and was born in El Paso. His father is a professor of Chicano Studies at UTEP. His parents were bilingual, but Bixler-Zavala says his command of proper Spanish is limited to &quot;Spanglish&quot;. His Spanish maternal surname, Zavala, is a Castilian version of Zabala, of Basque origin.

In the early 1990s, Bixler-Zavala played drums and was a vocalist for a band named Foss which included Beto O&#x27;Rourke on bass before the latter&#x27;s political career.

==Career==
Under the pseudonym &quot;Alavaz Relxib Cirdec&quot; (&quot;Cedric Bixler-Zavala&quot; backwards), Bixler-Zavala contributed a two-song single to the GSL Special 12-inch Singles Series, released in December 2005. Closer to the dub of De Facto and the ambient experimentation shown in Omar Rodríguez-López&#x27;s records than the prog-rock of the Mars Volta, the two songs Bixler-Zavala has produced under this alias are entirely instrumental.

In 2010, he commented on Facebook about the recording process:

Late 2011 saw the release of the first 7-inch record from Bixler&#x27;s new project Anywhere, a collaboration with Christian Eric Beaulieu of Triclops! and Mike Watt of The Stooges/Firehose/Minutemen. Their self-titled debut album was released by ATP Records in June 2012.

In 2011, Bixler began working on another album, which he described as &quot;mostly ballady type stuff... a very Sunday morning record. Very soft&quot;. Eventually the solo project turned into a full-fledged band named Zavalaz, which features Bixler on lead vocals and guitar, Dan Elkan on guitar, Juan Alderete on bass and Gregory Rogove on drums. The band is set to play a number of West Coast tour dates throughout June, supported by Dot Hacker and EV Kain. On June 3, 2013, a snippet from song &quot;Blue Rose of Grand Street&quot; off their upcoming album &quot;All the Nights We Never Met&quot; was released on YouTube.

Bixler-Zavala returned to the studio after reuniting with Omar Rodríguez-López due to Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist, Flea, wanting them to reunite. In 2014 they formed a supergroup together called Antemasque with ex-Mars Volta drummer Dave Elitch. The band recorded and released their debut in 2014. Fans have cited that as Flea and Dave have played with the Mars Volta prior, a Mars Volta reunion could be in the works. (Flea played bass on 2003&#x27;s De-loused in the Comatorium and trumpet on 2005&#x27;s &quot;Frances the Mute&quot;; Dave played with the Mars Volta from 2009 to 2010.) In February 2018, Bixler Zavala confirmed on Twitter that the Mars Volta would reunite, but later clarified that At the Drive-In activity will take precedence for the immediate future.

==Artistry==
Bixler-Zavala has a tenor voice type with a vocal range spanning from G#2 to D6, in addition to a speculated possible range reaching as low as E2 and as high as C7. His vocal work spans many different styles, ranging from consistent rhythmic shouts (common in his singing with At the Drive-In) to controlled falsetto and head voice singing (a familiar trademark of his singing with the Mars Volta). In 2016, it was also revealed that Bixler-Zavala developed vocal nodules, causing shows to be canceled while on tour.

Bixler-Zavala is fond of Frank Zappaesque humor and writes in English, Spanglish, and Latin. His lyrics have a wide vocabulary and often feature complicated wordplay. Bixler-Zavala also uses portmanteaus: combining existing words, or parts of words, to create a new word. The song &quot;Noctourniquet&quot;, for example, combines &quot;nocturnal&quot; (active at night) and &quot;tourniquet&quot; (a medical device to stop bleeding). He has stated: &quot;I love to take common sayings, pervert them, mutate them a little. So you think I am singing one thing, but when you read it, it is different.&quot; He has described Mark E. Smith of The Fall as &quot;one of the pillars of influence for me as a lyricist&quot;.
When performing with At the Drive-in and The Mars Volta, Bixler-Zavala is known for his eccentric on-stage behavior. He frequently does somersaults on stage, swings his microphone (once unintentionally hitting bandmate Ikey Owens in the head), throws objects such as cymbals, microphone stands, and trash cans into the audience, salsa dances, adjusts Omar Rodríguez-López&#x27;s effects pedals and occasionally plays the maracas.

==Personal life==
In 2009, Bixler-Zavala married actress and model Chrissie Carnell. The couple reside in Los Angeles, California. They had their first children, twin boys Ulysses and Xanthus, in 2013. In November 2017, he said in a pair of tweets that actor Danny Masterson had sexually assaulted his wife, and that he wrote At the Drive-In&#x27;s song &quot;Incurably Innocent&quot; about the alleged incident.

Bixler-Zavala is a former member of the Church of Scientology and had credited Scientology with his changed attitude on the use of drugs. He attended the Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre event in 2013. In 2015, Bixler-Zavala spoke about his decision to stop smoking marijuana. &quot;I was spending $1,000 a week on weed&quot;, he said, and rationalized his use by believing it made him more creative, when he later came to realize &quot;I was using it to form this stoned bubble that helped me justify not wanting to interact with people.&quot; However, by 2017 he had become a harsh critic of Scientology, calling its &quot;self help volcano[...] as barren as a floating needle. A placebo of Sugary kool aid&quot; and accusing it of silencing sexual assault victims and of harassing both him and his wife; in 2018, he accused it of covering up his wife&#x27;s alleged sexual assault and called it &quot;a modern-day version of &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;&quot;.

In 2020, Bixler-Zavala&#x27;s dog died after allegedly eating raw meat laced with rat poison that had been tossed into their yard. Bixler-Zavala alleged that the Church of Scientology was responsible, though they have denied the accusations.

Bixler-Zavala&#x27;s life has been heavily impacted by the deaths of people who have been in close association with him, several of which have become themes for his lyrics. Jimmy Hernandez, bass player for Los Dregtones, died of cancer in 1994. The year after, the original drummer for At the Drive-In, Bernie Rincon, died by suicide. In 1996, a close friend and band-mate of Bixler-Zavala&#x27;s, Los Dregtones bassist Julio Venegas, also died by suicide. The story behind the Mars Volta&#x27;s first album &quot;De-Loused in the Comatorium&quot; was loosely inspired by &quot;life and death of Julio Venegas&quot;. During the following year, two of his bandmates of the group The Fall on Deaf Ears, Laura Beard and Sarah Reiser, died in a car accident. In May 2003, their sound manipulator and longtime friend of Bixler-Zavala and Omar Rodríguez-López, Jeremy Ward, was found dead of apparent heroin overdose. In October 2014, Isaiah &quot;Ikey&quot; Owens, former bandmate and keyboardist for Bixler-Zavala&#x27;s previous bands De Facto and the Mars Volta (the latter from 2001 to 2010), was found dead in Puebla, Mexico, while on tour with Jack White. Owens was 39 years old and his cause of death was later confirmed to be a heart attack.

Bixler-Zavala endorsed 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and denounced the support of Joe Biden by his former Foss bandmate and 2020 presidential candidate Beto O&#x27;Rourke. In response to a fan on Instagram who said that O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s support of Biden &quot;bummed me out bad&quot;, Bixler-Zavala said &quot;me too.&quot;

<text>Pierre Ryckmans (28 September 1935 – 11 August 2014), better known by his pen name Simon Leys, was a Belgian-Australian writer, essayist and literary critic, translator, art historian, sinologist, and university professor, who lived in Australia from 1970. His work particularly focused on the politics and traditional culture of China, calligraphy, French and English literature, the commercialization of universities, and nautical fiction. Through the publication of his trilogy &quot;Les Habits neufs du président Mao&quot; (1971), &quot;Ombres chinoises&quot; (1974) and &quot;Images brisées&quot; (1976), he denounced the Cultural Revolution in China and the idolizing of Mao in the West.

==Biography==
Pierre Ryckmans was born in Uccle, an upper-middle-class district of Brussels, to a prominent Belgian family living in a house on Avenue des Aubépines. He was the son of a publisher, the grandson of Alfonse Ryckmans, an Antwerp alderman and vice president of the Senate, the nephew of Pierre Ryckmans, a governor general of the Belgian Congo, and Gonzague Ryckmans, a professor at the Université catholique de Louvain and a recognized expert of Arabic epigraphy.

He attended the Servites de Marie primary school near his home, then studied Greek and Latin humanities at the Cardinal Mercier diocesan school in Braine-l&#x27;Alleud. There, one of his teachers, abbé Voussure, &quot;finished ingraining in him an unwavering Christian faith.&quot;

From 1953 he studied law and art history at the Université catholique de Louvain.

In 1955, his father died prematurely. In May, he became a member of a delegation of ten young Belgians invited to spend a month in China. During that visit he took part in a conversation with Zhou Enlai, the Premier of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. As a result, he became sympathetic to the Maoist regime: &quot;I confidently extended to the Maoist regime the same sympathy that I felt for all things Chinese.&quot; He returned from the trip with the view that &quot;it would be inconceivable to live in this world, in our age, without a good knowledge of Chinese language and a direct access to Chinese culture&quot;.

Upon his return to Belgium, he finished his studies in art history and began to learn calligraphy.

In the summer of 1958, he travelled to Étel, a port in French Brittany, to board one of the last remaining tuna boats. The account he wrote of the fishing expedition was only published 45 years later, under the title &quot;Prosper&quot;.

After being awarded a small bursary from the Chiang Kai-shek government, he enrolled at the Fine Arts department of the National Taiwan University. There he studied under the guidance of Puru, a cousin of Puyi, the last emperor, and did some research for his future PhD dissertation on Shitao, a Chinese painter at the time of the Qing empire.

After completing his studies in Taiwan in 1960, he was called up for military service in Belgium. Instead, he chose to become a conscientious objector and perform civil service in the field of development cooperation for the next three years. First, thanks to the intervention of Eurasian writer Han Suyin, he was able to take up a part-time student and teaching job at Nanyang University in Singapore. However, in 1963, under suspicion of being a communist by the Lee Kuan Yew regime, he had to pack up and leave for Hong Kong, at the time a British colony.

For two years he taught at the New Asia College, one of the colleges of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He lived in a Kowloon squatter area, sharing with three friends a small accommodation they dubbed Wu Yong Tang (《無用堂》the &quot;hall of uselessness&quot;) and living a life redolent of an Eastern &quot;Scènes de la vie de bohème&quot;.

He supplemented his income by writing summaries of articles from the mainland Chinese press and collecting testimonies from refugees from the mainland on behalf of the Belgian diplomatic delegation. He also gleaned information from &quot;China News Analysis&quot;, a weekly publication produced in Hong Kong by the Jesuit scholar Father László Ladány. These reports would become the basis of his 1971 book &quot;Les Habits neufs du président Mao&quot; (translated as &quot;The Chairman&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;).

He also taught courses at the local Alliance française. In 1964, he married Han Fang Chang, a journalist he met in Taiwan, and became the father of twins in 1967.

While in Hong Kong, Ryckmans was introduced to French sinologist René Viénet, then a member of the Situationist International, by another sinologist, Jacques Pimpaneau, whom he had met at the New Asian College. René Viénet, who took the view that Chinese press reports on the Cultural Revolution were less sanitized than the writings of Western journalists and sinologists, obtained Pierre Ryckmans&#x27;s agreement for his essay &quot;Les Habits neufs du président Mao&quot; to be published in Paris by Champ Libre, a publishing house run by Gérard Lebovici.

For his PhD thesis, Ryckmans chose to translate and comment on a masterpiece of the history of Chinese art, the treatise on painting by Shitao. It was published in 1970 by the Institut Belge des Hautes Etudes Chinoises in Brussels, under the title &quot;Propos sur la peinture du moine Citrouille-amère de Shitao. Contribution à l&#x27;étude terminologique des théories chinoises de la peinture&quot;.

On his publisher&#x27;s advice, he decided to assume a pen name to avoid being declared &quot;persona non grata&quot; in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. He chose &quot;Simon&quot; as his first name, a reference to the original name of the Apostle Peter, and &quot;Leys&quot; as his second name, a tribute to the main character of Victor Segalen&#x27;s &quot;René Leys&quot; published in 1922, in which a Belgian teenager residing in Peking in the final days of the Qing Dynasty entertains his employer with accounts of the intrigues and conspiracies taking place behind the walls of the imperial palace. It is also suggested that his nom de plume is an allusion to a dynasty of painters from Antwerp under the name of Leys, with Henri Leys as its most famous representative.

In 1970 Ryckmans settled in Australia and he taught Chinese literature at the Australian National University in Canberra, where he supervised the honours thesis of future Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.

He returned to China in 1972 for six months as a cultural attaché for the Belgian Embassy in Beijing.

In 1983 Ryckmans appeared on the literary talk show &quot;Apostrophes&quot; on French television. The host, Bernard Pivot, had also invited Maria-Antonietta Macciocchi, a &quot;China expert&quot; and author of the book &quot;Dalla Cina&quot;. After the latter had waxed lyrical on the subject of the New China, Ryckmans responded ferociously, pointing out errors of fact that suggested she had not verified her sources before writing her book, a work that he judged as being &quot;d&#x27;une stupidité totale&quot; (totally stupid) or &quot;une escroquerie&quot; (a fraud).

In the period 1987–93, he was Professor of Chinese Studies at the University of Sydney. He took early retirement, later explaining that, near the end, &quot;deep modifications&quot; had begun to affect universities in Australia and worldwide, &quot;transformations ... progressively taking the university further away from the model to which I had originally devoted my life&quot;.

Following his retirement he returned to Canberra, where he lived for the remainder of his life.

He died of cancer in Sydney at the age of 78, in August 2014, surrounded by his wife and four children, Etienne, Jeanne, Louis and Marc.

==Works==
Ryckmans wrote in French, English and Chinese.

His books on the Chinese Cultural Revolution and on Maoist China - beginning with his trilogy &quot;Les Habits neufs du président Mao&quot; (1971), &quot;Ombres chinoises&quot; (1974) and &quot;Images brisées&quot; (1976) - gave scathing descriptions of the cultural and political destruction in mainland China while denouncing the hypocrisy of its western defenders.

In 1971, on the advice of his publisher, he decided to adopt a pseudonym before the release of &quot;Les habits neufs du président Mao&quot;, in order to avoid the risk of becoming a &quot;persona non grata&quot; in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. He chose &quot;Leys&quot; after the main character of Victor Segalen&#x27;s novel &quot;René Leys&quot; (published in 1922).

During the 1970s these books by Ryckmans provoked intense hostility among many Western intellectuals, particularly the French Maoists associated with the journal &quot;Tel Quel&quot; (such as Philippe Sollers) and attracted attacks from daily newspapers such as &quot;Le Monde&quot;. However, he was defended by some intellectuals such as Jean-François Revel and Étiemble.

In 1996 he delivered the Boyer Lectures on the theme &quot;Aspects of Culture&quot;, in which he argued the need to cultivate the gardens of the mind and which were later published as &quot;The View from the Bridge: Aspects of Culture&quot; (1996).

Ryckmans was also a translator of Chinese literature, such as the &quot;Analects of Confucius&quot; and &quot;The Treatise on Painting&quot; by Shitao. His translation of &quot;The Analects of Confucius&quot; (1997) sought to introduce readers to &quot;the real, living Confucius&quot; rather than the official Confucian cult portraying him as &quot;always proper, a bit pompous, slightly boring&quot; — and appropriated by authoritarians.

The 2001 film &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;, directed by Alan Taylor, was based on Leys&#x27; novel &quot;The Death of Napoleon&quot;. Leys expressed distaste for the film, however; stating in an afterword accompanying a reprint of the novel that this &quot;latter avatar [&quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot;], by the way, was both sad and funny: sad, because Napoleon was interpreted to perfection by an actor (Ian Holm) whose performance made me dream of what could have been achieved had the producer and director bothered to read the book.&quot;

His collection of essays, &quot;The Hall of Uselessness&quot; (2011), revealed the scope of his eccentric interests, wit and insights.

His translation (2013) of Simone Weil’s 1940 essay &quot;On the Abolition of All Political Parties&quot; was inspired, he said, by the &quot;toxic atmosphere&quot; that had started to pollute Australian politics.

He wrote regularly for the English-language press — &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, &quot;Quadrant&quot;, and &quot;The Monthly&quot; — and for the French-language press — &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot;, &quot;Le Point&quot;, &quot;Le Monde&quot;, &quot;Le Figaro littéraire&quot;, and &quot;Le Magazine Littéraire&quot;.

He was a fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities, an Honorary Commander of the French Navy and member of the Académie royale de langue et de littérature françaises de Belgique.

He received many awards including the Académie française&#x27;s Prix Jean Walter, prix d’histoire et de sociologie, the Prix Renaudot de l&#x27;essai, the Prix Henri Gal, the Prix Femina, the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca, the Prix Guizot-Calvados, the Prix Quinquernal de Literature, and the Christina Stead Prize for fiction.

<doc id="1038782" wikidata="Q643063" url="?curid=1038782" title="Gondwana Rainforests">
<text>The Gondwana Rainforests of Australia, formerly known as the Central Eastern Rainforest Reserves, are the most extensive area of subtropical rainforest in the world. Collectively, the rainforests are a World Heritage Site with fifty separate reserves totalling from to Brisbane.

==Background==
The Gondwana Rainforests are so-named because the fossil record indicates that when Gondwana existed it was covered by rainforests containing the same kinds of species that are living today. Not all Gondwanan rainforests in Australia are located in the New South WalesQueensland region; the largest Gondwanan rainforest in Australia is located in Tasmania&#x27;s Tarkine wilderness. The number of visitors to the Gondwana rainforest reserves in New South Wales and Queensland is about 2 million per year.

The World Heritage status of the region was created and negotiated initially in 1986, with the area extended in 1994, following a nomination which was prepared in 1992 by the Rainforest Conservation Society. The World Heritage listing carries the following inscription:
The site was gazetted on the Australian National Heritage List on 21 May 2007 under the ; and the New South Wales portion was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

== Conservation value ==
The forests were inscribed to the World Heritage list in 1986, covering only the New South Wales sites of approximately and extended in 1994 to cover the Queensland sites of approximately which is a total of approximately . The rainforest reserves have an extremely high conservation value, with more than 200 rare or threatened plant and animal species.

Eight separate areas have been identified as having outstanding heritage significance to Australia and are included on the Australian National Heritage List. The altitude of the reserves ranges from sea level to almost .

On 22 December 2000, the High Conservation Value Old Growth forest covering 24 national parks and 19 nature reserves spread across 12 local government areas in the upper north east region of New South Wales were listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register.

==National parks==
The Queensland areas include the Main Range, at its most northern point; and extending south, the Lamington, Mount Chinghee, Springbrook and Mount Barney national parks.

The New South Wales areas include the Barrington Tops, at its most southern point; and extending north, the Dorrigo, Mount Warning, New England, Mebbin, Nightcap, Border Ranges, Oxley Wild Rivers, Washpool, Willi Willi and Werrikimbe national parks.

The most heavily visited parts are Dorrigo National Park and the Natural Bridge section of Springbrook National Park.

== Destruction ==
The region was historically logged extremely heavily, to such an extent that only 1% of the original range of the Gondwana rainforest remains in Australia. Most of the logged regions have been taken over by eucalyptus forest. 

During the 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season, many regions of the Gondwana rainforest were devastated by bushfires for the first time, with some preliminary reports indicating that up to 53% of the forests may have burned as of January 2020. Among the devastated habitats are several locations that are significant for some critically imperiled species, such as the nightcap oak and the giant barred frog. The presence of these devastating blazes in areas that have never burned before has been linked to the encroachment of the flammable eucalyptus trees into the logged areas adjoining the forests. The general claim of &quot;never burned before&quot; has been challenged by several commentators, based on an article in &quot;The Cairns Post&quot; on 25 October 1951 that reported a &quot;fire has burnt out about 2000 acres of thick rainforest country&quot; in the Lamington National Park.

==Australian National Heritage List sections==
The Gondwana Rainforests of Australia are divided into sections for listing on the Australian National Heritage List, from north to south, as below:

<doc id="1038794" wikidata="Q5298503" url="?curid=1038794" title="Dorothy Lawrence">
<text>Dorothy Lawrence (4 October 1896 – 29 August 1964) was an English journalist who posed as a male soldier to report from the front line during World War I. In 1915, she went to France, where she managed to obtain a military uniform and a false identity. Upon her arrival in 
Albert, Somme, she found a soldier who took her to the front lines. However, trench life affected her health, and after ten days, she revealed her sex, afraid that if she needed medical attention her true identity would be discovered and those who helped her would be punished. She was arrested and interrogated, suspected of being a spy or a prostitute. She was then sent home under a strict agreement not to write about her experiences.

After the war, Lawrence published a memoir, but it was highly censored and not very successful. Her health began to fail, and she was committed to a mental institution, where she died 40 years later. In 2003, her story was rediscovered. Her book was reprinted and the Imperial War Museum included her experiences in an exhibition on women at war. Since 2015, several plays and films have been produced based on her story.

==Early life==
Lawrence was born in Hendon, Middlesex, to parents unknown. Probably illegitimate, she was adopted (at an unknown age) by a guardian of the Church of England.

There is discrepancy in her parentage. The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; (which at time of publication in 2004 did not mention details of her life after 1919) reports that Lawrence was born on 4 October 1896 in Polesworth, Warwickshire, and was the second daughter of Thomas Hartshorn Lawrence and Mary Jane Beddall.. This cannot be the case, as their daughter, 14-year-old Dorothy Lawrence, appears in the 1911 census with her parents, including Thomas Hartshorn Lawrence, while a 23-year-old Dorothy Lawrence, born in &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Bush&quot; in the 1911 census, is a journalist boarding with other lady boarders in West Kensington. Although variously described [in 1915] as &quot;early-twenties&quot;, or &quot;aged 20&quot;, it is more likely Lawrence was older and born circa 1888. For example, in 1911 census she is 23; 1939 WW2 Ration Register she is 51, and her death age in 1964 was recorded as 76 on her death certificate.

When her mother died in 1909, Lawrence was adopted by wealthy and respected church guardians Mrs Josephine Fitzgerald and her husband in Salisbury. However, this is also a moot point, as per Lawrence&#x27;s age in the 1911 census (23), she would not have been a minor in 1909.

==War correspondent==
Wanting to be a journalist, she managed to have some articles published in &quot;The Times&quot; and in &quot;Nash&#x27;s Pall Mall Magazine&quot;. When the war started, she wrote to a number of the Fleet Street newspapers offering her services as a war correspondent. She believed that this would be the best way to gain recognition for her talents, but no paper would send a woman to the front lines. In fact, they couldn&#x27;t get access for even experienced male correspondents.

Travelling to France in 1915, she tried to join the Voluntary Aid Detachment but was rejected. While attempting to enter the war zone via the French sector as a freelancer, she was arrested by French Police in Senlis, short of the front line, and ordered to leave. Spending the night sleeping on a haystack in a forest, she returned to Paris, where she concluded that only by disguising herself as a man could she get her story:
==Transformation==

Lawrence persuaded two British Army soldiers she met in a Paris café to smuggle her a khaki uniform, piece by piece, within their washing; she called the ten men who eventually shared in this exploit her &quot;khaki accomplices&quot;. She then practised transforming herself into a male soldier by flattening her figure with a home-made corset, using sacking and cotton-wool to bulk out her shoulders and persuading two Scottish military policemen to cut her hair in a short military style. She darkened her complexion with Condy’s Fluid, a disinfectant made from potassium permanganate; scraped the pale skin of her cheeks to produce a shaving rash; and added a tan using shoe polish. Then she asked her soldier friends to teach her how to drill and march.

Wearing a blanket coat and no underwear so no one could discover her abandoned petticoats, she obtained forged identity papers as Private Denis Smith of the 1st Bn, Leicestershire Regiment and headed for the front lines.

===Front line===
She set out for the British sector of the Somme by bicycle. On her way towards Albert, Somme, she met Lancashire coalminer turned British Expeditionary Force (BEF) tunnel-digging sapper Tom Dunn, who offered to assist her. Fearing for the safety of a lone woman amongst female-companionship starved soldiers, Dunn found Lawrence an abandoned cottage in Senlis Forest to sleep in. During her time on the frontline, she returned there each night to sleep on a damp mattress, fed by any rations that Dunn and his colleagues could spare.

Dunn found her work as a sapper with the 179 Tunnelling Company, 51st Division, Royal Engineers, a specialist mine-laying company that operated within of the front line. Lawrence wrote that she was involved in the digging of tunnels. But later evidence and correspondence from the time after her discovery by British Army authorities, including from the files of Sir Walter Kirke of the BEF&#x27;s secret service, suggest that she did not undertake this highly skilled digging work, but was at liberty and working within the trenches. Historian Simon Jones, an expert on the Somme tunnels, believes that Dorothy was not actually tunnelling under the front line but thinks there is no doubt that she was in the trenches disguised as a man.

Due to the stress of the situation, Lawrence developed constant chills and rheumatism, then fainting fits. After 10 days of service, to protect the men who had helped her, she revealed herself to be female and the commanding sergeant promptly placed her under arrest.

===Return to England===
Taken to the BEF headquarters and interrogated as a spy by a colonel, she was declared a prisoner of war. From there she was taken cross country by horse to Third Army headquarters in Calais, where she was interrogated by six generals and approximately twenty other officers. She was ignorant of the term camp follower (one meaning of which is &quot;prostitute&quot;) and she later recalled &quot;We talked steadily at cross purposes. On my side I had not been informed what the term meant, and on their side they continued unaware that I remained ignorant! So I often appeared to be telling lies.&quot;

From Calais she was taken to Saint-Omer and further interrogated. The Army was embarrassed that a woman had breached security and was fearful of more women taking on male roles during the war if her story got out. Fearing that she might divulge sensitive intelligence, a judge ordered that she remain in France until after the Battle of Loos. Held within the Convent de Bon Pasteur, she was also made to swear not to write about her experiences and signed an affidavit to that effect to keep from being sent to jail. Sent back to London, she travelled across the English Channel on the same ferry as activist Emmeline Pankhurst, who asked her to speak at a suffragette meeting.

Once in London, she tried to write about her experiences for &quot;The Wide World Magazine&quot;, but had to scrap her first book on the instructions of the War Office, which invoked the 1914 Defence of the Realm Act to silence her. She later commented:
The National Archives have two medal index cards for Lawrence confirming her participation in the war: one showing her rank of Sapper with the Royal Engineers and another showing her as a Worker in the Queen Mary&#x27;s Army Auxiliary Corps.

==Later life==
In 1919, she moved to Canonbury, Islington, and published an account of her experiences: &quot;Sapper Dorothy Lawrence: The Only English Woman Soldier&quot;. Although well received in England, America and Australia, it was heavily censored by the War Office, and it did not become the commercial success that she wanted.

By 1925, her increasingly erratic behaviour was brought to the attention of the authorities. After confiding to a doctor that she had been raped as a teenager by her church guardian Mr Fitzgerald, and with no contact from Mrs Fitzgerald or other family to look after her, she was taken into care and later deemed insane. Committed first to the London County Mental Hospital at Hanwell in March 1925, she was later institutionalised at the Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum in Friern Barnet, north London. She apparently did not have any visitors and died of cerebral thrombosis aged 67 on 29 August 1964, at what was by then known as Friern Hospital. She was buried in a public (pauper&#x27;s) grave in New Southgate Cemetery. Plot ref: AH202, an area which since the 2000s has been reused for further burials on top of the earlier public grave interments.

==Legacy==
In 2003, Richard Bennett, the grandson of Richard Samson Bennett – one of the soldiers who had helped Lawrence in France – found her autobiography while researching his family history at the Royal Engineers Museum (REM) in Chatham, Kent.

On further investigation, East Sussex historian Raphael Stipic found a letter written during World War I by Sir Walter Kirke, head of the secret service for the British Expeditionary Force. The letter mentioned a woman who dressed in men&#x27;s clothing in hopes of becoming a war correspondent, pointing clearly to Lawrence.

Freelance historian Simon Jones then found a copy of Lawrence&#x27;s book at the REM and started collecting notes to write a biography. Jones later found that Lawrence&#x27;s rape allegations were included in her medical records, held in the London Metropolitan Archives of Saint Bernard&#x27;s Hospital, but not available for general access.

Her story later became part of an Imperial War Museum exhibition covering women at war. Curator Laura Clouting stated that Lawrence was included because she was the exception to the rule that women were not included in any branch of the military.

Several plays and films have been produced based on Lawrence&#x27;s story:

* &quot;The Disappearance of Dorothy Lawrence&quot; (2015), play written by Julie McNamara and directed by Paulette Randall.
* &quot;Blue Pen&quot; (2016), film by McNamara based on the stories of Lawrence and other women journalists whose voices were silenced through censorship, confinement in institutions, and abuse.
* &quot;Over the Top: the true-life tale of Dorothy Lawrence&quot; (2016), play written and directed by Lizzie Crarer, a production of theatre company The Heroine Project Presents, which offers stories of women who have been overlooked in history. 
* After a trustee of the Historical Association (HA) saw a performance of &quot;Over the Top&quot;, the HA commissioned the theatre company to create three short films about Lawrence to use in classroom discussions about World War I. The films were posted on the HA website in May 2017.

<text>Ashill is a small village and civil parish in Somerset, England, situated south of Taunton, and three miles north-west of Ilminster. The parish includes the hamlet of Windmill Hill and has a population of 529.

It has a small junior school, a village pub named &quot;The Ashill Inn&quot;, a village hall and a playing field.

== History ==

Ashill is mentioned in the Domesday book for its extensive woodland. The manor passed from the de Vaux family to Sir Thomas Moulton by 1317, and then through the Stretche and Beauchamp families to the Spekes who built &quot;Jordans&quot; as their mansion, which was demolished in the 1960s, although the grotto/summer house (dating from 1828) in the grounds survives. The grotto is on the Heritage at Risk Register due to vandalism despite re-thatching.

Ashill was part of the hundred of Abdick and Bulstone.

==Governance==

The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

For local government purposes, since 1 April 2023, the village comes under the unitary authority of Somerset Council. Prior to this, it was part of the non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Chard Rural District. 

It is also part of the Yeovil county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Prior to Brexit in 2020 it was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament.

== Church ==

The church is named The Church of the Virgin Mary and dates from the 12th or 13th century, with various later alterations. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. The old rectory has some 16th-century fragments but was largely rebuilt around 1800.

== Places of interest ==

* The late 15th-century &quot;Rowland&#x27;s Farm&quot; is the home of the Speke family.
* Rowland&#x27;s Mill is a Hamstone watermill dating from the 17th century.
* 18th-century cider house.

<doc id="1038799" wikidata="Q146720" url="?curid=1038799" title="Mandatory Iraq">
<text>The Kingdom of Iraq under British Administration, or Mandatory Iraq (), was created in 1921, following the 1920 Iraqi Revolution against the proposed British Mandate of Mesopotamia, and enacted via the 1922 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty and a 1924 undertaking by the United Kingdom to the League of Nations to fulfil the role as Mandatory Power.

Faisal ibn Husayn, who had been proclaimed King of Syria by a Syrian National Congress in Damascus in March 1920, was ejected by the French in July of the same year. Faisal was then granted by the British the territory of Iraq, to rule it as a kingdom, with the British Royal Air Force (RAF) retaining certain military control, but , the territory remained under British administration until 1932.

The civil government of postwar Iraq was headed originally by the High Commissioner, Sir Percy Cox, and his deputy, Colonel Arnold Wilson. British reprisals after the capture and killing of a British officer in Najaf failed to restore order. The British occupiers faced the growing strength of the nationalists, who continued to resist against the British authority. British administration had yet to be established in Iraqi Kurdistan.

== History ==

===Early unrest===

Three important anticolonial secret societies had been formed in Iraq during 1918 and 1919. The League of the Islamic Awakening () was organized at Najaf. The Muslim National League () was formed with the object of organizing and mobilizing the population for major resistance. In February 1919, in Baghdad, a coalition of Shia merchants, Sunni teachers, and civil servants, Sunni and Shia ulama, and Iraqi officers formed the Guardians of Independence (). The Istiqlal had member groups in Karbala, Najaf, Kut, and Hillah.

The Grand Mujtahid of Karbala, Imam Shirazi, and his son, Mirza Muhammad Riza, began to organize the insurgent effort. Shirazi then issued a ruling, and he called for a resistance against the British. By July 1920, Mosul was in rebellion against British rule, and the armed resistance moved south down the Euphrates River valley. The southern tribes, who cherished their long-held political autonomy, needed little inducement to join in the fray. They did not cooperate in an organized effort against the British, however, which limited the effect of the revolt.

The Iraqi revolt of 1920 was a watershed event in contemporary Iraqi history. For the first time, Sunnis and Shias, tribes and cities, were brought together in a common effort. In the opinion of Hanna Batatu, author of a seminal work on Iraq, the building of a nation-state in Iraq depended upon two major factors: the integration of Shias and Sunnis into the new body politic and the successful resolution of the age-old conflicts between the tribes and the riverine cities and among the tribes themselves over the food-producing flatlands of the Tigris and the Euphrates. The 1920 rebellion brought these groups together, if only briefly; this constituted an important first step in the long and arduous process of forging a nation-state out of Iraq&#x27;s conflict-ridden social structure. The Assyrian Levies, a military force under British command, participated in the Kirkuk Massacre of 1924 of Kurds, Arabs, and Turkomen. (See Simele Massacres of 1933)


On 1 October 1922, the Royal Air Force (RAF) elements stationed in Iraq were reorganized into the RAF Iraq Command, which came about partially as a result of the 1920 revolt. This new command was primarily designed to suppress any threats to the Hashemite monarchy. Air control was considered by the British government as a more cost-effective method of controlling large areas of territory than land forces, an idea that was heavily promoted by RAF officer Hugh Trenchard. During the 1920s and 30s, the RAF Iraq Command participated in the suppression of numerous protests and revolts against the Hashemite monarchy. Historian Elie Kedourie noted that &quot;the North [of Iraq] as a whole had to be coerced [into submission] by the Royal Air Force.&quot; When the Kurdish leader Sheikh Mahmud launched an armed rebellion, the British used the newly established Iraqi army to suppress the revolt, but that proved ineffective. The British then resorted to deploying the RAF, which suppressed the revolt. In the same period, rebellions by the Shia in the South were also suppressed by the RAF.

===Coronation of Faisal===
At the Cairo Conference of March 1921, the British set the parameters for Iraqi political life that were to continue until the 1958 revolution; they chose a Hashemite, Faisal ibn Husayn, son of Sherif Hussein ibn Ali former Sharif of Mecca as Iraq&#x27;s first King; they established an Iraqi army (but kept Iraq Levies under direct British command); and they proposed a new treaty. To confirm Faisal as Iraq&#x27;s first monarch, a one-question plebiscite was carefully arranged that had a return of 96 percent in his favor. The British saw in Faisal a leader who possessed sufficient nationalist and Islamic credentials to have broad appeal, but who also was vulnerable enough to remain dependent on their support. Faisal traced his descent from the family of Muhammad. His ancestors held political authority in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina since the 10th century. The British believed these credentials would satisfy traditional Arab standards of political legitimacy; moreover, the British thought Faisal would be accepted by the growing Iraqi nationalist movement because of his role in the 1916 Arab Revolt against the Turks, his achievements as a leader of the Iraq emancipation movement, and his general leadership qualities. Faisal was instated as the Monarch of Iraq after the Naquib of Baghdad was disqualified as being too old (80 yrs) and Sayid Talib (a prominent Iraqi from the province of Basra) was deported on trumped up charges by the British. The voting was far from a reflection of the true feelings of the Iraqi people. Nevertheless, Faisal was considered the most effective choice for the throne by the British government.
The final major decision taken at the Cairo Conference related to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1922. Faisal was under pressure from the nationalists and the anti-British mujtahids of Najaf and Karbala to limit both British influence in Iraq and the duration of the treaty. Recognizing that the monarchy depended on British support— and wishing to avoid a repetition of his experience in Syria – Faisal maintained a moderate approach in dealing with the UK. The treaty, which had been originally set as a 20-year engagement but later reduced to four years, was ratified in June 1924; it stated that the king would heed British advice on all matters affecting British interests and on fiscal policy as long as Iraq had a balance of payments deficit with the UK, and that British officials would be appointed to specified posts in 18 departments to act as advisers and inspectors. A subsequent financial agreement, which significantly increased the financial burden on Iraq, required Iraq to pay half the cost of supporting British resident officials, among other expenses. British obligations under the new treaty included providing various kinds of aid, notably military assistance, and proposing Iraq for membership in the League of Nations at the earliest moment. In effect, the treaty ensured that Iraq would remain politically and economically dependent on the UK. While unable to prevent the treaty, Faisal clearly felt that the British had gone back on their promises to him.

The British decision at the Cairo Conference to establish an indigenous Iraqi army was significant. In Iraq, as in most of the developing world, the military establishment has been the best organized institution in an otherwise weak political system. Thus, while Iraq&#x27;s body politic crumbled under immense political and economic pressure throughout the monarchic period, the military gained increasing power and influence; moreover, because the officers in the new army were by necessity Sunnis who had served under the Ottomans, while the lower ranks were predominantly filled by Shia tribal elements, Sunni dominance in the military was preserved.

===Later years===
The Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 provided for a &quot;close alliance,&quot; for &quot;full and frank consultations between the two countries in all matters of foreign policy,&quot; and for mutual assistance in case of war. Iraq granted the British the use of air bases near Basra and at Habbaniyah and the right to move troops across the country. The treaty, of twenty-five years&#x27; duration, was to come into force upon Iraq&#x27;s admission to the League of Nations.

With the signing of the 1930 Treaty and the settling of the Mosul Question, Iraqi politics took on a new dynamic. The emerging class of Sunni and Shia landowning tribal sheikhs vied for positions of power with wealthy and prestigious urban-based Sunni families and with Ottoman-trained army officers and bureaucrats. Because Iraq&#x27;s newly established political institutions were the creation of a foreign power, and because the concept of democratic government had no precedent in Iraqi history, the politicians in Baghdad lacked legitimacy and never developed deeply rooted constituencies. Thus, despite a constitution and an elected assembly, Iraqi politics was more a shifting alliance of important personalities and cliques than a democracy in the Western sense. The absence of broadly based political institutions inhibited the early nationalist movement&#x27;s ability to make deep inroads into Iraq&#x27;s diverse social structure.

The Mandatory administration continued to operate until 1932.

In 1936 and 1937 various protests and revolts broke out against the Iraqi government, with the main issues centering around agrarian issues and conscription into the armed forces. These were suppressed by the Iraqi government with assistance from the RAF Iraq Command, with Kedourie writing that the &quot;killing, it seems, was indiscriminate, and old men, women and children were the victims.&quot; An armed revolt which broke out in 1937 over agrarian issues and conscription was also &quot;put down with the help of indiscriminate aerial bombing.&quot; During these disturbances, Shia religious leaders were expelled from Iraq due to being Persians. Kedourie describes the monarchy as despotic, with a record &quot;full of bloodshed, treason and rapine&quot; and &quot;however pitiful its end we may know that it was implicit in its beginning.&quot;

In his assessment of the British mandate and the Iraqi monarchy, historians Kanan Makiya considers the British mandate and its institutions more as &quot;agents of modernisation&quot; than colonialism:
Kedourie&#x27;s judgement, however, is different:
If Makiya is referring to economic development in his account of the British modernising legacy in Iraq, an authoritative study demonstrates that Iraq&#x27;s productivity in agriculture, the most important sector at the time, in fact declined from 275 kg per acre in 1920 to an average of 238 kg per acre between 1953 and 1958.

Under the British mandate a new ruling class of &#x27;government shaikhs&#x27; was created. &quot;Many of them [the Shaikhs], reported Major Pulley to the British commissioner in Baghdad in 1920, &quot;were small men of no account until we made them powerful and rich.&quot; The Civil Commissioner Wilson reported on his part that the Shaikhs &quot;were in most cases directly dependent on the civil administration for the positions they held; realising that their positions entailed corresponding obligations, they co-operated actively with the political officers.&quot;

In a dispatch by a British official to London in 1928, there was a description of how the electoral system worked: the government&#x27;s provincial governors were in fact election agents who drew up lists of those to be elected and of those who would do the electing. Elections to &quot;the chamber of deputies and appointments to the senate,&quot; comments Keeourie, &quot;were an additional weapon in the hands of the 
government wherewith the better to control the country.&quot;

==Independence==
On 3 October 1932, the Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq became an independent state. Ruled by the Hashemites, it lasted until 1958. However, Britain retained its military bases in Iraq, and British influence after independence resulted in instability for the monarchy. Before the monarchy&#x27;s collapse in 1958, a series of coups took place in 1936 and 1941. The latter was followed by a brief British occupation.

== Economy ==
Nomadic bedouin tribes within Iraq, which had previously traded all throughout the Middle East, became confined to trading only within the borders of the Mandate itself. This decision by the colonial administration proved economically troubling and devastating for the bedouins.

===Oil concession===
Before the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the British-controlled Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC) had held concessionary rights to the Mosul &quot;wilaya&quot; (province). Under the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement – an agreement in 1916 between Britain and France that delineated future control of the Middle East – the area would have fallen under French influence. In 1919, however, the French relinquished their claims to Mosul under the terms of the Long-Berenger Agreement. The 1919 agreement granted the French a 25 percent share in the TPC as compensation.

Beginning in 1923, British and Iraqi negotiators held acrimonious discussions over the new oil concession. The major obstacle was Iraq&#x27;s insistence on a 20 percent equity participation in the company; this figure had been included in the original TPC concession to the Turks and had been agreed upon at Sanremo for the Iraqis. In the end, despite strong nationalist sentiments against the concession agreement, the Iraqi negotiators acquiesced to it. The League of Nations was soon to vote on the disposition of Mosul, and the Iraqis feared that, without British support, Iraq would lose the area to Turkey. In March 1925, an agreement was concluded that contained none of the Iraqi demands. The TPC, now renamed the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), was granted a full and complete concession for a period of seventy-five years.
