<text>Hulme () is an inner city area and electoral ward of Manchester, in Greater Manchester, England, immediately south of Manchester city centre. It has a significant industrial heritage.

Historically in Lancashire, the name Hulme is derived from the Old Norse word for a small island, or land surrounded by water or marsh, indicating that it may have been first settled by Norse invaders in the period of the Danelaw.

==History==
Hulme was formerly a township in the parish of Manchester, in 1866 Hulme became a separate civil parish, on 26 March 1896 the parish was abolished to form South Manchester. In 1891 the parish had a population of 71,96.

===Toponymy===
Hulme derives its name from the Old Norse &quot;holmr, holmi&quot;, through Old Danish &quot;hulm&quot; or &quot;hulme&quot; meaning small islands or land surrounded by streams, fen or marsh. The area may have fitted this description at the time of the Scandinavian invasion and settlement as it is surrounded by water on three sides by the rivers Irwell, Medlock and Corn Brook. Ekwall suggested that the considerable number of Danish names to the south and south-west of Manchester, unparalleled in the rest of Lancashire, pointed to a Danish colony on the north bank of the Mersey.

===Early history===
Ouerholm and Noranholm were recorded in 1226 and Norholm in 1227. These are thought to be variations of Overhulm and Netherhulm, although recorded earlier.

The surname &quot;de Hulm&quot; is known from records of 1246, 1273, 1277, 1285, 1332 and 1339 and &quot;del Hulme&quot; from 1284. There are other early Hulm(e)s/Holm(e)s from which they might have received their surnames (by Warrington and Lancaster, for example).

In 1310 there is a mention of &quot;the manor of Hulm with the appurtenances, near Mamcestre&quot;.

In 1322 in the records of rents of the lands of the recently executed enemy of the King and rebel Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, the following are mentioned as in the Wapentake of Salfordshire:

&quot;Geoffrey de Hulme holds half a ploughland in Hulme and renders yearly 5&quot;s&quot;[hillings].&quot; or, in an alternate version:
&quot;Geoffrey de Hulme holds one ploughland in Hulme by the service of 5&quot;s&quot;. yearly at the 4 terms for all.&quot; and
&quot;John le Ware holds one ploughland in Hulme by the service of 5&quot;s&quot;. yearly at the 4 terms.&quot;
In 1324 there is a record of &quot;... ; farm of the land of Geoffrey de Hulme in Hulme which Jordan the dean formerly held in Overhulm and Netherhulm 5&quot;s&quot; ; ...&quot;

In 1440 there is a mention of the manor of Hulme and land exchanged for 200 pounds of silver:
&quot;Between William de Byrom, Henry de Par and John Hepe, late of Hulme, plaintiffs, and Ralph de Prestwich, deforciant of the manor of Hulme with the appurtenances, and of 9 messuages, 300 acres of land, 100 acres of meadow, 500 acres of pasture, and 100 acres of wood in Mamcestre, Crompton and Oldom.

Hulme was evidenced as a separate community south of the River Medlock from Manchester in 15th century map prints. Christopher Saxton included Holme in his map of Lancashire of 1577 on the south banks of the Medlock and the Irwell where they joined. Trafford was placed on the south bank of the Irwell to the south-west, Wordsall across the Irwell to the north-west and Manchester across the Medlock to the north. Hulme Hall was close to the River Irwell on a site near where St George&#x27;s Church was later built, and the Hulme Barracks were built in 1799.

Until the 18th century the area remained agricultural, and pictures from the time show an idyllic scene of crops, sunshine and country life. The area remained entirely rural until the Bridgewater Canal was cut and the Industrial Revolution swept economic change through the neighbouring district of Castlefield where the Duke of Bridgewater&#x27;s canal terminated, and containerised transportation of coal and goods rose as an industry to support the growing textile industries of Manchester. It was this supply of cheap coal from the Duke&#x27;s mines at Worsley that allowed the textile industry of Manchester to grow.

===Industrial Revolution===

The Industrial Revolution brought development to the area, and jobs to the poor, carrying coal from the &#x27;starvationers&#x27; (very narrow canal boats), to be carted off along Deansgate.

Many cotton mills and railway links to Hulme soon followed, with the town served by the Mid-Cheshire line railway and the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway, as well as the Manchester Carriage and Tramways Company. Thousands of people came to work in the rapidly expanding mills in the city. The number of people living in Hulme multiplied 50-fold during the first half of the 19th century. Housing had to be built rapidly, and space was limited, which resulted in low-quality housing interspersed with the myriad smoking chimneys of the mills and the railway. Reports of the time suggest that at times the air quality became so poor that poisonous fumes and smoke literally &quot;blocked out the sun&quot; for long periods.
In the &quot;Irish Poor Report&quot; of 1836 the Deputy Constable of the Township of Manchester, Joseph Sadler Thomas, found that the Irish were so fiercely neighbourly in Little Ireland (located on the other side of the River Medlock, just north of Hulme Ward) and the larger Irish area of Angel Meadow (north-east of Victoria Station, on the other side of central Manchester from Hulme) that: &quot;if a legal execution of any kind is to be made, either for rent or debt, or for taxes, the officer who serves the process almost always applies to me for assistance to protect him; and, in affording that protection, my officers are often maltreated by brickbats and other missiles&quot;.
Hulme Hall was demolished in 1840 with the construction of the Bridgewater Canal. By 1844, the situation had grown so serious that Manchester Borough Council had to pass a law banning further building. However, the thousands of &quot;slum&quot; homes that were already built continued to be lived in, and many were still in use into the first half of the 20th century.

Friedrich Engels was the heir of a German cotton manufacturer who had come to work for the Ermen &amp; Engels factory in Weaste, Salford, three miles from Hulme though he worked in the firm&#x27;s offices in Manchester. He made Little Ireland infamous throughout the world as a disastrous slum despite it being relatively short-lived (a little over 30 years) and other areas of Manchester having worse housing, poverty and disease. Little Ireland was a small slum between Oxford Road, the Medlock and the railway serving Oxford Road Station, mainly inhabited by Irish immigrant workers. Described at length by Engels, he estimated that there was one inaccessible privy for every 120 residents. &quot;The cottages are old, dirty and of the smallest sort, the streets uneven, fallen into ruts and in part without drains or pavement; masses of refuse, offal and sickening filth lie among standing pools in all directions; the atmosphere is poisoned by the effluvia from these, and laden and darkened by the smoke of a dozen tall factory chimneys. A horde of ragged women and children swarm about here, as filthy as the swine that thrive upon the garbage heaps and in the puddles.&quot; Reinforcement of the Medlock to protect the factories raised the level of the river above the surrounding residential hovels leading to frequent flooding with filthy river water.
Hulme was also described by Engels: &quot;the more thickly built-up regions chiefly bad and approaching ruin, the less populous of more modern structure, but generally sunk in filth.&quot;

Large numbers of Irish immigrants settled in Hulme, and in various other districts of Manchester.

The Tithe award for Hulme was made in 1854. In 1863 members of the Hulme Athenaeum club for working men established an association football club, believed to be the earliest example in the city and in the county of Lancashire. Records of association games in the 1860s and 1870s exist with the club surviving into the early 1870s.

In the 1860s, as Hulme became more established, new facilities sprang up. Municipal buildings were developed on Stretford Road, including the Town Hall, baths and public library, and Chorlton Union Workhouse on Leaf Street. The former Turville Public House, on the corner of Ellesmere Street, dates from c1870.

The foundation stone of the first school erected by the Manchester School Board was laid in Vine Street, Hulme, on 11 June 1874 by Herbert Birley, chairman of the board, and the school was opened on 9 August 1875. Other board schools in Hulme were at Hamer Street (1872), Zion Chapel (1875), Lloyd Street (1878), Mulberry Street (1881), Upper Jackson Street (1883), Bangor Street (1886) and Duke Street (1890). The temperance hall in Hulme, in 1880, hosted a fancy dress ball, where all the 47 attendees were men, but 22 of them came dressed as women. The attendees were later arrested and put on trial accused of soliciting sex with other men.

In 1913 it was said &quot;It is probable that in no northern city is the divergence between classes so marked as it is becoming in Manchester. Among the 80,000 inhabitants, for example, of Hulme, the poorest and most neglected district of the city, is to be found only a tiny minority of persons of much education and refinement, these being with rare exceptions doctors, or ministers of the various religious denominations, and their wives&quot;

In the early 20th century transport in Hulme was improved when the existing horse bus services were replaced by electric trams. These services connected Hulme with the suburbs further south, Moss Side, Whalley Range and Chorlton-cum-Hardy. Boston Street and Preston Street carried complementary single lines of track southwards from Jackson Street. From 1949 the tram services were withdrawn and replaced by the motorbuses of Manchester Corporation Transport.

=== Hulme Hippodrome (1901), The Playhouse (1902) ===
Two existing conjoined theatres were built in Hulme, the Hulme Hippodrome and The Playhouse, opening in 1901 and 1902 respectively. The Playhouse was later used as a BBC studio for 30 years (1955-1986) and for a short time opened as the Nia Centre (1991-1997) but closed due to financial problems. It currently is run by Niamos CIC. Hulme Hippodrome was a variety theatre until 1960, then as a bingo hall followed by being a social club and snooker hall until 1988. After being dark for 15 years it was purchased by the controversial religious charity, Gilbert Deya Ministries in 2003. It was sold to a property developer in November 2020 and is currently shuttered and in poor repair. A campaign group exists, Save Hulme Hippodrome. Both theatres are Grade 2 listed buildings. Recent research in the BBC written files archives has shown Hulme Hippodrome was hired as a venue in 1950-1955 on Sunday afternoons to record around 20 radio show titles, including Morecambe &amp; Wise&#x27;s first series, &quot;You&#x27;re Only Young Once&quot;.

===Post War Housing ===

Hulme had been heavily bombed during World War II and the majority of its housing was privately owned Victorian terraces, most of which were declared unfit and demolished during a rapid slum clearance policy, in Hulme there was resistance to building tower blocks and this led to the building of the mid-rise deck access flats of a &quot;modular&quot; living design. Hulme in the 1960s was an era of &quot;socialist, post-war spirit - reflected across health, education and worker rights&quot;. The modernist and brutalist architectural style of the period, as well as practicalities of speed and cost of construction led to building what became known as the &quot;cities in the sky&quot;.

In Hulme, a new and (at the time) innovative design for deck access and tower living was attempted with four blocks, designed for families. This consisted of curved rows of low-rise flats with deck access far above the streets, known as the Hulme Crescents, designed to house 13,000. In this arrangement, vehicles remained on ground level with pedestrians on concrete walkways overhead, above the smoke and fumes of the street. People living in the new post war council homes were, within a decade treated as second class citizens.

High-density housing was balanced with large green spaces and trees below, and the pedestrian had priority on the ground over cars. The 1960s redevelopment of Hulme split the area&#x27;s new council housing into a number of sections. Hulme 2 was the area between Jackson Crescent and Royce Road. Hulme 3 was between Princess Road and Boundary Road based along the pedestrianised Epping Walk, Hulme 4 was between Princess Road and Royce Road and Hulme 5 - the &quot;&quot;Crescents&quot; themselves were between Royce Road and Rolls Crescent. The names of the &quot;Crescents&quot; harked back to the Georgian era, being named after architects of that time: Robert Adam Crescent, Charles Barry Crescent, William Kent Crescent and John Nash Crescent, together with Hawksmoor Close (a small straight block of similar design attached to Charles Barry Crescent). At the time, the &quot;Crescents&quot;&quot; won several design awards. They were also popular because they were some of the first council homes in Manchester to have central heating. The development even had some notable first occupants, such as Nico and Alain Delon.

However, what eventually turned out to be recognised as poor design, workmanship and maintenance meant that the crescents introduced their own problems. Design flaws and unreliable &#x27;system build&#x27; construction methods, as well as the 1970s oil crisis meant that heating the poorly insulated homes became too expensive for their low income residents, and the crescents soon became notorious for being cold, damp and riddled with cockroaches and other vermin. Crime and drug abuse became significant problems in Hulme, as police did not patrol the long, often dark decks, due to the fact that they were not officially considered streets. The decks made muggings and burglary relatively easy, as any crime could be carried out in almost total privacy, with no hope for quick assistance from police below.

The crescents became troublesome very shortly after their construction—within a decade, they were declared &#x27;unfit for purpose&#x27;, and several plans were drawn up that suggested various differing types of renovation and renewal for the blocks, including splitting the buildings into smaller, more manageable structures by removing sections. By 1984 the City Council, then landlord abandoned the Crescents entirely after which they became notorious. In the 1980s and 1990s many of these vacant deck-access flats were squatted and the area acquired a &#x27;bohemian&#x27; reputation for its many punks, artists and musicians.

During the late 1980s Viraj Mendis, an asylum seeker from Sri Lanka, sought the right of sanctuary in the Church of the Ascension in Hulme and remained there until arrested in January 1989. (For further information, see below, Religion; Church of England)

====Hulme in the 1990s and after====
The decision was made in the early 1990s to demolish Hulme&#x27;s crescent blocks and replace them with low-rise flats and houses. The total amount of public and private money spent on improving Hulme and neighbouring Moss Side between 1990 and 2002 has exceeded £400 million. The area by then had become popular and desirable, containing a mix of council and privately owned housing.

====Birley Fields====
One part of Hulme, the Birley Fields (site of the former Birley High School, Chichester Road) has been partly developed for a series of office blocks and partly left as green urban waste land. The blocks house companies such as Michelin and Laing O&#x27;Rourke as well as the University of Manchester/IFL/Server Hotel data centre. The development site was the subject of a campaign by a group of Hulme residents which delayed the clearance of the site and the felling of a large tree. The &quot;Birley Tree&quot; was a 110-year-old Black Poplar.

In 2009, Manchester Metropolitan University announced plans for the redevelopment of Birley Fields as the site of a new £120 million campus. The proposed scheme, relocating the Faculties of Education and Health, would include new academic buildings, student accommodation for approximately 1,200 students, car parking and a community square. Work was due to start in 2011 but failed to do so. In March 2012 enabling works for this project (now estimated to cost £130 million) began. On completion the academic building is going to be open 24 hours each day and have facilities for the public as well as provision for the university. It is expected to have a marked effect on the local economy by providing more jobs.

====Asbestos====
A legacy of Hulme&#x27;s post war council housing has been through the deadly effects of Asbestos dust. John Shiers, a campaigner and later a leading figure in Save The Children had moved to council housing in Hulme in the late 1970s, where he discovered he and thousands of his neighbours council properties were riddled with Asbestos. He had been one of the first to speak out about the asbestos in the properties, he campaigned for change and was a founding member of the Hulme Asbestos Action Group. He died in 2011 of mesothelioma, a type of cancer associated with Asbestos. Manchester City Council admitted limited liability for his death in their role as his landlord. During a Parliamentary Asbestos Seminar, it was estimated that nationally the deaths between 1968 and 2008 had exceeded 110,000.

====Redevelopment====
The reputation for anti-social activity that Hulme acquired in the 1970s and 1980s has declined. The counterculture that the area fostered toward the 1990s survived the redevelopment and is evident in, for example, Hulme Community Garden Centre, a not-for-profit organisation underpinned by organic principles promoting, among other things, sustainability and urban gardening and food production, and Work for Change, a large complex of cooperatives containing artists, theatre, and a variety of NGOs.

Hulme&#x27;s nearness to the city centre has meant that it has become a popular place to live for a new generation of city dwellers. The area is popular with young professionals who are attracted by apartment prices that are lower than in the city centre and yet within a 15-minute walk of the centre and the university campuses. Local amenities include the Zion Arts Centre, Hulme Community Garden Centre and Hulme Park. Shopping needs are catered for by the Hulme Shopping Centre, which includes an Asda supermarket and an indoor market.

In 2008, following a tenants&#x27; vote, the area&#x27;s remaining council housing stock was transferred to the City South Housing Association along with that of several neighbouring areas.

==Governance==

Hulme emerged in the Middle Ages as a township and chapelry, in the ecclesiastical parish of Manchester in the Salford Hundred in the historic county of Lancashire. Under the terms of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 Hulme was in Chorlton Poor Law Union which was established on 3 February 1837 until 1915 and in Manchester Poor Law Union from 1915 until 1930. From 1824 to 1845 commissioners had powers for the improvement of the area of the township, and it became part of the Borough of Manchester in 1838.

Hulme is a ward of the city of Manchester. The district is part of the Manchester Central parliamentary constituency, which is currently represented at Westminster by Lucy Powell MP.

===Councillors===
Hulme is currently represented on the City Council by councillors Ekua Bayunu (Green), Lee-Ann Igbon (Labour) and Annette Wright (Labour). The ward has elected exclusively Labour councillors since May 2008. In 2017, councillor Amina Lone was blocked from standing in the seat again by her party, while Nigel Murphy was de-selected by the Hulme constituency party before the postponed 2020 elections.

==Geography==

Hulme is south of Manchester city centre, beyond the River Medlock. The part of Hulme nearest to Old Trafford is known as Cornbrook from the Corn Brook, a tributary of the River Irwell. The area adjacent to Castlefield is known as St Georges. This area is named after the Church of St George, Chester Road. The Bridgewater Canal passes through Hulme.

===Historic population===
In 1801 the population of Hulme was only 1677 but it was the largest of the townships surrounding Manchester. By 1831 it had increased to 9624 and then there was a greater increase to 26,982 by 1841 and roughly doubling again by 1851. The peak number was reached in 1871 when it was 74,731 and the next 30 years saw some decline to 66,916 in 1901.

==Religion==
;Church of England
The Church of St George, Chester Road, Hulme, a Commissioners&#x27; Church, was an Anglican church built to the designs of Francis Goodwin in 1826–27 and has a tall tower and a fine galleried interior. It was once the garrison church for the nearby barracks as well as being the parish church of Hulme and the graveyard has many interesting gravestones. The church was consecrated on 9 December 1828 by the Bishop of Chester, Dr John Bird Sumner, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury. The total cost of building St Georges was £20,000 of which sum Parliament, through the Church Commissioners paid nearly £15000 the rest was found by private donors and charitable bodies. The height of the tower to the top of its spires was 135 ft making it the highest in Manchester at the time. The first incumbent was Revd. Joshua Lingard M.A. After being derelict for many years it has been converted to residential use.

St Mary&#x27;s Church, Chichester Road (architect J. S. Crowther, 1856–58) is another former Anglican church. It has a tall steeple and a lofty interior. This too has been converted into apartments.

The Church of the Ascension in Royce Road was built in 1970 as part of the redevelopment of Hulme. Other Anglican churches which no longer exist (in order of foundation) include: Holy Trinity, Stretford Road (1841); St Mark&#x27;s, City Road; St Paul&#x27;s, Stretford Road; St John the Baptist, Emden Street; St Philip&#x27;s, Chester Street; St Michael&#x27;s, Lavender Street; St Stephen&#x27;s, City Road; and St Gabriel&#x27;s, Erskine Street (1869).

The Bishop of Hulme was one of three suffragan bishops in the Diocese of Manchester from 1924 to 2009; the last Bishop of Hulme was Stephen Lowe.

In 1986 Viraj Mendis, a Sri Lankan, claimed the right of sanctuary at the Church of the Ascension. He was an active supporter of Sri Lanka Tamils and claimed danger of death if he was sent back to Sri Lanka. After a march to protest against deportation on 20 December 1986, he ran into the church and claimed the right of sanctuary. He stayed there for two years with the help of the rector John Methuen. The church became the focus of the &quot;Viraj Mendis Defence Campaign&quot;. On 18 January 1989 police raided the church and arrested Mendis, which led to questions in the House of Commons. He was deported to Sri Lanka and his fears did not materialize.

;Nonconformity
In Stretford Road the Zion Congregational Chapel was built in the 19th century and replaced in 1911 by the Stretford Road Congregational Church which is no longer a church and has been put to other uses as the Zion Institute and the Zion Arts Centre. The church was used for a performance by Luciano Pavarotti and the filming of a mass meeting for Warren Beatty&#x27;s film &quot;Reds&quot;.

Other Nonconformist places of worship were the Ebenezer Methodist New Connexion Chapel, Boston Street, Cedar Street Wesleyan Mission, Christ Church Bible Christian Chapel, George Street Wesleyan Chapel, Jackson&#x27;s Lane Independent Chapel, Radnor Street Wesleyan Chapel, Russell Street Mission (Congregational), and Upper Moss Lane Primitive Methodist.
Bridgewater Hall Methodist Church opened on the 11 June 1898, situated on the corner of Queen Street and York Street. It was demolished in the late 1960s as part of the redevelopment of Hulme. In 1968 the congregation moved to a new build, Wesley Methodist Church,consisting of two buildings and situated on Royce Road. The church building with it high copper lantern roof was demolished in the early 1990s at the same time as its neighbouring Crescents.

;Roman Catholic Church
St Wilfrid&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, Birchvale Close (formerly Bedford Street), is an early work of A. W. Pugin: the tower is incomplete and the church is a good example of early Gothic Revival work.

==Industry==
Nineteenth-century Hulme had some industry in the form of small workshops, but apart from the Knott Mill Iron Works owned by W &amp; J Galloway &amp; Sons on the banks of the Medlock, most large mills and other works were nearby in other townships, but providing employment for the people of Hulme. The chemical works of Roberts, Dale &amp; Co. in Cornbrook was wrecked on 22 June 1887 by a large explosion which began in a stove drying prussic acid. Because the workers were at lunch there was only one fatality.

===Rolls-Royce===
In 1884, Henry Royce started a domestic electric fittings factory at Cooke Street. He made three cars (the Royce 10) in a corner of what was his dynamo and electric crane workshops. In 1904, Royce and Charles Stewart Rolls created a business partnership after meeting at Manchester&#x27;s Midland Hotel and started to build their own motor car (a relatively new invention). Hulme was the location of their first Rolls-Royce workshop, though operations were moved to Derby shortly afterwards. The Silver Ghost was designed and produced in Hulme. The Rolls-Royce V-8 was designed in Hulme in 1905 to compete with the popular electric town cars which were quiet, easy to start and free of smells, smoke and vibration.

Many names in Hulme commemorate this era, such as Royce Road, Rolls Crescent and the Bentley House Estate. The Royce public house, and occasional venue for music and stand-up comedy had a distinctive ceramic historical &#x27;mural&#x27; but was razed for the creation of modern flats, in the 1990s regeneration of Hulme. In August 2007, &quot;Temple 2000&quot;, a sculpture based on a Rolls-Royce radiator grille by George Wyllie RSA MBE was unveiled in Hulme Park on the site of the old Royce factory at Cooke Street off Stretford Road. The Scottish artist was inspired by the memories of Hulme&#x27;s older residents, many of whom worked at the factory.

==Recreation==
Public parks are St George&#x27;s Park in the northwest and Hulme Park (29 acres) established near Jackson Crescent in 2000. Hulme Community Garden Centre is run as a community benefit society. Their mission is to bring the local community together through gardening, education and volunteering. Hulme was served by a Unit Four cinema, one of the three in the North-West. It opened in 1970 and contained four mini-cinemas housed within a much earlier building.

<text>Stalingrad is a 1993 German anti-war film directed by Joseph Vilsmaier. It follows a platoon of German Army soldiers transferred to the Eastern Front of World War II, where they find themselves fighting in the Battle of Stalingrad.

The film is the second German movie to portray the Battle of Stalingrad. It was preceded by the 1959 &quot;&quot; (&quot;Stalingrad: Dogs, Do You Want to Live Forever?&quot;).

==Plot==
In August 1942, German soldiers enjoy leave in Cervo, Liguria, Italy, after fighting at the First Battle of El Alamein, where &quot;Unteroffizier&quot; Manfred &quot;Rollo&quot; Rohleder and &quot;Obergefreiter&quot; Fritz Reiser are introduced to &quot;Leutnant&quot; Hans von Witzland, their new platoon commander. Their unit is promptly sent to the Eastern Front to fight in the Battle of Stalingrad.

Witzland&#x27;s platoon joins a company commanded by &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Hermann Musk. Musk leads an assault on a factory, which results in heavy casualties. Later, Witzland requests a ceasefire with the Soviets so both sides can collect their wounded, which they agree to. Midway through, Müller (called &quot;HGM&quot; to distinguish him from other Müllers) breaks the ceasefire, and in the ensuing chaos a Russian boy ends up with the Germans. Witzland angrily assaults Müller. The Russian child introduces himself as Kolya.

Witzland&#x27;s platoon is surrounded in a decrepit building. During a Soviet attack, Witzland, Reiser, Rollo, Emigholtz, and &quot;G.G.&quot; Müller go down to secure the sewers, during which time Kolya runs away. Witzland gets separated from the others and captures a female soldier named Irina; she offers to lead him to safety, but instead pushes him into the water and escapes. His men rescue him. Emigholtz is severely wounded by an explosive trap, his right leg hastily amputated by the men. They take him to a crowded aid station, where they grab a doctor&#x27;s assistant at gunpoint to treat Emigholtz, despite the medic&#x27;s insistence that he is not a doctor. The assistant quickly injects Emigholtz, who dies very soon. The men are then arrested by&quot; Hauptmann&quot; Haller, who has previously clashed with Witzland regarding the treatment of Soviet prisoners. They are punished by being assigned to a penal battalion, disarming land mines.

Four weeks later, a brutal winter has set in and the Soviets have surrounded the German Sixth Army. &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Musk reassigns the penal battalion—which includes disgraced fellow officer Otto—to combat duty, after the men threaten to mutiny unless their crimes are pardoned. Witzland&#x27;s platoon repels a Soviet tank column after a bloody battle. &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Haller later orders von Witzland and his men to execute a group of unarmed civilians accused of sabotage, including Kolya. Fritz and Witzland protest, but ultimately, Fritz has to obey orders and the civilians are executed.

The killing of Kolya has a profound effect on the already demoralized soldiers; Witzland, G.G., and Reiser decide to desert. They head to Pitomnik Airfield in hopes of catching a plane back to Germany, stealing medical tags from some dead bodies along the way to feign being wounded. The last transport plane is about to leave as they arrive, but only officers are allowed aboard. Fritz asks why Hans, an officer, did not try to board, to no response.

They rejoin the others in the shelter, where they find Musk suffering from severe trench foot. While the men recover a German supply drop, Haller appears and holds them at gunpoint, but is quickly subdued; he accidentally shoots G.G. as he falls, killing him. Haller pleads for his life, first trying to use his authority, then telling them about the supplies he is hoarding in a nearby house, before being executed by Otto.

In the house&#x27;s cellar, they find shelves stocked full of food and liquor, and Irina tied to a bed. Witzland cuts her free. She tries to provoke Witzland into killing her, but he refuses, instead giving her a pistol and telling her to do it herself. She cannot do it. As the rest of the men enjoy the luxuries, a deluded and dying Musk tries to rally them to rejoin the fighting. Otto becomes hysterical and shoots himself in the head. Rollo carries Musk outside, only to find the Sixth Army surrendering to the Soviets. Musk succumbs to the elements upon Rollo being instructed to surrender.

Irina offers to help Witzland and Reiser get away, but while trudging through a heavy snowstorm, they are shot at by Russian soldiers; Irina is killed instantly and Witzland is shot. Wounded and overwhelmed with grief, he eventually becomes too weak to walk, dying in Reiser&#x27;s arms. Reiser cradles his body and freezes to death.

==Production and release==
The film was shot in several locations, including Finland, Italy, and Czechoslovakia, and cost approximately DEM 20 million (around EUR 10 million in modern German currency). Director Joseph Vilsmaier hired a German military consultant to advise him on set. A series entitled &quot;The making of Stalingrad&quot; was released, featuring a behind-the-scenes look at the film. &quot;Stalingrad&quot; was released on 4K Blu-ray in 2021.

==Reception==
In 1993, the film won Bavarian Film Awards for Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Production. It was also entered into the 18th Moscow International Film Festival. In Germany, the film earned mixed reviews, allegedly due to the second half of the film containing plot holes, although what these apparent plot holes were is not revealed; this may in fact have been a reference to the film&#x27;s bleak and nihilistic ending.

The film grossed $10 million in Germany. It grossed $152,972 in the United States and Canada.

<doc id="1040741" wikidata="Q4355306" url="?curid=1040741" title="Moral psychology">
<text>Moral psychology is the study of human thought and behavior in ethical contexts. Historically, the term &quot;moral psychology&quot; was used relatively narrowly to refer to the study of moral development. This field of study is interdisciplinary between the application of philosophy and psychology. Moral psychology eventually came to refer more broadly to various topics at the intersection of ethics, psychology, and philosophy of mind. Some of the main topics of the field are moral judgment, moral reasoning, moral satisficing, moral sensitivity, moral responsibility, moral motivation, moral identity, moral action, moral development, moral diversity, moral character (especially as related to virtue ethics), altruism, psychological egoism, moral luck, moral forecasting, moral emotion, affective forecasting, and moral disagreement.

Today, moral psychology is a thriving area of research spanning many disciplines, with major bodies of research on the biological, cognitive/computational and cultural basis of moral judgment and behavior, and a growing body of research on moral judgment in the context of artificial intelligence.

==History==
The origins of moral psychology can be traced back to early philosophical works, largely concerned with moral education, such as by Plato and Aristotle in Ancient Greece, as well as from the Buddhist and Confucian traditions. Empirical studies of moral judgment go back at least as far as the 1890s with the work of Frank Chapman Sharp, coinciding with the development of psychology as a discipline separate from philosophy. Since at least 1894, philosophers and psychologists attempted to empirically evaluate the morality of an individual, especially attempting to distinguish adults from children in terms of their judgment. Unfortunately, these efforts failed because they &quot;attempted to quantify how much morality an individual had—a notably contentious idea—rather than understand the individual&#x27;s psychological representation of morality&quot;.

In most introductory psychology courses, students learn about moral psychology by studying the psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg, who proposed a highly influential theory of moral development, developed throughout the 1950s and 1960s. This theory was built on Piaget&#x27;s observation that children develop intuitions about justice that they can later articulate. Kohlberg proposed six stages broken into three categories of moral reasoning that he believed to be universal to all people in all cultures. The increasing sophistication of justice-based reasoning was taken as a sign of development. Moral cognitive development, in turn, was assumed to be a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for moral action.

But researchers using the Kohlberg model found a gap between what people said was most moral and actions they took. In response, Augusto Blasi proposed his self-model that links ideas of moral judgment and action through moral commitment. Those with moral goals central to the self-concept are more likely to take moral action, as they feel a greater obligation to do so. Those who are motivated will attain a unique moral identity.

Following the independent publication of a pair of landmark papers in 2001 (respectively led by Jonathan Haidt and Joshua Greene), there was a surge in interest in moral psychology across a broad range of subfields of psychology, with interest shifting away from developmental processes towards a greater emphasis on social, cognitive, affective and neural processes involved in moral judgment.

==Methods==
Philosophers, psychologists and researchers from other fields have created various methods for studying topics in moral psychology, with empirical studies dating back to at least the 1890s. The methods used in these studies include moral dilemmas such as the trolley problem, structured interviews and surveys as a means to study moral psychology and its development, as well as the use of economic games, neuroimaging, and studies of natural language use.

===Interview techniques===
In 1963, Lawrence Kohlberg presented an approach to studying differences in moral judgment by modeling evaluative diversity as reflecting a series of developmental stages (à la Jean Piaget). Lawrence Kohlberg&#x27;s stages of moral development are:
# Obedience and punishment orientation
# Self-interest orientation
# Interpersonal accord and conformity
# Authority and social-order maintaining orientation
# Social contract orientation
# Universal ethical principles

Stages 1 and 2 are combined into a single stage labeled &quot;pre-conventional&quot;, and stages 5 and 6 are combined into a single stage labeled &quot;post-conventional&quot; for the same reason; psychologists can consistently categorize subjects into the resulting four stages using the &quot;Moral Judgement Interview&quot; which asks subjects why they endorse the answers they do to a standard set of moral dilemmas.

===Survey instruments===
Between 1910 and 1930, in the United States and Europe, several morality tests were developed to classify subjects as either fit or unfit to make moral judgments. Test-takers would classify or rank standardized lists of personality traits, hypothetical actions, or pictures of hypothetical scenes. As early as 1926, catalogs of personality tests included sections specifically for morality tests, though critics persuasively argued that they merely measured intelligence or awareness of social expectations.

Meanwhile, Kohlberg inspired a new series of morality tests. The Defining Issues Test (dubbed &quot;Neo-Kohlbergian&quot; by its constituents) scores relative preference for post-conventional justifications, and the Moral Judgment Test scores consistency of one&#x27;s preferred justifications. Both treat evaluative ability as similar to IQ (hence the single score), allowing categorization by high score vs. low score.

Among the more recently developed survey measures, the Moral Foundations Questionnaire is a widely used survey measure of the five moral intuitions proposed by Moral Foundations Theory: care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and sanctity/degradation. The questions ask respondents to rate various considerations in terms of how relevant they are to the respondent&#x27;s moral judgments. The purpose of the questionnaire is to measure the degree to which people rely upon each of the five moral intuitions (which may coexist). The new and improved version of this instrument (i.e., Moral Foundations Questionnaire-2; MFQ-2) was developed in 2023. In this version, Fairness was split to Equality and Proportionality. Hence, the MFQ-2 measures Care, Equality, Proportionality, Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. In addition to survey instruments measuring endorsement of moral foundations, a number of other contemporary survey measures exist relating to other broad taxonomies of moral values, as well as more specific moral beliefs, or concerns.

==Evolutionary origins==


According to Haidt, the belief that morality is not innate was one of the few theoretical commitments uniting many of the prominent psychologists studying morality in the twentieth century (with some exceptions). A substantial amount of research in recent decades has focused on the evolutionary origins of various aspects of morality.

In &quot;Unto Others: the Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior&quot; (1998), Elliott Sober and David Sloan Wilson demonstrated that diverse moralities could evolve through group selection. In particular, they dismantled the idea that natural selection will favor a homogeneous population in which all creatures care only about their own personal welfare and/or behave only in ways which advance their own personal reproduction.

Tim Dean has advanced the more general claim that moral diversity would evolve through frequency-dependent selection because each moral approach is vulnerable to a different set of situations which threatened our ancestors.

==Topics and theories==

===Moral identity===

Moral identity refers to the importance of morality to a person&#x27;s identity, typically construed as either a trait-like individual difference, or set of chronically accessible schemas. There are considered to be two main levels of perspective on moral identity. One of them the trait-based perspective theory where certain personality traits are triggered during moral situations. The second perspective is the socio-cognitive perspective where these moral identities are a &quot;self-schema&quot; that will occur due to the social environment. Moral identity is theorized to be one of the key motivational forces connecting moral reasoning to moral behavior, as suggested by a 2016 meta-analysis reporting that moral identity is positively (albeit only modestly) associated with moral behavior. Although moral identity mainly focuses on a moral action there is sometimes &quot;moral disengagement&quot; that will take place too reduce the negative consequences of an action or lack of action.

=== Moral satisficing ===
The theory of moral satisficing applies the study of ecological rationality to moral behavior. In this view, much of moral behavior is based on social heuristics rather than traits, virtues, or utilitarian calculations. Social heuristics are a form of satisficing, a term coined by Nobel laureate Herbert Simon. Social heuristics are not good or bad, or beneficial or harmful, per se, but solely in relation to the environments in which they are used. For instance, an adolescent may commit a crime not because of an evil character or a utilitarian calculation but due to following the social heuristic “do what your peers do.” After shifting to a different peer group, the same person&#x27;s behavior may shift to a more socially desirable outcome – by relying on the very same heuristic. From this perspective, moral behavior is thus not simply a consequence of inner virtue or traits, but a function of both the mind and the environment, a view based on Simon&#x27;s scissors analogy. Many other moral theories, in contrast, consider the mind alone, such as Kohlberg&#x27;s state theory, identity theories, virtue theories, and willpower theories.

The ecological perspective has methodological implications for the study of morality: According to it, behavior needs to be studied in social groups and not only in individuals, in natural environments and not only in labs. Both principles are violated, for instance, by the study of how individuals respond to artificial trolley problems. The theory of moral satisficing also has implications for moral policy, implying that problematic behavior can be changed by changing the environment, not only the individual.

Darwin argued that one original function of morality was the coherence and coordination of groups. This suggests that social heuristics that generate coherence and coordination are also those that guide moral behavior. These social heuristics include imitate-your-peers, equality (divide a resource equally), and tit-for-tat (be kind first, then imitate your partner&#x27;s behavior). In general, the social heuristics of individuals or institutions shape their moral fabric.

Moral satisficing explains two phenomena that pose a puzzle for virtue and trait theories: moral luck and systematic inconsistencies, as when teens who voluntarily made a virginity pledge were just as likely to have premarital sex as their peers who did not. From an ecological view of morality, such inconsistencies are to be expected when individuals move from one environment to another.

Nagel (1979, p. 59) defines moral luck as follows: ‘‘Where a significant aspect of what someone does depends on factors beyond his control, yet we continue to treat him in that respect as an object of moral judgment, it can be called moral luck.’’ Others voiced concerns that moral luck poses a limit to improving our moral behavior and makes it difficult to evaluate behavior as right or wrong. Yet this concern is based on an internal view of the causes of moral behavior; from an ecological view, moral luck is an inevitable consequence of the interaction between mind and environment. A teen is morally lucky to have not grown up in a criminal peer group, and an adult is morally lucky to have not been conscripted into an army.

Moral satisficing postulates that behavior is guided by social heuristics, not by moral rules such as “don’t kill”, as assumed in theories of moral heuristics or in Hauser&#x27;s “moral grammar” with hard-wired moral rules. Moral satisficing postulates that moral rules are essentially social heuristics that ultimately serve the coordination and cooperation of social groups.

===Moral values===
Psychologist Shalom Schwartz defines individual values as &quot;conceptions of the desirable that guide the way social actors (e.g. organisational leaders, policymakers, individual persons) select actions, evaluate people at events, and explain their actions and evaluations.&quot; Cultural values form the basis for social norms, laws, customs and practices. While individual values vary case by case (a result of unique life experience), the average of these values point to widely held cultural beliefs (a result of shared cultural values).

Kristiansen and Hotte reviewed many research articles regarding people&#x27;s values and attitudes and whether they guide behavior. With the research they reviewed and their own extension of Ajzen and Fishbein&#x27;s theory of reasoned action, they conclude that value-attitude-behavior depends on the individual and their moral reasoning. Another issue that Kristiansen and Hotte discovered through their research was that individuals tended to &quot;create&quot; values to justify their reactions to certain situations, which they called the &quot;value justification hypothesis&quot;. Their theory is comparable to Jonathan Haidt&#x27;s social intuitionist theory, where individuals justify their intuitive emotions and actions through post-hoc moral reasoning.

Kristiansen and Hotte also found that independent selves had actions and behaviors that are influenced by their own thoughts and feelings, but Interdependent selves have actions, behaviors and self-concepts that were based on the thoughts and feelings of others. Westerners have two dimensions of emotions, activation and pleasantness. The Japanese have one more, the range of their interdependent relationships. Markus and Kitayama found that these two different types of values had different motives. Westerners, in their explanations, show self-bettering biases. Easterners, on the other hand, tend to focus on &quot;other-oriented&quot; biases.

====Moral foundations theory====

Moral foundations theory, first proposed in 2004 by Jonathan Haidt and Craig Joseph, attempts to explain the origins of and variation in human moral reasoning on the basis of innate, modular foundations. Notably, moral foundations theory has been used to describe the difference between the moral foundations of political liberals and political conservatives. Haidt and Joseph expanded on previous research done by Shweder and his three ethics theory. Shweder&#x27;s theory consisted of three moral ethics: the ethics of community, autonomy, and divinity. Haidt and Graham took this theory and extended it to discuss the five psychological systems that more specifically make up the three moral ethics theory. These Five Foundations of Morality and their importance vary throughout each culture and construct virtues based on their emphasized foundation. 
The five psychological foundations are:
* Harm/care, which starts with the sensitivity to signs of suffering in offspring and develops into a general dislike of seeing suffering in others and the potential to feel compassion in response.
* Fairness/reciprocity, which is developed when someone observes or engages in reciprocal interactions. This foundation is concerned with virtues related to fairness and justice. 
* Ingroup/loyalty, which constitutes recognizing, trusting, and cooperating with members of one&#x27;s ingroup as well as being wary of members of other groups.
* Authority/respect, which is how someone navigates in a hierarchal ingroups and communities.
* Purity/sanctity, which stems from the emotion of disgust that guards the body by responding to elicitors that are biologically or culturally linked to disease transmission.
The five foundations theory are both a nativist and cultural-psychological theory. Modern moral psychology concedes that &quot;morality is about protecting individuals&quot; and focuses primarily on issues of justice (harm/care and fairness/reciprocity). Their research found that &quot;justice and related virtues...make up half of the moral world for liberals, while justice-related concerns make up only one fifth of the moral world for conservatives&quot;. Liberals value harm/care and fairness/reciprocity significantly more than the other moralities, while conservatives value all five equally. Ownership has also been argued to be a strong candidate to be a moral foundation.

===Moral virtues===
In 2004, D. Lapsley and D. Narvaez outlined how social cognition explains aspects of moral functioning. Their social cognitive approach to personality has six critical resources of moral personality: cognition, self-processes, affective elements of personality, changing social context, lawful situational variability, and the integration of other literature. Lapsley and Narvaez suggest that moral values and actions stem from more than our virtues and are controlled by a set of self-created schemas (cognitive structures that organize related concepts and integrate past events). They claim that schemas are &quot;fundamental to our very ability to notice dilemmas as we appraise the moral landscape&quot; and that over time, people develop greater &quot;moral expertise&quot;.

==== Triune ethics theory ====

The triune ethics meta-theory (TEM) has been proposed by Darcia Narvaez as a metatheory that highlights the relative contributions to moral development of biological inheritance (including human evolutionary adaptations), environmental influences on neurobiology, and the role of culture. TET proposes three basic mindsets that shape ethical behavior: self-protectionism (a variety of types), engagement, and imagination (a variety of types that are fueled by protectionism or engagement). A mindset influences perception, affordances, and rhetorical preferences. Actions taken within a mindset become an ethic when they trump other values. Engagement and communal imagination represent optimal human functioning that are shaped by the evolved developmental niche (evolved nest) that supports optimal psychosocial neurobiological development. Based on worldwide anthropological research (e.g., Hewlett and Lamb&#x27;s Hunter-Gatherer Childhoods), Narvaez uses small-band hunter-gatherers as a baseline for the evolved nest and its effects.

===Moral reasoning and development===
Moral development and reasoning are two overlapping topics of study in moral psychology that have historically received a great amount of attention, even preceding the influential work of Piaget and Kohlberg. Moral reasoning refers specifically to the study of how people think about right and wrong and how they acquire and apply moral rules. Moral development refers more broadly to age-related changes in thoughts and emotions that guide moral beliefs, judgments and behaviors.

====Kohlberg&#x27;s stage theory====

Jean Piaget, in watching children play games, noted how their rationales for cooperation changed with experience and maturation. He identified two stages, (morality centered outside the self) and autonomous (internalized morality). Lawerence Kohlberg sought to expand Piaget&#x27;s work. His cognitive developmental theory of moral reasoning dominated the field for decades. He focused on moral development as one&#x27;s progression in the capacity to reason about justice. Kohlberg&#x27;s interview method included hypothetical moral dilemmas or conflicts of interest (most notably, the Heinz dilemma). He proposed six stages and three levels of development (claiming that &quot;anyone who interviewed children about dilemmas and who followed them longitudinally in time would come to our six stages and no others). At the Preconventional level, the first two stages included the punishment-and-obedience orientation and the instrumental-relativist orientation. The next level, the conventional level, included the interpersonal concordance or &quot;good boy – nice girl&quot; orientation, along with the &quot;law and order&quot; orientation. Lastly, the final Postconventional level consisted of the social-contract, legalistic orientation and the universal-ethical-principle orientation. According to Kohlberg, an individual is considered more cognitively mature depending on their stage of moral reasoning, which grows as they advance in education and world experience.

Critics of Kohlberg&#x27;s approach (such as Carol Gilligan and Jane Attanucci) argue that there is an over-emphasis on justice and an under-emphasis on an additional perspective to moral reasoning, known as the care perspective. The justice perspective draws attention to inequality and oppression, while striving for reciprocal rights and equal respect for all. The care perspective draws attention to the ideas of detachment and abandonment, while striving for attention and response to people who need it. Care Orientation is relationally based. It has a more situational focus that is dependent on the needs of others as opposed to Justice Orientation&#x27;s objectivity. However, reviews by others have found that Gilligan&#x27;s theory was not supported by empirical studies since orientations are individual dependent. In fact, in neo-Kohlbergian studies with the Defining Issues Test, females tend to get slightly higher scores than males.

==== The attachment approach to moral judgment ====
Aner Govrin&#x27;s attachment approach to moral judgment proposes that, through early interactions with the caregiver, the child acquires an internal representation of a system of rules that determine how right/wrong judgments are to be construed, used, and understood. By breaking moral situations down into their defining features, the attachment model of moral judgment outlines a framework for a universal moral faculty based on a universal, innate, deep structure that appears uniformly in the structure of almost all moral judgments regardless of their content.

===Moral behaviour===
Historically, major topics of study in the domain of moral behavior have included violence and altruism, bystander intervention and obedience to authority (e.g., the Milgram experiment and Stanford prison experiment). Recent research on moral behavior uses a wide range of methods, including using experience sampling to try and estimate the actual prevalence of various kinds of moral behavior in everyday life. Research has also focused on variation in moral behavior over time, through studies of phenomena such as moral licensing. Yet other studies focusing on social preferences examine various kinds of resource allocation decisions, or use incentivized behavioral experiments to investigate the way people weighted their own interests against other people&#x27;s when deciding whether to harm others, for example, by examine how willing people are to administer electric shocks to themselves vs. others in exchange for money.

James Rest reviewed the literature on moral functioning and identified at least four components necessary for a moral behavior to take place:
* Sensitivity – noticing and interpreting the situation
* Reasoning and making a judgment regarding the best (most moral) option
* Motivation (in the moment but also habitually, such as moral identity)
* Implementation - having the skills and perseverance to carry out the action
Reynolds and Ceranic researched the effects of social consensus on one&#x27;s moral behavior. Depending on the level of social consensus (high vs. low), moral behaviors will require greater or lesser degrees of moral identity to motivate an individual to make a choice and endorse a behavior. Also, depending on social consensus, particular behaviors may require different levels of moral reasoning.

More recent attempts to develop an integrated model of moral motivation have identified at least six different levels of moral functioning, each of which has been shown to predict some type of moral or pro-social behavior: moral intuitions, moral emotions, moral virtues/vices (behavioral capacities), moral values, moral reasoning, and moral willpower. This social intuitionist model of moral motivation suggests that moral behaviors are typically the product of multiple levels of moral functioning, and are usually energized by the &quot;hotter&quot; levels of intuition, emotion, and behavioral virtue/vice. The &quot;cooler&quot; levels of values, reasoning, and willpower, while still important, are proposed to be secondary to the more affect-intensive processes.

Moral behavior is also studied under the umbrella of personality psychology. Topics within personality psychology include the traits or individual differences underlying moral behavior, such as generativity, self-control, agreeableness, cooperativeness and honesty/humility, as well as moral change goals, among many other topics.

Regarding interventions aimed at shaping moral behavior, a 2009 meta analysis of business ethics instruction programs found that such programs have only &quot;a minimal impact on increasing outcomes related to ethical perceptions, behavior, or awareness.&quot; A 2005 meta analysis suggested that positive affect can at least momentarily increase prosocial behavior (with subsequent meta analyses also showing that prosocial behavior reciprocally increases positive affect in the actor).

====Value-behavior consistency====

In looking at the relations between moral values, attitudes, and behaviors, previous research asserts that there is less correspondence between these three aspects than one might assume. In fact, it seems to be more common for people to label their behaviors with a justifying value rather than having a value beforehand and then acting on it. There are some people that are more likely to act on their personal values: those low in self-monitoring and high in self-consciousness, due to the fact that they are more aware of themselves and less aware of how others may perceive them. Self-consciousness here means being literally more conscious of yourself, not fearing judgement or feeling anxiety from others. Social situations and the different categories of norms can be telling of when people may act in accordance with their values, but this still is not concrete either. People will typically act in accordance with social, contextual and personal norms, and there is a likelihood that these norms can also follow one&#x27;s moral values. Though there are certain assumptions and situations that would suggest a major value-attitude-behavior relation, there is not enough research to confirm this phenomenon.

====Moral willpower====
Building on earlier work by Metcalfe and Mischel on delayed gratification, Baumeister, Miller, and Delaney explored the notion of willpower by first defining the self as being made up of three parts: reflexive consciousness, or the person&#x27;s awareness of their environment and of himself as an individual; interpersonal being, which seeks to mold the self into one that will be accepted by others; and executive function. They stated, &quot;[T]he self can free its actions from being determined by particular influences, especially those of which it is aware&quot;. The three prevalent theories of willpower describe it as a limited supply of energy, as a cognitive process, and as a skill that is developed over time. Research has largely supported that willpower works like a &quot;moral muscle&quot; with a limited supply of strength that may be depleted (a process referred to as Ego depletion), conserved, or replenished, and that a single act requiring much self-control can significantly deplete the &quot;supply&quot; of willpower. While exertion reduces the ability to engage in further acts of willpower in the short term, such exertions actually improve a person&#x27;s ability to exert willpower for extended periods in the long run. Additional research has been conducted that may cast doubt on the idea of ego-depletion.

===Moral intuitions===

In 2001, Jonathan Haidt introduced his social intuitionist model which claimed that with few exceptions, moral judgments are made based upon socially derived intuitions. Moral intuitions happen immediately, automatically, and unconsciously, with reasoning largely serving to generate post-hoc rationalizations to justify one&#x27;s instinctual reactions. He provides four arguments to doubt causal importance of reason. Firstly, Haidt argues that since there is a dual process system in the brain when making automatic evaluations or assessments, this same process must be applicable to moral judgement as well. The second argument, based on research on motivated reasoning, claims that people behave like &quot;intuitive lawyers&quot;, searching primarily for evidence that will serve motives for social relatedness and attitudinal coherence. Thirdly, Haidt found that people have post hoc reasoning when faced with a moral situation, this a posteriori (after the fact) explanation gives the illusion of objective moral judgement but in reality is subjective to one&#x27;s gut feeling. Lastly, research has shown that moral emotion has a stronger link to moral action than moral reasoning, citing Damasio&#x27;s research on the somatic marker hypothesis and Batson&#x27;s empathy-altruism hypothesis.

Similarly, in his theory of moral satisficing, Gerd Gigerenzer argues that moral behavior is not solely a result of deliberate reasoning but also of social heuristics that are embedded in social environments. In other words, intuitionist theories can use heuristics to explain intuition. He emphasizes that these are key to understanding moral behavior.  Modifying moral behavior therefore entails changing heuristics and/or modifying environments rather than focussing on individuals. In this way, moral satisficing extends social intuitionism by adding both concrete heuristics and a focus on the environments with which the heuristics interact to produce behavior.

Following the publication of a landmark fMRI study in 2001, Joshua Greene separately proposed his dual process theory of moral judgment, according to which intuitive/emotional and deliberative processes respectively give rise to characteristically deontological and consequentialist moral judgments. A &quot;deontologist&quot; is someone who has rule-based morality that is mainly focused on duties and rights; in contrast, a &quot;consequentialist&quot; is someone who believes that only the best overall consequences ultimately matter.

===Moral emotions===
Moral emotions are a variety of social emotion that are involved in forming and communicating moral judgments and decisions, and in motivating behavioral responses to one&#x27;s own and others&#x27; moral behavior.
While moral reasoning has been the focus of most study of morality dating back to Plato and Aristotle, the emotive side of morality was historically looked upon with disdain in early moral psychology research. However, in the last 30–40 years, there has been a rise in a new front of research: moral emotions as the basis for moral behavior. This development began with a focus on empathy and guilt, but has since moved on to encompass new scholarship on emotions such as anger, shame, disgust, awe, and elevation. While different moral transgressions have been linked to different emotional reactions, bodily reactions to such transgressions are not too different and can be characterized by some felt activations in the gut area as well as the head area.

===Moralization and moral conviction===

Moralization, a term introduced to moral psychology by Paul Rozin, refers to the process through which preferences are converted into values. Relatedly, Linda Skitka and colleagues have introduced the concept of moral conviction, which refers to a &quot;strong and absolute belief that something is right or wrong, moral or immoral.&quot; According to Skitka&#x27;s integrated theory of moral conviction (ITMC), attitudes held with moral conviction, known as moral mandates, differ from strong but non-moral attitudes in a number of important ways. Namely, moral mandates derive their motivational force from their perceived universality, perceived objectivity, and strong ties to emotion. Perceived universality refers to the notion that individuals experience moral mandates as transcending persons and cultures; additionally, they are regarded as matters of fact. Regarding association with emotion, ITMC is consistent with Jonathan Haidt&#x27;s social intuitionist model in stating that moral judgments are accompanied by discrete moral emotions (i.e., disgust, shame, guilt). Importantly, Skitka maintains that moral mandates are not the same thing as moral values. Whether an issue will be associated with moral conviction varies across persons.

One of the main lines of IMTC research addresses the behavioral implications of moral mandates. Individuals prefer greater social and physical distance from attitudinally dissimilar others when moral conviction was high. This effect of moral conviction could not be explained by traditional measures of attitude strength, extremity, or centrality. Skitka, Bauman, and Sargis placed participants in either attitudinally heterogeneous or homogenous groups to discuss procedures regarding two morally mandated issues, abortion and capital punishment. Those in attitudinally heterogeneous groups demonstrated the least amount of goodwill towards other group members, the least amount of cooperation, and the most tension/defensiveness. Furthermore, individuals discussing a morally mandated issue were less likely to reach a consensus compared to those discussing non-moral issues.

=== Moral Enhancement ===
&quot;Main Article:&quot; Moral enhancement

Moral Enhancement (abbreviated ME), also called moral bioenhancement (abbreviated MBE), is the use of biomedical technology to morally improve individuals. There is another subdiscipline under moral enhancement which is denoted as Traditional Moral Enhancement (TME).   Moral Enhancement is also considered the altering of moral behavior, moral traits, moral decision making, and or cognitive abilities but there hasn&#x27;t been a clear cut definition of what it all entails. A scholar by the name of J.B.S Haldane made a statement &quot;it is only hopeful if mankind can adjust its morality to its powers.&quot; Haldane had a focus on using moral enhancement to improve the way society as whole functioned to increase the balance between morality and the usage of science.

==Intersections with other fields==
===Sociological applications===
Some research shows that people tend to self-segregate based on moral and political views, exaggerate the magnitude of moral disagreements across political divides, and avoid exposure to the opinions of those with opposing political views.

===Normative implications===
Researchers have begun to debate the implications (if any) moral psychology research has for other subfields of ethics such as normative ethics and meta-ethics. For example Peter Singer, citing Haidt&#x27;s work on social intuitionism and Greene&#x27;s dual process theory, presented an &quot;evolutionary debunking argument&quot; suggesting that the normative force of our moral intuitions is undermined by their being the &quot;biological residue of our evolutionary history.&quot; John Michael Doris discusses the way in which social psychological experiments—such as the Stanford prison experiments involving the idea of situationism—call into question a key component in virtue ethics: the idea that individuals have a single, environment-independent moral character. As a further example, Shaun Nichols (2004) examines how empirical data on psychopathology suggests that moral rationalism is false.

Additionally, research in moral psychology is being used to inform debates in applied ethics around moral enhancement.

===Robotics and artificial intelligence===

At the intersection of moral psychology and machine ethics, researchers have begun to study people&#x27;s views regarding the potentially ethically significant decisions that will be made by self-driving cars.

Mohammad Atari and his colleagues recently examined the moral psychology of the famous chatbot, ChatGPT. These authors asked in their title, &quot;which humans?&quot; — rhetorically pointing out that people should not ask how &quot;human-like&quot; machine morality is, but to which humans it resembles. These authors discovered that Large Language Models (LLMs), especially ChatGPT, tend to echo moral values endorsed by Westerners, as their training datasets originate predominantly from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. This study points out that compared to the global average, people from WEIRD societies are more inclined toward individualism and impersonal prosocial behaviors while showing less traditionalism and group loyalty. The authors further highlighted that societies less aligned with these WEIRD moral values tend to experience greater misalignment with the moral values and outputs of ChatGPT.

Gerd Gigerenzer argued that the focus of AI ethics should reach far beyond the question whether an AI system has a moral bias or is able to exhibit human-like moral responses. It also needs to investigate the actual motives and ethical behavior of the people behind the AI. Contrary to the 1990s dream of an egalitarian internet providing honest and accurate information to all, various tech billionaires and politicians have highly succeeded in leveraging AI for their own purposes of surveillance and control, for tolerating systematic misinformation for profit, and for increasing their individual power to the detriment of a democracy.

<text>Denny Blaine Park is a water-front park in the Denny-Blaine neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. With picturesque views of Bellevue directly across the lake and Mount Rainier in the distance, it is primarily used for picnicking, sunbathing, and swimming. The park has also been one of Seattle&#x27;s unofficial queer- and trans-friendly clothing optional beaches since the 1970s.

The park area consists of three tiers, in addition to a grassy area within the oval loop of E. Denny Blaine Place. The upper level between the parking lot and the original seawall is grass covered and has several large trees that provide shade. The middle level between the lake-side base of the seawall and the beach area is also grass. The lower lake level encompasses a sandy beach area with a rocky shoreline that is covered with small, smooth river pebble extending the first few feet into the lake.

Denny Blaine Park is located on the western shore of Lake Washington, where historic Lake Washington Boulevard turns inland towards Washington Park Arboretum. It is sometimes referred to as Denny Blaine Beach.

Nearby public beaches with lifeguard and full handicap accessibility include Madrona Park south and Madison Park north. Other parks in close vicinity include Viretta Park, Howell Park, and Lakeview Park.

Denny Blaine Park (as it is now named) was created on April 15, 1901 when the plat for the Denny-Blaine-Lake Park Addition was filed with the city of Seattle. As part of the plat filing, which also established four other parks, landowners Charles L. Denny and Viretta Denny (husband and wife) dedicated all of the streets, lanes, parks, fountains, and places therein &quot;to the use of the Public and the City of Seattle forever&quot;.

E. F. Blaine and C. L. Denny were proponents of open space parks for use by anyone in the city rather than restricting use to the residents within the subdivision, or alternatively, developing the parks for commercial recreation, amusement, or carnival-type activities such as at Madrona and Leschi parks to the south. The Denny&#x27;s dedication of these open space parks to the city was like that of David Denny (Charles’ uncle), who donated 6 acres of land in 1883 to create Seattle’s first public park, now named Denny Park in his honor. E. F. Blaine continued to establish his reputation as an aggressive friend of the public open space park concept through his service on the Park Commission from 1902 to 1908.

The park was unnamed in the filed plat. Because the park was located at the end of the oval turn-around named Whitman Place, many people referred to it as Whitman Park though that was never an official name.

A colorized postcard of the park, initially published as early as 1904, labeled it as Denny-Blaine Park, though references to &quot;Denny-Blaine Park&quot; in reports from the Parks Board in the early years included all five parks in the Denny-Blaine-Lake Park subdivision as a single entity. After the City Council—in order to reduce confusion with a Whitman Ave elsewhere in the city—renamed Whitman Place to Denny Blaine Place in 1918, the park area with its newly exposed beach started to become better known as Denny-Blaine Park on its own. Currently, the official park name by Seattle Parks and Recreation omits the hyphen which had been used until at least the 1970s.

Initial construction and landscaping of the park was provided by the Denny Blaine Land Company, which still privately owned the land. During that time, a parks department letter in 1908 and reports through 1916 indicate that &quot;maintenance (only)&quot; was being provided by the parks department, as required by the conditions of the plat. In 1932, Denny-Blaine Park was transferred to the city and placed under Park Jurisdiction.

=== Inclusion in the Olmsted System of Parks &amp; Boulevards ===

Denny Blaine Park (aka Whitman Place) is referred to as the &quot;water terrace&quot; located at the &quot;North End of Denny Blain-Lake Park&quot; in a revised preliminary draft of the 1903 Olmsted Report, sent near the end of July 1903 from John Charles Olmsted to E. F. Blaine, Chairman of the Board of Park Commissioners. In that report, the water terrace location is the reference point at which the proposed &quot;pleasure drive&quot; running northward along Lake Washington from Bailey Peninsula (Seward Park) transitions inland to run northwest towards Washington Park. Olmsted further recommended that “all the land between these streets (Lake Washington Blvd) and the lake in the Denny-Blaine subdivision should be acquired [by the city]”, an area that, if acquired, would have encompassed both Denny Blaine Park and Howell Park.

Denny Blaine Park (&quot;water terrace&quot;) is included within the areas marked by Olmsted on the 1903 map, the 1908 map, and the 1928 map of the &quot;Olmsted System [of] Parks, Boulevards and Playgrounds of the City of Seattle&quot;.

The 1909 Annual Report by the Board of Park Commissioners—which celebrated the history of the Park Board since its founding in 1884 and its success to date implementing the 1903 and 1908 Olmsted reports—included Denny Blaine Park in the list of &quot;fully improved parks&quot;. The same report also honored the service of retired commissioner Blaine, “father of the Seattle Park System,” who had served from 1902 to 1908.

In 2016, Denny Blaine Park was added to the National Register of Historic Places as part of the multiple property submission for Seattle&#x27;s Olmsted Parks and Boulevards (1903–68).

=== Features ===
The plat drawing depicts a shoreline “esplanade” along a seawall, located at the end of a wide turnaround that formed an open space loop in the middle. The drawing also appears to depict a fountain within the oval area, but was never installed.
The seawall (as drawn in the plat) was already under construction—and likely completed—in 1900, a year before the plat was filed; with the wharf also being built that year or shortly thereafter (no later than May, 1903). Additional features at that time evidently included a boat facility, an oval shaped lagoon with narrow passage to the lake, a small rustic shelter, and paths, lawn, and landscaping.

In 1917, the water level dropped by 9 feet after the anticipated Montlake Cut connecting Lake Washington to South Lake Union was completed, leaving the seawall &quot;high and dry&quot; with a gently sloping beach that became usable after removing exposed debris and smoothing. The seawall remains today as reminder to the original shoreline, and the beach area is reached via the two sets of stairs that had been built into the seawall as depicted on the original plat of 1901.

Around the time Whitney Place was renamed, the turnaround was paved as part of an L.I.D. project.

It is said the actor John Wayne rented the house to the South, and, due to people peeping over the wall, a hedge was put in running along the South border of the park, above the lower beach levels.

Much of a renovation completed in 2004 involved the large middle bed just above the shoreline.

==Topfree and clothing optional use==
Denny Blaine Park is not designated by Seattle Parks and Recreation as a clothing optional park, though it is recognized that it has been used as such, especially by the queer community, for over 50 years. Thus while clothing optional use is not sanctioned, neither is it unsanctioned since simply being naked in public is not illegal in Seattle. Regular nudists maintain the beach to a degree.

The first recorded (though unlikely the actual first) case of clothing optional use was when famed architect and Denny-Blaine neighbor Ellsworth Storey was arrested at Whitman Place for skinny dipping.

A letter to the Seattle Park Board (circa 1930s) protesting unruly behavior in the park noted &quot;there was an element of young people from &#x27;Coon Hollow&#x27; who ... come down there and change their clothes right in the open.&quot;

On May 1st, 1934, O. H. Lindstedt, manager of sporting goods at University Book Store, sent a letter to the Seattle Park Board President requesting they stop requiring men to wear body bathing suits at public beaches. Lindstedt noted that men were buying trunks, but avoiding lifeguarded beaches and instead swimming in places that are dangerous or at least unprotected. Denny Blaine Park, situated between public beaches at Madison Park and Madrona Park, would likely be one of the parks where men illegally swam and sunbathed topless in the 1930s.

In the 1970s, women began to go topless at Denny Blaine Park. These women, who predominantly identified as lesbian, referred to the park as Dykekiki Beach (a playful combination of the words Dyke and Waikiki Beach). News reports from the period include accounts that feminist groups on the beach were &quot;fairly aggressive&quot; in chasing other groups out of the park, including &quot;men who come to the park to ogle&quot;; Seattle Police cited 16 women for lewd conduct in one crackdown in 1988.

World Naked Bike Ride (WNBR) Seattle had its bodypainting party at the park on August 17, 2008, and returned on August 16, 2009, with Hemp Ride 2009 (affiliated with WNBR Seattle).

In 2010, several Seattle Parks and Recreation workers reported nudity and topless usage used to be more common; and male nudists cited different parks that were being commonly used as unofficial nude beaches at that time.

Clothing optional use at Denny Blaine Park became more diverse across gender and sexual orientation starting in the mid-2010s and has continued to grow in popularity, including a substantial increase by Seattle&#x27;s transgender community, especially in the years following the COVID lockdown. On warm summer days, it is not uncommon for all three tiers of the park to be fully utilized. The diversity and current popularity of the park was demonstrated on December 6, 2023 when an overflow crowd of around 400 people attended a Seattle Parks and Recreation &quot;community response&quot; meeting to voice their opposition to a proposed children&#x27;s play area and to speak on public record about how significant Denny Blaine Park—as a queer- and trans-friendly clothing optional park and beach—has been to them, with many sharing poignant and personal testimonies.

== Controversies ==
=== Neighborhood Park vs. City-wide Public Park usage ===
During the 1930s, after the beach began attracting use from those outside of the neighborhood and because the Park Board could not find monies for a lifeguard at this small beach, the Ostranders and other near-by eminent neighbors (“a veritable &#x27;who’s who&#x27; of Old Seattle”) filed complaints with the Parks Board and urged that bathing be prohibited. They even provided a sketch for a proposed sign that stated, “NO SWIMMING OR PICNICING (Parks Dept.) / Violators will be arrested” and listed alternate parks as &quot;Madison Public Beach (1 mile) / Madrona Public Beach (1 mile)&quot;. The Park Superintendent rejected posting the sign and refused to disallow public bathing. Such refusal to treat Whitman Place as a neighborhood park (similar to a refused request by neighbors of Madrona Park) is consistent not only with the founding intention of Denny and Blaine, but also that park was maintained by public funds and that (as of 1932) the park had been transferred to Park jurisdiction.

=== Top-free and naked usage ===
Prior to 1990, the Seattle Police Department would periodically issue citations under a then-current lewd conduct ordinance (City of Seattle 12A.10.070), though many continued with their top-free or even naked usage as a form of self-expression or even protest. In 1988, in an article titled “The Cops and The Tops,” the Seattle Weekly reported that police were citing nude sunbathers at Denny-Blaine beach for “lewd conduct” for the second year in a row. “For many women, it’s a matter of pride, and of gender politics, so they have continued to swim shirtless despite the tickets and the police patrols,” the article says.

After the city dropped the lewd conduct ordinance in 1990 following a ruling against them in Seattle v. Johnson, simply being top-free or even fully naked in public was no longer illegal conduct — despite frustrations periodically expressed through neighborhood community associations or via direct calls to the police.

=== Proposal to create a play area for neighborhood children ===
In 2023, Stuart Sloan, the owner of a 8,310-square-foot waterfront mansion that neighbors the park, began sending text messages to the personal cell phone number of Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell, complaining about the nude sunbathers at Denny Blaine Park. 

In the following months, Sloan met with a variety of City of Seattle officials to discuss building a playground at the park, ostensibly to curb nudity at the beach. According to a donation budget breakdown, Sloan committed to a donation of &quot;$1 million in &#x27;private funds&#x27;&quot; for the proposed park. 

Seattle Parks and Recreation staff presented the proposed play area during its November 2023 Board of Parks and Recreation Commissioners meeting, noting that it would be fully funded by an anonymous donor who initiated the proposal contingent on it being built at Denny Blaine Park. The play area, suitable for toddlers, would utilize one sixth of the upper tier space and consist of a single play element made from natural materials. 

During the proposal presentation, the following beneficial factors were cited: 

# Availability of funding; 
# Fills gap in play area coverage for this area, defined by the ability to walk within 15 minutes; 
# Supports the youth initiative priority; 
# Addresses a nature deficit; and 
# Increases accessibility to the shoreline.

The following challenges were also noted: 

# The site is currently used as a clothing optional (nudist) park; 
# The site is a historic Olmsted park, with classical forms that are reminiscent of Olmstead design; 
# The site would require improvements to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); 
# The city would be obligated to reimburse the donor if the project is started but not completed;
# There is limited shoreline access, so why put a kids area at this one (vs. at Madrona Beach); 
# The park has a long tradition of use by the LGBTQIA+ community along with other clothing-optional users who will object to being displaced; and
# The park serves the entire city, not just the neighborhood. 

At the conclusion, the presenter noted the next step was to gather community input before moving on to planning and permitting. The attending commissioners stressed that gathering this feedback was very important, including from the current users of the park.

As anticipated by the commissioners, the proposed play area generated a strong outcry from the LGBTQIA+ community and others who value continued clothing-optional use at Denny Blaine Park. This response included creating a &quot;Save Denny Blaine!&quot; information website, a petition to &quot;Halt the Construction of a Children&#x27;s Play Area at Denny Blaine Park&quot; that received over 9,000 signatures, and a &quot;Save Denny Blaine&quot; website page to contact elected officials. The public response meeting held in the auditorium of the Martin Luther King FAME Community Center on December 6, 2023 was attended by an overflow crowd of about 400 people who were nearly unanimous in their opposition to the proposal.

On December 8, 2023, Seattle Parks and Recreation announced the proposed play area project would not proceed, citing the feedback they received about the cohesion the current park usage brought to the LGBTQIA+ community and the potential unintended consequences of placing a play area at that beach. The announcement indicated they will evaluate other locations for a play area and will meet with leaders in the LGBTQIA+ community to “better understand the importance of this beach to the community and the hopes for future uses.”

On December 9, 2023, the day following the announcement that the project would not proceed, Mayor Harrell met with the would-be donor Stuart Sloan at University Village, the mall Sloan owns. According to the Mayor&#x27;s office, though, the Mayor did not know the identity of the anonymous donor and he did not discuss the donation for this project with Sloan at this meeting. A July 2024 report by KUOW-FM reviewed March 2023 text messages between Mayor Harrell and donor Sloan. This report found that the two had discussed the park, with Sloan sending pictures of nude park visitors to Harrell during his vacation, and the mayor responding to tell Sloan that, &quot;If you are disgusted I share your disgust.&quot; The text messages also revealed ongoing collaboration between Sloan and Harrell, which contradicted the earlier claim that the mayor had no knowledge about the identity of the donor. 

Since the decision to scrap the park proposal, neighbors of the park and activists who have organized a Friends of Denny Blaine Park group have met regularly with the Seattle Parks Foundation, a nonprofit that helps bridge the gap between private money and government agencies, in an attempt to &quot;end years of conflict over the beach.&quot; In June 2024, the City put forth a policy suggestion, which would create two zones in Deny Blaine Park: &quot;naked Zone A, composed of the grassy area and beach, and a clothed Zone B, consisting of the loop of road... outside the park where several neighbors live.&quot;

<text>Karafuto Prefecture, derived from the Japanese &quot;Karafuto Chō &quot;(,からふとちょう), was established by the Empire of Japan in 1907 to govern the southern part of Sakhalin, referred to by Japan as Karafuto. This territory became part of the Empire of Japan in 1905 after the Russo-Japanese War, when the portion of Sakhalin south of 50°N was ceded by the Russian Empire under the Treaty of Portsmouth.

Karafuto Prefecture was established in 1907 to govern Karafuto, which was part of Japan&#x27;s External Land (&quot;Gaichi&quot;), until it was incorporated into an Inner Land (&quot;Naichi&quot;) of the Japanese metropole in 1943. Ōtomari (Korsakov) was the capital of Karafuto from 1905 to 1908 and Toyohara (Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk) from 1908 to 1945. 

In August 1945, the Japanese administration ceased to function following the invasion of South Sakhalin by the Soviet Union. Karafuto Prefecture was de facto annexed to the Soviet Union, although it continued to exist de jure under Japanese law until it was formally abolished as a legal entity by Japan in June 1949.

==Name==
The Japanese name &quot;Karafuto&quot; purportedly comes from Ainu (), which means . It was formerly known as &quot;Kita Ezo&quot;, meaning Northern Ezo (Ezo was the former name for Hokkaido). When Japan governed the southern part of the island, they referred to it as &quot;Minami Karafuto&quot; (, South Karafuto) or simply &quot;Karafuto&quot; (). The northern part of the island was called &quot;Kita Karafuto&quot; (, North Karafuto) or simply &quot;Sagaren&quot; ().

In Russian, the entire island was named &quot;Sakhalin&quot; or &quot;Saghalien&quot;. It is from Manchu &quot;sahaliyan ula angga hada&quot;, meaning &quot;peak of the mouth of Amur River&quot;. The southern part was simply called &quot;Yuzhny Sakhalin&quot; (&quot;South Sakhalin&quot;). In Korean, the name is &quot;Sahallin&quot; or &quot;Hwataedo&quot;, with the latter name in use during Korea under Japanese rule.

==History==
Japanese settlement on Sakhalin dates to at least the Edo period. Ōtomari was established in 1679, and cartographers of the Matsumae domain mapped the island, and named it &quot;Kita-Ezo&quot;. Japanese cartographer and explorer Mamiya Rinzō established that Sakhalin was an island through his discovery of what is now named Mamiya Strait (Strait of Tartary) in 1809. Japan unilaterally proclaimed sovereignty over the whole island in 1845.

The 1855 Treaty of Shimoda acknowledged that both the Russian Empire and Japan had joint rights of occupation to Sakhalin, without setting a definite territorial demarcation. As the island became settled in the 1860s and 1870s, this ambiguity led to increasing friction between settlers. Attempts by the Tokugawa shogunate to purchase the entire island from the Russian Empire failed, and the new Meiji government was unable to negotiate a partition of the island into separate territories. In the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875), Japan agreed to give up its claims on Sakhalin in exchange for undisputed ownership of the Kuril Islands.

Japan invaded Sakhalin in the final stages of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, but per the 1905 Treaty of Portsmouth was allowed to retain only the southern portion of the island below the 50° N parallel. Russia retained the northern portion, although the Japanese were awarded favorable commercial rights, including fishing and mineral extraction rights in the north. In 1907, Karafuto Prefecture was officially established, with the capital at Ōtomari. In 1908, the capital was relocated to Toyohara.

In 1920, Karafuto was officially designated an external territory of Japan, and its administration and development came under the aegis of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs. Following the Nikolaevsk Incident in 1920, Japan briefly seized the northern half of Sakhalin, and occupied it until the establishment of formal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1925; however, Japan continued to maintain petroleum and coal concessions in northern Sakhalin until 1944. In 1943, the status of Karafuto was upgraded to that of an &quot;inner land&quot;, making it an integral part of the Empire of Japan.

As Japan was extending its influence over East Asia and the Pacific through the establishment of a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Imperial Japanese Army as part of its offensive contingency plans to invade the Soviet Union if it either became involved in the Pacific War or collapsed due to the ongoing German invasion, proposed the annexation of the remaining northern half of Sakhalin to Japan.

===Soviet invasion===
In August 1945, after repudiating the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April, and according to the signed agreements of Yalta, in which Stalin pledged that the Soviet Union would enter the Pacific War three months after the defeat of Germany, the Soviet Union invaded Karafuto. The Soviet attack started on 11 August 1945, three days before the surrender of Japan. The Soviet 56th Rifle Corps, part of the 16th Army, consisting of the 79th Rifle Division, the 2nd Rifle Brigade, the 5th Rifle Brigade and the 214 Armored Brigade, attacked the Japanese 88th Infantry Division. Although the Soviet Red Army outnumbered the Japanese by three to one, they advanced only slowly due to strong Japanese resistance. It was not until the 113th Rifle Brigade and the 365th Independent Naval Infantry Rifle Battalion from Sovetskaya Gavan landed in Tōro, a seashore village in western Karafuto, on 16 August that the Soviets broke the Japanese defense line. Japanese resistance grew weaker after this landing. Actual fighting continued until 21 August. Between 22 and 23 August, most remaining Japanese units agreed to a ceasefire. The Soviets completed the conquest of Karafuto on 25 August 1945, by occupying the capital of Toyohara.

===Post-war===

There were over 400,000 people living in Karafuto when the Soviet offensive began in early August 1945. Most were of Japanese or Korean extraction, though there was also a small White Russian community as well as some Ainu indigenous tribes. By the time of the ceasefire, approximately 100,000 civilians had managed to escape to Hokkaidō. The military government established by the Soviet Army banned the local press, confiscated cars and radio sets and imposed a curfew. Local managers and bureaucrats were made to aid Russian authorities in the process of reconstruction, before being deported to labor camps, either on North Sakhalin or in Siberia. In schools, courses in Marxism–Leninism were introduced, and Japanese children were obliged to sing songs in praise of Stalin.

Step by step Karafuto lost its Japanese identity. Sakhalin Oblast was created in February 1946, and by March all towns, villages and streets were given Russian names. More and more colonists began to arrive from mainland Russia, with whom the Japanese were obliged to share the limited stock of housing. In October 1946 the Soviets began to repatriate all remaining Japanese. By 1950 most had been sent, willing or not, to Hokkaidō. They had to leave all of their possessions behind, including any currency, Russian or Japanese. Today some keep alive the memory of their former home in the meetings of the &quot;Karafuto Renmei&quot;, an association for former Karafuto residents.

In 1945, with the defeat of Japan in World War II, the Japanese administration in Karafuto ceased to function. The Japanese government formally abolished Karafuto Prefecture as a legal entity on 1 June 1949. In 1951, at the Treaty of San Francisco, Japan renounced its rights to Sakhalin, but did not formally acknowledge Soviet sovereignty over it. Since that time, no final peace treaty has been signed between Japan and Russia, and the status of the neighboring Kuril Islands remains disputed.

==Economy==

The pre-war economy of Karafuto was based on fishing, forestry and agriculture, together with extraction of coal and petroleum. In terms of industry, the paper industry and the charcoal production industry was well developed. Pulp for rayon production in Honshu was predominately sourced from Karafuto. The territory suffered from a labor shortage through most of its history, and tax incentives were provided to encourage immigration. Indigenous Nivkh and Oroks worked in Japanese-run fisheries and a synthetic textile plant near the Russian border. For the construction of the Toyohara-Maoka line, bonded labor was put to use, including Chinese contract laborers. By the end of the 1920s, these laborers would be replaced with Koreans. With the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, their population would increase substantially. 

An extensive railway network was constructed in Karafuto to support the extraction of natural resources. The maintained 682.6 kilometers of track in four main lines and an additional 58.2 kilometers of track.

==Government==
Karafuto was administered from the central government in Tokyo as the under the of the Home Ministry. The Colonization Bureau became the 
 in 1923 at which time Karafuto was officially designated an overseas territory of the Empire of Japan.

When the Ministry of Colonial Affairs was absorbed into the new Ministry of Greater East Asia in 1942, the administration of Karafuto was separated, and Karafuto became an integral part of the Japanese archipelago.

== Political divisions ==
As of 1945, Karafuto was divided into four subprefectures, which in turn were subdivided into 11 districts, in turn divided into 41 municipalities (one city, 13 towns, and 27 villages).

Karafuto&#x27;s largest city was Toyohara, while other major cities included Esutoru in the north central and Maoka in the south central region.

<text>East Hills railway station is located on the East Hills line, serving the Sydney suburb of East Hills. It is served by Sydney Trains&#x27; T8 Airport &amp; South Line services.

==History==

East Hills station opened on 21 December 1931 when the line was extended from Kingsgrove. It served as the terminus of the line until it was extended to Glenfield on 21 December 1987.

A new station was built south-east of the original station as part of the extension opening in August 1987 with the original station closed and demolished. Following the extension, East Hills became the main intermediate terminus and an interchange point between all stops and limited stops trains. In addition to the two through tracks (platforms 2 and 3), a side terminating track (platform 1) was provided. A new centre turnback at Revesby opened in 2009 as part of the Rail Clearways Program, which ended East Hills&#x27; role as the primary intermediate terminus.

The station was upgraded and received lifts in April 2022.

WebMD is an American corporation which publishes online news and information about human health and well-being. The WebMD website also includes information about drugs and is an important healthcare information website and the most popular consumer-oriented health site.

WebMD was started in 1998 by internet entrepreneur Jeff Arnold. In early 1999, it was part of a three-way merger with Sapient Health Network (SHN) and Direct Medical Knowledge (DMK). SHN began in Portland, Oregon, in 1996 by Jim Kean, Bill Kelly, and Kris Nybakken, who worked together at a CD-ROM publishing firm, Creative Multimedia. Later, in 1999, WebMD merged with Healtheon, founded by Netscape Communications founder James H. Clark.

== History ==
WebMD is best known as a health information services website, which publishes content regarding health and health care topics, including a symptom checklist, pharmacy information, drugs information, and blogs of physicians with specific topics, and provides a place to store personal medical information. URAC, the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission, has accredited WebMD&#x27;s operations continuously since 2001 regarding everything from proper disclosures and health content to security and privacy.

The company reported $705 million in revenue for the year 2016. In 2017, Internet Brands, a company owned by private-equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) agreed to purchase WebMD Health Corporation for approximately $2.8 billion.

In May 2021, WebMD acquired the print magazine and website for patients with ADHD and parents of children with ADHD, ADDitude. In August 2022, WebMD acquired the leading French medical news site Jim.fr.

== Company ==
WebMD is financed by advertising, third-party contributions, and sponsors. Some of the sponsors have influence over the content on WebMD. In 2013, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported that WebMD, &quot;has struggled with a fall in advertising revenue with pharmaceutical companies slashing marketing budgets as several blockbuster drugs go off patent.&quot; In response, WebMD began investing in changes to its site in order to entice users who use its site seeking specific information to linger on the site reviewing other material.

WebMD offers services to physicians and private clients. They publish &quot;WebMD the Magazine&quot;, a patient-directed publication distributed bimonthly free of charge to 85 percent of physician waiting rooms. Medscape is a professional portal for physicians and has training materials, a drug database, and clinical information on 30 medical specialty areas and more than 30 physician discussion boards. WebMD Health Services provides private health management programs and benefit decision-support portals to employers and health plans.

The WebMD Health Network operates WebMD Health and other health-related sites including: Medscape, MedicineNet, eMedicine, eMedicineHealth, RxList, OnHealth, and theheart.org. These sites provide similar services to those of WebMD. MedicineNet is an online media publishing company. Medscape offers up-to-date information for physicians and other healthcare professionals. RxList offers detailed information about pharmaceutical information on generic and name-brand drugs. eMedicineHealth is a consumer site offering similar information to that of WebMD. It was first based on the site created for physicians, dentists and other healthcare professionals called eMedicine.com.

WebMD China is operated by an unaffiliated online publishing group, and is not part of the WebMD Health Network.

== Criticism ==

Writing in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; in 2011, Virginia Heffernan criticized WebMD for biasing readers toward drugs that are sold by the site&#x27;s pharmaceutical sponsors, even when they are unnecessary. She wrote that WebMD &quot;has become permeated with pseudo-medicine and subtle misinformation.&quot;

Julia Belluz of Vox criticized WebMD in 2016 (&quot;The Truth about WebMD, a Hypochondriac&#x27;s Nightmare and Big Pharma&#x27;s Dream&quot;) for encouraging hypochondria and for promoting treatments for which evidence of safety and effectiveness is weak or non-existent, such as green coffee supplements for weight loss, vagus nerve stimulation for depression, and fish-oil/omega-3 supplements for high cholesterol.

in 2012, Dr. Yoni Freedhoff, MD, Associate Professor of Family Medicine at the University of Ottawa and the medical director of the Bariatric Medical Institute, wrote an article entitled &quot;Why I Can No Longer Trust Medscape&quot;. In it he wrote that Medscape is &quot;putting patients at risk by actively misinforming their physicians.&quot; He also noted poor vetting of studies that Medscape chooses to publish as his reason for stating this.

In 2016, a survey of doctors found WebMD and its sister company Medscape to have incomplete medical information lacking depth and also numerous cases of misinformation on their sites. A study of Medscape and WebMD also found both services to lack neutrality and exhibiting bias potentially based on very high payments (compared to their industry competitors) from the pharmaceutical industry.

<text>Linz am Rhein (in English &quot;Linz on the Rhine&quot;) is a municipality in the district of Neuwied, in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is situated on the right bank of the river Rhine near Remagen, approx. 25 km southeast of Bonn and has about 6,000 inhabitants. It is the sister city of Marietta, Georgia in the United States, Linz in Austria and Pornic in France.

Linz is the seat of the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; (&quot;collective municipality&quot;) Linz am Rhein.

The town is also a destination for tourists thanks to its location next to the Rhine river and its colorful half-timbered houses.

==History==
The town of Linz was first mentioned in an official document in 874 and called &quot;Lincesce&quot;.

Between 1206 and 1214 the parish church of St. Martin was built at the most elevated spot of the town. A former church, which was located at the same place, had been destroyed during the fights of Otto IV and Philip of Swabia in 1198. During reconstruction work in 1981 the remains of graves and foundations belonging to the former church were found.

The most important political decision for Linz was taken in the late Middle Ages. Between 1304 and 1332 Linz was officially awarded city status by the Archbishop of Cologne, Heinrich II of Virneburg. Shortly after having been declared a &quot;city&quot;, the castle Burg Linz was built.

In 1391 a fire destroyed two thirds of the city. In 1475 the Emperor&#x27;s troops occupied Linz during the Neuss War. The town hall, which is one of the major sights of Linz, was built in 1517.

In 1815, Linz became part of Prussia. One year later in 1816 Linz received the status of a district town (&quot;Kreisstadt&quot;). This status was revoked in 1822 and Linz became part of the Neuwied county.

After the Second World War, Linz became a part of Rhineland-Palatinate in 1946.

In the 1970s the city expanded with the new residential area &quot;Roniger Hof&quot;. In 1979 the local hospital was put into service.

<doc id="1040779" wikidata="Q963703" url="?curid=1040779" title="Mary Seacole">
<text>Mary Jane Seacole (; 23 November 1805 – 14 May 1881) was a poo nurse and businesswoman. She was famous for her nursing work during the Crimean War and for publishing the first autobiography written by a black woman in Britain.

Seacole was born in Kingston, Jamaica, to a Creole mother who ran a boarding house and had herbalist skills as a &quot;doctress&quot;. In 1990, Seacole was (posthumously) awarded the Jamaican Order of Merit. In 2004, she was voted the greatest black Briton in a survey conducted in 2003 by the black heritage website Every Generation.

Seacole went to the Crimean War in 1855 with the plan of setting up the &quot;British Hotel&quot;, as &quot;a mess-table and comfortable quarters for sick and convalescent officers&quot;. However, chef Alexis Soyer told her that officers did not need overnight accommodation, so she instead made it into a restaurant/bar/catering service. It proved to be very popular and she and her business partner, a relative of her late husband, did well on it until the end of the war. Her 1857 memoir, &quot;Adventures of Mrs Seacole in Many Lands&quot;, includes three chapters of the food she served and the encounters she had with officers, some of them high-ranking, and including the commander of the Turkish forces.

Mrs Seacole missed the first three major battles of the war, as she was busy in London attending to her gold investments—she had arrived from Panama, where she had provided services for prospectors going overland to and from the California Gold Rush. She gave assistance at the battlefield on three later battles, going out to attend to the fallen after serving wine and sandwiches to spectators.

In her memoir, Mrs Seacole described several attempts she made to join that team; however, she did not start her informal inquiries until after both Florence Nightingale and her initial team, and a later one, had left. When Seacole left, it was with the plan of joining her business partner and starting their business. She travelled with two black employees, her maid Mary, and a porter, Mac.

She was largely forgotten for almost a century after her death. Her autobiography, &quot;Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands&quot; (1857), was the first autobiography written by a black woman in Britain. The erection of a statue of her at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, London, on 30 June 2016, describing her as a &quot;pioneer&quot;, generated some controversy and opposition, especially among those concerned with Nightingale&#x27;s legacy.

==Early career and background==
Mary Jane Seacole was born Mary Jane Grant on 23 November 1805 in Kingston, in the Colony of Jamaica, as a member of the community of free black people in Jamaica. She was the daughter of James Grant, a Scottish Lieutenant in the British Army. Her mother, Mrs Grant, nicknamed &quot;The Doctress&quot;, was a healer who used traditional Caribbean and African herbal medicines. Mrs Grant also ran Blundell Hall, a boarding house at 7, East Street. 

In the 18th century, Jamaican doctresses mastered folk medicine, including the use of hygiene and herbs. They had a vast knowledge of tropical diseases, and had a general practitioner&#x27;s skill in treating ailments and injuries, acquired from having to look after the illnesses of fellow slaves on sugar plantations. At Blundell Hall, Seacole acquired her nursing skills, which included the use of hygiene, ventilation, warmth, hydration, rest, empathy, good nutrition and care for the dying. Blundell Hall also served as a convalescent home for military and naval staff recuperating from illnesses such as cholera and yellow fever. Seacole&#x27;s autobiography says she began experimenting in medicine, based on what she learned from her mother, by ministering to a doll and then progressing to pets before helping her mother treat humans. Because of her family&#x27;s close ties with the army, she was able to observe the practices of military doctors, and combined that knowledge with the West African remedies she acquired from her mother. In Jamaica in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, neonatal deaths were more than a quarter of total births. However, Seacole, using traditional West African herbal remedies and hygienic practices, boasted that she never lost a mother or her child.

Seacole was proud of both her Jamaican and Scottish ancestry and called herself a Creole In her autobiography, &quot;The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole&quot;, she writes: &quot;I am a Creole, and have good Scots blood coursing through my veins. My father was a soldier of an old Scottish family.&quot; Her biographer Jane Robinson speculates that she may technically have been a quadroon. Seacole emphasises her personal vigour in her autobiography, distancing herself from the contemporary stereotype of the &quot;lazy Creole&quot;. She was proud of her black ancestry, writing, &quot;I have a few shades of deeper brown upon my skin which shows me related – and I am proud of the relationship – to those poor mortals whom you once held enslaved, and whose bodies America still owns.&quot;

Mary Seacole spent some years in the household of an elderly woman, whom she called her &quot;kind patroness&quot;, before returning to her mother. She was treated as a member of her patroness&#x27;s family and received a good education. As the educated daughter of a Scottish officer and a free black woman with a respectable business, Seacole would have held a high position in Jamaican society.

In about 1821, Seacole visited London, staying for a year, and visited her relatives in the merchant Henriques family. Although London had a number of black people, she records that a companion, a West Indian with skin darker than her own &quot;dusky&quot; shades, was taunted by children. Seacole herself was &quot;only a little brown&quot;; she was nearly white according to one of her biographers, Dr. Ron Ramdin. She returned to London approximately a year later, bringing a &quot;large stock of West Indian pickles and preserves for sale&quot;. Her later travels would be without a chaperone or sponsor – an unusually independent practice at a time when women had limited rights.

== In the Caribbean, 1826–51 ==
After returning to Jamaica, Seacole cared for her &quot;old indulgent patroness&quot; through an illness, finally returning to the family home at Blundell Hall after the death of her patroness a few years later. Seacole then worked alongside her mother, occasionally being called to provide nursing assistance at the British Army hospital at Up-Park Camp. She also travelled the Caribbean, visiting the British colony of New Providence in the Bahamas, the Spanish colony of Cuba, and the new Republic of Haiti. Seacole records these travels, but omits mention of significant current events, such as the Christmas Rebellion in Jamaica of 1831, the abolition of slavery in 1833, and the abolition of &quot;apprenticeship&quot; in 1838.

She married Edwin Horatio Hamilton Seacole in Kingston on 10 November 1836. Her marriage, from betrothal to widowhood, is described in just nine lines at the conclusion of the first chapter of her autobiography. Robinson reports the legend in the Seacole family that Edwin was an illegitimate son of Lord Nelson and his mistress, Emma Hamilton, who was adopted by Thomas, a local &quot;surgeon, apothecary and man midwife&quot; (Seacole&#x27;s will indicates that Horatio Seacole was Nelson&#x27;s godson: she left a diamond ring to her friend, Lord Rokeby, &quot;given to my late husband by his godfather Viscount Nelson&quot;, but there was no mention of this godson in Nelson&#x27;s own will or its codicils.) Edwin was a merchant and seems to have had a poor constitution. The newly married couple moved to Black River and opened a provisions store which failed to prosper. They returned to Blundell Hall in the early 1840s.

During 1843 and 1844, Seacole suffered a series of personal disasters. She and her family lost much of the boarding house in a fire in Kingston on 29 August 1843. Blundell Hall burned down, and was replaced by New Blundell Hall, which was described as &quot;better than before&quot;. Then her husband died in October 1844, followed by her mother. After a period of grief, in which Seacole says she did not stir for days, she composed herself, &quot;turned a bold front to fortune&quot;, and assumed the management of her mother&#x27;s hotel. She put her rapid recovery down to her hot Creole blood, blunting the &quot;sharp edge of [her] grief&quot; sooner than Europeans who she thought &quot;nurse their woe secretly in their hearts&quot;.

Seacole absorbed herself in work, declining many offers of marriage. She later became known to the European military visitors to Jamaica who often stayed at Blundell Hall. She treated and nursed patients in the cholera epidemic of 1850, which killed some 32,000 Jamaicans.

== In Central America, 1851–54 ==
In 1850, Seacole&#x27;s half-brother Edward moved to Cruces, Panama, which was then part of the Republic of New Granada. There, approximately up the Chagres River from the coast, he followed the family trade by establishing the Independent Hotel to accommodate the many travellers between the eastern and western coasts of the United States (the number of travellers had increased enormously, as part of the 1849 California Gold Rush). Cruces was the limit of navigability of the Chagres River during the rainy season, which lasts from June to December. Travellers would ride on donkeys approximately along the Las Cruces trail from Panama City on the Pacific Ocean coast to Cruces, and then down-river to the Atlantic Ocean at Chagres (or vice versa). In the dry season, the river subsided, and travellers would switch from land to the river a few miles farther downstream, at Gorgona. Most of these settlements have now been submerged by Gatun Lake, formed as part of the Panama Canal.

In 1851, Seacole travelled to Cruces to visit her brother. Shortly after her arrival, the town was struck by cholera, a disease which had reached Panama in 1849. Seacole was on hand to treat the first victim, who survived, which established Seacole&#x27;s reputation and brought her a succession of patients as the infection spread. The rich paid, but she treated the poor for free. Many, both rich and poor, succumbed. She eschewed opium, preferring mustard rubs and poultices, the laxative calomel (mercurous chloride), sugars of lead (lead(II) acetate), and rehydration with water boiled with cinnamon. While she believed her preparations had moderate success, she faced little competition, the only other treatments coming from a &quot;timid little dentist&quot;, who was an inexperienced doctor sent by the Panamanian government, and the Catholic Church.

The epidemic raged through the population. Seacole later expressed exasperation at their feeble resistance, claiming they &quot;bowed down before the plague in slavish despair&quot;. She performed an autopsy on an orphan child for whom she had cared, which gave her &quot;decidedly useful&quot; new knowledge. At the end of this epidemic she herself contracted cholera, forcing her to rest for several weeks. In her autobiography, &quot;The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands&quot;, she describes how the residents of Cruces responded: &quot;When it became known that their &quot;yellow doctress&quot; had the cholera, I must do the people of Cruces the justice to say that they gave me plenty of sympathy, and would have shown their regard for me more actively, had there been any occasion.&quot;

Cholera was to return again: Ulysses S. Grant passed through Cruces in July 1852, on military duty; a hundred and twenty men, a third of his party, died of the disease there or shortly afterwards en route to Panama City.

Despite the problems of disease and climate, Panama remained the favoured route between the coasts of the United States. Seeing a business opportunity, Seacole opened the British Hotel, which was a restaurant rather than a hotel. She described it as a &quot;tumble down hut,&quot; with two rooms, the smaller one to be her bedroom, the larger one to serve up to 50 diners. She soon added the services of a barber.

As the wet season ended in early 1852, Seacole joined other traders in Cruces in packing up to move to Gorgona. She records a white American giving a speech at a leaving dinner in which he wished that &quot;God bless the best yaller woman he ever made&quot; and asked the listeners to join with him in rejoicing that &quot;she&#x27;s so many shades removed from being entirely black&quot;. He went on to say that &quot;if we could bleach her by any means we would [...] and thus make her acceptable in any company[,] as she deserves to be&quot;. Seacole replied firmly that she did not &quot;appreciate your friend&#x27;s kind wishes with respect to my complexion. If it had been as dark as any nigger&#x27;s, I should have been just as happy and just as useful, and as much respected by those whose respect I value.&quot; She declined the offer of &quot;bleaching&quot; and drank &quot;to you and the general reformation of American manners&quot;. Salih notes Seacole&#x27;s use here of eye dialect, set against her own English, as an implicit inversion of the day&#x27;s caricatures of &quot;black talk&quot;. Seacole also comments on the positions of responsibility taken on by escaped African-American slaves in Panama, as well as in the priesthood, the army, and public offices, commenting that &quot;it is wonderful to see how freedom and equality elevate men&quot;. She also records an antipathy between Panamanians and Americans, which she attributes in part to the fact that so many of the former had once been slaves of the latter.

In Gorgona, Seacole briefly ran a females-only hotel. In late 1852, she travelled home to Jamaica. Already delayed, the journey was further made difficult when she encountered racial discrimination while trying to book passage on an American ship. She was forced to wait for a later British boat. In 1853, soon after arriving home, Seacole was asked by the Jamaican medical authorities to provide nursing care to victims of a severe outbreak of yellow fever. She found that she could do little, because the epidemic was so severe. Her memoirs state that her own boarding house was full of sufferers and she saw many of them die. Although she wrote, &quot;I was sent for by the medical authorities to provide nurses for the sick at Up-Park Camp,&quot; she did not claim to bring nurses with her when she went. She left her sister with some friends at her house, went to the camp (about a mile, or 1.6 km, from Kingston), &quot;and did my best, but it was little we could do to mitigate the severity of the epidemic.&quot; However, in Cuba Seacole is remembered with great fondness by those she nursed back to health, where she became known as &quot;the Yellow Woman from Jamaica with the cholera medicine&quot;.

Seacole returned to Panama in early 1854 to finalise her business affairs, and three months later moved to the New Granada Mining Gold Company establishment at Fort Bowen Mine some away near Escribanos. The superintendent, Thomas Day, was related to her late husband. Seacole had read newspaper reports of the outbreak of war against Russia before she left Jamaica, and news of the escalating Crimean War reached her in Panama. She determined to travel to England to volunteer as a nurse with experience in herbal healing skills, to experience the &quot;pomp, pride and circumstance of glorious war&quot; as she described it in Chapter I of her autobiography. A part of her reasoning for going to Crimea was that she knew some of the soldiers that were deployed there. In her autobiography she explains how she heard that soldiers whom she had cared for and nursed back to health in the 97th and 48th regiments were being shipped back to England in preparation for the fighting on the Crimean Peninsula.

== Crimean War, 1853–56 ==
The Crimean War lasted from October 1853 until 1 April 1856 and was fought between the Russian Empire and an alliance of the United Kingdom, France, the Kingdom of Sardinia, and the Ottoman Empire. The majority of the conflict took place on the Crimean peninsula in the Black Sea and Turkey.

Many thousands of troops from all the countries involved were drafted to the area, and disease broke out almost immediately. Hundreds perished, mostly from cholera. Hundreds more would die waiting to be shipped out, or on the voyage. Their prospects were little better when they arrived at the poorly staffed, unsanitary and overcrowded hospitals which were the only medical provision for the wounded. In Britain, a trenchant letter in &quot;The Times&quot; on 14 October triggered Sidney Herbert, Secretary of State for War, to approach Florence Nightingale to form a detachment of nurses to be sent to the hospital to save lives. Interviews were quickly held, suitable candidates selected, and Nightingale left for Turkey on 21 October.

Seacole travelled from Navy Bay in Panama to England, initially to deal with her investments in gold-mining businesses. She then attempted to join the second contingent of nurses to the Crimea. She applied to the War Office and other government offices, but arrangements for departure were already underway. In her memoir, she wrote that she brought &quot;ample testimony&quot; of her experience in nursing, but the only example officially cited was that of a former medical officer of the West Granada Gold-Mining Company. However, Seacole wrote that this was just one of the testimonials she had in her possession. Seacole wrote in her autobiography, &quot;Now, I am not for a single instant going to blame the authorities who would not listen to the offer of a motherly yellow woman to go to the Crimea and nurse her ‘sons’ there, suffering from cholera, diarrhœa, and a host of lesser ills. In my country, where people know our use, it would have been different; but here it was natural enough – although I had references, and other voices spoke for me – that they should laugh, good-naturedly enough, at my offer.&quot;

Seacole also applied to the Crimean Fund, a fund raised by public subscription to support the wounded in Crimea, for sponsorship to travel there, but she again met with refusal. Seacole questioned whether racism was a factor in her being turned down. She wrote in her autobiography, &quot;Was it possible that American prejudices against colour had some root here? Did these ladies shrink from accepting my aid because my blood flowed beneath a somewhat duskier skin than theirs?&quot; An attempt to join the contingent of nurses was also rebuffed, as she wrote, &quot;Once again I tried, and had an interview this time with one of Miss Nightingale&#x27;s companions. She gave me the same reply, and I read in her face the fact, that had there been a vacancy, I should not have been chosen to fill it.&quot; Seacole did not stop after being rebuffed by the Secretary-at-War, she soon approached his wife, Elizabeth Herbert, who also informed her &quot;that the full complement of nurses had been secured&quot; (Seacole 78, 79).

Seacole finally resolved to travel to Crimea using her own resources and to open the British Hotel. Business cards were printed and sent ahead to announce her intention to open an establishment, to be called the &quot;British Hotel&quot;, near Balaclava, which would be &quot;a mess-table and comfortable quarters for sick and convalescent officers&quot;. Shortly afterwards, her Caribbean acquaintance, Thomas Day, arrived unexpectedly in London, and the two formed a partnership. They assembled a stock of supplies, and Seacole embarked on the Dutch screw-steamer &quot;Hollander&quot; on 27 January 1855 on its maiden voyage, to Constantinople. The ship called at Malta, where Seacole encountered a doctor who had recently left Scutari. He wrote her a letter of introduction to Nightingale.

Seacole visited Nightingale at the Barrack Hospital in Scutari, where she asked for a bed for the night. Seacole wrote of Selina Bracebridge, an assistant of Nightingale, &quot;Mrs. B. questions me very kindly, but with the same look of curiosity and surprise. What object has Mrs. Seacole in coming out? This is the purport of her questions. And I say, frankly, to be of use somewhere; for other considerations I had not, until necessity forced them upon me. Willingly, had they accepted me, I would have worked for the wounded, in return for bread and water. I fancy Mrs. B— thought that I sought for employment at Scutari, for she said, very kindly – &quot;Miss Nightingale has the entire management of our hospital staff, but I do not think that any vacancy – &quot; Seacole informed Bracebridge that she intended to travel to Balaclava the next day to join her business partner. She reports that her meeting with Nightingale was friendly, with Nightingale asking &quot;What do you want, Mrs. Seacole? Anything we can do for you? If it lies in my power, I shall be very happy.&quot; Seacole told her of her &quot;dread of the night journey by caïque&quot; and the improbability of being able to find the &quot;Hollander&quot; in the dark. A bed was then found for her and breakfast sent her in the morning, with a &quot;kind message&quot; from Bracebridge. A footnote in the memoir states that Seacole subsequently &quot;saw much of Miss Nightingale at Balaclava,&quot; but no further meetings are recorded in the text.

After transferring most of her stores to the transport ship &quot;Albatross&quot;, with the remainder following on the &quot;Nonpareil&quot;, she set out on the four-day voyage to the British bridgehead into Crimea at Balaclava. Lacking proper building materials, Seacole gathered abandoned metal and wood in her spare moments, with a view to using the debris to build her hotel. She found a site for the hotel at a place she christened Spring Hill, near Kadikoi, some along the main British supply road from Balaclava to the British camp near Sevastopol, and within a mile of the British headquarters.

The hotel was built from the salvaged driftwood, packing cases, iron sheets, and salvaged architectural items such as glass doors and window-frames, from the village of Kamara, using hired local labour. The new British Hotel opened in March 1855. An early visitor was Alexis Soyer, a noted French chef who had travelled to Crimea to help improve the diet of British soldiers. He records meeting Seacole in his 1857 work &quot;A Culinary Campaign&quot; and describes Seacole as &quot;an old dame of a jovial appearance, but a few shades darker than the white lily&quot;. Seacole requested Soyer&#x27;s advice on how to manage her business, and was advised to concentrate on food and beverage service, and not to have beds for visitors because the few either slept on board ships in the harbour or in tents in the camp.

The hotel was completed in July at a total cost of £800. It included a building made of iron, containing a main room with counters and shelves and storage above, an attached kitchen, two wooden sleeping huts, outhouses, and an enclosed stable-yard. The building was stocked with provisions shipped from London and Constantinople, as well as local purchases from the British camp near Kadikoi and the French camp at nearby Kamiesch. Seacole sold anything – &quot;from a needle to an anchor&quot;—to army officers and visiting sightseers. Meals were served at the hotel, cooked by two black cooks, and the kitchen also provided outside catering.

Despite constant thefts, particularly of livestock, Seacole&#x27;s establishment prospered. Chapter XIV of &quot;Wonderful Adventures&quot; describes the meals and supplies provided to officers. They were closed at 8 pm daily and on Sundays. Seacole did some of the cooking herself: &quot;Whenever I had a few leisure moments, I used to wash my hands, roll up my sleeves, and roll out pastry.&quot; When called to &quot;dispense medications,&quot; she did so. Soyer was a frequent visitor, and praised Seacole&#x27;s offerings, noting that she offered him champagne on his first visit.

To Soyer, near the time of departure, Florence Nightingale acknowledged favourable views of Seacole, consistent with their one known meeting in Scutari. Soyer&#x27;s remarks—he knew both women—show pleasantness on both sides. Seacole told him of her encounter with Nightingale at the Barrack Hospital: &quot;You must know, M Soyer, that Miss Nightingale is very fond of me. When I passed through Scutari, she very kindly gave me board and lodging.&quot; When he related Seacole&#x27;s inquiries to Nightingale, she replied &quot;with a smile: &#x27;I should like to see her before she leaves, as I hear she has done a deal of good for the poor soldiers.&#x27;&quot; Nightingale, however, did not want her nurses associating with Seacole, as she wrote to her brother-in-law. In this letter, Nightingale reportedly wrote, &quot;I had the greatest difficulty in repelling Mrs Seacole&#x27;s advances, and in preventing association between her and my nurses (absolutely out of the question!)...Anyone who employs Mrs Seacole will introduce much kindness - also much drunkenness and improper conduct&quot;.
Seacole often went out to the troops as a sutler, selling her provisions near the British camp at Kadikoi, and nursing casualties brought out from the trenches around Sevastopol or from the Tchernaya valley. She was widely known to the British Army as &quot;Mother Seacole&quot;.

Apart from serving officers at the British Hotel, Seacole also provided catering for spectators at the battles, and spent time on Cathcart&#x27;s Hill, some north of the British Hotel, as an observer. On one occasion, attending wounded troops under fire, she dislocated her right thumb, an injury which never healed entirely. In a dispatch written on 14 September 1855, William Howard Russell, special correspondent of &quot;The Times&quot;, wrote that she was a &quot;warm and successful physician, who doctors and cures all manner of men with extraordinary success. She is always in attendance near the battlefield to aid the wounded and has earned many a poor fellow&#x27;s blessing.&quot; Russell also wrote that she &quot;redeemed the name of sutler&quot;, and another that she was &quot;both a Miss Nightingale and a [chef]&quot;. Seacole made a point of wearing brightly coloured, and highly conspicuous, clothing—often bright blue, or yellow, with ribbons in contrasting colours. While Lady Alicia Blackwood later recalled that Seacole had &quot;... personally spared no pains and no exertion to visit the field of woe, and minister with her own hands such things as could comfort or alleviate the suffering of those around her; freely giving to such as could not pay ...&quot;.

Her peers, though wary at first, soon found out how important Seacole was for both medical assistance and morale. One British medical officer described Seacole in his memoir as &quot;The acquaintance of a celebrated person, Mrs. Seacole, a coloured women who out of the goodness of her heart and at her own expense, supplied hot tea to the poor sufferers [wounded men being transported from the peninsula to the hospital at Scutari ] while they are waiting to be lifted into the boats…. She did not spare herself if she could do any good to the suffering soldiers. In rain and snow, in storm and tempest, day after day she was at her self-chosen post with her stove and kettle, in any shelter she could find, brewing tea for all who wanted it, and they were many. Sometimes more than 200 sick would be embarked in one day, but Mrs. Seacole was always equal, to the occasion&quot;. But Seacole did more than carry tea to the suffering soldiers. She often carried bags of lint, bandages, needles and thread to tend to the wounds of soldiers.

In late August, Seacole was on the route to Cathcart&#x27;s Hill for the final assault on Sevastopol on 7 September 1855. French troops led the storming, but the British were beaten back. By dawn on Sunday 9 September, the city was burning out of control, and it was clear that it had fallen: the Russians retreated to fortifications to the north of the harbour. Later in the day, Seacole fulfilled a bet, and became the first British woman to enter Sevastopol after it fell. Having obtained a pass, she toured the broken town, bearing refreshments and visiting the crowded hospital by the docks, containing thousands of dead and dying Russians. Her foreign appearance led to her being stopped by French looters, but she was rescued by a passing officer. She looted some items from the city, including a church bell, an altar candle, and a three-metre (10 ft) long painting of the Madonna.

After the fall of Sevastopol, hostilities continued in a desultory fashion. The business of Seacole and Day prospered in the interim period, with the officers taking the opportunity to enjoy themselves in the quieter days. There were theatrical performances and horse-racing events for which Seacole provided catering.

Seacole was joined by a 14-year-old girl, Sarah, also known as Sally. Soyer described her as &quot;the Egyptian beauty, Mrs Seacole&#x27;s daughter Sarah&quot;, with blue eyes and dark hair. Nightingale alleged that Sarah was the illegitimate offspring of Seacole and Colonel Henry Bunbury. However, there is no evidence that Bunbury met Seacole, or even visited Jamaica, at a time when she would have been nursing her ailing husband. Ramdin speculates that Thomas Day could have been Sarah&#x27;s father, pointing to the unlikely coincidences of their meeting in Panama and then in England, and their unusual business partnership in Crimea.

Peace talks began in Paris in early 1856, and friendly relations opened between the Allies and the Russians, with a lively trade across the River Tchernaya. The Treaty of Paris was signed on 30 March 1856, after which the soldiers left Crimea. Seacole was in a difficult financial position, her business was full of unsaleable provisions, new goods were arriving daily, and creditors were demanding payment. She attempted to sell as much as possible before the soldiers left, but she was forced to auction many expensive goods for lower-than-expected prices to the Russians who were returning to their homes. The evacuation of the Allied armies was formally completed at Balaclava on 9 July 1856, with Seacole &quot;... conspicuous in the foreground ... dressed in a plaid riding-habit ...&quot;. Seacole was one of the last to leave Crimea, returning to England &quot;poorer than [she] left it&quot;. Though she had left poorer, her impact on the soldiers was invaluable to the soldiers she treated, changing their perceptions about her as described in &quot;the Illustrated London News:&quot; &quot;Perhaps at first the authorities looked askant at the woman-volunteer; but they soon found her worth and utility; and from that time until the British army left the Crimea, Mother Seacole was a household word in the camp...In her store on Spring Hill she attended many patients, cared for many sick, and earned the good will and gratitude of hundreds&quot;.

Sociology professor Lynn McDonald is co-founder of The Nightingale Society, which promotes the legacy of Nightingale, who did not see eye-to-eye with Seacole. McDonald believes that Seacole&#x27;s role in the Crimean War was overplayed:

However, historians maintain that claims dismissing Seacole&#x27;s work as mainly &quot;tea and lemonade&quot; do a disservice to the tradition of Jamaican &quot;doctresses&quot;, such as Seacole&#x27;s mother, Cubah Cornwallis, Sarah Adams and Grace Donne, who all used herbal remedies and hygienic practices in the late eighteenth century, long before Nightingale took up the mantle. Social historian Jane Robinson argues in her book &quot;Mary Seacole: The Black Woman who invented Modern Nursing&quot; that Seacole was a huge success, and she became known and loved by everyone from the rank and file to the royal family. Mark Bostridge pointed out that Seacole&#x27;s experience far outstripped Nightingale&#x27;s, and that the Jamaican&#x27;s work comprised preparing medicines, diagnosis, and minor surgery. &quot;The Times&quot; war correspondent William Howard Russell spoke highly of Seacole&#x27;s skill as a healer, writing &quot;A more tender or skilful hand about a wound or a broken limb could not be found among our best surgeons.&quot;

== Back in London, 1856–60 ==

After the end of the war, Seacole returned to England destitute and in poor health. In the conclusion to her autobiography, she records that she &quot;took the opportunity&quot; to visit &quot;yet other lands&quot; on her return journey, although Robinson attributes this to her impecunious state requiring a roundabout trip. She arrived in August 1856 and opened a canteen with Day at Aldershot, but the venture failed through lack of funds. She attended a celebratory dinner for 2,000 soldiers at Royal Surrey Gardens in Kennington on 25 August 1856, at which Nightingale was chief guest of honour. Reports in &quot;The Times&quot; on 26 August and &quot;News of the World&quot; on 31 August indicate that Seacole was also fêted by the huge crowds, with two &quot;burly&quot; sergeants protecting her from the pressure of the crowd. However, creditors who had supplied her firm in Crimea were in pursuit. She was forced to move to 1, Tavistock Street, Covent Garden in increasingly dire financial straits. The Bankruptcy Court in Basinghall Street declared her bankrupt on 7 November 1856. Robinson speculates that Seacole&#x27;s business problems may have been caused in part by her partner, Day, who dabbled in horse trading and may have set up as an unofficial bank, cashing debts. 

At about this time, Seacole began to wear military medals. These are mentioned in an account of her appearance in the bankruptcy court in November 1856. A bust by George Kelly, based on an original by Count Gleichen from around 1871, depicts her wearing four medals, three of which have been identified as the British Crimea Medal, the French Légion d&#x27;honneur and the Turkish Order of the Medjidie medal. Robinson says that one is &quot;apparently&quot; a Sardinian award (Sardinia having joined Britain and France in supporting Turkey against Russia in the war). The Jamaican &quot;Daily Gleaner&quot; stated in her obituary on 9 June 1881 that she had also received a Russian medal, but it has not been identified. However, no formal notice of her award exists in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;, and it seems unlikely that Seacole was formally rewarded for her actions in Crimea; rather, she may have bought miniature or &quot;dress&quot; medals to display her support and affection for her &quot;sons&quot; in the Army.

Seacole&#x27;s plight was highlighted in the British press. As a consequence a fund was set up, to which many prominent people donated money, and on 30 January 1857, she and Day were granted certificates discharging them from bankruptcy. Day left for the Antipodes to seek new opportunities, but Seacole&#x27;s funds remained low. She moved from Tavistock Street to cheaper lodgings at 14 Soho Square in early 1857, triggering a plea for subscriptions from &quot;Punch&quot; on 2 May. However, in &quot;Punch&quot;″s 30 May edition, she was heavily criticised for a letter she sent begging her favorite magazine, which she claimed to have often read to her British Crimean War patients, to assist her in gaining donations. After quoting her letter in full the magazine provides a satiric cartoon of the activity she describes, captioned &quot;Our Own Vivandière,&quot; describing Seacole as a female sutler. The article observes: &quot;It will be evident, from the foregoing, that Mother Seacole has sunk much lower in the world, and is also in danger of rising much higher in it, than is consistent with the honour of the British army, and the generosity of the British public.&quot; While urging the public to donate, the commentary&#x27;s tone can be read as ironic: &quot;Who would give a guinea to see a mimic-sutler woman, and a foreigner, frisk and amble about on the stage, when he might bestow the money on a genuine English one, reduced to a two-pair back, and in imminent danger of being obliged to climb into an attic?&quot;

In researching his biography of Florence Nightingale, the first major biography in fifty years, Mark Bostridge uncovered a letter in the archive at the home of Nightingale&#x27;s sister Parthenope Verney, which showed that Nightingale had made a contribution to Seacole&#x27;s fund, indicating that she saw value at that time in Seacole&#x27;s work in the Crimea.
Further fund-raising and literary mentions kept Seacole in the public eye. In May 1857 she wanted to travel to India, to minister to the wounded of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, but she was dissuaded by both the new Secretary of War, Lord Panmure, and her financial troubles. Fund-raising activities included the &quot;Seacole Fund Grand Military Festival&quot;, which was held at the Royal Surrey Gardens, from Monday 27 July to Thursday 30 July 1857. This successful event was supported by many military men, including Major General Lord Rokeby (who had commanded the 1st Division in Crimea) and Lord George Paget; more than 1,000 artists performed, including 11 military bands and an orchestra conducted by Louis Antoine Jullien, which was attended by a crowd of circa 40,000. The one-shilling entrance charge was quintupled for the first night, and halved for the Tuesday performance. However, production costs had been high and the Royal Surrey Gardens Company was itself having financial problems. It became insolvent immediately after the festival, and as a result Seacole only received £57, one quarter of the profits from the event. When eventually the financial affairs of the ruined Company were resolved, in March 1858, the Indian Mutiny was over. Writing of his 1859 journey to the West Indies, the British novelist Anthony Trollope described visiting Mrs. Seacole&#x27;s sister&#x27;s hotel in Kingston in his &quot;The West Indies and the Spanish Main&quot; (Chapman &amp; Hall, 1850). Besides remarking on the pride of the servants and their firm insistence that they be treated politely by guests, Trollope remarked that his hostess, &quot;though clean and reasonable in her charges, clung with touching tenderness to the idea that beefsteak and onions, and bread and cheese and beer, comprised the only diet proper to an Englishman.&quot;

== &quot;Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands&quot; ==
A 200-page autobiographical account of her travels was published in July 1857 by James Blackwood as &quot;Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands&quot;, the first autobiography written by a black woman in Britain. Priced at one shilling and six pence (1/) a copy, the cover bears a portrait of Seacole in red, yellow and black ink. Robinson speculates that she dictated the work to an editor, identified in the book only as W.J.S., who improved her grammar and orthography. In the work Seacole deals with the first 39 years of her life in one short chapter. She then expends six chapters on her few years in Panama, before using the following 12 chapters to detail her exploits in Crimea. She avoids mention of the names of her parents and precise date of birth.

In the first chapter, Seacole talks about how her practice of medicine began on animals, such as cats and dogs. Most of the animals caught diseases from their owners, and she would cure them with homemade remedies. Within the book, Seacole discusses how when she returned from the Crimean War she was poor, whereas others in her same position returned to England rich. Seacole shares the respect she gained from the men in the Crimean War. The soldiers would refer to her as &quot;mother&quot; and would ensure her safety by personally guarding her on the battlefield. A short final &quot;Conclusion&quot; deals with her return to England, and lists supporters of her fund-raising effort, including Rokeby, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar, the Duke of Wellington, the Duke of Newcastle, William Russell, and other prominent men in the military. Also within the Conclusion, she describes all of her career adventures experienced in the Crimean War as pride and pleasure. The book was dedicated to Major-General Lord Rokeby, commander of the First Division. In a brief preface, the &quot;Times&quot; correspondent William Howard Russell wrote, &quot;I have witnessed her devotion and her courage ... and I trust that England will never forget one who has nursed her sick, who sought out her wounded to aid and succour them and who performed the last offices for some of her illustrious dead.&quot;

The &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; received the autobiography favourably, agreeing with the statements made in the preface: &quot;If singleness of heart, true charity and Christian works – of trials and sufferings, dangers and perils, encountered boldly by a helpless women on her errand of mercy in the camp and in the battlefield can excite sympathy or move curiosity, Mary Seacole will have many friends and many readers.&quot;

In 2017 Robert McCrum chose it as one of the 100 best nonfiction books, calling it &quot;gloriously entertaining&quot;.

== Later life, 1860–81 ==

Seacole joined the Catholic Church circa 1860, and returned to a Jamaica changed in her absence as it faced economic downturn. She became a prominent figure in the country. However, by 1867 she was again running short of money, and the Seacole fund was resurrected in London, with new patrons including the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Duke of Cambridge, and many other senior military officers. The fund burgeoned, and Seacole was able to buy land on Duke Street in Kingston, near New Blundell Hall, where she built a bungalow as her new home, plus a larger property to rent out.

By 1870, Seacole was back in London, living at 40 Upper Berkley Street, St. Marylebone. Robinson speculates that she was drawn back by the prospect of rendering medical assistance in the Franco-Prussian War. It seems likely that she approached Sir Harry Verney (the husband of Florence Nightingale&#x27;s sister Parthenope) Member of Parliament for Buckingham who was closely involved in the British National Society for the Relief of the Sick and Wounded. It was at this time Nightingale wrote her letter to Verney insinuating that Seacole had kept a &quot;bad house&quot; in Crimea, and was responsible for &quot;much drunkenness and improper conduct&quot;.

In London, Seacole joined the periphery of the royal circle. Prince Victor (a nephew of Queen Victoria; as a young Lieutenant he had been one of Seacole&#x27;s customers in Crimea) carved a marble bust of her in 1871 that was exhibited at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1872. Seacole also became personal masseuse to the Princess of Wales who suffered with white leg and rheumatism.

In the census of 3 April 1881, Seacole is listed as a boarder at 3 Cambridge Street, Paddington. Seacole died on 14 May 1881 at her home, 3 Cambridge Street (later renamed Kendal Street) in Paddington, London; the cause of death was noted as &quot;apoplexy&quot;. She left an estate valued at more than £2,500. After some specific legacies, many of exactly 19 guineas, the main beneficiary of her will was her sister, (Eliza) Louisa. Lord Rokeby, Colonel Hussey Fane Keane, and Count Gleichen (three trustees of her Fund) were each left £50; Count Gleichen also received a diamond ring, said to have been given to Seacole&#x27;s late husband by Lord Nelson. A short obituary was published in &quot;The Times&quot; on 21 May 1881. She was buried in St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Cemetery, Harrow Road, Kensal Green, London.

== Recognition ==
While well known at the end of her life, Seacole rapidly faded from public memory in Britain. She has been better remembered in Jamaica, where significant buildings were named after her in the 1950s: the headquarters of the Jamaican General Trained Nurses&#x27; Association was christened &quot;Mary Seacole House&quot; in 1954, followed quickly by the naming of a hall of residence of the University of the West Indies in Mona, Jamaica, and a ward at Kingston Public Hospital was also named in her memory. More than a century after her death, Seacole was posthumously awarded the Jamaican Order of Merit in 1990.

Her grave in London was rediscovered in 1973; a service of reconsecration was held on 20 November 1973, and her gravestone was also restored by the British Commonwealth Nurses&#x27; War Memorial Fund and the Lignum Vitae Club. Nonetheless, when scholarly and popular works were written in the 1970s about the Black British presence in Britain, she was absent from the historical record, and went unrecorded by Dominican-born scholar Edward Scobie and Nigerian historian Sebastian Okechukwu Mezu.

The centenary of her death was celebrated with a memorial service on 14 May 1981 and the grave is maintained by the Mary Seacole Memorial Association, an organization founded in 1980 by Jamaican-British Auxiliary Territorial Service corporal, Connie Mark. A blue plaque was erected by the Greater London Council at her residence in 157 George Street, Westminster, on 9 March 1985, but it was removed in 1998 before the site was redeveloped. A &quot;green plaque&quot; was unveiled at the site of 157 George Street - &quot;147&quot; George Street - on 11 October 2005. The original GLC blue plaque was salvaged and repositioned at 14 Soho Square, where she lived in 1857, by English Heritage in 2007.

By the 21st century, Seacole was much more prominent. Several buildings and entities, mainly connected with health care, were named after her. She was, for example, the namesake of Seacole Way in Shrewsbury, part of the Copthorne Grange housing estate developed in 2011–12 on site of the former Copthorne Hospital, near the present Royal Shrewsbury Hospital. In 2005, British politician Boris Johnson wrote of learning about Seacole from his daughter&#x27;s school pageant and speculated: &quot;I find myself facing the grim possibility that it was my own education that was blinkered, and that my children are now receiving a more faithful account of heroism in imperial Britain than I did.&quot; In 2007 Seacole was introduced into the National Curriculum, and her life story is taught at many primary schools in the UK alongside that of Florence Nightingale.

She was voted into first place in an online poll of 100 Great Black Britons in 2004 carried out by the website Every Generation. The portrait identified as Seacole in 2005 was used for one of ten first-class stamps showing important Britons, to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the National Portrait Gallery.

British buildings and organisations now commemorate her by name. One of the first was the Mary Seacole Centre for Nursing Practice at Thames Valley University, which created the NHS Specialist Library for Ethnicity and Health, a web-based collection of research-based evidence and good practice information relating to the health needs of minority ethnic groups, and other resources relevant to multi-cultural health care. There is another Mary Seacole Research Centre, this one at De Montfort University in Leicester, and a problem-based learning room at St George&#x27;s, University of London is named after her. Brunel University in West London houses its School of Health Sciences and Social Care in the Mary Seacole Building. New buildings at the University of Salford and Birmingham City University bear her name, as does part of the new headquarters of the Home Office at 2 Marsham Street. There is a Mary Seacole ward in the Douglas Bader Centre in Roehampton. There are two wards named after Mary Seacole in Whittington Hospital in North London, and also, there is the Mary Seacole Nursing Home, situated at 39 Nuttall Street, Shoreditch. The Royal South Hants Hospital in Southampton named its outpatients&#x27; wing &quot;The Mary Seacole Wing&quot; in 2010, in honour of her contribution to nursing. The NHS Seacole Centre in Surrey was opened on 4 May 2020, following a campaign led by Patrick Vernon, a former NHS manager. It is a community hospital which will first provide a temporary rehabilitation service for patients recovering from COVID-19. The building was previously called Headley Court.

An annual prize to recognise and develop leadership in nurses, midwives and health visitors in the National Health Service was named Seacole, to &quot;acknowledge her achievements&quot;. The NHS Leadership Academy has developed a six-month leadership course called the Mary Seacole Programme, which is designed for first time leaders in healthcare. An exhibition to celebrate the bicentenary of her birth opened at the Florence Nightingale Museum in London in March 2005. Originally scheduled to last for a few months, the exhibition was so popular that it was extended to March 2007.
A campaign to erect a statue of Seacole in London was launched on 24 November 2003, chaired by Clive Soley, Baron Soley. The design of the sculpture by Martin Jennings was announced on 18 June 2009. There was significant opposition to the siting of the statue at the entrance of St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, but it was unveiled on 30 June 2016. The words written by Russell in &quot;The Times&quot; in 1857 are etched on to Seacole&#x27;s statue: &quot;I trust that England will not forget one who nursed her sick, who sought out her wounded to aid and succour them, and who performed the last offices for some of her illustrious dead.&quot; The making of the Jennings statue was recorded in the ITV documentary &quot;David Harewood: In the Shadow of Mary Seacole&quot; (2016) along with her life story.

A biopic of her life was proposed in 2019 by Racing Green Pictures and producer Billy Peterson, with Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Mary Seacole. It was intended to release the film in 2020. A short animation about Mary Seacole was adapted from a book entitled &quot;Mother Seacole&quot;, published in 2005 as part of the bicentenary celebrations. Seacole is featured in BBC&#x27;s &quot;Horrible Histories&quot;, where she is portrayed by Dominique Moore. Viewer complaints about the show led the BBC Trust to conclude that the episode&#x27;s portrayal of &quot;racial issues was materially inaccurate&quot;.

A two-dimensional sculpture of Seacole was erected in Paddington in 2013. On 14 October 2016, Google celebrated her with a Google Doodle.

=== Controversy ===
Seacole&#x27;s recognition is seen as controversial, primarily by members of the Nightingale Society, an organization founded by Sociology professor Lynn McDonald in 2012 to &quot;[promote] knowledge of the great contribution to nursing and public health reform made by Florence Nightingale and its relevance today, and [defend] her reputation and legacy when necessary.&quot; McDonald argues that Seacole has been promoted at the expense of Florence Nightingale, and has written on the ways that &quot;...support for Seacole has been used to attack Nightingale&#x27;s reputation as a pioneer in public health and nursing.&quot; There was opposition to the siting of a statue of Mary Seacole at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital on the grounds that she had no connection with this institution, whereas Florence Nightingale did. Sean Lang has stated that she &quot;does not qualify as a mainstream figure in the history of nursing&quot;, while a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; from the Florence Nightingale Society and signed by members including historians and biographers asserted that &quot;Seacole&#x27;s battlefield excursions ... took place post-battle, after selling wine and sandwiches to spectators. Mrs Seacole was a kind and generous businesswoman, but was not a frequenter of the battlefield &#x27;under fire&#x27; or a pioneer of nursing.&quot;
An article by Lynn McDonald in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; asked &quot;How did Mary Seacole come to be viewed as a pioneer of modern nursing?&quot;, comparing her unfavourably with Kofoworola Pratt who was the first black nurse in the NHS, and concluded &quot;She deserves much credit for rising to the occasion, but her tea and lemonade did not save lives, pioneer nursing or advance health care&quot;.

Jennings has suggested that Seacole&#x27;s race has played a part in the resistance by some of Nightingale&#x27;s supporters. The American academic Gretchen Gerzina has also agreed with this theory, claiming that many of the supposed criticisms leveled at Seacole are due to her race. One criticism of Seacole made by supporters of Nightingale is that she was not trained at an accredited medical institution. However, Jamaican women such as 18th century practitioners Nanny of the Maroons and Mrs Grant (Seacole&#x27;s mother), developed their nursing skills from West African healing traditions, such as the use of herbs, which became known as obeah in Jamaica. According to the writer Helen Rappaport, in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the West African and Jamaican creole &quot;doctress&quot;, such as Cubah Cornwallis and Sarah Adams, who both died in the late 1840s, often had greater success than the European-trained doctor who practised what was then traditional medicine. These doctresses of Jamaica practised hygiene decades before Nightingale adopted it as one of her key reforms in her book &quot;Notes on Nursing&quot; in 1859.

Seacole&#x27;s name appears in an appendix to the Key Stage 2 National Curriculum, as an example of a significant Victorian historical figure. There is no requirement that teachers include Seacole in their lessons. At the end of 2012 it was reported that Mary Seacole was to be removed from the National Curriculum. Opposing this, Greg Jenner, historical consultant to &quot;Horrible Histories&quot;, has stated that while he thought her medical achievements may have been exaggerated, removing Seacole from the curriculum would be a mistake. Susan Sheridan has argued that the leaked proposal to remove Seacole from the National Curriculum is part of &quot;a concentration solely on large-scale political and military history and a fundamental shift away from social history.&quot; Many commentators do not accept the view that Seacole&#x27;s accomplishments were exaggerated. British social commentator Patrick Vernon has opined that many of the claims that Seacole&#x27;s achievements were exaggerated have come from an establishment that is determined to suppress and hide the black contribution to British history. Helen Seaton claims that Nightingale fitted the Victorian ideal of a heroine more than Seacole, and that Seacole managing to overcome racial prejudice makes her &quot;a fitting role model for both blacks and non-blacks&quot;. In &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Cathy Newman argues that Michael Gove&#x27;s plans for the new history curriculum &quot;could mean the only women children learn anything about will be queens&quot;.

In January 2013 Operation Black Vote launched a petition to request Education Secretary Michael Gove to drop neither Seacole nor Olaudah Equiano from the National Curriculum. Rev. Jesse Jackson and others wrote a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; protesting against the mooted removal of Mary Seacole from the National Curriculum. This was declared successful on 8 February 2013 when the DfE opted to leave Seacole on the curriculum.

== In popular culture ==
Seacole was portrayed by the actress Sara Powell in a 2021 episode of the BBC science fiction drama &quot;Doctor Who&quot; titled &quot;War of the Sontarans&quot;, alongside Jodie Whittaker as the 13th Doctor.

Seacole is the subject of biodrama &quot;Marys Seacole&quot; (2019) by Jackie Sibblies Drury, which explores her life and imagines her in contemporary settings.

In 2020, Greg Jenner published the book &quot;Dead Famous: An Unexpected History of Celebrity from Bronze Age to Silver Screen&quot;, which is about how instrumental modernity’s earlier technologies were in propelling celebrity culture, such as daily newspapers, and how the celebrity phenomenon has changed and stayed the same. The book briefly talks about Seacole and draws comparisons with Florence Nightingale.

<text>Virtue epistemology is a current philosophical approach to epistemology that stresses the importance of intellectual and specifically epistemic virtues. Virtue epistemology evaluates knowledge according to the properties of the persons, or other knowers, who hold beliefs in addition to or instead of the properties of the propositions and beliefs. Some advocates of virtue epistemology also adhere to theories of virtue ethics, while others see only loose analogy between virtue in ethics and virtue in epistemology.

Intellectual virtue has been a subject of philosophy since the work of Aristotle, but virtue epistemology is a development in the modern analytic tradition. It is characterized by efforts to solve problems of special concern to modern epistemology, such as justification and reliabilism, by focusing on the knower as agent in a manner similar to how virtue ethics focuses on moral agents rather than moral acts.

The area has a parallel in the theory of Unity of knowledge and action proposed by Chinese philosopher Wang Yangming.

== The Raft and the Pyramid ==
Virtue epistemology was partly inspired by a recent renewal of interest in virtue concepts among moral philosophers, and partly as a response to the intractability of the competing analyses of knowledge that arose in response to Edmund Gettier. Ernest Sosa introduced intellectual virtue into contemporary epistemological discussion in a 1980 paper called &quot;The Raft and the Pyramid&quot;.

Sosa argued that an appeal to intellectual virtue could resolve the conflict between foundationalists and coherentists over the structure of epistemic justification. Foundationalism holds that beliefs are founded or based on other beliefs in a hierarchy, similar to the bricks in the structure of a pyramid. Coherentism, on the other hand, uses the metaphor of a raft in which all beliefs are not tied down by foundations but instead are interconnected due to the logical relationships between each belief. Sosa found a flaw in each of these schools of epistemology, in both cases having to do with the relationship between belief and perception.

Coherentism only allows for justification based on logical relations between all the beliefs within a system of beliefs. However, because perceptual beliefs may not have many logical ties with other beliefs in the system, the coherentist account of knowledge cannot accommodate the importance normally attributed to perceptual information. On the other hand, foundationalism arguably encounters a problem when it attempts to describe how foundational beliefs relate to the sensory experiences that support them.

Coherentism and foundationalism developed as responses to the problems with the &quot;traditional&quot; account of knowledge (as justified true belief) developed by Edmund Gettier in 1963. As a result of Gettier&#x27;s counterexamples, competing theories were developed, but the disputes between coherentists and foundationalists proved to be intractable. Sosa&#x27;s paper suggested that virtue may resolve such disputes.

== Theory ==
Virtue epistemology replaces formulaic expressions for apprehending knowledge, such as &quot;S knows that p&quot;, by amending these formulas with virtue theory applied to intellect, where virtue then becomes potential candidates of &quot;knowledge&quot;. This amendation raises problems of its own, however. Some virtue epistemologists use reliabilism as a basis for belief justification, stressing reliable functioning of the intellect.

Virtue epistemology is consistent with some of contextualism. Several areas of contextual epistemology attack the problem of knowledge from an objective standpoint. Virtue epistemology attempts to simplify the analysis of knowledge by replacing of the highest level of knowledge with . Specifically, it leaves room for cognitive relativism. is not constant; it can change depending on the context. Under this view, a well-functioning intellectual faculty is a necessary condition for the formation of knowledge. This differs from other areas of epistemology because it takes the state of an individual&#x27;s intellect into account. As a result of this, social context also has the ability to alter knowledge. Social contexts change over time, making it necessary for beliefs and knowledge to change with it.

Virtue epistemology, similarly to virtue ethics, is based on the intellectual qualities of the individual as opposed to the quality of the belief; virtue epistemology is person-based, rather than belief-based. Consequently, virtue epistemology can stress &quot;epistemic responsibility&quot;—in which an individual is held responsible for the virtue of their knowledge-gathering faculties.

For example, Massimo Pigliucci applies virtue epistemology to critical thinking and suggests the virtuous individual will consider the following:

*non-dismissive consideration of arguments
*charitable interpretation of opposing arguments
*awareness of one&#x27;s own presuppositions and potential for being mistaken
*consultation of expert knowledge
*reliability of source material
*knowledge of what one is talking about rather than merely repeating others&#x27; opinions.

== Varieties ==
Virtue epistemologists differ in the role they believe virtue to play: eliminative virtue replaces epistemic concepts like knowledge and justification with intellectual virtue and intellectual vice, while non-eliminative virtue epistemology retains a role for such traditional concepts and uses virtue to provide substantive explanation of them.

Virtue epistemologists differ in what they believe epistemic virtues to be. Some accounts are Aristotelian, drawing a relationship between intellectual virtue and character in a similar way to the way moral virtue is related to character. &quot;Weak&quot; virtue epistemology, on the other hand, doesn&#x27;t require any particular commitment or cultivation of intellectual virtue. Abrol Fairweather argues that &quot;weak&quot; virtue epistemologists &quot;merely [use] virtue theory as a novel lexicon for expressing an independent epistemic theory&quot;.

Some virtue epistemologists favor the &quot;virtue reliabilist&quot; account of virtues as reliably functioning cognitive faculties, and others favor a &quot;virtue responsibilist&quot; account in which the responsible epistemic conduct of the agent plays a key role.

=== Virtue reliabilism ===
Virtue reliabilism emphasizes that the process whereby truth is garnered must be reliable. However, is not on . Instead, the extent of the person&#x27;s reality-tracking ability determines how virtuous that person&#x27;s intellect is, and therefore how good their knowledge is.

For Sosa, the more virtuous faculties are related to direct sensory perception and memory, and less virtuous capacities are ones related to beliefs derived from the primary memory or sense experience. Sosa has two criteria for a belief to be &quot;fully apt&quot;: It must be &quot;meta-justified&quot;—the agent must have hit the truth as such—and it must be &quot;apt&quot;—the agent must have been displaying his virtuous capacities in claiming such a belief or hitting the truth as such. By analogy, a hunter must not only be able to hit the target with precision and accuracy, but the shot must be one that the hunter &quot;should have taken.&quot;

John Greco, another advocate of virtue reliabilism, believes that knowledge and justified belief &quot;are grounded in stable and reliable cognitive character. Such character may include both a person&#x27;s natural cognitive faculties as well as her acquired habits of thought... So long as such habits are both stable and successful, they make up the kind of character that gives rise to knowledge.&quot; This characterization of virtue reliabilism is more inclusive than Sosa&#x27;s, eschewing the focus on memorial or sensory experience and instead locating virtue in an agent&#x27;s stable and reliable dispositions to generate successful cognition. Greco makes room for the inclusion of the intellectual virtues typically construed by the responsibilist camp of virtue epistemology, since many of these virtues can be thought of as stable, reliable dispositions of character.

=== Virtue responsibilism ===
In virtue responsibilism, the emphasis is not on faculties such as perception and memory. Instead, certain intellectual character traits are valued as more virtuous than others. These can be creativity, inquisitiveness, rational rigor, honesty, or a number of other possibilities. Generally, these theories are normative in nature. A few different approaches are taken.

Some, such as Lorraine Code, think that intellectual virtues involve having the correct cognitive character and epistemic relation to the world rooted in a social context. She sees the acquisition of correct knowledge about the world as the primary &quot;good&quot;, and the end towards which our intellectual efforts should be oriented, with the desire for truth as the primary motivating factor for our epistemological virtues.

James Montmarquet&#x27;s theory of intellectual virtue is similar to Code&#x27;s, but specifically defines additional intellectual virtues in order to defuse the potential dogmatism or fanaticism that is compatible with Code&#x27;s desire for truth. The primary virtue is conscientiousness, which focuses on the correct end of intellectual living. In order to obtain conscientiousness, it is important to maintain impartiality, sobriety, and courage.

Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski has proposed a neo-Aristotelian model of virtue epistemology, emphasizing the role of &quot;phronesis&quot; (practical wisdom) as an architectonic virtue unifying moral and intellectual virtues even more radically than Aristotle proposed. As delineated in her model, the virtues are &quot;a deep and enduring acquired excellence of a person, involving a characteristic motivation to produce a certain desired end and reliable success in bringing about that end.&quot; As she sees it, the &quot;characteristic motivation&quot; of an intellectual virtue is the desire for truth, understanding, and other species of cognitive contact with reality. The notion of &quot;reliable success&quot; is invoked in order to avoid issues of well-intentioned but unsuccessful agents who desire truth but use poorly suited methods to pursue it.

=== Plantinga&#x27;s theory of warrant ===
Alvin Plantinga offers another theory of knowledge closely related to virtue epistemology. According to him, knowledge is warranted if one&#x27;s intellectual faculties are operating as they are designed to. That is, knowledge is valid if it is obtained through the correct operation of the faculties of the intellect which are designed to have an inherent ability, because they are designed that way, to capture and produce true beliefs.

=== Jonathan Kvanvig&#x27;s understanding and assertion ===
In Jonathan Kvanvig&#x27;s essay, &quot;Why Should Inquiring Minds Want to Know?: Meno Problems and Epistemological Axiology&quot; he asserts that epistemology has no place in philosophical study. The value of knowledge originates from the Socratic dialogue written by Plato called Meno. In Meno, Socrates&#x27; distinction between &quot;true belief&quot; and &quot;knowledge&quot; forms the basis of the philosophical definition of knowledge as &quot;justified true belief&quot;. Socrates explains the similarities and differences between &quot;true belief&quot; and &quot;knowledge&quot;, arguing that justified true belief fails to &quot;stay in their place&quot; and must be &quot;tethered&quot;. According to Kvanvig, true belief is what is necessary to maximize truth and to avoid error, thus dropping justification from the equation of knowledge. He argues that once we recognize what the manipulated boundary notion of non-Gettierized account of knowledge is, then it becomes clear that there is nothing valuable about the anti-Gettier condition on knowledge. Kvanvig acknowledges that true belief falls short of knowledge, however to him, true belief is no less valuable than knowledge. Kvanvig believes that epistemology should be focused on understanding, an epistemic standing that Kvanvig maintains is of more value than knowledge and justified true belief.

== Potential advantages ==
Some varieties of virtue epistemology that contain normative elements, such as virtue responsibilism, can provide a unified framework of normativity and value. Others, such as Sosa&#x27;s account, can circumvent Cartesian skepticism with the necessity of externalism interacting with internalism. In this same vein, and because of the inherent flexibility and social nature of some of types of virtue epistemology, social conditioning and influence can be understood within an epistemological framework and explored. This flexibility and connection between internal and external makes virtue epistemology more accessible.

== Prominent criticism ==
One criticism of virtue epistemology has focused upon its characterization of human cognition as grounded in stable character dispositions (e.g. the disposition to use reliable faculties, or one&#x27;s excellent character traits construed as dispositions). As discussed by a parallel criticism leveled at virtue ethics, virtue theories, whether moral or epistemic, typically consider character traits as stable across time, and efficacious as explanatory reasons for persons behaving and thinking as they do. However, this supposition has been challenged by the &quot;situationist critique&quot; in psychology, which argues that human epistemic character changes depending on context, even when that change is epistemically irrelevant. Thus, irrelevant differences in a situation can prompt a drastic change in cognitive behavior.

Reliabilists might characterize this as effecting a drop in reliable functioning, whereas responsibilists would see these variations as negating one&#x27;s excellent cognitive character. It is therefore argued that virtue theorists should either amend their conception of human psychology to accommodate this or explain how the results of situationist psychological research do not contradict their theory.

<doc id="1040828" wikidata="Q8068828" url="?curid=1040828" title="Zelph">
<text>Zelph () is a figure of interest in Mormon studies. In May and June 1834 Joseph Smith led an expedition known as Zion&#x27;s Camp (a paramilitary Latter Day Saint group) on a march from Kirtland, Ohio to Jackson County, Missouri. On June 3, while passing through west-central Illinois near Griggsville, some bones were unearthed from a mound. These bones were identified by Smith as belonging to a Lamanite chieftain-warrior named Zelph. The mound in question is now known as Naples-Russell Mound 8, and is recognized as carrying artifacts from the Havana Hopewell culture (ca. 200 BCE to 400 CE). 

==Background==

In 1834, Joseph Smith said he received a revelation from God, calling for a militia to be raised in Kirtland which would then march to Missouri and &quot;redeem Zion.&quot; About 200 men and a number of women and children volunteered to join this militia, which became known as &quot;Zion&#x27;s Camp.&quot; On June 3, 1834, in Pike County, Illinois, some of the men of Zion&#x27;s Camp located some bones and an arrowhead about a foot below the ground. Smith himself wrote nothing about the event; however, seven of the members of Zion&#x27;s Camp who were with him either recorded or orally related their accounts of what was said. These accounts declared that the bones were from Zelph, a &quot;white Lamanite&quot; general who was a righteous man.

A reference to this event is made in E.D. Howe&#x27;s 1834 book &quot;Mormonism Unvailed&quot;, which states:

A large mound was one day discovered, upon which Gen. Smith ordered an excavation to be made into it; and about one foot from the top of the ground, the bones of a human skeleton were found, which were carefully laid out upon a board, when Smith made a speech, prophesying or declaring that they were the remains of a celebrated General among the Nephites, mentioning his name and the battle in which he was slain, some 1500 years ago.

Contrary to Howe&#x27;s statement that the group found the remains of a &quot;General among the &quot;Nephites&quot;,&quot; all of the recorded accounts agree that Zelph was identified as a &quot;Lamanite&quot;.

==Accounts==
John Taylor publisher of the &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; had been writing &quot;History of Joseph Smith&quot; and included in the January 1, 1846 issue, the following account 

Heber C. Kimball wrote in 1841 that several of the group, along with Joseph Smith, walked to the top of a mound that they had located on the bank of the Illinois river. Kimball states, &quot;On the top of this mound there was the appearance of three altars, which had been built of stone, one above another, according to the ancient order; and the ground was strewn over with human bones.&quot; That prompted Kimball and the others to dig into the mound after sending for a shovel and a hoe:

&quot;At about one foot deep we discovered the skeleton of a man, almost entire; and between two of his ribs we found an Indian arrow, which had evidently been the cause of his death. We took the leg and thigh bones and carried them along with us to Clay county. All four appeared sound.&quot;

After continuing on their journey, Kimball reports that it &quot;was made known to Joseph that he had been an officer who fell in battle, in the last destruction among the Lamanites, and his name was Zelph. This caused us to rejoice much, to think that God was so mindful of us as to show these things to his servant. Brother Joseph had enquired of the Lord and it was made known in a vision.&quot;

Reuben McBride&#x27;s journal account states, &quot;His name was Zelph a war[r]ior under the Prophet Onandagus Zelph a white Laman[i]te.&quot; McBride also wrote that &quot;an arrow was found in his Ribs ... which he said he sup[p]osed oc[c]aisoned his death.&quot; McBride wrote that Zelph &quot;was known from the atlantic to the Rocky Mountains.&quot; Moses Martin stated, &quot;Soon afterward, Joseph had a vision and the Lord shewed him that this man was once a mighty Prophet and many other things concerning his death in which he had fal[l]en no doubt in some great bat[t]le.&quot; Martin also described the skeleton &quot;to be eight or nine feet tall because of the size of the thigh bone.&quot; Levi Hancock&#x27;s journal also refers to &quot;Onendagus,&quot; stating that &quot;Zelf he was a white Lamanite who fought with the people of Onendagus for freedom.&quot; Onondaga is the name of a county in New York state as well as the name of the Onondaga people, a tribe of the Iroquois Confederacy that once occupied the area. Wilford Woodruff&#x27;s journal mentions that the bones were &quot;probably&quot; from the Lamanites and Nephites, even though the printed vision omitted the &quot;probably.&quot;

==Zelph and the question of Book of Mormon geography==
The accounts related to Zelph are used as evidence by some Book of Mormon scholars to suggest that the Lehites inhabited the entire North American continent as proposed by the Hemispheric Geographical Model, rather than merely portions of Central America as suggested by the Limited Geography Model. (See also &quot;Archaeology and the Book of Mormon&quot;)

Although Smith did not mention the Zelph event specifically in his journal, it is clear that during this period he considered the area in which the group was traveling to have been part of the land described in the Book of Mormon. In a letter that Smith wrote to his wife Emma the following day (June 4, 1834), he stated:

The whole of our journey, in the midst of so large a company of social honest and sincere men, wandering over the plains of the Nephites, recounting occasionally the history of the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot;, roving over the mounds of that once beloved people of the Lord, picking up their skulls &amp; their bones, as a proof of its divine authenticity, and gazing upon a country the fertility, the splendour and the goodness so indescribable, all serves to pass away time unnoticed.
Smith&#x27;s thinking regarding the location of Book of Mormon events may have evolved over time. In the 1842 periodical &quot;Times and Seasons&quot;, which names Joseph Smith as publisher, stories about the discovery of ancient Maya ruins on the Yucatán Peninsula offered evidence to the Book of Mormon&#x27;s authenticity. Zelph is not an individual mentioned in the Book of Mormon narrative and would therefore not necessarily be associated with any of the events presumed by some people, including many apologists associated with the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS), to have occurred in Mesoamerica.

The implication of belief in a hemispheric Book of Mormon geography by these men is supported by several references made by Wilford Woodruff. Woodruff writes that he &quot;visited many of the mounds which were flung up by the ancient inhabitants of this continent probably by the Nephites &amp; Lamanites.&quot; Woodruff also states that Zelph &quot;that was known from the hill Cumorah or East sea to the Rocky mountains,&quot; thus implying that the hill Cumorah in New York is the same hill Cumorah referred to in the Book of Mormon. Some LDS scholars believe that &quot;hill Cumorah&quot; was Woodruff&#x27;s term rather than Joseph Smith&#x27;s, since other accounts refer only to the sea and fail to mention either Nephites or the hill Cumorah.

In 1842 Willard Richards compiled a number of records in order to produce a history of the church. Among the records examined were the various accounts related to Zelph. In the process of combining the accounts, Richards crossed out Woodruff&#x27;s references to &quot;hill Cumorah,&quot; and Heber C. Kimball&#x27;s reference to the &quot;last&quot; great struggle with the Lamanites.&quot;

<text>Noah Baumbach (born September 3, 1969) is an American filmmaker. He is known for making light comedies set in New York City and his works are inspired by filmmakers such as Woody Allen and Whit Stillman. His frequent collaborators include Wes Anderson, Adam Driver and his wife, Greta Gerwig.

Baumbach first gained attention for his early films &quot;Kicking and Screaming&quot; (1995), and &quot;Mr. Jealousy&quot; (1997). His breakthrough film &quot;The Squid and the Whale&quot; (2005) earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He first collaborated with Gerwig on &quot;Greenberg&quot; (2010) and their collaborations continued with &quot;Frances Ha&quot; (2013), &quot;Mistress America&quot; (2015), &quot;White Noise&quot; (2022), and &quot;Barbie&quot; (2023).

His other films include &quot;Margot at the Wedding&quot; (2007), &quot;While We&#x27;re Young&quot; (2014), and &quot;The Meyerowitz Stories&quot; (2017). His film &quot;Marriage Story&quot; (2019) earned an Academy Award for Best Picture nomination and Baumbach&#x27;s second Best Original Screenplay nomination. For the film &quot;Barbie&quot; (2023), which he co-wrote with his wife Greta Gerwig, he received his third screenplay nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 96th Academy Awards. He is also known for co-writing with Wes Anderson on &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot; (2004) and &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot; (2009).

== Early life and education==
Baumbach was born on September 3, 1969, in Brooklyn, New York City. His father, Jonathan Baumbach, was an author of experimental fiction and the co-founder of the publishing house Fiction Collective, taught at Stanford University and Brooklyn College, and was a film critic for &quot;Partisan Review&quot;. His mother, Georgia Brown, was a film critic for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; who also wrote fiction. His father was Jewish; his mother is Protestant. His parents divorced during his adolescence, which served as inspiration for his 2005 film &quot;The Squid and the Whale&quot;. Baumbach has three siblings, two of whom are from a previous marriage of his father&#x27;s.

Baumbach grew up in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and from a young age he was determined to become a professional filmmaker. Films that influenced Baumbach include &quot;The Jerk&quot;, &quot;Animal House&quot;, &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;, &quot;The World According To Garp&quot;, &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, and &quot;Invasion Of The Body Snatchers&quot;.

He graduated from Brooklyn&#x27;s Midwood High School in 1987 and received his A.B. in English from Vassar College in 1991. While at Vassar, he and fellow future filmmaker, Jason Blum, were roommates (Blum later produced Baumbach&#x27;s first film, &quot;Kicking and Screaming&quot; in 1995). Soon after, he briefly worked as a messenger at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

== Career ==
===1990s===
Baumbach made his writing and directing debut in 1995 with &quot;Kicking and Screaming&quot;, a comedy about four young men who graduate from college and refuse to move on with their lives. The film starred Josh Hamilton, Chris Eigeman, and Carlos Jacott and premiered in 1995 at the New York Film Festival. In an interview with &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Baumbach said of his influences on the film, &quot;I really responded to the kind of ensemble feeling of &quot;Metropolitan&quot;, I was also thinking a lot about &quot;Diner&quot;, which was another great ensemble &quot;friends&quot; comedy.&quot; Baumbach was chosen as one of &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s &quot;Ten New Faces of 1996&quot;. Roger Ebert praised the film&#x27;s &quot;good eye and a terrific ear; the dialogue by writer-director Noah Baumbach is not simply accurate... but a distillation of reality – elevating aimless brainy small-talk into a statement.&quot; Reviews often mentioned the thin and meandering plot, but most noted this as a facet of the characters&#x27; life stage. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;&quot;Kicking and Screaming&quot; occupies its postage-stamp size terrain with confident comic style.&quot;

In 1997, he wrote and directed &quot;Mr. Jealousy&quot;, a film about a young writer so jealous about his girlfriend that he sneaks into the group therapy sessions of her ex-boyfriend to discover what kind of relationship they had. He then co-wrote (under the name Jesse Carter) and directed (under the name Ernie Fusco) the New York-set comedy of manners &quot;Highball&quot;. Baumbach disowned the film according to a 2005 interview in &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, the director stated,

===2000s===

In 2004, Baumbach collaborated with screenwriter and director Wes Anderson, co-writing with Anderson, &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot; (2004). The following year, he released his fourth feature film, &quot;The Squid and the Whale&quot; (2005) which was a semi-autobiographical comedy-drama about his childhood in Brooklyn and the effect of his parents&#x27; divorce on the family in the mid-1980s. The film stars Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney in the parent roles. In an interview with author Jonathan Lethem in &quot;BOMB Magazine&quot;, Baumbach said of the film, &quot;Sometimes when I think about the whole experience of this, it starts to become a joke within a joke within a joke. The film is not only inspired by my childhood and my parents’ divorce, but it was also the first script I didn&#x27;t show to my parents while I was working on it. It&#x27;s not that I wanted to protect them from anything. I just wanted to keep it my own experience.&quot; &quot;The Squid and the Whale&quot; was a sleeper hit and a critical success, earning Baumbach two awards at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival as well as an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay. It also received six Independent Spirit Award nominations, three Golden Globe nominations and the New York Film Critics Circle, Los Angeles Film Critics Association and the National Board of Review all voted it the year&#x27;s best screenplay. 

Baumbach wrote and directed the 2007 dramedy &quot;Margot at the Wedding&quot;, starring his then wife, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Nicole Kidman, Jack Black, and John Turturro. In the film, Kidman plays a woman named Margot who spends several days visiting her sister Pauline (Leigh) on the eve of Pauline&#x27;s wedding to Black&#x27;s character. It was shot in April and May 2006 in Hampton Bays and City Island, Bronx. The film was released in the United States by Paramount Vantage on November 16, 2007. Baumbach helped to write and direct the short films &quot;Clearing the Air&quot; and &quot;New York Underground&quot; which aired on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The films were co-written and co-produced by cast-members Fred Armisen and Bill Hader. &quot;New York Underground&quot; featured Hader as a British rock journalist doing a piece on quirky underground musician Joshua Rainhorne (Armisen has performed as Joshua at numerous live events). &quot;Clearing the Air&quot; featured Hader, Armisen, and Paul Rudd (who was the guest host for that week) trying to clear the air over a girl they all slept with. Both pieces aired on &quot;SNL&quot; in the fall of 2008. 

Baumbach co-wrote the screenplay for the 2009 film version of Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;Fantastic Mr Fox&quot; with Wes Anderson, who directed it using stop-motion technology. The film was a critical success appearing on many critics top 10 lists of the year. The film also received the Academy Award, British Academy Film Award, and Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Animated Film, losing to Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Up&quot;. Despite the critical praise the film was not a financial success.

===2010s ===

His film &quot;Greenberg&quot; was released March 2010. It starred Ben Stiller, Greta Gerwig and Rhys Ifans. The story was conceived by Baumbach and Jennifer Jason Leigh. The film nominated for the Golden Bear at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival. In 2012, Baumbach directed the comedic drama &quot;Frances Ha&quot;, which he cowrote with Greta Gerwig, who also starred. The film played at the Toronto International Film Festival. Baumbach filmed &quot;Frances Ha&quot; with his cinematographer Sam Levy digitally and in black-and-white, the latter to emulate in part collaborations by Woody Allen and his cinematographer Gordon Willis, in films like &quot;Manhattan&quot; (1979). CBS News compared &quot;Frances Ha&quot;″s style to the works of Woody Allen, Jim Jarmusch and François Truffaut. Gerwig received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance.

Baumbach has &quot;shown an affinity for writing about the East Coast elite.&quot; Baumbach has written an adaptation of Curtis Sittenfeld&#x27;s novel &quot;Prep&quot;. He also co-wrote a screenplay for the animated film &quot;Madagascar 3: Europe&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;. He worked on HBO&#x27;s adaptation of the Jonathan Franzen novel &quot;The Corrections&quot;, but the pilot was never completed and HBO passed on the project. Baumbach wrote and directed the 2014 comedy-drama &quot;While We&#x27;re Young&quot;, starring Ben Stiller, Naomi Watts, Adam Driver and Amanda Seyfried. A24 Films released the film on March 27, 2015, and the film went on to gross more than all of Baumbach&#x27;s previous films in the United States box office. He also directed and cowrote the 2015 comedy &quot;Mistress America&quot;, starring Greta Gerwig and Lola Kirke. The film, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, was released to general audiences on August 14. That same year he presented &quot;De Palma&quot;, a documentary about filmmaker Brian De Palma that he co-directed with Jake Paltrow. It premiered at the 2015 Venice Film Festival.

In 2017, &quot;The Meyerowitz Stories&quot; was released on October 13 on Netflix. Before its streaming debut, the film was selected to compete for the Palme d&#x27;Or in the main competition at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival. The film focuses on a fractured and dysfunctional family, and starred Dustin Hoffman, Ben Stiller, Adam Sandler and Emma Thompson. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 181 reviews, and an average rating of 7.66/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)&quot; observes the family dynamic through writer-director Noah Baumbach&#x27;s bittersweet lens and the impressive efforts of a remarkable cast.&quot; On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.
In 2019, Baumbach wrote, produced and directed &quot;Marriage Story&quot;. The film follows a showbusiness couple and their marriage breaking up followed by an emotional divorce preceding. The film starred Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson as the family couple. Alan Alda, Ray Liotta and Laura Dern also portray the lawyers involved about the divorce. The film also featured performances by Merritt Wever, Julie Hagerty and Wallace Shawn. It premiered to great acclaim at the Venice Film Festival, before it was released on Netflix on November 6, 2019, with many ranking it among Baumbach&#x27;s best work. Mark Kermode, film critic at &quot;The Guardian,&quot; wrote, &quot;this often hilarious heartbreaker is simply Baumbach’s best film to date – insightful, sympathetic and rather beautifully bewildered.&quot; Kermode also compared the film to &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977), &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; (1979) and &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; (1937). The film went on to receive six Academy Award nominations, including for Best Picture, and Best Original Screenplay. Driver and Johansson also received nominations in leading roles. Laura Dern won the Oscar for a supporting role. With the release of &quot;Marriage Story&quot;, it also made Baumbach one of the few screenwriters to ever sweep &quot;The Big Four&quot; critics awards: Los Angeles Film Critics Association, National Board of Review, New York Film Critics Circle, and National Society of Film Critics.

=== 2020s ===
Baumbach&#x27;s feature film &quot;White Noise&quot; was adapted from the 1985 novel of the same name by Don DeLillo. The film reunited him with Greta Gerwig and Adam Driver, and was released by Netflix on December 30, 2022. The film premiered at the 79th Venice International Film Festival where it competed for the Golden Lion. The film received mixed reviews. In 2023, Baumbach again collaborated with Gerwig, co-writing the screenplay for her film &quot;Barbie&quot; starring Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and America Ferrera. The film released on July 21, 2023 to critical acclaim and grossed $1.4 billion worldwide. Baumbach and Gerwig received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay, and Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay. Baumbach&#x27;s unpublished memoir was acquired by Knopf in 2023.

His upcoming film &quot;Jay Kelly&quot;, which is his fourth from Netflix, is described as a &quot;coming-of-age story about adults&quot;. Baumbach cast George Clooney and Adam Sandler. He co-wrote the film with actress Emily Mortimer and the film will be produced by David Heyman and Amy Pascal. Netflix boss Scott Stuber said: &quot;Noah Baumbach&#x27;s got an excellent kind of Jerry Maguire-esque, for lack of a better analogy, but a really great life-affirming movie with two big movie stars that&#x27;s starting to come together, so that&#x27;ll be exciting.&quot;

== Influences ==
Baumbach noted that comedian and filmmaker Woody Allen was &quot;an obvious influence&quot;, stating, &quot;He was the single biggest pop culture influence on me&quot;. He has cited the films &quot;Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Zelig&quot;, and &quot;Broadway Danny Rose&quot; as influences on his work. 

He has also cited Ernst Lubitsch, Max Ophüls, Jean Renoir, Robert Altman, Peter Bogdanovich, Spike Lee, Whit Stillman, Steven Spielberg, as well as the screwball comedies of the 30s and 40s, and the films of the French New Wave as influences. His favorite film of all time is &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;.

Baumbach is a fan of the &quot;beautiful&quot; music of electronic acts New Order and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), and sought to &quot;do something that evoked&quot; those bands on the soundtrack of &quot;Mistress America&quot; (2015). He has also cited David Bowie and Paul McCartney, and the film scores of Tangerine Dream and Georges Delerue, as important to him.

== Personal life ==
Baumbach met actress Jennifer Jason Leigh in 2001 while she was starring on Broadway in &quot;Proof&quot;. The couple married on September 2, 2005. They have a son, Rohmer, who was named after French director Éric Rohmer. Leigh filed for divorce from Baumbach on November 15, 2010, in Los Angeles, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalized in September 2013.

Baumbach&#x27;s romantic and creative collaboration with actress, writer and director Greta Gerwig began late in 2011, after they met during the production of &quot;Greenberg&quot;. They have two sons, born March 2019 and February 2023. Twelve years into their relationship, Baumbach and Gerwig married at New York City Hall in December 2023.

Baumbach&#x27;s brother Nico is a film theorist and associate professor at Columbia University&#x27;s Center for Comparative Media.

<doc id="1040845" wikidata="Q272431" url="?curid=1040845" title="Vida Guerra">
<text>Vida Guerra (born March 19, 1974) is a Cuban-born American glamour model and actress. Her first notable appearance was in the U.S. edition of &quot;FHM&quot; magazine in December 2002; since then, she has modeled for many other men&#x27;s magazines.

==Early life==
Born in Havana, Cuba, Guerra, still a child, migrated with her family to the United States, moving to Perth Amboy, New Jersey. While growing up, she entered several fashion shows modeling swim wear, and has appeared in music videos.

==Career==
Guerra&#x27;s first national exposure came when she appeared in a lingerie spread for &quot;FHM&quot; in December 2002. The magazine later reported that following its publication, almost one third of received mail was from readers demanding more photos of her. She was called back for more photo shoots and became &quot;&quot;FHM&quot;&#x27;s Model of the Year&quot; in 2004. Since then, she has been featured in many magazines, including &quot;DUB&quot;, &quot;Smooth&quot;, &quot;Escape&quot;, and &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;, often as the cover girl.

Guerra has made multiple appearances on several Spanish language television programs such as entertainment gossip show &quot;El Gordo y la Flaca&quot; (&quot;The Fat guy and The Skinny girl&quot;). She has also become a staple in music videos, appearing in &quot;Shake Ya Tailfeather&quot; (Nelly, P. Diddy and Murphy Lee, from the &quot;Bad Boys II&quot; soundtrack, 2003) and &quot;The New Workout Plan&quot; (Kanye West, 2004), in &quot;Obsession (No Es Amor)&quot; (Frankie J featuring Baby Bash, 2005) among others. In addition, Guerra has appeared in a commercial for Burger King&#x27;s TenderCrisp Bacon Cheddar Ranch, a couple of sketches on &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; (including &quot;R. Kelly&#x27;s &#x27;(I Wanna) Piss on You&#x27; Music Video&quot;, which spoofed the R. Kelly sex tape), and the film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Dorm Daze 2&quot;.

In April 2005, Guerra&#x27;s camera phone was allegedly hacked. Dozens of photos, including nude pictures, were widely disseminated on the Internet. Guerra said the nude images were of another woman, and that they had been mixed with genuine, non-nude camera-phone images of her to create the false appearance that she was the naked woman pictured.

Guerra was voted Number 26 in &quot;&quot;FHM&quot;&#x27;s Top 100 Sexiest Females&quot; of 2005 and has twice been named the winner of the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best Butt Award&quot;. She has produced her own swimsuit calendars (and accompanying &quot;behind the scenes&quot; DVDs) and a 2006 DVD titled &quot;Vida Guerra: Exposed&quot;.

The July 2006 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; featured the first formal nude photos of Guerra. Part of her motivation for posing for the magazine, she said, was the camera phone incident; she wanted people to see what she really looked like naked.

The first song from Guerra&#x27;s debut album, &quot;You Got Me&quot;, was leaked to the Internet on November 2, 2006.

In a July 2008 interview on &quot;The Jace Hall Show&quot;, she spoke about her show &quot;Livin&#x27; the Low Life&quot;, stating that &quot;I didn&#x27;t like it [lowrider cars] at first, I mean, they were cool, but now that I did the first season I&#x27;m actually gonna get one.&quot;

She also appeared in the &quot;&quot;FHM&quot; sexiest woman of the year 2017&quot;, ranked at 89th position.

==Personal life==
Guerra is a vegetarian. Regarding vegetarianism, she has stated &quot;I feel really healthy, and it works on so many different levels, including the condition of my skin&quot;. In 2011, she appeared nude in a campaign for PETA, in support of vegetarianism.

<doc id="1040849" wikidata="Q6387468" url="?curid=1040849" title="Ken Coleman">
<text>Kenneth Robert Coleman (April 22, 1925 – August 21, 2003) was an American radio and television sportscaster for more than four decades (1947–1989).

==Early life==
Coleman was born in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1925, the son of William (a salesman) and his wife Frances. The family subsequently moved to Dorchester, Massachusetts, and then to nearby Quincy, where he was raised. Coleman graduated from North Quincy High School in 1943. He was a pitcher on the North Quincy High School baseball team, and subsequently played in the semi-pro Park League. But Coleman had dreams of being a sports broadcaster from the time he was a boy, when he enjoyed listening to the games on radio.

After serving in the U.S. Army, where he was a sergeant during World War II, Coleman took oratory courses for one year at Curry College, and then broke into broadcasting in Rutland, Vermont, in 1947, working for station WSYB. He called the play-by-play of the Rutland Royals of the Vermont Northern League, a summer collegiate baseball circuit akin to the Cape Cod League. Coleman also was a newscaster and a deejay on the station. He was hired by station WJDA in Quincy, where he worked as a sports reporter until 1951; he then worked for a year at WNEB in Worcester. During this time, Coleman was broadcasting Boston University football during the Harry Agganis era.

==Broadcasting career==
===Cleveland Indians and Browns===
Coleman received critical praise for his college football play-by-play, which led to his big break: in 1952, he got the opportunity to broadcast for the NFL Cleveland Browns (1952–1965), calling play-by-play of every touchdown that Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown ever scored. He also began his MLB broadcasting career, calling Cleveland Indians games on television for ten seasons (1954–1963). In his first year with the Indians, Coleman called their record-setting 111-win season and their World Series loss to the New York Giants.

Coleman broadcast college football for various teams, including Ohio State and Harvard, as well as BU. He was the play-by-play announcer for the 1968 Harvard-Yale football game, a game forever remembered for the incredible Harvard comeback from a 16-point deficit to tie Yale at 29–29 in the game&#x27;s last 42 seconds. Coleman also called NFL games for NBC in the early 1970s, and later in his career called Connecticut and Fairfield basketball games for Connecticut Public Television.

===Boston Red Sox===
In 1966, Coleman was named the lead play-by-play announcer for the Boston Red Sox on both radio and television, succeeding Curt Gowdy, who resigned after 15 years of calling Red Sox games to become the top play-by-play voice for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Major League Baseball Game of the Week&quot;. Coleman joined a broadcast team that also included Ned Martin and color man Mel Parnell, and signed a three-year contract that paid him $40,000 per year. Coleman broadcast the 1967 World Series (which the Red Sox lost to the St. Louis Cardinals) for NBC television, working alongside Gowdy, and radio.

Coleman was the &quot;Voice of the Red Sox&quot; on both WHDH-AM 850 and the original WHDH-TV for six seasons, through 1971. When the FCC revoked WHDH&#x27;s television license during the winter of 1971–1972, the Red Sox split their radio and TV announcing crews and signed a three-year contract with WBZ-TV. Coleman and color man Johnny Pesky worked exclusively on television through the 1974 season. In 1975, the Red Sox awarded their television rights to WSBK-TV and increased their telecast schedule from 65 to over 100 games, and the new flagship station opted for a new broadcasting team, Dick Stockton and Ken Harrelson. Coleman then returned to Ohio. From 1975 to 1978, he was the play-by-play man for WLWT and the Cincinnati Reds&#x27; television network, calling regular-season games for the Big Red Machine&#x27;s back-to-back 1975–1976 World Series champions.

After the Red Sox&#x27; legendary radio combination of Ned Martin and Jim Woods were fired for failing to follow the dictates of sponsors following the 1978 season, Coleman went back to Boston in 1979 and spent 11 years as the Red Sox&#x27; top radio voice. He broadcast the Red Sox&#x27; 1986 World Series loss to the New York Mets and two Red Sox ALCS (1986 and 1988). Coleman remained in the Red Sox booth until his retirement in 1989. He worked with #2 announcers Rico Petrocelli, Jon Miller and Joe Castiglione during this &quot;second term&quot; with the Red Sox.

It was Coleman who was on the call on the Red Sox Radio Network when Red Sox first baseman Bill Buckner let a groundball hit by Mookie Wilson of the New York Mets go through his legs at the end of Game 6 of the 1986 World Series:

In 1972, Coleman returned briefly to the NFL, rotating play-by-play duties with Stockton for New England Patriots&#x27; preseason games on WBZ-TV with no color commentators.

Additionally, he wrote books on sportscasting, was one of the founding fathers of the Red Sox Booster Club and the BoSox Club, and was intimately involved with the Jimmy Fund, which raises money for cancer research.

==Personal life and death==
Coleman followed the routine of taking a swim in the Atlantic Ocean as often as he could through the late fall and into the earliest days of spring, until his death.

He was the father of the late Cleveland sports and newscaster Casey Coleman, who died in 2006 from pancreatic cancer.

Coleman was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame on May 18, 2000, at the age of 75. He died three years later, aged 78, in Plymouth, Massachusetts, from complications of bacterial meningitis.

<text>The radio window is the region of the radio spectrum that penetrate the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Typically, the lower limit of the radio window&#x27;s range has a value of about 10 MHz (λ ≈ 30 m); the best upper limit achievable from optimal terrestrial observation sites is equal to approximately 1 THz (λ ≈ 0.3 mm).

It plays an important role in astronomy; up until the 1940s, astronomers could only use the visible and near infrared spectra for their measurements and observations. With the development of radio telescopes, the radio window became more and more utilizable, leading to the development of radio astronomy that provided astrophysicists with valuable observational data.

== Factors affecting lower and upper limits ==
The lower and upper limits of the radio window&#x27;s range of frequencies are not fixed; they depend on a variety of factors.

=== Absorption of mid-IR ===
The upper limit is affected by the vibrational transitions of atmospheric molecules such as oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O), whose energies are comparable to the energies of mid-infrared photons: these molecules largely absorb the mid-infrared radiation that heads towards Earth.

=== Ionosphere ===
The radio window&#x27;s lower frequency limit is greatly affected by the ionospheric refraction of the radio waves whose frequencies are approximately below 30 MHz (λ &gt; 10 m); radio waves with frequencies below the limit of 10 MHz (λ &gt; 30 m) are reflected back into space by the ionosphere. The lower limit is proportional to the density of the ionosphere&#x27;s free electrons and coincides with the plasma frequency:
formula_1
where formula_2 is the plasma frequency in Hz and formula_3 the electron density in electrons per cubic meter. Since it is highly dependent on sunlight, the value of formula_3 changes significantly from daytime to nighttime usually being lower during the day, leading to a decrease of the radio window&#x27;s lower limit and higher during the night, causing an increase of the radio window&#x27;s lower frequency end. However, this also depends on the solar activity and the geographic position.

=== Troposphere ===

When performing observations, radio astronomers try to extend the upper limit of the radio window towards the 1 THz optimum, since the astronomical objects give spectral lines of greater intensity in the higher frequency range. Tropospheric water vapour greatly affects the upper limit since its resonant absorption frequency bands are 22.3 GHz (λ ≈ 1.32 cm), 183.3 GHz (λ ≈ 1.64 mm) and 323.8 GHz (λ ≈ 0.93 mm). The tropospheric oxygen&#x27;s bands at 60 GHz (λ ≈ 5.00 mm) and 118.74 GHz (λ ≈ 2.52 mm) also affect the upper limit. To tackle the issue of water vapour, many observatories are built at high altitudes where the climate is more dry. However, few can be done to avoid the oxygen&#x27;s interference with radio waves propagation.

=== Radio frequency interference ===
The width of the radio window is also affected by radio frequency interference which hinders the observations at certain wavelength ranges and undermines the quality of the observational data of radio astronomy.

<text>Maleševci () was a historical Vlach katun of Herzegovina that existed in the Late Middle Ages.

==Origins==
The Maleševci are mentioned alongside numerous Herzegovinian katuns in the 14th and 15th archives from Dubrovnik and Kotor, where they are described as Vlachs. The name &quot;Maleševci&quot; is the plural of &quot;Maleševac&quot;, itself derived from the personal name &quot;Maleš&quot;, the likely founder of the tribe. Apart from the tribe, &quot;Maleš&quot; is attested in two Vlach katuns from the Prizren estate, in the 14th century. It also gave the patronymic names &quot;Malešev&quot; and &quot;Malešević&quot;, and might be related to the toponym Maleševo, found in several locations in present-day Serbia and Bulgaria.

==History==

===Middle Ages===
The earliest known written record referring to the tribe is a Ragusan document, written on January 14, 1374, addressing &quot;de Malleseva&quot; tribe-clan. They were part of a large group of Herzegovinian Vlachs, led by the &quot;katunar&quot; Stanko Perutinić (first mentioned in 1397) and his brothers and descendants in the late 14th and early 15th centuries. The Maleševci &quot;katun&quot; developed on the territory of Rudine, Kuta and Korita, and the name Perutinić sometime replaced the name Maleševci, but the latter prevailed.

In 1422 as &quot;katunar&quot;s were recorded Klapac Stanković and Radosav Milićević, later Dubravac Milićević (1428), Stanoje Stanković (1434), Vukac Dubravčić (1461-1468). Stanko Perutinić had three brothers, Milić, Miloš and Hrebeljan, and with their heirs were vassals of Pavlović, while Stanko&#x27;s heirs of Kosača (Sandalj Hranić, Stjepan Vukčić Kosača) noble family. From 1466 are recorded under Ottoman rule. They like Vlachs from other tribes sometime collaborated with Ottomans as slave agents.

==Families==
Many Serbian Orthodox families were members of Maleševci katun. Characteristic for the tribe-clan in Herzegovina is that all families have the Serbian Orthodox &quot;slava&quot; (patron saint feast day) of St. Ignatius.

<doc id="1040858" wikidata="Q28401080" url="?curid=1040858" title="Agile Communications">
<text>Agile Communications is a licensed national telecommunications carrier based in South Australia and was the first South Australian based company to gain this license. The company is the wholesale subsidiary of ISP Internode. The company was founded by Internode Managing Director Simon Hackett and Catherine Conway and is based in Adelaide. Internode and Agile were bought out by iiNet in 2012 and iiNet itself was acquired by TPG Telecom in 2015.

== History ==
In May 2001, Agile built the Coorong Network, a microwave network interlinking Adelaide, Murray Bridge, Tailem Bend, Binnies Hill, Tintinara and Meningie using Cisco based hardware.

In October 2003, Agile installed its own equipment in the Telstra exchange at Meningie, South Australia to provide ADSL to a town where Telstra was yet to provide broadband ADSL. This made it the first exchange in Australia where ADSL was available, but not through Telstra.

In late 2003, Agile began a rollout of a national network, an Optic Fibre based IP network running on STM-1 Packet over Sonet (POS) links to connect all Agile POPs across Australia.

The national network currently extends to Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney, Perth, Canberra and Hobart. In 2005, Agile extended their national network to the United States with points of presence in Los Angeles and San Jose.

From 2007 Agile designed and rolled out a broadband service using licensed fixed WiMax radio technology across the Coorong and Yorke Peninsula regions of South Australia. The service was retailed to customers by Internode and regional Internode resellers.

At the time of its sale, Agile had built 45 rural microwave installations in country SA with the Riverland and Murraylands also added to the network.

The Agile International network has become the core of the international network of iiNet and Internode following the acquisition of the Internode company group by iiNet.

<text>World College West was an undergraduate liberal arts college in Marin County, California. Founded by Dr. Richard M. Gray, it offered a program that integrated a grounding in the liberal arts with work-study and a required two-quarter &quot;World Study&quot; in a developing country. It opened with its first seven students on September 17, 1973.

== History ==
Fully accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, World College West had programs in International Service and Development (ISD), International Environmental Studies (IES), Art and Society (AS), and Meaning, Culture, and Change (MCC). In later years, Business and International Business was added to the program line-up. ISD focused on the economic, political, and social development of &quot;Third World&quot; nations; IES concentrated on the wise use and global conservation of natural resources; AS examined the relationship between culture and the performing and visual arts; and MCC focused on the variety of ways in which the world&#x27;s diverse cultures, through their systems of religion, philosophy, and tradition, give meaning and purpose to human life, and to the world around us.

The college&#x27;s World Study Programs were established in China, Mexico, Nepal, India, Ghana, and Russia. Students could spend two quarters (six months) studying in both an urban and rural setting in one of these countries. During the urban stay, students lived with a host family and attended regularly scheduled language, culture, and history classes. During the rural stay, students again lived with host families and conducted independent research studies while continuing to learn the country&#x27;s language.

The college placed a special emphasis on work-study and internships, because the founders of the college believed that learning occurred best through &quot;disciplined reflection on experience&quot;. Once an area of study was selected, students were required to complete 480 internship hours in their field of study as part of their graduation requirement.

During its first few years, the College leased space on the campus of the San Francisco Theological Seminary in San Anselmo, followed by several years in surplus army barracks at Fort Cronkhite on the Pacific Ocean. In the early 1980s the college built and moved to a permanent campus off U.S. Highway 101 in the rolling hills of northern Marin County, between Novato and Petaluma (now the home of the Institute of Noetic Sciences).

World College West closed due to inadequate funding in Fall of 1992, the result of difficulties in succession after its founding president retired. The spirit of WCW lives on in Dick Gray&#x27;s successor institution Presidio Graduate School. The hundreds of WCW alumni call themselves &quot;Westies&quot;.

After the college closed, alumni transcripts and records were transferred to nearby Sonoma State University.

<text>ICON is the name of at least five science fiction conventions:

* ICON (Iowa science fiction convention) is held in the Cedar Rapids/Iowa City area since 1975, usually in late October or early November, under the auspices of the Mindbridge Foundation, a not-for-profit foundation which also sponsors the Gamicon and AnimeIowa conventions.
* I-CON is held in Stony Brook, New York, every spring, on the campus of Stony Brook University since 1981. I-CON (with a hyphen) is short for Island Convention – a reference to its location on Long Island.
* ICon festival is the main Israeli annual science fiction, fantasy and role-playing convention (now officially a festival) – standing for Israeli Convention. It has been held in Tel Aviv annually since 1996 during Sukkot.
* Icon was the name of the 2005 National Science Fiction Convention in New Zealand.
* iCON is an annual science fiction, fantasy and role-playing convention in Turkey, Istanbul held by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Club of Istanbul University.

<doc id="1040882" wikidata="Q421637" url="?curid=1040882" title="Clobetasol propionate">
<text>Clobetasol propionate is a corticosteroid that is used to treat skin conditions such as eczema, contact dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, steroid responsive dermatosis, and psoriasis (including scalp and plaque-type). It is applied to the skin as a cream, foam, gel, liquid, solution, ointment, or shampoo. Clobetasol propionate is a propionate ester of the corticosteroid clobetasol.
Common side effects include skin irritation, dry skin, redness, pimples, and telangiectasia. Serious side effects may include adrenal suppression, allergic reactions, cellulitis, and Cushing&#x27;s syndrome. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety. Clobetasol is believed to work by activating steroid receptors.
Clobetasol propionate was patented in 1968 and came into medical use in 1978. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 156th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3million prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==
Clobetasol propionate is used for the treatment of various skin disorders including eczema, herpes labialis, psoriasis, and lichen sclerosus. It is also used to treat several auto-immune diseases including alopecia areata, lichen planus (auto immune skin nodules), and mycosis fungoides (T-cell skin lymphoma). It is used as a first-line treatment for both acute and chronic GVHD of the skin.

Clobetasol propionate is used cosmetically for skin whitening, although this use is controversial. The US Food and Drug Administration has not approved it for that purpose, and sales without a prescription are illegal in the US. Nonetheless, skin-whitening creams containing this ingredient can sometimes be found in beauty supply stores in New York City and on the internet. It is also sold internationally and does not require a prescription in some countries. Whitening creams with clobetasol propionate, such as Hyprogel, can make skin thin and easily bruised, with visible capillaries, and acne. It can also lead to hypertension, elevated blood sugar, suppression of the body&#x27;s natural steroids, and stretch marks, which may be permanent.

Clobetasol propionate is, along with mercury and hydroquinone, &quot;amongst the most toxic, the latter in higher concentrations, and most used agents in lightening products.&quot; Many products sold illegally have higher concentrations of clobetasol propionate than is permitted for prescription drugs.

Clobetasol 0.05% is considered a member of the &quot;super-high potency&quot; group of topical corticosteroids out of seven total groups in the United States classification system of topical corticosteroids.

== Society and culture ==
=== Brand names ===
Clobetasol propionate is marketed and sold worldwide under many names, including Clobex, Clob-x, Clovate, Clobet, Clonovate, Cormax, Haloderm, Pentasol, Cosvate, Clop, Propysalic, Temovate, Dermovate, Olux, ClobaDerm, Tenovate, Dermatovate, Butavate, Movate, Novate, Salac, Powercort, Lotasbat, Kloderma, Lemonvate, Clobesol, Dovate, Delor, Psovate, Clinoderm [Thailand] and Skineal.

<text>The RIM-162 Evolved SeaSparrow Missile (ESSM) is a development of the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missile used to protect ships from attacking missiles and aircraft. ESSM is designed to counter supersonic maneuvering anti-ship missiles. ESSM also has the ability to be &quot;quad-packed&quot; in the Mark 41 Vertical Launch System, allowing up to four ESSMs to be carried in a single cell.

==Design==
The original Sea Sparrow was an expedient design intended to provide short-range defensive fire in a system that could be deployed as rapidly as possible. The AIM-7 Sparrow was the simplest solution, as its radar guidance allowed it to be fired head-on at targets. The radar signal could be provided by mounting an aircraft radar on a trainable platform on a ship. In the years after its introduction, it was upgraded to follow improvements being made in the air-to-air Sparrow models used by the US Navy and US Air Force. The ultimate version in this line was the R model, which introduced a new dual-seeker homing system and many other upgrades. In the air-to-air role, however, this was passed over in favor of the AIM-120 AMRAAM, which offered much higher performance from a smaller and lighter missile. Development of the air-to-air Sparrow ended in the 1990s.

Only the Sea Sparrow, therefore, remained using the basic platform — with no need to be suitable for aircraft. Rather than using the existing P and R models, it was decided to dramatically upgrade the weapon. The Evolved SeaSparrow (ESSM) emerged as a completely new weapon, sharing only the name with the original. All of the same support equipment was used, though, allowing it to be fitted to ships already mounting the older models. Compared to the Sea Sparrow, ESSM has a larger, more powerful rocket motor — developed by Orbital ATK in cooperation with Nammo Raufoss — for increased range and agility, as well as upgraded aerodynamics using strakes and skid-to-turn. In addition, ESSM takes advantage of the latest missile guidance technology, with different versions for Aegis/AN/SPY-1, Sewaco/Active Phased Array Radar (APAR), and traditional target illumination all-the-way.

In the 2000s the NATO Seasparrow Project Office began planning an upgraded Block 2 version of the ESSM. In 2014 Canada pledged 200M CAD to underwrite their share of the Block 2&#x27;s development cost. ESSM Block 2 leverages the existing Block 1 rocket motor and features a dual-mode X band seeker, increased maneuverability, and other enhancements. Block 2 features enhanced communications systems that allow mid-course guidance correction, making the missiles easy to network into the Navy&#x27;s emerging Cooperative Engagement Capability. Unlike Block 1, Block 2&#x27;s active radar homing seeker supports terminal engagement without the launch ship&#x27;s target illumination radars. The upgraded blast-fragmentation warhead was designed, developed and is being produced by Roketsan. The improved ESSM Block II will be fielded by the US Navy from 2020.

==Launchers==

===Mk 29===

The original launcher is Mark 29 Guided Missile Launching System Mod. 4 &amp; 5 (Mk 29 GMLS Mod 4 &amp; 5), which is developed from earlier models Mk 29 Mod 1/2/3 for Sea Sparrow. Mk 29 launchers provide on-mount stowage and launching capability for firing up to eight missiles in a self-contained environmentally controlled trainable launcher design.

===Mk 41===
The Mark 41 Vertical Launching System is the primary launch system for the Evolved SeaSparrow Missile. The Mk 41 is deployed aboard destroyers and frigates, primarily of the United States and allied nations. The ESSM is quadpacked within a Mk 41 cell allowing a significantly increased missile load over SM-2.

===Mk 48===
In addition to the Mk 29 GMLS and Mk 41 VLS, the other primary launcher is Mk 48 VLS. The 2-cell module of Mk 48 makes the system very versatile and enables it to be installed on board in spaces that otherwise cannot be utilized. The weight of a 2-cell module of Mk 48 is 660 kg (1,450 lb; including empty canisters), 330 kg (725 lb) for exhaust system, and 360 kg (800 lb) for ship installation interfaces. Each canister of the Mk 48 VLS houses a single RIM-7VL (Vertically Launched) Sea Sparrow cell or two RIM-162 ESSM cells, though, with modification, other missiles can also be launched. There are a total of four models in the Mk 48 family, with Mod 0 &amp; 1 housing either 2 RIM-7VL or 4 RIM-162 cells, Mod 2 housing either 16 RIM-7VL or 32 RIM-162 cells. Mod 0/1/2 are usually grouped into either a 16-cell module for RIM-7VL or a 32-cell module for RIM-162. Mod 3 fits into the StanFlex modules on Royal Danish Navy ships and can house either 6 RIM-7VL or 12 RIM-162 cells; the Danes now use the latter.

===Mk 56===
The successor of the Mk 48 VLS is the Mark 56 Guided Missile Vertical Launching System (Mk 56 GMVLS) or simply Mk 56. In comparison to its predecessor, the Mk 56 utilizes a greater percentage of composite material, reducing the weight by more than 20%. The Mexican Navy will be one of the customers of the Mk 56, using an 8-cell launcher on their Sigma-class design frigates.

Specifications:

===Mark 57 (Mk 57)===
The Mk 57 Peripheral Vertical Launching System (PVLS), an evolution of Mk 41 VLS, is used on &quot;Zumwalt&quot;-class destroyers. It is designed to be installed on the ship periphery instead of centralized magazines. It comes in 4-cell launcher modules and provides backwards compatibility with existing missiles, while allowing new missiles with significantly increased propulsion and payloads.

==AMRAAM-ER==

The AMRAAM-ER is an Extended Range upgrade to the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile for the NASAMS ground-based air defense system, which combines ESSM rocket motor with the AMRAAM two-stage seeker head.

==Operational history==

US operational evaluation was conducted in July 2002 aboard . Initial operational capability did not occur until later.

In October 2003, at the USN Pacific Missile Range Facility near Hawaii, Australian frigate conducted a successful firing of an ESSM. The firing was also the first operational use of the CEA Technologies CWI for guidance.

In November 2003, approximately from the Azores, the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNLN) frigate conducted a live fire test of a single ESSM. This firing was the first ever live firing involving a full-size ship-borne active electronically scanned array (i.e. the APAR radar) guiding a missile using the Interrupted Continuous Wave Illumination (ICWI) technique in an operational environment. As related by Jane&#x27;s Navy International:
During the tracking and missile-firing tests, target profiles were provided by Greek-built EADS/3Sigma Iris PVK medium-range subsonic target drones. [...] According to the RNLN, ... &quot;APAR immediately acquired the missile and maintained track until destruction&quot;. [...] These ground-breaking tests represented the world&#x27;s first live verification of the ICWI technique.

In August 2004, a German Navy completed a series of live missile firings at the Point Mugu missile launch range off the coast of California that included a total of 11 ESSM missile firings. The tests included firings against target drones such as the Northrop BQM-74E Chukkar III and Teledyne Ryan BQM-34S Firebee I, as well as against missile targets such as the Beech AQM-37C and air-launched Kormoran 1 anti-ship missiles.

Further live firings were performed by the RNLN frigate HNLMS &quot;De Zeven Provinciën&quot; in March 2005, again in the Atlantic Ocean approximately west of the Azores. The tests involved three live-firing events (two of which involved the ESSM) including firing a single SM-2 Block IIIA at an Iris target drone at long range, a single ESSM at an Iris target drone, and a two-salvo launch (with one salvo comprising two SM-2 Block IIIAs and the other comprising two ESSMs) against two incoming Iris target drones.

All ESSM launches from and &quot;Sachsen&quot;-class frigates involved ESSMs quad-packed in a Mark 41 Vertical Launching System.

The first &quot;kill&quot; by the RIM-162D from a United States Navy carrier&#x27;s Mk 29 launcher was achieved during a training exercise by on 7 October 2008.

On 14 May 2013, the ESSM intercepted a high-diving supersonic test target, demonstrating the ability to hit high-G maneuvering, low-velocity air threats, as well as surface targets. No software changes were needed to prove the ESSM&#x27;s enhanced capability.

On 30 August 2015, during the annual &#x27;Co-operation Afloat Readiness and Training&#x27; (&#x27;CARAT&#x27;) exercise, the ESSM was fired from the Royal Thai Navy &quot;Naresuan&quot;-class guided-missile frigate HTMS &quot;Naresuan&quot; and achieved a direct hit on a BQM-74E drone missile launched from the USN amphibious dock landing ship USS &quot;Germantown&quot;.

On 9 October 2016, fired one RIM-162 ESSM and two SM-2s to defend against two incoming Houthi anti-ship cruise missiles, potentially Chinese-built C-802 missiles. It is unknown if the RIM-162 was responsible for intercepting either of the missiles, but the incident marked the first time the ESSM was used in a combat situation. 

In 2018, the ESSM Block 2 passed its first live fire test, successfully intercepting a BQM-74E target drone using its active guidance seeker-head.

<text>Franco Cerri (29 January 1926 – 18 October 2021) was an Italian guitarist and double bassist.

==Biography==
Cerri was born in Milan and learned to play guitar when he was 17. In 1945 he became a member of the group led by Gorni Kramer and joined the orchestra of the television show &quot;Buone vacanze&quot;. He played double bass in addition to guitar starting in the 1950s, such as with Chet Baker and Buddy Collette. He has also played with Dizzy Gillespie, Johnny Griffin, Stéphane Grappelli, Lars Gullin, Billie Holiday, Lee Konitz, Gerry Mulligan, Lou Bennett, Bud Shank, Tony Scott, Django Reinhardt, Phil Woods, and the Modern Jazz Quartet. He cited as influences Django Reinhardt, Barney Kessell, and René Thomas.

Cerri has led quartets and quintets with Tullio De Piscopo, Pino Presti, Gianluigi Trovesi, Flavio Ambrosetti, and Jean-Luc Ponty.

In 1980 he formed a duo with pianist Enrico Intra, with whom he founded the &quot;Civica Scuola di Jazz&quot; in Milan.

On 1 January 2006, he was knighted by President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.

<doc id="1040906" wikidata="Q934273" url="?curid=1040906" title="Powerade">
<text>Powerade is a sports drink created in 1988 and sold by the Coca-Cola Company. Its primary competitor is Gatorade, which is owned by PepsiCo since 2001.

==History==
Powerade was created by the Coca-Cola Company and first released in 1988. The company developed the soft drink as an alternative to sports drinks, which were becoming more and more popular. Powerade was originally marketed to athletes, who needed a drink that would keep them hydrated during strenuous workouts.

In 2000, Powerade became the official sports drink of the Olympics, alongside Aquarius, another sports drink made by Coca-Cola. It is a rival of another sports drink, Gatorade.
In July 2001, the Coca-Cola Company launched a new formula for Powerade including vitamins B3, B6 and B12, which play a role in energy metabolism.

In July 2002, the Coca-Cola Company started in Toogoolawah by updating the bottles of the standard Powerade (previous logo styling) to a new sport-grip bottle. The redesign came to North America in 2005.

In 2002, the Coca-Cola Company introduced Powerade Option to the United States, in response to Gatorade&#x27;s popular Propel. Option is a &quot;low Calorie sports drink&quot; that is colorless and sweetened with high fructose corn syrup, sucralose, and acesulfame potassium, to provide sugar-conscious consumers with another rehydration choice. Powerade Option took 36% of the Fitness Water category behind Propel&#x27;s 42%.

In 2007, Powerade Zero was released, a sports drink with electrolytes, which contains no sugar, no calories and no carbohydrates.

In 2007 Coca-Cola acquired Fuze Beverage, a leading energy drink company. 

In June 2009, the Coca-Cola Company bought Glacéau, owner of brands such as VitaminWater and SmartWater, for $4.1 billion, a price tag that signaled the company&#x27;s seriousness in pursuing growth of non-carbonated beverages. Since then, the company has also given its Glacéau management team control of its Powerade sports drink brand.

==Competition==
Powerade&#x27;s main competitor is Gatorade marketed by the Quaker Oats Company, a division of PepsiCo. Gatorade, which was branded at the University of Florida in 1965, was the first commercially available sports drink in the United States. It now holds a commanding share of the market. As of 2011, Gatorade held a 70% market share compared to Powerade&#x27;s 28.5%.

All Sport is a competitor marketed by All Sport, Inc. and distributed by Jel Sert. All Sport was marketed by PepsiCo until 2001, when Gatorade&#x27;s maker, the Quaker Oats Company was acquired by PepsiCo. All Sport was sold to the Monarch Beverage Company soon after. Powerade and All Sport have each been distributed through their own direct store deliver channels. It was subsequently purchased by Gary Smith, the Chairman &amp; CEO of All Sport, Inc. of Austin, Texas.

Outside the United States, the Lucozade energy drink (manufactured since 1927 by the pharmaceutical company now known as GlaxoSmithKline) competes with Powerade. Lucozade&#x27;s formulation differs in that it uses primarily glucose and contains caffeine. The more direct competitor to Powerade and Gatorade is Lucozade Sport.

==Sponsorships==

*Powerade is the official sports drink of the Australian rugby league team and the Australian union team, the Australian Football League, PGA Tour, NASCAR (2003–present), NHRA, NCAA, the U.S. Olympic Team (excluding U.S.A. Basketball and U.S. Soccer, which have deals with Gatorade) and many other national Olympic federations, The Football League and many other soccer leagues and teams around the world, FIFA, such as Rangers F.C, Club Universidad de Chile, Club Bolívar, Associação Atlética Ponte Preta, Racing Club de Avellaneda, Independiente de Avellaneda, O&#x27;Higgins, Universitario de Sucre, Club Atlético River Plate, Club Cerro Porteño or Club Atlético Peñarol and the IOC in no small part due to their overall contracts with Coca-Cola. Various other competitions also have sponsorship deals with the brand, although Gatorade historically has secured the majority of sponsorships. The drink is also Sponsor of the Honduran Soccer Team C.D. Olimpia.
*Powerade is the Official Hydration Partner of Melbourne Storm.
*The brand is also the exclusive beverage sponsor of the Hoops in the Sun basketball summer league, based at Orchard Beach in the Bronx, New York. It is the only summer basketball league to be sponsored by the brand.

==Criticism==
Like its main competitor, Gatorade, Powerade is made with sugar, syrups, and salt.
One Powerade ad campaign stated that Powerade&#x27;s ION4 is superior to Gatorade, as the claims made by Pepsi, the parent owner of Gatorade, were apparently deceptive and false. The courts ruled in favor of Powerade as of August 2009.

Being high in sugar, Powerade may contribute to diabetes and weight gain if combined with other sugar sources.

<doc id="1040913" wikidata="Q1165470" url="?curid=1040913" title="Luna Park Sydney">
<text>Luna Park Sydney is a heritage-listed amusement park located at 1 Olympic Drive, Milsons Point, New South Wales, Australia, on the northern shore of Sydney Harbour. The amusement park is owned by the Luna Park Reserve Trust, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It is one of Sydney&#x27;s most famous landmarks and has had a significant impact on culture through the years, including being featured as a filming location for several movies and television shows.

It is protected by government legislation, namely the &quot;Luna Park Site&quot; Act 1990 which specifically protects the site and sets it aside for the purpose of an amusement park. Several of the buildings on the site are also listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate and the New South Wales State Heritage Register.

The park was constructed during 1935, approximately from the northern approaches of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It was an extremely popular attraction during World War II and the post-war period. The park suddenly closed in mid-1979 after the Ghost Train fire which killed six children and one adult. Most of the park was demolished and a new one was constructed, which operated for a brief time as Harbourside Amusement Park before the name was reverted. The park was closed again in 1988 as an independent engineering inspection determined that several rides needed urgent repair. The owners failed to repair and reopen the park before a Government of New South Wales deadline, and ownership was passed to a new body.

The park reopened in 1995, but closed yet again within thirteen months due to noise complaints about the Big Dipper rollercoaster from local residents, which led to reduced hours and a drop in attendance that made the park unsustainable to run. Luna Park opened only sporadically for the next nine years, including for special charity events and as a filming location. After another redevelopment, it reopened in 2004 and has continued operating ever since.

== History ==
=== Pre-colonisation to 1830s: Establishment of Milsons Point ===
The Cammeraygal people are the traditional owners of the North Sydney area, having lived there for at least 5,000 years.

After the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, a block of land between Lavender Bay and Careening Cove was granted by colonial authorities to a private soldier named Robert Ryan. This land passed down via surveyor-general Charles Grimes to politician Robert Campbell by 1805, with James Milson later settling there in the 1820s.

In 1830, Jamaican ex-convict Billy Blue commenced the first ferry service across Sydney Harbour. By 1837, a regular wharf and waterman&#x27;s service was operating from the site now known as Milsons Point. A regular vehicular ferry was operating by 1860, joined by a tram line to North Sydney in 1886. The North Shore railway line opened in 1890, and was extended to Milsons Point in 1893.

===1915 to 1935: From New York to Glenelg===

The first Luna Park was opened at Coney Island, New York in 1903. The first Luna Park in Australia opened in , Melbourne in 1912, followed by Luna Park Glenelg in Adelaide in 1930.

From 1924 onwards, the future site of Luna Park Sydney was used extensively by Dorman Long to fabricate and assemble steel components for the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which officially opened in 1932. Once the bridge was completed, North Sydney Council opened up applications for tenders to develop the site.

At the same time, the owners of Luna Park Glenelg - Herman Phillips, his brothers and A. A. Abrahams - happened to be searching for a new location to establish the park due to difficulties with their local council and residents.

Phillips and his associates won the tender for the North Sydney site and began a 20-year lease on 11 September 1935, forming Luna Park (NSW) Limited. The rides from Glenelg were dismantled and transported to Sydney over a three-month period - an elaborate process undertaken by Stuart Brothers under the direction of David Atkins, Ted Hopkins and Arthur Barton. Construction of the park employed almost 1,000 engineers, structural workers, fitters, and artists. Architectural plans and drawings of the park from this era are held at the State Library of New South Wales.

There were noise complaints and protests from North Shore residents against the park&#x27;s construction as early as April 1935, before it had even opened. Members of a &quot;Parks and Playgrounds Movement&quot; were quoted as saying the park was the result of &quot;a deplorable lack of aesthetic taste&quot;, and akin to &quot;Coney Island under the Tower of London&quot; - as in, not worthy of proximity to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. These sorts of complaints would turn out to be a theme throughout the park&#x27;s history.

===1935 to 1969: Official opening and heyday===

On 4 October 1935, Luna Park Sydney was officially opened to immediate success. The park&#x27;s signature entrance face, designed by Rupert Browne, was placed between two Art Deco-style towers with spires imitating New York&#x27;s Chrysler Building. The Big Dipper roller coaster was an instantly popular attraction. After a successful opening season, the park closed down for the winter months so that rides and attractions could be overhauled and repainted, and new ones could be added. In 1936, the North Sydney Olympic Pool was also opened on an adjacent site.

During World War II, Luna Park was a magnet for servicemen, many of whom were either treating their girlfriends to a night out or looking to meet someone. The influx of servicemen also drew sex workers to the area and large-scale brawls were a common occurrence, usually between Australian home defence troops and American sailors on shore leave. As non-essential uses of electricity were curtailed in wartime, the park&#x27;s neon lights were disconnected and many ride facades were dimmed. The park&#x27;s external lights were also &#x27;browned out&#x27; in case of a Japanese sneak attack on Sydney.
In 1950, the Phillips brothers were bought out by Atkins &amp; Hopkins. Numerous changes and additions were made over the next few years, as the two men travelled the world to bring back new concepts from amusement parks in the Netherlands, the United States, Germany and Britain. A version of The Rotor - a spinning drum that uses centrifugal force to pin guests to the sides, developed by Professor Ernst Hoffmeister in Germany - was constructed and installed, and became the stage of many stunts. It remains in place today. Barton also redesigned and reconstructed the park&#x27;s entrance face, which had begun to sag and distort. The new design was based on illustrations of Old King Cole, and became the inspiration for all future variants.
Atkins&#x27; passing in 1957 saw Hopkins become the park&#x27;s manager. Meanwhile, the rise of television and car culture throughout the 1960s saw the park facing increased competition. Several initiatives were attempted to maintain public interest throughout this era, including the installation of the Wild Mouse roller coaster and the hiring of silhouette artist S. John Ross.

===1969 to 1979: New ownership and Martin Sharp involvement===

Hopkins retired in 1969 and sold the remaining six years of the park&#x27;s lease to World Trade Centre Pty Ltd. Winter closures were abandoned under this new management, meaning there was no opportunity to carry out regular maintenance works on the rides. Barton also retired in 1970, the last of the park&#x27;s original showmen.

Soon after this, the new owners applied to construct a $50 million international trade centre on the Luna Park site, consisting of seven high-rise buildings, of exhibition space, and a heliport. However, this plan was rejected by the Government of New South Wales. After a reshuffle within the consortium, the decision was made to continue operation as an amusement park.

Over the next few years, the new managers scrapped several of the old rides and replacing them with new, American-designed thrill rides. After consultation with Hanna-Barbera, Luna Park&#x27;s slogan was temporarily changed from &quot;Just for Fun&quot; to &quot;The Place Where Happiness Is&quot;. Another result of the consultation was the creation of a short-lived park mascot, &quot;Luna Bear - the Space Age Koala.&quot;

In 1973, Martin Sharp and Peter Kingston undertook repainting works on the park in a pop art style. The face was repainted with a new expression and a clown-like mask, offset by strong primary colours. Sharp would turn out to play a major role in the park&#x27;s history in the decades to come.

By 1975, Luna Park was operating on a week-to-week lease with plans to develop the Lavender Bay foreshores as a &quot;Tivoli Gardens&quot;. When the park&#x27;s lease expired that same year, the directors went into negotiation with the New South Wales government to renew it. However, when Neville Wran became Premier in 1976 the negotiations ground to a halt, and the park was allowed to continue operating.

In 1977, an exhibition was held at the Art Gallery of New South Wales entitled &quot;Fairground Arts and Novelties&quot;, highlighting many important aspects of Luna Park. Meanwhile, Sharp and Kingston, as well as Richard Liney and Garry Shead, were involved in many major redesigns and artwork installations throughout the park. Sharp was quoted as saying:

===1979: Big Dipper accident, Ghost Train fire, and closure===
On 16 April 1979, a steel runner came loose on the Big Dipper, halting one train and leading to a collision with another. Thirteen people were injured.

On 9 June 1979, the park&#x27;s Ghost Train burnt down during operation. The fire quickly destroyed the ride, although it was contained before spreading to the nearby Big Dipper and River Caves. Searches of the charred rubble revealed the bodies of seven people: John Godson and his two children, Damien and Craig, and four Waverley College students, Jonathan Billings, Richard Carroll, Michael Johnson, and Seamus Rahilly. The park was immediately shut down.

Sydney newspapers and the NSW Police reported at the time that the fire was caused by an electrical fault. A contemporaneous coronial inquest was unable to establish the cause of the fire, but concluded that Luna Park&#x27;s managers and operators had failed in their duty of care towards the park&#x27;s patrons. Investigations led by Sharp in future decades, backed up with the testimony of multiple eyewitnesses and several NSW police officers, would determine the blaze was in fact deliberately lit by associates of Abe Saffron in an attempt to gain control of the park site.

===1980 to 1990: Friends of Luna Park campaign and Harbourside ownership===

The NSW government called for tenders for the site&#x27;s development at the end of July 1979. and again in March 1980.

Meanwhile, a group named &quot;Friends of Luna Park&quot; was formed by impassioned community members. A &quot;Save Luna Park&quot; protest marched from the Opera House to the Face, followed by a free concert headlined by Mental As Anything. As a result, the Face was an item of national heritage by the National Trust of Australia and the rest of the park was given a &#x27;recorded&#x27; classification.

Australian Amusements Associates won the tender in September 1980, and took over administration of the site in early June 1981. Much of the original park was then either demolished or sold off, including the Big Dipper, Tumble Bug, Turkey Trot, Barrels of Fun and the River Caves. Later that year, the Luna Park Site Act was passed, meaning Luna Park Holdings had to vacate the site. Everything that remained - with the exception of the Face, Crystal Palace, and Coney Island - was bulldozed and burnt.

The park was then rebuilt by Australian Amusements, following design advice from Texas-based LARC International. It reopened as the &quot;Harbourside Amusement Park&quot; in April 1982. The change in name was caused by a dispute between the current and previous owners, preventing the use of the &quot;Luna Park&quot; name until August of that year.

Over the next six years, the Face was removed from over the entry gates on two occasions, the owners of Harbourside were involved in two disputes with the Department of Public Works and one director was the subject of an inquiry by the Corporate Affairs Commission. Reports from independent engineers were then presented stating that several rides in the park had to be shut down for &quot;renovations and repairs&quot;. The park closed again in 1988, and the entrance face was re-located to storage owned by the Powerhouse Museum.

Harbourside&#x27;s lease was then transferred to Luna Park Investments Pty Ltd. With a year, after no efforts had been made to repair and reopen Luna Park, and several submissions hade been made to replace most or all of the amusement park with high-rise apartment blocks and hotels, the New South Wales State Government issued an ultimatum to the company: open Luna Park by 1 June 1990, or lose the lease. Despite this ultimatum, Luna Park Investments did little to prepare the site. Rides were moved around, repainted, and renamed to give the appearance that the new owners were trying to make an effort. The directors kept putting forward excuses to try to gain an extension, even declaring a trade union ban on their own site.

Four days after the government ultimatum passed, the lease was terminated and the Luna Park Reserve Trust was established. Soon after this, the National Heritage Trust added several buildings on the site to its list of protected structures.

On 12 October 1990, the Luna Park Site Act 1990 was gazetted, although the act had been used prior to this to terminate Harbourside&#x27;s lease and establish the Luna Park Reserve Trust. The Act was intended to protect the site of the park, dedicating it for amusement and public recreation.

===1991 to 1995: Reconstruction===
In 1991, the first two stages of the three-stage redevelopment and restoration plan for Luna Park was given the green light, with $25 million granted by the Open Space and Heritage Fund towards the project. The third stage, involving the demolition of sections of the old North Shore railway line (which had been in use as a holding area for trains outside peak hour since 1932), construction of parkland, an amphitheatre, art gallery, and museum, was not approved.

In 1992, the Trust commissioned Godden Mackay heritage consultants to prepare a Conservation Plan for the site. The plans were approved by North Sydney Council in August 1992, with Ted Hopkins also supporting the plans shown to him. Work began in January 1993, with the Face being moved back to its place over the entry gate. An &#x27;army&#x27; of tradesmen and artists worked for six months on the restoration of the park&#x27;s buildings, and on the repair of numerous artworks, including several of Barton&#x27;s murals.

During the reconstruction, there was vocal opposition from a number of nearby residents and companies,on a variety of issues. The main points of opposition were the noise levels of the park after opening, and the installation of a tall steel roller coaster to be named the Big Dipper after the original. The Environmental Protection Authority approved the construction of the new Big Dipper on the condition that the Trust abided by strict noise control guidelines and covered the cost of soundproofing for any residents affected by excessive noise. In addition, North Sydney Council imposed a series of times when the roller coaster could not operate.

===1995 to 2001: Brief reopening, closure and redevelopment===
Luna Park reopened in January 1995. In the months that followed, the park was affected by poor weather conditions, causing lower than predicted attendance. Legal claims against the operation of the park and roller coaster were filed by some local residents and supported by business figures whose tenders for the redevelopment had not been accepted. The newly elected Carr government put the park&#x27;s long-term viability in doubt; first removing the government guarantee of a $14 million loan to the trust, then dissolving the trust&#x27;s board of directors and appointing an administrator. The park was forced to close again on 14 February 1996.

In 1997 the Department of Land &amp; Water Conservation (DLWC) engaged the Urban Design Advisory Service (UDAS) to investigate urban design and land use options for the future use of Luna Park. The Luna Park Plan of Management was prepared by the New South Wales government in 1998 to guide the future management of the Luna Park Reserve. This plan identified a preferred option for Luna Park&#x27;s future use, determined in consultation with residents, the general public and other stakeholders. It sought to preserve Luna Park&#x27;s amusement park character while introducing new uses to improve its viability and accordance with the parameters in the Luna Park Site Amendment Act 1997. There was also grassroots community support for the park&#x27;s reopening; one example of this was the collection of a 5,000 signature petition by a pair of high school students.

In June 1997, the New South Wales government presented four development proposals to the public. After a month of public viewing and comment, a &#x27;diverse-use&#x27; plan, encompassing rides and amusements, restaurants, cafés, and function capacity was announced as the winning plan. In February 1998, the NSW Department of Public Works and Services called for proposals to redevelop Luna Park, and 20 proposals were submitted, with eight selected for further consideration.

In July 1999, the results of the tendering process were made public. Metro Edgley Group (consisting of Metro Edgley, Multiplex Facilities Management, and a group of private investors) was awarded the tender. Their proposal intended for most of the rides to stay, but called for the Big Dipper to be replaced with a multipurpose concert venue, and asked to redevelop the Crystal Palace as a function centre.

A Master Plan for the site was prepared in 1999, which included a Heritage Report prepared by Godden Mackay Logan. Further consultation with North Sydney Council brought the development to a standstill, with the Council and the directors of Metro Edgley clashing over several aspects of the proposed redevelopment. In January 2002 the Minister for Planning approved a development application for the site. On top of this, specific applications had to be lodged for each element of the plan, each of which in turn would require community consultation. The development eventually began in 2003.

During the long decision-making and approval process, Luna Park was permitted to operate for several charity-organised events, including for Variety Club and the Spastic Centre. The park was also allowed to operate on selected weekends and school holidays in late 2000 and early 2001, under strict, court-appointed conditions. In July 2001, the Big Dipper rollercoaster (installed in 1995) was sold to Dreamworld in Queensland.

===2004 to 2020: Reopening, legal action, heritage listing and further redevelopment===
The redevelopment and restoration of the park was conducted over a 14-month period between 2003 and 2004. The rides were removed, restored, and in some cases upgraded to comply with modern safety standards. The Crystal Palace was redesigned with several modular function rooms, the largest of which took up the entire lower floor.A 2,000 seat multipurpose auditorium, the Big Top, was constructed.

On 4 April 2004, the park reopened once again and has remained open ever since. Despite rain and low temperatures, several thousand people attended the opening day, and an accumulated attendance figure of 200,000 was reached within two months.

Legal action against the park by a group of seven Milsons Point residents and one developer began again in April 2005. The claim was of noise nuisance from the amusement rides, particularly those in Maloney&#x27;s Corner. The case was defeated when legislation was passed by the New South Wales government protecting Luna Park from such claims, although it was later revealed that these laws may have been influenced by court documents leaked to then-Tourism, Sport, and Recreation minister Sandra Nori by two Luna Park executives. The executives were charged with contempt of court in August 2007.

A new case began in June 2007, with the residents instead claiming breaches of the Trade Practices Act. Stating that they had been misled as to the types of amusement ride that were located in the Maloney&#x27;s Corner area, the residents and developer attempted to claim over $20 million in damages, and demanded the relocation or permanent closure of the Ranger and Spider rides. The case was dismissed by the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 6 February 2009, with the supervising Justice ruling that the development applications submitted by the park had not been &quot;misleading or deceptive&quot;, as claimed.

On 1 January 2007, a staff member working on the Golden Way Amusements-owned Speed (hired for the Christmas holidays) was struck in the head by the armature while the ride was in motion. The employee was taken to hospital and placed in intensive care.

In October 2007, Multiplex announced that it was intending to sell the lease to one of the undeveloped sections of Luna Park. The section of land, advertised for approximately $7 million, had initially been leased from the NSW Government for $1, on the condition that any profit made from property built on the site was invested in the amusement park. There were concerns that the money will be used to allow Multiplex to recoup the financial outlay made when redeveloping the park, instead of going towards the ongoing operation and maintenance of Luna Park&#x27;s facilities.

In February 2010, the Park was placed on the NSW State Heritage Register.

In late 2011, the NSW government allocated $78,000 in the state budget for upgrades of the park&#x27;s lighting to LEDs, along with repairs to the park&#x27;s buildings.

===2020 to present: COVID-19 era===

On 19 March 2020, Luna Park confirmed that the park would be closed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The park reopened on 3 July with the implementation of additional safety measures, including regular cleaning between rides, limits on the number of visitors per ride and health checks upon arrival.

The park closed again in January 2021, and nine new rides were built including three roller coasters; one a Gerstlauer family shuttle coaster called Boomerang, and another a coaster designed for children called Little Nipper. These were supposed to open on 26 June, but was delayed until 22 October due again to the COVID pandemic and resulting lockdowns. The third coaster is an Intamin Hot Racer that is Australia&#x27;s first single-rail coaster, and is named Big Dipper after the coasters that operated before it. Big Dipper opened on December 26, 2021.

In March 2023, the park held a reunion of the Friends of Luna Park activist group at Coney Island. A plaque was unveiled to commemorate their efforts, and particularly Sharp&#x27;s, in saving the park from development. In June 2024 Luna Park&#x27;s lease that runs until 2044, was sold by Brookfield to Oscars Group.

==Park layout==

===Park entrance===
The iconic 9-metre wide (30 ft) smiling face, as well as its Art Deco towers, have presided over the main entrance for almost all of the park&#x27;s existence. The idea was based on the large smiling faces at Luna Park, Melbourne, Australia, and Steeplechase Park in the United States.

There have been eight distinct faces, installed in 1935, 1938, 1947, 1958, 1960, 1973, 1982, and 1995. The seventh face was donated to the Powerhouse Museum in May 1994. The eighth and current face was created by Australian sculpture company Natureworks. It was built in 1993 from heavy duty fiberglass and installed in 1995. The design is based on Arthur Barton&#x27;s 1960 &quot;Old King Cole&quot; face.

===Midway===
Stretching from the Face to Coney Island, the Midway has always been the main thoroughfare of Luna Park. The Midway is the focus of many activities and amusements, and provides access to the Crystal Palace, Big Top, and Coney Island, along with the majority of Luna Park&#x27;s permanent rides.

===The Rotor===
The Rotor was designed by German engineer Ernst Hoffmeister in the late 1940s. The Rotor is a large, upright barrel, rotated at 30 revolutions per minute. The rotation of the barrel creates a centrifugal force equivalent to between 1 and 1.5 g. Once the barrel has attained full speed, the floor is retracted, leaving the riders stuck to the wall of the drum. At the end of the ride cycle, the drum slows down and gravity takes over. The riders slide down the wall slowly. Although Hoffmeister was the designer, most Rotors were constructed under licence. The first Luna Park Rotor was built by Ted Hopkins in 1951. Three Rotors were built in Australia based on Hoffmeister&#x27;s design. All had been demolished or destroyed by the 1980s, although a slightly redesigned Rotor was rebuilt for Luna Park Sydney in 1995, which is still in operation.

===Crystal Palace===
Beginning life in 1935 as a dodgem hall and office space, the Crystal Palace has seen many uses over the park&#x27;s history, including as a dance hall, a BMX track, a games arcade, and a restaurant and bar. The essential form of the Crystal Palace is a large rectangular thirteen-bay steel-framed structure, two storeys in height with a hip roof behind extended walls. The end bays are framed with heavy Oregon members and the roof ends above them are gabled hips with louvered ventilation in the gables. The exteriors were originally symmetrical, the two long elevations having emphatic central elements and end pavilions. Parapets conceal the main roof; these are crenulated except for the tower motifs where chamfered blocks of timber, imitating machicolation, have been planted on. The cladding, once predominantly asbestos cement, has been replaced in the early 1990s works with fibre-cement. The centre of the east or Midway entrance elevation has a steep hipped roof between tall pinnacles, while the four &quot;towers&quot; of the end pavilions have steep pyramid roofs.

Since the 2004 reopening, Crystal Palace has been host to four of the seven rooms used by Luna Park&#x27;s functions business. The main room stretches across the entire lower floor of Crystal Palace, and is often used for wedding receptions and other large social functions. The Midway-facing exterior of the building is host to numerous sideshow games, such as the Laughing Clowns, Crazy Crooners, and Goin Fishin&#x27;.

===Big Top===

Constructed during the 2003 redevelopment on the site of the Ghost Train, the Big Top (originally to be named the &quot;Luna Circus&quot;) is a fully licensed, multi-purpose venue capable of seating 2,000 people (this capacity can increase to 3,000 for standing-only concerts). The modular design of the stage and seating allows the entire venue to be easily reconfigured for different event types, and the concrete building is heavily soundproofed to cut down on noise pollution. Examples of events run in the Big Top include concerts (including shows from Kylie Minogue&#x27;s Anti Tour and the annual Come Together Music Festival), award shows and presentations (like the inaugural MTV Australia Video Music Awards or the live finals for the 2005–2008 seasons of &quot;Australia&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;), sporting tournaments (like the Australia Mixed Martial Arts Cage Fighting Championship and the 2013 Sydney Darts Masters), trade shows, and other large events.

===Coney Island===
First constructed in 1935, Coney Island - Funnyland is the only operating example of a 1930s funhouse left in the world. Although some changes have been made over the years, the layout is almost identical to when Luna Park opened in 1935. It is a rectangular building with the longest side running east–west. It has a corrugated iron hip roof with its external walls forming parapet walls around each side. The basic structure of Coney Island is virtually identical to that of the Crystal Palace. It is similar in width but slightly shorter, having twelve bays. Internally the steelwork of the main structure is concealed by mural panels or decorated motifs which were physically conserved during 1994. The roof purlins and sheeting are exposed. The industrial light fittings are suspended from the roof. The open space contains large and small fun devices, giant slides 1–4, joy wheel, turkey trot and barrels of fun.The design was based on funhouses in Europe and the United States, and contains rotating barrels, moving platforms, large slides, and arcade games. Today&#x27;s Coney Island is also host to the restored artworks of Arthur Barton, who started as one of 35 artists, along with photographs and memorabilia spanning Luna Park&#x27;s 85-year history. The slides and amusements are the same ones first used in 1935, but modified to meet modern safety standards. The amusements were saved from the 1981 demolition by the &#x27;Friends of Luna Park&#x27; action group, who purchased them for $9,200, on the condition that they remain in the heritage-listed building.

===Luna Land===
Originally named Maloney&#x27;s Corner, after Tony Maloney, a long-time Luna Park employee who started at 13 years old. Maloney&#x27;s Corner was built on land purchased from the New South Wales government and the State Rail Authority during the 1994 development, so that supports for the Big Dipper could be built, and a park, including a Ghost Train Fire Memorial. During the 2003 redevelopment, this area was paved over so the &quot;Ranger&quot;, &quot;Spider&quot; and various children&#x27;s rides could be relocated here from the Midway, to provide room for other developments. Around 2013, the Ranger was renamed to &quot;Moon Ranger.&quot; In late October 2020, the Spider and the Moon Ranger were removed. In November 2020, it was announced that the whole area would be cleared to make a new land called &quot;Luna Land&quot;, with 9 brand new rides. 3 being Roller Coasters, 1 being a Thrill Flat Ride, and the rest being Children&#x27;s Rides. The Park closed on January 26, 2021, and reopened with 8 new rides on October 22. These rides are: &quot;Boomerang&quot;, &quot;Bug&quot;, &quot;Cloud 9&quot;, &quot;Freaky Frogs&quot;, &quot;Little Nipper&quot;, &quot;Loopy Lighthouse&quot;, &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;, and &quot;Silly Sub&quot;. &quot;Big Dipper&quot; would open to the public on December 26, 2021.

<doc id="1040920" wikidata="Q306229" url="?curid=1040920" title="Sigma bond">
<text>In chemistry, sigma bonds (σ bonds) or sigma overlap are the strongest type of covalent chemical bond. They are formed by head-on overlapping between atomic orbitals along the internuclear axis. Sigma bonding is most simply defined for diatomic molecules using the language and tools of symmetry groups. In this formal approach, a σ-bond is symmetrical with respect to rotation about the bond axis. By this definition, common forms of sigma bonds are s+s, pz+pz, s+pz and dz2+dz2 (where z is defined as the axis of the bond or the internuclear axis).
Quantum theory also indicates that molecular orbitals (MO) of identical symmetry actually mix or &quot;hybridize&quot;. As a practical consequence of this mixing of diatomic molecules, the wavefunctions s+s and pz+pz molecular orbitals become blended. The extent of this mixing (or hybridization or blending) depends on the relative energies of the MOs of like symmetry.
For homodiatomics (homonuclear diatomic molecules), bonding σ orbitals have no nodal planes at which the wavefunction is zero, either between the bonded atoms or passing through the bonded atoms. The corresponding antibonding, or σ* orbital, is defined by the presence of one nodal plane between the two bonded atoms.

Sigma bonds are the strongest type of covalent bonds due to the direct overlap of orbitals, and the electrons in these bonds are sometimes referred to as sigma electrons.

The symbol σ is the Greek letter sigma. When viewed down the bond axis, a σ MO has a circular symmetry, hence resembling a similarly sounding &quot;s&quot; atomic orbital.

Typically, a single bond is a sigma bond while a multiple bond is composed of one sigma bond together with pi or other bonds. A double bond has one sigma plus one pi bond, and a triple bond has one sigma plus two pi bonds.

==Polyatomic molecules==
Sigma bonds are obtained by head-on overlapping of atomic orbitals. The concept of sigma bonding is extended to describe bonding interactions involving overlap of a single lobe of one orbital with a single lobe of another. For example, propane is described as consisting of ten sigma bonds, one each for the two C−C bonds and one each for the eight C−H bonds.

==Multiple-bonded complexes==
Transition metal complexes that feature multiple bonds, such as the dihydrogen complex, have sigma bonds between the multiple bonded atoms. These sigma bonds can be supplemented with other bonding interactions, such as π-back donation, as in the case of W(CO)3(PCy3)2(H2), and even δ-bonds, as in the case of chromium(II) acetate.

== Organic molecules ==
Organic molecules are often cyclic compounds containing one or more rings, such as benzene, and are often made up of many sigma bonds along with pi bonds. According to the sigma bond rule, the number of sigma bonds in a molecule is equivalent to the number of atoms plus the number of rings minus one.

:&quot;N&quot;σ = &quot;N&quot;atoms + &quot;N&quot;rings − 1

This rule is a special-case application of the Euler characteristic of the graph which represents the molecule.

A molecule with no rings can be represented as a tree with a number of bonds equal to the number of atoms minus one (as in dihydrogen, H2, with only one sigma bond, or ammonia, NH3, with 3 sigma bonds). There is no more than 1 sigma bond between any two atoms.

Molecules with rings have additional sigma bonds, such as benzene rings, which have 6 C−C sigma bonds within the ring for 6 carbon atoms. The anthracene molecule, C14H10, has three rings so that the rule gives the number of sigma bonds as 24 + 3 − 1 = 26. In this case there are 16 C−C sigma bonds and 10 C−H bonds.

This rule fails in the case of molecules which, when drawn flat on paper, have a different number of rings than the molecule actually has - for example, Buckminsterfullerene, C60, which has 32 rings, 60 atoms, and 90 sigma bonds, one for each pair of bonded atoms; however, 60 + 32 - 1 = 91, not 90. This is because the sigma rule is a special case of the Euler characteristic, where each ring is considered a face, each sigma bond is an edge, and each atom is a vertex. Ordinarily, one extra face is assigned to the space not inside any ring, but when Buckminsterfullerene is drawn flat without any crossings, one of the rings makes up the outer pentagon; the inside of that ring is the outside of the graph. This rule fails further when considering other shapes - toroidal fullerenes will obey the rule that the number of sigma bonds in a molecule is exactly the number of atoms plus the number of rings, as will nanotubes - which, when drawn flat as if looking through one from the end, will have a face in the middle, corresponding to the far end of the nanotube, which is not a ring, and a face corresponding to the outside.

<text>Van Rensselaer Potter II (12 November, 1911 – September 6, 2001) was an American biochemist, oncologist, and bioethicist. Born in northeast South Dakota, Potter was professor of oncology at the McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research at the University of Wisconsin–Madison for more than five decades.

Potter is known for coining the widely used term &quot;bioethics&quot; in 1970, however, German theologian Fritz Jahr had previously coined the term in the 1920s. Peter Whitehouse describes Potter&#x27;s formulation of bioethics as a &quot;wise integration of biology and values&quot;, which arose from his work as a cancer researcher and from the influence of faculty member Aldo Leopold at the University of Wisconsin.

Bioethics is linked to environmental ethics and is separate from biomedical ethics. Because of this confusion (and appropriation of the term in medicine), Potter chose to use the term &quot;global bioethics&quot; in 1988. He was an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, The president of the American Society of Cell Biology in 1965, and the president of the American Association for Cancer Research in 1974.

<text>Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda is a book by Lieutenant-General Roméo Dallaire of the Canadian Forces, with help from Major Brent Beardsley. It was first published by Random House Canada in September 2003.

The book chronicles Dallaire&#x27;s tour as Force Commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) in 1993–1994, during which he witnessed the 1994 Genocide Against Tutsi.

The book won the 2003 Shaughnessy Cohen Award for Political Writing, and 2004 Governor General&#x27;s Award for nonfiction.

The edition published in French is entitled &quot;J&#x27;ai serré la main du diable: La faillite de l&#x27;humanité au Rwanda&quot;.

The documentary film &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil: The Journey of Roméo Dallaire&quot; (2004) and a 2007 dramatic feature film are inspired by and in part based on the book. Dallaire was consulted in the making of both films.

==Summary==

More than 800,000 people are believed to have been killed in 100 days in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. Lt. Gen. Roméo Dallaire witnessed these massacres. In &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot;, he describes the dilemmas and atrocities to which he was exposed. 

In the book Dallaire explains how, after arriving in Kigali in August 1993, he warned the UN high authorities that he lacked sufficient equipment and manpower to carry out his mission. However, a lack of clarity in the UN&#x27;s intervention procedures coupled with the international community&#x27;s apparent lack of interest in Rwanda meant that Dallaire&#x27;s calls for help went unanswered.

From day to day the situation deteriorates until eventually the general&#x27;s forces are left on their own, without fuel, money or adequate equipment. Meanwhile, encouraged by the ethnic hate propaganda of the Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM), Hutu militiamen attack their Tutsi victims while an army of exiles begins a civil war, from the northern border of the country, to take power. In Kigali, corpses of civilians killed by machetes begin piling up and many of the moderate politicians with whom Dallaire had the mandate to negotiate are also murdered.

<text>The Peruvian Air Force (, FAP) is the branch of the Peruvian Armed Forces tasked with defending the nation and its interests through the use of air power. Additional missions include assistance in safeguarding internal security, conducting disaster relief operations and participating in international peacekeeping operations.

==History==

=== 20th century ===

On 20 May 1929, the aviation divisions of the Peruvian Army and Navy were merged into the (Peruvian Aviation Corps, abbreviated CAP). During the Colombia-Peru War of 1933, its Vought O2U Corsair and Curtiss F11C Hawk planes fought in the Amazon region. The CAP lost three aircraft to the Colombian Air Force. The corps was renamed (Peruvian Aeronautical Corps, also abbreviated CAP) on 12 March 1936.

====Ecuadorian–Peruvian War====
In 1941, the CAP participated in the Ecuadorian–Peruvian War. At that time, the CAP were equipped with Caproni Ca.114 and North American NA.50 fighters, Douglas DB-8A-3P attack aircraft, and Caproni Ca.135 and Caproni Ca.310 bombers, among others.

The Peruvian Air Force had also established a paratroop unit during the war and used it to great effect by seizing the strategic Ecuadorian port city of Puerto Bolívar, on 27 July 1941, marking the first time in the Americas that airborne troops were used in combat.

Lieutenant José Quiñones Gonzales was a Peruvian pilot during the war. 
On 23 July 1941, his plane, a North American NA-50 fighter, was hit while performing a low-level attack on an Ecuadorian border post on the banks of the Zarumilla river. According to traditional Peruvian accounts, Quiñones, upon being hit by ground fire, crashed his damaged aircraft deliberately into the Ecuadorian anti-aircraft position, destroying it. He was promoted posthumously to captain, and is today considered a National Hero of Peru.

In 1942, an aerial photography service was annexed to the air force.

====Cold War====
During the 1950s presidency of General Manuel A. Odría, the Peruvian Air Force was reorganized and on 18 July 1950, had its name changed to the (Air Force of Peru, or FAP). Peru was an ally of the United States during this period, and was predominantly equipped with aircraft built in the US and Great Britain. By the end of General Odria&#x27;s presidency, the FAP ushered in the Jet Age with the introduction of English Electric Canberra bombers and Hawker Hunter, Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star and North American F-86 Sabre fighters.

However, on 3 October 1968, a military junta led by pro-Soviet Peruvian Army General Juan Velasco Alvarado organized a swift and bloodless coup d&#x27;état against president Fernando Belaúnde Terry. Velasco aligned Peru more closely with the Soviet Bloc and relations with the United States deteriorated. The US declared an arms embargo in 1969, making it difficult to obtain spare parts for Peru&#x27;s American weaponry. In the 1970s and 1980s, Peru turned to the Soviet Union for its military hardware. During this time, the FAP acquired several Soviet-made aircraft, including Sukhoi Su-22 fighters, Antonov An-26 and An-32 transport aircraft, as well as Mil Mi-8, Mi-17, Mi-25 and Mi-26 helicopters. Soviet advisors were also dispatched to Peru.

Velasco was overthrown by other military officers in 1975 and Belaúnde returned to power as a civilian president in 1980. The FAP purchased the French-made Mirage 5P and 5DP and the Mirage 2000 in 1984. Relations improved with the United States and the FAP obtained American aircraft like the Cessna A-37B Dragonfly attack aircraft, as well as Lockheed C-130 and L-100-20 Hercules transport aircraft.

====Stagnation====

The stagnation of the Peruvian economy during the late 1980s and early 1990s forced cost reductions and the downsizing of the fleet size.
Budget cuts in training meant Peruvian pilots had a low number of annual flying hours (AFH) per pilot if compared to the 1970s. The number of annual flying hours is of course very important in estimating the individual skill and experience of the pilots of an air force: more annual flying hours suggests better trained pilots and general readiness.
There are also a number of possible explanations for FAP&#x27;s low AFH: concern over the aging of equipment, scarcity of spare parts – especially for the older aircraft – difficulties with worn airframes and the scarcity of fuel are all contributing factors. It is very likely however that some &#x27;elite&#x27; pilots and regiments such as those based in Talara AFB and La Joya AFB received considerably more flying hours. Especially since those regiments until today are equipped with modern aircraft and tasked with homeland defence.

====Cenepa War====
The Peruvian Air Force participated in the 1995 Cenepa War against Ecuador&#x27;s Air Force in the Amazon Basin. It provided aerial support to the Peruvian army, carrying out bombings with Mi-25 helicopters, Canberra bombers, A-37 and Su-22 aircraft. Due to a lack of reliable roads, troops were transported by Mi-17 helicopters, as well as L-100 Hercules, An-28 and An-32 aircraft. During the course of the war, at least two helicopters were shot down.

==== Fujimori government ====
In 1997 and 1998, the FAP&#x27;s outlook started to change for the better. In order to achieve president Alberto Fujimori&#x27;s militarily bold plans, it meant that FAP required a much-needed general overhaul and new purchases.

In 1997, the FAP acquired 21 MiG-29 fighters and 18 Su-25 attack fighters from Belarus. In 1998, an additional three MiG-29 fighters were bought from Russia, which, along with the 12 Mirage 2000 fighters purchased from France&#x27;s Dassault Aviation in 1984, made a total of 54 fighters in Peru&#x27;s inventory.

These purchases were expensive and a number of observers questioned their usefulness against more pressing security concerns at the time such as the Marxist guerillas, the Sendero Luminoso group (translated as Shining Path). On the other hand, the FAP still remembered the 1995 Cenepa War with Ecuador, and stationed its MiG-29s close to the border at Chiclayo AFB and Talara AFB.

=== 21st century ===
Peru&#x27;s Mirage 2000C/B and MiG-29S fighters form the backbone of its current multirole fighter fleet, alongside specialized Su-25 close air support jets. Its Mirage 2000Ps sit at La Joya AFB near the border with Bolivia and Chile; the 3 Andean countries have a minor 3-way maritime borders dispute, and residual tensions with historical foe Chile have been a long-running issue in Peru.

RAC MiG began the upgrade of FAP&#x27;s MiG fleet to the MiG-29SMT external link standard in 2008. In 2009, Dassault began working with Peru on a comprehensive inspection of the Mirage fleet, coupled with some electronics modernization.

Since 2013, Peru is in talks with European suppliers as part of a long-term plan of replacing FAP&#x27;s aging air force aircraft with second-hand Su-35s, Rafales or Eurofighters. Hitherto, FAP was exploring the possibility of buying as many as sixty Eurofighter Typhoon EF-2000 from Spain and sixty Sukhoi Su-35 from Russia. Cost was a major issue for Peruvian President Ollanta Humala, who was looking at competitively priced fighter jets that would fit the national budget. In 2014, Peru began to update the operations and mechanical equipment of its Cessna A-37 aircraft, replacing analog controls with new digital hardware. Peru has been evaluating multiple helicopters to modernize, replace previous utility helicopters and search and rescue operations with the Italian made, AW139. The purchase would consist of 12 helicopters for a total of $193 million.

Following the unveiling of the KAI KF-21 Boramae in April 2021, &quot;The National Interest&quot; reported that Peru may be a potential customer for the 4.5 generation fighter.

<text>G7 Welcoming Committee Records was a Canadian independent record label based in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The label mostly released material by artists and speakers with a radical left-wing point of view.

==History==
G7 Welcoming Committee Records was founded by Chris Hannah and Jord Samolesky of punk band, Propagandhi, and their friend, Regal, in 1997. The label operated out of Winnipeg&#x27;s The Old Market Autonomous Zone. During its years of operation about 50 albums were released.

The label ceased operations in April 2008 although it did briefly come out of hibernation in 2010 to release a 3-track EP of Propagandhi songs from 1993 to 1996 as a benefit for Partners In Health.

In early 2015, it was announced on the G7 website that none of their previous releases were available for purchase as either physical copies or downloadable albums, but that most of their catalog was available on music streaming sites.

==Political aspect==
According to the G7 website, when the label was established, the founders hoped &quot;to create a label that politically radical bands and speakers could unflinchingly support and call home; where the driving force behind the label&#x27;s output was social change and radical thought; and where the structure of the organization didn&#x27;t contradict itself by mimicking the structures of unbalanced power and hierarchy in the profit-driven corporate world.&quot; To this end the label incorporates the economic structure Parecon proposed by Robin Hahnel and Michael Albert.

The name is a reference to the G7 which brings together the world&#x27;s richest and most powerful countries in yearly summits to discuss the global political and economic society and to make collective decisions. The label&#x27;s website explains, &quot;The G7 Welcoming Committee is an idea of resistance [...] A &#x27;Welcoming Committee&#x27; to tell them, with words and actions, what we think of their power and neo-colonialism, around the world and at home, and that people are willing to fight back ...&quot;

==Associated bands==

<doc id="1040953" wikidata="Q2993367" url="?curid=1040953" title="Recuperator">
<text>A recuperator (electro- end carbogidro-) - is a special purpose counter-flow energy recovery heat exchanger positioned within the supply and exhaust air streams of an air handling system, or in the exhaust gases of an industrial process, in order to recover the waste heat. Generally, they are used to extract heat from the exhaust and use it to preheat air entering the combustion system. In this way they use waste energy to heat the air, offsetting some of the fuel, and thereby improve the energy efficiency of the system as a whole.

==Description==
In many types of processes, combustion is used to generate heat, and the recuperator serves to recuperate, or reclaim this heat, in order to reuse or recycle it. The term recuperator refers as well to liquid-liquid counterflow heat exchangers used for heat recovery in the chemical and refinery industries and in closed processes such as ammonia-water or LiBr-water absorption refrigeration cycle.

Recuperators are often used in association with the burner portion of a heat engine, to increase the overall efficiency. For example, in a gas turbine engine, air is compressed, mixed with fuel, which is then burned and used to drive a turbine. The recuperator transfers some of the waste heat in the exhaust to the compressed air, thus preheating it before entering the fuel burner stage. Since the gases have been pre-heated, less fuel is needed to heat the gases up to the turbine inlet temperature. By recovering some of the energy usually lost as waste heat, the recuperator can make a heat engine or gas turbine significantly more efficient.

==Energy transfer process==
Normally the heat transfer between airstreams provided by the device is termed as &quot;sensible heat&quot;, which is the exchange of energy, or enthalpy, resulting in a change in temperature of the medium (air in this case), but with no change in moisture content. However, if moisture or relative humidity levels in the return air stream are high enough to allow condensation to take place in the device, then this will cause &quot;latent heat&quot; to be released and the heat transfer material will be covered with a film of water. Despite a corresponding absorption of latent heat, as some of the water film is evaporated in the opposite airstream, the water will reduce the thermal resistance of the boundary layer of the heat exchanger material and thus improve the heat transfer coefficient of the device, and hence increase efficiency. The energy exchange of such devices now comprises both sensible and latent heat transfer; in addition to a change in temperature, there is also a change in moisture content of the exhaust air stream.

However, the film of condensation will also slightly increase pressure drop through the device, and depending upon the spacing of the matrix material, this can increase resistance by up to 30%. If the unit is not laid to falls, and the condensate not allowed to drain properly, this will increase fan energy consumption and reduce the seasonal efficiency of the device.

==Use in ventilation systems==
In heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, HVAC, recuperators are commonly used to re-use waste heat from exhaust air normally expelled to atmosphere. Devices typically comprises a series of parallel plates of aluminium, plastic, stainless steel, or synthetic fiber, copper alternate pairs of which are enclosed on two sides to form twin sets of ducts at right angles to each other, and which contain the supply and extract air streams. In this manner heat from the exhaust air stream is transferred through the separating plates, and into the supply air stream. Manufacturers claim gross efficiencies of up to 95% depending upon the specification of the unit. 

The characteristics of this device are attributable to the relationship between the physical size of the unit, in particular the air path distance, and the spacing of the plates. For an equal air pressure drop through the device, a small unit will have a narrower plate spacing and a lower air velocity than a larger unit, but both units may be just as efficient. Because of the cross-flow design of the unit, its physical size will dictate the air path length, and as this increases, heat transfer will increase but pressure drop will also increase, and so plate spacing is increased to reduce pressure drop, but this in turn will reduce heat transfer.

As a general rule a recuperator selected for a pressure drop of between will have a good efficiency, while having a small effect on fan power consumption, but will have in turn a higher seasonal efficiency than that for physically smaller, but higher pressure drop recuperator.

When heat recovery is not required, it is typical for the device to be bypassed by use of dampers arranged within the ventilation distribution system. Assuming the fans are fitted with inverter speed controls, set to maintain a constant pressure in the ventilation system, then the reduced pressure drop leads to a slowing of the fan motor and thus reducing power consumption, and in turn improves the seasonal efficiency of the system.

==Use in metallurgical furnaces==
Recuperators have also been used to recover heat from waste gasses to preheat combustion air and fuel for many years by metallic recuperators to reduce energy costs and carbon footprint of operation. Compared to alternatives such as regenerative furnaces, initial costs are lesser, there are no valves to be switching back and forth, there are no induced-draft fans and it does not require a web of gas ducts spread up all over the furnace.

Historically the recovery ratios of recuperators compared to regenerative burners were low. However, recent improvements to technology have allowed recuperators to recover 70-80% of the waste heat and pre-heated air up to is now possible.

==Gas turbines==
Recuperators can be used to increase the efficiency of gas turbines for power generation, provided the exhaust gas is hotter than the compressor outlet temperature. The exhaust heat from the turbine is used to pre-heat the air from the compressor before further heating in the combustor, reducing the fuel input required. The larger the temperature difference between turbine out and compressor out, the greater the benefit from the recuperator. Therefore, microturbines (&lt;1 MW), which typically have low pressure ratios, have the most to gain from the use of a recuperator. In practice, a doubling of efficiency is possible through the use of a recuperator. The major practical challenge for a recuperator in microturbine applications is coping with the exhaust gas temperature, which can exceed .

<text>Epidosite () is a highly altered epidote and quartz bearing rock. It is the result of slow hydrothermal alteration or metasomatism of the basaltic sheeted dike complex and associated plagiogranites that occurs below the massive sulfide ore deposits which occur in ophiolites. Most epidosites represent the zone of intense metal leaching below and lateral to the sulfide deposits which is the result of convection of heated ocean water through the fractured basalts of the sheeted dikes.

<text>Derek James Clayton (born 17 November 1942) is a former Australian long-distance runner, born in Cumbria, England and raised in Northern Ireland.

Clayton set a marathon world best in the Fukuoka Marathon, Japan on 3 December 1967 in 2:09:36.4, in what is considered a classic race, the first marathon race ever run in less than two hours and ten minutes.

He went on to break this time at the Antwerp Marathon on 30 May 1969 by more than a minute; this time stood as the world best for nearly another 12 years. His personal best time of 2:08:33.6 is still a world-class marathon time. Clayton represented Australia at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, finishing in 7th place (2:27:23). Four years later he finished in 13th place (2:19:49) in the same event.

At the 1971 Australian Athletics Championships, he won the marathon in 2:11:08.8. Two years later, in 1973, he won the Australian Athletics Championships marathon again in 2:12:07.6. He also won the marathon in this event in 1967 and 1968. Clayton won 14 marathons in his career.

Clayton was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1999.

<doc id="1040970" wikidata="Q5160088" url="?curid=1040970" title="Confidence region">
<text>In statistics, a confidence region is a multi-dimensional generalization of a confidence interval. For a bivariate normal distribution, it is an ellipse, also known as the error ellipse. More generally, it is a set of points in an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space, often represented as a hyperellipsoid around a point which is an estimated solution to a problem, although other shapes can occur.

==Interpretation==

The confidence region is calculated in such a way that if a set of measurements were repeated many times and a confidence region calculated in the same way on each set of measurements, then a certain percentage of the time (e.g. 95%) the confidence region would include the point representing the &quot;true&quot; values of the set of variables being estimated. However, unless certain assumptions about prior probabilities are made, it does not mean, when one confidence region has been calculated, that there is a 95% probability that the &quot;true&quot; values lie inside the region, since we do not assume any particular probability distribution of the &quot;true&quot; values and we may or may not have other information about where they are likely to lie.

==The case of independent, identically normally-distributed errors==

Suppose we have found a solution formula_1 to the following overdetermined problem:
:formula_2

where Y is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional column vector containing observed values of the dependent variable, X is an &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;p&quot; matrix of observed values of independent variables (which can represent a physical model) which is assumed to be known exactly, formula_1 is a column vector containing the &quot;p&quot; parameters which are to be estimated, and formula_4 is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional column vector of errors which are assumed to be independently distributed with normal distributions with zero mean and each having the same unknown variance formula_5.

A joint 100(1 − &quot;α&quot;) % confidence region for the elements of formula_1 is represented by the set of values of the vector b which satisfy the following inequality:

:formula_7

where the variable b represents any point in the confidence region, &quot;p&quot; is the number of parameters, i.e. number of elements of the vector formula_8 formula_9 is the vector of estimated parameters, and &quot;s&quot;2 is the reduced chi-squared, an unbiased estimate of formula_5 equal to

:formula_11

Further, &quot;F&quot; is the quantile function of the F-distribution, with &quot;p&quot; and formula_12 degrees of freedom, formula_13 is the statistical significance level, and the symbol formula_14 means the transpose of formula_15.

The expression can be rewritten as:

:formula_16

where formula_17 is the least-squares scaled covariance matrix of formula_9.

The above inequality defines an ellipsoidal region in the &quot;p&quot;-dimensional Cartesian parameter space R&quot;p&quot;. The centre of the ellipsoid is at the estimate formula_9. According to Press et al., it is easier to plot the ellipsoid after doing singular value decomposition. The lengths of the axes of the ellipsoid are proportional to the reciprocals of the values on the diagonals of the diagonal matrix, and the directions of these axes are given by the rows of the 3rd matrix of the decomposition.

==Weighted and generalised least squares==

Now consider the more general case where some distinct elements of formula_4 have known nonzero covariance (in other words, the errors in the observations are not independently distributed), and/or the standard deviations of the errors are not all equal. Suppose the covariance matrix of formula_4 is formula_22, where V is an &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; nonsingular matrix which was equal to formula_23 in the more specific case handled in the previous section, (where I is the identity matrix,) but here is allowed to have nonzero off-diagonal elements representing the covariance of pairs of individual observations, as well as not necessarily having all the diagonal elements equal.

It is possible to find a nonsingular symmetric matrix P such that

:formula_24

In effect, P is a square root of the covariance matrix V.

The least-squares problem

:formula_2

can then be transformed by left-multiplying each term by the inverse of P, forming the new problem formulation
:formula_26

where

:formula_27
: formula_28 and
:formula_29

A joint confidence region for the parameters, i.e. for the elements of formula_1, is then bounded by the ellipsoid given by:

:formula_31

Here &quot;F&quot; represents the percentage point of the &quot;F&quot;-distribution and the quantities &quot;p&quot; and &quot;n-p&quot; are the degrees of freedom which are the parameters of this distribution.

==Nonlinear problems==

Confidence regions can be defined for any probability distribution. The experimenter can choose the significance level and the shape of the region, and then the size of the region is determined by the probability distribution. A natural choice is to use as a boundary a set of points with constant formula_32 (chi-squared) values.

One approach is to use a linear approximation to the nonlinear model, which may be a close approximation in the vicinity of the solution, and then apply the analysis for a linear problem to find an approximate confidence region. This may be a reasonable approach if the confidence region is not very large and the second derivatives of the model are also not very large.

Bootstrapping approaches can also be used.

<doc id="1040971" wikidata="Q4955242" url="?curid=1040971" title="Brady disclosure">
<text>In the legal system of the United States, a &quot;Brady&quot; disclosure consists of exculpatory or impeaching information and evidence that is material to the guilt or innocence or to the punishment of a defendant. The term comes from the 1963 U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Brady v. Maryland&quot;, in which the Supreme Court ruled that suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to a defendant who has requested it violates due process.

Following &quot;Brady&quot;, the prosecutor must disclose evidence or information that would prove the innocence of the defendant or would enable the defense to more effectively impeach the credibility of government witnesses. Evidence that would serve to reduce the defendant&#x27;s sentence must also be disclosed by the prosecution. In practice, this doctrine has often proved difficult to enforce. Some states have established their own laws to try to strengthen enforcement against prosecutorial misconduct in this area.

==Definition of the &quot;Brady&quot; rule==
The &quot;Brady&quot; doctrine is a pretrial discovery rule that was established by the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Brady v. Maryland&quot; (1963). The rule requires that the prosecution must turn over all exculpatory evidence to the defendant in a criminal case. Exculpatory evidence is evidence that might exonerate the defendant.

==Examples==
Examples include the following:
* The prosecutor must disclose an agreement not to prosecute a witness in exchange for the witness&#x27;s testimony.
* The prosecutor must disclose leniency (or preferential treatment) agreements made with witnesses in exchange for testimony.
* The prosecutor must disclose exculpatory evidence known only to the police. That is, the prosecutor has a duty to reach out to the police and establish regular procedures by which the police inform the prosecutor&#x27;s office of anything that tends to prove the innocence of the defendant. Not all exculpatory evidence is required to be disclosed by Brady and its progeny; only evidence that is &quot;material to guilt or punishment&quot; must be disclosed because its disclosure would create a reasonable probability of changing the outcome of the proceeding. The prosecutor is not obligated to &quot;personally&quot; review police files in search of exculpatory information when the defendant asks for it, but to allow the defense reasonable access. The Supreme Court observed in &quot;Strickler v. Greene&quot;, &quot;Thus the term &#x27;Brady violation&#x27; is sometimes used to refer to any breach of the broad obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence – that is, to any suppression of so-called &#x27;Brady material&#x27; – although strictly speaking, there is never a real &#x27;Brady violation&#x27; unless the nondisclosure was so serious that there is a reasonable probability that the suppressed evidence would have produced a different verdict.&quot;
* The prosecutor must disclose arrest photographs of the defendant when those photos do not match the victim&#x27;s description.
* Some state systems have expansively defined Brady material to include many other items, including for example any documents which might reflect negatively on a witness&#x27;s credibility.
* Police officers who have been dishonest are sometimes referred to as &quot;Brady cops.&quot; Because of the Brady ruling, prosecutors are required to notify defendants and their attorneys whenever a law enforcement official involved in their case has a sustained record for knowingly lying in an official capacity. Lists of such officers are known as &quot;Brady lists&quot;. The growing use of Brady, both in the federal and state sectors, is one of the most important changes affecting police officers&#x27; employment.

==Procedures for compliance==
* In order to ensure compliance with &quot;Brady&quot;, the United States Supreme Court repeatedly urged the &quot;careful prosecutor&quot; to favor disclosure over concealment. Conformity with &quot;Brady&quot; is a continuing obligation of prosecutors. Some prosecuting attorney offices have adopted and created specialized procedure and bureaus to meet their burden.
* &quot;Pitchess v. Superior Court&quot; is the source for a &quot;Pitchess motion&quot; in California. Such a motion can be made by a criminal defendant to discover complaints made against a police officer, and the investigation of those complaints, such that they are contained in the officer&#x27;s personnel records. The motions can be made in a California Superior Court under California Evidence Code 1043–1046. Notwithstanding, because of the broad nature of the discovery that the associated court rule and statute provide, getting actual records can be complicated. In California, there is a carefully prescribed procedure governing such request, and making disclosure without an order is a crime. The statutory scheme was developed, in part, because law enforcement departments had developed a practice of purging their files concerning misconduct claims made against their officers.

==Applicability to plea bargains==

, federal appeals courts are split as to whether defendants have the right to receive materially exculpatory evidence before making a plea bargain, which is how the vast majority of convictions are now obtained. The Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits assert that they do; the First, Second, Fourth, and Fifth Circuits assert that they do not.

State &quot;open file&quot; laws like the Michael Morton Act in Texas allow defendants to see all prosecution evidence at every stage of prosecution, including the plea bargain stage.

<doc id="1040972" wikidata="Q984438" url="?curid=1040972" title="Nino Castelnuovo">
<text>Francesco &quot;Nino&quot; Castelnuovo (28 October 1936 – 6 September 2021) was an Italian actor of film, stage and television, best known for his starring role as Guy Foucher in the French musical film &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot; (1964).

Castelnuovo&#x27;s other films include &quot;Rocco and His Brothers&quot; (1960), &quot;Camille 2000&quot; (1969), &quot;L&#x27;emmerdeur&quot; (1973), &quot;Il prato macchiato di rosso&quot; (1973), &quot;Massacre Time&quot; (1966), &quot;The Five Man Army&quot; (1969), and &quot;The English Patient&quot; (1996).

== Early life ==
Castelnuovo was born the youngest of three boys in Lecco, Lombardy as the son of maid Emilia Paola (née Sala) and button factory employee Camillo Castelnuovo. He had two older brothers, Pierantonio (b. 1930; d. 1976) and Clemente. After being a house painter, a mechanic and a workman, he moved to Milan, where he started working as a sales agent, and at the same time, he enrolled in the acting school of the Piccolo Teatro in Milan. He became a father for the first time to his son Lorenzo when he married Danila Trebbi (b. 1955), an Italian actress.

== Career ==
In 1957, Castelnuovo debuted as a mime in the RAI children&#x27;s television show &quot;Zurli il mago del giovedì&quot;. 

He landed a small part in &quot;Un maledetto imbroglio&quot; (&quot;The Facts of Murder&quot;, 1959), directed by Pietro Germi, and played supporting roles in films, including &quot;The Hunchback of Rome&quot;, directed by Carlo Lizzani, and &quot;Rocco and His Brothers&quot;, directed by Luchino Visconti; both were released in 1960.

When the American television show &quot;Disneyland&quot; travelled to Italy in 1962, he appeared with Annette Funicello in two episodes of the mini-movie, &quot;Escapade in Florence&quot;, singing, playing the guitar, and adding the Italian verses to the jovial tarantella &quot;Dream Boy&quot;.

Castelnuovo&#x27;s breakthrough role arrived with &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot; (1964), directed by Jacques Demy, in which he played opposite Catherine Deneuve. Nominated for the American Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, the film gained the attention of both film critics and the public, and won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival in February of the same year.
After the box-office failures &quot;Un mondo nuovo&quot; (1966), directed by Vittorio De Sica, and &quot;The Reward&quot;, directed by Serge Bourguignon, he gained notice as an actor in Italy because of his role of Renzo in the television mini-series &quot;I promessi sposi&quot; (1967). 

He also starred alongside an international cast in &quot;The Five Man Army&quot; (1969), directed by Don Taylor, as a Mexican revolutionary, and as Armand in &quot;Camille 2000&quot; (1969), directed by Radley Metzger.

From then on, Castelnuovo was featured primarily on television serials around Europe, where he portrayed numerous parts. He appeared as the athletically sound spokesman for the corn oil company Cuore from 1977 to 1982. 

Castelnuovo also appeared briefly as D&#x27;Agostino in &quot;The English Patient&quot; (1996), and he continued to be active on the Italian theatre stage. In 2002, he starred in a production of the 1931 comedy play &quot;The Front Page&quot; (Italian title, &quot;Prima Pagina&quot;).

He appeared as Kenny Butler in the 2016 &quot;The Legacy Run&quot; with sport personalities Daniela Scalia, Luca Tramontin, Marco Baron, Flavien Conne, Ivan Asic, and Stefania Bianchini.

==Death==
Castelnuovo died on 6 September 2021 in Rome at the age of 84.

<text>A Wells notice is a letter that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sends to people or firms at the conclusion of an SEC investigation that states the SEC is planning to bring an enforcement action against them. The notice informs the people or the firm in question that the SEC has concluded that they should be charged with violation of the securities laws. The notice indicates that the SEC staff has determined it may bring a civil action against a person or firm, and provides the person or firm with the opportunity to provide information as to why the enforcement action should not be brought. The person or firm is generally given 30 days to file this response in the form of a legal brief considering legal and factual arguments as to why no charges should be brought against them. Although investigation is conducted on a confidential basis, this notice, as well as its response, is public information that can be used in later public hearings among other things.

Regulators are not legally required to provide a notice; however, it is the practice of the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to provide such notice. In addition, 80% of people who were sent a Wells notice from 2011 to 2013 ended up facing charges for allegedly violating securities law.

The name &quot;Wells notice&quot; is derived from the Wells Committee of the SEC which proposed this process in 1972. This SEC committee was named after John A. Wells, its chair. The other members of the committee were former SEC Chairmen Manuel F. Cohen and Ralph Demmler.

Among the recommendations made by the committee was the following:

Except where the nature of the case precludes, a prospective defendant or respondent should be notified of the substance of the staff&#x27;s charges and probable recommendations in advance of the submission of the staff memorandum to the Commission recommending the commencement of an enforcement action and be accorded an opportunity to submit a written statement to the staff to be forwarded to the Commission together with the staff memorandum.

<doc id="1040979" wikidata="Q4731971" url="?curid=1040979" title="Allen v. United States (1896)">
<text>Allen v. United States, 164 U.S. 492 (1896), was a United States Supreme Court case that, among other things, approved the use of a jury instruction intended to prevent a hung jury by encouraging jurors in the minority to reconsider. The Court affirmed Alexander Allen&#x27;s murder conviction, having vacated his two prior convictions for the same crime.

Such an instruction became known as an &quot;Allen&quot; charge and is given when, after deliberation, a jury reports that it is deadlocked and unable to decide on a verdict. Because it is used to dislodge jurors from entrenched positions, the &quot;Allen&quot; charge is sometimes referred to as the &quot;dynamite charge&quot; or the &quot;hammer charge.&quot;

&quot;Allen&quot; is based upon the Supreme Court&#x27;s supervisory power over the federal courts. Thus, it is not binding on state courts. Approximately half of US states prohibit &quot;Allen&quot; charges on state law grounds.

== Background ==
Allen&#x27;s three trials had been presided over by Judge Isaac C. Parker of the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas.

== Opinion ==
The relevant portion of &quot;Allen&quot; held:
The seventeenth and eighteenth assignments were taken to instructions given to the jury after the main charge was delivered, and when the jury had returned to the court, apparently for further instructions. These instructions were quite lengthy, and were, in substance, that in a large proportion of cases absolute certainty could not be expected; that, although the verdict must be the verdict of each individual juror, and not a mere acquiescence in the conclusion of his fellows, yet they should examine the question submitted with candor, and with a proper regard and deference to the opinions of each other; that it was their duty to decide the case if they could conscientiously do so; that they should listen, with a disposition to be convinced, to each other&#x27;s arguments; that, if much the larger number were for conviction, a dissenting juror should consider whether his doubt was a reasonable one which made no impression upon the minds of so many men, equally honest, equally intelligent with himself. If, upon the other hand, the majority were for acquittal, the minority ought to ask themselves whether they might not reasonably doubt the correctness of a judgment which was not concurred in by the majority. These instructions were taken literally from a charge in a criminal case which was approved of by the supreme court of Massachusetts and by the supreme court of Connecticut.

While, undoubtedly, the verdict of the jury should represent the opinion of each individual juror, it by no means follows that opinions may not be changed by conference in the jury room. The very object of the jury system is to secure unanimity by a comparison of views, and by arguments among the jurors themselves. It certainly cannot be the law that each juror should not listen with deference to the arguments, and with a distrust of his own judgment, if he finds a large majority of the jury taking a different view of the case from what he does himself. It cannot be that each juror should go to the jury room with a blind determination that the verdict shall represent his opinion of the case at that moment, or that he should close his ears to the arguments of men who are equally honest and intelligent as himself. There was no error in these instructions.

==Text of &quot;Allen&quot; charge==
Text of the Allen charge as approved for use in the United States district courts of the Fifth Circuit:

Members of the Jury:

I&#x27;m going to ask that you continue your deliberations in an effort to reach agreement upon a verdict and dispose of this case; and I have a few additional comments I would like for you to consider as you do so.

This is an important case. The trial has been expensive in time, effort, money and emotional strain to both the defense and the prosecution. If you should fail to agree upon a verdict, the case will be left open and may have to be tried again. Obviously, another trial would only serve to increase the cost to both sides, and there is no reason to believe that the case can be tried again by either side any better or more exhaustively than it has been tried before you.

Any future jury must be selected in the same manner and from the same source as you were chosen, and there is no reason to believe that the case could ever be submitted to twelve men and women more conscientious, more impartial, or more competent to decide it, or that more or clearer evidence could be produced.

If a substantial majority of your number are in favor of a conviction, those of you who disagree should reconsider whether your doubt is a reasonable one since it appears to make no effective impression upon the minds of the others. On the other hand, if a majority or even a lesser number of you are in favor of an acquittal, the rest of you should ask yourselves again, and most thoughtfully, whether you should accept the weight and sufficiency of evidence which fails to convince your fellow jurors beyond a reasonable doubt.

Remember at all times that no juror is expected to give up an honest belief he or she may have as to the weight or effect of the evidence; but, after full deliberation and consideration of the evidence in the case, it is your duty to agree upon a verdict if you can do so.

You must also remember that if the evidence in the case fails to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt the Defendant should have your unanimous verdict of Not Guilty.

You may be as leisurely in your deliberations as the occasion may require and should take all the time which you may feel is necessary.

I will ask now that you retire once again and continue your deliberations with these additional comments in mind to be applied, of course, in conjunction with all of the other instructions I have previously given to you.

==In state courts==
&quot;Allen&quot; charges have been rejected, in whole or in part, by at least twenty-three states. Twenty-two states have rejected the charge by judicial decision:

<doc id="1040982" wikidata="Q595486" url="?curid=1040982" title="Anton Wilhelm Amo">
<text>Anton Wilhelm Amo or Anthony William Amo (c. 1703 – c. 1759) was a Nzema philosopher from Axim, Dutch Gold Coast (now Ghana). Amo was a professor at the universities of Halle and Jena in Germany after studying there. He was brought to Germany by the Dutch West India Company in 1707 and was presented as a gift to Dukes Augustus William and Ludwig Rudolf of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, being treated as a member of the family by their father Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. In 2020, Oxford University Press published a translation (into English) of his Latin works from the early 1730s.

==Early life and education==

Amo was a Nzema (an Akan people). He was born in Axim in the Western region of present-day Ghana, but at the age of about four he was moved to Amsterdam by the Dutch West India Company. Some accounts say that he was enslaved, others that he was sent to Amsterdam by a preacher working in Ghana. Ultimately, it is unknown. 

On 29 July 1708, Amo was baptised (and in 1721 confirmed) in the palace&#x27;s chapel of Salzdahlum near Wolfenbüttel. In 1721 and 1725 he is mentioned as a servant to the Duke&#x27;s family.

He went on to the University of Halle, whose Law School he entered in 1727. He finished his preliminary studies within two years, titling his thesis &quot;Dissertatio Inauguralis de Jure Maurorum in Europa&quot; (1729). This manuscript on &quot;The Rights of Moors in Europe&quot; is lost, but a summary was published in his university&#x27;s &quot;Annals&quot; (1730). For his further studies Amo moved to the University of Wittenberg, studying logic, metaphysics, physiology, astronomy, history, law, theology, politics, and medicine, and mastered six languages (English, French, Dutch, Latin, Greek, and German). His medical education in particular was to play a central role in much of his later philosophical thought.

He gained his doctorate in philosophy at Wittenberg in 1734; his thesis (published as &quot;On the Absence of Sensation in the Human Mind and its Presence in our Organic and Living Body&quot;) argued in favour of a broadly dualist account of the person. Specifically, he argues that it is correct to talk of a mind and a body, but that it is the body rather than the mind that perceives and feels. One example of an argument that Amo uses to show that it is the body, and not the mind, which senses goes as follows: 

Whatever feels, lives; whatever lives, depends on nourishment; whatever lives and depends on nourishment grows; whatever is of this nature is in the end resolved into its basic principles; whatever comes to be resolved into its basic principles is a complex; every complex has its constituent parts; whatever this is true of is a divisible body. If therefore the human mind feels, it follows that it is a divisible body.
::::(&quot;On the Ἀπάθεια (Apatheia) of the Human Mind&quot; 2.1)

Because (on Amo&#x27;s account) the human mind is by definition immaterial and not a divisible body (&quot;On the Ἀπάθεια (Apatheia) of the Human Mind&quot; 1.3), it therefore cannot be the case that the mind itself senses.

==Philosophical career and later life==
Amo returned to the University of Halle to lecture in philosophy under his preferred name of Antonius Guilielmus Amo Afer. In 1736 he was made a professor. From his lectures, he produced his second major work in 1738, &quot;Treatise on the Art of Philosophising Soberly and Accurately&quot;, in which he developed an empiricist epistemology very close to but distinct from that of philosophers such as John Locke and David Hume. In it he also examined and criticised faults such as intellectual dishonesty, dogmatism, and prejudice.

In 1740, Amo took up a post in philosophy at the University of Jena, but while there he experienced a number of changes for the worse. The Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel had died in 1735, leaving him without his long-standing patron and protector. That coincided with social changes in Germany, which was becoming intellectually and morally narrower and less liberal. Those who argued against the secularisation of education (and against the rights of Africans in Europe) were regaining their ascendancy over those who campaigned for greater academic and social freedom, such as Christian Wolff.

Amo was subjected to an unpleasant campaign by some of his enemies, including a public lampoon staged at a theatre in Halle. He finally decided to return to the land of his birth. He set sail on a Dutch West India Company ship to Ghana via Guinea, arriving in about 1747; his father and a sister were still living there. His life from then on becomes more obscure. According to at least one report, he was taken to a Dutch fortress, Fort San Sebastian in Shama, in the 1750s, possibly to prevent him sowing dissent amongst the people. The exact date, place, and manner of his death are unknown, though he probably died in about 1759 at the fort in Shama in Ghana.

==Honors==
On 10 October 2020, Google celebrated him with a Google Doodle.

In Stuttgart, an Anton Wilhelm Amo Square in front of the Stuttgart Labour Court was decided in 2022.
At the end of January 2023, the square formerly known as &quot;Lerchenplätzle&quot; in front of the Stuttgart Labour Court in Johannesstraße was renamed &quot;Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Platz&quot;.
In August 2020, in a context of &quot;decolonization&quot; of place names perceived to have racist origins, officials in the German capital Berlin proposed renaming Mohrenstraße to &quot;Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Straße&quot; in his honor.

In 2024, two museum exhibitions will be held in Germany that focus exclusively on Anton Wilhelm Amo: &quot;Focus on Amo. Pictures for a Scholar&quot; in the Löwengebäude of the University in Halle/Saale 
and the exhibition &quot;Anton Wilhelm Amo - Between the Worlds&quot; at the Museum of Municipal Collections in the Zeughaus in Lutherstadt Wittenberg. 
The curator of this exhibition was the ethnologist Nils Seethaler.

<text>Freedom Radio (a.k.a. A Voice in the Night) is a 1941 British propaganda film directed by Anthony Asquith and starring Clive Brook, Diana Wynyard, Raymond Huntley and Derek Farr. It is set in Nazi Germany during the Second World War and concerns an underground German resistance group who run a radio station broadcasting against the totalitarian Third Reich.

It was shot at Shepperton Studios. The film&#x27;s sets were designed by the art director Paul Sheriff.

==Plot==

The story begins in Vienna just before the beginning of the Second World War. Dr Roder is physician to some important members of the Nazi party but prefers being at his luxurious house with his wife, Irena, and servants. Irena&#x27;s brother Otto returns from Italy and they throw a party with many interesting and high-ranking attendees. During the party the Gestapo call, requiring his immediate attendance.

At his club, the main servitor, Sebastian, announces the club is closing and they will not see him again. Some of Dr Roder&#x27;s friends have already been taken away for &#x27;questioning&#x27; and Dr Roder is horrified and afraid of the direction in which his country is going.

His wife Irena is an actress, and after her performance it is related that Adolf Hitler very much admired her performance. She is offered a post in Berlin as Reich Director of Popular Pageantry.
At church the priest decries the deposition of a fellow priest, inciting an attack by a group of SS officers including Otto who glares at the shocked doctor. The priest is killed but the press release blames the congregation.

Hans Glaser is trying to get a radio sales licence and the doctor says he will try to help. He tells his fiancee Elly, who runs a newspaper stall despite various papers regularly being confiscated by the authorities.

Frau Schmidt is pestered by her neighbour, who frequently scrounges from her, but never pays anything back. This time she asks for lard, but Frau Schmidt refuses, as she has little enough herself. The neighbour is furious at being turned down for once; she eavesdrops and hears Frau Schmidt listening to French broadcasts, then maliciously reports her to the SS, who smash her radio and arrest her just as her granddaughter Elly arrives. An SS officer assaults the girl. She is interrogated, but after Irena learns what happened to her, she intervenes and demands that Elly&#x27;s attacker be punished, and Elly cared for, and they are told that Elly will go to a &quot;rest home&quot;.

Dr Roder and his wife start drifting apart especially when he says the Nazi party is like a cancer. She leaves him and goes to stay in Stuttgart. Things get worse, with beatings, interrogations and book burning.

The doctor asks Hans to build a secret radio. Hans first suspects a trick. The doctor explains he wants to create a &quot;Freedom Station&quot;... both knowing they face death if caught. They use a basement under a toy shop and smuggle parts in through toys brought for repair; they grow a network of helpers, including Fenner, an actor friend of Dr. Roder&#x27;s.

Dr Roder creates a secret radio station transmitting on 26.9, from which he broadcasts condemnations of Hitler and prays for a &quot;better&quot; Germany to arise from the ashes of his ruined country. The unauthorised broadcast is intercepted and a public announcement made saying &quot;do not listen to 26.9&quot; accidentally promoting the station. They broadcast each evening at 10.30pm.

The birth of &quot;Freedom Radio&quot; sees the creation of an underground group of anti-Nazis who regard Karl as their leader.

Multiple people ring the doctor to wish him happy birthday... but it is not his birthday.

Captain Muller explains to his superiors how triangulation can be used to calculate where the signal is coming from. He blames Goebels for jamming the signal which then cannot be traced.

Otto visits Irena when the radio is on, they both think they recognise Dr Roder&#x27;s voice. Otto is asked to join Muller&#x27;s detection unit. Fenner starts doing more of the live broadcasts and the doctor&#x27;s voice is put onto a gramophone record for broadcast, whilst he appears in public to prove that he is not the Voice.

His friend Rudolf has friends on each side. It is intimated to Rudolph in a coded message that Germany will invade Poland on the following Friday.

It is discovered that Hitler will be making a major broadcast from a stadium and Hans goes to rig up a bypass to allow their own message to be broadcast instead.
Ironically Irena is in charge of organising the pageantry of the huge rally. She has a special seat with Rabenau. Hitler starts to speak then it jumps to Roder... he speaks for under a minute before the power is switched off. Hans is almost caught, but, with the aid of a secret supporter, gets away, dressed as an SS officer. However, he and Fenner are pursued, and Fenner sacrifices his life to ensure Hans&#x27; liberty.

They suspect Dr Roder and burst into his clinic. They find nothing. Meanwhile Hans gets home and finds Elly in his room; she looks broken, like an old woman. Unknown to Hans and the Roders, she had been sent not to a care home, but to a concentration camp.

Dr Roder&#x27;s wife returns and accuses him of being a traitor. He vows to make one last broadcast. Otto appears and chats with Mrs Roder; he overheard them talking and believes she knows where her husband is going to make the broadcast from. She is taken to Ranenau&#x27;s office, but tells them the wrong place. However, they work out that Dr Roder had indicated a photo in a frame as the site of the broadcast. The SS identify it as Spiedler&#x27;s cottage. As Ranenau tells Irena that there will indeed be war she goes to Dr Roder to warn him that the Gestapo are coming to the cottage. But the doctor sets up the transmitter in the back of a van. Irena joins him, for the first time understanding that things are not as she had thought. The Gestapo close in and locate the van. They fire a machine gun into the van killing the doctor but not before he broadcasts their country&#x27;s plan to invade Poland. As he is killed, first Irena takes over the broadcast, then, when she is killed, others in the group broadcast from elsewhere that good people were murdered that day, but that they will continue to broadcast the truth.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;An excellent, well-directed film of good propaganda value. The sound recording is specially praiseworthy. In a magnificent cast, Clive Brook and Diana Wynyard give of their best as Karl and Irene and there are some cameos of acting worth remembering, for example Morland Graham as Father Landbach and Katie Johnson as Granny Schmidt.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; critic wrote that &quot;this is a frankly propagandistic drama...The admirable emotional restraint which went into the making of several of the better British war films seen here in the past year is sadly lacking.&quot;

Sky Movies called the film, &quot;gripping, strongly cast and more subtle than most propaganda thrillers of its time...And film buffs may spot Katie Johnson, later to win fame in &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; but here, 13 years earlier, already in granny roles!&quot;

Wolfgang Gans zu Putlitz, German diplomat operating for British intelligence, recalls in his autobiography working on the film as a consultant at Shepperton in the winter of 1939–40.

<doc id="1041003" wikidata="Q977729" url="?curid=1041003" title="RMS Alcantara (1926)">
<text>RMS &quot;Alcantara&quot; was a Royal Mail Lines ocean liner that was built in Belfast in 1926. She served in the Second World War first as an armed merchant cruiser and then a troop ship. She returned to civilian service in 1948 and was scrapped in 1958.

==Background==
In the First World War the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company lost a number of ships to enemy action, including three of its &quot;A-series&quot; passenger liners: , and . After the 1918 Armistice RMSP prioritised the replacement of lost cargo ships, using new refrigerated cargo ships to take a share of the growing trade in frozen meat from South America to the UK.

High demand for new merchant ships to replace First World War losses kept shipbuilding prices high, so RMSP Chairman Lord Kylsant deferred ordering any new passenger liners for a few years. However, in 1921 Parliament passed the first of five Trade Facilities Acts, which offered low-interest loans and Government guarantees for repayment. In 1924 Kylsant took advantage of the Act by ordering from Harland and Wolff of Belfast a pair of passenger liners with a speed of .

==As a diesel-powered motor ship==
Harland and Wolff launched the new &quot;Asturias&quot; on 7 July 1925 and completed her in February 1926. Her sister ship &quot;Alcantara&quot; was launched on 23 September 1926 and completed in February 1927. The latter was named after RMSP&#x27;s previous &quot;Alcantara&quot;, which was an armed merchant cruiser in the First World War and had been lost when she and the German armed merchant cruiser sank each other in 1916.

The new &quot;Alcantara&quot; was given the UK official number 148151 and code letters KVQC. When four-letter maritime call signs were introduced in 1934, &quot;Asturias&quot; was given the call sign GLQR.

Each of the two new ships was powered by a pair of eight-cylinder four-stroke double-acting diesel engines built by Harland and Wolff to a Burmeister &amp; Wain design. The engines gave each ship 10,000 ihp or 7,500 bhp, and at the time they were the World&#x27;s largest motor ships. However, their cruising speed was only , which was less than that of competing ships already on the route between European ports and the South American east coast. This was an embarrassment for Lord Kylsant, who in 1924 had become Chairman of Harland and Wolff in addition to his position as chairman of RMSP.

In comparison, &quot;Compagnie de Navigation Sud-Atlantique&quot; had two liners on the route, &quot;Lutetia&quot; (1913) and &quot;Massilia&quot; (1920), that were smaller and older but at could offer a passage that was quicker by several days. Hamburg Süd also competed on the route with its , . In 1927 Hamburg Süd strengthened its competition by introducing the liner , which not only matched the speed of the French ships but at also became the largest ship on the route between Europe and South America.

==Repowering with steam turbines==
In 1931 the Royal Mail Case resulted in the jailing of Lord Kylsant, and in 1932 the company was reconstituted as a new body, Royal Mail Lines, chaired by Lord Essendon. He claimed that German, Italian, and French competitors were running ships to South America at , giving a passage about five days quicker than RMSP. The new RML company immediately considered how to raise the speed of &quot;Asturias&quot; and &quot;Alcantara&quot;. Essendon concluded that foreign competitors were losing money at 22 knots, but a range of options to raise the speed of &quot;Asturias&quot; and &quot;Alcantara&quot; to should be evaluated. Essendon also proposed inviting foreign competitors to agree on a 19-knot speed limit on the South American route, so that all companies could economise on fuel and attempt to cover their costs.

At that time marine diesel power was at a relatively early stage of development, and RML considered it unable to increase the two ships&#x27; speed to the required level. Lord Essendon therefore recommended steam turbines, and two options for the drive system: either conventional reduction gearing, or the newer turbo-electric transmission that had been pioneered in the USA and successfully applied to US, UK and French ocean liners. Whichever transmission was chosen, the cost of re-engining &quot;Asturias&quot; and &quot;Alcantara&quot; was estimated at about £500,000. Lord Essendon also urged RML directors to order a third ship of similar speed to share the route with &quot;Asturias&quot; and &quot;Alcantara&quot;.

Given the Great Depression at the time, the RML board rejected the idea of a new ship. At first it was prepared to have only one ship re-engined, and proposed reassigning the other to cruising to replace the ageing A-series liner . However, in May 1933 the board consented to have both &quot;Asturias&quot; and &quot;Alcantara&quot; re-engined, and at the same time to lengthen their bows and improve the accommodation. RML awarded the work to Harland and Wolff, but with a condition in the contract that the ships must achieve at least , and a graduated penalty clause in case the actual speed increase should fall short of that figure. In the same year, Lord Essendon succeeded in getting RML&#x27;s competitors to accept a 19-knot speed limit on the South American route.

Harland and Wolff fitted each ship with three water-tube boilers supplying superheated steam at 435 lbf/in2 to a set of six turbines that drove her twin propeller shafts by single reduction gearing. The National Physical Laboratory helped the shipyard to design new aerofoil-section manganese bronze three-bladed propellers; the rudders were also streamlined. The new machinery succeeded in increasing each ship&#x27;s nominal horsepower by 25% and increased their speed to about .

&quot;Asturias&quot; was converted first, going to Belfast in May 1934 and returning to service in October. Only after &quot;Asturias&quot; had successfully completed a voyage from Southampton to Rio de Janeiro and back did RMSP send &quot;Alcantara&quot; to Harland and Wolff at Belfast in November. She returned to service in May 1935.

Each ship had two funnels, of which the forward one was a dummy. As built the funnels were low, which was a fashion for some 1920s and &#x27;30s motor ships. When the ships were re-engined in 1934 each funnel was increased in height.

==Second World War service==
In 1939 the Admiralty requisitioned &quot;Alcantara&quot; and &quot;Asturias&quot; and had each ship converted into an armed merchant cruiser. The mainmast and forward dummy funnel of each ship were removed to increase the arc of fire for their anti-aircraft guns.

&quot;Alcantara&quot; was sent to Malta for further modifications, but &quot;en route&quot; she had a major collision with the Cunard ship . As a result, &quot;Alcantara&quot; continued to Alexandria for hull repairs. The beds from &quot;Alcantara&quot; were sent to Malta, installed in Admiralty House and used for bombed out civilians and naval staff.

On 28 July 1940 &quot;Alcantara&quot; encountered the German in the South Atlantic. With her steam turbines &quot;Alcantara&quot; made for four hours to chase &quot;Thor&quot;, and two shells from &quot;Alcantara&quot;″s six-inch main guns hit the German ship. But three shells from &quot;Thor&quot; hit &quot;Alcantara&quot; and one flooded her engine room. This forced &quot;Alcantara&quot; to reduce speed, enabling &quot;Thor&quot; to escape.

In 1943 &quot;Alcantara&quot; was converted into a troop ship.

==Final years and artefacts==
&quot;Alcantara&quot; remained a troop ship well after the end of the war, and did not return to civilian service until October 1948. &quot;Asturias&quot; remained in UK Government service as an emigrant ship, and &quot;Alcantara&quot; resumed their route between Southampton and South America, together with . In April 1958 she was withdrawn from service and sold to Japanese shipbreakers who renamed her &quot;Kaisho Maru&quot;, took her to Japan and broke her up in the same year.

As part of the conversion to an auxiliary ship, mahogany wood panelling in the lobby was removed and stored in order to be replaced after the war. Eventually, the panels were not reused but were sold to the Parish Church of Our Lady of Graces in Żabbar, Malta, where they were used as the platform for the 1951 titular painting coronation ceremony. The panels are now in the Żabbar Sanctuary Museum.

<text>Karori is a suburb located at the western edge of the urban area of Wellington, New Zealand, from the city centre and is one of New Zealand&#x27;s most populous suburbs, with a population of in The name Karori used to be Kaharore and is from the Māori language. No Māori lived in the area, when the first European settlers came to Karori in the 1840s. The first settler in Karori cleared 20 acres of forest on his section with his younger brother Moses and advertised its sale in December 1841.

Amenities in Karori include, a community garden, a library, a swimming pool, and several church buildings.

==History==
=== Origins ===
The name &quot;Karori&quot; used to be &quot;Kaharore&quot; and is from te reo Māori. It comes from the Māori phrase &#x27;te kaha o ngā rore&#x27; meaning &#x27;the place of many bird snares&#x27;. Originally forested, Māori used the Karori area for hunting. It also had tracks crossing it that led to Māori pā on the west coast.

No Māori lived in the area when the first European settlers came to Karori in the 1840s. Settlers bought land from the New Zealand Company, the area was included in their Port Nicholson Block deal. The first settler in Karori, John Yule of Glasgow, cleared 20 acres of forest on his section with his younger brother Moses and advertised its sale in December 1841. By 1845, ten 100-acre sections were being taken up and sub-divided, and Karori boasted 215 inhabitants – 109 of them under the age of 14 years.

In 1845 a group of armed police from Wellington constructed a small fortified post that became known as &quot;The Stockade&quot; in response to fears of attacks from nearby Māori insurgents. While there were no attacks, the stockade was used for a church service and to grind grain. The stockade was located on Mr Chapman&#x27;s land, about halfway along what is now Marsden Avenue.

The first mental hospital in Wellington was built in 1854. By 1871 it had 23 inmates and was run by untrained staff, which resulted in the first matron and her husband being dismissed in 1872 because of cruelty. In 1873 the asylum moved from Karori to the site of present-day Government House in central Wellington. Karori School took over the asylum site in 1875.

Frederick Mackie in his book &quot;Traveller under concern&quot; described Karori in the 1850s:

:&quot;The walk was highly romantic. The road is cut out of the sides of steep hills covered with forest. The ever-winding road, the steep declivities, the forest above and below you, and the continual murmur of streams concealed in the depths below were very pleasing, as every few yards a new scene and fresh objects were brought to view. In one spot I obtained a view of the harbour, which today was like a bright glassy lake, and beyond it were the lofty ranges of the snow-clad Rimutaka and Tararuas, partly glistening in the sun and partly shrouded in cloud.&quot;

===Karori gold rush===
Karori experienced a gold rush when the valley of the Upper Kaiwharawhara Stream became subject to intensive gold-mining activity between 1869 and 1873. This activity eventually led to the building of the lower Karori Dam (now part of Zealandia) in 1873. At the height of the rush, about 200 men worked the claims, driving shafts and drives up to 500 feet in length into the hills.

===Growth and subdivision=== 
In 1888 a syndicate purchased section 34, which was the closest to town (running from present day Ponsonby Road to Cooper Street). The new owners prepared the land for sale by building roads and naming them after the members of the syndicate and their families, and by running a marketing campaign, including providing free buses from Manners Street and writing poems:
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;In far-famed New Zealand, the evergreen free land&quot;
&quot;Most favoured and beautiful Queen of the wave,&quot;
&quot;Where the sun ever smiling, bad weather beguiling,&quot;
&quot;Brightly shines on the face of the honest and brave.&quot;
&quot;Tho&#x27; for Europe&#x27;s bold races there are plenty of places&quot;
&quot;Adapted as homes for the great and the small,&quot;
&quot;Yet, for onward progressing and bountiful blessing&quot;
&quot;There is one whose position is far before all.&quot;
&quot;So haste where kind Nature&#x27;s arrayed in her glory,&quot;
&quot;To pleasant, romantic, suburban Karori.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Karori Borough, 1891–1920===
Karori was a part of Hutt County from the county&#x27;s establishment in 1877 to 1891 when Karori was declared a separate borough following a petition in favour of forming a borough with 123 signatories. A counter-petition garnered 41 signatories.

====List of mayors of Karori Borough====
===Amalgamation with Wellington, 1920===

<text>Raymond Vahan Damadian (March 16, 1936 – August 3, 2022) was an American physician, medical researcher, and inventor of the first nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) scanning machine.

Damadian&#x27;s research into sodium and potassium in living cells led him to his first experiments with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) which caused him to first propose the MR body scanner in 1969. Damadian discovered that tumors and normal tissue can be distinguished in vivo by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) because of their prolonged relaxation times, both T1 (spin-lattice relaxation) or T2 (spin-spin relaxation). Damadian was the first to perform a full-body scan of a human being in 1977 to diagnose cancer. Damadian invented an apparatus and method to use NMR safely and accurately to scan the human body, a method now well known as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Damadian received several prizes. In 2001, the Lemelson-MIT Prize Program bestowed its $100,000 Lifetime Achievement Award on Damadian as &quot;the man who invented the MRI scanner.&quot; He went on to collaborate with Wilson Greatbach, one early developer of the implantable pacemaker, to develop an MRI-compatible pacemaker. The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia gave its recognition of Damadian&#x27;s work on MRI with the Bower Award in Business Leadership. He was also named Knights of Vartan 2003 &quot;Man of the Year&quot;. He received a National Medal of Technology in 1988 and was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1989.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Raymond Vahan Damadian () was born in New York City, to an Armenian family. His father Vahan was a photoengraver who had immigrated from what is now Turkey, while his mother Odette (née Yazedjian) was an accountant. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1956, and an M.D. degree from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City in 1960. He studied the violin at Juilliard for 8 years, and played in Junior Davis Cup tennis competitions.

He met his future wife, Donna Terry, while he had a job as a tennis coach. She invited him to the 1957 Billy Graham crusade at Madison Square Garden, and he responded to the altar call. Raymond and Donna married a year after he finished medical school, and they had three children. Raymond said that he first became interested in detecting cancer when, as a boy of 10, he saw his maternal grandmother, with whom he was very close, die painfully of breast cancer.

===Magnetic resonance imaging===
Damadian&#x27;s early work on NMR concerned investigating potassium ions inside cells. He found that the potassium relaxation times were much shorter compared with aqueous solutions of potassium ions. This suggested that potassium was not free but complexed to &#x27;fixed-charge&#x27; counter-ions, as he had previously determined.

He and other researchers independently investigated the signals of 1H NMR in cells, and found that the relaxation times were much shorter than in distilled water. This was consistent with ordering of a large part of the water by adsorption onto macromolecular surfaces. Damadian predicted that cancerous cells would have longer relaxation times, both because of the disordering of malignant cells and because of their elevated potassium levels, since the potassium ions would be &#x27;structure-breaking&#x27; to the ordered water fraction.

In a 1971 paper in the journal &quot;Science&quot;, SUNY Downstate Medical Center professor Damadian reported that tumors can be detected in vivo by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) because of much longer relaxation times than normal tissue. He suggested that these differences could be used to detect cancer, even in the early stages where it would be most treatable, though later research would find that these differences, while real, are too variable for diagnostic purposes. However, Damadian in his seminal paper claimed only that his method was a &quot;detection&quot; tool, making no claim about being a diagnostic tool, but intended that it would provide a non-invasive way of detecting cancers and monitoring the effectiveness of their therapy.

In 1974, he received the first patent in the field of MRI when he patented the concept of NMR for detecting cancer after filing an application in 1972. As the National Science Foundation notes, &quot;The patent included the idea of using NMR to &#x27;scan&#x27; the human body to locate cancerous tissue.&quot; However, it did not describe a method for generating pictures from such a scan or precisely how such a scan might be done. However, Damadian&#x27;s recognition that NMR relaxation time can be used to distinguish different tissue types and malignant tissue is what gives MRI its contrast to tissue types.

In the 1950s, Herman Carr reported creating a one-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR) image. Prompted by Damadian&#x27;s report on the potential medical uses of NMR, Paul Lauterbur expanded on Carr&#x27;s technique and developed a way to generate the first MRI images, in 2D and 3D, using gradients. Peter Mansfield from the University of Nottingham then developed a mathematical technique that would allow scans to take seconds rather than hours and produce clearer images than Lauterbur had. While Lauterbur and Mansfield focused on animals and human limbs, Damadian built the first full-body MRI machine and produced the first full magnetic resonance imaging (&quot;MRI&quot;) scan of the human body, albeit using a &quot;focused field&quot; technique that differs considerably from modern imaging.
According to a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article, Damadian&#x27;s initial methods were flawed for practical use, relying on a point-by-point scan of the entire body and using relaxation rates, which turned out to not be an effective indicator of cancerous tissue. However, the same article pointed out, &quot;Nevertheless, his observation of T1 and T2 differences in cancerous tissue was a Eureka moment for Paul Lauterbur.&quot; Furthermore, Damadian&#x27;s seminal paper documented in its Table 2 that T1 relaxation times were different, beyond experimental uncertainty, across all his samples over different healthy tissues: rectus muscle, liver, stomach, small intestine, kidney, and brain. This showed the way to accurate imaging of the body&#x27;s soft tissues for the first time; X-ray imaging was severely deficient for soft tissue analysis because the difference in absorption was so small (&lt;4%). 
So when in the court case Fonar v. General Electric, GE&#x27;s attorneys made the same claim that relaxations times were also prolonged in non-cancerous tissue, so were not a good diagnostic, Fonar&#x27;s attorneys responded that it was unfair to punish Damadian because his methods detected even &quot;more&quot; features than he had intended. Indeed, even today, 90% of MRI scans on patients produce images that are relaxation dependent, either T1- or T2-dependent images.

===First human MRI body scan===
On July 3, 1977, the first MRI body exam was performed on a human being (the first human scan was performed by Peter Mansfield&#x27;s team in Nottingham a year earlier, on fellow author Andrew Maudsley&#x27;s finger). It took almost five hours to produce one image: a 106-voxel point-by-point scan of Larry Minkoff&#x27;s thorax. The images were rudimentary by modern standards. Damadian, along with colleagues Larry Minkoff and Michael Goldsmith took seven years to reach this point. They named their original machine &quot;Indomitable&quot; to capture the spirit of their struggle to do what many said could not be done, though no systems would ever use Damadian&#x27;s method. His technique of imaging was never made into a practically usable method and has therefore never been used in MR imaging as we know it today.

His patent followed on the heels of rumors already floating throughout the scientific community of Lauterbur&#x27;s proposed idea of using NMR &quot;in vivo&quot; (still in the human body, an imaging device). However, in 1969, Damadian had previously proposed NMR as a method for external scanning of internal cancers in the body, i.e. &quot;in vivo&quot;:

:I am very much interested in the potential of NMR spectroscopy for early non-destructive detection of internal malignancies. … I will make every effort myself, and through collaborators, to establish that all tumors can be recognized by their potassium relaxation times or H2O-proton spectra and proceed with the development of instrumentation and probes that can be used to scan the human body externally for early signs of malignancy. Detection of internal tumors during the earliest states of their genesis should bring us very close to the total eradication of the disease.

Though it would later turn out to be irreproducible, in his 1971 &quot;Science&quot; paper, Damadian showed different NMR signals for tumors and different tissue types:

:In principle, nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR] techniques combine many of the desirable features of an external probe for the detection of internal cancer.

This was clearly influential, as Lauterbur wrote in 1986:

: … the attention of the medical community was first attracted by the report of Damadian that some animal tumors have remarkably long water proton relaxation times.
: … even long normal tissues differed markedly among themselves in NMR relaxation times, and I wondered whether there might be some way to noninvasively map out such quantities within the body.

Thus it was the discovery of strongly variant relaxation times that led to Lauterbur&#x27;s quest to represent these relaxation time differences graphically. Without these differences, unknown until Damadian&#x27;s work, there would be nothing to make an image with. Hence a book on MRI history, which included chapters on both Damadian and Lauterbur, Chapter 8 entitled, &quot;Raymond V. Damadian: Originator of the Concept of Whole-Body NMR Scanning (MRI) and Discoverer of the NMR Tissue Relaxation Differences That Made It Possible.&quot; The book pointed out the importance of both men:

:Because of the contributions of Dr. Raymond Damadian and Dr. Paul Lauterbur, magnetic resonance imaging has become the most powerful and reliable diagnostic tool in medicine...
:Millions of people the world over enjoy a higher quality of life and many lives have been saved, thanks to the contributions of Damadian and Lauterbur.

:NMR scanning resulted from two essential steps. They were taken by the two great MRI pioneers of this volume, Dr. Raymond Damadian and Dr. Paul Lauterbur. Dr. Damadian provided the first step, the discovery of tissue NMR signal differences from which the image is made and the first concept of an NMR body scanner that would utilize these signal differences to detect disease in the human body. Dr. Lauterbur provided the next step of visualizing these signal differences as an image and supplied the first method for acquiring these signals at practical speeds. It does not seem likely that MRI could have come to pass without the key steps contributed by both scientists.

:Without Damadian&#x27;s discovery, it could not be known that serious diseases like cancer could be detected by an NMR scanner or that tissue NMR signals possessed sufficient contrast to create medically useful images. Without Lauterbur&#x27;s contribution, development of a practical method for visualizing these signal differences as an image might have occurred much less efficiently. Moreover, the incredible amount of courage and pugnacity shown by Damadian, working alone with only two students, without any consistent granting, thus leading him to do most of the development of his system as a self-made man learning when required, electronics, machining, welding and many other technologies in order to build his first prototype, is exemplary for any researcher. This have to be compared with the working conditions of Lauterbur or Mansfield, both working with comfortable fundings in spacious laboratories with many colleagues and students. At least from the point of view of the merit, the work of Damadian, indeed, is considerable. …

:Recognizing their achievements, the President of the United States awarded the nation&#x27;s highest honor in technology, the National Medal of Technology, jointly to Dr. Damadian and Dr. Lauterbur for the development of MRI. In presenting the award on July 15, 1988, President Ronald Reagan cited both scientists &#x27;for their independent contributions in conceiving and developing the application of magnetic resonance technology to medical uses including whole-body scanning and diagnostic imaging.

Damadian&#x27;s machine is now in the Smithsonian Institution. As late as 1982, there were a handful of MRI scanners in the entire United States; today there are thousands.

===Fonar Corporation===
In 1978, Damadian formed his own company, Fonar (which stood for &quot;Field Focused Nuclear Magnetic Resonance&quot;), for the production of MRI scanners, and in 1980, he produced the first commercial one. Damadian&#x27;s &quot;focused field&quot; technology proved significantly less efficient and slower than Lauterbur&#x27;s gradient approach. His scanner, named &quot;Indomitable,&quot; failed to sell. Fonar eventually abandoned Damadian&#x27;s technique in favor of the methods adopted by Lauterbur and Mansfield. Damadian and Fonar enforced the royalties on patents held by Damadian. They settled with many large companies, but a case against General Electric went to the Federal Circuit, which upheld a $129 million ruling against GE for violation of Damadian&#x27;s patents. Damadian said that the judgment money was all put back into Fonar for research and development purposes.

Damadian was the company&#x27;s largest shareholder, with 8% of stock worth $6.5 million. Despite owning only 8% of the stock, he maintained almost 100% control of the company through a separate class of shares (Class C) that only Damadian controlled 2007. Damadian later collaborated with Wilson Greatbatch, one early developer of the implantable pacemaker, to develop an MRI-compatible pacemaker. He invented a stand-up MRI system and has 15 MRI scanning centers across the United States. There are a number of independent MRI centers that use this technology both in the U.S. and around the world. The company conceived and built the world&#x27;s first Upright Multi-Positional MRI, which was recognized as The &quot;Invention of the Year&quot; in 2007 by the Intellectual Properties Owners Association Education Foundation.

===Creationism===
Damadian was a lifelong Christian. In the February 4, 2014, Bill Nye–Ken Ham debate, Damadian was one of the scientists who recorded themselves on video professing a belief in young Earth creationism for Answers in Genesis president Ken Ham to cite.

===Death===
Damadian died on August 3, 2022, at the age of 86 from cardiac arrest.

==Awards and honors==
Damadian received a National Medal of Technology in 1988 and was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1989. His original MRI full-body scanner was given to the Smithsonian Institution in the 1980s and is now on loan and on display at the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Ohio. In 2001, the Lemelson-MIT Prize Program bestowed its $100,000 Lifetime Achievement Award on Damadian as &quot;the man who invented the MRI scanner.&quot;

The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia gave its recognition of Damadian&#x27;s work on MRI with the Bower Award in Business Leadership. He was named the Knights of Vartan 2003 &quot;Man of the Year.&quot; In September 2003, he was honored with the Innovation Award in Bioscience from &quot;The Economist&quot;.

===Nobel Prize controversy===
In 2003, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Paul Lauterbur and Sir Peter Mansfield for their discoveries related to MRI. Although Nobel rules allow for the award to be shared by up to three recipients, Damadian was not given the prize. The controversy over who played what part in the development of the MRI had gone on for years prior to the Nobel announcement, and many in the scientific community felt that the Nobel had not been awarded for the MRI for so long due to debate over Damadian&#x27;s role in its development.

Damadian said that credit should go to &quot;me, and then Lauterbur,&quot; and Lauterbur felt that only he should get credit. In 1997 the National Academy of Sciences commissioned a timeline of MRI milestones, and four of the 12 in an initial draft were attributed to Damadian. At the final publication in 2001, longer than any other publication in the series had ever been taken, none of the milestones was attributed to Damadian. The text said that Damadian&#x27;s methods had &quot;not proved clinically reliable in detecting or diagnosing cancer.&quot; After Damadian&#x27;s lawyers sent the NAS a threatening letter, the text on the NAS website was revised, but not to Damadian&#x27;s satisfaction. Damadian said in 2002, &quot;If I had not been born, would MRI have existed? I don&#x27;t think so. If Lauterbur had not been born? I would have gotten there. Eventually.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote:The issue has been the subject of a dispute between Dr. Damadian and Dr. Lauterbur and has been known for years in academic circles, with some fearing that the Nobel committee would steer clear of magnetic resonance imaging altogether because of the Swedes&#x27; supposed distaste for controversial discoveries. Dr. Lauterbur, 74, is not in good health, and the committee may have decided that its prize, which cannot be given posthumously, needed to be awarded for the discovery now or never.&quot;.

After the announcement of Lauterbur and Mansfield&#x27;s Nobels, between October and November 2003, an ad hoc group called &quot;The Friends of Raymond Damadian&quot; (formed by Damadian&#x27;s company FONAR) took out full-page advertisements in &quot;The New York Times&quot; twice, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, and one of the largest newspapers in Sweden, &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; protesting his exclusion with the headline &quot;The Shameful Wrong That Must Be Righted&quot; in an attempt to get the Nobel Committee to change its mind and grant him a share of the Prize.

Damadian suggested that Lauterbur and Mansfield should have rejected the Nobel Prize unless Damadian was given joint recognition. Supporting Damadian were various MRI experts including John Throck Watson, Eugene Feigelson, V. Adrian Parsegian, David Stark, and James Mattson. &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Horace Freeland Judson criticised this behavior, noting that there is &quot;no Nobel Prize for whining&quot; and that many deserving candidates who may have had better claims than Damadian, such as Lise Meitner, Oswald Avery, and Jocelyn Bell, had been previously denied a share of the Nobel. However, he had to admit that Erwin Chargaff, whose two rules were instrumental in the discovery of DNA&#x27;s structure, was very vocal about his omission, and Fred Hoyle was irate about Jocelyn Bell&#x27;s exclusion.

Others pointed out that while Damadian had hypothesized that NMR relaxation times might be used to detect cancer, he did not develop (nor did he suggest) the current way of creating images. Since the Nobel Prize was awarded to Lauterbur and Mansfield for the development of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance &quot;Imaging&quot;, Damadian&#x27;s exclusion makes more sense. Some felt that research scientists sided with Lauterbur because he was one of their own, while Damadian was a physician who had profited greatly from his early patents. Charles Springer, an expert in MRI at Oregon Health and Science University, said that if a poll was taken of the academic community, most would agree with the Nobel Committee&#x27;s conclusions. And Mansfield wrote in his autobiography that &quot;the person who really missed out&quot; on winning the prize was Erwin Hahn for his contribution to the principles of spin echoes.

Chemist George Kauffman argued that Damadian deserved the Nobel:
Undoubtedly, both Damadian and Lauterbur made major contributions to MRI imaging and scanning. Without Damadian&#x27;s relaxation discoveries that showed sharp discrimination between tissues and particularly a serious disease like cancer, there would have been no reason to entertain or even consider a method for displaying the relaxation differences so that they could be visualized as an image. Furthermore, except for the relaxation differences discovered by Damadian, there would be no reason to expect that such an image would show anything, i.e., that any tissue NMR contrast existed with which to make an image.
Science and technology are two distinctly different enterprises. Science is the branch of knowledge dedicated to compiling factual information and understanding natural phenomena. It precedes technology, and technology cannot advance without it. Without science&#x27;s new knowledge of natural phenomena, technology&#x27;s new methods for exploiting and taking advantage of nature&#x27;s secrets cannot be created. The new scientific information is necessarily the first step.

Moreover, there is no doubt that Damadian&#x27;s seminal discovery preceded Lauterbur&#x27;s developments.

Philosopher Michael Ruse writing for the Metanexus Institute suggested that Damadian might have been denied a Nobel prize because of his creationist views, saying:
I cringe at the thought that Raymond Damadian was refused his just honor because of his religious beliefs. Having silly ideas in one field is no good reason to deny merit for great ideas in another field. Apart from the fact that this time the Creation Scientists will think that there is good reason to think that they are the objects of unfair treatment at the hands of the scientific community.

Damadian himself said, &quot;Before this happened, nobody ever said to me &#x27;They will not give you the Nobel Prize for Medicine because you are a creation scientist&#x27;. If people were actively campaigning against me because of that, I never knew it.&quot;

In his 2015 memoir &quot;Gifted Mind&quot;, Damadian suggested the Nobel committee may have rejected him because of his religious beliefs.

<doc id="1041012" wikidata="Q1468594" url="?curid=1041012" title="Coutances Cathedral">
<text>Coutances Cathedral () is a Gothic Catholic cathedral constructed from 1210 to 1274 in the town of Coutances, Normandy, France. It incorporated the remains of an earlier Norman cathedral.

It is the seat of the Bishop of Coutances and Avranches and was previously that of the Bishop of Coutances.

Standing 80 metres (295 ft) tall, it dominates the town and can be seen from as far away as the island of Jersey. It is a classic example of the Gothic style of Normandy in its use of long, straight, vertical lines.

==History==
The construction of the first church or cathedral in Coutances in the 5th century is credited to Saint Ereptiolus, traditionally also the first bishop. This cathedral was destroyed during the invasion of the Normans in the 9th century.

The site lay waste for about 150 years but, in the mid-11th century, Robert, bishop of Coutances, undertook the rebuilding of the cathedral in the Romanesque or Norman style, starting with the nave. Robert died shortly afterward, but the work was carried forward by Geoffrey de Montbray, his successor as bishop, appointed in 1048. Geoffrey was on good terms with William, Duke of Normandy (later known as the Conqueror), who attended the consecration of the new cathedral in 1056. The bishop subsequently accompanied William on the conquest of England. The cathedral benefited greatly from the enormous profits of this conquest.

The Romanesque cathedral suffered later from a serious fire. In 1210 Bishop Hugues de Morville started to build the present Gothic cathedral, retaining the dimensions and much of the fabric of the Romanesque building. Substantial remains of it underlie many of the walls and towers of the present cathedral.

The new cathedral was completed in 1274 and has remained basically unaltered since. The twin towers rise to almost 80m, and its octagonal lantern tower stands over 57m high.

Some damage was done in the Wars of Religion in 1562 but this was repaired soon after. The roodscreen was removed in the 17th century. In 1794 during the French Revolution much superficial damage was done: statues were removed from their niches whilst others were slashed with swords. The cathedral was used successively as a theatre, a grain store and a Temple of Reason, but despite the losses and damage, survived with its structure intact.

During World War II, although much damage was done to the town of Coutances, the cathedral again escaped almost unscathed.

==Building description==

Over the entrance is a modern window showing the figures of the cathedral founders of 1048 and 1218 (bishops Geoffroy de Montbray and Hugues de Morville); in the centre is the figure of Saint Ereptiole, believed to have built the first church in Coutances.

In the south aisle is a pillar with a carved capital depicting medieval ladies.

The lantern tower is designed to provide an intense source of light in the centre of the cathedral. Eyes are drawn to the circle at the centre which is meant to represent Heaven, while the earth is the square, and the octagon represents the Resurrection.

Behind the principal altar stand six pairs of pillars supporting the roof, which are said to stand for the Twelve Apostles. The windows date from the 15th century.

The south ambulatory contains the Chapel of Saint Joseph, with a wall painting of 1381 that depicts the Holy Trinity of God the Father, Christ on the Cross, and the Holy Spirit as a dove.

The Chapel of Saint Laud, also in the south ambulatory, is one of the oldest parts of the cathedral, dating from the 13th century. The stained glass window shows details from the life of Saint Lo, including the saint celebrating mass with the dove of the Holy Spirit appearing above the altar. (His helper holds the hem of his robe to prevent him stepping back on to it and tripping.)

The north ambulatory contains the Chapel of Saint Marcouf, with a window showing scenes from the saint&#x27;s life. The north ambulatory also holds the holy oils (chrism) used during the sacraments of baptism and extreme unction, confirmation, and at the ordination of priests.

The north transept displays a 13th-century stained-glass window showing scenes from the lives of the saints Thomas Becket, George and Blaise.

The floor of the north aisle is laid with medieval tiles decorated with the &quot;fleur-de-lys,&quot; or lily, the emblem of the French royal family (and a symbol associated with the Virgin Mary). Other tiles show the arms of Castile, next to the fleur-de-lys of France. The baptismal font is located in the north aisle.

The cathedral has had an organ since before 1468. The current organ was built in 1728 and has four keyboards or manuals, 51 stops and a pedal board. The west window is partially hidden by the organ.

Above the south porch are the symbols of the four Evangelists (Saints Matthew, Mark, Luke and John).

<doc id="1041015" wikidata="Q409473" url="?curid=1041015" title="Nitrogen trichloride">
<text>Nitrogen trichloride, also known as trichloramine, is the chemical compound with the formula . This yellow, oily, and explosive liquid is most commonly encountered as a product of chemical reactions between ammonia-derivatives and chlorine (for example, in swimming pools). Alongside monochloramine and dichloramine, trichloramine is responsible for the distinctive &#x27;chlorine smell&#x27; associated with swimming pools, where the compound is readily formed as a product from hypochlorous acid reacting with ammonia and other nitrogenous substances in the water, such as urea from urine.

==Preparation and occurrence==
The compound is generated by treatment of ammonium chloride with calcium hypochlorite. When prepared in an aqueous-dichloromethane mixture, the trichloramine is extracted into the nonaqueous phase. Intermediates in this conversion include monochloramine and dichloramine, and , respectively.

Nitrogen trichloride, trademarked as Agene, was at one time used to bleach flour, but this practice was banned in the United States in 1949 due to safety concerns.

==Structure and properties==
Like ammonia, is a pyramidal molecule. The N-Cl distances are 1.76 Å, and the Cl-N-Cl angles are 107°.

Nitrogen trichloride can form in small amounts when public water supplies are disinfected with monochloramine, and in swimming pools by disinfecting chlorine reacting with urea in urine and sweat from bathers.
==Reactions and uses==
The chemistry of has been well explored. It is moderately polar with a dipole moment of 0.6 D. The nitrogen center is basic but much less so than ammonia. It is hydrolyzed by hot water to release ammonia and hypochlorous acid.
Concentrated samples of NCl3 can explode to give N2 and chlorine gas.

In the presence of aluminium trichloride, NCl3 react with some branch hydrocarbon to produce, after a hydrolysis step, amines.

==Safety==
Nitrogen trichloride can irritate mucous it is a lachrymatory agent, but has never been used as such. The compound (rarely encountered) is a dangerous explosive, being sensitive to light, heat, even moderate shock, and organic compounds. Pierre Louis Dulong first prepared it in 1812, and lost several fingers and an eye in two explosions. In 1813, an explosion blinded Sir Humphry Davy temporarily, inducing him to hire Michael Faraday as a co-worker. They were both injured in another explosion shortly thereafter.

<text>In economics, money illusion, or price illusion, is a cognitive bias where money is thought of in nominal, rather than real terms. In other words, the face value (nominal value) of money is mistaken for its purchasing power (real value) at a previous point in time. Viewing purchasing power as measured by the nominal value is false, as modern fiat currencies have no intrinsic value and their real value depends purely on the price level. The term was coined by Irving Fisher in &quot;Stabilizing the Dollar&quot;. It was popularized by John Maynard Keynes in the early twentieth century, and Irving Fisher wrote an important book on the subject, &quot;The Money Illusion&quot;, in 1928.

The existence of money illusion is disputed by monetary economists who contend that people act rationally (i.e. think in real prices) with regard to their wealth. Eldar Shafir, Peter A. Diamond, and Amos Tversky (1997) have provided empirical evidence for the existence of the effect and it has been shown to affect behaviour in a variety of experimental and real-world situations.

Shafir et al. also state that money illusion influences economic behaviour in three main ways:

*Price stickiness. Money illusion has been proposed as one reason why nominal prices are slow to change even where inflation has caused real prices to fall or costs to rise.
*Contracts and laws are not indexed to inflation as frequently as one would rationally expect.
*Social discourse, in formal media and more generally, reflects some confusion about real and nominal value.

Money illusion can also influence people&#x27;s perceptions of outcomes. Experiments have shown that people generally perceive an approximate 2% cut in nominal income with no change in monetary value as unfair, but see a 2% rise in nominal income where there is 4% inflation as fair, despite them being almost rational equivalents. This result is consistent with the &#x27;Myopic Loss Aversion theory&#x27;. Furthermore, the money illusion means nominal changes in price can influence demand even if real prices have remained constant.

==Explanations and implications==

Explanations of money illusion generally describe the phenomenon in terms of heuristics. Nominal prices provide a convenient rule of thumb for determining value and real prices are only calculated if they seem highly salient (e.g. in periods of hyperinflation or in long term contracts).

Some have suggested that money illusion implies that the negative relationship between inflation and unemployment described by the Phillips curve might hold, contrary to more recent macroeconomic theories such as the &quot;expectations-augmented Phillips curve&quot;. If workers use their nominal wage as a reference point when evaluating wage offers, firms can keep real wages relatively lower in a period of high inflation as workers accept the seemingly high nominal wage increase. These lower real wages would allow firms to hire more workers in periods of high inflation.

Money illusion is believed to be instrumental in the Friedmanian version of the Phillips curve. Actually, money illusion is not enough to explain the mechanism underlying this Phillips curve. It requires two additional assumptions. First, prices respond differently to modified demand conditions: an increased aggregate demand exerts its influence on commodity prices sooner than it does on labour market prices. Therefore, the drop in unemployment is, after all, the result of decreasing real wages and an accurate judgement of the situation by employees is the only reason for the return to an initial (natural) rate of unemployment (i.e. the end of the money illusion, when they finally recognize the actual dynamics of prices and wages). The other (arbitrary) assumption refers to a special informational asymmetry: whatever employees are unaware of in connection with the changes in (real and nominal) wages and prices can be clearly observed by employers. The new classical version of the Phillips curve was aimed at removing the puzzling additional presumptions, but its mechanism still requires money illusion.

<doc id="1041031" wikidata="Q388646" url="?curid=1041031" title="Dracunculiasis">
<text>Dracunculiasis, also called Guinea-worm disease, is a parasitic infection by the Guinea worm, &quot;Dracunculus medinensis&quot;. A person becomes infected by drinking water contaminated with Guinea-worm larvae that reside inside copepods (a type of small crustacean). Stomach acid digests the copepod and releases the Guinea worm, which penetrates the digestive tract and escapes into the body. Around a year later, the adult female migrates to an exit site – usually the lower leg – and induces an intensely painful blister on the skin. Eventually, the blister bursts, creating a painful wound from which the worm gradually emerges over several weeks. The wound remains painful throughout the worm&#x27;s emergence, disabling the affected person for the three to ten weeks it takes the worm to emerge.

There is no medication to treat or prevent dracunculiasis. Instead, the mainstay of treatment is the careful wrapping of the emerging worm around a small stick or gauze to encourage and speed up its exit. Each day, a few more centimeters of the worm emerge, and the stick is turned to maintain gentle tension. Too much tension can break and kill the worm in the wound, causing severe pain and swelling. Dracunculiasis is a disease of extreme poverty, occurring in places with poor access to clean drinking water. Prevention efforts center on filtering drinking water to remove copepods, as well as public education campaigns to discourage people from soaking affected limbs in sources of drinking water, as this allows the worms to spread their larvae.

Accounts consistent with dracunculiasis appear in surviving documents from physicians of Greco-Roman antiquity. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, dracunculiasis was widespread across much of Africa and South Asia, affecting as many as 48 million people per year. The effort to eradicate dracunculiasis began in the 1980s following the successful eradication of smallpox. By 1995, every country with endemic dracunculiasis had established a national eradication program. In the ensuing years, dracunculiasis cases have dropped precipitously, with 14 cases reported worldwide in 2023. Since 1986, 14 previously endemic countries have eradicated dracunculiasis, leaving the disease endemic in six: Angola, Central African Republic, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, and South Sudan. If the eradication program succeeds, dracunculiasis will become the second human disease eradicated, after smallpox. &quot;D. medinensis&quot; can also infect dogs, cats, and baboons, though non-human cases are also falling due to eradication efforts. Other &quot;Dracunculus&quot; species cause dracunculiasis in reptiles worldwide and in mammals in the Americas.

==Cause==
Dracunculiasis is caused by infection with the roundworm &quot;Dracunculus medinensis&quot;. &quot;D. medinensis&quot; larvae reside within small aquatic crustaceans called copepods. Humans typically get infected when they unintentionally ingest copepods while drinking water. In some cases, infected copepods are consumed by fish or frogs, which are then consumed by humans or other animals, passing along the &quot;D. medinensis&quot; larvae. During digestion the copepods die, releasing the &quot;D. medinensis&quot; larvae. The larvae exit the digestive tract by penetrating the stomach and intestine, taking refuge in the abdomen or retroperitoneal space (behind the organs near the back of the abdomen). Over the next two to three months the larvae develop into adult male and female worms. The male remains small at long and wide; the female is comparatively large, often over long and wide. Once the worms reach their adult size they mate, and the male dies. Over the ensuing months, the female migrates to connective tissue or along bones, and continues to develop.

About a year after the initial infection, the female migrates to the skin, forms an ulcer, and emerges. When the wound touches fresh water, the female spews a milky-white substance containing hundreds of thousands of larvae into the water. Over the next several days as the female emerges from the wound, she can continue to discharge larvae into the surrounding water. The larvae are eaten by copepods, and after two to three weeks of development, they are infectious to humans again.

==Signs and symptoms==

The first signs of dracunculiasis occur around a year after infection, as the full-grown female worm prepares to leave the infected person&#x27;s body. As the worm migrates to its exit site – typically the lower leg – some people have allergic reactions, including hives, fever, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Upon reaching its destination, the worm forms a fluid-filled blister under the skin. Over 1–3 days, the blister grows larger, begins to cause severe burning pain, and eventually bursts, leaving a small open wound. The wound remains intensely painful as the worm slowly emerges over several weeks to months.

If an affected person submerges the wound in water, the worm spews a white substance releasing its larvae into the water. As the worm emerges, the open blister often becomes infected with bacteria, resulting in redness and swelling; the formation of abscesses; or, in severe cases, gangrene, sepsis, or tetanus. When the secondary infection is near a joint (typically the ankle), the damage to the joint can result in stiffness, arthritis, or contractures.

Infected people commonly harbor multiple worms – on average 1.8 worms per person, but as many as 40 – which will emerge from separate blisters at the same time. 90% of worms emerge from the legs or feet. However, worms can emerge from anywhere on the body.

==Diagnosis==
Dracunculiasis is diagnosed by visual examination – the thin white worm emerging from the blister is unique to this disease. Dead worms sometimes calcify and can be seen in the subcutaneous tissue by X-ray.

==Treatment==

There is no medicine to kill &quot;D. medinensis&quot; or prevent it from causing disease once within the body. Instead, treatment focuses on slowly and carefully removing the worm from the wound over days to weeks. Once the blister bursts and the worm begins to emerge, the wound is soaked in a bucket of water, allowing the worm to empty itself of larvae away from a source of drinking water. As the first part of the worm emerges, it is typically wrapped around a piece of gauze or a stick to maintain steady tension on the worm, encouraging its exit. Each day, several centimeters of the worm emerge from the blister, and the stick is wound to maintain tension. This is repeated daily until the full worm emerges, typically within a month. If too much pressure is applied, the worm can break and die, leading to severe swelling and pain at the site of the ulcer.

Treatment for dracunculiasis also includes regular wound care to avoid infection of the open ulcer. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends cleaning the wound before the worm emerges. Once the worm begins to exit the body, the CDC recommends daily wound care: cleaning the wound, applying antibiotic ointment, and replacing the bandage with fresh gauze. Painkillers like aspirin or ibuprofen can help ease the pain of the worm&#x27;s exit.

==Outcomes==
Dracunculiasis is a debilitating disease, causing substantial disability in around half of those infected. People with worms emerging can be disabled for the three to ten weeks it takes the worms to fully emerge. When worms emerge near joints, inflammation or infection of the affected area can result in permanent stiffness, pain, or destruction of the joint. Some people with dracunculiasis have continuing pain for 12 to 18 months after the worm has emerged. Around 1% of dracunculiasis cases result in death from secondary infections of the wound.

When dracunculiasis was widespread, it often affected entire villages at once. Outbreaks occurring during planting and harvesting seasons severely impaired a community&#x27;s agricultural operations – earning dracunculiasis the descriptor &quot;empty granary disease&quot; in some places. Communities affected by dracunculiasis also see reduced school attendance as children of affected parents must take over farm or household duties, and affected children may be physically prevented from walking to school for weeks.

Infection does not create immunity, so people can repeatedly experience dracunculiasis throughout their lives.

==Prevention==

There is no vaccine for dracunculiasis, and once infected with &quot;D. medinensis&quot; there is no way to prevent the disease from running its full course. Consequently, efforts to reduce the burden of dracunculiasis focus on preventing the transmission of &quot;D. medinensis&quot; from person to person. A mainstay of eradication efforts is the improvement of drinking water. Nylon filters, finely woven cloth, or specialized filter straws can all remove copepods from drinking water, eliminating transmission risk. Water sources can also be treated with temephos, which kills copepods, and contaminated water can be treated via boiling. Where possible, open sources of drinking water are replaced by deep wells that can serve as new sources of clean water. Public education campaigns inform people in affected areas how dracunculiasis spreads and encourage those with the disease to avoid soaking their wounds in bodies of water that are used for drinking.

==Epidemiology==
Dracunculiasis is now rare, with 14 cases reported worldwide in 2023 and 13 in 2022. This is down from 27 cases in 2020 and dramatically less than the estimated 3.5 million annual cases in 20 countries in 1986 – the year the World Health Assembly called for dracunculiasis&#x27;s eradication. Dracunculiasis remains endemic in three countries: Chad, Mali, and South Sudan.

Dracunculiasis is a disease of extreme poverty, occurring in places where there is poor access to clean drinking water. Cases tend to be split roughly equally between males and females and can occur in all age groups. Within a given place, dracunculiasis risk is linked to occupation; people who farm or fetch drinking water are most likely to be infected.

When dracunculiasis was widespread, it had a seasonal cycle, though the timing varied by location. Along the Sahara desert&#x27;s southern edge, cases peaked during the mid-year rainy season (May–October) when stagnant water sources were more abundant. Along the Gulf of Guinea, cases were more common during the dry season (October–March) when flowing water sources dried up.

==History==
Diseases consistent with the effects of dracunculiasis are referenced by writers throughout antiquity. Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Symposiacon&quot; refers to a (lost) description by the 2nd-century BCE writer Agatharchides concerning a &quot;hitherto unheard-of disease&quot; in which &quot;small worms issue from [people&#x27;s] arms and legs ... insinuating themselves between the muscles [to] give rise to horrible sufferings&quot;. Greco-Roman and Persian physicians, including Galen, Rhazes, and Avicenna, also wrote of diseases consistent with dracunculiasis; though there was some disagreement as to the nature of the disease, with some attributing it to a worm, while others considered it to be a corrupted part of the body emerging.

Some have proposed links between dracunculiasis and other prominent ancient texts and symbols. In a 1674 treatise on dracunculiasis, Georg Hieronymous Velschius ascribed serpentine figures in several ancient icons to &quot;Dracunculus&quot;, including Greek sculptures, signs of the zodiac, Arabic lettering, and the Rod of Asclepius, a common symbol of the medical profession. Similarly, parasitologist Friedrich Küchenmeister proposed in 1855 that the &quot;fiery serpents&quot; that plague the Hebrews in the Old Testament represented dracunculiasis. In 1959, parasitologist Reinhard Hoeppli proposed that a prescription in the Ebers papyrus – a medical text written around 1500 BCE – referred to the removal of a Guinea worm, an identification endorsed ten years later by the physician and Egyptologist Paul Ghalioungui; this would make the Ebers papyrus the oldest known description of the disease.

Carl Linnaeus included the Guinea worm in his 1758 edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, naming it &quot;Gordius medinensis&quot;. The name &quot;medinensis&quot; refers to the worm&#x27;s longstanding association with the Arabian Peninsula city of Medina, with Avicenna writing in his &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot; (published in 1025) &quot;The disease is commonest at Medina, whence it takes its name&quot;. In Johann Friedrich Gmelin&#x27;s 1788 update of Linnaeus&#x27; &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, Gmelin renamed the worm &quot;Filaria medinensis&quot;, leaving &quot;Gordius&quot; for free-living worms. Henry Bastian authored the first detailed description of the worm itself, published in 1863. The following year, in his book &quot;Entozoa&quot;, Thomas Spencer Cobbold used the name &quot;Dracunculus medinensis&quot;, which was enshrined as the official name by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature in 1915. Despite longstanding knowledge that the worm was associated with water, the lifecycle of &quot;D. medinensis&quot; was the topic of protracted debate. Alexei Pavlovich Fedchenko filled a major gap with his 1870 publication describing that &quot;D. medinensis&quot; larvae can infect and develop inside copepods. The next step was shown by Robert Thomson Leiper, who described in a 1907 paper that monkeys fed &quot;D. medinensis&quot;–infected copepods developed mature Guinea worms, while monkeys directly fed &quot;D. medinensis&quot; larvae did not.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, dracunculiasis was widespread across nearly all of Africa and South Asia, though no exact case counts exist from the pre-eradication era. In a 1947 article in the &quot;Journal of Parasitology&quot;, Norman R. Stoll used rough estimates of populations in endemic areas to suggest that there could have been as many as 48 million cases of dracunculiasis per year. In 1976, the WHO estimated the global burden at 10 million cases per year. Ten years later, as the eradication effort was beginning, the WHO estimated 3.5 million cases per year worldwide.

==Eradication==

The campaign to eradicate dracunculiasis began at the urging of the CDC in 1980. Following smallpox eradication (last case in 1977; eradication certified in 1981), dracunculiasis was considered an achievable eradication target since it was preventable with only behavioral changes and less common than many similar diseases of poverty. In 1981, the steering committee for the United Nations International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (a program to improve global drinking water from 1981 to 1990) adopted the goal of eradicating dracunculiasis as part of their efforts. The following June, an international meeting termed &quot;Workshop on Opportunities for Control of Dracunculiasis&quot; concluded that dracunculiasis could be eradicated through public education, drinking water improvement, and larvicide treatments. In response, India began its national eradication program in 1983. 

In 1986, the 39th World Health Assembly issued a statement endorsing dracunculiasis eradication and calling on member states to craft eradication plans. The same year, the Carter Center began collaborating with the government of Pakistan to initiate its national program, which then launched in 1988. By 1996, national eradication programs had been launched in every country with endemic dracunculiasis: Ghana and Nigeria in 1989; Cameroon in 1991; Togo, Burkina Faso, Senegal, and Uganda in 1992; Benin, Mauritania, Niger, Mali, and Côte d&#x27;Ivoire in 1993; Sudan, Kenya, Chad, and Ethiopia in 1994; Yemen and the Central African Republic in 1995.

Each national eradication program had three phases. The first phase consisted of a nationwide search to identify the extent of dracunculiasis transmission and develop national and regional plans of action. The second phase involved the training and distribution of staff and volunteers to provide public education village-by-village, surveil for cases, and deliver water filters. This continued and evolved as needed until the national burden of disease was very low. Then, in a third phase, programs intensified surveillance efforts to identify each case within 24 hours of the worm emerging and preventing the person from contaminating drinking water supplies. Most national programs offered voluntary in-patient centers, where those affected could stay and receive food and care until their worms were removed.

In May 1991, the 44th World Health Assembly called for an international certification system to verify dracunculiasis eradication country-by-country. To this end, in 1995 the WHO established the International Commission for the Certification of Dracunculiasis Eradication (ICCDE). Once a country reports zero cases of dracunculiasis for a calendar year, the ICCDE considers that country to have interrupted Guinea worm transmission, and is then in the &quot;precertification phase&quot;. If the country reports zero cases in each of the next three calendar years, the ICCDE sends a team to the country to assess the country&#x27;s disease surveillance systems and to verify the country&#x27;s reports. The ICCDE can then formally recommend the WHO Director-General certify a country as free of dracunculiasis.

Since the initiation of the global eradication program, the ICCDE has certified 15 of the original endemic countries as having eradicated dracunculiasis: Pakistan in 1997; India in 2000; Senegal and Yemen in 2004; the Central African Republic and Cameroon in 2007; Benin, Mauritania, and Uganda in 2009; Burkina Faso and Togo in 2011; Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Niger, and Nigeria in 2013; and Ghana in 2015. In 2020, the 76th World Health Assembly endorsed a new guidance plan, the &quot;Roadmap for Neglected Tropical Diseases 2021–2030&quot;, which sets a 2027 target for eradication of dracunculiasis, allowing certification by the end of 2030.

==Other animals==
In addition to humans, &quot;D. medinensis&quot; can infect domestic dogs and cats and wild olive baboons. Infections of domestic dogs have been particularly common in Chad, where they helped reignite dracunculiasis transmission in 2010. Animals are thought to become infected by eating a transport host, likely a fish or amphibian. As with humans, control efforts have focused on preventing infection by encouraging people in affected areas to bury fish entrails, as well as to identify and tie up dogs and cats with emerging worms so that they cannot access drinking water sources until after the worms have emerged. Animal infections are rapidly falling, with 2,000 recorded infections in 2019, 1,601 in 2020, and 863 in 2021. Domestic ferrets can be infected with &quot;D. medinensis&quot; in laboratory settings, and have been used as an animal disease model for human dracunculiasis.

Other &quot;Dracunculus&quot; species can infect snakes, turtles, and other reptiles. Animal infections are most widespread in snakes, with nine different species of &quot;Dracunculus&quot; described in snakes in the United States, Brazil, India, Vietnam, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Benin, Madagascar, and Italy. The only other reptiles affected are snapping turtles, with cases of infected common snapping turtles described in several US states and a single infected South American snapping turtle described in Costa Rica. Infections of mammals are limited to the Americas. Raccoons in the US and Canada are most widely impacted, particularly by &quot;D. insignis&quot;; however, &quot;Dracunculus&quot; worms have also been reported in American skunks, coyotes, foxes, opossums, domestic dogs, domestic cats, and (rarely) muskrats and beavers.

<doc id="1041032" wikidata="Q1514126" url="?curid=1041032" title="MS Marco Polo">
<text>MS &quot;Marco Polo was a [[cruise ship]] originally built as [[ocean liner]] Aleksandr Pushkin&quot; in 1965 by Mathias-Thesen-Werft, East Germany for the Soviet Union&#x27;s Baltic Shipping Company. After major alterations and additions, the ship operated as &quot;Marco Polo&quot; for the Orient Lines from 1993 to 2008. It last sailed for UK-based Cruise &amp; Maritime Voyages and its German subsidiary Transocean Tours. After Cruise &amp; Maritime Voyages entered administration in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was sold at auction by CW Kellock &amp; Co. Ltd. for US$2,770,000 on 22 October 2020; it was subsequently resold and in January 2021 was beached at Alang, India and scrapped.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Aleksandr Pushkin&quot; was constructed at VEB Mathias-Thesen-Werft in Wismar, East Germany. She was the second ship of the (also referred to as &quot;poet&quot; or &quot;writer&quot; class), named after the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. The construction of this class featured some notable differences from contemporary ships built in the west. Amongst other things they offered cabins for six people and had three taps in the bathrooms - for hot, cold and sea water - Both of these features had long since been abandoned in western liners. The ships also featured certain forward-looking features, such as all outside accommodation for both passengers and the crew, and an indoor/outdoor swimming pool with a sliding glass roof. To enable the ships to navigate through broken ice, they were constructed with greater hull strength and stability than usual in passenger ships of this size. The &quot;Ivan Franko&quot;-class ships were built with use as troopships in mind. Due to this they had unusually large provision and storage areas, enabling a cruising range of over . As a more visible sign of potential military use, the ships were equipped with unusually powerful deck lifting gear, apparently to be able to transport armoured vehicles on board. As built, the ship carried between 650-766 passengers in two classes, with different sources providing different figures. Additionally there were provisions for 500 cabinless passengers.

According to a deck plan printed for the passenger agency of Helsinki in 1971, the Alexandr Pushkin could carry 668 passengers, 520 in Tourist Class and 148 in First Class. Tourist Class cabin were furnished with either two or four bunks, one or two wardrobe, a sofa, a table and one or two chairs, along with a washing basin; the sanitary facilities were shared among the passengers. These rooms were located on the four lowest decks (B/Promenade Deck, C/Main Deck, Second and Third Deck). In First Class, all staterooms were furnished with two beds or a &quot;sofa bed and upper pullman berth&quot;, a table, a chair, a sofa and a nightstand. They also had a private bathroom with a shower, a toilet and a washing basin. Staterooms 101 to 104 on the Boat Deck, looking towards the bow, were deluxe ones, with a desk and its armchair, their own telephone as well as a bath instead of a shower. On the rear of the Promenade Deck were located staterooms 277 and 279, sharing their full bathroom as these two had baby cribs. All cabins had portholes or windows.
For the passenger facilities, they were located on the upper decks. The restaurant was on the C deck; on the B Deck you would have the &quot;Kalinka&quot; shop, the gymnasium, the sauna bath as well as the children&#x27;s play room and swimming pool. The A Deck, or Saloon Deck, was filled with amenities. For the bow to the stern, you would have : the Music Saloon, with its piano and dance floor; the &quot;North Palmyra Café&quot; and the &quot;Café Penguin&quot;; the &quot;Beriozka&quot; shop and an information kiosk, followed by the post counter; the Cinema; the Smoking Saloon with its &quot;Friendship bar&quot; and play room; the Library; the two hairdressers and finally the Swimming Pool and another bar, the &quot;Rusalka bar&quot; (Mermaid&#x27;s bar). An outside dancing floor was located on the Boat Deck and on the Bridge Deck, there was the Verandah with the &quot;White Nights&quot; bar.

From 1972 onwards the &quot;Ivan Franko&quot;-class ships were rebuilt. In the first stage the cargo facilities were eliminated and the forward superstructure extended, allowing for additional public spaces. Stabilizers were also installed in this stage. In the second stage the cabins were re-configured to include berths for all passengers. In a refit during the 1970s a discothèque was added on board &quot;Aleksandr Pushkin&quot;, making her the first Soviet ship to have one.
==Service history==
===Service as &quot;Aleksandr Pushkin&quot;===

&quot;Aleksandr Pushkin&quot; entered service in 1965 with the Baltic Shipping Company, one of the three principal Soviet passenger shipping companies (the other two being the Black Sea Shipping Company and the Far Eastern Shipping Company). Reports about her service in the Soviet fleet are fragmentary and conflicting, partly due to some information still being classified by the Russians. Most sources state she was used to inaugurate the Baltic Shipping Company&#x27;s regular trans-Atlantic service between Montreal, Quebec, Canada and Leningrad, and later on used for cruising. Other sources give a more detailed, but somewhat conflicting, accounts. Philip Dawson&#x27;s book &quot;The Liner - Retrospective &amp; Renaissance&quot; gives the full route as Leningrad—Helsinki—Copenhagen—London (Tilbury)—Quebec City—Montreal, in addition to which the ship was used for cruising from Montreal to Saint Pierre and Miquelon, The Bahamas and Cuba during the summer months. According to the book, the ship carried just 36 passengers on her first transatlantic crossing. According to Cruisepage.com, she spent only the summer months on Leningrad—Montreal service, while the rest of the year she was used either on crossing from Leningrad to Havana, Cuba or cruising under charter to western companies. Fakta om Fartyg offers a somewhat different account, stating that the ship originally entered service as a cruise ship in 1965, moving to the Leningrad—Montreal route in only April 1966, then spending summers from 1967 until 1979 in Leningrad—Bremerhaven—Montreal route and the rest of the year cruising, and from 1979 exclusively on cruise traffic. It does seem likely the ship called in Helsinki and London on her transatlantic crossings, as according to an article in Helsingin Sanomat &quot;Alexandr Pushkin&quot; was popular amongst Finnish passengers sailing to London and Canada; she was the only ship offering crossings from Finland to Canada and the only liner in Helsinki—London service at the time. Although not mentioned in any source, photographic evidence shows that &quot;Aleksandr Pushkin&quot;″s superstructure was enlarged during her 1972 rebuilding, with the forward superstructure expanded and rear promenade decks built in.

&quot;Aleksandr Pushkin&quot; was chartered to the West Germany-based Transocean Tours in 1979, ending her transatlantic service. At this point she was one of just three passenger liners in transatlantic service, alongside Cunard Line&#x27;s &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; and Polish Ocean Lines&#x27; &quot;Stefan Batory&quot;. In addition to the liner and cruise service, two sources mention that &quot;Alexandr Pushkin&quot; was also used in service of the Soviet Navy, particularly in interventions into African countries.

In 1985, her charter to Transocean Tours ended and &quot;Aleksandr Pushkin&quot; was transferred from the Baltic Shipping Company to the Far Eastern Shipping Company, who promptly chartered her to CTC Cruises for cruising from Europe and Australia. In 1990, her charter to CTC Cruises ended and she was laid up at Singapore. In 1991, the ship was sold to Orient Lines - the brainchild of cruise lines and hotels entrepreneur Gerry Herrod - and renamed &quot;Marco Polo&quot;.
===Service as &quot;Marco Polo&quot;===
Following the purchase by Orient Lines, &quot;Marco Polo&quot; sailed to Neorion Shipyard, Greece, where her engines were reconditioned by Sulzer Diesels. Following this she was moved to Perama Shipyard, Greece, where a near-total reconstruction of the ship commenced. Externally this resulted in notable extension of the rear superstructure and heightening of the funnel to maintain the proportions of the ship. Internally the ship was almost entirely rebuilt under the guidance of naval architect Knud Hansen and interior designers Michael and Agni Katzourakis. In addition to the more visual changes, the ship was fitted with Denny Brown stabilizers, additional diesel engines and brought up to the latest IMO and SOLAS standards. The refit took 2 years; various sources estimate the cost as between US$20m and $60m.

In 1993, following completions of the conversion, &quot;Marco Polo&quot; began a varying itinerary of cruises all over the world, including more unusual destinations such as South-East Asia, Africa, and Antarctica. In 1998, Orient Lines was sold to Norwegian Cruise Lines. &quot;Marco Polo&quot;″s cruises continued as before, but as a result of the NCL deal MS &quot;Crown Odyssey&quot; joined her in the Orient Lines fleet in 2000, turning the company into a two-ship brand. However, &quot;Crown Odyssey&quot; left the Orient fleet in 2003, and &quot;Marco Polo&quot; became again the sole ship of the brand. Since 2005 she has also been the sole surviving &quot;Ivan Franko&quot;-class vessel, the other sisters having sunk or been scrapped.In 2008 Norwegian Cruise Line sold &quot;Marco Polo&quot; to the Greece-based Global Maritime Group, which chartered the ship to the Germany-based Transocean Tours. &quot;Marco Polo&quot; replaced MS &quot;Arielle&quot; in the Transocean Tours fleet, operating cruises out of the United Kingdom and Germany. The sale of &quot;Marco Polo&quot; also meant the end of the Orient Lines brand. Transocean Tours said that they planned to operate the ship until 2012 at least.

On 6 July 2009 &quot;Marco Polo&quot; called at Invergordon, Easter Ross, Scotland on a cruise outbound from Tilbury in Essex. During a health inspection by the local port health officials up to 150 passengers were discovered to have been infected with what was presumed to be norovirus; the number of infected passengers and crew subsequently rose to 400. Also on 6 July a 74-year-old passenger died of a heart attack on board the ship. According to reports from the local health officials he had serious underlying health problems, and it was not known if a norovirus infection contributed to his death. On 7 July Transocean Tours decided to cancel the remainder of &quot;Marco Polo&quot;″s ten-day cruise after consulting NHS Highland. Reportedly the company gave the passengers an option to either stay with the ship until she returned to Tilbury on 11 July or to return to their homes earlier by a specially arranged charter train. On 8 July three infected people remained in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness.

Some reports indicate that passengers on board &quot;Marco Polo&quot;″s previous cruise, which terminated in Tilbury on 4 July, might also have been infected with norovirus. However, according to Transocean Tours the ship was inspected upon return to Tilbury and no infections were found, although some passengers during the cruise did suffer from gastroenteritis. The London Port Health Authority stated that they were not informed of illness on board the ship when it docked at Tilbury, and Transocean Tours could consequently face legal action.

Despite Transocean Tours&#x27; intention of keeping the ship in its fleet until 2012, reports emerged in August 2009 that &quot;Marco Polo&quot; would be chartered to the newly founded, UK-based Cruise &amp; Maritime Voyages for five years from 2 January 2010. Her planned itineraries included cruises from the UK to South America during the northern hemisphere winter months, and from the UK to Northern Europe and the Mediterranean during the summer months.

On 13 March 2013 Cruise &amp; Maritime voyages announced that &quot;Marco Polo&quot; would be terminating one of her northern lights cruises and go into dry dock for inspection and minor repairs after striking an uncharted object under command of the local pilot minutes after sailing from Sortland on 9 March 2013. Her cruise terminated in Antwerp with passengers being transferred to Tilbury and London via the Channel Tunnel or ferry by coach.

On 14 February 2014 a passenger died and sixteen people were injured after a freak wave struck the ship in the English Channel during a storm. One seriously injured passenger was taken off by helicopter. The ship was heading to Tilbury with 735 passengers and 349 crew on board.

&quot;Marco Polo&quot; has been the subject of a television programme in the series &quot;Mighty Cruise Ships&quot; (a spin-off of &quot;Mighty Ships&quot;) which documented the 2013 voyage to St Petersburg, Russia, and the Baltic States. The ship ran into a force 10 gale in The Baltic.

On 1 November 2014, while docking at the port of Leknes in Lofoten, Norway, a strong breeze sent the cruise ship off course, resulting in the ship running aground at coordinates .

On 20 July 2020, Cruise &amp; Maritime Voyages entered administration. The company&#x27;s administrators sold &quot;Marco Polo&quot; at auction for US$2,770,000 on 22 October 2020. Plans for Offshore Solutions Unlimited to return her to service were not realised, nor were announced plans by the buyer, Highseas Ltd., to convert her into a floating hotel in Dubai. She was resold two months later for approximately $4 million to an Indian company, reached the scrapyards of Alang, India on 13 January 2021 and was beached and scrapped. Scrapping commenced on 28 March 2021.

<text>Ambassador College (1947–1997) was a four-year liberal arts college run by the Worldwide Church of God. The college was established in 1947 in Pasadena, California, by radio evangelist Herbert W. Armstrong, leader of what was then the Radio Church of God, later renamed the Worldwide Church of God. The college was approved by the State of California to grant degrees.

In 1960 a second campus was opened at Bricket Wood, Hertfordshire, England, and in 1964 a third campus was opened in Big Sandy, Texas. At the time Ambassador closed for financial reasons in May 1997, it had operated for 50 years and had become regionally accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

==History==
The history of Ambassador College was tied to the development of the Radio/Worldwide Church of God. The name &quot;Radio Church of God&quot; was initially selected in the 1930s, because Herbert Armstrong started the church as a radio program in Eugene, Oregon. The ministry grew to include publishing, and congregations were formed, first in the United States and then gradually in other countries—hence, the eventual name change to &quot;Worldwide Church of God.&quot;

After Armstrong moved his operations to California, he founded Ambassador College in 1947. The college began acquiring lavish mansions on Orange Grove Blvd. in Pasadena, culminating in the acquisition of the Hulett C. Merritt mansion, formerly belonging to an iron ore mining magnate, in the late 1950s. Hulett Merritt was the chairman of US Steel and made his millions on the Mesabi Iron Range in Minnesota. Hulett Merritt&#x27;s estate &quot;Villa Merritt Ollivier&quot; in Pasadena was built on four acres for $1,100,000 during 1905–08. This area on South Orange Grove Avenue was referred to locally as &quot;Millionaires&#x27; Row&quot;, per the City of Pasadena&#x27;s Architectural and Historical Survey of 1997. Mr. Merritt&#x27;s mansion was at 99 Terrace Drive, bounded on the north by Olcott Place and on the west by South Orange Grove Avenue. After Hulett Sr.&#x27;s death in January 1956, the property was purchased by Herbert W. Armstrong from Hulett&#x27;s four surviving grandchildren in October 1956, because it was adjacent to Ambassador College. Villa Merritt Ollivier was renamed &quot;Ambassador Hall&quot;, and Ambassador College subsequently obtained permission to close Terrace Drive. Thereafter, the residence and street address for the former Villa Merritt Ollivier was renamed Ambassador Hall, 100 S. Orange Grove Blvd., Pasadena.

This mansion, with a sunken Italian garden, a rosewood-paneled room, and a basement swimming pool, became the campus centerpiece until the Auditorium was built. The college built two modern classroom buildings flanking Ambassador Hall, and the formal Italian sunken garden, with a plaza in the center, joined the three buildings and the garden into an academic center. Hulett Sr.&#x27;s former mansion was featured as the opening scene in the old TV show &quot;The Millionaire&quot;, looking upward from the tree-lined steps towards the hill with the mansion and towering palms above. The Pasadena 1997 Architectural Survey stated at Page 2.1–33: &quot;The Hulett C. Merritt&#x27; House is significant as the residence of one of Pasadena&#x27;s most celebrated millionaires and foremost residents of South Orange Grove Blvd.&quot;

The college was designed to prepare youth for life and service in the church. In the earliest days of Ambassador, male students frequently graduated into the ministry of the church. By the 1970s, that occurred less often. As the church grew in membership in the 1960s and 1970s, a smaller and smaller proportion of applicants could be accepted, some applicants having to wait years for acceptance.

The motto of the college was &quot;Recapturing True Values&quot;. Although most students of the college were associated with the church, it was not a strict requirement. Nonetheless, the students and faculty were primarily those with church affiliation.

Throughout most of its history, Ambassador operated under state approval or its international equivalent. Regional accreditation was not sought, primarily because it required that the college have a functioning board that was separate and distinct from the church&#x27;s administration. Armstrong resisted this requirement, apparently concerned that such a separation would result in the truth of God, as he believed it to be and taught it, being watered down at an Ambassador that would become increasingly secular. He held this opinion despite the fact that numerous accredited colleges and universities around the country were operated by the Catholic Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and other Christian denominations without those organizations being required to alter church teachings.

The final phase of Ambassador began in the late 1970s and was characterized by constant uncertainty and indecision. The Ambassador campus at Bricket Wood, Hertfordshire, England, was closed in 1974, as operating funds were deemed necessary for other functions of the Worldwide Church of God. For similar reasons, the Texas campus was shuttered in 1977, and all students who wished to be were offered the opportunity to transfer to the original campus in Pasadena, California. In the interim, the decision had been made by church leadership to pursue regional accreditation in California. However, in 1978 President Garner Ted Armstrong, son of college founder Herbert Armstrong, announced that everything would be moving back to the Texas campus, with the California facility becoming a graduate school. Within months, however, the younger Armstrong was ousted from all positions in the church and college owing to an unrelated scandal, and Herbert Armstrong, recovered from a heart attack, announced that Ambassador was closing its doors altogether.

That stance was softened just as quickly, however, and the decision was made to continue operating Ambassador as a scaled-down academic institution more in line with a bible college. Beginning in August 1978, new incoming students were offered a one-year course (&quot;Diploma in Biblical Studies&quot;), with graduation thereafter, on September 4, 1979. Eventually, Ambassador returned to full four-year status, operating with state approval, but still without regional accreditation. Accreditation was something Armstrong did not agree with.

In 1981, Herbert Armstrong decided to reopen the Texas campus, which was still owned by the church. In 1985 he decided to close that campus again. In January 1986 Armstrong died, and his successor as church leader, Joseph W. Tkach, decided to keep the Texas campus open.

The roller coaster of closings and openings was possible only because Ambassador was not regionally accredited. State approval to grant degrees (a requirement in most states, including California and Texas) is all that had been sought by the institution.

However, the dynamics of higher education in the United States soon began to have an effect on independent, unaccredited colleges like Ambassador. For many years, regional accreditation was not required for colleges to open in various states—only state approval was needed. By the late 1980s, however, many states began to require that a college, after having operated for a certain number of years, would have to either move from state approval to regional accreditation or be closed. Ambassador was at a crossroads, in that it had to seek regional accreditation or be reduced to a bible college offering diplomas rather than recognized degrees or else close its doors for good. 

The board of regents of Ambassador, still consisting of members of the Worldwide Church of God, decided to merge all operations at one location and seek regional accreditation. The decision was made to separate the college from the church&#x27;s base of operations in California and move all college operations to the Big Sandy, Texas, campus. The California college closed permanently in 1990. Students at the Pasadena campus and many faculty members who were pursuing advanced degrees were transferred to the Big Sandy campus, which was in the midst of a construction boom to accommodate the influx of new personnel and to support the regional accreditation efforts.

Ambassador College at Big Sandy, Texas, began the process of applying for regional accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Accreditation was granted in 1994. That same year the college underwent a name change to &quot;Ambassador University.&quot; This new period of transformation was short-lived, however. For decades Ambassador did not have an endowment fund separate from the church. School officials had begun the process of establishing the first dedicated operating endowment in Ambassador&#x27;s history, but there was not sufficient time to build the endowment. Doctrinal controversy within the Worldwide Church of God led to numerous splits and church spinoffs, and the resulting decrease in membership and contributions to the church led to a rapid decline in the annual financial subsidy the church had historically provided to the university. In December 1996 the university&#x27;s board of regents voted to close the institution once and for all. In May 1997, with the university having just concluded its 50th anniversary year, Ambassador closed its doors. 
However, the Ambassador College legacy lived on in the form of Grace Communion Seminary (an educational institution affiliated with
Grace Communion International (GCI), a member of the National Association of 
Evangelicals). Grace Communion Seminary is a business name of Ambassador College
(AC), and a California non-profit religious corporation with federal 501(c)(3) status, 
founded in 1947 at Pasadena, California, as a church-related liberal arts college.
In 1990 AC transferred its student body to an affiliated campus in Texas.
In 2003 Ambassador College, doing business as Ambassador College of 
Christian Ministry, began offering courses online in areas of biblical studies, 
theology, and Christian ministry, providing a diploma and a graduate program.
Since 2005 the diploma program, under the name of Ambassador College of 
Christian Ministry, has continued as a GCI training program in Christian ministry,
administered under the auspices of the GCI affiliate in Australia at
www.ambascol.org.
Grace Communion Seminary, administered from Glendora, California, 
limits its educational programs to graduate level courses in pastoral ministry. All
programs are open to academically qualified men and women who desire to 
expand their education in biblical studies and theology and their service in 
pastoral ministry in the evangelical tradition.

==Pasadena campus (1947–1990)==

Aside from being the identified sponsor of &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; radio broadcast for a time (although the costs for the broadcast were paid by the church), the college in Pasadena became locally well known for its Ambassador Auditorium worship and concert venue, which for 20 years was host to many renowned artists from classical music to jazz. The concert series closed in 1995. The auditorium was largely unused for a decade until a portion of the Ambassador campus was sold to interdenominational Maranatha High School and a smaller portion, including the auditorium, to HRock Church.

In September 2006, the Pasadena City Council approved the redevelopment of the remaining Ambassador campus space into the &quot;Westgate Pasadena&quot; complex, a large mixed-use development consisting of 820 condos and apartments as well as of commercial space. In June 2008, a large portion of a related project on the other side of the freeway was foreclosed. The Westgate project was unaffected.

In the Fall of 2010, TBS released the Glory Daze about 1980s college life which was filmed in the buildings and on the campus of the former Ambassador College in Pasadena. In 2013, TBS released the reality show King of the Nerds, also filmed on the campus.

The former Fine Arts and Science buildings were demolished in 2013 with the Hall of Administration following suit in early 2016.

==Bricket Wood, UK campus (1960–1974)==
The Bricket Wood campus operated for 14 years at Hanstead House, a few miles north of London. The estate had belonged to 
Annie Henrietta Yule and her daughter Gladys, who used it for their Arabian horse breeding farm, the Hanstead Stud. The college operated in the house and grounds for fourteen years. Leading administrators on the campus included Ernest L. Martin, Roderick C. Meredith, Ronald L. Dart, and Raymond F. McNair.

It closed in 1974, and was sold shortly thereafter to the Central Electricity Generating Board. It was used as a management training facility, first by CEGB and then HSBC, closing in 2011. It is currently being developed for housing.

==Big Sandy, Texas campus (1964–1977, 1981–1997)==
The history of the Big Sandy campus can be divided into seven periods:
#Its use by the Radio Church of God as a festival center for the Feast of Tabernacles, a local church congregation site, and Imperial Schools campus (1952–1974),
#The initial period that the campus was open as a four-year college, 1964–1977,
#The period in which the college was closed but continued to be used as a church meeting site, 1977–1981,
#The reopening of the facility as a two-year junior college, 1981–1989,
#The return of the facility as a four-year college (as a consolidated campus), 1989–1997,
#Its closure in 1997, after which it remained vacant until it was sold in 2001 to the Green Family Trust of Oklahoma City (owners of Hobby Lobby stores), and
#Its donation in 2001 to the Institute in Basic Life Principles, which opened it as the training facility for its International ALERT Academy, and later relocated its operations from the Chicago area to the facility.

The Big Sandy campus opened in the fall of 1964. Since the early 1950s, the campus had been used as a location for the annual Feast of Tabernacles. The campus closed in the fall of 1977, with students and faculty transferred to the Pasadena campus.

During the period from 1977 to 1981, the campus was used as a feast site and was used by the local congregation of the Worldwide Church of God. After several near sales of the property, the decision was made to reopen in the fall of 1981.

For a while, the Big Sandy campus included an organic farm, consistent with the college&#x27;s emphasis upon personal health and bodily purity.

When the campus reopened, it initially served as a two-year junior college, with students having the opportunity to apply to transfer to Pasadena after two years. In the fall of 1989, the campus returned to a four-year format.

In the fall of 1990, students and staff from Pasadena were transferred, as plans were underway to seek accreditation. Numerous buildings were constructed almost overnight, including five dormitories, an administration building, a music building and lecture hall, and an office building. Accreditation was achieved in the summer of 1994. However, doctrinal division began to occur a year later in December 1995, ultimately leading to the closure of the campus in 1997.

The campus now serves as the headquarters of the Institute in Basic Life Principles and several of its umbrella ministries, and was used to accommodate refugees from Hurricane Katrina in the fall of 2005. The campus golf course, renamed Embassy Hills Golf Course, is now open to the public.

==AICF – Ambassador International Cultural Foundation==
Ambassador College also sponsored archaeological excavations in Israel. Together with a related Ambassador International Cultural Foundation it sponsored both the Ambassador Auditorium concert series and many appearances by Herbert Armstrong in the company of world statesmen and women. The two organizations also jointly sponsored educational projects in Thailand, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Jordan.
Armstrong International Cultural Foundation is a non-profit, humanitarian organization sponsored by the Philadelphia Church of God and headquartered on the Herbert W. Armstrong College campus in Edmond, Oklahoma.

The two-pronged concept behind all of the foundation&#x27;s goals and activities is: 1) that man is a unique being, possessing vast mental, physical and spiritual potentials—the development of which should be aided and encouraged, and 2) that it is the responsibility of all men to attend to and care for the needs of their fellow men, a precept professed by the vast majority of religions of the world—appropriately summed up in three biblical words: “Love thy neighbor.”

The foundation has sponsored several activities in Jerusalem. In 2006, the foundation began supplying volunteers and aid to Dr. Eilat Mazar&#x27;s ground-breaking excavation of King David&#x27;s palace in Jerusalem. It has also helped refurbish Liberty Bell Park in the heart of the city, a project Herbert W. Armstrong had started

==Successor institutions==
Several Ambassador graduates and former administrators have led efforts to replicate the school in other settings.

When Ambassador closed in 1997, the Worldwide Church of God established the Ambassador Center at Azusa Pacific University. This later gave way to the online Ambassador College of Christian Ministry, which was headed by Ambassador&#x27;s last president, Russell K. Duke. The graduate program was given then name Grace Communion Seminary. Russell Duke was the president until 2015; Gary W. Deddo was the president until December 2021. Michael Morrison is now the President.

Former WCG minister Gerald Flurry established Imperial College in Edmond, Oklahoma, based a great deal on the Ambassador model. To avoid confusion with Imperial College of London, the school is now Herbert W. Armstrong College. One of the campus landmarks is a rock considered to have been used by Herbert W. Armstrong as a &quot;prayer rock&quot; when he lived in Oregon. The campus&#x27; Armstrong Auditorium features two Baccarat candelabra purchased from Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena in 2004, and a bronze swan sculpture (Swans in Flight by Sir David Wynne) purchased from the Big Sandy campus in 2009. In 2015, a second HWAC campus was opened at Edstone, U.K., near Stratford-Upon-Avon.

The United Church of God established the Ambassador Bible College at its Ohio headquarters. The program is not accredited.

Garner Ted Armstrong, president of Ambassador from 1975 to 1978, established Imperial Academy in Tyler, Texas. However, student enrollment was quite small and the program is now defunct.

Roderick C. Meredith established the online Living University in the fall of 2007. The university is based at the Living Church of God&#x27;s headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. The chief executive officer is Dr. Michael P. Germano, former vice president of academic affairs at Ambassador.

<doc id="1041043" wikidata="Q412967" url="?curid=1041043" title="Nafion">
<text>Nafion is a brand name for a sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene based fluoropolymer-copolymer synthesized in 1962 by Dr. Donald J. Connolly at the DuPont Experimental Station in Wilmington Delaware (U.S. Patent 3,282,875). Additional work on the polymer family was performed in the late 1960s by Dr. Walther Grot of DuPont. Nafion is a brand of the Chemours company. It is the first of a class of synthetic polymers with ionic properties that are called ionomers. Nafion&#x27;s unique ionic properties are a result of incorporating perfluorovinyl ether groups terminated with sulfonate groups onto a tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) backbone. Nafion has received a considerable amount of attention as a proton conductor for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells because of its excellent chemical and mechanical stability in the harsh conditions of this application.

The chemical basis of Nafion&#x27;s ion-conductive properties remain a focus of extensive research. Ion conductivity of Nafion increases with the level of hydration. Exposure of Nafion to a humidified environment or liquid water increases the amount of water molecules associated with each sulfonic acid group. The hydrophilic nature of the ionic groups attract water molecules, which begin to solvate the ionic groups and dissociate the protons from the -SO3H (sulfonic acid) group. The dissociated protons &quot;hop&quot; from one acid site to another through mechanisms facilitated by the water molecules and hydrogen bonding. Upon hydration, Nafion phase-separates at nanometer length scales resulting in formation of an interconnected network of hydrophilic domains which allow movement of water and cations, but the membranes do not conduct electrons and minimally conduct anions due to permselectivity (charge-based exclusion). Nafion can be manufactured with or exchanged to alternate cation forms for different applications (e.g. lithiated for Li-ion batteries) and at different equivalent weights (EWs), alternatively considered as ion-exchange capacities (IECs), to achieve a range of cationic conductivities with trade-offs to other physicochemical properties such as water uptake and swelling.

==Nomenclature and molecular weight==
Nafion can be produced as both a powder resin and a copolymer. It has various chemical configurations and thus several chemical names in the IUPAC system. Nafion-H, for example, includes the following systematic names:
* From Chemical Abstracts: ethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2-[1-[difluoro-[(trifluoroethenyl)oxy]methyl]-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethoxy]-1,1,2,2,-tetrafluoro-, with tetrafluoroethylene
* acid copolymer

The molecular weight of Nafion is variable due to differences in processing and solution morphology. The structure of a Nafion unit illustrates the variability of the material; for example, the most basic monomer contains chain variation between the ether groups (the z subscript). Conventional methods of determining molecular weight such as light scattering and gel permeation chromatography are not applicable because Nafion is insoluble, although the molecular weight has been estimated at 105–106 Da. Instead, the equivalent weight (EW) and material thickness are used to describe most commercially available membranes. The EW is the number of grams of dry Nafion per mole of sulfonic acid groups when the material is in the acid form. Nafion membranes are commonly categorized in terms of their EW and thickness. For example, Nafion 117 indicates an extrusion-cast membrane with 1100 g/mol EW and 0.007 inches (7 thou) in thickness. In contrast to equivalent weight, conventional ion-exchange resins are usually described in terms of their ion exchange capacity (IEC), which is the multiplicative inverse or reciprocal of the equivalent weight, i.e., IEC = 1000/EW.

==Preparation==
Nafion derivatives are first synthesized by the copolymerization of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) (the monomer in Teflon) and a derivative of a perfluoro (alkyl vinyl ether) with sulfonyl acid fluoride. The latter reagent can be prepared by the pyrolysis of its respective oxide or carboxylic acid to give the olefinated structure.

The resulting product is an -SO2F-containing thermoplastic that is extruded into films. Hot aqueous NaOH converts these sulfonyl fluoride (-SO2F) groups into sulfonate groups (-SO3−Na+). This form of Nafion, referred to as the neutral or salt form, is finally converted to the acid form containing the sulfonic acid (-SO3H) groups. Nafion can be dispersed into solution by heating in aqueous alcohol at 250 °C in an autoclave for subsequent casting into thin films or use as polymeric binder in electrodes. By this process, Nafion can be used to generate composite films, coat electrodes, or repair damaged membranes.

==Properties==
The combination of the stable PTFE backbone with the acidic sulfonic groups gives Nafion its characteristics:
* It is highly conductive to cations, making it suitable for many membrane applications.
* It resists chemical attack. According to Chemours, only alkali metals (particularly sodium) can degrade Nafion under normal temperatures and pressures.
* The PTFE backbone interlaced with the ionic sulfonate groups gives Nafion a high chemical stability temperature (e.g. 190 °C) but a softening point in the range of 85-100 °C give it a moderate operating temperature, e.g. up to 100 °C, with additional challenges in all applications due to the loss of water above 100 °C.
* It is a superacid catalyst. The combination of fluorinated backbone, sulfonic acid groups, and the stabilizing effect of the polymer matrix make Nafion a very strong acid, with pKa ~ -6. In this respect Nafion resembles the trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, CF3SO3H, although Nafion is a weaker acid by at least three orders of magnitude.
* It is selectively and highly permeable to water.
* Its proton conductivity up to 0.2 S/cm depending on temperature, hydration state, thermal history and processing conditions.
* The solid phase and the aqueous phase of Nafion are both permeable to gases, which is a drawback for energy conversion devices such as artificial leaves, fuel cells, and water electrolyzers.

==Structure/morphology==
The morphology of Nafion membranes is a matter of continuing study to allow for greater control of its properties. Other properties such as water management, hydration stability at high temperatures, electro-osmotic drag, as well as the mechanical, thermal, and oxidative stability, are affected by the Nafion structure. A number of models have been proposed for the morphology of Nafion to explain its unique transport properties.
The first model for Nafion, called the cluster-channel or cluster-network model, consisted of an equal distribution of sulfonate ion clusters (also described as &#x27;inverted micelles&#x27;) with a 40 Å (4 nm) diameter held within a continuous fluorocarbon lattice. Narrow channels about 10 Å (1 nm) in diameter interconnect the clusters, which explains the transport properties.

The difficulty in determining the exact structure of Nafion stems from inconsistent solubility and crystalline structure among its various derivatives. Advanced morphological models have included a core-shell model where the ion-rich core is surrounded by an ion poor shell, a rod model where the sulfonic groups arrange into crystal-like rods, and a sandwich model where the polymer forms two layers whose sulfonic groups attract across an aqueous layer where transport occurs. Consistency between the models include a network of ionic clusters; the models differ in the cluster geometry and distribution. Although no model has yet been determined fully correct, some scientists have demonstrated that as the membrane hydrates, Nafion&#x27;s morphology transforms from the cluster-channel model to a rod-like model.

A cylindrical-water channel model was also proposed based on simulations of small-angle X-ray scattering data and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance studies. In this model, the sulfonic acid functional groups self-organize into arrays of hydrophilic water channels, each ~ 2.5 nm in diameter, through which small ions can be easily transported. Interspersed between the hydrophilic channels are hydrophobic polymer backbones that provide the observed mechanical stability. Many recent studies, however, favored a phase-separated nanostructure consisting of locally-flat, or ribbon-like, hydrophilic domains based on evidence from direct-imaging studies and more comprehensive analysis of the structure and transport properties. 

==Applications==
Nafion&#x27;s properties make it suitable for a broad range of applications. Nafion has found use in fuel cells, electrochemical devices, chlor-alkali production, metal-ion recovery, water electrolysis, plating, surface treatment of metals, batteries, sensors, Donnan dialysis cells, drug release, gas drying or humidification, and superacid catalysis for the production of fine chemicals. Nafion is also often cited for theoretical potential (i.e., thus far untested) in a number of fields. With consideration of Nafion&#x27;s wide functionality, only the most significant will be discussed below.

===Chlor-alkali production cell membrane===
Chlorine and sodium/potassium hydroxide are among the most produced commodity chemicals in the world. Modern production methods produce Cl2 and NaOH/KOH from the electrolysis of brine using a Nafion membrane between half-cells. Before the use of Nafion, industries used mercury containing sodium amalgam to separate sodium metal from cells or asbestos diaphragms to allow for transfer of sodium ions between half cells; both technologies were developed in the latter half of the 19th century. The disadvantages of these systems is worker safety and environmental concerns associated with mercury and asbestos, economical factors also played a part, and in the diaphragm process chloride contamination of the hydroxide product. Nafion was the direct result of the chlor-alkali industry addressing these concerns; Nafion could tolerate the high temperatures, high electrical currents, and corrosive environment of the electrolytic cells.

The figure to the right shows a chlor-alkali cell where Nafion functions as a membrane between half cells. The membrane allows sodium ions to transfer from one cell to the other with minimal electrical resistance. The membrane was also reinforced with additional membranes to prevent gas product mixing and minimize back transfer of Cl− and −OH ions.

===Proton exchange membrane (PEM) for fuel cells===
Although fuel cells have been used since the 1960s as power supplies for satellites, recently they have received renewed attention for their potential to efficiently produce clean energy from hydrogen. Nafion was found effective as a membrane for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells by permitting hydrogen ion transport while preventing electron conduction. Solid Polymer Electrolytes, which are made by connecting or depositing electrodes (usually noble metal) to both sides of the membrane, conduct the electrons through an energy requiring process and rejoin the hydrogen ions to react with oxygen and produce water. Fuel cells are expected to find strong use in the transportation industry.

===Superacid catalyst for fine chemical production===
Nafion, as a superacid, has potential as a catalyst for organic synthesis. Studies have demonstrated catalytic properties in alkylation, isomerization, oligomerization, acylation, ketalization, esterification, hydrolysis of sugars and ethers, and oxidation. New applications are constantly being discovered. These processes, however, have not yet found strong commercial use. Several examples are shown below:

====Alkylation with alkyl halides====
Nafion-H gives efficient conversion whereas the alternative method, which employs Friedel-Crafts synthesis, can promote polyalkylation:

====Acylation====
The amount of Nafion-H needed to catalyze the acylation of benzene with aroyl chloride is 10–30% less than the Friedel-Crafts catalyst:

====Catalysis of protection groups====
Nafion-H increases reaction rates of protection via dihydropyran or o-trialkylsilation of alcohols, phenol, and carboxylic acids.

====Isomerization====
Nafion can catalyze a 1,2-hydride shift.

It is possible to immobilize enzymes within the Nafion by enlarging pores with lipophilic salts. Nafion maintains a structure and pH to provide a stable environment for the enzymes. Applications include catalytic oxidation of adenine dinucleotides.

===Sensors===
Nafion has found use in the production of sensors, with application in ion-selective, metallized, optical, and biosensors. What makes Nafion especially interesting is its demonstration in biocompatibility. Nafion has been shown to be stable in cell cultures as well as the human body, and there is considerable research towards the production of higher sensitivity glucose sensors.

===Antimicrobial surfaces===
Nafion surfaces show an exclusion zone against bacteria colonization. Moreover, layer-by-layer coatings comprising Nafion show excellent antimicrobial properties.

=== Dehumidification in spacecraft===
The SpaceX Dragon 2 human-rated spacecraft uses Nafion membranes to dehumidify the cabin air. One side of the membrane is exposed to the cabin atmosphere, the other to the vacuum of space. This results in dehumidification since Nafion is permeable to water molecules but not air. This saves power and complexity since cooling is not required (as needed with a condensing dehumidifier), and the removed water is rejected to space with no additional mechanism needed.

== Modified Nafion for PEM fuel cells ==

Normal Nafion will dehydrate (thus lose proton conductivity) when the temperature is above ~80 °C. This limitation troubles the design of fuel cells because higher temperatures are desirable for better efficiency and CO tolerance of the platinum catalyst. Silica and zirconium phosphate can be incorporated into Nafion water channels through &quot;in situ&quot; chemical reactions to increase the working temperature to above 100 °C.

<text>A Man in Full is the second novel by Tom Wolfe, published on November 12, 1998, by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. It is set primarily in Atlanta, with a significant portion of the story also taking place in the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area.

==Summary==
&quot;A Man In Full&quot; is a bitingly satirical novel (Juvenalian Satire) set in Georgia in the late 20th century. It tells the story of characters, black and white, from Georgia&#x27;s various social and economic classes. These include Charles &quot;Cap&#x27;m Charlie&quot; Croker, a real estate mogul and member of Atlanta&#x27;s high society who is suddenly facing bankruptcy; Martha Croker, his first wife, trying to maintain her social standing without her husband; Ray Peepgass, who is trying illegally to capitalize on Croker&#x27;s fall; Roger &quot;Too White&quot; White II, a prominent black lawyer; and Conrad Hensley, a young man in prison who discovers Stoic philosophy (Epictetus).

The novel begins with the characters learning of the rumored rape of a young white heiress by a black superstar athlete, Fareek &quot;The Cannon&quot; Fanon. Though the incident is unimportant to the lives of the characters, the potential for the rumor to incite race riots in metropolitan Atlanta has a profound effect on all of their lives. Local politics and business interests become involved, including the president of the bank to which Croker is indebted, Roger Too White&#x27;s former fraternity brother (now mayor of Atlanta), and the entirety of &quot;respectable&quot; Atlanta society.

&quot;A Man In Full&quot; is written much in the style of Wolfe&#x27;s other fictions, such as &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; and &quot;I Am Charlotte Simmons&quot;.

==Reactions==
Released eleven years after Wolfe&#x27;s bestselling novel &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;, &quot;A Man in Full&quot; was widely anticipated; Wolfe was known to be working on the research for this follow-up effort for several years.

Most of the mainstream American newspapers and news magazines gave the book positive reviews. However, a second wave of reviews in more highbrow literary outlets were more critical. Some of this more pointed criticism, mixed with praise for Wolfe&#x27;s style, came from established American novelists, including John Updike and Norman Mailer. In addition, novelist John Irving criticized Wolfe&#x27;s novel during an interview on a Canadian television program. Wolfe countered this criticism in his book &quot;Hooking Up&quot;, calling the three authors his &quot;three stooges&quot; who were actually shaken by the support he received. The novelists, he claimed, were threatened by the success of his technique - writing a novel based on reporting techniques - and were failing to engage the world around them. According to Mailer&#x27;s review, the book had sold over 750,000 copies by December 1998.

The book was credited with allusions to, or the caricaturing of, some prominent members of contemporary Atlanta society.

==Other media==
The abridged audiobook of &quot;A Man in Full&quot; was narrated by American actor David Ogden Stiers.
The unabridged audiobook of &quot;A Man in Full&quot; was released in 2018 and was narrated by American actor Michael Pritchard.

==Adaptation==
In November 2021, Netflix ordered a six-episode limited television series adaptation of the novel with Regina King as director and executive producer and David E. Kelley as showrunner. The miniseries was released on May 2, 2024 to mixed reviews.

<text>In fluid dynamics, a Kármán vortex street (or a von Kármán vortex street) is a repeating pattern of swirling vortices, caused by a process known as &quot;vortex shedding,&quot; which is responsible for the unsteady separation of flow of a fluid around blunt bodies.

It is named after the engineer and fluid dynamicist Theodore von Kármán, and is responsible for such phenomena as the &quot;singing&quot; of suspended telephone or power lines and the vibration of a car antenna at certain speeds. Mathematical modeling of von Kármán vortex street can be performed using different techniques including but not limited to solving the full Navier-Stokes equations with k-epsilon, SST, k-omega and Reynolds stress, and large eddy simulation (LES) turbulence models, by numerically solving some dynamic equations such as the Ginzburg–Landau equation, or by use of a bicomplex variable.

==Analysis==

A vortex street forms only at a certain range of flow velocities, specified by a range of Reynolds numbers (&quot;Re&quot;), typically above a limiting &quot;Re&quot; value of about 90. The (&quot;global&quot;) Reynolds number for a flow is a measure of the ratio of inertial to viscous forces in the flow of a fluid around a body or in a channel, and may be defined as a nondimensional parameter of the global speed of the whole fluid flow:
formula_1
where:
*formula_2 = the free stream flow speed (i.e. the flow speed far from the fluid boundaries formula_3 like the body speed relative to the fluid at rest, or an inviscid flow speed, computed through the Bernoulli equation), which is the original global flow parameter, i.e. the target to be non-dimensionalised.
*formula_4 = a characteristic length parameter of the body or channel
*formula_5 = the free stream kinematic viscosity parameter of the fluid, which in turn is the ratio:
formula_6
between:
*formula_7 = the reference fluid density.
*formula_8 = the free stream fluid dynamic viscosity

For common flows (the ones which can usually be considered as incompressible or isothermal), the kinematic viscosity is everywhere uniform over all the flow field and constant in time, so there is no choice on the viscosity parameter, which becomes naturally the kinematic viscosity of the fluid being considered at the temperature being considered. On the other hand, the reference length is always an arbitrary parameter, so particular attention should be put when comparing flows around different obstacles or in channels of different shapes: the global Reynolds numbers should be referred to the same reference length. This is actually the reason for which the most precise sources for airfoil and channel flow data specify the reference length at the Reynolds number. The reference length can vary depending on the analysis to be performed: for a body with circle sections such as circular cylinders or spheres, one usually chooses the diameter; for an airfoil, a generic non-circular cylinder or a bluff body or a revolution body like a fuselage or a submarine, it is usually the profile chord or the profile thickness, or some other given widths that are in fact stable design inputs; for flow channels usually the hydraulic diameter about which the fluid is flowing.

For an aerodynamic profile the reference length depends on the analysis. In fact, the profile chord is usually chosen as the reference length also for aerodynamic coefficient for wing sections and thin profiles in which the primary target is to maximize the lift coefficient or the lift/drag ratio (i.e. as usual in thin airfoil theory, one would employ the &quot;chord Reynolds&quot; as the flow speed parameter for comparing different profiles). On the other hand, for fairings and struts the given parameter is usually the dimension of internal structure to be streamlined (let us think for simplicity it is a beam with circular section), and the main target is to minimize the drag coefficient or the drag/lift ratio. The main design parameter which becomes naturally also a reference length is therefore the profile thickness (the profile dimension or area perpendicular to the flow direction), rather than the profile chord.

The range of &quot;Re&quot; values varies with the size and shape of the body from which the eddies are shed, as well as with the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. For the wake of a circular cylinder, for which the reference length is conventionally the diameter &quot;d&quot; of the circular cylinder, the lower limit of this range is &quot;Re&quot; ≈ 47. Eddies are shed continuously from each side of the circle boundary, forming rows of vortices in its wake. The alternation leads to the core of a vortex in one row being opposite the point midway between two vortex cores in the other row, giving rise to the distinctive pattern shown in the picture. Ultimately, the energy of the vortices is consumed by viscosity as they move further down stream, and the regular pattern disappears. Above the &quot;Re &quot; value of 188.5, the flow becomes three-dimensional, with periodic variation along the cylinder. Above &quot;Re&quot; on the order of 105 at the drag crisis, vortex shedding becomes irregular and turbulence sets in.

When a single vortex is shed, an asymmetrical flow pattern forms around the body and changes the pressure distribution. This means that the alternate shedding of vortices can create periodic lateral (sideways) forces on the body in question, causing it to vibrate. If the vortex shedding frequency is similar to the natural frequency of a body or structure, it causes resonance. It is this forced vibration that, at the correct frequency, causes suspended telephone or power lines to &quot;sing&quot; and the antenna on a car to vibrate more strongly at certain speeds.

==In meteorology==
The flow of atmospheric air over obstacles such as islands or isolated mountains sometimes gives birth to von Kármán vortex streets. When a cloud layer is present at the relevant altitude, the streets become visible. Such cloud layer vortex streets have been photographed from satellites. The vortex street can reach over from the obstacle and the diameter of the vortices are normally .

==Engineering problems==

In low turbulence, tall buildings can produce a Kármán street, so long as the structure is uniform along its height. In urban areas where there are many other tall structures nearby, the turbulence produced by these can prevent the formation of coherent vortices. Periodic crosswind forces set up by vortices along object&#x27;s sides can be highly undesirable, due to the vortex-induced vibrations caused, which can damage the structure, hence it is important for engineers to account for the possible effects of vortex shedding when designing a wide range of structures, from submarine periscopes to industrial chimneys and skyscrapers. For monitoring such engineering structures, the efficient measurements of von Kármán streets can be performed using smart sensing algorithms such as compressive sensing.

Even more serious instability can be created in concrete cooling towers, especially when built together in clusters. Vortex shedding caused the collapse of three towers at Ferrybridge Power Station C in 1965 during high winds.

The failure of the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge was originally attributed to excessive vibration due to vortex shedding, but was actually caused by aeroelastic flutter.

Kármán turbulence is also a problem for airplanes, especially when landing.

=== Solutions ===
To prevent vortex shedding and mitigate the unwanted vibration of cylindrical bodies is the use of a tuned mass damper (TMD). A tuned mass damper is a device consisting of a mass-spring system that is specifically designed and tuned to counteract the vibrations induced by vortex shedding.

When a tuned mass damper is installed on a cylindrical structure, such as a tall chimney or mast, it helps to reduce the vibration amplitudes caused by vortex shedding. The tuned mass damper consists of a mass that is attached to the structure through springs or dampers. In many cases, the spring is replaced by suspending the mass on cables such that it forms a pendulum system with the same resonance frequency. The mass is carefully tuned to have a natural frequency that matches the dominant frequency of the vortex shedding.

As the structure is subjected to vortex shedding-induced vibrations, the tuned mass damper oscillates in an out-of-phase motion with the structure. This counteracts the vibrations, reducing their amplitudes and minimizing the potential for resonance and structural damage.

The effectiveness of a tuned mass damper in mitigating vortex shedding-induced vibrations depends on factors such as the mass of the damper, its placement on the structure, and the tuning of the system. Engineers carefully analyze the structural dynamics and characteristics of the vortex shedding phenomenon to determine the optimal parameters for the tuned mass damper.
Another solution to prevent the unwanted vibration of such cylindrical bodies is a longitudinal fin that can be fitted on the downstream side, which, provided it is longer than the diameter of the cylinder, prevents the eddies from interacting, and consequently they remain attached. Obviously, for a tall building or mast, the relative wind could come from any direction. For this reason, helical projections resembling large screw threads are sometimes placed at the top, which effectively create asymmetric three-dimensional flow, thereby discouraging the alternate shedding of vortices; this is also found in some car antennas.

Another countermeasure with tall buildings is using variation in the diameter with height, such as tapering - that prevents the entire building from being driven at the same frequency.

==Formula==
This formula generally holds true for the range 250 &lt; Re&quot;d&quot; &lt; 200000:
formula_9
where:
formula_10
*&quot;f&quot; = vortex shedding frequency.
*&quot;d&quot; = diameter of the cylinder
*&quot;U&quot; = flow velocity.
This dimensionless parameter St is known as the Strouhal number and is named after the Czech physicist, Vincenc Strouhal (1850–1922) who first investigated the steady humming or singing of telegraph wires in 1878.

== History ==

Although named after Theodore von Kármán, he acknowledged that the vortex street had been studied earlier by Arnulph Mallock and Henri Bénard. Kármán tells the story in his book &quot;Aerodynamics&quot;:

In his autobiography, von Kármán described how his discovery was inspired by an Italian painting of St Christopher carrying the child Jesus whilst wading through water. Vortices could be seen in the water, and von Kármán noted that &quot;The problem for historians may have been why Christopher was carrying Jesus through the water. For me it was why the vortices&quot;. It has been suggested by researchers that the painting is one from the 14th century that can be found in the museum of the San Domenico church in Bologna.

<text>Jean Alexandre Francois LeMat (1821–1895) is best known for the percussion cap revolver that bears his name (see LeMat revolver).

LeMat was born in France in 1821 and studied for the priesthood at an early age. He decided against it and became a doctor. LeMat immigrated to the United States in 1843 and in 1849 he married Justine Sophie LePretre, the cousin of U.S. Army Major Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard. Beauregard later led the bombardment of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor in 1861. LeMat was an avid inventor as well as a practicing physician and Beauregard financed some of these ideas. 

LeMat, secured for his &quot;Grapeshot revolver&quot; design on October 21, 1856. British patents for the same design were issued in 1859, and he later designed a revolver rifle of similar concept as the handgun.

He returned to France after the Civil War and led a legion of Americans during the Franco-Prussian War. While many sources list his year of death in 1883, the most credible sources note that his grave in Paris indicates he died in 1895.

<doc id="1041070" wikidata="Q7379410" url="?curid=1041070" title="Rumsfeld Doctrine">
<text>The &quot;Rumsfeld Doctrine&quot;, named after former United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, is a phrase coined by journalists concerned with the perceived transformation of the U.S. military. It would be considered Rumsfeld&#x27;s own take on RMA (revolution in military affairs). It seeks to increase force readiness and decrease the amount of supply required to maintain forces, by reducing the number in a theater. This is done mainly by using LAVs (Light Armored Vehicles) to scout for enemies who are then destroyed via airstrikes. The basic tenets of this military strategy are:

* High-technology combat systems;
* Reliance on air forces;
* Small, nimble ground forces.

The early phases of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are considered the two closest implementations of this doctrine.

==Response==
Opponents argue that the doctrine entails a heavy reliance on airstrikes to replace a lack of ground forces. Beginning with Saddam Hussein, there were at least 50 airstrikes aimed at decapitating the Iraqi government. Not a single one was successful. However, there were extensive civilian casualties. This was coined the &quot;shock and awe&quot; military campaign.

Opponents also claim that without ground troops to secure the border, top Ba&#x27;athist regime members fled the country with vast Iraqi funds and foreign insurgents moved into the country. There were not enough troops to defend the Iraqi border from foreign-backed insurgents.

They also claim that without sufficient troops the country could not be pacified. Without sufficient troops to guard Iraqi military infrastructure, large amounts of munitions were looted. This has led to the current problem of insurgents and their improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Thomas Friedman of&quot;The New York Times&quot; has referred to the Rumsfeld Doctrine as one of &quot;just enough troops to lose&quot;.

That said, the war plan for the Iraq War led to a quick and decisive victory over one of the region&#x27;s largest and best equipped military forces. Using tactics honed from those used during the Gulf War, the Balkans, and Afghanistan, the U.S.-led coalition&#x27;s integrated forces strategy overwhelmed the Iraqi defenses using rapid deployment and engagement of military &quot;power&quot; rather than overwhelming them with overwhelming forces, or overwhelming numbers.

<text>Beers, Steers + Queers (stylized as BEERS, STEERS + QVEERS: THE ALBVM) is the second studio album by American–Belgian industrial rock band Revolting Cocks. Released in May 1990, the album was supported by three singles and was reissued several times. Its sound is industrial and built upon repetitive percussion and samples. David Jeffries of AllMusic described &quot;Beers, Steers + Queers&quot; as dominating college radio and clubs. The album&#x27;s supporting tour was recalled by Chris Connelly as &quot;ridiculous&quot; and particularly chaotic.

<doc id="1041074" wikidata="Q171723" url="?curid=1041074" title="Cliff Allison">
<text>Henry Clifford Allison (8 February 1932 – 7 April 2005) was a British racing driver from England, who participated in Formula One during seasons to for the Lotus, Scuderia Centro Sud, Ferrari and UDT Laystall teams. He was born and died in Brough, Westmorland (now Cumbria).

==Formula Three and Sports Cars==
Cliff Allison started his racing career in a Formula Three Cooper 500 in 1953 before being spotted by Colin Chapman. Allison won the performance prize driving a 744cc Lotus in the 1957 24 Hours of Le Mans. The Lotus of Allison and Colin Chapman finished sixth in the 1958 12 Hours of Sebring endurance race for sports cars. Allison came in fourth with his Lotus in the 1958 Grand Prix of Europe at Spa-Francorchamps, more than four minutes behind victor Tony Brooks.

Allison and Dan Gurney shared one of three team Ferrari cars that competed in the June 1959 1000 km Nürburgring race. Seventy-five cars entered the 1000 kilometre race which was a world championship event for sports cars.

Allison was paired with Jean Behra in a Ferrari which finished second in the 1959 12 Hours of Sebring. The drivers received $1,500 in prize money. Allison was credited with the fastest lap of the Sebring race in the No. 9 Ferrari. He was clocked at 3 minutes 21.6 seconds on the 97th lap of the 5.2-mile course.

In May 1960 Allison skidded off the road during practice for the Targa Florio in Palermo, Sicily. His Ferrari had reached a speed of 100 miles per hour when a tyre burst, or so the driver believed. The car crashed into a scrub forest, destroying itself and most of what it touched. When the mishap occurred the Ferrari was nearing the end of a five-mile straight by the sea. This was the only very fast stretch of road in the event. Allison escaped from the wreck without a scratch, but his face was ashen and his mouth hung open with an expression of fear.

==Formula One Lotus (1958, 1961), Ferrari (1959–60)==
Allison was forced to make numerous pit stops during the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix. His Lotus finished sixth, 12 laps behind race winner Maurice Trintignant. However this marked the first World Championship point for Team Lotus.

Ferrari&#x27;s stable of drivers for 1959 were Olivier Gendebien, Phil Hill, Brooks, Behra, Gurney, and Allison.

For the 1959 Monaco Grand Prix the Ferrari factory team fielded truncated versions of the cars they ran in future grand prix races. At Monte Carlo the Ferraris&#x27; long sleek snouts (air scoops) were cut away to allow more air into the cooling systems. Wolfgang von Trips lost control of his Porsche in a bend where the street was steeply inclined to Casino. Allison&#x27;s Formula 2 Ferrari crashed into him as he spun. The Lotus of Bruce Halford came next into the blind curve and became part of the wreck. Allison and his Ferrari suffered the least damage while von Trips sustained a gashed face, and Halford had a cut to his arm. None of the three cars could continue.

In the 1960 Argentine Grand Prix he scored the best result of his Formula 1 career when he finished 2nd. He suffered a major crash behind the wheel of his Ferrari while practising for the 1960 Monaco Grand Prix, and it took him almost the rest of the year to recover from his injuries. Allison was hurt when his Ferrari slammed into a straw barrier. He was unconscious when he was taken to a hospital. Allison sustained a broken left arm, rib fractures, facial cuts, and a concussion. He was listed in serious condition.

The following year he suffered another crash at the wheel of his Lotus in practice for the 1961 Belgian Grand Prix. He broke both his knees and fractured his pelvis when his car careened off the course and overturned in a field.

==Post-Formula One career==
This marked the end of his career in motor sport. He kept in touch with the sport through reunions and was always a popular visitor to the paddock.

Allison owned and managed Allison&#x27;s Garage in Brough. The business had been started by his father and he returned to it after his racing career ended. Allisons also provided the village and school bus services, which Cliff Allison would drive.

<doc id="1041075" wikidata="Q130309" url="?curid=1041075" title="Norwegian Cruise Line">
<text>Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) is an American cruise line founded in Norway in 1966, incorporated in the Bahamas and headquartered in Miami. It is the fourth-largest cruise line in the world by passengers, controlling about 8.6% of the total worldwide share of the cruise market by passengers . It is wholly owned by parent company Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings.

== History ==

The cruise line was founded in 1966 by Norwegian Knut Kloster and Israeli Ted Arison, with the 8,666-ton, 140 m long cruise ship/car ferry, , which in 1966 operated as a car ferry between Southampton UK and Gibraltar, for that one short season only. The &quot;Sunward&quot; was first managed under the Arison Shipping Company, and marketed as Ensign Cruises. Arison soon left to form Carnival Cruise Lines, while Kloster acquired additional ships for Caribbean service, with the line renamed and marketed as Norwegian Caribbean Lines.

=== Norwegian Caribbean Lines ===
Norwegian pioneered many firsts in the cruise industry, such as the first exclusive private island, Great Stirrup Cay in the Bahamas, the first combined air-sea program (marketed as &quot;Cloud 9 Cruises&quot;), which combined low-cost air fares with the cruise, Freestyle Cruising, which is a form of relaxed and informal cruising, and first shipline to develop new ports in the Caribbean, such as Ocho Rios in Jamaica.

==== First new builds ====

Norwegians&#x27;s second and third ship, the and &quot;Skyward&quot;, were the first newly built ships designed for the cruise line. Like the original &quot;Sunward&quot; of 1966, they had the capability to carry automobiles through a well-concealed stern door. Later, this area was turned into cabins and a two-deck movie theater, later to be used as a casino. Norwegian was responsible for many of the cruise innovations that have now become standard throughout the industry.

Norwegian would order two additional ships, that would be their first true cruise ships without any car carrying capacity. This would be the &quot;Southward&quot; in 1971, and an intended identical sister the &quot;Seaward,&quot; that would never be delivered to the line, and would be completed for P&amp;O Cruises instead. The line would sell its original ship the Sunward in 1973, being too small and inadequate for the modern cruise market. They would purchase the former Cunard Adventurer in 1977, refitting her with the trademark NCL funnels, and renamed &quot;Sunward II&quot;.

==== SS &quot;Norway&quot; ====

Norwegian made headlines with the acquisition of the liner in 1979, rebuilding the liner as a cruise ship and renaming her &quot;Norway&quot;. The conversion cost more than US$100million. At long and displacing 52,000 tons, the &quot;Norway&quot; was at the time significantly larger than any existing cruise ship, and exploited the extra space available by adding a greater-than-usual variety of onboard entertainment. Her success paved the way for a new era of giant cruise ships.

==== Further newbuilds and acquisitions ====

With an aging, small ship fleet by the late 1980s compared to the larger modern ships being built for competitors Carnival and Royal Caribbean, Norwegian attempted to catch up with an order of a new ship in 1987, the new &quot;Seaward&quot;, NCL&#x27;s first new build since 1971&quot;.&quot; Norwegian parent company Kloster would transfer two of the recently acquired Royal Viking Line ships to Norwegian, which became the &quot;&quot; and (III). Kloster would acquire Royal Cruise Line in 1989–90, and would eventually transfer the &quot;Westward&quot; to their fleet. Norwegian would also continue with further orders of new ships in the early 1990s, not competing with large-sized cruise ship building trend of competitors, but with the smaller with the &quot;Dreamward&quot; and &quot;Windward&quot; to offer better flexibility with itineraries.

The line would continue to acquire second hand ships in the mid-1990s, with the addition of the &quot;Leeward&quot; in 1995. In 1996 the &quot;Crown Odyssey,&quot; which was part of NCL&#x27;s subsidiary line Royal Cruise Line, was transferred and became the &quot;Norwegian Crown.&quot; In 1997 Norwegian acquired Majesty Cruise Line, and added their two ships, which became the &quot;Norwegian Majesty&quot; and &quot;Norwegian Dynasty&quot;. During this time Norwegian would rename all its ships with the &quot;Norwegian&quot; prefix (excluding SS &quot;Norway&quot;), and change its livery for the second time to a dark blue funnel with gold NCL logo.

Norwegian has expanded to other parts of the world, including Alaska, Europe, Bermuda, and Hawaii. Between 1997 and 2001, the company also operated cruises out of Australia under the name Norwegian Capricorn Line and acquired Orient Lines in 1998.

=== Acquisition by Star Cruises &amp; Freestyle Cruising ===
Norwegian was sold by Kloster to Star Cruises in 2000, a subsidiary of Genting Hong Kong, part of the Malaysia-based Genting Group. Under the new ownership a new concept was introduced with the newly completed ship, &quot;Norwegian Sky&quot;, freestyle cruising. This concept freed passengers from fixed formal dining times, instead there was relaxed attire, several distinct dining options, relaxed disembarkation and more lounges, bars, theatres and other entertainment and activity options, a change that would have a ripple effect across the cruise industry.

==== Fleet Modernization ====

With the financial backing of Star Cruises, the struggling Norwegian Cruise Line was able to begin to replace much of its older and second hand fleet with new ships. In addition to the &quot;Norwegian Sun&quot;, Star Cruises had ships already on order for their own fleet at Meyer Werft, which would be transferred to Norwegian during construction, with the first two debuting as the &quot;Norwegian Star&quot; in 2001 and &quot;Norwegian Dawn&quot; in 2002&quot;.&quot; These would be followed by an accelerated new build program, adding four more new ships over a five-year period.

==== NCL America ====
In 2002, Norwegian purchased the half-complete hull of the first Project America ship, at the time under construction at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, US, which was towed to Germany to be completed at the Lloyd Werft shipyard. Subsequently, Norwegian acquired the rights to move two ships built entirely outside the United States under the US flag, making it possible to start a US-flagged operation under the brand name NCL America. In 2003, the company announced the purchase of the American-flagged liners and . In their July 2007 fiscal report, Norwegian noted the sale of &quot;Independence&quot;, renamed SS &quot;Oceanic&quot; some time before. On July 1, 2010, the SS United States Conservancy struck a deal to buy SS &quot;United States&quot; for $3 million. On February 1, 2011, the ownership was officially transferred to the SS United States Conservancy.

==== Departure of SS &quot;Norway&quot; ====
A boiler explosion in May 2003 forced Norwegian to withdraw the &quot;Norway&quot; from service, later being laid up in Bremerhaven, Germany, until 2005, when she was towed to Port Klang Malaysia with the claimed intent to use her as an anchored casino or slow overnight casino cruises on her remaining boilers. Instead, she was sold for scrap and renamed the and later beached at Alang, Gujarat, India, in August 2006 with claims that she had not been cleaned of toxic materials. On September 11, 2007, the India Supreme Court issued an order permitting her to be broken up at Alang, despite the presence of large amounts of hazardous asbestos remaining on board.

==== Apollo Management and reorganisation ====
In August 2007, Star Cruises sold 50% of Norwegian for $1 billion to US-based Apollo Management to strengthen Norwegian&#x27;s financial position. In 2007, Star Cruises sold Orient Line&#x27;s &quot;Marco Polo&quot; to Transocean Tours, and Orient Lines ceased operations in early 2008.

Following an initial public offering and corporate reorganisation in 2013, Norwegian was made a wholly owned subsidiary of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH), while Norwegian&#x27;s previous owners Genting Hong Kong, Apollo Management and TPG Capital exchanged their stakes in Norwegian for shares in the newly listed NCLH.

=== Further new builds and fleet changes ===
Norwegian reported in February 2008 that the &quot;Pride of Aloha&quot;, one of the two remaining NCL America ships, would be withdrawn from service in May of the same year. Initial reports suggested she would be transferred to the fleet of Star Cruises, but it was later announced that she would return to the Norwegian international fleet as the &quot;Norwegian Sky&quot;, while the &quot;Norwegian Majesty&quot; and &quot;Norwegian Dream&quot; would be sold to Louis Cruise Lines.

==== Norwegian Epic ====
Two ships in this Epic class were ordered by NCL in November 2006, with an option for a third vessel that was not exercised. A dispute between NCL and STX initially resulted in the construction of both ships being placed on hold until a new agreement was reached. The agreement called for completion of the first ship; the second ship was cancelled in 2008. The sole remaining ship, &quot;Norwegian Epic&quot;, was delivered to NCL on 17 June 2010.

==== &quot;Breakaway&quot; class ====
The first two &quot;Breakaway&quot;-class ships entered service in 2013 and 2014 as Norwegian Breakaway and Norwegian Getaway. On October 17, 2012, Meyer Werft and Norwegian reached a second agreement for the construction of two new vessels, slated for delivery in October 2015 and 2017, respectively. The project was under the code name &quot;&quot;Breakaway&quot; Plus Class&quot;, with the vessels expected to be 163,000 gross tons and hold 4,200 passengers. The &quot;Norwegian Escape&quot; entered service in November 2015 and Norwegian Joy in 2017. Two more vessels were ordered on July 14, 2014, and they entered service in 2018 and 2019 as the Norwegian Bliss and Norwegian Encore, respectively. Dream Cruises ordered two modified Breakaway Class ships in 2015, they were launched in 2016 and 2017 as Genting Dream and World Dream.

The sale of the &quot;Norwegian Dream&quot; was subsequently cancelled. The &quot;Norwegian Dream&quot; became the &quot;Superstar Gemini&quot; for Star Cruises, from January 2013.

On June 1, 2012, Norwegian announced the signing of a memorandum of agreement to exercise its option to purchase &quot;Norwegian Sky&quot;. The purchase price was roughly $260 million, financing being provided by the seller.

In December 2016, Norwegian Cruise Line announced it had reached an agreement with the Cuban government. In May 2017, the &quot;Norwegian Sky&quot; was the first Norwegian Cruise Line vessel to ever visit Cuba. The &quot;Norwegian Sky&quot; made weekly trips from Miami to Havana, making Norwegian the only line sailing that route weekly. Norwegian continued operating Cuban routes until June 2019, when they came to a halt following new restrictions from the Trump Administration.

===== Project Leonardo =====

In February 2016, Norwegian ordered 4 new ships from Fincantieri under the codename Project Leonardo, to be delivered in 2022–2025. These ships would have around 140,000 gross tonnage. In July 2018, NCL confirmed that they had ordered 2 more ships to be delivered in 2026–27. On December 9, 2019, the keel of the first ship was laid down and named Norwegian Prima. It was launched in August 2021 and commenced sailing in the same month of 2022. The second ship was named Norwegian Viva in early 2022 and expected to be completed by 2023.

On May 2, 2017, Norwegian Cruise Line announced a new PortMiami Terminal. The construction began on May 1, 2018, and was completed in fall 2019. In December 2018, Norwegian revealed plans to build a new pier in Alaska&#x27;s Icy Strait Point.

===COVID-19 pandemic===
In March 2020, the &quot;Miami New Times&quot; reported that managers at Norwegian had prepared a set of responses intended to convince customers wary of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to book cruises, including &quot;blatantly false&quot; claims that the coronavirus &quot;can only survive in cold temperatures, so the Caribbean is a fantastic choice for your next cruise&quot;, that &quot;scientists and medical professionals have confirmed that the warm weather of the spring will be the end of the coronavirus&quot;, and that the virus &quot;cannot live in the amazingly warm and tropical temperatures that your cruise will be sailing to.&quot;

On March 14, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a No Sail Order for cruise ships. Concurrently Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings implemented a suspension of all cruise voyages across its three brands (Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises, and Regent Seven Seas Cruises), with all 28 ships in port or at anchor and all passengers disembarked by March 28, 2020. This suspension has subsequently been extended through June 30, 2020.

On May 5, 2020, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) said there is “substantial doubt” about its ability to continue as a “going concern” as it faces a liquidity crisis over the next twelve months.

By the next day, NCLH was able to secure over $2.2 billion of additional liquidity in oversubscribed capital markets transactions, but at a price: (1) $400 million in common stock at $11 per share; (2) $675 million in senior secured notes due 2024 at a 12.25% interest rate; (3) $750 million in exchangeable notes due 2024 at 6% interest rate, and exchangeable at any time into common shares at $13.75; and (4) $400 million private investment from a global private equity firm. On May 7, 2020, NCLH CEO declared that the company has secured enough liquidity to get through potentially 18 months of zero revenues and may resume cruising later in 2020.

In anticipation of sailing again, Norwegian is implementing new health and safety measures, including installing H13 HEPA air filters. The company is also working with the CDC and the new color-coding system to indicate each ship&#x27;s COVID-19 status, and to repatriate Norwegian crews still stuck aboard their vessel.

Even though the company lost $4 billion and furloughed 20 percent of its staff, it doubled the salary of its chief executive, Frank Del Rio, to $36.4 million.

== Fleet ==
, Norwegian Cruise Line operates 19 cruise ships, with eight on order. It has also previously owned or operated 19 other ships. All its ships are flagged to the Bahamas, except for the &quot;Pride of America&quot;, which operates cruises within the United States and is flagged and registered in the US, as well as being owned by a US-registered subsidiary, NCL America.

<doc id="1041078" wikidata="Q633261" url="?curid=1041078" title="Lab-on-a-chip">
<text>A lab-on-a-chip (LOC) is a device that integrates one or several laboratory functions on a single integrated circuit (commonly called a &quot;chip&quot;) of only millimeters to a few square centimeters to achieve automation and high-throughput screening. LOCs can handle extremely small fluid volumes down to less than pico-liters. Lab-on-a-chip devices are a subset of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices and sometimes called &quot;micro total analysis systems&quot; (μTAS). LOCs may use microfluidics, the physics, manipulation and study of minute amounts of fluids. However, strictly regarded &quot;lab-on-a-chip&quot; indicates generally the scaling of single or multiple lab processes down to chip-format, whereas &quot;μTAS&quot; is dedicated to the integration of the total sequence of lab processes to perform chemical analysis.

== History ==

After the invention of microtechnology (≈1954) for realizing integrated semiconductor structures for microelectronic chips, these lithography-based technologies were soon applied in pressure sensor manufacturing (1966) as well. Due to further development of these usually CMOS-compatibility limited processes, a tool box became available to create micrometre or sub-micrometre sized mechanical structures in silicon wafers as well: the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) era had started.

Next to pressure sensors, airbag sensors and other mechanically movable structures, fluid handling devices were developed. Examples are: channels (capillary connections), mixers, valves, pumps and dosing devices. The first LOC analysis system was a gas chromatograph, developed in 1979 by S.C. Terry at Stanford University. However, only at the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s did the LOC research start to seriously grow as a few research groups in Europe developed micropumps, flowsensors and the concepts for integrated fluid treatments for analysis systems. These μTAS concepts demonstrated that integration of pre-treatment steps, usually done at lab-scale, could extend the simple sensor functionality towards a complete laboratory analysis, including additional cleaning and separation steps.

A big boost in research and commercial interest came in the mid-1990s, when μTAS technologies turned out to provide interesting tooling for genomics applications, like capillary electrophoresis and DNA microarrays. A big boost in research support also came from the military, especially from DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), for their interest in portable systems to aid in the detection of biological and chemical warfare agents. The added value was not only limited to integration of lab processes for analysis but also the characteristic possibilities of individual components and the application to other, non-analysis, lab processes. Hence the term &quot;lab-on-a-chip&quot; was introduced.

Although the application of LOCs is still novel and modest, a growing interest of companies and applied research groups is observed in different fields such as chemical analysis, environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics and cellomics, but also in synthetic chemistry such as rapid screening and microreactors for pharmaceutics. Besides further application developments, research in LOC systems is expected to extend towards downscaling of fluid handling structures as well, by using nanotechnology. Sub-micrometre and nano-sized channels, DNA labyrinths, single cell detection and analysis, and nano-sensors, might become feasible, allowing new ways of interaction with biological species and large molecules. Many books have been written that cover various aspects of these devices, including the fluid transport, system properties, sensing techniques, and bioanalytical applications.

The size of the global lab on chip market was estimated at US$5,698 million in 2021 and is projected to increase to US$14,772 million by 2030, at a CAGR of 11.5% from 2022 to 2030 

== Chip materials and fabrication technologies ==
The basis for most LOC fabrication processes is photolithography. Initially most processes were in silicon, as these well-developed technologies were directly derived from semiconductor fabrication. Because of demands for e.g. specific optical characteristics, bio- or chemical compatibility, lower production costs and faster prototyping, new processes have been developed such as glass, ceramics and metal etching, deposition and bonding, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) processing (e.g., soft lithography), Off-stoichiometry thiol-ene polymers (OSTEmer) processing, thick-film- and stereolithography-based 3D printing as well as fast replication methods via electroplating, injection molding and embossing. The demand for cheap and easy LOC prototyping resulted in a simple methodology for the fabrication of PDMS microfluidic devices: ESCARGOT (Embedded SCAffold RemovinG Open Technology). This technique allows for the creation of microfluidic channels, in a single block of PDMS, via a dissolvable scaffold (made by e.g. 3D printing).
Furthermore, the LOC field more and more exceeds the borders between lithography-based microsystem technology, nanotechnology and precision engineering. Printing is considered as a well-established yet maturing method for rapid prototyping in chip fabrication.

The development of LOC devices using printed circuit board (PCB) substrates is an interesting alternative due to these differentiating characteristics: commercially available substrates with integrated electronics, sensors and actuators; disposable devices at low cost, and very high potential of commercialization. These devices are known as Lab-on-PCBs (LOPCBs). The following are some of the advantages of PCB technology:
a) PCB-based circuit design offers great flexibility and can be tailored to specific demands.
b) PCB technology enables the integration of electronic and sensing modules on the same platform, reducing device size while maintaining accuracy of detection.
c) The standardized and established PCB manufacturing process allows for cost-effective large-scale production of PCB-based detection devices.
d) The growth of flexible PCB technology has driven the development of wearable detection devices. As a result, over the past decade, there have been numerous reports on the application of Lab-on-PCB to various biomedical fields, including the fastest SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic test.
e) PCBs are compatible with wet deposition methods, to allow for the fabrication of sensors using novel nanomaterials (e.g. graphene).

== Advantages ==
LOCs may provide advantages, which are specific to their application. Typical advantages are:
* low fluid volumes consumption (less waste, lower reagents costs and less required sample volumes for diagnostics)
* faster analysis and response times due to short diffusion distances, fast heating, high surface to volume ratios, small heat capacities.
* better process control because of a faster response of the system (e.g. thermal control for exothermic chemical reactions)
* compactness of the systems due to integration of much functionality and small volumes
* massive parallelization due to compactness, which allows high-throughput analysis
* lower fabrication costs, allowing cost-effective disposable chips, fabricated in mass production
* part quality may be verified automatically
* safer platform for chemical, radioactive or biological studies because of integration of functionality, smaller fluid volumes and stored energies

== Disadvantages ==
The most prominent disadvantages of labs-on-chip are:
* The micro-manufacturing process required to make them is complex and labor-intensive, requiring both expensive equipment and specialized personnel. It can be overcome by the recent technology advancement on low-cost 3D printing and laser engraving.
*The complex fluidic actuation network requires multiple pumps and connectors, where fine control is difficult. It can be overcome by careful simulation, an intrinsic pump, such as air-bag embed chip, or by using a centrifugal force to replace the pumping, i.e. centrifugal micro-fluidic biochip.
* Most LOCs are novel proof of concept application that are not yet fully developed for widespread use. More validations are needed before practical employment.
* In the microliter scale that LOCs deal with, surface dependent effects like capillary forces, surface roughness or chemical interactions are more dominant. This can sometimes make replicating lab processes in LOCs quite challenging and more complex than in conventional lab equipment.
* Detection principles may not always scale down in a positive way, leading to low signal-to-noise ratios.

== Global health ==
Lab-on-a-chip technology may soon become an important part of efforts to improve global health, particularly through the development of point-of-care testing devices. In countries with few healthcare resources, infectious diseases that would be treatable in a developed nation are often deadly. In some cases, poor healthcare clinics have the drugs to treat a certain illness but lack the diagnostic tools to identify patients who should receive the drugs. Many researchers believe that LOC technology may be the key to powerful new diagnostic instruments. The goal of these researchers is to create microfluidic chips that will allow healthcare providers in poorly equipped clinics to perform diagnostic tests such as microbiological culture assays, immunoassays and nucleic acid assays with no laboratory support.

=== Global challenges ===
For the chips to be used in areas with limited resources, many challenges must be overcome. In developed nations, the most highly valued traits for diagnostic tools include speed, sensitivity, and specificity; but in countries where the healthcare infrastructure is less well developed, attributes such as ease of use and shelf life must also be considered. The reagents that come with the chip, for example, must be designed so that they remain effective for months even if the chip is not kept in a climate controlled environment. Chip designers must also keep cost, scalability, and recyclability in mind as they choose what materials and fabrication techniques to use.

=== Examples of global LOC application ===
One of the most prominent and well known LOC devices to reach the market is the at home pregnancy test kit, a device that utilizes paper-based microfluidics technology. 

Another active area of LOC research involves ways to diagnose and manage common infectious diseases caused by bacteria, e.g. bacteriuria, or viruses, e.g. influenza. A gold standard for diagnosing bacteriuria (urinary tract infections) is microbial culture. A recent study based on lab-on-a-chip technology, Digital Dipstick, miniaturised microbiological culture into a dipstick format and enabled it to be used at the point-of-care. Lab-on-a-chip technology can also be useful for the diagnosis and management of viral infections. In 2023, researchers developed a working prototype of an RT-LAMP lab-on-a-chip system called LoCKAmp, which provided results for SARS-CoV-2 tests within three minutes. Managing HIV infections is another area where lab-on-a-chips may be useful. Around 36.9 million people are infected with HIV in the world today, and 59% of these people receive anti-retroviral treatment. Only 75% of people living with HIV knew their status. Measuring the number of CD4+ T lymphocytes in a person&#x27;s blood is an accurate way to determine if a person has HIV and to track the progress of an HIV infection. At the moment, flow cytometry is the gold standard for obtaining CD4 counts, but flow cytometry is a complicated technique that is not available in most developing areas because it requires trained technicians and expensive equipment. Recently such a cytometer was developed for just $5. 
Another active area of LOC research is for controlled separation and mixing. In such devices it is possible to quickly diagnose and potentially treat diseases. As mentioned above, a big motivation for development of these is that they can potentially be manufactured at very low cost. One more area of research that is being looked into with regards to LOC is with home security. Automated monitoring of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is a desired functionality for LOC. If this application becomes reliable, these micro-devices could be installed on a global scale and notify homeowners of potentially dangerous compounds.

== Plant sciences ==
Lab-on-a-chip devices could be used to characterize pollen tube guidance in &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;. Specifically, plant on a chip is a miniaturized device in which pollen tissues and ovules could be incubated for plant sciences studies.

<text>Orient Lines was a cruise line specialising in exotic destinations that was in operation 1993–2008. The brand was founded in 1993 by Gerry Herrod, and was sold to Norwegian Cruise Line in 1998. It ceased operations in March 2008 and was sold to new owners in June 2008. Operations were planned to be restarted in April 2009; however, due to the Great Recession of 2008, the re-launch of the Orient Lines brand was put on hold and eventually cancelled.

==History==
The history of Orient Lines began in 1991 when Shipping &amp; General Ltd, owned by Gerry Herrod, acquired the cruise ship &quot;Alexandr Pushkin&quot; from Far Eastern Shipping Company. During the next two and a half years the &quot;Alexandr Pushkin&quot; was almost entirely rebuilt and emerged in 1993 as the &quot;Marco Polo&quot; for the new Orient Lines brand, embarking on a varied program with cruises all around the world.

In 1998, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) acquired the brand. In 1999, NCL itself was acquired by Star Cruises. Following this, NCL&#x27;s &quot;Norwegian Crown&quot; joined the Orient Lines fleet in May 2000 under the name &quot;Crown Odyssey&quot;. In March 2001 Star Cruises announced that their &quot;SuperStar Aries&quot; would be joining the Orient Lines fleet in mid-2002 as the &quot;Ocean Voyager&quot;. This plan was shelved however, and in 2003, the &quot;Crown Odyssey&quot; returned to the NCL fleet and Orient Lines reverted to operating with just one ship.

On 4 June 2007, the &quot;Marco Polo&quot; was sold to the Greece-based Global Maritime, with a delivery date on 31 March 2008. Without its only ship sold and no other ships to replace it, the Orient Line brand ceased to operate.

On 27 June 2008, Star Cruises sold the Orient Line brand to Origin Cruise Group, owned by Wayne Heller. The new owners stated they would be restarting operations with several second-hand ships with a capacity of 600 to 800 passengers. The first ship acquired by the &quot;new&quot; Orient Lines was , which was purchased from Sovcomflot on 20 August 2008. The &quot;Maxim Gorkiy&quot; was due to enter service with Orient Lines in April 2009 as SS &quot;Marco Polo II&quot;. On 19 November 2008 Wayne Heller stated that due to the Great Recession of 2008, the relaunch of the Orient Lines brand was delayed indefinitely. The &quot;Maxim Gorkiy&quot; never was refitted and renamed &quot;Marco Polo II&quot;. The ship was sold for scrap in January 2009. No further announcements have been made regarding the future of the Orient Lines, though the trademarks are still owned by Origin Cruise Group. In 2019, the abandoned website was taken down due to the domain expiring.

<text>Barony Rosendal (Norwegian: &quot;Baroniet Rosendal&quot;) is a historic estate and manor house situated in Kvinnherad in Hordaland county, Norway. The barony was built in the 17th century by Danish noblemen on the old estate of the Norwegian noble Galte family, the current barony estate making out the historical farms of Hatteberg, Mel and Eik.

==History==
The history of Rosendal dates back to the 1650s, when the nobleman Ludvig Holgersen Rosenkrantz (1628-1685) of the House of Rosenkrantz came to Bergen as commissioner of war for the Danish king, Frederick III. At a ball at the fortress of Bergenhus he met Karen Axelsdatter Mowatt (1630-1675), sole heiress to the largest fortune in the country at the time. Her father was a great land-owner and had more than 550 farms all over the western part of Norway. They were married in 1658 and were given the farm of Hatteberg in Rosendal as a wedding present.

In 1661, Ludwig Rosenkrantz started building his own country house in Rosendal and completed this in 1665.
In 1678, King Christian V of Denmark gave the estate the status of a barony - the only one of its kind in Norway. Around 1850, an expansive romantic garden was laid out around the house.

The inhabitants of Rosendal were important people in the cultural life of Norway. Authors Henrik Ibsen, Jonas Lie and Alexander Kielland and painters Hans Gude and Anders Askevold visited Rosendal often. The musicians Edvard Grieg and Ole Bull were guests here. Often there were concerts in Rosendal, a tradition which is still kept alive.

== House of Rosenkrantz ==
Ludvig Holgersen Rosenkrantz received a baronial patent (&quot;Friherrepatent&quot;) in 1678 from King Christian V. The successive barons were:

* 1658–1685 Baron Ludvig Rosenkrantz (1628-1685)
* 1685–1691 Baron Christian Rosenkrantz
* 1691–1723 Baron Axel Rosenkrantz (1670-1723)

== House of Londemann of Rosencrone ==
In 1749, Bishop Edvard Londemann of Rosendal received a patent of nobility under the name Londemann af Rosencrone. In 1773 he received a baronial patent, and in 1782 was also created a count. The holders of this title were:

* 1745–1749 Count Edvard Londeman Rosencrone (1680-1749)
* 1749–1811 Count Marcus Gerhard Londemann de Rosencrone (1738-1811)

== House of Hoff Rosencrone ==
A member of the Hoff family in the Bohemian nobility was naturalized as a Danish-Norwegian nobleman in 1778. One Major Hans Wentzel Hoff (1636-1713), emigrated to Denmark in 1659. His son, Lieutenant Colonel Christian Hoff (1690-1746), married Maria Margrethe Londemann of Rosencrone (1711–62), daughter of the titular bishop Edvard Londemann of Rosencrone (1680-1749), who had founded the &quot;fideikommiss&quot; of Rosendal. Christian Hoff was the grandfather of Major Christian Henrik Hoff (1768-1837) who inherited the barony of Rosendal, and in 1813 was created a Baron with the title of Hoff Rosencrone. His children were baroness Edvardine Reinholdine Hoff Rosenkrone (1820-1901), who married Hans Christian Weis (1811–82); Marcus Gerhard Hoff Rosenkrone of Rosendal (1823–96); and Hermann Reinhold Hoff Rosenkrone of Rosendal (1829-1900). The two brothers were not Norwegian barons, since they were born after 1821, but were still Danish barons.

* 1811–1837 Baron Christian Henrik Hoff Rosencrone (1768-1837)
* 1837–1896 Marcus Gerhard Hoff Rosenkrone to Rosendal (1823-1896)
* 1896–1900 Hermann Reinhold Hoff Rosenkrone to Rosendal (1829-1900)

== House of Weis-Hoff-Rosencrone ==
Baroness Edvardine Reinholdine Hoff-Rosencrone (1820–1901) daughter of baron Christian Henrik Hoff-Rosencrone, married the doctor and later state councilor Hans Christian Weis. She inherited the estate when her little brother died in 1900, Edvardine died the next year. Their oldest son doctor Christian Weis-Hoff-Rosencrone inherited the estate next.

* 1902–1916 Christian Weis-Hoff-Rosencrone (1850-1916)
* 1916–1927 Edvard Weis-Hoff-Rosencrone (1855-1927)
* 1927–1927 Clara Marie Gædeken née Weis-Hoff-Rosencrone (1845-1934)

== Baroniet Rosendal museum ==

The property remained in private ownership until 1927, when the last owner donated it to the University of Oslo. The manor is now operated as the Baroniet Rosendal museum. The museum offers valuable information about an important period of Norwegian history.

A guided tour of the manor takes visitors through the different periods of occupation from 1665 up to 1930. The oldest restored rooms are still decorated as they were in the early 19th century. The garden is often referred to as the most magnificent Victorian garden in Norway. Among other things around 2000 roses in bloom can be experienced here from June to November.

<text>The San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) was a research project that began in 2002 aimed at collecting geological data about the San Andreas Fault for the purpose of predicting and analyzing future earthquakes. The site consists of a pilot hole and a main hole. Drilling operations ceased in 2007. Located near the town of Parkfield, California, the project installed geophone sensors and GPS clocks in a borehole that cut directly through the fault. This data, along with samples collected during drilling, helped shed new light on geochemical and mechanical properties around the fault zone.

SAFOD was part of Earthscope, an Earth science program using geological and geophysical techniques to explore the structure of the North American continent and to understand the origin of earthquakes and volcanoes. Earthscope was funded by the National Science Foundation in conjunction with the U.S. Geological Survey and NASA. Data collected at SAFOD are available from The Northern California Earthquake Data Center at U.C. Berkeley and from NSF SAGE Facility Data Services operated by EarthScope Consortium, formerly known as the IRIS DMC.

<doc id="1041086" wikidata="Q918474" url="?curid=1041086" title="Wormhole X-Treme!">
<text>&quot;Wormhole X-Treme!&quot; is the 100th episode of military science fiction adventure television show &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and is the 12th episode of the fifth season. The episode was first broadcast September 8, 2001 on Showtime in the United States. It was written by series co-creator and executive producer Brad Wright along with supervising producers Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie and was directed by Peter DeLuise.

In the episode, Stargate Command learns that an alien ship belonging to the same race as Martin Lloyd is heading for Earth. They locate Martin, who having once again lost his memories has created a television series called &quot;Wormhole X-Treme!&quot;, seemingly based upon the top secret Stargate Program.

The story centres around a show-within-a-show called &quot;Wormhole X-Treme!&quot; which parodies &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. In creating the episode, Wright and all those involved sought to create a comedic episode that celebrated the show through parody, cameo appearances, inside and metafictional jokes and references. The episode is a sequel to &quot;Point of No Return&quot; from the shows fourth season. The season ten episode &quot;200&quot; follows up on characters and events from the episode.

==Plot==

An alien space ship has been detected heading towards Earth, and based upon its energy signature Major Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) believes that it belongs to the same species of people as Martin Lloyd, who Stargate Command set about locating. They find Martin, who has become the creative consultant on a science fiction television show he sold called &quot;Wormhole X-Treme!&quot;, which bears a striking resemblance to the real life top secret Stargate Program. Under the guise of being the shows Air Force consultant, Colonel Jack O&#x27;Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) is sent to the studio where Martin is working on the show in order to learn what he can from him about the inbound ship. O&#x27;Neill reintroduces himself to Martin (Willie Garson), who despite having previously met, claims not to remember him.

Believing that Martin has once again had his memory erased, O&#x27;Neill searches his trailer and uncovers numerous vitamins, which he relays back to General Hammond (Don S. Davis) at Stargate Command, who dispatches the rest of SG-1 to assist. Soon Dr. Fraiser (Teryl Rothery) determines that the vitamins found contain the chemical used by Tanner, another member of Martin&#x27;s race who was previously responsible for drugging him. Meanwhile, Carter and Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) establish that, also like last time, surveillance devices have been setup around Martin&#x27;s house. After their attempt to apprehend one of Tanner&#x27;s men fails, Carter and Daniel&#x27;s lead takes them to a warehouse filled with government agents.

O&#x27;Neill and Martin are captured by Tanner (Robert Lewis) and his men, who administer Martin with an antidote to restore his memories. As his memories return, he tells O&#x27;Neill that he drugged himself in order to forget everything that had happened to him. The pair are soon freed by Teal&#x27;c (Christopher Judge) and Martin realizes that he needs to help Tanner&#x27;s group escape Earth by getting the remote device for their ship. Meanwhile NID Agent Barrett (Peter Flemming), whose men have apprehended Carter and Daniel, tells them that they plan on seizing the space ship, and soon receive a tip as to Martin&#x27;s whereabouts. With Barrett gone, Carter and Daniel overpower the remaining NID agents and contact O&#x27;Neill warning him that the NID are on their way. O&#x27;Neill procures the device and Tanner persuades him to relinquish it to they can flee Earth and the NID. Content with his new life, Martin decides to stay on Earth and Tanner and his men teleport to the ship before the NID can get to them.

==Production==
===Development===

The initial idea for the story came from series co-creator and executive producer Brad Wright. He imagined the character of Martin Lloyd, who had previously appeared in the season four episode &quot;Point of No Return&quot; as having once again lost his memory, leading him to make a television series like &quot;SG-1&quot;. According to Wright, the story &quot;was something I would never have done in a million years unless it was the one-hundredth episode&quot;. After Wright had outlined the story, writing duo Joseph Mallozzi &amp; Paul Mullie were assigned to pen the script, although they initially thought Wright was joking when he pitched them the story. Wright believed one of the things fans found attractive in &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; was the fact that the show didn&#x27;t take itself &quot;too seriously&quot;. Instead of a typical episode, the writers looked to produce a more comedic story, celebrating the milestone. The 1999 Science fiction comedy film &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; enthused Wright and the shows writers to instead craft a story that parodied &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;.

In developing their script, Mullie found that they had no shortage of jokes, however &quot;The hard part was finding an excuse for the humour to happen&quot;. Mullie wanted to ensure the episode still meant something and had &quot;an actual Stargate story underneath all of the parody&quot;. Once the shows production team found out about the nature of the episode, Mallozzi recalled &quot;So many people wanted to add so much&quot;, and would pitch them material. As writing progressed it was the idea that Martin Lloyd had purposely decided to erase his own memory which &quot;made certain events fall into place&quot; for Mallozzi and Mullie.

There were conversations about how far to push the parody elements of the episode. Visual effects supervisor James Tichnor had hoped they would also be able to include &quot;corny&quot; computer generated effects, citing the invading spaceships in the film &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; as an idea, however Wright still wanted to maintain a level of realism within the episode. The visual effects team were able to include some smaller scale gags, such as paying homage to the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; transporter effect at the end of the episode.

===Writing===
Events that had taken place both on and off screen in the show and its production helped inform numerous scenes. Peter Deluise&#x27;s earlier directorial decision to ask the props master to &quot;Make the kiwi look alien&quot;, suggesting they be painted red during the production of &quot;Beneath the Surface&quot;, was written directly into &quot;Wormhole X-Treme!&quot; Another choice by DeLuise to have Jack O&#x27;Neill kill what he was later told was &quot;too many Jaffa&quot; and then step over their dead bodies in the episode &quot;The Fifth Man&quot; informed having Danning/Marlowe&#x27;s struggle to navigate a kissing scene whilst surrounded by dead bodies. The president of MGM Television, Hank Cohen, was also mocked for his advocacy that the show introduce a &quot;sexy&quot; female alien character, which ultimately took the form of Anise portrayed by actress Vanessa Angel. Mullie felt that the character &quot;didn&#x27;t quite work out&quot; and as &quot;a dig at him&quot; he wrote that an executive would make the same suggestion. Cohen was ultimately given a cameo in the episode, delivering the line. Mullie had neither expected the joke to remain in the episode, nor for Cohen to be the one who delivered it.

The writers also took aim at other elements of &quot;Stargate&quot; and science fiction in general storytelling. The recurring Goa&#x27;uld weapon, the Zat&#x27;nik&#x27;tel, which Mallozzi described as weapon of &quot;connivence&quot; and used the opportunity to lampoon its ability to disintegrate targets upon the third shot. Additionally, during filming, DeLuise had the &quot;Wormhole X-Treme!&quot; team perform what the shows production mockingly referred to as the &quot;jerky&quot; or &quot;twitchy&quot; dance after being shot, something that the main cast of &quot;SG-1&quot; had become reluctant to do after being &quot;zatted&quot; as the show progressed over the years. The science fiction trope of characters being out of phase was also made fun of, as were the &quot;SG-1&quot; conceits of everyone speaking English and having the same concept of time as Earth.

Some scenes and ideas were dropped during development. This included Wright&#x27;s idea for a &quot;huge, knock down, full-on, comically-big fight scene&quot; showing Carter and Daniel&#x27;s escape from the NID. Wright dropped the scene as he was concerned they were &quot;in danger of going too far&quot; in sending themselves up. A scene referencing the ongoing will-they-won&#x27;t-they romance between Jack O&#x27;Neill and Samantha Carter was also written but ultimately dropped. According to Mallozzi the scene would have involved Martin expressing his desire to have two of his main characters in a relationship, but being unable to do so due to their position in the military - mirroring the O&#x27;Neill/Carter relationship. O&#x27;Neill would have gone on to reference the events of the &quot;SG-1&quot; episode &quot;Beneath the Surface&quot;, with Martin responding: &quot;I can’t do that! That’s a &quot;Voyager&quot; episode!&quot;

===Cast and characters===
Willie Garson returns as the alien refugee Martin Lloyd, first introduced in &quot;Point of No Return&quot;. Robert Lewis and Mar Andersons reprise their roles from &quot;Point of No Return&quot; as the alien refugees hiding on Earth, Dr. Peter Tanner and Bob. Matthew Bennett who had previously portrayed one of the alien refugees was unable to return.

The character of Nick Marlowe, who portrays Colonel Danning in &quot;Wormhole X-Treme!&quot; was originally based on Richard Dean Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; character Colonel Jack O&#x27;Neill. The part of Marlowe/Danning was first offered to Jeff Probst and then to Robert Hays. After being unable to secure either actor, the part was opened up to auditions, before Brad Wright suggested Michael DeLuise, brother of Peter DeLuise. After accepting the part, Michael was sent a tape of Richard Dean Anderson&#x27;s work on the show; however, Michael with the support of director Peter, instead looked to the performances of William Shatner and his depiction of Captain James Kirk from &quot;Star Trek&quot; for inspiration. As well as imbuing the character with &quot;Shatnerisms,&quot; Michael sought to portray Danning as an &quot;over-the-top TV hero&quot; and Marlowe as a &quot;pissy, self-absorbed actor&quot;. For the role, Michael DeLuise&#x27;s hair was dyed slightly grey and two cuts were made into his right eyebrow as homage to the single slit in O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s.

Christopher Judge&#x27;s stand-in Herbert Duncanson was cast as Douglas Anders, who portrays Grell the Robot within &quot;Wormhole X-Treme!&quot;, a parody of the character of Teal&#x27;c. Jill Teed was cast in the role of Yolanda Reese, who portrays the character of Stacy Monroe in &quot;Wormhole X-Treme!&quot;, a parody of Samantha Carter. According to Peter DeLuise, Teed had &quot;come so close on so many different parts and this time around we thought, &quot;We have to have her in this story&quot;.&quot; Christian Boucher was selected to parody Dr. Daniel Jackson, portraying the character of Raymond Gunne who plays Dr. Levant in &quot;Wormhole X-Treme!&quot;. Boucher had previously portrayed the character Major Dean Newman in the episode &quot;Shades of Grey&quot;, and would go on to guest star as a character called Torrell in the episode &quot;Condemned&quot; of spinoff series &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;. The episode marks the first appearance of Agent Malcolm Barrett portrayed by Peter Flemming, who would go on to make numerous appearances on both &quot;SG-1&quot; and &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;. Flemming gave a quick, two line audition for the part, which at the time was called &#x27;Man in Black&#x27; with the possibility of becoming recurring. Benjamin Immanuel, Don Thompson, Laura Drummond, Kiara Hunter and Keath Thome respectively play the parts of Producer, Props Guy, Security Guard, Alien Princess and Head SF.

Many of the shows production staff guest or cameo within the episode as the fictional crew of &quot;Wormhole X-treme!&quot;. Director Peter DeLuise portrays a fictional version of himself - the director of &quot;Wormhole X-Treme!&quot; and property master David Sinclair portrays Bill the assistant director. Cameos include writers Brad Wright, Robert C. Cooper, Joseph Mallozzi and Ron Wilkerson. Executive producer Michael Greenburg, his wife actress Nikki Smook, co-executive producer N. John Smith and production manager Andy Mikita all also appear. Other cameos include visual effects supervisor Michelle Comens, senior digital compositing artist Bruce Woloshyn, makeup artist Jan Newman, 3rd assistant director Gisela Schulte, property master Kenny Gibbs. Series director Martin Wood portrays a NID agent.

===Filming===
Peter DeLuise directed the episode, whilst Peter Woeste oversaw cinematography. The shows standing Stargate Command set at The Bridge Studios in Burnaby, British Columbia was used for filming, whilst Bridge Studios itself was featured throughout as the movie studio where the fictional &quot;Wormhole X-Treme!&quot; is filmed. The production team originally considered digitally altering the Bridge Studios signage to show the &quot;Wormhole X-Treme!&quot; branding, but ultimately dropped the idea. DeLuise opted to fill the Bridge backlot with as many easter eggs as he could, including props from &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; such as the Asgard puppet and a Goa&#x27;uld Death Glider model. He also looked to Disneyfy the backlot, hoping to give it a &quot;&#x27;circus-type&#x27; atmosphere&quot; and make it far more colourful and alive through having crew everywhere, added set dressing and saturating the scenes in post-production.

An incomplete set for a Goa&#x27;uld space station interior, which was being constructed for the then upcoming &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; two-parter &quot;Summit&quot;/&quot;Last Stand&quot; ended up being used by DeLuise in the episode as a set for the show-within-a-show, &quot;Wormhole X-Treme!&quot;. The Zephyr Mercury building on Boundary Road was used for the O&#x27;Neill, Matin and Tanner interrogation scene. For the warehouse being used by the NID, production took over a car dealership across the street from Bridge Studios, whilst the frequently used Richmond Sand Dunes features as the final location of the episode.

During filming, DeLuise realised they would not have enough usable material to make the required episode length. In considering what else could be added, DeLuise thought of his father, Dom DeLuise, and how many of his films had bloopers at the end. Although usually resistant to bloopers, DeLuise convinced Brad Wright to include a &quot;making of &quot;Wormhole X-Treme!&quot;&quot; segment to end the episode, combining fake bloopers and interviews with the cast of the show-within-the-show. Under DeLuise and Wright&#x27;s guidance, Michael DeLuise, Teed, Duncanson and Bocher recorded some two hours of additional and largely unscripted and improvisational material. Peter DeLuise&#x27;s director&#x27;s cut of the episode featured real bloopers of the &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; cast that was ultimately omitted from the broadcast and home release versions. Additionally, a scene involving Teal&#x27;c watching the trailer for &quot;Wormhole X-Treme!&quot; &quot;laughing uproariously and enjoying the hell out of the show – much to the bewilderment of his fellow team members&quot; was cut by Wright during editing.

==Cultural references==

One of Tanner&#x27;s men uses the alias &quot;Steve Austin,&quot; a reference to the character of the same name from the 1973 television series &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man,&quot; which Robert C. Cooper was a fan of. Although &quot;a show about a talking dog who solves crimes&quot; was included in the script, it was Richard Dean Anderson who, as an ad-lib decided to mention the unsold television pilot &quot;Poochinski&quot; by name. According to DeLuise, the green-skinned &quot;Wormhole X-Treme!&quot; aliens were an homage to the Orions from &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

==Release==
===Broadcast===
The episode first aired on September 8, 2001, on Showtime in the United States. The episode was moved from its usual Sunday slot to Saturday night and was preceded by a &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; marathon to mark the hundredth episode. The episode was first syndicated in the week of February 24, 2003 where it received a 2.4 Nielsen rating. In the United Kingdom the episode was first shown on November 21, 2001, on Sky 1.

===Reception===

Jan Vincent-Rudzki for TV Zone awarded the episode 10 out of 10, writing &quot;This is witty, well-written, well-directed, with some great in-jokes&quot;. Vincent-Rudzki applauded the episode for being &quot;semi-ridiculous and yet still quite dramatic episode&quot;, with a &quot;nice story&quot; for non-fans of the show to enjoy. Reviewing for IGN, Daniel Solis called it a &quot;Great, great episode&quot;, praising the &quot;side-splittingly accurate&quot; &quot;caricatures&quot; of &quot;SG-1&quot;. Andy Hall for DVD Times believed the episode was a &quot;great way to mark reaching 100 shows&quot; and that it &quot;hilariously sends up SG-1 and in fact many shows of the genre, by ruthlessly picking plot holes in the concept&quot;.

Brian Ford Sullivan for The Futon Critic placed the episode 50th in his &quot;The 50 Best Episodes of 2001&quot; list, calling it &quot;a grand celebration of how good this underappreciated series can be&quot; going on to applaud the episode for delivering &quot;some of the series&#x27; best laughs to date&quot;. Keith R.A. DeCandido for Tor.com described &quot;Wormhole X-Treme&quot; as &quot;a hilarious hundredth episode that celebrates by making fun of itself&quot;, applauding the return of Willie Garson&#x27;s Martin Lloyd. Reflecting on the episode in 2019, Helen Ashcroft for Screen Rant believed the episode was &quot;one of the most polarizing episodes in the entire show&quot;, claiming that &quot;While many hate it, there must be others who agree that it is a light-hearted fun diversion&quot;. Writing for &quot;Stargate&quot; fansite Gateworld, David Read noted &quot;A lot of people don’t consider this episode to be canon&quot;.

<doc id="1041088" wikidata="Q1347409" url="?curid=1041088" title="Epitaph (Charles Mingus composition)">
<text>Epitaph is a composition by jazz musician Charles Mingus. It is 4,235 measures long, takes more than two hours to perform, and was only completely discovered during the cataloguing process after his death. With the help of a grant from the Ford Foundation, the score and instrumental parts were copied, and the work itself was premiered by a 30-piece orchestra, conducted by Gunther Schuller and produced by Mingus&#x27;s widow, Sue, at Alice Tully Hall on June 3, 1989, 10 years after his death, and issued as a live album. It was performed again at several concerts in 2007.

Accurately convinced that it would never be performed in his lifetime, Mingus called his work &quot;Epitaph&quot; declaring that it was written &quot;for my tombstone.&quot;

==1962 version==
There was one ill-fated attempt to record some of &quot;Epitaph&quot; during Mingus&#x27;s lifetime, in New York City on October 12, 1962. The album &quot;The Complete Town Hall Concert&quot; (United Artists UAJ 14024) includes the tracks &quot;Epitaph Pt. I&quot; and &quot;Epitaph Pt. II&quot;, as well as &quot;Clark in the Dark&quot;, for trumpeter Clark Terry, who played in the band.

The musicians included:

Saxes and woodwinds
*Danny Bank (contrabass clarinet)
*Romeo Penque (oboe)
*Buddy Collette (alto saxophone)
*Eric Dolphy (alto saxophone)
*Charlie Mariano (alto saxophone)
*Charles McPherson (alto saxophone)
*George Berg (tenor saxophone)
*Zoot Sims (tenor saxophone)
*Jerome Richardson (baritone saxophone)
*Pepper Adams (baritone saxophone)

Trumpets
*Eddie Armour
*Rolf Ericson
*Lonnie Hillyer
*Ernie Royal
*Clark Terry
*Richard Williams
*Snooky Young

Trombones and tuba
*Eddie Bert
*Jimmy Cleveland
*Willie Dennis
*Quentin Jackson
*Britt Woodman
*Paul Faulise

Rhythm section
*Warren Smith (vibraphone, percussion)
*Les Spann (guitar)
*Toshiko Akiyoshi (piano)
*Jaki Byard (piano)
*Charles Mingus (bass)
*Milt Hinton (bass)
*Dannie Richmond (drums)
*Grady Tate (percussion)

A review by Bill Coss appeared in the December 6, 1962, edition of &quot;Down Beat&quot; titled &quot;A Report of a Most Remarkable Event&quot;, and was reprinted in the January 2005 edition.

The concert/recording was extremely disorganized. From the liner notes: &quot;...this record represents a curious combination of open recording session and concert on a New York City Town Hall stage that held thirty musicians, two men still copying the music to be played, no play-back equipment, and a host of unbelievable tensions.&quot;

From Martin Williams&#x27;s review: &quot;The occasion was supposed to have been a public recording date, but the producers&#x27; announcements and ads somehow came out reading &#x27;concert.&#x27; At one point during the proceedings, Mingus shouted to his audience, advising, &#x27;Get your money back!&#x27;&quot;

From the Coss article: 

The problems seem to have arisen because Mingus had piles of new music in his head, and wanted to stage an open rehearsal which United Artists and producer Alan Douglas wanted to record and release. Then UA moved up the date five weeks, Mingus kept writing even newer music while rehearsals were underway, the musicians were unprepared (the Coss article suggests that in three previous rehearsals not one piece had been played all the way through), and audience members had apparently been expecting a fully rehearsed concert rather than a taping session with false starts and retakes.

==1989 version==
After Mingus&#x27;s death, the score to &quot;Epitaph&quot; was rediscovered by Andrew Homzy, director of the jazz program at Concordia University, Montreal. He had been invited by Sue Mingus to catalogue a trunkful of Mingus&#x27;s handwritten charts and in the process had discovered a vast assortment of orchestral pages written by Mingus with measures numbered consecutively well into the thousands. After some investigation, Homzy realized what it was that he had found and eventually managed to reassemble the &quot;Epitaph&quot; score. At that point Homzy and Sue Mingus got in touch with Gunther Schuller, who put together an all-star orchestra to play this very demanding piece of music. However, despite the stellar cast that was assembled, problems were again encountered. Thirty years earlier, charts were being copied in the wings before the show. This time, the charts were all computerized, but the software was buggy and again charts were being sight-read at the last minute.

This was no mean feat. &quot;Epitaph&quot; resembles many other Mingus compositions in level of difficulty. Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, pointing at a passage in the score said, &quot;That looks like something you would find in an Etude Book... under &#x27;Hard&#x27;.&quot; And conductor Gunther Schuller stated &quot;The only comparison I&#x27;ve ever been able to find is the great iconoclastic American composer Charles Ives.&quot; Despite all these challenges, however, the concert, at Alice Tully Hall in New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center in 1989, was a critical triumph, if ten years too late for Charles Mingus to enjoy it. The same personnel performed the piece two days later at the Wolf Trap Farm Park outside of Washington, DC. A double-CD was later released by Columbia/Sony Records. The concert was also filmed, and broadcast on U.K. television around 1990. The 1989 recording at Alice Tully Hall was recorded by John McClure and David Hewitt on Remote Recording Services&#x27; Silver Truck.

<text>Divine Word College is a private undergraduate Roman Catholic seminary in Epworth, Iowa. Founded in 1964, It educates students for missionary service in the Catholic Church as priests, brothers, sisters, and laypersons. It is owned and operated by the Society of the Divine Word (SVD). 

==History==
Founded in 1875 in Steyl, the Netherlands, the Society of the Divine Word (SVD) sent the first Divine Word Missionary, Joseph Freinademetz to China by 1879. In 1895, Brother Wendelin Meyer went to America. By 1909, the Society had established the first seminary in the United States with the mission of training priest and brother candidates for service in foreign missions. The Society of the Divine Word originally established a Divine Word Seminary in 1912 at Techny, Illinois. In 1931, the Society purchased property in Epworth, Iowa, where it established St. Paul&#x27;s Mission House, an SVD high school seminary. In 1964, Divine Word College replaced the high school seminary and has since served as the principal site of SVD undergraduate seminary education in the United States.

== Student life ==
During their final semester of undergraduate studies at Divine Word College, young men who choose to continue with the SVD may apply for the Society&#x27;s one-year novitiate program at the Chicago Province Headquarters in Techny, Illinois. These men may then apply to profess first vows as members of the Society near the end of the novitiate program and continue with seminary studies at the Chicago Theologate.

<doc id="1041090" wikidata="Q4496059" url="?curid=1041090" title="Kitty Harris">
<text>Kitty Harris (died 6 October 1966) was a Canadian-born Soviet secret agent and &quot;long-time special courier of the OGPU-NKVD foreign intelligence during the 1930s and 1940s.&quot;
Although mentioned by name in Walter Krivitsky’s book &quot;I was Stalin’s agent&quot;, Harris was identified only in 2001 when her code name &quot;Ada&quot; or &quot;Aida&quot; was found in declassified files from the Venona project. This was a counterintelligence program initiated by the United States Army&#x27;s Signal Intelligence Service (later the National Security Agency) that ran from February 1, 1943 until October 1, 1980.

==Career==
Catherine (the earliest spelling is Katherine) Harris was born to a poor Polish Jewish family, probably in London, Ontario, sometime between 1893 and 1902. Her father was a shoemaker from Białystok, in the Grodno Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Poland). The family migrated to Winnipeg, Canada in 1904-1905. She began to work, first in a cigar factory, then in a clothing factory as a seamstress in 1912. She joined the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW or &quot;Wobblies&quot;) union and was a leader of the 1919 Winnipeg General Strike. Between 1919 and 1923, Harris moved with her family to Chicago.

In Chicago, Harris became secretary of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers local. She joined the Communist Party of the USA by January 1923. In 1925, Harris may have married Earl Browder, a prominent CPUSA functionary and later party leader. Harris transferred to the Communist Party of the USSR in 1927. A year later, she visited Shanghai, China, with Browder: there, he became secretary of the Pan-Pacific Trade Union Secretariat, (part of the Comintern) and she became a courier. She followed Browder to Moscow in 1929, where he reported for &quot;special work&quot;. Harris returned to the USA and worked for the American Negro Labor Congress.

In 1931, Harris joined OGPU foreign intelligence under &quot;Illegal&quot; operative Abram Einhorn. She went to work in Berlin (a centre of Soviet espionage operations, particularly passport forgery) in 1932. In October 1935, she went to Moscow for training in radio operation, photography, and cryptography.

In 1936, Harris went to Paris as an NKVD radio operator. The following year, she returned to Moscow for training in the use of new equipment and then went to London as keeper and courier of a safe house. Under &quot;rezident&quot; Gregory Grafpen, she liaised with Donald Maclean of the Cambridge Five. In 1938, she followed Maclean to Paris as liaison. Maclean married an American in 1939: his relationship with Harris ended. When France fell to the Nazis in 1940, she escaped to Moscow, where she worked in the NKGB foreign intelligence reserve.

Harris went to the United States to assist the Soviet penetration of the Manhattan Project in 1941. In 1943, she went to Mexico City as courier for &quot;resident spy&quot; Lev Vasilevsky. Vasilevsky sent her to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where her role included running a safe house within a drugstore.

In December 1937, Harris had applied for and received Soviet citizenship. When she retired from active service, she received an apartment in Riga. There, problems with alcoholism and mental illness surfaced. Harris died in Gorky in 1966. She is buried there in the Marina Roshcha cemetery with a grave marker that lists her date of birth as 24 May 1902.

<text>Carl Cameron (born September 22, 1961, as Karl Emil Othmar Lamberg-Karlovsky) is an American journalist and was a reporter for Fox News for two decades. In 2019 he founded the progressive news aggregator, &quot;Front Page Live&quot;, where he is chief political correspondent.

==Life and career==
As a child Cameron spent time in Iran, where his Jewish father C.C. Lamberg-Karlovsky, a distinguished member of the Harvard faculty, worked as an archaeologist. He grew up in New Hampshire and attended Bates College. He began his media career in 1985 at radio stations WFEA and WZID in Manchester, New Hampshire, first being hired as a salesman at WFEA and breaking into broadcasting when the weather man was sick one day. Later he worked as political director for WMUR-TV, the ABC affiliate in Manchester.

In 1995, Fox News hired Cameron, and he covered the 1996 presidential election. He joined Fox News full-time as its first Capitol Hill Correspondent in 1996 and has since covered every presidential election; Shepard Smith dubbed him &quot;Campaign Carl&quot; and he is often introduced on-air by that nickname.

After the 2000 elections, Fox News named Cameron its first Chief Political Correspondent, and after the 2004 elections, he was named its first Chief White House Correspondent. In June 2006, Cameron returned to his job as Chief Political Correspondent to cover the 2006 midterm elections and prepare for the 2008 presidential campaign.

Stories he has broken include George W. Bush&#x27;s 1976 drunk driving arrest, as well as Israel&#x27;s involvement in surveillance on US federal officials and agencies such as the Drug Enforcement Administration leading up to 9/11, including inconclusive reports of Israeli foreknowledge of al-Qa&#x27;ida activities prior to the attacks.

On August 22, 2017, Cameron announced his retirement from Fox News. In June 2019, he founded the progressive news aggregator, &quot;Front Page Live&quot;, together with Joe Romm, its Editor-in-Chief, Laura Dawn, Sunny Hundal, Helen Stickler, his wife Moira Hopkins, and others. Cameron is Chief Political Correspondent.

==Reception==

As a radio reporter in New Hampshire, Cameron was several times named a top reporter by the state Associated Press Broadcasters Association; both &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described him as &quot;smart&quot; and &quot;brash&quot;. In 2004, Cameron posted a news story on the Fox News website that included fabricated quotes from John Kerry, in which the Senator purportedly called himself a &quot;metrosexual&quot; and Bush a &quot;cowboy&quot;. Fox News spokesman Paul Schur later said it was intended to be an internal joke not for publication, and the network apologized for the piece. Cameron was reprimanded.

In June 2009, &quot;Washingtonian Magazine&quot; named Cameron one of the top 50 journalists in the nation&#x27;s capital, saying: &quot;[P]layers on both sides of the aisle trust &#x27;Campaign Carl&#x27; and know that his reporting is second to none.&quot; A 2012 profile in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Cameron as a very hard-working journalist often considered &quot;a member of the home team&quot; at Republican campaign events, yet characterized by reporters from rival networks as collegial and unbiased in his reporting. His &quot;less polished&quot; appearance was said to contrast with that of other Fox reporters; NBC News&#x27; Chuck Todd, an avowed fan of Cameron&#x27;s, quipped, &quot;[i]t’s nice to see that there are other guys in TV who didn&#x27;t get there for their looks&quot;.

==Personal life==
Cameron is married to Moira Hopkins, a former technician for Fox News who accompanied him on the campaign trail and now works with him as Executive Producer at &quot;Front Page Live&quot;.

<text>Robert Hall Haynes, OC, FRSC (27 August 1931 – 22 December 1998) was a Canadian geneticist and biophysicist. He was the Distinguished Research Professor in the Department of Biology at York University. Haynes was best known for his contributions to the study of DNA repair and mutagenesis, and for helping promote the concept of terraforming through his invention of the term, ecopoiesis.

Haynes was one of the earliest geneticists to recognize the fundamental biological importance of the vulnerability of DNA to damage and therefore the central role of DNA repair processes. As he noted, “DNA is composed of rather ordinary molecular subunits, which certainly are not endowed with any peculiar kind of quantum mechanical stability. Its very chemical vulgarity makes it prey to all the chemical horrors and misfortune that might befall any such molecule in a warm aqueous medium.”

Haynes early life and scientific contributions have been summarized by Kunz et al. (1993) and Kunz and Hanawalt (1999).

<doc id="1041118" wikidata="Q3793923" url="?curid=1041118" title="The Blackwater Lightship">
<text>The Blackwater Lightship is a 1999 novel written by Irish novelist Colm Tóibín. It was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.

Tóibín conceived the book while traveling in Spain and, as he did not have access to a typewriter, bought a pen and notebook, which prompted his return to writing in longhand.

==Plot summary==

The story is set in Dublin and County Wexford and described from the viewpoint of Helen, a successful school principal living with her husband and two children in Ireland. She learns one day, that her brother Declan, who is homosexual, has been ill with AIDS for years, and refused to tell her until then. He asks her to deliver their mother and grandmother the news. This presents a challenge to Helen as she has had minimal contact with the two women due to deeply buried conflicts relating to Helen&#x27;s past and her father&#x27;s sudden death when she was a child.

As the three women meet again they are forced to overcome these struggles for Declan&#x27;s sake. The novel follows the painful journey they must take in order to correct the misunderstanding that exists between them.

==Reception==
Upon release, &quot;The Blackwater Lightship&quot; was generally well-received among British press. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Independent On Sunday&quot;, and &quot;Literary Review&quot; reviews under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; and &quot;TLS&quot; reviews under &quot;Pretty Good&quot; and &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;Observer&quot; reviews under &quot;Ok&quot;.

&quot;The Blackwater Lightship&quot; was shortlisted for the 1999 Booker Prize.

Shortly after this, whilst out endeavouring to purchase groceries in Dublin, Tóibín was pursued by drivers of cars. The car drivers flashed and honked the horn at him. Presently, one young man ceased his act of flashing and honking the horn at Tóibín. The young man emerged from his vehicle. He threw his arms aloft. He proceeded to utter &quot;Yah! Yah!&quot; at Tóibín. According to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, this was an act of &quot;saluting the Booker acknowledgment&quot; by a fellow countryman.

Toibín&#x27;s mother sent a lengthy letter to her son which in its entirety was a list of names of every person in his native town of Enniscorthy who had congratulated her on his achievement.

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==

The novel was made into a film and aired on CBS as a Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation. Angela Lansbury received an Emmy nomination for it in 2004. It also stars Gina McKee, Sam Robards, Dianne Wiest, and Keith McErlean; and was directed by John Erman.
