<text>Luleå ( , , ; ; ) is a city on the coast of northern Sweden, and the capital of Norrbotten County, the northernmost county in Sweden. Luleå has 48,728 inhabitants in its urban core as of 2018 and is the seat of Luleå Municipality with a total population of about 79,000 as of 2023. Luleå is Sweden&#x27;s 25th largest city and Norrbotten County&#x27;s largest city. Luleå is considered as the world&#x27;s largest brackish water archipelago with 1,312 islands, several rivers and vast forestland.

Luleå has the seventh biggest harbor in Sweden for shipping goods. It has a large steel industry and is a center for extensive research. It is also home to the Swedish Air Force Wing Norrbotten Wing (F 21) based in Luleå Airport. Luleå University of Technology is one of Sweden&#x27;s three technology universities with around 15,000 students and is the northernmost university in Sweden.

== History ==
The town&#x27;s Royal charter was granted in 1621 by King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. The original town was situated where Gammelstad (Old Town) is situated today. The town had to be moved in 1649 to the current site, due to the post-glacial rebound that had made the bay too shallow for ships to enter.

In 1805, Luleå only had 947 inhabitants, but in 1865 Luleå succeeded Piteå as the county town in Norrbotten county and now had around 1400 residents. In the 1860s the industries also started taking root in the city.

The town was plagued by fires in 1653, 1657 and 1887, and the fire in 1887 was a devastating fire that destroyed most of the town, sparing only a few buildings. The Neo-Gothic Cathedral (originally the Oscar Fredrik church), dedicated in 1893, standing at 67 meters (220 ft), is the tallest building in town.

The town&#x27;s northern location and that it will become a hub for data traffic in Europe has generated a new epithet for the Luleå region – The Node Pole. The Node Pole region provides stable, low-cost electricity that is 100-percent derived from renewable sources.

<text>Haparanda (; Meänkieli and Finnish: &quot;Haaparanta&quot;, ) is a locality and the seat of Haparanda Municipality in Norrbotten County, Sweden. It is adjacent to Tornio, Finland. Haparanda has a population of 9,166 inhabitants (2024).

Haparanda is located near the Sweden-Finland border, at the northerly extreme of the Swedish coastline, as well as the easternmost point in Sweden, far removed from large cities. Its summers are very warm for a coastal location so far north, and winters are normally not extremely cold in spite of the relative proximity to the Arctic Circle.

As a twin city, Haparanda has strong connections to Tornio and the Finnish side of the river and bilingualism of Swedish and Finnish is common although Swedish is the sole official language and the mother tongue of a vast majority of inhabitants. In 2010, it was estimated that 70% of Haparanda&#x27;s inhabitants spoke Finnish as a second language.

Haparanda, for historical reasons, is often still referred to as a &quot;city&quot; despite its small population, although Statistics Sweden only counts localities with more than 10,000 inhabitants as cities. The municipality itself, on the other hand, uses the term (City of Haparanda) not only for the town itself, but for its whole territory (). At 24° 8&#x27; E, Haparanda is Sweden&#x27;s easternmost settlement.

== History ==

When Sweden ceded Finland to Russia in 1809, the Finnish–Swedish border was drawn along the Rivers Tornio and Muonio. The town of Tornio, located on the island Suensaari in the river delta, became part of the Grand Duchy of Finland within the Russian Empire as demanded by czar Alexander I. (Finland declared independence in 1917.)

At that time the town of Tornio was dominated by Swedish-speaking merchants and craftsmen, forming a linguistic island in a Finnish-speaking countryside. After the war many of the Swedes started to develop the small village of Haaparanta across the border instead (Haparanda and Tornio are within walking distance), eventually leaving Tornio unilingually Finnish. Haparanda was made a market town (&quot;köping&quot;) in 1821 and received its city charter in 1842.

Into the early twentieth century Haparanda enjoyed commercial and political significance out of proportion to its size because of its position at the mouth of the Torne river at the head of the Gulf of Bothnia. Timber and furs from across northern Scandinavia and Russia arrived by water for shipping on to the rest of the world via the Baltic. Arctic and Antarctic expeditions of the 19th and 20th centuries, including that of Admiral Peary of the US, wore furs supplied by Hermansons, whose shop still stands in Haparanda, albeit closed now. Haparanda was the only open railway border crossing at the border to Russia during World War I, and was used by Lenin on the journey by which he returned from exile.

==Sports==
Haparanda/Tornio play in the second tier bandy division in Sweden, allsvenskan. Haparanda hosted matches in the Bandy World Championship 2001.

Other sports clubs located in Haparanda include:

* Asplöven HC (ice hockey)
* Haparanda FF (football)

== The impact of the Finland-Sweden international border ==
Relations between the neighbouring towns have always been friendly. A large portion of Haparanda&#x27;s population speak both Swedish and Finnish. Today the two towns are closely interconnected economically and socially; they constitute a transborder conurbation marketed as &quot;EuroCity&quot;. Since Sweden and Finland are in different time zones, Haparanda is one hour behind Tornio. This allows a unique spectacle on New Year&#x27;s Eve, when people can welcome the arriving year twice. Since 2005 the cities have rebranded themselves as &quot;Haparanda-Tornio&quot; in Sweden, and &quot;Tornio-Haparanda&quot; in Finland.

In 2020 and 2021, this interconnectedness has experienced economic interruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the differing national responses in Sweden and Finland. Sweden has generally speaking implemented slightly laxer restrictions while Finland has closed borders and slightly stronger restrictions. Some Swedes have also experienced prejudice on the Finnish side of the border, by Finns, due to the worsening pandemic situation in Sweden.

Haparanda has a railway station, which is served by three trains per day on weekdays. The line was closed to passenger trains between 1992 and 2021, when passenger services restarted. This was the only route open between Russia and Germany in World War I, and during World War II many of the approximately 80,000 Finnish children evacuated to Sweden entered the country here.

75,000 WWI prisoners of war were exchanged between the warring sides and 27,000,000 kg of mail, mostly from or to prisoners of war, was sorted at Haparanda.

== Rail gauge ==

Haparanda is connected to the Swedish national network by the Haparandabanan (Haparanda railway). The bridge between Haparanda and Tornio is the only direct connection between the Swedish and Finnish rail systems. The two networks use different track gauges, requiring all freight wagons crossing the border to have their cargo reloaded or their bogies exchanged. Between Haparanda and Tornio there is a dual gauge track, with Swedish and Finnish , in a four-rail gauntlet track formation.

== Buildings ==
An IKEA retail store opened 15 November 2006 in a new commercial enterprise zone at the Haparanda-Tornio border, and is the northernmost IKEA store in the world. Though goods are priced in Swedish kronor only, instore signage is in both Swedish and Finnish. This single store attracts a claimed two million visitors every year, and has triggered &quot;piggy-back&quot; development of other large-scale retail outlets and a prototypical US-style shopping mall on the site. Although shops in Haparanda itself accept euros and Swedish kronor, many have closed in the face of competition from the out of town development.

Notable buildings besides the rail station (1918) include the Stadshotell (hotel and former town hall) of 1900, which has a first floor stateroom with magnificent chandeliers of Orrefors glass, and the landmark pepperpot-shaped watertower, erected in 1920. It no longer provides all the town&#x27;s water, only the communal hot water supply. Haparanda&#x27;s uncompromisingly modern church is by Bengt Larsson of the ELLT studio, and dates from 1967, its predecessor being destroyed by fire in 1964.

Plans for a new building containing a multipurpose arena seating 2,500 and more commercial development were announced in 2013. It will be sited on the border. Construction started in 2016 with a planned completion date in 2018. 
== Climate ==
Haparanda has a subarctic climate courtesy of its northerly position, but in spite of this classification the climate is often quite mild. The marine airflow from the mild North Atlantic tempers winters in spite of the low sun, whilst Haparanda retains enough continental influence for summers to be relatively warm, especially for a coastal city so far north. This is due to the large landmass surrounding the city in most directions as well as the brief midnight sun that normally lasts around 10 days. During summer, daylight is prevalent enough to allow daytime activities around the clock for a longer period than that. During the winter solstice however, Haparanda only experiences 2 hours and 56 minutes of daylight.

Daytime temperature average ranges normally goes between in summer to in winter, with winters being milder than many continental climates. Due to summer temperatures rapidly dropping once daylight diminishes, Haparanda does not reach such a classification.

== Notable people ==

<text>Piteå (; ) is a locality and the seat of Piteå Municipality in Norrbotten County, Sweden. Piteå is Sweden&#x27;s 58th largest city, with a population of 23,326.

== Geography ==
Piteå is located at the mouth of the Pite River (), at the shore of the Bay of Bothnia. The central part is located on an islet called Häggholmen, which due to post-glacial rebound almost has become a part of the mainland; the land in northern Sweden rises at a rate of up to per year.

Piteå&#x27;s coastal location, with numerous islands and inlets, is one of the reasons it is a popular place for tourism both in summer and winter. It features a beach resort area called Pite Havsbad, around which there is a spa, a long sandy beach, a restaurant and a golf course. The area is also suitable for fishing and outdoor activities. In the winter, snow activities such as skiing and winter bathing are common. The water temperatures reportedly being Sweden&#x27;s warmest during three consecutive summers in the 1950s, the beach then became known as &quot;Norrbotten&#x27;s Riviera&quot;.

== Climate ==
Piteå has a climate that is classified as subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification Dfc), bordering to a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb).

The warmest months in Piteå are June, July, and August, with high temperatures of . The coldest are December, January, and February, with low temperatures of .

== History ==

Piteå received its city privileges on 12 May 1621. The name Piteå comes from the Piteälven (Pite River, one of the four major rivers in Norrland). The town was originally situated slightly north of its current location, in present-day Öjebyn. In July 1666, the entire town burnt down, and over the following few years it was rebuilt on &quot;Häggholmen&quot;, a small island which forms the nucleus of present-day Piteå. In 1721, the new town was burnt down by Russian troops during the Russian Pillage of 1719-1721, and the only building that remained was the church, which is still standing.

The town square, where the town hall is located, has kept its structure from the 17th century. It is one of only two squares in Sweden with closed corners; the other one is in Uppsala.

Piteå&#x27;s population has increased rapidly since the 19th century. In the years 1870–1920, Piteå had a population of only 2,500 people. Part of the early population increase is attributed to the 1911 opening of the Älvsbyn-Piteå railway branch, as well as industrial establishments and the harbour.

Piteå has traditionally had a strong forestry industry; papermills, sawmills, and its harbour are of some importance.

== Culture ==
Piteå is known for its pitepalt, a food dish consisting of potato dumplings with chopped pork filling. The area is also known for its dialect, called Pitemål, which however is mainly spoken by elders in surrounding villages.

Piteå has a fast food drive-thru commonly used by snowmobilers. The restaurant was a McDonald&#x27;s from February 2002 to November 2007. Several McDonald&#x27;s restaurants in Norrbotten closed at the time, in the face of competition from Max Hamburgers. The restaurant is now part of the Frasses hamburger chain. The drive-thru has received international coverage, including on The Travel Channel in an episode called &quot;Most Unique McDonald&#x27;s&quot;.

Piteå has a sister city in the Caribbean: Gustavia, capital of Saint Barthélemy, the formerly Swedish possession that is now part of France.

The School of music of Luleå University of Technology is located in Piteå.

==Cleantech==
Piteå has emerged as an important center of cleantech production and research based on cellulose byproducts. Chemrec operates a black liquor gasifier and the world&#x27;s first BioDME production facility, SunPine has pioneered a renewable diesel process technology using crude tall oil as feedstock, and ETC (Energy Technology Centre in Piteå) is a research and development center for renewable fuels with focus on combustion, gasification and biorefining processes.

==Sport==
The Piteå IF football team is playing in the fourth highest Swedish division, Division 2 for men; and the Piteå IF ladies team is for their first time playing in the highest league in football, Damallsvenskan.

Ice hockey is the big sport in town, even though Piteå HC only plays in the third-highest League (Division I) in Sweden. The club has provided many good players to the NHL and national team: examples are Tomas Holmström, Mikael Renberg, Mattias Öhlund, Lars Lindgren, Stefan Persson, Jan Sandström and Mats Lavander. Munksund-Skuthamns SK ladies team is, for their first time, playing in the highest league in Hockey, Riksserien. Rebecka Stenberg became the first woman from Piteå to play for the Swedish national team.

In cross-country skiing the town has a successful club called Piteå Elit, with skiers like Lina Andersson, Magdalena Pajala and Charlotte Kalla.

In competitive swimming, the town has a very successful team called Piteå Sim which is famous all over Norrland especially Norrbotten. One of the most famous swimmers in the club is 13-year-old Heidi Nilsson who got first place in the Junior, Senior and Ladies category in the Piteå Kanalsimmet 2018 which takes place every year on Valborgsmässoafton.

Other sports clubs located in Piteå include Storfors AIK, MSSK and the northern paintball team &#x27;Team X-rated&#x27;.

<text>Pajala () is a locality and the seat of Pajala Municipality in Norrbotten County, Sweden, with 1,958 inhabitants in 2010. It is located in Swedish Lapland.

Pajala is in part of the Meänmaa (Torne valley) region and was in past times unilingually Meänkieli-speaking. While it is still spoken by many, after the Swedification policies of the 18- and 1900s Swedish has become the dominant language.

==History==
Lars Levi Laestadius, a botanist, Lutheran minister, and founder of the revivalist movement Laestadianism, lived and worked in Pajala municipality in the mid-19th century. He lived in Kengis, but in 1869 his house and grave and the whole church of Kengis were moved to Pajala.

The town was mistakenly bombed by Soviet airplanes during the Finnish/Soviet Winter War, in spring 1940. Seven Soviet planes dropped 134 bombs, a mix of explosive and firebombs, which destroyed six buildings, badly damaging telephone wires, and making the streets impossible to drive on due to 43 big craters. No human deaths were recorded, although two persons were slightly injured. Soviet officers later inspected the destruction and the Soviet Union paid damages to Sweden in 1940.

== Literature about Pajala ==
The events in Mikael Niemi&#x27;s book &quot;Populärmusik från Vittula&quot; (&quot;Popular Music from Vittula&quot;) occur mainly in Pajala. Vittula, or more properly &quot;Vittulajänkkä&quot;, is a colloquial name (vulgar in its Finnish-Sami etymology, roughly translating to &quot;The pussy swamp&quot;) for a certain garden suburb in Pajala. The book was also adapted into a film in 2004.

In another portrait of Pajala by Niemi, the crime novel &quot;Mannen som dog som en lax&quot; (&quot;The Man who Died like a Salmon&quot;), the author discusses the state of the minority language Meänkieli in Pajala today.

== Climate ==
Pajala has a harsh subarctic climate that is somewhat moderated by the influence of the North Atlantic. Its inland position and lower elevation cause warmer summers, and winters are a bit less cold than most areas on similar latitudes.

<text>Kalix (; Kalix dialect: &quot;Kôlis&quot; , ; ; ) is a locality and the seat of the Kalix Municipality in Norrbotten County, Sweden. The name Kalix is believed to originate from the Sami word &quot;Gáláseatnu&quot;, or &quot;Kalasätno&quot;, meaning &quot;The cold river&quot; the ancient name of the Kalix River. It had 7,299 inhabitants in 2005, out of 17,300 inhabitants in the municipality of Kalix.

== Kalix Löjrom ==

There is a culinary speciality specific to Kalix, called Kalix Löjrom, also referred to as caviar of Kalix. It is basically fish eggs (caviar) of the vendace, but because of the large influx of fresh water from the huge rivers around and in Kalix, this has transformed the taste of the fish eggs, rendering them unique in flavour to this area alone. It is the special mix of the elements bromine, strontium, iodine, selenium, molybdenum, barium and lithium, along with a unique ratio between strontium and barium, that makes the Kalixlöjrom unique, which is why the EU has granted the Protected Geographical Status for the Kalixlöjrom. The Kalix Löjrom has been present at many Nobel dinners through the years, and among others, the 1990 Gastronomy Academy gold medal winner Norbert Lang of Paul &amp; Norbert in Stockholm likes his Kalixlöjrom.

== Sites of interest ==
The archipelago outside the Kalix coast line has 792 islands.
Some of the larger islands in the Kalix archipelago include:

Bergön is known as having the best sauna in the Kalix archipelago. Halsön has a large white sand beach with barbecue camps. The true gem however, is Malören. Malören is the final outpost of the archipelago and has as such had maritime pilots placed there from the 1830s all the way up to 1967. The island has a church, a small village with houses mostly used as summer cabins today, but also interesting remains of a time past, like one or two graves, a labyrinth and a wreck. The archipelago is important to the people of Kalix - if one does not have a cabin there then at least a good boat to get from island to island in. And one of the summer highlights for the local population is the sailing races organized by the Kalix sail- and race boat society (Kalix Segel och Motorbåtssällskap, KSMS).

The perhaps most interesting building in Kalix is Kalix Church. The building of the church started in the first half of the 15th century. The first time it is mentioned in writing is in an indulgence letter written on June 29, 1472 by archbishop Jakob Ulfsson Örnfot of Uppsala. The letter of indulgence was written on the same day that the archbishop inaugurated the polyptych. The church also has a very interesting history, with a remarkably well preserved girl buried under the entrance dressed like a bride, and the fact that the church was used as a stable for the horses of the Russian army in 1808.

== History ==

About 4500 years ago the climate in the north of the Nordic countries started to warm up after the last ice age. The warmth together with isostasy made it possible to inhabit the area around Kalix.

Already around year 1000 Kalix had Goods from the forest and river which would cause people from the south to sail all the way up to Kalix. The tradition of trading seems to have continued across the centuries because when Carl von Linné and his apprentice Lars Montin visited the Kalix marketplace in 1732 and 1749 he complained about the haggling with the Kalix&#x27; traders which allowed the people of Kalix a good price On butter and tar but drove up the inflation in Stockholm.

Kalix as a socken (Nordic name for Local geographic area with its own administration) was First mentioned in 1482. Before this point the area had been referred to with many different names: Caliss, Kaliss, Calixe, Calix and Neder Kalix. To confuse things further, a current municipality called Överkalix (Upper Kalix) was a part of the Kalix municipality until 1644, when it became its own municipality, with the result that people started referring to Kalix as &quot;Nederkalix (Lower Kalix).

During the 18th century each village in the Kalix area had its own part of the river to fish Salmon and Common whitefish. The villages along the coast line caught Common bleak and Herring. Part of the catch was transported down south, along with Seal blubber and tar. Around 1660 a copper mine was opened south of Bodträsk by Moån village. At the end of the 18th century Björkfors village also opened a mine, and in Törefors village an iron mine opened in 1801.

On March 25, 1809, Kalix was the location of the capitulation of the Swedish Army in the Finnish war. In effect it surrendered Finland to Russia. Peace talks were initiated in the Finnish town Fredrikshamn (or &quot;Hamina&quot; in Finnish), and a peace treaty was signed on August 30.

== Economy ==
The biggest employer in Kalix is the municipality, with 1600 employees. The hospital in Kalix comes second with 503 employees.

In the private sector the biggest employers are: 
* Billerud Karlsborg AB 420 employees
* Part AB 164 employees
* Borö pannan AB 110 employees
* Samhall AB 110 employees
* Silja Line/Tallink AB 83 employees

The income and employment for many people in Kalix still revolves around the forest industry (Billerud Karlsborg AB and partially Part AB). Billerud is a paper packaging industry. Karlsborg is today one of Europe&#x27;s biggest makers of white, porous paper for packaging of building materials, but they also have production of other strong packaging paper, and some white, long fiber sulphate mass. Part AB makes prefabricated bathrooms that they sell all over Europe. Borö Pannan AB makes accumulator tanks for water heating. Silja Line/Tallink AB are a phone service based office, taking advantage of the perception that the northern accent is pleasant to listen to over the phone, not to mention that the salaries up north are lower than in the south of Sweden.

The financial situation for the municipality of Kalix looks dark. The economy of the municipality has deteriorated over the past few years. In 2005 the tax incomes from local inhabitants was 562.5 million SEK in 2005 compared to 616.2 million SEK in 2008, but even so, the debt has increased by 8,8% (from 459,278,410 SEK to 499,997,708 SEK). During the same time period, meaning 2005 to 2008, the tax subsidies from the state taxes has increased from 197.1 million SEK to 210.1 million SEK. The municipality population has been steadily decreasing since 1955, and 321 people have left the municipality just between 2005 and 2008. Kalix has, in other words, a smaller population with a higher tax pressure, but also a much bigger debt than ever before.

<text>Överkalix (; ) is a locality and the seat of Överkalix Municipality in Norrbotten County, Sweden with 975 inhabitants in 2010.

==Climate==
Överkalix has a subarctic climate with significant temperature differences between the warm short summers and the long and cold winters. Its inland position close to sea level ensures Överkalix is more prone to heatwaves than other areas of Norrbotten. Its July temperatures are also due to the perpetual daylight due to its position just below the Arctic Circle. This results in July days being warmer on average than other European cities as far south as Manchester and Dublin in the British Isles. However, temperatures fall quickly once daylight diminishes, but winters are still less severe than other parts of the world at similar parallels due to mild North Atlantic air somewhat tempering cold extremes. The climate is quite dry for Scandinavia, with average annual precipitation being at .

==Överkalix Study==
The Överkalix study () was a study conducted on the physiological effects of various environmental factors on transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. The study was conducted utilizing historical records, including harvests and food prices, in Överkalix, a small isolated municipality in northeast Sweden. The study was of 303 probands, 164 men and 139 women, born in 1890, 1905, or 1920, and their 1,818 children and grandchildren. 44 were still alive in 1995 when mortality follow-up stopped. Mortality risk ratios (RR) on children and grandchildren were determined based on available food supply, as indicated by historical data.

Set in a dystopian American society in the year 2000, the film centers on the murderous Transcontinental Road Race, in which participants score points by striking and killing pedestrians. David Carradine stars as &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, the leading champion of the race, who is targeted by an underground rebel movement seeking to abolish the race. The cast also features Simone Griffeth, Sylvester Stallone, Mary Woronov, Martin Kove, and Don Steele.

Noting the publicity surrounding the film &quot;Rollerball&quot; (1975), Roger Corman sought to develop his own futuristic sports action film, and optioned the rights to Ib Melchior&#x27;s 1956 short story &quot;The Racer&quot;. Paul Bartel was hired to direct. The film was released on April 27, 1975. It initially received mixed critical reviews but was a considerable commercial success, grossing over $5 million from a sub-$1 million budget.

In the years since its release, critics have praised the film&#x27;s political and social satire, and it has developed a strong cult following. It spawned a 2008 remake, entitled &quot;Death Race&quot;, and a 2017 sequel film, &quot;Death Race 2050&quot;.

==Plot==
After the &quot;World Crash of &#x27;79&quot;, massive civil unrest and economic ruin occurs. The United States government is restructured into a totalitarian regime under martial law. To pacify the population, the government has created the Transcontinental Road Race, where a group of drivers race across the country in their high-powered cars and which is infamous for violence, gore, and innocent pedestrians being struck and killed for bonus points. In 2000, the five drivers in the 20th annual race, who all adhere to professional wrestling-style personas and drive appropriately themed cars, include Frankenstein, the mysterious black-garbed champion and national hero; Machine Gun Joe Viterbo, a Chicago gangster; Calamity Jane, a cowgirl; Matilda the Hun, a Neo-Nazi; and Nero the Hero, a Roman gladiator. Joe, the second-place champion, is the most determined of all to defeat Frankenstein and win the race.

A resistance group led by Thomasina Paine, a descendant of the 1770s American Revolutionary War hero Thomas Paine, plans to rebel against the regime, currently led by a man known only as Mr. President, by sabotaging the race, killing most of the drivers, and taking Frankenstein hostage as leverage against Mr. President. The group is assisted by Paine&#x27;s granddaughter Annie Smith, Frankenstein&#x27;s navigator. She plans to lure him into an ambush in order to have him replaced by a double. Despite a pirated national broadcast made by Ms. Paine herself, the Resistance&#x27;s disruption of the race is covered up by the government and instead blamed on the French, who are also blamed for ruining the country&#x27;s economy and telephone system.

At first, the Resistance&#x27;s plan seems to bear fruit: Nero the Hero is killed when a &quot;baby&quot; he runs over for points turns out to be a bomb, Matilda the Hun drives off a cliff while following a fake detour route set up by the Resistance, and Calamity Jane, who witnessed Matilda the Hun&#x27;s death, inadvertently drives over a land mine. This leaves only Frankenstein and Machine Gun Joe in the race. As Frankenstein nonchalantly survives every attempt made on his life during the race, Annie comes to discover that Frankenstein&#x27;s mask and disfigured face are merely a disguise; he is, in fact, one of a number of random wards of the state who are trained exclusively to race under that identity, and each time they die or are brutally mutilated, they are secretly replaced so that Frankenstein appears to be indestructible.

The current Frankenstein reveals to Annie his own plan to kill Mr. President: when he wins the race and shakes hands with Mr. President, he will detonate a grenade which has been implanted in his prosthetic right hand. However, the plan goes awry when Machine Gun Joe attacks Frankenstein and Annie is forced to kill him using Frankenstein&#x27;s &quot;hand grenade&quot;. Having successfully outmaneuvered both the rival drivers and the Resistance, Frankenstein is declared the winner of the race, although he is wounded and unable to carry out his original &quot;hand grenade&quot; attack plan. Annie instead dons Frankenstein&#x27;s costume and plans to stab Mr. President while standing in for him on the podium. Before she is able to do so, Thomasina shoots &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, convinced that he killed Annie. The real Frankenstein takes advantage of the confusion and rams Mr. President&#x27;s stage with his car, finally fulfilling his lifelong desire to kill him. Frankenstein becomes the new president, marries Annie and appoints Thomasina the Minister of Domestic Security to rebuild the state and dissolve the dictatorship. Junior Bruce, the announcer of the Transcontinental Road Race, opposes the race&#x27;s abolition and impertinently claims that the public needs performances of violence. Annoyed by his complaints, Frankenstein hits Bruce with his car and drives off with Annie to the cheers and applause of the crowd.

==Production==
===Development and writing===
Roger Corman wanted to make a futuristic action sports film to take advantage of the advance publicity of &quot;Rollerball&quot; (1975). He optioned a short story by Ib Melchior, an associate from his American International Pictures days, and hired Robert Thom to adapt it. Director Paul Bartel felt this was unshootable, so Charles B. Griffith rewrote it. Corman referred to the original story treatment as overly-serious and &quot;kind of vile&quot;, and reworked it to emphasize satire and camp.

Bartel was hired on the basis of his second unit work on &quot;Big Bad Mama&quot; (1974), which Corman produced. In a 1982 interview, Bartel said: &quot;Most of my guilty pleasures in this film were ripped out by the roots by Roger Corman before the film ever saw the light of day and substituted with crushed heads and blood squibs. Nevertheless, there is a joke about the French wrecking our economy and telephone system that I still find amusing. And I am pleased by the scene introducing the Girl Fan (played very effectively by my sister Wendy) who is to sacrifice herself beneath the wheels of David Carradine&#x27;s race car and wants to meet him so that the gesture will have &#x27;meaning&#x27;.&quot;

Bartel later recalled: &quot;We had terrible script problems; David had to finish his &quot;Kung Fu&quot; series before starting and we had bad weather. We all worked under terrible pressure. Roger and I had an essential disagreement over comedy. He took out a lot of the comedy scenes. He may have been right and was probably more objective.&quot; At one point in production, Bartel and Carradine clashed enough where the director had thought of replacing Carradine with Lee Majors, although they eventually reconciled and had a bond enough to help influence the ending of the film. Corman disagreed with the idea envisioned by Bartel for the ending involving a running over of a reporter character because the producer thought &quot;it would compromise the hero&quot;. Instead, Corman thought of an idea where the reporter is instead shot on the spot by FBI agents while Frankenstein makes light of such as &quot;sort of irresponsible question&quot; When it came time to film the ending, Bartel shot the ending seen in the final print without shooting the one envisioned by Corman because Carradine stated he &quot;wasn&#x27;t interested in fooling with the other one&quot; so the two simply moved on.

=== Casting ===
Corman wanted Peter Fonda to play the lead, but he read the script and said it was too ridiculous to make, so David Carradine was cast instead; Carradine wanted to take on a role that would make people think of him as more than just Caine on &quot;Kung Fu&quot; and give him a leg up on a movie career. Carradine was paid 10% of the film&#x27;s gross.

Sylvester Stallone was cast after Corman saw his performance in &quot;The Lords of Flatbush&quot; (1974). Up until his star-making role in &quot;Rocky&quot; the following year, &quot;Death Race 2000&quot; was the actor&#x27;s highest-profile performance. At Bartel&#x27;s direction, Stallone rewrote much of his character&#x27;s dialogue.

Shelley Winters turned down the role of Thomasina Paine. Character actress and dialect coach Harriet White Medin won the role after doing a pitch-perfect impression of Eleanor Roosevelt at an audition.

Paul Bartel&#x27;s sister Wendy appears as Laurie, the Frankenstein superfan who sacrifices herself to him.

Leslie McRay, who played Cleopatra, was originally offered the lead role of Annie, but she turned it down because she didn&#x27;t want to perform nude.

=== Filming ===
&quot;Death Race 2000&quot; was shot in locations around Southern California. Cinematographer Tak Fujimoto had previously shot &quot;Caged Heat&quot; for Corman.

Filming locations included the Chet Holifield Federal Building, the Pasadena Convention Center, Indiana Dunes National Park, and Angeles National Forest. The office complex of Los Angeles Center Studios doubled for &quot;Mercy Hospital&quot;. The racetrack scenes were shot at the Ontario Motor Speedway in Ontario, California. The production could not afford large numbers of extras to play the bystanders, so the scenes were shot after an actual racing event.

Due to the film&#x27;s low-budget, many scenes were shot on public roadways. David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone performed most of their own driving stunts. According to Corman, the custom-built cars were not street legal, and the stunt drivers refused to drive them where they could potentially be apprehended by police. Meanwhile, Mary Woronov did not know how to drive a car, so her close-ups were shot with her car towed behind a flatbed truck.

=== Music ===
The score was written by composer Paul Chihara, his first time writing music for film. Critic Donald Guarisco described Chihara&#x27;s score as &quot;eclectic ... [mixing] jazz, symphonic, funk, prog and electronica elements to create a constantly-shifting musical background with a delightful retro-futurist feel&quot;.

==Release==
===Home media===
Shout! Factory released a Deluxe Edition DVD and Blu-ray on June 22, 2010, in Region 1/A.

Previous video editions were released on VHS and DVD by Buena Vista Home Entertainment and New Concorde, among other studios.

==Reception==
===Box office===
According to &quot;Variety&quot;, the film earned $4.8 million in rentals in the United States. Another account says $5.25 million.

===Initial critical response===
Contemporary reviews were mixed. Lawrence Van Gelder of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film had &quot;nothing to say beyond the superficial about government or rebellion. And in the absence of such a statement, it becomes what it seems to have mocked—a spectacle glorifying the car as an instrument of violence.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;cartoonish but effective entertainment, with some good action sequences and plenty of black humor.&quot; Richard Combs of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that the comic conceits were &quot;too shaky to hold the movie together and tend to self-destruct some distance short of any pop allegory for America&quot;. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film one star out of four and wrote that it &quot;may be the goofiest and sleaziest film I&#x27;ve seen in the last five years&quot;. Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the film as &quot;one of the zippier little B pictures of the year&quot;, adding that &quot;it is designed primarily as a spectacle of kinetic titillation, and on that level, it&#x27;s a foregone smash hit&quot;. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was also positive, calling it &quot;a fine little action picture with big ideas&quot; and finding Carradine &quot;terrific&quot; in his role. In a February 2021 retrospective review, James Berardinelli gave the film 1 star out of 4; he said that it was similar to present-day releases by Blumhouse in that Roger Corman also made a lot of those types of low-budget horror/exploitation films and some were/are good but most are not, and simply summed up the 1975 film by calling it &quot;bad&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film zero stars in his review, deriding its violence and lamenting its appeal to small children. However, during a review of &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; on &quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper and the Movies&quot;, Ebert named &quot;Death Race 2000&quot; as part of a &quot;great tradition of summer drive-in movies&quot; that embrace a &quot;summer exploitation mentality in a clever way&quot;. While Ebert hinted that he did not find the film as awful decades later as he did in 1975, he made it plain he would not alter or disavow his original zero-stars rating for it either. He also gave a scathing review of the 2008 reboot &quot;Death Race&quot;.

=== Retrospective reviews ===
The film has garnered critical acclaim over the years, having a score of 82% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 39 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10, deeming it &quot;fresh&quot;. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;&quot;Death Race 2000&quot; is a fun, campy classic, drawing genuine thrills from its mindless ultra-violence.&quot;

The film has long been regarded as a cult hit and was often viewed as superior to &quot;Rollerball&quot;, a much more expensive major studio drama released later in the same year; another dystopian science-fiction sports film similarly focusing on the use of dangerous sports as an &quot;opiate&quot; for the masses.

===Year-end lists===
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2001: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills – Nominated

==Other media==
===Video games===
The 1982 video game &quot;Maze Death Race&quot; for ZX81 computers (and 1983 for ZX Spectrum) resembles the film by its cover artwork, title, and car-driving content.

The &quot;Carmageddon&quot; video game series borrows heavily from the plot, characters and car designs from the film &quot;Death Race 2000&quot;. The original game was supposed to be a game based on the comic series in the 1990s, but the plans were later changed.

===Comic books===
A comic book sequel series titled &quot;Death Race 2020&quot; was published in April–November 1995 by Roger Corman&#x27;s short-lived &quot;Roger Corman&#x27;s Cosmic Comics&quot; imprint. It was written by Pat Mills of &quot;2000 AD&quot; fame, with art by Kevin O&#x27;Neill (and additional art by Trevor Goring). Mills and O&#x27;Neill had already worked together on several comics, including &quot;Marshal Law&quot;. The comic book series, as the title indicates, takes place 20 years after the film ended and deals with Frankenstein&#x27;s return to the race. New racers introduced here included Von Dutch, the Alcoholic, Happy the Clown, Steppenwolf, Rick Rhesus, and Harry Carrie.

The comic book series lasted eight issues before being canceled and the story was left unfinished at the end.

===Remake series===
Paul W. S. Anderson directed a remake entitled &quot;Death Race&quot;, which was released August 22, 2008, starring Jason Statham. The remake began production in late August 2007. Besides Statham, this new version also stars Ian McShane, Joan Allen, and Tyrese Gibson. It also includes a cameo (by voice-over) of David Carradine, reprising his role of Frankenstein. Two direct-to-DVD prequels, titled &quot;Death Race 2&quot; (2010) and &quot;Death Race 3: Inferno&quot; (2013), starring Luke Goss, Tanit Phoenix, Danny Trejo and Ving Rhames, and a direct-to-DVD sequel, titled &quot;Death Race: Beyond Anarchy&quot; (2018), were also produced.

===Sequel===

An official sequel film to the original film, &quot;Death Race 2050&quot;, was produced by Roger Corman and released in early 2017.

<text>Békéscsaba (; ; see also other alternative names) is a city with county rights in southeast Hungary, the capital of Békés County.

== Geography ==
Békéscsaba is located in the Great Hungarian Plain, southeast from Budapest. Highway 44, 47, Békéscsaba beltway (around the city) and Budapest-Szolnok-Békéscsaba-Lőkösháza high speed () railway line also cross the city. Highway 44 is a four-lane expressway between Békéscsaba and Gyula. According to the 2011 census, the city has a total area of .

== Name ==
&quot;Csaba&quot; is a popular Hungarian given name for boys of Turkic origin, while the prefix &quot;Békés&quot; refers to the county named Békés, which means peaceful in Hungarian. Other names derived from the Hungarian one include , , and .

== History ==
The area has been inhabited since the ancient times. In the Iron Age the area had been conquered by the Scythians, by the Celts, then by the Huns. After the Hungarian Conquest, there were many small villages in the area.

The medieval Hungarian village of &quot;Csaba&quot; was established in the 13th century, first mentioned in the 1330s. Besides Csaba, eight other villages stood where now the town stands. According to the Hungarian Royal Treasury, Békéscsaba was an ethnic Hungarian settlement in 1495. When the Turks conquered the southern and central parts of Hungary, and these territories became part of the Ottoman Empire, the town survived, but it became extinct during the fights against the Turks in the 17th century.

In 1715, Csaba is mentioned as a deserted place, but only one year later its name can be found in a document mentioning the tax-paying towns. It is likely that the new Csaba was founded by János György Harruckern, who earned distinction in the liberation fights against the Ottoman Empire and bought the area of Békés county. In 1718, Harruckern invited Slovak settlers from Upper Hungary to the deserted area. By 1847, the town was among the twenty largest towns of Hungary, with a population of 22,000. Nevertheless, Csaba was still like a large village, with muddy streets and crowded houses.

By 1858, the railway line reached the town. This brought development; new houses and factories were built, and the town began to prosper. Still, by the end of the 19th century the unemployment caused increasing tension, and in 1891 a revolt was suppressed by the help of Romanian soldiers. One of the most important people in the politics of the town was András L. Áchim, who founded a peasants&#x27; party, and succeeded in elevating Békéscsaba to the rank of &quot;city with council&quot;.

World War I brought suffering to the town. Between 1919 and 1920, Békéscsaba was under Romanian occupation. After the Treaty of Trianon, Hungary lost its most important southern cities, Arad and Nagyvárad (Oradea, both of them today in Romania), and Békéscsaba had to take over their roles, becoming the most important town of the region. Hungarians overtook Slovaks in the 1920s, become the majority ethnic group according to the census held in 1930.

Between the two world wars, a flood in 1925 and the collapse of the global economy four years later, increased poverty and unemployment.

Battles were not fought in the area during World War II. However, several events occurred in the town in 1944: between 24 and 26 June 1944, over 3,000 Jews were sent to Auschwitz.

On 21 September 1944, the British and American Air Force bombed the railway station and its surroundings, killing more than 100 people. On 6 October 1944, the Soviet army occupied Békéscsaba.

During the Socialist times, Békéscsaba became the county seat of Békés (1950) and began to develop into one of the most important centres of food industry of Hungary. After the fall of the Communism in 1989, the industry nearly collapsed and many people lost their jobs. However, today the crisis seems to be over and Békéscsaba remained one of the most important centers of the Hungarian food industry.

<text>Joseph Henri Richard (February 29, 1936 – March 6, 2020) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player who played centre with the Montreal Canadiens in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1955 to 1975. He was nicknamed &quot;Pocket Rocket&quot; after his older brother, Canadiens&#x27; legend and fellow Hockey Hall of Famer Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard. Henri played his entire professional career with the Canadiens and won the Stanley Cup 11 times as a player, the most in NHL history. Richard and Bill Russell of the National Basketball Association are tied for the record of the most championships won by an athlete in a North American sports league. In 2017, Richard was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

==Early life==
Henri Richard was born on February 29, 1936, in Montreal, the seventh of eight children of Alice (Laramée) and Onésime Richard. His father worked as a machinist for the Canadian Pacific Railway, specifically at the Angus Yards. His older brother Maurice Richard played hockey for the Montreal Canadiens beginning in 1942, when Henri was six years old. Maurice Richard quickly became a superstar player for the Canadiens, earning the nickname Rocket Richard, and Henri Richard wished to emulate his brother and go into hockey. Henri joined the junior Montreal Canadiens as a 15 year old, and led the Quebec junior in scoring for two consecutive seasons before being promoted to the NHL.

==Playing career==
Henri Richard began his professional career playing on the same team as his older, more famous brother; and comparisons between himself and his brother were easy to make. He was nicknamed &quot;Pocket Rocket&quot; while still a junior in reference to his brother&#x27;s nickname &quot;Rocket Richard,&quot; as well as the fact that Henri Richard was shorter than his brother.
The two Richard brothers&#x27; style of play was quite different. Maurice Richard was famous for driving at the net with brute force; however, Henri Richard preferred tactical playmaking and outthinking the opponent. Maurice shot left; Henri shot right. Maurice was a prodigious goal-scorer, the first to score 50 goals in 50 games, and led the league in goals on five occasions. Henri led the league in assists twice, in 1957–58 and in 1962–63. Maurice was strong; Henri was fast. However, they had one thing in common: both were willing to be physical on the ice.

Initially, Montreal Canadiens coach Toe Blake kept the two Richard brothers apart on the ice, fearing that his star Maurice Richard would give up goalscoring opportunities to his younger brother. However, one game against Chicago a couple of injuries forced Blake to play the Richard brothers together, and Henri assisted Maurice on a goal in the third period, and from then on he played the brothers together on a line with hall-of-famer Dickie Moore. Initially, Maurice would watch out for his brother, and go after anyone who pushed his younger brother around; but after Henri won a fight while Maurice was stuck in the penalty box, Maurice realized that his brother could take care of himself, and stopped looking out for him. Toe Blake later said that playing with Henri forced Maurice to become a better player, and helped prolong Maurice&#x27;s career. Later in 1958, when Maurice Richard was injured, Toe Blake moved Marcel Bonin to the line to take Maurice&#x27;s place, and Henri Richard&#x27;s line continued to produce goals, showing the world that Maurice Richard was not simply carrying his little brother.

The Canadiens won the Stanley Cup in each of Henri Richard&#x27;s first five seasons, the longest championship streak in NHL history. Maurice Richard retired after the last of these titles in 1960, however even before then Henri Richard was recognized as a star in his own right. In 1957–58, he was named to the first All-Star team and in 1959 he was named to the second All-Star team; he was also named to the second All-Star team in 1961 and 1963. He scored the Stanley Cup-clinching goal at the 2:20 mark of the first overtime of game six in the 1966 Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings, when a pass bounced off of Henri Richard&#x27;s body into the net while Detroit&#x27;s goalie Roger Crozier was still sprawled out on the ice. In the 1971 Stanley Cup Finals, Richard scored the game-tying and Stanley Cup-winning goals in Game Seven against the Chicago Black Hawks. 

The 1971 Stanley Cup finals were a particularly controversial moment for Richard, as he was benched in Game 5 by head coach Al MacNeil on May 13, 1971. After the game, in front of reporters in the Canadiens&#x27; dressing room, Richard went on to call MacNeil &quot;the worst coach I have ever played for. ... He is incompetent.&quot; His comments resulted in MacNeil getting death threats and requiring police protection for him and his family during the rest of the series. Despite winning the Stanley Cup, MacNeil did not have much choice except to resign as the Canadiens coach on June 10, 1971, and was replaced by Scotty Bowman. MacNeil became the general manager and head coach of their top farm team, the American Hockey League&#x27;s Nova Scotia Voyageurs. Another surprise, captain Jean Beliveau retired on June 9, 1971. With the captaincy now open, Richard was then elected as the team captain in mid-September 1971. By 1974, MacNeil and Richard reconciled.

==Retirement and legacy==
Not liking the spotlight, Richard reluctantly consented to a tribute night in his honour, hosted by the Canadiens organization, before a game at the Montreal Forum on January 26, 1974. However, he insisted that the over $111,000 in donations collected for the event, be contributed towards the construction of a gymnasium for St. Arsene Orphanage on &quot;rue Critophe-Colomb&quot;. His brother, Maurice, made his first appearance at the Forum in almost a decade, after a feud with the Canadiens organization, and received a warm welcome from the fans. The whole 30-minute red carpet ceremony was broadcast live, coast to coast, on CBC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; program, as part of the Canadiens versus the Chicago Black Hawks game.

Henri Richard served as captain of the Canadiens from 1971 until his retirement on July 14, 1975. He was the ninth player to reach 1,000 career points, with 358 goals and 688 assists in 1,256 games. His 1,256 regular-season games played in a Canadiens uniform are a franchise record. Henri won the Stanley Cup 11 times as a player, the most in NHL history. Only one other athlete in North American professional sports has achieved winning eleven championships in his respective league—Bill Russell of the NBA&#x27;s Boston Celtics. Henri also scored two Stanley Cup-winning goals, one of five players to have done so.

A few months after he announced his retirement, the Canadiens retired his jersey, number 16, at a pre-game ceremony on December 10, 1975. As well, the team also honoured the person that wore it before him, his former Junior A coach, Elmer Lach. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1979. In 1998, he was ranked number 29 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players. He later served as an ambassador for the Canadiens&#x27; organization. In 2017, as part of the NHL&#x27;s centennial celebrations, the league compiled a list of the 100 greatest players during the past century, with Richard on it.

==Private life and death==
Richard met his wife, the former Lise Villeard, when they were only six-years-old. They were skating buddies and as he told The Gazette in a feature interview before his 1974 tribute night, &quot;We&#x27;d be on the rink for an hour and a half or two hours and I&#x27;d never say anything. She&#x27;d do the talking, I&#x27;d do the listening.&quot; They were married for 63 years, until his death. They had five kids: Michèle, Gilles, Denis, Marie-France and Nathalie – as well as 10 grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

Since he was seven, he dreamed of owning a tavern. In the early 1960s he opened one, Henri Richard&#x27;s, on Park Avenue. It became a &quot;brasserie&quot;–an upscale bar and restaurant compared to a tavern–in 1973. When he wanted to retire from running the business, he hoped to pass it on to one of his children, but none of them wanted to operate it, so he sold it in 1986. 

In 2015, it was announced that Richard had been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He died on March 6, 2020, at the age of 84 due to complications of the disease, in Laval, Quebec. Richard&#x27;s son Denis revealed that he had been posthumously diagnosed with stage 3 chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

<doc id="1017658" wikidata="Q187812" url="?curid=1017658" title="Dunaújváros">
<text>Dunaújváros (; also known by alternative names) is an industrial city in Fejér County, Central Hungary. It is a city with county rights. Situated 70 kilometres (43 miles) south of Budapest on the Danube, the city is best known for its steelworks, which is the largest in the country. It was built in the 1950s on the site of the former village of Dunapentele and was originally named Sztálinváros, before acquiring its current name in 1961.

==Geography==

Dunaújváros is located in the Transdanubian part of the Great Hungarian Plain (called Mezőföld), south of Budapest on the Danube, Highway 6, Motorways M6, M8 and the electrified Budapest-Pusztaszabolcs-Dunaújváros-Paks railway.

==Etymology and names==
The city replaced the village of &quot;Dunapentele&quot; (&quot;Pantaleon up on the Danube&quot;), named after Saint Pantaleon. The construction of this new industrial city started in 1949 and the original village was renamed &quot;Sztálinváros&quot; (&quot;Stalin City&quot;) in 1951. After the Hungarian revolution of 1956 the new government renamed the city the neutral &quot;Dunaújváros&quot; in 1961, which means &quot;Danube New City&quot; (New City on the Danube).

The city is also known by alternative names in other languages: ; ; and .

==History==
Dunaújváros is one of the newest cities in the country. It was built in the 1950s during the industrialization of the country under Socialist rule, as a new city next to an already existing village, &quot;Dunapentele&quot;.

===Dunapentele===
Dunapentele was not built on until the 1950s. The construction started on the Danube&#x27;s right bank.
The area has been inhabited since ancient times. When Western Hungary was a Roman province under the name &quot;Pannonia&quot;, a military camp and a town called &quot;Intercisa&quot; stood in this place, at the border of the province. The Hungarians conquered the area in the early 10th century. The village of &quot;Pentele&quot;, named after the medieval Greek saint, Pantaleon, was founded shortly after.

Between 1541 and 1688 the village was under Ottoman rule, and during the 150-year war it was completely destroyed. During the freedom fight led by Prince Ferenc II Rákóczi of Transylvania, the place was deserted again. In the 18th century the village began to prosper. In 1830 the village was given the right to hold markets days twice a week. In 1831 there was a cholera epidemic and which caused a small scale peasants revolt. In 1833 Pentele was granted town status &quot;(oppidum)&quot; by Ferdinand V. The citizens took part in the freedom fight in 1848–49.

After the Second World War the new, Communist government started a major industrialisation programme, in support of its rearmament efforts. In 1949 &quot;Dunaújváros&quot; was chosen as the site of the largest iron and steel works in the country. The focus on steel production had the purpose of arming the socialist territories in fear of a third world war. With a strong steel industry they could quickly stock up on weaponry and machinery. Originally they were to be built close to Mohács, but the Hungarian-Yugoslavian relations worsened, and this new site was chosen, farther away from the Yugoslav border. The city was designed to have 25,000 residents.

The construction of the city began on May 2, 1950, near Dunapentele. Within one year more than 1,000 housing units were built and construction on the factory complex began. The city officially took the name of Joseph Stalin on April 4, 1952; its name was &quot;Sztálinváros&quot; &#x27;Stalin City&#x27; as a parallel to Stalingrad in the USSR.

The metal works (formerly called: Dunai Vasmű, now ISD DUNAFERR) were opened in 1954. The city had a population of 27,772 at this time; 85% of them lived in nice, comfortable apartments, while about 4,200 people still lived in uncomfortable barracks which originally provided &quot;homes&quot; for the construction workers.

In the middle of the 1950s, public transport was organized, with buses carrying 24,000 passengers each day. During the 1950s many cultural and sports facilities were built, the Endre Ságvári Primary School being the largest school in Central Europe in the 1960s. The official and obligatory architectural style and art movement of the communist system was socialist realism. Per definition the style&#x27;s meaning was communist, its form was national, and its preferred mode of representation was the allegory. There are several public statues and reliefs in the town, which represent the allegoric union of workers, peasants and intellectuals, surrounded by traditional folk motifs. Thanks to the inspiration of Bauhaus the buildings and monuments of this era (1949–56), like the forge, the cinema, the theatre, the hospital and the city&#x27;s schools where characterized by a structural functionalism, but the ideological function resulted in classicist decorations, like columns, tympanums and arcades, because of which the informal name of the style became &#x27;Stalin&#x27;s Baroque&#x27;

In 1956, the construction was hindered by an earthquake and a flood, and in October by the start of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. During the revolution the city used its historical name &quot;Dunapentele&quot; again. The &quot;Rákóczi&quot; radio station, which was created by the revolutionaries, broadcast from Dunapentele (in fact from a bus that was constantly moving around in the city so that it couldn&#x27;t be located.) Even though the citizens of Dunapentele tried to defend their city, the Soviet army occupied the city on November 7, 1956. The city came under martial law and Soviet tanks were stationed throughout the city.

After the revolution the city was still the &quot;trademark city&quot; of socialism in Hungary, and was presented as such to foreign visitors. Among the visitors were Yuri Gagarin and the Indonesian president Sukarno. The city also provided a scenic backdrop to popular movies.

In 1960, the ten-year-old city already had 31,000 residents who celebrated its anniversary.

On November 26, 1961, the city&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Dunaújváros&quot; (Duna|új|város meaning &quot;Danube-new-city&quot;; &quot;New City upon Danube&quot;. See also Tiszaújváros) as a consequence of Stalin&#x27;s death (1953) and the Hungarian Revolution (1956).

In 1990 it became a city with county rights—as one of the then four, (now five) cities in the country that have this status but are not county capitals—in accordance with a new law that granted this status to all cities with a population over 50,000. Even though the population of Dunaújváros has been under 50,000 since 2008, it has kept its status as a city with county rights (along with Hódmezővásárhely, which is in a similar situation).

The ISD DUNAFERR (formerly: Dunai Vasmű) factory complex is still is an important enterprise in the Hungarian steel industry, and a major employer (as of 2020, it has 4,500 employees) in the area.
Today, Dunaújváros is home to many new infrastructures (Pentele Bridge, direct M6-M8 highway link between Budapest and Dunaújváros), the new South Korean Hankook factory, Europe&#x27;s biggest tire factory of Hankook, and Hamburger Hungaria, one of the largest containerboard manufacturers in Europe. This and other projects make Dunaújváros a new Hungarian boomtown.

Thanks to its formal political and economic importance, the communist urban design, the socialist realist architecture and its unique atmosphere the town is the considerable memento of communism. Many of the half-century-old buildings have received the protection of historic monuments, and the town is in the focus of growing touristic interest.

==Demographics==
In 2001 Dunaújváros had 55,309 residents (92.5% Hungarian, 0.6% Romani, 0.6% German, 6.3% other). Religions: 38.9% Roman Catholic, 8.3% Calvinist, 2% Lutheran, 37.8% Atheist, 0.2% other, 12.8% no answer.

==Politics==
The current mayor of Dunaújváros is Pintér Tamás (Jobbik).

The local Municipal Assembly, elected at the 2019 local government elections, is made up of 15 members (1 Mayor, 10 Individual constituencies MEPs and 4 Compensation List MEPs) divided into this political parties and alliances:

==Sport==
The most popular sport is ice hockey, and the city is home to the Steel Bulls (which plays at the Ice Hockey Stadium of Dunaújváros). The second most popular sport in the town is football. The town has one team playing in the top-level league, the Nemzeti Bajnokság I, the Dunaújváros PASE. However the most well-known team is the defunct Dunaújváros FC which also won the 1999–2000 Nemzeti Bajnokság I season. The women&#x27;s water polo team of Dunaújvárosi FVE won the 2018 edition of the LEN Trophy.

<text>Chaim Mordechaj Rumkowski (February 27, 1877 – August 28, 1944) was the head of the Jewish Council of Elders in the Łódź Ghetto appointed by Nazi Germany during the German occupation of Poland.

Rumkowski accrued much power by transforming the ghetto into an industrial base manufacturing war supplies for the in the mistaken belief that productivity was the key to Jewish survival beyond the Holocaust. The Germans liquidated the ghetto in 1944. All remaining prisoners were sent to death camps in the wake of military defeats on the Eastern Front.

As the head of the , Rumkowski is remembered for his speech &quot;Give Me Your Children&quot;, delivered at a time when the Germans demanded his compliance with the deportation of 20,000 children to Chełmno extermination camp. In August 1944, Rumkowski and his family joined the last transport to Auschwitz, and he was murdered there on August 28, 1944, by Jewish inmates who beat him to death as revenge for his role in the Holocaust. This account of his final moments is confirmed by witness testimonies of the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials.

== Background ==

Chaim Rumkowski was born on February 27, 1877, to Jewish parents in Ilyino, a shtetl in Vitebsk Governorate, Russian Empire. In 1892, Rumkowski moved to Congress Poland. He became a Polish citizen after the establishment of the Second Polish Republic in 1918. Rumkowski became an activist of the Zionist movement and was involved in the Łódź Zionist Committee.

Before the German invasion of Poland, Rumkowski was an insurance agent in Łódź, a member of Qahal, and the head of a Jewish orphanage at 15 Krajowa Street between 1925 and 1939. According to Dr Edward Reicher, a Holocaust survivor from Łódź, Rumkowski had an unhealthy interest in children. Łódź was annexed by the invading Germans into Nazi Germany and became part of the territory of new , separate from the established in most of the German-occupied Poland. Smaller Jewish communities were dissolved and forcibly relocated to metropolitan ghettos. The occupation authority ordered the creation of the new Jewish Councils known as the which acted as bridges between the Nazis and the prisoner population of the ghettos. In addition to managing basic services such as communal kitchens, infirmaries, post offices and vocational schools, common tasks of the included providing the Nazi regime with slave labor, and rounding up quotas of Jews for &quot;resettlement in the East,&quot; a euphemism for deportations to extermination camps in the deadliest phase of the Holocaust.

On October 13, 1939, the Nazi in Łódź appointed Rumkowski the (&#x27;Chief Elder of the Jews&#x27;), head of the (&#x27;Council of Elders&#x27;). In this position, Rumkowski reported directly to the Nazi ghetto administration, headed by Hans Biebow. When the rabbinate was dissolved, Rumkowski performed weddings. The ghetto&#x27;s money or scrip, the so-called &quot;Rumki&quot; (sometimes &quot;Chaimki&quot;), was derived from his name, as it had been his idea. His face was put on the ghetto postage stamps and currency, which led to his sarcastic nickname &quot;King Chaim&quot;.

By industrializing the Łódź Ghetto, he hoped to make the community indispensable to the Germans and save the people of Łódź. On April 5, 1940, Rumkowski petitioned the Germans for materials for the Jews in exchange for desperately needed food and money. By the end of the month, the Germans had acquiesced, in part, agreeing to provide food, but not money. Although Rumkowski and other &quot;Jewish elders&quot; of the Nazi era came to be regarded as collaborators and traitors, historians have reassessed this judgment since the late 20th century in light of the terrible conditions of the time. A survivor of the Łódź ghetto, Arnold Mostowicz, noted in his memoir that Rumkowski gave a percentage of his people a chance to survive two years longer than the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto, destroyed in the Uprising. However, as noted by Lucjan Dobroszycki, the ultimate decision on the future was not his to make.

=== Ghetto history prior to the &quot;Final Solution&quot; ===
The ghettoization of Łódź was decided on September 8, 1939, by an order of Friedrich Uebelhoer. His top secret document stated that the ghetto was only a temporary solution to &quot;the Jewish question&quot; in the city of Łódź. Uebelhoer never implied the long-term survival of its inhabitants. The ghetto was sealed on April 30, 1940, with 164,000 people inside. On October 16, 1939, Rumkowski selected 31 public figures to form the council. However, less than three weeks later, on November 11, twenty of them were executed and the rest disappeared, because he denounced them to the German authorities &quot;for refusing to rubber-stamp his policies&quot;. Although a new was officially appointed a few weeks later, the men were not as distinguished, and remained far less effective than its original leaders. This change conceded more power to Rumkowski, and left no one to contest or restrain his decisions. Rumkowski had the Jewish Ghetto Police under his control also.

The Germans authorized Rumkowski as the &quot;sole figure of authority in managing and organizing internal life in the ghetto&quot;. Rumkowski gained power by his domineering personality as much as by his words and deeds. Biebow from the first gave Rumkowski full power in organizing the ghetto, as long as it did not interfere with his main objectives: absolute order, confiscation of Jewish property and assets, coerced labor, and Biebow&#x27;s own personal gain. Their relationship seemed to work effectively. Rumkowski had leeway to organize the ghetto according to his own lights, while Biebow sat back and reaped the rewards. In trying to keep Biebow happy, Rumkowski obeyed every order with little question, and provided him with gifts and personal favors. Rumkowski is said to have boasted of his willingness to cooperate with the German authorities: &quot;My motto is to be always at least ten minutes ahead of every German demand.&quot; He believed that by staying ahead of the Germans&#x27; thinking, he could keep them satisfied and preserve the Jews. Łódź was the last ghetto in Central Europe to be liquidated. However, only 877 inhabitants survived in the city until liberation, by hiding with Polish rescuers, and it is claimed that Rumkowski had nothing to do with it.

=== Administration ===

Because of the confiscation of cash and other belongings, Rumkowski proposed a currency to be used specifically in the ghetto – the . This new currency would be used as money, and by this alone, a person could buy food rations and other necessities. This proposal was considered arrogant and illustrated Rumkowski&#x27;s lust for power. The currency was, therefore, nicknamed by ghetto inhabitants as the &quot;Rumkin&quot;. It dissuaded smugglers from endangering their lives to get in and out of the ghetto with goods, as people could not pay for them with regular currency. Rumkowski believed that smuggling of food would &quot;destabilize the ghetto with regard to the prices of basic commodities&quot; and prevented it from taking place.

Rumkowski did not allow public protests expressing dissent. With the help of the Jewish Ghetto Police, he violently broke up demonstrations. On occasion, he would request the Nazis to come and break up the commotion, which usually resulted in protesters being killed. The leaders of these groups were punished by not being allowed to earn a living, which in effect meant that they and their families were doomed to starvation. Sometimes the strikers and demonstrators were arrested, imprisoned, or shipped off to labor camps. By the spring of 1941, almost all opposition to Rumkowski had dissipated. In the beginning, the Germans were unclear of their own plans for the ghetto, as arrangements for the &quot;Final Solution&quot; were still being developed. They realized that the original plan of liquidating the ghetto by October 1940 could not take place, so they began to take Rumkowski&#x27;s labor agenda seriously. Forced labor became a staple of ghetto life, with Rumkowski running the effort. &quot;In another three years – he said – the ghetto will be working like a clock.&quot; This sort of &quot;optimism&quot; however, was met with a damning assessment by Max Horn from , who said that the ghetto was badly managed, not profitable, and had the wrong products.

== Deportations ==
In January 1942, some 10,000 Jews were sent aboard Holocaust trains to Chełmno based on selections made by the . An additional 34,000 victims were sent to Chelmno by 2 April, with 11,000 more in May, and over 15,000 in September 1942, for a total of 71,000 for 1942 as a whole. The children and the elderly as well as anyone deemed &quot;unfit for work&quot; in the eyes of the would follow them.&lt;ref name=&quot;jewishgen/timeline&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumkowski actively cooperated with German demands, hoping to save the majority of the ghetto inmates. Such behaviour set him at odds with the Orthodox observant Jews, because there could be no justification for delivering anyone to certain death. Following the creation of the extermination camp at Chełmno in 1941, the Nazis ordered Rumkowski to organize several waves of deportations. Rumkowski claimed that he tried to convince the Germans to reduce the number of Jews required for deportation and failed.

=== &quot;Give Me Your Children&quot; ===

On German orders Rumkowski delivered a speech on September 4, 1942, pleading with the Jews in the ghetto to give up children 10 years of age and younger, as well as the elderly over 65, so that others might survive. &quot;Horrible, terrifying wailing among the assembled crowd&quot; could be heard, reads the transcriber&#x27;s note to his parlance often referred to as: &quot;Give Me Your Children&quot;. Some commentators see this speech as exemplifying aspects of the Holocaust.

== Personality ==

Rumkowski was ruthless, using his position as head of the to confiscate property and businesses that were still being run by their rightful Jewish owners in the ghetto. He established numerous departments and institutions that dealt with all of the ghetto&#x27;s internal affairs, from housing tens of thousands of people, to distributing food rations. Welfare and health systems were also set up. For a time, his administration maintained seven hospitals, seven pharmacies, and five clinics employing hundreds of doctors and nurses. Despite their effort, many people could not be helped due to the shortage of medical supplies allowed in by the Germans.

Rumkowski helped maintain school facilities. 47 schools remained in operation schooling 63% of school-age children. There was no education in any other ghetto as advanced as in Łódź. He helped set up a &quot;Culture House&quot; where cultural gatherings including plays, orchestra and other performances could take place. He was very involved in the particulars of these events, including hiring and firing performers and editing the content of the shows. He became integrated in religious life. This integration deeply bothered the religious public. For example, since the Germans disbanded the rabbinate in September 1942, Rumkowski began conducting wedding ceremonies, and altering the marriage contract (). &quot;He treated the ghetto Jews like personal belongings. He spoke to them arrogantly and rudely and sometime beat them&quot;.

Due to Rumkowski&#x27;s harsh treatment, and stern, arrogant personality, the Jews began to blame him for their predicament, and unleashed their frustration on him instead of the Germans, who were beyond their reach. The most significant display of this frustration and resistance was a series of strikes and demonstrations between August 1940 and spring of 1941. Led by activists and leftist parties against Rumkowski, the workers abandoned their stations and went to the streets handing out fliers:

== Death at the hands of the ==
There are conflicting accounts regarding Rumkowski&#x27;s final moments. According to one contemporary source he was murdered upon his arrival at Auschwitz by the Jews of Łódź who preceded him there. This version of events, however, has been challenged by historians. Another report, submitted by a member from Hungary, , states that the Jews of Łódź approached the Jews in secrecy, and asked them to kill Rumkowski for the crimes he committed in the Łódź Ghetto, so they beat him to death at the gate of the Crematorium No. 2 and disposed of his corpse.

== Debate over Rumkowski&#x27;s role in the Holocaust ==
In his memoirs, Yehuda Leib Gerst described Rumkowski as a complex person: &quot;This man had sickly leanings that clashed. Toward his fellow Jews, he was an incomparable tyrant who behaved just like a Führer and cast deathly terror to anyone who dared to oppose his lowly ways. Toward the perpetrators, however, he was as tender as a lamb and there was no limit to his base submission to all their demands, even if their purpose was to wipe us out totally. Either way, he did not properly understand his situation and position and their limits.&quot;

Historian Michal Unger, in her &quot;Reassessment of the Image of Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski&quot; (2004) explored the materials leading to his reputation. Rumkowski is described &quot;on the one hand, an aggressive, domineering person, thirsty for honor and power, raucous, vulgar and ignorant, impatient (and) intolerant, impulsive and lustful. On the other hand, he is portrayed as a man of exceptional organizational prowess, quick, very energetic, and true to tasks that he set for himself.&quot; Research performed by Isaiah Trunk for the book attempted to revise the prevailing view of Rumkowski as traitor and collaborationist.

Rumkowski took an active role in the deportations of Jews. Some historians and writers describe him as a traitor and as a Nazi collaborator; Rumkowski aimed at fulfilling the Nazi demands with the help of their own Orpo Security Police if necessary. His rule, unlike the leaders of other ghettos, was marked with abuse of his own people coupled with physical liquidation of political opponents. He and his council had a comfortable food ration and their own special shops. He was known to get rid of those he personally disliked by sending them to the camps. Additionally, he sexually abused vulnerable girls under his charge. Failure to submit to him meant death to the girl. Holocaust survivor Lucille Eichengreen, who claimed to have been abused by him for months as a young woman working in his office, said, &quot;I felt disgusted and I felt angry, I ah, but if I would have run away he would have had me deported, I mean that was very clear.&quot;

Primo Levi, an Auschwitz survivor, in his book &quot;The Drowned and the Saved&quot;, concludes: &quot;Had he survived his own tragedy...no tribunal would have absolved him, nor, certainly, can we absolve him on the moral plane. But there are extenuating circumstances: an infernal order such as National Socialism exercises a frightful power of corruption against which it is difficult to guard oneself. To resist it requires a truly solid moral armature, and the one available to Chaim Rumkowski...was fragile.&quot; At best, Levi viewed Rumkowski as morally ambiguous and self deluded. Hannah Arendt, in her book &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot;, placed Rumkowski&#x27;s egotism at the low end of the spectrum of wartime ghetto leadership examples.

Professor Yehuda Bauer points out that if the Russians had continued their summer offensive in 1944, Lodz would have been the only ghetto to be liberated with a significant number of its inhabitants still alive, and Rumkowski might be remembered in a very different light.

<doc id="1017661" wikidata="Q4126577" url="?curid=1017661" title="Transfer Pak">
<text>The Transfer Pak is an accessory for the Nintendo 64 controller. When plugged into the controller&#x27;s expansion port, it allows for the transfer of data between supported Nintendo 64 (N64) games and Game Boy or Game Boy Color (GBC) games inserted into its cartridge slot. By using the Transfer Pak, players can unlock additional content in compatible games; the &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; games, with which the Transfer Pak was initially bundled for sale, also feature the ability to emulate specific Game Boy &quot;Pokémon&quot; titles for play on the N64.

Roughly 20 N64 games were released with Transfer Pak support between 1998 and 2001, only six of which supported it outside of Japan. Several games which initially planned to utilize the accessory were either cancelled or had the functionality removed. As a result, while recognized as one of the first examples of connectivity between Nintendo&#x27;s home consoles and handhelds, the Transfer Pak has come to be retrospectively regarded as largely unnecessary by members of the gaming press.

==History==
The Transfer Pak was developed by Nintendo Research &amp; Development 3, and was first revealed at Nintendo&#x27;s Space World 1997 trade show. It was released in Japan as a pack-in with the game &quot;Pocket Monsters Stadium&quot; (1998), which required the Transfer Pak for many of its features. In North America and Europe, the Transfer Pak was similarly bundled with &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; (1999) for its English language release in 2000, receiving a standalone release shortly thereafter. While the device itself is compatible with all Game Boy and Game Boy Color Game Paks, Nintendo 64 games can only connect to Game Boy games from the same region.

Unlike the Super Game Boy peripheral, which allowed Game Boy games to be played on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the Transfer Pak&#x27;s primary use was not to play Game Boy games on the Nintendo 64. Nintendo and Intelligent Systems developed a separate accessory to serve this function, the Wide-Boy64, but it was not released to the public and was instead only available to game developers and members of the gaming press. However, the &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; games included a built-in Game Boy emulator, allowing users to play compatible &quot;Pokémon&quot; games on the N64 by inserting them into the Transfer Pak. In 2019, an independent software developer created a ROM hack of &quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot; (2000) that expanded the emulator&#x27;s compatibility to include other Game Boy games. In December 2023, as part of its update to add Nintendo 64 support, the Polymega aftermarket console implemented Transfer Pak functionality, allowing players to use the device to dump their Game Boy games and save files to the system&#x27;s memory.

Some games with planned Transfer Pak support went unreleased. One of these was &quot;Cabbage&quot;, a Nintendo 64DD breeding simulator game, which would have featured the Transfer Pak as a major gameplay component. The game was planned to allow players to transfer their pet to the Game Boy and continue to nurture it throughout the day.

Other games were intended to include Transfer Pak features during development, only to remove them prior to release. During development of &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; (1999), the team experimented with transferring photos to the Game Boy Camera so that they could be printed using the Game Boy Printer; however, they found the printer&#x27;s output quality to be insufficient and abandoned the feature. &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; (2000) was originally going to support transferring photos from the Game Boy Camera to create characters with real-life faces, but this function was removed during development, as a result of both technical issues and a wave of anti-violent video game sentiment after the Columbine High School massacre; the final version only uses the Transfer Pak to immediately unlock four of the game&#x27;s cheats via &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; on Game Boy Color. The GBC version of &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; (2000) was initially reported to feature Transfer Pak connectivity with its N64 counterpart, allowing players to strengthen their characters in the N64 game&#x27;s multiplayer mode, but this was dropped before release. &quot;WWF No Mercy&quot; (2000) was meant to use the Transfer Pak to import points earned in its GBC counterpart, which could be spent on rewards in the Nintendo 64 game&#x27;s &quot;SmackDown Mall&quot;. However, this feature was removed following the cancellation of the GBC version.

A similar accessory, the &quot;64 GB Cable&quot;, was designed by Nintendo subsidiary Marigul Management to connect a Game Boy Color to a Nintendo 64 controller port, and would allow data to be transferred from the GBC to a 64DD storage cartridge, as well as for the GBC to be used as a &quot;sub-screen&quot; for certain 64DD games. This was demonstrated at Space World 1999 with the 64DD game &quot;DT Bloodmasters&quot;, a trading card game that would allow for the GBC to function as a second screen using the 64 GB Cable. The cable and &quot;DT Bloodmasters&quot; were ultimately never released, though its GBC counterpart, &quot;DT: Lords of Genomes&quot;, was released in May 2001. &quot;Derby Stallion 64&quot; (2001) was also intended to support the 64 GB Cable, using the GBC as a second screen to place private bets on horse races, but this feature was removed after the accessory&#x27;s cancellation.

==Games==
The Transfer Pak was initially bundled with the Japanese-exclusive &quot;Pocket Monsters Stadium&quot; (1998), which allows players to connect to all first generation &quot;Pokémon&quot; games for Game Boy (&quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and &quot;Yellow&quot;). Once connected, players can view and organize their Pokémon, transfer them from the Game Boy games to &quot;Stadium&quot; for storage and use in battle, or emulate the Game Boy games for play on their television; players can unlock the ability to double or triple the speed of the emulation. Players can also teach a transferred Pikachu the &quot;Surf&quot; ability in &quot;Stadium&quot;, which can be used to unlock a secret minigame in &quot;Yellow&quot;. These features were all retained in its sequel, released internationally as &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; (1999), which also allows players to unlock special prize Pokémon to send to the Game Boy game. The third entry in the series, &quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot; (2000), adds support for the second generation of Game Boy &quot;Pokémon&quot; games (&quot;Gold&quot;, &quot;Silver&quot;, and &quot;Crystal&quot;). In addition to the Pokémon transfer and emulation functions from the previous games, &quot;Stadium 2&quot; allows players to transfer items, use transferred Pokémon in its minigames, view and customize the player character&#x27;s room from the second generation games in 3D, and receive special items in the second generation games using the “Mystery Gift” option. The Japanese version of &quot;Stadium 2&quot; could also connect to &quot;Crystal&quot; to watch or play against prerecorded battle data downloaded from the &quot;Mobile System GB&quot; networking service prior to its shutdown in 2002.

Both &quot;Mario&quot; sports games released for the N64, &quot;Mario Golf&quot; (1999) and &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; (2000), feature the ability to transfer the player characters from the corresponding GBC games to the N64, allowing them to gain experience points through gameplay that will be transferred back to the GBC versions. The GBC version of &quot;Mario Golf&quot; also allows players to view their high scores from the N64 game. When the two versions of &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; are connected, Yoshi, Wario, Waluigi and Bowser are unlocked as playable characters in the GBC game, along with their respective mini-games. Connecting both versions again after achieving a high score in these minigames will unlock up to six additional tennis courts in the N64 game. The four secret characters and minigames are unlocked by default for the GBC game’s 2024 re-release via Nintendo Switch Online.

Two N64 games developed by Rare only featured Transfer Pak functionality in their western releases, due to their respective GBC companion games not releasing in Japan. In &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; (2000), connecting to its GBC counterpart immediately unlocks a selection of cheats on N64, which would otherwise require the player to complete several difficult in-game objectives. Connecting &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Speedway USA&quot; (2000) to its GBC counterpart is the only way to unlock Huey as a playable character in the English N64 release.

All other games to feature Transfer Pak support were only available in the Japanese market. Examples include &quot;Choro Q 64 2: Hachamecha Grand Prix Race&quot; (1999), which increases the player&#x27;s maximum speed when connected to &quot;Choro Q Hyper Customizable GB&quot; (1999); &quot;Puyo Puyo~n Party&quot; (1999), which allows players to view a gallery of special illustrations earned in &quot;Pocket Puyo Puyo Sun&quot; (1998), some of which can only be unlocked by connecting the two games; and the &quot;Mario Artist&quot; programs &quot;Paint Studio&quot; (1999) and &quot;Talent Studio&quot; (2000) for the 64DD add-on, both of which allow players to take photographs using the Game Boy Camera accessory and import them for use in the games’ creation suites.

Some N64 games feature the ability to unlock or transfer characters that would normally only be accessible in the corresponding Game Boy game. The fishing game &quot;Nushi Tsuri 64&quot; (1998) and its sequel &quot;Nushi Tsuri 64: Shiokaze Ninotte&quot; (2000) can connect to &quot;Umi no Nushi Tsuri 2&quot; (1998) and &quot;Kawa no Nushi Tsuri 4&quot; (1999) respectively, allowing players to transfer data from their in-game notebooks on GBC to N64; sea fish that are normally only present in &quot;Umi no Nushi Tsuri 2&quot; can also be added to the fishing pond in &quot;Nushi Tsuri 64&quot;. &quot;Super Robot Taisen 64&quot; (1999) and &quot;Super Robot Taisen: Link Battler&quot; (1999) can connect to unlock playable units in each game that are otherwise exclusive to the other, as well as transfer character experience between games. The baseball games &quot;Jikkyō Powerful Pro Yakyū 6&quot; (1999) and &quot;Jikkyō Powerful Pro Yakyū 2000&quot; (2000) allow in-game players to be transferred from &quot;Power Pro Kun Pocket&quot; (1999) and &quot;Power Pro Kun Pocket 2&quot; (2000) respectively, though this can also be done without a Transfer Pak through the use of a password. Other examples include transferring items from &quot;Super B-Daman: Fighting Phoenix&quot; (1997) to &quot;Super B-Daman: Battle Phoenix 64&quot; (1998); and exchanging and battling Robopon characters between &quot;Robot Ponkottsu Sun&quot;, &quot;Star&quot;, and &quot;Moon&quot; (1998) and &quot;Robot Ponkottsu 64: Nanatsu no Umi no Caramel&quot; (1999).

A few N64 games feature Transfer Pak compatibility with the full Game Boy library and will grant different bonuses based on which Game Boy game is connected, similar to the use of CDs in &quot;Monster Rancher&quot;. For example, &quot;PD Ultraman Battle Collection 64&quot; (1999) will unlock different characters for play based on which Game Boy game is inserted. &quot;Robot Ponkottsu 64&quot; uses the connected game to generate special food items that provide different stat boosts. In &quot;&quot; (1999), the player’s default health and rate of energy depletion can be positively or negatively affected based on the connected game, with &quot;Kettō Transformers Beast Wars: Beast Senshi Saikyō Ketteisen&quot; (1999) granting the greatest possible boost as well as unlocking the secret character Megatron X.

==Reception==
Reviews of the &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; games praised their use of the Transfer Pak, with some claiming that players who played the games without using it would find their appeal and features severely limited. Similarly, Peer Schneider of &quot;IGN&quot; considered the Transfer Pak functionality in &quot;PD Ultraman Battle Collection 64&quot; to be the game&#x27;s sole redeeming feature. When reviewing the Virtual Console releases of &quot;Mario Golf&quot; and &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;, Lucas M. Thomas of &quot;IGN&quot; was disappointed by the removal of Transfer Pak functionality from the rereleases, lamenting their incompleteness due to the inability to unlock their Transfer Pak-exclusive content. Some members of the press identified the Transfer Pak as an influence on later examples of connectivity between Nintendo&#x27;s home consoles and handhelds, most prominently the GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable.

However, in the years following the Nintendo 64&#x27;s discontinuation, the Transfer Pak has been regarded as a largely underutilized and unnecessary add-on. In a retrospective for &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;, Gavin Lane stated that the Transfer Pak, while interesting, never truly reached its full potential. Brett Elston of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; claimed that many players misinterpreted the Transfer Pak as a device meant to play Game Boy games on the television, leading to disappointment. Elston also described most games&#x27; Transfer Pak integration as &quot;an afterthought, with features that were barely worth the hassle of digging it out of the closet.&quot; &quot;Den of Geek&quot;″s Daniel Kurland considered the Transfer Pak to be &quot;a frivolity rather than something fundamental&quot;, particularly given the meager number of games that supported it. Writing for &quot;GamesBeat&quot;, André Bardin was also critical of the Transfer Pak&#x27;s lack of support, particularly outside of Japan.

<doc id="1017662" wikidata="Q4708760" url="?curid=1017662" title="Alastair Morton">
<text>Sir Robert Alastair Newton Morton (11 January 1938 – 1 September 2004) was Chief Executive of Eurotunnel and Chairman of the Strategic Rail Authority, industrialist and the last chairman of the British Railways Board.

==Early life==
Morton was born 11 January 1938 in Johannesburg, South Africa. The son of a Scottish oil engineer father and an Afrikaner mother. Morton was educated at St John&#x27;s College, Johannesburg, and Witwatersrand University, but came to Britain to read law at Worcester College, Oxford, as a De Beers scholar and remained in England for the rest of his life, although he did spend some time back in Africa and also with the World Bank in Washington. He was managing director of the British National Oil Corporation 1976–80; as the managing director, he fought to resist privatisation. He was chief executive of Guinness Peat Group 1982–87 and chairman in 1987. In 1993 he chaired the United Kingdom Treasury&#x27;s private finance panel, which sought private capital for transport projects.

==Eurotunnel==
He was appointed co-chairman of Eurotunnel in 1987, a position he would hold until 1996. The project cost more than twice its projected £4.8 billion price tag. The Conservative Government of Margaret Thatcher had insisted that the project had to pay its own way, and the UK legislation which authorised and facilitated the project contained an outright ban on any British public subsidy for the works. In 1990 he became the group chief executive 1990–94.

==Strategic Rail Authority==
In 1999, the British deputy prime minister John Prescott MP appointed Morton to the chairmanship of the British Railways Board and, once created from February 2001, the Strategic Rail Authority, from which he resigned in October 2001 in the aftermath of the collapse of Railtrack. Morton famously coined the phrase that the aftermath of the Hatfield rail crash constituted a &#x27;collective nervous breakdown&#x27; on the part of the British railway industry.

The Authority had been created for ambiguous political reasons, with considerable political and public expectations vested in it but without nearly the power to meet them. Relations with the Department for Transport, the Treasury and the Rail Regulator - which collectively did have the powers which Morton wanted - deteriorated quite quickly.

Towards the end of his time at the SRA, Morton was making public statements which were more and more critical of his political masters and what he saw as their intransigence in allowing him both the power and the freedom he believed he should have had. In relation to powers to hold Railtrack - the national railway infrastructure company - to account, Morton&#x27;s jurisdictional skirmishes with the Rail Regulator became public after the Ladbroke Grove rail crash and Morton would never accept that the Rail Regulator and not the SRA had the right to determine what Railtrack&#x27;s financial framework and settlement should be.

He summed up his objections in what became his second most memorable railway phrase - &#x27;He who pays the piper should call the tune&#x27; - by which he meant that the SRA should set the overall level of public spending on the railways, and what was to be delivered with the cash, and the Rail Regulator should simply check that the money was efficiently used. That never happened during his tenure at the SRA, although it became reality in 2005 with the passage of the Railways Act 2005 which curtailed the power of the Office of Rail Regulation (which replaced the Rail Regulator in July 2004) in financial matters. Morton resigned in October 2001.

==Private life==
In 1990, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Laws) from the University of Bath. Morton was knighted in 1992.

==Later life==
He was chairman of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain 1994–2004. He died on 1 September 2004 aged 66.

<text>Hurst is a village in the civil parish of St Nicholas Hurst in the Borough of Wokingham, Berkshire, England. The village lies between Twyford and Wokingham, about north of the M4 motorway.

==Geography==
The parish of St Nicholas Hurst is about north of Wokingham and south of Twyford in the county of Berkshire. It covers about and is the largest civil parish in the Borough of Wokingham. The village is on the A321 Twyford – Wokingham road. There are a number of other smaller areas of sporadic development, the main ones being along Davis Street on the B3030 Twyford – Winnersh road, along the B3034 Forest Road, from Bill Hill to Binfield and on Broadcommon Road.

The River Loddon flows north along the western side of the parish and a substantial proportion of the parish lies within the alluvial flood plain of this river and its tributaries. The most important exceptions to this are Church Hill just to the west of the village centre, and Ashridge to the south-east. The M4 motorway crosses the southern half of the parish but does not have any direct access within the parish. The A329(M) forms the south-west boundary, separating Hurst from Wokingham and Winnersh. The main London to Bristol railway line runs along the northern boundary, and Twyford station in the neighbouring parish of Twyford serves Hurst. Dinton Pastures Country Park is a country park within Hurst.
==Notable buildings==
===Parish church=== 
The Church of England parish church is dedicated to St Nicholas. The Grade I listed building is partly Norman and partly later medieval. The tower is of brick and was built in 1612. It contains eight bells, the largest six of which were cast in the 17th century; the two lightest bells were added in 1911. The church was restored in the 19th century by W. Fellows Prynne. There are many monuments of the 17th and 18th centuries, and much 17th-century woodwork. Burial monuments include those of Lady Margaret Savile (d. 1631), widow of Sir Henry Savile, Provost of Eton College.

===Country houses===
Bill Hill, on the Twyford Road, is an Early Georgian house which was probably built by Sir Montague Blundell just after 1720. It was later the home of the Leveson-Gower family. Work on the house was done by Henry Flitcroft in c. 1735–6 and Matthew Brettingham in 1746. 

Haineshill (Haines Hill House), on the B3018 east of Hurst, is a substantial Grade II* listed house built in c. 1630–1635 for Sir Francis Windebank and extended by James Edward Colleton in 1760. The house was later owned by Thomas Colleton Garth, who founded the Garth Hunt, first meeting there in 1852.

Hinton House, on Hinton Road, also Grade II* listed, was built c. 1600–1620 in red brick for William Hide. It was most recently part of the Dolphin School. The house incorporates an innovative &#x27;triple pile&#x27; plan, where the hall and parlour are placed next to each other, with the service rooms to the rear, and separated by a corridor containing the staircase. This layout was a &quot;radical departure from conventional domestic planning&quot;, anticipating later architectural developments. Land around the house was anciently a liberty known as Broad Hinton, and was a detached part of Wiltshire until the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844 transferred the liberty to Berkshire.

Hurst House, northwest of the church, was built in 1847 for Archibald Cameron, vicar of Hurst, and incorporates an older house built in 1530 by Richard Warde, who was sub-Treasurer of Henry VIII and later a member of Parliament for Berkshire and Windsor.

Hurst Lodge, on Broadcommon Road, is a Grade II* listed 17th-century house built for the Barker family, and later the property of the Countess of Buchan. Barkers almshouses on Church Hill were erected and founded in 1664 by William Barker of Hurst Lodge.

Stanlake Park, just northwest of Hinton House, is a large gabled brick house that was probably built by Richard Aldworth, a grocer from London, beginning in c. 1610.

==Local government==
St Nicholas Hurst is a civil parish with an elected parish council. It falls within the area of the unitary authority of Wokingham Borough. Both the parish council and the unitary authority are responsible for different aspects of local government.

==Education==
St Nicholas&#x27; Church of England Primary School is a voluntary controlled primary school in the village which educates children aged 5–11. The school was built in 1843. The primary school shares a breakfast club with St. Nicholas Pre-school playgroup, a registered charity and member of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, which is open to all students and children of the playgroup. Dolphin School is a coeducational, independent preparatory day school and nursery school for children between the ages of 3 and 13.

<text>Andrei Antonovich Grechko (; ; – 26 April 1976) was a Soviet military commander and Marshal of the Soviet Union during the Cold War. He served as the Soviet minister of defence from 1967 to 1976.

Born to a Ukrainian peasant family near Rostov-on-Don, Grechko served in the Red Army cavalry during the Russian Civil War. After graduating from the Frunze Military Academy, he took part in the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939. Grechko was a fresh graduate of the Voroshilov Military Academy when Axis forces invaded the Soviet Union. He held a succession of cavalry and army commands afterwards and saw action in the Caucasus, Ukraine and Central Europe.

After the war, Grechko commanded the Kiev Military District. In 1953, he was appointed commander-in-chief of Soviet Forces in East Germany, and led the suppression of the East German uprising. In 1955, he was named a Marshal of the Soviet Union. In 1957, he became commander-in-chief of the Soviet Ground Forces, and three years later he also became the commander of the Warsaw Pact forces. In 1967, Grechko was appointed Minister of Defence, and oversaw the subsequent Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and violent border clashes with China. He helped modernize the Soviet Army and was responsible for continuing the Soviet hegemony over Eastern Europe. An ideological hardliner, he was a defender of the first strike nuclear strategy, and only reluctantly supported Leonid Brezhnev&#x27;s détente with the United States and the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT). Grechko died in 1976 at the age of 72.

==Early life==
Grechko was the thirteenth child born to a family of Ukrainian peasants on 17 October 1903, at a small town near Rostov-on-Don.

==Early military career==

He joined the Red Army in 1919, where he was a part of the 1st Cavalry Army. During the war, he fought in the Caucasian Front and Southern Front, where fought in battles against the White Army troops of Generals 
Anton Denikin and Pyotr Wrangel, and detachments of Ataman Nestor Makhno, and the elimination of political and criminal banditry.

From September 1921 to July 1922, he served in a separate battalion of OSNAZ in Taganrog. He studied at the Crimean Cavalry courses Named After the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, in which he graduated in August 1923. After graduation, he was sent to study at the Taganrog Cavalry School of the North Caucasian Military District and in August 1924, he was transferred to the North Caucasian Mountain Nationalities Cavalry School in Krasnodar. During his studies, he was a foreman of a squadron and from 1925 to 1926, he participated in military operations against gang formations in Chechnya and Dagestan. He graduated in 1926 and became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

From September 1926 to April 1932, he served in the 61st Cavalry Regiment of the 1st Separate Cavalry Brigade at the Moscow Military District, and platoon and machine-gun squadron commander.

Grechko graduated from the Military Academy of the Red Army named after M. V. Frunze in 1936. After graduation, he served in the Special Red Banner Cavalry Division named after I.V. Stalin of the Moscow Military District and later transferred to the Belarusian Special Military District, where he served as assistant chief and chief of the 1st (operational) part of the division headquarters and commander of the 62nd Cavalry Regiment. From May 1938 to October 1938, he served as assistant chief of staff of the division.

He graduated from the academy of the General Staff of the Red Army named after K. E. Voroshilov in June 1941.

== World War II ==

In October 1938, he was appointed as chief of staff of the 62nd Cavalry Regiment. While serving in this position, he participated in the Soviet invasion of Poland.

In the early days of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Grechko served in the Operational Directorate of the General Staff of the Red Army. Grechko&#x27;s first command during World War II was of the 34th Cavalry Division, which put up a valiant fight around Kremenchug near Kiev in Ukraine during the First Battle of Kiev. The division was assigned to the 26th, 38th and 6th Armies on the Southwestern Front.

On 15 January 1942, Grechko was put in command of the 5th Cavalry Corps and took part in the Barvenkovo–Lozovaya offensive. From March 1942, he was appointed as commander of the operational group of troops in the Southern Front, which operated in the Donbas. Starting 15 April 1942, Grechko was placed in command of 12th Army and took part in the defense of Voroshilovgrad and from July, took part in the Battle of the Caucasus. In September 1942, Grechko commanded the 47th Army and at the same time acting as commander of the Novorossiysk Defensive Region. He commanded the 47th Army in the Transcaucasian Front from 19 October 1942 and took part in the Tuapse Operation.

From 5 January 1943, Grechko was commander of the 56th Army in the Transcaucasian Front, during which he took part in the North Caucasian Strategic Offensive Operation. After fierce battles in January, his unit broke through the heavily fortified enemy defenses and reached the approaches to Krasnodar. From February to March, as part of the North Caucasian Front, he participated in the Krasnodar Offensive, and then in a number of local and mostly unsuccessful offensive operations of the front troops. In September 1943, the troops of the 56th Army, in cooperation with the 9th and the 18th Armies, liberated the Taman Peninsula from the direction of Novorossiysk, during the Novorossiysk-Taman Strategic Offensive Operation.

Grechko served as the deputy commander of the Voronezh Front from 16 October 1943 and on 20 October, he was appointed as deputy commander of the 1st Ukrainian Front. During this time, he fought in the Battle of the Dnieper and Second Battle of Kiev.

Then, on 14 December 1943, he was made the Commanding General of 1st Guards Army, a position he held until the end of the war. The First Guards Army was a part of the 4th Ukrainian Front, which was led by Col.-Gen. Ivan Yefimovich Petrov. Grechko led the 1st Guards in a number of offensive operations, predominantly in Czechoslovakia, Hungary and into Austria.

== Warsaw Pact command ==
After the war, Grechko was the Commanding General of the Kiev Military District, until 1953. Between 1953 and 1957, Grechko was the Commander-in-Chief of Soviet Forces in East Germany. During this time, he commanded the suppression of the East German uprising of 1953.

On 11 March 1955, Grechko and five other high-ranking colleagues, all of whom gained recognition during the Great Patriotic War as either army or front commanders - Moskalenko, Chuikov, Bagramyan, Biryuzov and Yeremenko - were promoted to the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union. From 1957 to 1960, Grechko was the Commander-in-Chief of the Ground Forces. By decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of 1 February 1958, &quot;for the courage and heroism shown in the fight against the Nazi invaders&quot;, Grechko was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union with the Order of Lenin and the Gold Star medal.

From 1960 to 1967, he was the Commander-in-Chief of the Warsaw Pact Forces.

== Minister of Defense ==
On 12 April 1967, Grechko was made the Minister of Defense, taking over shortly after Marshal Rodion Malinovsky died. Grechko served in this capacity until his death in 1976. During the 1970s, Grechko served as the chairman of the editorial commission that produced the official Soviet history of the Second World War.

In January 1968, following the outbreak of the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia, Grechko was the major planner and supporter of the Warsaw Pact invasion of the country, which stopped Alexander Dubček&#x27;s Prague Spring liberalisation reforms and strengthened the authoritarian wing of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ). In March 1969, Chinese and Soviet troops fought in violent border clashes near Damansky Island and Tielieketi. In response to the clashes, Grechko strongly persuaded General Secretary of the Communist Party Leonid Brezhnev to carry out a surgical nuclear strike against China, especially targeting the Lop Nur Nuclear Test Site in the Chinese autonomous region of Xinjiang. Due to the resistance of the party factions headed by Mikhail Suslov and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin, who went to Beijing to meet with the Chinese leaders to reduce tensions between the two countries, a nuclear war was avoided.
In December 1971, during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Grechko helped to provide military support to India during the war. During the Arab-Israeli conflict, Grechko oversaw the providing of Soviet military support to Arab countries against Israel. In the final days of the Yom Kippur War in 1973, Grechko authorized the Soviet advisers operating the Scud missile brigade stationed in Egypt to fulfill Egyptian request to launch a barrage of missiles at Israeli Defense Forces targets at the Israeli bridgehead on the western bank of the Suez Canal on October 22, just moments before the ceasefire. Seven Israeli soldiers were killed in the attack.

By decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of October 16, 1973, &quot;for services to the Motherland in the construction and strengthening of the Armed Forces of the USSR and in connection with the 70th anniversary of his birth&quot;, Grechko was awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union for the second time. 

Grechko was an active member in the Communist Party, and was a member of the Politburo. As Minister of Defense, he helped modernize the Soviet Army and was greatly responsible for maintaining the military strength of the Soviet Union. Grechko was known to give preferential treatment to Ukrainians, and attempted to fill command posts with them whenever possible. He was also responsible for maintaining Soviet military might and hegemony over Eastern Europe. An ideological and strategic hardliner, and a reluctant supporter of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT), his most notable idea was his assumption that a Third World War would always go nuclear at some point, and as such he planned that if World War III did begin, to launch all-out nuclear strikes against the NATO nations the moment that the war began. For Grechko, nuclear weapons would be weapons of first resort in a world war, not weapons of last resort. His views had caused opposition within the military and the political leadership, who wanted the Soviet Union to have a second strike capacity in order to prevent a war with the United States from going nuclear immediately as he preferred. 

In 1976, shortly before his death, he initiated the deployment of the RSD-10 medium-range ballistic missiles, which led to the NATO Double-Track Decision in the early 1980s.

== Personal life and death ==
Grechko was married to Claudia Vladimirovna Grechko (1907-1990), with whom he had a daughter Tatyana Andreevna (1927-2002). Tatyana was married to Soviet and Russian diplomat Yuriy Kirichenko (1936-2017), the son of First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine Aleksey Kirichenko. According to the memoirs of his contemporaries, Grechko was an enthusiastic fan of the sports club CSKA Moscow. Due to his efforts, the club received not only a new stadium, but also an arena, a base in Arkhangelsk and a host of other sports facilities.

Grechko died on 26 April 1976, at the age of 72. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Grechko&#x27;s medical report which was published by the Soviet press agency &quot;TASS&quot; stated that he had suffered for a long time from atherosclerosis and coronary insufficiency. He was honoured with a state funeral and cremated on 30 April. The urn containing his ashes is buried by the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

<text>Barkham is a village and civil parish in the borough of Wokingham in Berkshire, England, located around southwest of the town of Wokingham.

== History ==
Barkham dates back to 951, when a Saxon thane gave &quot;Bloreham&quot; to the monks of Abingdon Abbey. In Saxon times, it passed from the rule of the Abbey, and during the time of King Edward the Confessor, it was owned by a Saxon thane named Ælmer. After the Conquest, it was taken possession of by William the Conqueror.

In 1630 and 1655, the inhabitants petitioned the constable of Windsor Castle against enclosures made by Richard Arrowsmith who, under licence from James I, had built a hunting lodge and formed a deer park at Bear Wood. This would later become Barkham Manor.

John de Barkham held the fee under Henry de Early. He forfeited about 1249, but was restored before 1253, when Jon, the son of Robert de Barkham, levied a fine of lands in Barkham. In 1335, the lands passed to the Bullock family, who held it until the end of the 16th century.

==Geography==
The old part of Barkham is the small settlement by the parish church and is close to Barkham Street. However most of the population lives in the north-east of the parish, around the post office, or in the Arborfield Garrison, which is largely in Barkham. It is a rural parish, mostly consisting of dairy farmland and woods, despite being surrounded by the town of Wokingham and the large villages of Winnersh, Arborfield Cross and Finchampstead.

==Etymology==

The toponym &quot;Barkham&quot; is derived from the Old English &quot;bercheham&quot; meaning &quot;birch home&quot; referring to the birch trees on the edge of Windsor Great Park. The name evolved &quot;via&quot; forms including &quot;Berkham&quot; in the 14th century and &quot;Barcombe&quot; in the 18th century.

== Manor ==
In King Edward III&#x27;s reign the income from Barkham Manor helped to pay for the rebuilding of Windsor Castle and, not long afterwards, timber from Barkham was sent to make the roof of Westminster Abbey.

For many centuries the manor house was a secondary home of the Bullock family. The Bull Inn public house in Barkham is named in reference to their surname. The Bullocks had inherited the manor from the family of William Neville, a 13th-century valet to Saint Thomas Cantilupe, the Bishop of Hereford and Chancellor of England, from whom the manor was originally bought. The manor passed by marriage and inheritance through the Standen, Waterman, Kingsmill and Pitt families. In about 1783, the manor was purchased by the Dowager Countess Gower, the third wife of John Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Gower, and became the property of the Leveson-Gower family. The present manor house is a late 18th-century Georgian building of two wings of differing dates. Barkham had two moated farm-houses. One of these survives, having been divided into two cottages.

==Parish church==
The earliest known record of the Church of England parish church of Saint James dates from 1220. The ancient church was pulled down in 1860 and the present church building was built in 1860–61 or 1862. The ancient church door remains in the garden of Weston House in Wokingham. The new church was designed in a 13th-century Gothic Revival style by the architects J.B. Clacy and Son of Reading. The chancel and transepts were added or rebuilt in 1887. The building retains two features from the earlier church: a late 13th-century wooden memorial effigy of a woman, thought to be that of Mistress Agnes Neville, daughter of a lord of the manor in the 14th century, and the late 18th-century baptismal font. The bell-tower has a ring of four bells cast in 1863 by John Warner and Sons of Cripplegate in the City of London.

A number of members of the Leveson-Gower family are buried in the church, including Lady Mary Tufton, Countess Gower, widow of the first Earl Gower; her son Admiral John Leveson-Gower (d.1792); his son, General John Leveson-Gower and daughter-in-law Isabella Mary Leveson-Gower (née Broke); as well as his grandson, John Leveson-Gower (d.1883), with his wife Charlotte (d.1876), son Sackville (d.1874), and mother-in-law the Right Hon. Lady Harriet Mitchell (d.1855). 

Rev. David Davies (1741–1819) was Rector of Barkham from 1782 until his death in 1819. He studied the condition of the labouring poor, recorded statistics of their wages, cost of food, etc. in various districts of England and Scotland. He published his findings in 1785 in the form of a book called &quot;Cases of Labourers in Husbandry Stated and Considered&quot;. Rev. Peter Ditchfield, FSA (1854–1930) was Rector of Barkham from 1886 until his death. He was a Freemason, historian and prolific author. With William Page he co-edited three Berkshire volumes of the &quot;Victoria County History&quot;, which were published in 1907, 1923 and 1924.

==Social and economic history==
Another prominent farming family, that of Ball, is erroneously said to be that of George Washington&#x27;s mother, Mary Ball Washington. They lived in the parish from the late 15th to the mid-17th century, but William Lee Ball, the man once thought to have emigrated to Virginia and become Mary&#x27;s great grandfather, may have actually died in London and his family lived in the East Berkshire area for at least two more generations. This is still disputed by Americans relatives of Mary Ball. An open field system of farming prevailed in the parish until early in the 19th century. Parliament passed the Windsor Forest Act 1813 (53 Geo. 3. c. 158) authorising enclosure for Barkham, but this was not implemented until 1821.

==Parish Council==
Barkham Parish council meets regularly at the Arborfield Green Community Centre. It has 10 councillors that are elected by the parish residents for a term of four years.

==Residents Association==
Barkham Village Residents’ Association (“BVRA”) was formed in 1987, initially in response to a Planning Application for housing development within the Coombes - a woodland rich in a diversity of wildlife and designated an area of special scientific interest. Planning issues remain an interest of the BVRA. After the threat to the Coombes subsided, the BVRA continues to contribute to Barkham&#x27;s community spirit by running social events and the production of a quarterly newsletter and website.

==Schools==
Bohunt School Wokingham, opened at Arborfield Green in Barkham parish in 2016, is a mixed-sex independent academy.

<doc id="1017692" wikidata="Q3109909" url="?curid=1017692" title="She of Little Faith">
<text>&quot;She of Little Faith&quot; is the sixth episode of the thirteenth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It first aired in the United States on the Fox network on December 16, 2001. In the episode, Bart Simpson and his father Homer accidentally launch a model rocket into the Springfield church, causing the church council to accept funding plans from Mr. Burns for reparation.
Discontent with how commercialized the rebuilt church has become, Lisa abandons Christianity and sets out to follow a new religion, deciding on Buddhism.

The episode was directed by Steven Dean Moore and written by Bill Freiberger, whom executive producer and show runner Al Jean had met while working on the television series &quot;Teen Angel&quot;. The plot idea for the episode was pitched by Jean, who wanted to expand on Lisa&#x27;s personality, even though some of the &quot;Simpsons&quot; writers were concerned over the episode&#x27;s originality. Lisa has remained a Buddhist since this episode. The episode features actor Richard Gere, who agreed to star as long as Buddhism was portrayed accurately, and as long as Lisa would say &quot;Free Tibet&quot;.

The episode was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour) in 2002, which it ultimately lost to the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode, &quot;Roswell That Ends Well&quot;.

Following the thirteenth season&#x27;s release on DVD and Blu-ray, the episode received mostly positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
While watching a 1950s science fiction movie, Bart and Lisa see a commercial for a model rocket kit and Bart orders it by using Homer&#x27;s credit card number. Homer helps Bart and Milhouse build it, but it blows up before launching. Jealous that Ned Flanders built a superior rocket, Homer enlists the help of his former nerdy college roommates, Gary, Doug, and Benjamin, to build a rocket piloted by the hamster Nibbles. The rocket lifts off successfully, but it develops complications and Nibbles bails out. Homer attempts to shoot down the rocket with a 12 gauge shotgun, but the rocket crashes into the church.

The church council meets up to decide how to come up with money to fund the repairs to the church. With no other aid available, they accept help from Mr. Burns and Lindsay Naegle, who wish to run the church as a business. The two rebuild the church as a commercial monstrosity, complete with advertising signs, a currency exchanger, a Lard Lad statue, a photo booth for the churchgoers to put their faces in a cut-out of Jesus from The Last Supper, and a Jumbotron known as &quot;Godcam&quot;. Lisa is appalled at this and after Lovejoy welcomes The Noid to hold a sermon &quot;on the sanctity of deliciousness,&quot; she abandons the church, feeling her religion has lost its soul.

That night, Lisa prays to God and assures him she has not turned her back on Him, but plans to seek a new path to &quot;Him&quot; (or &quot;Her&quot;, she says). While on a walk around town, passing many sacrilegious signs, she finds Springfield&#x27;s Buddhist temple. Inside she sees Lenny and Carl meditating, and Hollywood actor Richard Gere teaches the core concepts of Buddhism to her. An intrigued Lisa takes a pamphlet on Buddhism and studies it at home. It convinces her of the virtues of the faith, and Lisa announces out of her window that she has become a Buddhist. Lisa plants her own bodhi tree in the back yard and begins to meditate, but Marge grows increasingly worried about Lisa&#x27;s soul and tries to convince her to come back to Christianity.

At the church council meeting, Reverend Lovejoy tells Marge to use Christmas to bribe her back. Homer places a tasteless animatronic angel on top of Lisa&#x27;s bodhi tree, and Marge bakes cookies, decorates the home, and has Ralph and Milhouse dress as a pony in wrapping paper to tempt her, but Lisa runs away from her family&#x27;s home when she realizes what is happening. At the Buddhist temple, she tells Gere her family tried to trick her, but Gere informs her that while Buddhism is about one finding inner peace, it is also about respecting the diversity of other religions based on love and compassion. Thus, Lisa is free to celebrate any holiday with her family, including Christmas. Lisa goes back home, falling asleep beside the Christmas tree and tells everyone that she will be celebrating Christmas with them and continue paying lip service to Christianity while practicing Buddhism for the rest of her life. As Marge takes her to the kitchen to get some cookies for her, Lisa asks about her pony, and Marge tries unsuccessfully to change the subject as Lisa calls out for her gift.

==Production and themes==

&quot;She of Little Faith&quot; was directed by Steven Dean Moore and was the only episode Bill Freiberger wrote for &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It was first broadcast on Fox in the United States on December 16, 2001.

Before returning to work full-time on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Jean had worked on a television series called &quot;Teen Angel&quot; together with Mike Reiss and Freiberger. While working on &quot;Teen Angel&quot;, Freiberger suggested that, if Jean was ever to run &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, he should hire Freiberger as a writer on the series. For the thirteenth season, Jean became show runner and assigned Freiberger to write the episode. Freiberger wrote the first draft as a freelance script at his parents&#x27; barn in Pennsylvania, and when he returned to the writing staff to rewrite the story, Freiberger took so many notes that the script became 106 pages long. As a result, Freiberger spent more time editing down the script rather than writing it. The episode&#x27;s main plot, in which Lisa becomes a Buddhist, was pitched by Jean, who wanted to expand Lisa&#x27;s personality. When he pitched the plot idea to the &quot;Simpsons&quot; writing staff, they became concerned about the episode&#x27;s originality. They argued that the series had already explored religious themes in earlier episodes, but Jean assured them that the episode would be about Lisa first-and-foremost, rather than Buddhism. Unlike several other episodes in the series in which a character undergoes a change in their personality, Lisa has remained a Buddhist since this episode, much like her conversion to vegetarianism in &quot;Lisa the Vegetarian&quot;.

Freiberger pitched the subplot involving the model rockets in the beginning of the episode. He based it on a real-life experience, in which he, as a child, accidentally launched a model rocket into a window in his house. A scene from this subplot was removed from the episode following the September 11 attacks. The scene would show a man named Hassan Jay Salam being arrested by policemen (who tells them to call his cousin Casey Kasem), who think the rocket Bart and Homer launched was launched by him (The rocket bears the abbreviation HJS, which stands for Homer J Simpson). After the attacks, the scene was considered too offensive by the Fox censors, so the scene was removed. Originally, the subplot would involve Marge trying to get Homer to build model rockets with Bart. Homer would not want to at first, but after Marge convinces him, he would soon get more into it than Bart. The plot idea was encouraged by some of the writers who thought that Marge had &quot;gotten short shrift,&quot; and, according to Freiberger, Marge would have had a &quot;really big part motivating the story&quot; had the subplot remained intact.

The renovated church in the episode is built like a mall; several stores and merchandising is located inside, and Reverend Lovejoy plugs products and television programs during his sermons. The scene is used to satirize the so-called &quot;megachurches&quot; and the commercialization sometimes associated with these institutions. The episode also argues that, even if Christmas has lost most of its meaning, it is more important to &quot;keep these thoughts to oneself in order to make the family happy.&quot; It also comments on what the writers believe to be the &quot;all or nothing, we&#x27;re right, you&#x27;re all going to hell mentality&quot; of some Christian movements. Even though &quot;She of Little Faith&quot; is a Christmas episode, the holiday is not mentioned until the episode&#x27;s third act. Jean stated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode that the writers did not want to make a conventional Christmas episode, and instead wanted to &quot;slide into&quot; the subject.

The episode features actor Richard Gere as himself. Gere agreed to guest star under three conditions, the first being that Buddhism should be portrayed accurately, the second, that Lisa remain a Buddhist for the rest of the series, and his third and strongest request being that Lisa should say &quot;Free Tibet&quot; in the episode. Jean agreed, but Gere ended up with the line. However, Lisa did yell out &quot;Free Tibet&quot; in an episode in the following season. Gere&#x27;s lines were recorded in New York City by Jean who, in the DVD audio commentary for the episode, stated that Gere was &quot;great&quot; and that he &quot;didn&#x27;t mind being made fun of&quot; in the episode. He also mentioned that Gere was one of the only guest-stars they had that &quot;looked handsome simpsonized.&quot;

==Release==
In 2002, &quot;She of Little Faith&quot; was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour), but it ultimately lost to the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;Roswell That Ends Well&quot;. Matt Groening, creator of both series, joked that the award &quot;gave [him] a chance to be bitter either way&quot;. On August 24, 2010, the episode was released as part of &quot;The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season&quot; DVD and Blu-ray set.

Following its home video release, &quot;She of Little Faith&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics.

Dominic von Reidermann of Suite101.com considered the episode to be a &quot;comedy gem&quot; and Casey Burchby of DVD Talk wrote that it &quot;offers its fair share of laughs&quot;.

Stuart O&#x27; Conner of Screen Jabber was also favorable, calling it a &quot;first-rate&quot; episode.

Writing for Obsessed With Film, Adam Rayner derided Gere&#x27;s performance as being &quot;bland and dreary&quot;, however he went on to write that it couldn&#x27;t ruin the episode, which he described as &quot;great&quot;. He especially liked Flanders&#x27; line &quot;My Satan sense is tingling.&quot;

Jennifer Malkowski, who gave the episode a B−, wrote that the episode&#x27;s &quot;highlight&quot; was a scene in which &quot;Milhouse mourns his &#x27;beautiful eyebrows&#x27;&quot; that were burned off by Bart and Homer&#x27;s model rocket.

In 2007, Simon Crerar of &quot;The Times&quot; listed Gere&#x27;s performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos in the history of the show.

Ron Martin of 411Mania, who consider episodes about Lisa to be &quot;traditional channel changers&quot;, wrote that it &quot;offers one of the worst ‘Lisa episodes’&quot; of the series.

Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide criticized the episode for being &quot;little more than a retread&quot; of earlier episodes of the series. He argued that the episode borrows plot elements from both &quot;Lisa the Vegetarian&quot;, &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Pony&quot; and &quot;Grift of the Magi&quot;, and went on to write that the episode is &quot;a pretty unoriginal piece of work&quot;. He concluded his review by writing that the episode &quot;fails to deliver more than a chuckle or two&quot;.

<text>Arborfield is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Arborfield and Newland, in the Borough of Wokingham in Berkshire, England. It is about south-east of Reading, about west of Wokingham. It lies about west of the village of Arborfield Cross and the two villages have become collectively known as Arborfield, with no signs marking their boundary. In 1931, the parish had a population of 348. On 1 April 1948, the parish was abolished and merged with Newland to form &quot;Arborfield and Newland&quot;.

==Etymology==
The name &#x27;Arborfield&#x27; is first recorded in 1166 as Edburgefeld, meaning &#x27;Edburga&#x27;s Field&#x27;, Edburga being a widespread Anglo-Saxon lady&#x27;s name. It evolved through variations to the modern Arborfield as first recorded in the 17th century.

==Notable buildings==

===Arborfield Hall===

The manor house, which originally stood on the site, was occupied by the Bullock family from the mid-12th century. The last Arborfield Hall, built in 1837, was the home of Sir John Conroy, Controller of the Household of the Duchess of Kent. It was demolished in 1955.

===Churches===
The present Church of England parish church of Saint Bartholomew is a Gothic Revival building designed by J Picton and built in 1863. The new building replaces an older St Bartholomew&#x27;s church, known as the &#x27;Wooden Chapel of Edburgefeld&#x27;, that had been built in the 13th century and altered probably early in the 18th century. When the new church was consecrated the roof of the old one was removed and later layers of plaster stripped from the interior walls, revealing Medieval wall paintings of &quot;figure subjects and geometrical and masonry patterns&quot; that &quot;covered the walls&quot;. These have now been lost and the church ruins have greatly deteriorated. The current church is notable for one of its 6 bells. The number one bell (treble) was cast c.1399 at the Wokingham Bell Foundry, it is notable as being the only Wokingham Foundry bell nearby to Wokingham as well as one of the oldest bells still regularly rung. The army garrison has its own garrison church, a 20th-century building dedicated to Saint Eligius.
==Army garrison==

Arborfield is also known for the School of Electronic &amp; Aeronautical Engineering (SEAE) where the British Army train their Electronic, Aircraft and Avionic engineers for RADAR, Telecommunications, Control Equipment, Aircraft (Airframes and Engines) and Avionic (Aviation electronic and weapon system) modalities. Arborfield Garrison is about the other side of Arborfield Cross and which is mostly in the civil parish of Barkham.

==International Cocoa Quarantine Centre==
Since 1985, Arborfield has also been the home of the International Cocoa Quarantine Centre whose aim is to investigate and reduce diseases in cocoa plants worldwide.

<doc id="1017695" wikidata="Q816459" url="?curid=1017695" title="Ben Carson">
<text>Benjamin Solomon Carson Sr. (born September 18, 1951) is an American retired neurosurgeon, academic, author, and government official who served as the 17th United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from 2017 to 2021. A pioneer in the field of neurosurgery, he was a candidate for President of the United States in the 2016 Republican primaries. Carson is one of the most prominent black conservatives in the United States.

Carson became the director of pediatric neurosurgery at the Johns Hopkins Children&#x27;s Center in 1984 at age 33, then the youngest chief of pediatric neurosurgery in the United States. In 1987, he gained significant fame after leading a team of surgeons in the first-known separation of conjoined twins joined at the back of the head. Although the surgery was a success, the twins continued to experience neurological and medical complications. His additional accomplishments include performing the first successful neurosurgical procedure on a fetus inside the womb, developing new methods to treat brain-stem tumors, and revitalizing hemispherectomy techniques for controlling seizures. He has written over 100 neurosurgical publications. He retired from medicine in 2013; at the time, he was professor of neurosurgery, oncology, plastic surgery, and pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.

Carson gained national fame among political conservatives after delivering a speech at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast that was perceived as critical of the policies of President Barack Obama. Following widespread speculation of a presidential run, Carson officially announced his campaign for the 2016 Republican nomination for President in May 2015. Carson performed strongly in early polls, leading to him being considered a frontrunner for the nomination during the fall of 2015. He withdrew from the race after Super Tuesday, following a string of disappointing primary results, and endorsed Donald Trump. Following his victory, President Trump nominated Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, being confirmed by the United States Senate in a 58–41 vote on March 2, 2017.

Carson has received numerous honors for his neurosurgery work, including over 70 honorary doctorate degrees and numerous national merit citations. In 2001, he was named by CNN and &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the nation&#x27;s 20 foremost physicians and scientists and was selected by the Library of Congress as one of 89 &quot;Living Legends&quot; on its 200th anniversary. In 2008, Carson was bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. In 2010, he was elected into the National Academy of Medicine. He was the subject of the 2009 biographical television film &quot;Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story&quot;, wherein he was portrayed by Cuba Gooding Jr.

== Early life and education ==
Carson&#x27;s parents were Robert Solomon Carson Jr. (1914–1992), a World War II U.S. Army veteran, and Sonya Carson (née Copeland, 1928–2017). Both from large families in rural Georgia, Carson&#x27;s parents met and married while living in rural Tennessee, when his mother was 13 and his father 28. After Robert&#x27;s completion of military service, they moved from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Detroit, Michigan, where they lived in a large house in the Indian Village neighborhood. Carson&#x27;s father, a Baptist minister, worked in a Cadillac automobile plant. His older brother, Curtis, was born in 1949, when his mother was 20. In 1950, Carson&#x27;s parents purchased a new 733-square-foot single-family detached home on Deacon Street in the Boynton neighborhood of southwest Detroit, where Carson was born on September 18, 1951.

Carson&#x27;s Detroit Public Schools education began in 1956 with kindergarten at the Fisher School and continued through first, second, and the first half of third grade, during which time he was an average student. When Carson was five years old, his mother learned that his father had a prior family and had not divorced his first wife. In 1959, when he was eight, his parents separated and he moved with his mother and brother to live for two years with his mother&#x27;s Seventh-day Adventist older sister and brother-in-law in multi-family dwellings in the Dorchester and Roxbury neighborhoods of Boston. In Boston, Carson&#x27;s mother attempted suicide, had several psychiatric hospitalizations for depression, and for the first time began working outside the home, as a domestic worker, while Carson and his brother attended a two-classroom school at the Berea Seventh-day Adventist church where two teachers taught eight grades, and the vast majority of time was spent singing songs and playing games.

In 1961, at the age of 10, Carson moved with his mother and brother back to southwest Detroit, where they lived in a multi-family dwelling in a primarily white neighborhood, Springwells Village, while renting out their house on Deacon Street, which his mother had received in her divorce settlement. When they returned to Detroit public schools, Carson and his brother&#x27;s academic performance initially lagged far behind their new classmates, having, according to Carson, &quot;essentially lost a year of school&quot; by attending the small Seventh-day Adventist parochial school in Boston, but they both improved when their mother limited their time watching television and required them to read and write book reports on two library books per week. Carson attended the predominantly white Higgins Elementary School for fifth and sixth grades and the predominantly white Wilson Junior High School for seventh and the first half of eighth grade. In 1965, at the age of 13, he moved with his mother and brother back to their house on Deacon Street. He attended the predominantly black Hunter Junior High School for the second half of eighth grade. At the age of eight, Carson dreamt of becoming a missionary doctor, but five years later he aspired to the lucrative lifestyles of psychiatrists portrayed on television, and his brother bought him a subscription to &quot;Psychology Today&quot; for his 13th birthday.

=== High school ===
By grade 9, the family&#x27;s financial situation had improved. His mother surprised neighbors by paying cash to buy a new Chrysler car, and the only government assistance they still relied on was food stamps. Carson attended the predominantly black Southwestern High School for grades nine through twelve, graduating third in his class academically. In high school, he played the euphonium in band and participated in forensics (public speaking), chess club, and the U.S. Army Junior Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (JROTC) program where he reached its highest rank—cadet colonel. Carson served as a laboratory assistant in the high school&#x27;s biology, chemistry, and physics school laboratories beginning in grades 10, 11, and 12, respectively, and worked as a biology laboratory assistant at Wayne State University the summer between grades 11 and 12.

In his book &quot;Gifted Hands&quot;, Carson relates that as a youth, he had a violent temper. &quot;As a teenager, I would go after people with rocks, and bricks, and baseball bats, and hammers&quot;, Carson told NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot; in October 2015. He said he once tried to hit his mother on the head with a hammer over a clothing dispute, while in the ninth grade he tried to stab a friend who had changed the radio station. Fortunately, the blade broke in his friend&#x27;s belt buckle. Carson said the intended victim, whose identity he wants to protect, was a classmate, a friend, or a close relative. After this incident, Carson said he began reading the Book of Proverbs and applying verses on anger. As a result, he states he &quot;never had another problem with temper&quot;. In his various books and at campaign events, he repeated these stories and said he once attacked a schoolmate with a combination lock. Nine friends, classmates, and neighbors who grew up with him told CNN in 2015 they did not remember the anger or violence he has described. In response, Carson posted on Facebook a 1997 &quot;Parade&quot; magazine issue, in which his mother verified the stabbing incident. He then questioned the extent of the effort CNN had exerted in the investigation.

Carson has said that he protected white students in a biology lab after a race riot broke out at his high school in response to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; confirmed the riot but could not find anyone who remembered Carson sheltering white students.

=== College ===
Carson&#x27;s SAT college admission test scores ranked him somewhere in the 90th percentile. He wanted to attend college farther away than his brother who was at the University of Michigan. Carson says he narrowed his college choices to Harvard or Yale but could only afford the $10 application fee to apply for only one of them. He said he decided to apply to Yale after seeing a team from Yale defeat a team from Harvard on the &quot;G.E. College Bowl&quot; television show. Carson was accepted by Yale and offered a full scholarship covering tuition, room and board. In 1973, Carson graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology from Yale &quot;with a fairly respectable grade point average although far from the top of the class&quot;.

Carson does not say in his books whether he received a college student deferment during the Vietnam War. He does say that his older brother, then a student at the University of Michigan, received a low number (26) in the first draft lottery in 1969 and was able to enlist in the Navy for four years instead of being drafted, whereas he received a high number (333) in the second draft lottery in 1970. Carson said he would have readily accepted his responsibility to fight had he been drafted, but he &quot;identified strongly with the anti-war protesters and the revolutionaries&quot; and enthusiastically voted for anti-war Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern in 1972. In his book, &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; (2012), Carson said: &quot;The Vietnam War was, in retrospect, not a noble conflict. It brought shame to our nation because of both the outcome and the cause.&quot;

In the summers following his high school graduation until his second year in medical school, Carson worked at a variety of jobs: as a clerk in the payroll office of Ford Motor Company, supervisor of a six-person crew picking up trash along the highway under a federal jobs program for inner-city students, a clerk in the mailroom of Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising, assembling fender parts and inspecting back window louvers on the assembly line at Chrysler, a crane operator at Sennett Steel, and finally a radiology technician taking X-rays. At Yale, Carson had a part-time job on campus as a student police aide.

In his autobiography, Carson said he had been offered a scholarship to West Point. It is likely he means he was offered an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. Cadets receive a free education and room and board in exchange for a commitment to serve in the military for at least five years after graduation. Carson also said the University of Michigan had offered him a scholarship. His staff later said the described scenario was similar to that of West Point, as he never actually applied for entry to the University of Michigan.

In his autobiography, &quot;Gifted Hands&quot;, Carson recounted that exams for a Yale psychology course he took his junior year, &quot;Perceptions 301&quot;, were inexplicably burned, forcing students to retake the exam. Carson said other students walked out in protest when they discovered the retest was significantly harder than the original examination, but that he alone finished the test. On doing so, Carson said he was congratulated by the course instructor, who told him the retest was a hoax intended to find &quot;the most honest student in the class&quot;. Carson said the professor awarded him $10 and that a photographer for the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot; was present to take his picture, which appeared in the student newspaper with a story about the experiment. Doubts were raised about this story in 2015 during Carson&#x27;s presidential campaign. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; attempted to verify Carson&#x27;s account, reporting that Yale undergraduate courses were identified with only two digits in the early 1970s, that Yale had offered no course called &quot;Perceptions 301&quot; at the time, and that Carson&#x27;s photo had never appeared in the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;. Carson, while acknowledging the class number was not correct, said: &quot;You know, when you write a book with a co-writer and you say that there was a class, a lot of [the] time they&#x27;ll put a number or something just to give it more meat. You know, obviously, decades later, I&#x27;m not going to remember the course number.&quot;

=== Medical school ===
Carson entered the University of Michigan Medical School in 1973, and at first he struggled academically, doing so poorly on his first set of comprehensive exams that his faculty adviser recommended he drop out of medical school or take a reduced academic load and take longer to finish. He continued with a regular academic load, and his grades improved to average in his first year of medical school. By his second year of medical school, Carson began to excel academically by seldom attending lectures and instead studying textbooks and lecture notes from 6a.m. to 11p.m. Carson graduated from the University of Michigan Medical School with an M.D. degree in 1977, and he was elected to the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society.

Carson was then accepted by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine neurosurgery program, where he served one year as a surgical intern and five years as a neurosurgery resident, completing the final year as chief resident in 1983. He then spent one year (1983–1984) as a Senior Registrar in neurosurgery at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Nedlands, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia.

== Medical career ==
Upon returning to Johns Hopkins in 1984, Carson was appointed the university&#x27;s director of pediatric neurosurgery. As a surgeon, he specialized in traumatic brain injuries, brain and spinal cord tumors, achondroplasia, neurological and congenital disorders, craniosynostosis, epilepsy, and trigeminal neuralgia. While at Johns Hopkins, Carson figured in the revival of the hemispherectomy, a drastic surgical procedure in which part or all of one hemisphere of the brain is removed to control severe pediatric epilepsy. Encouraged by John M. Freeman, he refined the procedure in the 1980s and performed it many times.

In 1987, Carson was the lead neurosurgeon of a 70-member surgical team that separated conjoined twins Patrick and Benjamin Binder, who had been joined at the back of the head (craniopagus twins). The separation surgery held promise in part because the twin boys had separate brains. The Johns Hopkins Children&#x27;s Center surgical team rehearsed the surgery for weeks, practicing on two dolls secured together by Velcro. Although there were few follow-up stories following the Binder twins&#x27; return to Germany seven months after the operation, both twins were reportedly &quot;far from normal&quot; two years after the procedure, with one in a vegetative state. Neither twin was ever able to talk or care for himself, and both eventually became institutionalized wards of the state. Patrick Binder died sometime between the late 2000s and early 2010s, according to his uncle, who was located by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2015. The Binder surgery served as a model for similar twin separations, with its procedure being refined in subsequent decades. Carson participated in four subsequent high-risk conjoined-twin separations, including a 1997 operation on craniopagus Zambian twins Joseph and Luka Banda, which resulted in a normal neurological outcome. Two sets of twins died, including Iranian twins Ladan and Laleh Bijani. Another separation resulted in the death of one twin and the survival of the other, who is legally blind and struggles to walk.

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the Binder surgery &quot;launched the stardom&quot; of Carson, who &quot;walked out of the operating room that day into a spotlight that has never dimmed&quot;, beginning with a press conference that was covered worldwide and created name recognition leading to publishing deals and a motivational speaking career. On the condition the film would have its premiere in Baltimore, Carson agreed to a cameo appearance as &quot;head surgeon&quot; in the 2003 Farrelly brothers comedy &quot;Stuck on You&quot;, starring Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear as conjoined twins who, unhappy after their surgical separation, continue life attached to each other by Velcro.

In September 1992, Carson appeared in an advertisement opposing Maryland Question 6, a referendum on a bill to codify the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision, in which he said he opposed abortion and would refer patients seeking the procedure to other doctors. He later condemned the advertisement and asked for it to be taken down, saying that he had not known that he was making a political advertisement and did not support making abortion illegal.

In March 2013, Carson announced he would retire as a surgeon, saying he would &quot;much rather quit when I&#x27;m at the top of my game&quot;. His retirement became official on July 1, 2013.

In 2021, Carson joined Galectin Therapeutics to assist with development of the company&#x27;s galectin-3 inhibitor, belapectin, as a treatment for NASH cirrhosis and in combination with immunotherapy for the treatment of cancers.

== Articles, books, business relationships, media posts ==

Carson has written many articles in peer-reviewed journals and six bestselling books published by Zondervan, an international Christian media and publishing company. The first book was an autobiography published in 1992. Two others are about his personal philosophies of success and what he sees as the stabilizing influence of religion.

According to CNN, Carson had an &quot;extensive relationship&quot; from 2004 to 2014 with Mannatech, a multi-level marketing company that produces dietary supplements made from substances such as aloe vera extract and larch-tree bark. Carson gave four paid speeches at company events. He has denied being paid by Mannatech to do anything else, saying he has been a &quot;prolific speaker&quot; who has addressed many groups. In a 2004 speech, he credited the company&#x27;s products with the disappearance of his prostate cancer symptoms. The nature of this relationship became an issue in 2015 during Carson&#x27;s presidential campaign. Carson&#x27;s relationship with Mannatech continued after the company paid $7 million in 2009 to settle a deceptive-marketing lawsuit in Texas over claims that its products could cure autism and cancer. His most recent paid speech for the company was in 2013, for which he was paid $42,000. His image appeared on the corporation&#x27;s website in 2014, and in the same year, he praised their &quot;glyconutrient&quot; supplements in a PBS special that was subsequently featured on the site.

Carson delivered the keynote address at a Mannatech distributor convention in 2011, during which he said the company had donated funds to help him obtain a coveted endowed-chair post at Johns Hopkins Medicine: &quot;three years ago I had an endowed chair bestowed upon me and uh, it requires $2.5 million to do an endowed chair, and I&#x27;m proud to say that part of that $2.5 million came from Mannatech.&quot; In October 2015, Carson&#x27;s campaign team said that &quot;there was no contribution from Mannatech to Johns Hopkins&quot; and that his statement had been &quot;a legitimate mistake on his part. Confusion. He had been doing some fundraising for the hospital and some other chairs about that time, and he simply got things mixed up.&quot;

During the CNBC GOP debate on October 28, 2015, Carson was asked about his relationship with Mannatech. He replied, &quot;That&#x27;s easy to answer. I didn&#x27;t have any involvement with Mannatech. Total propaganda. I did a couple speeches for them. I did speeches for other people—they were paid speeches. It is absolutely absurd to say I had any kind of relation with them. Do I take the product? Yes. I think it is a good product.&quot; PolitiFact rated Carson&#x27;s denial of any involvement as &quot;false&quot;, pointing to his paid speeches for Mannatech and his appearances in promotional videos in which he favorably reviewed its products, despite not being &quot;an official spokesman or sales associate&quot;. When the CNBC moderator commented that Carson was on Mannatech&#x27;s website, Carson replied that he had not given his permission. Earlier, he had said he was unaware of the company&#x27;s legal history.

On November 3, 2015, Mannatech said on its website that for compliance with federal campaign finance regulations, the company had removed all references to Carson before he announced his bid for the presidency.

In July 2013, Carson was hired by &quot;The Washington Times&quot; as a weekly opinion columnist. In October 2013, Fox News hired Carson as a contributor to provide analysis and commentary across Fox News Channel&#x27;s daytime and primetime programming, a relationship that lasted until the end of 2014.

In 2014, some House Republicans (who later formed the House Freedom Caucus) approached Carson about the possibility of his standing for Speaker of the House in the event that the incumbent Speaker, John Boehner, had to step down because of intraparty disunion. Carson declined, citing preparations for his 2016 presidential campaign. Ultimately, Boehner resigned in October 2015, and Paul Ryan was elected as the new Speaker.

In financial disclosure forms, Carson and his wife reported income of between $8.9 million and $27 million from January 2014 to May 3, 2015, when he announced his presidential campaign. Over that period, Carson received over $4 million from 141 paid speeches, between $1.1 million and $6 million in book royalties, between $200,000 and $2 million as a contributor to &quot;The Washington Times&quot; and Fox News, and between $2 million and $10 million as a member of the boards of Kellogg Co. and Costco Wholesale Corp. He resigned from Costco&#x27;s board in mid-2015, after serving on it for more than 16 years. Carson was chairman of the Baltimore-based biotechnology company Vaccinogen from August 2014 until the announcement of his US presidential bid in May 2015. Carson had previously served on Vaccinogen&#x27;s Medical Advisory Board.

== 2016 presidential campaign ==

=== Background and increasing political visibility ===
Carson, who had been registered as a Republican, changed his registration to independent in the 1990s after watching Republicans impeach President Clinton for perjury regarding an extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky. &quot;I just saw so much hypocrisy in both parties&quot;, he said. In February 2013, Carson said he was not a member of any political party.

In his book &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; (2013), he wrote: &quot;I believe it is a very good idea for physicians, scientists, engineers, and others trained to make decisions based on facts and empirical data to get involved in the political arena.&quot;

Carson was the keynote speaker at the National Prayer Breakfast on February 7, 2013. The speech garnered Carson considerable attention because the event is normally apolitical in nature, and the speech was critical of the philosophy and policies of President Barack Obama, who was sitting 10 feet away. About the speech, Carson said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think it was particularly political... You know, I&#x27;m a physician.&quot; Regarding the policies of President Obama, he said: &quot;There are a number of policies that I don&#x27;t believe lead to the growth of our nation and don&#x27;t lead to the elevation of our nation. I don&#x27;t want to sit here and say all of his policies are bad. What I would like to see more often in this nation is an open and intelligent conversation.&quot;

Carson&#x27;s sudden popularity among conservatives led to him being invited to the 2013 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) as a speaker. He tied for seventh place in the &quot;Washington Times&quot;/CPAC 2013 Straw Poll with 4% of the 3,000 ballots cast. In the 2014 CPAC straw poll, he was in third place with 9% of the vote, behind senators Ted Cruz of Texas (with 11%) and Rand Paul of Kentucky (31%). In the presidential straw poll at the 2013 Values Voter Summit, he and Rick Santorum polled 13%, with winner Ted Cruz polling 42%, and in 2014 he polled 20% to Cruz&#x27;s winning 25%.

On November 4, 2014, the day of the 2014 midterms, he rejoined the Republican Party, saying it was &quot;truly a pragmatic move&quot; because he was considering running for president in 2016.

In January 2015, &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; reported that the Draft Carson Committee had raised $13 million by the end of 2014, shortly after Carson performed well in a CNN/ORC poll of potential candidates in December 2014, coming second in two different versions. He polled 10% to Mitt Romney&#x27;s 20%, but in the same poll with Romney removed from the list, Carson polled 11% to Jeb Bush&#x27;s 14%. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; mentioned that the Draft Carson Committee had chairmen in all of Iowa&#x27;s 99 counties, and that Carson had recently led two separate Public Policy polls for the state of Pennsylvania.

=== Announcement of campaign ===
On May 2, 2015, Carson proclaimed that in two days he was going to make a major announcement on his decision on whether to enter the presidential race. In an interview with Cincinnati station WKRC-TV on May 3, 2015, Carson accidentally confirmed his candidacy for president. The interview was also broadcast live on WPEC. The next day, May 4, 2015, at the Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts in his home town of Detroit, he officially announced his run for the Republican nomination in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The announcement speech was preceded by a choir singing &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; with Carson sitting in the audience. After the song, Carson took the stage and announced his candidacy alongside a speech on his rags to riches life story, at one point stating: &quot;I remember when our favorite drug dealer was killed.&quot;

=== Surge in polls ===
In October 2015, the Super PAC supporting Carson, The 2016 Committee (formerly the Draft Carson Committee), announced it had received donations in mostly $100 increments from more than 200 small businesses around the country over the course of one week. Fox Business reported that &quot;Carson&#x27;s outsider status is growing his small business support base.&quot; Ben Walters, a fundraiser for The 2016 Committee, expressed optimism about Carson&#x27;s small business support base: &quot;It&#x27;s unbelievable the diversity of businesses that we are bringing on. We are seeing everything from doctors&#x27; offices and folks in the healthcare profession to motorcycle repair shops and bed and breakfasts.&quot;

In October, it was noted that Carson&#x27;s &quot;improbable&quot; political career had surged in polls and fundraising, while he continued to participate in nationally televised Republican debates.

=== Decline in polls ===

The campaign brought considerable attention to Carson&#x27;s past. CBS News described Carson&#x27;s narrative of &quot;overcoming impossible odds as a child growing up in an impoverished, single-parent household to reach international prominence as a pediatric neurosurgeon&quot; as &quot;a key part of his presidential campaign&quot;. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; said the narrative came under &quot;the harsh scrutiny of presidential politics, where rivals and media hunt for embellishments and omissions that can hobble a campaign&quot;. CNN characterized the core narrative as &quot;acts of violence as an angry young man&quot;, followed by a spiritual epiphany that transformed Carson into the &quot;composed figure&quot; he now portrays. Media challenges to a number of Carson&#x27;s statements included allegations of discrepancies between documented facts and certain assertions in his autobiography &quot;Gifted Hands&quot;—allegations dismissed by Carson as a media &quot;witch hunt&quot;. In November 2015, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; republished an article from 1988 &quot;to try to bring some clarity to the claims currently being brought into question&quot;.

In November 2015, Carson&#x27;s campaign aired a 60-second TV advertisement in which excerpts from Carson&#x27;s stump speech were intercut with a rap by an artist named Aspiring Mogul. They spent $150,000 on the ads, which were aired in Atlanta, Detroit and Miami. Carson defended the ad, saying &quot;Well, there are people in the campaign who felt that was a good way to do things... I support them in doing that, but I probably would have taken a little different approach.&quot; Later, he said the advertisement was done without his knowledge, that &quot;it was done by people who have no concept of the black community and what they were doing&quot;, and that he was &quot;horrified&quot; by it.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 2015, &quot;Carson has acknowledged being something of a novice on foreign affairs.&quot; Regarding the war in Donbas, Carson would send arms to Ukraine to aid it in its fight against pro-Russian rebels. He also believes the Baltic states, current NATO members, should &quot;get involved in NATO&quot;.

In a November 2015 Republican debate, Carson declared his intentions to make ISIS &quot;look like losers&quot; as he would &quot;destroy their caliphate&quot;. Carson also advocated capturing a &quot;big energy field&quot; outside of Anbar, Iraq, which he said could be accomplished &quot;fairly easily&quot;. Regarding the Middle East, he also claimed that &quot;the Chinese are there&quot;.

Carson said he is not opposed to a Palestinian state, but he questioned why it needs &quot;to be within the confines of Israeli territory ... Is that necessary, or can you sort of slip that area down into Egypt?&quot;

=== Withdrawal from campaign ===
On March 2, following the Super Tuesday 2016 primaries, Carson announced that he did &quot;not see a political path forward&quot; and would not attend the next Republican debate in Detroit. He said, &quot;[T]his grassroots movement on behalf of &#x27;We the People&#x27; will continue&quot;, indicating that he would give more details later in the week. He suspended his campaign on March4 and announced he would be the new national chairman of My Faith Votes, a group that encourages Christians to exercise their civic duty to vote.

In total, Ben Carson&#x27;s campaign spent $58 million. However, most of the money went to political consultants and fundraising rather than advertising. Carson questioned whether his campaign was economically sabotaged from within.

=== Further activities during the 2016 election ===
On March 11, 2016, a week after Carson ended his presidential campaign, he endorsed Trump, calling him part of &quot;the voice of the people to be heard&quot;. Carson&#x27;s subsequent comments that Americans would have to sustain Trump for only four years if he was not a good president drew criticism, and he admitted that he would have preferred another candidate, though he thought Trump had the best chance of winning the general election.
On the other hand, at the press conference Carson said Trump had a &quot;cerebral&quot; side.

On April 25, Carson expressed opposition to Harriet Tubman replacing Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill the day after dubbing the replacement &quot;political expediency&quot;, though he indicated interest in Tubman having another tribute. In late April, Carson wrote to the Nevada Republican Party, requesting the two delegates he won in Nevada be released and free to support whoever they want.

On May 4, after Trump wrapped up the Republican nomination, he hinted that Carson would be among those who would vet his vice-presidential pick. The same day, in an interview Carson expressed interest in Ted Cruz serving as Attorney General of the United States, a position that Carson said would allow Cruz to prosecute Hillary Clinton, and then as a Supreme Court Justice nominee from the Trump administration. On May 6, Carson said in an interview that Trump would consider a Democrat as his running mate, conflicting with Trump&#x27;s assertion that he would not. A Carson spokesperson later said Carson expected Trump to select a Republican.
Carson was said by aide Armstrong Williams in a May 10 interview to have withdrawn from the Trump campaign&#x27;s vetting team, though the campaign confirmed he was still involved. Later that month, Carson revealed a list of potential vice-presidential candidates in an interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. On May 16, Carson said the media could not keep opinion out of reporting and cited Walter Cronkite as a fair journalist who was, in his words, a &quot;left-wing radical&quot;.

During the Republican National Convention, Carson appeared with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani in support of the pro-Donald Trump Great America PAC at an event in Cleveland.

=== Results ===
In total, Carson received 857,039 votes during the Republican primaries; this total represented 2.75% of the votes cast. The only jurisdiction he carried in the primaries was in the Alaska caucuses in which he won a single state house district, but this did not result in any delegates for his campaign from Alaska since the required threshold of votes statewide was not met. He received the support of seven delegates at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Trump received the Republican nomination and went on to be elected president on November 8, 2016.

== Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (2017–2021) ==
=== Nomination and confirmation ===
After Donald Trump&#x27;s win in the 2016 election, Carson joined Trump&#x27;s transition team as vice chairman. Carson was also offered a cabinet position in the administration. He declined, in part because of his lack of experience, with an aide stating, &quot;The last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency.&quot; Although it was reported that the position was for Secretary of Health and Human Services, Carson&#x27;s business manager has disputed this, stating, &quot;Dr. Carson was never offered a specific position, but everything was open to him.&quot; He was eventually offered the position of Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, which he accepted.

On December 5, 2016, President Trump announced that he would nominate Carson to the position of Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. During the confirmation process, Carson was scrutinized by some housing advocates for what they perceived as his lack of relevant experience.

On January 24, 2017, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs voted unanimously to approve the nomination. Senate Democrats attempted to defeat Carson&#x27;s nomination via filibuster, but that vote failed on March 1, 2017, and he was then confirmed by the Senate by a 58–41 vote the next day.

=== Tenure ===
In December 2017, &quot;The Economist&quot; described the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), led by Ben Carson, as &quot;directionless&quot;. Most of the top HUD positions were unfilled and Carson&#x27;s leadership was &quot;inconspicuous and inscrutable&quot;. Of the policies HUD was enacting, &quot;The Economist&quot; wrote, &quot;it is hard not to conclude that the governing principle at HUD is to take whatever the Obama administration was doing, and do the opposite.&quot; HUD scaled back the enforcement of fair housing laws, halted several fair housing investigations started by the Obama administration and removed the words &quot;inclusive&quot; and &quot;free from discrimination&quot; from its mission statement. HUD saw an exodus of career officials during Carson&#x27;s tenure.

On March 6, his first day as secretary, while addressing Housing and Urban Development (HUD) employees, Carson saluted the work ethic of immigrants, and during his comments, he likened slaves to involuntary immigrants. A HUD spokesman said that no one present thought Carson &quot;was equating voluntary immigration with involuntary servitude&quot;. In the same speech, Carson was criticized by some for saying that the human brain &quot;was incapable of forgetting and could be electrically stimulated into perfect recall&quot;.

Under the federal budget proposed by President Trump in 2017, HUD&#x27;s budget for the fiscal year 2018 would be cut by $6.2 billion (13%) and the Community Development Block Grant, a program which Carson praised in a trip to Detroit as HUD secretary, would be eliminated. Carson issued a statement supporting the proposed cuts. Carson suggested that federal funds for housing in Detroit could be part of an expected infrastructure bill.

In April 2017, while speaking in Washington at the National Low Income Housing Coalition conference, Carson said that housing funding would be included in an upcoming infrastructure bill from the Trump administration.

In May 2017, Carson referred to poverty as &quot;a state of mind.&quot;

In July 2017, during his keynote address at the LeadingAge Florida annual convention, Carson stated his concern about &quot;seniors who become destitute&quot; and reported that the Department of Housing and Urban Development had increased public housing programs for the elderly by an unspecified number.
In summer 2017, Carson allowed his son, Baltimore businessman, Ben Carson Jr., to participate in organizing a HUD &quot;listening tour&quot; in Baltimore. Internal documents obtained by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; under the Freedom of Information Act showed that the younger Carson &quot;put people he&#x27;d invited in touch with his father&#x27;s deputies, joined agency staff on official conference calls about the listening tour and copied his wife on related email exchanges&quot;. The son&#x27;s involvement prompted HUD staff to express concern; the department&#x27;s deputy general counsel for operations wrote in a memorandum &quot;that this gave the appearance that the Secretary may be using his position for his son&#x27;s private gain&quot;. Carson&#x27;s wife, son, and daughter-in-law also attended official meetings. In February 2018, the HUD inspector general&#x27;s office confirmed that it was looking into the role Carson&#x27;s family played at the department.

During congressional testimony in May 2019, while being questioned by U.S. Representative Katie Porter, Carson did not know what the term REO (&quot;real estate owned&quot; refers to housing owned by a bank or lending institution post-foreclosure) stood for and confused it with the cookie, Oreo. In response, Carson went on the Fox Business Network where he accused Democrats of adhering to &quot;Saul Alinsky&quot; tactics.

On March 1, 2020, the office of Vice President Mike Pence announced Carson&#x27;s addition to the White House Coronavirus Task Force.

On November 9, 2020, Carson tested positive for COVID-19 after attending President Trump&#x27;s Election Night party. He initially treated himself with a homeopathic oleander extract on the recommendation of Mike Lindell, the founder of My Pillow, Inc., which Carson said caused his symptoms to disappear. Oleander was previously rejected by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for COVID-19 and Carson received criticism for promoting an unscientific homeopathic treatment. He disclosed on November 20 that he subsequently became &quot;extremely sick&quot; and attributed his recovery to Regeneron&#x27;s experimental antibody therapy. He said that President Trump had given him access to the drug.

==== Office furnishing scandal ====
Carson received criticism for spending up to $31,000 on a dining set in his office in late 2017. This expenditure was discovered after Helen Foster, a career HUD official, filed a complaint alleging that she had been demoted from her position because she refused to spend more than the legal $5,000 limit for office redecorations. Carson and his spokesman said that he had little or no involvement in the purchase of the dining set. Later, email communications revealed that Carson and his wife selected the dining set. On March 20, 2018, Carson testified before the United States House Committee on Appropriations that he had &quot;dismissed&quot; himself from the decision to buy the $31,000 dining room set and &quot;left it to my wife, you know, to choose something&quot;. On September 12, 2019, HUD&#x27;s inspector general released a report clearing Carson of misconduct.

==== Remarks on transgender use of homeless shelters ====
Carson was accused by members of the Department of Housing and Urban Development of making transphobic remarks at a meeting in San Francisco in September 2019. He warned that &quot;big, hairy men&quot; might infiltrate homeless shelters for women, prompting one woman to walk out. Reps. Joe Kennedy III of Massachusetts and Jennifer Wexton of Virginia called for his resignation, but Carson said the accusations were a &quot;mischaracterization&quot;. A HUD spokesperson responded that Carson &quot;does not use derogatory language to refer to transgendered individuals. Any reporting to the contrary is false.&quot;

== Carson Scholars Fund ==
In 1994, Carson and his wife started the Carson Scholars Fund which awards scholarships to students in grades 4–11 for &quot;academic excellence and humanitarian qualities&quot;.

Recipients of the Carson Scholars Fund receive a $1,000 scholarship towards their college education. It has awarded 6,700 scholarships. In recognition for his work with the Carson Scholars Fund and other charitable giving throughout his lifetime, Carson was awarded the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership in 2005.

== American Cornerstone Institute ==
In 2021, Carson founded the American Cornerstone Institute, or ACI, a conservative think tank advancing policies that promote &quot;faith, liberty, community, and life.&quot; The ACI&#x27;s mission statement is &quot;dedicated to promoting and preserving individual and religious liberty, helping our country&#x27;s most vulnerable find new hope, and developing methods to decrease the federal government&#x27;s role in society and to improve efficiency to best serve all our nation&#x27;s citizens.&quot; The American Cornerstone Institute is a member of the advisory board of Project 2025.

== Personal life ==
Carson and his wife, fellow Detroit native Lacena &quot;Candy&quot; Rustin, met in 1971 as students at Yale University and married in 1975. They began living in West Friendship, Maryland, in 1988. Together, the couple have three sons, as well as several grandchildren. Their oldest son was born in Perth, Australia.

In 2001, Ben and Candy Carson bought a 48-acre property in Upperco, Maryland.

After being diagnosed with prostate cancer, Carson underwent a two-hour operation at the Johns Hopkins Hospital on August 7, 2002.

In 2013, Carson, his wife, and Carson&#x27;s mother moved to West Palm Beach, Florida.

Surrounding his confirmation as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Carson bought a $1.22 million home in Vienna, Virginia, in February 2017 and sold his West Palm Beach home for over $900,000 in May 2017, after buying a $4.4 million home in nearby Palm Beach Gardens. He sold his home in Virginia in 2020.

=== Religion ===
Carson and his wife are members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church (SDA). Carson was baptized at Burns Seventh-day Adventist Church in Detroit. A few years later, he told the pastor at a church he was attending in Inkster, Michigan, that he had not fully understood his first baptism and wanted to be baptized again. He has served as a local elder and Sabbath School teacher in the Seventh-day Adventist Church and is a member of Spencerville Seventh-day Adventist Church. Although Carson is an Adventist, the church has officially cautioned church employees to remain politically neutral.

In keeping with his Seventh-day Adventist faith, Carson announced in 2014 his belief &quot;that the United States will play a big role&quot; in the coming apocalypse. He went on to say, &quot;I hope by that time I&#x27;m not around anymore.&quot;

Carson has stated that he does not believe in hell as understood by some Christians: &quot;You know, I see God as a very loving individual. And why would he torment somebody forever who only had a life of 60 or 70 or 80 years? Even if they were evil. Even if they were only evil for 80 years?&quot; This is fully in line with Adventist teaching, which promotes annihilationism.

Carson endorsed Seventh-day Adventist theology, which includes belief in a literal reading of the first chapters of Genesis. In a 2013 interview with &quot;Adventist News Network&quot;, Carson said: &quot;You know, I&#x27;m proud of the fact that I believe what God has said, and I&#x27;ve said many times that I&#x27;ll defend it before anyone. If they want to criticize the fact that I believe in a literal, six-day creation, let&#x27;s have at it because I will poke all kinds of holes in what they believe.&quot; Carson&#x27;s Adventism was raised as an issue by his then-primary rival Donald Trump. Some Adventists have argued that Carson&#x27;s political positions on gun rights and religious liberty conflict with historic Adventist teachings in favor of nonviolence, pacifism, and the separation of church and state.

In 1998, Carson was invited to give the commencement address at the prominent Andrews University, the flagship institution of the Seventh Day Adventist school system. During his speech, Carson voiced sympathies for the long discredited belief that the pyramids of Giza were built by the biblical figure Joseph to store grain. When questioned about it again in 2015, Carson stood by this assertion.

=== Vegetarianism ===
Consistent with the practice of many Adventists, Carson was a part-time lacto-ovo vegetarian (he ate dishes containing milk, eggs, or cheese, but also occasionally poultry). He has said his main reason for becoming vegetarian was health concerns, including avoiding parasites and heart disease, and he emphasizes the environmental benefits of vegetarianism. His transition was made easier because he had eaten little meat for aesthetic reasons as a child, and he readily adopted his wife&#x27;s vegetarianism because she does much of the cooking in their household. Speaking in 1990, he said that with the increasing availability of meat substitutes, &quot;It might take 20 years. But eventually there will no longer be a reason for most people to eat meat. And animals will breathe a sigh of relief.&quot; To avoid causing others discomfort, he is willing to occasionally eat chicken or turkey, although he finds eating pork highly unpleasant. In August 2015, Carson stated he does &quot;occasionally enjoy a nice steak or a hamburger&quot; and does not &quot;have anything against meat&quot; at a town hall meeting in Iowa.

<doc id="1017701" wikidata="Q389941" url="?curid=1017701" title="Robert Murray M'Cheyne">
<text>Robert Murray M&#x27;Cheyne (21 May 1813 – 25 March 1843) was a minister in the Church of Scotland from 1835 to 1843. He was born at Edinburgh on 21 May 1813, was educated at the university and at the Divinity Hall of his native city, and was assistant at Larbert and Dunipace. A mission of inquiry among the Jews throughout Europe and in Palestine, and a religious revival at his church in Dundee, made him feel that he was being called to evangelistic rather than to pastoral work, but before he could carry out his plans he died, on 25 March 1843. McCheyne, though wielding remarkable influence in his lifetime, was still more powerful afterwards, through his &quot;Memoirs and Remains&quot;, edited by Andrew Bonar, which ran into far over a hundred English editions. Some of his hymns became well known and his Bible reading plan is still in common use.

==Early life and ministry==
Robert Murray M&#x27;Cheyne was born at 14 Dublin Street in Edinburgh on 21 May 1813, the son of Adam McCheyne W.S. (d. 1854), and Lockhart Murray, daughter of David Dickson of Locherwoods, Dumfriesshire. At the age of four he knew the characters of the Greek alphabet, and was able to sing and recite fluently. He entered the high school in his eighth year, and matriculated in November 1827 at University of Edinburgh, where he showed very versatile powers, and distinguished himself especially in poetical exercises, being awarded a special prize by Professor Wilson for a poem on ‘The Covenanters.’ In the winter of 1831 he commenced his studies in the Divinity Hall, under Thomas Chalmers and David Welsh; and he was licensed as a preacher by the Annan presbytery on 1 July 1835.

He first served as an assistant to John Bonar in the parish of Larbert and Dunipace, near Falkirk, from 1835 to 1836. On 24 November 1836 he was ordained to the pastorate of St. Peter&#x27;s Church, Dundee, which had been erected into a quoad sacra parish in the preceding May. The congregation numbered eleven hundred hearers, and M&#x27;Cheyne addressed himself to the work of the ministry with so much ardour that his health again gave way, and in December 1838 he was compelled to desist from all public duty. He went to Edinburgh to rest and recuperate. During his absence his pulpit was supplied by William Chalmers Burns, afterwards the celebrated missionary to China.

==Mission==

In 1839, M&#x27;Cheyne and Bonar, together with two older ministers, Alexander Black and Alexander Keith, were sent to Palestine on a mission of inquiry to the condition of the Jews. Upon their return, their official report for the Board of Mission of the Church of Scotland was published as &quot;Narrative of a Visit to the Holy Land and Mission of Inquiry to the Jews&quot;. This led subsequently to the establishment of missions to the Jews by the Church of Scotland and by the Free Church of Scotland. Islay Burns, brother and biographer of William Chalmers Burns succeeded M&#x27;Cheyne as minister of St. Peter&#x27;s.

==Return to Dundee==
M&#x27;Cheyne was away from 12 April to 6 November 1839. On his return he resumed his work at Dundee with renewed energy. In the autumn of 1842 he visited the north of England on an evangelical mission, and made similar journeys to London and Aberdeenshire. He preached to his own people on 12 March, and two days afterwards was seized with typhus fever, which he had contracted in the course of visitation, and died 25 March 1843.

==Burial==
He died of typhus in Dundee following a short illness on 25 March 1843. His parents agreed to the wish of his congregation that McCheyne be buried in the graveyard beside St Peter&#x27;s Church in Dundee, rather than in the family&#x27;s own burial-ground in Edinburgh. He was buried on Thursday 30 March 1843, with an estimated 7000 people attending the funeral. An imposing monument marks his grave.

==Legacy==
M&#x27;Cheyne was a preacher, a pastor, a poet, and wrote many letters. He was also a man of deep piety and a man of prayer.

M&#x27;Cheyne died exactly two months before the Disruption of 1843. This being so, his name was subsequently held in high honour by all the various branches of Scottish Presbyterianism, though he himself held a strong opinion against the Erastianism which led to the Disruption. Bonar records, &quot;And when, on 7 March of the following year (i.e. 1843), the cause of the Church was finally to be pleaded at the bar of the House of Commons, I find him writing: &#x27;Eventful night this in the British Parliament! Once more King Jesus stands at an earthly tribunal, and they know Him not!&#x27;&quot; —&quot;Memoir&quot; (1892), p. 147).

Although widely believed to have been engaged to be married to Jessie Thain at the time of his death (and once, some ten years earlier, to Margaret Maxwell), largely owing to Smellie&#x27;s popular biography, recent scholarship has disproved both of these claims. Perhaps no minister in the Church of Scotland is better remembered for the saintliness of his character, the anxious devotion which influenced the whole of his short ministry, and the success which everywhere accompanied his efforts as a preacher of the Gospel. He was a diligent Bible student and a good classical scholar. He learned to read Greek when he was but a boy, and he could carry on a conversation in Hebrew. He had fine poetical, artistic, and musical gifts. He trained his congregation in psalmody, and his hymns are the property of all the Churches.

Not long after his death, his friend Andrew Alexander Bonar edited his biography which was published with some of his manuscripts as &quot;The Memoir and Remains of the Rev. Robert Murray M&#x27;Cheyne&quot;. The book went into many editions. It has had a lasting influence on Evangelical Christianity worldwide.

M&#x27;Cheyne designed a widely used system for reading through the Bible in one year. The plan entails reading the New Testament and the Psalms through twice a year, and the Old Testament through once. This program was included (in a slightly modified form) in &quot;For the Love of God&quot; by D. A. Carson and is recommended by several Bible publishers, such as the English Standard Version and the New English Translation.

The former McCheyne Memorial Church in Dundee is named after him.

==Typography==
The proper typography for his surname is with a left single quotation mark, i.e. M‘Cheyne. The use of an ordinary apostrophe is so common, that no attempt is made here to standardise how it is written. Likewise, for the alternative common use of McCheyne.

<text>Aldermaston ( ) is a village and civil parish in Berkshire, England. In the 2011 census, the parish had a population of 1,015. The village is in the Kennet Valley and bounds Hampshire to the south. It is approximately from Newbury, Basingstoke, and Reading and is from London.

Aldermaston may have been inhabited as early as 1690 BCE; a number of postholes and remains of cereal grains have been found in the area. Written history of the village is traced back at least as far as the 9th century CE, when the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicles&quot; showed that the Ealdorman of Berkshire had his country estate in the village. The manor of Aldermaston was established by the early 11th century, when the village was given to the Achard family by Henry I; the manor is documented in the Domesday Book of 1086. St Mary the Virgin Church was established in the 13th century, and some of the original Norman architecture remains in the building&#x27;s structure. The last resident Lord of the Manor, Charles Keyser, died in 1929. Aldermaston Court, the manor estate and house, was requisitioned for armed forces use during the Second World War.

The name &quot;Aldermaston&quot; is well known in connection with the UK&#x27;s nuclear weapons programme, as well as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. The Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), which develops, maintains, and disposes of the UK&#x27;s nuclear weaponry is in the parish. Built on the site of the former RAF Aldermaston, the plant has been the destination of numerous Aldermaston Marches.

== Toponymy ==
The village of Aldermaston derives its name from &quot;Ældremanestone&quot;, &quot;Eldremanestune&quot; or &quot;Hedlremanestone&quot;, the Old English for &quot;Ealdorman&#x27;s Homestead&quot;. The Ealdorman—or Alderman—was a person of extreme importance, equating to the modern-day Lord-Lieutenant of the county. Although his country estate was in Aldermaston, he would have spent most of the time in the original county town of Wallingford. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; states that the first known Ealdorman of Berkshire, Aethelwulf, fought the Danes with Ethelred of Wessex at the nearby Battle of Englefield in 871. Other documented names include &quot;Aldermaston ad Pontem&quot; (11th century), &quot;Aldremanneston&quot; (12th century), &quot;Aldremaneston&quot; (13th century), &quot;Aldermanston&quot; and &quot;Aldermanneston Achard&quot; (14th century), and &quot;Aldmerston&quot; (19th century).

==History==
Evidence suggests that Aldermaston was inhabited in the 12th century CE, possibly extending back to 1690 BCE. Radiocarbon dating on postholes and pits in the area show activity from 1690 to 1390, 1319 to 1214, and 977 to 899 BCE. Wheat and barley grains have been found in these excavations. Tests show that most of the barley was dehulled, but that absence of such debris may mean that the cereal was brought in from other areas.

=== Middle Ages ===
Before the 1066 Norman conquest, the land and properties of Aldermaston formed part of the estates of Harold Godwinson, the Earl of Wessex, who later became King Harold II of England. Harold&#x27;s assessment of Aldermaston valued the village&#x27;s 15 hides at £20 a year. As with much of the land seized by William the Conqueror after his arrival in England in 1066, Aldermaston was held in demesne. His Domesday Book of 1086 identified the existence of a mill, worth twenty shillings, and two fisheries, worth five shillings. During the rest of William&#x27;s reign, and that of his son William Rufus, Aldermaston was owned by the Crown.

The history of the Lords of the Manor of Aldermaston Court can be traced to Achard D&#x27;Aldermaston, who was born in 1036. Six families have had lordship of the Aldermaston estate. In the 11th century, Henry I gave Aldermaston to Robert Achard (or Hachard) of Sparsholt. In the mid-12th century, the Achard family founded the church of St Mary the Virgin. In 1292, Edward I granted the right for the lord of the manor to hold a market in the village. Another charter was granted by Henry IV, with evidence that the market existed until approximately 1900. The Achards also established an annual fair to observe the feast of St. Thomas the Martyr on 7 July.
Aldermaston was held by the Achard family until the 14th century, when it passed through marriage to Thomas of Nunney Castle, Somerset. The family governed Aldermaston for approximately 120 years, until Elizabeth whose male relatives predeceased her—married into the Forster family. In about 1636, the Forsters built a large manor house to the east of the church. The house incorporated parts of an earlier (15th century) house, including the chimney stacks. The Forsters&#x27; house was fronted by two porches, separated by a central section with seven bays. The porches had ornate Solomonic columns, similar to those at the University Church of St Mary the Virgin in Oxford.

The interior of the house featured a number of mythical statues, as well as artwork by Gaspard Dughet, portraits of William Congreve and Godfrey Kneller, and Tintoretto&#x27;s &quot;Esther Before Ahasuerus&quot;. The house&#x27;s Jacobean garden featured patterns of groves and avenues of oak, yew, Spanish chestnut and lime trees. In the early 18th century the Forsters oversaw the building of almshouses in Church Road. Built by R Dixon in 1706, the houses became known as &quot;Dixon&#x27;s Cottages&quot;. The manor passed through the Forster family until 1752, when the Forster lineage ended and the estate was inherited by Ralph Congreve, the husband of the last Forster&#x27;s grand-niece. On Ralph&#x27;s death a second-cousin of dramatist William Congreve inherited the manor. The Congreve Family owned the estate at the time of the 1830 Swing Riots. The rioters marched across Aldermaston, wrecking twenty-three agricultural machines. Workers were so frightened by the riots that they left their machinery in the open in an attempt to limit additional damage.

===Victorian era===
In 1843, the manor house was destroyed by fire, news of which was carried in &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;. The estate passed into the Court of Chancery and was purchased by Daniel Higford Davall Burr. In 1848, Burr commissioned the building of a neoclassical mansion to the south west of the original building. Burr saved the 17th-century manor&#x27;s wooden staircase, though all that remains of the building is a staircase to the cellar (which is now home to a colony of bats). By 1851 the new building was complete, costing £20,000 and having a Tudor-like appearance. Burr held the estate until his death 50 years later, when this was inherited by his son, who sold it in 1893.

The buyer was the wealthy stockbroker Charles Edward Keyser, who was preoccupied with the idea of keeping the village unchanged—or, as he described it, &quot;unspoilt&quot;. He forbade advertisements, opposed all modernisation and refused to allow any expansion by the building of houses. He did, however, commission the building of a parish hall in 1897 and provided the village with a water supply, and the water fountain on the small village green was installed to commemorate Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee. Keyser oversaw the restoration of the village almshouses in 1906 and 1924, and defrayed the cost of a memorial oak tablet in memory of those killed in World War I. Of the 100 men from the village who served in the war, 22 were killed (the highest percentage of town population in the country). The tablet bears the name of each man lost in action.

During Keyser&#x27;s lordship, John Marius Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales&quot; listed &quot;Adminston&quot; as a possible name for the village. On his death in 1929, his wife, Mary, continued to occupy the house until she died in 1938. The estate was auctioned off in September 1938, and many lots were purchased by their occupiers. The manor house was bought by Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) for £16,000. One of the houses in the village is recorded as having fetched £1,375. As AEI&#x27;s chairman, Felix Pole became the &quot;de jure&quot; Lord of the Manor upon their purchase of Aldermaston Court.

=== Post-World War II ===
During the 1940s RAF Aldermaston was created on the parkland at the southern end of the parish, with the Women&#x27;s Land Army and the XIX Tactical Air Command stationed on the estate. After World War II, the manor was returned to AEI who built the MERLIN reactor on part of the land. The reactor was opened on 6 November 1959 by The Duke of Edinburgh. With the opening of the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE) in 1950, Aldermaston became synonymous with a number of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) marches.

In 1953, Pole stepped down as Lord of the Manor and was succeeded by AEI&#x27;s senior representative, Thomas Allibone. Allibone held the position for 32 years, until Blue Circle Industries acquired the estate in 1985. Allibone was succeeded by Tony Jackson, and the current Lord of the Manor is Andy Hall. Blue Circle could not gain planning permission in the grounds of the court, so the MERLIN reactor was demolished to make way for Portland House. With a full redevelopment of Aldermaston Manor, the £14 million office development became Blue Circle&#x27;s international headquarters and the complex was opened by Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester.

==Governance==
Historically, Aldermaston was a hundred, though for a period it was within the Theale hundred. By the 19th century, the hundreds had been superseded by other sub-divisions. From then on, Aldermaston was, at times, part of the Bradfield Poor Law Union and Sanitary District, and the registration sub-districts of Mortimer (late 19th century) and Bucklebury (early 20th century). It was at all times an ecclesiastical parish and acquired civil parish status in the 1890s. The civil parish council is elected by every resident on West Berkshire elections. It is in the area of West Berkshire unitary authority. The electoral ward of Aldermaston includes the neighbouring parishes of Wasing, Brimpton, Midgham, and Woolhampton.

The ward is the smallest in West Berkshire by population. The ward&#x27;s councillor is Dominic Boeck, who represents the Conservative Party. Aldermaston is under the catchment of Thames Valley Police and is covered by the Brimpton Neighbourhood Policing Team. In a meeting with Aldermaston parish council, the police reported that 57 criminal offences were reported to have taken place in the parish between 2009 and 2010. Of this, the majority was theft from non-dwelling properties. Vehicle crime had dropped by 57% on the previous year but violent crime had risen from four to six incidents. Five of these crimes were reported to be domestic violence. There have been no reported cases of robbery in Aldermaston since 2006.

==Geography==

Aldermaston is in West Berkshire, about from the Hampshire boundary. The village is south of the A4 road that links the parish with Newbury and Reading. The main road in Aldermaston, The Street, is part of the A340 road and links the village with Pangbourne and Basingstoke. The course of Ermin Street, the Roman road that linked Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester) with Glevum (Gloucester) via Corinium Dobunnorum (Cirencester) runs south of the village, but none of the road survives in the area.

At the southern end of The Street is a small triangular village green called The Loosey—possibly named after a &quot;Lucy&quot; who planted the oak tree which stands on the green. The Loosey is the site of a Roman well, discovered in 1940 by a cow that almost fell down it. The Loosey was previously home to the village maypole (which was often climbed by Daniel Burr&#x27;s monkey) and a drinking fountain erected by Charles Keyser to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria.

The River Kennet and River Enborne flow through the parish, and their confluence is approximately north of the village. The Kennet and Avon Canal forms part of the parish&#x27;s boundaries with Woolhampton and Padworth. Sections of Grim&#x27;s Bank are in the parish. Part of the earthwork in the AWE complex survives at a height of and with a ditch deep. The village has a couple of Sites of Special Scientific Interest called West&#x27;s Meadow and Aldermaston Gravel Pits.

===Geology===
The landscape of Aldermaston is influenced by Paices Hill and Rag Hill, which are extremities of the chalk formation the North Wessex Downs as part of the Thames Basin Heaths. The topography of the land in the parish generally slopes northward to the River Kennet. The soil in the parish is high in clay. Due to the parish&#x27;s location within the Kennet Valley there is a high concentration of alluvium, with the content largely determined by the London Clay Formation, the Bagshot Formation, and the Bracklesham Beds.

===Flooding===
The quite flat low clay of Aldermaston&#x27;s north has with exceptional rainfall led to flooding certain populous streets on three occasions—1971, 1989, and 2007. The flood in 1971 caused by torrential rain was exacerbated by the non-porous tarmac and buildings of the Atomic Weapons Establishment which managed for the first time to overwhelm its balancing ponds. This happened again in July 1989, when an average of of rain was deposited across the parish in two hours; water rose above the ponds and broke through a brick wall. The destroyed wall was rebuilt with 17 grilles to avoid another build-up of water. A donation of £10,000 was given to the village by Blue Circle.

In July 2007, torrential rain flooded some of the traditional village centre and primary school. The storm coincided with the annual Glade Festival and jeopardised the event. The festival gates were temporarily closed while organisers assessed the flooding, which submerged one of the stages. The festival&#x27;s car park was incapacitated, with thousands of revellers stranded in the village and surrounding lanes. The floods also hit the Church of England primary school, with the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service evacuating pupils and staff from the school in life rafts.

The evacuation used four rafts, rescuing pupils and teachers from the school through windows. The 165 people (140 pupils and 25 members of staff) were taken uphill to the parish hall, where blankets and sleeping bags had been provided. Thames Valley Police stated that the emergency services were &quot;really stretched because of what happened over the county and the Glade event&quot;, that &quot;the A340 road junction was two or three-foot under water&quot;, and predicted that &quot;a lot of householders would be homeless.&quot;

==Demography==

The 1831 census showed that 68% of the employed population of Aldermaston were working class or &quot;labourers and servants&quot;. 20% were middle class (&quot;middling sorts&quot;), 10% were upper class (&quot;employers and professionals&quot;) and 2% were unclassified. In 1887 the population of the parish was 528. By 1896, the population had grown to 585. The population fluctuated steadily around 550 until the 1950s and 1960s, when a population explosion resulted in the 1961 UK census reporting 2,186 residents in the parish. This coincides with the opening of the Atomic Weapons Establishment in the early 1950s, and the majority of this figure counts residents in the parts of Tadley within the parish of Aldermaston—between 1901 and 1961, 368 houses were built in the parish.
A number of parish border changes occurred in the first half of the 20th century, including the net loss of to Beenham and Woolhampton on 1 April 1934 alone. By 2001, the parish population had reduced to 927.

The 2001 United Kingdom Census identified that 99.3% of householders in the parish as white. In 2005 30% of parish residents lived in the village. Of the 70% outside the village, 30% lived at Aldermaston Wharf, 20% in the local mobile home parks, 10% in the Falcon Fields development and 10% in &quot;other outlying areas&quot;. Falcon Fields is a housing development on the southern border of the parish, completed in the early 2000s. Ravenswing and Pinelands are mobile home parks near the Hampshire border. Raghill is an industrial area to the east of the parish, which has some light residential developments. The average age of residents in the parish is approximately 50 with 31.5% of residents in the 45–64 age group. The average age of residents of Aldermaston Wharf is 30.7, and in the mobile home parks the average age is 53.9. Of these, 53.3% were female. This is in contrast with the 2001 census data, which showed that 49.8% were female.

In 2005, 3% of the parish population were unemployed and 25% were retired. The retirement figure increased in the Pinelands and Ravenswing areas, with a statistic of 42%. Most residents&#x27; places of work are in surrounding towns, with their location in the parish largely dictating where to look for work. The 2005 survey identified that residents in the south of the parish (Falcon Fields and Ravenswing/Pinelands) travel towards Tadley and Basingstoke whereas those further north in the parish tend to find work in Reading, Newbury and London.

At this time, of homes were owned outright, with owned with a mortgage. Rented accommodation accounted for of residences. The population at the 2011 census was 1,015, giving a population density of .

==Economy==
Historically, the main source of industry in Aldermaston has been agriculture. According to the 1831 census, approximately 66% of working men (aged 20 and over) were employed in some form of agriculture. The next highest industry by workers was &quot;retail and handicrafts&quot;, which employed approximately 20%. Employment categories in the 1881 census were more discreet; just 20% of working men identified their employment as agriculture. 30% however, were listed as &quot;general or unspecified commodities&quot;. In this census, women&#x27;s employment was also documented. Of the 137 working women in the parish, 40 (slightly fewer than 30%) worked in domestic services, whereas 82 (approximately 60%) were of an unknown occupation.

===Agriculture===
In about 1797 a schoolmaster living in the village cultivated the Williams pear. The schoolmaster (either Mr Wheeler or his successor, John Stair) was the original cultivator, but the pear (a cultivar of the European Pear) was named after Richard Williams of Turnham Green, who grew several grafts of the original tree. On 5 December 1956, a plaque commemorating the tree was unveiled on the wall of the village school.

The Domesday survey records a mill in Aldermaston. Aldermaston Mill, previously called the &quot;Kingsmill&quot;, supplied flour to Huntley &amp; Palmers in Reading. The mill was owned by Wasing&#x27;s Mount family throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. The family let the mill to Francis Webb (1797–1811), Mr Sherwood (1811–1820), Mr King (1820–1824), Mr Waldren (1824–1828), Mr Mathews (1828–1848), and William Gilchrist (1848–1856). Gilchrist (Mathews&#x27; business partner) bought the mill from William Mount in 1856 using money inherited from his brother&#x27;s death the previous year. Owning it outright for approximately a year, he drowned in the River Kennet in 1857 after visiting the Angel public house in Woolhampton. Joseph Crockett purchased the mill in an auction the same year, before it was acquired by a Richard Sisling of Godalming in 1858. In approximately 1860, the mill was purchased by the Kersley family. Between then and 1885, it was operated by Anthony Kersley, a miller and maltster who employed &quot;six men and a boy, a carter, several domestic servants and a governess&quot;. Kersley&#x27;s son, also named Anthony, ran the mill until 1895. That year, Walter Parson bought the mill and operated it until approximately 1897. Charles Keyser subsequently oversaw the restoration on the mill building which &quot;had been untenanted for upwards of three years&quot;. He let the mill out to a Mr Iremonger from 1901. Locally farmed wheat was milled at Aldermaston Mill until the 1920s. Iremonger used the mill until the late 1920s, shortly before Keyser&#x27;s death. After Keyser had died and the Aldermaston estate had been divided and sold, his widow, Mary, approached Evelyn Arlott to run the mill as a tea room and guesthouse. The Arlott family purchased the mill in approximately 1939, after the death of Mary Keyser.

In 1939, there were seven farms on the Aldermaston estate—Forsters Farm, Village Farm, Church Farm, Upper Church Farm, Raghill Farm, Park Farm, and Soke Farm. These accounted for approximately 75% of the estate&#x27;s land. Aside from these, there were six smallholdings within the parish but outside the land owned by the court. These were Springhill Farm, Court Farm, Strawberry Farm, Circus Farm, Ravenswing Farm, and Frouds Farm. Of these, Church Farm and Forster&#x27;s Farm remain in operation. Upper Church Farm was originally known as Harry&#x27;s Farm, after a William Harry who died in 1544.

===Pubs and brewing===

The local pub is named The Hind&#x27;s Head in honour of the Forster family crest. Built in the 17th century and originally operating as a coaching inn, the establishment was named The Pack Horse during the and Forster lordships and The Congreve Arms throughout the Congreves&#x27; ownership. The building has a large black and gold clock set into the gable, and a small bell turret upon which is a gilt fox-shaped weather vane. The bell was intended to be rung as an air-raid siren during the Second World War. In the early 19th century the pub&#x27;s signboard carried the arms of the Congreve family, as well as branding for a company named &quot;Adams&quot;.

In the &quot;British Parliamentary Papers&quot; of 1817, the Committee on the State of the Police in the Metropolis reported evidence of a John Adams—a Reading-based distiller and hop merchant—who competed for business against H &amp; G Simonds Brewery. By 1850, the pub brewed beer on-site; a brewery was built as an out-building behind the main pub building. John Knight produced beer at the pub for 40 years, selling it for 2d. The brewery building is still in existence, with the wooden louvres still operational. The building is now the pub&#x27;s kitchen. In the 1970s, the pub was owned by Whitbread. In the mid-1990s the pub was taken over by Gales Brewery (having previously been a free house), later becoming tied to Fuller&#x27;s Brewery on their acquisition of Gales in 2006. In the 1970s, the pub was home to the Kennet Folk Club.

At the rear of the pub is the village lock-up. Built out of red brick, the small single-storey building has a shallow domed roof. The inside of the lock-up measures approximately by , and is enclosed by a studded door with a grille. It was last used in 1865 and its drunk inhabitant burnt himself to death trying to keep warm. The lock-up was designated as a Grade II listed building in April 1967. On 11 September 2010 the lock-up was opened to the public as part of the Heritage Open Days scheme. Another pub in the parish, The Butt Inn, is located approximately north-east of the village. The pub is named after the archery butts that were located in the fields opposite the pub. The Falcon Inn was on the southern border of the parish. The pub closed in 2009 and was demolished in 2011. The Aldermaston Brewery was established at Aldermaston Wharf in 1770, and was demolished in the 1950s. It was replaced with a cable factory, which was demolished in 1990.

===Cricket bats===
Old Village Farm (on Fishermans Lane) is the location of a wood yard, used since the 1930s to prepare local willow for the production of cricket bats. The trees are grown at Harbour Hill Copse, where 70 trees are felled annually for this purpose. There are approximately 1000 trees growing at any given time. The workers at the yard cut the wood into approximate bat shapes, then cure the wood in a kiln. The clefts of wood are then shipped to India, where the final manufacturing can be undertaken under moisture-controlled conditions. In the 1960s, &quot;Blue Peter&quot; aired a short documentary on the cricket bat production entitled &quot;The Life of a Cricket Bat&quot;. It was presented by Christopher Trace.

The yard would take on three up-coming cricketers for the winter, in the hope that the hard work would &quot;toughen them up&quot; to get them picked for the England cricket team. One year the yard had help from Frank Tyson, Alan Moss, and Peter Loader. The following year they hosted three Davids—David Kaufman, David Spragbury, and David Gibson. The wood yard was featured on &quot;A Question of Sport&quot;, when cricketer Graham Gooch took part in the programme&#x27;s &quot;Mystery Guest&quot; round. Gooch endorsed the bats made from Aldermaston willow, which were sold by Stuart Surridge. When he scored 333 runs against India at Lord&#x27;s in the 1990 test season, the Turbo 333 bat, made from Aldermaston wood, was launched in his honour.

===Pottery===
In 1955, the Aldermaston Pottery was established on the main street by studio potters Alan Caiger-Smith and Geoffrey Eastop. The pottery was renowned for tin-glazed and porcelain wares, which used scrap wood from the Village Farm woodyard to fire the kiln.
The pottery closed in 2006. It had previously scaled back its output in 1993 due to Caiger-Smith&#x27;s partial retirement after the 1992 recession.

=== Atomic Weapons Establishment ===

The Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), for which Aldermaston has become known, is less than south of the village. The establishment is where the United Kingdom designs and manufactures the warheads for its stock of Trident missiles, and where decommissioned and redundant nuclear warheads are dismantled. In April 1958, the first Aldermaston March was held. The march saw around 3,000 protesters march from London to Aldermaston over four days, with a total attendance of 12,000 at the establishment&#x27;s gates.

The 50th anniversary of the event was marked on 24 March 2008 with the &quot;Bomb Stops Here&quot; protest, attended by Vivienne Westwood and Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) president Walter Wolfgang. The 2008 demonstration was the biggest protest staged by CND in ten years. Until 2005, AWE discharged &quot;pre-treated waste water&quot; into the River Thames at Pangbourne via an pipeline which runs under roads and fields within the parish. A water processing facility was installed on-site in 2006, though the Pangbourne Pipeline remains &quot;in situ&quot;.

=== Other businesses ===
Lafarge Aggregates owns various sites in the parish. In 1974 the village won an appeal against Pioneer Concrete&#x27;s application for gravel extraction near the village. Similar events took place in March 2003 when hundreds of local residents protested against an application of gravel extraction by Lafarge. Larfarge&#x27;s initial appeal, in April 2003, was turned down by West Berkshire Council. A further application to extract aggregate at the Wasing Estate was due to be decided in 2010. One former extraction site, Butts Lake Quarry, is now a local nature reserve and the flooded lakes have been identified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is now operated by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust (BBOWT). The reserve contains specimens of trees such as alder, cherry, hawthorn, oak, and willow. Examples of reeds present include &quot;typha latifolia&quot;, &quot;phragmites australis&quot;, &quot;mentha aquatica&quot;, and &quot;lythrum salicaria&quot;. Numerous species of bird nest in the reserve, including the common teal, shoveler, common kingfisher, water rail, and common nightingale.

Britain&#x27;s first roadside petrol station was opened by The AA on the Bath Road near Aldermaston on 2 March 1919. The following year, one villager requested that a pump be installed by his house. &quot;Chuffer&quot; Ford, who lived in The Forge with his wife Olive, was told by Keyser that it must be &quot;behind a wall and recessed&quot;. A hole was cut in the brick wall beside Ford&#x27;s yard to house the Shell-branded pump. The location of this pump is marked by a square hole in the present wall. Ford&#x27;s business offered other motoring services, with signage reading &quot;vacuum, oil, and cycles&quot;. There is a number of small businesses in the village, including a florist and the village shop. In the 1970s the hairdressers was a music shop, which was opened by Terry Wogan. Before this it was a cooperative village stores started by Charles Keyser.

There are two business parks in the parish—Calleva Business Park (on the Berkshire/Hampshire border) and Youngs Industrial Estate on Paices Hill. The latter opened in the early 1980s, and is the location of Paices Wood Country Parkland, a wildlife project managed by BBOWT. In 2007 Aldermaston won the Business Category Award in the regional final of the Calor Village of the Year competition. The judges stated that the village &quot;has a very successful business community&quot; and that &quot;local businesses are well-supported by villagers and in return these businesses support village activities&quot;. In addition to the business award, the village was announced as the Overall Winner of the &quot;English Country Village of the Year&quot; competition in 2006, as well as category winners in the &quot;Building Community Life&quot;, &quot;Business&quot;, &quot;Young People&quot; and &quot;ICT&quot; categories.

==Architecture==
The majority of houses in the village were built between the 17th and late 19th centuries, including examples of Victorian Gothic architecture. Only one house has been built on the village&#x27;s main street since the early 20th century. The parish hall, built in 1897, is predominantly flint and brick. Most of the houses in the village are Grade II listed buildings, and many were built using local red and blue bricks. In total, 51 structures in the parish are listed, including gatepiers, greenhouses, a tomb, railings and a wall, the village red telephone box and Aldermaston Lock.

==Culture==
Since the early 1800s, Aldermaston has held a candle auction every three years. The open auction starts with a horseshoe nail driven through a tallow candle an inch below the wick and lit in the parish hall. a plot of granted to the church in 1815 after the inclosure act, the Woolhampton Inclosure Act 1811 (51 Geo. 3. c. c). The proceedings are overseen by the vicar and churchwardens, who drink rum punch throughout the auction. Traditionally, the churchwardens smoked clay pipes during the event. The parish hall often holds other events, such as plays produced by the village&#x27;s own amateur dramatics society. The society, known as The Aldermaston Players, have staged fundraising events in the village in 1996. In 1976, the parish hall hosted an episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Any Questions?&quot;.

The village, along with the neighbouring parish of Wasing, holds an annual produce show at The Old Mill. The show, which was previously held behind the Hind&#x27;s Head pub, hosts produce competitions in approximately 100 classes. In the 1990s, a team of gardeners formed from the produce show entered the Chelsea Flower Show. They won a silver gilt in the &quot;Best Courtyard Garden Award&quot; in two consecutive years, for gardens named &quot;Calma&quot; and &quot;Time Lords&quot;. The parish of Aldermaston forms a group with the local parishes of Wasing and Brimpton. The three share a monthly Parish Magazine featuring stories from churches, organisations, schools, businesses and various miscellany. Since 1957 there has been an annual performance of the York Nativity Play from the 15th century York Mystery Cycle. The play follows a script by E. Martin Browne with carols by William Byrd, Johannes Eccard, and Michael Praetorius. The performances are at the village church in early December, and the actors are local people who have appeared in the play for many years. In 1964, the play was recorded and broadcast by the BBC Home Service under the title of &quot;Star Over Aldermaston&quot;. One member of the production team was David Shute.

Aldermaston was mentioned in &quot;Plum Pie&quot; (1966) by P. G. Wodehouse—&quot;Every now and then we march from Aldermaston, protesting like a ton of bricks... And then we sit a good deal.&quot;
This was a reference to the demonstrations of the CND (the Aldermaston Marches) which took the form of marches from Aldermaston to London (apart from in 1958, when the march went from London to Aldermaston). This was an annual march from 1958 to 1963.
Aldermaston was the original location of Glade Festival. The 2007 event was jeopardised by torrential rains and flooding but cautiously went ahead. In 2009, the festival moved from the area and was held near Winchester. Between 2006 and 2017, blues festival &quot;Blues on the Meadow&quot; was held in the village.

==Transport==

 railway station is in Aldermaston Wharf, from the village itself. The station is managed by National Rail and served by Great Western Railway services between and . The village is south-east of the Kennet and Avon Canal at Aldermaston Wharf, which provides waterway links to London (via the Thames) and Bristol (via the River Avon). The village is on the A340 road, and has nearby access to the A4 road and the M4 motorway.

A West Berkshire Council-run bus service, route 44, serves the village and provides a connection with Thatcham and Calcot The 2005 Parish Plan identified a need for a relief road near the village. A report was presented in 2009 evaluating the problems caused by HGV traffic through the village, and described solutions which included support from Newbury MP Richard Benyon. The nearest operating airstrip, Brimpton Airfield, is less than west of the village, within AWE&#x27;s restricted airspace. RAF Aldermaston ceased to operate as a civilian airport in 1950.

==Education==
The parish of Aldermaston has two primary schools. Aldermaston Primary School is a Local Authority-run Church of England school in Wasing Lane and has about 150 pupils. It was established in 1836 and originally located in Church Road, moving to the present site in 1988. The school uses the names of the manor&#x27;s squires in its house system. Between 1992 and 2021, The Cedars (a private school) was located in original building of the Church of England school and had an enrolment of approximately 30. It reopened in 2022 as a day nursery. Alder Bridge Steiner School, although located in Aldermaston Wharf, is within the parish of Padworth. Padworth College is situated on the border of Aldermaston and Padworth parishes.

==Religious sites==
The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary the Virgin was built in the mid-12th century. The Norman building was altered throughout the following millennium, particularly in 13th, 14th, 15th and 17th centuries. The 12th-century building now comprises the current nave, with additions seen in the Forster Chapel and chancel (13th century), the steeple (14th century), and vestry (17th century). The 17th-century Jacobean pulpit is an unusual heptagonal design. Various additions were made to the structure in the 14th and 15th centuries, primarily to the walls and ogee windows. A scratch dial was added to the south-west buttress in the 14th century.

The church features architecture by Edward Doran Webb and stained glass by Charles Eamer Kempe. The Forster Chapel, a lady chapel added to the south face in the 13th century, contains the alabaster effigial monument of Sir George Forster and his wife Elizabeth which was built in 1530. Evidence suggests that the chapel may originally have been a chantry dedicated to St Nicholas. The roundel windows in the north wall date from the 13th century and are the oldest glass in Berkshire. The tower has a peal of eight bells dating from 1681 to 1900. The current organ, which has 16 stops, was installed in 1880. Individuals buried in the churchyard include squires Charles Keyser (1847–1929) and Daniel Burr (–1885), schoolmaster John Stair (c.1745–1820), and Maria Hale (1791–1879).

==Sport==
Aldermaston has a number of sports teams. The village cricket team, Aldermaston Village CC, play at nearby Wasing Park. The club, which first played in 1786 as &quot;The Gentlemen of Aldermaston&quot;, originally played at a pitch at Aldermaston Court. The ground was lost when the airfield was built. Sir William Mount, 2nd Baronet, the grandfather of British Prime Minister David Cameron, allowed a cricket pitch to be established on a portion of his Wasing estate. The original football club played next to the cricket pitch. The club&#x27;s strip was sponsored by George L Heighton, the proprietor of the village shop. Aldermaston Rugby Club and A.F.C. Aldermaston both play their home games at the Recreational Society at AWE. Tadley RFC is in the parish, about from the village. Aldermaston Raceway, a banger racing and stock car venue, was located in the parish. A course for off-road 4x4 trials is close to the raceway.

<text>Malå (, ) is a locality and the seat of Malå Municipality in Västerbotten County, province of Lapland, Sweden with 2,050 inhabitants in 2010.

== History ==
The Swedish name Malå comes from the Sami &quot;Máláge&quot;. The origin is unclear, but the word might derive from &quot;málle,&quot; which means blood or sap. A later interpretation is that Máláge refers back to the Swedish name, which was associated with the river (Måll-ån in 1553). It has been assumed that the river&#x27;s name comes from the Swedish dialect word &quot;mal,&quot; meaning &#x27;sand, gravel, or small stones.

Malå is the parish village in Malå parish and was part of Malå rural municipality after the municipal reform of 1862. On May 30, 1941, the Malåträsks municipal community was established for the village, which was dissolved on December 31, 1952. Between 1971 and 1974, and since 1983, the village has been part of Malå Municipality, where it is the central locality. Between 1974 and 1983, the village was part of Norsjö Municipality.

<doc id="1017707" wikidata="Q1019101" url="?curid=1017707" title="Degerfors">
<text>Degerfors () is a locality and the seat of Degerfors Municipality, Örebro County, Sweden, with 7,160 inhabitants in 2010. Degerfors is the sixth-largest city in Örebro County. It is located at the southern shore of lake Möckeln, 13 km (8 mi) south of neighboring Karlskoga.

Degerfors evolved around the ironworks, that is nowadays owned by the Finnish conglomerate Outokumpu Oyj. It is also home to the football club Degerfors IF, which is playing in the second tier of Swedish football, Superettan.

== History ==
Degerfors has traditionally been an industrial community closely connected to the large ironworks, associated with members of the Camitz family. The settlement (originally called Johannelund) grew up around this industry and got the status of a &quot;municipalsamhälle&quot; (a type of borough within a municipality) in 1912. Today it acts as seat of the larger Degerfors Municipality.

In the 1870s, a group of people native to the Degerfors-area emigrated to the Ural region (then part of the Russian Empire).

==Economy==
The steelworks is now owned by the Finnish conglomerate Outokumpu Oyj.

The location has a railway station and a narrow-gauge railway connecting it with Bredsjö, the .

Tourists to the region usually stop at the Sveafallen nature reserve.

==Sveafallen==

Degesfors is the site of Sveafallen, a geological landscape of small canyons and giant&#x27;s kettles. Immediately south of Degerfors lies the nature reserve of Sveafallen. The reserve contains a series of small canyons as well as numerous and large giant&#x27;s kettles. Sveafallen was long held to be the outlet of the Ancylus Lake, a fresh-water predecessor to the Baltic Sea. The site was first discovered in 1923 by Lennart von Post being the focus of a protracted and sometimes bitter scientific debate that involved not only von Post but also figures such as Henrik Munthe, Astrid Cleve and Curt Fredén. The site was initially proposed to be the dry remnant of a dramatic river or waterfall comparable to Niagara Falls. Research by Curt Fredén cast well founded doubts on this view, with the final demise being a 1981 study by Birgitta Ericsson et al showing that the giant&#x27;s kettles in the area are older than the Ancylus Lake. Sveafallen is now believed to have formed by meltwater streams under the Fennoscandian ice sheet.

==Sports==
Nationally, Degerfors is best known for the football team Degerfors IF. Despite the relatively small size of the town, Degerfors has always had strong local support, and played a total of 29 years in the highest division Allsvenskan. In 1997 the team were relegated and were playing in the second highest Swedish league, Superettan until they achieved promotion back to Allsvenskan (highest Swedish league) in 2020.

Another sports club located in Degerfors is Strömtorps IK.

<doc id="1017709" wikidata="Q1643900" url="?curid=1017709" title="Arrowhead">
<text>An arrowhead or point is the usually sharpened and hardened tip of an arrow, which contributes a majority of the projectile mass and is responsible for impacting and penetrating a target, or sometimes for special purposes such as signaling.

The earliest arrowheads were made of stone and of organic materials; as human civilizations progressed, other alloy materials were used. Arrowheads are important archaeological artifacts; they are a subclass of projectile points. Modern enthusiasts still &quot;produce over one million brand-new spear and arrow points per year&quot;.

A craftsman who manufactures arrowheads is called an arrowsmith.

== History ==

In the Stone Age, people used sharpened bone, flintknapped stones, flakes, and chips and bits of rock as weapons and tools. Such items remained in use throughout human civilization, with new materials used as time passed. As archaeological artifacts such objects are classed as projectile points, without specifying whether they were projected by a bow or by some other means such as throwing since the specific means of projection (the bow, the arrow shaft, the spear shaft, etc.) is found too seldom in direct association with any given point and the word &quot;arrow&quot; would imply a certainty about these points which simply does not exist.

Such artifacts can be found all over the world in various locations. Those that have survived are usually made of stone, primarily consisting of flint, obsidian, or chert. In many excavations, bone, wooden, and metal arrowheads have also been found.

The oldest known arrowheads likely date to 74,000 years ago in Ethiopia. Stone projectile points from 64,000 years were excavated in Sibudu Cave, South Africa. In these points, examinations found traces of blood and bone residues, and glue made from a plant-based resin that was used to fasten them on to a wooden shaft. This indicated &quot;cognitively demanding behavior&quot; required to manufacture glue.

These hafted points might have been launched from bows. While &quot;most attributes such as micro-residue distribution patterns and micro-wear will develop similarly on points used to tip spears, darts or arrows&quot; and &quot;explicit tests for distinctions between thrown spears and projected arrows have not yet been conducted&quot; the researchers find &quot;contextual support&quot; for the use of these points on arrows: a broad range of animals was hunted, with an emphasis on taxa that prefer closed forested niches, including fast moving, terrestrial and arboreal animals. This is an argument for the use of traps, perhaps including snares. If snares were used, the use of cords and knots which would also have been adequate for the production of bows is implied. The employment of snares also demonstrates a practical understanding of the latent energy stored in bent branches, the main principle of bow construction. Cords and knots are implied by use-wear facets on perforated shell beads around 72,000 years old from Blombos. Archeologists in Louisiana have discovered that early Native Americans used Alligator gar scales as arrow heads.

&quot;Hunting with a bow and arrow requires intricate multi-staged planning, material collection and tool preparation and implies a range of innovative social and communication skills.&quot;

== Design ==
Arrowheads are attached to arrow shafts to be shot from a bow; similar types of projectile points may be attached to a spear and &quot;thrown&quot; by means of an atlatl (spear thrower).

The arrowhead or projectile point is the primary functional part of the arrow, and plays the largest role in determining its purpose. Some arrows may simply use a sharpened tip of the solid shaft, but it is far more common for separate arrowheads to be made, usually from metal, horn, rock, or some other hard material.

Arrowheads may be attached to the shaft with a cap, a socket tang, or inserted into a split in the shaft and held by a process called hafting. Points attached with caps are simply slid snugly over the end of the shaft, or may be held on with hot glue. In medieval Europe, arrowheads were adhered with hide glue. Split-shaft construction involves splitting the arrow shaft lengthwise, inserting the arrowhead, and securing it using ferrule, sinew, rope, or wire.

Modern arrowheads used for hunting come in a variety of classes and styles. Many traditionalist archers choose heads made of modern high carbon steel that closely resemble traditional stone heads (see Variants). Other classes of broadheads referred to as &quot;mechanical&quot; and &quot;hybrid&quot; are gaining popularity. Often, these heads rely on force created by passing through an animal to expand or open.

== Variants ==

Arrowheads are usually separated by function:
* &quot;Bodkin points&quot; are short, rigid points with a small cross-section. They were made of unhardened iron and may have been used for better or longer flight, or for cheaper production. It has been suggested that the bodkin came into its own as a means of penetrating armour, however limited research has so far found no hardened bodkin points, so it appears likely that it was first designed either to extend range or as a cheaper and simpler alternative to the broadhead. In a modern test, a direct hit from a hard steel bodkin point penetrated a set of fifteenth-century chain armour made in Damascus. However, archery was minimally effective against plate armour, which became available to knights of fairly modest means by the late 14th century. 
* &quot;Judo points&quot; have spring wires extending sideways from the tip. These catch on grass and debris to prevent the arrow from being lost in the vegetation. Used for practice and for small game.
* &quot;Broadheads&quot; were used for war and are still used for hunting. Medieval broadheads could be made from steel, sometimes with hardened edges. They usually have two to four sharp blades that cause massive bleeding in the victim. Their function is to deliver a wide cutting edge so as to kill as quickly as possible. They are expensive, damage most targets, and are usually not used for practice. Two main types of broadheads are used by hunters: the &quot;fixed-blade broadhead&quot; and the &quot;mechanical broadhead&quot;. While the fixed-blade broadhead keeps its blades rigid and unmovable on the broadhead at all times, the mechanical broadhead deploys its blades upon contact with the target, its blades swinging out to wound the target. &quot;There are three requirements to making a broadhead. 1. It must be wide enough to cut through tissue to produce a quick, clean kill. 2. It must be narrow enough to penetrate well. 3. It must be of a shape that can be sharpened well.&quot; A few models known as &quot;hybrid broadheads&quot; have both fixed and replaceable blades, most often two relatively small fixed blades and two longer mechanically opening blades. 

The mechanical head flies better because it is more streamlined, but has less penetration as it uses some of the kinetic energy in the arrow to deploy its blades.

* &quot;Three-bladed&quot;, &quot;trilobate&quot;, or &quot;Scythian&quot; arrowheads appears in regions under influence of the Scythians and ancient Persians. It was the type normally used by the Achaemenid army.
* &quot;Target points&quot; are bullet-shaped with a sharp point, designed to penetrate target butts easily without causing excessive damage to them.
* &quot;Field points&quot; are similar to target points and have a distinct shoulder, so that missed outdoor shots do not become as stuck in obstacles such as tree stumps. They are also used for shooting practice by hunters, by offering similar flight characteristics and weights as broadheads, without getting lodged in target materials and causing excessive damage upon removal.
* &quot;Safety arrows&quot; are designed to be used in various forms of reenactment combat, to reduce the risk when shot at people. These arrows may have heads that are very wide or padded. In combination with bows of restricted draw weight and draw length, these heads may reduce to acceptable levels the risks of shooting arrows at suitably armoured people. The parameters will vary depending on the specific rules being used and on the levels of risk felt acceptable to the participants. For instance, SCA combat rules require a padded head at least in diameter, with bows not exceeding and of draw for use against well-armoured individuals. The Australia/New Zealand based SCA Kingdom of Lochac use bows and much smaller safety arrow heads similar to modern rubber bird blunts for their combat archery as these more accurately simulate real arrows.

<text>Nagykanizsa (; , or just &quot;Kaniža/Kanjiža&quot;; ; ; ; ), known colloquially as Kanizsa, is a medium-sized city in Zala County in southwestern Hungary. It is a city with county rights.

It lies not far from Lake Balaton at the meeting point of five routes. For centuries the town has been a connecting link. Goods from Slavonia were transported to Graz via Nagykanizsa, and the town played an important role in the trade from the Adriatic Sea to the Alpine region, Vienna, and Budapest.

==History==

The city&#x27;s oldest Roman-era ruins were excavated in the 1960s. During the Middle Ages, Nagykanizsa became one of the most important strongholds of the Hungarian Kingdom. The fortress had a significant role in the southern shield-line of Hungary, guarding the whole of Western Europe against attacks by the Ottoman Empire.

The name &quot;Kanizsa&quot; was first mentioned in a document in 1245. The Kanizsai family continued building the castle and constructed a rectangular castle with an enclosed back yard on an islet in the River Kanizsa. The town and the castle were in their prime in the first half of the 16th century, when Kanizsa became a centre of trade with Italy and Styria.

Szigetvár and Kanizsa became the most important strongholds in southern Hungary. In 1600, the Turkish army occupied the castle. This castle was the center of an Ottoman eyalet including the sanjaks of Sigetvar, Kopan, Valpuva, Siklos, Nadaj, and Balatin until 1690 (see Ottoman Hungary), when the city was invaded by the Habsburg armies.

In 1601, during the Ottoman-Habsburg War of 1593–1606, a siege began on September 9 and ended on November 18. The Habsburg forces were commanded by Ferdinand, the Archduke of Austria, and Tiryaki Hasan Pasha commanded the defence of the castle. Hasan Pasha won the fight against the ten-times larger army of Austrians with many cunning military ploys, and was raised to the rank of Vizier.

At the beginning of the 18th century, the holder of the castle moved German, Croatian, and Serbian settlers into the deserted town. A particularly mixed ethnic group lived in a suburb called Kiskanizsa. After the Turks were driven out (1690), the town lost its strategic significance, so the Vienna war council demolished the castle in 1702.

Business became lively, trade became important again, and crafts developed significantly. In 1765 the Piarist order started to provide elementary and secondary education&#x27; supported by Lajos Batthyány, palatine of Hungary. The first business school of Transdanubia opened in Nagykanizsa, and in 1895 it was made into a college.

Many people who had attended Nagykanizsa&#x27;s schools became famous: Benedek Virág, Pál Király, Ferenc Deák, Károly Kaán, Sándor Hevesi, and Ferenc Mező all studied in the ancient buildings of Nagykanizsa&#x27;s &quot;almae matres&quot;.

Nagykanizsa started a new phase of large-scale development in the 1860s. The railway connecting Nagykanizsa with Vienna, Budapest, and Rijeka was constructed at that time. There was rapid development in industry as well. Industrial and commercial development resulted in the foundation of banks. Besides the four local banks, an Austro-Hungarian and an Anglo-Hungarian bank also opened branch offices in town. Telephone lines were established and the town was connected with a long-distance system in 1895. At the same time, a 70-bed hospital was opened.

During World War I, military barracks were built in the town. This necessitated the construction of a municipal water-network. Kanizsa became a modern town; drainage-system construction and paving of streets began. World War I caused grave consequences - changes in international boundaries isolated Kanizsa, which lost its markets in the south and west.

Oil helped the town to survive. After successful exploration by the American corporation &quot;Eurogasco&quot;, Hungarian-American Oil Inc. ( - MAORT) was formed in 1938.
Nagykanizsa became the centre of the Hungarian oil industry. Near the end of World War II, the Nagykanizsa oil-fields were the last remaining ones available to the Germans, and to protect these fields the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; launched the last German offensive of the war, Operation Spring Awakening, on 6 March 1945. This failed (15 March 1945) and the town soon fell to the Soviet and Bulgarian Nagykanizsa–Körmend Offensive of March to April 1945.

Beer brewed in Kanizsa Brewery regained its reputation as one of the best Hungarian beers, carrying off the palm at more and more international competitions – at the beginning of the century the brewery was closed as demand for beer fell drastically. Kanizsa Trend Ltd. grew out of the company, with its furniture products gaining a high reputation all over Europe. The predecessor of the present-day Tungsram Plc, now belonging to General Electric, started operations in 1965. It is now one of the biggest light-bulb factories in the world.

Károlyi Park, City Park, and large squares like Kossuth, Eötvös, and Erzsébet squares were extended after 1962. A boating lake was formed, becoming a popular recreation centre. In the 2010s Nagykanizsa attracts thousands of dental tourists.

<doc id="1017713" wikidata="Q2716919" url="?curid=1017713" title="Epidural hematoma">
<text>Epidural hematoma is when bleeding occurs between the tough outer membrane covering the brain (dura mater) and the skull. When this condition occurs in the spinal canal, it is known as a spinal epidural hematoma.

There may be loss of consciousness following a head injury, a brief regaining of consciousness, and then loss of consciousness again. Other symptoms may include headache, confusion, vomiting, and an inability to move parts of the body. Complications may include seizures.
The cause is typically a head injury that results in a break of the temporal bone and bleeding from the middle meningeal artery. Occasionally it can occur as a result of a bleeding disorder or blood vessel malformation. Diagnosis is typically by a CT scan or MRI scan.
Treatment is generally by urgent surgery in the form of a craniotomy or burr hole, or (in the case of a spinal epidural hematoma) laminotomy with spinal decompression.

The condition occurs in one to four percent of head injuries. Typically it occurs in young adults. Males are more often affected than females.

==Signs and symptoms==
Many people with epidural hematomas experience a lucid period immediately following the injury, with a delay before symptoms become evident. Because of this initial period of lucidity, it has been called &quot;Talk and Die&quot; syndrome. As blood accumulates, it starts to compress intracranial structures, which may impinge on the third cranial nerve, causing a fixed and dilated pupil on the side of the injury. The eye will be positioned down and out due to unopposed innervation of the fourth and sixth cranial nerves.

Other symptoms include severe headache; weakness of the extremities on the opposite side from the lesion due to compression of the crossed pyramid pathways; and vision loss, also on the opposite side, due to compression of the posterior cerebral artery. In rare cases, small hematomas may be asymptomatic.

If not treated promptly, epidural hematomas can cause tonsillar herniation, resulting in respiratory arrest. The trigeminal nerve may be involved late in the process as the pons is compressed, but this is not an important presentation, because the person may already be dead by the time it occurs. In the case of epidural hematoma in the posterior cranial fossa, tonsillar herniation causes Cushing&#x27;s triad: hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular breathing.

==Causes==
The most common cause of intracranial epidural hematoma is head injury, although spontaneous hemorrhages have been known to occur. Epidural hematomas occur in about 10% of traumatic brain injuries, mostly due to car accidents, assaults, or falls. They are often caused by acceleration-deceleration trauma and transverse forces.

Epidural hematoma commonly results from a blow to the side (temporal bone) of the head. The pterion region, which overlies the middle meningeal artery, is relatively weak and prone to injury. Only 20 to 30% of epidural hematomas occur outside the region of the temporal bone. The brain may be injured by prominences on the inside of the skull as it scrapes past them. Epidural hematoma is usually found on the same side of the brain which was impacted by the blow, but on very rare occasions it can be due to a contrecoup injury.

A &quot;heat hematoma&quot; is an epidural hematoma caused by severe thermal burn, causing contraction and exfoliation of the dura mater and exfoliate from the skull, in turn causing exudation of blood from the venous sinuses. The hematoma can be seen on autopsy as brick red, or as radiolucent on CT scan, because of heat-induced coagulation of the hematoma.

== Pathophysiology ==
The break of the temporal bone causes bleeding from the middle meningeal artery, hence epidural bleeding is often rapid as arteries are high-pressure flow. In 10% of cases, however, it comes from veins and can progress more slowly. A venous hematoma may be acute (occurring within a day of the injury and appearing as a swirling mass of blood without a clot), subacute (occurring in 2–4 days and appearing solid), or chronic (occurring in 7–20 days and appearing mixed or lucent).

In adults, the temporal region accounts for 75% of cases. In children, however, they occur with similar frequency in the occipital, frontal, and posterior fossa regions. Epidural bleeds from arteries can grow until they reach their peak size 6–8 hours post-injury, spilling 25–75 cubic centimeters of blood into the intracranial space. As the hematoma expands, it strips the dura from the inside of the skull, causing an intense headache. It also increases intracranial pressure, causing the brain to shift, lose blood supply, be crushed against the skull, or herniate. Larger hematomas cause more damage. Epidural bleeds can quickly compress the brainstem, causing unconsciousness, abnormal posturing, and abnormal pupil responses to light.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is typically by CT scan or MRI. MRIs have greater sensitivity and should be used if there is a high suspicion of epidural hematoma and a negative CT scan. Differential diagnoses include a transient ischemic attack, intracranial mass, or brain abscess.

Epidural hematomas usually appear convex in shape because their expansion stops at the skull&#x27;s sutures, where the dura mater is tightly attached to the skull. Thus, they expand inward toward the brain rather than along the inside of the skull, as occurs in subdural hematomas. Most people also have a skull fracture.

Epidural hematomas may occur in combination with subdural hematomas, or either may occur alone. CT scans reveal subdural or epidural hematomas in 20% of unconscious people. In the hallmark of epidural hematoma, people may regain consciousness and appear completely normal during what is called a lucid interval, only to descend suddenly and rapidly into unconsciousness later. This lucid interval, which depends on the extent of the injury, is a key to diagnosing an epidural hematoma.

==Treatment==
Epidural hematoma is a surgical emergency. Delayed surgery can result in permanent brain damage or death. Without surgery, death usually follows, due to enlargement of the hematoma, causing a brain herniation. As with other types of intracranial hematomas, the blood almost always must be removed surgically to reduce the pressure on the brain. The hematoma is evacuated through a burr hole or craniotomy. If transfer to a facility with neurosurgery is unavailable, prolonged trephination (drilling a hole into the skull) may be performed in the emergency department. Large hematomas and blood clots may require an open craniotomy.

Medications may be given after surgery. They may include antiseizure medications and hyperosmotic agents to reduce brain swelling and intracranial pressure.

It is extremely rare to not require surgery. If the volume of the epidural hematoma is less than 30 mL, the clot diameter less than 15 mm, a Glasgow Coma Score above 8, and no visible neurological symptoms, then it may be possible to treat it conservatively. A CT scan should be performed, and watchful waiting should be done, as the hematoma may suddenly expand.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis is better if there was a lucid interval than if the person was comatose from the time of injury. Arterial epidural hematomas usually progress rapidly. However, venous epidural hematomas, caused by a dural sinus tear, are slower.

Outcomes are worse if there is more than 50 mL of blood in the hematoma before surgery. Age, pupil abnormalities, and Glasgow Coma Scale score on arrival to the emergency department also influence the prognosis. In contrast to most forms of traumatic brain injury, people with epidural hematoma and a Glasgow Coma Score of 15 (the highest score, indicating the best prognosis) usually have a good outcome if they receive surgery quickly.

== Epidemiology ==
About 2 percent of head injuries and 15 percent of fatal head injuries involve an epidural hematoma. The condition is more common in teenagers and young adults than in older people, because the dura mater sticks more to the skull as a person ages, reducing the probability of a hematoma forming. Males are affected more than females.

<doc id="1017718" wikidata="Q2806647" url="?curid=1017718" title="100% (game show)">
<text>100% is a British television game show that was shown in the United Kingdom every weekday at 5.30pm from 31 March 1997, the day after the inception of its host television station Channel 5, until 24 December 2001, running for over 1,000 editions. Each show ran for 30 minutes with one commercial break. A Reg Grundy production, it was often billed as &quot;The game show without a host&quot;, as viewers only saw the contestants, although a voiceover was provided by Robin Houston, who also presented &quot;One To Win&quot;, another daily quiz show on the same channel. He read the questions off-screen throughout the show and was never seen by the viewers nor, indeed, by the contestants. To keep production costs down, the shows were pre-recorded &quot;as live&quot; and in batches, normally over a weekend. The maximum number of shows that were recorded in one day was twelve, although the normal recording day saw ten shows being produced. There was a weekday afternoon spinoff series called &quot;100% Gold&quot; which featured older contestants and was presented by Melinda Walker, plus a late-night series called &quot;100% Sex&quot; which had questions of a more adult nature. All editions were recorded at Pearson Television&#x27;s studios in Stephen Street, London.

In its original format, three players had three seconds to push buttons on the set corresponding to the multiple-choice answers of 100 general-knowledge questions.

During its run, a number of one-off specials were produced, usually to tie-in with a themed day or evening by the broadcaster, Channel 5.

Although pulling in reasonable ratings for the channel, it was dropped as part of a station revamp just before 2002.

==Scores==
The original twist to the show was that, throughout the whole game, the players were told the individual scores (as a percentage of the number of questions answered correctly to that point), but not the player to whom those scores belonged. The scores were given to the contestants after 10, 30, 50, 60, 80, and all 100 questions had been asked, as a percentage of the number of questions they had correctly answered. They were also told whether there had been a change in the lead.

Later on, the rules were changed so that the players now knew who had which scores for the first 50 questions. In all cases, the audience could see who had what score and during the last ten questions the scores were displayed on screen after each answer.

===Question fields===
Originally, the format of the show was that 100 questions would be asked without an overall subject. In its later format, the subject would change every ten questions, with 1–10 and 81–100 being general knowledge. Every fifth question was a true or false question, and question 100 took the form of a ludicrous fact that was almost always true. In the case of a tie, a 101st question, always true or false, was asked, and if both players got it right the faster player to answer won. All questions, answer options, and correct answers were displayed on-screen for viewers to see.

===Winnings===
The person with the most questions answered correctly received the nominal sum of £100 and was invited to return as champion in the next show. The players did not speak at all during each episode, other than to state their names and towns at the start of the show (with the champion stating their occupation instead); the winner only responded whether he/she would be able to return.

==International versions==
Producer Pearson Television (Grundy&#x27;s parent) brought the show to the United States in January 1999; originally hosted in the 1998 pilot by Mark Henning, the show went to series with Casey Kasem as host. This version offered $10 per correct answer, with a $99,000 bonus to any contestant who managed a perfect score (for a total of $100,000); it was never won during the show&#x27;s brief run. The show, which aired on only seven stations (in Seattle, Washington; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Houston, Texas; Buffalo, New York; Jacksonville, Florida; and Tampa, Florida) on a limited run, did not last a full season.

In Europe, the TV format was sold in France with the local version called &quot;100% Question&quot; and in Italy with the same name of the original format.

<text>Donnington is a village in the civil parish of Shaw-cum-Donnington in West Berkshire, England. It is located north of the town of Newbury. It contains a ruined medieval castle and a Strawberry Hill Gothic mansion.

==Notable buildings==
===Castle===

Donnington Castle, a ruined medieval castle of some historical significance, was the home of Richard Abberbury the Elder. The second Battle of Newbury (27 October 1644) was fought between Newbury and Donnington as an attack on the castle, which was held for the Royalists by Sir John Boys. The main entrance range of Donnington Castle House was built in 1648 to incorporate an earlier lodge.

===Hospital almshouses===

Donnington Hospital almshouses, founded in 1393, form the oldest charity in the county, although others formed later had older charities merged into them. Robert Beaugraunt is recorded as minister of the poor in 1412. The earliest current building dates from 1602, but the complex is wide-ranging, with additional modern almshouses having been built in Bucklebury and Iffley.

===Others===
Other notable buildings include Donnington Priory and Donnington Grove. The latter is a Strawberry Hill Gothic mansion built by the antiquary and translator James Pettit Andrews in 1763–1772. It is now a hotel in the centre of a golf course.

==Transport==
Donnington has regular bus services to Newbury.

==Famous residents==

*Richard Abberbury the Elder (1331–1399), chamberlain to Anne of Bohemia, Queen to King Richard II of England, owned estates in Donnington.
*Albemarle Bertie (1755–1824), Royal Navy officer and later Admiral during the American Revolutionary War and Napoleonic Wars, retired to Donnington Priory.
*Beau Brummell (1778–1840), Regency dandy, lived at Donnington Grove.
*Sebastian Faulks (born 1953), journalist and author, was born in the village.
*Thomas Hughes (1822–1896), author of &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot;, lived at Donnington Priory.
*Barbara Euphan Todd (1890–1976), author of the Worzel Gummidge series of stories for children, died at Donnington.

<text>Szolnok (; also known by alternative names) is the county seat of Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok county in central Hungary. A city with county rights, it is located on the banks of the Tisza river, in the heart of the Great Hungarian Plain, which has made it an important cultural and economic crossroads for centuries. Szolnok also has one of Hungary’s best water polo teams.

==Name and etymology==
Szolnok was named after the first steward of the city, Szaunik or Zounok. The town was first officially mentioned under the name Zounok in 1075. In the following centuries, it was recorded variously as Zounok, Saunic, Zounuc, and Zawnuch. The variety of spellings likely comes from phonetic discrepancies occurring when Hungarian sounds were recorded using the Latin alphabet. Another possibility revolves around speculation that the name Szaunik was not a personal name after all, but rather a title relating to the significant salt trade (salt, ) in the area.

In most other languages, the city&#x27;s Hungarian name is used without derivation (for example , ). The city has its own name in a few languages (for example , , ), deriving from these languages&#x27; historical relationship to the city.

==Location and physical geography==
Szolnok is located in the heart of the Great Hungarian Plain, at the confluence of the Tisza and Zagyva rivers. It lies about east-southeast from Budapest. The climate of the area is continental, with hot summers following relatively mild winters. The region is one of the sunniest in Europe; the average precipitation is about annually.

===Climate===

The annual average temperature of Szolnok is , and the warmest July has an average temperature of , while January is the only month below freezing, with an average temperature of . The annual precipitation is , of which January is the month with the least precipitation at , while June is the month with the most precipitation at . Temperature extremes ranged from on January 13, 2003 to on July 20, 2007.
==History==

===Earliest settlement===
The area was first settled in the Paleolithic era. The first known inhabitants lived in temporary tent-like structures made from reeds, or in more permanent dwellings made of hides draped over wooden poles. They were hunters of mammoth, reindeer, deer, and boar. Archeologists have also found stone tools from this era, some made of flint.

Fishing equipment such as hooks and weights from nets, dating from the Neolithic era, shows the increasing importance of fishing in the peoples&#x27; lives. These were usually made from clay, as were ritual statues of gods, bulls, and stylized women. In Szandaszőlős, a suburb of Szolnok, a permanent Neolithic era settlement was discovered.

By the Mesolithic era, the inhabitants of the area had settled into permanent villages, where they practiced agriculture and animal husbandry. Reconstructions of these settlements can be seen in Szolnok&#x27;s Damjanich János Museum. The houses of this era were largely made of wood. They utilized carts for transporting goods and large earthenware granaries for storing grain.

In the Bronze Age, new people arrived in the Carpathian Basin. In Tószeg, a neighbor of Szolnok, a large settlement was established, with houses built with thick adobe walls. The villagers kept horses, pigs, and sheep, as well as collecting clams from the river. Certain artifacts have been found, such as bronze tools, swords, and shells, which suggest long-distance trade.

The Romans were not able to establish permanent settlements on the Alföld (modern-day eastern Hungary), so in the time before the arrival of the Hungarians in 896, the area was populated by Scythians, Celts, and Sarmatians. A number of artifacts have been found from the Scythian era in Szolnok and in the area surrounding it. During the building of the Zagyva River dikes, remnants of a Scythian settlement were found, including iron pots and other pottery.

The Celts followed the Scythians. Artifacts from the Celtic era include mostly weapons, including iron swords and shields, as well as saddlery and other iron components. Subsequently, the Sarmatians, who originated in Iran, settled in the surrounding area. The Sarmatian people were in contact with the Roman Empire, sometimes by war and sometimes by trade. Roman money, weapons, jewelry and pottery are often found; when Szolnok&#x27;s military airport was enlarged in 1952, over two hundred Gepid and Sarmatian graves were uncovered, which contained rich treasures: gold-plated and decorated fibulas, iron weapons, bone combs, belt buckles, and pots. After the Sarmatians, Germanic-speaking peoples took possession of the area.

In Ó-Szanda, a district of Szolnok suburb Szandaszőlős, archeologists discovered a rich trove of artifacts left by the Gepids, who lived in the area in the 4th and 5th centuries. The Gepids were familiar with glass-making and wore heavy beads made from colored glass. After the Gepids, the area was populated by Avars. Like the Hungarian tribes who came later, the Avars were buried with their horses; a number of these graves have been unearthed. The remains discovered from the time of their rule indicates that the Avars first appeared in the middle of the 6th century. The burial grounds found at Rákóczifalva, some from Szandaszőlős, show that a large permanent settlement once existed there.

It was an important distribution site of salt from Transylvanian region.

===Middle Ages===
Szolnok was first mentioned, under the name Zounok, in a letter from Géza I concerning the foundation of the monastery at Garamszentbenedek in 1075. It was named for the first steward of the city, Szaunik or Zounok. In the following centuries it was recorded as Zounok, Saunic, Zounuc, and Zawnuch. The variety of spellings likely comes from phonetic discrepancies occurring when Hungarian sounds - originally written in runic Old Hungarian script - were recorded using the Latin alphabet.

Under the rule of the Árpád Dynasty, Szolnok was a market town and the center of Szolnok County. When King István ordered a church built in every tenth village, one was built in Szolnok. The 11th century saw great improvements in the city due to the Tisza river ferry, customs house, and county business. There was great trade and commerce via both the Tisza and the overland roads that ran through Szolnok. Despite this, Szolnok remained a market town through the Middle Ages, without expanding to a city. The Szolnok Castle was, in these times, only an earthworks fort, although later a wooden wall was added.

During the Mongol invasion of Hungary in 1241 the town was destroyed; it was re-populated under King Béla IV but even by the end of the 14th century it was still considered a village. King Zsigmond of Luxemburg, in an effort to develop the town, freed Szolnok from certain taxes in 1422, and from customs in 1429. After this, the town slowly began to grow and prosper again.

===In Ottoman Hungary===
Due to Szolnok&#x27;s geographical centrality, Szolnok Castle played an important role in the border castle system of 16th century Hungary. After the Ottoman armies captured Temesvár and occupied the Danube-Tisza-Maros River area, only two forces of any significance stood between them and the rest of Hungary: Szolnok, and Eger to the north. Beginning in June 1552, Hungarian, Transylvanian, and Viennese agents all began reporting that the Ottoman army was on the move out of Temesvár towards Szolnok and Eger. The task of capturing the two was given to Ali Pasha of Buda. After the fall of other minor fortifications on the Puszta, Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent ordered Pashas Ahmed, Ali, and Mohamed to lead their armies against the castles.

It was in light of this Turkish danger that in 1550-51 Ferdinand I ordered the Szolnok earthworks to be improved with a new town wall (partially planned by István Dobó), the castle to be fortified, and Lőrinc Nyáry put in command. Under his command were 1400 soldiers, mostly Spanish, German, Czech, with a small number of Hungarians. The castle was armed with 24 cannons, 3000 muskets, 800 weights of gunpowder, and was well-stocked with food and supplies.

Further works began in summer of 1552 and progressed rapidly. In order to surround the castle, a new branch of the Zagyva river was dug. This new branch is the one that remains today, at the point where the Zagyva flows into the Tisza river. The original course of the Zagyva has today been filled in, but a small part of it remains as the lake in front of the Szolnok MÁV Hospital.

On September 2, 1552, Pasha Ahmed Ali besieged the castle with his army of 40,000. Although it was the German mercenaries who first entertained thoughts of escape, it was the Hungarian boatmen who deserted first. On the night of September 3, the Hungarian and Spanish horsemen swam across the Tisza, then the boatmen returned for the foot soldiers. On the night of September 4, the mercenaries deserted, leaving the castle to its fate. After they departed the front gate was left open until morning, leading to the easy overpowering and capture of Lőrinc Nyáry and the fifty remaining brave men.

István Mekcsey, one of the defenders of the Siege of Eger, wrote the following to his sister four days before the Turkish advance forces reached Eger: &quot;I can&#x27;t write more... but to say that every day now we feel we are awaiting a great punishment since the traitors gave up Szolnok.&quot; Ahmed and Mohamed left a garrison of 2,000 soldiers in Szolnok while they marched against Eger.

The Ottoman occupation of Szolnok lasted from 1552 to 1685. In 1553, they established the sanjak of Szolnok, and in the following years built a mosque, baths, and a minaret; during the course of later battles these were destroyed, mostly deliberately. Of the minaret the base remained, and this was made into a stylized fountain which remains today. In 1562, they constructed the first permanent bridge spanning the Tisza. The remains of the so-called Szolnok Turkish-era Bridge () again came to light in August 2003 after a summer of drought. The only Turkish codex made in Hungary was copied in Szolnok; it describes the campaigns of Suleiman in Hungary. Pottery and tools from the Turkish era can be seen today in Szolnok&#x27;s Damjanich János Museum.

===Post-Ottoman Szolnok===

In 1685, Szolnok was liberated from the Ottomans by the Habsburg armies under the control of Generals Heister and Mercy; during the liberation both the city and the castle were significantly damaged. Due to Szolnok castle&#x27;s strategic importance, it was rebuilt by commander Antonio Caraffa.

In 1697, Imre Thököly burned down the castle. The events of the Rákóczi Uprising in 1703 and 1706 reached Szolnok and the city was again razed to the ground. In 1706, Ferenc Deák, one of Rákóczi&#x27;s leaders, burned the Szolnok castle so that Imperial forces couldn&#x27;t use it, so Imperial General Rabutin had the stones all taken away. In 1710, forces loyal to Rákóczi took over the castle, but on October 10, they abandoned it to the advancing army of Imperial General Jacob Joseph Cusani. After the Uprising, the castle finally fell to pieces and the stones were carted away.

In the years after, the city of Szolnok fared little better than the castle; it was hit by disaster after disaster, including a massive storm in 1739 which devastated the city. During the storm a fire broke out which, aided by the storm winds, grew and engulfed the majority of the town. The only buildings which were spared were those which were isolated from the town center.

Szolnok started to prosper again in the second half of the 18th century. Control of the river Tisza and steamship traffic increased the town&#x27;s importance. From 1847 Szolnok was connected to Pest by railway.

Its citizens took part in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 in 1848-49. In the Battle of Szolnok, the Austrians were defeated by the armies of General János Damjanich.

After the Ausgleich, the population and importance of Szolnok grew. In 1876, Szolnok became capital of the comitatus again. By 1879, it already had 16,001 residents.

===20th century===
Szolnok saw action in the First World War in May 1919 when a long and bitter battle raged along the Tisza between the advancing Romanian army and the Hungarian Red Army. Romanian troops caused terrible damage to the area as the front stagnated here for 77 days. After the defeat of the Red Army in July 1919 in the Tiszántúl (the regions east of Szolnok), the Romanians crossed the Tisza and occupied the city. The occupation lasted until February 25, 1920. The railroad bridge, which had been destroyed during the battle, was finally reconstructed in 1923.

In 1930, the city had 38,764 inhabitants. Several higher level educational institutions existed, including boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; grammar schools, a scientific secondary school, trade schools for boys and girls both, lumber- and metal-works vocational school, and a midwifery training institute.
The interwar period saw a surge in industry, including factories for weights, mirrors, furniture, vinegar spirits, rum, and liquor, ice, cotton wool, bricks, sugar; smelting furnace and metalworks factory; machinery factory and iron foundry; two electrical distribution systems; four lumber mills; and four steam mills.

In the interwar period, most of the damage done to the city had been successfully repaired. During World War II, Szolnok was bombed twelve times, mostly by American troops, which caused serious damage to the buildings and the population. In the so-called &quot;Frantic&quot; attack (June 2 - September 19, 1944) a wave of 600 fighter planes bombed Debrecen; the right wing also bombed Nagyvárad (now Oradea), Kolozsvár (now Cluj Napoca), Szeged, and Balmazújváros, and the left wing Szolnok and Miskolc. Szolnok suffered great damaged under these attacks and many people died. The train station of Szolnok was bombed several times, by both British and American fighters.

During 1944, it became the location of a &quot;labor camp&quot; and a concentration point for Hungarian Jews being deported to Mauthausen in Austria. It was critical to the success of the Hungarian Jews roundup and deportion.

By the end of the war, the majority of the population had fled; the Soviet troops of the 2nd Ukrainian Front found only a couple thousand people when they entered the decimated city on 4 November 1944, in the course of the Budapest Offensive.

During the Socialist era, Szolnok began to recover with Soviet aid. Factories were built, and touristic importance grew when a thermal bath was opened.

Szolnok was granted the rank of city with county rights on November 13, 1990.

==Demographics==
In 2001, the population of Szolnok consisted of 98% Hungarian, 1% Gypsy, and 1% people of other nationalities (mainly German).

Szolnok&#x27;s population reached its highest level in 1989 with almost 82,000 people. Since then it has been slowly but steadily declining.

<doc id="1017723" wikidata="Q4710331" url="?curid=1017723" title="Albert Goodwin">
<text>Albert&quot;Ginger&quot;Goodwin (May 10, 1887–July 27, 1918), nicknamed Ginger for his bright red hair, was a migrant coal miner who advocated for workers&#x27; rights and promoted the cause of unions in British Columbia, Canada. Angered by the working conditions in coal mines, Goodwin sought to increase wages and improve working conditions, and fought companies that disregarded workers&#x27; rights. He participated in and led multiple strikes, and served as a delegate for the British Columbia Federation of Labour and as an organizer for the Socialist Party of Canada. In the years following his increased activism and involvement with labour unions, Goodwin fell under scrutiny for his opposition to military conscription during World War I. He was killed by a police officer in 1918. There is debate on whether Goodwin was a victim of murder or if his death was the result of the officer&#x27;s self-defence. His death sparked a one-day general strike in Vancouver on August 2, 1918, which was the first general strike ever held in Canada. The strike was a precursor of the Winnipeg general strike of 1919 and other labour conflicts.

==Early life and radicalization==
Goodwin was born in Treeton, Yorkshire, England on May 10, 1887. In 1906 at age 19, he emigrated to Canada to work as a coal miner in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia. In 1911, he relocated to Vancouver Island, where he worked for the Canadian Collieries mining company in Cumberland, British Columbia.

While in Cumberland, Goodwin&#x27;s participation in labour activism began, joining the Socialist Party of Canada and becoming an active member of the Cumberland Local 2299 union. During the 1912–1914 Coal Miners&#x27; Strike against Canadian Collieries, Goodwin became a key activist, speaking out against working conditions and advocating for mine safety and union recognition. While the workers did not win, the strike nevertheless had a major political and economic impact on the country, leading to recognition of the strikers&#x27; demands. Following the strike, Goodwin emerged as a dedicated socialist and union activist. However, as a result of his involvement in the strike, he found himself blacklisted from his workplace and was forced to leave Cumberland.

==Labour activism==
In 1916, Goodwin moved to Trail, British Columbia, where he worked in the smelter for the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada Limited. That same year, he joined the Mining and Smelter Workers&#x27; Union where he was elected as Secretary for the Trail chapter. Following his union involvement, Goodwin entered politics, running as a candidate for the Socialist Party of Canada in the 1916 provincial election representing Trail. Although he did not win, Goodwin carried on with his union activity. The following year, he was elected to the executive of the British Columbia Federation of Labour as Vice-President, and as the President of District 6 (Kootenays) of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers.

Goodwin frequently spoke out against Canada&#x27;s involvement in World War I as a conscientious objector. He rejected conscription on the grounds that workers of one country should not be employed to kill workers of another country as a result of capitalist conflict. Goodwin is reputed to have said, &quot;War is simply part of the process of Capitalism. Big financial interests are playing the game. They&#x27;ll reap the victory, no matter how the war ends.&quot;

Goodwin eventually did sign up, but was initially exempted from conscription after a medical examination found him unfit for service. Following the exemption, Goodwin called a strike on November 10, 1917, at the Trail smelter in an attempt to get the company to agree to an eight-hour work day. As the strike continued, Goodwin was recalled for another medical examination, whereupon he was ordered to report for duty for overseas, overturning the decision previously made.

== Death ==
After being reinstated for conscription, Goodwin attempted to appeal the assignment, but was denied multiple times. He returned to Cumberland once more to prepare a final appeal. After returning to Vancouver Island, Goodwin and other draft evaders fled to the Cumberland hills sometime in April or May 1918, hiding out in the mountains around Comox Lake. By breaking into a cabin, they were able to survive with supplies provided by friends and community members.
On July 27, 1918, Dominion Police ventured into the hills to locate and arrest the men. On that day, Dominion Police Officer Dan Campbell encountered Goodwin in the woods at Comox Lake and shot him with a .30-30-calibre lever-action hunting rifle. Campbell claimed that the shot was fired in self-defence after Goodwin raised his own rifle when he was asked to surrender.

It remains unknown how the two men actually encountered each other since there were no other witnesses. There is debate on whether Campbell fired in self-defence or if he shot Goodwin deliberately, acting under special military orders. Goodwin died instantly after being shot in the neck, with the bullet severing his spinal cord on impact.

Local undertakers refused a police request to bury Goodwin on the spot where he was shot, and also refused to retrieve his body for authorities. His body was retrieved by friends and brought to Cumberland, where it was taken through the streets in a mile-long procession. Goodwin was interred at the Cumberland Municipal Cemetery, with thousands attending his funeral on August 2, 1918.

Campbell was charged with manslaughter following Goodwin&#x27;s death. A grand jury in Victoria, British Columbia dismissed the charges against the policeman, who continued to claim that he had fired in self-defence. Despite the jury&#x27;s decision, police officers and two justices of the peace believed there was enough evidence to warrant a further proceeding.

There are conflicting opinions on the actual date of Goodwin&#x27;s death. While many sources date the death on July 27, others including his headstone state he died on July 26, 1918.

==Legacy==
Goodwin&#x27;s death outraged the BC labour movement. In protest, the Vancouver General Strike was held on August 2, 1918, the first of its kind in Canada. The Metal and Trades Council was the first to call for the 24-hour work stoppage, with the Vancouver Trades and Labour Council and other manual labourers following its lead.

At Comox Lake, Goodwin was commemorated by the naming of Ginger Goodwin Creek in 1982, and Mount Ginger Goodwin in 1989. A section of the Vancouver Island Highway 19 that passes through Cumberland was named Ginger Goodwin Way in 1996. Although the signs were removed by the province&#x27;s Liberal government in 2001, the NDP government reinstalled them in 2018.

On July 27, 2018, the BC government proclaimed Ginger Goodwin Day to acknowledge his work as a champion of labour rights. The centennial day of his death was also marked by widespread recognition of his achievement.
 Goodwin&#x27;s legacy was revived in Cumberland with Miners&#x27; Memorial Day in 1986. Organized by the Cumberland Museum and Archives, the annual event celebrates Cumberland&#x27;s miners, including the 295 miners who died in accidents over the decades. A vigil is held every year during Miners&#x27; Memorial weekend, with people placing flowers on Goodwin&#x27;s grave.

In 2015, the film, &quot;Goodwin&#x27;s Way&quot;, debuted. The film documents the town of Cumberland resisting the opening of a new mine and resurrecting the legacy of Ginger Goodwin. Residents share their viewpoints on the life story of the labour hero.

== Quotes ==
&quot;...we know that all this misery is the outcome of someone&#x27;s carelessness and that someone is the capitalists, those who own the machinery of production... This class of parasites have been living on the blood of the working class, they are responsible for the conditions existing at the present time... To throw this system over we have got to organize as a class and fight them as class against class... and our weapons are education, organization and agitation... and the principles of Socialism, for it is necessary that you know when to strike and how to strike, and if we have not these weapons when the time comes, we shall not be able to predict the outcome of the fight... we have the power and the lever to overthrow the existing society.&quot;

<doc id="1017724" wikidata="Q500563" url="?curid=1017724" title="Middle meningeal artery">
<text>The middle meningeal artery (&quot;&quot;) is typically the third branch of the first portion of the maxillary artery. After branching off the maxillary artery in the infratemporal fossa, it runs through the foramen spinosum to supply the dura mater (the outer meningeal layer) and the calvaria. The middle meningeal artery is the largest of the three (paired) arteries that supply the meninges, the others being the anterior meningeal artery and the posterior meningeal artery.

The anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery runs beneath the pterion. It is vulnerable to injury at this point, where the skull is thin. Rupture of the artery may give rise to an epidural hematoma. In the dry cranium, the middle meningeal, which runs within the dura mater surrounding the brain, makes a deep groove in the calvarium.

The middle meningeal artery is intimately associated with the auriculotemporal nerve, which wraps around the artery making the two easily identifiable in the dissection of human cadavers and also easily damaged in surgery.

==Structure==
It ascends between the sphenomandibular ligament and the lateral pterygoid muscle, and between the two roots of the auriculotemporal nerve to the foramen spinosum of the sphenoid bone, through which it enters the cranium; it then runs forward in a groove on the great wing of the sphenoid bone, and divides into two branches, anterior and posterior.

The &quot;anterior branch&quot;, the larger, crosses the great wing of the sphenoid, reaches the groove, or canal, in the sphenoidal angle of the parietal bone, and then divides into branches that spread out between the dura mater and internal surface of the cranium, some passing upward as far as the vertex, and others backward to the occipital region.

The &quot;posterior branch&quot; curves backward on the squamous part of the temporal bone, and, reaching the parietal bone some distance in front of its mastoid angle, divides into branches that supply the posterior part of the dura mater and cranium.

The branches of the middle meningeal artery are distributed partly to the dura mater, but chiefly to the bones; they anastomose with the arteries of the opposite side, and with the anterior and posterior meningeal arteries. The very smallest distal branches anastomose through the skull with small arterioles from the scalp.

On entering the cranium, the middle meningeal artery gives off the following branches: 
# Numerous small vessels supply the trigeminal ganglion and the dura mater
# A superficial petrosal branch enters the hiatus of the facial canal, supplies the facial nerve, and anastomoses with the stylomastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery. 
# A superior tympanic artery runs in the canal of the tensor tympani muscle, and supplies this muscle and the lining of the canal. 
# Orbital branches pass through the superior orbital fissure or through separate canals in the great wing of the sphenoid, to anastomose with the lacrimal or other branches of the ophthalmic artery. 
# Temporal branches pass through foramina in the great wing of the sphenoid, and anastomose in the temporal fossa with the deep temporal arteries.

===Variation===
In approximately half of subjects, it branches into an accessory meningeal artery.

Very rarely, the ophthalmic artery may arise as a branch of the middle meningeal artery.

The middle meningeal artery may arise not only from the maxillary artery but also from the ophthalmic artery, or lacrimal artery.

==Clinical relevance==
An injured middle meningeal artery is the most common cause of an epidural hematoma. A head injury (e.g., from a road traffic accident or sports injury) is required to rupture the artery. Emergency treatment requires decompression of the hematoma, usually by craniotomy. Subdural bleeding is usually &quot;venous&quot; in nature, rather than arterial. Nevertheless, embolization of the middle meningeal artery (as a supplementary treatment to craniotomy) significantly reduces the likelihood of recurrence and reoperation for subdural hematomas, as the artery supplies blood to the vascularized membrane around the hematoma that leaks blood and prevents its resorption.

The middle meningeal artery runs in a groove on the inside of the cranium. This can clearly be seen on a lateral skull X-ray, where it may be mistaken for a fracture of the skull. On a dry specimen, the groove is easy to see. This means that the artery is easy to study, even in specimens centuries old, and several classifications of the branches have been proposed, e.g. Adachi&#x27;s classification of 1928.

<doc id="1017726" wikidata="Q187821" url="?curid=1017726" title="Tatabánya">
<text>Tatabánya (; ; ) is a city with county rights of 64,305 inhabitants in northwestern Hungary, in the Central Transdanubian region. It is the capital of Komárom-Esztergom County.

==Location==
The city is located in the valley between the Gerecse and Vértes Mountains, some from the capital. By virtue of its location, the city is a railway and road junction. The M1 (also European routes E60, E75) motorway from Vienna to Budapest passes through the outer city limits, and the Vienna-Budapest railway line also passes through the city.

==History==

Archaeological findings prove that humans have been living here since the Stone Age. The three historic predecessor settlements of Tatabánya are Alsógalla, Felsőgalla, and Bánhida. Bánhida is the earliest settlement, it was first mentioned in 1288.

In the 16th century, the Ottoman Turks occupied the area. Around this time, the inhabitants became Protestants. Later, its feudal lords, the Esterházys populated the area with Roman Catholic German and Slovak settlers.

According to the 1787 census, Alsógalla had 580 and Felsőgalla had 842 inhabitants. The coal resources of the area were discovered around this time. The population began to grow, and a new mining colony was formed, later developing into the village of Tatabánya. 

During the industrialization wave that took over the country after World War II, several Hungarian towns developed into large industrial cities. The four villages were united on October 1, 1947, under the name Tatabánya and it was elevated to town status. In 1950, it became the county capital of Komárom-Esztergom county (then called Komárom county.) By the 1980s, it had more than 80,000 inhabitants. 

The industrial character of the city was significant until the fall of the Socialist government and the following political changes of 1989. After that, the importance of heavy industry and mining decreased and the economic structure of the city has changed remarkably. 

==Infrastructure==

According to the 2001 census, Tatabánya had 28,912 households and 92% of them had central heating and telephone access. Almost all households have access to the cable TV network. 98% of the city roads are paved, mass transport is well organized.
T-Busz provides local bus services and KNYKK provides the regional bus services.

==Education==

Until the mid-20th century, educational standards in the city were average, but in the second half of the century they deteriorated to below average, mostly because the local mines did not require their employees to have a high level of education. By the end of the 20th century, this trend had reversed again. The city currently has two colleges, ten secondary schools, 16 primary schools, 18 kindergartens, and five crèches.

==Culture and sports==
The most important cultural institution is the Mari Jászai Theatre. The city has several other institutions, including museums and libraries.

Tatabánya has a football team called FC Tatabánya, founded in 1910. The town also has a successful handball team, Tatabánya KC.

One of Tatabánya&#x27;s most prominent residents is József Kiprich, formally known as &quot;the Wizard from Tatabánya&quot;. He became the top goalscorer in the Hungarian League in 1985, scoring 18 goals in 26 matches. In total, he played nine seasons at Tatabánya before making the move to the Netherlands. He had just played his first match in his 10th season at Tatabánya when Feyenoord of Rotterdam got interested in signing him. Kiprich didn&#x27;t hesitate and signed a contract and left Tatabánya for Rotterdam. He is also one of Hungary&#x27;s top goal scorers. In eleven seasons of football with the Hungarian national team, &quot;the Wizard&quot; managed to score 28 goals in 70 appearances.

==Sights==
The Turul monument, above the city on the top of Gerecse Mountain, is the largest bird statue in Central Europe.

The Szelim cave and the forest park of Gerecse Mountain are local tourist attractions.

<text>The Vanguard Nationalist and Socialist Party was a minor political party in the Bahamas in the 1970s and 1980s.

The party was founded in 1971 by a group belonging to the youth organization of Progressive Liberal Party who were inspired by the Black Panther Party in the United States. In the 1977 elections it put up five candidates, but received only 55 votes and failed to win a seat. John T. McCartney became party president in 1979, and whilst it improved its performance in the 1982 elections, with 18 candidates receiving 181 votes, it still failed to win a seat. The last election contested by the party was the a by-election in St. Barnabas constituency in 1987, which was not contested by the official opposition Free National Movement. The party&#x27;s candidate was its then-leader, Lionel Carey. Carey came bottom in the poll, below the Workers&#x27; Party.

The party was never taken seriously by most Bahamian voters, a fact reflected in their abysmal vote totals. Every single candidate that ever ran on behalf of the party lost their deposit (their 1982 manifesto called for its elimination). Members addressed each other as &#x27;comrade&#x27;, which was also lampooned.

<text>Robert William Stanley (born November 10, 1954) is an American former professional baseball relief pitcher who spent his entire Major League Baseball (MLB) career with the Boston Red Sox. He was later the pitching coach for the Buffalo Bisons, Triple-A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays, through the 2018 season.

==Early life==
Stanley attended Kearny High School in Kearny, New Jersey, where he earned all-state honors as a pitcher-shortstop; he came within three outs of pitching a perfect game in May 1973 against Bloomfield High School.

==Playing career==
Stanley was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the ninth round of the June 1973 MLB draft, but did not sign with the team, choosing instead to attend college. During this era, another draft was held in the winter; Stanley was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the first round of the January 1974 secondary draft, and this time elected to sign. He began his professional career with the Elmira Pioneers in , spent with the Winter Haven Red Sox, and advanced to the Bristol Red Sox at the Double-A level in . Stanley made his major league debut with the Red Sox on April 16, .

Stanley was named an All-Star in , a year in which he pitched in 40 games (30 starts). He won 16 games and lost 12, with an earned run average (ERA) of 3.99. Following two more seasons of mixed usage, Stanley was deployed as a full-time relief pitcher in 1982, maintaining a 3.10 ERA over innings pitched. As of the beginning of the 2022 season, this remains the American League record for innings pitched by a relief pitcher. While he was not named to the All-Star team, Stanley was recognized with down-ballot votes for the Cy Young and Most Valuable Player awards. He was named to his second All-Star team the following season, , appearing in 64 games and pitching innings, while recording 33 saves and a 2.85 ERA, and he remained a fixture of the Red Sox bullpen in the years which followed.

Stanley was a key member of the 1986 Red Sox team that came within one strike of winning the World Series but ultimately fell to the New York Mets in seven games. Stanley entered Game 6 with the Red Sox one out away from clinching their first World Series since 1918, holding a one-run lead with runners on first and third. Stanley threw a wild pitch to Mookie Wilson which allowed Kevin Mitchell to score the tying run and Ray Knight to move to second base, putting him in position to score the winning run on Bill Buckner&#x27;s fielding error. Stanley and the Red Sox returned to Shea Stadium for Game 7, which the New York Mets won by a score of 8–5.

In , Stanley was converted to a regular starting pitcher for the first time since 1979, compiling a 4–15 record with 67 strikeouts and a 5.01 ERA. After returning to the bullpen to pitch two more seasons as a reliever, Stanley announced his retirement on September 25, . In a 13-year career spent entirely with the Red Sox, he compiled a 115–97 win–loss record with 693 strikeouts, a 3.64 ERA, 21 complete games, seven shutouts, 132 saves, and 1707 innings pitched in 637 games (85 as a starter).

A sinker ball specialist, Stanley is the Red Sox all-time leader in appearances and relief wins, and was inducted to the Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2000. Stanley was also the team&#x27;s all-time saves leader, a record he held for 20 years, until Jonathan Papelbon tied him on June 29, 2009, and then passed him on July 1, 2009. Stanley is the first, and to date only, player born in Maine to be named to an MLB All-Star Game.

==Coaching career==
Prior to joining the Blue Jays, Stanley served as a minor league pitching coach in the New York Mets&#x27; and San Francisco Giants&#x27; organizations, including service with the Connecticut Defenders, the Giants&#x27; Double-A Eastern League affiliate.

On December 23, 2011, Stanley was announced as the pitching coach for the Blue Jays&#x27; Triple-A affiliate, the Las Vegas 51s. 
On January 7, 2013, Toronto announced that Stanley would be the pitching coach for their new Triple-A farm club, the Buffalo Bisons.

Almost a year later, on January 4, 2014, the Blue Jays announced that Stanley would be replacing Pat Hentgen as their bullpen coach. On December 19, Stanley was named the pitching coach for the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats. On January 19, 2016, Stanley was announced as returning to the Buffalo Bisons. Stanley was confirmed to return for a third season as the Bisons&#x27; pitching coach on January 19, 2017.

==Personal==
During his career, Stanley earned the nicknames &quot;the Steamer&quot; and &quot;Bigfoot.&quot; He lives in the Seacoast region of southern New Hampshire. On April 4, 2011, he was named President of the Seacoast Mavericks of the Futures Collegiate Baseball League (FCBL). On June 10, 2011, Stanley threw out the first pitch to inaugurate the Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Sharks of the FCBL.

<text>Spinal tumors are neoplasms located in either the vertebral column or the spinal cord. There are three main types of spinal tumors classified based on their location: extradural and intradural (intradural-intramedullary and intradural-extramedullary). Extradural tumors are located outside the dura mater lining and are most commonly metastatic. Intradural tumors are located inside the dura mater lining and are further subdivided into intramedullary and extramedullary tumors. Intradural-intramedullary tumors are located within the dura and spinal cord parenchyma, while intradural-extramedullary tumors are located within the dura but outside the spinal cord parenchyma. The most common presenting symptom of spinal tumors is nocturnal back pain. Other common symptoms include muscle weakness, sensory loss, and difficulty walking. Loss of bowel and bladder control may occur during the later stages of the disease.

The cause of spinal tumors is unknown. Most extradural tumors are metastatic commonly from breast, prostate, lung, and kidney cancer. There are many genetic factors associated with intradural tumors, most commonly neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), and Von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) syndrome. The most common type of intradural-extramedullary tumors are meningiomas and nerve-sheath tumors. The most common type of intradural-intramedullary tumors are ependymomas and astrocytomas. Diagnosis involves a complete medical evaluation followed by imaging with a CT or MRI. A biopsy may be obtained in certain cases to categorize the lesion if the diagnosis is uncertain.

Treatment often involves some combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Observation with follow-up imaging may be an option for small, benign lesions. Steroids may also be given before surgery in cases of significant cord compression. Outcomes depend on a number of factors including whether the tumor is benign or malignant, primary or metastatic, and location of the tumor. Treatment is often palliative for the vast majority of metastatic tumors.

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of spinal tumors are often non-specific, resulting in a delay in diagnosis. Spinal nerve compression and weakening of the vertebral structure cause the symptoms. Pain is the most common symptom at presentation. Other common symptoms of spinal cord compression include muscle weakness, sensory loss, numbness in hands and legs, and rapid onset paralysis. Bowel or bladder incontinence often occur in the later stages of the disease. Children may present with spinal deformities such as scoliosis. The diagnosis is challenging, primarily because symptoms often mimic more common and benign degenerative spinal diseases.

Spinal cord compression is commonly found in patients with metastatic malignancy. Back pain is a primary symptom of spinal cord compression in patients with known malignancy. Back pain may prompt a bone scan to confirm or exclude spinal metastasis. Rapid identification and intervention of metastatic spinal cord compression is necessary to preserve neurologic function.

== Causes ==
The cause of the majority of spinal tumors is currently not known. Primary spinal tumors are associated with a few genetic syndromes. Neurofibromas are associated with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). Meningiomas and schwannomas are associated with neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2). Intramedullary hemangioblastomas can be seen in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Spinal cord lymphomas are commonly seen in patients with suppressed immune systems. The majority of extradural tumors are due to metastasis, most commonly from breast, prostate, lung, and kidney cancer.

==Pathophysiology==
The spinal cord is a long, cylindrical anatomical structure that is located within the vertebral cavity. It runs from the foramen magnum of the skull to the conus medullaris at the lumbar spine. Most symptoms from spinal tumors occur due to compression of the spinal cord as it plays a primary role in motor and sensory function. The spinal cord is surrounded by three layers known as the spinal meninges. These are the dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater. Spinal cord tumors are classified based on their location within the spinal cord: intradural (intradmedullary and extramedullary) and extradural tumors.

Intradural tumors are located within the dura mater. These are further broken down into intramedullary and extramedullary tumors. Intradural-intramedullary tumors are located within the spinal cord itself, with the most common being ependymomas, astrocytomas, and hemangioblastomas. Intradural-extramedullary tumors are located within the dura but outside of the spinal cord parenchyma, with the most common being meningiomas and nerve sheath tumors (e.g. schwannomas, neurofibromas). Extradural tumors are located outside the dura mater most commonly in the vertebral bodies from metastatic disease.

Common primary cancers in metastatic spinal tumors includes breast, prostate, lung, and kidney cancer. It is important to diagnose and promptly treat metastatic tumors as they can lead to long-term neurologic deficit from epidural spinal cord compression. Primary extradural tumors are rare and most arise from surrounding bony and soft tissue structures, including Ewing&#x27;s sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and vertebral hemangioblastomas.

==Diagnosis==
=== Medical examination ===
The diagnosis of spinal tumors is challenging, as the symptoms can be non-specific and often mimic more common and benign degenerative spinal diseases. A comprehensive medical examination is necessary to look for signs or symptoms that may point towards a more serious condition. This includes a complete neurological exam focusing on any motor or sensory deficits. Patients with either benign degenerative spinal disease or spinal tumors often present with back pain. A patient with radiculopathy or myelopathy raises suspicion for a more serious condition.

=== Imaging ===
Imaging is often the next step when the diagnosis is unclear or there is greater suspicion for a serious condition that may need immediate intervention. Common types of medical imaging include X-rays, computer tomography scan (CT), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), myelography, and bone scans. MRI is the imaging of choice for spinal tumors. The MRI protocol that is most frequently used includes T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences, including contrast enhanced T1-weighted sequences. Short-TI Inversion Recovery (STIR) is also commonly added to the MRI protocol for detecting spinal cord tumors. Myelography may be used as a substitute when the patient cannot undergo an MRI or it is unavailable. X-rays and CT are more commonly used to view the bony structures. They are less frequently used for spinal cord tumors, however, since they cannot reliably detect them. Bone scanning may be used as a supplementary imaging modality for tumors involving bony structures of the spine.

==Treatment==
Treatment greatly varies depending on the type of spinal cord tumors, goals of care, and prognosis. The primary forms of treatment include surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Steroids (e.g. corticosteroids) may be administered if there is evidence of spinal cord compression. These do not affect the tumor mass itself, but tend to reduce the inflammatory reaction around it and decrease the overall volume of the mass impinging on the spinal cord.

=== Surgery ===
Surgery has several indications depending on the type of tumor, which includes complete resection, decompression of the nerves, and stabilization. An attempt at total gross resection for a possible cure is an option for patients with primary spinal cord tumors. Extramedullary tumours are more amenable to resection than intramedullary tumours, and even possible to be operated through microendoscopic or pure endoscopic approaches. In patients with metastatic tumors, treatment is palliative with the goal of improving the patient&#x27;s quality of life. In these cases, indications for surgery include pain, stabilization, and spinal cord decompression.

=== Non-surgical treatment ===
Observation, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are possible options as an adjunct to surgery or for tumors not amenable to surgery. Intradural-extramedullary tumors are often benign, so observation with follow-up imaging is an option in cases where the lesions are small and the patient is asymptomatic. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be administered alone or in conjunction with surgery. The choice of chemotherapy or radiotherapy is a multidisciplinary process and depends on the histological grade, type of tumor, and amount of surgical resection achieved. In cases where radiotherapy is chosen, radiation is usually delivered to the involved segment in the spinal cord and the uninvolved segment above and below the involved segment.

The combination of minimally invasive surgery and radiation or chemotherapy is a new technique for treating spinal tumors. This treatment can be tailored to the particular tumor of the spine, either metastatic or primary. Some suggest that direct decompressive surgery combined with postoperative radiotherapy, provide better outcomes than treatment with radiotherapy alone for patients with spinal cord compression due to metastatic cancer.

<doc id="1017740" wikidata="Q7272610" url="?curid=1017740" title="Quirt">
<text>A quirt is a short whip associated with the Southwestern United States. It often has a braided leather lash.

The falls on a quirt is made of leather, usually cowhide. The core of the quirt can be a leather bag filled with lead shot; the main part including the handle is often made from braided rawhide, leather, or kangaroo hide and is usually somewhat stiff but flexible.

The old-style horse quirt is still carried by some Western horsemen, and this style of quirt is seen in the early Western cowboy films.

The quirt, due to its slow action, is not particularly effective as a riding aid for horses, though at times it has been used as a tool of punishment. Rather, it is an effective tool to slap or goad cattle from horseback.

In the &quot;vaquero&quot; tradition, a quirt with a long handle, known as a &quot;romal&quot;, was attached to the end of a closed set of reins. The &quot;romal&quot; was primarily used as a noisemaker to slap or goad cattle. (The handle made it too slow and of the wrong length for use on the horse.) This combination of &quot;romal&quot; and closed reins, today referred to as &quot;&quot;romal&quot; reins&quot; or &quot;&quot;romal&quot;-style reins&quot;, is seen primarily in the horse show ring in certain types of Western pleasure classes.

A quirt is still commonly used by horse-riding herdsmen of Mongolia. They can be highly individualized. Most are braided rawhide attached to a carved wooden handle or to a handle made from a segment of a stout tree branch. Others are only braided rawhide, with a loop at one end that serves as the lanyard.

Quirts were also used by some staff at residential schools to punish students. The severity of such beatings included broken skin on the bodies of First Nations children.

==In culture==
&quot;The Quirt&quot; is the title of a 1920 novel by B. M. Bower.

Quirt Evans is the name of John Wayne&#x27;s character in the 1947 film &quot;Angel and the Badman&quot;.

<doc id="1017743" wikidata="Q18015" url="?curid=1017743" title="Tennant Creek">
<text>Tennant Creek () is a town located in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is the seventh largest town in the Northern Territory, and is located on the Stuart Highway, just south of the intersection with the western terminus of the Barkly Highway. At the , Tennant Creek had a population of 3,080 people, of which 55% (1,707) identified themselves as Indigenous.

The town is approximately 1,000 kilometres south of the capital of the Northern Territory, Darwin, and 500 kilometres north of Alice Springs. It is named after a nearby watercourse of the same name, and is the hub of the sprawling Barkly Tableland – vast elevated plains of black soil with golden Mitchell grass, that cover more than 240,000 square kilometres. Tennant Creek is also near well-known attractions including the Devils Marbles, Mary Ann Dam, Battery Hill Mining Centre and the Nyinkka Nyunyu Culture Centre.

The Barkly Tableland runs east from Tennant Creek towards the Queensland border and is among the most important cattle grazing areas in the Northern Territory. Roughly the same size as the United Kingdom or New Zealand, the region consists largely of open grass plains and some of the world&#x27;s largest cattle stations. It runs as far south as Barrow Creek, past Elliott to the north and west into the Tanami Desert.

The region encompasses the junction of two great highways, the Barkly and the Stuart, also known as the Overlander and Explorer&#x27;s Ways. The Overlander&#x27;s Way (Barkly Highway) retraces the original route of early stockmen who drove their cattle from Queensland through the grazing lands in the Northern Territory.

==Geography ==

Tennant Creek is located in the middle of the Northern Territory, 376.5 metres above sea level. Average maximum temperatures range from 24 degrees to 38 degrees, with an average of 22 days per year exceeding 40 degrees. Minimum temperatures range from 12 degrees in winter to 25 degrees in the hotter months.

== Climate ==
Tennant Creek experiences a tropical semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSh&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;BShb/BShl&quot;), with a short, very hot wet season from December to February, and a long, hot dry season from March to November. Due to the length of the dry season, and very high evapotranspiration, the vegetation exhibits influences of a warm desert climate (Köppen: &quot;BWh,&quot; Trewartha: BWhb/BWhl). Tennant Creek gets 181.0 clear days annually, and its climate is comparable to Paraguay&#x27;s vast, sparsely populated Gran Chaco region.

The brief wet season is very hot, moderately rainy, and experiences higher humidity than the rest of the year. The prevailing winds are from the Arafura Sea, but the large size of the Northern Territory&#x27;s Top End reduces the amount of precipitation in communities further inland, such as Tennant Creek, and contributes to the season&#x27;s high amount of sunshine. The moderating influence of the ocean is greater during this season, as temperature swings are not as severe as the rest of the year. Extremes range from a minimum of 15.7 °C (60.3 °F) to a maximum of 45.6 °C (114.1 °F). Additionally, over 70% of Tennant Creek&#x27;s 494.7 mm (19.48 in) of annual precipitation occurs during this season, and contributes to being in the Tropical Thorn Woodlands biome under the Holdridge Life Zones classification. Occasionally, flooding can pose a major risk in the area, such as during January 2022, where one person drowned in floodwaters at Seven Mile Bridge, to the north of Tennant Creek.

The long dry season is characterised by warm to hot temperatures, little to no precipitation, very low relative humidity, and an abundance of sunshine. Due to the prevailing winds are from the east to south-east, Tennant Creek is rain shadowed by the Great Dividing Range, where most precipitation from the Coral and Tasman Seas is dropped on the windward slopes near the Pacific Ocean. During the midst of winter, nights are usually cool, averaging 12.7 °C (54.9 °F) in July, but the settlement has never experienced frost, only falling to 5.6 °C (42.1 °F) in June, placing Tennant Creek in Hardiness Zone 11. Due to the combination of warm to hot conditions and minimal precipitation, droughts and bushfires can occur.

===Built environment===
Tennant Creek has developed from its rough, tough droving and gold mining days into a modern town with shops and a supermarket, accommodation, bars, clubs and restaurants, a regional hospital, schools and banking facilities.

===Parks and gardens===

Mary Ann Dam is a popular recreation spot, easily accessible from town by road or bicycle track and popular for swimming, barbecues, picnics or bush walks. The area&#x27;s best known attraction, Karlu Karlu / Devils Marbles Conservation Reserve, is 100 kilometres south of Tennant Creek and is one of the Territory&#x27;s most photographed features. These huge granite boulders are scattered through a wide, shallow valley. The formations provide shelter to a variety of flora and fauna of the area and glow a rich red in the light of the early evening. Local Aboriginal mythology holds that the boulders are the eggs of the Rainbow Serpent. Visitors can take a self-guided walk from the car park. Bush camping facilities are available.

Another popular spot close to Tennant Creek is the Iytwelepenty / Davenport Ranges National Park, best explored by four-wheel-drive vehicle.

==History==

The Warumungu people have lived in the region surrounding Tennant Creek for thousands of years. The traditional name for the creek north of where the town is now located is Jurnkkurakurr, although it is now used to refer to the area of the township as well. The first European explorer to pass through the region was John McDouall Stuart in 1860, on his unsuccessful first attempt to cross the continent from south to north. He named a creek to the north of town after John Tennant, a financier of his expedition and a pastoralist from Port Lincoln, South Australia, in gratitude for the financial help Tennant had provided for Stuart&#x27;s expeditions across Australia.

The Australian Overland Telegraph Line, that once allowed electronic communication between southern Australian cities and London, was constructed in the 1870s and forged a corridor through the middle of the continent that the Explorer&#x27;s Way and Ghan train now travel. A temporary building for a telegraph repeater station was erected near the watercourse of Tennant Creek in 1872. Two years later, the solid stone buildings of the Tennant Creek Telegraph Station that remain on the site today, were completed by the occupants of the station. This is one of the four remaining original telegraph stations in Australia. Tennant Creek was the site of Australia&#x27;s last gold rush during the 1930s and at that time was the third-largest gold producer in Australia. The Tennant Creek Telegraph Station remained an isolated outpost until that time.

Gold was discovered in the ranges three miles north of the current town area in 1926 by J Smith Roberts In 1927 Charles Windley, a telegraph operator, found gold on what would become Tennant Creek&#x27;s first mine, The Great Northern. Australia&#x27;s last great Gold Rush did not commence, however, until after Frank Juppurla, a local Indigenous man, took gold to telegraph operator Woody Woodruffe in December 1932. The population quickly grew to about 600, 60 of whom were women and children. &quot;Battery Hill&quot;, overlooking the town of Tennant Creek, is the site of one of the last two operating ten-head stamp batteries, a Government owned ore crushing machine.

The town of Tennant Creek was located 12 km south of the watercourse because the Overland Telegraph Station had been allocated an 11 km reserve. Local legend offers a different explanation for the town&#x27;s location. In 1934 Joe Kilgarriff from Alice Springs built the Tennant Creek hotel on the eastern side of the telegraph line, the building supplies being delivered on the first commercial journey of the AEC Roadtrain from Alice Springs. The pub still exists and is a historic monument to the early days.

Cecil Armstrong was one man who made a contribution to the early development of Tennant Creek. He arrived in April
1935 and began baking bread the next day. In 1937 he built Armstrong&#x27;s bakery and cafe where he lived and worked for more than twenty years as baker and cafe proprietor. The building still stands today, albeit under a different guise. Cecil&#x27;s telephone number was simply the number 1 and his Post Office box was also number 1.

Another important contributor to Tennant life was Mrs Weaber, wife of the blind owner of the Rising Sun Mine, one of the richest gold mines in the district before World War II. A devout Catholic, Mrs Weaber paid for the old church at Pine Creek to be transported to Tennant Creek plank by wooden plank, thereby establishing the Tennant Creek Catholic Church. Mrs Weaber also started the Tennant Creek Christmas tree event, when in the early 1930s she held a party at her husband&#x27;s gold mine and gave every child on the gold field a present. Mrs Weaber&#x27;s generosity continues into the present day. Every year the town erects a public Christmas tree and every child, local or visitor, is given a present. The Weaber family left Tennant Creek in 1940 following a series of personal family tragedies. They sold the lease to what would become Tennant&#x27;s richest post war mine, Nobles Nob, before they realised its potential. Nobles Nob was named after Jack Noble, an old friend of the Weaber family from the days when they all lived in the Kimberley Region of Western Australia.

Gold Mining was all but shut down in Tennant Creek in 1942. The only mine to remain operational was a large mine with its own crushing plant. During World War II, the Australian Army set up the 55th Australian Camp Hospital near Tennant Creek. The Royal Australian Air Force utilised Tennant Creek Airfield as an emergency landing ground.

The town today is situated on a stretch of the Stuart Highway known as Paterson Street. As it is a regional
centre, it contains government services and local business and also has a developing tourist centre. There are a
number of restaurants and tourist activities. The people of Tennant Creek enjoy modern facilities including reserves, sporting venues, galleries and a civic hall. It is also home to Australia&#x27;s premier go-karting event, held on a street circuit through the town.

==Demographics==
The population of Tennant Creek as of the is 3,080 people, of which 1,707 (55.4%) are Aboriginal.

==Government==

Tennant Creek had a town council headed by a mayor until 1 July 2008, when it became part of the Barkly Region.

The main Aboriginal body within the town is the Julalikari Council Aboriginal Corporation, that plays a major role in providing training and employment services for the Aboriginal people in Tennant Creek. It has developed a construction capacity and provides contract services to the Town Council such as recycling. Julalikari also provides community services within the township such as Homemakers, aged care, and the night patrol.

The police district covers almost 22,000 square kilometres and has a strength of 25 officers. The force includes two Criminal Investigation Branch (CIB) officers.

==Economy==

=== Mining ===
Tennant Creek was once the third largest gold producer in Australia and is still highly productive. Over 210 tonnes of gold have been mined in the area. Notable former mines include the Nobles Nob and the Peko mines which were established in 1933 and 1934 respectively. 

The Bootu Mine to the north of town exports manganese to China and major mining companies are continuing to explore for bauxite, lead, zinc, silver and copper around the area. Exploration has commenced to the southeast of the town for unspecified minerals.
=== Energy ===

The nearby town of Elliot is the proposed site of a very large solar panel installation that is part of the Sun Cable project.

=== Tourism ===

Tourism is a growing industry emphasising its location, history, scenery and cultural attributes, and provides tourists with an opportunity to experience the outback. The mineral collection at Battery Hill is a must-see, although the stamp battery ceased working in 2005, but has since been refurbished and now operates daily for tours. The exhibition &quot;Freedom, Fortitude and Flies&quot; in the social history museum at Battery Hill tells the story of mining in Tennant Creek through the eyes of women and children. It was designed by award-winning artist Alison Alder, a former Tennant Creek resident.

Nyinkka Nyunyu Arts and Culture Centre opened in July 2003, offering visitors and the community an opportunity to learn about Aboriginal life, history, and culture.

==Transport==

Tennant Creek has been accessible by train since the completion of the Adelaide-Darwin railway north from Alice Springs in 2004. &quot;The Ghan&quot;, run by Great Southern Rail between Adelaide and Darwin, passes twice weekly in each direction.

Tennant Creek is serviced by Tennant Creek Airport, with scheduled flights to Alice Springs and Darwin. Outback Airlines currently services Tennant Creek, providing mining charters between Alice Springs and Tennant Creek with seats available to the general public.

Tennant Creek has daily coach services from Darwin, Alice Springs, and previously Queensland (closed due to COVID-19). The Barkly Tablelands are best explored via Tennant Creek, which can be accessed on the fully sealed Explorer&#x27;s Way, 1,000 kilometres south of Darwin, 670 kilometres south of Katherine and 510 kilometres north of Alice Springs. The Overlander&#x27;s Way (Barkly Highway) is another tourism drive from Queensland that meets the Explorer&#x27;s Way at Threeways – 25 kilometres north of Tennant Creek.

In May 2005, Minemakers and ATEC signed an agreement to study a 250 km open access railway from Tennant Creek to Wonarah.

Historically, there has been suggestion of a rail link between Tennant Creek and Mount Isa. This link would allow resources companies to gain access to both the Adelaide-Darwin (The Ghan) and Townsville-Mount Isa (The Inlander) lines. The missing rail link would also provide rail passengers with direct rail access to Darwin from the East Coast of Australia. The Australian Defence Force may also use the link to provide a rail access between the 1st Brigade in Darwin, and the 3rd Brigade in Townsville.

==Education==
Tennant Creek has a primary and high school. In the 1970s and &#x27;80s, secondary students tended to leave Tennant Creek and board at secondary schools in Darwin and Alice Springs, but today young people prefer to remain at schools in Tennant Creek.

==Society and culture==
Aboriginal people have lived in the Barkly region for over 40,000 years. The Barkly region is steeped in the ancient traditions and beliefs of its traditional custodians, and around nine Aboriginal groups, including the Warumungu, Warlpiri, Kaytetye and Alyawarre people, call the area home. Tennant Creek is an important social, cultural and business centre for many Aboriginal people of various language groups.

===Leisure and entertainment===
The Northern Territory holds several regional events throughout the year, which in some cases can impact on visitor numbers to the region. Events located within the Barkly Area during the year include the Desert Harmony Festival, the Barkly Campdraft and Rodeo, Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day Races, Barkly May Day Muster and the Brunette Downs Races. The World Solar Car Challenge takes place every second year.

The Tennant Creek Public Library services the people of the town and surrounding area.

===The arts===
Tennant Creek has a rich and colourful musical community, and the Winanjjikari Music Centre is home to a number of
emerging singers, songwriters and musicians. 

The Artists of the Barkly collective is supported by Barkly Regional Arts. It represents more than 50 Aboriginal artists living in five remote communities across the region: Tennant Creek, Wutunugurra (Epenarra), Owairtilla (Canteen Creek), and Kulumindini (Elliott), and Mungkarta (McLaren Creek).

Initiated by the Warumungu community of Tennant Creek in 1995, the Nyinkka Nyunyu Art and Culture Centre was opened in 2003. It is a purpose-built centre, which houses displays covering five topics: bush tucker and resources, Country, Language, History, and &quot;Punttu&quot; (family). It is run by the Julalikari Council Aboriginal Corporation.

===Sport and recreation===
There are a number of sports and recreation clubs in Tennant Creek for locals some are Tennant Creek Bowling Club, Tennant Creek Golf Club, Tennant Creek Gun Club, Tennant Creek Soccer Club, Tennant Creek Swimming Pool.

Tennant Creek Speedway () just north of the town, on the Kaczinsky Road hosted important motorcycle speedway events, including qualifying rounds of the Speedway World Championship (starting in 1985).

Four Tennant Creek based clubs play in the regional Barkly Australian Football League Australian rules football competition.

Tennant Creek Cricket Association returned 
after 20 years without a competition.

The Tennant Creek Youth Centre will host basketball.

NRL Northern Territory administered Central Australian Rugby Football League
With teams playing from Alice Springs and wider communities including Tennant Creek and Yuendumu.

==Crime==

Tennant Creek is known for having one of the highest crime rates in Australia, especially among its local Aboriginal population. Much of the crime is violent and stems from alcohol.

Tennant Creek is consistently ranked among the most dangerous towns in Australia, and as of 2023 it is the most dangerous town in the Northern Territory.

In January 2017, the estimated homicide rate in Tennant Creek was 59.6 per 100,000 people, almost double as high as the homicide rate per 100,000 people in the United States.

===Domestic violence and sexual assault===
Over the past few years the rising number of sexual assaults (including on children), alcohol abuse, domestic violence and family disputes between locals despite such a small population has been raised by numerous media sources and identified as a region of legitimate concern in comparison to other states and isolated townships.

<text>Yadegar Mokhammad (Volga Türki and Persian: یادگار محمد; , Yädkär, Yädegär, ) (died 1565) was the last khan of the Kazan Khanate, occupying the position from March to October 1552. He was the son of Astrakhan khan Qasim II. Between 1542 and 1550 he was in the service of the Tsardom of Russia. In 1550, he participated in the attack on Kazan and then joined the Nogais. After the Kazan Khanate was nearly brought to defeat by Ivan the Terrible&#x27;s forces in 1550, in 1551 the &quot;peace party&quot; in Kazan enthroned the pro-Russian khan Shah Ali. In 1552 the anti-Russian &quot;patriotic party&quot; regained power. Shah Ali fled and Yadegar was invited by Qol Sharif and Chapqin bek Otich uli (Çapqın bäk Otıç ulı, ) to the throne of the Kazan Khanate. Subsequently, he led the war against the Russian invasion (see Siege of Kazan). He was captured in October 1552 when Russian troops took Kazan. In 1553 he converted to Christianity, assumed the name of &quot;Simeon Kasayevich&quot; and lived in Moscow as a Russian nobleman. He was one of the last great descendants of Jochi Khan, the eldest son of the Genghis Khan.

<doc id="1017748" wikidata="Q11883221" url="?curid=1017748" title="Moral agency">
<text>Moral agency is an individual&#x27;s ability to make moral choices based on some notion of right and wrong and to be held accountable for these actions. A moral agent is &quot;a being who is capable of acting with reference to right and wrong.&quot;

==Development and analysis==

Most philosophers suggest only rational beings, who can reason and form self-interested judgments, are capable of being moral agents. Some suggest those with limited rationality (for example, people who are mildly mentally disabled or infants) also have some basic moral capabilities.

Determinists argue all of our actions are the product of antecedent causes, and some believe this is incompatible with free will and thus claim that we have no real control over our actions. Immanuel Kant argued that whether or not our real self, the noumenal self, can choose, we have no choice but to believe that we choose freely when we make a choice. This does not mean that we can &quot;control&quot; the effects of our actions.
Some Indeterminists would argue we have no free will either. If, with respect to human behavior, a so-called &#x27;cause&#x27; results in an indeterminate number of possible, so-called &#x27;effects&#x27;, that does not mean the person had the free-thinking independent will to choose that &#x27;effect&#x27;. More likely, it was the indeterminate consequence of his chance genetics, chance experiences and chance circumstances relevant at the time of the &#x27;cause&#x27;.

In Kant&#x27;s philosophy, this calls for an act of faith, the faith free agent is based on something &quot;a priori&quot;, yet to be known, or immaterial. Otherwise, without free agent&#x27;s &quot;a priori&quot; fundamental source, socially essential concepts created from human mind, such as justice, would be undermined (responsibility implies freedom of choice) and, in short, civilization and human values would crumble.

It is useful to compare the idea of moral agency with the legal doctrine of &quot;mens rea&quot;, which means guilty mind, and states that a person is legally responsible for what he does as long as he &quot;should&quot; know what he is doing, and his choices are deliberate. Some theorists discard any attempts to evaluate mental states and, instead, adopt the doctrine of &quot;strict liability&quot;, whereby one is liable under the law without regard to capacity, and that the only thing is to determine the degree of punishment, if any. Moral determinists would most likely adopt a similar point of view.

Psychologist Albert Bandura has observed that moral agents engage in selective moral disengagement in regards to their own inhumane conduct.

==Distinction between moral agents and moral patients==

Moral agents are entities whose actions are eligible for moral consideration. An example of this would be a young child old enough to understand right from wrong, yet they hit their siblings on an occasion when they get angry. The action of hitting is up for moral consideration because the child is old enough to consider whether or not it is the correct action to take and the morality of their behavior.

Moral patients are entities that themselves are eligible for moral consideration. An example of this would be a child who does not know how to determine right from wrong. A child in this situation is up for moral consideration by others because those around them understand they are incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions and are therefore unable to understand the morality of a situation due to developmental barriers.

Many philosophers, such as Immanuel Kant, view morality as a transaction among rational parties, i.e., among moral agents. In Richard Dean’s article on Kant’s moral theory he discusses how agents who are able to control their tendencies or drives, are able to remain unbiased as they determine the path of moral action. The ability to be able to control this is called moral commitment. Agents need to become experts in this control in order to be able to declare something as moral or immoral and retain reputability. For this reason, they would exclude other animals from moral consideration.

Utilitarian philosophers Jeremy Bentham and Peter Singer have argued that the key to inclusion in the moral community is not rationality — for if it were, we might have to exclude some disabled people and infants, and might also have to distinguish between the degrees of rationality of healthy adults — but the real object of moral action is the avoidance of suffering. An example of this is the abortion debate. Further examples can be taken from the argument from marginal cases.

==Artificial moral agents==

Discussions of artificial moral agency center around a few main ideas. The first discussion is on whether it is possible for an artificial system to be a moral agent - see artificial systems and moral responsibility.
The second discussion concerns efforts to construct machines with ethically-significant behaviors - see machine ethics. 
Finally, there is debate about whether robots &quot;should&quot; be constructed as moral agents.

Research has shown that humans do perceive robots as having varying degrees of moral agency. These perceptions can manifest in two distinct ways: 1. ideas about a robot’s moral capacity (the ability to be/do good or bad) and 2. ideas about its dependence or independence on programming (where high dependency equates to low agency).

Research suggests that the moral judgment of an action may not depend on whether the agent is a human or a robot. However, robots are rarely given credit for acting well, and must behave more consistently well to be trusted.

The creation of a robot or &quot;social machine&quot; with the capability of understanding morality and agency has not been accomplished yet. However, a machine with those capabilities could be potentially created in the future.

==Non-human animals==

Discussion of moral agency in non-human animals involves both debate about the nature of morality and about the capacities and behavior of human and non-human animals. Thinkers who agree about the nature, behavior and abilities of different species may still disagree about which capacities are important for moral agency or about the significance of particular behaviors in determining moral agency. Since moral agents are often thought to warrant particular moral consideration, this discussion is sometimes linked to debates in animal rights about practices involving non-human animals.

Studies of animal biology and behavior have provided strong evidence of complex social structures and behavioral norms in non-human species. There is also evidence that some non-human species, especially other primates, can demonstrate empathy and emotions such as guilt or grief, though some thinkers dispute this. However, humans display distinctive capacities related to intelligence and rationality such as the ability to engage in abstract and symbolic thought and to employ complex language.

Philosophers and biologists who claim that non-human animals are moral agents typically argue that moral agency is dependent on empathy or social relations, and stress the evidence for these in non-human animals. They may also point out behaviors which in humans are described as moral activities, such as the punishment of individuals who break social norms. Some thinkers suggest that there are a variety of types or levels of moral agency which vary by species, or that animals may act morally without being full moral agents.

Thinkers who hold that only humans can be moral agents typically argue that moral agency depends on rationality. They highlight distinctive human abilities and the unique complexity of human behavior. They argue that shared behaviors such as the punishment of wrongdoers are nevertheless underpinned by very different internal processes, meaning that these behaviors qualify as moral activity for humans but not for non-humans.

<doc id="1017755" wikidata="Q1097028" url="?curid=1017755" title="Spondylosis">
<text>Spondylosis is the degeneration of the vertebral column from any cause. In the more narrow sense, it refers to spinal osteoarthritis, the age-related degeneration of the spinal column, which is the most common cause of spondylosis. The degenerative process in osteoarthritis chiefly affects the vertebral bodies, the neural foramina and the facet joints (facet syndrome). If severe, it may cause pressure on the spinal cord or nerve roots with subsequent sensory or motor disturbances, such as pain, paresthesia, imbalance, and muscle weakness in the limbs.

When the space between two adjacent vertebrae narrows, compression of a nerve root emerging from the spinal cord may result in radiculopathy. Radiculopathy is characterized by sensory and motor disturbances, such as severe pain in the neck, shoulder, arm, back, or leg, accompanied by muscle weakness. Less commonly, direct pressure on the spinal cord (typically in the cervical spine) may result in myelopathy, characterized by global weakness, gait dysfunction, loss of balance, and loss of bowel or bladder control. The patient may experience shocks (paresthesia) in hands and legs because of nerve compression and lack of blood flow. If vertebrae of the neck are involved it is labelled cervical spondylosis. Lower back spondylosis is labeled lumbar spondylosis. The term is from Ancient Greek σπόνδυλος &quot;spóndylos&quot;, &quot;a vertebra&quot;, in plural &quot;vertebrae – the backbone&quot;. &quot;osis&#x27; is Latin/English for &quot;a process or condition&quot;. 

==Signs and symptoms==
===Cervical spondylosis===
In cervical spondylosis, a patient may be presented with dull neck pain with neck stiffness in the initial stages of the disease. As the disease progresses, symptoms related to radiculopathy (due to compression of exiting spinal nerve by narrowed intervertebral foramen) or myelopathy (due to compression on the spinal cord) can occur. Reduced range of motion of the neck is the most frequent objective finding on physical examination.

In cervical radiculopathy, there would be numbness, tingling, or burning pain at the skin area supplied by the spinal nerve, shooting pain along the course of the spinal nerve, or weakness or absent tendon reflex of the muscle supplied by the nerve. This symptom can be provoked by neck extension. Therefore, Spurling&#x27;s test, which take advantage of this phenomenon, is performed by extending and laterally flexing the patient&#x27;s head and placing downward pressure on it to narrow the intervertebral foramen. Neck or shoulder pain on the ipsilateral side (i.e., the side to which the head is flexed) indicates a positive result for this test. A positive test result is not necessarily a positive result for spondylosis and as such additional testing is required.

In cervical myelopathy, almost always involves both the upper and lower limbs. A person may experience difficult gait or limb stiffness in the early stages of the disease. Iliopsoas muscle is the first group of muscles that is affected. Lower limb weaknesses without any upper limb involvement should raise the suspicion of thoracic cord compression. Finger escape sign is performed to detect the weakness of the fingers. A person&#x27;s forearm is pronated and the fingers are extended. If the person has myelopathy, there will be slow abduction and flexion of the fingers on the ulnar side. The degree of loss of sensation may be different on both upper limbs. Lhermitte sign is performed by asking a person to gently extend the neck. Those with cervical myelopathy will produce a feeling of electrical shock down the spine or arms. Muscle spasticity, hyperreflexia or even clonus are characteristic of myelopathy. Other abnormal reflexes such as Hoffmann&#x27;s reflex, upward response of plantar reflex (Babinski response), and Wartenberg&#x27;s sign (abnormal abduction of little finger) can also be elicited.

===Lumbar spondylosis===
Since the spinal cord ends at L1 or L2 vertebral levels, the job of nerve transmission is continued by spinal nerves for the remaining part of the vertebral canal. Degenerative process of spondylosis such as disc bulging, osteophyte formation, and hypertrophy of the superior articular process all contributes to the narrowing of the spinal canal and intervertebral foramen, leading to compression of these spinal nerves that results in radiculopathy-related symptoms. 

Narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal causes a clinical condition known as neurogenic claudication, characterized by symptoms such as lower back pain, leg pain, leg numbness, and leg weakness that worsens with standing and walking and improves with sitting and lying down.

===Complications===
A rare but severe complication of this disease is vertebrobasilar insufficiency. This is a result of the vertebral artery becoming occluded as it passes up in the transverse foramen. The spinal joints become stiff in cervical spondylosis. Thus the chondrocytes which maintain the disc become deprived of nutrition and die. Secondary osteophytes may cause stenosis for spinal nerves, manifesting as radiculopathy.

==Causes==
Congenital cervical spine stenosis commonly occurs due to short pedicles (that form the vertebral arch). When the spinal canal diameter divided by vertebral body diameter is less than 0.82, or the anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal is less than 1.3cm or the distance between the pedicles is less than 2.3cm during imaging, cervical spine stenosis is diagnosed symptoms correlate well with the spinal canal narrowings. This is because some patients may not have any symptoms at all even when there is severe cervical spine spondylosis.

Spondylosis is caused from years of constant abnormal pressure, caused by joint subluxation, stress induced by sports, acute and/or repetitive trauma, or poor posture, being placed on the vertebrae and the discs between them. The abnormal stress causes the body to form new bone in order to compensate for the new weight distribution. This abnormal weight bearing from bone displacement will cause spondylosis to occur. Poor postures and loss of the normal spinal curves can lead to spondylosis as well. Spondylosis can affect a person at any age; however, older people are more susceptible.

Degeneration of the intervertebral disc, facet joints, and its capsules, and ligamentum flavum all can also cause spinal canal narrowing.

==Diagnosis==
Those with neck pain only without any positive neurological findings usually do not require an x-ray of the cervical spine. For those with chronic neck pain, a cervical spine x-ray may be indicated. There are various ways of doing cervical spine X-rays such as anteroposterior (AP) view, lateral view, Swimmer&#x27;s view, and oblique view. Cervical X-rays may show osteophytes, decreased intervertebral disc height, narrowing of the spinal canal, and abnormal alignment (kyphosis of the cervical spine). Flexion and extension view of the cervical spine is helpful to look for spondylolisthesis (slippage of one vertebra over another).

MRI and CT scans are helpful for diagnosis but generally are not definitive and must be considered together with physical examinations and history.
CT scan is helpful to see small bony elements of the spine such as facet joint and to determine whether there is osteoporosis of the spine. However, interverterbral foramen and ligaments are not well visualised on the CT. Therefore, contrast is injected into the spinal canal via lumbar puncture and then imaged using CT scan (known as CT myelography). CT myelography is useful when the person is contraindicated to MRI scan due to presence of pacemaker or infusion pump in the body.

MRI is the investigation of choice to investigate radiculopathy and myelopathy. MRI can show intervertebral foramen, spinal canal, ligaments, degree of disc degeneration or herniation, alignment of the spine, and changes on the spinal cord accurately.

==Treatment==
Many of the treatments for cervical spondylosis have not been subjected to rigorous, controlled trials. Surgery is advocated for cervical radiculopathy in patients who have intractable pain, progressive symptoms, or weakness that fails to improve with conservative therapy. Surgical indications for cervical spondylosis with myelopathy (CSM) remain somewhat controversial, but &quot;most clinicians recommend operative therapy over conservative therapy for moderate-to-severe myelopathy&quot;.

Physical therapy may be effective for restoring range of motion, flexibility and core strengthening. Decompressive therapies (i.e., manual mobilization, mechanical traction) may also help alleviate pain. However, physical therapy and osteopathy cannot &quot;cure&quot; the degeneration, and some people view that strong compliance with postural modification is necessary to realize maximum benefit from decompression, adjustments and flexibility rehabilitation.

Noninvasive treatment options specifically for lumbar spondylosis can include transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, which involves electrodes being attached to the skin and it sending electrical impulses to alleviate pain. Another option is to use a brace for a lumbar support and to minimize unnecessary harmful movements while promoting good posture. Heat and massage can temporarily alleviate symptoms, too. 

=== Surgery ===
Current surgical procedures used to treat spondylosis aim to alleviate the signs and symptoms of the disease by decreasing pressure in the spinal canal (decompression surgery) and/or by controlling spine movement (fusion surgery) but the evidence is limited in support of some aspects of these procedures. 

In cervical myelopathy, if the spine still retains its neutral or lordotic alignment, with one or two involved spinal segments, anterior approaches such as anterior cervical discectomy (removal of the intervertebral disc) and fusion (joining two or more vertebrae together), anterior cervical corpectomy (removal of vertebral body) and fusion, and cervical arthroplasty (joint surgery) can be used to relieve the spinal cord from compression. The anterior approach is also preferred when the source of compression arises from the anterior part of the cervical canal. If the cervical spine is in a fixed kyphotic position and with one to two involved spinal segments, posterior approaches such as laminoplasty (removal of lamina with a bone graft or metal plate as replacement) or laminectomy (removal of lamina without any replacement) with or without fusion can be used for decompression. The posterior approach is also used when the source of compression arises from the posterior part of the spinal canal. The posterior approach also avoids some technical challenges associated with the anterior approach, such as obesity, short neck, barrel chest, or previous anterior neck surgery. If three or more spinal segments are involved, both anterior and posterior approaches are used.

Decompression surgery: The vertebral column can be operated on from both an anterior and posterior approach. The approach varies depending on the site and cause of root compression. Commonly, osteophytes and portions of intervertebral disc are removed.

Fusion surgery: Performed when there is evidence of spinal instability or mal-alignment. Use of instrumentation (such as pedicle screws) in fusion surgeries varies across studies.

<text>Safa Giray (Crimean Tatar, Persian, and ) was three times khan of Kazan (1524–31, 1535–46, 1546–49). He was the nephew of the previous Kazan Khan Sahib Giray and brother of Moxammat Giray.

First reign 1524–31: In 1524 a large Russian army approached Kazan and Sahib Giray fled. His 13-year-old nephew Safa Giray took his place. The Russian siege of Kazan failed and they withdrew. In 1530 another Russian army burned part of Kazan and Safa Giray fled to Arsk. The matter was settled when a faction deposed Safa Giray and enthroned the pro-Russian Jan Ali.

Second reign 1535–46: Four years later, in 1535 the Kazan nobility expelled or killed the pro-Russian Jan Ali and Safa Giray returned to the throne. He married Jan Ali&#x27;s wife or widow Söyembikä of Kazan. The pro-Russian faction wanted to enthrone Jan Ali&#x27;s brother Shah Ali, but they were unsuccessful. The choice of an anti-Russian khan led to border fighting around Nizhny Novgorod. In 1537 or 1538 Safa Giray burned the outskirts of Murom and withdrew on the approach of a Russian army. In 1546 two Russian armies raided near Kazan and withdrew. In 1546 a Kazan faction revolted and Safa Giray fled to his father-in-law Yusuf of the Nogai horde. He was replaced by the pro-Russian Shahghali (Shah Ali).

Third reign 1546–49: Shah Ali soon found his position impossible and after a few months slipped out of town. Safa Giray returned with a Nogai army but Shah Ali&#x27;s flight made the army unnecessary. Leaders of the pro-Russian faction fled. In late 1547 Ivan the Terrible in person led a winter campaign against Kazan, but an early thaw made the roads and rivers impassible, so he returned to Moscow. Part of the army continued, won a few battles and withdrew.

Safa Giray died in 1549. Reason of his death is unclear, but it is said that he was poisoned by his enemies. After his death his infant son Utamesh ascended the throne. His wife, Söyembikä became Regent.

<text>Dzhan-Ali (Volga Türki and Persian: جان علی; , ; in Russian chronicles as Yanaley / Yenaley, &quot;Яналей&quot;, &quot;Еналей&quot;; 1516–1535) was ruler of the Khanate of Qasim in 1519–1532 and then Khanate of Kazan in 1532–1535. He was the son of Qasim khan Sheikh Auliyar (&quot;Şäyexäwliyär&quot;) (r. 1512-15) and younger brother of Qasim khan Shah-Ali (&quot;Şahğali&quot;) (r. 1515-19). 

When Shah Ali moved to Kazan Jan Ali took the throne. The Qasim Khanate was a vassal state of Muscovy. Canghali as its ruler had close ties with Muscovy. 

In 1532 Vasili III of Russia defeated Kazan, khan Safagäräy fled and the 16-year-old Canghali was brought in as a pro-Russian ruler of the bigger and generally independent Kazan Khanate. In 1533 Canghali married Söyembika, the daughter of Nogay nobleman. During his reign he was completely manipulated by Bulat Shirin (Bulat Şirin, /boo-LAHT shee-RREEN/) and queen Gawharshat (Gäwhärşat, /geh-w-ha-rr-SHAHT/), widow or sister of Moxammat Amin khan. During 1535 coup of Kazan nobility, he lost the throne and was exiled to Iske Qazan. Older sources (Howorth) say that he was killed.

<text>Antialcidas Nikephoros (; epithet means &quot;the Victorious&quot;, Brahmi: 𑀅𑀁𑀢𑀮𑀺𑀓𑀺𑀢𑀲 &quot;Aṃtalikitasa&quot;, in the Heliodorus Pillar) was a king of the Indo-Greek Kingdom, who reigned from his capital at Taxila. Bopearachchi has suggested that he ruled from ca. 115 to 95 BCE in the western parts of the Indo-Greek realms, whereas R. C. Senior places him around 130 to 120 BCE and also in eastern Punjab (which seems better supported by coin findings). Senior does however believe that he ruled in tandem with King Lysias.

==Genealogy==
Antialcidas may have been a relative of the Greco-Bactrian king Heliocles I, but ruled after the fall of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom. Several later kings may have been related to Antialcidas: Heliokles II, Amyntas, Diomedes and Hermaeus all struck coins with similar features.

==The Heliodorus inscription==
Though there are few sources for the late Indo-Greek history, Antialcidas is known from an inscription left on a pillar (the Heliodorus pillar), which was erected by his ambassador Heliodorus at the court of the Shunga king Bhagabhadra at Vidisha, near Sanchi. It states that he was a devotee of Vishnu, the Hindu god.

A part of the inscription says: 
:&quot;This Garuda-standard was made by order of the Bhagavata ... Heliodoros, the son of Dion, a man of Taxila, a Greek ambassador from King Antialkidas, to King Bhagabhadra, the son of the Princess from Benares, the saviour, while prospering in the fourteenth year of his reign.&quot;

==Coins==
Otherwise, Antialcidas is also known through his plentiful coins. He issued a number of bilingual Indian silver types: diademed, wearing a helmet with bull&#x27;s horns or a flat kausia. He also appears throwing a spear. According to some interpretations (Grousset), the baby elephant may symbolize the Buddha Siddhartha Gautama, who took the shape of a small elephant to enter the womb of his mother Queen Maya, a scene often depicted in Greco-Buddhist art. In that case the coin scene would represent a victory of Buddhism. According to other interpretations the elephant was the symbol of the city of Taxila.

==&quot;Mule coins&quot; (overstrikes)==
There is a bronze which features the obverse of Lysias and the reverse of Antialcidas. This was interpreted by Tarn and other earlier scholars as though the two kings might have forged some kind of alliance, but later, a bronze with the opposite arrangement was found.

Modern scholarship has however largely accepted that what was originally supposed to be a &quot;joint issue&quot; was in fact a mule; in other words, a mistake occurred in the process of overstriking the original coin, and it was accidentally issued with both king&#x27;s standards.

<doc id="1017772" wikidata="Q750087" url="?curid=1017772" title="Love. Angel. Music. Baby.">
<text>Love. Angel. Music. Baby. is the debut solo studio album by American singer Gwen Stefani, released on November 12, 2004, by Interscope Records. Stefani, who had previously released five studio albums as lead singer of the rock band No Doubt, began recording solo material in early 2003. She began working on &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; as a side project that would become a full album after No Doubt went on hiatus. Stefani co-wrote every song on the album, collaborating with various songwriters and producers including André 3000, Dallas Austin, Dr. Dre, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, the Neptunes and Linda Perry. The album also features guest appearances by Eve and André 3000.

Designed to sound like a 1980s dance record, &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; was influenced by artists and bands such as the Cure, Lisa Lisa, New Order, Prince, Depeche Mode and Madonna. The album incorporates a diverse range of genres, including electropop, dance-rock, new wave, and soul, while lyrically, it explores themes of fashion, wealth and relationships. Promotion of the album included the release of six commercially successful singles and the North American Harajuku Lovers Tour. While promoting, Stefani was often accompanied by backup dancers called the Harajuku Girls.

&quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; was met with generally positive reviews from music critics, and received a total of six Grammy Award nominations, including Album of the Year, during the 2006 ceremony. It debuted at number seven on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 309,000 copies in its first week, eventually peaking at number five. The album has received multi-platinum sales certifications in several countries and has sold over eight million copies worldwide.

==Background==
During her time with the band No Doubt, Stefani began making solo appearances on albums by artists such as Eve. In the production of its fifth studio album, &quot;Rock Steady&quot; (2001), No Doubt collaborated with Prince, the Neptunes, and David A. Stewart and had Mark &quot;Spike&quot; Stent mixing the album. While the band was on tour to promote the album, Stefani listened to Club Nouveau&#x27;s 1987 song &quot;Why You Treat Me So Bad&quot; and considered recording material that modernized 1980s music. No Doubt&#x27;s bassist and her former boyfriend, Tony Kanal, introduced her to music by Prince, Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, and Debbie Deb, and they talked about producing songs from Kanal&#x27;s bedroom.

In 2003, Stefani began recording solo material. She stated she was considering recording singles to be used on soundtracks, continuing her collaborations or releasing an album under the pseudonym &quot;GS&quot;. Jimmy Iovine (chairman and co-founder of Interscope) convinced Stefani to work on this album. On the second day of her sessions with Linda Perry, the two wrote a song about Stefani&#x27;s writer&#x27;s block and fears about the solo album. This became the track &quot;What You Waiting For?&quot;, which was released as the lead single for the album.

When the two began working on a song that Stefani stated was too personal, she left to visit Kanal. He played her a track on which he had been working and which became &quot;Crash&quot;, the album&#x27;s final single. The two tried to write new material, but gave up after two weeks. They did not return to work until six months later, when Stefani began collaborating with other artists, commenting, &quot;If I were to write the chorus of &#x27;Yesterday&#x27; by the Beatles, and that&#x27;s all I wrote, that would be good enough to be part of that history.&quot; Stefani resumed work with Linda Perry, who invited Dallas Austin, and many other artists, including Outkast&#x27;s André 3000, the Neptunes, and Dr. Dre. Stefani announced the album&#x27;s release in early 2004, marketing it as a &quot;dance record&quot; and a &quot;guilty pleasure&quot;.

To commemorate the 15th anniversary of the album, Interscope released a version of the album remastered by Chris Gehringer on November 22, 2019.

==Composition==

===Music and lyrics===
&quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; is an electropop, new wave, dance-rock, and soul album, incorporating elements of R&amp;B, hip hop, and disco. The album takes influence from a variety of 1980s genres to the extent that one reviewer commented, &quot;The only significant &#x27;80s radio style skipped is the ska punk revival that No Doubt rode to success.&quot; Several songs employ synthesizer sounds characteristic of music from the 1980s, drawing comparisons to the Go-Go&#x27;s and Cyndi Lauper. Stefani cited Club Nouveau, Depeche Mode, Lisa Lisa, Prince, New Order, the Cure, and early Madonna as major influences for the album.

Like pop albums of the 1980s, &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; focuses primarily on money, with songs such as &quot;Rich Girl&quot; and &quot;Luxurious&quot; that feature descriptions of riches and wealth. The album contains several references to Stefani&#x27;s clothing line, L.A.M.B., and alludes to contemporary fashion designers such as John Galliano, Rei Kawakubo, and Vivienne Westwood. Stefani also released a series of dolls named the &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby. Fashion Dolls&quot;, designed after the costumes from her tour. Although Stefani intended for the album to be a light dance record, she stated that &quot;no matter what you do, things just come out.&quot; The album&#x27;s opening track &quot;What You Waiting For?&quot; discusses her desire to be a mother and in 2006, she and her then husband, Bush singer Gavin Rossdale, had a son named Kingston Rossdale. The fourth track &quot;Cool&quot; discusses Stefani&#x27;s friendship with Kanal after he ended a romantic relationship with her in 1995.

&quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; introduced the Harajuku Girls, an entourage of four Japanese women whom Stefani referred to as a figment of her imagination. The Harajuku Girls are discussed in several of the songs, including one named after and entirely dedicated to them. They appear in most of the music videos produced for the album and those for Stefani&#x27;s second album &quot;The Sweet Escape&quot; (2006). &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; includes various styles of music. Many songs are influenced by electro beats designed for club play. Producers Austin and Kanal incorporated R&amp;B into the song &quot;Luxurious&quot; which contains a sample of the Isley Brothers&#x27; 1983 single &quot;Between the Sheets&quot;. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis incorporate new jack swing, a fusion genre of R&amp;B that the pair had developed and popularized during the mid-1980s.

===Songs===
The album opens with &quot;What You Waiting For?&quot;, an electropop, new wave, dance-rock, and funk song. Lyrically, the song discusses Stefani&#x27;s fears of beginning a solo career. &quot;Rich Girl&quot;, a collaboration with rapper Eve, is a dancehall and reggae reworking of the English duo Louchie Lou &amp; Michie One&#x27;s 1994 song &quot;If I Was a Rich Girl&quot;, which itself interpolates the song &quot;If I Were a Rich Man&quot; from the 1964 musical &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. The Neptunes-produced track &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot; combines 1980s hip hop with dance music. It was written as a response to a derogatory comment that grunge musician Courtney Love made, referring to Stefani as a cheerleader.

The fourth track &quot;Cool&quot; chronicles Stefani&#x27;s previous relationship with Tony Kanal, featuring a new wave and synth-pop production. The song was compared to Cyndi Lauper and Madonna songs from the 1980s. &quot;Bubble Pop Electric&quot;, the fifth track, is an electro song featuring André 3000&#x27;s alias Johnny Vulture. It tells of the two having sex at a drive-in movie, and it was generally well received by critics, who drew comparisons to the 1978 film &quot;Grease&quot; and its 1982 sequel &quot;Grease 2&quot;. &quot;Luxurious&quot; is a 1990s-inspired R&amp;B song that lyrically talks about the desire to be rich in love, simultaneously comparing Stefani&#x27;s lover with luxuries. The seventh track, &quot;Harajuku Girls&quot;, is a synth-pop song that was described as a tribute to Tokyo&#x27;s street culture, produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.

&quot;Crash&quot; is an electroclash song that uses automobile metaphors to describe a relationship. &quot;The Real Thing&quot; was described as a vintage Europop song, and features guest appearances from New Order vocalist Bernard Sumner and bassist Peter Hook. The next track, the synth-pop song &quot;Serious&quot;, drew comparisons to Madonna&#x27;s work during the early 1980s. A music video was produced for the song, but it was never officially released, although a snippet of the video surfaced on YouTube in October 2006. &quot;Danger Zone&quot;, an electro-rock song, was widely interpreted to be about Stefani&#x27;s husband Gavin Rossdale having an illegitimate daughter; however, the song had been written before the discovery. The closing track &quot;Long Way to Go&quot; is an outtake from André 3000&#x27;s album &quot;The Love Below&quot; (2003). The song discusses interracial dating and uses a sample of Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s 1963 speech &quot;I Have a Dream&quot;.

==Promotion==

Stefani embarked on the Harajuku Lovers Tour on October 16, 2005, to promote &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; The tour consisted of only one leg, running for 42 dates across North America, ending on December 21, 2005. The hip hop group the Black Eyed Peas, rapper M.I.A., and singer Ciara accompanied Stefani as opening acts for her tour. The tour was met with varying responses from contemporary critics, who despite praising Stefani&#x27;s vocals, were critical of other aspects of the show such as its musical material. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, the tour grossed $22 million from 37 shows, 20 of which sold out. A video album of the concert titled &quot;Harajuku Lovers Live&quot; was released on DVD on December 4, 2006. Additionally, a remix EP titled &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby. (The Remixes)&quot; was released on November 22, 2005, including remixes of &quot;Luxurious&quot;, &quot;Cool&quot;, &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot;, and &quot;What You Waiting For?&quot;.

===Singles===
&quot;What You Waiting For?&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; on September 28, 2004. The single peaked at number 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and was commercially successful overseas, topping the chart in Australia and reaching the top 10 in several countries including France, Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. &quot;Rich Girl&quot;, featuring Eve, was released as the album&#x27;s second single on December 14, 2004, becoming Stefani&#x27;s first top-10 entry as a solo artist in the US when it peaked at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Elsewhere, the song performed equally as successfully as &quot;What You Waiting For?&quot;. &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot; was released as the third single on March 15, 2005. It became the album&#x27;s best-selling and most popular single, while also becoming the first single to sell one million digital copies in the US. The song topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 within six weeks of its release, earning Stefani her first number-one single on the chart.

&quot;Cool&quot; was released as the fourth single from the album on July 5, 2005. The song fared moderately on the charts, reaching the top 10 in Australia and New Zealand, as well as the top 20 in Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Norway, the UK and the US. &quot;Luxurious&quot; was released as the fifth single on October 11, 2005. The single version features rapper Slim Thug. The song was less successful than the previous singles from the album, peaking at number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Crash&quot; was not originally planned as a single, but due to Stefani&#x27;s pregnancy, her second solo album was delayed, and the song was released as the sixth and final single from the album on January 24, 2006.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 71, based on 22 reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the album &quot;intermittently exciting and embarrassing&quot;, concluding that it is &quot;stranger and often more entertaining than nearly any other mainstream pop album of 2004.&quot; Jennifer Nine of Yahoo! Music praised the album as &quot;the hottest, coolest, best-dressed pop album of the year&quot; and found it to be &quot;sleek, shimmery, and dripping with all-killer-no-filler musical bling&quot;. &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;″s Charles Merwin opined that Stefani was a contender to fill Madonna&#x27;s role, &quot;[b]ut not enough to get seriously excited about her as the next great solo female careerist.&quot; Lisa Haines of BBC Music was more emphatic, stating that Stefani rivaled Madonna and Kelis, while dubbing the album a &quot;stunning and stylish effort that showcases Gwen&#x27;s credentials as a pop goddess.&quot;

Despite stating that Stefani &quot;shamelessly plunders&quot; 1980s music, Krissi Murison of the &quot;NME&quot; referred to the album as &quot;one of the most frivolously brilliant slabs of shiny retro-pop anyone&#x27;s had the chuzpah to release all year.&quot; John Murphy of &quot;musicOMH&quot; found the album &quot;enjoyable, if patchy&quot;, but commented that it was too long. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Rob Sheffield described the album as &quot;an irresistible party: trashy, hedonistic and deeply weird.&quot; The magazine later placed the album at number 39 on its list of the top 50 albums of 2004. Robert Christgau gave the album a three-star honorable mention () and wrote, &quot;Turns out the problem wasn&#x27;t ska per se—it was No Doubt.&quot; Edna Gundersen of &quot;USA Today&quot; called the album &quot;[f]un, fizzy, frivolous&quot;, while noting that Stefani&#x27;s &quot;caffeinated electro-pop amounts to little more than sly channeling of Lisa Lisa at a disco revival.&quot; Kelefa Sanneh of &quot;The New York Times&quot; viewed it as a &quot;clever and sometimes enticing solo debut that doesn&#x27;t quite add up.&quot;

The album was generally criticized for its large number of collaborations and producers. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Caroline Sullivan argued that although &quot;others lend a hand [...] it&#x27;s very much Stefani&#x27;s show&quot;; however, most others disagreed. Jason Damas of &quot;PopMatters&quot; compared the album to a second No Doubt greatest hits album, and Pitchfork&#x27;s Nick Sylvester felt that the large number of collaborators result in sacrificing Stefani&#x27;s identity on the album. Most reviewers held that the collaborations prevented the album from having a solidified sound. Eric Greenwood wrote for Drawer B that &quot;Stefani tries to be all things to all people here&quot;, but that the result &quot;comes off as manipulative and contrived.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s David Browne shared this opinion, stating that the album &quot;is like one of those retail magazines that resembles a catalog more than an old-fashioned collection of, say, articles.&quot;

Many reviewers focused on the album&#x27;s light lyrical themes. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the references to Stefani&#x27;s clothing line &quot;shameless&quot; and stated that &quot;each song becomes akin to a pricey retro fashion blurb&quot;, and &quot;Pitchfork&quot; quipped that &quot;the Joker&#x27;s free-money parade through Gotham City was a much more entertaining display of wealth, and he had Prince, not just Wendy &amp; Lisa.&quot; Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; commented that the album&#x27;s &quot;fashion fetish [...] gives the album a sense of thematic cohesiveness&quot;, but the &quot;obsession with Harajuku girls borders on maniacal&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; disagreed with this perspective, arguing that &quot;her affinity with Japanese pop culture [...] yields a synthetic sheen [...] that works well with the other point of reference, hip-hop.&quot;

===Accolades===
At the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, Stefani won the Digital Song of the Year award for &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot; and the New Artist of the Year Award, and she performed &quot;Luxurious&quot; with Slim Thug at the event. At the 2005 Grammy Awards, Stefani received a nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for &quot;What You Waiting For?&quot; and performed &quot;Rich Girl&quot; with Eve. At the next year&#x27;s awards, Stefani received five nominations, including Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album, Record of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot; and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for &quot;Rich Girl&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; debuted at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 309,000 copies in its first week. On the issue dated June 18, 2005, the album climbed to a new peak position of number five with 83,000 copies sold. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album quintuple platinum in March 2021, and had sold four million copies by May 2009.

The album had similar success in Europe. After entering the UK Albums Chart at number 14 with sales of 45,484 copies, &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; peaked at number four in its 25th week on the chart, on May 15, 2005, selling 21,271 copies. The album was certified triple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on September 16, 2005, and had sold 1,068,242 copies in the United Kingdom as of March 2016. The album was listed as the 20th best-selling album of 2005 in the UK. It also reached the top 10 in Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Norway, and Sweden, and the top 20 in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, and Switzerland. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) certified the album platinum in May 2005, denoting sales in excess of one million copies across Europe.

In Australia, &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; topped the ARIA Albums Chart for two consecutive weeks in February 2005 and spent 56 weeks on the chart. It ended 2005 as the fourth-best-selling album and was certified quadruple platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments of 280,000 copies. The album peaked at number three for two non-consecutive weeks on the Canadian Albums Chart, and was certified five-times platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) in April 2006 for sales of over half a million copies. As of April 2016, &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; had sold over eight million copies worldwide, and became the 12th best-selling album globally of 2005.

==Impact==
The success of the album&#x27;s urban contemporary-oriented songs in the adult contemporary market allowed for the success of other artists while Stefani was pregnant and later recording &quot;The Sweet Escape&quot;. Nelly Furtado&#x27;s third album &quot;Loose&quot; was released in June 2006 and was primarily produced by and written with hip hop producers Timbaland and Danja. Furtado&#x27;s reinvention from a worldbeat singer-songwriter was to Stefani&#x27;s previous forays into urban contemporary music. In his review of &quot;Loose&quot;, Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated that Timbaland aimed to &quot;produce an omnipop multiformat blockbuster in the style of [&quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot;]—but without Gwen.&quot; The Black Eyed Peas member Fergie released her solo debut album &quot;The Dutchess&quot; in September 2006. The &quot;cholas&quot; that accompanied Fergie in some of her music videos were viewed as derivatives of the Harajuku Girls and Stefani&#x27;s &quot;Luxurious&quot; music video. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;London Bridge&quot; was paralleled to &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot; and the third single &quot;Glamorous&quot; to &quot;Luxurious&quot;. Fergie refuted accusations of piggybacking on Stefani&#x27;s music, stating that &quot;this is all so ridiculous [...] The Peas and I make music we love, and for others to speculate is their problem.&quot;

<doc id="1017788" wikidata="Q647775" url="?curid=1017788" title="Myth of Er">
<text>The Myth of Er (; , &quot;gen&quot;.: ) is a legend that concludes Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; (10.614–10.621). The story includes an account of the cosmos and the afterlife that greatly influenced religious, philosophical, and scientific thought for many centuries.

The story begins as a man named Er, son of Armenios (), of Pamphylia, dies in battle. When the bodies of those who died in the battle are collected, ten days after his death, Er remains undecomposed. Two days later he revives on his funeral-pyre and tells others of his journey in the afterlife, including an account of metempsychosis and the celestial spheres of the astral plane. The tale includes the idea that moral people are rewarded and immoral people punished after death.

Although called the Myth of Er, the word &quot;myth&quot; here means &quot;word, speech, account&quot;, rather than the modern meaning. The word is used at the end when Socrates explains that because Er did not drink the waters of Lethe, the account (&quot;mythos&quot; in Greek) was preserved for us.

==Er&#x27;s tale==

With many other souls as his companions, Er had come across an awe-inspiring place with four openings – two into and out of the sky and two into and out of the ground. Judges sat between these openings and ordered the souls which path to follow: the good were guided into the path into the sky, the immoral were directed below. But when Er approached the judges, he was told to remain, listening and observing in order to report his experience to humankind.

Meanwhile from the other opening in the sky, clean souls floated down, recounting beautiful sights and wondrous feelings. Those returning from underground appeared dirty, haggard, and tired, crying in despair when recounting their awful experiences, as each was required to pay a tenfold penalty for all the wicked deeds committed when alive. There were some, however, who could not be released from underground. Murderers, tyrants and other non-political criminals were doomed to remain by the exit of the underground, unable to escape.

After seven days in the meadow, the souls and Er were required to travel farther. After four days they reached a place where they could see a shaft of rainbow light brighter than any they had seen before. After another days travel they reached it. This was the Spindle of Necessity. Several women, including Lady Necessity, her daughters, and the Sirens were present. The souls – except for Er – were then organized into rows and were each given a lottery token.

Then, in the order in which their lottery tokens were chosen, each soul was required to come forward to choose his or her next life. Er recalled the first one to choose a new life: a man who had not known the terrors of the underground but had been rewarded in the sky, hastily chose a powerful dictatorship. Upon further inspection he realized that, among other atrocities, he was destined to eat his own children. Er observed that this was often the case of those who had been through the path in the sky, whereas those who had been punished often chose a better life. Many preferred a life different from their previous experience. Animals chose human lives while humans often chose the apparently easier lives of animals.

After this, each soul was assigned a guardian spirit to help him or her through their life. They passed under the throne of Lady Necessity, then traveled to the Plane of Oblivion, where the River of Forgetfulness (River Lethe) flowed. Each soul was required to drink some of the water, in varying quantities; again, Er only watched. As they drank, each soul forgot everything. As they lay down at night to sleep each soul was lifted up into the night in various directions for rebirth, completing their journey. Er remembered nothing of the journey back to his body. He opened his eyes to find himself lying on the funeral pyre early in the morning, able to recall his journey through the afterlife.

==The moral==
In the dialogue Plato introduces the story by having Socrates explain to Glaucon that the soul must be immortal, and cannot be destroyed. Socrates tells Glaucon the Myth of Er to explain that the choices we make and the character we develop will have consequences after death. Earlier in Book II of the &quot;Republic&quot;, Socrates points out that even the gods can be tricked by a clever charlatan who appears just while unjust in his psyche, in that they would welcome the pious but false &quot;man of the people&quot; and would reject and punish the truly just but falsely accused man. In the Myth of Er the true characters of the falsely-pious and those who are immodest in some way are revealed when they are asked to choose another life and pick the lives of tyrants. Those who lived happy but middling lives in their previous life are most likely to choose the same for their future life, not necessarily because they are wise, but out of habit. Those who were treated with infinite injustice, despairing of the possibility of a good human life, choose the souls of animals for their future incarnation. The philosophic life — which identifies the types of lives that emerge from experience, character, and fate — allow men to make good choices when presented with options for a new life. Whereas success, fame, and power may provide temporary heavenly rewards or hellish punishments, philosophic virtues always work to one&#x27;s advantage.

==The Spindle of Necessity==

The myth mentions &quot;The Spindle of Necessity&quot;, in that the cosmos is represented by the Spindle attended by sirens and the three daughters of the Goddess Necessity known collectively as The Fates, whose duty is to keep the rims of the spindle revolving. The Fates, Sirens, and Spindle are used in the &quot;Republic&quot;, partly to help explain how known celestial bodies revolved around the Earth according to the cosmology in the &quot;Republic&quot;.

The &quot;Spindle of Necessity&quot;, according to Plato, is &quot;shaped... like the ones we know&quot;—the standard Greek spindle, consisting of a hook, shaft, and whorl. The hook was fixed near the top of the shaft on its long side. On the other end resided the whorl. The hook was used to spin the shaft, which in turn spun the whorl on the other end. 

Placed on the whorl of his celestial spindle were 8 &quot;orbits&quot;, whereof each created a perfect circle. Each &quot;orbit&quot; is given different descriptions by Plato.

Based on Plato&#x27;s descriptions within the passage, the orbits can be identified as those of the classical planets, corresponding to the Aristotelian planetary spheres:

*Orbit 1 – Stars
*Orbit 2 – Saturn
*Orbit 3 – Jupiter
*Orbit 4 – Mars
*Orbit 5 – Sun
*Orbit 6 – Venus
*Orbit 7 – Mercury
*Orbit 8 – Moon

The descriptions of the rims accurately fit the relative distance and revolution speed of the respective bodies as would appear to an observer from Earth (aside from the Moon, which revolves around the Earth slightly more slowly than the sun).

==Comparative mythology==

Some scholars have connected the Myth of Er to the Armenian legend of Ara the Handsome (Armenian: Արա Գեղեցիկ Ara Gełec‘ik). In the Armenian story, the king Ara was so handsome that the Assyrian queen Semiramis waged war against Armenia to capture him and bring him back to her, alive, so she could marry him. During the battle, Semiramis was victorious, but Ara was slain despite her orders to capture him alive. To avoid continuous warfare with the Armenians, Semiramis, reputed to be a sorceress, took Ara&#x27;s body and prayed to the gods to raise him from the dead. When the Armenians advanced to avenge their leader, Semiramis disguised one of her lovers as Ara and spread the rumor that the gods had brought Ara back to life, convincing the Armenians not to continue the war. In one tradition, Semiramis&#x27; prayers are successful and Ara returns to life.

Armen Petrosyan suggests that Plato&#x27;s version reflects an earlier form of the story where Er (Ara) rises from the grave.

<text>Lycksele (; ; Ume Sami: ) is a locality and the seat of Lycksele Municipality in Västerbotten County, province of Lapland, Sweden with 8,513 inhabitants in 2010.

==History==
Until the 1600s there were no settled communities in southern Lapland. The area was used as grazing land by the forest Sami but had no permanent population. As the Swedish government sought to strengthen its position, the need for permanent meeting places arose. Churches and marketplaces were established at these locations, where Sami, traders, and settlers could meet. Additionally, taxes were also collected there.

This took place on a peninsula in the Ume River, upstream from the present city center, at Öhn (now known as Gammplatsen, which had previously served as a major winter settlement for the Sami in the area). Öhn was designated as a church and marketplace in southern Lapland by Charles IX in 1607, and Lycksele thus celebrated its 400th anniversary in 2007.

As the settlement expanded around the church, it became clear that the relatively small peninsula was no longer suitable for further growth. In 1785, the parish assembly decided to build a new church and moved the marketplace to a location known as Heden a bit downstream. In 1926, Lycksele was granted municipal status (Lycksele köping), two years after the section of the railway line between Hällnäs and Storuman was completed. The remaining section to Storuman was finished in 1930. Lycksele was granted city rights in 1946, becoming the first city in Lapland. The town is often referred to as &quot;Lappstockholm&quot; and markets itself as &quot;the city in Lapland,&quot; highlighting both its status as Lapland&#x27;s first city and its early importance as a meeting place.

After the arrival of the railway, Lycksele developed into a typical small town with smaller industries and important public institutions such as a hospital, a high school, and a district court. The first Swedish Sami school, &quot;Skytteanska skolan&quot;, was built here already in 1634.

After a population peak in the 1970s, the town&#x27;s population declined, but this trend has recently slowed due to the expanding mining industry. However, the town still faces depopulation, although perhaps to a slightly lesser extent than comparable towns in the interior of Norrland. In the year 2000, Lycksele had 8,692 residents. Five years later, the number had decreased to 8,597.

==Sports==

<text>Jokkmokk (; or ; ; ; ) is a locality and the seat of Jokkmokk Municipality in Norrbotten County, province of Lapland, Sweden, with 2,786 inhabitants in 2010. The Lule Sami name of the place (composed of the individual words and ) means &quot;River&#x27;s Curve,&quot; due to the meandering river that runs through it. As in other towns in Lapland, the Swedish language is dominant at an official level in Jokkmokk in modern times. The settlement is just north of the Arctic Circle. Talvatissjön is located at the southern part of Jokkmokk.

Jokkmokk is an important locality for Sámi people and the location of several institutions related to them, including an education centre, the Ájtte museum, and an office of the Sámi Parliament of Sweden.

Jokkmokk was a transit center for Sami refugees from Norway during World War II, in addition to the centre in Kjesäter.

Jokkmokk Market has been taking place since 1605. On the first Thursday in February every year, thousands of people gather in the town for concerts, exhibitions and trade in one of the most important social events for the Sámi people in Sápmi. Temperatures during the festival can drop as low as . 

== Climate ==
Influenced by its inland and northerly position, Jokkmokk&#x27;s variety of a subarctic climate (Dfc) is very cold by Swedish standards. Summers are normally relatively mild, with midnight sun, and the dark winters are long and cold, although polar night is not quite observed with a sun angle of 0.4° at the winter solstice. Combining an elevation of with being at the foot of the Scandinavian Mountains, Jokkmokk is both cooled down during the day and experiences temperature inversion during night. This combination makes it the coldest municipal seat in Sweden in terms of winter temperatures, although some rural localities in Lapland are even colder.

<doc id="1017807" wikidata="Q259046" url="?curid=1017807" title="Gällivare">
<text>Gällivare (; ; or ; or ; ) is a locality and the seat of Gällivare Municipality in Norrbotten County, province of Lapland, Sweden with 8,449 inhabitants in 2010. The town was founded in the 17th century. Together with nearby towns Malmberget and Koskullskulle it forms a conurbation with some 15,000 inhabitants.

Gällivare is situated at the northern end of the Inlandsbanan railway line, about 60 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle. Gällivare is located in a major iron ore mining region.
Adjacent to Gällivare (about five kilometres) is Malmberget, known as a site for iron ore extraction from deep mines by LKAB. In addition Aitik, one of Europe&#x27;s largest open pit copper mines, is operated just twenty kilometers away by Boliden AB.

Outside Gällivare lies the ski resort Dundret, which is equipped with six ski lifts and ten groomed slopes along with a conference center and hotel. The ski season stretches from the end of October all the way into early May. The town has been host for several World Cup skiing events, both alpine and cross-country. Around the town roughly 130km (13 Swedish miles) of nordic skiing tracks are maintained and freely accessible.

Gällivare is the center of the Firstborn Laestadian movement.
It was the host town for the 2008 VIVA World Cup and also the filming spot for Avicii&#x27;s single &quot;Addicted to You&quot;. Sweden&#x27;s second-largest fast food chain, Max Hamburgers, was founded in Gällivare, though the headquarters have since relocated to Luleå.

== History ==
Gällivare&#x27;s history as a settlement date back to the 1690s, when iron ore was discovered in the mountain &quot;Illuvare&quot;, which came to be known as &quot;Gällivare malmberg&quot;. The find was located in what is now Malmberget, where test mining began in 1735. At that time, the population in the area was largely composed of Sámi belonging to the &quot;Kaitum&quot; Sámi community. Since 1605, they had had their church in Jokkmokk, but in the early 18th century, the Swedish parliament received rumors that they had not yet been fully Christianized. 

In 1738, the parliament therefore decided that a new church should be established closer to the Kaitum Sámi, with each household in Sweden contributing one öre silver coin. In 1742, missionaries Pehr Högström and Petrus Holmbom traveled around Kaitum and, together with the Sámi, decided that Easter should be celebrated near Gällivare malmberg. There, they also placed the church that was built two years later from the collected coins, &quot;Ettöreskyrkan&quot; (Gällivare Old Church).

In connection with the church, Gällivare developed as a settlement in tandem with the commercial extraction of ore in Malmberget, which began in the 1740s. The major boost came with the construction of the Malmbanan railway in the late 19th century, which greatly facilitated ore transportation. In 1910, a hospital was also established in Gällivare.

== Climate ==
As expected given its high latitude, Gällivare has a rather cold climate. Under the Köppen climate classification it is a subarctic climate (Dfc). Winters are very severe by Scandinavian standards, but are somewhat moderated by marine air from the North Atlantic. As a result, certain cities on the North American Great Plains such as Winnipeg and Grand Forks, along with East Asian cities even further south, have colder January averages than Gällivare. The winter temperature varies greatly due to the city&#x27;s location between the open ocean and a large, snow-covered land mass, and can be one day to the next.

Gällivare experiences midnight sun for a significant period of summer, though sees some glimpses of daylight even during the winter solstice due to its notable distance from the Arctic Circle. As a result of prolonged warming from early morning by the midnight sun and Gällivare&#x27;s inland position, temperatures can occasionally get hot in the summer. The all-time high stands at .

== High incidence of congenital insensitivity to pain ==
Some inhabitants near Gällivare, mainly in the village of Tjautjas (also Tjautjasjaure or Čavččas) 20 km outside Gällivare, have a remarkably high incidence of congenital insensitivity to pain, an extremely rare disease which inhibits the sensation of pain, heat and cold. There have been nearly 40 reported cases in the area.

<text>Arjeplog (; Pite Sami: ) is a locality and the seat of Arjeplog Municipality in Norrbotten County, province of Lapland, Sweden with 1,977 inhabitants in 2010.

It is a popular winter test site for the Asian and European car industries and featured on an episode of the British TV show &quot;Top Gear&quot;.

Arjeplog has in the past offered families 100,000 kronor, or individuals 25,000 kronor to move to the town.

== History ==
The name, first recorded in 1636 as the name of the Sami village and in 1640 as the church and marketplace, is a Swedish adaptation of &quot;Árjepluovve&quot;. The suffix is &quot;pluovve&quot;, meaning &#x27;wet marsh,&#x27; while the prefix contains the genitive of (&quot;h&quot;)&quot;árijje&quot;, meaning &#x27;ridge&#x27;.

Arjeplog is known for, among other things, &quot;the Lapland doctor&quot; Einar Wallquist&#x27;s creation, the Silver Museum, which was inaugurated in 1965. Arjeplog is a church village in the Arjeplog parish that, when the 1862 municipal reform was implemented in Lapland, formed Arjeplog Rural Municipality in 1874. The Rural Municipality was, in 1971, transformed without changes into Arjeplog Municipality with Arjeplog as the central locality.

==Climate==
Arjeplog has a subarctic climate (Dfc) typical of northern Sweden. Its winters are somewhat moderated by the mild maritime North Atlantic air to the west, although they are still very cold, long and snowy. Summers are short but can occasionally be warm and they are also very bright due to Arjeplog&#x27;s position close to the Arctic Circle. Daylight is sparse in winter, but during summer midnight sun is present for three weeks. For an even longer period than that it does not get dark in Arjeplog. The presence of the midnight sun is in spite of Arjeplog being below the Arctic Circle, and is caused by the sun&#x27;s trajectory not quite dropping below 0° in angle. As it is below the line Arjeplog does not experience complete lack of daylight during the winter solstice, but it is limited to less than three hours.

Arjeplog is located on the lake of Hornavan, that freezes over every winter due to the cold temperatures, whereas the lake temperatures remain cool also in summer.

<text>The Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO; ) is a private research institution in peace and conflict studies, based in Oslo, Norway, with around 100 employees. It was founded in 1959 by a group of Norwegian researchers led by Johan Galtung, who was also the institute&#x27;s first director (1959–1969). It publishes the &quot;Journal of Peace Research&quot;, also founded by Johan Galtung.

==History and governance==
PRIO was founded in 1959 by a group of Norwegian researchers led by Johan Galtung. The institute originally was a department of the Norwegian Institute for Social Research in Oslo and became an independent institute in 1966. It was one of the first centres of peace research in the world, and it is Norway&#x27;s only peace research institute. The institute&#x27;s director since 2017 is Henrik Urdal, with Torunn Tryggestad as deputy director. Since 2005, the institute has been located in the former gas works building in central Oslo.

PRIO is an independent foundation, governed by a seven-member board. The board includes two PRIO employees, two members appointed by the Research Council of Norway, one member appointed by the Institute for Social Research, one by the University of Oslo, and one by the Nordic International Studies Association.

Previous PRIO directors are, chronologically, Johan Galtung (1959–69), Asbjørn Eide (1970, 1980–81), Helge Hveem (1971), Nils Petter Gleditsch (1972, 1977–78), Kjell Skjelsbæk (1973–74), Ole Kristian Holthe (1975–76), Tord Høivik (1979–80, 1984–86), Marek Thee (1981–83), Sverre Lodgaard (1986–92), Hilde Henriksen Waage (const., 1992–93), Dan Smith (1993–2001), Stein Tønnesson (2001–09), Kristian Berg Harpviken (2009–2017), and Henrik Urdal (2017–present). After Galtung&#x27;s resignation in 1969, the institute staff elected a leader for one year at a time. In 1986 this was changed to a three-year period, and again in 1993 to a maximum of two consecutive four-year periods.

PRIOs first chairman of the board was Erik Rinde (1966–79), director of Institute for Social Research. He was succeeded by Torstein Eckhoff (1979–1986), Bernt Bull (1987–94), Frida Nokken (1995–2000), Helge Pharo (2000–2003), Øyvind Østerud (2004–06), Bernt Aardal (2007–2016) and Åslaug Marie Haga (2016 – present).

PRIO is mainly funded by the Research Council of Norway and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with some additional funding from the Ministry of Defence, various international organisations such as the World Bank and the European Union, and private foundations. PRIO has around 100 employees. Its headquarters are located in central Oslo.

== Research ==
The institute&#x27;s purpose, as formulated in the statutes, is &quot;to engage in research concerning the conditions for peaceful relations between nations, groups and individuals&quot;. Researchers come from a variety of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities, including political science, sociology, anthropology, psychology, human geography, history, history of religion, and philosophy. Output from the research is primarily published as articles in peer-reviewed academic journals, anthologies or monographs, but also as more policy-oriented reports and papers such as PRIO&#x27;s in-house series.

Approximately 15 percent of the institute&#x27;s budget is made up of a core grant from the Research Council of Norway, and the remaining 85 per cent is funded on project basis. The two largest project funders are the Research Council of Norway and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Other funders include the European Union, the World Bank, and the Norwegian Ministry of Defence. In 2009, PRIO initiated the founding of the US based Peace Research Endowment.

In Oslo, PRIO hosted the Norwegian Initiative on Small Arms Transfers, which was shut down in 2017 due to lack of funding. This was a joint initiative of PRIO, the Norwegian Red Cross and the Norwegian Church Aid to help block the spread of small arms to areas where they are likely to be used in warfare, armed violence or human rights abuses.

The staff comprises a core group of 40-50 full-time researchers and support staff. In addition, there are researchers with a part-time affiliation with PRIO, visiting scholars, interns and students.

===Research centres===
;Centre for the Study of Civil War
From 2003 to 2012, PRIO hosted the Centre for the Study of Civil War, one of the original 13 &quot;Centres of Excellence&quot; in Norway. The director for the full 10-year period was Scott Gates.

;Cyprus Centre
The institute maintains a centre in Nicosia, Cyprus, known as the PRIO Cyprus Centre. Through its network, projects and dialogue forums, the PRIO Cyprus Centre aims to foster cooperation between Greek and Turkish Cypriots and strengthen regional cooperation in the Eastern Mediterranean at large.

;Centre on Gender, Peace and Security
In 2015, PRIO established their Centre on Gender, Peace and Security, which is engaged in research in gender and conflict studies. In particular, the centre studies issues like sexual violence in conflict situations, women&#x27;s representation in mediation and post-conflict settlements, and gender security.

==Journals==
PRIO owns two academic journals, both edited at the institute and published by SAGE Publications: &quot;Journal of Peace Research&quot;, edited by Scott Gates, and &quot;Security Dialogue&quot;, edited by Mark B. Salter.

== Education ==

PRIO provides a limited number of education services. The Research School on Peace and Conflict has been a multidisciplinary training center, where a number of courses are taught by visiting scholars. Partner institutions include the University of Oslo and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Until 2020 this was a Research School funded Research School which took up members and focused on courses concentrating on academic writing, research methodology and topical issues. Since 2020 PRIO has offered PhD level courses on an individual basis and ceased accepting members.

Until 2013, PRIO and Bjørknes College provided joint master&#x27;s degree programs with Australian National University and the University of Stellenbosch in international political economy and conflict dynamics, as well as peace and conflict studies.

==PRIO Annual Peace Address==
Initiated in 2010, the PRIO Annual Peace Address intends to create awareness, stir public debate and increase understanding about the conditions for peace in the world. Inviting researchers and other people with strong views on peace-related topics, the idea is to challenge the peace research community by suggesting new measures and bringing new perspectives on peace and war.

<doc id="1017819" wikidata="Q3323539" url="?curid=1017819" title="Mookie Wilson">
<text>William Hayward &quot;Mookie&quot; Wilson (born February 9, 1956) is an American former Major League Baseball outfielder and coach who played for the New York Mets and Toronto Blue Jays over 12 major league seasons. He is best remembered as the Met who hit the ground ball that rolled through Bill Buckner&#x27;s legs in the bottom of the 10th inning of game six of the 1986 World Series.

A switch hitter with excellent speed, his positive attitude and hustle immediately endeared him to a Mets fan base with precious few stars to root for when he first came up in the early s. He was enshrined in the New York Mets Hall of Fame in .

==Early life==
Born in Bamberg, South Carolina, William Hayward Wilson was nicknamed &quot;Mookie&quot; as a small child. He pitched for the Bamberg-Ehrhardt High School Red Raiders baseball team under coach David Horton.

===College===
In the mid-s, South Carolina State University, a program located in Orangeburg, South Carolina, and near Wilson&#x27;s hometown, discontinued its baseball program just days after Wilson had signed a letter of intent to play for the Bulldogs. As a result, Mookie attended Spartanburg Methodist College for the and seasons. While attending Spartanburg Methodist, Mookie was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the fourth round of the January amateur draft, but did not sign. Instead, Mookie transferred to play for The University of South Carolina Gamecocks, preferring to attempt to better his draft stock by playing for former New York Yankees great and fellow South Carolina native Bobby Richardson, who was the head coach of the Gamecocks at the time. The gamble paid off as Wilson was selected in the second round of the 1977 Major League Baseball draft by the New York Mets. Mookie was part of the Gamecocks&#x27; second team to play for a national championship in Omaha, Nebraska, in the 1977 College World Series. He was also named to the All-Tournament team as an outfielder. Wilson earned a B.S. degree from Mercy College.

==Playing career==
===New York Mets===

====International League Rookie of the Year====
Wilson batted .284 with 22 home runs, 184 runs batted in, and 160 stolen bases in four seasons in the Mets&#x27; farm system, and earned International League Rookie of the Year honors in . After stealing 50 bases and scoring 92 runs for the Tidewater Tides in , Mookie was called up to the majors when rosters expanded that September. Though he got off to a slow start (0 for his first 8), manager Joe Torre stuck with Wilson in center field for 26 of the 31 games remaining on the Mets&#x27; schedule.

====Mets stolen base king====

Wilson again got off to a slow start in , with his batting average dipping to .203 on May 24. When Torre shifted Lee Mazzilli, who had been the Mets&#x27; center fielder and the face of the organization since his rookie year in , to left field to make room for Mookie in center, he began to turn it around. He ended the first half of the strike-shortened season at .288 with 11 stolen bases, 21 runs scored and a .340 on-base percentage leading off for the Mets.

His average dipped to .259 in the second half; however, he still stole 13 bases and scored 28 runs. Two of the three home runs he hit in 1981 came in the second half, and both were of the game winning dramatic variety. On August 25, he hit a ninth-inning homer off Houston Astros closer Joe Sambito to carry the Mets to a 2–1 win. On September 20, he took St. Louis Cardinals closer and future Hall of Famer Bruce Sutter deep with Frank Taveras on first for the come from behind victory. With Wilson and fellow rookie Hubie Brooks now at the top of the Mets&#x27; lineup, the perennial cellar dwellers managed to compete in the second half of the season, finishing 5.5 games back of the National League East division winning Montreal Expos.

Mookie became a fixture atop the Mets&#x27; lineup through , and was soon himself the face of the organization. In , he stole at least one base in each of his first five games on his way to breaking Frank Taveras&#x27; team record with 58 stolen bases. He passed Mazzilli to become the team&#x27;s all-time stolen base leader in 1984 (he has since been passed in both categories by José Reyes).

Wilson suffered the first injury of his career in , missing two months of the season after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder. He returned in September, but in a very limited role. The second major injury of his career came the following spring, when Mets shortstop Rafael Santana nailed Wilson in the eye with a thrown ball during base running drills. Wilson needed to be carted off the field and required 21 stitches.

When he returned in May , he was used more frequently in left field, as Lenny Dykstra was batting .300 as the Mets&#x27; new lead-off hitter and center fielder. Regardless of the negative effect the eye injury had upon his vision, he posted a respectable .979 fielding percentage, with seven assists, while committing just five errors splitting time between left and center. He also batted .289 with nine home runs, 25 stolen bases and 45 RBI as the Mets won first place in the NL East by 21.5 games over the Philadelphia Phillies.

====1986 World Series====

In the postseason for the first time in his career, Wilson batted just .115 in the 1986 National League Championship Series against the Houston Astros. However, he scored the only run allowed by NLCS MVP Mike Scott in game four of the series, and drove in and scored a run in the ninth inning of game six when the Mets scored three runs in their last at bat to send the game into extra innings. He was batting a far better .273 in the World Series when he came to the plate in the tenth inning of game six.

The Boston Red Sox scored twice in the top of the tenth inning to go up 5–3 in a series they led three games to two. After retiring Wally Backman and Keith Hernandez, Red Sox relief pitcher Calvin Schiraldi surrendered singles to the next three batters to bring the score to 5–4 with runners on first and third. With Wilson stepping up to the plate, Bob Stanley replaced Schiraldi on the mound. During his ten pitch at-bat, Wilson avoided being hit by a wild pitch that scored Kevin Mitchell from third and tied the score. Three pitches later, he hit a slow roller to Bill Buckner at first base. Aware of Wilson&#x27;s speed, Buckner tried to rush the play. As a result, the ball rolled beside his glove, through his legs and into right field, allowing Ray Knight to score the winning run from second base. The play is often known as the &quot;Buckner play&quot; and is blamed on the first baseman, but Wilson&#x27;s smart at-bat and speed also affected the course of events. (If Buckner had made that play and Wilson had been safe, Howard Johnson would have been the next batter with runners on first and third. If Wilson had been put out by Buckner, the game would have gone into an 11th inning.)

Wilson went one for three in game seven, scoring one of three runs the Mets plated in the sixth inning while trailing 3–0. The Mets went on to win the 1986 World Series.

====Mets crowded outfield====
The Mets acquired Kevin McReynolds to play left field prior to the start of the season, creating something of a logjam in their outfield. Both Wilson and Dykstra expressed displeasure with the situation, with Wilson going so far as to request a trade. His trade request went ungranted, and Mookie went on to post a career high .299 batting average platooning with Dykstra in center.

Mookie was having his poorest major league season in . Through 104 games on the Mets&#x27; schedule, he was batting .234 with three home runs, 19 RBIs and 31 runs scored. Regardless, the Mets were still in first place in the NL East by four games over the Pittsburgh Pirates.

From there, he went on a tear; from August 3 to the end of the season, Mookie batted .385 with five home runs, 22 RBIs and 30 runs scored. He all but single-handedly beat the Pirates on September 5, matching his career high with four RBIs to give the Mets a ten-game lead in their division.

They went on to win 100 games that season, and win the division by 15 games. The Mets faced the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1988 National League Championship Series, whom they had a 10–1 record against in 1988. Despite their regular season dominance over the Dodgers, the Mets lost the series in seven games. Wilson appeared in four games and collected two hits in 13 at bats.

Mookie could have become a free agent at the end of the 1988 season; however, the Mets picked up the option they had on his contract. He started the season batting just .199 through 52 games when the Mets acquired Juan Samuel from the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for Dykstra and Roger McDowell with the intention of having Samuel take over as the Mets&#x27; new everyday center fielder and lead-off hitter.

===Toronto Blue Jays===
On July 31, the same day the Toronto Blue Jays selected Lee Mazzilli off waivers from the Mets, they also acquired Mookie Wilson, for reliever Jeff Musselman and minor league pitcher Mike Brady. Mookie Wilson was immediately plugged into the starting lineup, as right fielder Junior Felix had separated his shoulder against the right-field wall the previous day in Yankee Stadium.

After a slow start (6-for-40 in his first 10 games), Mookie Wilson came alive when he returned to Boston for the first time since the 1986 World Series. Mookie went 9-for-14 with four runs scored and an RBI in the Jays&#x27; three-game sweep at Fenway Park. From there, they travelled to Baltimore to face the first place Orioles. Mookie Wilson hit his first home run as an American Leaguer, as the Jays took two out of three from their division rivals. In all, he batted .432 over the rest of the month to help his new team jump into a first place tie with the Baltimore Orioles in the American League East. On September 1, Mookie Wilson went three for four with a run and an RBI against a trio of Minnesota Twins pitchers to help the Jays attain sole possession of first place. On September 30, with the Jays trailing 3–1 to the Orioles, Mookie Wilson singled in a run, and eventually came around to score the winning run in the Jays&#x27; division clinching game.

The Jays returned to the postseason for the first time since 1985, but were handily defeated by the heavily favored AL champion Oakland Athletics in the 1989 American League Championship Series, four games to one. Mookie Wilson went two for four with an RBI and run scored in the Jays&#x27; game three victory.

After the season, Mookie Wilson signed a two-year deal to stay with the Jays as their starting center fielder. He logged 629 plate appearances in , his most since . At 34 years old, Mookie Wilson still stole 23 bases and hit four triples.

He relinquished the starting center field job to Devon White in , and was part of a revolving door of left fielders employed by manager Cito Gaston. The system worked, as the Jays won their division by seven games over the Red Sox. In the postseason for the fourth time in six years, Mookie Wilson appeared in three of the five 1991 American League Championship Series games. He went two for eight with a walk.

The option was not picked up on Wilson&#x27;s contract after the season. He nearly signed with the Red Sox for the season, but the Sox chose to go with Herm Winningham instead. When no one else contacted Wilson, he retired.

===Career statistics===

In 25 postseason games (1 World Series, 1 NLCS, 1 ALCS) Wilson hit .207 (19-for-92) with 10 runs, 4 RBI, 6 stolen bases and 7 walks.

==Post-playing career==
From 1996–, Wilson served as the Mets&#x27; first-base coach. In and , he managed the Rookie League Kingsport Mets team, and in , Wilson managed the single-A Brooklyn Cyclones.

After serving as the organization&#x27;s baserunning coordinator, Wilson returned as first-base coach in . He moved into a front office job after the season, and was replaced at first base by Tom Goodwin. In , he managed the U.S. Team in the All-Star Futures Game held at Citi Field.

==Personal life==
The Mets drafted Wilson&#x27;s brother John in the 17th round of the 1982 amateur draft. A speedster like his brother, John stole 56 bases for the Columbia Mets of the South Atlantic League in 1984. Mookie also has a brother, Phil, who played minor league ball for the Minnesota Twins and Montreal Expos. Another brother, Richard, is the biological father of former major league outfielder Preston Wilson. On June 22, 1978, Mookie Wilson married Preston&#x27;s mother, Rosa Gilbert, making him both Preston&#x27;s stepfather and uncle. Wilson was an outfielder for the Texas League Class AA Jackson Mets at the time of the wedding. The ceremony was conducted at the home plate of Smith-Wills Stadium in Jackson, Mississippi, before a hometown crowd of 1,200 and included an archway of bats held aloft by Wilson&#x27;s teammates for the bride and groom&#x27;s procession.

Wilson earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1996 from Mercy College in New York. He has been a resident of Lakewood Township, New Jersey, where he and his wife started an educational center for girls, &quot;Mookie&#x27;s Roses&quot;, in 1986.

In 2001, Wilson and his family released a gospel CD entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry, the Lord will Carry You Through&quot;.

Wilson became an ordained Baptist minister in 2014.

<text>The Mayo Clinic Hospital – Rochester is a 2,059-bed teaching hospital located in Rochester, Minnesota. It comprises the Saint Marys Campus with its Mayo Eugenio Litta Children&#x27;s Hospital, as well as its Methodist Campus, forming an integral part of the Mayo Clinic academic medical center. Mayo Clinic Hospital – Rochester is ranked first on the 2019–20 U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Hospitals Honor Roll.

==History==
Saint Marys Hospital was founded in 1889 by a local Franciscan religious community, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Rochester, Minnesota, led by Mother Alfred Moes. Five buildings at the Saint Marys Campus are named to honor Saint Marys&#x27; foundress and first administrator, Mother Alfred, and four Sisters who previously served as hospital administrators: Sisters Joseph, Domitilla, Mary Brigh and Generose. The Francis Building honors the many Franciscan Sisters who have served since the founding of Saint Marys.

Originally, the name was spelled &quot;Saint Mary&#x27;s Hospital&quot;, as can be seen in stone above the old front entrance, but in recent years the apostrophe is usually omitted.

In January 2014, Saint Marys and Rochester Methodist were consolidated under the name &quot;Mayo Clinic Hospital – Rochester&quot;.

==Saint Marys Campus==

The Mayo Clinic Hospital – Rochester, Saint Marys Campus has 1,265 licensed beds and 64 operating rooms. In 2008, there were 63,000 admissions as well as 28,000 surgical cases that took place in the hospital. The Mayo Clinic Psychiatry and Psychology Treatment Center in the Generose Building is also part of the campus. St. Marys Hospital campus includes the nation&#x27;s largest intensive care unit, which includes about 200 ICU beds and 200 &quot;step-down&quot; ICU beds.

The hospital is accredited as a Level I trauma center and stroke center. It is the seat of the Southern Minnesota Regional Trauma Advisory Committee, serving a population of almost 900,000.

Saint Marys has a more than 76-bed emergency department but no obstetrics department, while Rochester Methodist lacks an emergency department but contains an obstetrics department. Saint Marys Hospital Emergency Department provides care for approximately 80,000 patients per year, serving the local population (constituting about 85% of patients) and being a referral for southern and central Minnesota, northern Iowa and western Wisconsin through Mayo One medical helicopter service. The Emergency Department includes a state of the art electronic all comprehensive patient flow system (known as &quot;Yes&quot;), 6 large trauma bays, universal (ICU capable) rooms, dedicated pediatric area, high acuity beds, 9 bed observation unit, fast-track/intake, slit lamp room, 4 psychiatry-specific beds, acclimatized ambulance entrance and garage. St Marys also has a multiple dedicated trauma/surgical ICU&#x27;s and hybrid operating rooms to provide the highest level of trauma care for the surrounding community.

=== Mayo Eugenio Litta Children&#x27;s Hospital ===
The Saint Marys Campus houses the 148-bed Mayo Eugenio Litta Children&#x27;s Hospital, offering multidisciplinary pediatric and adolescent care to infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0–21. Mayo Clinic Children&#x27;s Center includes providers from over 40 medical and surgical specialties. The new hospital was opened in 1996 at a cost of $13 million. The hospital was named after Eugenio Litta, a 14-year-old boy who died from a ruptured appendix. The hospital ranks nationally in 6 different pediatric specialties.

==Methodist Campus==
The Mayo Clinic Hospital – Rochester, Methodist Campus has 794 licensed beds and 51 operating rooms. The campus includes the Richard O. Jacobson Building, home to the proton beam therapy program.

== Rankings ==
In 2016–17, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, was ranked as the #1 overall hospital in the United States by U.S. News &amp; World Report. A total of almost 5,000 hospitals were considered and ranked in 16 specialties from cancer and heart disease to respiratory disorders and urology; 153 (just over 3 percent of the total) were ranked in at least one of the 16 specialties. Of the 153 hospitals that are ranked in one or more specialties, 20 qualified for the Honor Roll by earning high scores in at least six specialties. Mayo Clinic, Rochester, was ranked in the top 10 in all but one of 16 specialties, in the top 4 in 13 specialties, and was the #1 ranked hospital in 8 of the 12 data-driven specialties. This year U.S. News expanded their common procedures and conditions list to 9 individual measures, and Mayo was one of fewer than 70 hospitals to score High Performing in every category. Additionally, Mayo was the only hospital on the 2016–2017 honor roll to also receive 5 stars from CMS. Every Mayo Clinic hospital received an &quot;A&quot; safety rating from Leapfrog in its April 2017 report. In 2019–20, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, was ranked again as the #1 overall hospital in the United States by U.S. News &amp; World Report.

<text>The Clement Payne Movement (CPM) is a left-wing Barbados-based political party named in honour of a Trinidad-born man who led a 1937 uprising in Barbados. The Clement Payne Movement is generally seen by most Barbadians as more leftist in ideology when compared with either the more moderate Barbados Labour Party (BLP) or Democratic Labour Party (DLP).

The CPM also seeks the global advancement of Pan-Africanism, and has a strong base in this area located in Barbados. The president of the party is David A. Comissiong and the general secretary is Bobby Clarke.

In the past, on several occasions the leaders of the CPM have publicly appealed to other Caribbean governments not to officially recognize the 2004 US-imposed interim government in Haiti. The party also officially opposes the process known as the Free Trade Area of the Americas.

==History==
The CPM was formed in 1988, when its leading figures included David Commissiong, Martin Cadogan, Leroy Harewood, Trevor Prescod, David Denny and John Howell. The organization is named after Clement Payne, a pioneer in the Caribbean trade union movement, who in 1998 was officially recognized as one of the National Heroes of Barbados. The CPM annually distributes a &quot;Clement Payne Hero’s Award&quot;.

The CPM maintains close contacts with the Communist Party of Cuba, and supports normalised relations with the Republic of Cuba.

<text>Jukkasjärvi (; Sami: &quot;Čohkkiras&quot;) is a locality situated in Kiruna Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden with 548 inhabitants in 2010. It is situated at 321 meters elevation.

The name is of Northern Sami origin, where &quot;Čohkkirasjávri&quot; means &quot;lake of assembly&quot;, as the area by the lake by which the village was founded was a Sami marketplace. The village got its first Finnish-speaking resident settlers in the 17th century, who changed the name into the more Finnish-sounding Jukkasjärvi, thereby removing its meaning, although &quot;järvi&quot; (&quot;jávri&quot; in Sami) still means &quot;lake&quot; in Finnish. This was also the name used by Swedish officials.

The village is a popular tourist accommodation during the winter months, from December until April, and is best known for its annual ice hotel, a hotel literally made from ice.

The wooden church is the oldest building in the village (built around 1607/1608) and is well known for its wooden carved altar piece triptych by Bror Hjorth. It is the only surviving example of a block-pillar church in Sweden.

<doc id="1017833" wikidata="Q1750884" url="?curid=1017833" title="Pancoast tumor">
<text>A Pancoast tumor is a tumor of the apex of the lung. It is a type of lung cancer defined primarily by its location situated at the top end of either the right or left lung. It typically spreads to nearby tissues such as the ribs and vertebrae. Most Pancoast tumors are non-small-cell lung cancers.

The growing tumor can cause compression of many nearby structures, such as the brachiocephalic vein, subclavian artery, phrenic nerve, recurrent laryngeal nerve, vagus nerve, or, characteristically, compression of a sympathetic ganglion (the stellate ganglion), which result in various presenting symptoms, most notably a range of symptoms known as Horner&#x27;s syndrome due to compression of nearby sympathetic nerves.

Pancoast tumors are named for Henry Pancoast, an American radiologist, who first described them in 1924 and 1932.

Though many advances in their treatment have been made since their initial categorization, Pancoast tumors remain difficult to treat due to low rates of possible surgical intervention, therefore prognosis is still poor.

== History ==
The Pancoast tumor was first described by Hare in 1838 as a &quot;tumor involving certain nerves&quot;. It was not until 1924 that the tumor was described in further detail, when Henry Pancoast, a radiologist from Philadelphia, published an article in which he reported and studied many cases of apical chest tumors that all shared the same radiographic findings and associated clinical symptoms, such as pain in the upper extremity following the distribution of the eighth cervical, first and second thoracic nerve trunks, as well as &quot;sympathetic phenomena&quot;. Pancoast went on to publish a second article in 1932 in which a name was finally given to the tumor, &quot;superior pulmonary sulcus tumor&quot;.

== Epidemiology ==
The Pancoast tumor is one of the more rare forms of lung cancer, only accounting for about 3-5% of lung cancer cases, with lung cancer in general being the second most common type of cancer occurring worldwide.

Like most other lung cancers, Pancoast tumors are more often seen in men and older people, with the average age of diagnosis being between 60–70 years old.

==Signs and symptoms==
Aside from constitutional symptoms of cancer such as malaise, fever, weight loss and fatigue, most common initial presentation of a Pancoast tumor is that of shoulder pain and upper back pain, present in up to 96% of patients. Typical lung cancer-related pulmonary symptoms, such as shortness of breath, cough and hemoptysis, are often uncommon during the early stages of the disease due to the tumor&#x27;s peripheral location in the lung.

Typically, other presentations are due to the effects of extension of the tumor into nearby structures, such as ribs, vasculature, and nerves. The results of one of these invasions is the presentation of the Horner&#x27;s syndrome, which can be seen in 15-50% of patients with severe cases when involvement of the paravertebral sympathetic chain and cervical ganglion occur. A complete Horner&#x27;s syndrome consists of ipsilateral miosis (constriction of the pupils), anhidrosis (lack of sweating), ptosis (drooping of the eyelid), and pseudoenophthalmos (as a result of the ptosis). In progressive cases, the brachial plexus is also affected, causing pain and weakness in the muscles of the arm and hand with a symptomatology typical of thoracic outlet syndrome. The tumor can also compress the recurrent laryngeal nerve and from this a hoarse voice and &quot;bovine&quot; (non-explosive) cough may occur.

If obstruction of the superior vena cava by the Pancoast tumor occurs, a resulting mass effect called the superior vena cava syndrome occurs, resulting in facial swelling cyanosis and dilatation of the veins of the head and neck. This syndrome can be seen in 5-10% of patient cases.

When the triad of an ipsilateral Horner&#x27;s syndrome, shoulder/arm pain and weakness of the intrinsic hand muscles occurs, the presentation is called the Pancoast syndrome. This syndrome is due to involvement of brachial plexus roots and that of sympathetic fibers as they exit the cord at T1 and ascend to the superior cervical ganglion.

== Causes and risk factors ==
Due to the location of a Pancoast tumor being in the lung, the main causes are similar to various other causes of lung cancer in general, such as:

* Smoking or secondary smoke exposure
* Exposure to harmful chemicals (radon gas, asbestos, and heavy metals)
* Advanced age
* Male sex

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of a Pancoast tumor can be difficult in the early stages to the similarity of its symptoms with other conditions such as arthritis, with shoulder pain being one of the only symptoms that might indicate further imaging for a patient. Though a chest x-ray is a good screening test and might be the first mode of imaging used, they are not easily seen during the early stages of the disease due to their size and location in the chest.

Following the initial imaging, a CT scan or MRI is preferred since both can provide more details and information such as size, lymph node involvement and other areas of invasion, such as vascular involvement.

A biopsy of the lesion is typically required in order to confirm diagnosis and to provide information regarding histology and molecular markers, which in turn allow to assess for best course of treatment. Currently, the most sensitive method is that of a percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy.

It is important to consider other possible causes with similar physical presentation to the Pancoast tumor. Such conditions to consider as part of a differential diagnosis include:

* Lymphoma
* Hemangiopericytoma
* Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma
* Plasmacytoma
* Mesothelioma
* Pulmonary metastatic malignancies, particularly from the cervix, larynx, liver, bladder, and thyroid gland

===Tumor staging===

Pancoast tumors are staged similarly to most other non-small cell lung cancers using the tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM system) as well as numbers (1-4) to indicate severity. At time of diagnosis, due to difficulty of early detection through imaging, most Pancoast tumors are usually staged at level T3 or T4 due to their invasion of the chest wall and local nerve structures.

== Prognosis ==
Advances in treatment and research have greatly improved survival rates over time, yet due to the later detection of most Pancoast tumors, the prognosis of the disease is still not always favorable and varies depending various factors such as time of detection, extent of invasion of the tumor, lymph node involvement and whether or not the tumor is resectable.

Currently, the five year prognosis on average is about 30% and up to 50% in patients with early-stage and surgically resectable Pancoast tumors. Unfortunately, less than 50% of tumors found in patients are actually surgically resectable, leading to poorer outcomes.

==Treatment and management==

The treatment of a Pancoast lung cancer may differ from that of other types of non-small-cell lung cancer. The current standard of treatment is a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, followed by surgical resection. Though complete tumor resection is recommended, its position and close proximity to vital structures (such as nerves and the spine) may make surgical intervention difficult, with many absolute contraindications present such as tumor invasion of the esophagus/trachea, more than 50% vertebral involvement among a few.

As a result, and depending on the stage of the cancer, treatment may involve radiation therapy and chemotherapy given prior to surgery (neoadjuvant treatment). Surgery may consist of the removal of the upper lobe of a lung together with its associated structures (subclavian artery, vein, branches of the brachial plexus, ribs and vertebral bodies), as well as mediastinal lymphadenectomy. Surgical access may be via thoracotomy from the back or the front of the chest and modifications. Nonsurgical treatment may consist of radiation therapy alone or clinical trials of new combinations of treatment.

<doc id="1017834" wikidata="Q1141140" url="?curid=1017834" title="Little Big Adventure">
<text>Little Big Adventure is a 1994 action-adventure game developed by Adeline Software International. It was published in Europe by Electronic Arts, and by Activision in North America, Asia and Oceania under the name Relentless: Twinsen&#x27;s Adventure. The game was initially released on CD-ROM and some time later on floppy disks; the CD-ROM version features full-motion video, music and speech whereas the floppy disk version has MIDI music files and still images to replace the videos. The game was later ported to the PC-98 and FM Towns and was released in Japan in 1995. It was released for the PlayStation in Japan and Europe in 1996 and 1997 respectively, and to Android and iOS devices in 2014.

In 1997, a PC-only sequel was released under the name of &quot;Little Big Adventure 2&quot; (also known as &quot;Twinsen&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;).

On October 20, 2015, an &quot;Enhanced Edition&quot; developed by DotEmu was released on Steam, alongside a re-release of the original game. In October 2021 both Little Big Adventure 1 and 2 engines source code were released under the GPL.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Little Big Adventure&quot; is a real-time pseudo-3D isometric action-adventure game. All characters and vehicles in the game, including some props in the world, are real 3D polygon-based objects, performing actions within 2D pre-rendered environments. 

&quot;LBA&quot; is a real-time adventure. It combines several action game/arcade sequences and some elements from the role-playing game genre. The game&#x27;s gameplay is partially free-roaming, allowing the player to travel around the islands once they have been &quot;unlocked&quot; by completing certain objectives or solving certain puzzles; there are also many tasks which are optional or non-linear. Certain locations in the game are initially blocked from the player until they progress to a certain stage, such as the islands in the Northern Hemisphere and fortresses on several of the islands in the Southern Hemisphere. &quot;LBA&quot; is set only on the planet of Twinsun but covered the entirety of that world, while its successor &quot;LBA 2&quot; only includes a couple locations (Citadel Island and Desert Island) on Twinsun. While &#x27;LBA 2&quot; is more linear in progression, &quot;LBA&quot; has quests where the player will revisit previously explored locations in both hemispheres.

The player-character, Twinsen, can be switched between four different &quot;behaviour modes&quot; (Normal, Athletic/Sporty, Aggressive, and Discreet), each changing the character&#x27;s abilities and interactions with the game world. Combat in the game is mainly conducted using the Magic Ball, a glowing ball of energy which the player throws towards enemies, the trajectory and angle of the ball changing depending on the mode the player is in. Switching to the &quot;Aggressive&quot; mode also allows Twinsen to engage in combat via punching and kicking. After completion of certain tasks the player is presented with a full-motion video cut-scene. All text in the game is spoken by the characters. Essentially every character in the game is interactive and will respond differently when Twinsen speaks to them. Enemies are often performing tasks while the game world is active. 

The game features an autosave mechanic, which was a departure from the usual manual save system seen in most games of that time.

==Plot==

The game is set on the fictional planet Twinsun, a world which is held in a suspended orbit between two suns resulting in a polar region around its equator. Four different sentient species populate Twinsun: Quetches, Spheros, Grobos, and Rabbibunnies. Quetches are anatomically similar to humans except that they all possess ponytails, Spheros are short spherical creatures, Grobos resemble anthropomorphic elephants, and Rabbibunnies are rabbit-like humanoids. 

In the introduction, it is explained that all peoples of Twinsun have been herded into the Southern hemisphere by a brutal tyrant called Dr FunFrock, who has subjugated the planet by developing an army of clones which travel using teleport machines which he has dispersed around the planet. The player character is a young Quetch named Twinsen, who has been incarcerated in an asylum on the fortress-like Citadel Island because of his prophetic dreams about the end of the world.

Twinsen escapes from the asylum and returns to his house which he shares with his girlfriend Zoe. When Dr FunFrock&#x27;s clones arrive to re-arrest him, Zoe hides Twinsen from them and is arrested herself. As Twinsen travels between the islands of the planet, seeking to find a way of overcoming FunFrock&#x27;s clone army and freeing Zoe, he discovers that his strange dreams are in fact part of the Prophecy, a legendary tale regarding a being known as Sendell who is said to inhabit the core of the planet and watch over the people of Twinsun. Twinsen&#x27;s dreams are in fact telepathic messages sent by Sendell, who chose his ancestors to help her watch over the planet centuries prior and is now contacting Twinsen (as the current descendant of his family line) to warn the inhabitants of the planet of the danger posed by FunFrock. Realising that finding FunFrock and fulfilling the Prophecy is the only way to recover Zoe, Twinsen recovers artifacts from various locales in the Southern Hemisphere in order to boost his magic power which enables him to fight FunFrock&#x27;s clones.

Twinsen teams up with a group of rebels resisting the rule of FunFrock. Accompanying the rebels when they attack FunFrock&#x27;s polar fortress to liberate a rebel officer held in captivity, this gains Twinsen passage through to the Northern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, FunFrock has established mutant and teleportation facilities enabling him to quell unrest anywhere on the planet. Twinsen sabotages these facilities at the bequest of locals disenchanted with FunFrock&#x27;s rule, and in return they help him break into FunFrock&#x27;s main fortress where clones are produced. There, Twinsen finds Zoe seemingly locked in a jail, but she is revealed to be a clone created by FunFrock as bait, and FunFrock reveals that with Twinsen safely locked up where he cannot fulfil his part of the Prophecy, FunFrock is free to drill through to the Well of Sendell, deep in the planet&#x27;s core, where he hopes to encounter Sendell and gain the godly powers she possesses for himself.
Twinsen escapes from the clutches of FunFrock&#x27;s clones and succeeds in blowing the fortress up, clearing the way for him to fight through FunFrock&#x27;s construction workers to reach the Well of Sendell. FunFrock waits with Zoe at the entrance to the Well, since his drilling operations cannot break through the Well&#x27;s seal, telling Twinsen that he&#x27;ll spare Twinsen and Zoe if he opens the Well for FunFrock to advance and reach Sendell. Twinsen pushes FunFrock off the side of a cliff during a sword fight and opens the Well in order to complete the Prophecy, inadvertently allowing a surviving FunFrock access as well. Twinsen defeats FunFrock in a final confrontation, and him and Zoe encounter Sendell, a being appearing to consist purely of glowing electrical energy, who thanks them for saving a gestalt entity which she is protecting in the core of the planet. Sendell uses her powers to allow Twinsen and Zoe to fly back to the surface, where the inhabitants of the planet have prepared a celebration in Twinsen&#x27;s honour.

===Characters===

Twinsen is the hero of the game. The chosen one of the planet, heir to its prophecy, he must gather magical objects and sabotage FunFrock&#x27;s reign. He is voiced by Sylvain Caruso in French, and Dana Westberg in English.

Zoe is Twinsen&#x27;s girlfriend. She is captured by two Grobo clones shortly after Twinsen escapes from the asylum. Near the end of the game, Twinsen rescues what he thinks is Zoe, but turns out to be a clone. Twinsen rescues the real Zoe at the very end of the game. She is voiced by Julie Bataille in French, and Trish Kessler-Caffrey in English.

Jerome Baldino (better known as Baldino) is the local inventor on Proxima Island. He aids Twinsen in the game with his protopack, which the player must use to rob a museum. He only appears for a short time, though he plays a bigger part in &quot;Little Big Adventure 2&quot;. He is voiced by Sylvain Caruso in French, and Christian Erickson in English.

FunFrock is the main antagonist of the game. He is the dictator of Twinsun who controls the planet using three powers: cloning, teleportation and mutant breeding. His true goal is to achieve the God-like status by destroying Sendell, the goddess of the planet. After Twinsen defeats him, the planet is peaceful again, and no longer under the reign of terror. It is revealed in &quot;Little Big Adventure 2&quot; that FunFrock survived. He is voiced by Pierre-Alain de Garrigues in French, and Christian Erickson in English.

Dino-Fly is a dinosaur with wings, roosting on top of Tippet Island. He says he has been waiting for the heir (who is Twinsen) for centuries. He helps Twinsen get to the other islands of the northern hemisphere of Twinsun. He is voiced by Pierre-Alain de Garrigues in French, and Christian Erickson in English.
Sendell is the goddess of Twinsun. She calls Twinsen for help in his dreams, warning him of FunFrock&#x27;s dictatorship. She and other Sendells are watching over a Stellar Entity that is in gestation in the centre of Twinsun. She is seen briefly in the ending cutscene. She is voiced by Julie Bataille in French, and Trish Kessler-Caffrey in English.

==Development==
Frédérick Raynal, ex-Infogrames designer/lead programmer had grown disillusioned with Infogrames reluctance to listen to new ideas and concepts while working on the &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; series, so founded his own development house where he was able to use these new ideas and concepts to create their debut game, &quot;Little Big Adventure&quot;.

In an interview with &quot;Edge&quot; magazine, lead coder Serge Plagnol stated that Electronic Arts US division repeatedly requested that Twinsen be changed into a &quot;much tougher character&quot; and for him to &quot;kick ass&quot;. Adeline Software International refused because the changes wouldn&#x27;t have suited the game&#x27;s story.

The music for the game was composed by Philippe Vachey who also composed music for &quot;Little Big Adventure 2&quot;.

In 1995, Atari Corporation realized a deal with EA to bring titles from their catalog to the Atari Jaguar CD, with &quot;Little Big Adventure&quot; among them but it was never released due to the commercial and critical failure of the Atari Jaguar platform.

In August 2011, co-founder of Adeline Software Didier Chanfray said in an interview that downloadable re-releases of both &quot;Little Big Adventure&quot; and its sequel were &quot;under negotiation&quot;. He also added that a &quot;remix&quot; of the game was being considered for release on touch-pad devices.

On 11 October 2011, the game was re-released for download by GOG, where it is available for both the Windows (XP, Vista, 7) and Mac OS X (10.6.8 or newer) platform.

In December 2011, discussion of a &quot;LBA1&quot; remake was revealed in an interview with Frédérick Raynal, Sébastien Viannay and Didier Chanfray posted on GOG.

On 26 and 27 March 2014 respectively, an Android and iOS version of &quot;Little Big Adventure&quot; were released.

By September 2021, a new installment to the series was announced by a newly formed team named &quot;[2.21]&quot;. It was released in 2024 as a remake of the original game, titled &quot;Little Big Adventure – Twinsen’s Quest&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Little Big Adventure&quot; was a commercial hit, with sales of 320,000 units by February 1997. By August 1999, its global sales had surpassed 500,000 units. However, the game was commercially unsuccessful in the United States, where it sold 30,000 units. Writer Daniel Ichbiah blamed this on Electronic Arts&#x27; &quot;incoherent marketing&quot; of the game, and Frédérick Raynal criticized the publisher&#x27;s decision to give &quot;Little Big Adventure&quot; a more aggressive name and cover artwork, and to portray combat in its advertisements.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; gave the PC version of the game four stars out of five, and said that the game has enough challenge to keep players from start to finish despite noting some puzzles being &quot;light&quot;.

&quot;Little Big Adventure&quot; was named the 38th best computer game ever by &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; in 1997. The editors called it &quot;endearingly entertaining&quot;. In 1996, &quot;GamesMaster&quot; ranked &quot;Little Big Adventure&quot; 91st in their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;.

<text>In aviation, an intersection is a virtual navigational fix that helps aircraft maintain their flight plan. It is usually defined as the intersection (in the geometrical sense) of two VOR (VHF Omnidirectional Range) radials. They are usually identified as major airway intersections where aircraft, operating under instrument flight rules, often change direction of flight while &quot;en route&quot;. According to the Federal Aviation Regulations, some intersections are designated as mandatory reporting points for pilots who are not in radar contact with air traffic control.

Intersections also play an important role in departure and approach procedures. All intersections have an alphabetical or alphanumeric designation. Near major airports, the intersection designation code typically consists of three letters followed by the runway number. Most other intersection designations consist of five-letter combinations that are either pronounceable or chosen for their mnemonic value, since either air traffic control or the flight plan may require the pilot to announce the designation. In the terminal procedure or approach plate example to the right, note that two of the intersections are called DONUT and KOFFE. Many intersections are named because of local points of interest. In the case of Carroll County Airport, there is a popular diner located on the field to which many pilots fly.

<doc id="1017856" wikidata="Q176705" url="?curid=1017856" title="Engine braking">
<text>Engine braking occurs when the retarding forces within an internal combustion engine are used to slow down a motor vehicle, as opposed to using additional external braking mechanisms such as friction brakes or magnetic brakes.

The term is often confused with several other types of braking, most notably compression-release braking or &quot;jake braking&quot; which uses a different mechanism. 

Traffic regulations in many countries require trucks to always drive with an engaged gear, which in turn provides a certain amount of engine braking (viscous losses to the engine oil and air pumped through the engine and friction losses to the cylinder walls and bearings) when no accelerator pedal is applied.

==Engine braking in different engine types==
=== Gasoline engines===
The term &quot;engine braking&quot; refers to the braking effect that occurs in gasoline engines when the accelerator pedal is released. This causes fuel injection to cease and the throttle valve to close almost completely, greatly restricting forced airflow from, for example, a turbocharger. The restriction causes a strong manifold vacuum which the cylinders have to work against, sapping much of the potential energy out of the system over time and producing the majority of the engine-braking effect. This vacuum manifold effect can often be amplified by a down-shift, which induces a faster spinning drivetrain to engage with the engine.

Engine braking is a viable method of controlling the speed at which a vehicle travels downhill. By shifting to a lower gear in a manual transmission, or applying &quot;low&quot; mode on an automatic transmission, engine braking reduces the need to repeatedly apply the foot brake, lowering the risk of the brakes overheating.

While some of the braking force is produced due to friction in the drive train, this is negligible compared to the effect from the manifold vacuum caused by the air-flow restriction. 

On an automatic transmission, engine braking often spontaneously increases the engine RPM, causing a sudden revving to occur even without applying the accelerator pedal.

===Diesel engines===
Diesel engines in personal cars provide little engine braking as they are not equipped with a throttle body and thus cannot draw a vacuum in the intake manifold.

In heavy vehicles the engine is often made to provide extra braking power to take some strain off the vehicle&#x27;s regular brake system and to help avoid overheating the brakes. In its simplest form this consists of a butterfly valve that restricts the exhaust flow. This is referred to as an exhaust brake and mostly found on older trucks. It has a limited effect, and more advanced systems as described below are near universal on newer heavy vehicles.

==== Compression release brake ====

A compression release brake (also known as a Jacobs brake or &quot;jake brake&quot;), is the type of brake most commonly confused with real engine braking; it is used mainly in large diesel trucks and works by opening the exhaust valves at the top of the compression stroke, so the large amount of energy stored in that compressed air is not returned to the crankshaft but is released into the atmosphere. It is very effective method of braking, creating large amounts of braking force which significantly extends friction brake life – a diesel engine can produce up to of braking power at 2,100 RPM.

Normally, during the compression stroke, energy is used as the upward-traveling piston compresses air in the cylinder; the compressed air then acts as a compressed spring and pushes the piston back down. However, with the jake brake in operation, the compressed air is suddenly released just before the piston begins its downward travel (this sudden release of compressed air creates audible sound waves similar to the expanding gases escaping from the muzzle of a firearm). Having lost the energy stored within the compressed air, there is no &quot;spring back&quot; so the engine must expend yet more energy pulling the piston back down again.

This type of brake produces extreme amounts of noise pollution if there is no muffler on the intake manifold of the engine, loud enough to disturb the surrounding area. Anecdotally, it sounds similar to a jackhammer, however, the loudness is between 10 and 20 times the sound pressure level of a jackhammer (10 to 13 dB greater). Numerous cities, municipalities, states, and provinces have banned the use of unmuffled compression brakes, which are typically only legal on roads away from populations. In Australia, traffic enforcement cameras are currently being tested that automatically photograph heavy vehicles that use compression braking.

==== Exhaust brake ====
An exhaust brake works by causing a restriction in the exhaust, much like the intake throttle causes in a gasoline engine. In simple terms, it works by increasing the back-pressure of the exhaust. Nearly all of these brakes are butterfly valves similar to a throttle valve, mounted downstream of the turbocharger if there is one.

==== Exhaust obstructions ====
Modern diesels are subject to many strict controls on emissions and often have many obstructions in the exhaust, which cause them to feel like they have some engine braking like a gasoline engine. The main ones are:
* Turbocharger creates some back-pressure when it is stalled
* Exhaust gas recirculator (EGR) valve redirects exhaust gas back into the engine intake, often through a restricted/narrow pipe.
* Diesel particulate filter (DPF) is designed to capture soot particles that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere; it greatly obstructs exhaust flow and can sap almost as much power as a small air conditioning compressor.

===Two-stroke engines===
Engine braking in a premix two-stroke engine can be extremely harmful to the engine, because cylinder and piston lubricant is delivered to each cylinder mixed with fuel. Consequently, during engine braking, the engine starves not only of fuel but also lubricant, causing accelerated wear. Many old two-stroke cars (Saab Automobile, Wartburg 353, etc.) had a freewheel device on the transmission to make engine braking optional. Most two-stroke motorcycle engines since the 1970s have had lubrication by an oil pump, independent of the throttle and fuel system, such as Suzuki&#x27;s Posi-Force system.

===Electric motors===

In electric and hybrid vehicles, electric motors provide the drivetrain resistance, recharging the onboard battery using energy recovered from the vehicle&#x27;s kinetic motion which would otherwise have been wasted. In hybrid vehicles, the engine runs on electric power to dissipate excess energy when the battery has been fully recharged.

==Applications==
As soon as the accelerator is released enough to slow the engine, engine braking comes into effect as long as the wheels remain connected via the transmission to the engine. A slipping or disengaged clutch, or a torque converter, would disengage the wheels or absorb braking energy. The braking force varies depending on the engine, and the gear the transmission is in. The lower the gear, the higher the braking effect due to higher rpm and the torque transferred through the transmission (higher torque is delivered from the engine in lower gears).

Engine braking avoids wear on brakes, and can help a driver maintain control of the vehicle. Active use of engine braking by shifting into a lower gear can help control speed while driving down very steep and long slopes, saving the brakes from overheating or excessive wear. If it is applied before the brakes have been used, it can leave the brakes available to make emergency stops. The desired speed is maintained by using engine braking to counteract gravitational acceleration. Potential transmission wear caused by engine braking can be mitigated by certain techniques. Slipping the clutch to complete a downshift wears the clutch plate as it slows the vehicle, doing the job of the brake pads or shoes. A well-executed rev-match in the same setting minimizes stresses on transmission components, so engine braking does the work of slowing the vehicle.

Improper engine braking technique can cause the wheels to skid (also called shift-locking), especially on slippery surfaces, as a result of too much deceleration. As in a skid caused by overbraking, the vehicle will not regain traction until the wheels are allowed to turn more quickly. If the driver reduces engine braking by shifting back up, or disengaging the clutch on a manual transmission, traction can be regained.

In hybrid electric vehicles, like the Toyota Prius, engine braking is simulated by the computer software to match the feel of a traditional automatic transmission. For long downhill runs, the &quot;B&quot; mode acts like a lower gear, using the higher RPM of the internal combustion engine to waste energy, preventing the battery from being overcharged. Almost all electric and hybrid vehicles are able to convert kinetic motion into electricity, i.e. regenerative brakes, but since the internal combustion engine is not used to slow the vehicle when using regenerative braking, it is not the same as engine braking.

== Limitations == 

Engine braking is a generally accepted practice and can help save wear on friction brakes. It is even used in some motor sports to reduce the risk of the friction brakes overheating. Additionally, fuel injection engines generally do not use fuel while engine braking. This is known as deceleration fuel cut-off (DFCO).

Although no longer in production in most countries, there are still plenty of carbureted engines in service, with which engine braking is counter-productive to fuel economy due to the lack of a DFCO mechanism. The cost of wasted fuel can well outweigh the gain of reduced brake wear.

<doc id="1017858" wikidata="Q1049169" url="?curid=1017858" title="Innervisions">
<text>Innervisions is the sixteenth studio album by American singer, songwriter, and musician Stevie Wonder, released on August 3, 1973, by Tamla, a subsidiary of Motown Records. A landmark recording of Wonder&#x27;s &quot;classic period&quot;, the album has been regarded as completing his transition from the &quot;Little Stevie Wonder&quot; known for romantic ballads into a more musically mature, conscious, and grown-up artist. On the album, Wonder continued to experiment with the revolutionary T.O.N.T.O. (The Original New Timbral Orchestra) synthesizer system developed by Malcolm Cecil and Robert Margouleff, and &quot;Innervisions&quot; became hugely influential on the future sound of commercial soul and black music.

The album peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tapes chart and number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Soul LPs chart, eventually finishing at number four on the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Top Pop Albums&quot; chart for 1974. At the 16th Grammy Awards, it won Album of the Year and Best Engineered Non-Classical Recording, while &quot;Living for the City&quot; won Best R&amp;B Song. &quot;Innervisions&quot; is widely considered by fans, critics, and colleagues to be one of Wonder&#x27;s finest works and one of the greatest albums of all time. It was ranked number 34 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2020 and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.

==Recording==
As with many of Wonder&#x27;s albums, the lyrics, composition, and production of &quot;Innervisions&quot; are almost entirely his own work, and he also played all, or virtually all, the instruments on many of the album&#x27;s tracks. He made prominent use of synthesizers throughout the album.

The nine tracks of &quot;Innervisions&quot; encompass a wide range of themes and issues: from drug abuse in &quot;Too High&quot;, through inequality and systemic racism in &quot;Living for the City&quot;, to love in the ballads &quot;All in Love Is Fair&quot; and &quot;Golden Lady&quot;. The album&#x27;s closer, &quot;He&#x27;s Misstra Know-It-All&quot;, is thought by some to be a scathing attack on then-US President Richard Nixon, similar to Wonder&#x27;s song &quot;You Haven&#x27;t Done Nothin&#x27;&quot; from the following year. &quot;Living for the City&quot; was one of the first soul music songs to deal explicitly with systemic racism and to incorporate everyday sounds of the street, such as traffic, voices, and sirens, in with music recorded in the studio.

==Post-release car crash==
On August 6, 1973, three days after the commercial release of &quot;Innervisions&quot;, Wonder played a concert in Greenville, South Carolina. Afterward, he fell asleep in the front seat of the car of his friend John Harris, who was snaking along a road just outside Durham, North Carolina behind a truck loaded high with logs. Suddenly, the trucker jammed on his brakes, and the two vehicles collided. Logs went flying, and one smashed through the windshield of Wonder&#x27;s car and hit him in the forehead. He was bloodied and unconscious when he was pulled from the wrecked car, and lay in a coma caused by severe brain contusion for ten days.

It was Wonder&#x27;s friend and tour director Ira Tucker who first elicited some response from him:
When Wonder regained consciousness, he discovered that he had lost his sense of smell (which he later largely recovered), and he was deeply afraid that he might have lost his musical abilities, too. Tucker said:
Wonder&#x27;s climb back to health was long and slow. He had to take medication for a year, tired easily, and suffered severe headaches. The crash also changed his way of thinking, as his deep faith and spiritual vision made him doubt that it was &quot;an accident&quot;. He stated: &quot;You can never change anything that has already happened. Everything is the way it&#x27;s supposed to be...Everything that ever happened to me is the way it is supposed to have been.&quot; In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Wonder commented that &quot;the accident opened my ears up to many things around me. Naturally, life is just more important to me now...and what I do with my life.&quot; He also said:
Confirming Wonder&#x27;s belief in destiny, Michael Sembello, Wonder&#x27;s lead guitarist at the time, said:
Before the crash, Wonder had been scheduled to do a five-week, 20-city tour in March and April 1974. It was postponed, with the exception of one date in Madison Square Garden in late March. That concert began with Wonder pointing to his scarred forehead, looking up, grinning, and giving &quot;thanks to God that I&#x27;m alive&quot;. 21,000 people in the crowd roared with applause, and, as a &quot;Post&quot; critic noted, &quot;it was hard not to be thrilled.&quot;

==Critical reception==
As with both &quot;Music of My Mind&quot; and &quot;Talking Book&quot; from the previous year, &quot;Innervisions&quot; was received warmly by music critics, many of whom praised Wonder&#x27;s versatile musical skills. &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that &quot;the liner credits Stevie with playing all the instruments on seven of the nine tunes. So in essence this is a one-man band situation and it works. His skill on drums, piano, bass, and ARP synthesizers are outstanding, and all the tracks work within the thematic framework.&quot; (Two ARP synthesizers were incorporated into the T.O.N.T.O. system.) &quot;The New York Times&quot; said: &quot;At the center of his music is the sound of what is real. ... Stevie identifies himself as a gang and a genius, producing, composing, arranging, singing and, on several tracks, playing all the accompanying instruments. ... Vocally, he remains inventive and unafraid, he sings all the things he hears: rock, folk and all forms of Black music. The sum total of these varying components is an awesome knowledge, consumed and then shared by an artist who is free enough to do both.&quot;

Many critics praised the variety of musical styles and themes present in the album. A reviewer from &quot;Playboy&quot; wrote: &quot;Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Innervisions&quot; is a beautiful fusion of the lyric and the didactic, telling us about the blind world that Stevie inhabits with a depth of musical insight that is awesome. It&#x27;s a view that&#x27;s basically optimistic, a constant search for the &#x27;Higher Ground&#x27;, but the path is full of snares: dope (&#x27;Too High&#x27;), lies (&#x27;Jesus Children of America&#x27;) and the starkly rendered poison of the city (&#x27;Living for the City&#x27;). Wonder seems to say that all people delude themselves but have to be well to pay their dues and existentially accept the present. &#x27;Today&#x27;s not yesterday,/And all things have an ending&#x27; is the way he puts it in &#x27;Visions,&#x27; the key tune of the album—pretty yet serious, harmonically vivid. There&#x27;s a lot of varied music here—Latin, reggae, even a nod to Johnny Mathis (&#x27;All in Love is Fair&#x27;)—but it&#x27;s all Stevie, unmistakably.&quot;

Some reviewers were less enthusiastic. Jon Tiven from &quot;Circus&quot; argued that there was a lack of memorable material on the album: &quot;Just when Stevie had some momentum going, he went and put together a concept album of homogeneous music and rather typical lyrics. Unlike his last two albums, there are no real low spots on this album, which I suppose is an improvement, but there are no songs on &quot;Innervisions&quot; which are truly outstanding either. There&#x27;s no &#x27;Superstition,&#x27; no &#x27;I Believe (When I Fall in Love It Will Be Forever).&#x27; By constructing a solid ground from which to work, Stevie has lowered the ceiling, and put a damper on his talents.&quot;

Musicians also showed consummate respect for the achievements of the album, with Roberta Flack saying to &quot;Newsweek&quot; that &quot;It&#x27;s the most sensitive of our decade ... it has tapped the pulse of the people.&quot;

&quot;Innervisions&quot; won Grammy Awards for Album of the Year and Best Engineered Non-Classical Recording in 1974, while &quot;Living for the City&quot; won the Grammy for Best R&amp;B Song.

==Commercial performance==
Following &quot;Talking Book&quot;, which hit the top 5 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart in early 1973 and achieved steady sales throughout the rest of the year, &quot;Innervisions&quot; became another considerable hit on the charts for Wonder. It debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart on August 18, 1973, at number 85, then climbed to number 22, number 14, number nine, and number six, before reaching its peak position of number four on September 15. The album remained in the top 20 until the end of the year, and remained in the top 200 during the entire calendar year of 1975. &quot;Innervisions&quot; was Wonder&#x27;s second consecutive album to reach the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Black Albums chart, where it remained for two weeks. On the &quot;Cashbox&quot; chart, it reached number one near the end of 1973. In the UK, the album also found success, and became Wonder&#x27;s first to reach the UK top 10, peaking at number eight. 
Three hit singles were issued from the album. &quot;Higher Ground&quot;, which was released several weeks before &quot;Innervisions&quot;, reached number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart in late October 1973, and number one on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; singles chart. &quot;Living for the City&quot; reached number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart in early January 1974. These first two singles both reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Soul Singles chart. Finally, &quot;Don&#x27;t You Worry &#x27;Bout a Thing&quot;, released in March 1974, reached number 16 in early June, and also peaked at number two on the Soul Singles chart. In the UK, &quot;Higher Ground&quot; and &quot;Living for the City&quot; were released as singles, but only achieved modest success, reaching numbers 29 and 15, respectively. Only the third single issued there, &quot;He&#x27;s Misstra Know-It-All&quot;, managed to reach the top 10, peaking at number eight on the UK Singles Chart.

&quot;All in Love Is Fair&quot; was a hit for Barbra Streisand when she recorded it and released it as a single in 1974.

==Legacy==
&quot;Innervisions&quot; is considered by many fans, critics, and colleagues to be one of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s finest works, and one of the greatest albums ever made. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; critic Geoffrey Himes called it an exemplary release of the progressive soul development from 1968 to 1973. The album has been regarded as completing his transition from the &quot;Little Stevie Wonder&quot; known for romantic ballads into a more musically mature, conscious, and grown-up artist. In his &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Review: A Guide to Good Rock&quot; (1991), Bill Shapiro wrote: &quot;This recording represents the pinnacle of a very important artist&#x27;s career, and of his physically blind, but nonetheless extraordinary humane vision. For all intents and purposes, and for all of its richness and variety of texture, it is essentially &quot;all&quot; Stevie Wonder. He personally created and arranged every sound heard. His canvas stretches from the tough realities of ghetto streets to the transcendent joy of spiritual acceptance, each rendered with an original, unique musical palette. The feel is a little more jazz than funk, the result is simply glorious pop music – uplifting sound and message.&quot;

The album has been included on many lists of the greatest albums of all time. It was voted number 143 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). In 2001, VH1 named the album the 31st-greatest album of all time, saying: &quot;The whole message of this album seems to be caution – Wonder seems to be warning the black community to be aware of their own plight, strive for improvement, and take matters into their own hands. But this is all against the backdrop of the harsh social realities of America circa 1973, and nowhere does this conflict hit home more than in Wonder&#x27;s magnum opus, &#x27;Living for the City&#x27;, a raw piece of modern blues on which Wonder played every instrument. The message of urban struggle resonates even more strongly now than it did thirty years ago, proving that the &#x27;inner-visions&#x27; of this LP were visionary as well.&quot;

In 2003, the album was ranked number 23 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time; it was number 24 on the 2012 version of the list, and number 34 on the 2020 edition. The magazine wrote on the occasion of the initial list:

The album was re-released in the UK on September 15, 2008, to coincide with Wonder&#x27;s critically acclaimed autumn 2008 European tour.

<doc id="1017860" wikidata="Q4876308" url="?curid=1017860" title="Beans Reardon">
<text>John Edward &quot;Beans&quot; Reardon (November 23, 1897 – July 31, 1984) was an American umpire in Major League Baseball who worked in the National League from 1926 to 1949. He worked five World Series and three All-Star Games.

== Early life and career==
Born on November 23, 1897, in Taunton, Massachusetts, Reardon&#x27;s family moved to Los Angeles when he was 14, and he acquired his nickname as a youth due to his Boston-area origins. Having no chance at a career playing baseball due to a throwing arm ruined by overexertion in sandlot ball, he began umpiring amateur games as a teenager. He got his professional start with a copper miners&#x27; league in Arizona in 1919, but after arriving for duty and learning that his contract required him to work in the mines, he resigned after one day&#x27;s work, followed by a doubleheader he umpired singlehandedly.

== Career ==
From 1920 to 1921, he umpired in the Western Canada League, where he made his reputation in Edmonton by refusing a police escort out of a park after a particularly contentious game before a hostile crowd, saying, &quot;I didn&#x27;t sneak in and I won&#x27;t sneak out.&quot; He then worked in the Pacific Coast League for four seasons before reaching the major leagues.

He was known for his many arguments on the field, and for the fact that he relished the opportunity to match the players in his use of off-color language; he came to refer to himself as &quot;the last of the cussin&#x27; umpires&quot;, and rarely ejected players from games, reportedly because he enjoyed trading insults. At one point in his career, NL president Ford Frick issued a memo to all field personnel requiring them to reduce their use of profanity, a thinly veiled move directed primarily at Reardon.

Reardon had a difficult relationship with longtime NL umpire Bill Klem, the dean of the league staff; the younger umpire insisted upon wearing the outside chest protector used by American League umpires, rather than the inside protector favored by Klem. Reardon also regularly conversed during games with spectators in the stands, another annoyance to Klem. Reardon would note that he perhaps stayed as long as he did in the league only because Klem was promoted to a non-field position in 1941. Ever outspoken, upon accepting an award named for Klem from Houston sportswriters in the 1960s, Reardon offhandedly remarked that he and Klem hated one another.

==Notable games==
He officiated in five World Series: 1930, 1934, 1939, 1943 and 1949. He also umpired in three All-Star Games (1936, 1940, 1948), calling balls and strikes in all three contests; and he was one of the umpires for the 3-game series to determine the NL champion in 1946. He was the plate umpire when Babe Ruth hit his 714th and final home run in 1935, and also for Clyde Shoun&#x27;s no-hitter on May 15, 1944.

==Later life==
Reardon retired following the 1949 World Series. By the late 1940s, he was the highest-paid umpire in the league, he was earning three times as much from his offseason business as an Anheuser-Busch beer distributor. He eventually sold the distributorship to Frank Sinatra for over half a million dollars in 1967, although he continued to do public relations work for the brewery.

Reardon made an uncredited appearance as an umpire in the 1953 film &quot;The Kid from Left Field&quot;.

==Personal life==
Reardon suffered two strokes late in his life, and died on July 31, 1984, aged 86, in Long Beach, California.

Beans was friends with Mae West and she is said to have sent him a copy of a nude photograph every Christmas. He appeared in several of her movies.

He was notably the basis for the home plate umpire in Norman Rockwell&#x27;s famous painting &quot;Bottom of the Sixth&quot;, flanked by umpires Larry Goetz and Lou Jorda. Reardon is largely identifiable because, despite the depicted game being in the National League, the umpire is using the outside chest protector.

<text>Velocity Trap is a 1999 television film directed by Phillip J. Roth and starring Olivier Gruner, Alicia Coppola, and Ken Olandt.

==Plot==
The main character, Ray Stokes (Olivier Gruner) is a down-on-his luck police officer on a distant, corruptly-ruled mining colony. He has already lost his wife Dana (Anna Karin) to his corrupt boss, John Dawson (Craig Wasson), not from any failure in romantic rivalry, but as part of a deal to pay off their dead daughter&#x27;s medical bills: making her Dawson&#x27;s &quot;Contract Wife&quot;.

Samuel Nelson (Harry Wowchuk), an Enforcement Division chief of security, is sent to clean up the colony&#x27;s local Enforcement Division, but is killed in the course of his investigation. Stokes is framed for the murder of another ED officer (Yannick Bisson), also killed by Nelson&#x27;s assassin. However, Dawson is implicated in Nelson&#x27;s death and wants to avoid any inquiry. He sends Stokes on a six-month trip to Earth, protecting a cargo of cash.

Meanwhile, the crew of &quot;The Endeavour&quot; has planned to intercept the money ship while the crew are in hibernation. The interception occurs, leaving Stokes and Beth Sheffield (Alicia Coppola), the attractive female navigator, the only survivors of the ensuing gun battles; they steal the money and buy the mining colony. Dawson is arrested for his part in Nelson&#x27;s death.

<doc id="1017866" wikidata="Q8216291" url="?curid=1017866" title="Workers Party of Barbados">
<text>The Workers Party of Barbados was a Marxist political party in Barbados. The party was established on 1 May 1985 by Dr. George Belle, who served as the general secretary of the party. The party had a pro-Soviet orientation and grew out of MONALI, an earlier Marxist movement based at the Cave Hill University of the West Indies campus which had gained national notoriety during the 1983 Grenada invasion. When announcing the transformation of MONALI into the Workers Party of Barbados, Belle affirmed the party would be organized along the lines of democratic centralism and would work on a basis of a programme of &quot;progressive reforms and revolutionary democratic demands&quot;. The founders of the party included trade unionist Ricky Parry.

The party contested the 1986 elections, when it presented two candidates. The party received just 40 votes, failed to win a seat, and did not run in any further elections.

WPB called for a boycott of the 1986 Commonwealth Games, in protest against Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s support for participation of South African athletes. Barbados later joined the boycott of the event.

<doc id="1017868" wikidata="Q4349286" url="?curid=1017868" title="Purple Haze (album)">
<text>Purple Haze is the fourth studio album by Harlem rapper Cam&#x27;ron. The album was released on December 7, 2004, by Diplomat Records, Roc-A-Fella Records and distributed by Def Jam Recordings. The release of this album was delayed several times from November 2003, the first single &quot;Get Em Girls&quot; was released a year prior to the actual album release. The album debuted at number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 123,000 copies sold in its first week. The album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

==Critical reception==

&quot;Purple Haze&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72, based on 7 reviews.

David Drake of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; praised the album for its &quot;bombastic production and surreal lyricism&quot; and Cam&#x27;s &quot;unique brand of idiosyncratic gangsta&quot; being wildly engaging because of his absurd, poker-faced delivery, concluding that &quot;&quot;Purple Haze&quot; is such a twisted take on gangsta that it has to be heard to be believed.&quot; &quot;Blender&quot; contributor Jonah Weiner noted how the production throughout the record moves between &quot;aggressively insane (&quot;Shake&quot;)&quot; to &quot;ador[ing] pop (the Cyndi Lauper-interpolating &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot;)&quot; while Cam matches that balance with wordplay that&#x27;s &quot;Missy gibberish swathed in 50 Cent menace,&quot; concluding that he &quot;writes pop hooks and avant-garde rhymes while staying as close to the streets as a manhole cover.&quot; Chris Ryan from &quot;Spin&quot; gave credit to Cam for tightening his signature flow, choosing quality and risk-worthy beats, and maintaining listener interest while delivering &quot;Harlem symbolism and non-sensical muttering&quot; throughout the album. AllMusic editor Andy Kellman was mixed about the tracks on the record, finding &quot;Girls&quot; and &quot;Harlem Streets&quot; to be weak inclusions but praised the contributions from Kanye West (&quot;Down and Out&quot;), Pop &amp; Versatile (&quot;Soap Opera&quot;) and the Heatmakerz (&quot;More Gangsta Music&quot;). He also commented that the &quot;Diplomat-affiliated material&quot; being released alongside it that year may cause their fanbase to suffer burnout from too much content. Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; commended the album for adopting the hyper-soul style of Roc-A-Fella&#x27;s sound throughout the track listing but criticized Cam&#x27;s lyric delivery for being similar to nursery rhymes, saying that it &quot;lumbers drearily through a sea of gangsta-rap clichés.&quot;

Online music magazine &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed &quot;Purple Haze&quot; at number 114 on their list of the Top 200 Albums of the 2000s. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writer Sean Fennessey said, &quot;Call this a personal project for a relentlessly distant artist; an asshole&#x27;s lament. &quot;Purple Haze&quot; is simultaneously a refined, perfectly A&amp;R-ed follow-up and one of the most confusing, crude full-lengths ever.&quot;

<doc id="1017875" wikidata="Q1149046" url="?curid=1017875" title="Cystinuria">
<text>Cystinuria is an inherited autosomal recessive disease characterized by high concentrations of the amino acid cystine in the urine, leading to the formation of cystine stones in the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. It is a type of aminoaciduria. &quot;Cystine&quot;, not &quot;cysteine,&quot; is implicated in this disease; the former is a dimer of the latter.

==Presentation==
Cystinuria is a cause of recurrent kidney stones. It is a disease involving the defective transepithelial transport of cystine and dibasic amino acids in the kidney and intestine and is one of many causes of kidney stones. If not treated properly, the disease could cause serious damage to the kidneys and surrounding organs, and in some rare cases death. The stones may be identified by a positive nitroprusside cyanide test. The crystals are usually hexagonal, translucent, and white. Upon removal, the stones may be pink or yellow, but later they turn greenish due to exposure to air. Cystinuria is usually asymptomatic when no stone is formed. However, once a stone is formed, signs and symptoms can occur:
* Nausea
* Flank pain
* Hematuria
* Urinary tract infections
* Rarely, acute or chronic kidney disease

People with cystinuria pass stones monthly, weekly, or daily, and need ongoing care. Cystinurics have an increased risk for chronic kidney disease and since kidney damage or poor function is often present in people with cystinuria, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or over the counter (OTC) medications should be used with caution.

Cystine stones are often difficult to detect using plain X-rays. Computed tomography or ultrasound may be used instead for imaging.

Urine odor in cystinuria smells of rotten eggs due to the increase in cystine.

==Genetics==

Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive disease, which means that the defective gene responsible for the disease is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required to be born with the disease. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disease both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disease. Although signs and symptoms are rare, there are some directly and indirectly associated with cystinuria. These signs and symptoms consist of 1) hematuria- blood in the urine, 2) flank pain – pain in the side due to kidney pain, 3) renal colic – intense, cramping pain due to stones in the urinary tract, 4) obstructive uropathy- urinary tract disease due to obstruction, and 5) urinary tract infections.

===Cause===
Cystinuria is caused by mutations in the &quot;SLC3A1&quot; and &quot;SLC7A9&quot; genes. These defects prevent proper reabsorption of basic, or positively charged, amino acids: cystine, lysine, ornithine, arginine. Under normal circumstances, this protein allows certain amino acids, including cystine, to be reabsorbed into the blood from the filtered fluid that will become urine. Mutations in either of these genes disrupt the ability of this transporter protein to reabsorb these amino acids, allowing them to become concentrated in the urine. As the levels of cystine in the urine increase, it forms cystine crystals, resulting in kidney stones. Cystine crystals form hexagonal-shaped crystals that can be viewed upon microscopic analysis of the urine. The other amino acids that are not reabsorbed do not create crystals in urine.

The overall prevalence of cystinuria is approximately 1 in 7,000 neonates (from 1 in 2,500 neonates in Libyan Jews to 1 in 100,000 among Swedes).

==Pathophysiology==
Cystinuria is characterized by the inadequate reabsorption of cystine in the proximal convoluted tubules after the filtering of the amino acids by the kidney&#x27;s glomeruli, thus resulting in an excessive concentration of this amino acid in the urine. Cystine may precipitate out of the urine, if the urine is neutral or acidic, and form crystals or stones in the kidneys, ureters, or bladder. It is one of several inborn errors of metabolism included in the Garrod&#x27;s tetrad. The disease is attributed to a deficiency in the transport and metabolism of amino acids.

==Diagnosis==

# Blood: Routine hemogram along with blood sugar, urea, and creatinine.
# Urine: For cystine crystals, and casts. The most specific test is the cyanide–nitroprusside test
# Ultrasound/CT scan to reveal if a stone is present.
# Genetic analysis to determine which mutation associated with the disease may be present. Currently genotyping is not available in the United States but might be available in Spain, Italy, the UK, Germany, and Russia (by private companies in Germany and Russia).

Regular X-rays often fail to show the cystine stones, however, they can be visualized in the diagnostic procedure that is called intravenous pyelogram (IVP). Stones may show up on XR with a fuzzy gray appearance. They are radioopaque due to sulfur content, though more difficult to visualize than calcium oxalate stones.

==Treatment==
Initial treatment is with adequate hydration, alkalization of the urine with citrate supplementation or acetazolamide, and dietary modification to reduce salt and protein intake (especially methionine). If this fails then patients are usually started on chelation therapy with an agent such as penicillamine. Tiopronin is another agent.
Once renal stones have formed, however, the first-line treatment is endoscopic laser lithotripsy. ESWL (Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy) is often not effective because of the hardness of the stones that do not fragment easily. Conventional open-abdominal surgery is rarely used but has proven to be an effective treatment modality for patients with more advanced forms of the disease. Adequate hydration is the foremost aim of treatment to prevent cystine stones. The goal is to increase the urine volume because the concentration of cystine in the urine is reduced which prevents cystine from precipitating from the urine and forming stones. People with cystine stones should consume 5 to 7 liters a day. The rationale behind alkalizing the urine is that cystine tends to stay in solution and causes no harm. To alkalinize the urine, sodium bicarbonate has been used. One must be careful in alkalizing their urine because it could lead to other forms of stones in the process of preventing cystine stones. Penicillamine is a drug that acts to form a complex with cystine that is 50 times more soluble than cystine itself. Percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL) is performed via a port created by puncturing the kidney through the skin and enlarging the access port to 1 cm in diameter. Most of the time, cystine stones are too dense to be broken up by shock (ESWL) so PNL is needed.

Videos of surgery are available on various websites that show stone removal by percutaneous nephrolithotomy.

In February 2017, an article was published in &quot;Nature Medicine&quot; entitled &quot;Alpha lipoic acid treatment prevents cystine urolithiasis in a mouse model of cystinuria&quot;, suggesting that a high dose of the readily available antioxidant, alpha-lipoic acid at 2,700 mg/67 kg body weight daily reduced the incidence of stones. The effects were dose dependent. The results are unprecedented for cystinuria. A clinical trial is underway based on this mouse model.

== Occurrence in animals ==
This disease is known to occur in at least four mammalian species: humans, domestic canines, domestic ferrets, and a wild canid, the maned wolf of South America.
Cystine uroliths have been demonstrated, usually in male dogs, from approximately 70 breeds including the Australian cattle dog, Australian shepherd, Basenji, Basset, Bullmastiff, Chihuahua, Scottish deerhound, Scottish terrier, Staffordshire terrier, Welsh corgi, and Newfoundland dogs.

<doc id="1017881" wikidata="Q3269843" url="?curid=1017881" title="Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis">
<text>Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP, HyperKPP) is an inherited autosomal dominant disorder that affects sodium channels in muscle cells and the ability to regulate potassium levels in the blood. It is characterized by muscle hyperexcitability or weakness which, exacerbated by potassium, heat or cold, can lead to uncontrolled shaking followed by paralysis. Onset usually occurs in early childhood, but it still occurs with adults.

The mutation causing this disorder is autosomal dominant on the SCN4A gene with linkage to the sodium channel expressed in muscle. The mutation causes single amino acid changes in parts of the channel which are important for inactivation. These mutations impair &quot;ball and chain&quot; fast inactivation of SCN4A following an action potential.

==Signs and symptoms==
Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis causes episodes of extreme muscle weakness, with attacks often beginning in childhood. Depending on the type and severity of the HyperKPP, it can increase or stabilize until the fourth or fifth decade where attacks may cease, decline, or, depending on the type, continue on into old age. Factors that can trigger attacks include rest after exercise, potassium-rich foods, stress, fatigue, weather changes, certain pollutants (e.g., cigarette smoke) and fasting. Muscle strength often improves between attacks, although many affected people may have increasing bouts of muscle weakness as the disorder progresses (abortive attacks). Sometimes with HyperKPP those affected may experience degrees of muscle stiffness and spasms (myotonia) in the affected muscles. This can be caused by the same things that trigger the paralysis, dependent on the type of myotonia.

Some people with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis have increased levels of potassium in their blood (hyperkalemia) during attacks. In other cases, attacks are associated with normal blood potassium levels (normokalemia). Ingesting potassium can trigger attacks in affected individuals, even if blood potassium levels do not rise in response.

In contrast to HyperKPP, hypokalemic periodic paralysis (noted in humans) refers to loss-of-function mutations in channels that prevent muscle depolarisation and therefore are aggravated by low potassium ion concentrations.

==Genetics==
In humans, the most common underlying genetic cause is one of several possible point mutations in the gene &quot;SCN4A&quot;. This gene codes for a voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.4 found at the neuromuscular junction. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause it.

Action potentials from the central nervous system cause end-plate potentials at the NMJ which causes sodium ions to enter by Nav1.4 and depolarise the muscle cells. This depolarisation triggers the entry of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to cause contraction (tensing) of the muscle. To prevent the muscle from being perpetually contracted, the channel contains a fast inactivation gate that plugs the sodium pore very quickly after it opens. This prevents further entry of sodium. In time, potassium ions will leave the muscle cells, repolarising the cells and causing the pumping of calcium away from the contractile apparatus to relax the muscle.

Mutations altering the usual structure and function of this sodium channel therefore disrupt regulation of muscle contraction, leading to episodes of severe muscle weakness or paralysis. Mutations have been identified in residues between transmembrane domains III and IV which make up the fast inactivation gate of Nav1.4. Mutations have been found on the cytoplasmic loops between the S4 and S5 helices of domains II, III and IV, which are the binding sites of the inactivation gate.

The pathological mechanism of SCN4A mutations in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis is complex, but explains the autosomal dominant and hyperkalemia-related aspects of the disease. In patients with mutations in SCN4A, not all copies of the channel inactivate following the action potential. This results in a sodium leak and failure to return to the original resting membrane potential. In the presence of hyperkalemia, which causes an additional chronic depolarization of the membrane potential, this sodium leak raises the membrane potential to the point that all sodium channels, including channels produced from the wild-type allele and mutant channels that did inactivate, fail to be release from inactivation (enter depolarization block). Since the motor end plate is depolarised, further signals to contract have no effect (paralysis).

==Treatment==

* Glucose or other carbohydrates can be given during an attack and may reduce the severity.
* Intravenous calcium decreases activity of sodium channels. It may stop sudden attacks.
* Diuretics such as furosemide may be needed to stop sudden attacks; acetazolamide and thiazide diuretics such as chlorothiazide are also effective.
* Intravenous glucose and insulin stimulates potassium uptake into the cell by the Na-K ATPase and may reduce weakness without a loss of total body potassium.
* A high-carbohydrate diet may be recommended.
* Avoidance of other known attack triggers.
