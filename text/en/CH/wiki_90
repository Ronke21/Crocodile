<text>A median strip, central reservation, roadway median, or traffic median is the reserved area that separates opposing lanes of traffic on divided roadways such as divided highways, dual carriageways, freeways, and motorways. The term also applies to divided roadways other than highways, including some major streets in urban or suburban areas. The reserved area may simply be paved, but commonly it is adapted to other functions; for example, it may accommodate decorative landscaping, trees, a median barrier, or railway, rapid transit, light rail, or streetcar lines.

==Regional terminology==
There is no international English standard for the term. Median, median strip, and median divider island are common in North American and Antipodean English. Variants in North American English include regional terms such as neutral ground in New Orleans usage or boulevard in Vancouver, British Columbia.

In British English the central reservation or central median is the preferred usage; it also occurs widely in formal documents in some non-British regions such as South Africa, where there are other informal regional words (for example &quot;middelmannetjie&quot;, which originally referred to the hump between wheel ruts on a dust road). Neutral section and central nature strip are coinages in Australian English.

Additionally, different terminology is used to identify traffic lanes in a multi-lane roadway. North American usage calls the leftmost lanes located closest to the roadway centerline the &quot;inner&quot; lanes, while British usage calls these lanes the &quot;outer&quot; lanes. Thus, it is less confusing to call these central lanes the &quot;passing&quot;, &quot;fast&quot;, or &quot;overtaking&quot; lanes in international contexts, instead of using the ambiguous inner/outer distinction. Regional differences between right-hand traffic and left-hand traffic can cause further confusion.

== Physical attributes ==

Some medians function secondarily as green areas and green belts to beautify roadways. Jurisdictions can: plant lawn grasses with regular mowing; hydroseed or scatter wildflower seeds to germinate, bloom, and re-seed themselves annually; or create extensive landscape plantings of trees, shrubs, herbaceous perennials and ornamental grasses. Where space is at a premium, dense hedges of shrubs filter the headlights of oncoming traffic and provide a resilient barrier. In other areas, the median may be occupied by a right-of-way for a public transportation system such as a light rail or rapid transit line; for example, the Red and Blue Lines of the Chicago &#x27;L&#x27; partially run in the medians of the Dan Ryan, Eisenhower, and Kennedy Expressways.
In contrast to the median of a major road, those in urban areas often take the form of central traffic islands that rise above the roadway. These are frequently found on urban arterial roads. In their simplest form, these are just raised concrete curbs, but can also be landscaped with grass or trees or decorated with bricks or stones. Such medians are also sometimes found on more minor or residential streets, where they serve primarily as a traffic-calming or landscaping element rather than a safety enhancement to restrict turns and separate opposite directions of high-volume traffic flow.

In some areas such as California, highway medians are sometimes no more than a demarcated section of the paved roadway, indicated by a space between two sets of double yellow lines. Such a double-double yellow line or painted median is legally similar to an island median: vehicles are not permitted to cross it, unlike a single set of double yellow lines which may in some cases permit turns across the line. This arrangement has been used to reduce costs, including narrower medians than are feasible with a planted strip, but research indicates that such narrow medians may have minimal safety benefit compared to no median at all.

The medians of United States Interstate Highways break only for emergency service lanes, with no such restrictions on lower classification roads. On British motorways, the median is never broken (except on the tidal flow of Aston Expressway), but there are no such restrictions on other dual carriageways.

== Width ==

The central reservation in the United Kingdom and other densely populated European countries (where it is known by their local names) is usually no wider than a single lane of traffic. In some cases, however, it is extended. For instance, if the road is running through hilly terrain, the carriageways may have to be built on different levels of the slope. An example of this is on the M5 motorway as it climbs up the side of the Gordano Valley south of Bristol. In Birmingham and many other cities, suburban dual carriageways may have trees or cycle lanes in the middle as a wide central reservation.

Two examples on the UK road network where the carriageways are several hundred yards/metres apart, are on a section of the M6 between Shap and Tebay, which allows a local road to run between them, and on the M62 where the highest section through the Pennines famously splits wide enough to contain a farm. The other major exception is the A38(M) Aston Expressway, which is a single carriageway of seven lanes, where the median lane moves to account for traffic flow (a system known as tidal flow or reversible lane).

With effect from January 2005 and based primarily on safety grounds, the UK&#x27;s Highways Agency&#x27;s policy is that all new motorway schemes are to use high containment concrete step barriers in the median (central reservation). All existing motorways will introduce concrete barriers as part of ongoing upgrades and through replacement as and when the current systems have reached the end of their useful life. This change of policy applies only to barriers in the median of high speed roads and not to verge side barriers. Other routes will continue to use steel barriers.

In North America, and some other countries with large sparsely populated areas, opposing lanes of traffic may be separated by several hundred meters of fields or forests outside of heavily populated areas (an extreme example being the Trans-Canada Highway near Ernfold, Saskatchewan, Canada, where eastbound and westbound lanes go as far as apart from each other), but converge to a lane&#x27;s width of separation in suburban areas and cities. In urban areas, concrete barriers (such as Jersey barriers) and guard rails (or guide rails) are used.

In Dedham, Massachusetts, the Norfolk County Correctional Center (a state prison) is located entirely within a wide median of Massachusetts Route 128. This 502-bed facility was opened in 1993 as infill construction in the previously unused real estate that had been isolated by the divided highway in the early 1950s. An extreme example of a wide median can be found on Interstate 75 near Cincinnati, Ohio; nearly the entire village of Arlington Heights, as well as the downtown district of Lockland, are both located between the two directions of I-75.

== Inverted median ==
Some freeways in North America include &quot;inverted&quot; medians, which separate roadways running in the opposite direction from the standard for the country they are located in. Roads are so designed for a number of reasons, including to save space, for the creation of continuous flow intersections, or for diverging diamond interchanges.

* The north–south Golden State Freeway (I-5) in the Tehachapi Mountains of California between Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley. For several miles, the direction of traffic on both sides of the median is reversed — northbound traffic is on the western roadway and southbound traffic on the eastern roadway.
* I-85 in central North Carolina between Lexington and Thomasville features an inverted median, constructed so that an in-median, right-exit rest area can feature a historic bridge.
* I-77 in Charlotte, North Carolina, has a reverse median at its intersection over I-85 for on- and off-ramps without taking too much land from neighboring properties and without building many more bridges.
* I-84 used to have an inverted median through Waterbury, Connecticut, east of the 2-level &quot;mixmaster&quot; interchange with Route 8. This section of freeway was reconstructed in the 1970s, which eliminated the inverted median.

Inverted medians are also used in rare cases on local streets that historically had unusual traffic patterns, such as Bainbridge Street between 3rd Street and 5th Street in Philadelphia.

== Safety impact ==

An August 1993 study by the US Federal Highway Administration quantified the correlation between median width and the reduction of both head-on accidents and severe injuries. The study found that medians without barriers should be constructed more than wide in order to have any effect on safety, and that safety benefits of wider medians continue to increase to a width of .

A consequence of this finding is that decreasing the size of a median to from to add lanes to a highway may result in a less safe highway. Statistics regarding medians with barriers were not calculated in this study.

== Bus rapid transit ==
Central reservations may also be used for reserved bus lanes, as in Istanbul&#x27;s Metrobus, Los Angeles&#x27;s J Line and Bogotá&#x27;s TransMilenio. Center-lane running and island platforms installed in the medium reduce conflicts with stopped and parked cars as well as pedestrians near the curb, thus speeding service.

== Railway use ==

In some cases, the median strip of the highway may contain a train line, usually around major urban centers. This is often done to share a right-of-way, because of the expense and difficulty of clearing a route through dense urban neighborhoods. A reserved right-of-way is contrasted with street running, in which rail cars and automobiles occupy the same lanes of traffic.

City planners also commonly use median strips to accommodate urban tram tracks along a central segregated track, and examples of this layout are found across Europe. Some of the earliest practices of incorporating central tramways into road designs were pioneered in Liverpool by John Alexander Brodie, and later emulated in Manchester, such as along Princess Parkway or Kingsway.

<text>Rampage is a 1986 arcade video game developed and published by Bally Midway. Inspired by monster films, players control a trio of monsters: George, Lizzie, and Ralph, humans transformed into creatures due to various experimental mishaps. The objective is to destroy cities and combat military forces while maintaining their health. The game is set across 128 days in cities throughout North America, with each cycle repeating five times. Gameplay includes destroying buildings, eating humans, and avoiding damage.

&quot;Rampage&quot; spawned five sequels and a film adaptation in 2018. Warner Bros. currently owns all rights to the property via their purchase of Midway Games.

==Gameplay==
Up to three players control a trio of humans transfigured into animalistic kaijus due to various experiment-related accidents: George, a scientist who has become a King Kong-like gorilla due to the influence of experimental vitamins; Lizzie, a woman who has become a Ymir-like reptile after foolishly swimming in a radioactive waste-laden lake; and Ralph, who has become a werewolf-like kaiju after foolishly consuming a hot dog laced with an enhanced food additive. The trio must raze all buildings in a high-rise city to advance to the next level, eating people and destroying helicopters, tanks, taxis, police cars, boats and trolleys along the way.

The player can climb any of the buildings, punching them to pieces and reducing them to rubble. Non-playable human characters within the levels can also be punched or grabbed and food items can be eaten. The player&#x27;s monster receives damage from enemy bullets, sticks of dynamite, shells, punches from other monsters, and falls. Health is recovered by eating food items such as fruit, roast chicken or soldiers. If a monster has taken too much damage, they will return to their former, but nude, human state and walk off the screen sideways, covering their body with their hands. In this state, players can be eaten by another monster. If the player continues, the human returns to their mutated form or (if the human walked off the screen) flies in on a blimp (but has lost their score) with a full life bar.

Smashing open windows generally reveals an item or person of interest, which may be helpful or harmful. Helpful items include food or money, while dangerous ones include bombs, electrical appliances and cigarettes. Some items can be both; for example, a toaster is dangerous until the toast pops up, and a photographer must be eaten quickly before he dazzles the player&#x27;s monster with his flash, causing it to fall. When a civilian is present waving their hands at a window signaling for help, a player&#x27;s points rapidly increase when the person is grabbed.

&quot;Rampage&quot; is set over the course of 128 days in cities across North America. The game starts in Peoria, Illinois and ends in Plano, Illinois. In Plano, players receive a &quot;mega vitamin bonus&quot; which heals all the monsters and provides a large point bonus. After this, the cycle of cities repeats five times. After 768 days, the game resets back to Day 1. As game developer Brian F Colin stated &quot;the hardware couldn&#x27;t support that much art and we never figured anyone would get through 768 levels&quot;.

Some of the home port versions of the game start in San Jose, California and end in Los Angeles, California after going all around North America. The rampage travels through various cities across the United States, as well as two Canadian cities. Out of the 50 US states, only Connecticut, Delaware, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Vermont are spared from the monster rampage.

==Development==
The game&#x27;s lead designers were artist Brian Colin and programmer Jeff Nauman. Neither of them being fans of arcade games at the time, Colin conceived &quot;Rampage&quot; as a game in which there was &quot;no wrong way to play&quot;. To this end, he wanted to eschew the common video game concepts of having a set objective, competing for a high score and dying. Artist Sharon Perry, game tester Jim Belt and composer Michael Bartlow assisted with developing the game. The game&#x27;s aim of destroying skyscrapers was created because the developers could only move rectangular shapes in the background. The developers had to work within the technical limitations of the time - cities are largely identical in appearance, Ralph and George are the same character palette and head swapped and the dust effect from crumbling buildings conceals glitchy animation. The game&#x27;s development and release languished as management was unconvinced of the game&#x27;s unusual concept of casting players as city-destroying monsters, but picked up after new management was installed at the company. Post-release, additional levels were added to the game to make it more difficult. In the opening cutscene reporting on three humans who had mutated into the monsters, Colin put pictures of himself as George, his wife Rae as Lizzie, and Nauman as Ralph.

Conceiving a graphically impressive title within the technical constraints of Midway&#x27;s then current arcade hardware, designer Brian Colin took inspiration from monster films &quot;King Kong&quot; and &quot;20 Million Miles To Earth&quot;. Decades after the game released, Colin addressed a popular misconception that Lizzie was based on Godzilla, stating that Lizzie was actually based on the Ymir from &quot;20 Million Miles to Earth&quot;; he said Godzilla would&#x27;ve been too large to fit into the size constraints of the game, and that he preferred Harryhausen and Willis O’Brien films over kaiju films such as &quot;Godzilla&quot;.

==Release and ports==
The game was released for the arcades in 1986. Colin promoted the game via a press release sent to local media outlets in each of the towns mentioned in-game; the press release took the form of an unofficial memo from Bally/Midway that stated that their town was &quot;slated for destruction&quot;.

&quot;Rampage&quot; was ported to the Apple II, Atari 2600, Atari 7800, Atari Lynx, Atari 8-bit computers, Atari ST, Amiga, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Nintendo Entertainment System, Master System, and Tandy Color Computer 3. The Lynx version adds a fourth character: Larry, a giant rat. The NES version excludes Ralph, reducing the number of monsters to two.

The Lynx version was developed by Epyx and it was originally started off as an unrelated clone called &quot;Monster Demolition&quot;, before turning it into a port of this game.

The arcade version of &quot;Rampage&quot; is included in various compilations. In 1999 it was included in &quot;Arcade Party Pak&quot; for the PlayStation. In 2003 it was included in &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot;, a compilation of arcade games for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. In 2005 it was included in &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play&quot; for the PlayStation Portable. In 2006 it was a bonus feature in &quot;&quot;. In 2012, it was included in the compilation &quot;Midway Arcade Origins&quot;.

In 1997, Tiger Electronics released a handheld LCD version of the game. In 2017, Basic Fun released a mini arcade port of the NES version of the game with Ralph added. This was #10 of their Arcade Classics line.

&quot;Rampage&quot; is an unlockable in the 2015 game &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;.
In July 2000, Midway licensed &quot;Rampage&quot;, along with other Williams Electronics games, to Shockwave for use in an online applet to demonstrate the power of the shockwave web content platform, entitled &quot;Shockwave Arcade Collection&quot;. The conversion was created by Digital Eclipse. &quot;Rampage&quot; was also ported to iOS as part of the Midway arcade app.

In 2018, Arcade1Up released a mini 4-foot version of the original arcade cabinet.

==Reception==
The game was a financial success in arcades, and one of the last successful titles for Bally/Midway.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; approved of the MS-DOS adaptation of &quot;Rampage&quot;, especially for those with computers faster than the original IBM PC and an EGA video card. It stated that &quot;Rampage is proof that IBM games can compete with other machines in running entertainment software&quot;.

&quot;Your Sinclair&quot; said it was &quot;all great fun for a while but being a monster can become a drag. So unless you intend to play it three-handed, when the fun factor increases a little, or you&#x27;re a monster fan of the original, you might just give this a miss for something with more lasting value&quot;.

===Lynx===
&quot;CVG Magazine&quot; reviewed the Lynx version of the game in their March 1991 issue, giving it a score of 60% score. Robert A. Jung reviewed the game which was posted to IGN Entertainment in July 1999. In his final verdict, he wrote that &quot;a lighthearted, silly game that&#x27;s lots of fun for lots of players (the more the merrier)&quot;, giving a final score of 9 out of 10.

==Legacy==
In 1997, &quot;Rampage World Tour&quot; was released, developed for Midway by the original designers, Brian Colin and Jeff Nauman. It was followed by the console-exclusive games &quot;Rampage 2: Universal Tour&quot;, &quot;Rampage Through Time&quot;, and &quot;Rampage Puzzle Attack&quot;. The last game in the series made by Midway was &quot;&quot;.

A 2018 arcade reboot was made by Adrenaline Amusements for Warner Bros., based on the 2018 &quot;Rampage&quot; film. Initially released exclusively for Dave &amp; Buster&#x27;s, it includes redemption game mechanics.

===Film adaptation===

A theatrical film adaptation loosely based on the game was developed by Warner Bros and New Line Cinema, directed by Brad Peyton and starring Dwayne Johnson with John Rickard and Beau Flynn as producers. The film features the classic trio of George, Lizzie and Ralph, this time as mutated animals rather than transformed humans. The film was released on April 13, 2018.

<doc id="1038803" wikidata="Q148699" url="?curid=1038803" title="Kevin Nolan">
<text>Kevin Anthony Jance Nolan (born 24 June 1982) is an English former professional footballer and coach, who manages Northampton Town. He has represented England at under-21 level.

After growing up in Toxteth, Liverpool, Nolan signed for Bolton Wanderers at the age of 16. Part of the team that beat Preston North End in the 2001 First Division play-offs to gain promotion to the Premier League, he soon became a regular first-team player for the club. He scored as Bolton beat Manchester United at Old Trafford in both of his first two seasons in the top tier of English football, as well as important goals that helped Bolton regularly finish in the top half of the Premier League table.

Nolan was also a first team regular as Bolton qualified for the UEFA Cup for the first time in the club&#x27;s history—where they reached the knockout stages. Following the departure of Jay-Jay Okocha in 2006, Nolan was appointed as the team captain, and he led the team again to UEFA Cup qualification and, again, eventual progression to the knockout round of the competition.

Following the arrival of Gary Megson as Bolton manager, the team&#x27;s and Nolan&#x27;s performances were criticised by a section of the club&#x27;s fans. This resulted in the midfielder completing a £4 million transfer to Newcastle United in the January 2009 transfer window.
He formed part of the team who were relegated to the Championship at the end of the season, but his performances the following season were widely praised, as he scored 18 goals—including the first hat-trick of his career—to help the club gain promotion back to the Premier League as the division&#x27;s champions. Following promotion, Nolan was promoted to club captain.

In the summer of 2011 Nolan joined West Ham United on a five-year contract, joining up again with Sam Allardyce, his former manager at Bolton. He was appointed captain soon after his arrival and led the team to an instant return to the Premier League. Nolan left West Ham United by mutual consent in August 2015, and the following January he took over as player-manager at Leyton Orient, losing his managerial role in April. In January 2017, he took the same position at Notts County. On 26 August 2018, Nolan parted company with Notts County.

==Early life==
Born on 24 June 1982 in Liverpool, Merseyside, Nolan was brought up by a football-playing family in Toxteth, and wanted to be a footballer from a young age. He attended Liverpool Blue Coat School and in 1996, he was playing for the City of Liverpool&#x27;s schoolboys team. As a child, he supported Celtic and Liverpool, although conversely, his favourite players were Eric Cantona and Lee Sharpe of Manchester United.

==Club career==
===Bolton Wanderers===
Nolan was invited to a Bolton Wanderers youth team training session by a friend, and was soon signed up to the club&#x27;s books. At the age of 16, he was handed a year-to-year contract, coinciding with the opening of Bolton&#x27;s academy. A year later, he signed professional terms and made his first team debut. He played the whole match, as Bolton Wanderers beat Preston North End in the First Division play-off, winning promotion to the Premier League.

In the 2001–02 season, his first in the Premier League, Nolan scored eight league goals, including two at Leicester City on the opening day of the season. He also scored Bolton&#x27;s first goal as they beat Manchester United 2–1 at Old Trafford. The following season, he scored at Old Trafford again; Nolan&#x27;s only goal of the season was the winner at Old Trafford in the game which saw Bolton record their second shock win at the ground in as many seasons, this time winning 1–0. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was reported to have been seen scouting Nolan. Despite that win early in the season, the club were only saved from relegation from the Premier League on the final day of the season with a win against Middlesbrough.

In the 2003–04 season, Nolan&#x27;s goals against Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur helped Bolton finish eighth in the league. He also scored as the club beat Villa 5–2 in the semi-finals of the League Cup, and was part of the team that was defeated 2–1 by Middlesbrough in the final.&lt;ref name=&quot;PL03/04&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this defeat, Nolan&#x27;s goals—a career-best 12 in all competitions—helped Bolton to their highest Premier League finishing position in over forty years.

The following season, Nolan was part of the team who reached the FA Cup quarter-final, before being defeated by Arsenal at the Reebok Stadium. Bolton also progressed in the league, with a 1–1 draw with Portsmouth in the final game of the season, and Nolan&#x27;s four league goals helping to secure UEFA Cup qualification for the first time in their history. The club reached the last 32 of the UEFA Cup the following season, with Nolan&#x27;s goal in the first round defeat of Lokomotiv Plovdiv helping the club reach the group stages. He scored the winner as the club overcame Zenit St. Petersburg 1–0 in the group stages, and a further nine in the league to help Bolton finish eighth, missing out on European qualification.

The 2006–07 season saw Nolan take over from the departed Jay-Jay Okocha as club captain. His three league goals helped Bolton to again qualify for the UEFA Cup. Nolan&#x27;s long throw-in set up a goal, which helped Bolton achieve a 2–2 draw away against German champions Bayern Munich, who dominated the match. Despite reaching the first knockout round, Bolton&#x27;s league form suffered as they were pulled into a relegation fight, eventually finishing the season one point above the relegation zone in 16th. Nolan scored in the 2–0 win over Sunderland in May that virtually secured the club&#x27;s Premier League status.

Having made 323 league appearances for the club, in January 2009, Nolan began talks with representatives of Newcastle United over a move to the north-east club, following perceived criticism of his performances by some of the club&#x27;s supporters.

===Newcastle United===
On 29 January 2009, it was revealed that Newcastle had agreed a £4 million fee with Bolton Wanderers, which was confirmed the next day, with Nolan travelling to Tyneside to discuss terms and undergo a medical. Nolan completed his move on the same day, signing a -year contract. On 22 February, Nolan received his first red card playing for Newcastle United in a home match against Everton for a two-footed foul on Victor Anichebe. At the end of the season, Newcastle were relegated to the English Championship. Nolan was noted as one of the more vocal Newcastle players over the summer, demanding an end to the off the field distractions at the club, and suggesting the club should be looking to acquire players for an immediate return to the Premier League.

Nolan played a key role in Newcastle&#x27;s push for promotion the following season; he scored his first league goal for Newcastle on 22 August against Crystal Palace, and the first hat-trick of his career, as part of a 4–0 away win against Ipswich Town on 26 September.
Nolan captained Newcastle for the first time in a 5–1 win against Cardiff City taking over for the absent Nicky Butt and Alan Smith. After an 11-game goal drought, Nolan picked up his 11th league goal of the season on 20 February against Preston North End in a 3–0 win. He followed this up with the final goal in Newcastle&#x27;s 6–1 home drubbing of Barnsley two games later. He was voted as the Championship Player of the Year at the Football League Awards on 16 March. On 5 April 2010, Newcastle United secured automatic promotion to the Premier League, after fellow contenders Nottingham Forest failed to beat Cardiff City. Newcastle took to the field hours later, in front of 48,750 fans, and Nolan scored the winner with a scissor-kick in the 2–1 win over Sheffield United.

Nolan was named as the new Newcastle United club captain for the 2010–11 season, succeeding the retired Nicky Butt. Nolan scored his first goals of the season as he netted a brace in Newcastle&#x27;s 6–0 win against Aston Villa in their first home game. On 31 October 2010, Nolan scored his first Premier League hat-trick, achieving the feat in the Tyne–Wear derby against Sunderland in a 5–1 home win. Nolan scored the opener against Liverpool in new manager Alan Pardew&#x27;s first game in charge on 11 December 2010, which Newcastle went on to win 3–1. Nolan scored the opening goal in the second derby of the season against Sunderland on 16 January, which finished 1–1. On 26 February 2011, Nolan scored his 50th Premier League goal, against his former club, Bolton Wanderers at St James&#x27; Park, which finished 1–1.

===West Ham United===

West Ham confirmed the signing of Nolan on 16 June 2011 for an undisclosed fee on a five-year contract, taking over the vacant number 4 shirt. Due to the departure of the previous West Ham captain, Matthew Upson, who moved to Stoke City, Nolan was immediately made captain. His league debut came on 7 August 2011 in a 1–0 home defeat to Cardiff City. Nolan scored his first goal for West Ham on 13 August 2011 in a 1–0 away win against Doncaster Rovers; his first home goal coming on 26 November, when scored a 25-yard volley in a 3–1 win against Derby County. On 7 May 2012 en route to the play-off final at Wembley, Nolan scored his thirteenth goal for the club against Cardiff City in a 3–0 win, sealing West Ham&#x27;s Wembley appearance. On 19 May 2012 he captained West Ham in the 2012 Championship play-off final against Blackpool. West Ham won the match 2–1 with goals from Carlton Cole and Ricardo Vaz Tê sending them back to the Premier League after a one-season absence.

Nolan continued his good form into the 2012–13 season and scored his first goal of the season on the opening day, scoring the only goal of the game in a 1–0 win against Aston Villa. On 1 September, he scored inside one minute during a 3–0 win at home to Fulham. He scored his third goal of the season on 22 September, rescuing a point for West Ham by scoring in added time in a 1–1 draw at home to Sunderland. On 20 April 2013 Nolan scored his 100th career goal, netting the second goal in a 2–0 home victory against Wigan Athletic. Nolan wrapped up the 2012–13 season by scoring his second Premier League hat-trick in a 4–2 win against Reading on 19 May 2013. This hat-trick meant that Nolan had scored 10 league goals in a season for the fourth season in succession.

Nolan started the 2013–14 campaign by scoring in the first game of the season again, in a 2–0 home win against Cardiff City. West Ham struggled in the first half of the season and Nolan&#x27;s influence on games was described as &quot;low key&quot;. In December 2013 he was sent-off at Anfield in a defeat by Liverpool for a foul on Jordan Henderson. After serving a three match ban he was dismissed again, in only his second match back, for a foul on Fulham&#x27;s Fernando Amorebieta in a 2–1 defeat at Craven Cottage. He was fined two weeks wages, £100,000, by West Ham with manager Sam Allardyce considering removing the captaincy of the club from Nolan. Nolan finished as top scorer for West Ham in the 2013–14 season.

At the start of the 2014–15 season he played in the first game, a 1–0 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur but before their second game he fractured his shoulder in training, an injury which was expected to keep him out of football for at least six weeks.
 Nolan played 29 games for West Ham in the 2014–15 season, 10 after coming on as a substitute. Having been top scorer in the previous two seasons, he scored a single goal, in a 2–1 away win against West Bromwich Albion in December 2014. Nolan received criticism for some of his performances during the season, notably from some West Ham supporters and from Jack Sullivan, the son of West Ham&#x27;s co-chairman, David Sullivan.

His last game for the club came on 22 August 2015 against AFC Bournemouth. Starting the game, Nolan was substituted for Matt Jarvis at half-time with his side already 2–0 behind in an eventual 4–3 home loss. Five days later, Nolan left West Ham United by mutual consent after four years at the club. He had played 157 games for West Ham in all competitions, scoring 31 goals.

===Leyton Orient===
On 21 January 2016, Nolan was announced as the player-manager of Leyton Orient, signing a -year deal with the club. Two days later, he won his first match as manager in League Two, 2–0 at Wycombe Wanderers, with himself as an unused substitute. On 26 January, against Newport County at Brisbane Road, he made his debut in the 79th minute for Calaum Jahraldo-Martin, and sent in the cross from which the O&#x27;s won a penalty kick which Jay Simpson converted for the only goal of the game. He made his first start for the club in the away game against Portsmouth on 6 February, where he played 70 minutes in a 1-0 victory for Leyton Orient.

Nolan&#x27;s Orient team won three of the four league games in his first full month of management, only losing to league leaders, Northampton Town, and keeping three clean sheets. This led to him being nominated for February&#x27;s manager of the month award, which eventually went to Chris Wilder of Northampton. On 12 April 2016, with the team two points off the play-offs, Nolan was relieved of his duties as manager of Orient, the role transferring to Andy Hessenthaler. He left the club altogether on 6 July.

===Notts County===
On 12 January 2017, Nolan was appointed manager of Notts County, replacing the sacked John Sheridan. He inherited a team that had lost its last ten matches and was a point from the relegation places in League Two. Two days later in his first game in charge, the &quot;Magpies&quot; earned a goalless draw at home to Nottinghamshire rivals Mansfield Town. On 30 January, Nolan registered as a player, though he did not play during his time at Notts. Under his management, the team avoided relegation.

On 20 September 2017, with Notts County in second place in League Two, Nolan signed a new three-year contract. County owner Alan Hardy said: &quot;Kevin has brought real pride, optimism and stability to this club which has not been seen for many years&quot;. In addition, he won the EFL League Two Manager of the Month award, the first honour of his managerial career.

On 26 August 2018, Nolan was dismissed as manager of Notts County after a six-game winless run.

===Northampton Town===
On 23 December 2024, Nolan was appointed as manager of Northampton Town on a two-and-a-half-year contract, replacing Jon Brady who had resigned three weeks earlier. 
His first game as manager, on 26 December ended in a 4–1 defeat away to Reading.

==Coaching career==
In February 2020, Nolan was appointed as first team coach at West Ham United.
Upon the departure of club manager, David Moyes in May 2024, Nolan left the club with other coaches and back-room staff.

In August 2024, Nolan was appointed interim assistant head coach of the England U20 team, supporting Paul Nevin whom he had coached with at West Ham United.

==International career==
Nolan has previously been called up to the England Under-18s and Under-21s and some commentators acknowledged that he could be a future candidate for the England squad. Reports have claimed that Nolan could be called up to the Republic of Ireland or Netherlands squads due to his ancestry.

On 12 November 2012, Nolan was quoted saying he has been left hurt by being regularly overlooked by England managers. He held the record for the most Premier League appearances without winning an England cap (401 appearances), but has since been overtaken by former West Ham teammate, Mark Noble.

==Personal life==
Nolan became engaged in 2005, and married his fiancée Hayley in the summer of 2008. The couple had their first child, a daughter, in November 2006. Their second child, a son, was born in January 2010.

<text>Sidi Ifni (Berber: &quot;Ifni&quot;, ⵉⴼⵏⵉ, ) is a city located on the west coast of Morocco, on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, with a population of 20,051 people. The economic base of the city is fishing. It is located in Guelmim-Oued Noun region and Sidi Ifni Province. Its inhabitants are the Shilha from the ethnic group. In 2000, an important fishing port was completed, which serves as a base for fish exports.

==History==
The Aït Baâmrane ethnic group have long inhabited the small town and the surrounding region. The people worked in husbandry and traded with Europeans and northern Morocco, being intermediaries in the trans-Saharan trade. 
In 1476, an enclave in the region of present-day Sidi Ifni was occupied by forces from the Spanish peninsula, which named its settlement there Santa Cruz de la Mar Pequeña. It remained in Spanish hands until 1524 when it was captured by forces of the Saadi Sultanate.

Historically, Sidi Ifni is claimed to be the location of Santa Cruz de la Mar Pequeña, which had been long pursued by Spain, who built a small coastal fortress there in the 15th century. Although the existence of the fortress is widely documented, historians could not determine its exact location along the coast between Agadir and Tarfaya. In 1860, following the Spanish-Moroccan War, Morocco ceded Sidi Ifni and the territory of Ifni to Spain as a part of the Treaty of Tangiers. During the period often termed the &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot;, in 1884 Spain acquired what is now Western Sahara. Spain occupied Sidi Ifni and Western Sahara jointly, although the latter was known at the time as Spanish Sahara, Río de Oro or Saguia el-Hamra.

Until 1952, the Ifni region had the status of a protectorate. In that year, the region became part of Spanish West Africa, an entity that combined the colonies of Spanish Sahara and Cape Juby, with its capital located in Villa Bens; now called Tarfaya and currently in Morocco.

When Morocco obtained its independence from France, and then Spain, in 1956, it claimed the territory several times. The first was in August 1957, by stating that the French-Spanish treaty from 1912 had been abrogated. By late 1957 serious incidents had occurred at the border, starting the Ifni War, where Ifni garrisons were attacked by irregular troops led by Moroccan nationalists of the Istiqlal party, supported tacitly by the king. They called themselves the Moroccan Liberation Army.

The Spanish Army retreated from most territory with the purpose of establishing a defensive line limited to Sidi Ifni and its surroundings, while the Moroccan Liberation Army took control of the abandoned territory. The war was never formally declared nor finished, but on 1 April 1958, Spain and Morocco signed the Agreements of Angra de Cintra, by which Cape Juby was ceded to Morocco in June 1958. The lost territories of Ifni region were never regained by Spain, but were integrated into Morocco. Once the defensive line at Sidi Ifni was settled, the city remained under Spanish rule as a province of Spain, comparable to the Spanish enclave cities, Ceuta and Melilla, on the northern coast of Morocco.

In 1969, under international pressure, Spain relinquished Sidi Ifni to Morocco.

==Ifni protests==
In June 2008 there were violent protests in Sidi Ifni. Media reports first cited eight protesters killed by police force, but this claim was later not substantiated.

On 30 May, dozens of unemployed workers had begun blocking the port to protest against not having been employed there. Unloading of fish was hindered. The following day, barriers were erected around the port. Several mediation efforts with local officials gave no result. On 6 June, around 500–600 people protested in the town and, moved by rumours that a police force from Tiznit or Agadir was to arrive, in the early hours of 7 June the protesters blocked several entrances to the town. A local official was severely harassed by the protesters. At 06:30 a police force composed of some 8,000 agents entered the city, dispersed the protesters employing rubber bullets and reopened the port. Many protesters fled to the surrounding mountains. The police then entered houses in the neighbourhoods of Boulaalame and Lalla Meryem and started to arrest people violently. Abuse, harassment and theft took place. Around 182 people were detained and all but 10 were freed later that day. Twelve cases of torture leading to up to 30 days of temporal incapacity and around 35 cases of aggression or harassment were proven by the Moroccan Human Rights organisation OMDH.

On 7 June the Qatar-owned TV chain Al Jazeera stated that eight to ten people had been killed during the police intervention. Amnesty International in 2009 reported &quot;They [the Moroccan police] also conducted unauthorized raids on homes, confiscated property, verbally and sexually harassed people, and carried out arbitrary arrests and detentions.&quot; The relations between the Moroccan government and Al Jazeera seriously deteriorated and in July, Brahim Sbaalil, a spokesperson for the Islamist-leaning Centre Marocain des Droits Humain (CMDH) that had echoed the claims, was condemned to six months in prison for &quot;spreading false accusations&quot;.

==Unique sea cable car system==

To better utilise its ocean-shipping potential, Spanish authorities in the 1960s conceived and installed a unique ship-offloading system in the shallow waters of the Sidi Ifni port. Since the waters were too shallow to allow ships to reach shore, a concrete bastion was built at 550 metres offshore. It held a derrick and crane. Cargo and personnel were lifted from a ship, then moved to another station near the cliffs east of town, using self-propelled carts slung from large steel cables. The cables were supported by several pylons. This system operated for a few years (until Spain finally ceded the territory to Morocco), then fell into disrepair. The cables have disappeared, but the end stations and pylons are still visible.

==Climate==
Influenced by the cold Canary Current, Sidi Ifni has a hot desert climate (Köppen &quot;BWh&quot;) with mild to warm weather all year round, and very slight, erratic rainfall. This rain falls only during the winter months from November to April, and generally is significant only when the North Atlantic Oscillation is negative and drives the winter frontal storms (that normally remain well north of central Morocco) into the region.

<doc id="1038815" wikidata="Q354424" url="?curid=1038815" title="Iphicrates">
<text>Iphicrates (; ) was an Athenian general, who flourished in the earlier half of the 4th century BC. He is credited with important infantry reforms that revolutionized ancient Greek warfare by regularizing light-armed peltasts.

Cornelius Nepos wrote that Iphicrates was such a leader, that he was not only comparable to the first commanders of his own time, but no one even of the older generals could be set above him. He had a deep knowledge of military tactics, he often had the command of armies and he never miscarried in an undertaking by his own fault. He was always eminent for invention and excellence that he not only introduced much that was new into the military art, but made many improvements in what existed before.

==Biography==
The son of a shoemaker of the deme of Rhamnous, he was later married to the daughter of the Thracian King Cotys I and had a son with her. His son was named Menestheus (Μενεσθεύς), after the legendary King of Athens during the Trojan War. Iphicrates&#x27; other son, who was also called Iphicrates, was sent as the Athenian ambassador to the Persian court sometime before 335 BC. He was captured by Alexander the Great along with the Persian court and other Greek ambassadors in the aftermath of the Battle of Issus. Alexander treated him with special honour, both from friendship to the city of Athens and from recollection of his father&#x27;s glory; when he died from an unknown disease Alexander paid for the transportation of his body to his homeland.

When Eurydice I of Macedon asked Iphicrates (the elder) to protect her sons after the death of Amyntas III of Macedon, he took them under his protection.

Plutarch wrote that Iphicrates thought that the mercenary soldier might well be fond of wealth and fond of pleasure, in order that his quest for the means to gratify his desires might lead him to fight with greater recklessness.

===Iphicratean reforms===
He owes his fame as much to the improvements he made in the equipment of the peltasts or light-armed mercenaries (named for their small &quot;pelte&quot; shield) as to his military successes. Historians have debated about just what kind of &quot;peltasts&quot; were affected by his reforms; one of the most popular positions is that he improved the performance of the Greek skirmishers so that they would be able to engage in prolonged hand-to-hand fighting as part of the main battle line, while another strong opinion posits that he worked his changes upon the mercenary hoplites that were an important factor in late 5th and early 4th century BC Greek land warfare. A third possibility is that his reforms were limited to hoplites serving as marines on board ships of the Athenian navy.

Traditional Greek infantry soldiers used very large shields, short spears and small swords; Iphicrates introduced the smaller and lighter pelte shields, which helped them be more active in movements and encounters, doubled the length of the spears and made the swords longer. In place of bronze cuirasses he promoted use of the linen linothorax, which offered protection equivalent to metal armour at a greatly lessened weight. He also made lightweight soldiers&#x27; boots that were easy to untie. These boots were afterwards called Iphicratides (). The longer weapons, combined with the lighter armor and shield, helped his troops to move rapidly and take a more aggressive approach in tactical situations.

Iphicrates was a strict commander who paid special attention to drill and maneuver. Cornelius Nepos mentions that no troops in Greece were ever better disciplined or more obedient to the orders of their leader than those of Iphicrates.

The Iphicratean reforms are considered to have been one of the leading influences on Philip II of Macedon, when he created the &quot;sarissa&quot;-armed Macedonian phalanx. His son, Alexander the Great, used this new infantry formation in his many conquests.

===Corinthian War===
When Iphicrates invaded the territory of Phlius, the men from the city came out against him in an unguarded way, but Iphicrates had set an ambush and his troops killed many of them.

Iphicrates and his troops invaded many districts of Arcadia, plundering unprotected areas and even attacking walled towns. The hoplites of the Arcadians stayed within their walls rather than face Iphicrates&#x27; famous peltasts.

With his troops, Iphicrates dealt the Spartans a heavy blow in 392/390 BC by almost annihilating a &quot;mora&quot; (a battalion of about 600 men) of their famous hoplites at the Battle of Lechaeum near Corinth. Following up success, he took city after city for the Athenians during the Corinthian War; but in consequence of a quarrel with the Argives he was transferred from Corinth to the Hellespont, where he was equally successful.

===Thrace - Seuthes===

After the Peace of Antalcidas (387 BC) he assisted Seuthes, king of Thracian Odrysae, who was an ally of the Athenians, to recover his kingdom, and fought against Cotys, with whom, however, he subsequently concluded an alliance.

===Egyptian campaign===

Around 378 BC, he was sent with a force of mercenaries to assist the Persians to reconquer Egypt, but a dispute with Pharnabazus II led to the failure of the expedition. On his return to Athens he commanded an expedition in 373 BC for the relief of Corcyra, which was besieged by the Lacedaemonians.

===Thrace - Cotys===
After the peace of 371 BC, Iphicrates returned to Thrace and somewhat tarnished his fame by siding with his father-in-law Cotys I in a war against Athens for the possession of the entire Thracian Chersonese. Iphicrates, however, refused to besiege the Athenian strongholds and fled to Antissa.

===Social War===
The Athenians soon pardoned him and gave him a joint command in the Social War against some of their allies from the second Athenian Empire. He and two of his colleagues were impeached by Chares, the fourth commander, because they had refused to give battle during a violent storm.

Iphicrates was acquitted but sentenced to pay a heavy fine. Afterwards, he remained at Athens until his death around 353 BC (although according to some he retired to Thrace).

<text>Patrick Albert Crispin Marber (born 19 September 1964) is an English comedian, playwright, director, actor, and screenwriter.

==Early life==
Marber was born and raised in a middle-class Jewish family in Wimbledon, London, the son of Angela (Benjamin), a theatre secretary, and Brian Marber, a technical analyst. He was educated at Rokeby School, St Paul&#x27;s School, Cranleigh School, and Wadham College, Oxford where he studied English.

==Career==

===Comedy performer===
After working for a few years as a stand-up comedian, primarily as part of a comedy double act with author Guy Browning, Marber became a writer and cast member on the radio shows &quot;On the Hour&quot; and &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot;, and their television spinoffs &quot;The Day Today&quot; and &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You... with Alan Partridge&quot;. Amongst other roles, Marber portrayed hapless reporter Peter O&#x27;Hanraha-hanrahan in both &quot;On the Hour&quot; and &quot;The Day Today&quot;, and was involved in a dispute with the comedians Stewart Lee and Richard Herring, who had written for &quot;On the Hour&quot;, about who had invented the character. Lee and Herring&#x27;s TV show &quot;Fist of Fun&quot; would later make several references to their feud with Marber, calling him a &quot;Cornish curmudgeon&quot;. In Stewart Lee&#x27;s 2010 book, &quot;How I Escaped My Certain Fate&quot;, Marber is referred to as a &quot;new Shakespeare&quot;. Marber reunited with the &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot; team in 2003 to record commentaries for the DVD release of the show. He also contributed some new in-character audio material to the DVD release of &quot;The Day Today&quot; in 2004.

He co-writes &quot;Bunk Bed&quot; for BBC Radio 4, which he created with Peter Curran. It was first broadcast during April 2014, with the fifth series broadcast in 2018, with special guest Jane Horrocks.

===Plays and direction===
Marber&#x27;s first play was &quot;Dealer&#x27;s Choice&quot;, which he also directed. Set in a restaurant and based around a game of poker (and partly inspired by his own experiences with gambling addiction), it opened at the National Theatre in February 1995, and won the 1995 &quot;Evening Standard Theatre Award&quot; for Best Comedy.

&quot;After Miss Julie&quot;, a version of the Strindberg play &quot;Miss Julie&quot;, was broadcast on BBC television in the same year. In this, Marber moves the action to Britain in 1945, at the time of the Labour Party&#x27;s victory in the general election, with Miss Julie as the daughter of a Labour peer. A stage version, directed by Michael Grandage, was first performed 2003 at the Donmar Warehouse, London by Kelly Reilly, Richard Coyle and Helen Baxendale. It later had a production at the American Airlines Theatre on Broadway in 2009.

His play &quot;Closer&quot;, a comedy of sex, dishonesty, and betrayal, opened at the National Theatre in 1997, again directed by Marber. This too won the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; award for Best Comedy, as well as the Critics&#x27; Circle Theatre Awards and Laurence Olivier awards for Best New Play. It has proved to be an international success, having been translated into thirty languages. A film adaptation, written by Marber, was released in 2004, directed by Mike Nichols and starring Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen.

In &quot;Howard Katz&quot;, his next play, Marber presented very different subject matter: a middle-aged man struggling with life, death and religion. This was first performed in 2001, again at the National Theatre, but was less favourably received by the critics and has been less of a commercial success than some of his other work. A new production by the Roundabout Theatre Company opened Off-Broadway in March 2007, with Alfred Molina in the title role. A play for young people, &quot;The Musicians&quot;, about a school orchestra&#x27;s visit to Russia, was performed for the National Theatre&#x27;s Shell Connections programme in 2004, its first production being at the Sydney Opera House.

&quot;Don Juan in Soho&quot;, his contemporary rendering of Molière&#x27;s comedy &quot;Dom Juan&quot;, opened at the Donmar Warehouse in 2006, directed by Michael Grandage and with Rhys Ifans in the lead role.

He also co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;Asylum&quot; (2005), directed by David Mackenzie, and was sole screenwriter for the film &quot;Notes on a Scandal&quot; (2006), for which he was nominated for an Oscar at the 79th Academy Awards.

In June 2015, his play, &quot;The Red Lion&quot;, opened at the National Theatre.

In 2016 he directed a revival of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s play &quot;Travesties&quot; at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London which, after a sell-out run, transferred with the same cast to the Apollo Theatre in the West End. The revival was nominated for five Olivier Awards and in spring 2018 it transferred to Broadway with Marber directing at the American Airlines Theatre.

Marber&#x27;s theatre directing credits include &quot;Blue Remembered Hills&quot; by Dennis Potter, (National Theatre), &quot;The Old Neighbourhood&quot; by David Mamet, (Royal Court Theatre, London) and &quot;The Caretaker&quot; by Harold Pinter, (Comedy Theatre, London). In 2004, Marber was Cameron Mackintosh Professor of Contemporary Theatre at Oxford University.

He directed Tom Stoppard&#x27;s play &quot;Leopoldstadt&quot;, set in the Jewish community of early 20th-century Vienna, which premiered at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in 2020. The play closed during the pandemic and re-opened on 7 August 2021 for a 12 week run, ending on 30 October 2021. &quot;Leopoldstadt&quot; had its North American premiere at the Longacre Theatre on Broadway on 2 October 2022, with Marber directing, for which he won the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play. He directed Alan Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Habeas Corpus&quot; from 3 December 2021 to 26 February 2022 at the Menier Chocolate Factory; the run was also delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Other activities ===
Marber was a director of Lewes FC, driving forward a scheme for the club to be community owned from July 2010.

==Personal life==
Since 2002, Marber has been married to actress Debra Gillett. They have three children.

<text>Roy Oxley (9 March 1905 – 1980) was a production designer at BBC Television who became famous after the BBC chose him to model for a photograph to be shown during their adaptation of George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

Oxley began working in set design in 1948, as an art decorator in the film &quot;London Belongs to Me&quot;. He also supervised the art decoration of the 1949 film, &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot;.

Oxley had been working for some years as set decorator for BBC when he was chosen, as an in-house joke, to model for the character of &quot;Big Brother&quot; in &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. &quot;Big Brother&quot; was not actually a participating character in the programme; his face was only shown on various posters and billboards seen during the adaptation.

Oxley worked at several other productions as a production designer with the BBC, including seven episodes of the Douglas Wilmer version of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, various episodes of &quot;Z-Cars&quot; and an adaptation for television of Dylan Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. In 1969, he won a BAFTA Award for Production Design for his work of the BBC play &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot;.

==Personal life==
He was married to Jean; they had two children.

<doc id="1038829" wikidata="Q1225080" url="?curid=1038829" title="John Farquhar Munro">
<text>John Farquhar Munro (Gaelic: &quot;Iain Fearchar Rothach&quot;; 26 August 1934 – 26 January 2014) was a Scottish Liberal Democrat politician. He was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Ross, Skye and Inverness West from 1999 until his retirement in 2011.

Previously a crofter and a local councillor for 33 years, including 11 years as Convener of Skye and Lochalsh District Council, he was first elected to the Scottish Parliament at the 1999 election. Running against him for Labour was Donnie Munro, former member of the band Runrig, but Munro won by 1,539 votes. He was one of three Lib Dem MSPs to oppose his party&#x27;s coalition with the Labour Party (along with Keith Raffan and Donald Gorrie) and deviated from the Executive on a number of issues (such as land reform, on which he believed they were not moving quickly enough).

He was prominent within the parliament in opposing the Skye Bridge tolls, to the extent of threatening to resign from the Lib Dems if they were not removed. The tolls were abolished in December 2004.

As befitted one of the few native Gaelic speakers in the Scottish Parliament, he co-sponsored (along with the Scottish National Party&#x27;s Michael Russell) a bill to secure the language&#x27;s status as being equal to English. He was angry when the Labour-Liberal Scottish Executive refused to back it.

He was re-elected to the Scottish Parliament at the 2003 election with an increased share of the vote.

After the 2007 election he was the oldest MSP in Holyrood. He stepped down as an MSP at the 2011 Scottish Parliament general election, at which time his constituency was abolished.

In a surprise move Munro expressed support for Alex Salmond in the 2011 Scottish Parliament elections.

He died at his home on 26 January 2014.

<text>A person having ordinary skill in the art (abbreviated PHOSITA), a person of (ordinary) skill in the art (POSITA or PSITA), a person skilled in the art, a skilled addressee or simply a skilled person is a legal fiction found in many patent laws throughout the world. This hypothetical person is considered to have in a particular technical field (an &quot;art&quot;), without being a genius. This measure mainly serves as a reference for determining, or at least evaluating, whether an invention is non-obvious or not (in U.S. patent law), or involves an inventive step or not (in European patent laws). If it would have been obvious for this fictional person to come up with the invention while starting from the prior art, then the particular invention is considered not patentable.

In some patent laws, the person skilled in the art is also used as a reference in the context of other criteria, for instance in order to determine whether an invention is sufficiently disclosed in the description of the patent or patent application (sufficiency of disclosure is a fundamental requirement in most patent laws), or in order to determine whether two technical means are equivalents when evaluating infringement (see also doctrine of equivalents).

In practice, this legal fiction is a set of legal fictions which evolved over time and which may be differently construed for different purposes. This legal fiction basically translates the need for each invention to be considered in the context of the technical field it belongs to.

== Canada ==
The &quot;Patent Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. P-4)&quot; makes explicit reference to a &quot;person skilled in the art&quot; in the s. 28.3 requirement that the subject matter of a patent be non-obvious.

The &quot;person skilled in the art&quot; is described in &quot;Beloit Canada Ltd. v. Valmet Oy&quot;:
the technician skilled in the art but having no scintilla of inventiveness or imagination; a paragon of deduction and dexterity, wholly devoid of intuition; a triumph of the left hemisphere over the right. The question to be asked is whether this mythical creature (the man in the Clapham omnibus of patent law) would, in the light of the state of the art and of common general knowledge as at the claimed date of invention, have come directly and without difficulty to the solution taught by the patent.

== European Patent Convention ==
The European Patent Convention (EPC) refers to the skilled person in and provides for that &quot;an invention shall be considered as involving an inventive step if, having regard to the state of the art, it is not obvious to a person skilled in the art&quot;.

The EPC also refers to the skilled person in , which requires that &quot;[t]he European patent application must disclose the invention in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art&quot;.

Still further, the Protocol on the Interpretation of refers to the skilled person. Article 1, 2nd sentence, states that &quot;[n]or should it [Article 69 EPC] be taken to mean that the claims serve only as a guideline and that the actual protection conferred may extend to what, from a consideration of the description and the drawings by a &quot;person skilled in the art&quot;, the patent proprietor has contemplated&quot;.

The European Patent Office provides guidelines that set forth some of the skilled person&#x27;s capabilities.

A related concept is the &quot;business person&quot;, who is also a notional person. It is used at the EPO when assessing inventive step of an invention involving both technical and non-technical elements. The business person &quot;represents an abstraction or shorthand for a separation of business considerations from technical&quot;.

== United States ==
A person having ordinary skill in the art is a legal fiction first codified in the Patent Act of 1952. The PHOSITA is a test of &quot;obviousness&quot; which is one of the largest gray areas in patent law. The concept was carried over into the Leahy–Smith America Invents Act:

The PHOSITA appears again in slightly different words in the provision requiring a proper disclosure:
=== Comparison ===
Quite similar to the logic of &quot;reasonable person&quot; used in the common law of torts as a test of negligence, the PHOSITA is a hypothetical individual, neither a genius nor a layperson, created in the mind of a patent examiner or the jury to see if a claimed invention is too obvious to be patented.

=== Creation ===
During the examination of a patent application, the examiner tries to find out if that invention has already been invented by another person. If so, the patent application will be returned to the applicant to be narrowed or modified. If not, the examiner will bring out the PHOSITA test to check if that invention is so obvious that people in the trade will invent it with or without patent applicant&#x27;s efforts. In the end, if the examiner can not discover a piece of prior art that may lead the PHOSITA to the invention, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is required by statute to award that applicant a patent.

It is well known that it may take a few months or a couple of years for a paper to be published in a peer reviewed academic journal. The date of a sanctioned prior art can be a little later than the patent&#x27;s application date:

=== Capacity ===
The term &quot;ordinary skill&quot; is not rigidly defined.

: Factors that may be considered in determining level of ordinary skill in the art include
:* the educational level of the inventor;
:* type of problems encountered in the art;
:* prior art solutions to those problems;
:* rapidity with which innovations are made;
:* sophistication of the technology; and
:* educational level of active workers in the field.

=== &quot;KSR v. Teleflex&quot; ===

The Supreme Court reversed a decision by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit based on how the lower court defined the capabilities of a PHOSITA. &quot;KSR v. Teleflex&quot; was decided by a unanimous Supreme Court on April 30, 2007.

Importantly, Justice Anthony Kennedy&#x27;s opinion stated, &quot;A person of ordinary skill is also a person of ordinary creativity, not an automaton.&quot; Although the Court&#x27;s opinion acknowledged other Federal Circuit cases that described a PHOSITA as having &quot;common sense&quot; and who could find motivation &quot;implicitly in the prior art,&quot; Kennedy emphasized that his opinion was directed at correcting the &quot;errors of law made by the Court of Appeals in this case&quot; and does not necessarily overturn all other Federal Circuit precedent.

Once the PHOSITA is properly defined, &quot;KSR v. Teleflex&quot; described how obviousness should be determined:

== Elsewhere ==
Practically all patent legislations disallow the patentability of something obvious. The laws of some countries have similar formulations.

For example, the German Patent Act (&quot;Patentgesetz&quot;) requires that the invention &quot;cannot be derived by a &quot;Fachmann&quot; from the state of the art in an obvious manner&quot;. The word &quot;Fachmann&quot; (an ordinary German word meaning somebody who has professional knowledge in a field) is made specific by &quot;ständiger Rechtsprechung&quot; (usual court opinion) as a &quot;specialist with average knowledge and talent whom one would ordinarily ask to seek a solution for the (objective) problem the invention deals with&quot;

<text>The spring bloom is a strong increase in phytoplankton abundance (i.e. stock) that typically occurs in the early spring and lasts until late spring or early summer. This seasonal event is characteristic of temperate North Atlantic, sub-polar, and coastal waters. Phytoplankton blooms occur when growth exceeds losses, however there is no universally accepted definition of the magnitude of change or the threshold of abundance that constitutes a bloom. The magnitude, spatial extent and duration of a bloom depends on a variety of abiotic and biotic factors. Abiotic factors include light availability, nutrients, temperature, and physical processes that influence light availability, and biotic factors include grazing, viral lysis, and phytoplankton physiology. The factors that lead to bloom initiation are still actively debated (see Critical depth).

==Classical mechanism==
In the spring, more light becomes available and stratification of the water column occurs as increasing temperatures warm the surface waters (referred to as thermal stratification). As a result, vertical mixing is inhibited and phytoplankton and nutrients are entrained in the euphotic zone. This creates a comparatively high nutrient and high light environment that allows rapid phytoplankton growth.

Along with thermal stratification, spring blooms can be triggered by salinity stratification due to freshwater input, from sources such as high river runoff. This type of stratification is normally limited to coastal areas and estuaries, including Chesapeake Bay. Freshwater influences primary productivity in two ways. First, because freshwater is less dense, it rests on top of seawater and creates a stratified water column. Second, freshwater often carries nutrients that phytoplankton need to carry out processes, including photosynthesis.

Rapid increases in phytoplankton growth, that typically occur during the spring bloom, arise because phytoplankton can reproduce rapidly under optimal growth conditions (i.e., high nutrient levels, ideal light and temperature, and minimal losses from grazing and vertical mixing). In terms of reproduction, many species of phytoplankton can double at least once per day, allowing for exponential increases in phytoplankton stock size. For example, the stock size of a population that doubles once per day will increase 1000-fold in just 10 days. In addition, there is a lag in the grazing response of herbivorous zooplankton at the start of blooms, which minimize phytoplankton losses. This lag occurs because there is low winter zooplankton abundance and many zooplankton, such as copepods, have longer generation times than phytoplankton.

Spring blooms typically last until late spring or early summer, at which time the bloom collapses due to nutrient depletion in the stratified water column and increased grazing pressure by zooplankton. The most limiting nutrient in the marine environment is typically nitrogen (N). This is because most organisms are unable to fix atmospheric nitrogen into usable forms (i.e. ammonium, nitrite, or nitrate). However, with the exception of coastal waters, it can be argued, that iron (Fe) is the most limiting nutrient because it is required to fix nitrogen, but is only available in small quantities in the marine environment, coming from dust storms and leaching from rocks. Phosphorus can also be limiting, particularly in freshwater environments and tropical coastal regions.

During winter, wind-driven turbulence and cooling water temperatures break down the stratified water column formed during the summer. This breakdown allows vertical mixing of the water column and replenishes nutrients from deep water to the surface waters and the rest of the euphotic zone. However, vertical mixing also causes high losses, as phytoplankton are carried below the euphotic zone (so their respiration exceeds primary production). In addition, reduced illumination (intensity and daily duration) during winter limits growth rates.

==Alternative mechanisms==
Historically, blooms have been explained by Sverdrup&#x27;s critical depth hypothesis, which says blooms are caused by shoaling of the mixed layer. Similarly, Winder and Cloern (2010) described spring blooms as a response to increasing temperature and light availability. However, new explanations have been offered recently, including that blooms occur due to:
* Coupling between phytoplankton growth and zooplankton grazing.
* The onset of near surface stratification in the spring.
* Mixing of the water column, rather than stratification
* Low turbulence
* Increasing light intensity (in shallow water environments).
* Eddies (see ‘The role of eddies in the onset of the North Atlantic spring bloom’)

==The role of eddies in the onset of the North Atlantic spring bloom==
A 2012 study showed that the onset of the North Atlantic bloom is due to eddies. Eddies, or circular currents of water, are ubiquitous throughout the world’s ocean and play an important role in ocean mixing. In the North Atlantic, surface water is colder and denser farther north and warmer and lighter in the south. This sets up a horizontal density gradient. Earth’s rotation maintains this gradient by preventing the dense water from slipping underneath the light water. Eddies, however, can mix dense water underneath the lighter water, setting up a vertical stratification that limits the depth of vertical mixing (leading to a shallower mixed layer). 

Mechanisms that limit the depth of vertical mixing can be referred to as ‘restratifying mechanisms’ (e.g. eddies, solar heating), which compete against mechanisms that increase vertical mixing (and deepen the mixed layer). This includes convection and down-front winds. Convection is strongest in the winter when surface cooling is strongest. Convection increases the depth of vertical mixing, which can move phytoplankton away from the light they need to grow. 

When convection weakens and wind switches direction in the spring, the re-stratifying effect of eddies becomes dominant. Phytoplankton are trapped closer to the surface, increasing their exposure to light. This spurs phytoplankton growth, leading to the onset of the North Atlantic spring bloom 20-30 days earlier than would occur with thermal stratification alone.

==Northward progression==
At greater latitudes, spring blooms take place later in the year. This northward progression is because spring occurs later, delaying thermal stratification and increases in illumination that promote blooms. A study by Wolf and Woods (1988) showed evidence that spring blooms follow the northward migration of the 12 °C isotherm, suggesting that blooms may be controlled by temperature limitations, in addition to stratification.

At high latitudes, the shorter warm season commonly results in one mid-summer bloom. These blooms tend to be more intense than spring blooms of temperate areas because there is a longer duration of daylight for photosynthesis to take place. Also, grazing pressure tends to be lower because the generally cooler temperatures at higher latitudes slow zooplankton metabolism.

==Species succession==
The spring bloom often consists of a series of sequential blooms of different phytoplankton species. Succession occurs because different species have optimal nutrient uptake at different ambient concentrations and reach their growth peaks at different times. Shifts in the dominant phytoplankton species are likely caused by biological and physical (i.e. environmental) factors. For instance, diatom growth rate becomes limited when the supply of silicate is depleted. Since silicate is not required by other phytoplankton, such as dinoflagellates, their growth rates continue to increase.

For example, in oceanic environments, diatoms (cells diameter greater than 10 to 70 μm or larger) typically dominate first because they are capable of growing faster. Once silicate is depleted in the environment, diatoms are succeeded by smaller dinoflagellates. This scenario has been observed in Rhode Island, as well as Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bay. By the end of a spring bloom, when most nutrients have been depleted, the majority of the total phytoplankton biomass is very small phytoplankton, known as ultraphytoplankton (cell diameter &lt;5 to 10 μm). Ultraphytoplankton can sustain low, but constant stocks, in nutrient depleted environments because they have a larger surface area to volume ratio, which offers a much more effective rate of diffusion. The types of phytoplankton comprising a bloom can be determined by examination of the varying photosynthetic pigments found in chloroplasts of each species.

==Variability and the influence of climate change==
Variability in the patterns (e.g., timing of onset, duration, magnitude, position, and spatial extent) of annual spring bloom events has been well documented. These variations occur due to fluctuations in environmental conditions, such as wind intensity, temperature, freshwater input, and light. Consequently, spring bloom patterns are likely sensitive to global climate change.

Links have been found between temperature and spring bloom patterns. For example, several studies have reported a correlation between earlier spring bloom onset and temperature increases over time. Furthermore, in Long Island Sound and the Gulf of Maine, blooms begin later in the year, are more productive, and last longer during colder years, while years that are warmer exhibit earlier, shorter blooms of greater magnitude.

Temperature may also regulate bloom sizes. In Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, a study by Durbin et al. (1992) indicated that a 2 °C increase in water temperature resulted in a three-week shift in the maturation of the copepod, &quot;Acartia hudsonica&quot;, which could significantly increase zooplankton grazing intensity. Oviatt et al. (2002) noted a reduction in spring bloom intensity and duration in years when winter water temperatures were warmer. Oviatt et al. suggested that the reduction was due to increased grazing pressure, which could potentially become intense enough to prevent spring blooms from occurring altogether.

Miller and Harding (2007) suggested climate change (influencing winter weather patterns and freshwater influxes) was responsible for shifts in spring bloom patterns in the Chesapeake Bay. They found that during warm, wet years (as opposed to cool, dry years), the spatial extent of blooms was larger and was positioned more seaward. Also, during these same years, biomass was higher and peak biomass occurred later in the spring.

<text>Larry David Baldock (born 1954) is a New Zealand politician. Before entering national politics, he was involved with Youth With A Mission and spent 15 years living in the Philippines. After returning to New Zealand in 1996, he joined Future New Zealand in 1999, standing as a candidate in the Tauranga electorate at that year&#x27;s general election. In 2001, he was elected to the Tauranga City Council, and served as a list MP for United Future New Zealand from 2002 to 2005.

==Political career==

===United Future MP===

Baldock was elected to Parliament in the 2002 general election. Along with Murray Smith, Bernie Ogilvy, and Marc Alexander, Baldock failed to make it back to the 48th New Zealand Parliament in 2005, given United Future New Zealand&#x27;s drop in electoral support to one-third the level at the previous general election. Like Smith, Ogilvy and Adams, Baldock is a Christian.

===Anti-smacking referendum===
When the Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Bill, which would remove parental correction as a defence for assault against children, began to raise debate nationally, Baldock began organising a petition to force a referendum on the question, &quot;Should a smack, as part of good parental correction, be a criminal offence in New Zealand?&quot; With his wife Barbara, Baldock travelled all over New Zealand for the next 18 months. With the help of many volunteers and support from organisations like &#x27;Family First&#x27; they collected approximately 310,000 signatures from voters, surpassing the 285,000 signatures, or 10 per cent of total voters, required to force a referendum. When it was held from 31 July to 21 August 2009 voter turnout was 56.1%, with 87.4% of voters answered &#x27;no&#x27;. In June 2009, then Prime Minister John Key said that the government would change the law if it was not working, but that he believed the current law was working well.

===The Kiwi Party===
On 16 May 2007, Baldock and his former colleague Gordon Copeland, then a United Future List MP, announced that they would be forming a new Future New Zealand party after expressing dissatisfaction with party leader Peter Dunne&#x27;s support of the child-discipline bill.

After the announcement that Copeland and Baldock would co-lead the new party, they held an inaugural party meeting in Tauranga, Baldock&#x27;s city of residence, and stated that forty-five former members of the pre-merger Future New Zealand had attended, although the party had between sixteen and twenty members at that time. Former United Future List MP Bernie Ogilvy also joined Future New Zealand, as party secretary.

On 17 July 2007, the Future New Zealand website&#x27;s &quot;Copeland Chronicle&quot; (June 2007) edition announced that the Party had achieved its five hundred member goal required for registration under the New Zealand Electoral Act 1993 as a viable political party. The newsletter also stated that Copeland and Baldock would now work on establishing a Board of Management and Board of Reference for the party.

On 28 January 2008, Future New Zealand was renamed The Kiwi Party. Baldock became sole party leader, while Copeland concentrated primarily on parliamentary matters. Baldock successfully collected 390,000 signatures against the Child Discipline Act, which forced a referendum on the issue. Baldock has proposed giving parents the right to strike their children with implements stating, &quot;I&#x27;m not opposed to the wooden spoon or ruler because you can control things with that better than you can with an open hand.&quot;

In the 2008 general election, Baldock stood for the Tauranga electorate, but came a distant fourth, with approximately five per cent of the vote. The Kiwi Party also performed poorly, receiving 0.54% of the party vote nationwide.

Undaunted by its poor performance, the Kiwi Party held a conference in Christchurch in March 2009, and announced its intention to contest the 2011 general election. As The Family Party and New Zealand Pacific Party had been dissolved, it would have been the only Christian based party in the contest.

===Conservative Party involvement===
It was announced on 14 October 2011 that Kiwi Party members would not be running candidates for the 2011 election, instead standing for the Conservative Party, of which Baldock was ranked at number 3 on the 2011 party list. Baldock also stood for the Conservatives in the Tauranga electorate in 2011 gaining just over 4% of the popular vote 

In April 2013 the Electoral Commission announced it had referred Baldock to the police for filing a false expenses return and for exceeding the $25,000 cap on election expenses. Baldock maintained the error was made by others, and the police did not lay charges.

Larry Baldock declined to stand as the Conservative Party&#x27;s candidate in Tauranga in August 2014 partly because he disagreed with the party&#x27;s policy of abolishing the Maori seats and removing references to the Treaty of Waitangi from legislation and also over concerns about Party leader Colin Craig&#x27;s behaviour and his autocratic decision making.

He was removed from the Conservative Party&#x27;s board before the end of 2014, and had his party membership suspended while he faced disciplinary action. The suspension was not related to his earlier policy disagreement.
The subsequent strange and erratic behaviour of Colin Craig certainly seemed to vindicate Baldock&#x27;s concerns and actions.

===Tauranga City Council===
In October 2010 Baldock was successful in being elected back onto the Tauranga City Council. He was elected to the City Council again in 2016 and re-elected in 2019 and appointed deputy mayor of Tauranga by the newly elected Mayor Tenby Powell. He resigned as deputy mayor on 2 June 2020 after much internal fighting amongst the elected members. Ultimately all were replaced when the Minister of Local Government appointed Commissioners to run the city when Mayor Powell himself also resigned on November 20 later that year.

===2023 general election===
In early September 2023, Baldock announced he would be contesting the Tauranga electorate during the 2023 New Zealand general election as an independent candidate. He received 1039 votes, which was the sixth highest of ten candidates.

<text>Gordon Frank Copeland (19 August 1943 – 24 November 2018) was a New Zealand politician who served as a Member of Parliament from 2002 to 2008. He entered the House of Representatives as a list MP for the United Future New Zealand Party from 2002 but he resigned from the party in 2007. In March 2009, Copeland became Party President of The Kiwi Party, which he had co-founded with another former United Future list MP, Larry Baldock, in May 2007. Copeland stood for the Conservative Party in the 2011 New Zealand general election. Prior to entering Parliament he held a number of corporate positions before working as the financial administrator for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Wellington.

== Early life and family ==
Of English and Irish ancestry, Copeland was born at Mahana, near Māpua, on 19 August 1943. He was married to Anne and they had five children. He graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Victoria University of Wellington and was qualified as a Chartered Accountant.

== Pre-Parliamentary career ==

Prior to entering parliament, Copeland worked for fourteen years in the oil industry, becoming the chief financial officer of BP in New Zealand. Later, he worked as a self-employed business consultant with corporate and government clients. From 1984 to 2002 he served as the Financial Administrator of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Wellington.

Copeland chaired the Inter-Church Working Party on Taxation (1987–2002) and became a member of the Working Party on Registration, Reporting and Monitoring of Charities that led to setting up the New Zealand Charities Commission.

He participated in a wide range of ecumenical activities, and in 2000 convened &quot;Celebrate Jesus 2000&quot;, which saw 28,000 Christians come together at Wellington&#x27;s Westpac Stadium to celebrate the presumed 2000th birthday of Jesus.

== Member of Parliament ==

The United Future party ranked Copeland second on their party list for the 2002 general election and he won election to Parliament with seven other United Future candidates. In the 2005 general election, he was third on the party list and was one of three United Future MPs.

=== Opposition to same-sex marriage ===

Following his 2005 re-election, Copeland gained the support of other social conservatives for his socially conservative political views. In early December 2005, he introduced his colleague Larry Baldock&#x27;s Marriage Amendment (Gender Clarification) Bill, which emulated Australian and US legislation that sought to define marriage in New Zealand as heterosexual. It failed to win support.

=== Opposition to abortion and to voluntary euthanasia ===

Subsequently, Copeland protested against the establishment of a hosted website for Australian euthanasia-activist Philip Nitschke&#x27;s Exit International organisation, and approached the New Zealand Ministers of Immigration and Information Technology, as well as the New Zealand Police, seeking to frustrate Nitschke&#x27;s attempts to resettle in that country.

Copeland wanted to introduce a private member&#x27;s ballot bill designed to require women seeking abortion to undergo mandatory counselling covering both proceeding with the pregnancy and abortion prior to making a decision. This bill, the Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion (Informed Consent) Bill, resembled Australian Capital Territory legislation repealed several years ago. Women do not have to consult optional counselling services under the Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977. As a devout Catholic, Copeland espoused anti-abortion views in debates about reproductive freedom for women, and believed that women did not receive relevant information related to abortion procedures, hence the title to the Bill, which was never drawn from the ballot for private members bills.

=== Opposition to prohibiting parental corporal punishment ===

Copeland criticised Sue Bradford&#x27;s private member&#x27;s Child Discipline Bill (introduced in 2005), an amendment to New Zealand&#x27;s Crimes Act 1961 which removed the legal defence of &quot;reasonable force&quot; for parents prosecuted for assault on their children, and had previously obtained a Queen&#x27;s Counsel opinion confirming that legal position. Sue Bradford said that the fact that Copeland did not disclose that his Queen&#x27;s Counsel, Peter McKenzie, had previously represented Christian organisations like Right to Life New Zealand and the Society for Promotion of Community Standards undermined the opinion.

=== Resignation from United Future ===

On 16 May 2007, Copeland resigned from the United Future party after its leader, Peter Dunne, had consistently voted for Bradford&#x27;s Child Discipline Bill, which removed the defence of &quot;reasonable force&quot; related to parental corporal punishment of children. Copeland has since said that after the 2005 elections, which saw the United Future caucus reduce from eight to three, Dunne had wanted to return to his liberal roots and to see an end to the Christian influence in the party. Dunne also told Copeland that he regretted having voted against the legalisation of prostitution and the Civil Unions Act. In a televised interview on 3 July 2007, Dunne said that Copeland&#x27;s decision to quit came after a failed leadership bid in January 2007. This is strongly denied by Copeland who says that he had never thought of, let alone made, such a bid.

After resigning, Copeland missed the vote against the Bill that he had quit his party over, when the debate ended well ahead of its scheduled two hours. He had his vote against the Bill recorded retrospectively by leave of the House. As an independent MP, Copeland gave a proxy vote to the Opposition National Party to cast on his behalf while absent from the House, for any matters apart from confidence and supply.

=== Future New Zealand Party / The Kiwi Party ===
Copeland announced that he would form a separate Future New Zealand party with ex-United Future List MP Larry Baldock. According to Copeland, Future New Zealand already had 16 to 20 members, and Baldock said that 45 former Future New Zealand party members had attended an inaugural meeting in Tauranga. Former United Future list MP Bernie Ogilvy became the party secretary of Future New Zealand, according to the website. In June 2007, Copeland announced in his monthly &quot;Copeland&#x27;s Chronicle&quot; newsletter that Future New Zealand had attracted the necessary 500 members required for registration under the Electoral Act 1993. Baldock and Copeland were working on establishing a board of management and board of reference for their new party, still tentatively named &quot;Future New Zealand&quot;. Copeland also asserted his right to continue sitting in New Zealand&#x27;s Parliament as a list MP.

On 17 September 2007, Copeland publicly confirmed an intention to co-lead a new political party with Richard Lewis, after Bishop Brian Tamaki, founder of the Destiny New Zealand party, had announced it at a press conference without Copeland&#x27;s knowledge. However, that announcement, coupled with Tamaki&#x27;s statements that the Destiny New Zealand party would de-register and that he would not rule out a candidacy in the 2008 elections, gave the media the impression that the new party, which had no name, would be just a re-formed Destiny Party. Rank-and-file members of Future New Zealand immediately reacted negatively to that perception, so Copeland announced on 20 September 2007 that he &quot;could not work&quot; with Lewis, and would remain co-leader of Future New Zealand with Baldock.
In October 2007 Copeland distanced himself from The Family Party, led by Lewis, which formed out of Destiny New Zealand, and said he would contest the 2008 election under the Future New Zealand banner.

On 28 January 2008, Future New Zealand changed its name to The Kiwi Party and Copeland relinquished his joint leadership to Larry Baldock, announcing that he would henceforth concentrate on parliamentary matters. In the 2008 general election Copeland stood for The Kiwi Party in the Rongotai electorate.
He fared poorly, receiving only 515 electorate votes, and the Kiwi Party did not cross the 5% threshold to enter Parliament.

== Post-Parliamentary career ==
In March 2009, the Kiwi Party elected Copeland as their president. In the 2011 general election Kiwi Party members stood for the Conservative Party of New Zealand, with Copeland unsuccessfully contesting the Hutt South electorate.

The New Zealand Electoral Commission de-registered the Kiwi Party in February 2012.

In November 2012 Copeland made headlines when he compared same-sex marriage to apartheid.

In August 2014 the Conservative Party listed Copeland as its candidate in the Hutt South electorate for the 2014 general election.

Copeland died in a Wellington hospice on 24 November 2018.

== Political views ==

=== Social policy ===

As a Member of Parliament Copeland said he wanted to give a central focus to the role and importance of the family in building a strong nation. To that end he was a strong advocate for marriage preparation and marriage enrichment programmes and parenting programmes, at every level from pre-natal through to the teenage years.

Copeland wanted
to develop policy giving greater encouragement to charities and not-for-profit organisations; and a taxation-system minimising distortions, ensuring that — through a mix of private savings and government support — New Zealanders had adequate retirement incomes.

Copeland introduced bills adding private-property rights to the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act and removing GST from rates. Both were defeated. He advocated for lower taxes for both individuals and companies.

<doc id="1038856" wikidata="Q771456" url="?curid=1038856" title="Chikuwa">
<text>is a Japanese fishcake product made from fish surimi. After being mixed well, they are wrapped around a bamboo or metal stick and steamed or broiled. The word chikuwa (&quot;bamboo ring&quot;) comes from the shape when it is sliced.

Variants of surimi products such as kamaboko and satsuma age are popular. In Tottori, the per-household consumption has been the highest of all prefectures for the past 30 years, since the first year such records were kept. As it is cheap and a relatively low-fat source of protein, chikuwa is popular as a snack.

Chikuwa should not be confused with &quot;chikuwabu&quot;, which is an altogether different food product.

==Composition==
&quot;Chikuwa&quot; is made of surimi, or ground white fish. Some species used include:

* Alaska pollock (&quot;Theragra chalcogramma&quot;)
* Various shark species (&quot;Selachimorpha&quot;)
* Various flying fish species (&quot;Exocoetidae&quot;)
* Okhotsk atka mackerel (&quot;Pleurogrammus azonus&quot;)
* Golden threadfin bream (&quot;Nemipterus virgatus&quot;)
* Black bass
** Smallmouth bass (&quot;Micropterus dolomieu&quot;)
** Largemouth bass (&quot;Micropterus salmoides&quot;)
** Florida black bass (&quot;Micropterus floridanus&quot;)

==Use==
Chikuwa can be eaten as-is. It is also often used as an ingredient for nimono like oden, chikuzenni, chirashizushi, udon, yakisoba, yasai-itame (Vegetable stir fry), and Japanese curry.

==Regional variation==

There are several regional varieties. In the east part of Tottori and part of Nagasaki, &quot;tofu chikuwa&quot; is produced that adds tofu to surimi. Often, firm tofu is the preferred selection.

In Yawatahama, Ehime, &quot;kawa-chikuwa&quot; (literally skin chikuwa) is produced: fish skin is wrapped around the skewers and broiled. This is a by-product of regular chikuwa, however, texture and taste are different.
In Shikokuchūō, Ehime, there is &quot;ebi-chikuwa&quot;, which contains shrimp paste in surimi.

In Komatsushima, Tokushima, there is &quot;take chikuwa&quot; (literally bamboo chikuwa), which remains on the bamboo after it is broiled.

Australian sushi restaurants may stuff the hollow with cheese (processed or soft ones like Brie) and deep-fry them in tempura batter.

<text>Bernard James Ogilvy is a New Zealand educator and politician. He was a list member of Parliament (MP) for the United Future New Zealand party from 2002 to 2005. He left United Future with the breakaway Kiwi Party in 2007.

==Early years==
Before entering national politics, Ogilvy lectured at Auckland&#x27;s Masters Institute, a fundamentalist Christian teachers college, as well as being involved with Youth With A Mission.

==Member of Parliament==

He was elected to the New Zealand Parliament as a list MP for the United Future party in the 2002 general election. Controversy arose when the media reported that he had been using the title &quot;Doctor&quot; on the basis of an honorary degree awarded by a Californian theological school for his volunteer work at the 1984 Olympic Games. Like his colleagues, Murray Smith, Paul Adams and Larry Baldock, Ogilvy was an evangelical or fundamentalist Christian. Like the above, and Marc Alexander, he lost his seat at the 2005 general election when the party&#x27;s electoral support fell to one third its previous level.

==Later years==
Ogilvy reappeared as secretary of the new Kiwi Party in 2007, after Gordon Copeland seceded from United Future over Peter Dunne&#x27;s support for Sue Bradford&#x27;s child discipline bill, which sought to outlaw most forms of parental corporal punishment of children in New Zealand. Ogilvy made the application to register the Kiwi Party with the Electoral Commission.

<text>Murray Smith is a former New Zealand politician. He was a member of the United Future New Zealand party caucus, having been elected to Parliament as a list MP in the 2002 election.

==Political career==

Before entering national politics, Smith was a lawyer.

He was a founding member of the Christian Democrats, which later became Future New Zealand. Future New Zealand then joined with United New Zealand to form the modern United Future New Zealand.

For the , the Christian Democrats formed a coalition with Christian Heritage New Zealand, and he was ranked 13th on the party list of the resulting Christian Coalition, but he did not contest an electorate.

Like his associates, Larry Baldock, Bernie Ogilvy, Paul Adams and Marc Alexander, Smith only served one term before he left Parliament at the 2005 New Zealand general election, given that his party polled only one-third of its previous electoral support.

In the 2008 election, Smith stood for United Future in the electorate of Hutt South.

<text>Judith Anne Turner (born 2 August 1956) is a New Zealand politician who was the deputy leader of United Future New Zealand. She was a member of the New Zealand House of Representatives as a list MP from 2002 to 2008, and the mayor of Whakatāne from 2019 to 2022.

== Member of Parliament ==


Turner was first elected as a United Future list MP at the 2002 election.

In December 2004 United Future party members chose her as their deputy leader. In September 2005, Turner and Gordon Copeland became the only two United Future List MPs re-elected alongside Peter Dunne (who won an electorate seat). Although Copeland left the party in 2007, Turner indicated that she would remain within the United Future caucus.

In the 2008 election, Turner stood as a United Future candidate for the East Coast electorate. However, she failed to win the electorate, and United Future did not poll sufficiently well for a second list MP during the 2008 New Zealand general election. As a consequence, Turner did not return to Parliament.

In June 2009, Turner stood as an electorate candidate for United Future in Auckland&#x27;s Mount Albert, polling eighth at 89 votes. She was outpolled by the Bill and Ben Party co-leader Ben Boyce (158 votes), as well as the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party&#x27;s Dakta Green (92 votes) and The Kiwi Party&#x27;s Simmone Dyer (91 votes).

<doc id="1038861" wikidata="Q318311" url="?curid=1038861" title="Tankard (band)">
<text>Tankard is a German thrash metal band from Frankfurt, founded in 1982. Alongside Kreator, Destruction and Sodom, Tankard is often considered one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; of Teutonic thrash metal. Stylistically, Tankard have consistently played thrash metal that thematically centres primarily on alcohol reverence, unlike the remaining &quot;Big Teutonic Four&quot; (Kreator, Destruction and Sodom), who are all known for covering such topics related to death, politics, violence and anti-fascism.

== History ==
=== Formation and early years (1982–1985) ===
Tankard was formed in 1982 by three classmates, bassist Andreas &quot;Gerre&quot; Geremia, guitarist Axel Katzmann and vocalist Frank Thorwarth. Thorwarth and Gerre soon switched roles; at the same time the trio added drummer Oliver Werner and second guitarist Bernhard Rapprich. They chose their name from a dictionary upon seeing its definition as &quot;beer mug&quot;. Their earliest written song was called &quot;Ray Death&quot;, a song about nuclear war and their first gig was played in a local classroom in 1983. As drinking alcohol in the school was banned, they smuggled their beer in with milk cartons. Soon after, Bernhard Rapprich left the band as his conservative father did not want him &quot;hanging around with a bunch of drunks&quot; and he was replaced by Andy Bulgaropoulos.

With the lineup now stabilised, the band released their first demo, titled &quot;Heavy Metal Vanguard&quot;, in 1984. After this, the band toured with fellow German thrashers Sodom. SPV were interested in signing both bands, but allegedly SPV retracted a deal after seeing the band perform live. In 1985, they released a second demo, &quot;Alcoholic Metal&quot;, which cemented their thrash metal style and lyrical themes. Both of these demos were very popular in the underground, and on the strength of this demo they signed with Noise Records. The eight-track demo also features rough versions of four songs that would later appear on their debut album, &quot;Zombie Attack&quot;.

=== The Noise years (1986–1995) ===
&quot;Zombie Attack&quot; was released in July 1986. In October 1987 their sophomore album, &quot;Chemical Invasion&quot;, was released, with the album art being the first of eight done for the band by artist Sebastian Krüger, followed a year later by &quot;The Morning After&quot;. Both of these albums were produced by Harris Johns, who would go on to produce all of the band&#x27;s albums up to 2000. However, shortly after the release of compilation &quot;Hair of the Dog&quot;, original drummer Oliver Werner quit the band to be replaced by Arnulf Tunn, and the band released three albums with this lineup: &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;, &quot;Stone Cold Sober&quot; and &quot;Two-Faced&quot;. They also recorded the live album &quot;Fat, Ugly and Live&quot; during this time. This lineup then folded when Tunn was replaced by Olaf Zissel, who remains in the band to this day, in May 1994 and the next year founding member Katzmann was forced to leave due to osteoarthritis in the wrist. That year the band released &quot;The Tankard&quot;, which is widely viewed as a very good album by fans and critics alike, and is their final album with Noise.

=== Later career (1995–present) ===
The band decided not to replace Katzmann and remain a one guitar band. Also, after the release of &quot;The Tankard&quot;, the band signed with Century Media Records. After the release of &quot;Disco Destroyer&quot;, longtime guitarist Andy Bulgaropoulos left the band to spend more time with his family. He was replaced by Andreas Gutjahr, forming the current lineup of the band. The first album released with Gutjahr was &quot;Kings of Beer&quot;, which was their second and final studio album with Century Media. The band signed with AFM Records and release five studio albums in a decade with the label, starting with &quot;B-Day&quot; and ending with &quot;Vol(l)ume 14&quot;. On 27 July 2012, the band announced their signing with Nuclear Blast and released their first album with the label, &quot;A Girl Called Cerveza&quot;, that day. Also that year, they released a four-way split with Sodom, Kreator and Destruction called &quot;The Big Teutonic 4&quot;. This release cemented them as a major force in German metal. They released another studio album, &quot;R.I.B.&quot; on 20 June 2014.

In 2015, Olaf Zissel was hospitalised with what was suspected to be a stroke. He was replaced temporarily by Gerd Lücking of Holy Moses. Their latest album achieved no. 41 on the German charts. While they have built a fan base, they continue to have day jobs.

Tankard&#x27;s 17th studio album &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;, was released on 2 June 2017. The band released its 18th studio album, &quot;Pavlov&#x27;s Dawgs&quot;, on 30 September 2022. A music video was made for the song Lockdown Forever directed by Renatus Töpke.

On 20 June 2024, drummer Olaf Zissel had departed the band and was replaced by Gerd Lücking. As part of the &quot;Big Teutonic&quot; four series, Tankard performed together with Kreator, Sodom and Destruction for the first time on July 20, 2024 at the Klash of the Ruhrpott festival, which took place at Amphitheater Gelsenkirchen in Gelsenkirchen, Germany.

<text>James Ross Finnie (born 11 February 1947) is a Scottish Liberal Democrat politician and a former Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP). He is a former Minister for the Environment and Rural Development in the Scottish Executive, and Member of the Scottish Parliament for the West of Scotland region. He became an MSP in the first elections to the Scottish Parliament in 1999, and held the same ministerial portfolio until May 2007.

==Background==

Finnie was educated at Greenock Academy. Previously a self-employed chartered accountant and financial adviser, he was a councillor in Inverclyde from 1977 to 1999. He also previously chaired the Scottish Liberal Party, before chairing the Scottish Liberal Democrats. In the 1979 general election he was the Liberal candidate in Renfrewshire West, and four years later he contested Stirling.

==Member of the Scottish Parliament==

He stood for election to the Scottish Parliament at the first elections in 1999. He came second in the Greenock and Inverclyde constituency, but was elected as an additional member for the West of Scotland region. He was re-elected to the Scottish Parliament in 2003 and 2007.

Following the 1999 election, the Scottish Liberal Democrats entered into a coalition agreement with the Scottish Labour Party, gaining two seats in the Scottish Cabinet. Finnie was appointed Minister for Rural Development in the first Scottish cabinet by then First Minister, Donald Dewar Finnie retained his position in the Cabinet since 1999 until the Labour-Liberal Democrat government lost power in 2007, making him the longest-serving member of the Scottish cabinet, other than Jack McConnell who was First Minister.

One of the main events in Finnie&#x27;s time as Minister for Environment and Rural Affairs was the outbreak of foot and mouth in the UK during 2001. Scotland was praised for its response and handling of the crisis.

In January 2004, Finnie took a three-month absence from office to undergo heart bypass surgery and returned in April, after deputy minister Allan Wilson had fulfilled Finnie&#x27;s ministerial duties.

Finnie was unsuccessful in his bid to be re-elected in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, losing his seat after 12 years.

==Leadership contest==
On 7 July 2008, Ross Finnie announced his intention to stand in the election for leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, following the resignation of Nicol Stephen MSP. On 26 August 2008, he was defeated by Tavish Scott.

==Controversies==
In September 2002, Finnie apologised to Digby Jones, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, after branding him an &quot;English prat&quot; at a dinner following a controversial speech by Mr Jones.

Later that month, Finnie apologised for giving wrong information to the Scottish Parliament during a debate. He had told Parliament that sheep were no longer grazing on the banks of Loch Katrine, which provides Glasgow with its drinking water (a previous outbreak of the cryptosporidium bug in the Loch was believed to have been caused by livestock grazing at the Loch&#x27;s shores). However, Scottish Water later contacted him to say that the sheep were still there and would not be removed until September 2007. Both the SNP and the Scottish Conservatives made calls for Finnie to be sacked, although the First Minister, Jack McConnell gave him his support.

In June 2006, Finnie cancelled a tender for a new fishery protection vessel for the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency. The tender has been provisionally awarded to English firm Appledore, but Finnie claimed there was a &quot;fatal flaw&quot; in the tendering process which could have left the Executive liable for damages if the tender had proceeded. However, the &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot; reported that a rival bidder, Port Glasgow based Ferguson&#x27;s was both in Finnie&#x27;s constituency, and that he was a lifelong friend of the chief executive.

==Water Industry Commission for Scotland==
In December 2011, it was announced that he would become a non-executive member of the Water Industry Commission for Scotland, taking up the position in July 2012.

==Food Standards Scotland==
In November 2014, his appointment as the chair of Food Standards Scotland was announced.

<doc id="1038873" wikidata="Q254262" url="?curid=1038873" title="Vehicle registration plates of Germany">
<text>Vehicle registration plates ( or, more colloquially, ) are mandatory alphanumeric plates used to display the &quot;registration mark&quot; of a vehicle registered in Germany. They have existed in the country since 1906, with the current system in use since 1956. German registration plates are alphanumeric plates in a standardised format, issued officially by the district authorities.

All motorised vehicles participating in road traffic on public space, whether moving or stationary, have to bear the plates allotted to them, displayed at the appropriate spaces at the front and rear. Additionally, the official seals on the plates show their validity which can also be proven by the documentation coming with them. Motorcycles and trailers carry only a rear plate.

A significant feature of German vehicle registration plates is the area code, which can be used to tell the district of registration. It has developed into a widespread habit in Germany, even a children&#x27;s game when travelling, to guess &quot;where that vehicle is from&quot;.

==Format and legal requirements==



=== Legal ===
The legal requirements for these licence plates are laid down in a federal law titled (Ordinance on the admission of vehicles for road traffic), or in the shortened version which replaced part of an older law named in 2011. The law distinguishes between meaning a specific combination of letters and digits, and which are the physical licence plates. In everyday language, these terms are often replaced indifferently by and rarely is the difference emphasized by restricted use of either or .

=== Physical characteristics ===
German number plates are rectangular, with standard dimensions for cars, trucks, buses and their trailers. Plates bearing few characters may have reduced length but must retain the size and shape of the characters. Plates in two lines for the said types of vehicles measure . Motorcycles also have plates in two lines but with specific dimensions: Plates for &quot;large motorcycles&quot; (engine displacement over 125 cc or power output exceeding ) issued until 2011 combine a size of with characters of the same size as used for car plates, while those issued since 2011 have characters of reduced size and measure either or . Plates for &quot;light motorcycles&quot; (&quot;Leichtkrafträder&quot; up to 125 cc and ) combine a size of with characters of reduced size. This smallest size of plates is also used for agricultural tractors with a maximum speed of and their trailers and may also be issued as an exception for certain import cars, when a plate of regular size cannot be applied at the available space.

The characters on the licence plate, as well as the narrow rim framing it, are black on a white background. In standard size they are high, and wide for letters or wide for digits. The smaller plates bear characters of height and width, respectively. In the current system, introduced in 1956, they consist of an area code of one, two or three letters, followed by an identifier sequence of one or two letters and one to four digits. The total quantity of characters on the plate must not exceed eight. Identifiers consisting of one letter with one- or two-digit numbers are often reserved for motorcycle use since there is less space for plates on these vehicles, especially before the reduction of plate size to 180 × 200 mm and 220 × 200 mm in 2011.

==== Typeface ====
Modern German plates use a typeface called FE-Schrift (, tamper-hindering script). It is designed so that the letter &quot;P&quot; cannot be altered to look exactly like an &quot;R&quot;, and vice versa; nor can the &quot;F&quot; or the &quot;L&quot; be forged to equal an &quot;E&quot;, etc. Another feature is the equal width of all characters, different from the old DIN 1451 script which had been in use since the introduction of the current system in 1956. FE-Schrift can be read by OCR software for automatic number plate recognition more easily than DIN 1451.

The present style was introduced in 1994 and became mandatory in 2000, so the number of licence plates issued in the old style has become very rare. As with many plates for countries within the European Union, a blue strip on the left shows a shortened country code in white text (D for = Germany) and the Flag of Europe (12 golden stars forming a circle on a blue background).

==== Material ====
Traditionally, German licence plates are made of aluminium sheeting, with embossed characters rising above background level. Over the years, however, various other materials have been used, albeit to a small extent only. Since 2013, a new style of plates made of plastic is allowed. They are said to be less sensitive to mechanical damage and to cause less CO2 emission in their production, but are more expensive.

Number plates are retroflective, but must not be mirroring, concealed or soiled, nor may they be covered by glass, foil or similar layers. Occasionally, drivers who adorn their licence plate with a badge of their favourite football club are fined and ordered to restore the original state.

==Constituent elements==
===Area code===
The first part or consists of one, two or three letters representing the district where the car was registered, such as B for Berlin or HSK for Hochsauerlandkreis. These letters basically refer to the German districts, yet after some changes in the law they are no longer unambiguous. When the current system was introduced, each district was assigned exactly one abbreviation. Whenever a district was merged with another or changed its name, their area code would be redefined. Whereas existing registrations would remain valid, any vehicle registered henceforth could only be issued the current code. In some cases an urban district and the surrounding non-urban district share the same letter code. Usually, these are distinguished by different letter/digit patterns. For example, the urban district of Straubing has one letter after the area code (SR-A 123), whereas the surrounding district Straubing-Bogen has two letters (SR-AB 123) in this place. The assignation of each code and combination is registered with the (ZFZR).

Since 2013, however, area codes long abolished were re-introduced, revoking the rule of unambiguity. In consequence, many districts now use more than one code, and certain codes, on the other hand, are not assigned to one district only. Likewise, several cities that share their code with the surrounding rural districts have started using any available codes for both districts without any distinction; the city of Regensburg, for example, and the surrounding rural district of Regensburg used different systems with their code R only until 2007.

Germany includes diacritical marks in the letters of some codes, that is the letters Ä, Ö, and Ü, but not ẞ. For a long time, German codes kept to the rule that a code with an umlaut would prohibit another code with the respective blank vowel, e.g. there could not be a district code FU as the code FÜ was already in use for Fürth. This rule was disregarded in 1996, when BÖ was introduced for Bördekreis in spite of BO existing for Bochum, although Bördekreis got BK in 2007 since there were confusions internationally for e.g. fines.

There is a principle that two vehicles can&#x27;t share the same letter-number combination, even if disregarding the dash (shown as blank on plates). So if a car has SR-A 123, no car can have S-RA 123. Otherwise this would violate the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic annex 2 which says that letters and numerals are used for registration numbers, but not that spaces or dashes are significant.

====Development of the area code====
When the area codes were introduced, they were intended mainly as a means for police officers to identify speeders and other traffic offenders. However, they soon developed into everyday abbreviations of people&#x27;s home areas and were cherished or despised. Sometimes, the codes of neighbouring districts were given mocking or spiteful meanings. When districts merged and only one of their codes could be continued, fierce battles might ensue about which one.

====The Büsingen exclave====
Since 1968, a peculiar rule has applied to the municipality of which is a German exclave completely surrounded by Swiss territory. Although Büsingen belongs to the German district of Konstanz, it is part of the Swiss customs area. For this reason, a vehicle registered to a citizen of Büsingen does not bear KN for Konstanz but BÜS, signifying to Swiss customs officers that this is in fact a domestic vehicle. There are about 700 cars with this area code, which makes Büsingen the smallest and least-populated registration precinct in Germany.

====List of area codes====
===Stickers===
Registration plates become valid with the official seal of registration. This is a sticker of diameter, following the area code and bearing, in colours, the seal of the respective German with the name of the state and the issuing district authority added in print. Older stickers were monochrome, black on silver or white, and smaller (), depicting the seal of either the Bundesland or the city district. Vehicles used by federal institutions, such as , carry the German instead of a seal.

The rear plate bears, above the official seal, the vehicle safety test sticker. This test is obligatory three years after the first registration, and every two years after that. (This time scheme applies to most vehicles, but differs for trucks, taxis, etc.) The expiration date can be seen at one glance, as the sticker is attached with the month of expiration pointing upwards. The black mark framing the sectors on either side of &quot;12&quot; thus makes it easy for the police to read the expiration month from a distance. Like the hand on a clock, the marking shows the position of a number on the face of a clock. The year when the next safety test is due is printed in the centre of the sticker and also indicated by the colour of the sticker which is repeated every six years.

Whereas the technical inspection was introduced in 1951, it was not before 1961 that a decal on the rear plate indicated when it was due. The inspection generally had to be performed every two years, only later brand new cars were granted an extra year before their first technical inspection. Consequently, there were not so many different colours needed, and the pattern was different then.

Between 1985 and 2010, a similar yet hexagonal sticker was applied to the front plate, certifying the emission test which had to be performed separately since March 1985. With a change of laws effective in 2010, the emission test was incorporated into the safety test, so the emission sticker became obsolete.



All these stickers are specially treated to be easily transferred onto the licence plates, but hard to be removed without damaging the plate itself, making them relatively counterfeit-proof.

The only licence plates which do not need to carry either seal are repeaters. These are obligatory when the original rear plate is covered, in part or whole, by cargo or attached parts, such as bicycle carriers.

===Serial letters and digits===
The final identifier or of the licence plate consists of one or two letters, followed by a number of up to four digits. Thus, basically any combination from A1 to ZZ9999 is possible, yet restricted by the maximum length of eight characters, including the area code. All 26 letters of the Latin alphabet may be used, yet this was not always so. In order to avoid confusion between B and 8, F and E, G and 6, I and 1, O and Q and 0, those six letters were excluded from the middle part of registration plates. In 1992, the letters B, F and G were permitted, and in 2000 the alphabet was completed as I, O and Q have been allowed. In the very first months of the numbering system, between July and November 1956, the letter I was used but J was not. This was soon reversed, but single vintage cars kept sporting their letter I between 1956 and 2000 when it was re-introduced.
In the style used until 1994, a hyphen following the area code was used to separate the two groups of letters. This no longer appears in the new format but is often retained, as the space between the geographic identifier and serial letters is a significant character and must be considered when writing down or transmitting a number. For example, F ST 683 is different from FS T 683. The risk of confusion can be avoided by writing a hyphen after the city code, like F-ST 683. For this reason, the police will usually radio the location name and spell out the next letters, using the German spelling alphabet. Thus, F ST 683 would be radioed as and FS T 683 as . If the officer should not know the meaning of the area code, he would spell it out too, such as , etc.

While the number is issued by each district authority separately, a probable split between two or more districts sharing the same area code has to be considered. Further restrictions are caused by &quot;prohibited&quot; combinations (see below). There has to exist a method to avoid two vehicles getting plate numbers only distinguished by the position of the blank space, because the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic describes some rules about international road traffic, and it does not define blank or hyphen as a significant character on plates.

====Personalised plates====

For an extra charge of €10.20, vehicle owners can register a personalised identifier, keeping to the above rules. In most cases of personalised plates, owners choose their initials and a number reflecting their date of birth. In this fashion, fictional Mrs , born 2 May 1965 and living in Essen, might choose &quot;E-UM 2565&quot; for her car. By combining area code and random letters, further possibilities arise, such as a man from Oldenburg named Olaf, born on Christmas Eve, could choose &quot;OL-AF 2412&quot;. A resident of the town of Pirna might choose &quot;PIR-AT 77&quot;, meaning &quot;pirate&quot; in German. Kiel is one of few places where the number plate can spell out all of the city name.

These vanity plates can only be made up of the available prefixes and numbers, within the general rules. A James Bond fan from Hamburg would not be allowed the plate &quot;HH-JB 007&quot; because leading digits 0 (or even double-0) are not possible; however, he might strive for HH-J 8007 or HH-OO 7, imitating digits by letters or vice versa. The owner of a Volkswagen Polo can certainly show &quot;VW&quot; in the middle section, but neither &quot;PO-LO 1995&quot; nor &quot;VW-P0 L01&quot; would be possible, as these prefixes are not issued nor may letters and digits be mixed at will. Nonetheless, a notable variety of personalised number plates can be spotted on German roads.
====Company cars====
Whereas private persons are required to register their vehicle with the district authority of their residence, commercial enterprises can choose to establish branch offices from where to register at will – either for financial reasons, as insurance fees are dependent on the address of registration, or to obtain an interesting licence plate. On the other hand, other enterprises show their origin proudly nationwide. One of these is ADAC, the German automobile association, based in Munich. All their assistance cars, operating from the Alps to the North Sea, bear an M plate.

Deutsche Bahn, after being privatised and relinquishing their (authority plate) DB, prefers this logo as their middle letters, e. g. F-DB for the Frankfurt office.
Deutsche Telekom, the largest telecommuncations company, often uses BN plates, as their headquarters remained in Bonn, where the company originated out of a governmental post &amp; telephone agency. Yet wherever the respective branch office may be, the middle letters DT are preferred.

The Kone company registers their German vehicles in Koblenz, with middle letters NE, thus displaying their trademark on their plates. BMW, owner of Mini, registers all Mini press/marketing cars in the district of Minden-Lübbecke which holds the code MI, to get &quot;MI-NI&quot; number plates for the cars. BMW itself is based in Munich, yet &quot;M-INI&quot; plates are not possible to issue, as three letters after the district code are not permitted.

From 1970s up to 1994, Essen city buses owned by city transport company EVAG (Essener Verkehrs-AG) were registered with &quot;E-AT&quot; number plates. This may be regarded a pun, as &quot;eat&quot; translates into German as .

===Prohibited combinations===
Combinations that are regarded as a , which means &quot;offence to moral and customs&quot;, are disallowed or otherwise avoided. This refers mostly to abbreviations relating to Nazi Germany, such as &quot;NS&quot; (National Socialism), &quot;KZ&quot; (, concentration camp), &quot;HJ&quot; (, Hitler Youth), &quot;SS&quot; (Schutzstaffel) and &quot;SA&quot; (Sturmabteilung). Therefore, these two-letter combinations are generally not issued in any district, nor do the city districts of Nuremberg, Cologne and Stuttgart issue one-letter plates which would result in the combinations N-S, K-Z, S-A, S-D and S-S.

Those prefixes which will not be issued as middle letters were also excluded from the list of possible area codes with the introduction of the current system, although between 1945 and 1949 the French occupation force had used the combination SA followed by the double-digit numbers 01 to 08 for the then seven rural districts in the Saar Protectorate and its capital Saarbrücken. Nor were these codes later taken into consideration for newly formed districts in former GDR: The district used the name of its capital, Pirna, in its code PIR, to avoid the use of &quot;SS&quot;. When the districts of Torgau, Delitzsch and Oschatz merged into , they combined their initials into TDO, instead of abbreviating &quot;Northern Saxony&quot; as &quot;NS&quot;.
On the other hand, the area codes HH and AH were chosen for and former district , although they could be interpreted as and , respectively. In everyday German, the letters AH are not regarded as an obvious abbreviation for that name, even less so in the 1950s when the lists were created. Nonetheless, these two-letter codes and the respective numerals 18 and 88, signifying the first and eighth letter of the alphabet, obviously have developed into Nazi symbols. They are therefore generally avoided in the serial part of licence plates, although they may be found sometimes. Generally, the decision whether or not a certain combination is permitted lies with the respective district authority. In Brandenburg, any plates that are related to Hitler, the Hitler salute, etc. cannot be issued, especially if they would be bearing digits 1888, 8818, 8888 or ending in 88, 888, 188. Nor can the combinations AH 18 and HH 18 be issued to new owners. Some districts however allow these combinations if they are the owner&#x27;s initials (for example, might be able to get XX-NS 1234).

In 2004 in Nuremberg, a car owner was refused a number plate beginning &quot;N-PD&quot; because of the connection to the political party NPD. After the terror group National Socialist Underground was uncovered in 2011, the city of Nuremberg refused number plates beginning with &quot;N-SU&quot; and even abolished the respective plates on their own vehicles of (sewage and environmental department).
In the 2010s, some districts started banning licence plates with the middle letters IS which resembled the Islamic State. The Herford district registration office ceased issuing registration plates with the combination HF-Z in April 2022 to avoid connotations with the use of the letter &quot;Z&quot; as a symbol for the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The combinations STA-SI, S-ED/SE-D, HEI-L, IZ-AN and WAF-FE are also forbidden or discouraged, to avoid association with Stasi, the of the GDR, the Nazi salute, NAZI backwards and the German word for weapon respectively. Other combinations affected are BUL-LE (German derogative for police, roughly comparable to &quot;pig&quot;), MO-RD (German for murder) and SU-FF (boozing).
On the other hand, plates that would seem offensive in other circumstances have been allowed, such as the infamous acronym AC-AB. Since the 1950s, morals and customs have certainly changed, and combinations which may have appeared indecent then do not raise an eyebrow now. Therefore, it is not a problem to get a licence plate with S-EX, SE-X or SE-XY, for example.

===Reserved combinations===

For quite different reasons, some districts hold certain letter combinations reserved. The Saxon capital Dresden issues all DD-Q plates to the state police vehicles. Likewise, Erfurt uses EF-LP for the police in Thuringia. Munich and other Bavarian cities reserve certain combinations with &quot;P&quot; for the police units within their authorities, such as M-PM, N-PP or RO-P. Cologne issues K-TX to taxis and K-LN to the city&#x27;s own vehicles. In various districts, firefighter vehicles will be issued the middle letters FW standing for .

===Bogus licence plates===

Sometimes, e.g. in movie films, it may be necessary to show licence plates which do not really belong to any vehicle. The easiest way would be to create a fictional area code, such as &quot;NN-XY 555&quot;. In the 1980s TV series , the area code G was used for a fictional &quot;large city&quot; () in the Ruhrgebiet area. However, if the plot is supposed to take place in a defined town or region, the audience would expect cars to show codes of that area on their number plates. When James Bond was driving through Hamburg in &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, the obviously fake Berlin licence plates on his BMW were soon pointed out.

In the time before 2000, it had also been possible to use number plates with bogus identifiers containing the letters B, F, G, I, O and Q, which at that time were not issued in the middle group. Meanwhile, however, all these letters can appear on a real licence plate. In order to state clearly that the plate shown is a fictive one, the crew could use an impossible identifier, such as an in this middle section. Yet another way would be to have a valid registration issued (or at least reserved) by the district authority.

==Registration==
===Procedures===

Vehicles must be registered with their owner&#x27;s name and current address. On proof of identity, vehicle documentation and liability insurance, the registration will take place in the district authority competent for the respective address. An alphanumeric combination, which can be reserved according to personal wishes, will be issued to the vehicle. The physical plates, however, have to be acquired separately, either at a local store or online. Both the dimensions of the plates and the typeface of letters and numbers are standardized. After purchasing the number plate, the official stamps must be applied, back at the registration office. A fee is payable for the registration, in addition to the expenses for the plates.

Any registration or change of it will be registered both within the district authority and nationwide. The latter task is carried out by the Central Vehicle Register (, ZFZR) which is controlled by the Federal Motor Transport Authority (, KBA). The data which are stored there refer to the vehicle, the owner and the insurance. Inquiries from foreign authorities can be addressed to ZFZR which will then direct them to the correct district.

Changes, such as a vehicle being sold or its owner moving residence, must be registered to keep the vehicle documentation up to date. If the vehicle remains within the district, the licence plates may be retained. A vehicle being relocated outside of the district has to be registered at the authority now competent. Whilst it was mandatory to have the plates altered, according to the current address, this obligation was reduced in 2015 and has meanwhile been abolished. Since then, it is generally not possible any more to tell the owner&#x27;s district of residence from the area code on the plates, as they may have registered it at a former residence e.g. in Hamburg yet moved to Frankfurt meanwhile.
When owners choose to deregister their vehicle, the officer at the local authority will want to see the licence plates with defaced seals on them as proof that the plate can no longer be used in public. For this purpose, special machines are available for use at the registration office. Once defaced, the plates may only be used legally on public roads for one return journey to the owner&#x27;s residence. If a vehicle is to be deregistered and a new one registered to the same owner, it is possible to swap the licence plate from old to new within the same process. Documentation and fees are necessary nonetheless, and neither vehicle should be used to reach the authority, as the assignment of the number changes by the minute.

It is general practice for owners to deregister their vehicles when selling them, typically when a sale is agreed. A sales contract is highly recommended, and various forms are available online for free. A seller may hand over their vehicle with valid licence plates and papers still in their name to the new owner, and the owner will complete the registration transfer to their name. In a scenario without a proper sales contract, the seller may become liable when the buyer commits traffic violations or even criminal acts related to the car or plates. It is generally not recommended to sell used cars with licence plates.

A car whose owner has not paid their insurance premium and is reported to the police by the insurance company may get , &quot;unstamped&quot; when found in a public place. The police will remove the official seal using a scratching tool like a screwdriver, leaving the plate without a valid seal. This renders the vehicle illegal to be used, or to be left in a public place, unless the insurance premium is paid and plates are fitted with a new official seal. A one-time journey to the relevant registration authorities is permitted to have the seal reinstated, once insurance is restored.

===Costs===
As of 2020, the average registration fee is €26.00 whilst further fees may apply for choosing an individual identifier or for reservation of such. Whereas some of these amounts are ordained by federal laws, others vary slightly from one district to the next. The prices for number plates, on the other hand, are subject to the free market and range from less than €10 up to around €40 per piece. Generally, it is cheaper to have the plates ordered online, but faster to walk across the street and have them made on the spot.

Further costs arise for motor vehicle tax (€194 on average yet very much depending on engine and emissions) and mandatory liability insurance (€260 on average, in 2019; depending on the model of the vehicle, age and residence of the owner, etc.). Comprehensive insurance is recommended but voluntary.

===Special types of registration===
Besides the most common way of registering a vehicle for everyday, all-year use indefinitely, it is possible to register for several months of each year, or for a few days in order to export the vehicle abroad. As well it is allowed, under certain restrictions, to register two vehicles (such as a car and a motorhome) under one number, with the same main licence plate. These variations may save expenses in tax and insurance. Further ways of saving apply to vintage cars and to electrically powered vehicles. Each of these special registrations are represented in the respective licence plate.

==Special codes, colours and formats==
Certain types of vehicle bear special codes.

===Different codes===
In deviating from the system described above, vehicles registered to federal, state or communal owners can bear licence plates not showing the district and sometimes omitting the middle letters.

====Highest state offices====

The President uses the licence plate 0-1, the Chancellor uses 0-2, the Foreign Minister uses 0-3 and the &quot;First State Secretary of the Foreign Office&quot; (i.e. the deputy Foreign Minister) uses 0-4. The President of the Parliament uses 1-1. This reflects the fact that the Parliament&#x27;s president is not part of the executive branch but still ranks higher in (symbolic) importance than the Chancellor. These vehicles are tax-exempt and need not to be insured since the German government acts as insurer.

====Military====

* Bundeswehr uses old style non-reflecting plates. The German flag is shown, instead of the blue EU strip. Bundeswehr plates use the letter Y instead of a city code, as no German city has this initial. The Y is followed by a dash and a six-digit number (or five digits for motorcycles), for example Y-123 456. These vehicles are tax-exempt and need not to be insured since the German government acts as insurer. There is also no mandatory technical inspection required but the Armed Forces carry out a regular internal inspection on these vehicles similar to the official inspection.
* Military vehicles which are used by the NATO headquarters in Germany use the same design as the Y-plates except they carry the letter X followed by a four-digit number, for example X-1234.

====Federal and state governments====
Both the federal government and federal state governments use special abbreviations instead of a city code. The code BD applies to the federal government, ministries, parliament, presidential office, etc., whereas the state governments and diets use their respective codes. This difference is not made in the Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen, as they fulfil both district and state function in addition to their municipality&#x27;s. In some , such as North Rhine-Westphalia, the state code is also used by the police.
====Federal administration====
Some branches and institutions of the federal government use their special prefix (often an abbreviation of their name) instead of a city code.
* The (German Federal Agency for Technical Relief) uses its abbreviation THW, so the plates read &quot;THW-80000&quot;, for example. All numbers on THW plates start either with the digit 8 or 9.
* The (Federal Administration of Waterways and Navigation) uses BW followed by a digit identifying the region of the office (from 1=north to 7=south).
* Before the (German Federal Railways) and the (German Federal Mail) were privatised, they used the abbreviations DB and BP (e.g. &quot;DB-12345&quot;, &quot;BP-12345&quot;).
* The federal police uses the code BP for instead of a local code. Before 2006 the code BG, for their former name , was used in the scheme &quot;BG-12345&quot;. This old code still remains valid, but any new vehicles will get the new code BP.
====Public sector====
Before the legal reforms of 2006, official vehicles such as police, fire fighting and municipal administration did not carry a letter after the sticker, but only the district prefix and a number, such as &quot;M-1234&quot;. These included:
* vehicles of the district government: 1–199, 1000–1999, 10000–19999
* vehicles of the local government, e.g. fire brigade: 200–299, 2000–2999, 20000–29999, 300–399
* police: 3000–3999, 7000–7999, 30000–39999, 70000–79999
* disaster relief (mostly changed to &quot;THW&quot;, see above): 8000–8999, 80000–89999
:This style of plate is no longer issued in most states, but many official vehicles which were registered before 2006 still carry this type of plate.
:A similar style is issued by some districts to consular or diplomatic vehicles in the form Aaa-9NNn (example: D-921). Unlike the other style of diplomatic/consular plates issued in Berlin and Bonn, this plate does not indicate the nationality of the mission.

====Diplomatic plates====
Plates of cars covered by diplomatic immunity bear the digit 0 (Zero), followed by a two- or three-digit number which indicates the specific diplomatic mission, a hyphen and another number counting within this mission. Traditionally, a digit 1 in this final place denotes the ambassador or . Lower-ranking embassy or consular staff without full diplomatic status are issued plates with the regular city code (mostly B for the capital, Berlin, or BN for the former capital, Bonn). The following characters are identical to the &quot;0-plates&quot;, e.g. B 19–256. Further holders of diplomatic plates are certain international organizations, such as the UNHCR or the European Central Bank.


===Different colours===
Very rarely, German licence plates bear characters in different colours than black. These exceptions are:

====Green on white====

Vehicles which are exempt from vehicle taxes (for example ambulances, tractors, agricultural trailers, trailers for boats or trailers for gliders) have green print on a white background plate. Regular trailers for lorries can be exempted from tax if the owner agrees to pay an increased tax on the vehicle which tows the trailer.

====Red on white – 06====

Car dealers&#x27; plates are in red print on a white background, and the code begins with 06. Red plates may be attached to cars which are changing hands, such as the test run of unregistered cars, and the liability insurance is connected to the plate, not a specific car.

====Red on white – 07====

Red plates starting with the number 07 are reserved for collectors of vintage vehicles. Originally, vintage vehicles had a required minimum age of 20 years from first registering. Since April 2007, the required minimum age has been 30 years. Plates issued under the old 20 years rule remained valid after this date. The collectors must get an official certificate of approval (such as no criminal records). They are allowed to use one set of plates on any of their vehicles under the condition that they keep a strict record of use. No day-to-day use of the vehicles is allowed. A valid official technical inspection is not mandatory but the vehicles have to be technically fit for use on public roads.

===Different formats and styles===
====H for historic====

Classic vehicles (known in German by the pseudo-English expression ) can get an H (, historic) at the end of the plate, such as &quot;K-AA 100H&quot; in order to preserve the so-called &quot;vehicle of cultural value&quot; (). This also implies a flat tax of around €190 per year. It is popular to choose the digits so that they indicate the car&#x27;s year of manufacture. The requirements for a vehicle to receive an H-Plate are:
*The first documented registration was at least 30 years ago.
*The car must be in mostly original and preservation worthy condition. Preservation worthy means a grade C by popular car grading standards. The older the car, the more signs of usage it can show. This purely concerns the car&#x27;s appearance; the road worthiness is established by separate mandatory safety inspections.

====E for electric====
The 2015 Electric Mobility Act authorised issuing special licence plates for plug-in electric vehicles to allow proper identification to avoid abuses of these privileges. The special licence plate adds the letter E at the end of the licence number. Owners of all-electric cars and plug-in hybrids with a minimum all-electric range of can apply for the special licence. The minimum range for eligible plug-in hybrids was increased from from 1 January 2018.

====Seasonal====

Seasonal number plates are popular for motorbikes or convertibles in the summertime, or for &quot;winter cars&quot; substituting them, yet these plates are available for any vehicle. They bear two 2-digit numbers at the end of the plate indicating the months between which they are registered to drive, with the licence being valid from the start of the upper month until the end of the lower month. This results in lower car taxes, as well as lower insurance premiums.

====Interchangeable====

Two vehicles of the same class (two cars, two motorbikes or light vehicles, two trailers) may be registered with an alternating licence plate. In this case, only the last digit varies – e.g. B-KJ 414|5 and B-KJ 414|6 – and is printed on an extra plate which remains on either vehicle, whereas the main part of the plate has to be attached to the vehicle in use. The main part carries the registration seal and a small letter W for , the individual part carries the technical inspection seal and below, in very small letters, the associated main number. Both vehicles have to pay full tax, yet the insurance premium may be discounted.

====Temporary registration====

Used vehicles which are not currently registered to any person or company – or have been deregistered by their current owner, temporarily or permanently – can be driven on public roads using short-term plates, valid for five days only. These are known as &quot;temporary number plates&quot; or &quot;yellow number plates&quot;, due to the yellow stripe. The first letter(s) indicate the issuing authority, as in regular German registrations. The numeric code starts with the numbers 04, e.g. &quot;DD-04321&quot;, and the plate has a yellow stripe on the right showing when they are valid. The date is listed numerically, on three lines, reading day, month, year, with two digits each. The vehicle need not have a valid technical inspection, however it must be technically fit to be operated in public. Typically they are used to drive to/from a technical inspection, or to move storage location of the vehicle. Insurance premiums are quite high, appr. €100 for the above-mentioned 5 days. Most insurance companies credit this premium if the car is registered as a normal car with the same insurance company after these 5 days. These temporary plates are only valid within Germany, and cannot be used to export the vehicle to a foreign country nor for transit. They can only be obtained by a resident of Germany.

====Export====
 (export plates) are used for exporting vehicles abroad. The owner does not have to be a German resident to register the car, but must provide identification such as a passport or ID card. The date on the red stripe on the right hand side shows the expiration date of the plate, as it indicates for how long the vehicle insurance and tax are paid. After this date, the vehicle must have left Germany, and is automatically deregistered from the German vehicle registration system. Use of the vehicle within Germany is permitted until the export date.
==History==
===German Empire and Weimar Republic===

The first German licence plates that had a lettering plan were issued from 1906 onwards. The various states and realms which made up the German Empire used different prefixes, such as Roman numerals ( representing Prussia, Bavaria, Württemberg, etc.) or plain letters ( for Hansestadt Hamburg, e.g.). Larger states added further identifiers for their provinces or regions. Saxony did not use any statewide numeral and only used Roman numerals for its provinces.


During World War I the German Army was assigned the combination MK for , military vehicle of the German Army. After the war, during the Weimar Republic, the German Army used RW for . Beyond this, there were no significant changes after the overthrow of the German monarchy.

===Nazi Germany===

During the Nazi regime (1933–1945), the system of licence plates was basically continued. New combinations were issued for nationwide institutions or organisations, such as DR (Deutsche Reichsbahn) for the railway authority, WH , WL , WM and WT for the military, or POL for the police.

While the Nazi state expanded and waged war, their bureaucrats applied their systems, including licence plates, to occupied countries or territories. Thus, plates of similar style were introduced in Austria, on Czech and Polish territory, in Alsace and Lorraine, and beyond.

===Postwar Germany===

After 1945, however, the victorious allied forces abolished the system of German licence plates and instead assigned new lettering combinations in their respective occupation zones. Although each nation implemented their own ideas initially, a system for all four zones was introduced by 1949. At first, the different zones were distinguishable by the first letter prefix A, B, F or S standing for the American, British, French or Soviet occupation zone, respectively. A second letter below indicated the area or country in question, such as stood for &quot;American zone/Bavaria&quot;. This area code was followed by a two-digit number signifying the district and another number counting within that area. Often the numbers would become scarce after some years and another zone prefix without the first letter was introduced additionally.

The city of Berlin had a special status and, consequentially, special plates. Having abolished the old number plates in 1945, the Soviet occupation forces issued plates with Cyrillic characters at first. Motorcycles were issued БM (=BM, 1945–1946) and ГM (GM, 1945–1947). Cars, lorries and buses received ГФ (=GF, 1945–1946) and БГ (=BG, 1945–1947). These were replaced on the insistence of the western powers, first to KB for &quot;Kommandatura Berlin&quot; and, in the Eastern part of the city, to GB in 1948.

====Vehicles of occupation/NATO forces====

The British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), initially occupation forces, later NATO elements, issued servicemen with plates carrying white letters and numerals on a black background for their personal vehicles. These cars stood out in comparison to the black on white German plates, and following the terrorist murder of a British serviceman, identified when returning to his car with BAOR licence plates, servicemen had to opt for their cars to carry either UK plates (generally right-hand drive vehicles) or German plates (generally left-hand drive vehicles). During the time that Belgian forces were stationed in West Germany, white on black plates similar to the BAOR plates were used.

====US Forces vehicles====
The American Forces have tried to “blend in” their servicepersons′ private vehicles in another way. Starting in 2000, they adopted a type of which closely resembled the German plates yet bore area codes which were at that time not assigned to any district, i.e. AD, AF and HK, later also IF and QQ. These codes still stood out, especially as they bore the NATO symbol instead of the EU&#x27;s circle of stars and the registration seal candidly read instead of, e.g. . Since 2006, the vehicles in question bear with regular German area codes, generally referring to the district of their official stationing.

===East Germany, &quot;DDR&quot;===

The German Democratic Republic issued their own style of licence plates beginning in 1953. The first letter would indicate the (administrative district) where the vehicle was registered. These initials, however, did not refer to the name of the Bezirk but were distributed almost alphabetically from North to South.

After German reunification in 1990, the DDR plates were soon abolished and the West German system introduced, starting in 1991 and completed in 1993. Even before this transition phase, it could be observed that licence plates in GDR scheme were produced with West German typeface on the respective machinery.

===West Germany===
In July 1956 the current system was introduced in then West Germany, replacing the post-war system. The occupation zones were no longer referred to, instead the new system based on the districts of Germany. Each of these was assigned an alphabetic code which had its origin in the name of the district, i.e. of the city or of the capital of the rural district. Quite often, a &quot;district-free&quot; city was surrounded by, or adjacent to a rural district of the same name. In this case, they would both share the code as well as the name, yet devise a way how to split the possible alphanumerical combinations.
The number of letters in the area code hints at the size of the district. The basic idea was to even out the number of characters on all licence plates, because the most populous districts would have more cars and, consequently, more digits after the prefix. The largest German cities generally only have one-letter codes, such as B=Berlin, M=Munich (), K=Cologne (), F=Frankfurt, S=Stuttgart, H=Hannover. Therefore, cities or districts with fewer letters are generally assumed to be bigger and more important whereas three-letter codes tend to be regarded as rural and dull. Reflecting that, most districts aimed for a combination with fewer letters for their prefix code.

The most significant exception of the one-letter code is Germany&#x27;s second largest city Hamburg which bears HH for , because of its historical membership in the Hanseatic League, reflected already in its prefix used between 1906 and 1945. A similar principle applies to Bremen and Bremerhaven, forming the state Free Hanseatic City of Bremen and sharing the common prefix HB (1906–1947, and again since 1956). Likewise, Lübeck received its former prefix HL, already used between 1906 and 1937 when its statehood was abolished.

The first drafts, however, had to be altered in a few cases. The district of Wittlich rejected the code &quot;WC&quot;, understandably, and received WIL instead. The code &quot;KZ&quot;, initially projected for Konstanz, was withdrawn fast, due to recent history, and replaced by KN. Neither were &quot;SA&quot;, &quot;SS&quot; or &quot;HJ&quot; considered to be issued. The code &quot;SD&quot; was projected for Stade and was finally altered into STD after protests from that district who did not want to bear the abbreviation of the .

When originally planned, the system included codes for districts in Eastern Germany which were to be reserved until reunification. That included the territory of the GDR as well as the territories annexed to Poland and the Soviet Union after World War II, which West Germany&#x27;s government still claimed in that era until about 1970. When reunification came in 1990, the reserved codes (e.g. &quot;P&quot; for Potsdam) were indeed issued to East German districts in January 1991, often as originally planned and as they existed at that time.

====First changes====
Starting in the early 1970s, West German districts were extensively rearranged. In order to reduce their number and so simplify governance, different steps could be taken:
* city districts &quot;swallowed&quot; neighboring municipalities and thus grew.
* city districts lost their sovereignty and were integrated into the surrounding or neighbouring rural district.
* rural districts merged with one or several others, or were split up between neighbouring districts.
* single municipalities were moved between districts, as was deemed appropriate or practical.
In each of these cases, the new districts had to be endowed with an area code. Again, various solutions were possible:
* the largest or most populous district bestowed its name and code upon the newly created unit.
* one former district gave its name and/or capital while another&#x27;s area code was used for the new district.
* the new unit was given a new name yet continued to use an existing area code.
* the new unit was given a new name and created a new area code.
In any case, the adamant rule was that &quot;one&quot; area code per district was valid and would be issued to any vehicle registered henceforth. Existing registrations would remain valid until the vehicle was removed from this district to be either relocated or permanently deregistered. Another rule, however, was abolished. Whereas rural districts had generally been named after their capital town, it was now possible to create new names, applying to geographical or historical features. As well it was possible to combine the names of the districts that had merged, either keeping one of their codes or creating a new one.

===Germany reunited===

When the GDR ceased to exist and Germany was reunited in its present size on 3 October 1990, new area codes were issued to the East German districts. In many cases they could be taken from the old lists that had been prepared before 1956: P stood for Potsdam, EF for Erfurt, SON for Sonneberg. Yet, a considerable number of codes was altered, either because a code which had been reserved for a district in today&#x27;s Poland or Russia had become available, or because the projected code had meanwhile been issued to a West German district.

A prominent example of a reserved code being reused before reunification was one-letter L which was originally planned for Leipzig, by far the largest German city starting with L. However this code was given to the newly formed Hessian city of Lahn and the district Lahn-Dill-Kreis in 1977, as hopes for reunification faded away. After the rather unexpected reunification (and Lahn city having split up again and thus abolished in 1979), the L was returned to the city of Leipzig and Lahn-Dill-Kreis was issued LDK instead.

The letter G was first reserved for the East German city of Görlitz and later awarded to the city of Gera, although both are smaller than the West German Gelsenkirchen (GE). The area code ZK had been reserved, in the 1950s, for the city of Zwickau but was rejected as ZK had become the abbreviation of the loathed of the former Communist party SED.

In analogy to the three northwestern Hamburg, Bremen and Lübeck, but without historical examples of formerly issued prefixes, four northeastern Hanseatic cities, Greifswald, Rostock, Stralsund and Wismar, chose the prefixes HGW, HRO, HST and HWI. There were no suitable two-letter codes available since HG, HR, HS and HW were already taken by West German districts.

Beginning in the mid-1990s, however, districts in East Germany were rearranged again, similar to the West two decades before. Thus many of these codes issued before were now outdated, but could still be seen alongside the new code. This rearrangement was continued in a second step after 2000, which created large districts with a remarkable variety of possible area codes registered. Still, only one of these was the current one which would be issued to vehicles registered at the moment.

===Liberalized registration rules===
After the reorganization of districts, from the 1970s onward, many area codes expired and new ones were created at that time. However, number plates issued before these rearrangements remain valid, providing the vehicle is still in use and has not been reregistered since. So it was still possible, if rare, to see a classic car with registration codes of administrative units that have not existed for over 30 years. 

A study conducted in 2010–12 produced the result that 72% of the German population would welcome the possibility to use again these abolished area codes whereas only 13% opposed the idea. 
It was regarded as remarkable that even young people who had never driven a car with such an &quot;old&quot; prefix favoured the idea of this so-called (licence plate liberalization).

The police, however, warned against this step, as it had turned out that observant citizens would easily notice a car with a number plate from a distant district, thus assisting the police in solving crimes. Plates from the vicinity, on the other hand, would be easier to remember in full, and this would also help to find offenders. More opposition came from local politicians who maintained they had at last succeeded in unifying their merged districts and healed the wounds of those inhabitants who had to give up &quot;their&quot; prefix. If that prefix was available again, they feared, it might lead to old feuds within districts flaming up anew.

Nonetheless, the Federal Ministry of Transport complied with the majority of citizens. Beginning in November 2012 in some districts, and meanwhile nationwide, most of these expired prefix codes have been reintroduced, e.g. in the district of Wesel, it has again become possible to register vehicles with MO as used for the former district of Moers and DIN as used for the former district of Dinslaken, additionally to the standard WES which had been the only code issued since 1975. As of September 2024, the liberalization has led to 328 previously abolished codes being reintroduced.

In 2024, the same college which had initiated this movement suggested a second step. Every town above 20,000 inhabitants should be able to apply for their own code, even if they had never had one and were subordinate municipalities of a district.
 The reactions by the political bodies responsible for an implementation of this idea were restained but varied.

===Slackening of rules===
Furthermore, it has become possible to &quot;take one&#x27;s number along&quot;, i.e. to keep a licence plate issued at the previous address after moving away from that district. For that reason, the area code and the respective state seal on a licence plate do not necessarily mean that the vehicle&#x27;s owner really lives there.

In 2023, the city of Munich applied for a second code, as the remaining free combinations with M, which the city has to share with the district of Munich, were becoming scarce. The code MUC, which is also the IATA code for Munich Airport, was granted by the Federal government on 21 September.

==Insurance plates==


Light motorised vehicles such as mopeds, motorized wheelchairs and other small, low-power vehicles (such as vehicles for the physically handicapped, with a maximum speed of ) are required to have a registration plate of a different kind. This (insurance plate) uses a system of three digits on the top and three letters beneath. Both numbers and letters are chosen randomly so personalising the plates is not possible. Plates are much smaller than the plates for normal cars and are only valid for one year from 1 March until the end of February the following year. Those plates are sold by insurance companies, so the fee includes both the registration and the cost of one year&#x27;s insurance for the vehicle. There are four colours used: black, blue, green for normal plates, and red for temporary use, such as testing (very rare). The first three colours are changed every year in order to make it easy to see whether the vehicle has the correct plate and insurance.

<text>Hijli Detention Camp (now called Shaheed Bhavan, IIT Kharagpur), is a former detention camp operated during the period of British colonial rule in India. Located in Hijli, beside Kharagpur, (a part of former Hijli Kingdom) in the district of Midnapore West, West Bengal, India, it played a significant role in the Indian independence movement of the 19th and 20th centuries.

The large numbers of those who participated in armed struggles or the non-cooperation movement against the British could not be accommodated in ordinary jails. The British colonial government decided to establish a few detention camps; the first one was located in Buxa Fort followed by the creation of Hijli Detention Camp in 1930. A significant moment in the Indian independence movement occurred at here in 1931 when two unarmed detainees, Santosh Kumar Mitra and Tarakeswar Sengupta, were shot dead by the Indian Imperial Police. Subhas Chandra Bose came to Hijli to collect their bodies for interment. Many Indian nationalists, including Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, voiced strong protests against the British Raj over this incident. The firing which later known as &quot;Hijli firing&quot; is the only incident of police firing inside a detention camp.

The detention camp was closed in 1937 and was reopened in 1940. In 1942 it was closed for the final time and the detainees were transferred elsewhere. During the Second World War it was occupied by the US Air Force.

Today, the camp is also known for being the birthplace of Indian Institute of Technology - Kharagpur, which started in 1951. In 1990, a part of the former detention camp buildings were converted to house the Nehru Museum of Science and Technology.

<text>China National Highway 109 connects Beijing with Lhasa. It runs westwards from Beijing via Datong, Yinchuan and Xining to Golmud before turning southwest to Lhasa. The portion of the highway from Xining to Lhasa is known as the Qinghai-Tibet Highway. The total length of the route is 3,901 km.

Fushi Road or Jinglan Road forms the stretch of G109 in Beijing, as it begins from Fuchengmen and traverses through Shijingshan. The majority of the Beijing section is in Mentougou District.

The section of the highway within western Qinghai and Tibet, from Golmud to Lhasa, is paralleled by the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. The highway reaches its highest elevation of at Tanggula Pass. Construction of this section started on 11 May 1954.

&quot;Tasked with carrying upwards of 85 per cent of goods in and out of Tibet, the Qinghai-Tibet Highway has been dubbed the &quot;Lifeline of Tibet.&quot; ... Since it was opened to traffic in 1954, the central government has spent nearly 3 billion yuan (US$362 million) on three major overhauls. It was asphalted in 1985.&quot;
The route also holds importance as one of the main coal transport routes in southern Inner Mongolia.

<doc id="1038887" wikidata="Q162927" url="?curid=1038887" title="Natural gas vehicle">
<text>A natural gas vehicle (NGV) utilizes compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied natural gas (LNG) as an alternative fuel source. Distinguished from autogas vehicles fueled by liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), NGVs rely on methane combustion, resulting in cleaner emissions due to the removal of contaminants from the natural gas source. 

Conversion of existing gasoline or diesel vehicles to NGVs is feasible, offering both dedicated and bi-fuel options. Heavy-duty vehicles such as trucks and buses can also undergo conversion, utilizing spark ignition systems or hybrid electric motor configurations. 

Challenges in NGV adoption include the storage and refueling of natural gas, given its pressurized or liquefied state. While advancements in compression and liquefaction mitigate energy density differences, trade-offs regarding storage container size, complexity, and weight continue to affect vehicle range. Despite these challenges, the safety and cost advantages of methane over hydrogen fuel contribute to its viability.

Obstacles to widespread NGV adoption for private vehicles include concerns over additional weight, technological unfamiliarity, and limited refueling infrastructure in some regions. Nevertheless, global NGV numbers reached nearly 28 million by 2019, with significant market presence in countries such as China, Iran, India, Pakistan, Argentina, Brazil, and Italy.

== Advantages ==

CNG may be generated and used for bulk storage and pipeline transport of renewable energy and also be mixed with biomethane, itself derived from biogas from landfills or anaerobic digestion. This allows for the use of CNG in mobility with significantly lower carbon emissions compared to regular diesel-powered vehicles. It would also allow the continued use of CNG vehicles currently powered by non-renewable fossil fuels so that those vehicles do not become obsolete if stricter emissions regulations are mandated to combat climate change.

A key advantage of using natural gas is the existence, in principle, of most of the infrastructure and supply chain, which is non-interchangeable with hydrogen. Methane today mostly comes from non-renewable sources but can be supplied or produced from renewable sources, offering net carbon-neutral mobility. In many markets, especially the Americas, natural gas may trade at a discount to other fossil fuel products such as petrol, diesel or coal, or indeed be a less valuable by-product associated with their production that has to be disposed of. Many countries also provide tax incentives for natural gas-powered vehicles due to the environmental benefits to society. Lower operating costs and government incentives to reduce pollution from heavy vehicles in urban areas have driven the adoption of NGV for commercial and public uses, i.e. trucks and buses.

== Challenges ==
Despite its advantages, the use of natural gas vehicles faces several limitations, including fuel storage and infrastructure available for delivery and distribution at fueling stations. CNG must be stored in high-pressure cylinders (), and LNG must be stored in cryogenic cylinders (). These cylinders take up more space than gasoline or diesel tanks that can be molded in intricate shapes to store more fuel and use less on-vehicle space. CNG tanks are sometimes located in the vehicle&#x27;s trunk or pickup bed, reducing the space for other cargo. This problem is sometimes mitigated by installing the tanks under the vehicle&#x27;s body or on the roof (typical for buses), leaving cargo areas free. As with alternative fuels, other barriers to the widespread use of NGVs are natural gas distribution and the lower number of CNG and LNG stations then liquid fuels.

Other challenges include relatively expensive and environmentally insensitive but convenience-seeking private individuals; good profits and taxes extractable from small-batch sales of value-added, branded petrol and diesel fuels via established trade channels and oil refiners; resistance and safety concerns to increasing gas inventories in urban areas; dual-use of utility distribution networks originally built for home gas supply and allocation of network expansion costs; reluctance, effort and costs associated with switching; prestige and nostalgia associated with petroleum vehicles; fear of redundancy and disruption. A particular challenge may be that refiners are currently set up to produce a certain fuel mix from crude oil. Aviation fuel is likely to remain the fuel of choice for aircraft due to its weight sensitivity for the foreseeable future

== Infrastructure ==
NGV filling stations can be located anywhere natural gas lines exist. Compressors (CNG) or liquefaction plants (LNG) are usually built on a large scale, but small home CNG refueling stations are possible. A company called Fuel Maker pioneered a system called Phil Home Refueling Appliance (known as &quot;Phil&quot;), which they developed in partnership with Honda for the American GX model. Phil is now manufactured and sold by BRC Fuel Maker, a division of Fuel Systems Solutions, Inc.

== Deployment ==
The Asia-Pacific region leads the world with 6.8 million vehicles, followed by Latin America with 4.2 million. In Latin America, almost 90% of NGVs have bi-fuel engines, allowing these vehicles to run on either gasoline or CNG. In Pakistan, almost every vehicle converted to (or manufactured for) alternative fuel use typically retains the capability of running on gasoline.

As of 2016, the U.S. had a fleet of 160,000 NG vehicles, including 3,176 LNG vehicles. Other countries where natural gas-powered buses are popular include India, Australia, Argentina, Germany, and Greece. In OECD countries, there are around 500,000 CNG vehicles. Pakistan&#x27;s market share of NGVs was 61.1% in 2010, followed by Armenia with more than 77% (2014), and Bolivia with 20%. The number of NGV refueling stations has also increased to 18,202 worldwide as of 2010, up 10.2% from the previous year.

==CNG/LNG as fuel for automobiles==
An increasing number of vehicles worldwide are being manufactured to run on CNG by major carmakers. Until recently, the Honda Civic GX was the only NGV commercially available in the US market. More recently, Ford, General Motors and Ram Trucks have bi-fuel offerings in their vehicle lineup. In 2006, the Brazilian subsidiary of FIAT introduced the Fiat Siena Tetra fuel, a four-fuel car that can run on natural gas (CNG).

CNG-powered vehicles are considered safer than gasoline-powered ones.
===Available production cars===
Existing gasoline-powered vehicles may be converted to run on CNG or LNG, and can be dedicated (running only on natural gas) or bi-fuel (running on either gasoline or natural gas). However, an increasing number of vehicles worldwide are being manufactured to run on CNG. Until recently, the now-discontinued Honda Civic GX was the only NGV commercially available in the US market. More recently, Ford, General Motors and Ram Trucks have bi-fuel offerings in their vehicle lineup. Ford&#x27;s approach is to offer a bi-fuel prep kit as a factory option and then have the customer choose an authorized partner to install the natural gas equipment. Choosing GM&#x27;s bi-fuel option sends the HD pickups with the 6.0L gasoline engine to IMPCO in Indiana to upfit the vehicle to run on CNG. Ram currently is the only pickup truck manufacturer with a truly CNG factory-installed bi-fuel system available in the U.S. market.

Outside the U.S. GM do Brasil introduced the Multipower engine in 2004, which was capable of using CNG, alcohol, and gasoline (E20-E25 blend) as fuel. It was used in the Chevrolet Astra 2.0 model 2005, aimed at the taxi market. In 2006, the Brazilian subsidiary of FIAT introduced the Fiat Siena Tetra fuel, a four-fuel car developed under Magneti Marelli of Fiat Brazil. This automobile can run on natural gas (CNG); 100% ethanol (); gasoline blend, Brazil&#x27;s mandatory gasoline; and pure gasoline. However, it is no longer available in Brazil but is used in other neighboring countries.

In 2015, Honda announced its decision to phase out the commercialization of natural-gas-powered vehicles to focus on the development of a new generation of electrified vehicles such as hybrids, plug-in electric cars and hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles. Since 2008, Honda sold about 16,000 natural gas vehicles, mainly to taxi and commercial fleets.

===Differences between LNG and CNG fuels===
Though LNG and CNG are both considered NGVs, the technologies are vastly different. Refueling equipment, fuel cost, pumps, tanks, hazards, and capital costs are different.

One thing they share is that due to engines made for gasoline, computer-controlled valves to control fuel mixtures are required for both of them, often being proprietary and specific to the manufacturer. The on-engine technology for fuel metering is the same for LNG and CNG.

===CNG as an auto fuel===
CNG, or compressed natural gas, is stored at high pressure, . The required tank is more massive and costly than a conventional fuel tank. Commercial on-demand refueling stations are more expensive to operate than LNG stations because of the energy required for compression; the compressor requires 100 times more electrical power. However, slow-fill (many hours) can be cost-effective with LNG stations [missing citation - the initial liquefaction of natural gas by cooling requires more energy than gas compression]. The time to fill a CNG tank varies greatly depending on the station. Home refuels typically fill at about 1 kg/h (0.4 GGE/h). At gas stations, where the pressure is greatly higher, it is possible to refill a 25 kg (10 GGE) tank in 5–10 minutes. Also, because of the lower energy density, the CNG range is lower compared to LNG. Gas composition and throughput allowing, it should be feasible to connect commercial CNG fueling stations to city gas networks or enable home fueling of CNG vehicles directly using a gas compressor. Similar to a car battery, the CNG tank of a car could double as a home energy storage device, and the compressor could be powered at times when there is excess / free renewable electrical energy.

===LNG as an auto fuel===

LNG, or liquified natural gas, is natural gas that has been cooled to the point that it is a cryogenic liquid. Its liquid state is still more than twice as dense as CNG. LNG is either dispensed from bulk storage tanks or made locally from utility pipes at LNG fuel stations. Because of its cryogenic nature, it is stored in specially designed insulated tanks. Generally speaking, these tanks operate at fairly low pressures (about ) when compared to CNG. A vaporizer is mounted in the fuel system, turning the LNG into a gas (which may be considered low-pressure CNG). When comparing a commercial LNG station with a CNG station, utility infrastructure, capital cost, and electricity heavily favor LNG over CNG, but the availability of piped gas is more common than LNG delivery by tanker. There are existing LCNG stations (CNG and LNG), where fuel is stored as LNG, then vaporized to CNG on demand. LCNG stations require less capital cost than fast-fill CNG stations alone but more than LNG stations.

Aside from different fuel tanks, fuel metering, and computer modules, the engines in NG vehicles could be run by CNG or LNG without requiring any modification because both are forms of natural gas.

===Advantages over gasoline and diesel===
LNG – and especially CNG – tends to corrode and wear the parts of an engine less rapidly than gasoline. Thus, it is quite common to find diesel-engine NGVs with high mileages (over ). CNG also emits 20-29% less than diesel and gasoline. Emissions are cleaner, with lower emissions of carbon and lower particulate emissions per equivalent distance traveled. There is generally less wasted fuel. However, the cost (monetary, environmental, pre-existing infrastructure) of distribution, compression, and cooling must be taken into account. In addition, natural gas has a higher Octane rating than gasoline, with an octane rating of 112 RON/105 AKI for propane and 120 RON/120 AKI for methane, making it less likely to cause engine knocking.

===Inherent advantages/disadvantages between autogas (LPG) power and NGV===
Autogas, also known as LPG or propane, has a different chemical composition. However, it is still a petroleum-based gas produced from refining petroleum oil and has several inherent advantages and disadvantages, as well as noninherent ones. The inherent advantage of autogas over CNG is that it requires far less compression (20% of CNG cost), is denser and easier to store as at this lower pressure it is a liquid at room temperature, and thus requires far cheaper tanks (consumer) and fuel compressors (provider) than CNG. As compared to LNG, it requires no chilling (and thus less energy) or problems associated with the extreme cold such as frostbite. Like NGVs, it also has advantages over gasoline and diesel in terms of cleaner emissions and less wear on engines than gasoline. A major drawback of LPG is its safety. The fuel is volatile and flammable, and the fumes are heavier than air, which causes them to collect in a low spot in the event of a leak, making it far more hazardous to use. More care is needed in handling this. Besides this, LPG (40% from Crude Oil refining) has historically been more expensive than Natural Gas, even though the energy density per weight is higher.

====Current advantages of LPG power over NGV====

In places like the US, Thailand, and India, there are five to ten times more LPG stations, thus making the fuel more accessible than NGV stations. In some countries like Poland, South Korea, and Turkey, LPG stations and autos are widespread, while NGVs are not. In addition, retail LPG fuel is considerably cheaper in some countries, such as Thailand.

===Future possibilities===
Though ANG (adsorbed natural gas) has not yet been used in either providing stations nor consumer storage tanks, its low compression ( vs ) has the potential to drive down costs of NGV infrastructure and vehicle tanks.

==LNG fueled vehicles==
As of 2014, two common types of engines used on heavy NG-fueled vehicles were stoichiometric spark-ignited ones (Otto cycle) and lean-burn compression-ignited ones (Diesel cycle).

===Use of LNG to fuel large over-the-road trucks===
LNG is being evaluated and tested for over-the-road trucking, off-road, marine, and railroad applications. There are known problems with the fuel tanks and the delivery of gas to the engine.

China has been a leader in the use of LNG vehicles with over 100,000 LNG powered vehicles on the road as of 2014.

In the United States, there were 69 public truck LNG fuel centers as of February 2015. The 2013 National Trucker&#x27;s Directory lists approximately 7,000 truck stops, thus approximately 1% of US truck stops have LNG available.

In 2013, Dillon Transport announced they were putting 25 large LNG trucks into service in Dallas, USA. They are refueling at a public LNG fuel center. The same year Raven Transportation announced they were buying 36 LNG large trucks to be fueled by Clean Energy Fuels locations and Lowe&#x27;s finished converting one of its dedicated fleets to LNG fueled trucks.

UPS had over 1200 LNG fueled trucks on the roads in February 2015. UPS has 16,000 tractor trucks in its fleet, and 60 of the new 2014 large trucks will be placed in service in the Houston, USA area, where UPS is building its own private LNG fuel center to avoid the lines at retail fuel centers. In Amarillo, USA and Oklahoma City, USA, UPS is using public fuel centers.

Clean Energy Fuels has opened several public LNG Fuel Lanes along I-10 and claims that as of June 2014, LNG fueled trucks can use the route from Los Angeles to Houston, USA by refueling exclusively at Clean Energy Fuels public facilities. In 2014 Shell and Travel Centers of America opened the first of a planned network of U.S. truck stop LNG stations in California, USA. Per the alternative fuel fuelling centre tracking site there are 10 LNG capable public fuel stations in the greater Los Angeles area, making it the single most penetrated metro market. As of February 2015, Blu LNG has at least 23 operational LNG capable fuel centers across 8 states, and Clean Energy had 39 operational public LNG facilities.

As can be seen at the alternative fuel fueling center tracking site, as of early 2015 there is a void of LNG fuel centers, public and private, from Illinois to the Rockies. A Noble Energy LNG production plant in northern Colorado was planned to go online in the first quarter of 2015 and to have a capacity of 100,000 gallons of LNG per day for on-road, off-road, and drilling operations.

As of 2014, LNG fuel and NGVs had not achieved much usage in Europe.

American Gas &amp; Technology pioneered the use of onsite liquefaction using van sized station to access Natural Gas from utility pipe and clean, liquefy, store, and dispense it. Their stations make of LNG per day.

===Use of LNG to fuel high-horsepower/high-torque engines===
In internal combustion engines, the volume of the cylinders is a common measure of the power of an engine. Thus, a 2000cc engine would typically be more powerful than a 1800cc engine, but that assumes a similar air-fuel mixture is used.

If via a turbocharger as an example, the 1800cc engine were using an air-fuel mixture that was significantly more energy dense, then it might be able to produce more power than a 2000cc engine burning a less energy-dense air-fuel mixture. However, turbochargers are both complex and expensive. Thus, it becomes clear that for high-horsepower/high-torque engines, a fuel that can inherently be used to create an energy-dense dense air-fuel mixture is preferred because a smaller and simpler engine can produce the same power.

With traditional gasoline and diesel engines, the energy density of the air-fuel mixture is limited because the liquid fuels do not mix well in the cylinder. Further, gasoline and diesel auto-ignite at temperatures and pressures relevant to engine design. An important part of traditional engine design is designing the cylinders, compression ratios, and fuel injectors such that pre-ignition is avoided, but at the same time as much fuel as possible can be injected, become well mixed, and still have time to complete the combustion process during the power stroke.

Natural gas does not auto-ignite at pressures and temperatures relevant to traditional gasoline and diesel engine design, thus providing more flexibility in the design of a natural gas engine. Methane, the main component of natural gas, has an autoignition temperature of 580 °C, whereas gasoline and diesel autoignite at approximately 250 °C and 210 °C respectively.

With a compressed natural gas (CNG) engine, the mixing of the fuel and the air is more effective since gases typically mix well in a short period of time. Still, at typical CNG compression pressures, the fuel itself is less energy dense than gasoline or diesel thus the result is a lower energy dense air-fuel mixture. Thus for the same cylinder displacement engine, a non-turbocharged CNG-powered engine is typically less powerful than a similarly sized gasoline or diesel engine. For that reason, turbochargers are popular in European CNG cars. Despite that limitation, the 12 litre Cummins Westport ISX12G engine is an example of a CNG capable engine designed to pull tractor/trailer loads up to showing CNG can be used in most if not all on-road truck applications. The original ISX G engines incorporated a turbocharger to enhance the air-fuel energy density.

LNG offers a unique advantage over CNG for more demanding high-horsepower applications by eliminating the need for a turbocharger. Because LNG boils at approximately -160 °C, using a simple heat exchanger, a small amount of LNG can be converted to its gaseous form at extremely high pressure with little or no mechanical energy. A properly designed high-horsepower engine can leverage this high-pressure energy-dense gaseous fuel source to create a higher energy-density air-fuel mixture than can be efficiently created with a CNG-powered engine. Compared to CNG engines, the result is more overall efficiency in high-horsepower engine applications when high-pressure direct injection technology is used. The Westport HDMI2 fuel system is an example of a high-pressure direct injection technology that does not require a turbocharger if teamed with appropriate LNG heat exchanger technology. The Volvo Trucks 13-liter LNG engine is another example of an LNG engine leveraging advanced high-pressure technology.

Westport recommends CNG for engines 7 litres or smaller and LNG with direct injection for engines between 20 and 150 litres. For engines between 7 and 20 litres, either option is recommended. See slide 13 from their NGV BRUXELLES – INDUSTRY INNOVATION SESSION presentation

High horsepower engines in the oil drilling, mining, locomotive, and marine fields have been or are being developed. Paul Blomerus has written a paper concluding as much as 40 million tonnes per annum of LNG could be required to meet the global needs of the high-horsepower engines by 2025 to 2030.

As of the end of the first quarter of 2015, Prometheus Energy Group Inc claims to have delivered over 100 million gallons (380 million litres) of LNG within the previous four years into the industrial market, and is continuing to add new customers.

===Motorcycles===

Scooters can also use CNG as a fuel source.

===Ships===
The was the world&#x27;s first LNG powered container ship. LNG carriers are sometimes powered by the boil-off of LNG from their storage tanks, although Diesel powered LNG carriers are also common to minimize loss of cargo and enable more versatile refueling.

===Aircraft===

Some airplanes use LNG to power their turbofans. Aircraft are susceptible to weight; much of an aircraft&#x27;s weight goes into fuel carriage. Liquified natural gas has a high specific energy (MJ/kg), a useful optimization for flight applications.

== Chemical composition and energy content ==
=== Chemical composition ===
The primary component of natural gas is methane (CH4), the shortest and lightest hydrocarbon molecule. It may also contain heavier gaseous hydrocarbons such as ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8) and butane (C4H10), as well as other gases, in varying amounts. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S - acid gas) is a common contaminant, which must be removed prior to most uses.

===Energy content===
Combustion of one cubic meter yields 38 MJ (10.6 kWh). Natural gas has the highest energy/carbon ratio of any fossil fuel and thus produces less carbon dioxide per unit of energy.

== Storage and transport ==
===Transport===

The major difficulty in the use of natural gas is transportation. Natural gas pipelines are economical and common on land and across medium-length stretches of water (like Langeled, Interconnector and Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline), but are impractical across large oceans. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker ships, railway tankers, and tank trucks are also used.

===Storage===

CNG is typically stored in steel or composite containers at high pressure (). These containers are not typically temperature controlled but are allowed to stay at local ambient temperature. There are many standards for CNG cylinders. The most popular one is ISO 11439. For North America the standard is ANSI NGV-2.

LNG storage pressures are typically around 3 to 10 bar. At atmospheric pressure, LNG is at a temperature of -162 °C. However, in a vehicle tank under pressure, the temperature is slightly higher (see saturated fluid). Storage temperatures may vary due to varying composition and storage pressure. LNG is far denser than even the highly compressed state of CNG. As a consequence of the low temperatures, vacuum-insulated storage tanks typically made of stainless steel are used to hold LNG.

CNG can be stored at lower pressure in a form known as an ANG (Adsorbed Natural Gas) tank at 35 bar (500 psi, the pressure of gas in natural gas pipelines) in various sponge-like materials, such as activated carbon and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The fuel is stored at similar or greater energy density than CNG. This means that vehicles can be refuelled from the natural gas network without extra gas compression, and the fuel tanks can be slimmed down and made of lighter, less strong materials.

=== Conversion kits ===

Conversion kits for gasoline or diesel to LNG/CNG are available in many countries, along with the labor to install them. However, the range of prices and quality of conversion vary enormously.

Recently, regulations involving certification of installations in the USA have been loosened to include certified private companies, those same kit installations for CNG have fallen to the $6,000+ range (depending on the type of vehicle).

==Implementation==


===Overview===
Natural gas vehicles are popular in regions or countries where natural gas is abundant and where the government chooses to price CNG lower than gasoline. The use of natural gas began in the Po River Valley of Italy in the 1930s, followed by New Zealand in the 1980s, though its use has declined there. At the peak of New Zealand&#x27;s natural gas use, 10% of the nation&#x27;s cars were converted, around 110,000 vehicles. In the United States CNG powered buses are the favorite choice of several public transit agencies, with a fleet of more than 114,000 vehicles, mostly buses. India, Australia, Argentina, and Germany also have widespread use of natural gas-powered buses in their public transportation fleets.

===Europe===

====Germany====
As of December 2011, Germany has 900 CNG filling stations in service. Gibgas, an independent consumer group, estimates that 21% of all CNG filling stations in the country offer a natural gas/biomethane mix to varying ratios, and 38 stations offer pure biomethane.

==== Greece ====
Greece uses natural gas buses for public transport in Athens.
Also, the Public Gas Company (DEPA) has a network of 14 stations (as of June 2020), under brand &quot;Fisikon&quot;, with expansion plans.

====Ireland====
Bus Éireann Introduced the first NGV on 17 July 2012. It will operate on the 216 city centre to Mount Oval, Rochestown, route until mid-August on trial being undertaken in partnership with Ervia. The Eco-city bus is made by MAN.

====Italy====
Natural gas traction is quite popular in Italy, due to the existence of a capillary distribution network for industrial use since the late 50s and a traditionally high retail price for petrol. As of April 2012 there were about 1500 filling stations, spread on the entire country except for the island of Sardinia, while the fleet reached 730,000 CNG vehicles at the end of 2010.

====Ukraine====
Ukraine&#x27;s first compressed natural gas refueling station (CNGS) was commissioned in 1937. Today, there is a well-developed CNGS network across the country. Many buses were converted to run on CNG during the 1990s, primarily for economic reasons. The retrofitted cylinders are often visible atop the vehicle&#x27;s roof and/or underneath the body. Despite their age, these buses remain in service and continue to provide reliable public transport combined with the environmental benefits of CNG.

====United Kingdom====

CNG buses are beginning to be used in the UK, e.g. by Reading Buses and Nottingham City Transport. The latter company purchased 53 double-decker gas buses between 2017 and 2018, earning them the world record for the largest fleet of CNG buses in the world. In 2019, Nottingham City Transport purchased a further 67 CNG buses.

===North America===
====Canada====
Natural Gas has been used as a motor fuel in Canada for over 20 years. With assistance from federal and provincial research programs, demonstration projects, and NGV market deployment programs during the 1980s and 1990s, the population of light-duty NGVs grew to over 35,000 by the early 1990s. This assistance resulted in a significant adoption of natural gas transit buses as well. The NGV market started to decline after 1995, eventually reaching today&#x27;s vehicle population of about 12,000.

This figure includes 150 urban transit buses, 45 school buses, 9,450 light-duty cars and trucks, and 2,400 forklifts and ice-resurfacers. The total fuel use in all NGV markets in Canada was 1.9 petajoules (PJs) in 2007 (or 54.6 million liters of gasoline liters equivalent), down from 2.6 PJs in 1997. Public CNG refueling stations have declined in numbers from 
134 in 1997 to 72 today. There are 22 in British Columbia, 12 in Alberta, 10 in Saskatchewan, 27 in 
Ontario, and 1 in Québec. There are only 12 private fleet stations.

====United States====
As of December 2009, the U.S. had a fleet of 114,270 compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles, 147,030 vehicles running on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and 3,176 vehicles running on liquefied natural gas (LNG). The NGV fleet is made up mostly of transit buses, but there are also some government fleet cars and vans, as well as an increasing number of corporate trucks replacing diesel versions, most notably Waste Management, Inc and UPS trucks. As of 12-Dec-2013, Waste Management has a fleet of 2000 CNG Collection trucks; as of 12-Dec-2013, UPS has 2700 alternative fuel vehicles. As of February 2011, there were 873 CNG refueling sites, 2,589 LPG sites, and 40 LNG sites, led by California with 215 CNG refueling stations in operation, 228 LPG sites and 32 LNG sites. The number of refueling stations includes public and private sites; not all are available to the public. As of December 2010, the U.S. ranked sixth in the world in terms of number of NGV stations. Currently, there are 160,000 NGVs operating in the country.

====Mexico====

The natural gas vehicle market is limited to fleet vehicles and other public use vehicles like minibuses in larger cities. However, the state-owned bus company RTP Of Mexico City has purchased 30 Hyundai Super Aero City CNG-Propelled buses to integrate with the existing fleet as well as to introduce new routes within the city.

===South America===
====Overview====
CNG vehicles are common in South America, with a 35% share of the worldwide NGV fleet, where these vehicles are mainly used as taxicabs in main cities of Argentina and Brazil. Normally, standard gasoline vehicles are retrofitted in specialized shops, which involve installing the gas cylinder in the trunk, the CNG injection system, and electronics.

As of 2009 Argentina had 1,807,186 NGVs with 1,851 refueling stations across the nation, or 15% of all vehicles; and Brazil had 1,632,101 vehicles and 1,704 refueling stations, with a higher concentration in the cities of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.

Colombia had an NGV fleet of 300,000 vehicles, and 460 refueling stations as of 2009. Bolivia has increased its fleet from 10,000 in 2003 to 121,908 units in 2009, with 128 refueling stations.

Peru had 81,024 NGVs and 94 fueling stations as 2009. In Peru, several factory-built CNVs have tanks installed under the vehicle&#x27;s body, leaving the trunk free. Among the models built with this feature are the Fiat Multipla, the new Fiat Panda, the Volkswagen Touran Ecofuel, the Volkswagen Caddy Ecofuel, and the Chevy Taxi. Right now, Peru has 224,035 NGVs.

Other countries with significant NGV fleets are Venezuela (226,100) as of 2017 and Chile (15,000) as of 2017.

====Latest developments====
GM do Brasil introduced the MultiPower engine in August 2004 which was capable of using CNG, alcohol and gasoline as fuel. The GM engine has electronic fuel injection that automatically adjusts to any acceptable fuel configuration. This motor was used in the Chevrolet Astra and was aimed at the taxi market.

In 2006 the Brazilian subsidiary of Fiat introduced the Fiat Siena Tetra fuel, a four-fuel car developed under Magneti Marelli of Fiat Brazil. This automobile can run on 100% ethanol (), blend (Brazil&#x27;s normal ethanol gasoline blend), pure gasoline (not available in Brazil), and natural gas, and switches from the gasoline-ethanol blend to CNG automatically, depending on the power required by road conditions.

Since 2003 and with the commercial success of flex cars in Brazil, another existing option is to retrofit an ethanol flexible-fuel vehicle to add a natural gas tank and the corresponding injection system. Some taxicabs in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, run on this option, allowing the user to choose among three fuels (E25, E100 and CNG) according to the current market prices at the pump. Vehicles with this adaptation are known in Brazil as tri-fuel cars.

===South Asia===

====India====

In 1993, CNG had become available in Delhi, India&#x27;s capital, though LPG became predominantly used due to its lower capital costs. Compressed Natural Gas is a domestic energy produced in Western parts of India. In India, most CNG vehicles are dual-fuelled, which means they can run both on CNG and petrol. This makes it very convenient, and users can drive long distances without worrying about the availability of natural gas (as long as petrol is available). As of December 2010, India had 1,080,000 NGVs and 560 fueling stations, many of the older ones being LPG rather than CNG. In addition, it is thought that more illegally converted LPG autos than legal ones ply the streets in India, some estimates are as high as 15 million &quot;autos&quot; (running the gamut of everything from LPG motored pedal bicycles to CNG buses)

In 1995, a lawyer filed a case with the Supreme Court of India under the Public Interest Litigation rule, which is part of the Constitution of India and enables any citizen to address the Supreme Court directly. The lawyer&#x27;s case was about the health risks caused by air pollution emitted from road vehicles. The Supreme Court decided that cars in circulation after 1995 would have to run on unleaded fuel. By 1998, India was converted to 100% of unleaded fuel after the government ruled that diesel cars in India were restricted to 10,000 ppm after 1995. At the beginning of 2005, 10,300 CNG busses, 55,000 CNG three-wheeler taxis, 5,000 CNG minibuses, 10,000 CNG taxis and 10,000 CNG cars ran on India&#x27;s roads (1982-2008 Product-Life Institute, Geneva). The Delhi Transport Corporation currently operates the world&#x27;s largest fleet of CNG buses for public transport. Currently India stands third with 3.045 million NGVs.

====Iran====
By the end of 2015, Iran had the world&#x27;s largest fleet of NGV at 3.5 million vehicles. The share of compressed natural gas in the national fuel basket is more than 23%. CNG consumption by Iran&#x27;s transportation sector is around 20 million cubic meters per day. There are 2,335 CNG stations. The growth of NGV market in Iran has in large part been due to Iranian government intervention to decrease the society&#x27;s dependence on gasoline. This governmental plan was implemented to reduce the effect of sanctions on Iran and make the nation&#x27;s domestic market less dependent on imported gasoline. Iran has been manufacturing its own NGVs through local manufacturing using dedicated CNG engines which use gasoline only as a backup fuel. Also by 2012, Iranian manufacturers had the capacity to build 1.5 million CNG cylinders per year and therefore Iranian government has banned their imports to support the local manufacturers. In addition CNG in Iran costs the least compared to the rest of the world. In 2012, the Iranian government announced a plan to replace the traditional CNG cylinders with Adsorbed Natural Gas (ANG) cylinders.

====Pakistan====
Pakistan was the country with the second largest fleet of NGV with a total of 2.85 million by the end of 2011. Most of the public transportation fleet has been converted to CNG. Also, in Pakistan and India, there have been on-going (last several years now) series of CNG fuel shortages which periodically waxes and wanes, getting the fuel into a tank can be a major problem. In July 2011, petrol usage shot up 15% from the month before due to shortages. Pakistan also has reported that over 2,000 people have died in 2011 from CNG cylinder blasts, because of low quality of cylinders there. In 2012, the Pakistani government decided to gradually phase out the CNG sector, beginning by banning any new conversions to CNG and banning the manufacturing of new NGVs. In addition, the government plans to close down all refueling stations in the next three years.

===Southeast Asia===

====Thailand====
Thailand has for over a 15 years run autogas taxi cabs in Bangkok, though autos and buses had erroneously labelled NGV stickers on them, when in fact, were LPG fuelled.

Given a generous natural gas supply but relying on imported oil, the Thailand government heavily promoted alternative fuels like LPG, natural gas and ethanol to replace gasoline beginning around 2003. Yet, NGV was very slow to take off due to cheaper LPG fuel, a pre-existing LPG fleet, and the low conversion cost of local LPG conversion shops compared to factory-installed CNG or conversion. A significant effort was made when the state-controlled oil company PTT PCL built a network of natural gas refueling stations. The cost of subsidy was estimated at US$150 million in 2008.

As the price of oil climbed rapidly, it was estimated more than 40,000 new cars and trucks powered by natural gas were purchased in six months in 2008, including many buses. That year, about half of the taxi fleet in Bangkok used LPG and was prodded to convert to CNG, with little success. Since 2008, there has been government arm-twisting to switch from LPG to CNG, with a rollout of CNG stations near Bangkok around 2007 and then upcountry in 2010, at times replacing LPG stations. Operators of used vehicles have balked at the massive conversion cost (up to quadruple that of LPG in Thailand), especially given Thailand&#x27;s strong ultra-competitive domestic LPG conversion industry and retail CNG fuel cost (one and a half times). Thailand had some 700,000 LPG-fueled vehicles and 300,000 CNG fueled, with 1,000 LPG stations and 600 CNG as of 2011. Demand has increased 26% over 2011 for CNG in Thailand. As of the end of 2012, Thailand has 1,014,000 LPG fueled vehicles, and consumed 606,000 tonnes in 2012 of LPG, while 483 stations serve up some 380,000 CNG vehicles., showing that LPG conversion continues to enjoy heavy favor over NGVs despite a massive government push for CNG. CNG vehicles are more likely to be bought factory installed, while LPG is likely to be an aftermarket conversion. LNG vehicles in Thailand are almost non-existent except for lorries.

====Malaysia====
In Malaysia, the use of compressed natural gas was originally introduced for taxicabs and airport limousines during the late 1990s, when new taxis were launched with NGV engines while taxicab operators were encouraged to send in existing taxis for full engine conversions, reducing their costs of operation. Any vehicle converted to use CNG is labelled with white rhombus &quot;NGV&quot; (Natural Gas Vehicle) tags, lending to the common use of &quot;NGV&quot; when referring to road vehicles with CNG engines. The practice of using CNG remained largely confined to taxicabs predominantly in the Klang Valley and Penang due to a lack of interest. No incentives were offered for those besides taxicab owners to use CNG engines. At the same time, government subsidies on petrol and diesel made conventional road vehicles cheaper to use in the eyes of the consumers. Petronas, Malaysia&#x27;s state-owned oil company, also monopolizes the provision of CNG to road users. , Petronas only operates about 150 CNG refueling stations, most of which are concentrated in the Klang Valley. At the same time, another 50 was expected by the end of 2008.

As fuel subsidies were gradually removed in Malaysia starting June 5, 2008, the subsequent 41% price hike on petrol and diesel led to a 500% increase in the number of new CNG tanks installed. National car maker Proton considered fitting its Waja, Saga and Persona models with CNG kits from Prins Autogassystemen by the end of 2008, while a local distributor of locally assembled Hyundai cars offers new models with CNG kits. Conversion centres, which also benefited from the rush for lower running costs, also perform partial conversions to existing road vehicles, allowing them to run on both petrol or diesel and CNG with a cost varying between RM3,500 to RM5,000 for passenger cars.

====Singapore====
There were about 400 CNG-fueled vehicles in Singapore in mid-2007, of which about 110 are taxis operated by Smart Automobile. By February 2008, the number has risen to 520 CNG vehicles, of which about half are taxis. All vehicles had to refuel at the sole CNG station operated by Sembcorp Gas and located on Jurong Island until the opening of the first publicly accessible CNG station at Mandai in 2008, operated by Smart Automobile. The company plans to build another four stations by 2011, by which time the company projects to operate 3,000 to 4,000 CNG taxis, and with 10,000 CNG public and commercial vehicles of other types on Singapore&#x27;s roads. Sembcorp Gas opened its second CNG station a week after the Mandai station at Jalan Buroh.

====Indonesia====
CNG is almost unheard of as a transport fuel before 2010 in the archipelago except in Jakarta, where a very relatively minor number of vehicles, most notably Transjakarta buses, use the fuel. However, since 2010, the government has emphasised using CNG for vehicle fuel and domestic consumption over wood burning (which can produce deadly methanol) and kerosene.

===East Asia===
====China====

China had 450,000 NGVs and 870 refueling stations as of 2009. China in 2012 had 1 million NGVs on the roads, 3 million forecasts for 2015, and over 2000 stations (CNG and LPG), with plans for 12,000 by 2020. Currently, China leads the World with 5 million NGVs China also has a lot of vehicles running of Petrol blended with Methanol as M15 and M85.

====South Korea====
For the purpose of improving air quality in the metropolitan area of Seoul, CNG buses were first introduced in July 1997. By 2014, all Seoul buses were operating on CNG. Hyundai motor developed a CNG hybrid bus with 34.5% more-fuel efficiency and 30% lower pollution compared to CNG buses. As a result, the Seoul city government plans to change to CNG hybrid buses for 2,235 low-bed disabled-friendly CNG buses in Seoul.

CNG buses are operating in other major South Korean cities like Busan, Daegu, Daejeon, Gwangju and Incheon.

====Motorsport====

A new category of motorcar racing unites teams which compete with cars powered by natural gas, to demonstrate the effectiveness of natural gas as an alternative fuel. ECOMOTORI (magazine) Racing Team The magazine&#x27;s team participates in the FIA Alternative Energies Cup and the Italian ACI/CSAI Alternative Energies Championship. In 2012, the team, led by Nicola Ventura, competed with a Fiat 500 Abarth, modified to run on natural gas with a Cavagna/Bigas fuel conversion kit and thus renamed &quot;500 EcoAbarth&quot;. The driver is Massimo Liverani while in the role of navigator, alternate Valeria Strada, Alessandro Talmelli and Fulvio Ciervo. On October 14, 2012, at the end of the seventh Ecorally San Marino-Vatican, with three wins and second place (out of four races), the Team also won the Italian CSAI Alternative Energy Pilots and Navigators titles. On 28 October 2012, after having raced in seven European countries, collecting three wins, two second places and additional points, the team won the FIA Alternative Energies Drivers and Constructors world titles. For the first time, a methane-powered car won an FIA world title. In 2013, the team raced in the FIA Alternative Energies Cup and CSAI Championships. The &quot;500 Eco barth&quot; dominated the season, winning five out of five titles. Thanks to the team&#x27;s work, the Abarth once again won a constructors&#x27; title since its last win 46 years ago.

<text>Žemyna (also Žemynėlė or Žemelė) (from – &quot;earth&quot;) is the goddess of the earth in Lithuanian religion. She is usually regarded as mother goddess and one of the chief Lithuanian gods similar to Latvian Zemes māte. Žemyna personifies the fertile earth and nourishes all life on earth, human, plant, and animal. All that is born of earth will return to earth, thus her cult is also related to death. As the cult diminished after baptism of Lithuania, Žemyna&#x27;s image and functions became influenced by the cult of Virgin Mary.

== Name ==
Žemyna stems from the name of Proto-Indo-European Earth-goddess &quot;*Dʰéǵʰōm&quot;. It relates to Thracian &quot;Zemele&quot; (&#x27;mother earth&#x27;) and Greek &quot;Semelē&quot; ().

== Role ==
Žemyna was first mentioned by Jan Łasicki (1582). It was later also described by Mikalojus Daukša (1595), Daniel Klein (1653), Matthäus Prätorius, Jacob Brodowski (1740), and in numerous folk legends, beliefs, and prayers. Prätorius described a ritual, called &quot;žemyneliauti&quot;, performed at major celebrations (e.g. weddings) or agricultural works (e.g. harvest). The head of the household would drink a cup of beer, but first, he would spill some of the drink on the ground and say a short prayer. Then he would kill a rooster or a hen, which would be cooked and eaten by the entire family. Each family member would receive a loaf of bread and say prayers, blessings, and greetings. The bones and other scraps would be sacrificed to the goddess (burned or buried). Other recorded rites included burying bread baked from last crops of prior harvest in a field before new sowing and sacrifice of a black piglet. People would also kiss the earth saying a short prayer thanking Žemyna for all her gifts and acknowledging that one day they will return to her. People addressed Žemyna in various affectionate diminutive names and epithets.

In addition, historical sources on Baltic mythology describe the dual role of goddess Zemyna: while she was connected to the fertility of the land, she was also associated with receiving the dead and acting as their ruler and guardian. Pieces of Lithuanian folklore also make references to Earth as mother of humans and their final abode after death.

===Family===
The goddess is said to be married to either Perkūnas (thunder god) or Praamžius (manifestation of chief heavenly god Dievas). Thus the couple formed the typical Indo-European pair of mother-earth and father-sky. It was believed that the earth needs to be fertilized by the heavens (rain and thunder). Thus it was prohibited to plow or sow before the first thunder as the earth would be barren.

==In modern culture==
The Lithuanian folk music group Kūlgrinda in collaboration with Donis released an album in 2013 titled &quot;Giesmės Žemynai&quot;, meaning &quot;Hymns to Žemyna&quot;.

==Related male deities==
Other characters in Lithuanian mythology are related, etymologically or semantically, to goddess Žemyna and a cult of the earth, such as &quot;Žemėpatis&quot; (&#x27;Earth Spouse&#x27;) and &quot;Žemininkas&quot;, male deities associated with cattle, agriculture and the fertility of the land. Their names are present in historical records of the Lithuanian non-Christian faith by foreign missionaries.

Another male divinity with the name &quot;Zemeluks&quot;, &quot;Zamoluksei&quot;, &quot;Zameluks&quot; or &quot;Ziameluks&quot; is also said to be attested. An account tells he is a &quot;DEUS TERRAE&quot; (&#x27;earth god&#x27;), while in other he is &quot;a lord or god of earth who was buried in the earth&quot; by the Prussians.

<doc id="1038889" wikidata="Q521917" url="?curid=1038889" title="Fumi-e">
<text>A was a likeness of Jesus or Mary onto which the religious authorities of the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan required suspected Christians (Kirishitan) to step, in order to demonstrate that they were not members of the outlawed religion; otherwise they would be tortured or killed.

==History==

Fumi-e began first to be used against Christians in Nagasaki in 1629. Residents of Nagasaki, whether commoner, Buddhist monk or samurai, were required to tread on the icons which were brought from house to house. Their use was officially abandoned when ports opened to foreigners on 13 April 1856, but some remained in use until Christian teaching was placed under formal protection during the Meiji era. The icons were also known as &quot;e-ita&quot; or &quot;ita-e&quot;, while the forced test was called &quot;e-fumi&quot;.

The Japanese government used the e-fumi to uncover Christians and sympathizers. Fumi-e contained images of the Virgin Mary and Jesus, which government officials ordered all to trample on. Those who were reluctant or refused to do so were arrested for being Christians. The policy of the shogunate was to get them to abjure the faith. If they refused they would be tortured. If they still refused to abjure, they would be killed. Some executions took place at Nagasaki&#x27;s Mount Unzen, where the Christians were boiled in the hot springs.

Execution for Christianity was unofficially abandoned by the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1805.

Eighteenth-century Europe was aware enough of e-fumi for authors of fiction to mention it when alluding to Japan, as in Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1726), Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;The Citizen of the World&quot; (1760), and Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot; (1759). Allegations published in Europe during the late 17th and early 18th century that Dutch traders at Dejima were required to undergo the e-fumi are thought by modern scholars to be propaganda arising from the Anglo-Dutch Wars.

In modern Japanese literature, treading on the fumi-e is a pivotal plot element of the novel &quot;Silence&quot; by Shūsaku Endō and the 2016 film of the same name. 

Christians would sometimes perform the e-fumi yet continue to practice their beliefs secretly (Kakure Kirishitan); there were some 20,000 secret Christians in Japan when Christianity was legalized again, down from 500,000 in Nagasaki at the height of Japanese Christianity before the persecution. University of Auckland professor Mark Mullins concluded that &quot;In that sense, the fumi-e policies were effective.&quot;

==Interpretations==
Many theologians have tried to contemplate the role of the &quot;fumi-e&quot; to Japanese Christians, some seeing the treading of the &quot;fumi-e&quot; as a sign of the love and forgiveness of Jesus Christ.

Nagasaki Junshin Catholic University professor Simon Hull stated that if all of the &quot;fumi-e&quot; participants had instead chosen to be defiant and died, Christianity would not have continued in Japan; he stated &quot;It is only because some made an existential decision to trample on the &quot;fumi-e&quot;... that Christianity in Japan was able to survive.&quot;

==Form==
&quot;Fumi-e&quot; were usually cast from bronze, but others were made of painted stone and some were woodblock prints. There are relatively few surviving &quot;fumi-e&quot;, as most were simply thrown away or recycled for other uses. Some examples were displayed by the Smithsonian in their 2007 exhibition &quot;Encompassing the Globe: Portugal and the World in the 16th and 17th Centuries.&quot;

<text>Jacques-Alexandre Laffon de Ladebat (2 January 1719 – 18 November 1797) was a prominent shipbuilder and merchant of the port of Bordeaux in the late 18th century. His son, André-Daniel Laffon de Ladebat (November 30, 1746 – October 14, 1829), succeeded him, and later became involved in politics. In 1789, he participated in the French Revolution. 

He was born on 2 January 1719 in the Netherlands to Daniel Laffon de Ladébat and Jeanne Nairac. His family, being Protestant, had fled to the Netherlands following revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685).

Following the death of Louis XIV, Ladébat was able to return to France without fear of religious persecution. There, he and his brother established a business as wine merchants and maritime traders through the network of correspondents that they had developed in the Netherlands.

In 1755, Ladébat began to trade in the colonies of the French West Indies and, from 1764, this included the slave trade. In 1769, it is speculated that he was no longer content to trade in naval weapons and wine, he created a sugar plantation in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, and began clearing and cultivating land in Bordeaux by buying several hundred acres straddling Pessac and Merignac. He built a model farm called &quot;Bellevue,&quot; which produced grain, flour, wine, lumber, silkworms and trained farm hands.

He was ennobled and granted a coat-of-arms in 1773 for his economic successes. His grant of arms symbolized his areas of success: &quot;Azure, a gushing fountain of money surmounted by a golden sun with two anchors.&quot; The motto &quot;Soyez Utile&quot; accompanied the arms.

<doc id="1038969" wikidata="Q7967461" url="?curid=1038969" title="Wang Hsing-ching">
<text>Wang Hsing-ching (; born 1946), who has a pseudonym of Nanfang Shuo (南方朔, Nánfāng Shuò), is a journalist, political commentator, and cultural critic. Currently, he is the chief editor and writer of &quot;The Journalist&quot; magazine (新新聞週刊), with commentaries on current issues in major newspapers. He co-founded &quot;The Journalist&quot; when he was in his 40s. His writings, including Western ideas analysis, social phenomena criticism, and literature comments, are all regarded as very influential. Crediting his intellectual contribution to the society, he is known as &quot;the most industrious private scholar in Taiwan&quot;.

== Background ==
Wang earned his undergraduate degree in the School for Forestry and Resource Conservation, from National Taiwan University and a doctorate degree in Chinese Culture University. The Senkaku (Diaoyutai) Island incident made Wang reach an epiphany to become a journalist. During that period, Wang abandoned his overseas study plan and stayed in Taiwan, starting his career. His first journalist job was at the Taiwanese newspaper &quot;National Evening News&quot; (). In the 1970s, Wang was a reporter for the &quot;Taiwan Times,&quot; and afterwards worked as a writer, vice general editor, and general editor in &quot;The China Times&quot; (中國時報). Although he never received technical university training in journalism, he has more than twenty years of experience in the mass media as a news commentator.

== Style and major themes of writing ==
Wang, as an author, began with topics mainly concerned about cultural changes, political changes, and the controversies in society. His early works are based on the themes of describing and criticizing cultures and politics, e.g. &quot;Diguo zhuyi yu Taiwan duli yundong&quot; (帝國主義與臺灣獨立運動). Later in his career, he started publishing critical book reviews. Recently, Wang has published a series of books about &quot;Language&quot;. &quot;Magical Eyes,&quot; his latest book, (魔幻之眼) is his first published work in the book commentary collection. As a tutor through writing, his analysis focuses on culture, history, thoughts, politics, etc.

== Contributions to journalism ==
Wang has never been shy expressing his critical opinions on current affairs. In the summer of 2004, he attended a forum in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center concerning the political issues in Taiwan and the relation across the Taiwan Strait after the presidential election. He suggested that the two shores of the Strait should make positive interactions in order to solve the rational problems.

As a journalist and the chief writer of &quot;The Journalist magazine&quot;, he has his own independent analysis towards the political issues. Not long after President Chen Shuibien gave the speech of &quot;One State on Each Side&quot;, he wrote critics on it, which was exactly to the point, &quot;democracy in Taiwan is already moving towards a new and populist type of soft politics of terror&quot;.

== Views on journalism ==
In a public discussion titled &quot;How to build a mass media culture with &quot;taste&quot;? Wang criticized the current mass media culture. He pointed out that if the speakers/interviewees could not state their stance clearly, they had to &quot;pay the price&quot; in the sense that reporters might make twist their words to make a story more dramatic. The unethical reporting of some journalists disappointed Wang, and he urged that journalists had to realize that it was shameful to have disregarded the obligation to report the truth.

At societal level, he emphasized that not only does the mass media deliver information to the public, but it also affects the social structure and the political environment. He noted that journalists should bear in mind that they have great responsibilities to the general public.

Particularly in Taiwan, he put the blame of the current situation on changes in political conditions. During this unstable period, different types of mass media emerged. As advertising plays a greater role in the mass media, it is inevitable that politicians would make use of the mass media for propaganda. However, he said that there are still journalists who stand by their principles, although it remains difficult for them to uphold the journalistic ethics.

== Seeing literature as journalism ==
In an RTHK TV program &quot;Merry Book Worm&quot; in October 2003, (愈讀愈快樂 (www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/tv/bookworm/20031026.html inactive as of 2008-05-07), 5 Oct 04.) Wang shared his opinions on how to choose suitable books for ourselves. He raised questions on how topics of certain discourses are set, why the topics are written the way they are, and how the written formats differ from author to author, and suggested that these are the aspects we have to think about when we choose books to read. Also, Wang stressed that it is necessary for every author to get the basic and wide-ranging knowledge on different areas before having any discussion or analysis. With his literature commentaries in &quot;Magical Eyes&quot; (魔幻之眼), Nanfang Shuo attempts to give his readers a brief overview on his recommended books to help them choose readings.

Wang&#x27;s views on literature ties in well in the principles in journalism. While literature commenting allows his audience to have a knowledge of what is currently happening in the world, reporters are also doing the same thing: making readers be aware of current affairs. Speaking about journalism, he said that we, as readers, have to be careful about different reporters&#x27; stances and their different perspectives based on various sources. On the other hand, reporters should always bear the obligation to the truth and be objective by relying on the more reliable sources.

In another interview from Central News Agency (news.pchome.com.tw/life/can/20030408/index-20030408165736010244.html inactive as of 2008-05-07) in Taiwan, Wang pointed out that readers are not encouraged to spend too much time on books which are too difficult to be digested or too easy to read. In the interview, Wang encouraged readers to find the books which would motivate them and those which can give them new perspectives.
Applying Wang&#x27;s views on reading, journalism, and news reports, readers should focus their attention on news of particular interest to them, ones which they feel comfortable to read and criticize. Moreover, Wang believes that readers are responsible for the verification of reports.

==Views on reading==
As a commentator of literature, Wang welcomes all different genres of books. He firmly believes that all books can be beneficial and that the more one reads, the more one will gain in that field of expertise. He recalled that in his childhood, he was unable to do anything but read.

One belief of Wang is that wisdom in different aspects are all inter-related. For him, the concepts of literature, history, and social theory can be easily understood. He believes that literature, poetry, politics, and philosophy are mutually related. Having this understanding, Wang likes to use poems to interpret international politics and the economic phenomenon in recent years. This proves that as a commentator of current affairs and as chief writer of &quot;The Journalist&quot;, he uses literary style to write journalistic articles.

A few years ago, Wang discovered an interest in linguistics. Some of the inspirations of Wang stems from the Chinese classic literature, novels, and prose, while some of them comes from news reports. Researching the origin and history of the common vocabularies, he also investigated the changing process of these vocabularies in society. To him, this changing process can be seen from the use of language in news reports, for the language the reporters used marks the changes in social value.
In fact, his motivation and his way to learn about the origins of vocabulary is very applicable to the elements of journalism: both fields require accurate information, and verification by different reliable sources. We can only tell the truth (of events or the origin of vocabularies) after verifications.

Wang is a libertarian, and he believes that it is important to be aware of the language ambiguity in understanding readings. As there are some writers who easily confuse readers, with or without intention, great language skills and a critical mind are essential to make yourself clear about what you are reading and what the writers are telling.

== Comments on literature ==
Wang was one of the committee members to adjudicate the &quot;20th century 100 greatest Chinese novels&quot;. As the novels revealed to Wang a feeling of sorrow and a sense of pressure, he commented the 20th century Chinese novels as a reflection of Chinese history in the past 100 years which he saw a difficult and suffering period for the intellectuals.

<text>Ivan Janša (; born 17 September 1958), baptized and best known as Janez Janša (), is a Slovenian politician who served three times as a prime minister of Slovenia, a position he had held from 2004 to 2008, from 2012 to 2013, and from 2020 to 2022. Since 1993, Janša has led the Slovenian Democratic Party, which has emerged as the pre-eminent Slovenian conservative party. Janša lost his fourth bid for prime minister in April 2022, his party was defeated by the Freedom Movement party.

Janša served as a minister of defence from 1990 to 1994, a post he had also held during the Slovenian War of Independence. He has also served as a prime minister from 2004 to 2008, and again became prime minister in 2012, following an early election in December 2011. On 27 February 2013, Janša&#x27;s second government was ousted in a vote of non-confidence. In June 2013, Janša was sentenced to two years in prison on corruption charges. The ruling was confirmed by Slovenia&#x27;s higher court in April 2014, but after the Constitutional Court of Slovenia ordered a retrial for procedural reasons, the case later expired. Despite his party winning a plurality of votes in the 2018 Slovenian parliamentary election, Janša was initially passed over as a prime minister candidate as most parties refused to join a Janša-led government because of Janša&#x27;s extremist views. After spending years in opposition, Janša was selected as prime minister-designate in March 2020 following the resignation of prime minister Marjan Šarec. His third term as a prime minister ended on 13 May 2022.

A communist in his youth, Janša&#x27;s political stance has drifted rightward during the course of his political career, from a liberal, pro-democracy dissident under communist rule, to a social democrat politician, and to a right-wing hardliner. Janša was described as a far-right leader by &quot;The Independent&quot; and by &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; in 2020. His style of politics has been compared to Donald Trump. He has been dubbed a &quot;MAGA-style populist&quot; by NPR, &quot;the Slovenian Trump&quot; by &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, and &quot;mini-Trump&quot; by Deutsche Welle. Following the 2020 United States presidential election, Janša declared Trump the winner, and proceeded to tweet a series of conspiracy theories about the election. Janša is a close ally of Hungary&#x27;s prime minister Viktor Orbán.

==Youth and education==
Janša was born to a Roman Catholic working-class family of Grosuplje. He was called &quot;Janez&quot; (a version of the name &quot;Ivan&quot;; both are &quot;John&quot; in English) since childhood. His father was a member of the Slovene Home Guard from Dobrova near Ljubljana who had escaped communist retaliation due to his young age.

Janša graduated from the Faculty of Sociology, Political Science, and Journalism of the University of Ljubljana with a degree in Defence Studies in 1982, and became employed in the Defence Secretariate of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia.

In 1975, aged 17, Janša joined the League of Communists, and became one of the leaders of its youth wing. He became president of the Committee for Basic People&#x27;s Defence and Social Self-Protection of the (ZSMS). Janša was expelled from the party in 1983 after breaking with Yugoslav military orthodoxy by criticizing the system of people&#x27;s self-defense from a radical left perspective. Janša appealed his ouster, but his appeal was denied. Despite the ejection, Janša touted his work in the party in a resume while applying for a job as newspaper editor in 1985.

==Dissident==
In 1983, Janša wrote the first of his dissident articles about the nature of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA). In the late 1980s, as Slovenia was introducing democratic reforms and gradually lifting restrictions on freedom of speech, Janša wrote several articles criticising the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army in &quot;Mladina&quot; magazine (published by the League of Socialist Youth of Slovenia). As a result, his re-election as president of the Committee was blocked in 1984, and in 1985 his passport was withdrawn. During this period, Janša and his associates were held under closer watch by the Yugoslav secret police. Janša was also barred from gaining employment in any state institution or state-owned company. Between 1985 and 1986, he made over 250 job applications without success despite meeting all qualifications. He was also unable to publish articles. During this period he earned his living writing computer programs and as a chance mountaineering guide.

Liberalization in the succeeding years allowed him to get work as secretary of the Journal for the Criticism of Science in 1986, and, a year later, to again begin publishing in Mladina. His Mladina articles consisted of critical opinion columns and articles on the topic of democracy and national sovereignty.

In the mid-1980s, Janša was employed in the Slovenian software company &quot;Mikrohit&quot;; in the years 1986 and 1987, Janša founded, together with his friend Igor Omerza (later high-ranking politician of the Slovenian Democratic Union and the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia), his own software company &quot;Mikro Ada&quot;.

He became involved in the pacifist movement, and emerged as an important activist in the network of civil society organizations in Slovenia. By the mid-1980s, he was one of the most prominent activist of the Slovenian pacifist movement. Janša also became active in the nascent environmental movement.

===Rapprochement with the Socialist Youth movement===
In 1987, Janša was approached by the family of the late politician Stane Kavčič, who had been the most important exponent of the reformist fraction in the Slovenian Communist Party in the late 1960s, and prime minister of Slovenia between 1967 and 1972; he was asked to edit the manuscript of Kavčič&#x27;s diaries. Janša edited the volume together with Igor Bavčar. The publication of the book was part of the political project of Niko Kavčič, former banker and prominent member of the reformist wing of the Communist Party, to establish a new Slovenian left wing political formation that would challenge the hardliners within the Communist Party.

In the spring of 1988, Janša ran for president of the , a semi-independent youth organization of the Communist Party, which had been open, since 1986, also to non-party members. In his program, Janša proposed that the organization become independent of the Communist Party and transform itself into an association of all youth and civic associations; he also proposed that it rename itself the &quot;League of Youth Organizations and Movements&quot;, and that it assume the role of the main civil society platform in Slovenia. During that time, he also participated in the public discussions on the constitutional changes of Yugoslav and Slovenian constitution.

===Arrest and trial===
On 31 May 1988, Janša was arrested on suspicion of possessing a classified Yugoslav military document uncovered during a search on the premises of a company where Janša was employed (a staff sergeant of the Yugoslav Army, Ivan Borštner, was arrested the same day on suspicion of leaking the document to Mladina). Along with two Mladina journalists, they were tried by a military court on charges of exposing military secrets, and given prison sentences. Janša&#x27;s trial was conducted &quot;in camera&quot;, with no legal representation for the accused, and in Serbo-Croatian (the official language of the Yugoslav Army) rather than in Slovene.

Janša was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, initially at Dob, but, following public outcry, he was transferred to the open prison in Ig. The case became known as the JBTZ affair and triggered mass protests against the government, and accelerated the process of democratization, known as the Slovenian Spring. The Committee for the Defence of Human Rights was formed following Janša&#x27;s arrest, which became the largest grassroots civil society organization in Slovenia, gaining over 100,000 members within weeks.

Janša later accused Milan Kučan, the then-leader of SR Slovenia, of having accepted the Yugoslav Army&#x27;s request for the arrest. Kučan, under pressure from the Yugoslav federal authorities, did in fact acquiesce to the searches that led to the subsequent arrests. Niko Kavčič, who was at that time considered Janša&#x27;s political mentor, believed the arrest was organized by the hardliners within the Slovenian Communist Party who were angered by the publication of Stane Kavčič&#x27;s diaries and wanted to prevent the formation of an alternative reformist movement.

The philosopher Slavoj Žižek, who at the time also worked as a columnist for &quot;Mladina&quot;, suggested that Janša was arrested because of his critical articles on the Yugoslav Army, and because the army wanted to prevent his election as president of the League of the Socialist Youth of Slovenia. As a consequence of his arrest, he could not run for the position; nevertheless, the leadership of the organization decided to carry on with the elections despite Janša&#x27;s arrest. In June 1988, Jožef Školč was elected as president of the League instead of Janša.

As a protest against the League of the Socialist Youth of Slovenia&#x27;s decision not to postpone the elections, Janša&#x27;s broke all relations with the organization. Janša was released after serving about six months of sentence, and became editor-in-chief of the Slovene political weekly magazine &quot;Demokracija&quot; (Democracy) shortly after his release, a position he held until May 1990, having been elected to parliament the previous month.

==Political career==
===1990–1994: Foray into politics, minister of defence===
In 1989, Janša was involved in the founding of one of the first opposition parties in Slovenia, the Slovenian Democratic Union (SDZ) and became its first vice-president, and later president of the Party Council. Following the first free elections in May 1990 he became the minister of defence in Lojze Peterle&#x27;s cabinet, a position he held during the Slovenian war for independence in June and July 1991. Together with the Minister of Interior Igor Bavčar, Janša was the main organizer of Slovenia&#x27;s strategy against the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army.

In 1992, when the Slovenian Democratic Union broke into a liberal and a conservative wing, the leaders of the liberal fraction wanted to propose Janša as the compromise president of the party, but he refused the offer. After the party&#x27;s final breakdown, he joined the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia (now called Slovenian Democratic Party) and remained Defence Minister in the center-left coalition government of Janez Drnovšek until March 1994. In May 1993, he was elected president of the Social Democratic Party of Slovenia, a position he has held ever since.

====Controversies and dismissal from ministerial post====
Janša has been accused of having abused his position as defense minister to consolidate political power, engaging in arms trafficking to arm combatants in the Yugoslav Wars in violation of a United Nations arms embargo, and blackmailing prominent individuals, including politicians, businesspeople, journalists, and cultural and literary figures, by threatening to make public information (to which he was privy to in his ministerial role) regarding their previously undisclosed involvement with the former communist secret police.

In 1994, Janez Janša was dismissed by Prime Minister Janez Drnovšek from his role as Defence Minister because of his involvement in the Depala Vas affair (which centered around an incident in which military personnel arrested and mistreated a civilian off-duty undercover police associate that was attempting to obtain classified documents about the Ministry of Defence). SDS subsequently left the Drnovšek government as a result. The dismissal prompted protests by Janša&#x27;s supporters and there were founded fears inside the government that Janša, backed by the nascent military, may refuse to relinquish power. A 2003 Mladina article alleged that Slovenia&#x27;s military&#x27;s special unit (MORiS) was in 1994 performing military exercises intended to prepare the force to carry out a military coup d&#x27;état. The police force was at the same time covertly preparing to secure the state and prevent a military takeover. In a press conference shortly prior to the article&#x27;s publication, Janša pointed to documents detailing these police plans to secure state institutions to argue that a coup was in fact afoot against his Ministry. In a 1999 interview with Delo, Janša commented on the events of 1994, saying: &quot;I held immense power in my hands. [...] And in 1994, when they were deposing me, there was a lot of suggestions that we not accept this removal. I could have done that. But I didn&#x27;t.&quot; In 1995, Janša was charged for alleged illegal arms trafficking, but the case was never brought to trial.

===1994–2004: In opposition===
In 1996 parliamentary elections Janša&#x27;s party&#x27;s vote share rose significantly, from around 3.5% in the previous election to over 16%, becoming the third largest political party in the parliament and mounting an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to form a governing coalition. SDS largely remained in opposition for until 2004 years, save for a brief period in 2000 when it entered a short-lived centre-right government led by Andrej Bajuk,

During his time in opposition, Janša supported the government&#x27;s efforts for the integration into EU and NATO. Between 2002 and 2004, he re-established cordial relations with now-President Drnovšek: in 2003, Drnovšek headed a round table on Slovenia&#x27;s future based on Janša&#x27;s recommendations.

====Criticism as extremist====
During this time, Janša was frequently accused of political extremism and radical discourse. Janša&#x27;s former friend and fellow dissident Spomenka Hribar argues that his campaigns seem like conspiracy theories, and emphasize emotion, especially patriotic fervor, over rationality. The post-Marxist sociologist Rudi Rizman describes Janša&#x27;s rhetoric as radical populism, close to demagoguery. The notion of &quot;Udbo-Mafija&quot;, a term coined by the architect Edo Ravnikar to denote the illegitimate structural connections between the post-communist elites, is particularly prevalent in Janša&#x27;s thought. Most critics agree that Janša is similar to other European radical right-wing populist leaders. Janša&#x27;s rhetoric is nationalist and xenophobic, including verbal attacks against foreigners, especially from the other former-Yugoslav states, and &quot;communists&quot;. Hribar considers these elements a form of extreme nationalism and chauvinism; to her, his irredentist claims towards Croatia seem obvious neo-fascism.

The sociologist Frane Adam instead explains Janša as the product of culture wars between the old communist elites and the hitherto disenfranchised elites of the right wing. The writer Drago Jančar similarly interprets the animosity against Janša as unjustified reactions of a culture unused to conservative political discourse.

Ahead of the 2004 electoral campaign, Janša turned towards moderation, tempering his radical language and attacks against alleged communists. Still, some critics continued to point out nationalistic rhetoric against immigrants.

===2004–2008: First term as prime minister===

Janša was prime minister of Slovenia for the first time from November 2004 to November 2008. During the term characterized by over-enthusiasm after joining EU, between 2005 and 2008 the Slovenian banks have seen loan-deposit ratio veering out of control, over-borrowing from foreign banks and then over-crediting private sector, leading to its unsustainable growth.

It was also for the first time after 1992 that the president and the prime minister had represented opposing political factions for more than a few months. The relationship between Drnovšek and the government quickly became tense. After the landslide victory of the opposition candidate Danilo Türk in the 2007 presidential election, Janša filed a Motion of Confidence in the government on 15 November 2007, stating that the opposition&#x27;s criticism was interfering with the government&#x27;s work during Slovenia&#x27;s presidency over the European Union. The government won the vote, held on 19 November, with 51 votes supporting it and 33 opposing it.

In the beginning of December 2011, several clips of the recordings of closed sessions of the Government of Slovenia during the term of Janez Janša were published on the video-sharing website YouTube.

Allegations were made against Janez Janša that he tried to subordinate Slovenian media. On 1 September 2008, some three weeks before the Slovenian parliamentary elections, allegations were made in Finnish TV in a documentary broadcast by the Finnish national broadcasting company YLE that Janša had received bribes from the Finnish defense company Patria (73.2% of which is the property of the Finnish government) in the so-called Patria case. Janša rejected all accusations as a media conspiracy concocted by left-wing Slovenian journalists, and demanded YLE to provide evidence or to retract the story. Janša&#x27;s naming of individual journalists, including some of those behind the 2007 Petition Against Political Pressure on Slovenian Journalists, and the perceived use of diplomatic channels in an attempt to coerce the Finnish government into interfering with YLE editorial policy, drew criticism from media freedom organizations, such as the International Press Institute and European branch of International Federation of Journalists whose representative, Aidan White, IFJ general secretary, said &quot;The (Janša&#x27;s) government is distorting the facts, failing to tell Slovenians the truth and trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the European public about its attitude to media&quot;.

===2008–2011: In opposition=== 

In the November 2008 parliamentary election, Janša&#x27;s party placed second. Janša was replaced as prime minister by Borut Pahor, leader of Social Democrats.

In December 2011 Janša&#x27;s party won the second place in the Slovenian parliamentary elections. Since the prime minister-designate of the first-placed party, Positive Slovenia, Zoran Janković failed to secure himself enough votes in the National Assembly, and Danilo Türk, the president of Slovenia, declined to propose Janša as prime minister because Janša had been charged in the Patria bribery case, Janša was proposed as prime minister by the coalition of the parties SDS, SLS, DeSUS, NSi, and the newly formed Gregor Virant&#x27;s Civic List on 25 January 2012. On 28 January he became prime minister-designate. His cabinet was confirmed on 10 February, and Janša became the new prime minister with a handover from Pahor on the same day. On 13 February the President received the new Government and wished them luck. Both parties agreed that good cooperation is crucial for success.

===2012–2013: Second term as prime minister===

During his second term as prime minister, which lasted only one year, Janez Janša responded to the weakening of Slovenian economy during the global economic crisis and European sovereign-debt crisis with opening up old ideological fronts against liberal media, and against public sector – especially educational and cultural sectors, accusing them of being under influence of members of old regime (called Udbomafia and &quot;Uncles from Behind the Scenes&quot; (In Slovene: &quot;strici iz ozadja&quot;)) and against everyone who doubted that austerity measures forced upon Slovenia are right ones.

Slovenian political elites faced the 2012–2013 Slovenian protests demanding their resignation.

In January 2013, the &quot;2012–2013 Investigation Report on the parliamentary parties&#x27; leaders&quot; by Commission for the Prevention of Corruption of the Republic of Slovenia revealed that Janez Janša and Zoran Janković systematically and repeatedly violated the law by failing to properly report their assets. It revealed his purchase of one of the real-estate was indirectly co-funded by a construction firm, a major government contractor. It showed that his use of funds in the amount of at least 200.000 EUR, coming from unknown origin, exceeded both his income and savings.

Immediately after the release of the report, Civic List issued an ultimatum to Janša&#x27;s party to find another party member to serve as a new PM. Since Janša was ignoring the report and his party didn&#x27;t offer any replacement for him, all three coalition parties and their leaders left the government within weeks and were subjected to ad hominem attacks by Janez Janša who accused the SLS&#x27;s leader Radovan Žerjav of being &quot;the worst (economics) minister in history of Slovenia&quot;, while the leader of the Civic List Gregor Virant has been mocked by Janša as engaging in &quot;virantovanje&quot; (a word game on kurentovanje, a Slovenian carnival festival). On 27 February 2013, Janša&#x27;s government fell, following a vote of no confidence over allegations of corruption and an unpopular austerity programme in the midst of the country&#x27;s recession. Gregor Virant welcomed the outcome of the vote, stating that it will enable Slovenia to move forward, either to form a new government or to call for an early election. Janša took over Ministry of Finance on 1 February.

===2013–2018: Return to opposition, court trial and imprisonment===
Following the fall of his government, Janša decided not to resume his position as a member of the National Assembly. Instead, he decided to work for his party (SDS), write books, lecture at international institutes and help as a counsellor.

On 5 June 2013, the District Court in Ljubljana ruled that Janša and two others had sought about €2m in commission from a Finnish firm, Patria, to help it win a military supply contract in 2006 (Patria case). Janša was sentenced to two years while Tone Krkovič and Ivan Črnkovič, his co-defendants, were each sentenced to 22 months in prison. All three were also fined €37,000 each. Janša has denied the accusations, claiming the whole process is politically motivated. The following day, the Minister of Justice, Senko Pličanič, emphasised that the court ruling was not yet binding and therefore Janša was still presumed innocent.

Several hundred supporters had rallied outside the court to protest the ruling, while another group of people welcomed the outcome. In his first response, Janša stated he will fight with all available legal and political means to overturn the ruling at the superior court. He has also drawn parallels to the politically motivated JBTZ trial, where he was sentenced to prison 25 years ago. Members of SDS, NSi and SLS, the opposition parties, condemned the ruling. The coalition mostly abstained from comments. Borut Pahor, the president of Slovenia, stressed that the authority of the court should be respected, regardless of personal opinions. The ruling was welcomed by the members of the Protest movement and Goran Klemenčič of the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption of the Republic of Slovenia, who stated that the fight against corruption in Slovenia must continue.

====Imprisonment and release ====
After the Constitutional Court of Slovenia with the majority of votes dismissed Janša&#x27;s appeal due to him not having exhausted every other legal means available to him, on 20 June 2014 Janša started serving his prison term in Dob Prison, the largest Slovene prison. He was escorted there by about 3,000 supporters. The influential German centre-right wing newspaper &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; reported the following day that the domestic Slovene and the international law experts recognised large violations of Janša&#x27;s rights in the court case. The case is to be reviewed by the Supreme Court, but this does not postpone the execution of the sentence that started just three weeks before the parliamentary election. Former constitutional judges criticised the decision of the Constitutional Court for being based on formalities instead of on the content, and commented that a large legal inconsistency in the process was discovered only in front of the Constitutional Court and that it will prevent the Supreme Court from not overturning the judgement. On 12 December 2014 Janša was temporarily released from the prison pending the review of the case by the Constitutional Court. The conviction was unanimously overturned by the Constitutional Court on 23 April 2015.

===2018–2020: Elections, from opposition to government===
In the early election on 3 June 2018, Janez Janša was re-elected as a deputy. He was elected in the electoral district of Grosuplje and received 7,020 votes or 39.3%, the largest share of all candidates in the country. The Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) won the election by receiving 24.92% of votes and gaining 25 seats out of 90 in the National Assembly.

===2020–2022: Third term as prime minister===

Following the resignation of Marjan Šarec as prime minister, Janša was elected as prime minister-designate on 3 March 2020, to form the 14th Government of Slovenia. He was sworn in on 13 March 2020.

On 4 November 2020, the day after the United States presidential election, Janša congratulated Donald Trump on his alleged reelection; he remained the only world leader to have done so when news organizations instead called the election for Joe Biden on 7 November.

Janša described the Fall of Kabul to the Taliban in August 2021 as &quot;the greatest defeat for NATO in history&quot;.

After the start of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, on 15 March 2022, together with Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki, Deputy Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński and Czech prime minister Petr Fiala, Janša went to Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The visit was aimed at supporting Ukraine&#x27;s independence.

Janša&#x27;s third term as a prime minister ended on 13 May 2022. He was officially succeeded by Robert Golob on 1 June 2022.

====Balkan non-papers====
In April 2021, two documents, named the &quot;Balkan non-papers&quot;, which called for the &quot;peaceful dissolution&quot; of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the annexation of parts of Montenegro and North Macedonia into a Greater Serbia and Greater Croatia, as well as the unification of Albania and Kosovo, was said to have been created or distributed by Janša. The story of the non-papers was broken down by Bosnian web portal &quot;politicki.ba&quot; on 12 April 2021. The document&#x27;s plans and ideas were heavily criticized and reacted to by many political leaders from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, Slovenia and as well as by politicians from the European Union and Russia, including Russian minister of foreign affairs Sergey Lavrov and the European Commission&#x27;s Vice-President and EU&#x27;s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell.

Upon the non-papers being sent by Janša, Bosnian Presidency member Šefik Džaferović sent a letter of concern to European Council President Charles Michel. After hearing news about the document, Janša spoke in a telephone call with Džaferović, stating that &quot;there is no non-paper regarding border changes in the Western Balkans&quot; and adding that he supports &quot;the territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&quot;

==Janšism==
Janšism (Slovenian: &quot;Janšizem&quot;) has been defined as &quot;the political orientation developed and advocated by Janez Janša&quot;.

Tino Mamić, writing in &quot;Domovina&quot;, a conservative publication, writes that Janša&#x27;s politics are not unique enough to warrant coining a neologism to describe them, and that the term is being used with the intent of discrediting Janez Janša.

===Use during 2020 anti-government protests===
The term has been used in slogans during the 2020 Slovenian protests to express opposition to the Third Janša Government. Police launched criminal investigations against several protesters after they displayed the slogan &quot;Death to Janšism, freedom to the people&quot; (word play on the Yugoslav Partisan slogan &quot;Death to fascism, freedom to the people&quot;) after Janša had lodged criminal complaints against the protesters, however, the office of the district prosecutor did not recognise the slogans as a death threat against Janša or his supporters (as Janša had claimed). Instead, it determined that the phrase was intended to express opposition to the politics of Janša and/or his political party. In response to the decision, Janša addressed a letter to the state prosecutor general in which he admonished the prosecutor by threatening &quot;you will be held personally responsible for any possible casualty of these organised death threats&quot;. The State Prosecutorial Council labelled the letter as unacceptable political pressure of the highest representative of the executive branch upon the state prosecutor general.

==Controversies==
Janša has served as the leader of SDS ever since 1993 without a single other contender for the post. Party members are extremely loyal to Janša; it has been noted that the party appears to resemble a cult, with numerous past members claiming that Janša leads the party in an authoritarian manner and that no dissent is tolerated. SDS MEP Romana Jordan Cizelj was reportedly the only one within the party leadership to openly voice her doubts about Janša&#x27;s continued leadership of the party whilst serving a prison sentence for corruption. Jordan Cizelj was subsequently not allowed to run for re-election as MEP on the SDS ticket as punishment for her disloyalty to Janša.

Janša is known as a prolific Twitter user, earning him the nickname &quot;Marshal Twitto&quot; (a reference to the honorary military title of (Marshal) Josip Broz Tito), Janša tends to be pugnacious in his interactions on the site, with one commentator describing him as &quot;[...] using social media to insult journalists, political opponents, the general public, and anybody who does not agree with him&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; describing him as &quot;[...] setting the benchmark for intemperate social media messaging by a national leader&quot;. He has also been known to proactively block people he dislikes on the site (including journalists and random users who had never interacted with him on the site). Janša has been sued for defamation after labeling a journalist a &quot;washed-up prostitute&quot; in a tweet. The case is to be litigated before the Constitutional Court. A 2020 analysis of Janša&#x27;s more than 64.000 Twitter followers revealed that 73.3% were fake accounts. That year, Janša announced the administrator of his Twitter user profile would remove fake accounts. Janša&#x27;s large number of fake Twitter followers has been noted in the media for years. Janša was also a Parler user, inviting his Twitter followers to join him on the site in an English-language tweet. Janša followed several controversial far-right figures and conspiracy theorists on the site.

During a public spat with Janša, lawyer Lucija Ušaj Šikovec, a former SDS member and deputy leader of a newly formed far-right Homeland League party, accused Janša of controlling the party as an SDS satellite through its leader. After Janša accused her of leaving SDS because it didn&#x27;t meet her demand to stand as the party&#x27;s candidate for the 2019 European Parliament election, Ušaj accused him of lying and released a screen capture of a conversation between her and Janša in which he requested that &quot;they&quot; should astroturf an anti-immigration protest on the day that parliament was to discuss an SDS proposal for a referendum on immigration, explaining that &quot;protests are effective if the action comes from below and appears to be a spontaneous uprising&quot;. Such a protest did in fact take place and was attended by some 200-250 people, among them the future leader of the Homeland League. Ušaj Šikovec threatened to release more compromising messages from Janša if he did not recant the statement.

===Accusations of plagiarism===
The largest and most notable Roman Catholic newspaper &quot;Družina&quot; and Janša have both claimed that the very few individuals who managed to survive the Kočevski Rog massacre included Janša&#x27;s father, although the story of the actual survivor France Dejak, which was told in 1989 for the first time in Mladina, was re-told in details as if it has been experienced by Janša&#x27;s father.

In 2008, it was reported by the newspaper &quot;Mladina&quot; that Janez Janša copied a speech by Tony Blair, the prime minister of the United Kingdom. It was used in 2006 for the ceremony on the 15th anniversary of the Slovenian declaration of independence. His office responded with the claim that it was not copied but similar to Blair&#x27;s speech, and that this were only a few phrases often used for such occasions. A few of these sentences were proclaimed the &quot;Spade of the Year&quot; by the newspaper &quot;Večer&quot; in 2006; the award is given annually to the best publicly expressed thought in Slovenia.

==Personal life==
Janša is an active mountaineer, golfer, footballer, skier and snowboarder.

Janša had a long-term relationship with Silva Predalič, and they had two children, a son and a daughter.

Since July 2009, Janša has been married to Urška Bačovnik (MD) from Velenje. The two had been dating since 2006. In August 2011, their son Črtomir was born. Their second son, Jakob, was born in August 2013.

===Author===
Janša has published several books, the two of which are &#x27; (&quot;Manoeuvres&quot;, published in 1992 and subsequently translated into English under the title &quot;The Making of the Slovenian State&quot;) and &#x27; (&quot;Barricades&quot;, 1994), in which he exposes his personal views on the problems of Slovenia&#x27;s transition from communism to a parliamentary democracy. In both books, but particularly in &quot;Okopi&quot;, Janša criticized the then president of Slovenia Milan Kučan of interfering in daily politics using the informal influence he had gained as the last chairman of the Communist Party of Slovenia. He published a second edition of the same book: with some additional documents and personal views.

<doc id="1038989" wikidata="Q1753563" url="?curid=1038989" title="SystemC">
<text>SystemC is a set of C++ classes and macros which provide an event-driven simulation interface (see also discrete event simulation). These facilities enable a designer to &quot;simulate&quot; concurrent processes, each described using plain C++ syntax. SystemC processes can communicate in a &quot;simulated&quot; real-time environment, using signals of all the datatypes offered by C++, some additional ones offered by the SystemC library, as well as user defined. In certain respects, SystemC deliberately mimics the hardware description languages VHDL and Verilog, but is more aptly described as a &quot;system-level modeling language&quot;.

SystemC is applied to system-level modeling, architectural exploration, performance modeling, software development, functional verification, and high-level synthesis. SystemC is often associated with electronic system-level (ESL) design, and with transaction-level modeling (TLM).

== Language specification ==
SystemC is defined and promoted by the Open SystemC Initiative (OSCI — now Accellera), and has been approved by the IEEE Standards Association as IEEE 1666-2011 - the SystemC Language Reference Manual (LRM). The LRM provides the definitive statement of the semantics of SystemC. OSCI also provide an open-source proof-of-concept simulator (sometimes incorrectly referred to as the reference simulator), which can be downloaded from the OSCI website. Although it was the intent of OSCI that commercial vendors and academia could create original software compliant to IEEE 1666, in practice most SystemC implementations have been at least partly based on the OSCI proof-of-concept simulator.

=== Compared to HDLs ===
SystemC has semantic similarities to VHDL and Verilog, but may be said to have a syntactical overhead compared to these when used as a hardware description language. On the other hand, it offers a greater range of expression, similar to object-oriented design partitioning and template classes. Although strictly a C++ class library, SystemC is sometimes viewed as being a language in its own right. Source code can be compiled with the SystemC library (which includes a simulation kernel) to give an executable. The performance of the OSCI open-source implementation is typically worse than commercial VHDL/Verilog simulators when used for register transfer level simulation.

=== Versions ===
SystemC version 1 included common hardware-description language features such as structural hierarchy and connectivity, clock-cycle accuracy, delta cycles, four-valued logic (0, 1, X, Z), and bus-resolution functions.

SystemC version 2 onward focused on communication abstraction, transaction-level modeling, and virtual-platform modeling. It also added abstract ports, dynamic processes, and timed event notifications.

== Language features ==

=== Modules ===
SystemC has a notion of a container class called a module. This is a hierarchical entity that can have other modules or processes contained in it.

Modules are the basic building blocks of a SystemC design hierarchy. A SystemC model usually consists of several modules which communicate via ports. The modules can be thought of as a building block of SystemC.

=== Ports ===
Ports allow communication from inside a module to the outside (usually to other modules) via channels.

=== Signals ===
SystemC supports resolved and unresolved signals. Resolved signals can have more than one driver (a bus) while unresolved signals can have only one driver.

=== Exports ===
Modules have ports through which they connect to other modules. SystemC supports single-direction and bidirectional ports.

Exports incorporate channels and allow communication from inside a module to the outside (usually to other modules).

=== Processes ===
Processes are used to describe functionality. Processes are contained inside modules. SystemC provides three different process abstractions to be used by hardware and software designers. Processes are the main computation elements. They are concurrent.

=== Channels ===
Channels are the communication elements of SystemC. They can be either simple wires or complex communication mechanisms like FIFOs or bus channels.

Elementary channels:
* signal: the equivalent of a wire
* buffer
* fifo
* mutex
* semaphore

=== Interfaces ===
Ports use interfaces to communicate with channels.

=== Events ===
Events allow synchronization between processes and must be defined during initialization.

=== Data types ===
SystemC introduces several data types which support the modeling of hardware.

Extended standard types:
* &quot;n&quot;-bit signed integer
* &quot;n&quot;-bit unsigned integer
* &quot;n&quot;-bit signed integer for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 64
* &quot;n&quot;-bit unsigned integer for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 64

Logic types:
* 2-valued single bit
* 4-valued single bit
* vector of length &quot;n&quot; of sc_bit
* vector of length &quot;n&quot; of sc_logic

Fixed point types:
* templated signed fixed point
* templated unsigned fixed point
* untemplated signed fixed point
* untemplated unsigned fixed point

SystemC traces its origins to work on Scenic programming language described in a DAC 1997 paper.

ARM Ltd., CoWare, Synopsys and CynApps teamed up to develop SystemC (CynApps later became Forte Design Systems) to launch it first draft version in 1999. The chief competitor at the time was SpecC another C based open source package developed by UC Irvine personnel and some Japanese companies.

In June 2000, a standards group known as the Open SystemC Initiative was formed to provide an industry neutral organization to host SystemC activities and to allow Synopsys&#x27; largest competitors, Cadence and Mentor Graphics, democratic representation in SystemC development.

== Example code ==
Example code of an adder:

#include &quot;systemc.h&quot;

SC_MODULE(adder) // module (class) declaration
 sc_in&lt;int&gt; a, b; // ports
 sc_out&lt;int&gt; sum;

 void do_add() // process
 sum.write(a.read() + b.read()); //or just sum = a + b

 SC_CTOR(adder) // constructor
 SC_METHOD(do_add); // register do_add to kernel
 sensitive « a « b; // sensitivity list of do_add
};
==Power and energy estimation in SystemC==
The power and energy estimation can be accomplished in SystemC by means of simulations.
Powersim is a SystemC class library aimed to the calculation of power and energy consumption of hardware described at system level. To this end, C++ operators are monitored and different energy models can be used for each SystemC data type.
Simulations with Powersim do not require any change in the application source code.

<doc id="1038991" wikidata="Q623412" url="?curid=1038991" title="Pavel Kolobkov">
<text>Pavel Anatolyevich Kolobkov (; born 22 September 1969) is a Russian (and formerly Soviet) retired épée fencer. He won one gold, two silver and three bronze medals at five Olympic Games from 1988 to 2004. Kolobkov served as Russia&#x27;s representative to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) until 2015 when WADA declared the Russian Anti-Doping Agency to be non-compliant, and he was barred from serving as a representative to WADA. He served as the Russian Minister of Sport from 2016 to 2020, when he was dismissed from the position by President Putin. He also previously served as the Russian Deputy Minister of Sport as well as the Russian Deputy Minister of Sport, Tourism and Youth Policy.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Kolobkov was born in Moscow.
In his career he won 27 individual and team medals between Olympic Games, World and European Championships. He was appointed as a Russian Deputy Minister of Sport, Tourism and Youth Policy on 8 October 2010 by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. He was appointed as the head of the Russian 2012 London Summer Olympics delegation on 9 August 2011. On 18 June 2012, he was appointed as the Russian Deputy Minister of Sports. He was appointed as a Class 3 State Advisor of the Russian Federation on 7 October 2013.

===World Anti-Doping Agency representative ===
Kolobkov also served as Russia&#x27;s representative to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). He unsuccessfully denied WADA&#x27;s finding that Russia was falsifying laboratory doping data, and was criticized by Russia&#x27;s top athletes for endangering their careers. After Russia was accused of doping, Kolobkov provided WADA with fresh data, but it only revealed further manipulation.

His last meeting with the organization was on 18 November 2015, when WADA declared the Russian Anti-Doping Agency to be non-compliant. As a result, he lost his position as a representative to WADA in January 2016, and was barred from serving on the organization&#x27;s Foundation Board.

WADA also ended up barring Russia from the Olympics and other international competition for four years for its doping. Jonathan Taylor, a British lawyer who wrote the report proposing the sanctions, which were approved unanimously by the WADA’s board, said of Kolbokov: &quot;I don’t know if he is corrupt or incompetent.&quot;

===Russian Minister of Sport===
He was appointed as a Class 2 State Advisor of the Russian Federation on 11 August 2016. On 19 October, he was appointed as the Russian Minister of Sport.

On 15 January 2020, he lost his job, as he was dismissed and replaced as Russian Sports Minister by President Putin.

===Gazprom Neft official===
In March 2020, Kolobkov was appointed as a board member and the deputy chief executive officer for Federal Government Relations by Gazprom Neft.

<text>Air Chief Marshal Sir William Alec Coryton, (16 February 1895 – 20 October 1981) was a senior Royal Air Force (RAF) commander in World War II. He was considered by his peers as one of the RAF&#x27;s most capable group commanders.

==Early life and First World War==
Coryton was born at Pentillie Castle in Cornwall on 16 February 1895. He was commissioned as an officer in the British Army&#x27;s Rifle Brigade (Special Reserve) during World War I. In 1918 he was transferred to the Royal Flying Corps (RAF) as a lieutenant. When the RFC became the Royal Air Force, he resigned his army commission and became an officer of the Royal Air Force.

==RAF career==
From 1925 to 1928, Coryton was Officer Commanding 16 Squadron, based at Old Sarum, Wiltshire, operating the Bristol F.2 Fighter in the tactical reconnaissance role.

In 1938 Coryton was made Director of Operations (Overseas) at the Air Ministry. He held this post until April 1942, when he was assigned Air Officer Commanding No. 5 Group RAF. While there he presided over the introduction of the Avro Lancaster into service. In February 1943 Coryton was relieved and replaced by Ralph Cochrane. Air Vice Marshal Don Bennett asserted that Coryton was sacked by Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris for refusing to send a force of 24 of his Lancasters in poor weather conditions on a sneak raid to Berlin. Coryton was moved to the Air Staff at the Air Ministry, where he served as Assistant Chief of Air Staff (Operations). On 25 August 1944 Coryton was made Commander, RAF Third Tactical Air Force, which was renamed RAF in Bengal &amp; Burma on 4 December 1944 with Coryton remaining in command.

Ten days later he was made Assistant Air Commander, Eastern Air Command, a position he held until May 1945.

About 15 October 1945, he handed over his duties in Burma and became Controller of Research and Development at the Ministry of Aircraft Production. The next year he transferred to the Ministry of Supply as Controller of Supplies (Air).

Coryton retired from the RAF in 1951, but remained at the Ministry of Supply in a civilian capacity. He died on 20 October 1981 at Langton Matravers, Dorset.

<doc id="1039011" wikidata="Q408510" url="?curid=1039011" title="Chitosan">
<text>Chitosan is a linear polysaccharide composed of randomly distributed β-(1→4)-linked -glucosamine (deacetylated unit) and &quot;N&quot;-acetyl--glucosamine (acetylated unit). It is made by treating the chitin shells of shrimp and other crustaceans with an alkaline substance, such as sodium hydroxide.

Chitosan has a number of commercial and possible biomedical uses. It can be used in agriculture as a seed treatment and biopesticide, helping plants to fight off fungal infections. In winemaking, it can be used as a fining agent, also helping to prevent spoilage. In industry, it can be used in a self-healing polyurethane paint coating. In medicine, it is useful in bandages to reduce bleeding and as an antibacterial agent; it can also be used to help deliver drugs through the skin.

== History ==
In 1799, British chemist Charles Hatchett experimented with decalcifying the shells of various crustaceans, finding that a soft, yellow and cartilage-like substance was left behind that we now know to be chitin. In 1859, French physiologist Charles Marie Benjamin Rouget found that boiling chitin in potassium hydroxide solution could deacetylate it to produce a substance that was soluble in dilute organic acids, that he called &quot;chitine modifiée&quot;. In 1894, German chemist Felix Hoppe-Seyler named the substance chitosan. From 1894 to 1930 there was a period of debate and confusion over the exact composition of chitin and particularly whether animal and fungal forms where the same chemicals. In 1930 the first chitosan films and fibres were patented but competition from petroleum-derived polymers limited their uptake. It was not until the 1970s that there was renewed interest in the compound, spurred partly by laws that prevented the dumping of untreated shellfish waste.

==Manufacture ==

Chitosan is produced commercially by deacetylation of chitin, which is the structural in the exoskeleton of crustaceans (such as crabs and shrimp) and cell walls of fungi. A common method for obtaining chitosan is the deacetylation of chitin using sodium hydroxide in excess as a reagent and water as a solvent. The reaction follows first-order kinetics though it occurs in two steps; the activation energy barrier for the first stage is estimated at 48.8 kJ·mol−1 at and is higher than the barrier to the second stage.

The degree of deacetylation (%) can be determined by NMR spectroscopy and the degree of deacetylation in commercially available chitosan ranges from 60 to 100%. On average, the molecular weight of commercially produced chitosan is 3800–20,000 daltons. 

Nanofibrils have been made using chitin and chitosan.

===Chemical modifications ===
Chitosan contains the following three functional groups: C2-NH2, C3-OH, and C6-OH. C3-OH has a large spatial site resistance and therefore is relatively difficult to modify. C2-NH2 is highly reactive for fine modifications and is the most common modifying group in chitosan. In chitosan, although amino groups are more prone to nucleophilic reactions than hydroxyl groups, both can react non-selectively with electrophilic reagents such as acids, chlorides, and haloalkanes to functionalize them. Since chitosan contains a variety of functional groups, it can be functionalized in different ways such as phosphorylation, thiolation, and quaternization to adapt it to specific purposes. 

==== Phosphorylated chitosan ====
Water-soluble phosphorylated chitosan can be obtained by the reaction of phosphorus pentoxide and chitosan under low-temperature conditions using methane sulfonic acid as the catalyst; phosphorylated chitosan with good antibacterial activity and ionic properties can be prepared by graft copolymerization of chitosan monophosphate. 

The good water solubility and metal chelating properties of phosphorylated chitosan and its derivatives make them widely used in tissue engineering, drug delivery carriers, tissue regeneration, and the food industry. 

In tissue engineering, phosphorylated chitosan exhibits improved swelling and ionic conductivity. Although its crystallinity is reduced, its tensile strength remains largely unchanged. These properties make it useful for creating scaffolds that can support bone tissue regeneration by binding growth factors and promoting stem cell differentiation into bone-forming cells. Additionally, to enhance the solubility of chitosan-based hydrogels at neutral or alkaline pH, the derivative &quot;N&quot;-methylene phosphonic acid chitosan (NMPC-GLU) has been developed. This material maintains good mechanical strength and improve cell proliferation, making it valuable for biomedical applications.

==== Thiolated chitosan ====
Thiolated chitosan is produced by attaching thiol groups to the amino groups of chitosan using a thiol-containing coupling agent. The primary site for this modification is the amino group at the 2nd position of chitosan&#x27;s glucosamine units. During this process, thioglycolic acid and cysteine mediate the reaction, forming an amide bond between the thiol group and chitosan. At a pH below 5, thiol activity is reduced, which limits disulfide bond formation.

The modified chitosan exhibits improved adhesive properties and stability due to the covalent attachment of the thiol groups. Lower pH reduces oxidation, enhancing its adhesion properties. Additionally, thiolated chitosan can interact with cell membrane receptors, improving membrane permeability and showing potential for applications in bacterial adhesion prevention, for example for coating stainless steel.

==== Ionic chitosan ====
There are two main methods of chitosan quaternization: direct quaternization and indirect quaternization. 

* The direct quaternization of chitosan amino acids treats chitosan with haloalkanes under alkaline conditions. Another method is the reaction of chitosan with aldehydes first, followed by reduction, and finally with haloalkanes to obtain quaternized chitosan. 
* The indirect quaternization method refers to introducing small molecules containing quaternary ammonium groups into chitosan, such as glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, (5-bromopentyl) trimethyl ammonium bromide, etc. Quaternary ammonium groups can further be introduced into the chitosan backbone via azide-alkyne cycloaddition, or by dissolving chitosan in alkali and urea and then reacting it with 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride, which provides a simple and green solution to achieve chitosan functionalization.

Cationic derivatives of chitosan have important roles in bioadhesion, absorption enhancement, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and anti-tumor applications. Chitosan modified with quaternary ammonium groups is one of the most common cationic chitosan derivatives. Quaternized chitosan with a permanent positive charge has increased antimicrobial activity and solubility compared to normal chitosan.

== Properties ==
The amino group in chitosan has a p&quot;K&quot;b value of ~6.5, which leads to significant protonation in neutral solution, increasing with increased acidity (decreased pH) and the %DA-value. This makes chitosan water-soluble and a bioadhesive which readily binds to negatively charged surfaces such as mucosal membranes. Also, chitosan can effectively bind to other surface via hydrophobic interaction and/or cation-π interaction (chitosan as a cation source) in aqueous solution. The free amine groups on chitosan chains can make crosslinked polymeric networks with dicarboxylic acids to improve chitosan&#x27;s mechanical properties. Chitosan enhances the transport of polar drugs across epithelial surfaces, and is biocompatible and biodegradable. However, it is not approved by the FDA for drug delivery. Purified quantities of chitosan are available for biomedical applications.

=== Physicochemical properties ===
Chitosan has biological properties, such as biodegradability and biocompatibility. The biological properties of chitosan are closely related to its physicochemical structure, which includes the degree of deacetylation, water content, and molecular weight. Deacetylation refers to the process of removing the acetyl group from chitosan, and this process determines the content of free amine groups in chitosan. Studies have shown that chitosan has good solubility only when the degree of deacetylation is above 85%. The enhanced chitosan uptake is mainly due to the interaction of positively charged chitosan with cell membranes, activation of chlorine–bicarbonate exchange channels, and reorganization of proteins associated with epithelial tight junctions, thus opening epithelial tight junctions. Chitosan inhibits the growth of different bacteria and fungi by mechanisms involving several factors, including the degree of deacetylation, pH, divalent cations, and solvent type.

==Uses==

===Agricultural and horticultural use===
The agricultural and horticultural uses for chitosan, primarily for plant defense and yield increase, are based on how this glucosamine polymer influences the biochemistry and molecular biology of the plant cell. The cellular targets are the plasma membrane and nuclear chromatin. Subsequent changes occur in cell membranes, chromatin, DNA, calcium, MAP kinase, oxidative burst, reactive oxygen species, callose pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, and phytoalexins.

Chitosan was first registered as an active ingredient (licensed for sale) in 1986.

====Natural biocontrol and elicitor====
In agriculture, chitosan is typically used as a natural seed treatment and plant growth enhancer, and as an ecologically friendly biopesticide substance that boosts the innate ability of plants to defend themselves against fungal infections.

Degraded molecules of chitin/chitosan exist in soil and water. Chitosan applications for plants and crops are regulated in the USA by the EPA, and the USDA National Organic Program regulates its use on organic certified farms and crops. EPA-approved, biodegradable chitosan products are allowed for use outdoors and indoors on plants and crops grown commercially and by consumers.

In the European Union and United Kingdom, chitosan is registered as a &quot;basic substance&quot; for use as a biological fungicide and bactericide on a wide range of crops.

The natural biocontrol ability of chitosan should not be confused with the effects of fertilizers or pesticides upon plants or the environment. Chitosan active biopesticides represent a new tier of cost-effective biological control of crops for agriculture and horticulture. The biocontrol mode of action of chitosan elicits natural innate defense responses within plant to resist insects, pathogens, and soil-borne diseases when applied to foliage or the soil. Chitosan increases photosynthesis, promotes and enhances plant growth, stimulates nutrient uptake, increases germination and sprouting, and boosts plant vigor. When used as a seed treatment or seed coating on cotton, corn, seed potatoes, soybeans, sugar beets, tomatoes, wheat, and many other seeds, it elicits an innate immunity response in developing roots which destroys parasitic cyst nematodes without harming beneficial nematodes and organisms.

Agricultural applications of chitosan can reduce environmental stress due to drought and soil deficiencies, strengthen seed vitality, improve stand quality, increase yields, and reduce fruit decay of vegetables, fruits and citrus crops . Horticultural application of chitosan increases blooms and extends the life of cut flowers and Christmas trees. The US Forest Service has conducted research on chitosan to control pathogens in pine trees and increase resin pitch outflow which resists pine beetle infestation.

Chitosan has been studied for applications in agriculture and horticulture dating back to the 1980s. By 1989, chitosan salt solutions were applied to crops for improved freeze protection or to crop seed for seed priming. Shortly thereafter, chitosan salt received the first ever biopesticide label from the EPA, then followed by other intellectual property applications.

Chitosan has been used to protect plants in space, as well, exemplified by NASA&#x27;s experiment to protect adzuki beans grown aboard the space shuttle and Mir space station in 1997. NASA results revealed chitosan induces increased growth (biomass) and pathogen resistance due to elevated levels of β-(1→3)-glucanase enzymes within plant cells. NASA confirmed chitosan elicits the same effect in plants on earth.

In 2008, the EPA approved natural broad-spectrum elicitor status for an ultralow molecular active ingredient of 0.25% chitosan. A natural chitosan elicitor solution for agriculture and horticultural uses was granted an amended label for foliar and irrigation applications by the EPA in 2009. Given its low potential for toxicity and abundance in the natural environment, chitosan does not harm people, pets, wildlife, or the environment when used according to label directions. Chitosan blends do not work against bark beetles when put on a tree&#x27;s leaves or in its soil.

===Filtration===
Chitosan can be used in hydrology as a part of a filtration process. Chitosan causes the fine sediment particles to bind together, and is subsequently removed with the sediment during sand filtration. It also removes heavy minerals, dyes, and oils from the water. As an additive in water filtration, chitosan combined with sand filtration removes up to 99% of turbidity. Chitosan is among the biological adsorbents used for heavy metals removal without negative environmental impacts.

In combination with bentonite, gelatin, silica gel, isinglass, or other fining agents, it is used to clarify wine, mead, and beer. Added late in the brewing process, chitosan improves flocculation, and removes yeast cells, fruit particles, and other detritus that cause hazy wine.

===Winemaking and fungal source chitosan===
Chitosan has a long history for use as a fining agent in winemaking. Fungal source chitosan has shown an increase in settling activity, reduction of oxidized polyphenolics in juice and wine, chelation and removal of copper (post-racking) and control of the spoilage yeast &quot;Brettanomyces&quot;. These products and uses are approved for European use by the EU and OIV standards.

===Wound management===
Chitosan-based wound dressings have been widely explored for a variety of acute and chronic wounds. Chitosan has the ability to adhere to fibrinogen, which produces increased platelet adhesion, causing clotting of blood and hemostasis. Chitosan hemostatic agents are salts made from mixing chitosan with an organic acid (such as succinic or lactic acid). Chitosan may have other properties conducive to wound healing, including antibacterial and antifungal activity, which remain under preliminary research. 

Chitosan is used within some wound dressings to decrease bleeding. Upon contact with blood, the bandage becomes sticky, effectively sealing the laceration. Chitosan hydrogel-based wound dressings have also been found useful as burn dressings, and for the treatment of chronic diabetic wounds and hydrofluoric acid burns.

Chitosan-containing wound dressings received approval for medical use in the United States in 2003.

===Temperature-sensitive hydrogels===
Chitosan is dissolved in dilute organic acid solutions but is insoluble in high concentrations of hydrogen ions at pH 6.5 and is precipitated as a gel-like compound. Chitosan is positively charged by amine groups, making it suitable for binding to negatively charged molecules. However, it has disadvantages such as low mechanical strength and low-temperature response rate; it must be combined with other gelling agents to improve its properties. Using glycerolphosphate salts (possessing a single anionic head) without chemical modification or cross-linking, the pH-dependent gelation properties can be converted to temperature-sensitive gelation properties. In the year 2000, Chenite was the first to design the temperature-sensitive chitosan hydrogels drug delivery system using chitosan and β-glycerol phosphate. This new system can remain in the liquid state at room temperature, while becoming gel with increasing temperature above the physiological temperature (37 °C). Phosphate salts cause a particular behaviour in chitosan solutions, thereby allowing these solutions to remain soluble in the physiological pH range (pH 7), and they will be gel only at body temperature. When the liquid solution of chitosan-glycerol phosphate, containing the drug, enters the body through a syringe injection, it becomes a water-insoluble gel at 37 °C. The entrapped drug particles between the hydrogel chains will be gradually released.

===Research===
Chitosan and derivatives have been explored in the development of nanomaterials, bioadhesives, wound dressing materials, improved drug delivery systems, enteric coatings, and in medical devices.

===Bioprinting===
Bioinspired materials, a manufacturing concept inspired by natural nacre, shrimp carapace, or insect cuticles, has led to development of bioprinting methods to manufacture large scale consumer objects using chitosan. This method is based on replicating the molecular arrangement of chitosan from natural materials into fabrication methods, such as injection molding or mold casting. Once discarded, chitosan-constructed objects are biodegradable and non-toxic. The method is used to engineer and bioprint human organs or tissues.

Pigmented chitosan objects can be recycled, with the option of reintroducing or discarding the dye at each recycling step, enabling reuse of the polymer independently of colorants. Unlike other plant-based bioplastics (e.g. cellulose, starch), the main natural sources of chitosan come from marine environments and do not compete for land or other human resources.

3D bioprinting of tissue engineering scaffolds for creating artificial tissues and organs is another application where chitosan has gained popularity. Chitosan has high biocompatibility, biodegradability, and antimicrobial, hemostatic, wound healing and immunomodulatory activities which make it suitable for making artificial tissues.

=== Weight loss ===
Chitosan is marketed in a tablet form as a &quot;fat binder&quot;. Although the effect of chitosan on lowering cholesterol and body weight has been evaluated, the effect appears to have no or low clinical importance. Reviews from 2016 and 2008 found there was no significant effect, and no justification for overweight people to use chitosan supplements. In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a public advisory about supplement retailers who made exaggerated claims concerning the supposed weight loss benefit of various products.

=== Biodegradable antimicrobial food packaging ===
Microbial contamination of food products accelerates the deterioration process and increases the risk of foodborne illness caused by potentially life-threatening pathogens. Ordinarily, food contamination originates superficially, requiring surface treatment and packaging as crucial factors to assure food quality and safety. Biodegradable chitosan films have potential for preserving various food products, retaining their firmness and restricting weight loss due to dehydration. In addition, composite biodegradable films containing chitosan and antimicrobial agents are in development as safe alternatives to preserve food products.

===Battery electrolyte===
Chitosan is being investigated as an electrolyte for rechargeable batteries with good performance and low environmental impact due to rapid biodegradability, leaving recycleable zinc. The electrolyte has excellent physical stability up to 50 °C, electrochemical stability up to 2 V with zinc electrodes, and accommodates redox reactions involved in the Zn-MnO2 alkaline system. results were promising, but the battery needed testing on a larger scale and under actual use conditions.

<doc id="1039022" wikidata="Q7246315" url="?curid=1039022" title="Privilege separation">
<text>In computer programming and computer security, privilege separation (privsep) is one software-based technique for implementing the principle of least privilege. With privilege separation, a program is divided into parts which are limited to the specific privileges they require in order to perform a specific task. This is used to mitigate the potential damage of a computer security vulnerability.

== Implementation ==
A common method to implement privilege separation is to have a computer program fork into two processes. The main program drops privileges, and the smaller program keeps privileges in order to perform a certain task. The two halves then communicate via a socket pair. Thus, any successful attack against the larger program will gain minimal access, even though the pair of programs will be capable of performing privileged operations.

Privilege separation is traditionally accomplished by distinguishing a &quot;real&quot; user ID/group ID from the &quot;effective&quot; user ID/group ID, using the setuid(2)/setgid(2) and related system calls, which were specified by POSIX. If these are incorrectly positioned, gaps can allow widespread network penetration.

Many network service daemons have to do a specific privileged operation such as open a raw socket or an Internet socket in the well known ports range. Administrative utilities can require particular privileges at run-time as well. Such software tends to separate privileges by revoking them completely after the critical section is done, and change the user it runs under to some unprivileged account after so doing. This action is known as &quot;dropping root&quot; under Unix-like operating systems. The unprivileged part is usually run under the &quot;nobody&quot; user or an equivalent separate user account.

Privilege separation can also be done by splitting functionality of a single program into multiple smaller programs, and then assigning the extended privileges to particular parts using file system permissions. That way the different programs have to communicate with each other through the operating system, so the scope of the potential vulnerabilities is limited (since a crash in the less privileged part cannot be exploited to gain privileges, merely to cause a denial-of-service attack).

== Examples ==

=== Dovecot ===
Another email server software designed with privilege separation and security in mind is Dovecot.

=== OpenBSD ===
Separation of privileges is one of the major OpenBSD security features. 

=== OpenSSH ===
OpenSSH uses privilege separation to ensure &quot;pseudo terminal&quot; (pty) creation happens in a secure part of the process, away from per connection processes with network access. 

=== Postfix ===
The implementation of Postfix was focused on implementing comprehensive privilege separation.

=== Solaris ===
Solaris implements a separate set of functions for privilege bracketing.

<text>The province of Cremona (; Cremunés: ; ; Casalasco-Viadanese: ) is a province in the Lombardy region of Italy. Its capital city is Cremona.

The province occupies the central section of Padana Plain, so the whole territory is flat, without any mountains or hills, crossed by several rivers, such as the Serio and Adda, and artificial canals, most of which are used for irrigation.

The river Po, which is the longest Italian river, is the natural boundary with the adjoining province of Piacenza, while the Oglio separates the province from Brescia.

Lombardy has been inhabited since ancient times and Stone Age and Bronze Age rock drawings and artefacts have been found there. From the fifth century BC, Gallic tribes invaded and settled in the region, building several cities (including Milan) and ruling the land as far as the Adriatic Sea. From the third century BC the Romans expanded their sphere of influence into the area, and in 194 BC, the whole of what is now Lombardy became a Roman province called Gallia Cisalpina. The Romans overwhelmed the previous civilisations and Lombardy became one of the richest and best-developed areas in Italy. It was here in 313 AD that the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great issued the famous Edict of Milan that gave freedom of religion to all people in the Roman Empire.

Following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, Lombardy was invaded by successive waves of tribes, the last of which was the Germanic Lombards in the late sixth century. Stability followed until 774 when the Frankish king Charlemagne conquered the area and annexed the Kingdom of the Lombards (most of northern and central Italy) to his empire.

==Geography==

The province of Cremona is a long, relatively narrow part of the Padana Plain in northern Italy, the outline of which is circumscribed by rivers. The province is orientated from northwest to southeast. To the west of the province lies the Province of Lodi, to the northwest lies the Province of Milan, to the north lies the Province of Bergamo, to the east lies the Province of Brescia, and to the southeast lies the Province of Mantua. The region of Emilia-Romagna lies to the south, Cremona abutting onto the Province of Reggio Emilia, the Province of Parma and the Province of Piacenza.

Several rivers flow across the Lombardy Plain to join the Po which runs along the southern border of the province. The Adda separates Cremona from the province of Lodi and the Oglio provides the border with the province of Mantua. Other rivers in the north of the province include the Serio and the Tormo, and the Mella makes up a short stretch of the border with the province of Brescia. These rivers are linked by a network of canals which have been in place since at least the sixteenth century and are largely used for irrigation. The Muzza Canal takes its water from the river Adda and irrigates the land between that river and the river Ticino, converting the plain into a fertile area with rich meadows and productive agricultural land.

The total area of the province is . Although the province is essentially flat, there are some undulations in the surface formed by the varying courses of the rivers over the millennia. For historical reasons, the province is subdivided into four rural districts, centred on Crema, Soresina, Cremona and Casalmaggiore. In the north, some watercourses emerge from the ground in the &quot;line of springs&quot;, a phenomenon of the northern Lombardy Plain, where melt-water from the Alps flows underground through porous gravelly soils before being forced to the surface when it reaches impervious, clayey ground.

The climate is largely uniform throughout the province. The annual rainfall is about with October and November being the wettest months and February and July being the driest. The average temperature is in January and
 in July. There is often fog in winter, especially near the rivers.

==Government==

The Province of Cremona is an administrative body of intermediate level between a municipality (&quot;comune&quot;) and Lombardy region.

The three main functions devolved to the province of Cremona are:
* local planning and zoning;
* provision of local police and fire services;
* transportation regulation (car registration, maintenance of local roads, etc.).

As an administrative institution, the province of Cremona has its own elected bodies. From 1948 to 1995 the President of the province of Cremona was chosen by the members of the Provincial Council, elected every five years by citizens. From 1995 to 2014, under provisions of the 1993 local administration reform, the President of the Province was chosen by popular election, originally every four, then every five years.

In a 2005 ruling of the European Court of Justice, the &quot;comune&quot; of Cingia de&#x27; Botti&#x27;s award of a concession contract for public gas distribution services was criticised, as the contract had been awarded to a company called &quot;Padania&quot; without a competitive procurement process, contrary to EU regulations. Padania was a public-sector company owned by the province and most of the provincial &quot;comunes&quot;, including Cingia de’ Botti, but also open, at least to some degree, to private part-ownership.

On 3 April 2014, the Italian Chamber of Deputies gave its final approval to Law n.56/2014 which involved the transformation of the Italian provinces into &quot;institutional bodies of second level&quot;. According to the 2014 reform, each province is headed by a President (or Commissioner) assisted by a legislative body, the Provincial Council, and an executive body, the Provincial Executive. The President (Commissioner) and members of the Council are elected together by mayors and city councillors of each municipality of the province respectively every four and two years. The Executive is chaired by the President (Commissioner) who appoints other members, called &quot;assessori&quot;. Since 2015, the President (Commissioner) and other members of the Council do not receive a salary.

In each province, there is also a Prefect (&quot;prefetto&quot;), a representative of the central government who heads an agency called &quot;prefettura-ufficio territoriale del governo&quot;. The Questor (&quot;questore&quot;) is the head of the State Police (&quot;Polizia di Stato&quot;) in the province and his office is called &quot;questura&quot;. There is also a province&#x27;s police force depending on local government, called provincial police (&quot;polizia provinciale&quot;).

This is a list of the Presidents of the Province since 1948:

;Notes
==Economy and culture==

The principal economic resources of the province of Cremona are agricultural. Rice is grown with the help of water drawn from canals. Other crops include maize (corn), locally called &quot;Melegot&quot; and barley and to a lesser extent, soya and sugar beet. Grapes are cultivated and wine produced, and there is also a silk industry. The farms in the province are some of the most productive in the country. Other industries are quite developed, mostly in the northern zone, near Crema, where there are textiles, chemical, and mechanical factories.

Beef and dairy cattle are kept in the province. The beef serves as an ingredient for local dishes, and milk from the dairy cows is used to create traditional cheeses as well as producing butter and cream. The area is famous for its food specialities, such as nougat (Italian: &quot;torrone&quot;) and mustard. It is unclear exactly where torrone originated, but the recipe used in Cremona is the best known.

The city of Cremona has a strong musical tradition. The cathedral, built in the twelfth century, provided a focus for musical activity and by the sixteenth century, the town was the musical centre of the region. Even now it attracts people to hear performances by ensembles and attend the many festivals. The Renaissance composer Marc&#x27;Antonio Ingegneri taught here, his most illustrious pupil being Claudio Monteverdi. The composer Pierre-Francisque Caroubel was born here and later moved to Wolfenbüttel in Germany to collaborate with Michael Praetorius. The town became renowned for the violins and other musical instruments that were made here (many members of the Stradivari, Amati, Guarneri and Bergonzi families of luthiers were all prominent citizens of Cremona), and was also well known for its concert bands. A band school was started here in 1864 under the auspices of the composer Amilcare Ponchielli. The &quot;traditional violin craftsmanship in Cremona&quot; was declared an intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO in 2012.

<text>Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue is a 1990 American animated children comedy-drama social guidance film starring many characters from several animated television series at the time of its release. The plot follows Michael, a teenager who is using marijuana, leaving his family worried. When his younger sister Corey&#x27;s piggy bank goes missing one morning, cartoon characters come to life from various items in her room and find it in Michael&#x27;s room along with his stash of drugs, so they give him an intervention in the form of a fantasy journey to teach him the adverse consequences of drug use.

McDonald&#x27;s released a VHS home video edition of the special distributed by Buena Vista Home Video, which opened with an introduction from President George H. W. Bush, First Lady Barbara Bush and their dog, Millie. It was produced by the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Foundation and Southern Star Productions, and was animated overseas by Wang Film Productions. The musical number &quot;Wonderful Ways to Say No&quot; was written by Academy Award-winning composer, Alan Menken and lyricist Howard Ashman, who also wrote the songs for Walt Disney Animation Studios&#x27; &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, and &quot;Aladdin&quot;.

Financed by McDonald&#x27;s, Ronald McDonald Children&#x27;s Charities, it was originally simulcast for a limited time on April 21, 1990, on all four major American television networks (by supporting their Saturday morning characters): ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox, and most independent stations, as well as various cable networks.

== Plot ==
An unseen person steals a piggy bank off the dresser in the bedroom of a young girl named Corey. The theft is witnessed by Papa Smurf, who emerges from a Smurfs comic book with the other Smurfs and alerts the different cartoon characters in the room: from a picture, Garfield as a lamp, Alvin and the Chipmunks from a record sleeve, Winnie the Pooh as a stuffed animal, Baby Kermit as an alarm clock, and Slimer, who arrives through the wall.

Alf, Garfield, Alvin, Simon, and Theodore identify the thief: Michael, Corey&#x27;s older brother, who has a box of marijuana hidden under his bed. Meanwhile, Corey expresses her concerns about Michael&#x27;s change in behavior since they used to have a close sibling relationship, which he angrily denies, causing him to storm out of the house. The cartoons set off to take action regarding Michael&#x27;s addiction, leaving Pooh behind to look after Corey.

At an arcade, Michael smokes marijuana with his friends and &quot;Smoke&quot;, an anthropomorphic cloud of smoke personifying temptation, who try to convince him to take harder drugs. They are chased into an alley by Bugs Bunny disguised as a police officer. He traps Smoke in a garbage can and takes Michael back in time using a time machine borrowed from the absent Wile E. Coyote. It is shown that Michael&#x27;s addiction started through peer pressure from older high school students when he was around Corey&#x27;s age. Back in the present, Michael is hesitant to smoke crack with his friends before one of them steals his wallet. He and Smoke chase after her until they fall into a sewer and encounter Michelangelo, who tells them that the drugs are harming his brain. Baby Kermit, Baby Miss Piggy, and Baby Gonzo take him on a roller coaster-esque tour of the human brain. Michael finds himself at a park, where Huey, Dewey, and Louie as well as Tigger join the rest of the cartoons to sing about how to refuse drugs.

Michael wakes up in his room, believing his interactions with the cartoons to be a nightmare. Corey tries talking to him, but he snaps and shoves her against his bedroom wall. He tries apologizing, but she runs out of his room, frightened. Smoke approves of Michael&#x27;s actions, but he starts having regrets. Michael then looks at himself in a small mirror, from which Alf grabs and pulls him inside. Inside a hall of mirrors, Alf shows Michael his current reflection, then an aged, sickly version of himself severely affected by drugs. When Michael insists that he can easily quit and is in control of his actions, Alf reveals that Smoke is actually in charge. Back in Michael&#x27;s room, Smoke traps Pooh in a cabinet and tempts Corey to try Michael&#x27;s marijuana for herself. She considers the possibility that it could mend her relationship with Michael.

The drug-induced carnival in Michael&#x27;s mind leads him to Daffy Duck, who reads his future in a crystal ball and sees an almost skeletal Michael on his deathbed. After one last warning from the cartoons, an ashamed Michael stops Corey from using the drugs just in time. When he apologizes and expresses concern over whether he can change, she advises him to seek help from his family. Smoke tries to persuade him otherwise, but Michael throws him out a window into a garbage truck. All the cartoons appear on a poster on Michael&#x27;s wall, and they agree to be prepared for if and when Smoke returns. Michael releases Pooh from the cabinet, who jumps into the poster with the others before the siblings go downstairs to talk to their parents.

== Characters == 
The characters, from 10 different franchises, are (in order of appearance):

*&quot;Looney Tunes&quot;: Bugs Bunny &amp; Daffy Duck (Wile E. Coyote is mentioned but not seen; his time machine is used by Bugs Bunny)
*&quot;The Smurfs&quot;: Papa Smurf, Brainy Smurf, Hefty Smurf &amp; some other unidentified Smurfs (although Smurfette is seen on the poster &amp; VHS cover, she is not seen in the special; Harmony Smurf &amp; Baby Smurf make picture cameos)

*&quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;: Winnie the Pooh &amp; Tigger
*&quot;Garfield and Friends&quot;: Garfield

== Voice cast ==
The various character owners licensed them freely due to the public service aspect of the special.

The special marked the first time the characters Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck were voiced by someone other than Mel Blanc, who had died shortly before the production, prompting Warner Bros. to enlist Jeff Bergman in his place.

== Broadcast ==
The special was screened in Australia on 9 November 1990. Like the U.S. broadcast, it aired at 4.30pm simultaneously on Australia&#x27;s major commercial networks (Seven Network, Nine Network, and Network Ten). Prime Minister Bob Hawke introduced the Australian screening. It was screened in New Zealand in December on both TV One and Channel 2 simultaneously. Prime Minister Jim Bolger introduced it instead of the U.S. president. It was screened in Canada on the CBC, CTV, and Global Television Networks and most independent stations shortly after its original U.S. broadcast, although all of the characters had their respective shows aired on either CTV or Global but not CBC. Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney introduced it. The special was broadcast in Brazil in 1994, as Rede Manchete made Portuguese Brazilian dubbing in Herbert Richers Dubbing Studios.

In the United States, all superstations and a handful of independent stations (mainly in selected cities) aired the special, but some stations aired the special at a different period during the week the special aired on the Big Four stations and a number of cable networks. Superstations WPIX in New York City, WGN-TV in Chicago, KTLA in Los Angeles, KTVT in Dallas, WKBD-TV in Detroit, KHTV in Houston, WVTV in Milwaukee, KSTW in Tacoma/Seattle, KSHB-TV in Kansas City, and KWGN in Denver premiered the special at the same time the big four networks and cable systems premiered, with St. Louis&#x27; KPLR-TV premiered the special two hours later after its television premiere. New York&#x27;s WWOR-TV and Boston&#x27;s WSBK-TV would later premiere the special the following morning on April 22. The special also aired on selected cable systems, including BET, TNT, USA Network, Nickelodeon, and The Disney Channel.

== Reception ==
Some modern critics have considered the production a time capsule of animation history during the US war on drugs, and have ridiculed it as &quot;propaganda&quot; and &quot;preachy&quot;. However, Sean Thiessen of &quot;GIANT FREAKIN ROBOT&quot; described it favorably as &quot;the greatest anti-drug special ever made.&quot;

<text>Air Marshal Sir John Eustice Arthur Baldwin, (13 April 1892 – 28 July 1975) was a senior officer in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War.

==Early life==
Educated at Rugby School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Baldwin was commissioned into the 8th (King&#x27;s Royal Irish) Hussars in 1911 and served as a cavalry Officer in the First World War.

==Military service==
Baldwin was awarded the Royal Aero Club&#x27;s Aviator&#x27;s Certificate no. 971 on 17 November 1914 and became a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps. He was appointed Officer Commanding No. 55 Squadron in October 1916 and Officer Commanding No. 41 Wing in December 1917 before transferring to the Royal Air Force on its formation in 1918. He was appointed Commandant of the Central Flying School in 1928 and served as Aide-de-Camp to King George V from 1931 to 1932. He went on to be Air Officer Commanding No. 1 Group in 1934, Director of Personal Services in 1935 and Commandant of the RAF College Cranwell in 1936 before taking up the post of Air Officer Commanding No. 21 Group in 1938. He retired in August 1939.

Just two weeks later, Baldwin was recalled to serve in the Second World War as Air Office Commanding No. 3 Group at RAF Bomber Command. Between 9 January and 21 February 1942, he was acting Commander in Chief of Bomber Command, after the removal of Richard Peirse. During this brief tenure the &quot;Channel Dash&quot; occurred, when the &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; escaped from the French port of Brest and fled up the English Channel to the sanctuary of Kiel harbour in northern Germany. In October 1942 he became Deputy Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, India. This appointment was followed from November 1943 by his posting as Air Officer Commanding Third Tactical Air Force which supported the ground battle in South East Asia. On 5 February 1943, Baldwin attended the departure of Major General Orde Wingate, the Chindits and the 1st Air Commando Group departed for Operation THURSDAY in Burma. He reverted to the Retired List again on 15 December 1944. Jack was Colonel of the 8th King&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars from 1948 until 1958, when the unit amalgamated to form the Queen&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars.

==Personal life==
In 1916 Jack Baldwin married Kathleen Betsy Terry of the York confectionery family (Terry&#x27;s), they lived in the village of Ketton, Rutland from the 1930s to the 1950s and had two children, John and Pamela. John Noel Anthony Baldwin became a Captain in the 8th King&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars and was killed in action in 1942 in Libya. Baldwin was the High Sheriff of Rutland for 1955–56.

<doc id="1039033" wikidata="Q969291" url="?curid=1039033" title="Cope's rule">
<text>Cope&#x27;s rule, named after American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, postulates that population lineages tend to increase in body size over evolutionary time. It was never actually stated by Cope, although he favoured the occurrence of linear evolutionary trends. It is sometimes also known as the Cope–Depéret rule, because Charles Depéret explicitly advocated the idea. Theodor Eimer had also done so earlier. The term &quot;Cope&#x27;s rule&quot; was apparently coined by Bernhard Rensch, based on the fact that Depéret had &quot;lionized Cope&quot; in his book. While the rule has been demonstrated in many instances, it does not hold true at all taxonomic levels, or in all clades. Larger body size is associated with increased fitness for a number of reasons, although there are also some disadvantages both on an individual and on a clade level: clades comprising larger individuals are more prone to extinction, which may act to limit the maximum size of organisms.

==Function==

===Effects of growth===
Directional selection appears to act on organisms&#x27; size, whereas it exhibits a far smaller effect on other morphological traits, though it is possible that this perception may be a result of sample bias. This selectional pressure can be explained by a number of advantages, both in terms of mating success and survival rate.

For example, larger organisms find it easier to avoid or fight off predators and capture prey, to reproduce, to kill competitors, to survive temporary lean times, and to resist rapid climatic changes. They may also potentially benefit from better thermal efficiency, increased intelligence, and a longer lifespan.

Offsetting these advantages, larger organisms require more food and water, and shift from r to K-selection. Their longer generation time means a longer period of reliance on the mother, and on a macroevolutionary scale restricts the clade&#x27;s ability to evolve rapidly in response to changing environments.

===Capping growth===
Left unfettered, the trend of ever-larger size would produce organisms of gargantuan proportions. Therefore, some factors must limit this process.
At one level, it is possible that the clade&#x27;s increased vulnerability to extinction, as its members become larger, means that no taxon survives long enough for individuals to reach huge sizes. There are probably also physically imposed limits to the size of some organisms; for instance, insects must be small enough for oxygen to diffuse to all parts of their bodies, flying birds must be light enough to fly, and the length of giraffes&#x27; necks may be limited by the blood pressure it is possible for their hearts to generate. Finally, there may be a competitive element, in that changes in size are necessarily accompanied by changes in ecological niche. For example, terrestrial carnivores over 21 kg almost always prey on organisms larger, not smaller, than themselves. If such a niche is already occupied, competitive pressure may oppose the directional selection. The three Canidae clades (Hesperocyoninae, Borophaginae, and Caninae) all show a trend towards larger size, although the first two are now extinct.

==Validity==
Cope recognised that clades of Cenozoic mammals appeared to originate as small individuals, and that body mass increased through a clade&#x27;s history. Discussing the case of canid evolution in North America, Blaire Van Valkenburgh of UCLA and coworkers state:
In some cases, the increase in body size may represent a passive, rather than an active, trend. In other words, the maximum size increases, but the minimum size does not; this is usually a result of size varying pseudo-randomly rather than directed evolution. This does not fall into Cope&#x27;s rule &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, but is considered by many workers to be an example of &quot;Cope&#x27;s rule &quot;sensu lato&quot;&quot;. In other cases, an increase in size may in fact represent a transition to an optimal body size, and not imply that populations always develop to a larger size.

However, many palaeobiologists are skeptical of the validity of Cope&#x27;s rule, which may merely represent a statistical artefact. Purported examples of Cope&#x27;s rule often assume that the stratigraphic age of fossils is proportional to their &quot;clade rank&quot;, a measure of how derived they are from an ancestral state; this relationship is in fact quite weak. Counterexamples to Cope&#x27;s rule are common throughout geological time; although size increase does occur more often than not, it is by no means universal. For example, among genera of Cretaceous molluscs, an increase in size is no more common than stasis or a decrease. In many cases, Cope&#x27;s rule only operates at certain taxonomic levels (for example, an order may obey Cope&#x27;s rule, while its constituent families do not), or more generally, it may apply to only some clades of a taxon. Giant dinosaurs appear to have evolved dozens of times, in response to local environmental conditions.

Despite many counter-examples, Cope&#x27;s rule is supported in many instances. For example, all marine invertebrate phyla except the molluscs show a size increase between the Cambrian and Permian. Collectively, dinosaurs exhibit an increase in body length over their evolution. Cope&#x27;s rule also appears to hold in clades where a constraint on size is expected. For instance, one may expect the size of birds to be constrained, as larger masses mean more energy must be expended in flight. Birds have been suggested to follow Cope&#x27;s law, although a subsequent reanalysis of the same data suggested otherwise.

An extensive study published in 2015 supports the presence of a trend toward larger body size in marine animals during the Phanerozoic. However, this trend was present mainly in the Paleozoic and Cenozoic; the Mesozoic was a period of relative stasis. The trend is not attributable simply to neutral drift in body size from small ancestors, and was mainly driven by a greater rate of diversification in classes of larger mean size. A smaller component of the overall trend is due to trends of increasing size within individual families.

<doc id="1039051" wikidata="Q7581142" url="?curid=1039051" title="Springing">
<text>Springing as a nautical term refers to global (vertical) resonant hull girder vibrations induced by continuous wave loading. When the global hull girder vibrations occur as a result of an impulsive wave loading, for example a wave slam at the bow (bow-slamming) or stern (stern-slamming), the phenomenon is denoted by the term whipping. Springing is a resonance phenomenon, and it can occur when the natural frequency of the 2-node vertical vibration of the ship equals the wave encounter frequency or a multiple therefrom. Whipping is a transient phenomenon of the same hull girder vibrations due to excessive impulsive loading in the bow or stern of the vessel. The 2-node natural frequency is the lowest and thereby the most dominant resonant mode leading to hull girder stress variations, though in theory higher vibration modes will be excited as well.

Springing induced vibrations can already be present in low or moderate sea states when resonant conditions occur between wave lengths present in the wave spectrum and the hull girder natural modes, while whipping typically requires rough sea states before the very local occurring slamming impact has sufficient energy to excite the global structural vibration modes.

The hydrodynamic theory of springing is not yet fully understood due to the complex description of the surface waves and structure interaction. It is, however, well known that larger ships with longer resonant periods are more susceptible to this type of vibration. Ships of this type include very large crude carriers and bulk carriers, but possibly also container vessels. The first experience with this phenomenon was related to fatigue cracking on 700 ft Great Lakes bulk carriers during the 1950s. Later 1000 ft Great Lakes bulk carriers experienced the same problems even after strength specifications increased. The Great Lake bulk carriers are typically rather blunt and slender ships (length to width ratio of 10) sailing at shallow draft resulting in long natural periods of about 2 seconds. This mode can be excited by short waves in the wave spectrum. A rather complete overview of the full scale experiences and relevant literature on springing can be found in references and.

The container ships are more slender, have higher service speeds and have more pronounced bow flares. Container ships are also known to experience significant whipping (transient) vibrations from bow impacts. Blunt ships may also experience whipping especially with flat bottom impacts in the bow area. The bottom part of the bow however rarely exits from the water on such ships. Vibration from whipping may also increase the extreme loading of ships potentially resulting in vessels breaking in two in severe storms.

In the extreme cases springing may cause severe fatigue cracking of critical structural details, especially in moderate to rough head seas with low peak periods. Vibration is normally more easily excited by waves in ballast condition than in cargo condition. The converse may also be true since some ships experience more head wind and waves in ballast conditions, while other ships may experience more head wind and waves in cargo condition, thereby vibrating less overall.

Ocean-going ships have not had this problem until recently, when high tensile strength steel was introduced as a common material in the whole ship to reduce initial costs. This makes the ships less stiff and the nominal stress level higher.

Today&#x27;s ship specifications do not account for springing which may be the dominant fatigue factor for some vessels.

<text>Follebu is a village in Gausdal Municipality in Innlandet county, Norway. The village is located along the river Gausa, about to the southeast of the village of Segalstad bru. The town of Lillehammer lies about to the southeast of Follebu.
Follebu Church (&quot;Follebu kirke&quot;) is located just to the northwest of the village. It was built in a Gothic style of stone and brick between the years 1260 and 1300.

The village has a population (2021) of 1,160 and a population density of .

==Name==
The Old Norse form of the name was &quot;Foldabu&quot;. The first element is probably the genitive pluralis of &quot;fold&quot; which means &quot;meadow&quot;, &quot;plain&quot;, or &quot;open and flat land&quot;. The last element of the name is &quot;bú&quot; which means &quot;rural district&quot;. The area is quite flat and open, especially when it is compared to the surrounding areas.

<text>White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean is the fourth studio album by the American punk rock band NOFX. It was released on November 5, 1992, through Epitaph Records. It is the first NOFX album to feature El Hefe on guitar, replacing Steve Kidwiler, who left the band in 1991. &quot;White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean&quot; was also the first NOFX album not produced by Brett Gurewitz, who produced the band&#x27;s first three albums. According to the liner notes for the album, the original title was going to be &quot;White Trash, Two Kikes and a Spic&quot;, but one of the band members&#x27; family members thought it was offensive, so they changed it to the title of the actual release. The title is a reference to the eclectic ethnic identities of the band members: white &quot;trash&quot; (Erik Sandin), two Jews (Fat Mike and Eric Melvin), and a Hispanic (El Hefe).

==Track listing==
All songs were written by Fat Mike except &quot;Straight Edge,&quot; originally by Minor Threat.
==Personnel==

<text>The province of Lecco (; Lecchese: ) is a province in the Lombardy region of Italy. Its capital is the city of Lecco.

As of 2017, the province had a population of 337,211 on a surface of divided into 85 &quot;comuni&quot; (: &quot;comune&quot;).

==History==
The Province of Lecco was established by the President of the Republic in Decree No. 250 of 6 March 1992. Elections for the appointment of the first President of the Province of Lecco were held on 23 April 1995 (1st round) and 7 May 1995 (runoff). The proclamation of the 1st President, Mario Anghileri, occurred on 9 May 1995.

==Literature==
&quot;The Betrothed&quot; ( ) is an Italian historical novel by Alessandro Manzoni, first published in 1827, in three volumes, and significantly revised and rewritten until the definitive version published between 1840 and 1842. It has been called the most famous and widely read novel in the Italian language, and it is generally ranked among the masterpieces of world literature. The setting is beautiful but marred with poverty. It begins with Renzo and Lucia, a couple living in a village in Lombardy, near Lecco, on Lake Como, who are planning to wed on 8 November 1628.

==Geography==

The Province of Lecco is situated in northern central Italy. It is bordered to the north and west by the Province of Como, to the east and north with the Province of Sondrio, to the east by the Province of Bergamo, and to the south with the Province of Monza and Brianza. The province of Lecco has an area of only , with some located across the Adda River, in Valsassina. The remaining land is located in the Oggionese, the Casatese, and the Meratese, with an additional belonging to the municipality of Oliveto Lario, located on the other side of Lake Como, in Vallassina, within the pre-Alpine Lecchese. 70% of the province is mountainous and the other 30% is hilly. The highest point is Mount Legnone in the north of the province, high; at the center of the spectacular Grigne. In the west, is Monte Cornizzolo lake at and Monte Rai at . In the east of the province is Monte Serrada and the Resegone di Lecco, with its characteristic shape reminiscent of the teeth of a saw. In the center-south is Monte Barro at , in the Monte Barro Regional Park.

The province contains numerous lakes, with Lake Como and Lake Annone in the comunes of Garlate and Olginate. To the west, the comunes of Rogeno, Bosisio Parini, and Cesana Brianza overlook Lake Pusiano. There is also an abundance of rivers, including the main Adda river and the Lambro, running through Costa Masnaga, Rogeno, and Nibionno. Other smaller rivers are the Molgora, the Bévéra, a tributary of the Lambro, the Pioverna flowing in Valsassina, and Varro flowing in Val Varrone.

==Towns of Brianza in the province ==
Airuno, Annone di Brianza, Barzago, Barzanò, Bosisio Parini, Brivio, Bulciago, Calco, Casatenovo, Cassago Brianza, Castello di Brianza, Cernusco Lombardone, Cesana Brianza, Civate, Colle Brianza, Costa Masnaga, Cremella, Dolzago, Ello, Galbiate, Garlate, Garbagnate Monastero, Imbersago, La Valletta Brianza, Lomagna, Merate, Missaglia, Molteno, Montevecchia, Monticello Brianza, Nibionno, Oggiono, Olgiate Molgora, Olginate, Osnago, Paderno d&#x27;Adda, Robbiate, Rogeno, Santa Maria Hoè, Sirone, Sirtori, Suello, Valgreghentino, Verderio, Viganò

<text>An archtop guitar is a hollow acoustic or semi-acoustic guitar with a full body and a distinctive arched top, whose sound is particularly popular with jazz, blues, and rockabilly players.

Typically, an archtop guitar has:

* Six strings
* An arched top and back, not a flat top and back
* A hollow body
* Moveable adjustable bridge
* F-holes similar to members of the violin family
* Rear mounted tailpiece, stoptail bridge, or Bigsby vibrato tailpiece
* 14th-fret and set-in neck join

== History ==

The archtop guitar is often credited to Orville Gibson, whose innovative designs led to the formation of the Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Mfg. Co, Ltd in 1902. His 1898 patent for a mandolin, which was also applicable to guitars according to the specifications, was intended to enhance &quot;power and quality of tone.&quot; Among the features of this instrument were a violin-style arched top and back, each carved from a single piece of wood, and thicker in the middle than at the sides; sides carved to shape from a single block of wood; and a lack of internal &quot;braces, splices, blocks, or bridges . . . which, if employed, would rob the instrument of much of its volume of tone.&quot;
But Gibson was not the first to apply violin design principles to the guitar. Guitar maker A. H. Merrill, for example, patented in 1896 a very modern looking instrument &quot;of the guitar and mandolin type . . . with egg-shaped hoop or sides and a graduated convex back and top.&quot; The instrument featured a metal tailpiece and teardrop shaped &quot;f-holes,&quot; and strongly resembled the archtop guitars of the 1930s. James S. Back obtained patent #508,858 in 1893 for a guitar (which also mentions applicability to mandolins) that among other features included an arched top, which were produced under the Howe Orme name. Another transitional design is the parlor guitar fitted with a floating bridge and tailpiece. These inexpensive instruments, manufactured by companies such as Stella and Harmony, are associated with early blues musicians. The earliest Gibson designs (L1 to L3) introduced the arched top and increasing body sizes, but still had round or oval sound holes.

In 1922, Lloyd Loar was hired by the Gibson Company to redesign their instrument line in an effort to counter flagging sales, and in that same year the Gibson L5 was released to his design. Although the new instrument models flopped commercially and Loar left Gibson after only a couple of years, Gibson instruments signed by Loar now are among the most prized and celebrated in stringed-instrument history. Perhaps the most revered instrument from this period is the F5 mandolin, but probably the more broadly influential was the L5 guitar, which remains in production to this day. The mature Gibson archtop guitar and its imitators are regarded as the quintessential &quot;jazzbox.&quot;

Archtop guitars were subsequently made by many top American luthiers, notably John D&#x27;Angelico of New York and Jimmy D&#x27;Aquisto, William Wilkanowski, Charles Stromberg and Son in Boston, and by other major manufacturers, notably Gretsch and Epiphone. In Europe, companies such as Framus, Höfner, Hoyer and Hagström took up the manufacture of archtops. Archtop guitars were particularly adopted by both jazz and country musicians, and in big bands and swing bands.
Gibson&#x27;s ES-150 guitar is generally recognized as the world&#x27;s first commercially successful Spanish-style electric guitar. The ES stands for Electric Spanish, and it was designated &quot;150&quot; because it cost $150, along with an EH-150 amplifier and a cable. After its introduction in 1936, it immediately became popular in jazz orchestras of the period. Unlike the usual acoustic guitars utilized in jazz, it was loud enough to take a more prominent position in ensembles. Jazz guitarist Eddie Durham is usually credited with making the first electric guitar solo, but it was ES-150 player Charlie Christian who popularized the jazz guitar as a solo, not just a rhythm, instrument. The ES-150&#x27;s top was not carved on the underside, making it unsuitable for acoustic use.

In 1951, Gibson released the L5CES, an L5 with a single cutaway body and two electric pickups, equally playable as either an acoustic guitar or an electric guitar. This innovation was immediately popular, and while purely acoustic archtop guitars such as the Gibson L-7C remain available to this day, they have become the exception. In 1958, the L5CES was redesigned with humbucking pickups; most, but certainly not all, subsequent archtop guitars conform loosely to the pattern set by this model. The electric archtop was particularly popular with jazz musicians Tal Farlow, Barney Kessel and Johnny Smith.

Other manufacturers introduced electric archtop guitars, notable examples including the Gretsch White Falcon and various Chet Atkins models. Some of these instruments have a distinctive &quot;twangy&quot; sound and were taken up by country music and early rock and roll artists such as Duane Eddy and Eddie Cochran. Similar models remain popular in rockabilly.
Gibson&#x27;s last innovation in archtop design was the creation, in 1955, of &quot;thinline&quot; models with a reduced body depth. Notable thinline models include the successful Gibson ES-335, introduced in 1958, as well as the Epiphone Casino, introduced after Epiphone was acquired in 1957 by CMI, Gibson&#x27;s parent company. These were more feedback resistant, comfortable to hold and easier to play standing up. The first thinlines were hollow bodies. Later thinlines such as the ES-335, ES-345 and ES-355 were semi-hollow. Thinlines can be classed as semiacoustic guitars, although not all semiacoustic guitars have an arched top. Thinlines became popular with mainstream pop and rock artists during the 1960s. The ES-335 and similar guitars were taken up by, and remain steadfastly popular with, electric blues players; B. B. King&#x27;s various &quot;Lucilles&quot; are based on the ES-335.

The 1970s and 1980s were a low point of interest in archtops, with many rock and pop (and some jazz and blues) players switching to solid body guitars. One manufacturer for this period was Robert Benedetto.

Interest in archtops was revived in the 1990s. Archtops had long been expensive instruments, with a level of finish and ornament to match. Boutique luthiers such as Roger Borys and Bob Benedetto brought the aesthetics of the instrument to even greater heights, making them attractive to collectors, and also continuing to innovate in technical design. The Benedetto style of acoustic/electric archtop has itself been copied by luthiers such as Dale Unger and Dana Bourgeois. Most of the accessories (pickguard, bridge, tuner buttons, knobs, etc.) are made of wood (ebony or rosewood) instead of metal and have a clean acoustic look. It is estimated there are nearly 100 archtop guitar luthiers in North America alone.

Contrastingly, mass-market archtop guitars became more affordable in the late 20th century, due to a combination of low labor costs in Asian countries and computer numerically controlled manufacture. Most major guitar marques include at least a couple of archtops in their range, albeit not necessarily manufactured at their own facilities. Ibanez sells an extensive range of archtops under the Artcore marque. The Samick corporation sells archtops under its own name besides manufacturing for other companies. Gibson sells inexpensive Asian-made archtops under its Epiphone brand, such as the Epiphone Dot.

Renewed interest in acoustic music has also led to the revival of purely acoustic archtops, such as the Gibson L-7C, The Loar Lh-600, Godin 5th Avenue and the Epiphone Century Series.

Recent technical innovations include Ken Parker&#x27;s use of carbon fibre in high-end acoustic archtops, and the Godin Montreal hybrid guitar.

==Construction==

Archtops usually have three-a-side pegheads and necks similar in width to a steel-string acoustic rather than an electric. High-end models traditionally have &quot;block&quot; or &quot;trapezoid&quot; position markers.

The top or belly (and often the back) of the archtop guitar is either carved out of a block of solid wood or heat-pressed using either a solid top or laminations, the latter being a less expensive construction method. The belly normally has two f-holes, the lower of these partly covered by a scratch plate raised above the belly so as not to dampen its vibration. The arching of the top and the f-holes are similar to the violin family, on which they were originally based. The contours of the arching profile are usually derived in an ad hoc fashion. The tops of Gibson&#x27;s archtops were parallel braced. X-braced designs were introduced later, giving a tone closer to that of a flat-top guitar. Sitka spruce, European spruce, and Engelmann spruce are most often used for the resonant tops of archtop guitars, although some guitar builders use Adirondack spruce (Red spruce), or Western red cedar. Archtop guitars often have Curly maple or Quilted maple backs. Full-sized archtops are among the largest guitars ever made, with the width of the lower bout in some cases approaching 19 inches (47 cm).

The original acoustic archtop guitars were designed to enhance volume, so they were constructed for use with relatively heavy strings. Even after electrification became the norm, jazz guitarists have continued to fit strings of 0.012&quot; gauge or heavier for reasons of tone, and also prefer flatwound strings. Thinline archtops generally use standard electric guitar strings.

Many vibrato systems cannot be fitted to an archtop owing to the need to cut large holes in the belly to accommodate the mechanism, with the exception of the Bigsby vibrato tailpiece and the long tailpiece versions of the Gibson Vibrola. These vibrato systems mount on the surface of the guitar and need no body routing. Other systems have been used and trialed since this time.

==Various use of the term &quot;archtop&quot;==
Although &quot;archtop&quot; normally refers to a hollow-bodied, arched top instrument, some makers of solid-bodied guitars with carved bellies also refer to these as archtop to distinguish these from flat top guitars. For example, Gibson refers to the standard Gibson Les Paul as an archtop to distinguish it from flat top models such as the Les Paul Special and Melody Maker.

A continuum exists from purely acoustic instruments similar to the original Orville Gibson design, to solid-body designs:

* Fully acoustic instruments with either a pressed laminate wood or hand carved top. One example in the latter category, almost cello-like in construction, is the Gibson L-5. The sound board (music) is left to vibrate freely as no hardware other than the bridge posts come into contact with it. These instruments have a full-size body and a powerful acoustic tone suitable both for chords and for melody work. For amplified use, these guitars may be fitted with floating pickups in the neck position attached either to the base of the fingerboard or the edge of the pickguard. Today&#x27;s &quot;carved tops&quot; may also incorporate piezo electric pickups to amplify the sound without changing the tone, as in other acoustic-electric guitars.
* Hollow-bodied semiacoustic guitars such as the Gibson ES-175, which have a sound box similar to fully acoustic guitars, but also have permanent pickups built into the sound board and are intended to be played through an amplifier. In some thin-bodied models, such as the Epiphone Casino, the function of the sound box is purely to modify the sound transmitted to the pickups, as the un-amplified sound is weak and not normally considered musically useful.
* Semi-hollow guitars with a solid core but hollow bouts. In these, the bridge is fixed to a solid block of wood rather than to a sound board, and the belly vibration is minimized much as in a solid body instrument. While most such instruments feature F-holes, as seen on the Gibson ES-335, some semi-hollow bodies, such as the Gretsch Duo-Jet and Gibson Lucille, have no sound holes to reduce the possibility of feedback.
* Solid body instruments, such as the Les Paul Standard, with a carved but non-sounding belly.

==Bass guitars==
Archtop 4-string bass guitars have been manufactured since the use of electric pickups became popular. The most famous example is the Höfner violin bass used by Paul McCartney. Warwick makes a range of archtop 4-, 5-, and 6-string bass guitars. Framus also makes a range of archtop bass guitars.

==Other variations==
4-string (tenor), 7-string, 9-string, and 12-string archtops have been manufactured.

A few luthiers offer archtopped Maccaferri guitars.

The Mohan veena is a cross between an archtop and an Indian veena.

Some electric archtops also have piezoelectric pickups, making them hybrid guitars.

A relatively small number of ukulele makers offer instruments with flat tops but arched backs, generally of heat-pressed laminate construction with high-quality veneer; that design concentrates the uke body&#x27;s internal resonance upward toward the sound hole, &quot;like a parabolic mirror,&quot; according to the German seller RISA, whose Koki&#x27;o brand line of ukuleles all feature arched backs.

<text>The Aereon 26 (stylized as AEREON 26) was an experimental aircraft developed to investigate lifting body design with a view to using its shape to create hybrid designs, part airship, part conventional aircraft. It was powered by a piston engine, driving a pusher propeller, and generated lift through the aerodynamics of its lozenge-shaped fuselage.

Although results of flight tests conducted in 1971 were promising, funding for larger and semi-buoyant aircraft was not forthcoming at the time. The story of the test program was recounted by John McPhee in his book &quot;The Deltoid Pumpkin Seed&quot; (). This aircraft has a special place in UFO and conspiracy lore, since enthusiasts have drawn parallels between the shape of this aircraft and some reported UFOs from around the same era.

==Background==

The AEREON Corporation, established in 1959, at first concentrated on the construction of a prototype three-hull hybrid airship, the &quot;AEREON III&quot;. Completed in 1965, the prototype was lost during taxiing tests the following year, without having flown.

Following the destruction of the &quot;AEREON III&quot;, the firm sought &quot;a new and better solution.&quot; AEREON&#x27;s Monroe Drew and John Fitzpatrick employed German physicist Jürgen Bock, formerly of the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics, Heidelberg, Germany, and the U.S. Army&#x27;s Aberdeen Proving Ground, to develop a list of parameters that would be fed into a computer at the General Electric Space Center, Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, in order to determine &quot;the optimum configuration for enclosing maximum volume without too much penalty of drag.&quot; &quot;AEREON 26&quot;&#x27;s deltoid configuration, &quot;a shrewd and practical compromise between an airfoil and a sphere,&quot; was the result of these efforts.

Rubber-powered and gasoline-engined models of the configuration were flown and wind tunnel tests conducted before testing of the &quot;26&quot; itself began.

==Description==

===Structure and form===
According to a paper delivered to the Interagency Workshop on Lighter than Air Vehicles in 1974 by AEREON president William Miller, the 26&#x27;s shape—dubbed an &quot;aerobody&quot;—was &quot;a lifting-body [sic] of deltoid planform, elliptical cross-sections, and a fineness ratio of 4:5.&quot; Among the advantages claimed for this hull form were proximity of the aerodynamic center, center of buoyancy, and center of gravity and a minimal need for trim-control devices, thus facilitating the transportation of &quot;a full range of tonnages at various speeds without major trim requirements.&quot;

In McPhee&#x27;s words, the craft was &quot;a triangle with a deep belly and a vaulting back&quot; or a &quot;delta&quot; when seen from above and a &quot;fat and tremendous pumpkin seed&quot; from the side (hence &quot;deltoid pumpkin seed&quot;).

The 26&#x27;s structure was composed of aluminum tubes (salvaged from the wrecked &quot;AEREON III&quot;), joined using heli-arc welding and covered with aircraft cloth and aluminum sheet.

===Propulsion===
The 26 was powered by a single engine, mounted above the trailing edge and driving a pusher propeller. Although the 26 inherited the engine of the &quot;AEREON III&quot;—apparently a four-cylinder McCulloch of —it appears to have had three different propellers over the course of the test program. After the aircraft experienced difficulty in getting out of ground effect, &quot;a propeller of a different pitch&quot; was fitted. This second propeller was a &quot;virtually unique&quot; example, made of lemonwood, that had been used by Igor Bensen in an unsuccessful attempt on the autogyro speed record. After further testing indicated the 26 to be underpowered, a third propeller was carved to order from yellow birch by Sensenich Propeller and fitted in time for the 26&#x27;s second series of flight tests in 1971.

The engine&#x27;s lifespan also had a significant influence on the program; it was &quot;just a drone-aircraft engine, and an old one at that&quot; and had already been used for 12 hours of its 25-hour design life.

===Construction and assembly===
The 26 was assembled (like its predecessor) by veteran U.S. Navy airship rigger Everett Linkenhoker. Initial construction was in two portions, in &quot;a small shop near Lakehurst, New Jersey.&quot; The portions were then transported by road to Red Lion Airport, where they were joined together. The aircraft was initially housed in a timber-and-sheetrock box within a hangar at the airport, for reasons of secrecy. Initial taxiing tests were conducted at Red Lion, again under conditions of secrecy. Subsequently, the aircraft was transported by road to the National Aviation Facilities Experimental Center (NAFEC) near Atlantic City for flight testing.

==Flying history==
The 26 made its first flight, piloted by John Olcott (later president of the National Business Aviation Association), at NAFEC on September 7, 1970. However, as discussed above, it was initially unable to climb out of ground effect. By September 28, following the replacement of the propeller and the removal of some items, the 26 was capable of reaching an altitude of but appeared underpowered. The aircraft was returned to Red Lion before being hauled back to NAFEC on February 24, 1971, following the fitting of vortex generators and the third propeller.

Tests resumed at NAFEC on March 1, 1971. On this occasion, the 26 &quot;went up and out of ground effect with no strain at all&quot;. In subsequent tests, it performed circuits of the field and a variety of other maneuvers before the engine&#x27;s life expiry ended the test program.

==After the test program==

===Results of the program===
Addressing the Interagency Workshop on Lighter than Air Vehicles in 1974, William Miller said the test program indicated that performance was as had been predicted, the 26&#x27;s stability and control and handling qualities were &quot;good,&quot; the aircraft was &quot;docile and acceptable...within the limited scope of the tests,&quot; and the concept had been shown to be feasible, with the program potentially forming a basis for &quot;realistic studies of much larger such aircraft.&quot;

===Proposed further developments===

====Dynairships====

The aircraft was intended as a forerunner of much larger craft that—unlike the 26 itself—would contain helium; these designs were dubbed &quot;Dynairships.&quot; One proposal, the AEREON 340, was to have been long, with a wingspan of and total lift of . Powered by four Rolls-Royce Tyne turboprop engines, it was claimed to be capable of carrying intermodal containers or semi-trailers, operating slightly heavier than air. A patent for &quot;[a] cargo-carrying air ship [sic] compris[ing] a gas-filled, low aspect ratio deltoid wing&quot; was granted in 1969; according to this patent, &quot;extremely large ships, having lengths in excess of &quot; and capable of economically transporting &quot;large payloads, ranging up to or more&quot; over long distances, were feasible.

In 1974, Miller described three &quot;hypothetical Dynairships&quot;:
* A &quot;small patrol aircraft&quot; long, with a gross weight of 
* A &quot;medium-size cargo aircraft&quot; long, with a gross weight of 
* A &quot;logistic carrier&quot; long, with a gross weight of .

====Heavier-than-air====
Versions of the configuration that would, like the 26, have lacked lifting gas and operated heavier-than-air at all times were also proposed. These included &quot;a kind of flying camper for general aviation&quot; and &quot;a bigger model for the regional airline industry.&quot; A variant with a V/STOL capability, using blown flaps, was patented in 1979.
Another heavier-than-air variant, later known as the Aereon WASP, is described in a 1990 patent. This &quot;airborne surveillance antenna platform&quot; with &quot;long endurance and high altitude flight capability&quot; was to carry a radar antenna comprising &quot;planar or linear phased arrays arranged to scan in a continuous pattern in all azimuthal directions&quot; within its deltoid hull.

===Current status===
William Miller was looking to donate the Aereon 26 to a museum since at least 2011. As of 2019 it has been added to the Air Victory Museum permanent collection and is on public display in Lumberton, New Jersey.

<doc id="1039065" wikidata="Q11261547" url="?curid=1039065" title="Kombu">
<text>Konbu (from ) is edible kelp mostly from the family Laminariaceae and is widely eaten in East Asia. It may also be referred to as dasima () or haidai ().

Kelp features in the diets of many civilizations, including Chinese and Icelandic; however, the largest consumers of kelp are the Japanese, who have incorporated kelp and seaweed into their diets for over 1,500 years.

== Prominent species ==
There are about eighteen edible species in Laminariaceae and most of them, but not all, are called kombu. Confusingly, species of Laminariaceae have multiple names in biology and in fisheries science. In the following list, fisheries science synonyms are in parentheses, and Japanese names follow them.
* &quot;Saccharina japonica&quot; (&quot;Laminaria japonica&quot;), 
** &quot;Saccharina japonica&quot; var. &quot;religiosa&quot; (&quot;Laminaria religiosa&quot;), 
** &quot;Saccharina japonica&quot; var. &quot;diabolica&quot; (&quot;Laminaria diabolica&quot;), l
** &quot;Saccharina japonica&quot; var. &quot;ochotensis&quot; (&quot;Laminaria ochotensis&quot;), – commonly used for soup stocks
* &quot;Saccharina latissima&quot; (&quot;Laminaria saccharina&quot;), Karafuto-kombu – contains mannitol and is considered sweeter
* &quot;Saccharina angustata&quot; (&quot;Laminaria angustata&quot;), – commonly used in the making of dashi
* &quot;Saccharina longissima&quot; (&quot;Laminaria longissima&quot;),　
* &quot;Saccharina coriacea&quot; (&quot;Laminaria coriacea&quot;), 
* &quot;Saccharina sculpera&quot; (&quot;Kjellmaniella sculpera&quot;), 
* &quot;Saccharina longipedalis&quot; (&quot;Laminaria longipedalis&quot;), Enaga-kombu
* &quot;Saccharina gyrata&quot; (&quot;Kjellmaniella gyrata&quot;), 
* &quot;Saccharina cichorioides&quot; (&quot;Laminaria cichorioides&quot;), Chijimi-kombu
* &quot;Arthrothamnus bifidus&quot;, 

== Etymology ==
Kombu is a loanword from Japanese.

In Old Japanese, edible seaweed was generically called &quot;me&quot; (cf. wakame, arame) and kanji such as &quot;軍布&quot;, 海藻 or &quot;和布&quot; were applied to transcribe the word. Especially, kombu was called (from &quot;hiroi&quot;, wide) or (from &quot;ebisu&quot;). Sometime later the names &quot;konfu&quot; and &quot;kofu&quot; appeared respectively in two editions of Iroha Jiruishō in 12th–13th century.

Various theories have been claimed for the origin of the name kombu, with the following two predominant today.

One is that it originated from the on&#x27;yomi (Sino-Japanese reading) of the Chinese name 昆布 (kūnbù). The kanji itself already could be seen in &quot;Shōsōin Monjo&quot; (8th century) and &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot; (797) in Japan, and furthermore trace back in China, as early as 3rd century, to the book &quot;Wupu Bencao&quot; (around 239). Li Shizhen wrote the following in his &quot;Bencao Gangmu&quot; (1596):

Another possibility to explain the association arises because descriptions of kūnbù in Chinese documents are vague and inconsistent, and it is impossible to identify to which seaweed the term might have applied. For instance, Chen Cangqi (681–757) noted: &quot;kūnbù is produced in the South China Sea; its leaf is like a hand and the size is the same as a silver grass and a reed, is of red purple; the thin part of leaf is seaweed&quot;, which is similar to wakame, arame, kurome, or kajime (&quot;Ecklonia cava&quot;). The difficulty is that, at least in that time, kombu was not produced either in the East nor in the South China Sea. Moreover, following Zhang Yxi, Li Shizhen classified kūnbù and haidai (stands for kombu in Chinese) as different things, and this classification continues in China today.

== History ==
Although archaeological evidence of seaweed is hard to find because of its easy decomposition, some plant remains of wakame seaweed are found in some ruins of the Jōmon Period which leads to the supposition that kombu was also eaten at that time. As to surviving documents, the letters 軍布 (in Sino-Japanese reading 軍 is gun/kun; 布 is fu/pu/bu) appeared in Man&#x27;yōshū and wood strips from Fujiwara-kyō, and may have indicated kombu. The &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot; (797) reports: in 797 of Emishi (Ainu or Tohoku region people) stated they had been offering up kombu, which grew there, as tribute to the Yamato court every year without fail. The Engishiki (927) also reports that kombu had been offered up by Mutsu.

During the Muromachi period, a newly developed drying technique allowed kombu to be stored for more than a few days, and it became an important export from the Tohoku area. By the Edo period, as Hokkaidō was colonized and shipment routes were organized, the use of &quot;kombu&quot; became widespread throughout Japan. Traditional Okinawan cuisine relies heavily on &quot;kombu&quot; as a part of the diet; this practice began in the Edo period. Okinawa uses more &quot;kombu&quot; per household than any other prefecture. In the 20th century, a way to cultivate kombu was discovered and it became cheap and readily available.

In 1867, the word &quot;kombu&quot; first appeared in an English-language publication—&quot;A Japanese and English Dictionary&quot; by James Curtis Hepburn.

Umami, a basic taste, was first scientifically identified in 1908 by Kikunae Ikeda through his experimentation with &quot;kombu&quot;. He found that glutamic acid was responsible for the palatability of the &quot;dashi&quot; broth created from &quot;kombu&quot;, and was a distinct sensation from sweet, sour, bitter, and salty tastes. Ikeda named the newly-discovered taste &quot;umami&quot; (うま味), from the Japanese word &quot;umai&quot; (うまい, &quot;delicious&quot;).

Since the 1960s, dried &quot;kombu&quot; has been exported from Japan to many countries. It was available initially at Asian, and especially Japanese, food shops and restaurants, and can be found in supermarkets, health-food stores, and other nonspecializing suppliers.

== Cooking ==

=== Japan ===
Kombu is sold dried (&quot;dashi konbu&quot;) or pickled in vinegar (&quot;su konbu&quot;) or as a dried shred (&quot;oboro konbu&quot;, &quot;tororo konbu&quot; or &quot;shiraga konbu&quot;). It may also be eaten fresh in &quot;sashimi&quot;.

Kombu is used extensively in Japanese cuisines as one of the three main ingredients needed to make &quot;dashi&quot;, a soup stock. &quot;Konbu dashi&quot; is made by putting either whole dried or powdered kombu in cold water and heating it to near-boiling. The softened kombu is commonly eaten after cooking or is sliced and used to make &quot;tsukudani&quot;, a dish that is simmered in soy sauce and &quot;mirin&quot;.

Kombu may be pickled with sweet-and-sour flavoring, cut into small strips about 5 or 6 cm long and 2 cm wide. These are often eaten as a snack with green tea. It is often included when cooking beans, putatively to add nutrients and improve their digestibility.

&quot;Konbu-cha&quot; or &quot;kobu-cha&quot; () is a tea made by infusing kombu in hot water. What Americans call kombucha is called &quot;kōcha kinoko&quot; in Japan.

Kombu is also used to prepare a seasoning for rice to be made into sushi.

== Nutrition and health effects ==
&quot;Kombu&quot; is a good source of glutamic acid, an amino acid responsible for umami (the Japanese word used for a basic taste identified in 1908). Several foodstuffs in addition to &quot;kombu&quot; provide glutamic acid or glutamates.

&quot;Kombu&quot; contains extremely high levels of iodine. While this element is essential for normal growth and development, the levels in kombu can cause overdoses; it has been blamed for thyroid problems after drinking large amounts of soy milk in which &quot;kombu&quot; was an additive.

It is also a source of dietary fiber. Algae including kombu also contain entire families of obscure enzymes that break down complex sugars that are normally indigestible to the human gut (thus gas-causing). It also contains the well-studied alpha-galactosidase and beta-galactosidase enzymes.

== Biofuel ==

Genetically manipulated &quot;E. coli&quot; bacteria can digest &quot;kombu&quot; into ethanol, making it a possible maritime biofuel source.

<doc id="1039067" wikidata="Q1814654" url="?curid=1039067" title="Whitechapel Gallery">
<text>The Whitechapel Gallery is a public art gallery in Whitechapel on the north side of Whitechapel High Street, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The original building, designed by Charles Harrison Townsend, opened in 1901 as one of the first publicly funded galleries for temporary exhibitions in London. The building is a notable example of the British Modern Style. In 2009 the gallery approximately doubled in size by incorporating the adjacent former Passmore Edwards library building. It exhibits the work of contemporary artists and organizes retrospective exhibitions and other art shows.

==History==
The gallery exhibited Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot; in 1938 as part of a touring exhibition organised by Roland Penrose to protest against the Spanish Civil War.

The gallery played a major role in the history of post-war British art by promoting the work of emerging artists. Several significant exhibitions were held at the Whitechapel Gallery including &quot;This is Tomorrow&quot; in 1956, the first UK exhibition by Mark Rothko in 1961, and in 1964, &quot;The New Generation&quot; show which featured John Hoyland, Bridget Riley, David Hockney and Patrick Caulfield among others.

Initiated by members of the Independent Group, the exhibition brought Pop Art to the general public as well as introducing some of the artists, concepts, designers and photographers that would define the Swinging Sixties.

Throughout its history, the gallery had a series of open exhibitions that provided a platform for the area&#x27;s artist community, but by the early 1990s these open shows became less relevant as emerging artists moved to other areas.

In the late 1970s, the critical importance of the Whitechapel Gallery was displaced by newer venues such as the Hayward Gallery, then in the 1980s it enjoyed a resurgence under the Directorship of Nicholas Serota. The gallery had a major refurbishment in 1986; and in 2009 expanded into the former Passmore Edwards Library building next door. The expansion, which doubled the gallery&#x27;s physical size and nearly tripled its available exhibition space, now allows the Whitechapel Gallery to remain open to the public all year round.

== Publications ==
In 2006, Whitechapel Gallery and MIT Press formed an editorial alliance to produce a new series of books entitled Documents of Contemporary Art.

==Expansion==

The Whitechapel reopened in April 2009 after a two-year project, which approximately doubled the size of the Gallery by incorporating the adjacent former Passmore Edwards library building (vacated when Whitechapel Idea Store opened). The work cost approximately £13.5 million and was partly funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. A full-size tapestry based on Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot;, by Jacqueline de la Baume Dürrbach and loaned from the United Nations Art Collection, was included in the inaugural exhibition by Goshka Macuga. and Isa Genzken.

As part of the expansion, a new Archive Gallery, a reading room and an archive repository (where the Whitechapel&#x27;s historic records are held) have been created to support the Whitechapel&#x27;s standing as an educational charity. The archives catalogue the very conception of the gallery, as well as the complete directors&#x27; files of correspondence which reveal the reasons behind key decisions in the Gallery&#x27;s history.

==Directors==
* Charles Aitken (1901–1911)
* Hugh Scrutton (1945–1952)
* Bryan Robertson (1952–1968)
* Mark Glazebrook (1969–1971) 
* Jenny Stein (1972–1974)

<doc id="1039068" wikidata="Q1569318" url="?curid=1039068" title="Norwegian Humanist Association">
<text>The Norwegian Humanist Association (; HEF) is one of the largest secular humanist associations in the world, with over 130,000 members. Those members constitute 2.3% of the national population of 5.47 million, making HEF by far the largest such association in the world in proportion to population. The association publishes the magazine &quot;Fri tanke&quot; (Free Thought).

==History and activities==

Founded in 1956, the HEF is a member of the Humanists International (HI). The Norwegian Humanist Association is an organisation for people who base their ethics on human, not religious values. Most of its members are agnostics or atheists. HEF supports the following statement of the IHEU:

:Humanism is a democratic, non-theistic and ethical life stance which affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their lives and therefore reject supernatural views of reality.

Former HEF secretary general, Levi Fragell, was president of the IHEU (1988–2003) and later Chair of IHEU&#x27;s Committee for Growth and Development. Since September 2021, Christian Lomsdalen is chairman of the Board of the organization.

According to its bylaws, the organization works to ensure access to humanist ceremonies and spreading knowledge of humanism. The organization previously also worked for a separation of church and state (the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Norway was the state church of Norway until 2012). A civil confirmation organized by HEF has gained popularity among the Norwegian young during recent years. About 19 percent of Norwegian 15-year-olds were in 2018 taking part in HEF&#x27;s civil or humanist confirmation, whereas 56% took part in the ceremonies of &quot;state church&quot;, with the ceremonies of HEF increasing in popularity while the opposite happens to the church ceremonies. Locally the percentage of humanist youth ceremonies have been significantly higher and also significantly lower in the churches.

On July 9, 2006, a prominent member of the Norwegian Humanist Association, Jens Brun-Pedersen, called for prime minister Jens Stoltenberg to advocate the separation of church and state. He argued that the second article of the constitution of Norway which defines the &quot;Evangelical-Lutheran Religion&quot; as &quot;the official religion of the State&quot; and the 12th article of the constitution which requires half of the ministers of the cabinet to be members of the state church is discriminatory, and that Norway cannot criticise countries advocating sharia law when the constitution favours Lutheran members of society.

The Norwegian Humanist Association hosted the 18th World Humanist Congress of the IHEU. The Congress was held at the Oslo Congress Center in Oslo, Norway, on the 12–14 August 2011. The theme was Humanism and Peace. HEF also hosted the 3rd in 1962 and the 9th in 1986.

Although raising public awareness of scepticism is not a primary goal of the Norwegian Humanist Association, an online campaign was organized in 2011 called (No one likes to be fooled), which led to media debate of the issues. The campaign was kicked off by three appearances in Norway by James Randi, a Canadian-American retired stage magician and a scientific skeptic who has extensively challenged paranormal and pseudo scientific claims.

A youth wing of the HEF, Norwegian Humanist Youth (), was founded in August 2007. The current president of the board is Sina Inngjerdingen.

<doc id="1039071" wikidata="Q16201" url="?curid=1039071" title="Province of Lodi">
<text>The province of Lodi (; Ludesan: ) is a province in the Lombardy region of Italy. Its provincial capital is the city of Lodi.

As of 2017, it has a population of 229,541 inhabitants over an area of , giving the province a population density of 293.2 inhabitants per square kilometre. The provincial president is Francesco Passerini.

==History==
The city of Lodi was first settled during the fifth century BC by Celtic tribes, before being occupied by the Romans in 222 BC; by 89 BC it was called Laus Pompeia, the central city of the Lodi Vecchio. The history of the province in the Lombard and Frankish period is poorly documented, but the city of Lodi controlled the important trading route from Milan southwards to Cremona, Piacenza and the lower stretches of the River Lambro.

In 1025, the German emperor, Conrad II, granted certain rights to the Archbishop of Milan which caused land ownership to change and tensions in the region to flare. Allied with the Holy Roman Emperor but independent, Laus Pomperia fought against the Milanesi in the twelfth century, and the city was destroyed in 1111 and again in 1158, which marked the end of the city on the old location. A request made of Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, to rebuild the city near the Adda River was granted. The city, however, joined his opponents, the Lombard League, in 1167. Its citizens fought against Frederick at the Battle of Legnano in 1176. Still, it continued to have problems with Milan (also a member of the Lombard League) until the city was conquered in 1335 by lord of Milan Azzone Visconti.

It remained peaceful until it was invaded in the 1490s. The first significant Italian victory by Napoleon took place in the province on 10 May 1796, where the 5,000 men-strong forces of Napoleon defeated Austrian forces of 10,000 men. It fell under Austrian rule until the Austrians left the city in 1859 and it was ruled by the French forces, led by Marshal Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta, from 10 June 1859. It later became a part of the Kingdom of Italy and became a component of the province of Milan.

==Geography==
The province of Lodi is one of twelve provinces in the region of Lombardy in northwestern Italy. It is about in area and is delineated by rivers; the right bank of the Adda nearly surrounds it, and a further part of the boundary is formed by the left bank of the Lambro and of the Po. The province is bounded on the east by the Province of Cremona, the Metropolitan City of Milan to the north and by the Province of Pavia to the west. The land is mostly gently sloping or flat and the soil is alluvial loam. It is used to grow fodder crops, which are mown up to eight times a year, rice, wheat, maize, sugarbeet and vegetables.

<text>An aroma compound, also known as an odorant, aroma, fragrance or flavoring, is a chemical compound that has a smell or odor. For an individual chemical or class of chemical compounds to impart a smell or fragrance, it must be sufficiently volatile for transmission via the air to the olfactory system in the upper part of the nose. As examples, various fragrant fruits have diverse aroma compounds, particularly strawberries which are commercially cultivated to have appealing aromas, and contain several hundred aroma compounds.

Generally, molecules meeting this specification have molecular weights of less than 310. Flavors affect both the sense of taste and smell, whereas fragrances affect only smell. Flavors tend to be naturally occurring, and the term &quot;fragrances&quot; may also apply to synthetic compounds, such as those used in cosmetics.

Aroma compounds can naturally be found in various foods, such as fruits and their peels, wine, spices, floral scent, perfumes, fragrance oils, and essential oils. For example, many form biochemically during the ripening of fruits and other crops. Wines have more than 100 aromas that form as byproducts of fermentation. Also, many of the aroma compounds play a significant role in the production of compounds used in the food service industry to flavor, improve, and generally increase the appeal of their products.

An odorizer may add a detectable odor to a dangerous odorless substance, like propane, natural gas, or hydrogen, as a safety measure.

== Aroma compounds classified by structure ==

=== Esters ===

=== Linear terpenes ===
=== Cyclic terpenes ===
Note: Carvone, depending on its chirality, offers two different smells.

=== Aromatic ===
=== Amines ===
== Other aroma compounds ==

=== Alcohols ===

* Furaneol (strawberry)
* 1-Hexanol (herbaceous, woody)
* &quot;cis&quot;-3-Hexen-1-ol (fresh cut grass)
* Menthol (peppermint)

=== Aldehydes ===
High concentrations of aldehydes tend to be very pungent and overwhelming, but low concentrations can evoke a wide range of aromas.
* Acetaldehyde (ethereal)
* Hexanal (green, grassy)
* &quot;cis&quot;-3-Hexenal (green tomatoes)
* Furfural (burnt oats)
* Hexyl cinnamaldehyde
* Isovaleraldehyde – nutty, fruity, cocoa-like
* Anisic aldehyde – floral, sweet, hawthorn. It is a crucial component of chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, raspberry, apricot, and others.
* Cuminaldehyde (4-propan-2-ylbenzaldehyde) – Spicy, cumin-like, green

=== Esters ===

* Fructone (fruity, apple-like)
* Ethyl methylphenylglycidate (Strawberry)
* alpha-Methylbenzyl acetate (Gardenia)

=== Ketones ===
* Cyclopentadecanone (musk-ketone)
* Dihydrojasmone (fruity woody floral)
* Oct-1-en-3-one (blood, metallic, mushroom-like)
* 2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline (fresh bread, jasmine rice)
* 6-Acetyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine (fresh bread, tortillas, popcorn)

===Lactones===
* gamma-Decalactone intense peach flavor
* gamma-Nonalactone coconut odor, popular in suntan lotions
* delta-Octalactone creamy note
* Jasmine lactone powerful fatty-fruity peach and apricot
* Massoia lactone powerful creamy coconut
* Wine lactone sweet coconut odor
* Sotolon (maple syrup, curry, fenugreek)

=== Thiols ===

* Thioacetone (2-propanethione) A lightly studied organosulfur. Its smell is so potent it can be detected several hundred meters downwind mere seconds after a container is opened.
* Allyl thiol (2-propenethiol; allyl mercaptan; CH2=CHCH2SH) (garlic volatiles and garlic breath)
* (Methylthio)methanethiol (CH3SCH2SH), the &quot;mouse thiol&quot;, found in mouse urine and functions as a semiochemical for female mice
* Ethanethiol, commonly called ethyl mercaptan (added to propane or other liquefied-petroleum gases used as fuel gases)
* 2-Methyl-2-propanethiol, commonly called &quot;tert&quot;-butyl mercaptan, is added as a blend of other components to natural gas used as fuel gas.
* Butane-1-thiol, commonly called butyl mercaptan, is a chemical intermediate. 
* Grapefruit mercaptan (grapefruit)
* Methanethiol, commonly called methyl mercaptan (after eating Asparagus)
* Furan-2-ylmethanethiol, also called furfuryl mercaptan (roasted coffee)
* Benzyl mercaptan (leek or garlic-like)

=== Miscellaneous compounds ===

* Methylphosphine and dimethylphosphine (garlic-metallic, two of the most potent odorants known)
* Phosphine (zinc phosphide poisoned bait)
* Diacetyl (butter flavor)
* Acetoin (butter flavor)
* Nerolin (orange flowers)
* Tetrahydrothiophene (added to natural gas)
* 2,4,6-Trichloroanisole (cork taint)
* Substituted pyrazines

== Aroma-compound receptors ==

Animals that are capable of smell detect aroma compounds with their olfactory receptors. Olfactory receptors are cell-membrane receptors on the surface of sensory neurons in the olfactory system that detect airborne aroma compounds. Aroma compounds can then be identified by gas chromatography-olfactometry, which involves a human operator sniffing the GC effluent.

In mammals, olfactory receptors are expressed on the surface of the olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity.

== Safety and regulation ==
In 2005–06, fragrance mix was the third-most-prevalent allergen in patch tests (11.5%). &#x27;Fragrance&#x27; was voted Allergen of the Year in 2007 by the American Contact Dermatitis Society. An academic study in the United States published in 2016 has shown that &quot;34.7 % of the population reported health problems, such as migraine headaches and respiratory difficulties, when exposed to fragranced products&quot;.

The composition of fragrances is usually not disclosed in the label of the products, hiding the actual chemicals of the formula, which raises concerns among some consumers. In the United States, this is because the law regulating cosmetics protects trade secrets.

In the United States, fragrances are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration if present in cosmetics or drugs, by the Consumer Products Safety Commission if present in consumer products. No pre-market approval is required, except for drugs. Fragrances are also generally regulated by the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 that &quot;grandfathered&quot; existing chemicals without further review or testing and put the burden of proof that a new substance is not safe on the EPA. The EPA, however, does not conduct independent safety testing but relies on data provided by the manufacturer.

A 2019 study of the top-selling skin moisturizers found 45% of those marketed as &quot;fragrance-free&quot; contained fragrance.

==List of chemicals used as fragrances==
In 2010, the International Fragrance Association published a list of 3,059 chemicals used in 2011 based on a voluntary survey of its members, identifying about 90% of the world&#x27;s production volume of fragrances.

<text>Quinn Martin (born Irwin Martin Cohn; May 22, 1922 – September 5, 1987) was an American television producer. He had at least one television series running in prime time every year for 21 straight years (from 1959 to 1980). Martin is a member of the Television Hall of Fame, having been inducted in 1997.

==Early life==
Born on May 22, 1922, in New York City, Martin was the second of two children. His father, Martin Goodman Cohn, was a film editor and producer at the studios of Metro Goldwyn Mayer; his mother was Anna Messing Cohn. He was of Jewish descent. From the age of 4, he was raised in Los Angeles, California. He graduated from Fairfax High School, then served five years in the United States Army during World War II, enlisting in the Signal Corps at Fort MacArthur in San Pedro, California on September 10, 1940, and achieving the rank of sergeant. He later changed his name to Quinn Martin.

While attending the University of California at Berkeley, Martin majored in English studies but did not graduate. Martin started his career in television as a film editor at MGM, joining his father and also worked as manager of post-production for various organizations, including Universal Studios (1950–1954). By the mid 1950s he had become an executive producer for Desilu Studios, founded by Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. His first wife, Madelyn Pugh Davis, was one half of the writing team behind &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. In 1959, he produced &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, a two-part special that appeared in season 1 of the &quot;Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse&quot;. &quot;The Untouchables&quot; later became a weekly television show on the ABC television network, which would win two Emmy Awards in 1960.

==QM Productions==
In 1960, Martin established his own production company, QM Productions. It produced a string of successful television series during the 1960s and 1970s. The company had kicked off when he signed a deal with ABC to produce television programs, with &quot;The New Breed&quot; being one of the first QM programs. He then scored big when &quot;The Fugitive&quot; premiered in 1963, becoming QM&#x27;s first hit. He then proceeded to sue ABC in 1968, only to be settled two years later in a non-exclusive agreement. In 1976, QM was one of the four television producers who tried launching a syndicated division.

==Quinn Martin television series==

Besides producing sixteen one-hour television network series, he also produced twenty &quot;made-for-TV&quot; movies, including &quot;House on Greenapple Road&quot; (1970), &quot;Incident in San Francisco&quot; (1971), &quot;Murder or Mercy&quot; (1974), &quot;The FBI Story: The FBI vs. Alvin Karpis, Public Enemy Number One&quot; (1974), &quot;Attack on Terror: The FBI vs. the Ku Klux Klan&quot; (1975), and &quot;Brink&#x27;s: The Great Robbery&quot; (1976). Some TV movies, like &quot;Code Name: Diamond Head&quot; (1977), and &quot;The Hunted Lady&quot; (1977), were originally filmed as pilots for new television dramas which were never picked up by the networks. His only feature film was &quot;The Mephisto Waltz&quot; (1971), released by 20th Century Studios.

In 1978, a duo of investors purchased his wholly self-owned QM Productions; they subsequently sold it to Taft Broadcasting in 1979. In 1980, the company launched a pay television division hiring HBO executive Harlem Kleiman as executive. In 1984, QM Productions became Taft Entertainment Television, with the sitcom &quot;The Lucie Arnaz Show&quot; being the first program to carry the new name.

===Typical format of a QM program===
Shows produced by the company were usually introduced by announcer Dick Wesson or Hank Simms reading the title of the series and saying, &quot;A Quinn Martin Production.&quot; Images of the stars of the show, followed by the guest stars for that week, were shown and their names announced, followed by &quot;Tonight&#x27;s episode&quot;, and the name of the episode, with various to-black effects. In some series, such as &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and &quot;The Invaders&quot;, its backstory that led to the plot of the series, narrated by the announcer or the star, was told before the show&#x27;s guest stars were announced. While episodes were structured into the usual four &quot;acts&quot; and an &quot;epilogue,&quot; each was explicitly labelled at the start of each segment with the show title and the act number (or &quot;epilogue&quot; near the end of the program).

==Later life==
Martin worked as an adjunct professor at the University of California at San Diego&#x27;s Earl Warren College, where he also endowed a professorial chair in drama. He also established a scholarship for theater arts and communications students at Santa Clara University Martin moved to Rancho Santa Fe, California, near San Diego where he became president of the La Jolla Playhouse and the Del Mar Fair board of directors. He was involved with developing motion pictures for Warner Bros. with a new company named QM Communications.

==Death==
Martin died of a heart attack on September 5, 1987, in his home in Rancho Santa Fe, California.

==History==

In 1994, a joint venture of Moscow City Telephone Network, T-Mobile and Siemens, which later MTS GSM (Mobile TeleSeratout) became part of Mobile TeleSystems (MTS), offered Russia&#x27;s MTS GSM first mobile phone service &quot;Mobile Telecommunications&quot; () for the public in Moscow. In the same year in June, VimpelCom also started Beeline mobile phone service. MTS, having started Mobile TeleSeratout in the Moscow license zone in 1994, received licenses in 1997 for further areas and began expansion across Russia, later entering other countries of the CIS.

In 2009, MTS acquired several independent mobile retail chains, creating MTS monobrand retail network of 3300 stores — the second largest retail network in Russia. Also in 2009 MTS started marketing MTS-branded mobile handsets. In 2010, MTS became the 5th best selling handset brand in Russia, after Nokia, Samsung, LG and Sony Ericsson.

In 2010, MTS announced the acquisition of 62% of the stock of Comstar, the biggest Russian fixed internet and cable TV provider with 7.5 million of passed households. Comstar products were re-branded to MTS in 2010, forming the largest Russian mobile and fixed telecommunications brand. Until this purchase, MTS was presented at the fixed telephony market through its subsidiary Moscow City Telephone Network (MGTS).

In November 2013, the company has launched the &quot;Home Phone MTS&quot; in Ryazan, Oryol, Kirov, Krasnodar, Rostov-on-Don and Yekaterinburg. The subscription fee for the wired telephone is 100 rubles. Per month, it includes unlimited calls to numbers of local fixed-line operators. The cost of calls to mobile numbers range from 1.1 rubles per minute depending on the region. Prior to that, in several cities such services are also provided by Comstar, a subsidiary of MTS.

During 2012–2013, MTS deployed FTTB network in nearly twenty new cities of the Far East, Siberia, Central, Volga and Ural federal districts. In 2012, MTS launched in cities where the DTV signal standard is DVB-C, and in December 2013, launched a project to provide fixed telephony services to the mass market in the regions.

In 2013, Interregional TransitTelekom won a tender held by MTS to provide IPX services, and became one of the service providers for the company in the international telecommunications market. In November 2013, MTS began offering their Russian customers LTE roaming service, after such agreement were signed first with South Korean operator SK Telecom, and then with Saudi Arabia and Great Britain. Along with the construction of the fixed network, the company launched the DVB-C digital television standard in Ulan-Ude, Blagoveshchensk, Ussuriisk and Nakhodka. In November 2013, MTS completely switched to digital TV by connecting new subscribers, ending the connection to analogue television.

In March 2019, MTS launched an interactive media platform for cyber athletes and gamers called WASD.TV, and a mechanism for selecting players from the Gambit league to professional e-sports teams.

On September 17, 2019, it was revealed that a storage device containing 1.7 terabytes of information related to MTS was exposed to the public internet in a data leak.

From 2019 onwards, MTS has worked on building out its 5G networks in cooperation with Huawei as well as Ericsson and Nokia. In 2021, MTS and Huawei launched 5G networks at 14 pilot sites throughout Moscow, while MTS and Ericsson opened a 5G hub in Saint Petersburg.

In 2022, the company&#x27;s revenue amounted to 392 billion rubles.

In January 2024, MTS, which previously owned a minority stake, increased its stake to 80.58% in the capital of the Urent scooter rental service, which provides services in more than a hundred cities in Russia.

===Branding===
In May 2006, MTS changed their logo as a part of rebranding campaign performed by their parent company, AFK Sistema PAO. The logo now has two red squares next to each other. The left one, common in form (but not colour) to all AFK Sistema PAO&#x27;s telecom subsidiaries, contains a white egg which symbolises simplicity and genius, while the right square bears the name of the company: МТС (MTS). In 2010, MTS announced acquisition of Sistema Telecom, the owners of the MTS &quot;egg&quot; logo, for $380 million, thus becoming the sole owner of the logo.

In 2008, the MTS brand was included in the Top 100 World&#x27;s Most Powerful Brands list by Financial Times/Millward Brown ranking, becoming the most valuable Russian brand. According to this ranking, in 2010 MTS brand was 72nd most valuable brand worldwide with the brand value of $9.7 billion. In 2010, MTS also became the most valuable Russian brand according to the Interbrand ranking.

In Belarus, the MTS trademark renders services of cellular communication and data transmission of &quot;Mobile TeleSystems JLLC (MTS)&quot; (). The founders of this company are Beltelecom (51% of shares) and The Russian Mobile TeleSystems OJSC (49% of shares).

==Former operations==
===MTS Turkmenistan===

On 25 July 2012, MTS signed an agreement with the Turkmentelecom enterprise of Ministry of Communications of Turkmenistan, which says that MTS Turkmenistan will on a monthly basis pay to Turkmentelecom 30% of its net profit derived from operations in Turkmenistan. This agreement is for five years and may be extended another five years subject to some conditions. The company has also been granted GSM and 3G licenses for a three-year term.

MTS Turkmenistan in September 2017 faced termination of the permit to use the dedicated radio frequency spectrum and some other required resources. The provision of communication services to subscribers in Turkmenistan was suspended with network shutdown and no successor. As of 2016, MTS-Turkmenistan had 1.7 million subscribers at its peak.

===MTS Uzbekistan===

Uzdunrobita was the largest mobile phone operator in Uzbekistan in the 1990s and 2000s. Uzdunrobita was founded in 1991, as a joint venture between a group of American investors, the International Communications Group, with a 45% stake; and the government of what was then the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, with a 55% stake. When Uzbekistan declared independence several weeks later, the registration of the joint venture was shifted from Moscow to Tashkent, with the government stake taken over by the independent Uzbek government.

The company first turned a profit in 1993. By 1996, it had $50 million in annual revenues, 7,000 subscribers, and employed 224 staff. Gulnora Karimova gained control of the firm in the late 1990s or early 2000s, and by 2005 it was 74% owned by Russia&#x27;s MTS, which paid $121 million for the stake. In 2006 it was reported to have 250,000 subscribers, ahead of Daewoo Unitel, which had 100,000, and a number of much smaller firms.

The company launched an LTE network on 2.6 GHz in July 2010, and receive a license to expand it on 700 MHz in December 2010.

The brand UMC in Uzbekistan existed until mid-2007, when a major rebranding campaign occurred turning UMC into MTS. In July 2012, authorities in Uzbekistan announced the suspension of the operating license of MTS&#x27;s subsidiary Uzdunrobita. Officials argued that MTS-Uzbekistan has been responsible for a series of technical violations, and its operations have been suspended beginning on the evening of July 17. According to the MTS, the suspension could affect millions of Uzbek mobile phone users. An MTS statement said the firm has some 10 million clients among Uzbekistan&#x27;s population of 28 million.

In August 2012, the government of Uzbekistan revoked the company&#x27;s operating license and arrested several of its top management, citing repeated regulatory violations. MTS protested the action as a &quot;shakedown&quot;, but was unable to effectively oppose it, and moved to write down its stake. At the completion of the case in September 2012, the company&#x27;s assets were seized, and some of its executives sentenced to prison terms.

The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted and declared that Russia was concerned about the situation with Mobile TeleSystems’ Uzbekistan subsidiary Uzdunrobita, after Uzbek authorities suspended the mobile operator&#x27;s license and put a senior official into custody. The dispute, which analysts fear may lead to MTS exiting the market, broke out at the beginning of 2012 when Uzbek authorities launched a near $1.3 million back-tax claim against MTS. MTS said in an e-mailed statement that the actions of the Uzbek authorities may be interpreted as “baseless attacks on the business of the Russian investor.” However, in 2019, The United States Department of Justice charged the firm for bribery to secure contracts in Uzbekistan. MTS agreed to pay a penalty of $850 million.

===MTS India===

In 2008, Sistema formed 74:26 joint venture with India&#x27;s Shyam Group to form Sistema Shyam Teleservices (SSTL), and acquired a pan-India licence to provide CDMA services in the country. In March 2009, SSTL launched the MTS India brand in the state of Tamil Nadu, followed by neighbouring states Kerala and West Bengal in April and May respectively. Following the cancellation of its licences by the Supreme Court of India, MTS is present in 9 circles out of 22 telecom circles of India. MTS India was acquired by Reliance Communications (RCom) on 14 January 2016 in an all-stock deal, in which SSTL received a 10% share in RCom. SSTL was merged into RCom on 31 October 2017.

===MTS Ukraine===

On 31 October 2008, Vodafone announced a partnership deal with MTS, whereby Vodafone services will be available to MTS subscribers and both companies have noted the potential for more efficient purchasing, starting with operations in Ukraine.

In October 2015, Mobile TeleSystems and Vodafone expanded their strategic partnership; this resulted in the rebranding of MTS Ukraine to Vodafone Ukraine. MTS sold its Ukraine operations in 2019.

===MTS Armenia===
In Armenia, services under the MTS brand were provided by K-Telecom CJSC, under the brand names (from 2007-2019) and Viva-MTS (from 2019-2024), 80% of which were owned by Mobile TeleSystems. The number of subscribers of VivaCell-MTS in Armenia by March 31, 2011 was 2.55 million. By May 2011, VivaCell-MTS occupied more than 60% of the mobile market in Armenia, and by December 2017, VivaCell-MTS had 2.1 million subscribers.

In January 2024, it was announced that MTS had sold its Armenian unit to Fedilco Group, selling 100% of its shares.

<doc id="1039080" wikidata="Q35947" url="?curid=1039080" title="Kokborok">
<text>Kokborok(or Tripuri) is a Tibeto-Burman language of the Indian state of Tripura and neighbouring areas of Bangladesh. Its name comes from &quot;kók&quot; meaning &quot;verbal&quot; or &quot;language&quot; and &quot;borok&quot; meaning &quot;people&quot; or &quot;human&quot;, It is one of the ancient languages of Northeast India.

== History ==
Kokborok was formerly known as Tripuri and Tipra kok, with its name being changed in the 20th century. The names also refer to the inhabitants of the former Twipra kingdom, as well as the ethnicity of its speakers.

According to an oral history, Kókborok has been attested since at least the 1st century AD, when the historical record of Tripuri kings began to be written down in a book called the &quot;Rajratnakar&quot; or &quot;Rajmala&quot;, using a script for Kókborok called &quot;Koloma&quot;, by the scholar and priest Durlabendra Chantai (also spelled Durlobendra Chontai). In the early 15th century, under the reign of Dharma Manikya I, two Brahmins, Sukreswar and Vaneswar, compiled a &quot;Rajmala&quot;, translating it into Sanskrit and into Bengali. However, post-independence, the Kokborok records were outlawed and subsequently lost; the main sources for Tripura history are the Sanskrit and Bengali manuscripts.

Kokborok was relegated to a common people&#x27;s dialect during the rule of the Tripuri kings in the Kingdom of Tipra from the 19th century till the 20th century. Kokborok was declared an official language of the state of Tripura, India by the state government in the year 1979. Consequently, the language has been taught in schools of Tripura from the primary level to the higher secondary stage since the 1980s. A certificate course in Kokborok started from 1994 at Tripura University and a post graduate diploma in Kokborok was started in 2001 by the Tripura University. Kokborok was introduced in the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in the colleges affiliated to the Tripura University from the year 2012, and a Master of Arts (MA) degree in Kokborok was started by Tripura University from the year 2015.

There is currently a demand for giving the language recognition as one of the recognized official languages of India as per the 8th schedule of the Constitution. The official form is the dialect spoken in Agartala, the state capital of Tripura.

== Classification and related languages ==
Kokborok is a Sino-Tibetan language of the Bodo–Garo branch.

It is related to the Bodo and Dimasa languages of neighboring Assam. The Garo language is also a related language spoken in the state of Meghalaya and neighboring Bangladesh.

Kókborok consists of several dialects spoken in Tripura. &quot;Ethnologue&quot; lists Usoi (Kau Brung), Riang (Kau Bru), and Khagrachari (&quot;Trippera&quot;) as separate languages; Mukchak (Barbakpur), though not listed, is also distinct, and the language of many Tripuri clans has not been investigated. The greatest variety is within Khagrachari, though speakers of different Khagrachari varieties can &quot;often&quot; understand each other. Khagrachari literature is being produced in the Naitong and Dendak varieties.

== Phonology ==
Kókborok has the phonology of a typical Sino-Tibetan language.

=== Vowels ===
Kokborok has six (monophthong) vowel phonemes: /i u e ə o a/.

Early scholars of Kokborok decided to use the letter w as a symbol for a vowel that does not exist in English. In some localities, it is pronounced closer to [ɨ], and in others, it is pronounced closer to o.

In Kokborok spelling, u is used for the sound in the diphthongs (used initially, spelled ua) and (used finally, spelled uo). It is also used for the diphthong (spelled wi) after m and p.

=== Consonants ===

Ch is used for , while kh, ph, chh and th are used for , , and respectively.

N&#x27; is the pronunciation of the nasal sound, e.g., in&#x27; (&quot;yes&quot;).

Ng is a digraph and is generally used in the last syllable of a word, e.g., aming (&quot;cat&quot;), holong (&quot;stone&quot;).

Ua is often used initially, e.g., uak (&quot;pig&quot;), uah (&quot;bamboo&quot;), uatwi (&quot;rain&quot;).

Uo is often used finally, e.g., thuo (&quot;sleeping&quot;), buo (&quot;beat&quot;).

=== Diphthongs ===
A diphthong is a group of two vowels. The wi diphthong is pronounced ui after /m/ and /p/. Two examples are chumui (&quot;cloud&quot;) and thampui (&quot;mosquito&quot;). The ui diphthong is a variation of the wi diphthong. Other less frequent diphthongs, such as oi and ai, are closing diphthongs.

=== Syllables ===
Most words are formed by combining the root with an affix:
* kuchuk is formed from the root chuk (&quot;to be high&quot;), with the prefix, ku.
* phaidi (&quot;come&quot;) is formed from the root phai (&quot;to come&quot;), with the suffix di.

There are no Kókborok words beginning with ng. At the end of a syllable, any vowel except &quot;w&quot; can be found, along with a limited number of consonants: &quot;p&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;ng&quot;, &quot;r&quot; and &quot;l&quot;. is found only in closing diphthongs like &quot;ai&quot; and &quot;wi&quot;.

=== Clusters ===
&quot;Clusters&quot; are a group of consonants at the beginning of a syllable, like &quot;phl&quot;, &quot;ph&quot; + &quot;l&quot;, in phlat phlat (&quot;very fast&quot;), or &quot;sl&quot; in kungsluk kungsluk (&quot;foolish man&quot;). Clusters are quite impossible at the end of a syllable. There are some &quot;false clusters&quot; such as phran (&quot;to dry&quot;) which is actually phw-ran. These are very common in echo words: phlat phlat, phre phre, prai prai, prom prom, etc.

=== Tone ===
There are two tones in Kókborok: high tone and low tone. To mark the high tone, the letter &quot;h&quot; is written after the vowel with the high tone. These examples have low tone preceding high tone to show that tone changes the meaning:
# &quot;lai&quot; easy &quot;laih&quot; crossed
# &quot;bor&quot; senseless &quot;bohr&quot; to plant
# &quot;cha&quot; correct &quot;chah&quot; to eat
# &quot;nukhung&quot; family &quot;nukhuhng&quot; roof

== Grammar ==
There is a clear-cut difference between nouns and verbs. All true verbs are made with a verbal root followed by a number of suffixes, which are placed not randomly but according to definite rules.

=== Morphology ===
Morphologically Kókborok words can be divided into five categories. They are the following.

# Original words: &quot;thang&quot;-go; &quot;phai&quot;-come; &quot;borok&quot;-nation; &quot;bororok-men&quot; &quot;kotor&quot;-big; &quot;kuchuk&quot;-high; &quot;kwrwi&quot;-not; etc.
# Compound words, that is, words made of more than one original words: &quot;nai&quot;-see; &quot;thok&quot;-tasty; &quot;naithok&quot;-beautiful; &quot;mwtai&quot;-God; &quot;nok&quot;-house; &quot;tongthar&quot;-religion; &quot;bwkha&quot;-heart; &quot;bwkhakotor&quot;-brave; etc.
# Words with suffixes: &quot;swrwng&quot;-learn; &quot;swrwngnai&quot;-learner; &quot;nukjak&quot;-seen; &quot;kaham&quot;-good; &quot;hamya&quot;- bad; etc.
# Naturalized loan words: &quot;gerogo&quot;-to roll; &quot;gwdna&quot;-neck; &quot;tebil&quot;- table; &quot;poitu&quot;-faith; etc.
# Loan words: &quot;kiching&quot;-friend; etc.

== Numbers ==
Counting in Kókborok is called &quot;lekhamung&quot;.

== Dialects ==
There are many Kokborok-speaking people in the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura, Assam, and Mizoram. But, there are also speakers in the neighboring provinces in the country of Bangladesh, mainly in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. 

There are three main dialects of Kokborok, which are mutually intelligible. The standard one is Debbarma (Puratan Tripuri), which is spoken by the royal family and is understood by all the dialect groups. It is the medium of instruction up to class five and is taught as a subject up to graduate level. The two other major dialects are Riang (or Reang) and Noatia. Smaller dialects are Jamatia, Koloi and Rupini.

== Literature ==
The first efforts of writing Kokborok were made by Radhamohan Thakur. He wrote the grammar of Kokborok named &quot;Kókborokma&quot; published in 1900, as well as two other books: &quot;Tripur Kothamala&quot; and &quot;Tripur Bhasabidhan&quot;. Tripur Kothamala was the Kokborok-Bengali-English translation book published in 1906. The &quot;Tripur Bhasabidhan&quot; was published in 1907.

Daulot Ahmed was a contemporary of Radhamohan Thakur and was a pioneer of writing Kókborok Grammar jointly with Mohammad Omar. The Amar jantra, Comilla published his Kókborok grammar book &quot;KOKBOKMA&quot; in 1897.

On 27 December 1945 the &quot;Tripura Janasiksha Samiti&quot; came into being, and it established many schools in different areas of Tripura.

The first Kókborok magazine &quot;Kwtal Kothoma&quot; was edited and published in 1954 by Sudhanya Deb Barma, who was a founder of the Samiti. &quot;Hachuk Khurio&quot; (In the lap of Hills) by Sudhanya Deb Barma is the first modern Kókborok novel. It was published by the Kókborok Sahitya Sabha and Sanskriti Samsad in 1987. One major translation of the 20th century was the &quot;Smai Kwtal&quot;, the New Testament of the Bible in Kókborok language, published in 1976 by the Bible Society of India.

The 21st century began for Kókborok literature with the monumental work, the Anglo-Kókborok-Bengali Dictionary compiled by Binoy Deb Barma and published in 2002 A.D. by the Kókborok tei Hukumu Mission. This is the 2nd edition of his previous groundbreaking dictionary published in 1996 and is a trilingual dictionary. Twiprani Laihbuma (The Rajmala – History of Tripura) translated by R. K. Debbarma and published in 2002 by KOHM.

The full Holy Bible in Kokborok language was finally published for the first time in the year 2013 by the Bible Society of India. The Baibel Kwthar is currently the largest work and biggest book published in the language with more than 1,300 pages and is now the benchmark for publications in the language.

The present trend of development of the Kokborok literary works show that Kokborok literature is moving forward slowly but steadily with its vivacity and distinctive originality to touch the rich literature of the rich languages.

== Script ==

Kokborok had a script known as &quot;Koloma&quot;, developed in the 1st century CE and used by the Royal Family of Tripura. The Rajratnakar is believed to have originally been written in Koloma. This script fell out of use after the 14th century, and is widely considered to have been lost.

From the 19th century, the Kingdom of Twipra used the Bengali script to write in Kokborok, but since the independence of India and the merger with India, the Roman script is being promoted by non-governmental organizations. The Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council government made regulations in 1992 and 2000 for adoption of the Roman script in the school education system in its areas.

The script issue is highly politicized, with the Left Front government advocating usage of the Bengali script and all the regional indigenous parties and student organizations (INPT, IPFT, NCT, Twipra Students Federation, etc.) and ethnic nationalist organizations (Kokborok Sahitya Sabha, Kokborok tei Hukumu Mission, Movement for Kokborok etc.) advocating for the Roman script. Both scripts are now used in the state in education as well as in literary and cultural circles. Proposals have previously been made for the adoption of scripts other than the Bengali or Roman scripts, such as Ol Chiki. There have also been scripts created specifically for Kokborok in modern times.

<doc id="1039090" wikidata="Q582996" url="?curid=1039090" title="Mike Connors">
<text>Krekor Ohanian (August 15, 1925 – January 26, 2017), known professionally as Mike Connors, was an American actor. He was best known for playing private detective Joe Mannix in the CBS television series &quot;Mannix&quot; from 1967 to 1975. This role earned him a Golden Globe Award in 1970, the first of six straight nominations, as well as four consecutive Emmy nominations from 1970 to 1973. He starred in the short-lived series &quot;Tightrope!&quot; (1959–1960) and &quot;Today&#x27;s FBI&quot; (1981–1982). Connors&#x27; acting career spanned 56 years. In addition to his work on television, he appeared in numerous films, including &quot;Sudden Fear&quot; (1952), &quot;Good Neighbor Sam&quot; (1964), &quot;Situation Hopeless... But Not Serious&quot; (1965), &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1966), &quot;Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die&quot; (1966), and &quot;Too Scared to Scream&quot; (1985), which he also produced.

==Early life==
Connors was born Krekor Ohanian Jr. () on August 15, 1925, in Fresno, California, to Armenian parents Krekor and Alice (née Surabian; ) Ohanian. His father had escaped the Armenian genocide. They married in 1915 and had six children: Paul I (died in childhood), Paul II, Dorothy M., Arpesri A., Krekor, and Eugene. His father was an attorney and represented many Armenians who had little money and could not speak English. Connors spoke three languages: Armenian, English, and French. Connors was a cousin of French-Armenian singer Charles Aznavour.

Connors was an avid basketball player in high school, nicknamed &quot;Touch&quot; by his teammates. During World War II, he served as an enlisted man in the United States Army Air Forces. After the war, he attended the University of California at Los Angeles on both a basketball scholarship and the G.I. Bill, where he played under coach John Wooden. Connors went to law school, where he studied to become an attorney, taking after his father. He was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity.

After a basketball game, coach Wilbur Johns introduced Connors to his friend, director William A. Wellman, who liked Connors&#x27; voice and expressive face while he was playing basketball, and encouraged him to consider acting. He was considered for the role of Tarzan by casting director Ruth Burch, who found him an acting coach.

After Connors became an actor, his agent Henry Willson thought the name &quot;Ohanian&quot; was too similar to the actor George O&#x27;Hanlon and gave him the stage name &quot;Touch Connors&quot; based on his basketball nickname. Willson considered &quot;Connors&quot; to be a &quot;good all-American name.&quot; Connors later stated he hated the name &quot;from day one&quot; and considered not using his real name the only big regret of his career. After getting the starring role in &quot;Tightrope!&quot;, Connors wanted to be credited as Ohanian, but Columbia Pictures told him that he had already done too much work as Connors, though he was allowed to change his first name to Mike.

==Career==

===Early roles===

Connors&#x27;s film career started in the early 1950s, when he made his acting debut in a supporting role opposite Joan Crawford and Jack Palance in the thriller &quot;Sudden Fear&quot; (1952). He had initially been rejected for an audition by producer Joseph Kaufman due to his lack of experience, but after sneaking into Republic Pictures and meeting director David Miller, Connors was given a chance to read the script and was offered the part.

Connors was cast in the John Wayne film, &quot;Island in the Sky&quot;, in which he played a crewman on one of the search-and-rescue planes. In 1956, he played an Amalekite herder in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;.

Connors appeared in numerous television series, including the co-starring role in the 1955 episode &quot;Tomas and the Widow&quot; of the anthology series &quot;Frontier&quot;. He guest-starred on the early sitcoms, &quot;Hey, Jeannie!&quot; and &quot;The People&#x27;s Choice&quot; and in two Rod Cameron syndicated crime dramas, &quot;City Detective&quot; and the Western-themed &quot;State Trooper&quot;, and played the villain in the first episode filmed (but second one aired) of ABC&#x27;s smash hit &quot;Maverick&quot;, opposite James Garner in 1957.

Connors had roles in several of the earliest films Roger Corman directed: &quot;Five Guns West&quot; (1955), &quot;The Day the World Ended&quot; (1955), &quot;Swamp Women&quot; (1956), and &quot;The Oklahoma Woman&quot; (1956). Connors starred in and was the executive producer of &quot;Flesh and the Spur&quot; (1956). He raised $117,000 for the film.

In 1958, Connors appeared in the title role of the episode &quot;Simon Pitt&quot;, the series finale of the NBC Western &quot;Jefferson Drum&quot;, starring Jeff Richards as a frontier newspaper editor. He appeared in another NBC Western series, &quot;The Californians&quot;. That same year, Connors was cast as Miles Borden, a corrupt US Army lieutenant bitter over his $54 monthly pay, on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Wagon Train&quot; in the episode &quot;The Dora Gray Story&quot; with Linda Darnell in the title role. About this time, he also appeared on an episode of NBC&#x27;s Western series &quot;Cimarron City&quot;.

Other syndicated series in which he appeared were &quot;The Silent Service&quot;, based on true stories of the submarine section of the United States Navy; &quot;Sheriff of Cochise&quot;, a Western series; &quot;Whirlybirds&quot;, an aviation adventure series; and &quot;Rescue 8&quot;, based on stories of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. An episode of &quot;Studio 57&quot; starring Connors and titled &quot;Getaway Car&quot; was proposed as a pilot for a series about the CHP to be called &quot;Motorcycle Cop&quot;.

Connors starred as an undercover police officer who infiltrated organized crime in &quot;Tightrope!&quot; (1959–1960). Despite the show&#x27;s popularity, it was canceled after only one season. Connors stated in an interview that the show&#x27;s primary sponsor, J.B. Williams, refused CBS president James Aubrey&#x27;s request to move it to a later time slot on a different day. The sponsor dropped &quot;Tightrope!&quot; and underwrote another program on another network. Connors also did not agree with the suggested change to add a sidekick, to be played by Don Sullivan. He thought the program would lose the suspense element, &quot;Because the whole premise was this guy, all by himself, &#x27;on a tightrope.&#x27; ... When he gets a sidekick, it loses the threat and the danger, and the whole premise is in the toilet.&quot;

Later, he was cast in the episode &quot;The Aerialist&quot; of the anthology series, &quot;Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond&quot;. In 1963, he guest-starred as Jack Marson in the episode &quot;Shadow of the Cougar&quot; on the NBC modern Western series, &quot;Redigo&quot;, starring Richard Egan. In 1964, Connors appeared in a pinch-hit role for Raymond Burr as attorney Joe Kelly in the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; episode, &quot;The Case of the Bullied Bowler&quot;. Connors was invited to take on a lead role in the series on an ongoing basis, but the producers had actually wanted to pressure Burr into resigning his contract with the series.

In 1964, Connors had a role in the Jack Lemmon comedy &quot;Good Neighbor Sam&quot;, and was the leading man to Susan Hayward and Bette Davis in &quot;Where Love Has Gone&quot;. He co-starred with Robert Redford in one of his earliest film roles, the World War II black comedy &quot;Situation Hopeless... But Not Serious&quot; (1965), in which Connors and Redford played American soldiers taken prisoner by a German villager played by Alec Guinness. Connors played the card sharp in the remake of &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1966).

Connors was strongly considered to play Matt Helm in &quot;The Silencers&quot; (1966), but that role had eventually gone to Dean Martin. However, his audition had impressed Columbia Pictures, so Connors was instead cast in the similar James Bond spoof film &quot;Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die&quot; (1966). Connors himself performed the stuntwork of dangling from a rope ladder attached to a helicopter flying off the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro when the local stuntman refused to do it.

===&quot;Mannix&quot;===

Connors became best known for playing the private investigator Joe Mannix in the detective series &quot;Mannix&quot;. The series ran for eight seasons from 1967 to 1975. During the first season of the series, Joe Mannix worked for Intertect, a large Los Angeles detective agency run by his superior Lew Wickersham (Joseph Campanella). From the second season onward, Mannix opened his own detective agency and is assisted by his secretary Peggy Fair (Gail Fisher).

&quot;Mannix&quot; was originally produced by Desilu Productions (later absorbed by Paramount Television). Then-president Lucille Ball pushed for CBS to keep the show on the air by removing the high-tech computers and making Mannix an independent detective. This move enabled the show to become a long-running hit for the network.
Connors performed his own stunts on the series. During the filming of the pilot episode, he broke his wrist and dislocated his shoulder.

Joe Mannix was an Armenian American, like Connors. He spoke Armenian in a number of episodes and often quoted Armenian proverbs.

In 1970, Connors won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series Drama. He was nominated for the Golden Globe Award six times from 1970 to 1975 and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series four times from 1970 to 1973.

When discussing the success of the series in an interview, Connors stated: &quot;The show itself started a whole new era of detective shows, because this wasn&#x27;t the usual cynical private eye &quot;à la&quot; Humphrey Bogart. It was more a show about an all-round normal human being. The character of Joe Mannix could be taken advantage of by a pretty face, he could shed a tear on an emotional level, he was very close to his father and his family, so he was more a normal personality with normal behavior.&quot;

Connors was able to work with his boss Lucille Ball on-screen during a cross-promotion episode of her &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; series in 1971. The episode, which opened Lucy&#x27;s fourth season, is titled &quot;Lucy and Mannix are Held Hostage&quot;. This was notable as the first episode shot at Universal Studios, after Ball ceased producing her program at Paramount Studios.

&quot;Mannix&quot; remained a hit show through its final season. The show was taken off the air due to a dispute between CBS and Paramount. Paramount had sold the rights to air &quot;Mannix&quot; reruns to rival network ABC without informing CBS. When CBS discovered the deal, the executives quickly decided to cancel &quot;Mannix&quot; to avoid losing viewership for new episodes to the reruns.

He later reprised the role of Joe Mannix in a 1997 episode of &quot;&quot; and in the 2003 comedy film &quot;Nobody Knows Anything!&quot;

===Later career===

He narrated J. Michael Hagopian&#x27;s 1975 documentary film &quot;The Forgotten Genocide&quot;, one of the first full-length features on the Armenian genocide. The documentary was nominated for two Emmys. In 1995, Connors narrated another Armenian documentary by Hagopian, &quot;Ararat Beckons&quot;.

In 1976, Connors played Karl Ohanian in the television film &quot;The Killer Who Wouldn&#x27;t Die&quot;. Producers and writers Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts, who were also producers for &quot;Mannix&quot;, wanted the character to have Connors&#x27; real last name. The film was intended to be the pilot for a new ABC series titled &quot;Ohanian&quot;, about an Armenian-American former homicide detective who is now a charter-boat skipper. However, the series was not picked up.

Connors had roles in the thriller films &quot;Avalanche Express&quot; (1979) and &quot;Nightkill&quot; (1980). He starred as a bureau veteran who mentors a team of agents in &quot;Today&#x27;s FBI&quot; (1981–1982). The series only lasted one season. Connors both starred in and produced the independent horror film &quot;Too Scared to Scream&quot; (1985).

He played Colonel Harrison &quot;Hack&quot; Peters in the 1988 miniseries &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;. Connors hosted the 1989 series &quot;Crimes of the Century&quot;. He voiced the character Chipacles in the Disney animated series &quot;Hercules&quot; from 1998 to 1999.

Connors&#x27; final appearance was in a 2007 &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; episode, as a love interest of Evelyn Harper&#x27;s (Holland Taylor).
==Personal life==
Connors married Mary Lou Willey on September 10, 1949, when they were both UCLA students. They had two children, a son, Matthew Gunnar Ohanian, and a daughter, Dana Lee Connors. Matthew was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 15. Matthew predeceased his father, dying of heart failure in 2007. Through his daughter Dana, he had one granddaughter.

After his son&#x27;s diagnosis, Connors became active in charitable organizations for patients diagnosed with mental disorders. He was a spokesperson for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. In 1998, the UC Irvine College of Medicine&#x27;s Brain Imaging Center Committee awarded Connors the Silver Ribbon Award for his contributions.

Connors made a public service announcement for the Armenian Eye Care Project.

Connors was a Republican. He endorsed Ronald Reagan for President in 1980 and 1984 and endorsed George Deukmejian for Governor of California in 1982 and 1986.

==Death==
Connors died in Tarzana, California, at the age of 91 on January 26, 2017, a week after being diagnosed with leukemia.

<text>The Adams-Wilson Hobbycopter (later named the Adams-Wilson Choppy) is a small, single-seat, open-framework helicopter designed for homebuilding, to be powered by a motorcycle engine.

==Design and development==
The Adams-Wilson company was formed by T.G. Adams and Paul Wilson to market plans for a simple single-seat helicopter named the HobbyCopter, of which they have built a prototype. This prototype flew successfully for the first time in November 1958. Plans were first marketed in 1958 and have been revised and revived by various designers over the years.

The Hobbycopter, (also colloquially known as the Flying Triumph), was designed to use commonly found materials that were readily available to customers. The Hobbycopter was designed to use a motorcycle engine of about and a variety engines have been used, including a snowmobile motor and more recently, an ultralight 2-cycle Rotax 503 engine developing .

The aircraft is available in the form of plans and some key parts for amateur construction from Vortech of Fallston, Maryland.

==Variants==
;Hobbycopter XH-1: The prototype of the one-man open framework homebuilt helicopter powered by a Triumph motorcycle engine.
;Hobbycopter 101:Production version of the XH-1 offered as a kit for $900, or as plans for $35 to homebuilders.
;Hobbycopter 102:Strengthened Model 101 with Triumph and a fibre-glass cockpit enclosure.

<text>Victor Gustave Plarr (21 June 1863 – 28 January 1929) was an English poet; he is probably best known for the poem &quot;Epitaphium Citharistriae&quot;.

==Life==
He was born near Strasbourg, France, of a French father from Alsace, Gustave Plarr, and an English mother, Mary Jane Tomkins, third daughter of the banker Samuel Tomkins. He was brought up in Scotland and England after his family moved at the time of the Franco-Prussian War. He was educated at Madras College, St Andrews and Tonbridge School. He matriculated at the University of Oxford in 1882. He went on to read history at Worcester College, graduating B.A. in 1886.

Plarr worked as a librarian, first (from 1890) at King&#x27;s College London, then at the Royal College of Surgeons of England from 1897 until his death. The following year, the first two volumes of &quot;Lives of the Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons&quot; were published under the editorship of D&#x27;Arcy Power. Often known as &quot;Plarr&#x27;s Lives of the Fellows&quot;, the biographies of the original 300 fellows are considered an early social history of English medicine.

In 1891 Plarr edited the 13th edition of &quot;Men of the Time&quot;, changing its title to &quot;Men and Women of the Time&quot;.

Plarr was a founding member of the Rhymers&#x27; Club. A generally uncongenial figure, he was befriended in 1909 by Ezra Pound, who enjoyed Plarr&#x27;s tales of the &quot;decadent nineties&quot;.

<text>The province of Mantua (; Mantuan, Lower Mantuan: ; Upper Mantuan: ) is a province in the Lombardy region of Italy. Its capital is the city of Mantua. It is bordered to the north-east by the province of Verona, to the east by the province of Rovigo, to the south by the province of Ferrara, province of Modena, province of Reggio Emilia, and province of Parma, to the west by the province of Cremona, and to the north-west by the province of Brescia.

==History==
Founded in the tenth century BCE on the plain formed by meanders of the River Mincio, Mantua became an Etruscan town and important trading post for pottery and agricultural products. Despite its defensible position, it was unable to withstand the Celtic invaders in the sixth and fifth centuries BC who overwhelmed it, and the whole area was later conquered by the Romans.

By the fifth century CE, the Western Roman Empire was collapsing. Mantua was overrun by a series of invaders, including the Visigoths, Vandals, and Ostrogoths. After 568 the Lombards seized control of the part of northern Italy which is now known as Lombardy and included Mantua.

The current administrative boundaries of the province have deep historical roots, corresponding largely to the Duchy of Mantua, which was a fief of the Holy Roman Empire. The Napoleonic Department of the Mincio became the Province of Mantua at the birth of the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia in 1815. Following the Battle of Solferino on 24 June 1859, Franco-Piedmontese troops conquered Lombardy up to the right bank of the Mincio, and the resulting Armistice of Villafranca of 11 June 1859 between France and Austria called for the new provincial boundaries, splitting in two the part of the previous Province of Mantova that was crossed by the new international border. Following the Third Italian War of Independence all of Mantua passed to the Kingdom of Italy. The new provincial boundaries came into effect after laws enacted in 1868. The coat of arms of the province, containing the symbols of Mantua, Bozzolo and Castiglione delle Stiviere, embodies the union of those three areas and was adopted in place of the previous one.

==Geography==
The Province of Mantua is bounded by several rivers. To the west, the River Oglio provides the border with the Province of Cremona. To the south it is bounded by the River Po, on the other side of which are the provinces of Ferrara, Modena, Reggio Emilia and Parma. To the east the River Mincio provides the border with the Province of Verona and the Province of Rovigo, and to the northwest lies the Province of Brescia. The total area of the province is . The River Po is subject to flooding and much of the bank is raised by levees.

==Protected areas==

There are a number of nature reserves and protected areas in the province. The Parco regionale del Mincio was established on 8 September 1984 with an area of approximately 16,000 hectares. It includes several nature reserves and has a range of habitats including moraines, hills, plains, and the meandering riverbeds in the complex of lakes of Mantua. Birds found in the park include storks, herons, purple herons, egrets, night herons, kingfishers, bee-eaters, coots, moorhens, peregrine falcons, hawks, great crested grebe and black kite.

The Parco dell&#x27;Oglio Sud is another regional park that lies on the boundary of the province with the province of Cremona. It was established in 1988 and has an area of about 12,800 hectares. It is a river park that runs along the stretch of the river Oglio which forms the boundary. It lies to the south of Lake Iseo and the administrative centre is at Calvatone. Birds present in this park include great egret, grey heron, Montagu&#x27;s harrier, Eurasian scops owl, bearded reedling, woodcock, barred warbler, crested lark, sedge warbler, moustached warbler, little egret, Eurasian hobby and ferruginous duck.

The Riserva naturale Bosco Fontana is a state nature reserve with an area of about 23,300 hectares. It is a wooded area that is a remnant of the natural forests that covered the Po valley in ancient times. It is a dense marshy forest composed mainly of Turkey oaks, pedunculate oaks, hornbeams, limes, poplars, elms and alders, which are accompanied by numerous species of shrubby undergrowth. There are glades with abundant wildflowers and fungi flourish among the trees, an important factor being the richness of the groundwater. Among the mammals found in the reserve are the least weasel, beech marten and European polecat, and the birds include the common buzzard, the great spotted woodpecker and the Eurasian wryneck.

==Government==


The Province of Mantua is an administrative body of intermediate level between a municipality (&quot;comune&quot;) and Lombardy region.

The three main functions devolved to the Province of Mantua are:
* local planning and zoning;
* provision of local police and fire services;
* transportation regulation (car registration, maintenance of local roads, etc.).

As an administrative institution, the Province of Mantua has its own elected bodies. From 1948 to 1993 the President of the Province of Mantua was chosen by the members of the Provincial Council, elected every five years by citizens. From 1993 to 2016, under provisions of the 1993 local administration reform, the President of the Province was chosen by popular election, originally every four, then every five years.

On 3 April 2014, the Italian Chamber of Deputies gave its final approval to the Law n.56/2014 which involves the transformation of the Italian provinces into &quot;institutional bodies of second level&quot;. According to the 2014 reform, each province is headed by a President (or Commissioner) assisted by a legislative body, the Provincial Council, and an executive body, the Provincial Executive. President (Commissioner) and members of Council are elected together by mayors and city councilors of each municipality of the province respectively every four and two years. The Executive is chaired by the President (Commissioner) who appoint others members, called &quot;assessori&quot;. Since 2016, the President (Commissioner) and other members of the Council do not receive a salary.

In each province, there is also a Prefect (&quot;prefetto&quot;), a representative of the central government who heads an agency called &quot;prefettura-ufficio territoriale del governo&quot;. The Questor (&quot;questore&quot;) is the head of State&#x27;s Police (&quot;Polizia di Stato&quot;) in the province and his office is called &quot;questura&quot;. There is also a province&#x27;s police force depending from local government, called provincial police (&quot;polizia provinciale&quot;).

This is a partial list of the Presidents of the Province since 1975:

;Notes
==Economy==

Despite Mantuan landscape is primarily an agricultural one and the primary sector accounted for the 6% of local GDP in 2003, much above Italian average, the province has an historically strong industrial sector, which accounts for 37% of the GDP, while the tertiary sector holds the remaining 56%. Overall, the gross domestic product of the province was estimated in 2003 at over €10 billion.

The productivity of agriculture is enhanced by a well-developed use of fertilizers and the traditional abundance of water. It is largely flat and the soil is very fertile and is intensively irrigated, boosted since the Middle Ages by the construction of a wide net of irrigation canals which were partly designed by Leonardo da Vinci. Crops grown include wheat, maize, rice, sugar beet, potatoes and vegetables. Olives, grapes, chestnuts and many other sorts of fruit are grown; mulberry plants are grown for their contribution to silk production, or sericulture. The lower plains are characterized by fodder crops, which are mowed up to eight times a year. Cattle are also bred and cheese and other dairy products are manufactured. The main exports from the province include cereals, rice, cheese and silk, but most industrial goods need to be imported.

<text>La Garenne-Colombes () is a commune in the northwestern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from Notre Dame de Paris, France&#x27;s kilometre zero.

==Name==
The commune used to be part of the neighbouring city of Colombes. At this time, before 1910, it was called &quot;La Garenne de Colombes&quot;, literally &quot;the warren of doves&quot;.

The explanation for the city being called &quot;warren&quot; is that it used to be a warren where people would hunt. But this dates back to the French monarchy, in the 18th century and before.

==Geography==
La Garenne-Colombes is usually simply called &quot;La Garenne&quot;, and nicknamed &quot;petit Neuilly&quot;.

===Surroundings===
Four towns surround La Garenne-Colombes: Colombes (North), Bois-Colombes (East), Courbevoie (South) and Nanterre (West). The city is quite small compared with the other cities in the Hauts-de-Seine, it is more or less as small as the first arrondissement of Paris. Very close to La Garenne-Colombes are La Défense and the Île de la Jatte island (Bowl Island).

===Transportation===
La Garenne-Colombes is served by two stations on the Transilien Paris – Saint-Lazare suburban rail line: La Garenne-Colombes and Les Vallées (this last station is located at the border between the commune of La Garenne-Colombes and the commune of Bois-Colombes, with a postal address in La Garenne-Colombes). The train has been used there since 1837.

The two stations directly join Paris&#x27;s most important urban station (Gare Saint-Lazare) in 10 minutes and the largest university in Paris (Paris Ouest La Défense University, Western Paris University La Défense) in 2 minutes.

In 1935, five Tramway lines crossed La Garenne-Colombes.

Many RATP Bus lines also cross the city: lines 73, 161, 163, 164, 176, 178, 262, 272, 278, 358 and 378.

Two RATP Noctilien night Bus lines cross the city: N24 and N152.

In 2012, the line 2 of the Parisian Tramway will cross La Garenne-Colombes, with two stations: Les Fauvelles (French for Wildcats) and Charlebourg. To join the center of the CBD, 2 to 4 minutes will be required by tramway.

==History==
It was named in 1240 as &quot;La Garenne dépendant de Colombes&quot; (&quot;La Garenne depending on Colombes&quot;). After the Bourbon Restoration in 1815, the estate was bought by Peter Urban Sartoris, a Genevois banker who had lived in London for many years. On his death in 1833 it was inherited by his 6 children, who urbanised it and named the rue Sartoris. They sold the last of their interests in 1865.

The commune of La Garenne-Colombes was created on 2 May 1910 by detaching its territory from the commune of Colombes.

==Demography==

As the commune&#x27;s territory is entirely built up, population can only grow if buildings are demolished and replaced by bigger buildings for more people (higher, less gardens). Thereby the population will grow certainly over the 30,000 after many reconstructions in the &quot;Champs-Philippe&quot; neighbourhood, with a density over .

According to statistics, La Garenne-Colombes is an average city of the Hauts-de-Seine department (Paris region), which is one of the richest places in Europe.

==Economy==

The landscape looks like an American CBD (Central Business District). But this is in the suburbs of Paris, which do not look like the downtown Paris districts surrounding the Eiffel Tower or the Champs-Elysées. Paradoxically, the most advanced part of the city of Paris, geographically speaking, is on the outskirts of the city itself.

There used to be many workshops in La Garenne-Colombes, as in a large part of the Hauts-de-Seine department. Today, it is mainly a residential city. However, some 1200 business units are there.

===Tertiary activity===

The service industry is paramount in the economy of La Garenne-Colombes. The proximity of La Défense increases this phenomenon. There is:

* Peugeot study offices
* Boston Scientific International
* RATP&#x27;s Charlebourg center

The arrival of the Tramway in 2012 resulted in a redevelopment of a part of the city, and should bring a new breath of life to the local economy.

==Urbanism==

===The city===
In spite of the proximity of La Défense and Paris which has applied a strong pressure, no big buildings were built in La Garenne. Residential buildings (detached homes and apartment buildings) account for the majority of the building stock in La Garenne-Colombes. Many of these buildings were constructed in the early 1900s. In a large part of the town, new construction is limited to 4 floors.

The neighbourhood of the place de Belgique and National boulevard, which is the entry of La Défense, is being redeveloped.

===Green ways===
Eight green ways are in La Garenne-Colombes, exactly:
* two public squares
* two gardens
* four parks

===Commonly known places===
* Place de la Liberté (Freedom square), known under the name of place du marché (market) or place de l&#x27;Eglise (church)
* Place du Général Leclerc, known under the name of place de la Fontaine (Fountain plaza)
* Place de Belgique (Belgium square)
* Rond-point du Souvenir français, known under the name of place Jean Baillet
* Rond-point de l&#x27;Europe (Europe&#x27;s plaza)

==Politics and administration==

===List of mayors===
===Twin towns - sister cities===
La Garenne-Colombes is twinned with:
* Wangen im Allgäu, Germany
* Yokneam Illit, Israel
* Harissa-Daraoun, Lebanon
* Valpaços, Portugal

===Education===

The commune has four public preschools and five public elementary schools.
* Primary schools: René Guest, André Marsault, Ernest Renan (built in 1905), Sainte Geneviève, Sagot Voltaire
* Junior high school: Les Vallées
* Junior high school: Champs-Philippe (previously named after Kléber Haedens, the name was revoked by the Hauts-de-Seine general council due to Haedens having been a nazi collaborationist)
* Vocational senior high school: Lycée La Tournelle

Students wishing to attend a general high school may go to Lycée Albert-Camus in Bois-Colombes or Lycée Paul-Lapie in Courbevoie.

The city owns a castle in Normandy where students are sometimes sent for class-holidays.

==Life in La Garenne-Colombes==

<text>Bad Company, Bad Company UK or simply BC (stylized as ᑐᗴ|ᗱᑕ) is the stage name of the English drum and bass record producers Jason Maldini (Maldini), Michael Wojcicki (Vegas), Dan Stein (DJ Fresh) and Darren White (dBridge).

The abbreviation of the name, ᑐᗴ|ᗱᑕ, is the group&#x27;s logo as used on singles and album covers: the letters BC are mirrored on a vertical line (written as the letter I or as the pipe symbol |), where the reversed B looks like the number three or letter E, and the reversed C looks like an open-backed D or a right parenthesis. It is not uncommon to find the band referred to by the malaprop &quot;DEIBC.&quot;
 More recent releases have doubled the upright bar of the B, resulting in ᑐᗴ||ᗱᑕ.
==History==

They formed in 1998 as &quot;Bad Company&quot; from the ashes of Renegade Hardware acts Future Forces Inc (dBridge and Maldini) and Absolute Zero (DJ Fresh), although they had also worked together in various configurations: Stein, White and Maldini released The Code as &quot;Absolute Zero &amp; Subphonics&quot; on Renegade Hardware; Stein and Wojcicki released Otto&#x27;s Way as &quot;Fresh &amp; Vegas&quot; on Metro Recordings,

The group is known in the drum and bass industry for their 12&quot; single, &quot;The Nine&quot; / &quot;The Bridge&quot; (BCR001), which was later remastered and released again as &quot;The Nine (Remastered)&quot; in 2014. Bad Company went on to produce four albums and various singles which were acclaimed with similar success. 

* Inside the Machine (2000)
* Digital Nation (2000)
* Shot Down on Safari (2002)
* Ice Station Zero (2018)

&quot;Book of the Bad&quot; (2001), a compilation album of their three &quot;Book of the Bad&quot; vinyl EPs, featuring &quot;Miami Flashback&quot;, &quot;Planet Dust&quot; (originally released on Prototype Recordings), and &quot;Mind Games&quot;. 

The name Bad Company has been in disuse since about 2005, but the artists still work in the scene. Fresh had left Bad Company to pursue several solo projects under different record labels, such as Breakbeat Kaos, Ram Records, V Recordings, and Valve. D-Bridge kept producing alone as well, and started his own record label.

Maldini continued to cooperate with Vegas, recording under the name &quot;Bad Company UK&quot;, a change which was needed because of a legal battle with the band formed in the 1970s with the same name. Their main label is &quot;Bad Taste Recordings&quot;. In 2010 the two producers formed the trio Blokhe4d along with Swiss producer Uman. Maldini and Vegas also created the Unique Artists record label, with the participation of a variety of producers from the scene.

The group had a fan forum on their website, which later became Dogs on Acid.

In 2008, readers of &quot;Knowledge Magazine&quot; voted &quot;The Nine&quot; as the number 1 drum and bass track of all time. Other significant tracks are &quot;Nitrous&quot; and &quot;Planet Dust&quot;.

===Comeback===

On 8 February 2016, UKF officially announced that the group was reuniting along with the new material being released that month. They released the single &quot;Equilibrium&quot; on 25 February 2016. Two performances in Bristol and London followed in March. In June, the group gave two concerts in the United States, Las Vegas for EDC and Baltimore for 3D Productions. They also performed at several festivals, including Dour, Paradiso and Nu Forms. In August, they performed at Imagine Festival in Atlanta. They are scheduled to perform at the New Years festival Northern Bass in New Zealand.

In September 2016, they released a remix of The Prodigy&#x27;s &quot;The Day Is My Enemy&quot; which was also uploaded onto UKF&#x27;s YouTube page. The remix was nominated for the Drum &amp; Bass Arena Awards in the category Best Remix. The single &quot;Nomad&quot; followed in November.

In April 2018, the group announced their first album in 16 years, &quot;Ice Station Zero&quot;, which was released at May 11, via Ram Recordings.

Since 2018 the group has continued playing live shows and going on tour. Most recently playing in February 2022, with more shows planned throughout 2022.

<text>The A-B Helicopters A/W 95 is an American helicopter, produced by A-B Helicopters in the form of plans for amateur construction.

By 2012 the A-B Helicopters website had been taken down and plans are no longer available.

The design was developed into the Vortech A/W 95 and plans for that version remain available from Vortech.

==Design and development==
The A/W 95 is a development of the Adams-Wilson Choppy, which the A/W designation acknowledges. The A/W 95 was designed to comply with the US &quot;Experimental Amateur-built&quot; rules, since the empty weight is too heavy for the FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules, which stipulates a maximum empty weight of . The aircraft has a standard empty weight of . It features a single main rotor, a single-seat open cockpit without a windshield, skid landing gear and a twin cylinder, air-cooled, two-stroke, dual-ignition Rotax 503 engine.

The aircraft fuselage is an open frame made from bolted-together and gusseted aluminum tubing. Its diameter two-bladed extruded aluminum rotor has a chord of and employs a symmetrical airfoil. The transmission is constructed from a belt and chain mechanism. With its standard empty weight of and a gross weight of , the useful load is . Fuel tank capacity is , rendering a full-fuel payload of .

While the A/W 95 is primarily plans-built, during the time that A-B Helicopters was in business some pre-fabricated parts were available.

==Operational history==
By January 2013 two examples had been registered in the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration.

<text>Stellar structure models describe the internal structure of a star in detail and make predictions about the luminosity, the color and the future evolution of the star. Different classes and ages of stars have different internal structures, reflecting their elemental makeup and energy transport mechanisms.

==Heat transport==
For energy transport refer to Radiative transfer.
Different layers of the stars transport heat up and outwards in different ways, primarily convection and radiative transfer, but thermal conduction is important in white dwarfs.

Convection is the dominant mode of energy transport when the temperature gradient is steep enough so that a given parcel of gas within the star will continue to rise if it rises slightly via an adiabatic process. In this case, the rising parcel is buoyant and continues to rise if it is warmer than the surrounding gas; if the rising parcel is cooler than the surrounding gas, it will fall back to its original height. In regions with a low temperature gradient and a low enough opacity to allow energy transport via radiation, radiation is the dominant mode of energy transport.

The internal structure of a main sequence star depends upon the mass of the star.

In stars with masses of 0.3–1.5 solar masses (), including the Sun, hydrogen-to-helium fusion occurs primarily via proton–proton chains, which do not establish a steep temperature gradient. Thus, radiation dominates in the inner portion of solar mass stars. The outer portion of solar mass stars is cool enough that hydrogen is neutral and thus opaque to ultraviolet photons, so convection dominates. Therefore, solar mass stars have radiative cores with convective envelopes in the outer portion of the star.

In massive stars (greater than about 1.5 ), the core temperature is above about 1.8×107 K, so hydrogen-to-helium fusion occurs primarily via the CNO cycle. In the CNO cycle, the energy generation rate scales as the temperature to the 15th power, whereas the rate scales as the temperature to the 4th power in the proton-proton chains. Due to the strong temperature sensitivity of the CNO cycle, the temperature gradient in the inner portion of the star is steep enough to make the core convective. In the outer portion of the star, the temperature gradient is shallower but the temperature is high enough that the hydrogen is nearly fully ionized, so the star remains transparent to ultraviolet radiation. Thus, massive stars have a radiative envelope.

The lowest mass main sequence stars have no radiation zone; the dominant energy transport mechanism throughout the star is convection.

==Equations of stellar structure==
The simplest commonly used model of stellar structure is the spherically symmetric quasi-static model, which assumes that a star is in a steady state and that it is spherically symmetric. It contains four basic first-order differential equations: two represent how matter and pressure vary with radius; two represent how temperature and luminosity vary with radius.

In forming the stellar structure equations (exploiting the assumed spherical symmetry), one considers the matter density formula_1, temperature formula_2, total pressure (matter plus radiation) formula_3, luminosity formula_4, and energy generation rate per unit mass formula_5 in a spherical shell of a thickness formula_6 at a distance formula_7 from the center of the star. The star is assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) so the temperature is identical for matter and photons. Although LTE does not strictly hold because the temperature a given shell &quot;sees&quot; below itself is always hotter than the temperature above, this approximation is normally excellent because the photon mean free path, formula_8, is much smaller than the length over which the temperature varies considerably, i.e. formula_9.

First is a statement of &quot;hydrostatic equilibrium:&quot; the outward force due to the pressure gradient within the star is exactly balanced by the inward force due to gravity. This is sometimes referred to as stellar equilibrium.
:formula_10,
where formula_11 is the cumulative mass inside the shell at formula_7 and &quot;G&quot; is the gravitational constant. The cumulative mass increases with radius according to the &quot;mass continuity equation:&quot;
:formula_13

Integrating the mass continuity equation from the star center (formula_14) to the radius of the star (formula_15) yields the total mass of the star.

Considering the energy leaving the spherical shell yields the &quot;energy equation:&quot;
:formula_16,
where formula_17 is the luminosity produced in the form of neutrinos (which usually escape the star without interacting with ordinary matter) per unit mass. Outside the core of the star, where nuclear reactions occur, no energy is generated, so the luminosity is constant.

The energy transport equation takes differing forms depending upon the mode of energy transport. For conductive energy transport (appropriate for a white dwarf), the energy equation is
:formula_18
where &quot;k&quot; is the thermal conductivity.

In the case of radiative energy transport, appropriate for the inner portion of a solar mass main sequence star and the outer envelope of a massive main sequence star,
:formula_19
where formula_20 is the opacity of the matter, formula_21 is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, and the Boltzmann constant is set to one.

The case of convective energy transport does not have a known rigorous mathematical formulation, and involves turbulence in the gas. Convective energy transport is usually modeled using mixing length theory. This treats the gas in the star as containing discrete elements which roughly retain the temperature, density, and pressure of their surroundings but move through the star as far as a characteristic length, called the &quot;mixing length&quot;. For a monatomic ideal gas, when the convection is adiabatic, meaning that the convective gas bubbles don&#x27;t exchange heat with their surroundings, mixing length theory yields
:formula_22
where formula_23 is the adiabatic index, the ratio of specific heats in the gas. (For a fully ionized ideal gas, formula_24.) When the convection is not adiabatic, the true temperature gradient is not given by this equation. For example, in the Sun the convection at the base of the convection zone, near the core, is adiabatic but that near the surface is not. The mixing length theory contains two free parameters which must be set to make the model fit observations, so it is a phenomenological theory rather than a rigorous mathematical formulation.

Also required are the equations of state, relating the pressure, opacity and energy generation rate to other local variables appropriate for the material, such as temperature, density, chemical composition, etc. Relevant equations of state for pressure may have to include the perfect gas law, radiation pressure, pressure due to degenerate electrons, etc. Opacity cannot be expressed exactly by a single formula. It is calculated for various compositions at specific densities and temperatures and presented in tabular form. Stellar structure &quot;codes&quot; (meaning computer programs calculating the model&#x27;s variables) either interpolate in a density-temperature grid to obtain the opacity needed, or use a fitting function based on the tabulated values. A similar situation occurs for accurate calculations of the pressure equation of state. Finally, the nuclear energy generation rate is computed from nuclear physics experiments, using &quot;reaction networks&quot; to compute reaction rates for each individual reaction step and equilibrium abundances for each isotope in the gas.

Combined with a set of boundary conditions, a solution of these equations completely describes the behavior of the star. Typical boundary conditions set the values of the observable parameters appropriately at the surface (formula_15) and center (formula_14) of the star: formula_27, meaning the pressure at the surface of the star is zero; formula_28, there is no mass inside the center of the star, as required if the mass density remains ; formula_29, the total mass of the star is the star&#x27;s mass; and formula_30, the temperature at the surface is the effective temperature of the star.

Although nowadays stellar evolution models describe the main features of color–magnitude diagrams, important improvements have to be made in order to remove uncertainties which are linked to the limited knowledge of transport phenomena. The most difficult challenge remains the numerical treatment of turbulence. Some research teams are developing simplified modelling of turbulence in 3D calculations.

==Rapid evolution==
The above simplified model is not adequate without modification in situations when the composition changes are sufficiently rapid. The equation of hydrostatic equilibrium may need to be modified by adding a radial acceleration term if the radius of the star is changing very quickly, for example if the star is radially pulsating. Also, if the nuclear burning is not stable, or the star&#x27;s core is rapidly collapsing, an entropy term must be added to the energy equation.

<text>PS &quot;Skibladner&quot; is the world&#x27;s oldest paddle steamer in timetabled service, and the only paddle steamer operating in Norway, sailing on lake Mjøsa.

&quot;Skibladner&quot; is a side-wheel paddle steamer, and her maiden voyage was on 2 August 1856. Originally built to provide passage from the railway station in Eidsvoll to the towns of Hamar, Gjøvik, and Lillehammer along Mjøsa, she still operates the same route, but now offers sightseeing tours, dining, entertainment and cultural events during the summer months.

She was built by Motala Verkstad in Sweden and transported in pieces by rail and horse carts to Minnesund, where she was assembled and riveted together. She was originally equipped with twin-cylinder oscillating steam engines. In 1888, she was extended by 20 feet to provide more space and to allow for the installation of triple-expansion diagonal paddle engines built by Akers Mek. in Oslo, increasing her power to 606 h.p. She was then the fastest vessel in Norway with a top speed of 15 knots. She was converted from coal to oil-firing in the 1920s, and received new boilers in the 1980s. Today she is still powered by steam generated with fuel-oil burners in her twin boilers, and her normal operating speed is now 12 knots.

The ship sank twice while laid up for winter, the first time in 1937, and again in 1967, due to heeling caused by her moorings. On both occasions she was raised and underwent significant renovation with strong support from the Norwegian public.

The ship is often referred to locally as &quot;Mjøsas Hvite Svane,&quot; which translates to &quot;The White Swan of Mjøsa.&quot;

The ship’s home port is Gjøvik, where she is also laid up each winter beneath a specially built glass-covered construction. Her sailing season is from May to September, and the timetabled season is from late June to mid August.

On 14 June 2005, the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage made &quot;Skibladner&quot; subject to a preservation order. This was the first time in Norway that an operating vehicle had been listed.

The steamer is named after &quot;Skíðblaðnir&quot;, the ship of Freyr in Norse mythology.

<doc id="1039146" wikidata="Q1422489" url="?curid=1039146" title="Directional drilling">
<text>Directional drilling (or slant drilling) is the practice of drilling non-vertical bores. It can be broken down into four main groups: oilfield directional drilling, utility installation directional drilling, directional boring (horizontal directional drilling - HDD), and surface in seam (SIS), which horizontally intersects a vertical bore target to extract coal bed methane.

==History==
Many prerequisites enabled this suite of technologies to become productive. Probably, the first requirement was the realization that oil wells, or water wells, do not necessarily need to be vertical. This realization was quite slow, and did not really grasp the attention of the oil industry until the late 1920s when there were several lawsuits alleging that wells drilled from a rig on one property had crossed the boundary and were penetrating a reservoir on an adjacent property. Initially, proxy evidence such as production changes in other wells was accepted, but such cases fueled the development of small diameter tools capable of surveying wells during drilling. Horizontal directional drill rigs are developing towards large-scale, micro-miniaturization, mechanical automation, hard stratum working, exceeding length and depth oriented monitored drilling.

Measuring the inclination of a wellbore (its deviation from the vertical) is comparatively simple, requiring only a pendulum. Measuring the azimuth (direction with respect to the geographic grid in which the wellbore was running from the vertical), however, was more difficult. In certain circumstances, magnetic fields could be used, but would be influenced by metalwork used inside wellbores, as well as the metalwork used in drilling equipment. The next advance was in the modification of small gyroscopic compasses by the Sperry Corporation, which was making similar compasses for aeronautical navigation. Sperry did this under contract to Sun Oil (which was involved in a lawsuit as described above), and a spin-off company &quot;Sperry Sun&quot; was formed, which brand continues to this day, absorbed into Halliburton. Three components are measured at any given point in a wellbore in order to determine its position: the depth of the point along the course of the borehole (measured depth), the inclination at the point, and the magnetic azimuth at the point. These three components combined are referred to as a &quot;survey&quot;. A series of consecutive surveys are needed to track the progress and location of a wellbore.

Prior experience with rotary drilling had established several principles for the configuration of drilling equipment down hole (&quot;bottom hole assembly&quot; or &quot;BHA&quot;) that would be prone to &quot;drilling crooked hole&quot; (i.e., initial accidental deviations from the vertical would be increased). Counter-experience had also given early directional drillers (&quot;DD&#x27;s&quot;) principles of BHA design and drilling practice that would help bring a crooked hole nearer the vertical.

In 1934, H. John Eastman and Roman W. Hines of Long Beach, California, became pioneers in directional drilling when they and George Failing of Enid, Oklahoma, saved the Conroe, Texas, oil field. Failing had recently patented a portable drilling truck. He had started his company in 1931 when he mated a drilling rig to a truck and a power take-off assembly. The innovation allowed rapid drilling of a series of slanted wells. This capacity to quickly drill multiple relief wells and relieve the enormous gas pressure was critical to extinguishing the Conroe fire. In a May, 1934, &quot;Popular Science Monthly&quot; article, it was stated that &quot;Only a handful of men in the world have the strange power to make a bit, rotating a mile below ground at the end of a steel drill pipe, snake its way in a curve or around a dog-leg angle, to reach a desired objective.&quot; Eastman Whipstock, Inc., would become the world&#x27;s largest directional company in 1973.

Combined, these survey tools and BHA designs made directional drilling possible, but it was perceived as arcane. The next major advance was in the 1970s, when downhole drilling motors (aka mud motors, driven by the hydraulic power of drilling mud circulated down the drill string) became common. These allowed the drill bit to continue rotating at the cutting face at the bottom of the hole, while most of the drill pipe was held stationary. A piece of bent pipe (a &quot;bent sub&quot;) between the stationary drill pipe and the top of the motor allowed the direction of the wellbore to be changed without needing to pull all the drill pipe out and place another whipstock. Coupled with the development of measurement while drilling tools (using mud pulse telemetry, networked or wired pipe or electromagnetism (EM) telemetry, which allows tools down hole to send directional data back to the surface without disturbing drilling operations), directional drilling became easier.

Certain profiles cannot be easily drilled while the drill pipe is rotating. Drilling directionally with a downhole motor requires occasionally stopping rotation of the drill pipe and &quot;sliding&quot; the pipe through the channel as the motor cuts a curved path. &quot;Sliding&quot; can be difficult in some formations, and it is almost always slower and therefore more expensive than drilling while the pipe is rotating, so the ability to steer the bit while the drill pipe is rotating is desirable. Several companies have developed tools which allow directional control while rotating. These tools are referred to as rotary steerable systems (RSS). RSS technology has made access and directional control possible in previously inaccessible or uncontrollable formations. 

==Benefits==
Wells are drilled directionally for several purposes:

*Increasing the exposed section length through the reservoir by drilling through the reservoir at an angle.
*Drilling into the reservoir where vertical access is difficult or not possible. For instance an oilfield under a town, under a lake, or underneath a difficult-to-drill formation.

*Allowing more wellheads to be grouped together on one surface location can allow fewer rig moves, less surface area disturbance, and make it easier and cheaper to complete and produce the wells. For instance, on an oil platform or jacket offshore, 40 or more wells can be grouped together. The wells will fan out from the platform into the reservoir(s) below. This concept is being applied to land wells, allowing multiple subsurface locations to be reached from one pad, reducing costs.
*Drilling along the underside of a reservoir-constraining fault allows multiple productive sands to be completed at the highest stratigraphic points.
*Drilling a &quot;relief well&quot; to relieve the pressure of a well producing without restraint (a &quot;blowout&quot;). In this scenario, another well could be drilled starting at a safe distance away from the blowout, but intersecting the troubled wellbore. Then, heavy fluid (kill fluid) is pumped into the relief wellbore to suppress the high pressure in the original wellbore causing the blowout.

Most directional drillers are given a blue well path to follow that is predetermined by engineers and geologists before the drilling commences. When the directional driller starts the drilling process, periodic surveys are taken with a downhole instrument to provide survey data (inclination and azimuth) of the well bore. These pictures are typically taken at intervals between 10 and 150 meters (30–500 feet), with 30 meters (90 feet) common during active changes of angle or direction, and distances of 60–100 meters (200–300 feet) being typical while &quot;drilling ahead&quot; (not making active changes to angle and direction). During critical angle and direction changes, especially while using a downhole motor, a measurement while drilling (MWD) tool will be added to the drill string to provide continuously updated measurements that may be used for (near) real-time adjustments.

This data indicates if the well is following the planned path and whether the orientation of the drilling assembly is causing the well to deviate as planned. Corrections are regularly made by techniques as simple as adjusting rotation speed or the drill string weight (weight on bottom) and stiffness, as well as more complicated and time-consuming methods, such as introducing a downhole motor. Such pictures, or surveys, are plotted and maintained as an engineering and legal record describing the path of the well bore. The survey pictures taken while drilling are typically confirmed by a later survey in full of the borehole, typically using a &quot;multi-shot camera&quot; device.

The multi-shot camera advances the film at time intervals so that by dropping the camera instrument in a sealed tubular housing inside the drilling string (down to just above the drilling bit) and then withdrawing the drill string at time intervals, the well may be fully surveyed at regular depth intervals (approximately every 30 meters (90 feet) being common, the typical length of 2 or 3 joints of drill pipe, known as a stand, since most drilling rigs &quot;stand back&quot; the pipe withdrawn from the hole at such increments, known as &quot;stands&quot;).

Drilling to targets far laterally from the surface location requires careful planning and design. The current record holders manage wells over away from the surface location at a true vertical depth (TVD) of only 1,600–2,600 m (5,200–8,500 ft).

This form of drilling can also reduce the environmental cost and scarring of the landscape. Previously, long lengths of landscape had to be removed from the surface. This is no longer required with directional drilling.

==Disadvantages==

Until the arrival of modern downhole motors and better tools to measure inclination and azimuth of the hole, directional drilling and horizontal drilling was much slower than vertical drilling due to the need to stop regularly and take time-consuming surveys, and due to slower progress in drilling itself (lower rate of penetration). These disadvantages have shrunk over time as downhole motors became more efficient and semi-continuous surveying became possible.

What remains is a difference in operating costs: for wells with an inclination of less than 40 degrees, tools to carry out adjustments or repair work can be lowered by gravity on cable into the hole. For higher inclinations, more expensive equipment has to be mobilized to push tools down the hole.

Another disadvantage of wells with a high inclination was that prevention of sand influx into the well was less reliable and needed higher effort. Again, this disadvantage has diminished such that, provided sand control is adequately planned, it is possible to carry it out reliably.

===Stealing oil===
In 1990, Iraq accused Kuwait of stealing Iraq&#x27;s oil through slant drilling.
The United Nations redrew the border after the 1991 Gulf war, which ended the seven-month Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. As part of the reconstruction, 11 new oil wells were placed among the existing 600. Some farms and an old naval base that used to be in the Iraqi side became part of Kuwait.

In the mid-twentieth century, a slant-drilling scandal occurred in the huge East Texas Oil Field.

===New technologies===
Between 1985 and 1993, the Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory (NCEL) (now the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC)) of Port Hueneme, California developed controllable horizontal drilling technologies. These technologies are capable of reaching (3000–4500 m) and may reach (7500 m) when used under favorable conditions.

==Techniques==
=== Wellbore Surveys ===
Specialized tools determine the wellbore&#x27;s deviation from vertical (inclination) and its directional orientation (azimuth). This data is vital for trajectory adjustments. These surveys are taken at regular intervals (e.g., every 30-100 meters) to track the wellbore&#x27;s progress in real time. In critical sections, measurement while drilling (MWD) tools provide continuous downhole measurements for immediate directional corrections as needed. MWD uses gyroscopes, magnetometers, and accelerometers to determine borehole inclination and azimuth while the drilling is being done.

=== Trajectory Control ===
* Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA): The configuration of drilling equipment near the drill bit (BHA) profoundly influences drilling direction. BHAs can be tailored to promote straight drilling or induce deviations.
* Downhole Motors: Specialized mud motors rotate only the drill bit, allowing controlled changes in direction while the majority of the drill string remains stationary.
* Rotary Steerable Systems (RSS): Advanced RSS technology enables steering even while the entire drill string is rotating, ensuring greater efficiency and control.

<text>Tavira () is a Portuguese town and municipality, capital of the &quot;Costa do Acantilado&quot;, situated in the east of the Algarve on the south coast of Portugal. It is east of Faro and west of Huelva across the river Guadiana into Spain. The Gilão River meets the Atlantic Ocean in Tavira. The population in 2011 was 26,167, in an area of 606.97 km2. Tavira is the Portuguese representative community for the inscription of the Mediterranean Diet as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO.

==History==

===Bronze Age to the Roman Empire===

Tavira&#x27;s origins date back to the late Bronze Age (1,000-800 BC). In the 8th century BC it became one of the first Phoenician settlements in the Iberian West. The Phoenicians created a colonial urban center here with massive walls, at least one sanctuary, two harbours and a regular urban structure which lasted until the end of 6th century BC, when the location was abandoned in favour of a near-by site, probably due to the prpgressive progradation of the delta where it was located. Excavations led by Maria Maia, Manuel Maia andLuís Fraga da Silva brought to light part of a casemate fortification wall, ritual deposits and urban features pertaining to the settlememt on the hill of Santa Maria. The sanctuary deposits of Pits 2 and 3 pertaining to the sanctuary have been published by Eleftheria Pappa.

It has been claimed that the original name of Tavira, Balsa, derives from a Phoenician storm god:Baal Saphon, but other Phoenician etymologies have also been suggestes. To the Romans it was known as Balsa&quot;.

After laying abandoned for a century, it was revived and became an even larger settlement during the so-called Tartessian Period of Tavira, was again abandoned by the end of the 4th century BC. Another urban center emerged at nearby &quot;Cerro do Cavaco&quot;, a fortified hill occupied until the time of Emperor Augustus.

===The Roman Empire to the Moorish Conquest===
During the time of Caesar, the Romans created a new port, some from Tavira, named Balsa. 
Balsa became a big town, in fact much bigger than Tavira, that grew, prospered and decayed in parallel with the Roman Empire. When the Moors conquered Iberia, in the 8th century, Balsa was already extinct as a town.

Under Roman rule, Tavira was a secondary passing place on the important road between Balsa and Baesuris (today Castro Marim).

===Moorish Rule===

The Moorish occupation of Tavira between the 8th and 13th centuries left its mark on the agriculture, architecture and culture of the area. That influence can still be seen in Tavira today with its whitewashed buildings, Moorish style doors and rooftops. The Tavira Castle, two mosques and palaces were built by the Moors. The impressive seven arched &quot;Roman bridge&quot; is now not considered to be Roman after a recent archaeological survey, but originates from a 12th-century Moorish bridge. This was a good time economically for Tavira, which established itself as an important port for sailors and fishermen. The area remained rural until the 11th century when Moorish Tavira (from the Arabic Tabira, &quot;the hidden&quot;) grew rapidly, becoming one of the important towns of the then Gharb al-Andalus (the west), today&#x27;s Algarve.

===The Reconquista===

In 1242 Dom Paio Peres Correia took Tavira back from the Moors in a bloody conflict of retaliation after seven of his principal Knights were killed during a period of truce. Dom Paio&#x27;s Christian troops decimated most of Tavira&#x27;s population and the few survivors were kept in a tiny quarter known as &quot;Mouraria&quot;.


===The 1755 earthquake===

In the 18th century, the port on its river was of considerable importance for shipping produce such as salt, dried fish and wine. 
Like most of the Algarve, its buildings were virtually all destroyed by the earthquake of 1755. 
This earthquake is thought to have reached 8.5–9.0 on the moment magnitude scale and caused extensive damage throughout the Algarve due to high intensity shaking (XI (&quot;Extreme&quot;) on the Mercalli intensity scale) and tsunamis.

The earthquake is referred to as the Lisbon earthquake due to its terrible effects on the capital city, although the epicentre was some west-southwest of Cape St. Vincent in the Algarve region.

==Demographics==

==Tavira today==

The city has since been rebuilt with many fine 18th-century buildings along with its 37 churches. A bridge links the two parts of the town across the River Gilão.
The church of Santa Maria do Castelo, built on the ruins of a mosque, holds the tombs of Dom Paio Peres Correia and his knights.
The church dates back to the 13th century, with the clock tower having been recreated from what was once a minaret. A bust of Dom Paio who died in Tavira in 1275, can be seen on the corner of the town hall.

At one time fishing was the area&#x27;s primary industry but that declined, partly due to the changing migration patterns of tuna fish and advancing silt in the river Gilão.
The population is in the region of 25,000 inhabitants (municipality of Tavira) supporting a military base. Although still relatively untouched by mass tourism, there are several golf courses in the vicinity. The local beach lies past the salt pans and can be reached via the nearby Santa Luzia footbridge or by ferry, taking visitors to the sand-bar island known as Ilha de Tavira, part of the Ria Formosa natural wetlands park. The nearby Praia do Barril beach has an &#x27;anchor cemetery&#x27;, where rusting anchors stand as a tribute to the area’s tuna fishing heritage.

In recent years the Gran Plaza shopping centre, incorporating a cinema, supermarket shops, and restaurants, was built on the outskirts of the town. House prices have increased sharply in recent years. The development of many golf clubs close to the town has also had an effect.

As one of the popular towns in the Algarve, Tavira benefits from tourism which is the primary aspect of the region&#x27;s economy.

== Climate ==
Tavira has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;) with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Together with Faro, it is among the sunniest cities in Portugal and in Europe, typically averaging around 3,150 hours of sunshine. Due to its location on the Algarvian Sotavento, Tavira is sheltered from frontal systems coming from the west but exposed to the influences of humid air masses coming from the south. The city receives predominantly western winds. Temperatures below are registered, on average, once a year. In contrast to the western coasts of Portugal, fog is very uncommon in Tavira, occurring on average only three times a year.

==Parishes==

Administratively, the municipality is divided into 6 civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):

* Conceição e Cabanas de Tavira
* Cachopo
* Luz de Tavira e Santo Estêvão
* Santa Catarina da Fonte do Bispo
* Santa Luzia
* Tavira (Santa Maria e Santiago)


==Transport==
Tavira has its own railway station on the line from Vila Real de Santo António to Faro and Lagos. Trains are operated by Comboios de Portugal (CP). Connections are available at Faro station for trains to Lisbon and the rest of Portugal.

The A22 toll motorway passes near to the town. This offers fast road access along the Algarve coast and eastwards to Seville.

The nearest international airports are Faro and Seville.

==International relations==
Tavira is twinned with:

* Kenitra, Morocco
* Łańcut, Poland
* Perpignan, France
* Porto Novo, Cape Verde
* Punta Umbría, Spain
* San Bartolomé de la Torre, Spain

<text>Néstor Cerpa Cartolini (14 August 1953 – 22 April 1997) was a member, then leader of the Peruvian Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). He was sometimes known by the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; &quot;Evaristo&quot;. He was killed by Peruvian government forces during Operation Chavín de Huántar in 1997.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Cerpa was born in the Lima working class district of La Victoria. As a union leader in the 1970s he was involved in the takeover by workers of the Cromotex textile factory in December 1978, which was violently ended by the military government in February 1979, resulting in the deaths of several workers. Following the release of the survivors in late 1979, Cerpa organized a sit-in at the United Nations communications office in Lima.

===Terrorism===
In the early 1980s he became involved with the nascent MRTA and quickly rose to be the leader of the San Martín Zone Committee, and thence to the national leadership of the MRTA. As an MRTA militant he is alleged to have led and/or participated in:
* Takeover of the Lima head offices of El Nacional newspaper, forcing its workers to print an MRTA communiqué.
* Arson at the Plaza Unión, in Lima, on 9 September 1984.
* Putting a terrorism flag by the KFC on Avenida Benavides, Surco, Lima, on 20 March 1985.
* Attempted attack on the office of Sedapal, located in the intersection of Avenida Benavides and La Paz in Miraflores.
* Assault and armed robbery against the San Borja Galleria on 30 March 1985, also in Lima.
* Assault on the Julio C. Tello Technological Institute in Villa el Salvador on 6 May 1985.
* Assault and armed robbery against Electro Perú, Lima, on 25 May 1985.

In late 1985 Cerpa travelled to Colombia, where he headed the &quot;Leoncio Prado&quot; Squad, one of three MRTA squads that participated in a joint military venture with Colombia&#x27;s M-19 movement and Ecuador&#x27;s ¡Alfaro Vive, Carajo! and Quintín Lame guerrillas.

After his return to Peru, and following the capture of Victor Polay, Cerpa became the most prominent leader within the MRTA and one of the few publicly known faces within the movement.

Following the April 1992 &quot;self-coup&quot; by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, the MRTA suffered heavy losses at the hands of the Peruvian police and military, which coupled with internal problems, had brought the organization to the brink of defeat. In this context, Cerpa and the MRTA leadership looked to a spectacular action to break the MRTA out of its growing isolation.

In December 1996, Cerpa led an MRTA commando squad in seizing the Japanese ambassador&#x27;s residence in Lima, which started what is now called the Japanese embassy hostage crisis. The MRTA&#x27;s main demand was for the exchange of the hostages for 465 members of the MRTA in prison, including Cerpa&#x27;s wife Nancy Gilvonio, the Chilean members of the organization, and U.S. citizen Lori Berenson. The government rejected the demands, and on 22 April 1997, after 126 days, a 140-man team of commandos of the Peruvian Armed Forces stormed the Japanese ambassador&#x27;s residence to rescue all the hostages. One hostage and two soldiers died in the assault, as did Cerpa along with the rest of the MRTA squad. His lasts words were &quot;¡Vete a la mierda!&quot;

On 24 April 1997, Cerpa&#x27;s body was interred without ceremony in Nueva Esperanza Cemetery, located in the Lima suburb of Villa María del Triunfo.

<text>Richard Axel (born July 2, 1946) is an American molecular biologist and university professor in the Department of Neuroscience at Columbia University and investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. His work on the olfactory system won him and Linda Buck, a former postdoctoral research scientist in his group, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2004.

==Education and early life==
Born in New York City to Polish Jewish immigrants, Axel grew up in Brooklyn. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1963, (along with Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, Allan Lichtman, Ron Silver, and Alexander Rosenberg), received his B.A. in 1967 from Columbia University, and his M.D. in 1971 from Johns Hopkins University. However, he was poorly suited to medicine and graduated on the promise to his department chairman that he would not practice clinically. He found his calling in research and returned to Columbia later that year, eventually becoming a full professor in 1978.

==Research and career==

During the late 1970s, Axel, along with microbiologist Saul J. Silverstein and geneticist Michael H. Wigler, discovered a technique of cotransformation via transfection, a process which allows foreign DNA to be inserted into a host cell to produce certain proteins.
A family of patents, now colloquially referred to as the &quot;Axel patents&quot;, covering this technique were filed for February 1980 and were issued in August 1983. As a fundamental process in recombinant DNA research as performed at pharmaceutical and biotech companies, this patent proved quite lucrative for Columbia University, earning it almost $100 million a year at one time, and a top spot on the list of top universities by licensing revenue. The Axel patents expired in August 2000.

In their landmark paper published in 1991, Buck and Axel cloned olfactory receptors, showing that they belong to the family of G protein coupled receptors. By analyzing rat DNA, they estimated that there were approximately one thousand different genes for olfactory receptors in the mammalian genome. This research opened the door to the genetic and molecular analysis of the mechanisms of olfaction. In their later work, Buck and Axel have shown that each olfactory receptor neuron remarkably only expresses one kind of olfactory receptor protein and that the input from all neurons expressing the same receptor is collected by a single dedicated glomerulus of the olfactory bulb.

Axel&#x27;s primary research interest is on how the brain interprets the sense of smell, specifically mapping the parts of the brain that are sensitive to specific olfactory receptors. He holds the titles of University Professor at Columbia University, Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics and of Pathology at Columbia University&#x27;s College of Physicians and Surgeons, and Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. In addition to contributions to neurobiology, Axel has also made seminal discoveries in immunology, and his lab was one of the first to identify the link between HIV infection and immunoreceptor CD4.

In addition to making contributions as a scientist, Axel has also mentored many leading scientists in the field of neurobiology. Seven of his trainees have become members of the National Academy of Sciences, and currently six of his trainees are affiliated with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute&#x27;s investigator and early scientist award programs.

==Awards and honors==
In addition to the Nobel Prize, Axel has won numerous awards and honors. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1983. In 2005, Axel received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Axel was awarded the Double Helix Medal in 2007. CSHL Double Helix Medal Honoree and was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2014. His nomination reads: 

==Personal life==
Axel is married to fellow scientist and olfaction pioneer Cornelia Bargmann. Previously, he had been married to Ann Axel, who is a social worker at Columbia University Medical Center. Owing to his tall stature, Axel played basketball during high school.

<text>Terrence Higgins Trust is a British charity that campaigns about and provides services relating to HIV and sexual health. In particular, the charity aims to end the transmission of HIV in the UK; to support and empower people living with HIV, to eradicate stigma and discrimination around HIV, and to promote good sexual health (including safe sex).

The Trust is generally considered the UK&#x27;s leading HIV and AIDS charity, and the largest in Europe. It was also the lead organisation for Public Health England&#x27;s HIV prevention partnership HIV Prevention England.

== History ==
Established in 1982, Terrence Higgins Trust was the first charity in the UK to be set up in response to HIV and AIDS. It was initially named Terry Higgins Trust, after Terry Higgins, who died aged 37 on 4 July 1982 at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, London. He was among the first people in the UK known to have died from the AIDS virus, which was only identified the previous year. Princess Margaret was an early prominent patron, becoming the first member of the royal family to publicly associate themselves with a charity focusing on AIDS and sexual health.

Terry&#x27;s close friends Martyn Butler, Tony Harris-Calvert and Terry&#x27;s partner Rupert Whitaker along with other friends started the Trust to raise funds for research as a way of preventing suffering due to AIDS. Shortly, with the generation of a groundswell of support for the organisation at a meeting at Red Lion Square, Tony Whitehead and others joined the group and formally founded the organisation and saw it through registration as a charity to provide direct services to those affected by HIV.

The trust was named after Terry to personalise and humanise the issue of AIDS. It was formalised in August 1983 when it adopted a constitution and opened a bank account, and the name of the trust was changed (&quot;Terrence&quot; rather than &quot;Terry&quot;) to sound more formal. It incorporated as a limited company in November 1983 and gained charitable status in January 1984.
Since its inception 12 years ago, most of its fund-raising events have been hip and low-key affairs, from its first disco at the London club Heaven to gala screenings of Dracula and the comedy shows Hysteria and Filth... 

&quot;Hysteria 1&quot; was a comedy benefit for Terrence Higgins Trust, produced by Stephen Fry.

&quot;Hysteria 2&quot;, on 18 September 1989 at the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in London, benefited Terrence Higgins Trust. It was produced by Stephen Fry and broadcast on Channel 4, with a telethon.

&quot;Hysteria 3&quot;, at the London Palladium on Sunday, 30 June 1991, benefited Terrence Higgins Trust. Stephen Fry hosted, with Steven Wright, Hugh Laurie, Elton John, Ruby Wax, Rowan Atkinson, Eddie Izzard, Craig Ferguson, Lenny Henry, Julian Clary, Josie Lawrence, Jools Holland, Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, Ian McKellen, Edwin Starr, Clement Freud, Beverly Craven, Ben Elton, and Tony Slattery.

The charity received almost a million pounds in donations over the Christmas of 1991, with the proceeds of Queen&#x27;s re-released chart-topper &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; going entirely to the charity, following the recent AIDS-related death of lead singer Freddie Mercury. After being diagnosed as HIV positive in 1987, Mercury had been concerned that financial support should be available to those less fortunate than himself.

Lisa Power, former corporate head of policy at the Terrence Higgins Trust, denounced the views of Pope Benedict XVI on the use of condoms to prevent AIDS and said: &quot;We deeply regret the continued misinformation around condoms, which remain the most effective way of preventing the spread of HIV.&quot;

In August 2015 first-team players from Hull Kingston Rovers teamed up with 1980s band Erasure to record a charity version of the band&#x27;s single &quot;A Little Respect&quot;, with a third of the proceeds going to the trust.

==People==
Activist Nick Partridge, who joined the Trust in 1985, was its chief executive until 2013. Ian Green was the charity&#x27;s Chief Executive from 2016 to 2023. Richard Angell became CEO on 1 March 2023.

The charity&#x27;s celebrity patrons have included Sir Richard Branson, Freddie Mercury, Simon Callow, Lord Cashman, Julian Clary, Dame Judi Dench, Tracey Emin, Stephen Fry, Paul Gambaccini, Sir Elton John, Caroline Quentin, Gaby Roslin, Dr Miriam Stoppard and George Michael.

<text>The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU or Cosatu) is a trade union federation in South Africa. It was founded in 1985 and is the largest of the country&#x27;s three main trade union federations, with 21 affiliated trade unions.

==History==
===Founding and early history===
On 30 November 1985, 33 unions met at the University of Natal for talks on forming a federation of trade unions. This followed four years of unity talks between competing unions and federations that were opposed to apartheid and were &quot;committed to a non-racial, non-sexist and democratic South Africa.&quot; COSATU was officially established on 1 December 1985. Among the founding unions were the affiliates of the Federation of South African Trade Unions (FOSATU), the small National Federation of Workers, and some independent unions, notably the National Union of Mineworkers. Elijah Barayi was the organisation&#x27;s first president and Jay Naidoo the first general secretary.

Several resolutions were passed at this first meeting that defined the aim of the federation and how the federation operates, namely:
* To establish one union for each industry within six months.
* To focus on the exploitation of women workers.
* To call for the lifting of the state of emergency, withdrawal of troops from the townships and release of all political prisoners.
* To continue the call for international pressure, including disinvestment.
* To demand for the right to strike and picket.
* To determine a national minimum wage.
* To extend the struggle for trade union rights in the homelands.

On 5–6 May 1987 a strike as part of COSATU&#x27;s Living Wage Campaign was held coinciding with 1987 General Election. More than 2.5 million workers took part in the stay-away. On 7 May 1987, in the early hours of the morning two bombs exploded near the support columns in the basement of the federation headquarters, COSATU House. The resulting damage caused the building to be declared unsafe.

===Fight against Apartheid===
At the second national congress held from 14 to 18 July 1987, the Freedom Charter was adopted by the federation after the resolution was proposed by the National Union of Mineworkers

At the third congress held from 12 to 16 July 1989, a resolution was adopted that called on the members of COSATU to join a campaign of &quot;sustained action&quot; against apartheid, in the week leading up to the 1989 General Election of South Africa.

On 26 July 1989, COSATU, the United Democratic Front and the Mass Democratic Movement, instigated the National Defiance Campaign, in which facilities reserved for whites were invaded, and organisation that had been banned by the state declared themselves &#x27;unbanned&#x27;.

===Post apartheid activities===

The COSATU congress decided in 2012 to affiliate with the class-struggle oriented World Federation of Trade Unions, while maintaining its membership within the International Trade Union Confederation.

During the 2016 Congress that was held in Durban, Michael Mzwandile Makwayiba, president of COSATU affiliate NEHAWU Michael Mzwandile Makwayiba was elected President of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

By 2012 the trade union had a total of 2,191,016 members and 20 affiliated unions. Since then Cosatu experienced a large drop in membership partially due to a decline in affiliate membership numbers, between 2015 and 2022 it lost over 416 000 members.

==Affiliates==
===Current affiliates===
The following unions were listed by COSATU as their affiliates:

===Former affiliates===
==Expulsion of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa==
On 8 November 2014, Irvin Jim, the general secretary of the largest COSATU affiliate, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), announced that the union had been expelled from the COSATU after a vote at a special central executive committee had been convened resulting in a 33–24 vote in favour of the expulsion. NUMSA was charged with violating the constitution of COSATU

On 6 November 2014, an urgent legal application by NUMSA to prevent the special central executive committee from being convened was postponed by South Gauteng High Court, thus allowing the meeting to take place.

On 10 November 2014, 7 unions announced they were voluntarily suspending their participation in COSATU&#x27;s decision-making bodies due to the expulsion of NUMSA and called for a special national congress to be convened.

Irvin Jim described the expulsion as &quot;a dark day for workers&quot;.

==Government==
COSATU is part of an alliance with the ANC and the South African Communist Party, called the &quot;Tripartite Alliance&quot;. COSATU&#x27;s role in the alliance has been the subject of debate, since the organisation has been critical of some of the ANC government&#x27;s policies. While some affiliates have argued for greater independence from the ruling political party, others have argued that the arrangement gives COSATU a political influence beneficial to its members.&quot;

==Labour and social movements==

South Africa has one of the largest incidence of HIV/AIDS in the world, with a 2005 estimate of 5.5-million people living with HIV – 12.4% of the population. In 2020, around 20.6-million people in eastern and southern Africa were living with HIV. The trade union movement has taken a role in combating this pandemic. COSATU is a key partner in the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), a registered charity and political force working to educate and promote understanding about HIV/AIDS, and to prevent new infections, as well as push for greater access to antiretrovirals. In 1998, COSATU passed a resolution to campaign for treatment. &quot;It was clear to the labour movement at that time that its lowest paid members were dying because they couldn’t afford medicines&quot;, says Theodora Steel, Campaigns Coordinator at COSATU. &quot;We saw TAC as a natural ally
in a campaign for treatment. We passed a formal resolution at our congress to assist and build TAC.

Notwithstanding the formal alliance of COSATU with the ruling ANC party, it has been at odds with the government, calling for the roll-out of comprehensive public access to antiretroviral drugs.

Abahlali baseMjondolo offered a strong statement of support to the 2010 Public Sector Worker&#x27;s strike.

==Logo==
The wheel in the logo represents the economy. The gold colour of the wheel represents the wealth of the country. The figures pushing the wheel, consisting of two men and a woman carrying a baby, represent the challenges that workers face namely, racial and gender oppression as well as economic exploitation. These figures are black as they represent the black majorities struggle against racial oppression. The figures are holding a red flag that represents the working class.

The slogan on the logo is &quot;An injury to one is an injury to all&quot; signifies the vision the union has of social solidarity that binds the working class.

==Zimbabwe==

In October 2004 and February 2005 COSATU sent delegations to Zimbabwe to judge conditions in that country before the 2005 Zimbabwe parliamentary elections. They were expelled from the country on both occasions.

COSATU has arranged protests and border blockades against the regime in Harare.

In 2016, COSATU voiced support for #ThisFlag protestors in Zimbabwe, stating &quot;heavy-handedness of the Zanu-PF regime in dealing with perceived enemies was similar to that of Operation Restore Order/Murambatsvina in 2005.&quot;

== Palestine activism ==
In 2020, COSATU voiced their solidarity with Palestinian peoples on 15 May (Nakba Day) and have linked the Palestinian right to land to COSATU&#x27;s struggle against apartheid in South Africa. In 2021 Palestinians protested against an Israeli court ruling which stated that residents of Sheik Jarrah need to be evicted from their homes in Jerusalem. Israeli troops attacked Al-Aqsa during Ramadan, a holy month for many Palestinians. COSATU marched to the US Embassy in Sandton, Johannesburg as a show of support for Palestinians, stating that the US government needs to recognize the sovereignty of Palestine as well as the gross human rights violations against Palestinians.
