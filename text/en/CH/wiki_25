<text>Karlskoga () is a locality and the seat of Karlskoga Municipality, Sweden. It is located within Örebro County, 45 km (28 mi) west of Örebro, and 10 km (6 mi) north of Degerfors. With a 2020 population of 27,386 distributed over 10.55 square miles (27.33 km2), Karlskoga is the second-largest city in both Örebro County and the historical province of Värmland.

Karlskoga straddles the northern shore of Lake Möckeln. Among the city&#x27;s main topographical features are the two rivers, Timsälven and Svartälven. Other features include an esker, Rävåsen, designated as a nature reserve, and contiguous with the city center.

The broader Karlskoga area distinguishes itself from its surrounding regions, e.g. the Närke Plain, with its abundant woodlands and hills, which made it better suited for activities beyond agriculture, such as the ironwork industry.

Karlskoga evolved around the arms manufacturer Bofors, and by 1970, it counted almost 10,000 employees. The many jobs in the arms industry during the 1900s multiplied Karlskoga&#x27;s population. Today, Karlskoga is still a thriving center of the arms industry, but its economy is more diverse than during the peak-Bofors era.

Karlskoga is home to the Björkborn Manor, on the property of the Björkborn Works, where Alfred Nobel lived. His residency there is the reason his will was adjudicated in Karlskoga at Karlshall, establishing the Nobel Prize. Other landmarks include the Nobel Laboratory, the Karlskoga Church, Mässen, and the Bofors Hotel.

== Etymology ==
Karlskoga was initially called &quot;Möckelns bodar&quot;,&quot; Möckelsboderna&quot; or &quot;Bodarna&quot;, being derived from cottages located at the shore of lake Möckeln. The locality&#x27;s name &quot;Karlskoga&quot; was coined in 1591, and has been in use ever since. It is derived from Charles (&quot;Karl&quot;) IX, with &quot;skog&quot; meaning woods.

==History==
=== Pre-16th century ===
=== 16th century ===
Karlskoga and its surrounding area were sparsely populated in the beginning of the 16th century. It was not until the 1580s that the area started to see an increase in population, when Charles IX made people settle in the area. Ethnic Swedes (people from the historical provinces of Närke and Södermanland), and particularly Finns, began to settle the area, where they took up the farming method slash-and-burn. They were followed by Huguenots, fleeing religious oppression in France, and by other groups including both Dutch and German settlers, mostly skilled metalsmiths.

The parish of Karlskoga was established in 1586 and a wooden church was soon built. It was small in size, and was solely made up of the sacristy still preserved at this site, which was a consequence of population increase in the years prior. The first priest elected was Olaus Gestricius (herr Olaf på Möckelnsbodar) by the late 1500s.

=== Industrial era ===
During the 17th century, fourteen small ironworks and eight water-driven hammers for producing bar iron were established. This encompassed the emergence of both Björkborn Works and Bofors Works. As the owner of both ironworks, Sigrid Ekehielm assumed the leadership of an industrial empire.

Most of the original ironworks were still operating in the 1860s, but the dominating ironworks was the one in nearby Bofors. In 1871, Bofors produced 6,124 metric tons of iron, more than any other plant in Sweden. In 1882, Karlskoga Parish (&quot;socken&quot;) had 11,184 inhabitants.

The town of Karlskoga has evolved around Bofors, which in the late 19th century was transformed from an iron works to a manufacturer of cannon and in the 20th century to a more diversified defense industry. Bofors was incorporated in 1873 and has since the 1880s been specializing in the lucrative manufacture of cannon.

=== Alfred Nobel ===
The most famous owner of Bofors was Alfred Nobel, who owned the company from 1894 until his death in December 1896.

Nobel had a key role in reshaping the ironworks to a modern cannon manufacturer and chemical industry. During the summers of 1894–1896 he lived in the manor house Björkborn.

Even though he died in his villa in Sanremo, Italy and had a home in Paris, it was decided that his legal residence was at Björkborn in Karlskoga, which had been his final residence in Sweden. Because of that it was here his famous testament that was written in Paris in 1895 was legally registered, which eventually made it possible to establish the Nobel Prize.

=== Twentieth century ===

In 1940 the town of Karlskoga and the surrounding area (the same territory as today&#x27;s Karlskoga Municipality) got the formal title of a city (&quot;stad&quot;). Since 1971 this term has no legal meaning and only the built-up area is considered a &quot;de facto&quot; town.

Karlskoga spent most of the 20th century as a growing company town to Bofors. Only with the demilitarization in the most recent decades has this started to be a problem for the town. There were 8,500 workers in Bofors in 1980, but the number had decreased to 2,600 as of 1998.

On January 10, 1985, a gas leak occurred in Karlskoga, when a chemical plant released sulfuric acid gas over the area. The incident resulted in the evacuation of 300 people and left 20 individuals injured.

=== Recent history ===
During the first decade of the 21st century, approximately 1,000 apartments in multi-family buildings were demolished due to reduced demand for firearms products. This resulted in the population dwindling to 29,600. During the 2010s, however, the population trend reversed, and the numbers began to rise.

In 2023, the magazine &quot;Fokus&quot; ranked Karlskoga as the fifteenth best municipality to live in Sweden.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===

Karlskoga is situated more or less in a low mountainous ridge called Kilsbergen that separates Närke from Värmland. Such areas have traditionally been financially poor. This led to a significant Swedish emigration to North America from the district in the latter half of the 19th century. Stockholm, Wisconsin was for instance founded in 1854 by immigrants from Karlskoga.

The city borders on the municipalities of Hällefors and Storfors to the north; Lekeberg to the east; Degerfors and the Lake Möckeln to the south; and Kristinehamn to the west.

=== Neighbourhoods ===
The many residential communities of Karlskoga express a character distinct to the company town. Million programme residential buildings can be found in enclaves such as Baggängen, Ekeby, Sandviken and Skranta.

The Rosendal neighbourhood, historically significant for the architecture of its homes, planned community by the Bofors Works, was designated as an area of national interest for cultural heritage.

== Demographics ==
Karlskoga&#x27;s population grew steadily from the time when arms manufacturer Bofors had started to expand, until the 1970s. Thereafter, it underwent a sharp decline (down by almost 10,000 inhabitants over a 30-year period), with signs of recovery only in the very last few years as of 2021. Nevertheless, with 27,386 inhabitants, Karlskoga is the second most populous place in Örebro County following Örebro (126,009).

The presence of foreign residents in Karlskoga accounts for 16.5% of inhabitants. This compares with 19.1% in the town Örebro.

=== Migration ===

In the 1580s, a total of five Finns settled in Möckelsbodar (present-day Karlskoga).&quot;&quot; In 1649, 32 of a total of 186 agricultural holdings were occupied by Finns.

In 2017, the three most commonly reported ethnic origins (by-birth) overall were Finns (935 or 3.1 per cent), Syrians (650 or 2.1 per cent) and Somalis (409 or 1.3 per cent).

=== Language and dialects ===
In 2012, Karlskoga Municipality received its status as a Finnish-speaking administrative municipality.

=== Religion ===
Various religious denominations and congregations are based in Karlskoga, including the Church of Sweden, which has several churches in Karlskoga. The oldest church, the Karlskoga Church, is the parish church in the Karlskoga parish and can be traced back to the 1600s. Later churches built in the city include the Karlberg Church and the Rävåsen Church. There are also several free churches represented in Karlskoga. The Swedish Pentecostal Movement has its own church, while the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have their Kingdom Hall.

A baptist congregation, the Bofors Baptist congregation, was established in 1884, and St. George&#x27;s Catholic congregation was established in 1956.

There are several cemeteries in Karlskoga. The city&#x27;s oldest cemetery was likely established when Karlskoga Church was built. North of it lies Skogskyrkogården , inaugurated in 1908. The Eastern Cemetery in the eastern parts of the city was established in the 1940s.

== Economy ==

=== Manufacturing sector ===
The city is an important center for the arms manufacturing and pharmaceutical industries; it is home to various multinational corporations, including subsidiaries and divisions of Bharat Forge, BAE Systems, Saab AB (SAAB Bofors Dynamics), Nammo, Cambrex Corporation, Recipharm, Moelven Industrier, and Eurenco.

== Culture ==

=== Literature ===

Karlskoga has a connection with notable literary figures, including Maja Ekelöf, whose best-selling &quot;Rapport från en skurhink&quot; was published in 1970. Nobel laureate Selma Lagerlöf stayed in Karlskoga during her confirmation period with Tullius Hammagren. In her 1925 novel &quot;Charlotte Löwensköld,&quot; she depicts estates and surroundings in Karlskoga. Moreover, children&#x27;s literature writers Anders Jacobsson and Sören Olsson are intertwined with Karlskoga, using the town as inspiration for fictional characters and locales, such as in the &quot;Bert Diaries,&quot; which were set in the fictional town of Öreskoga.

=== Media ===
&quot;Karlskoga Tidning-Kuriren&quot; stands as Karlskoga&#x27;s primary and sole daily newspaper. It formed through the merger of &quot;Karlskoga Tidning&quot; and &quot;Karlskoga Kuriren&quot;, the city&#x27;s two former daily newspapers, it came into existence in 2020. There is also a commercial radio station based in Karlskoga, &quot;Cityradion&quot;.

== Sport ==
Karlskoga is home to several stadiums, of which Nobelhallen is the largest (it hosted the 1979 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships). Karlskoga is home to the ice hockey team BIK Karlskoga, established in 1978, currently playing as per the 2021–2022 season in HockeyAllsvenskan, the second tier of Swedish ice hockey.

Karlskoga also upholds a heritage in diving and canoeing, housing clubs like Bofors SHK and Bofors KK. Notable Olympic champions include Ulrika Knape in diving, as well as Agneta Andersson and Maria Haglund in canoeing.

<text>is a Japanese noise punk band. Their name means &quot;Greasy Octopus&quot;. A notable oddity is that none of Aburadako&#x27;s albums have titles and are only distinguished by their packages.

<text>Asiatic Warriors, originally named Cold-N-Loco, were a multilingual hardcore rap crew from Frankfurt, Germany.

Cold-N-Loco was composed of German rapper D-Flame (Daniel Kretschmer), 2 Turkish DJs &amp; producers A-Bomb (Adnan Öztürk) and Combad (Taner Ali Şen). They invited the Kurdish hip hop artist Azad to join the band and it was renamed Asiatic Warriors. It delivered a mix of German, English, and Turkish lyrics along with hard beats.

After the split, D-Flame and Azad went on for solo careers. D-Flame later worked with Combad and A-Bomb for his second solo album &#x27;Daniel X&#x27; in 2002.

<doc id="1016649" wikidata="Q494355" url="?curid=1016649" title="East Frisian language">
<text>East Frisian is one of the Frisian languages. Its last surviving dialect is Saterland Frisian spoken in Saterland in Germany.

There once were two main dialects, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Weser&quot;. Weser, including the Wursten, Harlingerland and Wangerooge dialects, held out until the 20th century. Ems continues with a couple thousand adult speakers of the Saterland dialect. The other member of the Ems dialect, Upgant Frisian, is extinct.

== Phonology ==

The phonology of Eastern Frisian is linguistically conservative with regards to Old Frisian.

== Old East Frisian and its decline ==
Old East Frisian used to be spoken in East Frisia (&quot;Ostfriesland&quot;), the region between the Dutch river Lauwers and the German river Weser. The area also included two small districts on the east bank of the Weser, the lands of Wursten and Würden. The Old East Frisian language could be divided into two dialect groups: Weser Frisian to the east, and Ems Frisian to the west. From 1500 onwards, Old East Frisian slowly had to give way in the face of the severe pressure put on it by the surrounding Low German dialects, and nowadays it is all but extinct.

By the middle of the seventeenth century, Ems Frisian had almost completely died out. Weser Frisian, for the most part, did not last much longer, and held on only until 1700, although there are records of it still being spoken in the land of Wursten, to the east of the river Weser, in 1723. It held out the longest on the island of Wangerooge, where the last Weser Frisian speaker died in 1953. Today, the Old East Frisian language is no longer spoken within the historical borders of East Frisia; however, a large number of the inhabitants of that region are still Frisians, referring to their dialect of Low German as &quot;Freesk&quot;. In this dialect, referred to in Standard German as &quot;Ostfriesisch&quot;, the Frisian substratum is still evident, despite heavy Germanisation.

== Sater Frisian ==

The last remaining living remnant of Old East Frisian is an Ems Frisian dialect called Sater Frisian or Saterlandic (its native name being &quot;&quot;), which is spoken in the Saterland area in the former State of Oldenburg, to the south of East Frisia proper. Saterland (&quot;Seelterlound&quot; in the local language), which is believed to have been colonised by Frisians from East Frisia in the eleventh century, was for a long time surrounded by impassable moors. This, together with the fact that Sater Frisian always had a status superior to Low German among the inhabitants of the area, accounts for the preservation of the language throughout the centuries.

Another important factor was that after the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Saterland became part of the bishopric of Münster. As a consequence, it was brought back under control of the Catholic Church, resulting in social separation from Protestant East Frisia since about 1630. Catholic religious law demanded a confirmation of the non Catholic partner and this condition prevented contact, so marriages of Saterlanders were seldom contracted with East Frisians for some ages.

<text>Nousukausi, a.k.a. Upswing, is a 2003 Finland black comedy film. It is directed by Johanna Vuoksenmaa.

==Story overview==
A well-to-do, young urban professional couple desires an unusual, cutting-edge vacation and seek the help of a travel agent from Invisible Hand Tours. The couple begin their vacation as unemployed slum-dwellers while their manipulative travel agent makes off with everything they own. When the couple realizes they have been duped, they race to track down the con as their lives spiral out of control.

==Plot==

A dissatisfied yuppie couple in the IT business, with no kids and a fancy house in a prestige neighbourhood, have a few weeks off before the husband&#x27;s new career challenges. Envious about their friends&#x27; exotic holiday destinations, the husband meets a travel agent at a party, offering the ultimate experience: a one-month vacation under a false identity in Jakomäki, a suburban block of flats in Helsinki. 
Part of the deal is that their credit cards, house keys, phones, passports, and custom automobile are all traded in for a run-down council-housing apartment and four envelopes each with a weekly cash, equal to a standard unemployment allowance. Acting as an unemployed couple, their street credibility is often questioned by their new neighbours who are more at home with the ways of the concrete jungle. However, they discover after the first week that the second envelope is empty, and that the travel agency where they purchased their extreme vacation, does not exist.

<doc id="1016665" wikidata="Q345335" url="?curid=1016665" title="Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing">
<text>Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing is a routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and other wireless ad hoc networks. It was jointly developed by Charles Perkins (Sun Microsystems) and Elizabeth Royer (now Elizabeth Belding) (University of California, Santa Barbara) and was first published in the ACM 2nd IEEE Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications in February 1999.

AODV is the routing protocol used in Zigbee – a low power, low data rate wireless ad hoc network. There are various implementations of AODV such as MAD-HOC, Kernel-AODV, AODV-UU, AODV-UCSB and AODV-UIUC.

The original publication of AODV won the SIGMOBILE Test of Time Award in 2018. According to Google Scholar, this publication reached 30,000 citations at the end of 2022. AODV was published in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as Experimental RFC 3561 in 2003.

== How it works ==
Each node has its own sequence number that grows monotonically over time and ensures that there are no loops in the paths used. In addition, each network component assigned to routing functionality stores its own path index, which contains the address of the next node in the direction of the destination (next hop), its sequence number, and the total distance given in hops, or possibly other metrics designed to measure link quality.

In AODV, the network remains completely silent until a connection is required to forward a data packet. When routes need to be searched on the network, AODV resorts to the following packets defined by its protocol:

* Route request (RREQ)
* Route reply (RREP)
* Route error (RERR)

These messages can be implemented as simple UDP packets, so routing is still based on the Internet Protocol (IP).

RREQ packets are broadcast from the source node, so a burst of messages is generated and forwarded through the entire network. When a node in the network receives a request packet, it can send an RREP packet through a temporary path to the requesting node, which can then exploit the newly received information. Generally, each node compares different paths based on their length and chooses the most convenient one. If a node is no longer reachable, a RERR message is generated to alert the rest of the network.

Each RREQ has a &quot;time to live&quot; that limits the times it can be retransmitted. In addition, AODV implements a binary backoff mechanism in case the node does not receive a response to its RREQ, whereby requests are repeated at linearly increasing time intervals up to a maximum set by the implementation.

== Evaluation ==
The main advantage of AODV is that it does not generate traffic in the case of already established and working routes. In fact, the algorithm itself is completely irrelevant as long as it does not turn out to be necessary to send a packet to a node whose route is unknown. Beyond that, distance vector-based routing is computationally simple and does not require large amounts of memory.

However, the protocol takes longer than other protocols to establish a connection between two nodes in a network.

<text>Norberg () is a locality and the seat of Norberg Municipality in Västmanland County, Sweden with 4,518 inhabitants in 2010. Best known for the Norbergfestival which is Scandinavias biggest electronic music festival, organized in an old iron ore mine.
Norberg consists of two large parts, the actual Norberg in the south and Kärrgruvan (Marsh Mine) in the north, along with smaller settlements scattered around the area.

==History==
Iron-making in Norberg can be traced back to the 6th century, but the area has been populated since the Nordic Stone Age.

The blast furnace plant at Lapphyttan, probably originates from the 11–1200s (currently under reconstruction elsewhere), shows the beginning of the mining community that grew up in Bergslagen. In the Middle Ages, Norberg was a marketplace where mountain men in the surrounding districts gathered.

The oldest preserved buildings in Norberg are in Norbergsån, the area around Norberg church with farms that originate from the Middle Ages, while many current buildings are from the 18th century. The oldest parts of Norberg&#x27;s church, including the vaults, date from the 13th century. The interior was changed after a big fire in 1727 and the church tower was rebuilt in 1904. In the cemetery is a bone chamber from the 18th century.

Despite an extensive fire in the mid-18th century, one can still see the original settlement pattern in central Norberg with booths, laundries and a wash-house along the river, while farm houses and residential buildings are nearby.

In the 1970s, raw molten iron was transported by rail from the blast furnaces at Spännarhyttan to the steelworks at Surahammar.
Spännarhyttans blast furnace was shut down for good in 1981.

==Landmarks==

Elsa Andersons Konditori is a historic pastry shop. Formerly a hostelry, it was founded in 1916 and is located next to the square in Norberg. It has been awarded with a diploma from the Gastronomy Academy. On 21 August 2015 it was totally destroyed by a fire but it reopened in 2017.

<text>Wilbur de Paris (January 11, 1900 – January 3, 1973) was a trombone player and band leader known for mixing Dixieland jazz with swing.

==Career==
Wilbur de Paris was born January 11, 1900, in Crawfordsville, Indiana. His father, Sidney de Paris Sr., was a musician and taught him and his brother Sidney how to play music. He played alto saxophone in his father&#x27;s circus band.

In 1919, de Paris began his career in Philadelphia in a small band. He visited New Orleans in 1922 and worked with Louis Armstrong and Armand J. Piron. Throughout the 1920s, he worked in Philadelphia and New York, including as band leader. During this time he permanently switched from saxophone to trombone. Among the musicians de Paris worked with were Stuff Smith, Dave Nelson, Noble Sissle (with whom he toured Europe), and Edgar Hayes.

De Paris toured with Teddy Hill&#x27;s orchestra from 1936–1937 and recorded with the Mills Blue Rhythm Band. Again he joined Louis Armstrong, playing with him from the end of 1937 until the end of the decade.

While De Paris remained an obscure figure during this era, his brother Sidney achieved fame as a trumpet soloist. In 1944, the brothers recorded together for the first time as The DeParis Brothers for Commodore Records, producing four songs. He briefly toured with Ella Fitzgerald and Roy Eldridge before leading his own small band.

In late 1945, de Paris broke up his group to join Duke Ellington with whom he stayed until 1947.

Sponsored by the U.S. State Department, de Paris toured Africa in 1957 as part of the President&#x27;s International Program for Cultural Relations.

His music is present in the films of Woody Allen, including &quot;In a Persian Market&quot; in &quot;The Curse of the Jade Scorpion&quot;.

== Death ==
De Paris died in Beekman Downtown Hospital, New York on 3 January 1973. He was survived by two sons and two daughters.

<text>Antigua Caribbean Liberation Movement was a radical socialist and Pan-African political party in Antigua and Barbuda. ACLM was founded in 1968 by Tim Hector, the then chairman of the Progressive Labour Movement. The ideological inspiration for ACLM came from C.L.R. James.

== Ideology ==

ACLM had close contacts with Communist Party of Cuba and other leftist groups in the regions such as the New Jewel Movement of Grenada and favoured the creation of a Caribbean Union. The party also supported anti-Apartheid struggles in South Africa and organised African Liberation Day celebrations in Antigua.

== Electoral strength ==

In the 1980, elections, ACLM won no seats and its electoral strength never advanced much further.

== Merger and dissolution ==

UPP was formed in 1992, through a merger of ACLM, the Progressive Labour Movement and the United National Democratic Party. In February 2002, former ACLM and UPP member Alister Thomas announced that he had formed a new party, National Movement for Change.

<doc id="1016686" wikidata="Q887871" url="?curid=1016686" title="Bob Crosby">
<text>George Robert Crosby (August 23, 1913 – March 9, 1993) was an American jazz singer and bandleader, best known for his group the Bob-Cats, which formed around 1935. The Bob-Cats were a New Orleans Dixieland-style jazz octet. He was the younger brother of famed singer and actor Bing Crosby. On TV, Bob Crosby guest-starred in &quot;The Gisele MacKenzie Show&quot;. He was also a regular cast member of &quot;The Jack Benny Program,&quot; on both radio and television, taking over the role of bandleader after Phil Harris&#x27; departure. Crosby hosted his own afternoon TV variety show on CBS, &quot;The Bob Crosby Show&quot; (1953–1957). Crosby received two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, for television and radio.

== Early years ==
Crosby was born in Spokane, Washington, to bookkeeper Harry Lowe Crosby and Catherine &quot;Kate&quot; Harrigan, the daughter of a builder from County Mayo in Ireland.

The couple had seven children: Larry, Everett, Ted, Harry (popularly known as Bing Crosby), Catherine, Mary Rose, and George Robert, popularly known as Bob.

Crosby attended Gonzaga College, but he dropped out to seek a career in music. During World War II, he served in the U.S. Marine Corps, leading a band for much of his time in service.

== Career ==
=== Singer and bandleader ===

Crosby began singing in the early 1930s with the Delta Rhythm Boys, which included vocalist Ray Hendricks and guitarist Bill Pollard, and with Anson Weeks (1931–34) and the Dorsey Brothers (1934–35). He became a bandleader in 1935 after Ben Pollack&#x27;s band broke up, and many of the former members of that group elected him to lead them. That year, he also recorded with the Clark Randall Orchestra led by Gil Rodin and featuring singer Frank Tennille (a.k.a. Clark Randall). Glenn Miller was a member of that orchestra, and they recorded Miller&#x27;s novelty composition &quot;When Icky Morgan Plays the Organ.&quot; Crosby&#x27;s own band also formed a &quot;band-within-the-band&quot; called the Bob-Cats, a Dixieland octet including soloists from the larger orchestra, many of whom were from New Orleans. The band included at various times Ray Bauduc, Yank Lawson, Billy Butterfield, Charlie Spivak, Muggsy Spanier, Irving Fazola, Nappy Lamare, Jack Sperling, Joe Sullivan, Jess Stacy, Bob Haggart, Walt Yoder, and Bob Zurke.

In the spring of 1940, during a performance in Chicago, teenager Doris Day was hired as the band&#x27;s vocalist.

For its theme song, the band chose George Gershwin&#x27;s song &quot;Summertime.&quot; The band&#x27;s hits included &quot;South Rampart Street Parade,&quot; &quot;March of the Bob Cats,&quot; &quot;In a Little Gypsy Tea Room,&quot; &quot;Whispers in the Dark,&quot; &quot;Day In, Day Out,&quot; &quot;Down Argentine Way,&quot; &quot;You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby,&quot; &quot;Dolores,&quot; and &quot;New San Antonio Rose.&quot; A bass-and-drums duet between Haggart and Bauduc, &quot;Big Noise from Winnetka,&quot; became a hit in 1938–39.

There were reunions in the 1950s and 1960s. During that time there was a revival of interest in big band jazz, and Crosby worked for Disney studios and toured the midwest.

Bob Haggart and Yank Lawson organized a band that combined dixieland and swing to try to carry on the legacy of Bob Crosby. From the late 1960s until the mid-1970s, the band was known as the World&#x27;s Greatest Jazz Band, but when both became dissatisfied with the name they changed it to the Lawson-Haggart Jazz Band.
=== Radio ===
During World War II, Bob Crosby spent 18 months in the Marines touring with bands in the Pacific. His radio variety series, &quot;The Bob Crosby Show,&quot; aired on NBC and CBS in different runs from July 18, 1943, to July 16, 1950. This was followed by &quot;Club Fifteen&quot; on CBS from 1947 through 1953 minus a brief interlude when he was replaced as host by singer Dick Haymes during parts of 1949 and 1950. During his stint on &quot;Club Fifteen,&quot; he was teamed with the ever-popular Andrews Sisters three nights per week, singing with them and engaging in comedy skits. He first met the trio in 1938 when his orchestra backed their Decca recording of &quot;Begin the Beguine,&quot; their popular vocalization of Artie Shaw&#x27;s big band hit. One can&#x27;t help when hearing these old &quot;Club Fifteen&quot; broadcasts how eerily similar Bob and the Andrews Sisters sound to the trio&#x27;s very frequent and hugely successful pairings with brother Bing Crosby on the Decca label. Bob and Patty even scored a hit duet on Decca Records with their duet recording of the novelty &quot;The Pussy Cat Song (Nyow! Nyot Nyow!),&quot; which peaked at No. 12 on Billboard. A half-hour CBS daytime series, &quot;The Bob Crosby Show,&quot; followed from 1953 to 1957. Bob introduced the Canadian singer Gisele MacKenzie to American audiences and subsequently guest-starred in 1957 on her NBC television series, &quot;The Gisele MacKenzie Show.&quot;

On September 14, 1952, he replaced Phil Harris as the bandleader on &quot;The Jack Benny Program,&quot; remaining until Benny retired the weekly radio show in May 1955 after 23 years. In joining the show, he became the leader of the same group of musicians who had played under Harris. According to Benny writer Milt Josefsberg, Crosby was hired for budget reasons. Because of strong competition from TV, the radio program budget had to be reduced, and so Bob replaced Phil. Prior to joining Benny on the radio, Crosby, who was based on the east coast, would often play with Benny during Benny&#x27;s live New York appearances, and he was seen frequently throughout the 1950s on Benny&#x27;s television series.

As a performer, Crosby had tremendous charisma and wit combined with a laid-back persona. He was able to swap jokes competently with Benny, including humorous references to his brother Bing&#x27;s wealth and his string of losing racehorses. An exchange during one of the popular Christmas programs ran thus: Crosby muses to Jack that he&#x27;s bought gifts for everyone but band member Frank Remley. When Jack suggests &quot;a cordial, like a bottle of Drambuie,&quot; Crosby counters that Drambuie is an after-dinner drink and adds, alluding to Remley&#x27;s penchant for alcohol, that &quot;Remley never quite makes it to after dinner.&quot;

=== Television ===
Bob Crosby guest-starred in the television series &quot;The Gisele MacKenzie Show&quot;. He also starred in his own afternoon variety show, &quot;The Bob Crosby&quot; show, that aired from 1953 to 1957. He also fronted a TV program in Australia in the 1960s. He was one of two featured singers (the other being Dennis Day) in mid-1950s episodes of &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Crosby&#x27;s first marriage was to Marie Elizabeth Grounitz. They had a daughter, Elizabeth Ann. He married socialite June Kuhn at his home in Spokane on September 22, 1938. They had five children: Christopher, George, Stephen, Cathleen and Junie. Crosby died in La Jolla, California, on March 9, 1993, at 79, from complications of cancer. 
== Awards and honors ==
Crosby received two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 8, 1960, for television (at 6252 Hollywood Boulevard) and radio (at 6313 Hollywood Boulevard).

<doc id="1016696" wikidata="Q1563454" url="?curid=1016696" title="HD Radio">
<text>HD Radio (HDR) is a trademark for a &quot;so-called&quot; in-band on-channel (IBOC) digital radio broadcast technology. HD radio generally simulcasts an existing analog radio station in digital format with less noise and with additional text information. HD Radio is used primarily by AM and FM radio stations in the United States, U.S. Virgin Islands, Canada, Mexico and the Philippines, with a few implementations outside North America.

HD Radio transmits the digital signals in unused portions of the same band as the analog AM and FM signals. As a result, radios are more easily designed to pick up both signals, which is why the HD in HD Radio is shorthand for &quot;hybrid digital,&quot; not &quot;high definition.&quot; Officially, HD is not intended to stand for any term in HD Radio, it is simply part of iBiquity&#x27;s trademark, and does not have any meaning on its own. HD Radios tune into the station&#x27;s analog signal first and then look for a digital signal. The European DRM system shares channels similar to HD Radio, but the European DAB system uses different frequencies for its digital transmission.

The term &quot;on channel&quot; is a misnomer because the system actually sends the digital components on the ordinarily unused channels &quot;adjacent to&quot; an existing radio station&#x27;s allocation. This leaves the original analog signal intact, allowing enabled receivers to switch between digital and analog as required. In most FM implementations, from 96 to 128 kbit/s of capacity is available. High-fidelity audio requires only 48 kbit/s so there is ample capacity for additional channels, which HD Radio refers to as &quot;multicasting&quot;.

HD Radio is licensed so that the simulcast of the main channel is royalty-free. The company makes its money on fees on additional multicast channels. Stations can choose the quality of these additional channels; music stations generally add one or two high-fidelity channels, while others use lower bit rates for voice-only news and sports. Previously these services required their own transmitters, often on low-fidelity AM. With HD, a single FM allocation can carry all of these channels, and even its lower-quality settings usually sound better than AM.

While it is typically used in conjunction with an existing channel it has been licensed for all-digital transmission as well. Four AM stations use the all-digital format, one under an experimental authorization, the other three under new rules adopted by the FCC in October 2020. The system sees little use elsewhere due to its reliance on the sparse allocation of FM broadcast channels in North America; in Europe, stations are more tightly spaced.

==History==
This standard was meant to supersede other existing stereophonic standards on AM.

iBiquity developed HD Radio, and the system was selected by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2002 as a digital audio broadcasting method for the United States. It is officially known as NRSC‑5, with the latest version being NRSC‑5‑E.

iBiquity was acquired by DTS in September 2015 bringing the HD Radio technology under the same banner as DTS&#x27;s eponymous theater surround sound systems. The HD Radio technology and trademarks were subsequently acquired by Xperi Holding Corporation in 2016.

HD Radio is one of several digital radio standards which are generally incompatible with each other:
* FMeXtra was a competing U.S. standard, but has been stagnant since the 2010s.
* Compatible AM Digital (CAM‑D) for AM stations.
* Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB), a.k.a. Eureka 147, is the most common standard in Europe.
* Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM‑30 and DRM+ configurations) was intended mostly for shortwave radio.

By May 2018, iBiquity Digital Co. claimed its HD Radio technology was used by more than 3,500 individual services, mostly in the United States. This compares with more than 2,200 services operating with the DAB system.

A 400 kHz wide channel is required for HD FM analog-digital hybrid transmission, making its adoption problematic outside of North America. In the United States, FM channels are spaced 200 kHz apart as opposed to 100 kHz elsewhere. Furthermore, long-standing FCC licensing practice, dating from when receivers had poor adjacent-channel selectivity, assigns stations in geographically overlapping or adjacent coverage areas to channels separated by (at least) 400 kHz. Thus most stations can transmit carefully designed digital signals on their adjacent channels without interfering with other local stations, and usually without co-channel interference with distant stations on those channels. Outside the U.S., the heavier spectral loading of the FM broadcast band makes IBoC systems like HD Radio less practical.

The FCC has not indicated any intent to end analog radio broadcasting as it did with analog television, since it would not result in the recovery of any radio spectrum rights which could be sold. Thus, there is no deadline by which consumers must buy an HD receiver.

==Technique==
Digital information is transmitted using OFDM with an audio compression format called HDC (High-Definition Coding). HDC is a proprietary codec based upon, but incompatible with, the MPEG-4 standard HE-AAC. It uses a modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) audio data compression algorithm.

HD equipped stations pay a one-time licensing fee for converting their primary audio channel to iBiquity&#x27;s HD Radio technology, and 3% of incremental net revenues for any additional digital subchannels. The cost of converting a radio station can run between $100,000 and $200,000. Receiver manufacturers who include HD Radio pay a royalty, which is the main reason it failed to be fully-adopted as a standard feature. 

If the HD receiver loses the primary digital signal (HD‑1), it reverts to the analog signal, thereby providing seamless operation between the newer and older transmission methods. The extra HD‑2 and HD‑3 streams do not have an analog simulcast; consequently, their sound will drop-out or &quot;skip&quot; when digital reception degrades (similar to digital television drop-outs). Alternatively the HD signal can revert to a more robust 20 kbit/s stream, although the sound quality is then reduced to conventional AM-level. Datacasting is also possible, with metadata providing song titles or artist information.

iBiquity Digital claims that the system approaches CD quality audio and offers reduction of both interference and static. However, the data rates in HD Radio are substantially lower than from a CD, and the digital signals sometimes interfere with adjacent analog AM band stations. (see § AM, below).

===AM===
The AM hybrid mode (&quot;MA1&quot;) uses 30 kHz of bandwidth (±15 kHz), and overlaps adjacent channels on both sides of the station&#x27;s assigned channel. Some nighttime listeners have expressed concern this design harms reception of adjacent channels with one formal complaint filed regarding the matter: WYSL owner Bob Savage against WBZ in Boston.

The capacity of a 30 kHz channel on the AM band is limited. By using spectral band replication the HDC+SBR codec is able to simulate the recreation of sounds up to 15,000 Hz, thus achieving moderate quality on the bandwidth-tight AM band. The HD Radio AM hybrid mode offers two options which can carry approximately 40~60 kbit/s of data, with most AM digital stations defaulting to the more-robust 40 kbit/s mode, which features redundancy (same data is broadcast twice).

The digital radio signal received on a conventional AM receiver tuned to an adjacent channel sounds like white noise – the sound of a , or a large waterfall, or a strong, steady wind through a dense forest canopy, or similar. 

====All-digital AM====
All-digital AM (&quot;MA3&quot;) allows for two modes: &quot;Enhanced&quot; and &quot;core-only&quot;.
* In enhanced mode, the primary, secondary and tertiary carriers are transmitted, allowing for a maximum throughput of 40.2 kbit/s while using 20 kHz of bandwidth out to the station&#x27;s 0.5 mV/m contour. Inside this contour, stereo audio along with graphics (station logo and &quot;artist experience&quot; album artwork) and text information (the station&#x27;s call sign, title, album, and artist) can be decoded by the receiver.
: Beyond the station&#x27;s 0.5 mV/m contour, typically only the primary carriers can be received, which restricts the maximum throughput to 20.2 kbit/s while only requiring 10 kHz of bandwidth.
* In core-only mode, the station only transmits the primary carriers.

When the receiver can only decode the primary carriers in either mode, the audio will be mono and only text information can be displayed. The narrower bandwidth needed in either all-digital mode compared to hybrid mode reduces possible interference to and from stations broadcasting on adjacent channels. However, all-digital AM lacks the analog signal for &quot;fallback&quot; when the signal is too weak for the receiver to decode the primary digital carrier.

Four stations have operated as all-digital / digital-only broadcasters:
* WWFD has had special temporary authority from the FCC since July 2018 to broadcast all-digital.
* WMGG (since January 2021), WFAS (from May 2021 until its October 2024 deletion) and WSRO (since December 2021) broadcast all-digital under new rules adopted by the FCC on 27 October 2020 that allow any AM station to voluntarily choose to convert to all-digital operation. However, WMGG subsequently dropped MA3 and WSRO left the air.

WWFD experimented with using a digital subchannel, operating a second channel (HD2) at a low data rate while reducing the data rate of the primary channel (HD1). In October 2020, the FCC concluded from WWFD&#x27;s experiments:
: &quot;The record does not establish that an audio stream on an HD-2 subchannel is currently technically feasible&quot;.
The FCC requires stations that wish to multiplex their digital AM signals to request and receive permission to do so; in early 2020 it rejected a multiplex request from WTLC.

===FM===


The FM hybrid digital / analog mode offers four options which can carry approximately 100, 112, 125, or 150 kbit/s of data carrying (lossy) compressed digital audio depending upon the station manager&#x27;s power budget and desired range of signal. HD FM also provides several pure digital modes with up to 300 kbit/s rate, and enabling extra features like surround sound. Like AM, purely-digital FM provides a &quot;fallback&quot; condition where it reverts to a more robust 25 kbit/s signal.

FM stations can divide their datastream into sub-channels (e.g., 88.1 HD‑1, HD‑2, HD‑3) of varying audio quality. The multiple services are similar to the digital subchannels found in ATSC-compliant digital television using multiplexed broadcasting. For example, some top 40 stations have added hot AC and classic rock to their digital subchannels, to provide more variety to listeners. Stations may eventually go all-digital, thus allowing as many as three full-power channels and four low-power channels (seven total). Alternatively, they could broadcast one single channel at 300 kbit/s.

FCC rules require that one channel be a simulcast of the analog signal so that when the primary digital stream cannot be decoded, a receiver can fall back to the analog signal. This requires synchronization of the two, with a significant delay added to the analog service. In some cases, particularly during tropospheric ducting events, an HD receiver will lock on to the digital stream of a distant station even though there is a much stronger local analog-only station on the same frequency. With no automatic identification of the station on the analog signal, there is no way for the receiver to recognize that there is no correlation between the two. The listener can possibly turn HD reception off (to listen to the local station, or avoid random flipping between the two stations), or listen to the distant stations and try to get a station ID.

Although the signals may be synchronized at the transmitter and reach the receiving equipment simultaneously, what the listener hears through an HD unit and an analog radio played together can be distinctly unsynchronized. This is because all analog receivers process analog signals faster than digital radios can process digital signals. The digital processing of analog signals in an HD Radio also delays them. The resulting unmistakable &quot;reverb&quot; or echo effect from playing digital and analog radios in the same room or house, tuned to the same station, can be annoying. It is more noticeable with simple voice transmission than with complex musical program content.

Stations can transmit HD through their existing antennas using a diplexer, as on AM, or are permitted by the FCC to use a separate antenna at the same general location, or at a site licensed as an analog auxiliary, provided it is within a certain distance and height referenced to the main analog signal. The limitation assures that the two transmissions have nearly the same broadcast range, and that they maintain the proper ratio of signal strength to each other so as not to cause destructive interference at any given location where they may be received.

====Artist Experience====

HD Radio supports a service called &quot;Artist Experience&quot; in which the transmission of album art, logos, and other graphics can be displayed on the receiver. Album art and logos are displayed at the station&#x27;s discretion, and require extra equipment. An HD Radio manufacturer should pass the iBiquity certification, which includes displaying the artwork properly.

====EAS alerts====
Since 2016, newer HD Radios support Bluetooth and Emergency Alert System (EAS) alerts in which the transmission of traffic, weather alerts, AMBER, and security alerts can be displayed on the radio. As with &quot;Artist Experience&quot;, emergency alerts are displayed at the station&#x27;s discretion, and require extra equipment.
====Bandwidth and power====
FM stereo stations typically require up to 280 kilohertz of spectrum. The bandwidth of an FM signal is found by doubling the sum of the peak deviation (usually 75 kHz) and the highest baseband modulating frequency (around 60 kHz when RBDS is used). Only 15 kHz of the baseband bandwidth is used by analog monaural audio (baseband), with the remainder used for stereo, RBDS, paging, radio reading service, rental to other customers, or as a transmitter/studio link for in-house telemetry.

In (regular) hybrid mode a station has ±130 kHz of analog bandwidth. The primary main digital sidebands extend ±70 kHz on either side of the analog signal, thus taking a full 400 kHz of spectrum. In extended hybrid mode, the analog signal is restricted to ±100 kHz. Extended primary sidebands are added to the main primary sidebands using the extra ±30 kHz of spectrum created by restricting the analog signal. Extended hybrid provides up to approximately 50 kbit/s additional capacity. Any existing subcarrier services (usually at 92 kHz and 67 kHz) that must be shut down to use extended hybrid can be restored through use of digital subchannels. However, this requires the replacement of &quot;all&quot; related equipment both for the broadcasters and all of the receivers that use the services shifted to HD subchannels.

The ratio of power of the analog signal to the digital signal was initially standardized at 100:1 (−20 dBc), i.e., the digital signal power is 1% of the analog carrier power. This low power, plus the uniform, noise-like nature of the digital modulation, is what reduces its potential for co-channel interference with distant analog stations. Unlike with subcarriers, where the total baseband modulation is reduced, there is no reduction to the analog carrier power. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) requested a 10 dB (10×) increase in the digital signal from the FCC. This equates to an increase to 10% of the analog carrier power, but no decrease in the analog signal. This was shown to reduce analog coverage because of interference, but results in a dramatic improvement in digital coverage. Other levels were also tested, including a 6 dB or fourfold increase to 4% (−14 dBc or 25:1). National Public Radio was opposed to any increase because it is likely to increase interference to their member stations, particularly to their broadcast translators, which are secondary and therefore left unprotected from such interference. Other broadcasters are also opposed (or indifferent), since increasing power would require expensive changes in equipment for many, and the already-expensive system has so far given them no benefit.

There are still some concerns that HD FM will increase interference between different stations, even though HD Radio at the 10% power level fits within the FCC spectral mask. North American FM channels are spaced 200 kHz apart. An HD broadcast station will not generally cause interference to any analog station within its 1 mV/m service contour – the limit above which the FCC protects most stations. However, the IBOC signal resides within the analog signal of the immediately adjacent station(s). With the proposed power increase of 10 dB, the potential exists to cause the degradation of the second-adjacent analog signals within its 1 mV/m contour.

On 29 January 2010, the U.S. FCC approved a report and order to voluntarily increase the maximum digital effective radiated power (ERP) to 4% of analog ERP (−14 dBc), up from the previous maximum of 1% (−20 dBc). Individual stations may apply for up to 10% (−10 dBc) if they can prove it will not cause harmful interference to any other station. If at least six verified complaints of ongoing RF interference to another station come from locations within the other station&#x27;s licensed service geographic region, the interfering station will be required to reduce to the next level down of 4%, 2% (−17 dB), or 1%, until the FCC finally determines that the interference has been satisfactorily reduced. The station to which the interference is caused bears the burden of proof and its associated expenses, rather than the station that causes the problem. For grandfathered FM stations, which are allowed to remain over the limit for their broadcast class, these numbers are relative to that lower limit rather than their actual power.

==Comparison to other digital radio standards==

===HD versus DAB===
Some countries have implemented Eureka-147 Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) or the newer DAB+ version. DAB broadcasts a single multiplex that is approximately 1.5 megahertz wide (≈1 megabit per second). That multiplex is then subdivided into multiple digital streams of between 9~12 programs (or stations). In contrast, HD FM requires 400 kHz bandwidth – compatible with the 200 kHz channel spacing traditionally used in the ITU Region 2 (including the United States) – with capability of 300 kbit/s in digital-only mode.

The gradually phased out first generation DAB uses the MPEG-1 Audio Layer II (MP2) audio codec which has less efficient compression than newer codecs. The typical bitrate for DAB stereo programs is 128 kilobit per second or less and as a result most radio stations on DAB have a poorer sound quality than FM does under similar conditions. Many DAB stations also broadcast in mono. In contrast, DAB+ uses the newer AAC+ codec and HD FM uses a codec based upon the MPEG-4 HE-AAC standard.

Before DAB+ was introduced, DAB&#x27;s inefficient compression led in some cases to &quot;downgrading&quot; stations from stereophonic to monaural, in order to include more channels in the limited 1 Mbit/s bandwidth.

Digital radio allows for more stations and less susceptibility for disturbances in the signal. In the United States, however, other than HD Radio, digital broadcast technologies, such as DAB+, have not been approved for use on either the VHF band II (FM) or medium wave band.

DAB better suits national broadcasting networks that provide several stations as is common in Europe, whereas HD is more appropriate for individual stations.

===HD versus DRM===
Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM 30) is a system designed primarily for shortwave, medium wave, and longwave broadcasting with compatible radios already available for sale. DRM 30 is similar to HD AM, in that each station is broadcast via channels spaced 10 kHz (or 9 kHz in some regions) on frequencies up to 30 MHz. The two standards also share the same basic modulation scheme (COFDM), and HD AM uses a proprietary codec. DRM 30 operates with xHE-AAC, historically with any of a number of codecs, including AAC, Opus, and HVXC. The receiver synchronization and data coding are quite different between HD AM and DRM 30. As of 2015 there are several radio chipsets available which can decode AM, FM, DAB, DRM 30 and DRM+, and HD AM and HD FM.

Similar to HD AM, DRM allows either hybrid digital-analog broadcasts or pure digital broadcasts, DRM allows broadcasters to use multiple options:
* Hybrid mode (digital/analog) - 10 kHz analog plus 5 kHz digital bandwidth allows 5–16 kbit/s data rate;
* 10 kHz digital-only bandwidth confined to ±5 kHz of the channel center allows 12–35 kbit/s;
* 20 kHz digital-only bandwidth using ±10 kHz (including half of the adjacent channels) allows 24–72 kbit/s.

On the medium wave, actual DRM bit rates vary depending on day versus night transmission (groundwave versus skywave) and the amount of bits dedicated for error correction (signal robustness).

Although DRM offers a growth path for AM broadcasters, it shares some issues with HD Radio in the AM:
* Shorter broadcast distance in hybrid mode compared to an analog AM signal
* Interference with adjacent channels when using the 20 kHz mode though in all-digital mode the signal fits inside the designated channel mask.

DRM+, a different system based upon the same principles of HD Radio on the FM band, but can be implemented in all the VHF bands (&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;3&quot;), either as a hybrid analog-digital or digital only broadcast, but with 0.1 MHz digital-only bandwidth, it allows 186.3 kbit/s data rate (compared to HD FM with 0.4 MHz allowing 300 kbps.)

Digital Radio Mondiale is an open standards system, albeit one that is subject to patents and licensing. HD Radio is based upon the intellectual property of iBiquity Digital Co. / Xperi Holding Co. 
The United States uses DRM for HF / shortwave broadcasts.

==Acceptance and criticism==

===Awareness and coverage===
According to a survey dated 8 August 2007 by Bridge Ratings, when asked the question, &quot;Would you buy an HD Radio in the next two months?&quot; Only 1.0% responded &quot;yes&quot;.

Some broadcast engineers have expressed concern over the new HD system. A survey conducted in September 2008 saw a small percentage of participants that confused HD Radio with satellite radio.

Many first-generation HD Radios had insensitive receivers, which caused issues with sound quality. The HD Radio digital signal level is 10–20 dB below the analog signal power of the station&#x27;s transmitter. In addition, commentators have noted that the analog section of some receivers were inferior compared to older, analog-only models.

However, since 2012, HD capable receiver adoption has significantly increased in most newer cars, and several aftermarket radio systems both for vehicles and home use contain HD Radio receivers and special features such as Full Artist Experience. iBiquity reports that 78% of all radio listening is done on stations that broadcast in HD. There are an increasing number of stations switching to HD or adding subchannels compatible with digital radio, such as St. Cloud, Minnesota, where many local radio outlets find a growing number of listeners tuning in to their HD signals, which in turn has benefited sales.

===Different format and compatibility standards===
Even though DAB and DRM standards are open standards and predate HD Radio, HD receivers cannot be used to receive these stations when sold or moved overseas (with certain exceptions; there are HD stations in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Taiwan, Japan, Romania, and a few other countries).

DAB and DRM receivers cannot receive HD signals in the U.S. The HD system, which enables AM and FM stations to upgrade to digital without changing frequencies, is a different digital broadcasting standard. The lack of a common standard means that HD receivers cannot receive DAB or DRM broadcasts from other countries, and vice versa, and that manufacturers must develop separate products for different countries, which typically are not dual-format.

Whereas the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) family of codecs are publicly documented standards, the HDC codec exists only within the HD system, and is an iBiquity trade secret.

Similarly DAB or DRM are open specifications, while iBiquity&#x27;s HD specification is partly open, but mostly private.

HD Radio does not use ATSC, the standard for digital television in the United States, and so fails to recover the former TV and FM radio compatibility enjoyed by TV channel 6 broadcasters. In the days of analog television, the lowest sliver of the FM broadcast band (87.7–87.9 MHz) overlapped with the FM audio carrier of U.S. analog television&#x27;s channel 6; because the NTSC analog television standard used conventional analog FM to modulate the audio carrier, the audio of television stations that broadcast on channel 6 could be heard on most FM receivers. In earlier days of television and radio, several television stations exploited this overlap and operated as radio stations. Full-powered television stations were forced to cease their analog broadcasts in June 2009, and low-powered stations ceased analog broadcasts by July 2021. Because the digital television and all digital radio standards are incompatible, HD receivers are not able to receive digital TV signals on the 87.75 MHz frequency, eliminating the former dual-medium compatibility of channel 6 television stations. Current low-power ATSC 3.0 channel 6 stations that broadcast an audio carrier on 87.75 do not have HD Radio.

===Reduced-quality concerns===
Promotion for HD Radio often fails to make clear that some of its features are mutually incompatible with other features. For example, the HD system has been described as &quot;CD quality&quot;; however, the HD system also allows multiplexing the data stream between two or more separate programs. A program utilizing one half or less of the data stream does not attain the higher audio quality of a single program allowed the full data stream. The FCC has declared
: &quot;one free over-the-air digital stream [must be] of equal or greater quality than the station&#x27;s existing analog signal&quot;.

If the FCC disallows analog simulcasting, each station will have over 300 kbit/s bandwidth available, allowing for good stereo quality or even surround sound audio, together with multiple sub-channels, and to a lesser extent more freedom for low-power, personal FM transmitters, to pair modern smartphones, computers, and other devices to legacy analog FM receivers.

The broadcasting industry is seeking FCC approval on future HD receiver models, for conditional access; that is, enabling the extra subchannels to be available only by paid subscription. NDS has made a deal with iBiquity to provide HD Radio with an encrypted content-delivery system called &quot;RadioGuard&quot;. NDS claims that RadioGuard will &quot;provide additional revenue-generating possibilities&quot;.

Mostly all existing FM receivers tuned to a channel broadcasting a HD signal are prone to increased noise on the analog signal, called &quot;HD Radio self-noise&quot;, due to analog demodulation of the digital signal(s). In some high fidelity FM receivers in quality playback systems, this noise can be audible and irritating. Most all existing FM receivers will require modifications to the internal filters or the addition of a post-detection filter to prevent degradation of the analog signal quality on stations broadcasting HD Radio.

===Reduced analog signal===
Radio stations are licensed in the United States to broadcast at a specific effective radiated power level. In 2008, NPR Labs did a study of predicted HD Radio operation if the digital power levels were increased to 10% of the maximum analog carrier power as is now allowed by the FCC under certain circumstances, and found the digital signal would increase RF interference on FM. However the boosted digital HD signal coverage would then exceed analog coverage, with 17% more population covered in vehicles but 17% less indoors.

===High costs===
The costs of installing the system, including fees, vary from station to station, according to the station&#x27;s size and existing infrastructure. Typical costs are at least several tens of thousands of dollars at the outset plus per-channel annual fees (3% of the station&#x27;s annual revenue) to be paid to Xperi for HD‑2 and HD‑3 (HD‑1 has no royalty charge). Large companies in larger media markets – such as iHeartRadio or Cumulus Broadcasting – can afford to implement the technology for their stations. However, community radio stations, both commercial and noncommercial, in many cases cannot afford the US$1,000 yearly Xperi fee assessed to LPFM stations. During mid-2010 a new generation of HD Radio broadcasting equipment was introduced, greatly lowering the startup costs of implementing the system. 

HD Radio receivers cost anywhere from around US$50 to several hundred dollars, compared to regular FM radios which can sometimes even be found at dollar stores. 
Although costs have historically been higher for HD hardware, as adoption has increased, prices have been reduced, and receivers containing HD Radio are becoming more commonplace – especially as more stations broadcast in HD format.

===Power consumption===
Conventional analog-only FM transmitters normally operate with &quot;class C&quot; amplifiers, which are efficient, but not linear; HD Radio requires a different amplifier class. A class C amplifier can operate with overall transmitter efficiency higher than 70%. Digital transmitters operate in one of the other amplifier classes – one that is close to linear, and linearity lowers the efficiency. A modern hybrid HD FM transmitter typically achieves 50~60% efficiency, whereas an HD digital-only FM transmitter should manage just 40~45%. The reduced efficiency causes significantly increased costs for electricity and for cooling.

==Programming==
Until 2013, the HD Digital Radio Alliance, acted as a liaison for stations to choose unduplicated formats for the extra channels (HD‑2, HD‑3, etc.). Now, iBiquity works with the major owners of the stations to provide various additional choices for listeners, instead of having several stations independently deciding to create the same format. HD‑1 stations broadcast the same format as the regular FM (and some AM) stations, and many of these stations offer one, two, or even three subchannels (designated HD‑2, HD‑3, HD‑4) to complement their main programming.

iHeartRadio is selling programming of several different music genres to other competing stations, in addition to airing them on its own stations. Some stations are simulcasting their local AM or lower-power FM broadcasts on sister stations&#x27; HD‑2 or HD‑3 channels, such as KFNZ-FM in Kansas City simulcasting 610 AM KFNZ&#x27;s programming on 96.5 FM‑HD2. It is common practice to broadcast an older, discontinued format on HD‑2 channels; for example, with the recent disappearance of the smooth jazz format from the analog radio dial in many markets, stations such as WDZH‑FM in Detroit, Michigan, (formerly WVMV), WFAN-FM in New York City, and WNWV-FM in Cleveland, Ohio, program smooth jazz on their HD‑2 or HD‑3 bands. Some HD‑2 or HD‑3 stations are even simulcasting sister AM stations. In St. Louis, for example, clear-channel KMOX‑AM (1120 kHz analog and HD) is simulcast on KEZK-FM 102.5 FM‑HD3. KBCO‑FM in Boulder, Colorado, uses its HD‑2 channel to broadcast exclusive live recordings from their private recording studio. CBS Radio is implementing plans to introduce its more popular superstations into distant markets (KROQ-FM into New York City, WFAN‑AM into Florida, and KFRG-FM and KSCF‑FM into Los Angeles) via HD‑2 and HD‑3 channels.

On 8 March 2009, CBS Radio inaugurated the first station with an HD4 subchannel, WJFK-FM in Washington, D.C., a sports radio station which also carries sister sports operations WJZ-FM from Baltimore; Philadelphia&#x27;s WTEL‑AM and WIP-FM; and WFAN‑AM from New York. Since then numerous other channels have implemented HD‑4 subchannels as well, although with nearly 100% talk-based formats, because of the reduced audio quality. For example, KKLQ‑FM in Los Angeles operates an HD‑4 signal and aired The Mormon Channel which was 99% talk.

Public broadcasters are also embracing HD Radio. Minnesota Public Radio offers a few services: KNOW-FM, the MPR News station in the Twin Cities, offers music service Radio Heartland on 91.1 FM‑HD2 and additional news programming called &quot;BBC News and More&quot; on 91.1 FM‑HD3; KSJN-FM, the classical MPR station in the Twin Cities, provides &quot;Classical 24&quot; service on 99.5 FM‑HD2; and KCMP-FM, on 89.3 FM in the Twin Cities, offers &quot;Wonderground Radio&quot;, music for kids and their parents, on 89.3 FM‑HD2.

KPCC‑FM (Southern California Public Radio), heard on 89.3 FM in Los Angeles, offers a digital simulcast of its analog channel on 89.3 FM‑HD1 and MPR&#x27;s music service KCMP-FM on 89.3 FM‑HD2 in Los Angeles.

New York Public Radio in New York City, WNYC (AM) and WNYC-FM, (d.b.a. WNYC) re-broadcasts a locally programmed, all-classical service from WQXR-FM called &quot;Q2&quot;, on 93.9 FM‑HD2. The service launched in March 2006. On 8 October 2009, the format was moved to WQXR‑HD2 (WXNY-FM) on 105.9 FM when WQXR-FM was acquired by New York Public Radio as part of a frequency swap with Univision Radio for their former frequency. The programming on the WNYC-FM‑HD2 channel now is a rebroadcast of WQXR-FM, in order to give full coverage of WQXR-FM programming in some form, as the 105.9 FM signal is weaker, and does not cover the whole area.

WMIL-FM in Milwaukee has offered an audio simulcast of Fox affiliate WITI‑TV on their HD‑3 subchannel since August 2009 as part of a news and weather content agreement between iHeartRadio and WITI‑TV. This restored WITI‑TV&#x27;s audio to the Milwaukee radio dial after a two-month break, following the digital transition; as a channel 6 analog television station WITI‑TV exploited the 87.7 FM audio quirk as an advantage, in order to allow viewers to hear the station&#x27;s newscasts and Fox programming on their car radios.

KYXY‑FM, operated by CBS in San Diego on 96.5 FM and offers their HD‑2 channel as one of the few &quot;subchannel only&quot; independent Christian music based formats on HD Radio. Branded as &quot;The Crossing&quot;, it is operated by Azusa Pacific University.

College radio has also been impacted by HD Radio, stations such as WBJB-FM which is a public station on a college campus offer a student run station as one of the multicast channels. WKNC-FM in Raleigh, NC, runs college radio programming on HD‑1 and HD‑2, and electronic dance music on WolfBytes Radio on WKNC-FM‑HD3.

Some commercial broadcasters also use their HD‑2 channels to broadcast the programming of noncommercial broadcasters. Bonneville International uses its HD‑2 and HD‑3 channels to broadcast Mormon Channel which is entirely noncommercial and operates solely as a public service from Bonneville&#x27;s owner, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. That network of eight HD‑2 and HD‑3 stations was launched on 18 May 2009 and was fully functional within two weeks. Also, in Detroit, WMXD-FM, an urban adult contemporary station, airs the contemporary Christian K-Love format on its HD‑2 band (the HD‑2 also feeds several analog translators around the metropolitan area – see below), due to an agreement between iHeartMedia and K-Love owner Educational Media Foundation (EMF), allowing EMF to program WMXD-FM&#x27;s HD‑2 channel. On a similar note, Los Angeles&#x27; KRRL 92.3 FM‑HD3 signal rebroadcasts EMF&#x27;s Air1, and in Santa Barbara KLSB 97.5 FM airs K-Love on its primary frequency, and rebroadcasts Air1 on HD‑2 (though neither supports &quot;Artist Experience&quot;). In St. Louis, Missouri, WFUN 96.3-HD2 rebroadcasts K297BI for the classical music station Classic 107.3.

In July 2018, as part of a projected one year experiment, WWFD‑AM in Frederick, Maryland, became the first AM station to eliminate its analog transmissions and broadcast exclusively in digital.

===Translators===
Although broadcast translators are prohibited from originating their own programming, the FCC has controversially allowed translator stations to rebroadcast in standard analog FM the audio of an HD Radio channel of the primary station the translator is assigned to. This also allows station owners, who already usually own multiple stations locally and nationally, to avoid the rulemaking process of changing the table of allotments as would be needed to get a new separately-licensed station, and to avoid exceeding controlling-interest caps intended to prevent the excessive concentration of media ownership. Such new translator stations can block new LPFM stations from going on the air in the same footprint. Translator stations are allowed greater broadcast range (via less restrictive height and power limitations) than locally originated LPFM stations, so they may occupy a footprint in which several LPFMs might have been licensed otherwise.

In addition to the controversial practice of converting the HD-only secondary radio channels of a primary station into analog FM in areas where the primary station&#x27;s signal can already readily be received, translators can also be used in a more traditional manner to extend the range of the full content of the primary station, including the unmodified main signal and any HD Radio sub-channels, in areas where the station has poor coverage or reception, as is done via the remote transmitter K202BD in Manti, Utah, which rebroadcasts both the analog and digital signals of KUER-FM from Salt Lake City.

In order to do this, HD Radio may be passed along from the main station via a &quot;bent pipe&quot; setup, where the translator simply makes a frequency shift of the entire channel, often by simple heterodyning. This may require an increase in bandwidth in both the amplifier and radio antenna if either is too narrowband to pass the wider HD Radio signal, meaning one or both might have to be replaced. Baseband translators which use a separate receiver and transmitter require an HD Radio transmitter, just as does the main station. Translators are not &quot;required&quot; to transmit an HD Radio digital signal, and the vast majority of existing translators which repeat FM stations running hybrid HD signals do not repeat the HD part of the radio broadcast, due to technical limitations in equipment designed before the advent of HD Radio technology.

==Receivers==

===Automotive and home/professional===

By 2012, there were several HD receivers available on the market. A basic model costs around US$50.

Automotive HD receiver manufacturers include:
Most car manufacturers offer HD receivers as audio packages in new cars, including:
Home and office listening equipment is available from a number of companies in both component receiver and tabletop models, including:
===Portable===

Initially, portable HD receivers were not available due to the early chipsets either being too large for a small enclosure and / or needing too much power to be practical for a battery-operated device. However, in January 2008 at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, iBiquity unveiled a prototype of a new portable receiver, roughly the size of a cigarette pack. Two companies made low-power chipsets for HD receivers:
* Samsung 
* SiPort

At least five companies made portable HD receivers:
* Coby Electronics Corporation produced the first HD portable – the Coby HDR‑700 portable HD receiver for both AM and FM.
* Griffin Technology produced an HD receiver designed to plug into the dock connector of an Apple iPod, or iPhone, with tuning functionality provided via software through the device&#x27;s multi-touch display. This product was discontinued.
* Best Buy started selling the Insignia NS‑HD01, a house brand portable unit on 12 July 2009. It was the second portable HD receiver to come to the general market and featured FM‑only playback and a non-removable rechargeable battery which charges via mini USB. The Insignia unit sold in 2009 for around US$50 – the least expensive receiver available. Best Buy discontinued the NS‑HD01 model by September 2019 in favor of the NS-HD02.
* Microsoft released the on 15 September 2009. It included an HD receiver embedded in the media device. The Zune HD was discontinued in November 2011 in favor of Windows Phones.
* Sangean Electronics produces multiple portable HD radios with AM and FM reception, like the Sangean HDR-14 portable receiver.

By 2012, iBiquity was trying to get HDR chipsets into mobile phones.

<doc id="1016702" wikidata="Q1151748" url="?curid=1016702" title="The Man with the Twisted Lip">
<text>&quot;The Man with the Twisted Lip&quot;, one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is the sixth of the twelve stories in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The story was first published in the &quot;Strand Magazine&quot; in December 1891. Doyle ranked &quot;The Man with the Twisted Lip&quot; sixteenth in a list of his nineteen favourite Sherlock Holmes stories.

==Plot==
The story begins when a friend of Dr. Watson&#x27;s wife comes to Watson&#x27;s house, frantic because her husband, who is addicted to opium, has gone missing. Watson helps her pull him out of the opium den and sends him home. Watson is surprised to find that Sherlock Holmes is there too, in disguise and trying to get information to solve a different case about a man who has disappeared. Watson stays to listen to Holmes tell the story of the case of Neville St. Clair.

St. Clair is a prosperous, respectable, punctual man. His family&#x27;s home is in the country, but he visits London every day on business. One day when Mr. St. Clair was in London, Mrs. St. Clair also went to London separately. She happened to pass down Upper Swandam Lane, a &quot;vile alley&quot; near the London docks, where the opium den is. Glancing up, she saw her husband at a second-floor window of the opium den. He vanished from the window immediately, and Mrs. St. Clair was sure that there was something wrong.

She tried to enter the building; but her way was blocked by the opium den&#x27;s owner, a lascar. She fetched the police, but they did not find Mr. St. Clair. The room behind the window was the lair of a dirty, disfigured beggar, known to the police as Hugh Boone. The police were about to put her story down as a mistake of some kind when Mrs. St. Clair noticed a box of wooden toy bricks that her husband said he would buy for their son. A further search turned up some of St. Clair&#x27;s clothes. Later, his coat, with the pockets stuffed with hundreds of pennies and halfpennies, was found on the bank of the River Thames, just below the building&#x27;s back window.

Hugh Boone was arrested at once, but would say nothing, except to deny any knowledge of St. Clair. He also resisted any attempt to make him wash. Holmes was initially quite convinced that St. Clair had been murdered, and that Boone was involved. Thus he investigated the den in disguise. He and Watson return to St. Clair&#x27;s home, to a surprise. It is several days after the disappearance; but on that day Mrs. St. Clair had received a letter from her husband in his own handwriting, with his wedding ring enclosed, telling her not to worry. This forces Holmes to reconsider his conclusions, leading him eventually to an extraordinary solution.

Holmes and Watson go the police station where Hugh Boone is held; Holmes brings a bath sponge in a Gladstone bag. Finding Boone asleep, Holmes washes the sleeping Boone&#x27;s dirty face—revealing Neville St. Clair.

Mr. St. Clair has been leading a double life, as a respectable businessman, and as a beggar. In his youth, he had been an actor before becoming a newspaper reporter. In order to research an article, he had disguised himself as a beggar for a short time, and was able to collect a surprising amount of money due to a skillset uncommon to beggars; his actor&#x27;s skills enabled him to emulate a more sympathetic character with make-up, as well as provide a repertoire of witty dialogue with which to entertain passers-by to offer coins—he was as much a street performer as a beggar. Later, he was saddled with a large debt, and returned to the street to beg for several days to pay it off. His newspaper salary was meagre and, tempted by the much larger returns of begging, he eventually became a &quot;professional&quot; beggar. His takings were large enough (£700 a year, ) that he was able to establish himself as a country gentleman, marry well, and begin a respectable family. His wife and children never knew what he did for a living, and when arrested, he feared exposure more than prison or the gallows. But there is no murder, so he is released, and Holmes and the police agree to keep Mr. St. Clair&#x27;s secret as long as no more is heard of Hugh Boone.

==Points of interest==
The ability of St. Clair to earn a good living begging is considered by some to be an unlikely event, but others disagree.

Doyle may have got the idea of a professional man making his money from begging from a short story by William Makepeace Thackeray called &quot;Miss Shum&#x27;s Husband&quot; (1838).

In one in-universe point of interest, Watson&#x27;s wife Mary calls him by the name &quot;James&quot; despite his established first name being &quot;John&quot;. This led Dorothy L. Sayers to speculate that Mary may be using his middle name Hamish (an Anglicisation of &quot;Sheumais&quot;, the vocative form of &quot;Seumas&quot;, the Scottish Gaelic for James), though Doyle himself never addresses this beyond including the initial.

June 19 of 1889, the day when the story begins was actually Wednesday, whilst Watson states it&#x27;s Friday.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Man with the Twisted Lip&quot; was first published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in December 1891, and in the United States in the US edition of the &quot;Strand&quot; in January 1892. The story was published with ten illustrations by Sidney Paget in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in October 1892.

==Adaptations==
===Film and television===
A silent short film version of the story titled &quot;The Man with the Twisted Lip&quot; was released in 1921. It was made as part of the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Holmes.

In 1951, Rudolph Cartier produced an adaptation entitled &quot;The Man Who Disappeared&quot;. This adaptation was a pilot for a proposed television series starring John Longden as Holmes and Campbell Singer as Watson.

In 1964, the story was adapted into an episode of the BBC series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Douglas Wilmer and Nigel Stock, with Peter Madden as Inspector Lestrade and Anton Rodgers as Neville St Clair. The adaptation developed St Clair&#x27;s attributed ability at repartee by showing him quoting from the classics, including Shakespeare.

Granada Television also produced a version in 1986, adapted by Alan Plater as part of their &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; television series, starring Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke, with Denis Lill as Inspector Bradstreet, Clive Francis as Neville St. Clair, and Albert Moses as the Lascar.

An episode of the animated television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century&quot; was adapted from the story. The episode, titled &quot;The Man with the Twisted Lip&quot;, aired in 2000.

The 2014 &quot;Sherlock&quot; episode &quot;His Last Vow&quot; begins with Sherlock being found in a drug den by John, reminiscent of the scene in the opium den from this story.

===Radio===

Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which aired on 24 November 1930, starring Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Remakes of the script aired on 12 May 1935 (with Louis Hector as Holmes and Lovell as Watson) and 22 February 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson).

Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that aired on 23 October 1939. Other episodes in the same series that were adapted from the story aired in 1940, 1943, 1944, and 1946 (with Frederick Worlock as Neville St Clair and Herbert Rawlinson as Inspector Bradstreet).

A radio adaptation aired on the BBC Light Programme in 1959, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. It was adapted by Michael Hardwick.

&quot;The Man with the Twisted Lip&quot; was dramatised by Peter Mackie for BBC Radio 4 in 1990, as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson.

The story was adapted as an episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. The episode first aired in 2012.

<doc id="1016706" wikidata="Q1416215" url="?curid=1016706" title="GoDaddy">
<text>GoDaddy Inc. is an American publicly traded Internet domain registry, domain registrar and web hosting company headquartered in Tempe, Arizona, and incorporated in Delaware. GoDaddy is the world&#x27;s fifth largest web host by market share, with over 62 million registered domains. The company has around 21 million customers and over 6,900 employees worldwide.

==History==

GoDaddy was founded in 1997 in Phoenix, Arizona, by entrepreneur Bob Parsons. Prior to founding GoDaddy, Parsons had sold his financial software services company Parsons Technology to Intuit for $65 million in 1994. He came out of his retirement in 1997 to launch Jomax Technologies, taking its name from a road in Phoenix Arizona.

In 1999, a group of employees at Jomax Technologies were brainstorming a new company name, with &quot;Big Daddy&quot; being a popular suggestion. However, finding this domain name already taken, &quot;Go Daddy&quot; was purchased instead. Parsons believed this to be a simple and memorable name. Jomax Technologies rebranded to GoDaddy in February 2006. The original GoDaddy logo consisted of a cartoon man with messy hair and sunglasses.

By 2001, GoDaddy was approximately the same size as competitors Dotster and eNom. In April 2005, GoDaddy became the largest ICANN-accredited registrar on the Internet. GoDaddy received a strategic investment, in 2011, from private equity funds, KKR, Silver Lake, and Technology Crossover Ventures.

In 2017, GoDaddy acquired the security platform Sucuri. In April 2017, GoDaddy acquired the Host Europe Group, including firms 123 Reg (at that point the UK&#x27;s largest domain name registrar, with more than 3 million names registered and 1.3 million websites hosted), Domain Factory, and Heart Internet, for 1.69 billion euros ($1.82 billion). In March 2018, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced that GoDaddy was migrating the vast majority of its infrastructure to AWS as part of a multi-year transition.

In January 2020, GoDaddy unveiled a new logo with a simple, sans-serif type accompanied by a heart-shaped design that spells out &quot;GO&quot;. In April 2021, the headquarters relocated from Scottsdale, Arizona to Tempe, Arizona.

GoDaddy is expected to join the S&amp;P 500 index in June 2024.

== Acquisitions and mergers ==
==Infrastructure==
In 2013, GoDaddy was reported as the largest ICANN-accredited registrar in the world, at the size of four times their closest competitor. They also have a facility in Phoenix, Arizona.

The website PeeringDB records that GoDaddy maintains two autonomous systems. They allow services to be accessed across the global internet. AS-26496, the main autonomous system, is reachable from six cities at nine public &amp; private peering facilities.

==GoDaddy Registry==
In 2020, GoDaddy completed the acquisition of the domain registry services of Neustar and renamed the service &quot;GoDaddy Registry&quot;.Initially, GoDaddy Registry operated the country code top-level domains .co and .us, and generic top-level domains such as .biz and .club.

As of January 2025, operating under the legal name &quot;Registry Services, LLC&quot;, GoDaddy Registry operates the following top-level domains according to the IANA root database: .abogado, .beer, .biz, .blackfriday, .boston, .casa, .club, .compare, .cooking, .courses, .dds, .design, .fashion, .fishing, .fit, .garden, .gay, .health, .horse, .ink, .law, .luxe, .miami, .photo, .rodeo, .select, .study, .surf, .tattoo, .us, .vip, .vodka, .wedding, .wiki, .work, .yoga

==Marketing==

GoDaddy is known for its advertising on TV and in newspapers, particularly in the US market.

Celebrity endorsers have included pro-golfer Anna Rawson, Marina Orlova, personal trainer Jillian Michaels, and Jean-Claude Van Damme.

GoDaddy started advertising in the Super Bowl in 2005. Since then, the company has expanded its marketing to include sports sponsorships.

Also, GoDaddy was co-sponsor for ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 that was hosted in England and Wales.

====Super Bowl advertisements====

GoDaddy&#x27;s 2007 Super Bowl XLI advertisement was criticized in the &quot;New York Times&quot; as being &quot;cheesy&quot;; in &quot;National Review&quot; as &quot;raunchy, &#x27;Girls-Gone-Wild&#x27; style&quot;; and &quot;just sad&quot; by Barbara Lippert in &quot;Adweek&quot;, who gave the advertisement a &quot;D&quot; grade.

The 2008 Super Bowl XLII GoDaddy advertisement received a negative response from the press. &quot;Adweek&quot;&#x27;s Barbara Lippert described it as a &quot;poorly produced scene in a living room where people are gathered to watch the Super Bowl. As we watch them watch, a guy at his computer in the corner of the room drags the crowd over to GoDaddy.com to view the banned ad instead.&quot; Lippert also said, &quot;it will probably produce a Pavlovian response in getting actual viewers in their own living rooms to do the same.&quot;

In 2009, GoDaddy purchased spots for two different commercials featuring GoDaddy Girl and IndyCar Series driver Danica Patrick for Super Bowl XLIII. In &quot;Shower&quot;, Danica takes a shower with Simona Fusco Stratten as three college students control the women&#x27;s maneuvers from a computer. &quot;Baseball&quot; is a spoof of the steroids scandal. While &quot;Shower&quot; won GoDaddy&#x27;s online vote, &quot;Baseball&quot; was the most popular of the Super Bowl. Both helped increase domain registrations by 110 percent above 2008 post-Super Bowl levels. GoDaddy posted Internet-only versions of its commercials during the game, which were extended versions containing more risque content. &quot;Baseball&quot; was the most watched Super Bowl commercial according to TiVo, Inc. According to Comscore, GoDaddy ranked first in advertiser Web site follow-through. Rob Goulding, head of business-to-business markets for Google, offered an in-depth analysis of Super Bowl spots that aired during Sunday&#x27;s championship game. He said the most successful were multichannel-oriented, driving viewers to Web sites and &quot;focusing on conversion as never before&quot;. GoDaddy experienced significant Web traffic and a strong &quot;hangover&quot; effect of viewer interest in the days that followed due to a provocative &quot;teaser&quot; advertisement pointing to the Web, Goulding said.

GoDaddy also advertised during the 2010 Super Bowl XLIV, purchasing two spots. The commercials &quot;Spa&quot; and &quot;News&quot; starred GoDaddy Girl and racecar driver Danica Patrick. In &quot;Spa&quot;, Patrick is getting a lavish massage when the masseuse breaks into a spontaneous GoDaddy Girl audition. In &quot;News&quot;, anchors conduct a &#x27;gotcha&#x27; interview with GoDaddy Girl Danica Patrick about commercials known for being too hot for television. According to Akamai, there was a large spike in Internet traffic late in the fourth quarter of the game. This spike was tied to GoDaddy&#x27;s &quot;News&quot; advertisement airing. CEO Bob Parsons said GoDaddy received &quot;a tremendous surge in Web traffic, sustained the spike, converted new customers and shot overall sales off the chart&quot;.

In 2013, GoDaddy moved away from salacious advertising practices in an attempt to improve its brand image. In 2016, GoDaddy did not advertise during the Super Bowl for the first time in over a decade, but returned in 2017 with their &quot;The Internet Wants You&quot; campaign.

In 2025, GoDaddy returned to Super Bowl advertising for the first time in eight years with a commercial promoting their AI service Airo starring actor Walton Goggins.

====IndyCar====

In 2009 and 2010, GoDaddy advertised during the Indianapolis 500.

For the Las Vegas race in 2011, GoDaddy created a promotion wherein driver Dan Wheldon would have won $2.5m each for himself and fan Ann Babenco if he won the race, starting from last place. A 15-car pileup, 11 laps into the race, injured four drivers and killed Wheldon.

====NASCAR====
GoDaddy sponsored Brad Keselowski in the #25 for Hendrick Motorsports on a limited basis in the Sprint Cup series (owing to the &quot;part-time rookie exemption&quot; to a four-car limit). After a successful 2008 season, GoDaddy is expanding its 2009 NASCAR sponsorship with the JR Motorsports organization, sponsoring 20 Nationwide Series races as the primary sponsors, split between the #5 and #88 teams. The #88 deal gave Keselowski a full 35-race NASCAR Nationwide Series sponsorship for 2009 split with Delphi and Unilever. GoDaddy will also be the primary sponsor for seven races in the Sprint Cup Series with Keselowski driving. GoDaddy.com signed a one-year deal with Darlington Raceway to sponsor the 53rd Annual Rebel 500, the fifth-oldest race on the Sprint Cup circuit. Keselowski got his third Nationwide victory at Dover – his first in the #88 GoDaddy.com Chevrolet. In the same season, Keselowski scored a second Nationwide victory in the #88 GoDaddy.com Chevrolet at the first ever NASCAR race at Iowa Speedway and then at Michigan.

For 2010, the Hendrick/GoDaddy association continued; Danica Patrick drove a 12-race schedule in the #7 GoDaddy.com Chevrolet for JR Motorsports, while GoDaddy.com was also the primary sponsor for Mark Martin in the #5 Chevrolet Impala for most of the 2010 and 2011 seasons.

In 2012, Danica Patrick moved from the IndyCar Racing Series to race full-time in the NASCAR Nationwide Series in the #7 and part-time in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series in the #10 for Stewart Haas Racing where GoDaddy.com was the primary sponsor for the full season on both cars. After finishing 10th in the Nationwide Series standings with one pole award in 2012, Patrick moved to full-time in the Sprint Cup Series in 2013 where GoDaddy sponsored her full-season schedule. Patrick rewarded GoDaddy for their sponsorship by winning the pole for the 2013 Daytona 500, becoming the first woman to do so.

GoDaddy chose not to continue its sponsorship of NASCAR in 2016, intending to shift sponsorship to avenues with greater international reach. However, GoDaddy is trying to retain Patrick on a personal service contract.

====GoDaddy Bowl====
For the 2010 through 2015 college football seasons, GoDaddy was the sponsor of the GoDaddy Bowl, a postseason bowl game played in Mobile, Alabama, which was previously branded as the GMAC Bowl before GMAC took TARP funding in 2009. The game matched teams from the Sun Belt Conference and the Mid-American Conference. The bowl was renamed the Dollar General Bowl after the variety store chain Dollar General took over sponsorship in 2016.

===Philanthropy===
In 2009, GoDaddy donated $50,000 to the Lincoln Family Downtown YMCA in Arizona, despite the organization requesting only $1,000. In December 2009, at GoDaddy&#x27;s annual Holiday Party, Executive Chairman and Founder Bob Parsons and Danica Patrick announced that GoDaddy would be donating $500,000 to the Phoenix-based UMOM New Day Center to fund the Danica Patrick GoDaddy.com Domestic Violence Center.

An order was placed with Orange County Choppers for a custom motorcycle to raise contributions for charity. This was documented by the reality show &quot;American Chopper&quot;.

==IPO and private equity==
On April 12, 2006, Marketwatch reported that GoDaddy.com, Inc., had hired Lehman Brothers to manage an initial stock offering that could raise more than $100 million and value the company at several times that amount. On May 12, 2006, GoDaddy filed an S-1 registration statement prior to an initial public offering. On August 8, 2006, Bob Parsons, announced that he had withdrawn the company&#x27;s IPO filing due to &quot;market uncertainties&quot;.

In September 2010, GoDaddy put itself up for auction. GoDaddy called off the auction several weeks later, despite reports that bids exceeded the asking price of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. On June 24, 2011, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that private-equity firms KKR and Silver Lake Partners, along with a third investor, were nearing a deal to buy the company for between $2–2.5 billion. On July 1, 2011, GoDaddy confirmed that KKR, Silver Lake Partners, and Technology Crossover Ventures had closed the deal. Although the purchase price was not officially announced it was reported to be $2.25 billion, for 65% of the company.

, Bob Parsons stepped down as CEO into the role of Executive Chairman.

In March 2012, a class action lawsuit was filed against GoDaddy regarding private registration charges for services it advertises as free.

In June 2014, GoDaddy once again filed a $100 million IPO with the Security and Exchange Commission. The filing gave an inside look into GoDaddy&#x27;s finances and showed that the company has not made a profit since 2009 and since 2012 has experienced a total loss of $531 million. Along with the IPO announcement, GoDaddy&#x27;s founder Bob Parsons announced he is stepping down as Executive Chairman though he will remain on the board. CEO Blake Irving, joined GoDaddy on January 6, 2013 and served as chief executive officer before retiring on December 31, 2017.
On April 1, 2015, GoDaddy had a successful IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, with the stock soaring 30% on the first day of trading.

Scott W. Wagner (and former GoDaddy Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer) was appointed chief executive officer on December 31, 2017. The newly appointed CEO Aman Bhutani has replaced the former CEO Scott W. Wagner and had assumed the charge of his duties from September 4, 2019.

== Controversies ==
=== Suspension of Seclists.org and purchase of No Daddy ===
GoDaddy has been involved in several controversies related to unethical business practices and censorship.

On January 24, 2007, GoDaddy deactivated the domain of computer security site Seclists.org, taking 250,000 pages of security content offline. The shutdown resulted from a complaint from MySpace to GoDaddy regarding 56,000 user names and passwords posted a week earlier to the full-disclosure mailing list and archived on the Seclists.org site as well as many other websites. Seclists.org administrator Gordon Lyon, who goes by the handle &quot;Fyodor,&quot; provided logs to CNET showing GoDaddy de-activated the domain 52 seconds after leaving him a voicemail, and he had to go to great lengths to get the site reactivated. GoDaddy general counsel Christine Jones stated that GoDaddy&#x27;s terms of service &quot;reserves the right to terminate your access to the services at any time, without notice, for any reason whatsoever.&quot; The site seclists.org is now hosted with Linode. The suspension of seclists.org led Lyon to create NoDaddy.com, a consumer activist website where dissatisfied GoDaddy customers and whistleblowers from GoDaddy&#x27;s staff share their experiences. On July 12, 2011, an article in &quot;The Register&quot; reported that, shortly after Bob Parsons&#x27; sale of GoDaddy, the company purchased gripe site No Daddy. The site had returned a top 5 result on Google for a search for GoDaddy.

===China domains===

In March 2010, GoDaddy stopped registering .cn domains (China) due to the high amount of personal information that is required to register in that country. Some called it a public relations campaign since it closely followed Google&#x27;s revolt in China. GoDaddy&#x27;s top lawyer Christine Jones told Congress, &quot;We were having to contact Chinese users to ask for their personal information and begrudgingly give it to Chinese authorities. We decided we didn&#x27;t want to become an agent of the Chinese government.&quot;

GoDaddy resumed registering .cn domain names in February 2016 as part of its push into the Asia market.

===Super Bowl XLIX Puppy Ad===

On January 27, 2015, GoDaddy released its Super Bowl ad on YouTube. Called &quot;Journey Home&quot;, the commercial featured a Retriever puppy named Buddy who was bounced out of the back of a truck. After making a journey home his owners are relieved because they just sold him on a website they built with GoDaddy. GoDaddy claims the ad was supposed to be funny and an attempt to make fun of all the puppies shown in Super Bowl ads. Most notably, Budweiser&#x27;s famous Super Bowl ad also featured a Retriever puppy. The ad found very few fans from the online community. Animal advocates took to social media calling the ad disgusting, callous, and accusing the commercial of advocating for puppy mills. An online petition collected 42,000 signatures.

GoDaddy&#x27;s CEO, Blake Irving, wrote a blog entry later that day promising that the commercial would not air during the Super Bowl. He wrote on his blog &quot;At the end of the day, our purpose at GoDaddy is to help small businesses around the world build a successful online presence. We hoped our ad would increase awareness of that cause. However, we underestimated the emotional response. And we heard that loud and clear.&quot; He goes on to say that Buddy was purchased from a reputable breeder and is part of the GoDaddy family as Chief Companion Officer.

===Namecheap rivalry===

On December 11, 2011, rival domain name registrar Namecheap claimed that GoDaddy was in violation of ICANN rules by providing incomplete information in order to hinder the protest moves of domain names from GoDaddy to Namecheap, an accusation which GoDaddy denied, claiming that it was following its standard business practice to prevent WHOIS abuse. GoDaddy still maintains the strict policy of 60 days lock in inter-registrar domain transfers, if there is a change in registrant information. Many other registrars are giving an option for their customers to opt-out from this 60-day lock as per the ICANN Policy which states: &quot;The Registrar must impose a 60-day inter-registrar transfer lock following a Change of Registrant, provided, however, that the Registrar may allow the Registered Name Holder to opt out of the 60-day inter-registrar transfer lock prior to any Change of Registrant request&quot;.

At this time GoDaddy does allow customers who update their domain contact information to opt out of the 60-day lock upon verification.

===Backing of SOPA and resultant boycott===

On December 22, 2011, a thread was started on the social news website Reddit, discussing the identity of supporters of the United States Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), which included GoDaddy. GoDaddy subsequently released additional statements supporting SOPA. A boycott and transfer of domains were proposed. This quickly spread across the Internet, gained support, and was followed by a proposed Boycott GoDaddy Day on December 29, 2011. One strong supporter of this action was Cheezburger CEO Ben Huh, who threatened that the organization would remove over 1,000 domains from GoDaddy if they continued their support of SOPA. Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales also announced that all Wikipedia domains would be moved away from GoDaddy as their position on SOPA was &quot;unacceptable&quot;. After a brief campaign on Reddit, imgur owner Alan Schaaf transferred his domain from GoDaddy.

GoDaddy pulled its support for SOPA on December 23, releasing a statement saying &quot;GoDaddy will support it when and if the Internet community supports it.&quot; Later that day, CEO Warren Adelman could not commit to changing GoDaddy&#x27;s position on the record in Congress when asked, but said &quot;I&#x27;ll take that back to our legislative guys, but I agree that&#x27;s an important step.&quot; When pressed, he said &quot;We&#x27;re going to step back and let others take leadership roles.&quot; He felt that the public statement removing their support would be sufficient for now, though further steps would be considered. Further outrage was due to the fact that many Internet sites and domain registrars would be subject to shutdowns under SOPA, but GoDaddy is in a narrow class of exempted businesses that would have immunity, whereas many other domain operators would not.

By December 24, 2011, GoDaddy had lost 37,000 domains as a result of the boycott. GoDaddy gained a net 20,748 domains.

===COVID-19 fake employee bonus===

In December 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated economic crisis, the company tricked employees into thinking they had earned a bonus of $650, instead, they were told they had failed a phishing test and were required to do social engineering training. After significant media criticism, the company apologized to its staff but did not offer actual bonuses.

===Deplatforming clients in protest===

On January 11, 2021, the company deplatformed the web forum AR15.com following the U.S. Capitol attack. GoDaddy told &quot;Axios&quot; that the action was due to the site&#x27;s failure to moderate content &quot;that both promoted and encouraged violence.&quot; The National Shooting Sports Foundation, in a message from its president, condemned what it called the &quot;de-platforming of gun sites&quot; as a &quot;dark harbinger&quot; for discussion of controversial issues and an &quot;indiscriminate silencing of opinion and debate.&quot;

===Texas Heartbeat Act===

In September 2021, the company canceled a contract with the pro-life group Texas Right to Life which was running a website encouraging whistleblowing of those who were breaking the &quot;Texas Heartbeat Act&quot;. Owned by the Texas Right to Life group, the website was used as a platform for the public to submit tips on suspected pregnancy terminations in Texas. In a statement to Ars Technica, Texas Right to Life Director of Media and Communication Kimberlyn Schwartz noted that, &quot;We will not be silenced. If anti-Lifers want to take our website down, we&#x27;ll put it back up.&quot;

=== Data breaching ===
On February 16, 2023, the company filed its compulsory annual 10-K report with the US SEC. Under the sub-heading Operational Risks, it revealed that the company suffered multiple data breaches in the last three years, which impacted more than one million GoDaddy customers.

<text>, also known as You, was a Japanese musician, best known as guitarist of the influential heavy metal band Dead End. Before joining Dead End in 1986, he was in the band Terra Rosa, and also ran a guitar school.

==Career==
You was largely influenced by UFO guitarist Michael Schenker. At 16, he joined his first band Steeler, performing covers of UFO, Rainbow, and Deep Purple. In 1982, You was a member of Terra Rosa and a year later of Jesus, before joining Dead End in 1986. That same year the band released their debut studio album, &quot;Dead Line&quot;, on the independent record label Night Gallery. You became the main composer of their songs. They released three more major studio albums until 1990, when Dead End disbanded.

You formed the short-lived band Goatcore with Color bassist Marry. He later also worked with Ryuichi Kawamura (from Luna Sea), Nami Tamaki and Cozy Murakami among others and released two solo albums. In 2009, Dead End reunited and released two studio albums.

In 2016, You reunited with his Terra Rosa bandmates Kazue Akao and Masashi &quot;Jill&quot; Okagaki to perform a limited-time tour, supported by Animetal bassist Masaki and former Galneryus drummer Jun-ichi Satoh. They only performed older songs at the three shows, with the exception of one new composition by You. A live album from the tour, &quot;Terra Rosa Live from Coda&quot;, was released in 2017. You released his fourth solo album &quot;Andromedia&quot; on March 13, 2019. The instrumental album features The Yellow Monkey member Eiji &quot;Annie&quot; Kikuchi on drums and Atsushi Hasegawa of Ded Chaplin on bass. That same day, a remastered version of Jesus&#x27; demo tape &quot;Le Dernier Slow&quot; was released. In addition to bonus live tracks, it also includes a new recording of &quot;Sahara&quot;, which You had written just as he left the band decades earlier at age 19. &quot;Youcoustic&quot;, the guitarist&#x27;s first acoustic album, was released on March 18, 2020.

You performed live with Hasegawa and drummer Tetsuya Hoshiyama on June 14, 2020, for an audience-less concert that was streamed online. On June 19, 2020, Dead End announced that You had died from sepsis on June 16, aged 56. On August 9, Tokyo FM aired a special memorial program to You hosted by Ryuichi Kawamura and featuring guests such as his Dead End bandmates, Eiji Kikuchi and music critics. Sugizo, who cites You as one of his guitar influences, included a cover of Dead End&#x27;s &quot;So Sweet So Lonely&quot; on his December 2020 album &quot;Love &amp; Tranquility&quot; as a tribute to You. Morrie held a concert in You&#x27;s memory on the first anniversary of his death, where the singer reminisced and talked about his former bandmate in addition to performing. He covered You&#x27;s solo song &quot;Immoral&quot;, after writing lyrics to go with the instrumental. A memorial concert for You was held at Spotify O-East on June 16, 2022. In addition to a Dead End session featuring Morrie and Sugizo, a group featuring members of Terra Rosa performed in addition to several others.

<text>Dillenburg, officially Oranienstadt Dillenburg, is a town in Hesse&#x27;s Gießen region in Germany. The town was formerly the seat of the old Dillkreis district, which is now part of the Lahn-Dill-Kreis.

The town lies on the German-Dutch holiday road called the Orange Route, joining towns, cities and regions associated with the House of Orange-Nassau, as well as on the German Timber-Frame Road and the Rothaarsteig hiking trail.

==Geography==

===Location===
Dillenburg lies on the eastern edge of the Westerwald range in the narrow valley of the river Dill, which flows from Hesse-Westphalia border to Wetzlar, emptying into the Lahn. The Dietzhölze flows into the Dill in Dillenburg.




===Neighbouring communities===
Dillenburg borders in the north on the community of Eschenburg, in the east on the community of Siegbach, in the south on the town of Herborn, and the community of Breitscheid, and in the west on the town of Haiger (all in the Lahn-Dill-Kreis).

===Constituent communities===
Dillenburg is divided into the centres of Donsbach, Eibach, Frohnhausen, Manderbach, Nanzenbach, Niederscheld and Oberscheld.

====Donsbach====
Donsbach lies approximately 4 km southwest of the Dillenburg main town.

====Eibach====
Eibach has some 1,450 inhabitants.

The village, whose livelihood was once based on mining, lies among the other constituent communities of Nanzenbach, Oberscheld and Niederscheld. Its healing spring, whose water is heavy with iron, makes the village a favourite among locals. At Eastertime, it is decorated.

====Frohnhausen====
With roughly 3,900 inhabitants, Frohnhausen is the largest of the constituent communities after the main town of Dillenburg.

====Manderbach====
Manderbach lies on a plateau 3 km north of the main town of Dillenburg.

====Nanzenbach====
Nanzenbach lies approximately 6 km north of the main town of Dillenburg. The tallest mountain of Dillenburg, the Eschenburg at an elevation of 589 m, is part of the Nanzenbach area.

====Niederscheld====
Niederscheld is a village with about 3000 inhabitants, lying 2 km from the main town of Dillenburg. The name comes from a small brook called the Schelde that rises between Oberscheld and Tringenstein and flows into the Dill at Niederscheld. The village&#x27;s greatest hallmarks are the old blast furnace and the Adolfshütte industrial park. Towards the end of the Second World War, the village suffered comparatively heavy damage from Allied air raids.
Niederscheld had been appointed a target, because parts for the V-2 rocket were built at the Adolfshütte.

====Oberscheld====
Oberscheld is a village of about 2,000 inhabitants. It neighbours Niederscheld. Mining was quite important for Oberscheld until the last blast furnace was closed in 1969. Oberscheld had a station, the last train ran in Oberscheld in 1987.

==History==
Dillenburg had its first documentary mention in 1254. Dillenburg was the ancestral seat of the Orange branch of the House of Nassau. Dillenburg Castle was built on top of the peak now called the Schlossberg in the late 13th or early 14th century. There are no pictures of this castle, however, as it was wooden, and was destroyed in the Dernbacher Feud.

From his stately home in exile, William I of Orange-Nassau, who was born in Dillenburg, organized the Dutch resistance against Spain (1567–1572), which still occasions regular Dutch royal visits to the town to this day. The land was administered by the presidents of the House of Nassau-Dillenburg. One of the last presidents was Georg Ernst Ludwig Freiherr von Preuschen von und zu Liebenstein (born 1727 in Diethardt; died 1794 in Bad Ems). In the Seven Years&#x27; War, the stately home was destroyed (1760), and Wilhelmstraße (a street) was built out of the remains.

In 1797, one of the earliest schools of forestry in Europe, founded a decade earlier at Hungen by Georg Ludwig Hartig, was moved to Dillenburg. It continued in Dillenburg until 1805, when Hartig lost his position as Inspector of Forests for the Prince of Orange-Nassau, when the principality was dissolved by Napoleon.

In 1875, the Wilhelmsturm (tower), views from which can be seen in this article, was completed on the Schlossberg. It is today the town&#x27;s landmark. The &quot;casemates&quot; under the former stately home are among the biggest defensive works in Europe. They have been partly excavated and may be toured.

In the 19th century came the Industrial Revolution with the building of the Deutz–Gießen railway and the use of iron ore found on the Lahn, Dill and Sieg. Many mines, foundries and metalworking operations came into being in the region. In this time, many railway branchlines were built from Dillenburg to, among other places, Gönnern and Ewersbach. These lines have all been abandoned now. The line to Gönnern was abandoned in 1987 and torn up. The railway depot, so useful in the time of steam traction, was shut down in 1983.

In the Second World War, Dillenburg became a target of Allied attacks due to its marshalling yard. In later years that yard was closed and ore mining became ever less profitable and in 1968, the last blast furnace, in Oberscheld, ceased operations.

As of November 2017, the town&#x27;s name was officially extended to &quot;Oranienstadt Dillenburg&quot; to reference Dillenburg&#x27;s special connection to the House of Orange-Nassau as its ancestral seat.

===Eibach===
Eibach&#x27;s history began in &quot;Nassau times&quot; in the 13th century. In 1313, the village had its first documentary mention. In the Second World War, it was left unscathed. In 2004, the healing spring was renovated, and a brineworks was built.

===Manderbach===

Manderbach had its first documentary mention in 1225, making it older than the main town of Dillenburg (1254). The two former villages – nowadays parts of Dillenburg – Frohnhausen and Manderbach, had much in common in their early history. Here the two noble families von Hunsbach and von Selbach both held sway. As in Frohnhausen, there was also a great fire in Manderbach – albeit 148 years before Frohnhausen&#x27;s – which, having been started by a lightning strike, burnt 38 houses down within an hour and a half on 29 April 1630.

===Nanzenbach===
The name Nanzenbach was mentioned for the first time in a document on 8 May 1325. This document mentions &quot;die Nantzenbecher&quot; — &quot;the inhabitants of Nanzenbach&quot;.

==Coat of arms==
The oldest town seals, dating from the 15th to 19th centuries, show the same composition as Dillenburg&#x27;s current civic coat of arms. The arms were conferred officially in 1907 and confirmed in 1934. The lion inside the gateway is the Lion of Nassau.

==Economy and infrastructure==

===Transport===
The bypass on Federal Highway (&quot;Bundesstraße&quot;) B277 opened in April 2007. It is a tunnel under the Schlossberg, bypassing the historic Old Town with its timber-frame houses and it was one of Germany&#x27;s biggest tunnel projects. As a result of the bankruptcy of the contractor for the works, Walter Bau, completion of the project was delayed by more than a year.

Dillenburg station is on the Dill line, part of the original Cologne-Gießen Railway. It runs from Gießen to Siegen and connects central Hesse with the Rhineland and the Ruhr. The Heller Valley Railway, runs from Betzdorf via Burbach to Dillenburg. The Dillenburg station was once a major freight terminal for iron mining in the Schelderwald.

<text>Gwili Andre (born Gurli Ingeborg Elna Andresen; 4 February 1907 – 5 February 1959) was a Danish model and actress who had a brief career in Hollywood films.

==Early years==
Born in Frederiksberg, Andre had two sisters. Her parents were Carl Axel Andresen and Emma Marie Ellen Sørensen Bruun, they married in 1904. Her parents divorced, and her father remarried in 1917.

== Career ==
Andre came to Hollywood in the early 1930s with the intention of establishing herself as a film star after working as model in Europe. In 1930, she moved to New York City with her first husband where she was reportedly spotted by David O. Selznick at the premiere of a Broadway show. Selznick was taken by her beauty, and he arranged for a screen test.

She was signed to RKO Studio, and in 1932 appeared in &quot;Roar of the Dragon&quot; and &quot;Secrets of the French Police&quot;. While her striking looks were likened to that of Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich, her acting garnered poor reviews. One newspaper columnist called her &quot;stiff, colorless and completely talentless performer.&quot; Despite the poor reviews of her acting, RKO began using her glamorous looks to promote her career. A widespread publicity campaign ensured that her name and face became well known to the American public, but her next role in &quot;No Other Woman&quot; (1933), opposite Irene Dunne, was not the success the studio expected. Over the next few years, she was relegated to supporting roles which included a role in the Joan Crawford picture &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Face&quot; (1941).

==Personal life==
Andre was married twice. She was married to realtor Stanisław Mlotkowski in 1929. They separated in 1930 and divorced in 1935. Andre then married engineer William Dallas Cross, Jr. in 1943. They had a son, Peter Lance Cross, in February 1944. They divorced in 1948.

==Later years and death==
By the early 1940s, Andre&#x27;s film career had come to a standstill. Her final role was a minor part in &quot;The Falcon&#x27;s Brother&quot;, one of the popular Falcon series, in 1942. She did not return to the screen, but she spent the rest of her life trying to orchestrate a comeback. Andre returned to her native Denmark with her son after her divorce from William Cross, Jr. but returned to New York City in 1954. She eventually moved back to California.

On 5 February 1959, Andre died in a fire that started in her apartment in Venice, California where she lived alone. The cause of the fire never was determined. Upon her death, she was cremated at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, and her ashes sent for burial at Søndermark Cemetery in Copenhagen, Denmark.

<text>Aurelius of Carthage was a Christian saint who died around 430. A friend of Augustine of Hippo, he was bishop of Carthage from about 391 until his death.

==Life==
Not much is known about his life outside of his ecclesiastical activities. At the time when Augustine of Hippo returned to Africa in 388, Aurelius was a deacon. Aurelius served as a patron to Augustine when Augustine was a Hippo. Augustine sought the establishment of a monastic community – for which space was granted by bishop Valerius – and was funded by Aurelius. Aurelius provided the monastery with new members for the purpose of episcopal training, effectively turning the monastery into a sort of early episcopal seminary. Augustine admired Aurelius, and a number of letters from Augustine to Aurelius have survived. 

Aurelius became Bishop of Carthage around 392 and led a number of ecclesiastical councils on Christian doctrine and clerical discipline, including the important Council of 419 which codified &quot;The Code of Canons of the African Church&quot;. Aurelius was one of the first Bishops to denounce Pelagianism. He encouraged veneration of the martyrs, and introduced the feast day of Saint Cyprian. 

Aurelius&#x27;s feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is July 20.

<text>The Alogi (), also called Alogoi or Alogians, were a group of heterodox Christians in Asia Minor that flourished c. 200 CE, and taught that the Gospel of John and the Apocalypse of John were not the work of the Apostle, but his adversary Cerinthus. What we know of them is derived from their doctrinal opponents, whose literature is extant, particularly Epiphanius of Salamis. It was Epiphanius who coined the name &quot;Alogi&quot; as a word play suggesting that they were both illogical and they were against the Christian doctrine of the Logos. While Epiphanius does not specifically indicate the name of its founder, Dionysius Bar-Salibi, citing a lost work of Hippolytus (&quot;Capita Adversus Caium&quot;), writes in his commentary on the Apocalypse,Hippolytus of Rome says: A man appeared, named Caius, saying that the Gospel is not by John, nor the Apocalypse but that it is by Cerinthus the heretic.According to fourth century church historian Eusebius of Caesarea, Caius was a churchman of Rome who wrote during the time of Pope Zephyrinus, and had published a disputation with Proclus, a Montanist leader in Rome.

== Beliefs ==
“St. Epiphanius (&quot;Haer&quot;. LI) gives a long account of the party of heretics who arose after the Cataphrygians, Quartodecimans, and others, and who received neither the Gospel of St. John nor his Apocalypse.”; they instead attributed the two New Testament books to the Gnostic Cerinthus, who was actually an enemy of John the Apostle.

Regarding their beliefs, Epiphanius asserts that the Alogians denied the continuation of spiritual gifts in the church in opposition to the Montanists. They explicitly deny the Logos doctrine in John chapter 1 and they deny Johannine authorship by comparing his Gospel with the synoptic Gospels. Their methodology can be seen in the surviving fragments of Hippolytus of Rome&#x27;s refutation, &quot;Capita Adversus Caium&quot;, preserved in Bar-Salibi&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on the Apocalypse&quot;. Their comparative method was considered very foolish in Epiphanius’ opinion who derided them as &quot;without reason&quot;. Syriacist John Gwynn, who published these fragments in English, likewise indicates that, &quot;The objections of Caius are . . . those of a somewhat captious critic, and indicates little breadth of scriptural learning or of eschatological conceptions&quot;.

Epiphanius argues that Cerinthus could not have written the Gospel of John because whereas Cerinthus denied the deity of Christ, the Gospel taught Christ&#x27;s Godhead. Epiphanius contemplates that they may not reject Christ&#x27;s deity outright, but instead just the “Logos form under which the doctrine was presented in the Gospel”. Epiphanius also asserts in regard to the Alogi, “they themselves seem to believe as we do.” He therefore is not so much concerned with their Christology as much as he is concerned with their biblical criticism. Nevertheless, Epiphanius is harsh in his condemnation of them and asserts that the bottom line for the Alogi is that they deny the Gospel of John and consequently the Word-Flesh Logos doctrine. Epiphanius clearly distinguishes them from the Ebionites and from the Docetists.

<doc id="1016757" wikidata="Q3963234" url="?curid=1016757" title="Social Distortion (album)">
<text>Social Distortion is the third studio album and major label debut by the American punk rock band of the same name, released on March 27, 1990, through Epic Records. The album furthered the country-infused experimentation of &quot;Prison Bound&quot; with songs like &quot;Drug Train&quot; and the radio hit &quot;Ball and Chain&quot;.

The focus on the alternative rock scene helped bring attention to &quot;Social Distortion&quot;. The singles &quot;Story of My Life&quot; and &quot;Ball and Chain&quot; were able to find an audience on alternative rock radio and on MTV. &quot;Social Distortion&quot; was one of the band&#x27;s most successful albums to date, and their first to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; the release peaked at number 128. The album has been certified gold by the RIAA in the United States. By 1996, &quot;Social Distortion&quot; had sold at least 250,000 copies, becoming the band&#x27;s second best-selling album in the United States (their next album &quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell&quot; sold 296,000 copies).

==Background and production==
After touring in support of its previous full-length studio album, &quot;Prison Bound&quot;, Social Distortion signed with Epic in 1989 and began work on its first album for a major label. The album&#x27;s recording sessions took place from August to October 1989 at Track Record in North Hollywood, California. It was produced by Dave Jerden, who also produced their 1992 follow-up &quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell&quot;.

==Artwork==

The album&#x27;s cover features three pieces of ripped paper, each with a different scene on them. The first piece features a 1930s style gangster with a tommy gun attempting to break a door with his right foot. The second piece features an empty liquor bottle held in a drunk woman&#x27;s hand. The final piece features a woman putting on thigh high stockings. The pictures are drawn all in blue on a gray background.

==Reception==
Reviews for &quot;Social Distortion&quot; have generally been favorable. AllMusic&#x27;s Mark Deming awards the album four-and-a-half stars out of five and claimed that Social Distortion &quot;began to metamorphasize from a rather ordinary L.A. hardcore band into a roots rock band willing to make with more than their share of the attitude, and this process continued on their self-titled third album.&quot; For the album&#x27;s musical direction, Deming states &quot;Mike Ness and Dennis Danell&#x27;s guitars sound lean, sharp, and powerful; Ness&#x27;s vocals are better controlled than ever before; and Christopher Reece&#x27;s drums have a tight snap that suits both the thrashier numbers as well as the slower, bluesier tunes.&quot; He also states that it &quot;Social Distortion&quot; is not a &quot;great roots rock album, but it&#x27;s a pretty good one, and it&#x27;s better and more affecting than anything this band had cranked out before.&quot;

&quot;Social Distortion&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album charts in September 1990, just six months after its release. It peaked at number 128 and remained on the chart for 22 weeks. Thanks to the success of the singles &quot;Let It Be Me&quot;, &quot;Ball and Chain&quot;, &quot;Story of My Life&quot; and &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, &quot;Social Distortion&quot; became the band&#x27;s best-selling album of their recording career, achieving gold sales certification in the United States.

<text>Thérésa Cabarrus, Madame Tallien (31 July 1773 – 15 January 1835) was a Spanish-born French noblewoman and socialite who became Princess of Chimay.

==Life==

===Early life===
She was born Juana María Ignacia Teresa de Cabarrús y Galabert in Carabanchel Alto, Madrid, Spain to François Cabarrus, an ethnic Basque French-born Spanish financier, and María Antonia Galabert, the daughter of a French industrialist based in Spain. Thérésa&#x27;s father founded and governed the bank of San Carlos, which became the Royal Bank of Spain, and was King Joseph I of Spain&#x27;s Minister of Finance. In 1789, he was ennobled by King Charles IV of Spain with the title of count.

From 1778 to 1783, Thérésa was raised by nuns in France. She was a student of the painter Jean-Baptiste Isabey. She returned home to the family castle briefly in 1785, and then her father sent her back to France at twelve years old to complete her education and get married.

The first of her many love affairs was with Alexandre de Laborde; however, the young couple was forced to separate as de Laborde&#x27;s powerful father, Jean-Joseph de Laborde, disapproved of her. Cabarrus then arranged for his &quot;very beautiful&quot; daughter to marry a rich, powerful Frenchman in order to strengthen his position in France. On 21 February 1788 Thérésa was married to Jean Jacques Devin Fontenay (1762–1817), the last Marquis de Fontenay, a wealthy aristocrat described as small, red and ugly. The bride was fourteen years old. Even though in the 1780s Thérésa had begun to take an interest in Liberalism and the principles of the Revolution, she was presented at the court of King Louis XVI. The newlyweds visited the royal court of Spain as well. On 2 May 1789 Thérésa had a son, Devin Théodore de Fontenay (1789–1815), whose father was perhaps Felix le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau, brother of Louis-Michel le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau.
When her husband fled at the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789, she resumed her maiden name and obtained a divorce in 1791. She took refuge in Bordeaux, where she was supported by her uncle and his family. While in Bordeaux she met Jean Lambert Tallien, Commissioner of the National Convention at the theatre. Some time later she began an affair with him. In December 1793 she appeared as the Goddess of Reason at a large parade organised in Bordeaux by Tallien and his fellow-Commissioner Ysabeau to celebrate the feast of Reason.

===Thermidor and Directory===
In February 1794, Tallien was denounced by Maximilien Robespierre for moderation and the easing of repression. Robespierre also reproached him for his liaison with &#x27;one Cabarrus, an ex-noble, who gets him to pardon many enemies of the Republic&#x27; She accompanied Tallien when he went to Paris to justify his conduct, only to be imprisoned on Robespierre&#x27;s orders first in La Force prison, then in Carmes prison where she met Joséphine de Beauharnais. Tallien was one of the chief organisers of the Thermidorian Reaction which overthrew Robespierre. On the same day, 27 July 1794 (9 Thermidor) Tallien had Theresa and Joséphine de Beauharnais freed from prison and became one of the leading figures in French political life. Thérésa was a moderating influence on her husband: after the outbreak of the Thermidorian Reaction, she earned the moniker &#x27;Our Lady of Thermidor&#x27; () as the person who was most likely to intervene in favor of the detained.

Pregnant with their daughter, she married Tallien on 26 December 1794. Their marriage was relatively short-lived however as Theresa began divorce proceedings against Tallien in February 1797. Tallien accompanied Napoleon to Egypt but was captured by the British on his voyage back to France and held prisoner. On his release in 1802, the divorce was finalised.

Thérésa became one of the leaders of Parisian social life. Her salon was famous and she was one of the originators of the &quot;Greek Revival&quot; Directoire style women&#x27;s fashions of the French Directory period. She was a very colorful figure; one story is that she was said to bathe in the juice of strawberries for their healing properties. She once arrived at the Tuileries Palace, then the chief residence of Napoleon Bonaparte, supported by a black page, with eight sapphire rings and six toe rings, a gold bracelet on each ankle and nine bracelets on each arm. To top the look off Theresa had a head band covered in rubies. On another occasion she appeared at the Paris Opera wearing a white silk dress without sleeves and not wearing any underwear. Talleyrand commented: &quot;Il n&#x27;est pas possible de s&#x27;exposer plus somptueusement!&quot; (&quot;One could not be more sumptuously unclothed!&quot;).

===Marriage to Riquet===

After her divorce from Tallien Theresa had a brief flirtation with Napoleon. She then moved first to the powerful Paul Barras, whose former mistress was Napoleon&#x27;s first wife Joséphine; then to the millionaire speculator Gabriel-Julien Ouvrard (with whom she had five children); and finally, attempting to regain respectability and to get away from Paris, she married François-Joseph-Philippe de Riquet, Comte de Caraman, on 22 August 1805 - he had become the sixteenth Prince of Chimay after the death of his childless uncle in 1804. She spent the rest of her life first in Paris, then on the Chimay estates (now in Belgium). After the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, these became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.
She had become one of the most famous women of her age, and she resented this role. Once when she appeared at the Louvre accompanied by her children, so many spectators flocked to see her up close, that she had to escape down a staircase to save herself. The marriage to Caraman meant that she returned to the class in which she had been born - and educated.

The couple invited musicians such as Daniel Auber, Rodolphe Kreutzer, Luigi Cherubini, Charles de Bériot and Maria Malibran to Paris and later to Chimay, where Thérésa held a little court. Cherubini composed his &quot;Messe en fa majeur dite Messe de Chimay&quot; at their castle there in 1809, derived from a Kyrie and Gloria he wrote in 1808 for the village church of Chimay.

Thérésa died in Chimay, where she was interred with François-Joseph de Riquet under the sacristy of the local church where a memorial stands to her memory. She bore eleven children during her various liaisons, including Joseph de Riquet, first son of François-Joseph-Philippe, who became the seventeenth Prince of Chimay in 1843.

<doc id="1016768" wikidata="Q3520271" url="?curid=1016768" title="The Christian Year">
<text>The Christian Year is a series of poems for all the Sundays and some other feasts of the liturgical year of the Church of England written by John Keble in 1827. The book is the source for several hymns.

It was first published in 1827, and quickly became extremely popular. Though at first anonymous, its authorship soon became known, with the result that Keble was in 1831 appointed Oxford Professor of Poetry, a post that he held until 1841. 

In his book &quot;Heaven, Hell, and the Victorians&quot;, Victorian scholar Michael Wheeler calls &quot;The Christian Year&quot; simply &quot;the most popular volume of verse in the nineteenth century&quot;. In his essay on &quot;Tractarian Aesthetics and the Romantic Tradition,&quot; Gregory Goodwin claims that &quot;The Christian Year&quot; is &quot;Keble&#x27;s greatest contribution to the Oxford Movement and to English literature.&quot; As evidence of that, Goodwin cites E. B. Pusey&#x27;s report that ninety-five editions of this devotional text were printed during Keble&#x27;s lifetime, and &quot;at the end of the year following his death, the number had arisen to a hundred-and-nine.&quot; By the time the copyright expired in 1873, over 375,000 copies had been sold in Britain and 158 editions had been published. Despite its widespread appeal among the Victorian readers, the popularity of Keble&#x27;s &quot;The Christian Year&quot; quickly faded in the twentieth century.

<text>Christopher Reece (sometimes known as Chris Reece) (born July 28, 1959) is an American musician. He was the drummer of The Lewd (1981–1983) and Social Distortion (1984–1993).

Reece was 22 years old in 1981 when he started playing drums for The Lewd. He left the band in 1983. The following year he was hired by Mike Ness to join Social Distortion, along with bassist John Maurer. Reece&#x27;s first recording with the band was the 1988 release &quot;Prison Bound&quot;. He also played drums on their next two albums, the eponymous &quot;Social Distortion&quot; (1990) and &quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell&quot; (1992). Reece left Social Distortion in 1993 and was replaced by Randy Carr.

In 1998 Reece started producing an antique shopping guide called Reece&#x27;s Antique and Retro Shopper&#x27;s Map. He learned about antiques from his parents who had bought and sold antiques in the 1950s and 1960s. Reece&#x27;s original map included (and still does) the antique and vintage stores along the Fourth Street area of Long Beach, which he named Retro Row. 
In 2002 Reece bought an abandoned 1950s diner in Long Beach, CA called Chipper&#x27;s Corner. He turned it into a seafood restaurant and bar now named The Pike Restaurant and Bar.

<text>Jean de Ligne, [[House of Arenberg|Duke of Arenberg]] (c. 1525 – 1568) was Baron of Barbançon, founder of the House of Arenberg and stadtholder of the Dutch provinces of Friesland, Groningen, Drenthe and Overijssel from 1549 until his death.

==Life==
Jean was the son of Louis de Ligne, Baron of Barbançon from the House of Ligne and Marie of Glymes, Lady of Zevenbergen (1503–1566), daughter of Cornelis of Glymes.

Jean belonged to a close circle around Charles V and was made a knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1546. In 1549 he became stadtholder of the northern provinces of Friesland, Groningen, Drenthe and Overijssel. By his marriage to Marguerite de la Marck-Arenberg, sister of Robert III von der Marck-Arenberg who died without children, he became the founder of the third House of Arenberg.

Jean participated in the campaign in France and distinguished himself in the Battle of St. Quentin (1557) where he, together with Henry V, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, led the left wing of the infantry in the final attack against the French.

At the start of the rebellion he distanced himself of his good friend William the Silent, Lamoral, Count of Egmont and Philip de Montmorency, Count of Hoorn, and remained loyal to the King Philip II of Spain.

He was unable to stop the spread of Protestantism in his northern provinces, but succeeded in 1567 to keep them loyal to the crown without bloodshed.

Back south, he joined the army under the Duke of Alva, but objected against the arrests of Egmont and Hoorn.&lt;br&gt;
When Louis and Adolf of Nassau (brothers of William I of Orange) invaded Groningen, he was sent back by Alva to repulse this army. 

Jean was killed in the Battle of Heiligerlee on 23 May 1568. Cardinal Granvelle described his death as a great loss for the Catholic faith and the king.

Arenberg was buried in the Saint Catherine Church in Zevenbergen, and his remains were moved in 1614 to the family vault in Enghien.

==Marriage and issue==
Jean and Marguerite de la Marck-Arenberg had:
* Charles de Ligne, 2nd Prince of Arenberg (1550–1616), his successor
* Margareth (1552–1611), married in 1569 with Philip of Lalaing
* Robert (1564–1614), first Prince of Barbançon
* Antonia Wilhelmina (1557–1626), married in 1577 with Salentin IX of Isenburg-Grenzau, Archbishop of Cologne, who left the clergy to marry her.

<text>Janet Inglis &quot;Janny&quot; Wurts (born December 10, 1953) is an American fantasy novelist and illustrator. She has written several standalone novels and series, including the &quot;Wars of Light and Shadow&quot;, &quot;The Cycle of Fire&quot; trilogy and the internationally best-selling &quot;Empire&quot; trilogy that she co-authored with Raymond E. Feist. Her short story collection &quot;That Way Lies Camelot&quot; was nominated for the British Fantasy Award in 1995. She often illustrates her own books, and has won Chesley Awards for her artwork.

==Biography==
Janny Wurts was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. In the 1980s, she worked as an illustrator for role-playing game supplements for Mayfair Games.

Wurts has written numerous novels (20 as of 2024). Her fantasy debut &quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Legacy&quot; (1982) has been described as a political thriller; it features a female protagonist and court intrigue. Similar elements feature in the &quot;Empire&quot; trilogy, written in collaboration with Raymond E. Feist. &quot;Empire&quot; is set in a non-European culture that has drawn comparisons to feudal Japan and the Byzantine empire. Wurts has also written 
science fantasy: her &quot;Cycle of Fire&quot; trilogy mixes magic with science fiction. &quot;The Wars of Light and Shadow&quot; is Wurts&#x27; 11-volume epic fantasy series with a storyline that spans multiple millennia and planets.

Beyond writing, Wurts&#x27; award-winning paintings have been showcased in exhibitions of imaginative artwork, among them a commemorative exhibition for NASA&#x27;s 25th Anniversary; the Art of the Cosmos at Hayden Planetarium in New York; and two exhibits of fantasy art, at both the Delaware Art Museum and Canton Art Museum.

Wurts was a guest of honor at the 1996 World Horror Convention and the 2004 World Fantasy Convention. She resides in Florida with her husband, artist Don Maitz.

<text>Örebro ( ; ) is the seventh-largest city in Sweden, the seat of Örebro Municipality, and capital of Örebro County. It is situated by the Närke Plain, near the lake Hjälmaren, a few kilometers inland along the small river Svartån, and has a population of approximately 126,000 in the city proper. It is one of the largest inland hubs of the country, and a major logistic and commercial operating site.

Örebro is home to Örebro University, a major university hospital, a medieval castle, the water park Gustavsvik as well as several large shopping malls and the Oset and Rynningeviken Nature Reserve adjacent to lake Hjälmaren.

Örebro is a trade and logistics city with a strategic location 200 km from Stockholm, 330 km from Oslo and 280 km from Gothenburg. The city is served by Örebro Airport 10 km (6 mi) southwest of the city, and by Örebro Central Station, serviced by the Mälaren Line and Western Main Line.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Örebro&quot; refers to a bridge (&#x27;) crossing the river Svartån where the city is located. The prefix &#x27; is derived from &quot;&quot; &#x27;gravel (bank)&#x27;. 

==History==

Örebro received its Royal Charter and city privileges not later than 1404.

The location became a natural seat of commerce in the Scandinavian Middle Ages and is mentioned in print in the 13th century. Old buildings from the early days include the foundations of the city church, a building which has undergone several modifications. The natural center of the city is otherwise Örebro Castle, situated on an islet in the Svartån, and dividing the town into a northern and a southern part. This castle was constructed during the stewardship of Birger Jarl during the late 13th century and then modified and enlarged during the reign of King Gustav Vasa in the 1560s. The Örebro Synod was held here in 1529.

Notable events in Örebro&#x27;s history include the national diet meeting at Örebro in 1810, where Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte was elected crown prince of Sweden.

Although a trade town, Örebro remained small until the second half of the 19th century, when it grew rapidly as a center of the national shoe-manufacturing industry.

=== 2025 Risbergska school shooting ===

On 4 February 2025, a school shooting occurred at Campus Risbergska, an adult education centre in Örebro.

==Climate==

Örebro, like the rest of the area close to Mälardalen, has a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb) that is made milder by the proximity to water and the Gulf Stream which makes it interchangeable with oceanic climates. Summer temperatures occasionally exceed albeit not yearly, and temperatures above are rare in winter, although frost-free nights sometimes occur. July average high temperatures generally range from to depending on weather patterns, with a 2002–2021 mean high of around . July lows averaged , sizeably cooler than seaside areas. January averaged average highs in the same timeframe, with average lows of .

During cold winters, Örebro receives plenty of snowfall. Örebro is far more prone than coastal areas to really harsh frosts with temperatures approaching or below happening almost every winter according to SMHI statistics. The station&#x27;s setting in a rural location might skew temperatures somewhat compared to the urban area which is also at a slightly lower elevation and nearer Hjälmaren. Especially when considering overnight lows this could result in a small urban heat island effect in downtown.

However, the climate is very variable from year to year. For example, December 2010 was record cold with a daily mean of , whilst December 2006 only a few years before had a mean of . The warmest month on record is in July 2018 and the coldest on record is in January 1987. Örebro is often without snow cover for large parts of the winter months when daytime temperatures hover just above freezing – an exceptional feature for an inland area north of the 59th latitude. The westerly Atlantic moderating influence is strong enough that far inland Örebro has milder winters than the near-coastal town Norrtälje, located slightly farther north on the Baltic Sea with a similar rural weather station.

The highest ever recorded temperature was set on 7 August 1975 during an intense heatwave with , which is a very high temperature for such northerly latitudes. During the 21st century, the record heat is the all-time July record of set in 2022. The lowest recorded temperature in recorded history was set in February 1966 with . Several monthly records were set after 2010 according to official SMHI statistics, namely the record highs of February, March, May, July, October, November and December as well as the coldest December temperature and month on record, that was set in 2010. Humidity is high for most parts of the year, but adequately lower during summer months. In spite of this summer is generally the time that gets the most precipitation due to clashes between hot and cool continental air systems causing heavy thunderstorm rainfall. In 2015, a reading was recorded around the winter solstice which was a very warm reading for an inland area in the low-sun season.

Being unshielded by the South Swedish highlands rain shadow, moist westerly air results in higher precipitation than on Baltic Sea locations. Summer convection and the flat topography of downtown can result in flash floods of low areas. Resulting from that, Örebro has been deemed one of the most vulnerable areas in Sweden to flooding and saw several incidents in a record wet summer in 2023.

<text>Kumla is a locality and the seat of Kumla Municipality, Örebro County, Sweden with a population of 21,640 as of 2018.

==Geography==
Kumla is situated roughly 15 kilometres south of neighbouring city Örebro, and is connected to its much larger neighbour with train and bus commuting. Kumla is unusual in terms of municipality seats in Svealand in that there is no connection to any kind of waterway in the centre of the town. However, three of the four biggest lakes in the country are within an hour&#x27;s drive from the town. It is also an unusually flat town, since it is situated in the middle of the so-called Närke Plain. There is also a very agrarian landscape surrounding Kumla.

==Transport==
Kumla is linked with several roads, including the highway E20 that is passing just west of the locality. The E20 is the fastest route to both Gothenburg and Stockholm, which Kumla is situated relatively close to the middle between the two largest Swedish cities. E20 passes Örebro as well, but there are several routes which go to the larger neighbour city from Kumla. The roads 51 (from Norrköping) and 52 (from Nyköping) also pass through Kumla.

Kumla also has a train station on the Stockholm-Gothenburg route driven by SJ.

==History==
Traditionally Kumla was known as a shoemaker town with a history back to the first half of the 19th century. This history is memorialized in Kumla&#x27;s Shoe Industry Museum, with a small-scale production of shoes.

Kumla got the title of a city in 1942, but is since 1971 the seat of the larger Kumla Municipality.

==Today==
Today the industry is dominated by the manufacturing of jam at and communication systems at an Ericsson industry.

The name Kumla is renowned for its prison (&quot;the Kumla Institution&quot;, or &quot;Kumlaanstalten&quot;, commonly known as &#x27;The Bunker&#x27;), which is the largest prison in the country. Opened in 1965, it can currently allow 333 male inmates, with a similarly large staff, and is designated for &quot;difficult&quot; inmates and for those at the start of a life-term sentence. It is one of three Swedish prisons housing the most notorious and dangerous inmates.

==Notable people==

*Pierre Bengtsson (1988–), association football player
*Fredrik Ekblom (1970–), racing driver

<text>The Ecuador national football team (), nicknamed La Tricolor, represents Ecuador in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Ecuadorian Football Federation (FEF). They joined FIFA in 1926 and CONMEBOL a year later.

Discarding an invitation to participate in the inaugural FIFA World Cup held in Uruguay, Ecuador did not make their tournament debut until 2002. After finishing above Brazil and Uruguay in the standings, the qualifying campaign marked the emergence of several players, such as Agustín Delgado, Álex Aguinaga, Iván Hurtado, Ulises de la Cruz and Iván Kaviedes, who would set the stage for Ecuador&#x27;s achievements in the next decade. Having reached the Round of 16 in a memorable 2006 World Cup campaign, they were expected to deliver at the 2007 Copa América but were eliminated in the group stage. Along with Venezuela, they have not won the continental tournament. &quot;La Tri&quot;″s best performance was fourth in 1959 and 1993, both times on home soil.

Ecuador plays the majority of their home matches at the Estadio Olímpico Atahualpa in Quito.

==History==
Historically, Ecuador has been seen as a struggling footballing nation in South America. Despite their past failures, however, Ecuador has risen to be a serious South American competitor in recent years.

Football was introduced to Ecuador by Juan Alfredo Wright, who had recently returned from university in England. On 23 April 1899, he and his brother Roberto founded the first Ecuadorian football team, Guayaquil Sport Club. As the popularity of the sport grew in the country, more teams were established. On 30 May 1925, the Federación Deportiva Nacional del Ecuador was founded. In 1930, FIFA sent an invitation encouraging for a men&#x27;s national team to participate at the maiden World Cup. However, the then-Minister of Social Security and Sports declined the offer as they did not approve of the financial allocation.

In 1938, the I Bolivarian Games were organized, with Ecuador set to take part in the football tournament. On 8 August 1938, they played their first-ever match; a 1–1 draw with Bolivia. Their following game saw the national team earn a 2–1 win against Colombia. Following a 9–1 crushing by Peru and a 5–2 victory over Venezuela, Ecuador was tied for the silver medal with Bolivia. A playoff saw the Bolivians emerge triumphantly and the Ecuadorians finished the competition with the bronze medal.

After finishing fourth at the 1959 South American Championship, the team entered the World Cup qualifiers for the first time. They failed to qualify for 1962 after inflicted defeats by Argentina.

The 1998 World Cup qualifiers saw the format for qualifying in CONMEBOL changed to a league home-and-away system. This difference made a huge impact on Ecuador&#x27;s performance as they clinched several important home wins during the campaign. In the end, they achieved a 6th-place finish, just under Peru and Chile.

Following the appointment of Hernán Darío Gómez for their 2002 World Cup qualifying campaign, Ecuador recorded a historic 1–0 win against Brazil. A 5–1 win over Bolivia saw &quot;la Tricolor&quot; only needing a point to qualify for the World Cup. They faced Uruguay, and, after managing to cling onto a 1–1 draw, obtained their spot in the World Cup in East Asia.

Ecuador started the 2002 World Cup with a 2–0 loss to Italy. Agustín Delgado scored his country&#x27;s first World Cup goal; he opened the scoring in a 2–1 loss to Mexico. Despite defeating Croatia, who had achieved third place in the previous tournament, and eliminating the Croats in process, Ecuador placed fourth in Group G and 24th overall.

A disappointing showing at the 2004 Copa América led to the resignation of Gómez, who was replaced by Luis Fernando Suárez. He led them successfully through the latter stages of the qualification process for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, finishing third to make the finals. In Germany, they were drawn into Group A with the hosts, Poland, and Costa Rica. Wins over Poland and Costa Rica earned Ecuador qualification to the knockout stages for the first time.

After a dull 2014 FIFA World Cup, and an unpleasant streak of failing to advance past the group stages of the Copa América, Gustavo Quinteros was hired to help rebuild the national team. Quinteros helped Ecuador reach the quarter-finals of the Copa América Centenario and started the 2018 World Cup qualifiers strong. They were setback after a loss to Uruguay and finished eighth in the standings.

Gómez was reinstalled to lead Ecuador at the 2019 Copa América. His second stint was short, as he was soon fired after a disastrous tournament, having only earned a point.

For the qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, as punishment for fielding a player who had a passport with falsified information for Byron Castillo in the previous World Cup qualification cycle. Ecuador were deducted three points and fined CHF 100,000.

==Home stadium==

The Ecuador national team plays their home games at the Estadio Olímpico Atahualpa in Quito. Having opened in 1951, it initially had a capacity of 45,000, but was later reduced to 35,724.

The stadium has a running track, which has gone to be one of the most important in South America for events organized by the former International Association of Athletics Federations.

15 gates surround the stadium, allowing for an evacuation to be completed in about 10 minutes. The venue also features an electronic scoreboard located in the northern sector. The screen, manufactured by Hungarian-based company Elektroimpex in 1985, measures 10 meters tall and 30 meters wide.

In this stadium, Ecuador defeated Uruguay at the 1993 Copa América and Brazil at the 2002 World Cup qualifiers. After tying with the former on 7 November 2001, Ecuador qualified for their first World Cup. Since then, Ecuador has qualified three times.

The stadium is set to be demolished in late-2020 for a newer stadium, which in first instance was for preparation for the 2024 Copa América. However, Ecuador declined to host Copa America in 2022.

For the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Ecuador played at the &quot;Casa Blanca.&quot;

==Team image==

The standard Ecuador uniform maintains the colours of the national flag, typically a yellow top, blue shorts, and red socks. The alternate colours of the uniform are white and blue, this being based on the flag of the Guayas Province. From 1965 to 2020, the crest featured the Andean condor, Ecuador&#x27;s national bird, above a shield with the country&#x27;s colors. In January 2020, the Ecuadorian Football Federation announced a rebrand of the logo; a navy blue shield with an &quot;FEF&quot; monogram attempting to &quot;abstractly build a condor&quot;.

<text>Hrotsvitha (–973) was a secular canoness who wrote drama and Christian poetry under the Ottonian dynasty. She was born in Bad Gandersheim to Saxon nobles and entered Gandersheim Abbey as a canoness. She is considered the first female writer from the Germanosphere, the first female historian, the first person since the Fall of the Roman Empire to write dramas in the Latin West, and the first German female poet.

Hrotsvitha&#x27;s six short dramas are considered to be her most important works. She is one of the few women who wrote about her life during the early Middle Ages, making her one of the only people to record a history of women in that era from a woman&#x27;s perspective. She has been called &quot;the most remarkable woman of her time&quot;, and an important figure in the history of women.

Little is known about Hrotsvitha&#x27;s personal life. All of her writing is in Medieval Latin. Her works were rediscovered in 1501 by the humanist Conrad Celtes and translated into English in the 1600s.

Hrotsvitha&#x27;s name (Latin: &quot;Hrotsvitha Gandeshemensis&quot;) appears in various forms including: Hrotsvit, Hrosvite, Hroswitha, Hroswithe, Rhotswitha, Roswit, Roswindis and Roswitha. It means &quot;a mighty shout&quot;, and speaks to the way she wanted to glorify Christian heroes and legends, as well as the values they represent. Some have commented on how this either represents or conflicts with the personality presented in her writing.

While many have questioned the authenticity of Hrotsvitha&#x27;s work, examinations and collections of her works, coupled with multiple historical and contemporary works that speak of her, demonstrate that Hrotsvitha&#x27;s work is authentic. Feminist scholars have argued that this questioning of the authenticity of Hrotsvitha&#x27;s work reflects a sexist narrative rather than revealing a flaw in her work or that she did not exist, as individuals have been engaging with her work for hundreds of years, and with increased intensity since her rediscovery during the German Renaissance.

==Life and background==

All the information about Hrotsvitha comes from the prefaces of her work, and later interpretations of her writings. It is generally accepted that Hrotsvitha was born in approximately 935 and died in 973. Little is known of her lineage, or why she took the veil.

Gandersheim Abbey was a house of secular canonesses. There is some debate over when she entered. Hrotsvitha took vows of chastity and obedience but not poverty. She could live a relatively comfortable life and leave the monastery at any time, all while being protected, studying from a large library, and learning from many teachers. This speaks to her economic position as being from a noble family. Hrotsvitha began her studies under the nun Rikkardis, who was younger than she. She also studied under the Abbess Gerberga, granddaughter of King Henry the Fowler. Abbess Gerberga became a friend and adviser of Hrotsvit. She was a good student who read many works popular at the time with a particular focus on legends about saints and would have spent much of her time learning how to write verse. Hrotsvitha herself became a teacher in her 20s.

As her writings demonstrate a rather mature perspective, they may have been written when she was older. She had a good grasp of the legal system, the history of the Ottonian dynasty and their line of succession. Hrotsvitha was the first Northern European to write about Islam and the Islamic empire. She was both educated and well informed. Her use of myths indicates a specific perspective as she writes about the importance of Christianity—with a focus on virginity, martyrdom, and the strength of Christian values—in the face of the threat Islam posed.

At first, Hrotsvitha wrote in secret until she was encouraged to read her works out loud and edit them. The Abbess encouraged her to continue writing. Hrotsvitha primarily wrote legends, comedies, and plays. Her Books of Legends or &quot;Carmina liber primus&quot; was written in the 950s or 960s and was written in honor of Abbess Gerberga. It contains eight legends written in dactylic hexameter. Her most popular work was &quot;The Book of Drama&quot;, or &quot;Liber Secundus&quot;, which offered a Christian alternative to the work of the Roman playwright Terence. In contrast to Terence, who told stories about women who were weak and morally corrupt, Hrothsvitha stories were about virtuous virgins with a strong connection to God and who persevered through adversity. Hrotsvitha&#x27;s third book contains the &quot;Gesta Ottonis&quot;, which details the history of the Ottonians from 919 to 965; and the &quot;Primordia coenobii Gandeshemensis&quot;, the history of Gandersheim Abbey.

==Works==
Hrothsvitha&#x27;s works fall under the categories of legends, comedies, and plays. Cardinal Gasquet said her works have &quot;a claim to an eminent place in medieval literature, and do honor to her sex, to the age in which she lived, and to the vocation which she followed.&quot; The works are organized chronologically and speak to how Hrotsvitha valued the Christian approach to life.

Despite Hrothsvitha&#x27;s importance as the first known female playwright, her work was not seen as important and translated into English until the 1600s. She is often omitted in texts about the history of plays and literature.

The most important manuscript of her works, containing all the texts other than &quot;Primordia&quot;, is the Codex Bayerische Staatsbibliothek (Bavarian State Library) Clm 14485, a manuscript written by several different hands in Gandersheim toward the end of the 10th or start of the 11th centuries. It was discovered by the humanist Conrad Celtis in 1493/94 in the Cloister of St. Emmeram in Regensburg and formed the first edition (illustrated by Albrecht Dürer).

===&quot;Liber Primus&quot;===
The &quot;Book of Legends&quot; is a collection of eight legends: &quot;Maria&quot;, &quot;Ascensio&quot;, &quot;Gongolfus&quot;, &quot;Pelagius&quot;, &quot;Theophilus&quot;, &quot;Basilius&quot;, &quot;Dionysius&quot;, and &quot;Agnes&quot;. All are written in Leonine hexameter except &quot;Gongolph&quot;, which is written in rhymed distichs. &quot;Theophilus&quot; and &quot;Basilius&quot;, are based on Latin translations of the &quot;vitae&quot; of Greek saints, and are versions of the Faustian tradition, in which a sinner sells his soul to the Devil. Hrotsvitha supplements the story with her description of Theophilus in &quot;The Seven Arts&quot;: &quot;De sophiae rivis septeno fonte manantis.&quot;

A common theme throughout is the constant battle between good and evil. The Devil is a frequent presence in many of Hrosvitha&#x27;s works, and she characterizes him according to the conventions of her time. In &quot;Dionysius&quot; and &quot;St. Agnes&quot; she recounts the martyrdoms of early Christians. The Liber Primus reflects Hrotsvitha&#x27;s interest in combining classical forms with Christian themes, and her desire to create literature that promotes Christian morality and virtue.

===&quot;Liber Secundus&quot;===
The &quot;Book of Drama&quot; presents a Roman Catholic alternative to Terence. These are the six plays: &quot;Gallicanus&quot;, &quot;Dulcitius&quot;, &quot;Calimachus&quot;, &quot;Abraham&quot;, &quot;Pafnutius&quot;, and &quot;Sapientia&quot;. They are essentially love stories, written in prose, and are not so much dramas as &quot;dialogues.&quot; Though initially considered medieval examples of closet drama, recent scholarship has shown that Hrotsvitha was associated with the theatrical exploits of the Ottonian court and, furthermore, within the context of the Gandersheim cloister, it is possible that her plays may have been staged or, at least, read aloud.

As the earliest known woman writer in the German lands, Hrotsvitha was keenly aware that her gender made her writings less likely to be taken seriously than that of her male contemporaries. In the prologue to &quot;The Book of Legends,&quot; Hrotsvitha says: &quot;Scorn he should not render at the writer&#x27;s weaker gender/ Who these small lines had sung with a woman&#x27;s untutored tongue/ But rather should he praise the Lord&#x27;s celestial grace.&quot;

In general, Hrosvitha&#x27;s plays were works of hagiography. All six speak to a consistent theme in Hrothsvitha&#x27;s work, the virtue of virginity over temptation.

Her plays contrast the chastity and perseverance of Christian women with Roman women, who were portrayed as weak and emotional. Hrotsvitha wrote her plays in response to those of Terence, a popular Roman playwright who she thought unfairly represented women as immoral. She writes, &quot;Wherefore I, the strong voice of Gandersheim, have not hesitated to imitate a poet (Terence) whose works are so widely read, my object being to glorify, within the limits of my poor talent, the laudable chastity of Christian virgins in that self-same form of composition which has been used to describe the shameless acts of licentious women.&quot;

All these dramas serve a discreet purpose. &quot;Gallicanus&quot; and &quot;Calimachus&quot; focus on conversion, &quot;Abraham&quot; and &quot;Pafnutius&quot; tell stories of redemption and repentance, and &quot;Dulcitius&quot; and &quot;Sapientia&quot; tell stories of virgin martyrdom. Cumulatively they speak to the power of Christ and Christian values, which was Hrothsvitha&#x27;s objective. They are known to have been performed many times since her death, the earliest confirmation of which was in Paris in 1888.

She writes in her preface that her writing will appeal to many who are attracted by the charm of style. There are comedic elements, as in &quot;Dulcitius&quot;, when the wicked blind governor stumbles among pots and pans, having attempted to molest three virgins. The women watch and laugh. Although they go on to become martyrs for their faith, they do so on their own terms. &quot;Dulcitius&quot; is the only one of Hrotsvitha&#x27;s comedies which aligns with the modern comedic genre.

===&quot;Liber Tertius&quot;===
The third book is dedicated to Emperors Otto I and Otto II, and consists of two historical writings in Latin hexameters. &quot;Gesta Oddonis&quot; tells the story of the Ottonian dynasty, and its rise to power; and &quot;Primordia Coenobii Gandeshemensis&quot; tells the history of Gandersheim Abbey.

==Legacy==

=== Feminism ===
Hrothsvitha&#x27;s work was largely ignored until Conrad Celtis rediscovered and edited her work in the 1500s. In the 1970s, feminists began their own rediscovery of her work under a gendered lens to re-contextualize it to demonstrate that women of the past did have important roles in their societies, but their work was lost or not seen as important. Feminists have done this re-contextualization to learn about women&#x27;s history, while not claiming that these women were feminists, to emphasize the importance of women throughout history even if they are forgotten. Because of this, Hrotsvitha has continued to garner much attention in the field of feminism studies, helping to provide a better sense of historical acknowledgement, accomplishment, and significance to women through the Canoness&#x27; work.

====Representation of women====
Hrotsvitha&#x27;s writing mimics Biblical texts. According to A. Daniel Frankforter, Hrotsvitha seems to confirm the assumption that woman&#x27;s work was inferior, by saying that any excellence in her work is the excellence of God, not her own, although this may also merely be a standard literary convention of the time.

Hrotsvitha depicted women as having the power of self-determination and agency through taking the veil and abstaining from sexual relationships. This presents a very progressive view of women and their power in older societies, highlighted by various researchers that studied how Hrotsvitha&#x27;s work often reflected the lives of women of her time. While she writes of women as virtuous, courageous, witty, and close to God she only speaks about one man without contempt, finding that they are disproportionately susceptible to temptation. Hrotsvitha sees women being the weaker sex as allowing God to more easily work through them to find grace for their salvation and the salvation of those with whom they come in contact. This, therefore, suggests that women are not less than men in the eyes of God. Hrotsvitha believes that a virginal life dedicated to Jesus is best, but she can be empathetic towards mothers, and even prostitutes, thus demonstrating a keen understanding of women&#x27;s lives and options at the time.

Hrotsvitha plays focus on the issues that affect women of her time such as marriage, rape, and being seen as an object. &quot;Dulcitius&quot;, deals with rape, a common issue and form of oppression that women experience. It is even argued that Hrotsvitha&#x27;s work of &quot;Dulcitius&quot; acted as a reflection to lives of women in her hometown of Gandersheim, living in a hostile environment targeted by an extrinsic threat that is male in nature, showing the possible focus she gives towards women and feminism as a whole. In &quot;Callimach&quot;, a woman, who has been the subject of an attempted rape, prays for death. God grants her prayer and she dies before the man can resume his attack. Taken by her beauty the man goes to her grave and attempts intercourse with her corpse, but is killed by a venomous serpent. Both of these plays show a key to Hrothsvitha&#x27;s work: that religion can provide women with freedom and independence, allowing them to empower themselves.

====Impact on Theatre====
Hrothsvitha contributes to the work of women in theatre by supporting the concept that &quot;as long as there is theatre, as long as there are women, as long as there is an imperfect society, there will be women&#x27;s theatre&quot;. Hrothsvitha&#x27;s plays served the purpose of speaking truth to power and counterbalancing male dominance of the field.

The significance of her plays is often overlooked because their dramaturgy diverges from what Sue-Ellen Case and Jill Dolan theorize as to the male values of good playwriting, which excluded Hrotsvitha, rather placing focus upon alternative fields, such as religion, early life, and sexuality, to name a few.

==Translations==

Hrotsvitha&#x27;s work was largely ignored until re-discovered and edited by Conrad Celtis in the early 16th century. Since then many authors have taken up the work of translating and editing them. Often these works are filtered through the perceptions and unconscious bias of the translator., It is believed that the naming of Hrotsvitha plays after men and not women may have been done by Celtis and not Hrotsvitha as her works largely center women and their experiences, making these titles appear inconsistent with what is presented in her work. It has been suggested that Celtis may have misrepresented her work due to his own implicit biases. While the translator Christabel Marshall appears to impose her own understandings of what a 10th-century canoness would be like or would have thought by making her seem timid in her translations. Katharina Wilson does a similar thing in Hrothvitha&#x27;s work by translating her to seem more humble than she actually is. This has led some to posit that Colleen Butler is the person who best represented Hrotsvitha&#x27;s work, as she discerned the true comedic nature of her work, by being able to deduce the unwritten context in the writing. However, while there may be some small misrepresentations of Hrothvitha&#x27;s work, her message, and the known facts about her life remain relatively consistent.

<doc id="1016802" wikidata="Q3964612" url="?curid=1016802" title="Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell">
<text>Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell is the fourth studio album by the American punk rock band Social Distortion, released on February 11, 1992. Following up on the surprise success of their breakthrough singles &quot;Ball and Chain&quot; and &quot;Story of My Life&quot;, &quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell&quot; became a popular album and received positive reviews from music critics. It also spawned their highest-charting single &quot;Bad Luck&quot;, which peaked at number 2 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.

&quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell&quot; was one of the best-selling albums of Social Distortion&#x27;s recording career, achieving gold sales certification in the United States by 2000, and by 1996, the album had sold 296,000 copies. It peaked at number 76 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and topped the Heatseekers chart, and was also Social Distortion&#x27;s last to feature drummer Christopher Reece, who left the band in 1994.

The cover art features frontman Mike Ness mid-jump, while playing one of his Gibson Les Pauls. The cover is reminiscent and possibly an homage to Joan Jett jumping with her Gibson MelodyMaker over a canary yellow background on her third album, &quot;Album&quot;.

==Music style==
&quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell&quot; continues the melding of country and rockabilly influences with punk rock that began with Social Distortion&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;Prison Bound&quot;. Clear influences include Hank Williams (on &quot;This Time Darlin&#x27;&quot;) and Johnny Cash (on &quot;99 to Life&quot;). Critic Robert Christgau referred to the album as a &quot;new meaning of hard-honky-tonk,&quot; referring to the band&#x27;s mixing of honky-tonk style of country music and hardcore punk.

==Reception==
Reviews for &quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell&quot; have generally been favorable. AllMusic&#x27;s Paul Tinelli awards the album four-and-a-half stars out of five and praised the music as a &quot;share of rollicking, straight-ahead hard rock.&quot; He also claims that &quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell&quot; &quot;had all the earmarks of a major commercial success with some radio friendly tunes and strong production, but it never found the large audience Epic Records expected.&quot;

==Covers==
In 2008, Danish rock band Volbeat released a cover of “Making Believe” on their third album, Guitar Gangsters &amp; Cadillac Blood. In 2018, the German punk rock band Die Toten Hosen covered the song &quot;Cold Feelings&quot; on their &quot;Laune der Natur&quot; single.

<text>Ross Alexander (born Alexander Ross Smith, Jr.; July 27, 1907 – January 2, 1937) was an American stage and film actor.

== Early years ==
Alexander was born Alexander Ross Smith. Jr. in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Maud Adelle (nee Cohen) and Alexander Ross Smith. 

Alexander attended Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn until he and his family moved to upstate Rochester, New York. He attended high school there, but dropped out before graduating. Alexander claimed in interviews that the high-school principal recommended to his parents that the student should follow the acting profession. 

When he was 17, he went to New York City and studied acting at the Packard Theatrical Agency.

== Stage ==
Alexander began his acting career with the Henry Jewett Players in Boston, debuting in &quot;Enter Madame&quot;. By 1926, he was regarded as a promising leading man with good looks and an easy, charming style, and began appearing in more substantial roles. 

His Broadway credits include &quot;Enter Madame&quot; (1920), &quot;The Ladder&quot; (1926), &quot;Let Us Be Gay&quot; (1928), &quot;That&#x27;s Gratitude&quot; (1930), &quot;After Tomorrow&quot; (1931), &quot;The Stork Is Dead&quot; (1932), &quot;Honeymoon&quot; (1932), and &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot; (1932). Alexander looked back at &quot;The Ladder&quot; with bemusement because its oilman backer, who had declared that the play would have a record-breaking run, kept his word by keeping the show open -- despite audiences of perhaps a dozen people at each performance. Ross Alexander stayed with the ailing show for almost two years.

== Film ==

Alexander was signed to a film contract by Paramount Pictures, and made his film debut in &quot;The Wiser Sex&quot; (1932). Paramount dropped his option and he returned to Broadway. In 1934, casting director Max Arnow signed him with Warner Bros. His bigger successes from this period were &quot;Flirtation Walk&quot; (1934), &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and &quot;Captain Blood&quot; (both 1935).

In 1936, he starred in &quot;Hot Money&quot;. It was a defining role in his persona as a glamorous, well-dressed and dapper leading man, not in the usual Warner gangster mold of rough-hewn stars such as Edward G. Robinson or Paul Muni. 

His final film &quot;Ready, Willing and Able&quot;, a Ruby Keeler musical, was released posthumously. Supposedly Ronald Reagan was signed by the studio as a replacement for Alexander due to remarked similarities in their radio voices and mannerisms.

== Personal life ==
Alexander married actress Aleta Freel on February 28, 1934, in East Orange, New Jersey. Freel committed suicide on December 7, 1935, shooting herself in the head with a .22 rifle. On September 17, 1936, Alexander married actress Anne Nagel, with whom he had appeared in the films &quot;China Clipper&quot; and &quot;Here Comes Carter&quot; (both 1936).

==Death==
Alexander always had problems with money. According to a studio biography, &quot;He ruefully says that he doesn&#x27;t know how to save money, and guesses that he&#x27;ll have to get a business manager. And the only thing he collects is -- not first editions or etchings -- but debts!&quot; By the end of 1936, despite his movie employment, he was deeply in debt. On January 2, 1937, three months after marrying Nagel, with his professional and personal life in disarray, Alexander shot himself in the head with a .22 pistol in the barn behind his home. He is buried in lot 292 of the Sunrise Slope section of Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, California.

<text>Erastus &quot;Deaf&quot; Smith (April 19, 1787 – November 30, 1837), who earned his nickname due to hearing loss in childhood, was an American frontiersman noted for his part in the Texas Revolution and the Army of the Republic of Texas. He fought in the Grass Fight and the Battle of San Jacinto. After the war, Deaf Smith led a company of Texas Rangers. 

Smith died in Richmond, Texas, aged 50, at the home of Randall Jones. The Episcopal churchyard has a modest marker, &quot;Deaf Smith, the Texas Spy, Died Nov. 30, 1837&quot;, but his exact burial site is unknown.

==Posthumous legacy==

Deaf Smith County, Texas, is named in his honor. Unlike his nickname, which was pronounced &quot;Deef&quot;, the county name is pronounced by most residents as . Likewise, a brand of peanut butter known as Deaf Smith was manufactured by the Arrowhead Mills company, which was founded in 1960 by Frank Ford, then from Hereford, the seat of Deaf Smith County.

Many school districts in Texas name schools after heroes of the Texas Revolution. Several schools across the state are named for Deaf Smith, including Lamar CISD&#x27;s Deaf Smith Elementary in Richmond, Texas.

<doc id="1016819" wikidata="Q844331" url="?curid=1016819" title="British Rail Class 158">
<text>The British Rail Class 158 &quot;[[Sprinter (British Rail)|Express Sprinter]]&quot; is a diesel multiple unit (DMU) passenger train. It is a member of the Sprinter series of regional trains, produced as a replacement for British Rail&#x27;s first generation of DMUs; of the other members, the Class 159 is almost identical to the Class 158, having been converted from Class 158 to Class 159 in two batches to operate express services from London Waterloo to the West of England.

The Class 158 was constructed between 1989 and 1992 by British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) at its Derby Litchurch Lane Works. The majority were built as two-car sets; some three-car sets were also produced. During September 1990, the first Express Sprinters were operated by ScotRail; the type was promptly introduced to secondary routes across the Midlands, Northern England, Wales and the South West. The Class 158 enabled the replacement of large numbers of elderly DMUs but also several locomotive-hauled trains as well; this was partially accomplished via the cascading of existing Sprinter units onto other routes. To capitalise on the Class 158&#x27;s improved onboard amenities in comparison to other rolling stock in use for regional services, the Alphaline branding was launched during the mid-1990s; it was also used for a time in the post-privatisation era.

As a result of British Rail&#x27;s privatisation in the mid-1990s, the Class 158s were divided amongst various newly created operators broadly along their existing routes. Due to their relatively young age at that time, most operators elected to retain them for the following decades. Several, such as Northern Rail and Arriva Trains Wales, had their Class 158 fleets modernised and refitted with various new facilities, such modifications often including greater accessibility, onboard passenger information systems, Wi-Fi connectivity, and toilet retention tanks. By the 2020s, many Class 158 operators had started to or had replaced the type with newer rolling stock, such as the Class 170 &quot;Turbostar&quot;, Class 185 &quot;Desiro&quot;, and Class 197 &quot;Civity&quot; multiple units.

==Background==
By the beginning of the 1980s, British Rail (BR) operated a large fleet of first generation DMUs, which had been constructed in prior decades to various designs. While formulating its long-term strategy for this sector of its operations, British Rail planners recognised that there would be considerable costs incurred by undertaking refurbishment programmes necessary for the continued use of these ageing multiple units, particularly due to the necessity of handling and removing hazardous materials such as asbestos. In light of the high costs involved in retention, planners examined the prospects for the development and introduction of a new generation of DMUs to succeed the first generation.

In the concept stage, two separate approaches were devised, one involving a so-called &quot;railbus&quot; that prioritised the minimisation of both initial (procurement) and ongoing (maintenance and operational) costs, while the second was a more substantial DMU that could deliver superior performance than the existing fleet, particularly when it came to long-distance services. The initial specification developed for the latter concept was relatively ambitious, calling for a maximum speed of , acceleration comparable to contemporary EMUs, the ability to couple/work in multiple with existing EMUs, facilitate through-access for passengers, feature pressure ventilation, the ability to assist a failed unit, and to comprise either a three- or four-car consist. This specification led to the experimental British Rail Class 210 diesel-electric multiple unit. However, it was found that relatively expensive equipment was needed for the performance specified, particularly to provide sufficient speed, acceleration, and through-passenger access; maintainability also suffered due to space limitations. It was recognised that a production model assembled from proven components would possess greater reliability and lower maintenance costs; an availability rate of 85 per cent was forecast.

By 1983, experiences with the Class 210 had influenced BR planners to favour procuring a new generation of DMUs, but to also adopt a new specification that were somewhat less demanding than before. Specifically, it was decided to drop the top speed from , as testing had revealed the higher rate to deliver no perceivable improvement in journey times due to the typically short spacing of the stations the type was intended to serve. Furthermore, it was determined that a propulsion system delivering 7hp per tonne would deliver sufficient acceleration. The requests for compatibility with other rolling stock were eliminated, although auto-coupling and auto-connecting functionality was added. In addition to a good ride quality, the specification included a sound level of 90 dB when at full speed, an operational range of , and an interval between major overhauls of five years or . While the prior generation of DMUs typically used a pair of engines for each power car, the specification called for only a single engine per car, as well as for sufficient cooling so that, even with one failed engine, a two-car unit could maintain a typical service performance without major deficient. It was also intended that the DMU could be assembled akin to building blocks, comprising between two and four cars that could be outfitted with various passenger amenities such as toilets and luggage spaces.

Initially formalised as a business specification, these requirements were transferred into a relatively broad technical specification that avoided any specifics other than those that were deemed essential for compatibility purposes. Thereafter, it was issued to various rolling stock manufacturers for a competitive tender. Under this process, responding manufacturers submitted bids to construct an initial series of three-car demonstration units. A constrained timetable of only 18 months between the date of order to delivery of these prototypes was also specified; this has been attributed as having compelled manufacturers to lean towards existing industrial practices for their submissions. The bid submitted by British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) was heavily based on its successful Class 455 EMU, sharing its body and the majority of its running gear, albeit equipped with two different power trains. The railway engineering company Metro-Cammell also bid, offered its own design that employed rivetted aluminium construction; this approach produced a meaningful weight reduction over conventional methods. BR officials opted to proceed with a pair of prototypes from both BREL and Metro-Cammell, resulting in the Class 150 and Class 151 respectively.

Between 1984 and 1985, these prototype units were delivered to BR and commenced their trial service period. Both the Class 150 and 151 units were subject to extensive evaluations with the aim of a larger production order being forthcoming for the more successful of the two types. Testing revealed that the Class 150 had exceptional ride quality, as well as fully satisfying the 50per cent engine-out performance requirements. It was also determined that both types achieved adequate noise levels for its intended service sector, but were also noted that this area would likely pose an issue if they were ever directed towards the higher end of the market. Early concerns regarding the body bending frequency of the Class 151 did not prove to have major substance to them. Ultimately, the Class 150 prototypes proved to be more reliable and an order for 50 two-car units was accordingly issued to BREL, leading to a production batch of Class 150s.

Even prior to the introduction of the Class 150, there was a recognised interest within BR at potentially tasking the new DMU with the replacement of other services, targeting not only first-generation DMUs but a number of locomotive-hauled trains as well. It had also been observed that, in its current configuration, the Class 150 would be unsatisfactory in some criteria for more-upmarket services, but that some thought into developing derivatives of the type to handle such services had been made. One early solution for reducing internal noise levels was the discarding of openable windows in favour of fully-sealed units, along with the relocation of the external doors into vestibules located at either ends of each coach.

Furthermore, the coaches could be stretched, providing more internal volume and thus enabling the somewhat cramped two-by-three seating arrangement of the Class 150 to be substituted with a more roomy two-by-two counterpart. These changes could be implemented without impacting much of the benefits of adopting the existing design. It was identified that this would result in a weight increase and thus a decreased power-to-weight ratio. Studies determined that the performance of the proposed DMU showed only minor change, and would achieve similar journey times across the intended cross-country routes to the Class 150. It was also found that, while there was a slight increase in fuel consumption due to the modifications, the envisioned DMU possessed significantly less fuel consumption than locomotive-hauled trains as well as reduced maintenance costs. Accordingly, it was decided to proceed with developing a detailed specification and issuing it to industry.

The Class 158 is a two- or three-car diesel unit designed for regional express services. The bodyshells are aluminium with doors at each end of the passenger saloon. Each vehicle is fitted with a Cummins or Perkins turbo-diesel engine that drives both axles on the inner bogie via a Voith T211 two-speed hydrokinetic transmission and Gmeinder GM190 final drive unit. The engines were rated at either or , depending on the model. Maximum speed is . Most units were built with two coaches, but a batch of units contained an additional centre car for the busy Transpennine Route. Each vehicle is fitted with a BSI autocoupler at both ends; however, only the cab ends have automatic electrical connecters. This allowed three-car sets to be formed by inserting an additional driving car into a set with an adaptor for two different gangway sizes.

==Description==
===Variants===
A total of 182 Class 158 units were constructed. The majority were built as two-car sets. 17 units were produced as three-car units; eight of these units have since had the centre car transferred to different units of the class, whilst another eight have been upgraded and redesignated as the Class 159. The final ten units were built specifically for West Yorkshire PTE &quot;Metro&quot; services around Leeds. The majority of units, as originally built by British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL), were configured with standard-class accommodation only; a number of Scottish-based sets were fitted with a small first-class section in one vehicle. Later on, several other sets were retrofitted with first-class accommodation. The passenger saloons are air-conditioned, which was a first for regional trains in the UK.

===Passenger facilities and performance===

Around the time of its introduction, British Rail was keen to promote the qualities of the Class 158, on one occasion publicly describing it as having brought &quot;new standards of comfort and quality to rail travel on Regional Railways&#x27; key long-distance cross-country routes&quot;.

As originally built, the interiors were fully carpeted throughout, large &quot;panoramic&quot; windows lined the sides, and a variety of seating arrangements were present, including airline-style and bays of four set around tables. Unlike the previous members of the Sprinter family, such as the Class 156 &quot;SuperSprinter&quot;, the Class 158 was outfitted with air conditioning units, an on-board payphone, power-operated interior doors, a toilet in each carriage, and provision for a refreshment trolley service. Despite an increased top speed of , the Class 158 reportedly promised a smoother and quieter ride in comparison to its predecessors. Toilets were fitted to both vehicles; one was wheelchair-accessible (as defined at the time of construction) and one standard. A wheelchair space was provided in the passenger section closest to the accessible toilet. Luggage racks were fitted at each end of the saloon, one of which is capable of being locked for mail and parcels.

In terms of serviceability, the Class 158 was anticipated to achieve of operation between major services, and to have a range of up to from each refuelling.

===Technical problems===
Despite the attention given to its passenger facilities, the construction and engineering technology used on the Class 158s contributed to some issues during its service life. As a lightweight unit and the first members of the &quot;Sprinter&quot; family to use disc brakes, autumn leaf mulch built up on wheel rims and prevented the units from correctly operating signalling track circuits. Though this was later solved by installing scrubbing blocks to clean the wheels, temporary solutions were sought during October 1992, with some units split and formed into hybrid units with Class 156 coaches, the latter possessing tread brakes which cleaned the wheels as a by-product of their standard operation.

The air conditioning systems of the Class 158 also proved to be unreliable in service, particularly following the outlawing of the CFC gases with which they had been originally designed to work. In the privatisation era, many operators elected either to re-engineer or entirely replace such equipment. As a result, the systems in use and their effectiveness vary considerably across the fleet.

The lightweight aluminium body of the Class 158 leads to a good &#x27;route availability&#x27; score, meaning that it is able to operate in areas of Britain&#x27;s railways that heavier units cannot. However, the units were refused permission by Network Rail to operate on the Conwy Valley and Borderlands lines due to station dwell times and issues of platform clearance.

==Operations==

===British Rail===

ScotRail was the first part of British Rail to introduce the Class 158s to public service in September 1990. These were employed on to services, as well as services to and . The Class 158s then went on to be deployed elsewhere in Britain, primarily in the Midlands, Northern England, Wales and the South West.

The majority of the Class 158 fleet was directed towards the Regional Railways division; accordingly, it rapidly became the dominant platform on the numerous secondary express services between provincial towns and cities across Great Britain. Examples include the long-distance TransPennine services in the north of England, as well as a range of upgraded regional services in the Midlands, Wales and the South West. During the mid-1990s, the Alphaline brand centered around the Class 158s and the higher-end regional express services. These were routinely promoted as possessing premium passenger amenities that traditional regional rolling stock had lacked, such as the presence of British Telecom card phones and air conditioning.

===Post privatisation===
After the privatisation of British Rail, the Class 158 fleet was divided among several franchises.

====ScotRail====

The first privatised incarnation of ScotRail inherited a 46-strong fleet which continued in service. Following the introduction of newly built Class 170 Turbostar units on primary express services in 1999, the Class 158 fleet was reduced in number by six, with those remaining cascaded away to secondary routes such as the Far North Line.

During 2003, plans were mooted for a portion of the fleet to be swapped with Class 156 units operated by Central Trains, as the latter were thought better suited to some of the short-distance routes that were being operated by ScotRail&#x27;s 158s. However, this scheme failed to materialise and, by the mid-2000s, operations of ScotRail’s Class 158s ranged from short hops (such as Glasgow Queen Street to ) to rural lines and long-distance expresses, supplementing other express units. In 2010, these units started to appear at Glasgow Central station to run on the Glasgow Central to Edinburgh via Shotts line, and on to the Glasgow Central to Whifflet line. Some additional units have since been acquired from other operators to provide extra capacity.

Refurbishment and reliverying has also taken place since privatisation. The original ScotRail franchise applied its own livery to the Class 158s, followed by a further repaint by First ScotRail after it took control of the franchise. The fleet has now gained a permanent blue-and-white livery based on the Scottish Saltire, after Transport Scotland announced in September 2008 that it was specifying a permanent livery for all Scottish trains, which would not be changed in the event of a change of franchisee. Interiors have also seen attention on more than one occasion. The most recent refurbishment of 25 units involved repainting, new seating, extra luggage space and new customer information systems. Toilet retention tanks were also fitted.

====Transport for Wales====
In the early days of privatisation, the Class 158 &quot;Express Sprinter&quot; units were in regular use by Wales &amp; West on its long-distance Alphaline services from South Wales to North-West England, North Wales, Cornwall and London Waterloo, as well as on some Central Trains services to and along the Cambrian Line. Successor companies Wales &amp; Borders (2001) and Arriva Trains Wales (2003) continued to use this type of unit on similar workings, with a total allocation of 40 units also allowing Cambrian Line services to become entirely Class 158-operated. By the end of 2006, a total of 16 units (158815-158817 and 158842-158854) had returned to the leasing company, as Arriva gained exclusive use of the entire Class 175 &quot;Coradia&quot; fleet which had previously been shared with other train operators.

The remaining 24-strong Class 158 &quot;Express Sprinter&quot; fleet became permanently based at a purpose-built depot in Machynlleth during 2007. Despite initial problems in retro-fitting the necessary &#x27;glass cockpit&#x27;-style driver controls, Arriva&#x27;s Class 158 &quot;Express Sprinter&quot; units became the first fleet in the UK to be equipped for regular use with the ETCS Level 2 signalling system. Commercial operation under ETCS started on 28 March 2011.

Accordingly, the units operate all Cambrian Line services between Mid Wales and Birmingham, and they supplemented the now-withdrawn Class 175 &quot;Coradia&quot; units on other long-distance routes. During 2009, Arriva also proposed using the fleet to provide a direct service between and London, although this proposal was later rejected by the Office of Rail Regulation.

Between December 2010 and October 2012, there was a comprehensive refurbishment of the ATW Class 158 fleet, during which almost the entirety of the interiors was replaced with &#x27;as new&#x27; fittings and fixtures. This work, which was funded by the Welsh Assembly Government at a cost of £7.5m, included both interior and exterior repainting, the installation of replacement seating, wall coverings, carpets, lighting, luggage racks and toilet fittings. A passenger information system was also fitted, while selected seats gained at-seat power sockets for mobile phones and laptops.

Prior to the early 2010s refurbishment, the fleet had been subject to only minor attention to its interior since a refit by Wales &amp; West during the late 1990s (little more than the fabric on the older seats changed and CCTV fitted) as well as having been only partially repainted into Arriva colours externally. The door controls and exterior destination displays were two of the few elements to be replaced prior to this refurbishment work.

During 2017, Wi-Fi equipment was fitted fleetwide. In June of the following year, the Class 158s were progressively modified for conformance with the Persons with Reduced Mobility (PRM) requirements so that the fleet could be operated beyond 1 January 2020; this work involved the expansion of space allocated to passengers using wheelchairs, the installation of wider internal doorways, and the toilet areas being rebuilt to be fully accessibility-friendly; toilet retention tanks were also fitted at this time. During late August 2018, the first PRM-compliant Class 158 was introduced by ATW.

On 14 October 2018, the Class 158 fleet was transferred to the new operator Transport for Wales. During February 2019, the first unit was seen in Transport for Wales colours. As early as 2018, it was being reported that Transport for Wales were planning to replace its Class 158s with newly built Class 197 multiple units by 2023.

====East Midlands Railway====

The Class 158 &quot;Express Sprinter&quot; Units were introduced to the East Midlands by Regional Railways Central to replace the Class 156 &quot;Super Sprinter&quot; on long-distance express services branded as Alphaline, such as to via . Following privatisation, Central Trains operated these services but quickly procured a large fleet of Class 170 &quot;Turbostar&quot; units for such services and transferred the Class 158 fleet to secondary routes such as to and to .

East Midlands Trains (EMT) had a fleet of 25 units inherited from Central Trains, with some units transferred from First Great Western and South West Trains. EMR&#x27;s Class 158 &quot;Express Sprinter&quot; units operate long-distance express services (such as Norwich to Liverpool) and secondary non-express workings such as Nottingham to , Nottingham to Matlock and to .

The hourly Norwich to Liverpool service has been criticised for overcrowding, especially between Liverpool and Nottingham. This resulted from the Department for Transport specifying two-coach units in the EMT franchise starting in November 2007. In the light of persistent and excessive overcrowding, with some passengers being left behind on occasions, the DfT eventually admitted that it had made a mistake. Various cascades of other units enabled more Class 158 stock to be released for this route, and from the December 2011 timetable change the busiest services have been lengthened to four-coach trains between Liverpool and Nottingham, with units splitting and joining at Nottingham as necessary, two-coach trains being regarded as adequate between Nottingham and Norwich. Further services on this route were strengthened from December 2012.

During May 2015, 158889 transferred to EMT from South West Trains on a two-year loan. This allocation was then made permanent in August 2017 following Stagecoach&#x27;s loss of the South Western franchise to South Western Railway.

On 18 August 2019, all units were passed to East Midlands Railway, who operated them under the “EMR Regional” sub-brand. As part of its full fleet replacement, EMR plans to gradually replace the Class 158 along with its other Sprinter family members with newer Class 170 Turbostars from 2020.

====Great Western Railway====

The Wales &amp; West franchise (later Wessex Trains) originally operated twelve Class 158 &quot;Express Sprinter&quot; units on long-distance services on the Wessex Main Line. These units were extended into three-coach formations with the acquisition of further units. Unlike the purpose-built three-car Class 158s and Class 159 units, the centre car was a Driving Motor with the cab locked out of use and an adapter to connect the different-sized gangways.

In 2006, First Great Western (FGW) inherited the Wessex Trains fleet following the merger of the Great Western and Wessex franchises. FGW then swapped most of their former Wessex Trains Class 158s for former First TransPennine Express examples. This was so that FGW could have all Class 158 units that were owned by Porterbrook. During late 2007 and early 2008, the FGW Class 158 &quot;Express Sprinter&quot; fleet was refurbished. Improvements included: re-upholstery of seats, and repainting or replacement of interior fittings, alterations to interior lighting and total replacement of toilets. Additionally, the windows have been replaced with safer laminated glass and Halon fire extinguishers replaced with foam ones. At the same time, the units&#x27; engines were overhauled and the units repainted in FGW&#x27;s own lilac and blue colours.

The fleet is now used on long-distance services between and / , and / , and / and . They are now also used on the Tarka Line on services between and replacing the class 143 &#x27;Pacers&#x27; which were running on the line. Great Western Railway operates a total of 18 units, of which six are hybrids (units where one end coach is a driving coach from another unit of the same class tagged on to a two car unit), one is a purpose-built three car unit and the remaining 11 are two coach sets.

====Northern Trains====

As a result of the privatisation process, Northern Spirit (later Arriva Trains Northern) was created from Regional Railways North East. Northern Spirit inherited a large fleet of Class 158 units, many of which were used on TransPennine Express services, with others used on West Yorkshire Metro-sponsored services. First North Western (descended from Regional Railways North West) had eight Class 158s, which were based at Newton Heath and used on various mid- to long-distance routes, which were transferred to Leeds Neville Hill depot to join the rest of the 158 fleet at the start of the Northern Rail franchise. A number of 158s have been sponsored by Merseytravel despite the fact that they do not go near Merseyside; the sponsorship arrangement was to ensure that Class 156 DMUs were cascaded from West Yorkshire to the busiest Merseyside services.

During 2006, First TransPennine Express started to replace its Class 158s with newer Class 185 &quot;Desiro&quot; and Class 170 &quot;Turbostar&quot; units. The Class 158s were subsequently transferred to Northern Rail, Central Trains, South West Trains and First Great Western.

Following a franchise change, all Northern units were passed to Arriva Rail North in April 2016. Throughout the 2010s, Northern conducted a refurbishment programme on its Class 158s, starting with the three-car DMUs and later progressing to the two-car members of the fleet.

In 2018, Northern acquired an additional eight Class 158 units from Abellio Scotrail; the first few units being transferred during February 2018 while the remainder followed in December 2018. On 1 March 2020, the units transferred to the franchise&#x27;s new operator Northern Trains.

====South Western Railway====

Currently South Western Railway operates Class 158s from and to Waterloo; and on the Salisbury to via service. South Western Railway also operates Class 159 units.

====Virgin CrossCountry====
Five units (158747–158751) were delivered to British Rail&#x27;s InterCity business unit to operate services from Manchester Airport to Edinburgh via the West Coast Main Line. All five Class 158s were transferred to Virgin CrossCountry as a result of the privatisation process; these were subsequently used on services between Swindon and Birmingham via Stroud. During 2003, the company&#x27;s Class 158s were displaced by the newly built and high-speed diesel tilting trains.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 25 March 1994 at Newton Abbot, 158833, working a Paignton to Cardiff service, ran into the back of a Class 43 HST standing in the platform with a Penzance to Edinburgh train. Thirty-one people were injured.
* On 3 December 2005, unit 158856 was involved in an accident at in which two passengers were killed whilst crossing the line. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) criticised the risk assessment at the crossing as inadequate.
* On 1 February 2008, the same unit 158856 collided with debris from an overline footbridge, which had just been accidentally demolished by a tipper lorry, near Barrow-upon-Soar. The lorry driver had forgotten to fully lower the tipper body after delivering materials to a site next to the railway, and drove into the footbridge, knocking its superstructure onto the track. The DMU hit the footbridge debris approximately one minute later. Three people including the driver were taken to hospital.
* On 22 January 2010, unit 158701 was derailed at due to faulty points. One person sustained minor injuries.
* On 21 July 2013, unit 158774 was parked empty at when it was run into by 156402. Eight passengers were injured. The cause was driver error.
* On 1 April 2017, unit 158758 collided with the buffer stops at at a speed of . Fifteen people were injured. The cause was driver error.
* On 31 October 2021, a South Western Railway Class 159 unit, 159102, collided with Great Western Railway class 158 coupled units, 158762 and 158763, at Salisbury tunnel junction, immediately before Fisherton tunnel. A preliminary RAIB report found the cause was poor adhesion conditions which led to the SWR train over-running a signal set at danger. Unit 158763 was written off in the accident.
*On 6 February 2024, unit 158856 was involved in another accident in which it collided with a fallen tree and was derailed between and stations. One of the 31 passengers on board was injured. The RAIB opened an investigation into the accident.
*On 21 October 2024, two units 158824 and 158841 were involved in a head-on collision at Talerddig in Powys, in which one passenger died and 15 others were injured.

<doc id="1016829" wikidata="Q735649" url="?curid=1016829" title="Saonnet">
<text>Saonnet () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France.

== Toponymy ==
The locality was successively called Saunnet in 1254, Soanetum in 1284, then Saonet in the 15th century. Same definition as for Saon with the diminutive French suffix &quot;et&quot;.

== History ==
The Littry coal mines operated several mine shafts in the town between the end of the 18th century and the middle of the 19th century.

During the Battle of Normandy, the Allies built an airfield here.

== Geography ==
Saonnet is located thirteen kilometers west of Bayeux, in the regional natural park of the Marais du Cotentin et du Bessin. It is crossed by the river Tortonne.

=== Climate ===
The climate that characterizes the town is qualified, in 2010, as &quot;french oceanic climate&quot;, according to the typology of the climates of France which then had eight major types of climates in mainland France. In 2020, the town comes out of the &quot;ocean climate&quot; type in the classification established by Météo-France, which now only counts, at first glance, five main types of climates in mainland France. This type of climate results in mild temperatures and relatively abundant rainfall (in connection with the disturbances coming from the Atlantic), distributed throughout the year with a slight maximum from October to February.

The climatic parameters that made it possible to establish the 2010 typology include six variables for temperature and eight for precipitation, whose values correspond to the 1971-2000 normal. The seven main variables characterizing the municipality are presented in the box below.

With climate change, these variables have evolved. A study carried out in 2015 by the Directorate General for Energy and Climate supplemented by regional studies predicts that the average temperature should increase and the average rainfall decrease, with, however, strong regional variations. These changes can be seen on the nearest Météo-France meteorological station, in the town of Balleroy-sur-Drôme, commissioned in 2007 and which is 11 km away as the crow flies where the average annual temperature is 11.2 °C and the amount of precipitation is 927.2 mm for the period 1981–20109. On the nearest historical meteorological station, in the town of Carpiquet, commissioned in 1945 and 33 km away, the average annual temperature changes from 10.9 °C for the period 1971–2000 to 11.2 °C for 1981–2010, then 11.5 °C for 1991–2020.

== Town Plan ==

=== Typology ===
Saonnet is a rural town. It indeed one of the municipalities with little or very little density, within the meaning of the municipal density grid of INSEE.

In addition, the town is part of the Bayeux catchment area, of which it is a town. This area, which includes 29 towns, is categorized as an area with fewer than 50,000 inhabitants.

=== Land Usage ===
The land cover of the municipality, as it appears from the European biophysical land cover database Corine Land Cover (CLC), is marked by the importance of agricultural land (100% in 2018), a proportion identical to that of 1990 (100%). The detailed breakdown in 2018 is as follows: Grassland (67.5%), Arable land (20.8%), heterogeneous agricultural areas (11.7%).

The Institut national de l&#x27;information géographique et forestière (IGN) also provides an online tool to compare the evolution over time of land use in the municipality (or territories at different scales). Several periods are accessible in the form of maps or aerial photos: the Cassini map (18th century), the general staff map (1820–1866) and the current period (1950 to today).

<doc id="1016830" wikidata="Q1140678" url="?curid=1016830" title="The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle&quot; is one of 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the seventh story of twelve in the collection &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in January 1892.

==Plot==
As London prepares for Christmas, newspapers report the theft of a near-priceless gemstone, the &quot;Blue Carbuncle&quot;, from the Countess of Morcar&#x27;s hotel suite. The police arrest John Horner, a plumber with a criminal record who was in the Countess&#x27;s room repairing a fireplace grate.

Meanwhile, at 221B Baker Street, Dr Watson finds Sherlock Holmes contemplating a battered old hat brought to him by Peterson, a commissionaire who seeks Holmes&#x27;s help in returning it and a Christmas goose to their rightful owners after he found them the previous night in the street after a scuffle. A tag on the goose reading &quot;For Mrs Henry Baker&quot; is of little assistance, as the name is a very common one. Ultimately, Peterson takes the goose home for dinner and Holmes keeps the hat to study as an intellectual exercise, deducing Baker&#x27;s age, social standing, intellect, and domestic status. 

An excited Peterson bursts in, having found the stolen gem in the goose&#x27;s crop. That evening when Baker appears in response to advertisements placed by Holmes in the London newspapers, Holmes returns his hat and offers him a new goose. Happily accepting the replacement bird, Baker refuses the original bird&#x27;s entrails, convincing Holmes that he knew nothing about the gem and that he had innocently purchased the goose, as he says, at the Alpha Inn, a pub near the British Museum.

Holmes and Watson visit the pub, where the proprietor informs them that the bird had been purchased from a Covent Garden dealer. However, the latter refuses to help, complaining that he has been repeatedly pestered by another man about geese purchased by the Alpha Inn. Realising that he is not the only one aware of the goose&#x27;s importance, Holmes tricks the dealer into revealing that the bird was supplied to him by its breeder, a Mrs Oakshott of Brixton. The dealer&#x27;s other &quot;pesterer&quot; re-appears – it is James Ryder, head attendant of the hotel where the gem had been stolen.
After being confronted with the jewel back at Baker Street, a remorseful Ryder admits that he and his accomplice, the Countess&#x27;s maid, had contrived to frame Horner, as his criminal past would make him an easy scapegoat. During a visit to his sister, Mrs Oakshott, Ryder had concealed the gem by feeding it to a goose she had promised him as a gift, but confused the bird with another. By the time he realised his mistake, his goose had already been sold. As it is Christmas, Holmes takes pity on Ryder and allows him to leave, concluding that the man is too frightened by what happened to offend again. Holmes is confident that Horner will be freed once the case against him collapses.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle&quot; was first published with eight illustrations by Sidney Paget in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in January 1892, and in the US edition of the &quot;Strand&quot; in February 1892.

<doc id="1016832" wikidata="Q1332985" url="?curid=1016832" title="Media monitoring service">
<text>A media monitoring service, a press clipping service, clipping service, or a clipping bureau, as known in earlier times, provides clients with copies of media content, which is of specific interest to them and subject to changing demand; what they provide may include documentation, content, analysis, or editorial opinion, specifically or widely. These services tend to specialize their coverage by subject, industry, size, geography, publication, journalist, or editor. The printed sources, which could be readily monitored, greatly expanded with the advent of telegraphy and submarine cables in the mid- to late-19th century; the various types of media now available proliferated in the 20th century, with the development of radio, television, the photocopier and the World Wide Web. Though media monitoring is generally used for capturing content or editorial opinion, it also may be used to capture advertising content.

Media monitoring services have been variously termed over time, as new players entered the market, new forms of media were created, and as new uses from available content developed. Alternative terms for these monitoring services include information logistics, media intelligence, and media information services.

==History==

Since mass media traditionally was limited solely to print media, naturally the monitoring was also limited to these media. The first press clipping agency in London was established in 1852 by Henry Romeike, partnering with newsdealer Curtice. An agency named &quot;L&#x27;Argus de la presse&quot; was established in Paris in 1879 by Alfred Cherie, who offered a press-clipping service to Parisian actors, enabling them to buy reviews of their work rather than purchasing the whole newspaper. The National Press Intelligence Company began in New York in 1885. More than a dozen clipping services were in operation by 1899. The services opening up across the United States formed a cooperative network to increase their range. By 1932, the Romeike company and Luce&#x27;s Press Clipping Bureau shared 80% of the clipping business in the United States. 

Initially, press clipping services primarily served &quot;vanity&quot; purposes: actors, tycoons, and socialites eager to read what newspapers had written about them. By the 1930s, the bulk of the clipping subscriptions were for big business. Government agencies have been subscribers, as have other newspapers. 

Early clipping services employed women to scan periodicals for mentions of specific names or terms. The marked periodicals were then cut out by men and pasted to dated slips. Women would then sort those slips and clippings to be sent to the services&#x27; clients. 

As radio and later television broadcasting were introduced in the 20th century, press clipping agencies began to expand their services into the monitoring of these broadcast media, and this task was greatly facilitated by the development of commercial audio and video tape recording systems in the 1950s and 1960s. 

With the growth of the Internet in the 1990s, media monitoring service extended their services to the monitoring of online information sources using new digital search and scan technologies to provide output of interest to their clients. For example, Universal Press Clipping Bureau, which began in 1908 in Omaha, Nebraska, changed its name in the 1990s to Universal Information Services as it expanded into digital technology. In 1998, the now-defunct WebClipping website began monitoring Internet-based news media. By 2012, Gartner estimated that there were more than 250 social media monitoring vendors.

==Evolution==

From a cut-and-clip service, media clipping today has expanded to incorporate technology with information. The idea behind clipping services, that information could be isolated from its original publication, influenced the interfaces of digital news sources such as LexisNexis, enabling users to search by keywords. Online tools such as Google Alerts notify services and individual users of results for specific terms and names.

Service delivery happens at three fronts. Clients may get their original hard copy clips through traditional means (mail/overnight delivery) or may opt for digital delivery. Digital delivery allows the end user to receive via email all the relevant news of the company, competition and industry daily, with updates as they break. The same news may also be indexed (as allowed by copyright laws) in a searchable database to be accessed by subscribers. Another option of this service is auto-analysis, wherein the data can be viewed and compared in different formats.

Every organization that uses PR invariably uses news monitoring as well. In addition to tracking their own publicity, self-generated or otherwise, news monitoring clients also use the service to track competition or industry specific trends or legislation, to build a contact base of reporters, experts, leaders for future reference, to audit the effectiveness of their PR campaigns, to verify that PR, marketing and sales messages are in sync, and to measure impact on their target market. City, State, and Federal agencies use news monitoring services to stay informed in regions they otherwise would not be able to monitor themselves and to verify that the public information disseminated is accurate, accessible in multiple formats and available to the public. Some monitoring services specialize in one or more areas of press clipping, TV and radio monitoring, or internet tracking. Media analysis is also offered by most news monitoring services.

Television news monitoring companies, especially in the United States, capture and index closed captioning text and search it for client references. Some TV monitoring companies employ human monitors who review and abstract program content; other services rely on automated search programs to search and index stories.

Online media monitoring services utilize automated software called spiders or robots (bots) to automatically monitor the content of free online news sources including newspapers, magazines, trade journals, TV station and news syndication services. Online services generally provide links but may also provide text versions of the articles. Results may or may not be verified for accuracy by the online monitoring service. Most newspapers do not include all of their print content online and some have web content that does not appear in print.

In the United States, there are trade associations formed to share best practices which include the North American Conference of Press Clipping Services and the International Association of Broadcast Monitors.

==Law cases==

Two parallel cases developed in 2012, one in the United States, and one in the United Kingdom. In each case, the legality of temporary copies and the online media monitoring service offered to clients, was in dispute. Essentially the two cases covered the same issue (media clippings shown to clients online) and with the same defendant, Meltwater Group. The plaintiff differed, being a UK copyright collection society (UK) rather than Associated Press (US), but upon parallel grounds.

The activity was ruled unlawful in the US (under the &quot;fair use&quot; doctrine). In the UK under UK and EU copyright law, service providers need a licence. Users are also licensed. If users only viewed the original source without getting a headline or snippet or printing the article this is not an infringement, and temporary copies to enable a lawful purpose are themselves lawful, but in practice services for business do not work this way.

<doc id="1016834" wikidata="Q7926812" url="?curid=1016834" title="Victoria Junior College">
<text>Victoria Junior College (VJC) is a co-educational junior college in Singapore offering pre-university education to boarding and day-students. Founded in 1984, the school stands on Marine Vista, less than one kilometre from the affiliated Victoria School.

VJC is part of the Victoria-Cedar alliance and is one of Singapore&#x27;s top Junior Colleges. The school&#x27;s programmes and activities are advised by the Victoria Advisory Committee, while day-to-day operations of the school is run by the School Principal. Tutors and faculty members are responsible for the governance of student life.

==History==
Victoria Junior College was established in 1984 to replace the Pre-University classes in Victoria School (VS). The pioneer batch of 776 students was received with 51 teachers and 16 supporting staff. The outstanding results of the pioneer batch of students in the GCE &#x27;A&#x27; Level examinations was to set the academic standard for succeeding generations of Victorians.

Over the years, VJC has widely been recognised, based on MOE rankings and entry scores, as one of the top three junior colleges in Singapore that offer the &#x27;A&#x27; Levels. VJC was also ranked the top junior college in the Ministry of Education&#x27;s (MOE) ST ranking of junior colleges in 1995 and 2001, based on academic results. More recently in 2019, it had the 4th toughest entry score amongst junior colleges offering the &#x27;A&#x27; Levels.

In 1989, VJC was the first and, until 2005, the only junior college in Singapore to offer Theatre Studies and Drama as an &#x27;A&#x27; Level subject. It also offered a university-level French curriculum as part of the Language Elective Programme until it was discontinued in 2006.

Since 2005, VJC has offered the Integrated Programme, allowing students to skip O Levels and proceed to junior college. The Victoria Integrated Programme (VIP) was implemented as a four-year programme starting from Secondary 3. In 2012 it was replaced by the six-year Victoria-Cedar Alliance Integrated Programme (VCA IP), in partnership with Cedar Girls&#x27; Secondary School and the affiliated Victoria School.

VJC was awarded the School Excellence Award in 2007, the top award in the MOE Masterplan of Awards framework.

==Principal==
The college saw its first leadership change in 2001, when founding principal, Lee Phui Mun, stepped down after 18 years of service. She was succeeded by Chan Khah Gek, who was a former chemistry teacher in the school. In 2006, Chan Poh Meng, formerly a Superintendent at the Schools Division, took over the reins from Low. In December 2013, Ek Soo Ben, Deputy Director at the Standards and Research Academy of Singapore Teachers and a former Economics teacher at VJC, succeeded Chan.

<text>Francesco Hayez (; 10 February 1791 – 12 February 1882) was an Italian painter. He is considered one of the leading artists of Romanticism in mid-19th-century Milan, and is renowned for his grand historical paintings, political allegories, and portraits.

==Biography==

Francesco Hayez was from a relatively poor family from Venice. His father, Giovanni, was of French origin while his mother, Chiara Torcella, was from Murano. Francesco was the youngest of five sons. He was brought up by his mother&#x27;s sister, who had married Giovanni Binasco, a well-off shipowner and art collector. Hayez displayed a predisposition for drawing since childhood. His uncle, having noticed his precocious talent, apprenticed him to an art restorer in Venice. Hayez would later become a pupil of the painter Francesco Maggiotto with whom he continued his studies for three years. He was admitted to the painting course of the New Academy of Fine Arts in Venice in 1806, where he studied under Teodoro Matteini. In 1809 he won a competition from the Academy of Venice for a one-year residency at the Accademia di San Luca in Rome. He remained in Rome until 1814, then moved to Naples where he was commissioned by Joachim Murat to paint a major work depicting &quot;Ulysses at the court of Alcinous&quot;. In the mid-1830s he attended the Maffei Salon in Milan, hosted by Clara Maffei. Maffei&#x27;s husband would later commission Hayez a portrait of his wife. In 1850 Hayez was appointed director of the Brera Academy.

Over the course of a long career, Hayez proved to be particularly prolific. His output included historic paintings designed to appeal to the patriotic sensibility of his patrons as well as works reflecting the desire to accompany a Neoclassic style to grand themes, either from biblical or classical literature. He also painted scenes from theatrical presentations. Conspicuously absent from his oeuvre, however, are altarpieces - possibly due to the Napoleonic invasions that deconsecrated many churches and convents in Northern Italy. Art historian Corrado Ricci described Hayez as a &quot;classicist&quot; who then evolved into a style of &quot;emotional tumult&quot;.

His portraits have the intensity of Ingres and the Nazarene movement. Often sitting, Hayez&#x27;s subjects are often dressed in austere, black and white clothing, with little to no accoutrements. While Hayez made portraits for the nobility, he also explored other subjects like fellow artists and musicians. Late in his career, he is known to have worked using photographs.

One of Hayez&#x27;s favorite themes was semi-clothed Odalisque evocative of oriental themes – a favorite topic of Romantic painters. The depictions of harems and their women allowed artists the ability to paint scenes otherwise not acceptable within society. Even Hayez&#x27;s Mary Magdalene has more sensuality than religious fervor.

Hayez&#x27;s painting &quot;The Kiss&quot; was considered among his best work by his contemporaries, and is possibly his most well-known effort. The anonymous, unaffected gesture of the couple does not require knowledge of myth or literature to interpret, and appeals to a modern gaze.

A scientific assessment of Hayez&#x27;s career has been made complicated by his proclivity for not signing or dating his works. Often dates in his paintings indicate when the work was acquired or sold, not the time of its creation. Moreover, he often painted the same compositions several times with minimal variations if any at all.

Among his pupils from the Brera Academy were Carlo Belgioioso, Amanzio Cattaneo, Alessandro Focosi, Giovanni Battista Lamperti, Livo Pecora, Angelo Pietrasanta, Antonio Silo, Ismaele Teglio Milla and Francesco Valaperta.

Hayez died in Milan, age 91. His studio at the Brera Academy is marked with a plaque.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Speckled Band&quot; is one of 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the eighth story of twelve in the collection &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was originally published in &quot;Strand Magazine&quot; in February 1892.

&quot;The Speckled Band&quot; is a classic locked-room mystery that deals with the themes of parental greed, inheritance and freedom. Tinged with Gothic elements, it is considered by many to be one of Doyle&#x27;s finest works, with the author himself calling it his best story. The story, alongside the rest of the Sherlock Holmes canon, has become a defining part of detective fiction. It has been adapted for television, film, theatre, radio and a video game. It is part of the exhibit at the Sherlock Holmes Museum. The theatrical adaptation was written and produced by Doyle himself, directed by and starring Lyn Harding as Grimesby Roylott. The role of Holmes was played by H. A. Saintsbury. Doyle famously clashed with Harding over several details of the script, but later reconciled with him after the universal success of the play.

==Plot==


In April 1883, Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson rise early one morning to meet a young woman named Helen Stoner, who is in great fear of her life. She explains that her mother married her stepfather, Dr. Grimesby Roylott, in British India when Helen and her twin sister Julia were two years old. Dr. Roylott is the impoverished sole survivor of a formerly wealthy but ill-tempered violent and amoral aristocratic Anglo-Saxon family in Surrey. He had served time in an Indian prison for killing his Indian butler in a rage. Afterwards, Roylott had moved to England and retired after Helen&#x27;s mother was killed in a railway accident eight years prior. The sisters lived at the heavy mortgaged and debt ridden Roylott estate of Stoke Moran; Dr Roylott violent temper and physical strength make him a terror in the local village.

The sisters did not live happily, but when Julia got engaged two years prior, things promised to improve. Shortly before her wedding day, Julia confided in Helen that she had heard a low whistle in the night. That same night, Helen was startled out of bed by her sister&#x27;s scream. Helen found Julia at her door, warning of &quot;the speckled band&quot; shortly before dying. The official inquest was unable to determine the cause of death: the room was securely locked both inside and outside, and the doctors could find no poison. 

Two years later, it was Helen&#x27;s turn to get engaged. However, when Roylott started repairs outside the house, she had to move into her sister&#x27;s old room. One night, she heard the whistle that heralded her sister&#x27;s death; terrified, she approached Holmes the next day.

After Holmes agrees to take the case, he is visited by Roylott, who threatens to harm him if he interferes. Undaunted, Holmes leaves for the courthouse to examine Helen&#x27;s mother&#x27;s will; because of the fall in investment prices the yearly income of £1,100, is not more than £750. Each daughter can claim an income of £250, in case of marriage, and Roylott would not have much to live on. He and Watson then travel to Stoke Moran, where he scrutinizes the premises. Within Helen&#x27;s room, he discovers her bed is anchored to the floor, an unconnected bell cord has been installed, and a ventilator hole connects her room to Roylott&#x27;s. In Roylott&#x27;s room, they notice a large safe and a saucer of milk.

Holmes warns Helen to move to her old room that night, while he and Watson stay in Julia&#x27;s room. Holmes remarks to Watson that Roylott is comparable to Drs William Palmer and Edward William Pritchard. After a tense wait, they hear a slight metallic noise and see a dim light through the ventilator, followed by a hissing sound. Holmes lights a candle and strikes at the bell cord, and they hear a terrifying scream. Holmes and Watson go to Roylott&#x27;s room, where they see the &quot;speckled band&quot; – a venomous snake which Holmes identifies as the most poisonous snake in India. Angered by Holmes&#x27; blows, the snake had attacked Roylott, killing him. The official inquest rules Roylott met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. Though Holmes also admits to indirectly killing Roylott, he does not foresee it troubling him and chooses not to tell the police Roylott&#x27;s full motive to spare Helen any further grief.

==Inspirations==
Richard Lancelyn Green, the editor of the 2000 Oxford paperback edition of &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, surmises that Doyle&#x27;s source for the story appears to have been the article named &quot;Called on by a Boa Constrictor. A West African Adventure&quot; in &quot;Cassell&#x27;s Saturday Journal&quot;, published in February 1891. In the article, a captain tells how he was dispatched to a remote camp in West Africa to stay in a tumbledown cabin that belonged to a Portuguese trader. On the first night in the cabin, he is awoken by a creaking sound, and sees &quot;a dark queer-looking thing hanging down through the ventilator above it&quot;. It turns out to be the largest &quot;Boa constrictor&quot; that he has seen (more likely a python because there are no boas in Africa). He is paralysed with fear as the serpent comes down into the room. Unable to cry out for help, the captain spots an old bell that hung from a projecting beam above one of the windows. The bell cord had rotted away, but by means of a stick, he manages to ring it and raise the alarm.

== Identity of &#x27;the speckled band&#x27;==
&quot;It is a &quot;swamp adder&quot;!&quot; cried Holmes; &quot;the deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten.&quot;

The key characteristics to be considered in identification of the snake are:
* A fast-acting neurotoxic venom, as opposed to the common haemotoxic venom of most snakes
* Ability to climb well
* Appearance described as a &quot;yellow band with brownish speckles&quot;, a &quot;squat, diamond-shaped&quot; head, and a &quot;puffed&quot; neck
* An Indian origin

There is no real-life snake that matches all of these characteristics. The snake that comes closest is the Indian cobra.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventure of the Speckled Band&quot; was first published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in February 1892, and in the United States in the US edition of the &quot;Strand&quot; in March 1892.

<doc id="1016857" wikidata="Q3174035" url="?curid=1016857" title="Law of effect">
<text>The law of effect, or Thorndike&#x27;s law, is a psychology principle advanced by Edward Thorndike in 1898 on the matter of behavioral conditioning (not then formulated as such) which states that &quot;responses that produce a satisfying effect in a particular situation become more likely to occur again in that situation, and responses that produce a discomforting effect become less likely to occur again in that
situation.&quot; 

This notion is very similar to that of the evolutionary theory, if a certain character trait provides an advantage for reproduction then that trait will persist. The terms &quot;satisfying&quot; and &quot;dissatisfying&quot; appearing in the definition of the law of effect were eventually replaced by the terms &quot;reinforcing&quot; and &quot;punishing,&quot; when operant conditioning became known. &quot;Satisfying&quot; and &quot;dissatisfying&quot; conditions are determined behaviorally, and they cannot be accurately predicted, because each animal has a different idea of these two terms than another animal. The new terms, &quot;reinforcing&quot; and &quot;punishing&quot; are used differently in psychology than they are colloquially. Something that reinforces a behavior makes it more likely that that behavior will occur again, and something that punishes a behavior makes it less likely that behavior will occur again.

Thorndike&#x27;s law of effect refutes the ideas George Romanes&#x27; book &quot;Animal Intelligence&quot;, stating that anecdotal evidence is weak and is typically not useful. The book stated that animals, like humans, think things through when dealing with a new environment or situation. Instead, Thorndike hypothesized that animals, to understand their physical environment, must physically interact with it using trial and error, until a successful result is obtained. This is illustrated in his cat experiment, in which a cat is placed in a shuttlebox and eventually learns, by interacting with the environment of the box, how to escape.

== History ==
This principle, discussed early on by Lloyd Morgan, is usually associated with the connectionism of Edward Thorndike, who said that if an association is followed by a &quot;satisfying state of affairs&quot; it will be strengthened and if it is followed by an &quot;annoying state of affairs&quot; it will be weakened.

The modern version of the law of effect is conveyed by the notion of reinforcement as it is found in operant conditioning. The essential idea is that behavior can be modified by its consequences, as Thorndike found in his famous experiments with hungry cats in puzzle boxes. The cat was placed in a box that could be opened if the cat pressed a lever or pulled a loop. Thorndike noted the amount of time it took the cat to free itself on successive trials in the box. He discovered that during the first few trials the cat would respond in many ineffective ways, such as scratching at the door or the ceiling, finally freeing itself with the press or pull by trial-and-error. With each successive trial, it took the cat, on average, less and less time to escape. Thus, in modern terminology, the correct response was reinforced by its consequence, release from the box.

== Definition ==
Law of effect is the belief that a pleasing after-effect strengthens the action that produced it.

The law of effect was published by Edward Thorndike in 1905 and states that when an S-R association is established in instrumental conditioning between the instrumental response and the contextual stimuli that are present, the response is reinforced and the S-R association holds the sole responsibility for the occurrence of that behavior. Simply put, this means that once the stimulus and response are associated, the response is likely to occur without the stimulus being present.
It holds that responses that produce a satisfying or pleasant state of affairs in a particular situation are more likely to occur again in a similar situation. Conversely, responses that produce a discomforting, annoying or unpleasant effect are less likely to occur again in the situation.

Psychologists have been interested in the factors that are important in behavior change and control since psychology emerged as a discipline. One of the first principles associated with learning and behavior was the Law of Effect, which states that behaviors that lead to satisfying outcomes are likely to be repeated, whereas behaviors that lead to undesired outcomes are less likely to recur.

Thorndike emphasized the importance of the situation in eliciting a response; the cat would not go about making the lever-pressing movement if it was not in the puzzle box but was merely in a place where the response had never been reinforced. The situation involves not just the cat&#x27;s location but also the stimuli it is exposed to, for example, the hunger and the desire for freedom. The cat recognizes the inside of the box, the bars, and the lever and remembers what it needs to do to produce the correct response. This shows that learning and the law of effect are context-specific.

In an influential paper, R. J. Herrnstein (1970) proposed a quantitative relationship between response rate (&quot;B&quot;) and reinforcement rate (&quot;Rf&quot;):

&quot;B&quot; = &quot;k&quot; &quot;Rf&quot; / (&quot;Rf&quot;0 + &quot;Rf&quot;)

where &quot;k&quot; and &quot;Rf&quot;0 are constants. Herrnstein proposed that this formula, which he derived from the matching law he had observed in studies of concurrent schedules of reinforcement, should be regarded as a quantification of the law of effect. While the qualitative law of effect may be a tautology, this quantitative version is not.

=== Example ===
An example is often portrayed in drug addiction. When a person uses a substance for the first time and receives a positive outcome, they are likely to repeat the behavior due to the reinforcing consequence. Over time, the person&#x27;s nervous system will also develop a tolerance to the drug. Thus only by increasing dosage of the drug will provide the same satisfaction, making it dangerous for the user.

Thorndike&#x27;s Law of Effect can be compared to Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection in which successful organisms are more likely to prosper and survive to pass on their genes to the next generation, while the weaker, unsuccessful organisms are gradually replaced and &quot;stamped out&quot;. It can be said that the environment selects the &quot;fittest&quot; behavior for a situation, stamping out any unsuccessful behaviors, in the same way it selects the &quot;fittest&quot; individuals of a species. In an experiment that Thorndike conducted, he placed a hungry cat inside a &quot;puzzle box&quot;, where the animal could only escape and reach the food once it could operate the latch of the door. At first the cats would scratch and claw in order to find a way out, then by chance / accident, the cat would activate the latch to open the door. On successive trials, the behaviour of the animal would become more habitual, to a point where the animal would operate without hesitation. The occurrence of the favourable outcome, reaching the food source, only strengthens the response that it produces.

Colwill and Rescorla for example made all rats complete the goal of getting food pellets and liquid sucrose in consistent sessions on identical variable-interval schedules.

== Influence ==
The law of work for psychologist B. F. Skinner almost half a century later on the principles of operant conditioning, &quot;a learning process by which the effect, or consequence, of a response influences the future rate of production of that response.&quot; Skinner would later use an updated version of Thorndike&#x27;s puzzle box, called the operant chamber, or Skinner box, which has contributed immensely to our perception and understanding of the law of effect in modern society and how it relates to operant conditioning. It has allowed a researcher to study the behavior of small organisms in a controlled environment.

An example of Thorndike’s Law of Effect in a child’s behavior could be the child receiving praise and a star sticker for tidying up their toys. The positive reinforcement (praise and sticker) encourages the repetition of the behavior (cleaning up), illustrating the Law of Effect in action.

<doc id="1016863" wikidata="Q1266915" url="?curid=1016863" title="Perfusion">
<text>Perfusion is the passage of fluid through the circulatory system or lymphatic system to an organ or a tissue, usually referring to the delivery of blood to a capillary bed in tissue. Perfusion may also refer to fixation via perfusion, used in histological studies. Perfusion is measured as the rate at which blood is delivered to tissue, or volume of blood per unit time (blood flow) per unit tissue mass. The SI unit is m3/(s·kg), although for human organs perfusion is typically reported in ml/min/g. The word is derived from the French verb &quot;perfuser&quot;, meaning to &quot;pour over or through&quot;. All animal tissues require an adequate blood supply for health and life. Poor perfusion (malperfusion), that is, ischemia, causes health problems, as seen in cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, and many other conditions.

Tests verifying that adequate perfusion exists are a part of a patient&#x27;s assessment process that are performed by medical or emergency personnel. The most common methods include evaluating a body&#x27;s skin color, temperature, condition (dry/soft/firm/swollen/sunken/etc), and capillary refill.

During major surgery, especially cardiothoracic surgery, perfusion must be maintained and managed by the health professionals involved, rather than left to the body&#x27;s homeostasis alone. As the lead surgeons are often too busy to handle all hemodynamic control by themselves, specialists called perfusionists manage this aspect. There are more than one hundred thousand perfusion procedures annually.

==Discovery==
In 1920, August Krogh was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovering the mechanism of regulation of capillaries in skeletal muscle. Krogh was the first to describe the adaptation of blood perfusion in muscle and other organs according to demands through the opening and closing of arterioles and capillaries.

==Malperfusion==

Malperfusion can refer to any type of incorrect perfusion though it usually refers to hypoperfusion. The meaning of the terms &quot;overperfusion&quot; and &quot;underperfusion&quot; is relative to the average level of perfusion that exists across all the tissues in an individual body. Perfusion levels also differ from person to person depending on metabolic demand.

Examples follow:
* Heart tissues are considered overperfused because they normally are receiving more blood than the rest of tissues in the organism; they need this blood because they are constantly working.
* In the case of skin cells, extra blood flow in them is used for thermoregulation of a body. In addition to delivering oxygen, blood flow helps to dissipate heat in a body by redirecting warm blood closer to its surface where it can help to cool a body through sweating and thermal dissipation.
* Many types of tumors, and especially certain types, have been described as &quot;hot and bloody&quot; because of their overperfusion relative to the body overall.

Overperfusion and underperfusion should not be confused with hypoperfusion and hyperperfusion, which relate to the perfusion level relative to a tissue&#x27;s current need to meet its metabolic needs. For example, hypoperfusion can be caused when an artery or arteriole that supplies blood to a volume of tissue becomes blocked by an embolus, causing either no blood or at least not enough blood to reach the tissue. Hyperperfusion can be caused by inflammation, producing hyperemia of a body part. Malperfusion, also called poor perfusion, is any type of incorrect perfusion. There is no official or formal dividing line between hypoperfusion and ischemia; sometimes the latter term refers to zero perfusion, but often it refers to any hypoperfusion that is bad enough to cause necrosis.

==Measurement==
In equations, the symbol Q is sometimes used to represent perfusion when referring to cardiac output. However, this terminology can be a source of confusion since both cardiac output and the symbol Q refer to flow (volume per unit time, for example, L/min), whereas perfusion is measured as flow per unit tissue mass (mL/(min·g)).

===Microspheres===

Microspheres that are labeled with radioactive isotopes have been widely used to measure perfusion since the 1960s. Radioactively labeled particles are injected into the test subject and a radiation detector measures radioactivity in tissues of interest. Microspheres are used in radionuclide angiography, a method of diagnosing heart problems.

In the 1990s, methods for using fluorescent microspheres became a common substitute for radioactive particles.

===Nuclear medicine===

Perfusion of various tissues can be readily measured in vivo with nuclear medicine methods which are mainly positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Various radiopharmaceuticals targeted at specific organs are also available, some of the most common are:
* 99mTc labelled HMPAO and ECD for brain perfusion (rCBF) studied with SPECT
* 99mTc labelled Tetrofosmin and Sestamibi for myocardial perfusion imaging with SPECT
* 133Xe-gas for absolute quantification of brain perfusion (rCBF) with SPECT
* 15O-labeled water for brain perfusion (rCBF) with PET (absolute quantification is possible when measuring arterial radioactivity concentration)
* 82Rb-chloride for measuring myocardial perfusion with PET (absolute quantification is possible)

===Magnetic resonance imaging===

Two main categories of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques can be used to measure tissue perfusion in vivo.
* The first is based on the use of an injected contrast agent that changes the magnetic susceptibility of blood and thereby the MR signal which is repeatedly measured during bolus passage. 
* The other category is based on arterial spin labelling (ASL), where arterial blood is magnetically tagged before it enters into the tissue being examined and the amount of labelling that is measured and compared to a control recording obtained without spin labelling.

===Computed tomography (CT)===

Brain perfusion (more correctly transit times) can be estimated with contrast-enhanced computed tomography.

===Thermal diffusion===

Perfusion can be determined by measuring the total thermal diffusion and then separating it into thermal conductivity and perfusion components. rCBF is usually measured continuously in time. It is necessary to stop the measurement periodically to cool down and reassess the thermal conductivity.

<text>James George Abourezk ( ; February 24, 1931February 24, 2023) was an American attorney and politician from South Dakota. A member of the Democratic Party, he served in both chambers of the United States Congress for one term each; a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1973 and a member of the United States Senate from 1973 to 1979; he was the first Arab to serve in the United States Senate. In 1980, Abourezk founded the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) with the goal of counteracting anti-Arab racism in the country. He served in the United States Navy during the Korean War, but was also a critic of United States foreign policy in the Middle East, particularly with regard to the Arab–Israeli conflict. Under his leadership, the ADC became especially active following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent Gulf War, during which he became concerned about the rising rate of targeted hate crimes against Arabs and also against people mistaken for Arabs.

Abourezk represented South Dakota in the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1973 and in the United States Senate from 1973 to 1979. He was the author of the Indian Child Welfare Act, which was passed by the United States Congress in 1978 to help preserve the families and culture of Native Americans. As a federal law, it gives Native tribal governments exclusive jurisdiction over children who reside on or are domiciled on an Indian reservation; and it gives them concurrent, but presumptive jurisdiction over foster care placement proceedings for children who do not live on a Native reservation.

== Early life and education ==
James George Abourezk was born in Wood, South Dakota, to a family of Lebanese Greek Orthodox Christians. He was one of five children and both of his parents were immigrants from Lebanon: his mother Lena Abourezk; née Mickel) was a homemaker, and his father Charles Abourezk was an owner of two general stores. Growing up on the Rosebud Indian Reservation, he spoke only Arabic at home and did not learn English until he went to elementary school. At the age of 16, he was expelled from school for playing a prank on a teacher and left home to live with his brother Tom. He completed high school in 1948.

Between 1948 and 1952, Abourezk served in the United States Navy before and during the Korean War. Following 12 weeks of boot camp, he enrolled in Electricians&#x27; Mates School, after which he was sent to support Navy ships stationed in Japan.

Following military service, Abourezk worked on a ranch, in a casino, and as a judo instructor. For a time, he ran the Gay Lady Bar in Rockerville, South Dakota, where he employed future Governor of South Dakota Bill Janklow as a bartender. He earned a degree in civil engineering from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology in Rapid City, South Dakota in 1961, and worked as a civil engineer in California, before returning to South Dakota to work on the Minuteman silos being built as part of the new 44th Strategic Missile Wing at Ellsworth Air Force Base. At the age of 32, he decided to pursue law, and earned a Juris Doctor degree from University of South Dakota School of Law in Vermillion, South Dakota in 1966.

== Political career ==
Abourezk began a legal practice in Rapid City, South Dakota, and joined the Democratic Party. He ran in 1968 for Attorney General of South Dakota but was defeated by Gordon Mydland. In 1970, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives and served from 1971 to 1973, in the South Dakota&#x27;s 2nd Congressional district which was eliminated in 1983.

In 1972, Abourezk was elected to the U.S. Senate, where he served from 1973 to 1979, after which he chose not to seek a second term. He was the first chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. In 1974, &quot;TIME&quot; magazine named Senator Abourezk as one of the &quot;200 Faces for the Future&quot;.

=== Legislation ===
His legislative successes in the Senate included the 1975 Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, as well as the American Indian Religious Freedom Act.

His signature legislation was the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA, 1978), designed to protect Native American children and families from being torn apart. Native American children have been removed by state social agencies from their families and placed in foster care or adoption at a disproportionately high rate, and usually placed with non-Native American families. This both deprived the children of their culture and threatened the very survival of the tribes. This legislation was intended to provide a federal standard that emphasized the needs of Native American children to be raised in their own cultures, and gave precedence to tribal courts for decisions about children domiciled on the reservation, as well as concurrent but presumptive jurisdiction with state courts for Native American children off the reservation. He also authored and passed the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, which provided Indian tribes with greater autonomy. The BIA made grants to the tribes but they could manage contracts and funds to control their own destiny. That legislation also reduced the direct influence of the Bureau of Indian Affairs on the tribes.

As a senator, Abourezk condemned the Office of Public Safety (OPS), a Cold War-era program within the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which provided training to foreign police forces and was prone to human rights abuses. Abourezk introduced legislation that resulted in the banning of overseas police assistance in 1974, and the closure of the OPS in 1975.

=== Other initiatives ===
After taking office, Abourezk was approached almost daily by representatives of various sides of the conflict in the Middle East. In 1973, Abourezk was invited by the Lebanese embassy to visit Beirut. Later that year, he met with Arab leaders to discuss a possible peace settlement, and attempted to negotiate a truce contingent on Israel&#x27;s return of the Old City of Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, which was rejected by Israel. In 1976, Abourezk voted against the rest of the Senate on a measure to stop foreign aid to countries harboring international terrorists, arguing that there was no provision for terrorist acts committed by the Israeli military.

In 1973, Senators Abourezk and George McGovern attempted to end the Wounded Knee Occupation by negotiating with American Indian Movement leaders, who were in a standoff with federal law enforcement after demanding that the federal government honor its historical treaties with the Oglala Sioux nation. The summer after the occupation, Abourezk introduced the American Indian Policy Review Commission Act, which created the eleven-member commission, and served as its chairman until its landmark report was published in 1977. He took the gavel as chairman of the Select Committee on Indian Affairs from its creation in 1977 to 1979, when he left the Senate.

In 1976, Abourezk ordered the General Accounting Office carry out an investigation after doctor and lawyer Connie Redbird Pinkerman-Uri published a report suggesting that up to a quarter of Native American women had been involuntarily sterilised.

Abourezk was an early champion of more direct democracy through a National initiative process, similar to the state initiative process adopted by South Dakota in 1898. In July 1977, he co-sponsored a proposal for a constitutional amendment that would allow federal laws to be enacted through popular vote, together with fellow Senator Mark Hatfield (R-OR). Under the Abourezk resolution, voters could put legislation on the national election ballot if they secured signatures from three percent of voters in the previous presidential election. His efforts received national media coverage, and Abourezk chaired hearings and testified that the proposal was based on &quot;belief in the wisdom of the American people&quot;. Although the national initiative movement gained additional cosponsors in both the House and Senate in 1978, no further action was taken during the 95th Congress, after which interest waned.

In 1977, Senators Abourezk and McGovern went to Cuba with a group of basketball players from the University of South Dakota and South Dakota State who played against the Cuban national men&#x27;s basketball team.

In 1978, Abourezk chose not to run for re-election. He was succeeded in office by Republican Larry Pressler, with whom he had a long-running political feud.

=== Advocacy ===

After leaving the Senate, Abourezk served as legal counsel for the Islamic Republic of Iran in Washington, D.C., leading &quot;The New York Times&quot; to call him &quot;Iran&#x27;s Man in Washington&quot;. He defended the Islamic Republic in lawsuits seeking payment for contracts entered into by the former Shah&#x27;s government, and sought to recoup Iranian assets that were allegedly taken by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and his wife.

Senator Abourezk was outraged by the 1967 USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident and openly inquired about the circumstances of the attack: &quot;The shame of the U.S.S. &quot;Liberty&quot; incident is that our sailors were treated as though they were enemies, rather than the patriots and heroes that they were. There is no other incident--beyond Israeli attack on the U.S.S. &quot;Liberty&quot;--that shows the power of the Israeli Lobby by being able to silence successive American governments. Allowing the lies told by the Israelis and their minions in the U.S. is disheartening to all of us who are proud of our servicemen.&quot;In 1980, Abourezk founded the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, a grassroots civil rights organization. In 1989, he published his &quot;Advise and Dissent: Memoirs of South Dakota and the U.S. Senate&quot; (). He was the co-author, along with American Jewish Committee, of &quot;Through Different Eyes: Two Leading Americans — a Jew and an Arab — Debate U. S. Policy in the Middle East&quot; (1987), ().

In 2003, Abourezk sued the website Probush.com for defamation. He was later joined by Jane Fonda and Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz as plaintiffs, and settled the lawsuit with the Internet site in 2005.

In 2007, Abourezk gave an interview to the Hezbollah funded news channel Al-Manar. In this interview Abourezk said that he believed that Zionists used the terrorists that perpetrated the 9/11 terrorist attacks as a way to sow Islamophobia, that Zionists control the United States Congress, and that Hezbollah and Hamas are resistance fighters. He continued to criticize Israel in 2014, writing that &quot;ending the occupation... would end the rockets fired by Hamas.”

After his retirement from the Senate, Abourezk worked as a lawyer and writer in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. He continued to be active in supporting tribal sovereignty and culture. In July 2015 he spoke out against a suit filed against the ICWA by the Goldwater Institute; it was one of three suits seeking to overturn the act. Some states and adoption groups, who make money off adoptions, have opposed any prohibitions on their placements of Native American children. Abourezk considered this his signature legislation and the new rules instrumental in protecting Native American children and preserving tribal families. He noted that the late Senator Barry Goldwater, his friend and colleague, had voted for the legislation in 1977 and had often consulted with him in tribal matters.

HuffPost writer James Zogby in 2014 praised Abourezk as a &quot;bold and courageous former Senator&quot; for protesting to the Federal Bureau of Investigation after the Abscam operation.

=== Death ===
He died at home in Sioux Falls on February 24, 2023, on his 92nd birthday. His funeral was held on Sunday, May 28, 2023, at the Washington Pavilion of Arts and Science in downtown Sioux Falls.

== Personal life ==
Abourezk was married three times. His first marriage was to Mary Ann Houlton in 1952, which ended in divorce in 1981. They had three children. He subsequently married and divorced Margaret Bethea, before marrying Sanaa Dieb in 1991, with the couple remaining together until his death.

Abourezk was a Greek Orthodox Christian. He lived in South Dakota for most of his life.

<doc id="1016885" wikidata="Q1378197" url="?curid=1016885" title="European Terrestrial Reference System 1989">
<text>The European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89) is an ECEF (Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed) geodetic Cartesian reference frame, in which the Eurasian Plate as a whole is static. The coordinates and maps in Europe based on ETRS89 are not subject to change due to the continental drift. 

The development of ETRS89 is related to the global ITRS geodetic datum, in which the representation of the continental drift is balanced in such a way that the total apparent angular momentum of continental plates is about 0. ETRS89 was officially born at the 1990 Florence meeting of EUREF, following its Resolution 1, which recommends that the terrestrial reference system to be adopted by EUREF will be coincident with ITRS at the epoch 1989.0 and fixed to the stable part of the Eurasian Plate. According to the resolution, this system was named European Terrestrial Reference System 89 (ETRS89). Since then ETRS89 and ITRS diverge due to the continental drift at a speed about 2.5 cm per year. By the year 2000 the two coordinate systems differed by about 25 cm.

The 89 in its name does not refer to the year of solution (realization), but rather the year of initial definition, when ETRS89 was fully equivalent to ITRS. The solutions of ETRS89 correspond to the ITRS solutions. For each ITRS solution, a matching ETRS89 solution is being made. ETRF2000, for example, is an ETRS89 solution, which corresponds to ITRF2000. ETRS89 is realized by EUREF through the maintenance of the EUREF Permanent Network (EPN) and continuous processing of the EPN data in a few processing centres. Users have access to ETRS89 via EPN data products and real-time streams of differential corrections from a set of public providers based on the EPN stations. 
The transformation from ETRS89 to ITRS is time-dependent and was formulated by C. Boucher, Z. Altamimi, and X. Collilieux 

ETRS89 is the EU-recommended frame of reference for geodata for Europe. It is the only geodetic datum to be used for mapping and surveying purposes in Europe.
It plays the same role for Europe as NAD-83 for North America. (NAD-83 is a datum in which the North American Plate as a whole is static, and which is used for mapping and surveying in the US, Canada, and Mexico.) ETRS89 and NAD-83 are based on the GRS80 ellipsoid. WGS84 originally used the GRS80 reference ellipsoid, but has undergone some minor refinements in later editions since its initial publication.

<doc id="1016886" wikidata="Q1192552" url="?curid=1016886" title="The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Engineer&#x27;s Thumb,&quot; one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is the ninth of the twelve stories collected in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The story was first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in March 1892. Within the narrative of the story, Dr. Watson notes that this is one of only two cases which he personally brought to the attention of Sherlock Holmes.

==Plot==
In the summer of 1889, a young Londoner and consultant hydraulic engineer, Victor Hatherley, recounts the strange events that occurred to him the night before, initially to Dr. Watson and later to Sherlock Holmes.

Hatherley was visited by a man who identified himself as Colonel Lysander Stark and offered a confidential 50 guinea (£, ) commission to examine a hydraulic press at a country house in Eyford, Berkshire that Stark claimed was used to compress fuller&#x27;s earth into bricks. Despite his misgivings and doubts about the machine&#x27;s true purpose, Hatherley felt compelled to accept the offer, as his business was newly established and he had little work.

Upon arriving at an appointed train station, Hatherley was picked up by Stark in a carriage with frosted glass windows. They traveled what seemed to be a considerable distance. After they arrived at the house, a woman warned Hatherley to leave, but he didn&#x27;t. Stark and a man introduced as Ferguson took Hatherley to the hydraulic press. Hatherley made recommendations on how to fix it, but did not believe it was being used to compress fuller&#x27;s earth, as the engine was far too powerful for such a purpose. He confronted Stark, who then tried to kill him with the press. After the woman helped Hatherley escape, a murderous Stark pursued him with a cleaver, forcing Hatherley to jump from a second-storey window, losing his thumb to Stark in the process. Surviving the fall and landing within some rose bushes, Hatherley passed out and later awoke by a hedge near the train station.

Once Hatherley finishes his story, Holmes deduces that Stark and his allies are counterfeiters, their machine was used to create false half crowns, the carriage driver drove &quot;six [miles] out and six back&quot; to disguise the house&#x27;s location, and Stark&#x27;s group is responsible for the disappearance of another consultant hydraulic engineer a year prior. Holmes, Watson, and the police travel to the house Hatherley described, only to find it had been set ablaze after Hatherley&#x27;s lamp was crushed inside the press. Their operation ruined, the counterfeiters fled in the direction of Reading, Berkshire with several &quot;bulky boxes.&quot;

== Publication Info ==
&quot;The Adventure of the Engineer&#x27;s Thumb&quot; was first published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in March 1892, and in the United States in the US edition of the &quot;Strand&quot; in April 1892. The story was published with eight illustrations by Sidney Paget in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in October 1892.

== Adaptations ==
=== Film and television ===
A silent short film adaptation was released in 1923 as part of the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Holmes.

The story was adapted for an episode of the 1954–1955 television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Ronald Howard as Holmes and Howard Marion Crawford as Watson. The episode was titled &quot;The Case of the Shoeless Engineer&quot; and the story was altered so that Hatherley loses a shoe rather than his thumb, and Stark and his co-conspirator are captured by Lestrade with the assistance of Holmes.

The story was additionally adapted for the TMS Entertainment anime series &quot;Sherlock Hound&quot;, specifically in the episode &quot;A Small Client&quot; (1984). The general gist of the story was retained, but contained several differences, namely Professor Moriarty being in charge of the counterfeiting instead of Stark (who is not present in the episode at all), and the case being brought to Hound&#x27;s attention through the engineer&#x27;s young daughter instead of the engineer himself, who is being kept prisoner for the majority of the episode.

The story was also adapted in the 1986 Soviet TV movie &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson – The Twentieth Century Approaches&quot;. There, the criminal (Col. Stark) is Eduardo Lucas from &quot;The Adventure of the Second Stain&quot;, and the gang&#x27;s work is economic sabotage by the German Empire. Upon hearing the details, Mycroft Holmes decides to balance the damage by producing an equal amount of counterfeit German currency.

An episode of the animated television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century&quot; was based on the story. The episode, also titled &quot;The Adventure of the Engineer&#x27;s Thumb&quot;, aired in 2001.

=== Radio ===
Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which aired on 17 December 1931, starring Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Another episode adapted from the story aired on 24 February 1935 (with Louis Hector as Holmes and Lovell as Watson).

Edith Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that aired on 20 October 1940. Other episodes in the same series that were adapted from the story aired in June 1943 and January 1948 (with John Stanley as Holmes and Alfred Shirley as Watson).

A radio adaptation aired on the BBC Light Programme in 1960, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. It was adapted by Michael Hardwick.

&quot;The Engineer&#x27;s Thumb&quot; was dramatized by Peter Mackie for BBC Radio 4 in 1991, as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured John Moffatt as Lysander Stark.

The story was adapted as an episode of the radio series &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. The episode aired in 2015.

<text>Älvdalen ( or ; literally &quot;the river valley&quot;) is a locality and the seat of Älvdalen Municipality in Dalarna County, Sweden, with 1,810 inhabitants in 2010.

The parish is widely known for being the place of manufacturing, in 1839, of the 4-meter granite vase (called &quot;Älvdalen Vase&quot;), installed in the Summer Garden in Saint Petersburg (a gift from Charles XIV John of Sweden to Nicholas I of Russia).

Nearby is the Hykjebergets Nature Reserve, inaugurated by Prince Carl Philip and Princess Sofia in 2016.

==Language==

The indigenous language of Älvdalen is Elfdalian. Although it contains many innovations it still preserves various Old Norse traits that have ceased to exist in most other North Germanic languages. The main spoken language in modern times is a Dalecarlian dialect of Swedish, which also is the dominant language in the local administration.

==Climate==
Älvdalen has a subarctic climate influenced by its location near the furthest interior position on the Scandinavian Peninsula. As a result, seasonal swings are large and the general climate has strong resemblances to Skellefteå much further north at sea level. Being in a river valley, the area is also prone to temperature inversion and harsh freezing. Compared to Mora about to its southeast, temperature differences are comparatively large since Mora is lower, further south and situated by the slightly moderating lake of Siljan.

<doc id="1016892" wikidata="Q1328970" url="?curid=1016892" title="Red Hat Society">
<text>The Red Hat Society (RHS) is an international social organization that was founded in 1998 in the United States for women age 50 and beyond, but now open to women of all ages.

==History==
In the fall of 1997, Sue Ellen Cooper, an artist from Fullerton, California, bought a red hat on a trip to Tucson, Arizona. Cooper then bought another red hat and gave it to a friend as a birthday gift. Cooper was inspired by the Jenny Joseph poem, &quot;Warning&quot;, which was popularized by a &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; article written by Liz Carpenter. The poem begins: “When I am an old woman, I shall wear purple, with a red hat which doesn&#x27;t go and doesn&#x27;t suit me.” Cooper wanted to encourage her friend to grow older in a playful manner. Cooper repeated the gift to several other friends upon request, and eventually several of the women bought purple outfits and held a tea party on April 25, 1998, at which the Red Hat Society began.

The society first gained national attention through an article written by journalist Lori Basheda for &quot;The Orange County Register,&quot; which was reprinted in newspapers across the country.

Cooper facilitated the growth of the organization and now serves as &quot;Exalted Queen Mother&quot; of the organization. She has written two books about the society: &quot;The Red Hat Society: Friendship and Fun After Fifty&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Red Hat Society&#x27;s Laugh Lines: Stories of Inspiration and Hattitude&quot; (2005).

As of 2020, Red Hat Society membership has more than 35,000 members internationally.

==Organization==
A founder or leader of a local chapter is usually referred to as a &quot;Queen&quot;. Members 50 and over are called &quot;Red Hatters&quot; and wear red hats and purple attire to all functions. A woman under age 50 may also become a member, but she wears a pink hat and lavender attire to the society&#x27;s events until reaching her 50th birthday. She is referred to as a “Pink Hatter.” During her birthday month (or the society&#x27;s birthday month of April), a member might wear her colors in reverse, i.e., a purple or lavender hat and red or pink attire.

==Activities==
Both Red and Pink Hatters often wear very elaborately decorated hats and attention-getting fashion accessories, such as a feather boa, at the group&#x27;s get-togethers.

The society&#x27;s events vary depending on the chapter, but common activities among Red Hatters include hosting tea parties, playing games, and going to movies or theater events.

==Worldwide membership==
The Red Hat Society has spread to other countries in the world. As of 2011, besides the thousands of chapters in the U.S., there were local chapters of the Society in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Canada, Ecuador, England, Finland, Germany, Greece, Guam, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, Namibia, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, Scotland, South Africa, Sweden, Taiwan, Trinidad and Tobago, and Wales.

<doc id="1016897" wikidata="Q7980910" url="?curid=1016897" title="Weldon Kees">
<text>Harry Weldon Kees (February 24, 1914 – disappeared July 18, 1955) was an American poet, librarian, painter, literary critic, novelist, playwright, jazz pianist, short story writer, and filmmaker. Despite his brief career, Kees is considered an important mid-twentieth-century poet of the Beat generation, and peer of John Berryman, Elizabeth Bishop, and Robert Lowell. His work has been immensely influential on subsequent generations of poets writing in English and other languages and his collected poems have been included in many anthologies. Harold Bloom lists the publication of Kees&#x27;s first book &quot;The Last Man&quot; (1943) as an important event in the chronology of his textbook &quot;Modern American Poetry&quot; as well as a book worthy of his Western Canon.

== Early life and education ==
Weldon Kees was born in Beatrice, Nebraska, to John Kees, a hardware manufacturer, and Sarah Green Kees, a schoolteacher. The Kees family was well-to-do, John being part owner of F.D. Kees Manufacturing Co., which patented and produced corn-husking hooks as well as innovative products such as a window defroster for automobiles and a moving lawn sprinkler that resembled a farm tractor. Weldon was a precocious child whose playmates included Robert Taylor and whose pastimes included producing his own magazines, giving puppet shows and even acting. He was treated like a small adult by his parents, whom he addressed by their first names.

Kees&#x27;s worldview and writing were shaped by the Jazz Age and his early adulthood during the Great Depression. By the time he graduated from high school in 1931, he rejected entering the family business and, while at Doane College, decided to become a novelist. He transferred to the University of Missouri, which had a writing program, and then to the University of Nebraska, where he was mentored by the founding editor of the literary journal &quot;Prairie Schooner&quot;, Lowery C. Wimberley. By the time Kees graduated in 1935, he had already written and published short stories in that journal as well as other literary magazines such as &quot;Horizon&quot; and &quot;Rocky Mountain Review&quot;.

While working for the Federal Writers&#x27; Project in Lincoln, Nebraska, and after having suffered the rejection of several novels, Kees turned to writing poetry—and, for a time, engaged in union organizing and considered himself a communist. In 1937, Kees moved to Colorado to earn a degree in library science at the University of Denver, which included working as a librarian at the Denver Public Library.

== Career ==
He then became director of the Bibliographical Center of Research for the Rocky Mountain Region, which was used as a model for a national union catalog. That same year, he married Ann Swan.

In early 1941, Kees signed a provisional contract with Alfred A. Knopf for a novel, &quot;Fall Quarter&quot;, an academic black comedy about a young professor who battles the dreariness and banality of a staid Nebraskan college. &quot;Fall Quarter&quot;, part surreal, part social commentary, was rejected by Knopf in the days after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the declaration of war having changed publishing contingencies for war books. A farce about a dystopic heartland would look unpatriotic on Knopf&#x27;s 1942 list. From this point on, Kees turned from fiction to writing only poetry.

===New York and Provincetown===
A pacifist, Kees left Denver for New York City, where he believed Selective Service psychiatrists were more likely to declare him unfit for military duty. He had also, during previous visits, made contacts with literary figures such as William Carlos Williams, Edmund Wilson and his then wife Mary McCarthy, Saul Bellow, Dwight Macdonald, Allen Tate, Lionel Trilling, and many others. It was during his first year in New York that he worked as a book and film critic for &quot;Time&quot; and as newsreel scriptwriter for Paramount News.

With his first book of poems, &quot;The Last Man&quot; (San Francisco: Colt Press, 1943), Kees quickly established his reputation and his poems began to appear regularly in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; (which published his first Robinson persona poems, which pathologize the urban man), &quot;Poetry,&quot; and &quot;The Partisan Review&quot;. By the time his second book appeared, &quot;The Fall of Magicians&quot; (New York: Reynal &amp; Hitchcock, 1947), Kees had already been painting for more than a year and had befriended Abstract Expressionism artists, including Willem de Kooning, Robert Motherwell, Hans Hofmann, as well as the critic Clement Greenberg—whose column Kees took over at &quot;The Nation&quot; from 1948 to 1950.

In 1948, Weldon and Ann Kees began summering at the artist colony at Provincetown, Massachusetts on Cape Cod. In the autumn of that year, Kees had his first one-man show at the Peridot Gallery and one of his paintings was included in a group show of established and rising artists at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Despite these initial successes, Kees&#x27;s work had very modest sales.

During the summer of 1949, Kees established a cultural symposium series at Provincetown (&quot;Forum 49&quot;). He also became involved with the so-called the Irascibles, a group of controversial artists led by Robert Motherwell and other prominent Abstract Expressionists who boycotted a modern art exhibit sponsored by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Kees, though quite active in protesting the conservative jury&#x27;s selection in his &quot;Nation&quot; column, became estranged with both the cultural scene in New York and many of its figures. Although invited to pose in &quot;Life&quot; magazine&#x27;s famous group photo of the Irascible 18, Kees and his wife Ann had already driven cross-country to San Francisco in late 1950.

===San Francisco Renaissance and disappearance===

Renting an apartment in nearby Point Richmond, California, Kees took a job at the Langley Porter Psychiatric Clinic at the University of California, San Francisco, where he worked alongside the anthropologist Gregory Bateson making data films for a study of nonverbal communication. Kees also continued to paint and write poems—and use his film camera to make experimental movies, as well as scoring a film, &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy&quot; (1951), directed by the poet and filmmaker James Broughton.

From 1951 to 1954, Kees also made many new contacts as well as renewed old ones in the San Francisco Renaissance, among them Kenneth Rexroth and the founder of City Lights Bookstore, Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Kees&#x27;s poetry, however, did not embrace the kind dionysiac character and became increasingly sardonic and confessional in poems such as &quot;1926.&quot;

Restless and often estranged from his poetry, Kees began to collaborate with the jazz clarinetist Bob Helm in 1953 on ballads and torch songs (some written for the singer Ketty Lester). Helm had played with Lu Watters and Turk Murphy, both prominent figures in the San Francisco&#x27;s New Orleans Revival Movement, which Kees preferred over Bebop.

Despite how much energy he put into this venture, which he hoped would bring him some commercial success, Kees found time to produce a fine series of collages. He even had two more one-man shows in New York as well as shows in San Francisco, including an impressive installation at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor. He had also exchanged his film camera for a still camera, and began taking the photographs that would illustrate the book &quot;Nonverbal Communication&quot; (Berkeley:, University of California Press, 1956), which he wrote with Jurgen Ruesch, psychiatrist and semiotician. Many of these photographs would qualify as art photography as well as scientific data.

In 1954, Kees separated from his wife Ann, whose alcoholism led to a psychotic episode triggered by watching the Army–McCarthy hearings on television. After having her institutionalized, Kees divorced her around the time that his last book appeared, &quot;Poems, 1947–1954&quot; (San Francisco, Adrian Wilson, 1954). He then focused on organizing a musical revue, &quot;Pick Up the Pieces&quot;, which eventually became a much more elaborate venue of literary burlesque, titled &quot;Poets Follies&quot;, which premiered in January 1955 and featured a stripper reading the poetry of Sarah Teasdale .

Although &quot;Poets Follies&quot; earned Kees much notoriety, his other projects did not find the same kind of support. A film company ended in a lawsuit. His collaborations with Helm, Lester, and other musicians, although professionally satisfying, did not produce any hit records. A permanent home for the &quot;Poets Follies&quot;, the Showplace, a large building Kees leased on Folsom Street in the Mission District, was closed by the fire marshal in late May 1955, just days before the premiere of a serious one-act play, &quot;The Waiting Room&quot;, which Kees had written for three actress friends.

During much of July, Kees spent time with a woman he had met while working at Langley Porter, a Jungian psychiatrist named Virginia Patterson. Like other relationships Kees had following his divorce, this ended abruptly. Kees had also been taking barbiturates for the past two years, which also had intensified his episodes of manic depression.

After visiting his parents in Santa Barbara, California one last time in early July, as well as his friend, the literary critic Hugh Kenner, Kees returned to San Francisco and had dinner with various friends, including Pauline Kael, who appeared as a guest on Kees&#x27;s film review program on KPFA-FM, &quot;Behind the Movie Camera&quot;. She noticed the disturbing changes in Kees&#x27;s demeanor. For several days in mid-July, Kees drank and commiserated with his friend and business partner, the San Francisco newspaperman and novelist Michael Grieg. He even confessed to have tried jumping over the rail of the Golden Gate Bridge, but he could not physically manage it. He talked of going to Mexico as an alternative, a country that fascinated him in books such as Malcolm Lowry&#x27;s &quot;Under the Volcano&quot;.

Kees returned to his home in the Marina District on the evening of July 17, 1955. What he did the following day is a mystery. He took a call from Grieg, who told Kees of a possible job offer. Kees also telephoned a friend, the memoirist Janet Richards, seeking her company. On July 19, 1955, Kees&#x27;s car was found deserted on the Marin County side of the Golden Gate Bridge.

===Reputation and resurgence===

The reputation of Weldon Kees has seen as much neglect as it has keen attention. Weeks before his disappearance, a young poet in Florida, Donald Justice, attempted to write Kees a letter of admiration and to send him a sestina he had written since Kees excelled in that form. His letter found its way to Kees&#x27;s father, John, who eventually gave Justice permission to compile and edit &quot;The Collected Poems of Weldon Kees&quot; (Iowa City, IA: The Stone Wall Press, 1960), which was subsequently released as a trade paperback in the 1960s. Kees&#x27;s work attracted the attention of other younger poets and his work gradually became anthologized and received critical attention.

During the 1980s and 1990s, a volume of Kees&#x27;s correspondence appeared, &quot;Weldon Kees and the Midcentury Generation: Letters, 1935–1955&quot; (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1986) and the poets Dana Gioia and James Reidel reclaimed and drew attention to Kees&#x27;s fiction, nonfiction, and visual art. Gioia edited &quot;The Ceremony and other stories&quot; (Port Townsend, WA: Graywolf Press, 1984) and Reidel edited selection of Kees&#x27;s critical writings in &quot;Reviews and Essays: 1936-1955&quot; (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1988) and the novel &quot;Fall Quarter&quot; (Brownsville, OR: Story Line Press, 1990). Reidel eventually produced a biography of Kees, &quot;Vanished Act: The Life and Art of Weldon Kees&quot; (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2003). Books and articles about Kees continue to appear. His paintings and collages have also been shown in two major retrospectives.

Kees has attracted admirers who have commented at length about his poetry. The late Joseph Brodsky, as poet laureate for the Library of Congress, wrote this appraisal:

His poems display neither the incoherence of nostalgia for some mentally palatable past nor, however vaguely charted, the possibility of the future. All he had was the present, which was not to his Muse&#x27;s liking, and eventually not to his own either. His poetry, in other words, is that of the here and now and of no escape, except for poetry itself. Yet for all he had to say about the present, his language is amazingly clear and direct, and the formal aspects of his verse are amazingly conservative. Evidently, Kees did not feel the imperative of arrythmia so palpable among his less memorable peers, not to mention successors.

The literary critic and biographer Ian Hamilton made a special of Kees&#x27;s existential problem with writing and fame, quoting one of Kees&#x27;s illustrious friends from his New York period:

According to Alfred Kazin, Weldon Kees&#x27;s ambition as a poet knew no bounds. He &quot;desperately wanted to be famous&quot;, says Kazin, &quot;to be &#x27;up there&#x27;, as he used to say, with Eliot, Pound and other stars in our firmament&quot;. This being so, one has to wonder why Weldon was not more of a hustler on his own behalf. So far as we know, he seems to have done very little in the way of careerist self-advancement—although, to judge from photographs, he was by no means short of vanity. Arrogant, embittered and melancholic, he waited for acclaim to come to him, but none of the three books he published in his lifetime made much of a mark. (One commentator has estimated that Kees sold a total of 1,000 copies of his works before he disappeared.)

Anthony Lane, the film critic of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, has also written in kind about Kees&#x27;s enduring body of work, especially in regard to the Robinson poems:

It is that single word &quot;usual&quot; that brings you up short and lets the poem fan out. It points not just to the regularity of Robinson&#x27;s own days and years but to the engulfing possibility of a thousand Robinsons out there, in the subway and on the streets, all ticking their lives away like his soundless watch. The poem, entitled &quot;Aspects of Robinson,&quot; is the portrait of the postwar man of affairs: neither laborer nor magnate, but holding steady—and, at first blush, looking purposeful—within the middle rank. He is everything that Weldon Kees dreaded, as well as everything that he suspected he ought to be.

On October 23, 2012, Kathleen Rooney&#x27;s novel-in-poems &quot;Robinson Alone&quot; was released, of which Donna Seaman from &quot;Booklist&quot; wrote:

In an extraordinary act of identification, poet and essayist Rooney improvises on Kees&#x27; most haunting poems, a quartet featuring an alter ego named Robinson. Her loosely biographical, knowledgeably imaginative, and gorgeously atmospheric story in verse portrays Robinson as a dapper, talented, and bedeviled man who conceals his sorrows behind insouciance. Rooney weaves lines from Kees&#x27; writings into her bluesy, funny, and scorching lyrics as she follows Robinson from elation to desolation as his wife succumbs to alcoholism and his dreams fade. Rooney&#x27;s syncopated wordplay, supple musicality, and cinematic descriptions subtly embody Kees&#x27; artistic pursuits as well as Robinson&#x27;s sardonic grace under pressure. An intricate, psychologically luminous homage, tale of American loneliness, and enthralling testament to poetry&#x27;s resonance.

<text>The Master of Management (MM, MiM, MMgt) is a master&#x27;s degree comprising one or two years graduate level coursework in business management. 

In terms of content, it is similar to the Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree as it contains identical management courses but is open to prospective postgraduate candidates at any level in their career unlike MBA programs that have longer course credit requirements and only accept mid-career professionals. In many cases it is synonymous with the Master of Science in Management (MSM or MiM) and is also related to the Master of Science in Commerce (MS-Comm or MS-Com).

As the program is designed for students interested in entering leadership roles, the degree attracts applicants from diverse academic disciplines. 

A global survey of business schools offering MIM programs shows a robust growth in applications in times of global recession triggered by COVID-19. This growth in applications shows the demand for pre-experience programs among domestic and international candidates preparing for management careers.

The mode of delivery of the program can be full-time, part-time, distance-learning, accelerated, or executive.

The MM program for younger professionals with limited professional experience often resembles an MBA program. It typically prepares students to handle management issues in all areas of business, with the option to concentrate or specialize in one area. Most programs begin with a set of required courses and then offer more specialized courses two thirds of the way through the program. Topics in the MM program often accounting, finance, business administration, international business, marketing management, supply chain management, human resources, nonprofit management, and entrepreneurship.

The MM program for senior professionals with managerial experience (typically 10+ years) often resembles an Executive MBA (EMBA) program. It typically prepares students to handle the tasks associated with interdisciplinary business-related subjects such as ethical decision making, business law, global business values, workplace security, corporate crime, and employee motivation. 

==Admissions==
Business school admission committees normally evaluate applicants based on GPA score (and graduate GPA if applicable), resumes, letters of recommendation, essays, and personal interviews. Based on these indicators, a committee decides if the applicant is suitable for the academic profile of the program, can demonstrate considerable leadership potential, and contribute positively to the student body of the school as a whole.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor&quot;, one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is the tenth of the twelve stories collected in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The story was first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in April 1892.

==Plot==
Lord Robert St. Simon comes to Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson for help after his bride, Hatty Doran, disappeared during their wedding reception. He explains that sometime prior, Hatty traveled from San Francisco, eager to marry him. However, she became uncharacteristically sharp with him following the wedding, during which she had dropped her bouquet and a gentleman in the front row returned it to her. During the post-wedding breakfast at St. Simon&#x27;s father-in-law&#x27;s home, Hatty spoke with her maid before claiming &quot;a sudden indisposition&quot; and retired to her room. Not long after, she is discovered to have disappeared. Additionally, her wedding dress and ring were found washed ashore at the Serpentine, leading Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard to drag the river for Hatty&#x27;s body.

Despite Lestrade and Watson&#x27;s confusion, Holmes easily deduces what happened, having dealt with similar cases before. Upon locating Hatty, he forces her to reveal to St. Simon that the mystery man, Francis H. Moulton, was her previous husband. Years prior, following their own wedding, Moulton had left to become a prospector. After he was reported killed following an Apache raid on the mining camp he worked at, Hatty assumed it was true and eventually met St. Simon even though she was still in love with Moulton. Meanwhile, Moulton was captured by the Apache, but escaped and followed Hatty to London to reunite with her. She recognised him instantly, though he gestured her to stay silent to avoid causing a scandal and secretly passed a note to her while returning her bouquet. She subsequently faked her death to be with Moulton again. Holmes convinces Hatty to be more honest and apologize to St. Simon. However, he refuses to accept, feeling that he had been ill used.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor&quot; was first published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in April 1892, and in the United States in the US edition of the &quot;Strand&quot; in May 1892. The story was published with eight illustrations by Sidney Paget in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in October 1892.

==Adaptations==

===Film and television===

The story was adapted as a silent short film released in 1921 as part of the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Holmes.

The Granada &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; television series adapted the story in 1993 as a feature-length television film entitled &quot;The Eligible Bachelor&quot;. The film makes significant changes and the inclusion of elements from other parts of the Holmes canon. It features Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, Edward Hardwicke as Dr. Watson and Simon Williams as Robert, Lord St. Simon.

The 2018 HBO Asia/Hulu Japan series &quot;Miss Sherlock&quot; loosely adapts this story as the episode &quot;The Missing Bride.&quot; In this version, the solution to the original story is revealed to be a red herring, and the bride&#x27;s true motive for disappearing is quite different.

===Radio and audio dramas===

Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode, titled &quot;The Noble Bachelor&quot;, aired on 22 December 1930, starring Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. A repeat broadcast of the episode aired in 1933, and a remake aired in July 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson).

Edith Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that aired on 13 October 1940. A 1943 episode titled &quot;A Sword That Beheaded Three Queens&quot; was referred to by some newspapers as &quot;The Noble Bachelor&#x27;s Second Wedding&quot;, which may indicate that the episode was inspired by &quot;The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor&quot;.

A radio adaptation of the story aired on the BBC Light Programme in 1959, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. It was adapted by Michael Hardwick.

&quot;The Noble Bachelor&quot; was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1991 by Bert Coules, as an episode of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Donald Gee as Inspector Lestrade.

The story was adapted as an episode of the radio series &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. The episode aired in 2015.

In 2023, the podcast Sherlock&amp;Co adapted the story in a two-episodes adventure called &quot;The Noble Bachelor&quot;, starring Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

<doc id="1016930" wikidata="Q1201796" url="?curid=1016930" title="The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet&quot;, one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is the eleventh of the twelve stories collected in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The story was first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in May 1892.

==Plot==

A Streatham banker named Mr Alexander Holder makes a loan of £50,000 (equivalent to approximately £ in ) to a client from one of the &quot;highest, noblest, most exalted names in England,&quot; implied to be a member of the British Royal Family and, thus, a son of Queen Victoria and an heir to the throne. The client leaves the beryl coronet, described as one of the &quot;most precious public possessions of the empire,&quot; as collateral. Feeling his bank&#x27;s personal safe is insufficient to protect such a rare and valuable piece of jewellery, he takes it home and keeps it in his dressing room. However, he and his niece Mary later find his son Arthur holding the coronet, seemingly trying to bend it, with three beryls missing from it. A panicked Holder seeks out Sherlock Holmes for help.

Despite the damning evidence against Arthur, who refuses to give a statement, Holmes is unconvinced. With the threat of Holder&#x27;s reputation being besmirched and a national scandal weighing heavily on his mind, Holmes determines Arthur could not have broken the coronet on his own without making noise, notices footprints in the snow outside Holder&#x27;s home, and considers Holder&#x27;s servants, Mary, and Arthur&#x27;s rakish friend Sir George Burnwell as potential suspects.

Eventually, Holmes concludes Burnwell is a notorious criminal who conspired with Mary, unaware of his real identity, to steal the coronet. Arthur caught the pair in the act and broke the coronet while trying to take it back from Burnwell before taking the blame for Mary out of love for her. Though Burnwell and Mary escape justice, Holmes is convinced they will receive their punishment in due time. He later buys back the missing beryls from a fence that Burnwell sold them to, receives compensation from Holder, and tells him to apologize to Arthur for assuming he was the thief.

==Publication history==

<doc id="1016932" wikidata="Q25457" url="?curid=1016932" title="Karlstad">
<text>Karlstad (, ) is the 20th-largest city in Sweden, the seat of Karlstad Municipality, the capital of Värmland County, and the largest city in the province Värmland in Sweden. The city proper had 67,122 inhabitants in 2020 with 97,233 inhabitants in the wider municipality in 2023, and is the 21st biggest municipality in Sweden. Karlstad has a university and a cathedral.

During recent years, Karlstad has started seeing big growth with many new buildings, for example the new apartment complexes around Orrholmen and Tullholmen, hosting a brand new Coop store and a 17 story high rise apartment which was finished in late 2022. 

Karlstad is built on the river delta where Sweden&#x27;s longest river, Klarälven, runs into Sweden&#x27;s largest lake, Vänern. It has the second largest lake port in the country after Västerås.

Karlstad is often associated with sunshine and the symbol for Karlstad is a smiling sun. Karlstad is reputed to be one of the sunniest towns in Sweden and a local waitress, known as &quot;Sola i Karlstad&quot; (&quot;the Sun in Karlstad&quot;) for her sunny disposition, is also commemorated with a statue.

==History==
On Karlstad&#x27;s largest islet, there was a place of counsel called Tingvalla in the medieval age, which had roots from the Viking Age before 1000 AD. It was also used as a market place.Karlstad was granted its city charter on March 5, 1584, by the Swedish Duke Charles, who would later be crowned King Charles IX of Sweden. The city derives its name from the King – Karlstad literally means &quot;Charles&#x27; city&quot;. The Duke also granted Karlstad the right as a governmental seat in the region, and gave it a substantial amount of land.

The Duke built his own house in the city, which is referred to as &quot;Kungsgården&quot; (&quot;The King&#x27;s Manor&quot;). Karlstad&#x27;s Cathedral was built on the location Kungsgården in 1724–1730 by Christian Haller.

Then most significant coup d&#x27;état in modern Swedish history had its beginning in Karlstad. During the night of 7 March 1809, major general Georg Adlersparre used the part of the western army that was stationed in Värmland to occupy Karlstad. From there officially proclaimed a revolution, and during 9 March, he and his soldiers began their march toward the capital to end the reign of king Gustav IV Adolf.

Karlstad has suffered four major fires. Only the cathedral and a few houses remained after the last fire on July 2, 1865. Karlstad was thereafter rebuilt according to a grid pattern with wide streets surrounded by trees.

In 1905, the agreement to dissolve the union between Norway and Sweden was negotiated and signed in Karlstad.

== Demographics ==
===Language===
The official language, Swedish, is the native language of a large majority and also spoken by most people in Karlstad. Immigration has also established five notable minority languages:
* Arabic
* Somali
* Sorani
* Persian
* Serbo-Croatian; Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian (in practice treated as one language).

===Religion===

Karlstad has several Christian denominations, including the Church of Sweden, with notable churches such as the Karlstad Cathedral built in 1730. In the 1800s, a small Jewish community formed in Karlstad and built a synagogue in 1899, which was demolished in 1961.

===Education===
Several upper secondary schools (gymnasium) offer the most common range of courses usually available throughout Sweden, including the IB Diploma Programme. The majority of students in Värmland need to commute or move to Karlstad for their upper secondary education. Tertiary education is offered by Karlstad University, which was granted university status in 1999.

==Media==

Värmlands Folkblad and Nya Wermlands-Tidningen are both located in Karlstad, with county-wide circulations.

==Sports and recreation==
===Winter sports===

Ice hockey is a highly popular spectator sport in Karlstad. The most popular club is Färjestad BK. The team plays in the &quot;Swedish Hockey League&quot; (SHL, highest level) and their home arena is Löfbergs Arena. The club has won the Swedish Championship several times, most recently in 2022, and is the most successful ice hockey club in Sweden since the foundation of Elitserien (Swedish Hockey League since 2013) in 1975. Several other ice hockey clubs exist and Karlstad is also represented in the 1st Division of ice hockey (3rd highest level) by the team Skåre BK. The 2010 Men&#x27;s World Inline Hockey Championships was also hosted by Karlstad, with Löfbergs Arena as the primary site of the tournament.

Traditionally, bandy has been the most popular winter sport in Karlstad, and the city is the home of two of the historically most successful clubs in Sweden, IF Boltic and IF Karlstad-Göta. Boltic reached 10 Swedish finals in a row from 1979 to 1988. They won the first 7 and the one in 1988. They also won in 1995. In 2000, the two clubs merged into BS BolticGöta. The first team again played as IF Boltic since the winter 2008/2009. After a successful season in &quot;Allsvenskan&quot; 2009/2010 the team qualified for &quot;Elitserien&quot;, but was again relegated for the 2011/2012 season. Boltic&#x27;s general meeting decided in 2014 to take back the club&#x27;s old name IF Boltic. And Karlstad-Göta does not have a bandy team anymore. The home arena of Boltic, Tingvalla Ice Stadium, built in 1967, was claimed to be one of Northern Europe&#x27;s largest artificially frozen areas. The outdoor stadium was demolished in 2020 and converted into an indoor rink, inaugurated in 2022. While one of many indoor bandy arenas, it is Sweden&#x27;s only indoor speed skating arena. Afghans living in Karlstad has taken a liking to bandy and set up an Afghanistan national bandy team, which is based in the city.

Karlstad is a regular host of start, finish and special stages for the Swedish Rally. The competition has world championship status and is held annually in Värmland. 

===Summer sports===

Several football clubs exist. QBIK was founded in 1978, and entered the premier division of women&#x27;s football, &quot;Damallsvenskan&quot;, in 2005. The team currently plays in the 1st Division (2nd highest level), but has several players in the Swedish national team. Their home ground is Tingvalla IP, and the facility was also the home ground for the football team Karlstad BK, that played in the men&#x27;s Division 1 Norra (3rd highest level), having gained promotion following a successful 2010 season. The third highest-ranking football team was Carlstad United. The club was founded in 1998 by an alliance of seven local football clubs, with the aim of providing Karlstad with an elite football team. The club was accepted by the Swedish Football Association (SvFF) in 1999 and the team played in the men&#x27;s Division 2 Norra Götaland (4th highest level). Carlstad United and Karlstad BK ended up merging into IF Karlstad Fotboll, who compete in Division 1 Norra. Another club from Karlstad is FBK Karlstad, who currently play in Division 1.

Motorcycle speedway takes place at the Kalvholmen Motorbana, situated in the southeast outskirts of the city. The team is called Solkatterna (the Sun Cats), who compete in the Swedish Speedway Team Championship.

American football is also played on Tingvalla IP. The Carlstad Crusaders play in &quot;Superserien&quot;, the highest level and since the founding of the club in 1990, the team has attended eight finals, winning its first championship in 2010.

Karlstad is also famous for athletics. The club IF Göta has a number of international athletes and host the annual athletics meet Götagalan. There is an outdoor athletics track at Tingvalla IP and an indoor track (200 m) in Våxnäshallen.

Another prominent sports club in Karlstad is OK Tyr, one of the largest orienteering clubs in Sweden. OK Tyr won Tiomila in 1989 and 1990.

<text>Sully-sur-Loire (, literally &quot;Sully on Loire&quot;) is a commune in the Loiret department, north-central France. It is the seat of the canton of Sully-sur-Loire. It lies on the left bank of the river Loire.

==Population==
==Castles==

The &quot;château&quot; of Sully-sur-Loire dates from the end of the 14th century and is a prime example of a medieval fortress. It was built at a strategic crossing of the Loire river. The &quot;château&quot; was expanded by Maximilien de Béthune, first duke of Sully and prime minister of King Henry IV of France (1560–1641), who is buried on the grounds of his &quot;château&quot;. The family of the dukes of Sully retained ownership of the &quot;château&quot; until the 20th century.

King Louis XIV, his mother Queen Anne of Austria and prime minister Cardinal Mazarin sought refuge in the &quot;château&quot; of Sully-sur-Loire in March 1652 after they were driven out of Paris during the revolt of the French nobility known as the &quot;Fronde&quot;.

The series was created by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor.

The first six series were written by Grant and Naylor, while Series VII and VIII were written by Naylor with collaborations from other writers, and Series IX to XII and the 2020 special &quot;The Promised Land&quot; were written by Naylor alone. Series I and II were produced by Paul Jackson Productions (with Grant Naylor Productions taking over from Series III) for BBC North, and broadcast on BBC2. &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; first aired on 15 February 1988 and ended its original run on BBC2, by then rebranded BBC Two, on 5 April 1999 after eight series, with some PBS stations in the United States airing the entire eighth series earlier on 7 March. From 2009, Grant Naylor Productions produced new episodes for UKTV, which were broadcast on the TV channel Dave.

The series follows the fortunes of Dave Lister who is stranded three million years in the future, together with the hologrammatic representation of his former bunkmate and immediate superior Arnold Rimmer; a creature known only as Cat; and the ship&#x27;s computer Holly. During Series II, the crew encounter a mechanoid called Kryten, who joins them from Series III onwards. In Series VI the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; ship has been stolen from the crew, forcing them to travel in the smaller &quot;Starbug&quot; craft for two series. In Series VII Kristine Kochanski, Lister&#x27;s former love interest, joins the crew, following the departure of Rimmer. In series VIII the entire crew of the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; ship—including a pre-accident Rimmer—are resurrected, but the &quot;Starbug&quot; crew, along with Rimmer, find themselves sentenced to two years in the ship&#x27;s brig for &quot;abusing classified information&quot;. Series IX (&quot;Red Dwarf: Back to Earth&quot;) involves Lister, Rimmer (back as a hologram), Cat, and Kryten hallucinating that they&#x27;ve arrived on Earth in another dimension in the early 21st century, and Series X to XII sees the same four crew members continue their adventures back on &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, Kochanski having departed due to Lister&#x27;s descent into depression and Holly offline due to water damage. A back-up of Holly is installed in &quot;The Promised Land&quot;.

==Episodes==

===&quot;Red Dwarf I&quot; (1988)===
The pilot script was written in 1983; the writing duo team of Grant and Naylor handed the finished script to their agent Paul Jackson who had trouble convincing the BBC to take on the series. Three years after the initial rejections, the script was accepted by BBC North West. The series almost did not happen due to an electricians&#x27; strike at the BBC in 1987 which prevented filming and thus the project was shelved. Filming eventually went ahead after the industrial action was resolved. A remastered version of this series was produced and broadcast in some countries.

===&quot;Red Dwarf II&quot; (1988)===
Realising that they were limited with stories based on the huge, but empty, mining ship of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, writers Grant and Naylor decided to go in a different direction for Series II. A small shuttle ship, &quot;Blue Midget&quot;, was designed to ferry the crew to and from different locations. The mechanoid, Kryten, appeared in the first episode as a one off. The writers had resisted using robot characters as they had considered the practice a sci-fi cliché. A remastered version of this series was produced and broadcast in some countries.

===&quot;Red Dwarf III&quot; (1989)===
With Grant and Naylor directly involved with the series&#x27; production (under Grant Naylor Productions) and a larger budget, they radically changed the look of the show. The opening credits sequence was changed. A new upbeat version of the theme tune played over clips from the series. A new official &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; logo also appeared at the end of the credit sequence. &quot;Starbug&quot; was introduced as the new spaceship in place of Blue Midget. The look of the series had been overhauled with the incoming Mel Bibby who had re-designed the old grey sets. Costumes were overhauled too, as designer Howard Burden brought in a new stylish look to the crew. A remastered version of this series was produced and broadcast in some countries.

There were a number of loose ends from the first two series, and changes in the third series, that were explained off by a text intro to the first show of Series III. This was done in the form of scrolling text across outer space, in a parody of the introductions to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies. The loose ends included the return of Kryten, Lister being pregnant, delivering twins Jim and Bexley, who grow up in a matter of days, then wind up in the parallel universe with the female version of Lister.

The regular cast changed for Series III: Robert Llewellyn came in as Kryten, and Hattie Hayridge replaced the departing Lovett as Holly. Craig Charles, Chris Barrie and Danny John-Jules remained as Lister, Rimmer and Cat, respectively.

The character of Kryten was originally intended as a one-off appearance in the series two episode &quot;Kryten&quot;, but had returned mainly to broaden the story potential. The series was becoming difficult to write for. At the insistence of Naylor, Kryten returned to complete the team. They had approached David Ross with the intention of bringing him back to play the regular role of Kryten; but Ross was committed to the stage play &quot;A Flea in Her Ear&quot; and thus not available. Eventually, Grant and Naylor went to see Robert Llewellyn in the stage production &quot;Mammon: Robot Born of Woman&quot;, playing a robot; they saw his performance and were impressed.

===&quot;Red Dwarf IV&quot; (1991)===
Due to the old studio in Manchester undergoing refurbishment, the recording of Series IV moved to Shepperton Studios. The broadcast was not as originally intended; the BBC had decided to start off with the romantic story of &quot;Camille&quot; for Valentine&#x27;s Day, while the outbreak of the Gulf War affected the series&#x27; running order, thus both the anti-war &quot;Meltdown&quot; and heroic Ace Rimmer&#x27;s &quot;Dimension Jump&quot; were almost postponed.

===&quot;Red Dwarf V&quot; (1992)===
The series returned without regular director Ed Bye, who had agreed to direct &quot;The Full Wax&quot;, fronted by his wife Ruby Wax. New director Juliet May found it hard to work with the science fiction elements, which were much more involved and complex than in previous series and left before the series had completed. The remaining episodes were directed by Grant and Naylor.

===&quot;Red Dwarf VI&quot; (1993)===
The writing of Series VI was rushed, due to the fact that the BBC wanted the episodes completed as soon as possible. Grant and Naylor had originally hoped to both write and direct Series VI, but the rapid production schedule meant this was unfeasible, and Andy de Emmony was brought in to direct the series. The writers decided to make changes for the new series—&quot;Red Dwarf&quot; itself was written out, thus removing Hattie Hayridge as Holly—and the series was set entirely aboard &quot;Starbug&quot;. During the series, Rimmer would also obtain &quot;hardlight&quot;, which would effectively give him a physical presence. For the first time in the series&#x27; history, a story arc was introduced and followed throughout the episodes, leading up to the series&#x27; cliffhanger.

===&quot;Red Dwarf VII&quot; (1997)===
After Series VI ended, co-creator and writer Rob Grant decided to leave the series to pursue other projects, but Naylor continued with the series to build towards the often discussed movie, and the series was expanded to eight episodes to meet US syndication requirements. To help with the expanding episode number, Naylor brought in the help of other writers such as Paul Alexander. Chris Barrie, disappointed with the hectic workload of Series VI, had decided to only take part in four of the episodes. Kochanski (now played by Chloë Annett) was brought back as a regular character.

Changes to the series itself were evident with the mix of science fiction and sit-com episodes throughout. This was an attempt by Naylor to move away from the &quot;monster of the week&quot; format that he felt Series VI suffered from. Ed Bye also returned to direct the series, after leaving due to scheduling clashes during Series V and VI. The studio audience was now removed from the series and, much like feature-length films, the episodes were mostly shot using one camera. Episodes were still videotaped, but were digitally processed to look like film, and although there was no live audience, a laughter track was later recorded at a screening of the episodes before an audience. The laughter track is only present on some episodes shown on the streaming service Netflix as of 2020.

===&quot;Red Dwarf VIII&quot; (1999)===
Having changed the look and format for Series VII, Naylor returned to the series&#x27; original roots for Series VIII. Writing the scripts himself, Naylor resurrected the original crew of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, along with Holly, this time played by Norman Lovett, and Chris Barrie as Rimmer. With the old cast and &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; itself now, the series returned to being videotaped in front of a studio audience, and ended on a cliffhanger that remained unresolved until 2009&#x27;s &quot;Red Dwarf: Back to Earth&quot;. With 52 episodes, the series was now in a good position for international syndication and the prospect of a feature-length film increased.

KTEH, a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) station in San Jose, California, broadcast the entire series on 7 March 1999. As a result, they broadcast the last five episodes of Series VIII before they were aired in the UK. &quot;Cassandra&quot; was also broadcast on other PBS stations on that date, as well.

===&quot;Red Dwarf: Back to Earth&quot; (2009)===
In 2009, UKTV channel Dave screened three new 25-minute specials to celebrate the 21st anniversary of the show. The new episodes form part of an effort by Dave to screen more original programming, instead of just repeats. The specials were made up of a three-part story, &quot;Back to Earth&quot;, as well as a &quot;Making-of&quot; special. Originally, there were to be two episodes, a &quot;Making-of&quot; and a live show titled &quot;Red Dwarf: Unplugged&quot;. However, according to Robert Llewellyn on Twitter, the Live Show had been cancelled due to time and money, and that there would be three episodes instead. As with series 7, these episodes were not filmed in front of a live studio audience; however, like the seventh series, it was shown to an audience at a later date to record the audience laughter.
===&quot;Red Dwarf X&quot; (2012)===
&quot;Red Dwarf&quot; returned for its first full series since 1999 in October 2012 for six new episodes written by Doug Naylor filmed before a live audience. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 19 November 2012. All four original cast members from &quot;Back to Earth&quot; reprised their roles.
===&quot;Red Dwarf XI&quot; (2016)===
It was confirmed on 2 May 2015 that an eleventh and twelfth series of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; (consisting of six episodes each) would be filmed in late 2015 and early 2016 for Dave. After the announcement, Craig Charles resigned his role on &quot;Coronation Street&quot; to focus on filming for both new series. &quot;Red Dwarf XI&quot; began broadcast in September 2016.

===&quot;Red Dwarf XII&quot; (2017)===
Filming on &quot;Red Dwarf XII&quot; began in early 2016.

===&quot;Red Dwarf: The Promised Land&quot; (2020)===
UKTV announced in October 2019 that a feature-length special would see production, to air in 2020.

==Unproduced scripts==

===&quot;Bodysnatcher&quot;===
Originally to be the second episode of Series I, and would have involved Rimmer going insane trying to deal with his intangibility and attempting to build himself a new body by stealing parts of Lister&#x27;s, and Lister trying to live with a hologram of himself. The former idea was, in a way, used in the episode &quot;Bodyswap&quot; in Series III, and the latter became the basis for &quot;Me2&quot; (with the plotline transferred from Lister to Rimmer), which filled the sixth spot in the first series after &quot;Bodysnatcher&quot; was dropped.

===&quot;Dad&quot;===
&quot;Dad&quot; was planned as the first episode of the show&#x27;s third series, intended to be a direct continuation of the preceding episode, &quot;Parallel Universe&quot;, the final episode of the second series. It was never filmed or even fully scripted; writers Rob Grant and Doug Naylor abandoned it halfway through writing it. Instead, a comically fast &quot;Star Wars&quot; opening crawl provided exposition for the episode &quot;Backwards&quot;, which became the new Series III premiere.

An extract of the unfinished script of &quot;Dad&quot; was included on the DVD release &quot;Red Dwarf: The Bodysnatcher Collection&quot; alongside several other such extracts. In the same style as the eponymous &quot;lost episode&quot; &quot;Bodysnatcher&quot;, the extract of &quot;Dad&quot; was animated in a storyboard style as the script itself was read by lead actor Chris Barrie (who, being a skilled impressionist, supplied the voices of all the characters).

In &quot;Parallel Universe&quot;, Lister had slept with a female version of himself while in a parallel dimension and learned that he was pregnant, since in that particular dimension it is the men who bear children. &quot;Dad&quot; was to primarily deal with Lister&#x27;s pregnancy, why former guest character Kryten had reappeared and become a regular member of the cast and what had happened to him, and why Holly&#x27;s image had changed from a male to a female. The released script extract shows that &quot;Dad&quot; would not have followed the pre-credits sequence of &quot;Backwards&quot; to the letter. For example, Lister would not have been pregnant with twins: instead he would give birth to a single son. Also, apparently Lister would have rebuilt Kryten while &quot;heavily pregnant&quot;, and not &quot;shortly afterwards&quot; as the pre-title &quot;Backwards&quot; scroll suggests. Additionally, unless male Holly actor Norman Lovett was to make a guest appearance in the episode it is likely that Holly would have first appeared as a female at the very beginning of the episode.

The script was ultimately rejected by the show&#x27;s writers and producers, Rob Grant and Doug Naylor, who felt that the script was not as funny as previous episodes. In &quot;The Red Dwarf Programme Guide&quot;, Chris Howarth and Steve Lyons write that another reason &quot;Dad&quot; was rejected was because it was possibly sexist.

Jokes from the script were worked into other episodes. For example, Lister&#x27;s revealing that he was abandoned at birth and Rimmer&#x27;s subsequent speculation that Lister was the product of brother-sister incest was written into the episode &quot;The Last Day&quot;.

===&quot;Identity Within&quot;===

This episode was going to be in Series VII but was replaced by &quot;Duct Soup&quot; for budgetary reasons. A reconstructed version of the episode (read by Chris Barrie) appears on the Series VII DVD release.
The Cat is fatally ill, with only one cure: he has to have sex. They travel to a GELF village, where a female cat called Aura is being held prisoner for auction. Lister, Rimmer and Kryten have to save Aura and get her to fall in love with the Cat before he dies from being a virgin. These events are loosely revisited in the Series XI finale &quot;Can of Worms&quot; where it&#x27;s revealed that the Cat is a virgin and ends up losing his virginity to a Polymorph disguised as a fellow cat.

==Feature film==
Once Series VIII ended in 1999, Doug Naylor attempted to make a feature-length version of the show. A script was written, by Naylor, and flyers began circulating around certain websites. The flyer outlined the movie&#x27;s plot, set in the distant future where Homo Sapienoids—a fearsome flesh-machine hybrid race—had taken over the solar system and were wiping out the human race. Spaceships that tried to escape Earth were hunted down until only one remained... &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. Pre-production began in 2004 and filming was planned for 2005. However, sufficient funding was not forthcoming and production was put on hold.

==American pilots==
: &quot;See Red Dwarf#U.S. version&quot;
Two versions of a pilot episode for a proposed NBC version of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; were produced in 1992—a complete episode and a partial episode with different cast members. Neither version aired, though excerpts from the first pilot appeared on the &quot;Red Dwarf V&quot; DVD set.

<doc id="1016971" wikidata="Q214151" url="?curid=1016971" title="Venezuela national football team">
<text>The Venezuela national football team (), nicknamed La Vinotinto (&quot;The Red Wine&quot;), represents Venezuela in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Venezuelan Football Federation (FVF), the governing body for football in Venezuela. Their nickname is a reference to the unique “red wine” team color that is used on their home jerseys. When playing at home in official games, they usually rotate between three stadiums: The Polideportivo Cachamay in Puerto Ordaz, the Estadio José Antonio Anzoátegui in Puerto La Cruz and the Estadio Pueblo Nuevo in San Cristóbal. In friendly matches, they tend to rotate between the rest of the stadiums in the country.

Unlike other South American nations, and akin to some Caribbean nations, baseball is extremely popular in Venezuela, which diverts athletic talent away from football, contributing to its historic lack of success in CONMEBOL competitions. As of 2022, they are the only CONMEBOL side to have never qualified for the FIFA World Cup. Often Venezuela would go through entire qualification tournaments without recording a single win, although this has not happened since 1998. Until 2011, their best finish at the Copa América was fifth in their first entry, in 1967. It is only recently with the spread of the World Cup&#x27;s popularity in nations where football was not the primary sport (such as Canada, Japan, the United States, and Australia) that the national team found incentives to increase player development and fan support. As of December 2019, Venezuela has the highest position on the FIFA World Ranking of any team that has not yet qualified for the World Cup, being ranked 25th.

==History==

===Backstory===
Venezuela did not participate in FIFA World Cup qualification until the 1966 qualifiers in which they were drawn with Uruguay and Peru, but failed to register a point in four games. In the 1970 qualifiers they managed to register a point, and after withdrawing from the 1974 series, repeated that in the 1978 qualifiers. The 1982 qualifiers saw them register their first win, over Bolivia. They wouldn&#x27;t register another World Cup qualifying win until the 1994 series when they defeated Ecuador. A highlight of the 1998 qualifiers was goalkeeper Rafael Dudamel scoring against Argentina in a 5–2 defeat.

Despite poor results during the 1960s and 1970s, outstanding players like Luis Mendoza and Rafael Santana achieved recognition. Venezuela at that time also managed to qualify for the 1980 Summer Olympics, it first-ever major international football competition Venezuela participated in.

===Richard Páez era===
After José Omar Pastoriza&#x27;s resignation during the 2002 World Cup qualifyings, Richard Páez took the technical direction of the national team. Finishing this process, Venezuela achieved 4 victories in a row against Uruguay, Chile, Peru, and Paraguay; winning more than 1 game in row, their first away game and not finishing in the last place for the first time in their World Cup qualifying history.

However, the team failed to qualify for both the 2002, and 2006 World Cups, gaining 16 and 18 points respectively. After this, the team advanced to the second round of Copa America 2007 in Venezuela.

In November 2007, Páez resigned after discrepancies with media and supporters.

===César Farías era===
With a new coach César Farías, Venezuela national team improved their performances. At the beginning of 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying, Venezuela won its first game in World Cup qualifying against long unbeaten Ecuador in Quito. Something similar happened to Bolivia in La Paz, where Venezuela won for the first time at Bolivian altitude. Also, they received their first point against Brazil in qualifying. Despite not ultimately reaching 2010, Venezuela achieved its best result in qualifying. They finished this round with 22 points in 18 matches, surpassing Peru and Bolivia for eighth place in the region.

On 6 June 2008, Venezuela achieved its first-ever triumph over Brazil, defeating the &quot;Seleção&quot; 2–0 in a friendly match in Boston, United States.
Venezuela obtained excellent results in the 2011 Copa América when they finished fourth, their highest finish in the tournament to date. With a squad composed mostly of players playing in Europe, they began 2014 World Cup qualification with a historic result (1–0) against Argentina in Puerto La Cruz, beating the Argentines for the first time.

===Noel Sanvicente era===
On 4 September 2014, Noel Sanvicente was made coach of the Venezuela national team. On 5 September 2014, the team lost its first match with Sanvicente under the helm 3–1 against South Korea in Bucheon.

Sanvicente&#x27;s first tournament came in the 2015 Copa América, with Venezuela drawn in Group C of the competition. Their opening game finished with an upset victory over tournament favorites Colombia by 1–0, but subsequent defeats to Peru and Brazil saw La Vinotinto eliminated.

Venezuela began the World Cup qualification campaign with a 1–0 defeat against Paraguay at home, and would not earn their first point until their match against Peru, a 2–2 draw in Lima where Venezuela led until the last minute of stoppage time. Their match with Chile ended in a disappointing 4–1 defeat. Sanvicente announced his resignation a week later after mutual consent with the FVF. At the time of Sanvicente&#x27;s departure, Venezuela was last in the qualification standings with a sole point.

===Rafael Dudamel era===
Sanvicente was replaced by former Vinotinto goalkeeper Rafael Dudamel, who decided to revamp the entire national team, by injecting the team with the promising young generation of Venezuelan players that finished second at the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup that was dubbed as the country&#x27;s first-ever football Golden Generation. Under his coaching, &quot;La Vinotinto&quot; quickly improved and reached the quarterfinals in the Copa América Centenario, with two 1–0 wins over Jamaica and Uruguay and a 1–1 draw against Mexico in the group stage and then a 4–1 defeat to Argentina in the quarter-finals. In the 7th matchday of the 2018 World Cup qualifier, Venezuela lost to Colombia 2–0 in Barranquilla, the first loss against &quot;Los Cafeteros&quot; since 2009. Later, on matchday 11, Venezuela won for the first time in the qualifier, 5–0 over Bolivia in Maturín with a hat-trick from Josef Martínez and goals from Jacobo Kouffati and Rómulo Otero.

On 2 January 2020, Dudamel resigned from the national team.

==Copa América history==
Venezuela first participated at the Copa América in 1967, and finished fifth after defeating Bolivia 3–0 with a side containing Mendoza and Santana. The 1975 tournament saw Venezuela drawn in a group with Brazil and Argentina, and finished bottom with an 11–0 defeat to Argentina. In the 1979 edition, which would be the international swansong for Mendoza and Santana, they drew 0–0 with Colombia and 1–1 with Chile. A highlight of the 1989 tournament was midfielder Carlos Maldonado&#x27;s four goals. In the 1993 series, Venezuela drew with Uruguay and the United States.

The team&#x27;s overall Copa América record has been relatively poor (goal difference 33–145 before the 2011 Copa América), but the &quot;&quot;Auge Vinotinto&quot; (Vinotinto Rise) period in the early 2000s (decade) brought increased attention to the sport in the country, which in turn brought increased support from both government and private institutions. Said support contributed greatly to the &quot;Vinotinto&#x27;s&quot;&quot; rise in quality. In 2007, during the Copa América held in Venezuela, the team progressed to the quarterfinals for the first time in its history after finishing first in a group containing Peru, Bolivia, and Uruguay. Venezuela&#x27;s 2–0 victory over Peru during the competition was its first Copa América victory since 1967.

===2011 Copa América===
At the 2011 Copa América championship, Venezuela reached the semi-finals round for the first time by defeating Chile in the quarter-final, 2–1. Despite their commanding presence against Paraguay in their semifinal, Venezuela was unable to convert their chances into goals. They would eventually lose 5–3 to Paraguay in a penalty shootout after remaining scoreless in normal and extra time. Venezuela and Peru played for third place at the Estadio Ciudad de La Plata, where Venezuela would suffer their biggest loss of the tournament, losing 4–1 to Peru and falling into fourth place overall. Nonetheless, it was their best-ever finish at the competition.

==Team image==

Venezuela made its international debut in the Central American and Caribbean Games held in Panama in 1938, wearing the &quot;vinotinto&quot; (burgundy) color. The burgundy color originated from the uniform of the Venezuelan National Guard. In the 1967 Copa América Venezuela also wore the Peñarol shirt v Chile to avoid colors clash, as Venezuela had arrived in the Estadio Centenario (Peñarol&#x27;s frequent venue) with no alternate shirts.

In 1993, a vertical band with the colors of the National flag was added to the left side of the jersey, which changed its colors to a more traditional red tone. This lasted until 1996 when Venezuela returned to the &quot;vinotinto&quot; tone.

In 1998 Venezuela adopted a yellow/blue/red scheme, similar to their flag colors, by Mexican manufacturer &quot;ABA Sports&quot;. The national team returned to the traditional color in 2000. It has been remaining (with few changes) as the main uniform up to present days.

<text>John Codrington Warwick Bampfylde (or Bampfield; 27 August 1754 – 1796/1797) was an 18th-century English poet. He came from a prominent Devon family, his father being Sir Richard Bampfylde, 4th Baronet, and was educated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He had financial problems, having fallen into dissipation on going to London. His romantic advances to Mary Palmer (later wife of Murrough O&#x27;Brien, 1st Marquess of Thomond), niece of Joshua Reynolds, were refused by her and discouraged by Reynolds, who expelled Bampfylde from the house. Bampfylde was subsequently arrested for breaking Reynolds&#x27;s windows, and he spent the latter part of his life in a psychiatric hospital in London, briefly regaining his sanity before his death from tuberculosis.

His only published work was &quot;Sixteen Sonnets&quot; (1778), which attracted the attention of Robert Southey.

<text>John Bampfylde (8 April 1691 – 17 September 1750) of Hestercombe in Somerset, was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1715 and 1741.

==Early life and family==
Bampfylde was the second son of Colonel Hugh Bampfield (died 1690), (eldest son and heir apparent of Sir Coplestone Bampfylde, 2nd Baronet (c. 1633–1692) of Poltimore and North Molton, Devon, whom he predeceased) by his wife Mary Clifford, daughter of James Clifford of Ware. His elder brother was Sir Coplestone Bampfylde, 3rd Baronet (c. 1689–1727) of Poltimore. The Bampfield family had been seated at Poltimore since about 1300.

Bampfylde married Elizabeth Basset, daughter of John Basset (1653–1686) of Heanton Punchardon and Umberleigh in Devon, five times MP for Barnstaple, Devon but there were no children before she died. He married secondly Margaret Warre (died 1758), daughter and heiress of Sir Francis Warre, 1st Baronet of Hestercombe, Somerset. He inherited Hestercombe House from his father-in-law in 1718 and began to lay out gardens there. The present gardens are largely the work of his son.

==Political career==
Bampfyld was returned as Tory Member of Parliament for Exeter on the family interest at the 1715 general election. He was absent for some divisions, but voted against the Government on the repeal of the Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts. He was recorded as accepting £1,000 South Sea stock on 22 March 1720 without paying for it. He did not stand again at the 1722 general election. He was returned unopposed as MP for Devon at a by-election on 3 February 1736. He voted against the Spanish convention in 1739 but was absent from other divisions. He retired at the 1741 general election.

==Death and legacy==
Bampfylde died on 17 September 1750. He had a son and two daughters by his second marriage.
*Col. Coplestone Warre Bampfylde (died 29 August 1791), Colonel of the Somerset Militia, who married Mary Knight, 2nd daughter of Edward Knight of Wolverley, Worcestershire, and died without issue. In 1818 John Knight II (died 1850) of Lea Castle, Wolverley, (father of Colonel Sir Frederick Winn Knight (1812-1897) KCB, MP) purchased the former Royal Forest of Exmoor, which adjoined the Manor of North Molton, Devon, a seat of the senior line of the Bampfylde family. 
*Elizabeth Bampfylde (died 1802), who died unmarried.
*Margaretta Bampfylde (died December 1792), who on 31 December 1753 married George Tyndale (1704–1771). Their son John Tyndale inherited the Warre estate at Hestercombe

<text>Juliette Gréco (; 7 February 1927 – 23 September 2020) was a French singer and actress. Her best known songs are &quot;Paris Canaille&quot; (1962, originally sung by Léo Ferré), &quot;La Javanaise&quot; (1963, written by Serge Gainsbourg for Gréco) and &quot;Déshabillez-moi&quot; (1967). She often sang tracks with lyrics written by French poets such as Jacques Prévert and Boris Vian, as well as singers like Jacques Brel and Charles Aznavour. Her 60-year career concluded with her final worldwide tour titled &quot;Merci&quot;, which began in 2015.

As an actress, Gréco played roles in films by French directors such as Jean Cocteau and Jean-Pierre Melville.

==Early life==
Juliette Gréco was born in Montpellier, France, to an absent Corsican father, Gérard Gréco; her mother Juliette Lafeychine (1899–1978) was from Bordeaux. Her lineage hails in part from Greece. She did not receive love from her mother in her childhood and suffered from her harsh comments due to being an unwanted child, such as &quot;You ain&#x27;t my daughter. You&#x27;re the child of rape&quot;. She was raised by her maternal grandparents in Bordeaux with her older sister Charlotte. After the death of her grandparents, her mother took them to Paris. In 1938, she became a ballerina at the Opéra Garnier.

When World War II began, the family returned to the southwest of France. Gréco was a student at the Institut Royal d&#x27;éducation Sainte Jeanne d&#x27;Arc in Montauban. The Gréco family became active in the Resistance and her mother was arrested in 1943. The two sisters decided to move back to Paris but were captured and tortured by the Gestapo, then imprisoned in Fresnes Prison in September 1943. Her mother and sister were deported to Ravensbrück while Juliette, being only 16, remained in prison for several months before being released. After her release, she walked the eight miles back to Paris to retrieve her belongings from the Gestapo headquarters. Her former French teacher and her mother&#x27;s friend, Hélène Duc, decided to take care of her.
In 1945, Gréco&#x27;s mother and sister returned from deportation after the liberation of Ravensbrück by the Red Army. Gréco moved to Saint-Germain-des-Prés in 1945 after her mother moved to Indochina, leaving Gréco and her sister behind.

==Bohemian lifestyle==

Gréco became a devotee of the bohemian fashion of some intellectuals of post-war France. Duc sent her to attend acting classes given by Solange Sicard. She made her debut in the play &quot;Victor ou les Enfants au pouvoir&quot; in November 1946 and began to host a radio show dedicated to poetry.

Her friend Jean-Paul Sartre installed her at the Hotel La Louisiane and commented that Greco had &quot;millions of poems in her voice&quot;. She was known to many of the writers and artists working in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, such as Albert Camus, Jacques Prévert and Boris Vian, thus gaining the nickname &quot;la Muse de l&#x27;existentialisme&quot;.

Gréco spent the post-Liberation years frequenting the Saint-Germain-des-Prés cafes, immersing herself in political and philosophical bohemian culture. As a regular at music and poetry venues like Le Tabou on Rue Dauphine, she was acquainted with Jean Cocteau, and was given a role in Cocteau&#x27;s film &quot;Orphée&quot; (1950).
She made her debut as a cabaret singer in the Parisian cabaret &quot;Le Bœuf sur le toit&quot; in 1949, performing the lyrics of a number of well-known French writers; Raymond Queneau&#x27;s &quot;Si tu t&#x27;imagines&quot; was one of her earliest songs to become popular.

==Film career==
She made her film debut in &quot;Les frères Bouquinquant&quot; (1947) and appeared in several French films. When Darryl F. Zanuck saw her photo in &quot;Time&quot;, she was offered a role in &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; (1957), and it led to other Hollywood-financed films.

==Personal life==
Gréco was married three times, to:
* actor Philippe Lemaire (1953–1956)
* actor Michel Piccoli (1966–1977)
* pianist Gérard Jouannest (1988–2018; his death)

With Lemaire, she had a daughter, Laurence-Marie, born in 1954. Laurence-Marie Lemaire died from cancer in 2016 aged 62.

In the year leading up to his death in January 1949, Gréco was the lover of married racing driver Jean-Pierre Wimille and suffered a miscarriage after his death.

According to Spanish writer Manuel Vicent, Juliette Gréco was Albert Camus&#x27;s lover. She also was in relationships with French singer Sacha Distel and Hollywood producer Darryl F. Zanuck.

In 1949, she began an affair with the American jazz musician Miles Davis. In 1957, they decided to always be just lovers because their careers were in different countries and his fear of damaging her career by being in an interracial relationship. They remained lovers and friends until his death in 1991.
Gréco also dated U.S. record producer Quincy Jones. According to Jones&#x27; autobiography, Davis was irritated with him for years when he found out.

Gréco had three rhinoplasties; in Paris in 1953 and 1956, and in London in 1960.

In September 1965, Gréco attempted suicide by an overdose of sleeping pills. She was found unconscious in her bathroom and taken to the hospital by Françoise Sagan.

Gréco lived between Paris and Saint-Tropez.

A leftist, she supported François Mitterrand in the 1974 presidential election, and was an initial investor in &quot;Minute&quot;, when it was mainly non-political and focused on the entertainment world.

Gréco died on 23 September 2020 at the age of 93.

==Legacy==
Gréco was portrayed by actress Anna Mouglalis in the film &quot;&quot; (2010).

Jean-Paul Sartre based the singer in his trilogy &quot;The Roads to Freedom&quot; (&quot;Les chemins de la liberté&quot;) on Gréco.

An allusion to Gréco is made by English singer Ray Davies in the song &quot;Art School Babe&quot; from his album &quot;Storyteller.&quot;

&quot;Michelle&quot; by the Beatles was inspired by Gréco and the Parisian Left Bank culture. Paul McCartney said of the song: &quot;We&#x27;d tag along to these parties, and it was at the time of people like Juliette Greco, the French bohemian thing. They&#x27;d all wear black turtleneck sweaters, it&#x27;s kind of where we got all that from, and we fancied Juliette like mad. Have you ever seen her? Dark hair, real chanteuse, really happening. So I used to pretend to be French, and I had this song that turned out later to be &#x27;Michelle&#x27;.&quot;

John Lennon wrote in &quot;Skywriting by Word of Mouth&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;d always had a fantasy about a woman who would be a beautiful, intelligent, dark-haired, high-cheek-boned, free-spirited artist à la Juliette Gréco.&quot;

Marianne Faithfull said of Gréco: &quot;When I was a young girl, Juliette Gréco was my absolute idol...She’s my role model for life. If I want to be anybody, I want to be Juliette Gréco.&quot;

In 1999, a rose was named after her by Georges Delbard under the name of &quot;Juliette Gréco&quot;.

On 23 September 2021, &quot;Place Juliette Gréco&quot; was inaugurated in Paris. It can be found beside the Church of Saint-Germain-des-Pres, in the 6th arrondissement of Paris.

For the Dior Fall/Winter 2023-2024 collection, Maria Grazia Chiuri paid tribute to Gréco.

<text>Abel is an ancient lunar impact crater that lies near the southeast limb of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It is located to the south of the crater Barnard, at the northwest edge of the Mare Australe.

The rim of Abel is heavily eroded and distorted in shape, forming a somewhat polygonal figure. It is incised and overlaid by past impacts. The satellite crater Abel A overlies the southern rim, while Abel M and Abel L intrude into the western wall.

The eastern floor of Abel has been resurfaced by past lava flows, leaving a relatively smooth, flat surface with a low albedo. The remains of a small crater rim protrude near the northeast wall. The western floor is rougher in texture and matches the albedo of the surrounding surface.

The crater was named for the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Abel.

<text>In mathematics, the upper topology on a partially ordered set &quot;X&quot; is the coarsest topology in which the closure of a singleton formula_1 is the order section formula_2 for each formula_3 If formula_4 is a partial order, the upper topology is the least order consistent topology in which all open sets are up-sets. However, not all up-sets must necessarily be open sets. The lower topology induced by the preorder is defined similarly in terms of the down-sets. The preorder inducing the upper topology is its specialization preorder, but the specialization preorder of the lower topology is opposite to the inducing preorder.

The real upper topology is most naturally defined on the upper-extended real line formula_5 by the system formula_6 of open sets. Similarly, the real lower topology formula_7 is naturally defined on the lower real line formula_8 A real function on a topological space is upper semi-continuous if and only if it is lower-continuous, i.e. is continuous with respect to the lower topology on the lower-extended line formula_9 Similarly, a function into the upper real line is lower semi-continuous if and only if it is upper-continuous, i.e. is continuous with respect to the upper topology on formula_10

<text>Adams is a lunar impact crater that is located in the rugged southeastern section of the Moon, near the lunar limb. It lies just to the southwest of the crater Legendre. To the northwest are the craters Hase and Petavius, and to the southwest is Furnerius. To the southwest of Adams is a system of rilles designated the Rimae Hase. The longest of these rilles follows a course to the southeast.

The rim of Adams is generally circular in form, but somewhat worn by small impact craters. There is a slight notched protrusion at the southern end of the wall. The floor is undistinguished, with no significant protrusions, and only minor craters.

Adams is a crater of Nectarian age.

Adams&#x27; name jointly honours three astronomers of that name: John Couch Adams, Walter Sydney Adams and Charles Hitchcock Adams.

<text>Surat Shabd Simran is a type of spiritual meditation in the Sant Mat tradition.

==Etymology==
&quot;Surat&quot; is &quot;attention&quot; or &quot;face&quot;, that is, an outward expression of the soul; &quot;Shabd&quot; or &quot;Shabda&quot; has multiple meanings including ‘sacred song’, ‘word’, ‘voice’, ‘hymn’, ‘verse’, or ‘sound current, ‘audible life stream’, and the ‘essence of the Absolute Supreme Being’. The Absolute Supreme Being is a dynamic force of creative energy sent out into the abyss of space at the dawn of the universe&#x27;s manifestation, as sound vibrations. These vibrations continue and are sent forth through the ages, framing all things that constitute and inhabit the universe. &quot;Yoga&quot; is literally ‘union’, or ‘to yoke’. Etymologically, &quot;Surat Shabd Yoga&quot; means the ‘Union of the Soul with the Essence of the Absolute Supreme Being’.

First is simran, or the repetition of Lord&#x27;s holy names. It brings back our scattered attention to the tisra til - the third eye (behind our eyes), which is the headquarters of our mind and soul, in the waking state, whence it has scattered.

Second is dhyan, or contemplation on the immortal form of the Master. This helps in keeping the attention fixed at that centre.

Third is bhajan, or listening to the Anahad Shabd or celestial music that is constantly reverberating within us. With the help of this divine melody, the soul ascends to higher regions and ultimately reaches the feet of the Lord.

&quot;Surat Shabda Yoga&quot; is also known as &quot;Sehaj Yoga&quot; – the path leading to &quot;Sehaj&quot; or equipoise, The Path of Light and Sound, The Path of the &quot;Sants or&quot; &#x27;Saints&#x27;, The Journey of Soul, and The Yoga of the Sound Current.

==Basic principles==
&quot;Surat Shabda Yoga&quot; is for the discovery of &quot;True Self&quot; (Self-Realization), &quot;True Essence&quot; (Spirit-Realization), and &quot;True Divinity&quot; (God-Realization) while living in the human physical body. This involves reuniting in stages with what is called the &quot;Essence of the Absolute Supreme Being&quot;, also known as the &quot;Shabd or Word&quot;. Attaining this extent of self-realization is believed to result in &quot;jivan&quot; &quot;moksha/mukti&quot;, which is liberation/release from &quot;samsara&quot; and positivity in the cycle of karma and reincarnation. Initiation by a contemporary living &quot;Satguru&quot; (Sat - true, Guru - teacher) is considered a prerequisite for successful &quot;sadhana&quot; (spiritual exercises). The &quot;sadhanas&quot; include &quot;simran&quot; (repetition, particularly silent repetition of a &quot;mantra&quot; given at initiation), &quot;dhyan&quot; (concentration, viewing, or contemplation, particularly on the Inner Master), and &quot;bhajan&quot; (listening to the inner sounds of the &quot;Shabd&quot;). The mantra is Guru Manter. These are some verbal words that one gets from living masters and chants in mind, not with the mouth. As the language varies from culture to culture, Guru Manter or Mantra may also vary from culture to culture in spirituality. On the other hand, Naam or Word of God or Kalma is unspeakable, alive and no one can write it on paper. In the new testament &quot;Hebrews 4:12&quot; states, &quot;For the Word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it pierces even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow. It judges the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&quot; Words which we write on paper are not alive and active. According to Scripture, the Word of God has existed since the beginning of the world, prior to any man-made language.

Surat Shabd Yoga arose in India in the last several hundred years, specifically in the Sikh tradition (Nanakpanthi) founded by Guru Nanak. The practice of meditation (Shabad), which is the central core practice of Surat Shabd Yoga, is derived from the ancient Hindu practice of &quot;nāda yoga&quot;. &quot;Nada yoga&quot; is expounded in various Hindu scriptures such as the Nadabindu Upanishad, an ancient text affiliated with the several thousands-year-old Rig Veda. The practice of &quot;nāda yoga&quot; within Hinduism has been widely affiliated within many yoga traditions including &quot;bhakti&quot; or devotional yoga, &quot;kundalini&quot; and &quot;tantric yogas&quot;, &quot;laya yoga&quot;, and &quot;raja yoga&quot;. Modern Hindu teachers still emphasizing &quot;nada yoga&quot; include Swami Sivananda, Swami Rama, Rammurti Mishra (Shri Brahmananda Sarasvati), Paramahansa Yogananda (Kriya Yoga Lineage), and many others. The practice of &quot;nāda yoga&quot; is an integral part of various other traditions as well, such as being a form of the advanced &quot;thogal&quot; practice in the Tibetan Dzogchen lineage, and is mentioned by H. P. Blavatsky, founder of the Theosophical Society in her book &quot;The Voice of the Silence&quot;. The form of Surat Shabd Yoga, practiced by followers of Sant Mat and the Sikh tradition (&quot;nanakpanthi&quot;), is most commonly related to &quot;nāda yoga&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;nāda yoga&quot; resembles and combines elements from the Hindu practices of &quot;raja yoga&quot;, &quot;laya yoga&quot;, and &quot;bhakti yoga&quot;.

==Movements and masters==
Adherents believe Surat Shabda Yoga has been expressed through the movements of many different masters. However, a basic principle of Surat Shabd Yoga&#x27;s tradition is the requirement for an outer Living Master to initiate followers onto the Path. The movements whose historical Satgurus have died and their successors do not purport themselves to be Surat Shabd Yoga Satgurus, usually are not considered currently to be Surat Shabd Yoga movements, either by their own leaders or by movements with current Living Masters.

Satguru Maharshi Mehi Paramahansa Ji Maharaj is considered the movement leader in the 20th century. He came to an isolated cave of Kuppaghat, Bhagalpur (Bihar, India) and practiced Surat-Shabda Yoga from March 1933 - November 1934. He achieved self-realization and attained ultimate salvation during his practice. He wrote books &quot;Moksha-Darshan (Philosophy of Salvation), &quot;Satsang-Yoga&quot;, &quot;Shri Gita-Yoga Prakash&quot;, &quot;Raamcharit Maanas Saar-Satik&quot;, &quot;Maharshi-Mehi-Padaawali&quot; and &quot;Maharshi-Mehi-Padawaali&quot;.

The Radha Soami movement of Surat Shabda Yoga was established by Shiv Dayal Singh (1818–1878) in 1861 and named &quot;Radhasoami Satsang&quot; circa 1866. Soamiji Maharaj, as he was known, presided over the satsang meetings for seventeen years at Panni Gali and Soami Bagh in Agra, India, until he died on June 15, 1878. Accounts of his guru and successors vary, although he gave verbal instructions on his last day as to how his followers should be cared for. According to Radha Soami Satsang Beas, his guru was Tulsi Sahib of Hathras. According to the successors Soami Bagh and Dayal Bagh, Tulsi Sahib was a contemporary guru of the same teachings; but being a natural born Satguru, Seth Shiv Dayal Singh Ji himself had no guru.

After his death, six immediate successors carried on Shiv Dayal Singh’s teachings, including Huzur Maharaj Rai Salig Ram of Peepal Mandi, Agra, and Babaji Maharaj Baba Jaimal Singh of Radha Soami Satsang Beas (RSSB). More information on living masters related to Seth Shiv Dayal Singh Ji&#x27;s lineage can be found in the Contemporary Sant Mat movements article.

Sant Kirpal Singh, a contemporary Sant Mat guru, stated that &quot;Naam&quot; (&quot;Word&quot;) has been described in many traditions through the use of several different terms. In his teachings, the following expressions are interpreted as being identical to &quot;Naam&quot;:
:*&quot;Naad&quot;, &quot;Akash Bani&quot;, and &quot;Sruti&quot; in the &quot;Vedas&quot;
:*&quot;Nada&quot; and &quot;Udgit&quot; in the &quot;Upanishads&quot;
:*&quot;Logos&quot; and &quot;Word&quot; in the &quot;New Testament&quot;
:*&quot;Tao&quot; by Lao Zi
:*&quot;Music of the Spheres&quot; by Pythagoras
:*&quot;Sraosha&quot; by Zoraster
:*&quot;Kalma&quot; and &quot;Kalam-i-Qadim&quot; in the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot;
:*&quot;Naam&quot;, &quot;Akhand Kirtan&quot;, and &quot;Sacha (&#x27;True&#x27;) Shabd&quot; by Guru Granth Sahib

The more recently promulgated Quan Yin Method of meditation espoused via the spiritual teachings of Supreme Master Ching Hai has notable similarities to Surat Shabd Yoga.

Eckankar, an American movement, has many links to Surat Shabd Yoga including terminology, although its American founder Paul Twitchell disassociated himself from his former teacher Kirpal Singh.

The Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, also founded in America in 1971 by John-Roger and now with students in thirty-two countries, also teaches a similar form of active meditation called &quot;spiritual exercises&quot;. This movement uses the Sound Current and ancient Sanskrit tones in order to traverse and return to the higher realms of Spirit and into God.

The MasterPath is another contemporary American movement of Surat Shabda Yoga. Gary Olsen, the current Living Master of this branch, contends that several historical figures are Sat Gurus of Surat Shabda Yoga as representatives for the eternal Inner Shabda Master. A few of these Living Masters of their times include Laozi, Jesus, Pythagoras, Socrates, Kabir, the Sufi Masters, and mystic poets, Hafez and Rumi, the Ten Sikh Gurus beginning with Guru Nanak, Tulsi Sahib, and the Radhasoami/Radha Soami and offshoot Masters, including Seth Shiv Dayal Singh Ji, Baba Sawan Singh, Baba Faqir Chand, and Sant Kirpal Singh.

The ten Sikh Satgurus (Nanak Panthis) discuss the inner sound and inner light a lot in their scriptures. The first Sikh Satguru was Guru Nanak, but his master (guru) was Waheguru. These masters teach these two techniques. There is a master, Satpal Maharaj, that teaches four techniques that include these two of inner light and inner music. Altogether He teaches inner light (sight), inner music (hearing), primordial vibration (sense of touch), and nectar (taste and smell).

These correspond to the five senses, and this is how a student turns them inward to experience what is inside of himself. See Vishnu with his four arms and they correspond to these. One hand is holding a circle (chakra) of light, one holding a conch shell for the inner sound (hold it to the ear and a sound is heard), one holding a lotus flower to refer to nectar, and finally the fourth hand is holding a metal club (mace) for the inner vibration (if you hit something with it, it vibrates like a tuning fork). Some people refer to this inner energy as the soul.

==The Line of Succession of sikhs==
THE LINE OF SUCCESSION FROM KABIR TO PRESENT 
From Kabir to present, the Masters of the Divine Science of Light and Sound appear and manifest themselves as an uninterrupted line, through which they transmitted to each successor the one knowledge and the one Power. Subsequently, we can trace an 
exact &quot;family tree&quot; from Kabir Sahib (1398-1518) to Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji (1469-1539) and further as shown below:

ਹੁਕਮੁ ਪਛਾਨੈ ਸੁ ਏਕੋ ਜਾਨੈ ਬੰਦਾ ਕਹੀਐ ਸੋਈ॥੩॥ (GGSG-Page No.1350-3)...Saint Kabir 
Translation: One who will recognize the Command (Hukam), will know One Lord, we call him the real man.

ਸਚਾ ਸਉਦਾ ਹਰਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਹੈ ਸਚਾ ਵਾਪਾਰਾ ਰਾਮ॥ (GGSG-Page No.570) 
Translation: The True merchandise(ਸਚਾ ਸਉਦਾ) is the Lord`s Naam. Trader Raam is the truth.

Above line in the book &quot;Guru Granth Sahib Ji&quot; verifies that during the true merchandise (ਸਚਾ ਸਉਦਾ) when Guru Nanak Dev Ji fed the hungry saints and he got the Naam from them. Whereas in books when we read the history of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, we find no information regarding true merchandise of Word or Naam of God. This line also verifies that Guru Nanak Dev Ji also interacted with living SattGuru where from he got the Naam.

ਏਕੋ ਨਾਮੁ ਹੁਕਮੁ ਹੈ ਨਾਨਕ ਸਿਤਗੁਿਰ ਦੀਆ ਬੁਝਾਇ ਜੀਉ॥੫॥ (GGSG-Page No.72) ..Guru Nanak 
Translation: The One &quot;Naam&quot; is the Lord&#x27;s Command, O Nanak, the &quot;True Guru(teacher)&quot; helped me to guess the lamp (light). 
(Here One Naam means One Word, and Hukam also addresses the Naam of God)

ਦੇਹੀ ਅੰਦਰਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਨਿਵਾਸੀ॥ (GGSG-Page No.1026) 
Translation: The Naam or Word or Kalma, abides deep within the body.

This line demonstrates that the Naam of God is something present in the body. One will get it within his own home i.e body where the spirit lives. Body is the current home of the spirit. After Guru Nanak Dev Ji below are the nine SattGurus (i.e Teachers of truth) of the Sikhs who got the success in the history and lead the community of Sikhs: 
Sri Guru Angad Dev Ji (1504-1552), 
Sr Guru Amar Das Ji (1479-1574), 
Sri Guru Ram Das Ji (1534-1581), 
Sri Guru Arjan Dev Ji (1563-1606), 
Sri Guru Har Gobind Sahib Ji (1595-1644), 
Sri Guru Har Rai Sahib Ji (1630-1661), 
Sri Guru Har Krishan Ji (1656-1664), 
Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji (1621-1675) 
and Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji (1667-1708).

===Variations in movements===
Among the exponents of Surat Shabd Yoga and the commonly shared elements related to the basic principles, notable variations also exist. For example, the followers of the orthodox Sikh faith no longer lay emphasis on a contemporary living guru. Different Surat Shabd Yoga paths will vary in the names used to describe the Absolute Supreme Being (God), including Anami Purush (nameless power) and Radha Soami (lord of the soul); the presiding deities and divisions of the macrocosm; the number of outer initiations; the words given as mantras; and the initiation vows or the prerequisites that must be agreed to before being accepted as an initiate.

<doc id="1017014" wikidata="Q242191" url="?curid=1017014" title="Montereau-Fault-Yonne">
<text>Montereau-Fault-Yonne (, before 1992: &quot;Montereau-Faut-Yonne&quot;), or simply Montereau, is a commune in the Seine-et-Marne department in the Île-de-France region in north-central France.

==Geography==
Montereau-Fault-Yonne straddles the confluence of the rivers Yonne and Seine at the far south-east of the Île-de-France region, 70 km southeast of its administrative centre, Paris. The A5 autoroute (Paris–Troyes–Chaumont) passes northeast of the town. Montereau station links by rail Laroche-Migennes, Melun and Paris. It is approximately equidistant between slightly larger Melun and Sens.

==Name==
The city takes its name from its geographical position on the confluence of the Yonne and the Seine rivers. &#x27;, also spelled &#x27; comes from the verb &quot;&quot; (&quot;to fail&quot;) in its old meaning &quot;to fall&quot;. Montereau is where the Yonne falls into the Seine.

==Sights==

The town is split in three by the rivers, &#x27; situated on the southern shore and &quot;Surville&quot; on the hill to the north. The old town centre is located in &#x27; while &quot;Surville&quot; is an assembly of high rise buildings, erected after World War II, and is in many ways a typical &quot;&quot; in the Île-de-France. Some of these high rise buildings are now (2005) going to be destroyed and replaced by individual houses. The old château-park in &quot;Surville&quot; (now the site of a high school &quot;Lycée André Malraux&quot;) however gives a very nice view over the confluent and the Seine-et-Marne region.
On the east side, between the two rivers, are the port and an industrial park.

==History==
In 1359, the King of Navarre Charles II of Navarre, who held the town because of his Champagne ascent, lost it to the regent of France (the future king Charles V).
John the Fearless was killed on the town&#x27;s bridge in September, 1419 by Tanneguy du Chastel and the sire de Barbazan, during a conference with the dauphin (who became in 1422 Charles VII). An inscription on the bridge recalls the event. In the collegiate church Notre-Dame-et-Saint-Loup there is a sword which has long been said to be John the Fearless&#x27;, but actually this sword is certainly more recent.

In 1420, Philip the Good, the son of John the Fearless, seized the town, which remained for eight years in the hands of the Anglo-Burgundian coalition. However, at the end of a long siege, the king Charles VII, helped by Jacques de Chabannes and Jean de Dunois, managed to take it again.

In 1567, during the Wars of Religion, Condé briefly seized the town.

In 1587, the inhabitants of Montereau sided with the Catholic League, but in 1590 they accepted the legitimacy of the new king Henry IV.
Montereau was also the place of one of the last victories of Napoleon on 14 February 1814.

In January 2012, the mayor proposed development of Napoleon&#x27;s Bivouac, a commemorative theme park at a projected cost of 200 million euros. The plans remain in dispute and nothing has been built.

==Demographics==
Inhabitants of Montereau-Fault-Yonne are called &quot;&quot;. The urban area of Montereau-Fault-Yonne has 29,458 inhabitants (2018).

== Hospital ==
Montereau has a campus of the Centre hospitalier Sud Seine et Marne.

==Economy==
Historically, the city has sported a strong industrial base and thus has strong blue collar roots. In recent decades, unemployment has become an increasing problem, especially within the immigrant community in &quot;Surville&quot;.

==Twin towns==
Montereau is twinned with the British town of Otley, north of Leeds.

<doc id="1017015" wikidata="Q336312" url="?curid=1017015" title="Iltutmish">
<text>Shams ud-Din Iltutmish (1192 – 30 April 1236) was the third of the Mamluk kings who ruled the former Ghurid territories in northern India. He was the first Muslim sovereign to rule from Delhi, and is thus considered the effective founder of the Delhi Sultanate.

Sold into slavery as a young boy, Iltutmish spent his early life in Bukhara and Ghazni under multiple masters. In the late 1190s, the Ghurid slave-commander Qutb ud-Din Aibak purchased him in Delhi, thus making him the slave of a slave. Iltutmish rose to prominence in Aibak&#x27;s service, and was granted the important iqta&#x27; of Badaun. His military actions against the Khokhar rebels in 1205–1206 gained attention of the Ghurid ruler Muhammad of Ghor, who manumitted him even before his master Aibak was manumitted.

After Muhammad of Ghor&#x27;s assassination in 1206, Aibak became a practically independent ruler of the Ghurid territories in India, with his headquarters at Lahore. After Aibak&#x27;s death, Iltutmish dethroned his unpopular successor Aram Shah in 1211, and set up his capital at Delhi. He then consolidated his rule by subjugating several dissidents, and fighting against other former Ghurid slaves, such as Taj al-Din Yildiz and Nasir ad-Din Qabacha. During 1225–1227, he subjugated Aibak&#x27;s former subordinates who had carved out an independent kingdom headquartered at Lakhnauti in eastern India. He also asserted his authority over Ranthambore (1226) and Mandore (1227), whose Hindu chiefs had declared independence after Aibak&#x27;s death.

In the early 1220s, Iltutmish had largely stayed away from the Indus Valley region, which was embroiled in conflicts between Qabacha, the Khwarazmian dynasty, and the Mongols. In 1228, he invaded the Indus Valley region, defeated Qabacha, and annexed large parts of Punjab and Sindh to his empire. Subsequently, the Abbasid caliph al-Mustansir recognized his authority in India. Over the next few years, Iltutmish suppressed a rebellion in Bengal, captured Gwalior, raided the Paramara-controlled cities of Bhilsa and Ujjain in central India, and expelled Khwarazmian subordinates in the north-west. His officers also attacked and plundered the Chandela-controlled Kalinjar area.

Iltutmish organized the administration of the Sultanate, laying the foundation for its dominance over northern India until the Mughal invasion. He introduced the silver &quot;tanka&quot; and the copper &quot;jital&quot; – the two basic coins of the Sultanate period, with a standard weight of 175 grains. He set up the Iqtadari system: division of empire into Iqtas, which were assigned to the nobles and officers in lieu of salary. He erected many buildings, including mosques, &quot;khanqahs&quot; (monasteries), &quot;dargahs&quot; (shrines or graves of influential people) and a reservoir (&quot;hawz&quot;) for pilgrims.

== Names and titles ==

The name &quot;Iltutmish&quot; literally means &quot;maintainer of the kingdom&quot; in Turkic. Since vowel marks are generally omitted in the historical Persian language manuscripts, different 19th-20th century writers read Iltutmish&#x27;s name variously as &quot;Altamish&quot;, &quot;Altamsh&quot;, &quot;Iyaltimish&quot;, and &quot;Iletmish&quot;. However, several verses by contemporary poets, in which the Sultan&#x27;s name occurs, rhyme properly only if the name is pronounced &quot;Iltutmish&quot;. Moreover, a 1425-1426 (AH 829) &quot;Tajul-Ma&#x27;asir&quot; manuscript shows the vowel &quot;u&quot; in the Sultan&#x27;s name, which confirms that &quot;Iltutmish&quot; is the correct reading of the name.

Iltutmish&#x27;s inscriptions mention several of his grandiloquent titles, including:

* &quot;Maula muluk al-arab wa-l-ajam&quot; (&quot;King of the Kings of the Arabs and the Persians&quot;), a title used by earlier Muslim kings including the Ghaznavid ruler Mas&#x27;ud
* &quot;Maula muluk al-turk wa-l&#x27;ajam&quot;, &quot;Saiyid as-salatin al-turk wa-l&#x27;ajam&quot;, &quot;Riqab al-imam maula muluk al-turk wa-l-ajam&quot; (&quot;Master of Kings of the Turks and the Persians&quot;)
* &quot;Hindgir&quot; (&quot;Conqueror of Hind&quot;)
* &quot;Sultan Salatin ash-Sharq&quot; (&quot;the Sultan of the Sultans of the East&quot;)
* &quot;Shah-i-Sharq&quot; (&quot;King of the East&quot;)
* &quot;Shahanshah&quot; (&quot;King of Kings&quot;), a title of the emperors of Persia

In Sanskrit language inscriptions of the Delhi Sultanate, he has been referred to as &quot;Lititmisi&quot; (a rendering of &quot;Iltutmish&quot;); &quot;Suritan Sri Samasadin&quot; or &quot;Samusdina&quot; (a rendering of his title &quot;Sultan Shamsuddin&quot;); or &quot;Turushkadhipamadaladan&quot; (&quot;the Turushka Lord&quot;).

== Early life ==

=== Outside India ===

Iltutmish was born in an affluent family: his father Ilam Khan was a leader of the Ilbari Turkic tribe. According to Minhaj&#x27;s &quot;Tabaqat-i Nasiri&quot;, he was a handsome and intelligent boy, because of which his brothers grew jealous of him; these brothers sold him to a slave dealer at a horse show. Minhaj&#x27;s narrative appears to be inspired by the Quranic story of Hazrat Yusuf (Joseph), who was sold into slavery by his jealous brothers.

According to Minhaj, as a young boy, Iltutmish was brought to Bukhara, where he was re-sold to the local &quot;Sadr-i Jahan&quot; (officer in charge of religious matters and endowments). There are several anecdotes about Iltutmish&#x27;s childhood interest in religious mysticism. According to a story narrated by Iltutmish himself in Minhaj&#x27;s book, once a family member of the &quot;Sadr-i Jahan&quot; gave him some money and asked him to bring some grapes from the market. Iltutmish lost the money on the way to the market, and started crying fearing punishment from his master. A dervish (Sufi religious leader) noticed him, and bought the grapes for him in exchange for a promise that he would treat religious devotees and ascetics well upon becoming powerful. The writings of Isami and some other sources suggest that Iltutmish also spent some time in Baghdad, where he met noted Sufi mystics such as Shahab al-Din Abu Hafs Umar Suhrawardi and Auhaduddin Kermani.

Minhaj states that the family of &quot;Sadr-i Jahan&quot; treated Iltutmish well, and later sold him to a merchant called Bukhara Haji. Iltutmish was subsequently sold to a merchant called Jamaluddin Muhammad Chust Qaba, who brought him to Ghazni. The arrival of a handsome and intelligent slave in the town was reported to the Ghurid king Mu&#x27;izz ad-Din, who offered 1,000 gold coins for Iltutmish and another slave named Tamghaj Aibak. When Jamaluddin refused the offer, the king banned the sale of these slaves in Ghazni. A year later, Jamaluddin went to Bukhara, and stayed there for three years with the slaves.

=== In Qutb al-Din&#x27;s service ===
Subsequently, Iltutmish&#x27;s master Jamaluddin returned to Ghazni, where Mu&#x27;izz ad-Din&#x27;s slave-commander Qutb al-Din Aibak noticed Iltutmish. Qutb al-Din, who had just returned from a campaign in Gujarat (c. 1197), sought Mu&#x27;izz ad-Din&#x27;s permission to purchase Iltutmish and Tamghaj. Since their sale had been banned in Ghazni, Mu&#x27;izz ad-Din directed them to be taken to Delhi. In Delhi, Jamaluddin sold Iltutmish and Tamghaj to Qutb al-Din for 100,000 &quot;jitals&quot; (silver or copper coins). Tamghaj rose to the position of the muqta (provincial governor) of Tabarhinda (possibly modern Bathinda), while Iltutmish became the &quot;sar-jandar&quot; (head of bodyguard).

Iltutmish rose rapidly in Qutb al-Din&#x27;s service, attaining the rank of &quot;Amir-i Shikar&quot; (superintendent of the hunt). After the Ghurid conquest of Gwalior in 1200, he was appointed the &quot;Amir&quot; of the town, and later, he was granted the iqta&#x27; of Baran. His efficient governance prompted Qutb al-Din to grant him the iqta&#x27; of Badaun, which according to Minhaj, was the most important one in the Delhi Sultanate.
In 1205–1206, Sultan Mu&#x27;izz ad-Din summoned Qutb al-Din&#x27;s forces for his campaign against the Khokhar rebels. During this campaign, Iltutmish&#x27;s Badaun contingent forced the Khokhars into the middle of the Jhelum river, and killed them there. Mu&#x27;izz ad-Din noticed Iltutmish, and made inquiries about him. The Sultan subsequently presented Iltutmish with a robe of honour, and asked Aibak to treat him well. Minhaj states that Mu&#x27;izz ad-Din also ordered Iltutmish&#x27;s deed of manumission to be drawn on this occasion, which would mean that Iltutmish - a slave of a slave until this point - was manumitted even before his own master Aibak had been manumitted. However, Iltutmish&#x27;s manumission doesn&#x27;t appear to have been well-publicized because Ibn Battuta states that at the time of his ascension a few years later, an ulama deputation led by Qazi Wajihuddin Kashani waited to find if he had obtained a deed of manumission or not.

== Ascension and consolidation of power ==

After Mu&#x27;izz ad-Din&#x27;s death in 1206, Qutb al-Din became the ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, which evolved independent of the former Ghurid Empire. In 1210, when Qutb al-Din Aibak died unexpectedly in Lahore during a sport game, the local nobles appointed Aram Shah as his successor to prevent instability in the kingdom. However, the nobles in other parts of the Sultanate opposed this decision, and proposed Iltutmish as an alternative, because Aibak used to call him a son, and because he had a distinguished record of service. These nobles, led by the military justiciar (&quot;Amir-i Dad&quot;) Ali-yi Ismail, invited him to occupy the throne.

Iltutmish marched to Delhi, where he seized the power, and later defeated Aram Shah&#x27;s forces. Some nobles rebelled against his seizure of power, but Iltutmish subjugated them, and had many of them beheaded.

Minhaj-i-Siraj states that after Aibak&#x27;s death, the former Ghurid dominions of India (&quot;Mamalik-i-Hindustan&quot;) had been divided into four parts, centred at:

* Delhi, controlled by Iltutmish
* Sindh, controlled by Nasir ad-Din Qabacha, a former Ghurid slave, who had been muqta (provincial governor) of Uch since 1204
* Lakhnauti, controlled by Ali Mardan Khalji, a former governor who proclaimed independence and styled himself as Sultan Ala al-Din
* Lahore, contested between Qabacha, Yildiz, and Iltutmish

=== Delhi&#x27;s dependencies ===

Several Muslim officers, who administered Delhi&#x27;s dependencies during Aibak&#x27;s reign, did not recognize Iltutmish&#x27;s authority. According to Minhaj, Iltutmish re-asserted Delhi&#x27;s control over Badaun, Awadh, Banaras, and Siwalik in a series of campaigns. For example, Iltutmish captured Banaras after defeating Qaymaz, who was presumably a former officer of Aibak.

By the time of Iltutmish&#x27;s ascension, Delhi&#x27;s hold over various Hindu chiefs had weakened, and some of them - such as those of Ranthambore and Jalor - had declared independence. During the first few years of his reign, Iltutmish other preoccupations appear to have prevented him from campaigning against these chiefs. Hasan Nizami refers to an undated expedition against Jalor, which may have taken place sometime after his victory over Aram Shah.

=== Defeat of Yildiz ===

The Ghurid capital of Ghazni was controlled by Taj al-Din Yildiz, a former slave who claimed to be the rightful successor to the Ghurid emperor. After Iltutmish suppressed the rival claimants to the throne, Yildiz sent him a royal umbrella (&quot;chatr&quot;) and a baton (&quot;durbash&quot;): these gifts implied that Iltutmish was a subordinate ruler. Iltutmish did not want an immediate confrontation, and accepted these gifts. Iltutmish&#x27;s earliest inscription, dated October 1211, styles him as a subordinate king - &quot;al-Malik al-Mu&#x27;azzam&quot; (&quot;the great chief&quot;), rather than as an imperial &quot;Sultan&quot;.

Meanwhile, taking advantage of the succession conflict between Aram Shah and Iltutmish, Qabacha had captured Lahore in 1211. Shortly after this, a Khwarazmian invasion forced Yildiz to leave Ghazni. Yildiz migrated eastwards, displaced Qabacha from Lahore, and captured parts of the Punjab region. Iltutmish became concerned that Yildiz would ultimately try to occupy Delhi, and marched against him.

Yildiz sent a message to Iltutmish, declaring that he was the real successor of Mu&#x27;izz ad-Din and thus, had claims to the former Ghurid territories in India. According to Isami&#x27;s &quot;Futuh-us-Salatin&quot;, Iltutmish replied that the days of such hereditary claims were over:

Iltutmish offered to engage in a negotiation provided both men came to the meeting unaccompanied by any warriors. Yildiz refused the offer, resulting a battle at Tarain on 25 January 1216, which resulted in Iltutmish&#x27;s victory. Isami states that Yildiz managed to escape to Hansi, while the earlier chronicler Hasan Nizami states that he was injured by an arrow and captured on the battlefield. Yildiz was later taken to Iltutmish&#x27;s stronghold of Badaun, where he was killed. Iltutmish&#x27;s success in this conflict reinforced the Delhi Sultanate&#x27;s independent status.

=== Initial conflict with Qabacha ===

Iltutmish&#x27;s victory over Yildiz did not result in any substantial increase in his territory. He did not immediately assert his control over the Punjab region, and Qabacha regained control of Lahore. By this time, Qabacha had assumed the sovereign title of Sultan, and controlled a vast territory that included coastal Sindh, Siwistan, Bhakkar, and Multan.

Subsequently, Qabacha tried to conquer a greater part of Punjab: according to Firishta, he sought to extend his authority as far as Sirhind in the east. This prompted Iltutmish to march against him in 1217. Qabacha initially retreated, but Iltutmish&#x27;s army chased him and defeated him at a place called Mansura, which was located on the banks of the Chenab River. Iltutmish then captured Lahore in the winter of 1216–1217, and appointed his son Nasiruddin Mahmud to govern it. Lahore remained contested in the subsequent years; for example, at the time of Khwarazmian invasion of the region (see below), it was under the control of Qabacha&#x27;s son.

Qabacha seems to have posed a serious threat to Iltutmish, as suggested by Muhammad Aufi in &quot;Lubab ul-Albab&quot;. Aufi, writing shortly before the Khwarazmian invasion, expresses hope that his patron Qabacha will soon conquer the whole of Hindustan. Aufi also mentions that Ahmad Jamaji, who was Iltutmish&#x27;s governor of Bahraich, defected to Qabacha in 1220.

=== Khwarazmian threat ===

The Khwarazmshahs, who had taken over the western part of the former Ghurid Empire, suffered a Mongol invasion in 1220. After being defeated at the Battle of Indus in 1221, the Khwarazmshah Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu escaped to the Punjab region. He entered into a matrimonial alliance with the local Khokhar chief Rai Khokhar Sankin, and defeated other regional rulers, including Qabacha.

The Mongol leader Genghis Khan briefly considered returning to Mongolia through a shorter route which involved crossing the Himalayan foothills. He sent envoys to Iltutmish, asking for the Delhi Sultan&#x27;s permission to pass through India. No extant sources provide any information about the result of this embassy, but it appears that Genghis Khan abandoned his plan to pass through India. According to the Persian historian Ata-Malik Juvayni, Genghis Khan advanced eastwards into India, but failed to find a suitable route, and therefore, exited the country via Peshawar. It is possible that Genghis Khan, through his envoys, asked Iltutmish to not aid Jalal ad-Din: Iltutmish seems to have obliged.

Meanwhile, Jalal ad-Din established himself in the Sindh Sagar Doab in the Punjab region, and captured the fort of Pasrur. He sent his envoy Ainul Mulk to Iltutmish, seeking an alliance against the Mongols, and requesting for a safe place to stay. According to Juvayni, after deliberating over the matter for several days, Iltutmish refused to provide him a residence on the excuse that no place in his kingdom have a suitable climate or a locality fit for a king. Iltutmish also had the envoy killed, and sent troops to aid Qabacha against Jalal ad-Din . Minhaj, another Persian historian, states that Iltutmish himself led an army against Jalal ad-Din. Only the vanguards of the two armies clashed, and the two rulers withdrew after exchanging friendly messages.

Meanwhile, Qabacha - who had earlier accepted Jalal ad-Din&#x27;s suzerainty - rebelled against him, and this conflict kept Jalal ad-Din busy. Jalal-ad-Din carried out some more campaigns in India, including a raid in Gujarat, but none against Iltutmish. He left the Indian frontier in 1223–1224; according to his biographer Shihab al-Din Muhammad al-Nasawi, he did so because he received the news that Iltutmish, Qabacha, and several Hindu chiefs (&quot;rais and thakurs&quot;) had formed an alliance against him. The Mongols also maintained a presence in the region: for example, Genghis Khan&#x27;s general besieged Qabacha in Multan in 1224, before retreating because of hot weather.

Until Genghis Khan&#x27;s death in 1227, Iltutmish chose not to get involved in the politics of the Indus valley region to avoid a potential conflict with the Mongols.

== Territorial expansion ==
=== Eastern India and Rajasthan ===
Iltutmish&#x27;s predecessor Aibak had appointed Ali Mardan Khalji as the governor of Sultanate&#x27;s territories in eastern India. After Aibak&#x27;s death, the region became independent, with Lakhnauti as its capital, and Ali Mardan&#x27;s successor Ghiyasuddin Iwaj Shah (alias Husamuddin Iwaz Khalji) styled himself as a sovereign Sultan. While Iltutmish was busy at the north-western frontier of his empire, Ghiyasuddin captured parts of present-day Bihar, and also extracted tribute from the smaller states of Jajnagar, Tirhut, Bang (in Bengal region), and Kamrup.

Iltutmish&#x27;s forces captured Bihar in the 1210s, and invaded Bengal in 1225. Ghiyasuddin led an army to check Iltutmish&#x27;s advance, but then decided to avoid a conflict by paying him tribute and accepting his suzerainty. Iltutmish accepted the offer, and returned to Delhi after appointing Malik Jani as the governor of Bihar.

In 1226, Iltutmish captured the Ranthambore Fort, which was reputed to be impregnable. The next year, he captured the fort of Mandore, also in present-day Rajasthan.

Meanwhile, in eastern India, Ghiyasuddin re-asserted his independence and occupied Bihar. In 1227, Iltutmish directed his son Nasiruddin Mahmud, who held the iqta&#x27; of neighbouring Awadh region at this time, to invade Bengal while Ghiyasuddin was away on a plundering campaign in Kamrup. Nasiruddin captured his capital Lakhnauti, and defeated and executed him on his return to Bengal. Following this conquest, the coinage in the Bengal region was issued in the name of Iltutmish, and the khutba in Lakhnauti was also read in his name. 

=== Annexation of Qabacha&#x27;s empire ===

During the first half of the 1220s, Iltutmish had avoided Indus River Valley, which was contended by the Mongols, the Khwarazm kings, and Qabacha. After the decline of the Mongol and the Khwarazmian threat, Qabacha gained control over this region. Shortly after, during 1228–1229, Iltutmish invaded Qabacha&#x27;s territory. By this time, the conflicts with the Khwarazmians and the Mongols had weakened Qabacha&#x27;s power.

The writings of Hasan Nizami and Muhammad Aufi suggest that Qabacha had earlier signed some treaties with Iltutmish, probably to secure his support against the Khwarazm prince Jalal ad-Din. These treaties probably involved Qabacha&#x27;s recognition of Iltutmish&#x27;s sovereignty, or promises to surrender some territories to the Delhi Sultan. Qabacha&#x27;s failure to abide by these treaties may have prompted Iltutmish to wage a war against him.

Iltutmish&#x27;s forces captured Tabarhinda, Kuhram, Sarsati (or Sursuti), and Lahore from Qabacha. Iltutmish appointed Nasir al-Din Aytemur al-Baha&#x27;i as his provincial governor (&quot;muqta&quot;) of Lahore. He then sent Nasir al-Din to capture Multan, while he himself invaded Uch. Nasir al-Din captured Lahore, and Iltutmish captured Uch after a three-month long siege, on 4 May 1228.

Qabacha fled to Bhakkar, pursued by an army led by Iltutmish&#x27;s wazir &quot;Nizam al-Mulk&quot; Junyadi. Finding himself in an unwinnable situation, Qabacha sent his son Malik Alauddin Bahram to Iltutmish, to negotiate a peace treaty. Iltutmish offered peace in exchange for Qabacha&#x27;s unconditional surrender, but Qabacha preferred death to these terms, and committed suicide by drowning himself into the Indus River on the night of 26 May 1228. Iltutmish then placed Multan and Uch under his own governors, and had his forces occupy several strategic forces, expand his authority up to Makran in the west. Malik Sinanuddin, the wāli (governor) of coastal Sindh, also recognized Iltutmish&#x27;s authority, and thus Iltutmish&#x27;s empire spread as far as the Arabian Sea. Qabacha&#x27;s son and surviving followers also accepted Iltutmish&#x27;s suzerainty.

== Later years ==

=== Caliph&#x27;s recognition ===

In 1220-, the Abbasid Caliph Al-Nasir sent his Indian-born ambassador Radi al-Din Abu&#x27;l-Fada&#x27;il al-Hasan bin Muhammad al-Saghani to Delhi. The ambassador returned to the Abbasid capital Baghdad in 1227, during the reign of Al-Mustansir. In 1228, the new Caliph sent the ambassador back to Delhi with robes of honour, recognizing Iltutmish&#x27;s authority in India and conferring on him the titles &quot;Yamin Khalifat Allah&quot; (&quot;Right Hand of the God&#x27;s Deputy&quot;) and &quot;Nasir Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin&quot; (&quot;Auxiliary of the Commander of the Faithful&quot;). On 18 February 1229, the embassy arrived in Delhi with a deed of investiture.

Although the Caliphate&#x27;s status as a pan-Islamic institution had been declining, the Caliph&#x27;s recognition was seen as a religious and political legitimization of Iltutmish&#x27;s status as an independent ruler rather than a Ghurid subordinate. The Caliph&#x27;s recognition was a mere formality, but Iltutmish celebrated it in a big way, by decorating the city of Delhi and honouring his nobles, officers, and slaves. Iltutmish&#x27;s own court poets eulogize the event, and the 14th century Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta describes him as the first independent ruler of Delhi. Iltutmish is the only ruler of India to have the Caliph&#x27;s recognition. Ghiyasuddin Iwaj Shah, the ruler of Bengal defeated by Iltutmish&#x27;s forces, had earlier assumed the title &quot;Nasir Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin&quot;, but he did so unilaterally without the Caliph&#x27;s sanction. The Caliph probably saw Iltutmish as an ally against his Khwarazmian rival, which may have prompted him to recognize Iltutmish&#x27;s authority in India.

After the Caliph&#x27;s recognition, Iltutmish began inscribing the Caliph&#x27;s name on his coins, including the new silver &quot;tanka&quot; introduced by him.

=== Other campaigns ===

In March–April 1229, Iltutmish&#x27;s son Nasiruddin Mahmud, who had been governing Bengal since 1227, died unexpectedly. Taking advantage of this, Malik Balkha Khalji, an officer of Iltutmish, usurped the authority in Bengal. Iltutmish invaded Bengal, and defeated him in 1230. He then appointed Malik Alauddin Jani as the governor of Bengal.

Meanwhile, Mangal Deva, the Parihara chief of Gwalior in central India, had declared independence. In 1231, Iltutmish besieged the city, and captured it after 11 months of conflict, on 12 December 1232. After Mangal Deva fled, and Iltutmish left the fort under the charge of his officers Majdul Mulk Ziyauddin.

In 1233–1234, Iltutmish placed Gwalior under Malik Nusratuddin Taisi, who was also assigned the iqta&#x27;s of Sultankot and Bayana, and made in-charge of the military contingents at Kannauj, Mehr, and Mahaban. Shortly after, Taisi attacked the Chandela fort of Kalinjar, and subsequently plundered the area for around 50 days. During this campaign, he acquired a large amount of wealth: Iltutmish&#x27;s share (one-fifth) of the loot amounted to 2.5 million &quot;jitals&quot;. While Taisi was returning to Gwalior, the Yajvapala ruler Chahada-deva (called Jahar by Minhaj) ambushed him, but Taisi able to fend off the attack by dividing his army into three contingents.

Subsequently, Iltutmish raided the Paramara-controlled cities of Bhilsa and Ujjain in 1234–35. Iltutmish&#x27;s army occupied Bhilsa, and destroyed a temple whose construction - according to Minhaj - had taken three hundred years. At Ujjain, his forces damaged the Mahakaleshwar temple and obtained rich plunder, but made little effort to annex the Paramara territory. The jyotirlinga at the site was dismantled and believed to be thrown into a nearby &#x27;Kotiteerth Kunda&#x27; (a pond neighboring the temple) with the Jaladhari (a structure supporting the Lingam) stolen during the invasion.

By 1229–1230, the north-western boundary of Iltutmish&#x27;s kingdom appears to have extended up to the Jhelum River, as Nasawi states that he controlled the area &quot;up to the neighbourhood of the gates of Kashmir&quot;. During this period, Iltutmish invaded the territories controlled by the Khwarazmian subordinate Ozbeg-bei, in present-day Pakistan. Ozbeg-bei fled to the Khwarazmian ruler Jalal-ad-Din in Iraq, while Other local commanders - including Hasan Qarluq - surrendered to Iltutmish. Qarluq later changed his allegiance to the Mongols. During his last days, in 1235–1236, Iltutmish is known to have aborted a campaign in the Binban area: this campaign was probably directed against Qarluq.

&quot;Hammira-mada-mardana&quot;, a Sanskrit play by Jayasimha Suri, mentions that a mlechchha (foreigner) called Milachchhrikara invaded Gujarat during the Chaulukya reign. The Chaulukya minister Vastupala used diplomatic tactics to create many difficulties for the invader, who was ultimately defeated by the general Viradhavala. Some historians have identified Milachchhrikara with Iltutmish, thus theorizing that Iltutmish unsuccessfully tried to invade Gujarat. However, others have dismissed this identification as inaccurate.

===Death and succession===

In 1236, Iltutmish fell ill during a march towards Qarluq&#x27;s stronghold of Bamyan, and returned to Delhi on 20 April, at the time chosen by his astrologers. He died in Delhi shortly after, on 30 April 1236. He was buried in the Qutb complex in Mehrauli.

The death of Iltutmish was followed by years of political instability at Delhi. During this period, four descendants of Iltutmish were put on the throne and murdered. In the 1220s, Iltutmish had groomed his eldest son &quot;Malikus Sa&#x27;id&quot; Nasiruddin Mahmud as his successor, but Nasiruddin died unexpectedly in 1229. While leaving for his Gwalior campaign in 1231, Iltutmish had left Delhi&#x27;s administration to his daughter Razia. Her effective administration prompted him to declare her as his heir apparent in 1231, upon his return from Gwalior. However, shortly before his death, Iltutmish seems to have chosen his surviving eldest son Ruknuddin Firuz as his successor. When Iltutmish died, the nobles unanimously appointed Ruknuddin as the new king.

During Ruknuddin&#x27;s reign, his mother Shah Turkan took control of the state affairs, and started mistreating her rivals. Their execution of Qutubuddin, a popular son of Iltutmish, led to rebellions by several nobles, including Malik Ghiyasuddin Muhammad Shah - another son of Iltutmish. Amid these circumstances, Razia seized the throne in November 1236, with support of the general public and several nobles, and Ruknuddin was executed. Razia also faced rebellions, and was deposed and killed in 1240. The nobles then appointed Muizzuddin Bahram - another son of Iltutmish - on the throne, but subsequently deposed and killed him in 1242. Next, the nobles placed Ruknuddin&#x27;s son Alauddin Masud on the throne, but he too, was deposed in 1246.

Order was re-established only after Nasiruddin-Mahmud became Sultan with Iltutmish&#x27;s prominent slave, Ghias-ud-din-Balban as his deputy (&quot;Naib&quot;) in 1246. Minhaj calls the new Sultan a son of Iltutmish, but Isami and Firishta suggest that he was a grandson of Iltutmish. Some modern historians consider Minhaj more reliable, while others believe that the new Sultan was a son of Iltutmish&#x27;s eldest son Nasiruddin (who died before Iltutmish), and was named after his father. Balban held all the power at the time and became Sultan in 1266. Balban&#x27;s descendants ruled Delhi until they were overthrown by the Khaljis.

== Religion ==

Iltutmish was a devout Muslim, and spent considerable time praying at night.

He was punctual in offering his prayers.

Nizam-ud-Din Ahmad says:
He also made special arrangement for prayers on military campaigns.

His court poet Amir Ruhani describes him as a &quot;holy warrior and Ghazi&quot;. He revered several Sufi saints, including Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki, Hamiduddin Nagauri, Jalaluddin Tabrizi, Bahauddin Zakariya, and Najibuddin Nakhshabi.

=== Policy towards Hindus ===

When a group of ulema came to Iltutmish and requested him to apply the law of &quot;death or Islam&quot; on Hindus, Iltutmish asked Nizam-ul&#x27;-Mulk Junaidi to give a suitable reply to the ulama.

The Wazir replied to them:

Iltutmish held religious discourses by orthodox ulama - such as Sayyid Nuruddin Mubarak Ghaznavi - in his court, but disregarded their advice while formulating the imperial policies. He understood the limits to which the Islamic shariah law could be implemented in largely non-Muslim India. He did not consult the ulama while making the unorthodox decision of nominating his daughter Raziya as his successor. This balance between the shariah and the practical needs of the time became a feature of Turkic rule in Delhi.

== Legacy ==

&quot;Iltutmish laid down the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate as a truly independent kingdom, freeing it from a subordinate position to Ghazni. The Caliph&#x27;s investiture, although a mere formality, reaffirmed his status as an independent sovereign among the Muslims. By the time of his death, the Delhi Sultanate had emerged as the largest and the most powerful kingdom in northern India.

Iltutmish was most probably the first ruler to organize a centrally recruited, centrally paid and centrally managed army in the Delhi Sultanate. His courtier Fakhr-i Mudabbir composed &quot;Adab al-harb wa-l-shaja&#x27;a&quot;, a book on the art of warfare.

=== Iqtas ===

Iltutmish implemented the &quot;iqta&quot; system of administrative grants in the Delhi Sultanate. This system, borrowed from the earlier Islamic dynasties of the Middle East, involved dedicating the revenues from a certain region to a subordinate in exchange for military service and political loyalty. Iltutmish used this &quot;iqtas&quot; to consolidate his empire by dismantling the existing feudal order of the Indian society.

Iltutmish assigned several regions to his Turkic subordinates in the form of &quot;iqtas&quot;. The larger &quot;iqtas&quot; - which were effectively provinces of the empire - were assigned to high-ranking men, who were expected to administer the regions, maintain local law and order, and supply military contingents in times of need. The holders of the smaller &quot;iqtas&quot; were only expected to collect revenues from their regions, in exchange for providing military service to the emperor. To ensure that this &quot;iqta&quot; system remained bureaucratic - rather than feudal - in nature, Iltutmish transferred the &quot;iqta&quot; holders from one region to another, refused to grant them legal immunity, and discouraged localism in administration.

Both free amirs as well as &quot;bandagan-i-shamsi&quot; (as opposed to &quot;bandagan-i-khass&quot; during Mu&#x27;izz ad-Din&#x27;s times) were used by Iltutmish over an extended, long process involving rotation of the &quot;iqtas&quot; assigned to each noble every once in a while to ensure that there was no question of claims on a specific region by a specific noble. Besides these, princes were used as well in almost the same capacity, but in more important roles.

===Coinage===
Iltutmish introduced two coins that became the basis for the subsequent coinage of the Delhi Sultanate: the silver &quot;tanka&quot; and the copper &quot;jital&quot;.

His predecessors, including the Ghurid rulers, had maintained the local coinage system based on the Hindushahi bull-and horseman coins minted at Delhi. Dehliwala, the standard coin, was a silver-copper alloy with a uniform weight of 3.38 grams, of which 0.59 grams was Silver. The major source of silver for the Delhi mint were coin hoards from Central Asia. Another source was European silver which made its way to Delhi via the Red Sea, Persian Gulf through the ports of Gujarat. By the 1220s, supply from Central Asia had dried up and Gujarat was under control of hostile forces.

In response to the lack of silver, Iltutmish introduced a new bimetallic coinage system to Northern India consisting of an 11 grams silver &quot;tanka&quot; and the billon &quot;jital&quot;, with 0.25 grams of silver. The Dehliwala was devalued to be on par with the &quot;jital&quot;. This meant that a Dehliwala with 0.59 grams of silver was now equivalent to a coin with 0.25 grams of silver. Each Dehliwala paid as tax, therefore produced an excess 0.34 grams of silver which could be used to produce &quot;tankas&quot;. The new system served as the basis for coinage for much of the Sultanate period and even beyond, though periodic shortages of silver caused further debasement. The &quot;tanka&quot; is a forerunner to the Rupee.

===Islamic culture ===

During Iltutmish&#x27;s reign, the city of Delhi emerged as the centre of Islamic power and culture in India. He patronized several scholars, including historian Minhaj-i-Siraj and the Sufi mystic Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki. Minhaj states that Iltutmish&#x27;s patronage attracted several scholars and other prominent people to Delhi, especially from Persia, which had fallen to the Mongols. Iltutmish&#x27;s court is reported to have had raised seats for distinguished scholars and saints, as opposed to lower seats for others. This is suggested by &quot;Fawa&#x27;id-ul-Fu&#x27;ad&quot;, a near-contemporary work, which describes a quarrel between Shaikh Nizamuddin Abul Muwayyid and Sayyid Nuruddin Mubarak Ghaznavi over choice of seats in Iltutmish&#x27;s presence.

&quot;Fawa&#x27;id-ul-Fu&#x27;ad&quot; mentions an anecdote about Iltutmish&#x27;s patronage to scholars: Nasiri, a poet in need of a royal award, composed a &quot;qasida&quot; in praise of Iltutmish. However, while he was in the middle of reciting the poem, Iltutmish left the recital to attend an urgent administrative matter. A dismayed Nasiri thought Iltutmish would forget him, and lost all hope of getting the royal award. But as soon as Iltutmish was free, he came to Nasiri, recited the first line of the &quot;qasida&quot; from his memory, and asked Nasiri to complete his recital.

=== Architecture ===

Iltutmish invested in numerous waterworks, mosques, and civil amenities in Delhi. He completed the construction of the Qutb Minar, which had been started by Qutb al-din Aibak. He also commissioned the Hauz-i-Shamsi reservoir to the south of Qutb Minar, and the madrasa (school) around it.

He built several khanqah (monasteries) and dargahs (graves) for Sufi saints. He commenced the structure of Hamid ud-din&#x27;s Khanaqa, and built the &quot;Gandhak ki Baoli&quot;, a stepwell for the Sufi saint, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki, who moved to Delhi during his reign.

In 1231, he built the Sultan Ghari funerary monument for his eldest son Nasiruddin, who had died two years earlier. This was the first Islamic mausoleum in Delhi, and lies within fortified grounds, which also include the graves of other relatives of Iltutmish.

<text>The Western Heights of Dover is a series of forts and ditches in Dover, England. They were created in the 18th and 19th centuries to augment the existing defences and protect the key port of Dover from both seaward and landward attack; by the start of the 20th century Dover Western Heights was collectively reputed to be the &quot;strongest and most elaborate&quot; fortification in the country. The Army finally withdrew from the Heights in 1956–61; they are now a local nature reserve.

==Introduction==

First given earthworks in 1779 against the planned invasion that year, the high ground west of Dover was properly fortified in 1804 when Lieutenant-Colonel William Twiss was instructed to modernise the existing defences. This was part of a huge programme of fortification in response to Napoleon&#x27;s planned invasion of the United Kingdom. It followed a sustained period of related work by Twiss on upgrading the fortifications of nearby Dover Castle (1794–1803).

==The Citadel==

The Citadel, lying at the western end of the Heights, formed its main defensive point. The Citadel began as a large bastioned fieldwork, constructed in the early 1780s and containing within its fortifications three loopholed guard houses.

In 1804 plans were made to rebuild both the &#x27;West and East Redoubts&#x27; (i.e. the Citadel and Drop Redoubt) and to link them with earthworks along the length of the Heights. By 1806 the rebuilt Citadel was surrounded by an unrevetted defensive ditch; in the centre was a set of temporary barracks huts (along with the three guardhouses). A well was sunk in 1809, to ensure a permanent supply of water in case of a siege; (a pumphouse was added in 1860).

Following a collapse of part of the fortifications in 1807 another application was made for revetting to take place. Nevertheless, at the end of the Napoleonic Wars the Citadel remained unfinished; it was not until the start of the Crimean War in 1853 that work resumed on completing and revetting the ditches. At the same time, some of the existing casemates were adapted to provide barracks accommodation for 500 men.

By 1860 the Citadel was entered, via a drawbridge over the ditch, through a gate on the eastern side; a tunnel then led through the rampart into the fort by way of the main guard room.

Between 1860 and 1874 outworks were added. By now, within the ramparts, the Citadel contained barracks, stores and magazines arrayed around a large parade ground. The bomb-proof Officers&#x27; Quarters and Mess, built by Major William Jervois in 1860, was designed in part to be able to function as a defensible keep in the event of the Citadel being stormed by the enemy.

After 1890 the Citadel ceased to have a defensive role and functioned instead as a large barracks and mobilisation centre, with additional hut accommodation provided for up to 900 soldiers in total. During World War I it was occupied by 3rd (Reserve) Battalion, Buffs (East Kent Regiment) charged with training reinforcement drafts for the service battalions serving overseas. In 1956 the Citadel was handed over to HM Prison Service; it served successively as a Borstal, a Youth Custody Centre and a Young Offender Institution.

===The Armaments===
It was initially envisaged that the Citadel would be armed with forty-three 18-pounder guns, and thirty-one carronades. By the 1860s it had been re-armed with eighteen 18-pounder carronades, twenty 12-pounder carronades and ten 8-inch mortars.

==Drop Redoubt==

The Drop Redoubt is one of the two forts on Western Heights, and is linked to the Citadel by a series of dry moats. Prior to construction of the Redoubt a bastioned fort had stood there as part of the 18th-century fortifications. The construction of the Redoubt was in two periods: the first being from 1804 to 1808 during the Napoleonic Wars, and the second from 1859 to 1864 following the recommendations of the 1859 Royal Commission.

===First Period===
The original form of the Drop Redoubt was a simple pentagon, formed by cutting trenches into the hillside and revetting (facing) them with brickwork. Thus, the Redoubt was a solid ‘island’ with barracks, magazine, and artillery, on top. Originally, it would have accommodated 200 troops but, by 1893, the numbers had been reduced to just 90.

A striking feature of the first period is the Soldiers’ Quarters – five bomb-proof casemates. These are parabolic in cross section and covered in a thick layer of earth to withstand the effect of mortar-bombs. The windows at the rear of each open into a trench, to protect them against blast.

===Second Period===

The rise of Napoleon III during the 1850s caused a further invasion scare, and a Royal Commission was set up in 1859 to investigate the defences of Britain. As a result, more work was deemed necessary at the Heights, and the Drop Redoubt had its defences improved. Caponiers were added to four of the corners of the existing fort (each with a stone staircase leading up to the top of the Redoubt), and gunrooms were built alongside two of them to allow fire along the North and South-East Lines. The original magazine was enlarged, and covered with a large earth bank as protection from mortar-fire.

The Officers’ Quarters, Guardroom, and cells also date from this period. They can be distinguished from the earlier work by the semi-circular shape of their arches.

During World War II, the Redoubt housed a squad of commandos that, in the event of invasion, would have been responsible for destroying Dover Harbour. Their presence was secret and the lines around the Redoubt were mined. Evidence of their stay are the sally ports in Caponiers 1 &amp; 2, and the short tunnel leading from the encircling line to Drop Redoubt Road.

The entrance to Drop Redoubt was via a bridge. The inner third of this was pivoted so that the Redoubt could be isolated. The pivot and the recess into which the bridge swung can still be seen, although the bridge has long since gone. In the 1980s, a temporary scaffolding bridge was built by the army to enable access for guided tours of the Redoubt, but this was removed in the middle 1990s to prevent unauthorised entry and vandalism.

===The Armaments===
Originally, the Redoubt was to be equipped with 12 smooth bore 24-pounder guns and two carronades. However, it is unlikely that many were installed since the Napoleonic War was almost over by the time construction was completed. In 1851, only three 24-pounders were in place, with six 12-pounder saluting guns and an 8&quot; mortar.

Following the Second Period, eleven Armstrong 64-pounder Rifled Breech Loaders were installed on traversing carriages. These proved unsatisfactory and a return was made to muzzle loaders.

The artillery at the Redoubt faced mostly inland; it was intended to attack an invading force attempting to capture Dover from the rear.

==Earthworks, bastions and gates==
As part of the first rebuilding, from 1804 onwards, a series of earthworks (ramparts and ditches) were constructed: the North Lines, running along the ridge between the Citadel and Drop Redoubt; the South Lines, descending from the Citadel to the Old Folkestone Road (where a bridge across the defensive ditch provided access to the fortress, by way of the South Military Road, as well as to the harbour beyond); and the North-East Line, running east from the Drop Redoubt.

During the building of the defensive lines (1809-16) a tiered bulwark, the &#x27;North-West Bastion&#x27;, was built on the edge of the Citadel flanking the northern slope of the Heights. At the same time the &#x27;North-Centre Bastion&#x27; was built, halfway along the earthworks between the Citadel and Drop Redoubt. As part of the construction of the North Lines a North Entrance was built, between the Drop Redoubt and North Centre Bastion, giving access to the Heights by way of the North Military Road.

After 1858, a further &#x27;Detached Bastion&#x27; was built immediately to the north of the North Centre Bastion (which was itself rebuilt and strengthened), to the designs of Captain Edmund Du Cane. (The bastions enabled flanking fire (by both muskets and artillery) along the length of the North Line.) At the same time, the Citadel was extended to the west (the &#x27;Western Outworks&#x27;) with further casemated barracks provided within the new ramparts. Also at this time, following the Royal Commission of 1859, the North and South Lines were strengthened and the North-East Line rebuilt on a different alignment, more effectively closing off that end of the site between the Drop Redoubt and the cliffs. Furthermore, the North Entrance was rebuilt and strengthened (necessitated by the rebuilding of the Lines); it was approached by way of a twisting path through the tenaille and lifting and falling bridges across the ditches. A new South Entrance was also provided to the south (built where the South Military Road crossed a new extension to the South Lines, close to the junction with Citadel Road). Also known as Archcliffe Gate, this monumental stone gatehouse was demolished in the 1960s.

As well as helping protect the Heights from landward attack, the earthworks served to enclose a sizeable area of land (lying between the Citadel and the Redoubt, the North Lines and the escarpments to the south and east. This could accommodate a large body of troops accommodated in tents; it continued to be used for large-scale parades and assemblies of troops prior to embarkation during the First World War.

==Barracks==
To supplement the soldiers&#x27; accommodation in the casemates of the Redoubt, construction was begun in October 1804 on a separate barracks (later known as Grand Shaft Barracks), designed by Twiss to accommodate 700 men, on land between the Redoubt and the cliff to the south. Towards the cliff, the ground was levelled to create a parade ground; behind it, stepped terraces were created in the slope up the hill on which were built three parallel ranges of three- and four-storey barracks blocks: first (facing the parade ground) were a pair of blocks, one for soldiers, one for officers; then, on the next terrace up, was a longer block for soldiers plus a small block for Staff Sergeants; then, above that, was the Field Officers&#x27; quarters. (Further terraces beyond later accommodated a gymnasium and stables). Access to the terraces was provided by a long flight of steps rising from the far left corner of the parade ground (as viewed from the cliff top). The right-hand side of the parade ground was enclosed by the Officers&#x27; Mess, whilst a Canteen (later termed &#x27;Regimental Institute&#x27;) was built facing it, on the left-hand side; the remaining side of the parade ground was left open (providing a clear view across the harbour from the cliff top). Ancillary buildings were sited on further terraces above and beyond the Canteen (ranged along the left-hand side of the flight of steps); further buildings were added in the 1860s, including additional married quarters.

Barrack accommodation on Western Heights was further increased by the building of another barracks to the south-west, South Front Barracks, in the 1860s. In contrast to the Grand Shaft Barracks, which had come to be seen as vulnerable due to technological advances in artillery, the accommodation at South Front Barracks was mainly built within bomb-proof casemates within the ditch of the southern defensive line (which was constructed at the same time above Archcliffe Fort). Between these casemated barracks and the Citadel Road, married quarters and ancillary buildings were provided, on a series of three stepped terraces built into the hillside. The casemated barracks had accommodation for 400 soldiers and the married quarters accommodated a further 120 married soldiers with their families. While the married quarters continued to be occupied in the 20th century, by 1912 the casemates were no longer in use as barracks, serving instead as offices for the Royal Garrison Artillery.

To the west of the Grand Shaft Barracks (across the Centre Road, close to the North Gate) a number of buildings were added in the 1860s to serve the whole Western Heights garrison, including a Garrison Chapel and School. A Military Hospital had already been built to the south in 1804–06; extended in the 1860s, it latterly served as a headquarters for the Royal Engineers. These garrison buildings, along with both the Grand Shaft Barracks and South Front Barracks, were almost entirely demolished in the 1960s.

===The Grand Shaft===

To assist with the movement of troops between the Heights and the town defences and harbour, Twiss made his case for building the Grand Shaft in the cliff, adjacent to the barracks parade ground:

‘...the new barracks...are little more than 300 yards horizontally from the beach...and about above high-water mark, but in order to communicate with them from the centre of town, on horseback the distance is nearly a mile and a half and to walk it about three-quarters of a mile, and all the roads unavoidably pass over ground more than above the barracks, besides the footpaths are so steep and chalky that a number of accidents will unavoidably happen during the wet weather and more especially after floods. I am therefore induced to recommend the construction of a shaft, with a triple staircase... chief objective of which is the convenience and safety of troops...and may eventually be useful in sending reinforcements to troops or in affording them a secure retreat.’

Twiss&#x27;s plan was approved and building went ahead. The resulting shaft was in diameter, deep with a gallery connecting the bottom of the shaft to Snargate Street, and all for under an estimated £4000.

The plan entailed building two brick-lined shafts, one inside the other. In the outer would be built a triple staircase, the inner acting as a light well with ‘windows’ cut in its outer wall to illuminate the staircases. Apparently, by March 1805 only of the connecting gallery was left to dig and it is probable that the project was completed by 1807.

==Coast Artillery batteries==

In the 1850s a gun battery was built, as part of Dover&#x27;s coast artillery defences, on the slope below Drop Redoubt. Known as the Drop Battery, it was designed with emplacements for eight 8-inch guns. Within ten years, however, construction of the North-East Line of fortification (extending south from the Redoubt) had blocked part of the battery&#x27;s field of fire. Therefore, in the 1870s the Drop Battery was replaced by another gun battery further to the south-west: St Martin&#x27;s Battery; it had three gun emplacements (designed to accommodate 10-inch RMLs) with ammunition stores in between them. In 1898 a further gun emplacement, the Citadel Battery, was built at the far end of the Western Outworks of the Citadel (the westernmost extremity of the site). It was designed for three 9.2 inch Mark X BL guns. Another battery was built at the same time to the south (South Front Battery), but it was short-lived. By this time the guns on St Martin&#x27;s Battery were obsolete and it remained out of commission until World War II, when it was re-armed with three 6-inch BL guns. The Citadel Battery, on the other hand, remained operational until the dismantling of Britain&#x27;s coast artillery network in 1956.

==Older features==
===The Western Pharos===

On top of the Redoubt are the remains of a Roman Pharos, or lighthouse, which complemented the one that still exists in the grounds of Dover Castle. Both date from the 2nd Century AD, and would have been similar in design lighting the cliffs either side of the Roman Port of Dubris. The remains were lost during the first period of construction, but were re-discovered during the second period and restored to their original position as a rather shapeless lump of masonry. The foundations, though, are present in the room immediately below.

Local names for the remains of the Pharos are the ‘Bredenstone’ or the ‘Devil’s Drop of Mortar’, and it was here, until 1804, that the Lords Warden of the Cinque Ports had their installation ceremony. It is likely that the name ‘Drop Redoubt’ originates from the local name given to the ruins of the Pharos.

===Knights Templar Church===

Between The Citadel and Drop Redoubt are the ruins of an 11th-century church with a round nave.

==Today==
Today, much of the site is open as a country park. The barracks have been demolished.

The Citadel, formerly a young offenders&#x27; institution, was most recently used as the Dover Immigration Removal Centre, and so was off-limits until at least November 2015 when the centre was closed down. Many of the Citadel&#x27;s original buildings remain preserved within. In 2018 the freehold site was put up for sale.

English Heritage owns the Redoubt; the Grand Shaft spiral staircase is owned by the council, and is annually opened by the Western Heights Preservation Society.

The Grand Shaft Bowl, located south of Drop Redoubt, is the proposed location for the new , which will commemorate, by name, all of the British Commonwealth casualties of World War I and World War II.

The Grand Shaft Barracks was the location for the filming of the post-nuclear attack scenes in the Peter Watkins 1965 film; &quot;The War Game&quot;.

<doc id="1017018" wikidata="Q153150" url="?curid=1017018" title="Agrippa (crater)">
<text>Agrippa is a lunar impact crater that is located at the southeast edge of the Mare Vaporum. It is located to the north of the crater Godin, the irregular Tempel lies just to the east. To the north and northeast, the rille designated Rima Ariadaeus follows a course to the east-southeast, reaching the western edge of Mare Tranquillitatis. It is named after the 1st century Greek astronomer Agrippa.

The rim of Agrippa has an unusual shape, resembling the form of a shield with a rounded southern rim and a more angular northern half. The interior is somewhat irregular, with a central rise at the midpoint. The crater is from the Eratosthenian period, which lasted from 3.2 to 1.1 billion years ago.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Agrippa. Agrippa B is to the north, Agrippa D and G are further west, Agrippa E is nearly northwest which is attached to another satellite crater Agrippa S, Agrippa F is not far to the east and Agrippa H is north-northeast touching the main crater.

<text>The Saar (; ) is a river in northeastern France and western Germany, and a right tributary of the Moselle. It rises in the Vosges mountains on the border of Alsace and Lorraine and flows northwards into the Moselle near Trier. It has two headstreams (the &quot;Sarre Rouge&quot; and &quot;Sarre Blanche&quot;, which join in Lorquin), that both start near Mont Donon, the highest peak of the northern Vosges. After (129 kilometres; 80 miles in France and on the French-German border, and 117 kilometres; 73 miles in Germany) the Saar flows into the Moselle at Konz (Rhineland-Palatinate) between Trier and the Luxembourg border. It has a catchment area of .
The Saar flows through the following departments of France, states of Germany and towns:
*Moselle (F): Abreschviller (Sarre Rouge), Lorquin, Sarrebourg, Fénétrange
*Bas-Rhin (F): Sarre-Union
*Moselle (F): Sarralbe, Sarreguemines
*Saarland (D): Saarbrücken, Völklingen, Wadgassen, Bous, Saarlouis, Dillingen, Merzig
*Rhineland-Palatinate (D): Saarburg, Konz.
On the banks of the Saar is the UNESCO-World Heritage Site Völklinger Hütte. At Mettlach the Saar passes the well-known Saar loop. The lower Saar in Rhineland-Palatinate is a winegrowing region of some importance, producing mostly Riesling. Until the early 20th century, much more wine was grown on the banks of the Saar, reaching much further up from the mouth of the river, up to Saarbrücken. Only in the early 21st century have some enterprising farmers from the Saarland area started experimenting with winegrowing again.

The name Saar stems from the Celtic word sara (streaming water), and the Roman name of the river, saravus.

==Tributaries==
Tributaries of the Saar are, from source to mouth:

==Navigation==
In 2001, the lowermost section from the confluence of Saar and Moselle at Konz up to the city of Saarbrücken was upgraded for navigation with Class Vb ships. Since then, goods can be transported in northbound direction, for instance, to the sea port of Rotterdam. In its middle section, the Saar had been made navigable in 1866 and was used for the transport of coal (upstream) and of iron ore (downstream) in southbound direction. The section between Saarbrücken and Sarreguemines is navigable for smaller Class I ships. At Sarreguemines the Canal de la Sarre (also navigable for Class I ships) connects the Saar since 1866 with the Marne–Rhine Canal at Gondrexange.
