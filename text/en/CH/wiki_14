<text>Bruce Neal Froemming (; born September 28, 1939) is an American Major League Baseball Special Assistant to the Vice President on Umpiring, after having served as an umpire in Major League Baseball. He first umpired in the National League in 1971, and from 2000 to 2007 worked throughout both major leagues. Early in the 2007 season, Froemming tied Bill Klem for the most seasons umpired (Klem&#x27;s final season, 1941, included only 11 games as a substitute). Previously, on August 16, 2006, Froemming umpired his 5,000th game between the Detroit Tigers and Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, making him the second umpire to reach that milestone; Klem retired after 5,374 games. Froemming now stands third on the all-time list of games umpired, having been passed when Joe West officiated his 5,164th Major League Baseball game on August 14, 2019. On April 20, 2007, he umpired at first base in the Cleveland Indians-Tampa Bay Devil Rays game, passing Klem to become – at age 67 years 204 days – the man then believed to be the oldest umpire in major league history; Hank O&#x27;Day holds the record, retiring at 68 years, 2 months. He worked his final regular-season game at age 68 years 2 days on September 30, 2007, when Froemming received a standing ovation before umpiring his last regular-season game, manning the third base position as the Milwaukee Brewers hosted the San Diego Padres at Miller Park in his native Milwaukee, with much of his family in attendance. Because Froemming was then over age 65, he became eligible for election to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2010 instead of having to wait the customary five years.

==Career==
After a brief semi-pro playing career, Froemming became the youngest umpire in professional baseball in 1958 at age 18, working his way up through the minor leagues to the Pacific Coast League before joining the NL staff in April 1971. While in the minor leagues, his work had caught the attention of skilled observers such as Hall of Famer Jocko Conlan. Froemming became one of the NL&#x27;s six crew chiefs in 1988. He also refereed high school basketball games, and was recommended for the NBA by Al McGuire, but declined the opportunity when NL umpire Al Barlick helped him in his advancement to the major leagues. In Froemming&#x27;s first season, he was on Barlick&#x27;s crew. In Barlick&#x27;s first season, 1941, he worked three games with Klem.

Froemming worked in five World Series: 1976, 1984, 1988, 1990 (Games 3–4) and 1995. He umpired in the League Championship Series in 1973, 1977, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1997 and 2000, all in the NL. With his tenth appearance in the LCS in 2000, he broke the record he had previously shared with Doug Harvey; Jerry Crawford tied the record in 2003, and broke it with his 11th LCS in 2005. (Froemming and Crawford share the record of 10 NLCS, as two of Crawford&#x27;s 12 were in the American League.)

Froemming also officiated in a record nine Division Series: 1981 (East Division), 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2007 (all but the last in the NL). He was the home plate umpire for the playoff games to determine the NL wild-card team in both 1998 and 1999. He also umpired in the All-Star Game in 1975 (played at County Stadium in his hometown of Milwaukee), 1986, and 2007, calling balls and strikes for the last two contests.

In the 2003 NLDS, Froemming surpassed Klem&#x27;s record of working in 103 career postseason games (all Klem&#x27;s games were in the World Series), ending the series with 107 games; Jerry Crawford passed him with 108 games upon working in the 2006 ALCS, but Froemming regained the record in the 2007 ALDS. In Game 1 of the 2012 World Series, Gerry Davis (also a native of Wisconsin) surpassed Froemming&#x27;s record when he worked his 112th postseason game.

Froemming ended his career having officiated in 22 World Series games, 52 NLCS games, and 37 Division Series games—a total of 111 postseason games; he also umpired in 5,163 regular season games, and three MLB All-Star Games.

Froemming was known for his extremely loud and enthusiastic strike call. He wore uniform number 6 beginning in the late 1970s, and kept the number when the umpiring staffs of the AL and NL were merged in 2000. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; sports editor Bill Dwyre described him as &quot;one of the game&#x27;s true characters and legends,&quot; also calling him the prototypical umpire: &quot;If Hollywood did a movie, they&#x27;d send 27 yuppies to study him. Often regarded as stern and stubborn, Froemming nonetheless occasionally displayed a sense of humor; when Fox Sports wired umpires with microphones for broadcasts of Saturday games in 2007, Froemming looked toward the huge baseball glove beyond AT&amp;T Park&#x27;s outfield wall and wondered aloud whether Fox analyst Eric Karros had ever hit a ball that far.

For his final season, Froemming&#x27;s crew included Brian Runge, the son of Paul Runge, who served on the NL staff from 1973 to 1997; Froemming has recalled that he used to baby-sit for Brian.

Froemming was also associated with the Joe Brinkman umpire school in Cocoa, Florida, which was renamed the Brinkman/Froemming umpire school several years prior to its closing in 1998.

==Memorable games==
Froemming was the plate umpire (wearing number 16) when Milt Pappas was going for a perfect game on September 2, 1972, against the San Diego Padres, but made a ball four call on the 27th batter, Larry Stahl, which cost Pappas the perfect game, though he still pitched a no-hitter. The call remains controversial.

Froemming was the first base umpire (wearing number 5) when he ejected New York Yankees manager Billy Martin in Game Four of the 1976 World Series in the top of the ninth inning, the first World Series managerial ejection since Earl Weaver was tossed by umpire Shag Crawford in the 1969 World Series.

Froemming is reviled in Philadelphia for a call in the 1977 National League Championship Series. In Game 3 of the series, the Philadelphia Phillies led the Los Angeles Dodgers by a run with two outs in the ninth with Manny Mota on third. Davey Lopes hit a smash that struck third baseman Mike Schmidt in the knee and caromed to shortstop Larry Bowa, who fired to first. Lopes was called safe, and the Dodgers went on to win the game and the series in four games.

On September 26, 1981, he was behind the plate for Nolan Ryan&#x27;s record 5th no-hitter.

Froemming worked his first perfect game as the first base umpire for Dennis Martinez&#x27;s perfect game on July 28, 1991. 

On April 6, 2001, Froemming was the home plate umpire for the first game at Miller Park in his hometown of Milwaukee.

On September 3, 2001, Froemming was the second base umpire for the no-hitter pitched by Bud Smith of the St. Louis Cardinals. That game marked the record 11th time he had umpired in an official no-hitter having previously shared the record of 10 with Silk O&#x27;Loughlin, Paul Pryor and Jim McKean. He also umpired in a near no-hitter on July 26, 1991, two days prior to Martinez&#x27;s perfect game. Montreal&#x27;s Mark Gardner held the Dodgers without a hit for nine innings before he and Jeff Fassero surrendered three hits in the 10th inning. The game was once considered an official no-hitter prior to rule clarification in 1991, and the MLB no longer recognizes games of nine hitless innings as no-hitters if hits are given up in extra innings.

On July 24, 2004, he was the plate umpire in the famous game between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox that involved a brawl initiated by Jason Varitek&#x27;s punch of Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez which resulted in both players getting ejected by Froemming.

On June 28, 2007, Froemming was at first base when Toronto Blue Jay Frank Thomas hit his 500th career home run off Minnesota Twins pitcher Carlos Silva. Later in the game, Thomas was ejected by plate umpire Mark Wegner for arguing balls and strikes, with Toronto manager John Gibbons also getting thrown out.

==Controversy==
A commanding presence on the field who was fined by National League and Major League Baseball on more than one occasion for his public comments and behavior, Froemming has acknowledged that &quot;the one moment I would take back if I could&quot; was in January 2003 when he referred to an umpire administrator as a &quot;stupid Jew bitch&quot; during a dispute over a relatively minor conflict over travel arrangements to Japan; the comment was made at the end of a voicemail message, apparently after Froemming thought the call had ended. He was given a 10-day suspension without pay for the incident, which he accepted after making a public apology. Froemming was also fined in 1996 for going into the Los Angeles Dodgers&#x27; clubhouse before a game in New York against the Mets to get Mike Piazza&#x27;s autograph. Froemming told Piazza that catcher Johnny Bench refused to sign baseballs for him once and proceeded to go 0 for 4 that day with three strikeouts.

New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner blamed Froemming for not delaying Game 2 of the 2007 American League Division Series between the Yankees and the Cleveland Indians, in which an infestation of Lake Erie gnats swarmed around Yankees reliever Joba Chamberlain, who afterward lost a 1–0 lead in the 8th inning.

Froemming was calling balls and strikes on September 2, 1972, when Cubs pitcher Milt Pappas had a perfect game with two outs and a 1–2 count in the ninth inning before walking the 27th batter (pinch-hitter Larry Stahl); Pappas then completed the no-hitter, but later criticized Froemming for wasting his chance at immortality. The umpire notes, &quot;It&#x27;s gotten ugly now. Right after the game, he said the 3–2 pitch had missed, but as time has gone on, that pitch has gotten better and better.&quot;

<doc id="1012717" wikidata="Q727733" url="?curid=1012717" title="Francisco Ascaso">
<text>Francisco Ascaso Abadía (1 April 1901 – 20 July 1936) was an Aragonese carpenter and prominent anarcho-syndicalist figure in Spain.

Ascaso lived a life of crime and violence being involved in the deaths of multiple high-profile government officials and as a result frequently detained. By the time of the Spanish Civil War, he had created and been involved in numerous anarchist operations and organizations alongside his close friend Buenaventura Durruti. He was killed during the civil war. Ascaso was the cousin of Joaquín Ascaso, the President of the Regional Defence Council of Aragon.

==Anarchism==
In 1922 or 1923, Ascaso would meet Juan Garcia Oliver and Buenaventura Durruti, and soon form the Los Solidarios in response to the execution of the anarchist Francisco Ferrer. The group would become involved in the deaths in many prominent leaders of the time such as Spanish Prime Minister Eduardo Dato. Ascaso and Durruti would soon begin a lifelong friendship. Ascaso was drawn to Durruti for their shared disdain for the &quot;bolshevization&quot;, bureaucracy and false hoods&quot; of the Russian Revolution.

Ascaso and Oliver soon moved to Manresa in order to avoid detection from police. Upon arriving they were imprisoned on suspected drug trafficking. Although they were capable of convincing the police captain that they were just there to file papers for legal emigration and therefore avoided incarceration. While living in Manresa, Ascaso learned of Durruti&#x27;s arrest and trial. He would gather the funds of the Los Solidarios and travel to San Sebastián hoping to aid Durruti in achieving a pardon however this would not happen. Ascaso and Oliver decided that to remain within Manresa would be unwise and so moved to Zaragoza. Ascaso and Oliver become embroiled in a conspiracy to assassinate then Archbishop of Zaragoza Juan Soldevila y Romero which they would successfully execute on 23 June 1923.

Ascaso was arrested for his involvement however he escaped prison with the aid of Durruti and In June 1923, Ascaso and Durruti fled to France in protest of the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, Eduardo Dato&#x27;s successor and then Prime Minister of Spain. Ascaso and Durruti would go onto support the Revolutionary Committee in France at the time as a way of &quot;organizing a revolutionary center in France&quot;. Ascaso&#x27;s method of organization also included the gathering of comrades and arms to further their ideals. In late December, 1924, Ascaso and Durruti were informed of the Revolutionary Committee&#x27;s dire financial situation and so were instructed to travel to Latin America which they promptly did with the intention of collecting funds.

Ascaso and Durruti spent time in the Caribbean Island, Havana at the house of a young libertarian, J.A. J.A would often engage with Ascaso and Durruti on the topic of anarchism, encouraging them to spread anarchist theory, Ascaso and Durruti ― who believed that propaganda was a necessary element of anarchism ― agreed. They soon left Havana fearing harassment from the police. In late March 1925 Ascaso and Durruti were seeking refuge in Mexico City however soon left, feeling guilty over living in a luxury hotel juxtaposed to the poor neighborhoods. By late February 1926 Ascaso set off to Europe specifically, France. They arrived on 30 April 1926.

On 25 June 1926 Ascaso was arrested by French Police, sentenced to six months, with intent to harm the King of Spain who was visiting France at the time. Upon being arrested Ascaso alongside Durruti and Jover Cortes were informed that they would be handed over to the Argentina government. An initiative entitled the Durruti-Ascaso-Jover Asylum Support Committee by The Anarcho-Communist Union was formed intending for the three men&#x27;s release. They staged protests and hunger strikes against the police. Although the French government remained firm in their goals. While negotiating for their delivery talks began to become troublesome with both governments accusing each other of negligence. After a period of time the talks fell through and by 27 May 1927 all three men were freed and deported to Belgium.

In November 1927 Ascaso and Durruti arrived in Lyon, France. In January 1928 Ascaso and Durruti traveled to Paris for the purpose of meeting with Joaquín Cortés as well as anarchist groups of the time. They were soon arrested upon arrival &quot;infractions of the law on foreigners&quot;. They were sentenced to six months and were released in early October 1928 and arrived in Berlin by Late October. The two men lived with Augustin Souchy. Soon Paul Kampfmeyer, a former anarchist and member of the Berlin Social Democratic party who had previously aided anarchists Nestor Makhno and Emma Goldman escape Russia, came in contact with the two men aiming to provide them with residency permits. During their time in Berlin fear of arrest was omnipresent so the men began to plan leaving. Ascaso returned to Spain by 1931. He returned from a deportation to Africa in 1932 to become an editor of Solidaridad Obrera (Workers&#x27; Solidarity) and secretary of the Catalan CNT. He supported CNT militias and opposed political alliances with organizations.

During the Spanish Civil War, while living in Barcelona, Ascaso would form the Antifascist Militias Committee. Ascaso alongside Durruti and the CNT would attack army depots and the prison ship &quot;Uruguay&quot; with home-made grenades and improvised armoured cars. Ascaso was one of the 500 to die in the assault of Atarazanas barracks. Ascaso was buried in Montjuïc Cemetery alongside Durruti.

== Legacy ==
He was remembered as a &quot;saint&quot; of anarchist movement and as a hero of the Catalan proletariat.

==Personal life==
Ascaso&#x27;s was the brother of fellow anarchists Alejandro Ascaso and Domingo Ascaso who all frequently worked together. Alejandro was born on 17 October 1889. Domingo was killed in Barcelona during the 1937 May Riots. He also had a sister named Maria. In 1927 he started a relationship with Berthe Fabert. In 1924 Ascaso settled in Paris and worked in a plumbing factory which aggravated his respiratory problems.

<text>Terrance Lee Labonte (born November 16, 1956), nicknamed &quot;Texas Terry&quot; or &quot;the Iceman&quot;, is an American former stock car driver. He raced from 1978 to 2014 in the former NASCAR Winston Cup and Sprint Cup Series (now called the NASCAR Cup Series). A two-time Cup Series champion in 1984 and 1996 and the 1989 IROC champion, he is the older brother of 2000 Cup Series champion Bobby Labonte, and the father of former Nationwide Series driver Justin Labonte. He also co-owns a Chevrolet dealership in Greensboro, North Carolina with Rick Hendrick. He appeared on the CBS series &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; in 1984, where he played an unnamed pit crew member.

== Early life ==
Terry Labonte was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, in 1956. He was introduced to racing at an early age through his father, who had worked on race cars as a hobby for his friends. He started racing quarter midgets when he was seven and won a national championship at nine before moving onto the local short tracks in a stock car as a teenager. He graduated from Mary Carroll High School in 1975. Driving on both dirt and asphalt, he won track championships in his hometown, in Houston, and in San Antonio between 1975 and 1977. During this time he also met Louisiana businessman Billy Hagan.

==Racing career==
=== Hagan Racing ===
Labonte’s first NASCAR race came in 1978 at Darlington Raceway. He qualified 19th in the No. 92 Duck Industries-sponsored Chevrolet and finished fourth that weekend. He ran four more races that season and had an additional two Top 10 finishes. In 1979, he competed for NASCAR Winston Cup Rookie of the Year honors along with Dale Earnhardt, Harry Gant, and Joe Millikan while driving the No. 44 Stratagraph-sponsored Chevrolet for Hagan. Although Labonte failed to win the top rookie award, he was one of three rookies to finish in the Top 10 in points. He ended the season with 13 Top 10 finishes. The following year, he won his first career Winston Cup race on Labor Day weekend at Darlington. He won $222,501 in prize money for the year and finished eighth in the final points standings. 

Labonte failed to return to victory lane over the next two years but didn&#x27;t finish outside the Top 5 in the final standings. He won his second career race in 1983 in the Budweiser-sponsored Chevrolet. In 1984, his team received a sponsorship from Piedmont Airlines and he won races at Riverside International Raceway and Bristol Motor Speedway as well as clinching his first Winston Cup championship. He dropped to seventh in the final points in 1985. During that season, he made his Busch Series debut at Charlotte in the No. 17 Pontiac owned by Darrell Waltrip and won the race. Waltrip asked Labonte to drive after deciding to focus his driving priorities solely on Winston Cup racing during what would be Waltrip&#x27;s 307-point gain over Bill Elliott in the final eight races of the 1985 season.

=== Junior Johnson &amp; Associates ===

Labonte fell back to twelfth in the standings in 1986. Before season&#x27;s end, he announced he was leaving Hagan&#x27;s team to drive the No. 11 Budweiser-sponsored Chevrolet for Junior Johnson&#x27;s team beginning the following year. In his first season with this team, he earned four pole-positions and won the Holly Farms 400, leaping up to third in the final standings. He followed that up with a fourth-place points finish in 1988, as well as The Winston. In 1989, the team switched to Ford Thunderbirds. Despite two wins during the season, he fell back to tenth in the championship.

=== Precision Products Racing ===
In 1990, he signed with Leo Jackson&#x27;s Precision Products Racing team to drive the No. 1 Skoal Classic-sponsored Oldsmobile. He had four Top 5s and nine Top 10s and finished 15th in the points standings.

Terry Labonte scrapped plans for 1990 to run a self-owned independent team, because he couldn&#x27;t land a full sponsorship, the News-Record of Greensboro, N.C. reported in 1990, and he signed to the Precision Products Racing team.

=== Return to Hagan Racing ===
Labonte came back to Hagan Racing to drive the No. 94 Sunoco-sponsored Oldsmobile in 1991, winning his first pole since 1988. He began 1992 with finishes inside the Top 8 in each of the first eight races. He had a total of four Top 5 finishes and 16 Top 10 finishes, ending the season eighth in points. In 1993, the team switched to the No. 14 Kellogg&#x27;s-sponsored Chevrolet. While he had ten Top 10s, for the first time in his career, Labonte failed to finish a race in the Top 5 and he dropped to 18th in points.

On July 1, 1993, it was announced that Terry Labonte would be leaving Hagan Racing following 1993 to drive for Hendrick Motorsports in 1994.

=== Hendrick Motorsports ===
After leaving Hagan Racing in 1993, Terry Labonte was signed to Hendrick Motorsports in 1994, where he began driving the No. 5 Kellogg&#x27;s-sponsored Chevrolet Lumina. In 1995, the team switched to Chevrolet Monte Carlos and won three races including the fall Goody&#x27;s 500 event at Bristol, where the front of Labonte&#x27;s car was wrecked after Dale Earnhardt crashed into him in the final lap. In 1996, he broke Richard Petty’s streak for consecutive races after winning at North Wilkesboro. Despite only two victories, Labonte went on to win the championship, a record-setting twelve years after his first. Driving with a broken hand during the last two races of the season, Labonte and his younger brother Bobby were able to perform a dual victory lap at Atlanta Motor Speedway in the last race of the season; Bobby won the race and Terry won the championship on this race, making it the only time a driver and his sibling won the race and the championship at the same time.

Labonte posted 20 Top 10 finishes in 1997 and collected his only win of the season at the fall race at Talladega Superspeedway. In 1998, it was the final season to have Labonte&#x27;s trademark mustache, where he went on to win the Pontiac Excitement 400 and finished ninth in points. With a win at his home track at Texas Motor Speedway and in the Sprint All-Star Race XV in 1999, Labonte finished 12th in points, the first time he had finished outside the Top 10 since 1993.

Labonte shaved his mustache off in 1999, where his most famous race was the 1999 Goody&#x27;s Headache Powder 500 at Bristol. He was involved in one of the most infamous and controversial NASCAR finishes ever, when he was spun out by a lapped Darrell Waltrip while leading with ten laps to go when he slowed the field under caution. Labonte pitted for four tires and quickly recovered and was leading with one lap remaining. However, Dale Earnhardt, who was in second at the time, wrecked Labonte half-way to the checkered flag and won. Labonte finished eighth while wrecking. In victory lane, Dale Earnhardt maintained that it wasn&#x27;t on purpose. In a post-race interview, Labonte didn&#x27;t buy Earnhardt&#x27;s excuses, angrily stating &quot;[Earnhardt] never intends to take anybody out...it just happens that way.&quot;

The 2000 season saw Labonte&#x27;s consecutive start streak broken at 655 after he suffered inner ear injuries in the Pepsi 400 and was forced to miss the Brickyard 400 and the Global Crossing @ The Glen. 2000 was also his first winless season since 1993. His younger brother Bobby won that year&#x27;s championship. He began 2001 with two Top 6 finishes in the first seven races but continued to fall in the points standings. Labonte’s trademark mustache returned mid-season but his fortunes did not change, eventually finishing the 2001 season in 23rd place. Even though he dropped back to 24th in 2002 with one Top 5 finish and four Top 10&#x27;s, 2002 marked a definite turning point for Labonte with the appointment of veteran crew chief, Jim Long, to the team. 

In 2003, Labonte won his first pole since 2000 at Richmond and won the Mountain Dew Southern 500 where 23 years earlier he won his first in 1980 at Darlington Raceway after leading the last 33 laps. This was only his second win in a crown jewel event (the other being in the Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway in 1980). That helped lead him to a tenth place spot in points. About 90% of the NASCAR fans have labeled the 2003 Southern 500 win as the most popular win of 2003.

The 2004 season was much more of a struggle for Labonte, and Hendrick Motorsports announced Kyle Busch as Labonte&#x27;s replacement when he retired. Late in the 2004-season, Labonte announced that 2004 would be his final full-time year on the circuit and would run part-time schedules for the next two years. The part-time schedule was nicknamed &quot;Shifting Gears: Lone Star Style&quot;.

===Semi-retirement years===
==== Hendrick Motorsports ====

Labonte began his semi-retirement in 2005. He borrowed the number 44, his former number, from Petty Enterprises and ran Hendrick&#x27;s No. 44 research and development car with some sponsorships from Kellogg&#x27;s, Pizza Hut, and GMAC. His best finish in 2005 for Hendrick Motorsports came at Pocono Raceway, where he finished twelfth.

Labonte also ran ten races with Hendrick Motorsports research and development car No. 44 in 2006.

==== Joe Gibbs Racing ====
Labonte also drove five races in the No. 11 FedEx-sponsored Chevrolet for Joe Gibbs Racing following the release of Jason Leffler, with a top finish of ninth at Richmond.

==== Hall of Fame Racing ====
Labonte began the 2006 season driving the No. 96 Texas Instruments/DLP HDTV-sponsored Chevrolet Monte Carlo car for Hall of Fame Racing, a new team started by former Dallas Cowboys quarterbacks Roger Staubach and Troy Aikman. Labonte&#x27;s past-champion&#x27;s provisional guaranteed the team a starting spot in the first five races. Labonte&#x27;s finishes in those races left the team thirtieth in points, sealing a spot for the team in each race as long as they remained in the top thirty-five. Tony Raines took over the driving duties for the No. 96 car and ran for the rest of the season, with the exception of the road-course races at Infineon Raceway and Watkins Glen International. Labonte&#x27;s best finish of 2006 came at Infineon, where he finished third due to a fuel mileage gamble by Philippe Lopez, the crew chief of the No. 96 DLP/Texas Instruments-sponsored Chevrolet.

==== Michael Waltrip Racing ====
During the 2007 season, Labonte drove three races for Michael Waltrip Racing, both road course events, and the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard, in the No.55 NAPA Auto Parts-sponsored Toyota Camry. His best finish in the No. 55 was thirteenth twice, at Indianapolis and Watkins Glen.

==== Petty Enterprises ====
On May 11, 2008, it was announced that Labonte would drive the No. 45 car of Petty Enterprises for six races in the middle of the 2008 Sprint Cup season, replacing Kyle Petty on a temporary basis. Labonte was reunited with brother Bobby, who was the regular driver of the No. 43 for Petty. Labonte posted two solid top-twenty runs in the six-race tenure, a sixteenth at Daytona and a seventeenth at Infineon, both the best finishes for the #45 car this season. It was later announced that he would drive for Petty again in the Brickyard 400 Labonte was back in the No. 45 car for Petty Enterprises when the Sprint Cup Series went to the Michigan International Speedway for the 3M Performance 400 on August 17, 2008. He would be back in the No. 45 car again for the AMP Energy 500 at the Talladega Superspeedway for the final time in the 2008 Sprint Cup Season. He would go on to post a seventeenth-place finish, even after sustaining severe damage in one of the multi-car accidents. Labonte&#x27;s results in 2008 proved far better on average than the previous three seasons, while driving also part-time.

==== Gillett Evernham Motorsports ====
Labonte drove the #10 Valvoline-sponsored car in place of Patrick Carpentier in The American Red Cross Pennsylvania 500.

==== Prism Motorsports ====
It was reported first on January 23, 2009, that Labonte would attempt to make the Daytona 500 for Prism Motorsports, driving the No. 66 Window World-sponsored Toyota. The team announced they planned to race full-time with Dave Blaney after Daytona. Labonte started forty-third, and went a lap down. He managed to get his lap back and fought up to finish twenty-fourth in the rain-shortened event.

==== Carter/Simo Racing ====
Starting at Indianapolis in 2009, Labonte drove the No. 08 Toyota for Carter/Simo Racing for four races.

==== Stavola Labonte Racing/Prism Motorsports ====
It was reported that Labonte would be forming a new team with Bill Stavola, formerly the co-owner of Stavola Brothers Racing. In the team&#x27;s debut, Labonte barely missed making the field at Richmond, but took the Gander Mountain sponsorship to the No. 55 Prism Motorsports car which had qualified thirty-seventh. Labonte would finish fortieth in the race after an accident forced him out. It is not known for sure what caused the demise of Stavola Labonte Racing, as the team seemed to dissolve sometime after the 2010 season.

==== Whitney Motorsports ====
Labonte also raced at Phoenix in 2010 for Whitney Motorsports.

==== FAS Lane Racing/Go Fas Racing ====

Entering 2011, it was announced that Frank Stoddard would be starting his own team, FAS Lane Racing, with Labonte driving the No. 32 U.S. Chrome-sponsored Ford Fusion in the Daytona 500. Labonte started forty-third and finished a respectable fifteenth. At the time, Labonte was semi-retired, but competed in seven additional races over the course of the year in the No. 32.

He returned to Stoddard&#x27;s 32 car in 2012 where he would run all four restrictor plate races with C&amp;J Energy Services as the sponsor. He finished with three top twenties out of the four starts, including a season-best sixteenth in the October race at Talladega Superspeedway. Labonte led the 2012 Daytona 500 briefly before being spun by Marcos Ambrose. He would continue on to finish eighteenth.

In 2013, Labonte would run five races for FAS Lane Racing, posting a best finish of nineteenth. In addition to running all four restrictor plate races, he ran at Bristol Motor Speedway in March, finishing twenty-fifth.

In 2014, FAS Lane Racing would merge with Go Green Racing to form Go Fas Racing, and announced that Labonte would again return to the No. 32 car for all four superspeedway events. He ran as high as sixth in the Daytona 500 before being swept up in a late crash and finishing twentieth. Before the race, Labonte called this his final Daytona 500 start. At the 2014 Coke Zero 400, his final start at Daytona, he dodged two huge wrecks and finished a solid eleventh place after the race was called 112 laps in due to rain. 

On October 17, Labonte announced the GEICO 500 is to be his 890th and final start. To commemorate the occasion, Go Fas Racing designed a car split into three designs: the Kellogg&#x27;s design from his 1996 title run on the driver side, the Piedmont Airlines design from his 1984 championship year on the passenger side, and the Duck Industries design from his early career in the center. However, NASCAR did not allow the scheme, due to a rule stating cars must have the same colors on both the driver side and passenger side of the car for safety reasons; the team would switch to the former design, while being allowed to retain the center. Labonte qualified ninth, but because of the unapproved paint scheme, was forced to start at the tail end of the field. He would finish in thirty-third place, one lap down in his final race.

==Competition in other series==
In addition to his 22 wins in the Sprint Cup Series, Labonte has won 11 races in the Nationwide Series and 1 in the Craftsman Truck Series, as well as three all-star races: the Busch Clash in 1985 and The Winston (now the Sprint All-Star Challenge) in 1988 and 1999. He also won the IROC championship in 1989 with one win, and assisted the late Davey Allison to the 1993 IROC championship by driving his car to a 6th-place finish in the final race of the season.

Including his two championship seasons, he has finished in the top 10 in the year-end standings 17 times, and his top-five and top-ten totals approach 25 percent and 50 percent, respectively, of his total races. Labonte holds the record for most seasons between championships, with twelve seasons in between his 1984 &amp; 1996 championships.

Labonte also collected class wins at the two most prestigious endurance races in the United States, the 24 Hours of Daytona and 12 Hours of Sebring, driving a GTO-class Chevrolet Camaro during the 1984 IMSA GT Championship season.

==Honors==
===NASCAR Hall of Fame===
On February 21, 2014, Labonte was nominated for the NASCAR Hall of Fame Class of 2015, along with 19 other candidates. This occurred not long after NASCAR revised the rules allowing current drivers eligibility into the Hall provided they are at least 55 years of age or have 30+ years of NASCAR experience.

After being passed over as a first-ballot inductee for the class of 2015, Labonte was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame Class of 2016 on May 20, 2015. Joining Labonte in the 2016 class were Speedway Motorsports Executive Chairman Bruton Smith, and drivers Curtis Turner, Bobby Isaac, and Jerry Cook.

On January 26, 2017 Labonte was named to the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America.

===Other===
In 1998, the senior Labonte was named as one of NASCAR&#x27;s 50 Greatest Drivers. A park was renamed for the Labonte brothers in their hometown of Corpus Christi in 2001, and they were chosen for entry into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 2002. Labonte supports a variety of charities and due to his efforts, the Ronald McDonald House in Corpus Christi, the Victory Junction Gang Camp near Randleman, North Carolina, and the Hendrick Marrow Program all have benefited.

== TV and movie appearances ==
In the 1983 Hal Needham / Burt Reynolds movie &quot;Stroker Ace&quot;, Labonte appeared as himself (but credited as a &quot;NASCAR Driver&quot;), along with many other contemporary drivers.

<text>Momia Juanita (Spanish for &quot;Mummy Juanita&quot;), also known as the Lady of Ampato, is the well-preserved frozen body of a girl from the Inca Empire who was killed as a human sacrifice to the Inca gods sometime between 1440 and 1480, when she was approximately 12–15 years old. She was discovered on the dormant stratovolcano Mount Ampato (part of the Andes cordillera in southern Peru) in 1995 by anthropologist Johan Reinhard and his Peruvian climbing partner, Miguel Zárate. Another of her nicknames, Ice Maiden, derives from the cold conditions and freezing temperatures that preserved her body on Mount Ampato.

Juanita has been on display in the Catholic University of Santa María&#x27;s Museum of Andean Sanctuaries (Museo Santuarios Andinos) in Arequipa, Peru almost continuously since 1996, and was displayed on a tour in Japan in 1999.

In 1995, &quot;Time&quot; magazine chose her as one of the world&#x27;s top ten discoveries. Between May and June 1996, she was exhibited in the headquarters of the National Geographic Society in Washington, D.C., in a specially acclimatized conservation display unit. In its June 1996 issue, &quot;National Geographic&quot; included an article dedicated to the discovery of Juanita.

==Discovery==
In September 1995, during an ascent of Mt. Ampato (), Johan Reinhard and Miguel Zárate found a bundle in the crater that had fallen from an Inca site on the summit due to recent ice melt and erosion from a volcano eruption. To their astonishment, the bundle turned out to contain the frozen body of a young girl. Juanita was found almost entirely frozen, which preserved her internal organs, hair, blood, skin, and contents of her stomach.

They also found many items that had been left as offerings to the Inca gods including llama bones, small figurines and pottery pieces. The items were strewn about the mountain slope, down which the body had fallen. These included statues, food items (maize kernels and cob), and &quot;Spondylus&quot; shells, which originate from ocean ecosystems. These have been connected to rain ceremonies throughout the Incan Empire. The clothing she wore resembled textiles from the elite from Cusco, the Inca capital. As Juanita is the closest discovered sacrifice to Cusco and was found with textiles of the wealthy, archaeologists believe that this could suggest she came from a noble Cusco family.

The body and the items were quickly transported to Arequipa to prevent thawing of the frozen specimen. The body was initially kept in a special refrigerator at the Catholic University. Juanita&#x27;s body was transported to the United States for a CT scan in 1996 and was then exhibited in Japan in 1999. She is considered one of the most well-preserved mummies in the Andes.

Two more ice mummies, a young girl and a boy, were discovered in an archaeological expedition led by Dr. Reinhard and Prof. José Antonio Chávez in October 1995, and they recovered another female mummy on Ampato in December 1997. Volcanic ash from the nearby erupting volcano of Sabancaya induced ice melt in the area, which caused the Incan burial sites to collapse down into a gully or crater where they were soon discovered by Reinhard and his team. Reinhard published a detailed account of the discovery in his 2006 book entitled, &quot;The Ice Maiden: Inca Mummies, Mountain Gods, and Sacred Sites in the Andes&quot;.

==Scientific analysis==

===Body===
As Reinhard and Zárate struggled on Ampato&#x27;s summit to lift the heavy bundle containing Juanita&#x27;s body, they realized that her body mass had probably been increased by freezing of the flesh. When initially weighed in Arequipa, the bundle containing &quot;Juanita&quot; weighed over 90 pounds (40.82 kilos). Their realization turned out to be correct; Juanita is almost entirely frozen, making her a substantial scientific find. Like only a few other high-altitude Inca mummies, Juanita was found frozen and thus her remains and garments were not desiccated like those of mummies found in other parts of the world. She was mummified by freezing conditions on the mountain top, instead of being artificially mummified, as is the case with Egyptian mummies. Her skin, organs, tissues, blood, hair, stomach contents, and garments are extremely well-preserved, offering scientists a rare glimpse into Inca culture during the reign of the Sapa Inca Pachacuti (reigned 1438–1471/1472).

Analysis of her stomach contents revealed that she ate a meal of vegetables six to eight hours before her death. Some evidence suggests that she may have come from a noble Cusco family. Stable isotopic analysis of other child sacrifices in the area has found changes in diet within the last year of life to indicate whether they originated from common families. This is usually indicated by the amount of meat protein consumed. Noble families would consume meat regularly whereas this may not have been the case for a non-noble family. Since there is no specific analysis of Juanita it is inconclusive if she came from a noble family or not. However, analysis of similar child sacrifices in the region all indicate that at six months before their death they were in Cusco, likely for a ceremony before making their journey to the mountains.

===Adornments and grave goods===
Juanita was wrapped in a brightly coloured burial tapestry (or &quot;aksu&quot;). Her head was adorned with a cap made from the feathers of a red macaw, and she wore a lively woollen alpaca shawl fastened with a silver clasp. She was fully clothed in garments resembling the finest textiles from the Inca capital city of Cusco. These accoutrements were almost perfectly preserved, providing valuable insight into sacred Inca textiles and on how the Inca nobility dressed. Found with her in the burial tapestry was a collection of grave goods: bowls, pins, and figurines made of gold, silver, and shell.

===Genetic analysis===
According to the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR), the closest kin they could find in the database in 1996 were the Ngobe people of Panama, but later research has shown her to share genetic patterns found in people from the Andes. Scientists at TIGR examined two mitochondrial DNA D loop sequences and found that Hypervariable region 1 (HV1) was consistent with mitochondrial haplogroup A2, one of the five Native American mitochondrial haplogroups. Hypervariable region 2 (HV2) included a unique sequence not found in any of the current mitochondrial DNA databases. Her haplotype is 16111T, 16223T, 16290T, 16319A.

===Reconstruction of her face===
In Arequipa in October 2023 a team of Polish and Peruvian scientists unveiled a reconstructed silicone bust of her face. Using digital images and scans of her skull and analysis of her DNA to determine her age, facial characteristics and complexion it was created by Swedish archaeologist and sculptor Oscar Nilsson, first in clay before being cast in silicone.

==Preparation for death==
Through extracting DNA from Mummy Juanita&#x27;s well-preserved hair, scientists were able to determine her diet prior to the sacrifice. The analysis of her hair indicated that Juanita was eating foods such as animal protein and maize, which were the diet of the elite, unlike the standard Inca diet of vegetables.

The final six to eight weeks of life for a sacrificed Incan child consisted of heavy use of drugs and alcohol. With a combination of coca and chicha alcohol, the children would be in a highly intoxicated psychological state. Markers in Juanita&#x27;s hair indicate that she was given coca and alcohol prior to her death, suggesting that she was in a state of near unconsciousness.

==Cause of death==
Radiologist Elliot K. Fishman concluded that she was killed by blunt trauma to the head. He observed that her cracked right eye socket and the fracture in her skull are injuries &quot;typical of someone who has been hit by a baseball bat.&quot; The blow caused a massive hemorrhage, filling her skull with blood and pushing her brain to one side. Death by trauma to the head was a common technique of sacrificing children in this era, along with strangulation and suffocation (burying alive).

==Capacocha==
The ritual sacrifice called Capacocha (or Qhapaq hucha) was a key component to the Inca Empire. This ritual, which usually involved the sacrifice of children, was for celebratory events. These events included an annual or biennial event in the Incan calendar, the death of an emperor, the birth of a royal son, or a victory in battle, and were performed to prevent natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, droughts, earthquakes, and epidemics. Beyond celebratory events and sacrifice for prevention, child sacrifice represented military and political expansion for the culture along with the empire&#x27;s ability to use coercion and control.

As tribute payment, Inca rulers ordered boys and girls between the ages of 12 and 16 to sacrifice. Evidence of strontium analysis suggests that children were taken from several different geographical areas, brought to the Inca capital, and then potentially underwent months of travel to the sacred location at which they would be sacrificed. Archaeologists have discovered through biochemical analysis that coca (the primary source of cocaine) and alcohol were commonly found in the children&#x27;s systems. Although archaeologists are unsure of why drugs and alcohol were used, some suggest that it was to put the chosen children in a stupor prior to death.

==Connecting climate and culture==
Juanita was killed as a practice of capacocha, or child sacrifice, to appease Inca gods, or &quot;Apus&quot;. This practice often involves sacrificing a child at a huaca, or ceremonial shrine in a significant spiritual location, in this case Mt. Ampato. Children were selected as they were considered pure beings and worthy of giving to the Inca Gods. Once sacrificed, these children were believed to become messengers to the &quot;Apu(s)&quot; and act as negotiators for the people. The people in turn would worship the sacrificed children alongside worship of the gods. Ceremonial offerings happened annually, seasonally, or upon special occasions.

Juanita and several others were likely sacrificed to appease the gods after volcanic eruptions on the nearby Misti (1440-1450) and Sabancaya (1466) volcanos. Volcanic eruptions cause irregularities in climate that can last between three–five years depending on location and intensity. In these circumstances, precipitation patterns are altered due to particulate presence in the air. These periods are usually indicated by abnormal dryness or wetness. Overall, research has indicated that volcanic eruptions lead to a general trend of drought or less precipitation. Particulate from the explosions can also contaminate water supply and air quality. This is endorsed by Reinhard&#x27;s observations and understandings from the field site: &quot;the sacrifices were made either during a lengthy period of extreme drought, during (or just after) volcanic eruptions or both. Only in such periods could the ground have been unfrozen enough to allow the Incas to build the sites and bury the offerings as they did. And this factor could explain their importance. Droughts and volcanic ash would kill off pasturage and pollute and deplete the water sources so critical to the villagers below&quot;.

It is probable that Juanita was sacrificed in response to climatic irregularities to placate the gods in return for water. Incan belief at the time was that mountains (and their spirits) controlled weather and water and, thus, were intertwined with the villages below. The prosperity of the crops and people depended on the approval of the mountain deity to provide water for their consumption and irrigation. Water is a life-giving source and was perceived to be connected with femininity and fertility. Therefore, the mountains that provided water were attributed to be female deities by the Incas. In Southern Peru, it was believed that sacrificing a young female would appease the mountain deity who would in turn provide a consistent water supply to the region.

Others have suggested that child sacrifice could in part be used as a political strategy by Incan leaders to ensure control over the empire. Sacrifices during this time of empire expansion would infix a combination of respect and fear while further embedding devotion.

<text>In Jainism, a Tirthankara (; ) is a saviour and supreme preacher of the &quot;dharma&quot; (righteous path). The word &quot;tirthankara&quot; signifies the founder of a &quot;tirtha&quot;, a fordable passage across &quot;saṃsāra&quot;, the sea of interminable birth and death. According to Jains, &quot;tirthankaras&quot; are the supreme preachers of &quot;dharma&quot;, who have conquered &quot;saṃsāra&quot; on their own and made a path for others to follow. After understanding the true nature of the self or soul, the &quot;Tīrthaṅkara&quot; attains &quot;kevala jnana&quot; (omniscience). A Tirthankara provides a bridge for others to follow them from &quot;saṃsāra&quot; to &quot;moksha&quot; (liberation).

In Jain cosmology, the wheel of time is divided into two halves, &quot;Utsarpiṇī&quot;, the ascending time cycle, and &quot;avasarpiṇī&quot;, the descending time cycle (said to be current now). In each half of the cycle, exactly 24 &quot;tirthankaras&quot; grace this part of the universe. There have been infinitely many tirthankaras in the past. The first &quot;tirthankara&quot; in the present cycle (Hunda Avsarpini) was Rishabhanatha, who is credited with formulating and organising humans to live in a society harmoniously. The 24th and last &quot;tirthankara&quot; of the present half-cycle was Mahavira (599 BC–527 BC). History records the existence of Mahavira and his predecessor, Parshvanatha, the 23rd &quot;tirthankara&quot;.

A &quot;tirthankara&quot; organises the &quot;sangha&quot;, a fourfold order of male and female monastics, &quot;srāvakas&quot; (male followers) and &quot;śrāvikā&quot;s (female followers).

The &quot;tirthankara&#x27;s&quot; teachings form the basis for the Jain canons. The inner knowledge of &quot;tirthankara&quot; is believed to be perfect and identical in every respect, and their teachings contain no contradictions. The degree of elaboration varies according to society&#x27;s spiritual advancement and purity during their period of leadership. The higher the level of society&#x27;s spiritual advancement and purity of mind, the lower the elaboration required.

While Jains document and revere &quot;tirthankaras&quot;, their grace is said to be available to all living beings regardless of religion.

&quot;Tīrthaṅkaras&quot; are &quot;arihants&quot; who, after attaining &quot;kevala jñāna&quot; (pure infinite knowledge), preach the &quot;dharma&quot;. An &quot;Arihant&quot; is also called &quot;Jina&quot; (victor), one who has conquered inner enemies such as anger, attachment, pride, and greed. They dwell exclusively within the realm of their soul and are entirely free of &quot;kashayas&quot;, inner passions, and personal desires. As a result of this, unlimited &quot;siddhis&quot;, or spiritual powers, are readily available to them, which they use exclusively for living beings&#x27; spiritual elevation. Through &quot;darśana&quot;, divine vision, and &quot;deshna&quot;, divine speech, they help others attain &quot;kevalajñana&quot; and &quot;moksha&quot; (final liberation).

==Meaning==
The word &quot;tirthankara&quot; signifies the founder of a &quot;tirtha&quot;, a fordable passage across &quot;saṃsāra&quot;, the sea of interminable births and deaths. &quot;Tirthankaras&quot; are variously called &quot;Teaching Gods&quot;, &quot;Ford-Makers&quot;, &quot;Crossing Makers&quot;, and &quot;Makers of the River-Crossing&quot;.

== &quot;Tīrthaṅkara-naam-karma&quot; ==

Jain texts propound that a special type of &quot;karma&quot;, the &quot;tīrthaṅkara nama-karma&quot;, raises a soul to the supreme status of a &quot;Tīrthaṅkara&quot;. The &quot;Tattvartha Sutra&quot;, a major Jain text, lists 16 observances that lead to the &quot;bandha&quot; (bondage) of this &quot;karma&quot;:
*Purity of right faith
*Reverence
*Observance of vows and supplementary vows without transgressions
*Ceaseless pursuit of knowledge
*Perpetual fear of the cycle of existence
*Giving gifts (charity)
*Practising austerities according to one&#x27;s capacity
*Removal of obstacles that threaten the equanimity of ascetics
*Serving the meritorious by warding off evil or suffering
*Devotion to omniscient lords, chief preceptors, preceptors, and the scriptures
*Practice of the six essential daily duties
*Propagation of the teachings of the omniscient
*Fervent affection for one&#x27;s brethren following the same path.

== &quot;Panch Kalyanaka&quot; ==
Five auspicious events called &quot;Pañca kalyāṇaka&quot; mark every &quot;tirthankara&quot;&#x27;s life:
# &quot;Chyavana kalyāṇaka&quot; (conception): When a tirthankara&#x27;s &quot;ātman&quot; (soul) comes into their mother&#x27;s womb.
# &quot;Janma kalyāṇaka&quot; (birth): Birth of a tirthankara. Indra performs a ceremonial bath on &quot;tirthankara&quot; on Mount Meru.
# &quot;Diksha kalyāṇaka&quot; (renunciation): When a tirthankara renounces all worldly possessions and becomes an ascetic.
# &quot;Keval Gyan kalyāṇaka (omniscience)&quot;: When a tirthankara attains &quot;kevalajñāna&quot; (infinite knowledge). A &quot;samavasarana&quot; (divine preaching hall) is then erected from where they deliver sermons and establish &#x27;tirth (chaturvidh sangha).
# &quot;Nirvāṇa/Moksha kalyāṇaka&quot; (liberation): &quot;Nirvana&quot; is when a tirthankara leaves their mortal body. It is followed by the final liberation, &quot;moksha&quot;, after which their soul resides in &quot;Siddhashila&quot;.

==&quot;Samavasarana&quot;==

After attaining &quot;kevalajñāna&quot;, the &quot;tirthankara&quot; preaches the path to liberation in the &quot;samavasarana&quot;. According to Jain texts, &quot;devas&quot; (heavenly beings) erect the heavenly pavilion where &quot;devas&quot;, humans, and animals assemble to hear the &quot;tirthankara&quot;. A samavasarana is a three-level structure. The lowest level, made of rajat (silver), is the parking space for vehicles. The second is the svarna (gold) level. All animals reside in the svarna level, while the highest level, made of precious gems, is reserved for various important figures, such as kings and their families, the devas and the ascetics. Humans and animals hear a &quot;tirthankara&quot;&#x27;s speech in their language. It is believed that during this speech, there is no unhappiness for miles around the site.

== &quot;Tīrthaṅkaras&quot; of the present cosmic age ==
Jainism postulates that time has no beginning or end. It moves like the wheel of a cart. The wheel of time is divided into two halves, &quot;Utsarpiṇī&quot; (ascending half cycle) and &quot;Avasarpiṇī&quot; (descending half cycle). 24 &quot;tirthankaras&quot; are born in each half of this cycle. In Jain tradition, the &quot;tirthankaras&quot; were royal in their final lives, and Jain texts record details of those lives. Their clan and families are also among those recorded in legendary stories. According to Jain canons, Rishabhanatha, the first &quot;tirthankara&quot;, founded the Ikshvaku dynasty, from which 21 other &quot;tirthankaras&quot; rose over time. Two &quot;tirthankaras&quot; – Munisuvrata, the 20th, and Neminatha, the 22nd – belonged to the Harivamsa dynasty.

In Jain tradition, the 20 &quot;tirthankaras&quot; attained &quot;moksha&quot; on Mount Shikharji, in the present Indian state of Jharkhand. Rishabhanatha attained nirvana on Mount Ashtāpada (Mount Kailash), Vasupujya in Champapuri, Bihar, Neminatha on Mount Girnar, Gujarat, and Mahavira, the last &quot;tirthankara&quot;, at Pawapuri, near modern Patna. Twenty-one of the &quot;tirthankaras&quot; are said to have attained &quot;moksha&quot; in the &quot;kayotsarga&quot; (standing meditation posture), while Rishabhanatha, Neminatha, and Mahavira are said to have done so in the &quot;Padmasana&quot; (lotus position).

== Iconography ==
A tīrthaṅkara is represented either in the lotus position (&quot;Padmasana&quot;) or in the meditation Khadgasana (&quot;Kayotsarga&quot;) posture. The latter, which is similar to the military standing at attention, is a difficult posture to hold for long and is preferred by Jains because it minimizes the amount of the body in contact with the earth, and thus the risk to sentient creatures living in or on it. If seated, they are usually depicted seated with their legs crossed in front, the toes of one foot resting upon the knee of the other leg, and the right hand lying over the left in the lap.

Tirthankara images have no distinctive facial features, clothing, or (mostly) hairstyles, and are differentiated based on the symbol or emblem (&quot;Lanchhana&quot;) belonging to each &quot;tirthanakara&quot; except Parshvanatha. Statues of Parshvanatha have a snake crown. The first Tirthankara, Rishabha, is identifiable by the locks of hair falling on his shoulders. Sometimes Suparshvanath is shown with a small snake-hood. The symbols are marked in the centre or the corner of the statue&#x27;s pedestal. The Jain sects Digambara and Śvetāmbara have different depictions of idols. Digambara images are naked without any ornamentation, whereas Śvetāmbara ones are clothed and decorated with temporary ornaments. The images are often marked with Srivatsa on the chest and Tilaka on the forehead. Srivatsa is one of the ashtamangala (auspicious symbols), which sometimes resembles fleur-de-lis, an endless knot, a flower, or a diamond-shaped symbol.

The bodies of tirthankara statues are exceptionally consistent throughout over 2,000 years of the historical record. The bodies are rather slight, with very wide shoulders and a narrow waist. Even more than is usual in Indian sculpture, the depiction takes relatively little interest in accurate depiction of musculature and bones but is interested in modeling outer surfaces as broad swelling forms. The ears are extremely elongated, alluding to the heavy earrings the figures wore in their early lives before they took the path to enlightenment, when most were wealthy, if not royal.

Sculptures with four heads are not uncommon in early sculpture, but unlike the comparable Hindu images, these represent four different &quot;tirthanakaras&quot;, not four aspects of the same deity. Multiple extra arms are avoided &quot;in tirthanakara&quot; images, though their attendants or guardians may have them.

== In other religions ==

The first &quot;Tirthankara&quot;, &quot;Rishabhanatha&quot; is mentioned in Hindu texts like the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, &quot;Vishnupurana&quot;, and &quot;Bhagwata Purana&quot;. The Yajurveda mentions the name of three Tīrthaṅkaras: Ṛiṣhabha, Ajitnātha and Ariṣṭanemi. The Bhāgavata Purāṇa includes legends about the Tirthankaras, particularly Rishabha. Yoga Vasishta, Chapter 15 of Vairagya Khanda, Sloka 8, gives the saying of Rama:
Champat Rai Jain, a 20th-century Jain writer, claimed that the &quot;Four and Twenty Elders&quot; mentioned in the Book of Revelation (the final book of the Christian Bible) are &quot;Twenty-four &quot;Tirthankaras&quot;&quot;.

* Roberto Prats for the Popular Democratic Party

==Results==
Results were announced by the State Commission of Elections (CEE-PUR) on November 2–3, 2004 after the voting colleges closed on November 2 at 3:00 p.m. AST.

On November 3, after 1,970,759 votes (98.3% of the total votes) were computed, Aníbal Acevedo Vilá (PPD) was certified preliminarily as winning for Governor of Puerto Rico. On the other hand, Luis Fortuño (PNP) was certified as Resident Commissioner, while the Senate and the House of Representatives were also dominated by the New Progressive Party.

The preliminary certification was signed by Gerardo Cruz, electoral commissioner of the Popular Democratic Party (PPD), Brunilda Ortiz, alternate electoral commissioner of the New Progressive Party (PNP), and Andrés Miranda Rosa, alternate electoral commissioner of the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP). The alternate commissioners were authorized by the electoral commissioners in property of their party, Thomas Rivera Schatz (PNP) and Juan Dalmau (PIP).
Acevedo Vilá&#x27;s margin of victory over Pedro Rosselló was of 3,566 (0.2%) votes, whereas Luis Fortuño had 11,137 (0.49%) votes of advantage against Roberto Prats for Resident Commissioner. Due to the small margin of victory being, the Puerto Rican electoral laws state that a recount must be performed, and that once this recount is finished, the official winner will be certified by the CEE-PUR. The recount started on Monday, November 9 as established by law, and had to finish by December 31 or earlier.

During the period, Rosselló filed a civil lawsuit against Acevedo Vilá himself over a dispute of certain ballots that were cast during the elections. This led to a protracted controversy involving appeals to the United States federal courts and the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. The ballots in question were cast by marking the Puerto Rican Independence Party or New Progressive Party (i.e. marking a cross under the emblem of one of these parties) in addition to placing individual candidate marks (crosses) in favor of Acevedo Vilá as the candidate for governor of the Popular Democratic Party and Roberto Prats, the Popular Democratic Party&#x27;s candidate for Resident Commissioner. The mark indicating the selection of a political party selects that party&#x27;s slate of candidates by default, but the voter can also select individual candidates from other parties to replace candidates from the default slate.

The controversy reached the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, which ruled 4–3 that the ballots in question were valid. In its initial opinion, the Supreme Court majority interpreted the challenged ballots as indicating that voters were voting for the PIP as a party for the purposes of stating party affiliation (and for the PIP&#x27;s default slate) but had decided to move their votes to individual candidates from other party&#x27;s slates. This type of vote, described as a &quot;mixed vote&quot;, is permitted in Rule 50 of the State Election Commission&#x27;s rules, based on the Commonwealth&#x27;s Electoral Law as amended in 2004, Title 2, Section 2.001, Subsection 3. The practice is therefore considered legal and has been published in the official voter&#x27;s instructions by the State Election Commission for quite some time. This voting option was also allowed and seen in the 1996 and 2000 elections, and had never been contested before, either at the Legislature or by the NPP&#x27;s Electoral Commissioner. The individual votes for candidates not from the voter&#x27;s selected party are then deducted from the votes given to the default candidates of the voter&#x27;s party. The end result is a single vote per candidate.

At the same time, Rosselló challenged the ballots on the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico where District Judge Daniel Domínguez ordered the Puerto Rico Election Commission to count the disputed votes but to not adjudicate them to any candidate until he reached a decision on the merits of the case. Acevedo Vilá and his team challenged this ruling and the case moved up to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, where three judges ruled the question of whether or not the ballots were properly cast was not a federal constitutional issue in the case &quot;Rosselló-González v. Calderón-Serra&quot; and therefore should be decided by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico at the Commonwealth level. The Supreme Court affirmed its prior 4–3 decision. On December 28, 2004, the recount ended and Acevedo Vilá was certified as winner and therefore Governor elected. Once the official winners were announced, they were inaugurated to four-year terms on January 2, 2005.

<doc id="1012767" wikidata="Q2069734" url="?curid=1012767" title="Coarse woody debris">
<text>Coarse woody debris (CWD) or coarse woody habitat (CWH) refers to fallen dead trees and the remains of large branches on the ground in forests and in rivers or wetlands. A dead standing tree, known as a snag, provides many of the same functions as coarse woody debris. The minimum size required for woody debris to be defined as &quot;coarse&quot; varies by author, ranging from in diameter.

Since the 1970s, forest managers worldwide have considered it best environmental practice to allow dead trees and woody debris to remain in woodlands, recycling nutrients trapped in the wood and providing food and habitat for a wide range of organisms, thereby improving biodiversity. The amount of coarse woody debris is an important criterion for the evaluation and restoration of temperate deciduous forest. Coarse woody debris is also important in wetlands, particularly in deltas where woody debris accumulates.

==Sources==
Coarse woody debris comes from natural tree mortality, plant pathology, insects, wildfire, logging, windthrows and floods.

Ancient, or old growth, forest, with its dead trees and woody remains lying where they fell to feed new vegetation, constitutes the ideal woodland in terms of recycling and regeneration. In healthy temperate forests, dead wood comprises up to thirty per cent of all woody biomass. In recent British studies, woods managed for timber had between a third and a seventh less fallen debris than unmanaged woods that had been left undisturbed for many years, while in recently coppiced woods the amount of CWD was almost zero.

In old growth Douglas fir forests of the Pacific Northwest of North America, CWD concentrations were found to be from 72 metric tons/hectare (64,000 pounds/acre) in drier sites to 174 t/ha (155,000 lb/acre) in moister sites. Australian native forests have mean CWD concentrations ranging from 19 t/ha (17,000 lb/acre) to 134 t/ha (120,000 lb/acre), depending on forest type.

==Benefits==
===Nutrient cycling===
Coarse woody debris and its subsequent decomposition recycles nutrients that are essential for living organisms, such as carbon, nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. Saprotrophic fungi and detritivores such as bacteria and insects directly consume dead wood, releasing nutrients by converting them into other forms of organic matter which may then be consumed by other organisms It has almost no physiologically important nutrients, so must be first enriched for consumption by transport of nutrients from outside. Thus CWD is important actor contributing to soil nutrients cycles. CWD, while itself not particularly rich in nitrogen, contributes nitrogen to the ecosystem by acting as a host for nonsymbiotic free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria.

Scientific studies show that coarse woody debris can be a significant contributor to biological carbon sequestration. Trees store atmospheric carbon in their wood using photosynthesis. Once the trees die, fungi and other saprotrophs transfer some of that carbon from CWD into the soil. This sequestration can continue in old-growth forests for hundreds of years.

===Habitat===
By providing both food and microhabitats for many species, coarse woody debris helps to maintain the biodiversity of forest ecosystems. Up to forty percent of all forest fauna is dependent on CWD. Studies in western North America showed that only five per cent of living trees consisted of living cells by volume, whereas in dead wood it was as high as forty percent by volume, mainly fungi and bacteria. Colonizing organisms that live on the remains of cambium and sapwood of dead trees aid decomposition and attract predators that prey on them and so continue the chain of metabolizing the biomass.

The list of organisms dependent on CWD for habitat or as a food source includes bacteria, fungi, lichens, mosses and other plants, and in the animal kingdom, invertebrates such as termites, ants, beetles, and snails, amphibians such as salamanders, reptiles such as the slow-worm, as well as birds and small mammals. One third of all woodland birds live in the cavities of dead tree trunks. Woodpeckers, tits, chickadees, and owls all live in dead trees, and grouse shelter behind woody debris.

Some plants use coarse woody debris as habitat. Mosses and lichens may cover logs, while ferns and trees may regenerate on the top of logs. Large fragments of CWD that provide such habitat for herbs, shrubs, and trees are called nurse logs. CWD can also protect young plants from herbivory damage by acting as barriers to browsing animals. The persistence of coarse woody debris can shelter organisms during a large disturbance to the ecosystem such as wildfire or logging.

===Rivers and wetlands===
Fallen debris and trees in streams provide shelter for fish, amphibians and mammals by modifying the flow of water and sediment. Turtles of many species may also use coarse woody debris for basking. Musk turtles may lay their eggs under logs near wetlands.

===Soil===
Coarse woody debris, particularly on slopes, stabilizes soils by slowing downslope movement of organic matter and mineral soil. Leaves and other debris collect behind CWD, allowing for decomposition to occur. Infiltration of precipitation is improved as well. During dry weather, CWD slows evaporation of soil moisture and provides damp microhabitats for moisture-sensitive organisms.

==Wildfire==

In fire-prone forests, coarse woody debris can be a significant fuel during a wildfire. High amounts of fuels can lead to increased fire severity and size. CWD may be managed to reduce fuel levels, particularly in forests where fire exclusion has resulted in the buildup of fuels. Reductions in CWD for fire safety should be balanced with the retention of CWD for habitat and other benefits. CWD of in diameter is classified as 1000-hour fuel by fire managers, referring to the amount of time needed for the moisture content in the wood to come to equilibrium with the surrounding environment.

==Regional examples==

In Glen Affric, Scotland, the &quot;Trees for Life&quot; group found the black tinder fungus beetle (&quot;Bolitothorus reticulatus&quot;) is dependent on a particular fungus (&quot;Fomes fomentarius&quot;), which itself grows only on dead birch. Another insect, the pine hoverfly (&quot;Blera fallax&quot;), requires rotting Scots pine in order to reproduce.

In the temperate deciduous forests of eastern North America, CWD provides habitat ranging from salamanders to ferns. It is an important indicator for evaluating and restoring this type of forest.

In certain subtropical areas such as Australia where bushfire constitutes a major hazard, the amount of CWD left standing or lying is determined by what may be considered safe in the course of reasonable fire prevention. When fires occur, some invertebrates find shelter either within or beneath dead tree logs.

In Canada, bears seek out dead tree logs to tear open and look for and feed on ants and beetles, a fact that has encouraged the authorities to reserve a sufficient amount of coarse woody debris for these purposes. In North America, too, CWD is often used as barriers to prevent browsing deer and elk from damaging young trees.

<doc id="1012768" wikidata="Q1360339" url="?curid=1012768" title="Sittuyin">
<text>Sittuyin (), also known as Burmese chess, is a strategy board game created in Myanmar. It is a direct offspring of the Indian game of chaturanga, which arrived in Myanmar in the 8th century thus it is part of the same family of games such as chess, and shogi. &quot;Sit&quot; is the modern Burmese word for &quot;army&quot; or &quot;war&quot;; the word &quot;sittuyin&quot; can be translated as &quot;representation of the four characteristics of army&quot;—chariot, elephant, cavalry and infantry.

In its native land, the game has been largely overshadowed by Western (international) chess, although it remains popular in the northwest regions.

== Board ==
The sittuyin board consists of 64 squares, 8 rows and 8 columns, without alternating colors. The board has also two diagonal lines from corner to corner, which are known as &quot;sit-ke-myin&quot; (, general&#x27;s lines).

== Pieces and their moves ==
Pieces are commonly made of wood, and sometimes of ivory. The height of the pieces varies by class. The official colors of the pieces are red and black.

&quot;Min-gyi&quot; (, &quot;king&quot;, analogous to the king in Western chess)
:1 piece per player. It can move one step in any direction.

&quot;Sit-ke&quot; (, &quot;general&quot;, analogous to the queen in Western chess)
:1 piece per player. It can move one step in any diagonal direction (as &quot;fers&quot; in shatranj).
&quot;Sin&quot; (, &quot;elephant&quot;, analogous to the bishop in Western chess)
:2 pieces per player. It can move one step in any diagonal direction or one step forward (as silver general in shogi).
&quot;Myin&quot; (, &quot;horse&quot;, analogous to the knight in Western chess)
:2 pieces per player. It can jump two horizontal squares and one vertical square, or two vertical squares and one horizontal square, as knight in Western chess.
&quot;Yahhta&quot; (, &quot;chariot&quot;, analogous to the rook in Western chess)
:2 pieces per player. It can move any number of free squares along four orthogonal directions.
&quot;Nè&quot; (, &quot;feudal lord&quot;, analogous to the pawn in Western chess)
:8 pieces per player. It can move one step forward but cannot retreat. It captures one diagonal step forward.

== Rules ==
Only feudal lords (pawns) are on the board in the initial position. The game starts with the Red player (depicted here having white pieces), followed by the Black player, placing their other pieces arbitrarily on their own halves of the board (known as &quot;sit-tee&quot; or troops deployment): chariots can be put on any square on the back rank. In official tournaments, a small curtain is used on the middle of the board to prevent the players seeing each other&#x27;s deployment during the &quot;sit-tee&quot; phase. One of the possible game openings is shown in the diagram.

Feudal lords promote to general when they reach diagonal lines marked on the board. The promotion is possible only if that player&#x27;s general has been captured. If the player has a feudal lord on a promotion square and their general is no longer on the board, the player can (if they wish to) promote the feudal lord to general instead of making a move. A feudal lord which passes the promotion square cannot promote anymore.

The goal of the game is to &quot;khwè&quot; (checkmate) the opponent&#x27;s king. Putting the opponent in stalemate is not allowed.

In the version reported in &quot;A History of Chess&quot; in 1913, a game of sittuyin had three stages:
# Eight moves each: the &quot;sit-tee&quot; stage described above, but no restriction on chariot placing; Murray did not mention a curtain. Also, a player could put a piece where one of their pawns was, and in the same move put that pawn in a free square behind their row of pawns.
# Second stage: in each move, each player moves any one of their pieces (not a pawn) to any other empty place in their own half of the board, ignoring the usual move rules. Or they can move a pawn one square forwards and this ends the second stage and the third stage starts.
# Ordinary play, obeying the rules for piece moves.

== Dice rules ==
Anne Sunnucks writes that in some variations, three dice were thrown and each player made three moves at a time.

<text>Circuit bending is the creative customization of the circuits within electronic devices such as children&#x27;s toys and digital synthesizers to create new musical or visual instruments and sound generators. Circuit bending is manipulating a circuit to get an output that was not intended by the manufacturer.

Emphasizing spontaneity and randomness, the techniques of circuit bending have been commonly associated with noise music, though many more conventional contemporary musicians and musical groups have been known to experiment with &quot;bent&quot; instruments. Circuit bending usually involves dismantling the machine and adding components such as switches and potentiometers that alter the circuit.

== Experimental process ==

The process of circuit bending involves experimenting with inexpensive second-hand electronics that produce sounds, such as toys, keyboards, drum machines, and electronic learning products.

== Innovators==
While Ghazala says that he was not the first circuit bender, he coined the term Circuit Bending in 1992.

Serge Tcherepnin, designer of the Serge modular synthesizers, discussed his early experiments in the 1950s, with the transistor radio, in which he found sensitive circuit points in those simple electronic devices and brought them out to &quot;body contacts&quot; on the plastic chassis. Prior to Mark&#x27;s and Reed&#x27;s experiments other pioneers also explored the body-contact idea, one of the earliest being Thaddeus Cahill (1897) whose telharmonium, it is reported, was also touch-sensitive.

Since 1984, Swiss duo Voice Crack created music by manipulating common electronic devices in a practice they termed &quot;cracked everyday electronics&quot;.

<doc id="1012785" wikidata="Q4420064" url="?curid=1012785" title="Leland Hayward">
<text>Leland Hayward (September 13, 1902 – March 18, 1971) was an American talent agent and theatrical producer. He was an agent to about 150 artists in Hollywood, and produced the original Broadway stage productions of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

==Life and career==

Hayward was born in Nebraska City, Nebraska, the grandson of Monroe Leland Hayward, a United States senator from Nebraska. His father, Colonel William Hayward, was a celebrated hero of the First World War who commanded the 369th Infantry Regiment, the &quot;Harlem Hellfighters&quot;. Hayward&#x27;s father and mother, Sarah Coe Ireland, divorced when he was nine. Hayward&#x27;s father subsequently remarried, to Maisie Manwaring Plant, one of the wealthiest women in America at the time, who later traded her Fifth Avenue mansion to Cartier for a perfectly matched strand of pearls.

Hayward attended The Hotchkiss School and then studied at Princeton University, but dropped out. He took on a number of jobs including newspaper reporter and press agent, but eventually became a talent agent in Hollywood. In the early 1940s, he handled about 150 artists, including Fred Astaire who had been his first client, James Stewart, Ernest Hemingway, Boris Karloff, Judy Garland, Ginger Rogers, as well as the two former husbands of his second wife Margaret Sullavan, Henry Fonda and William Wyler. He dated some of his female clients, including Greta Garbo and Katharine Hepburn. Hepburn refused to marry him, despite a three-year relationship, choosing instead to focus on her career. 

In 1945, Hayward sold his talent agency and became a producer. His 1949 production of &quot;South Pacific&quot; was a great success. He produced both the 1948 play &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; and the 1955 film version.

Other noteworthy film productions included &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot; (1957), and &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; (1958). He was a co-producer (with David Merrick) of the 1959 show &quot;&quot;. His biggest success, however, was &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; that opened the same year.

Hayward&#x27;s forays into television were similarly notable. He produced &quot;The Ford 50th Anniversary Show&quot; on June 15, 1953, a live two-hour simulcast on CBS and NBC that looked back on the history of the United States and the world up to 1953. The program featured a memorable extended duet by Ethel Merman and Mary Martin. In 1953, Hayward conceived &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot; (1954–1956), a series of 90-minute color spectaculars to be broadcast monthly on NBC. Illness forced Hayward to withdraw from the project shortly before the first broadcast, and production was assumed by his attorneys, Saul and Henry Jaffe. Hayward later produced &quot;That Was The Week That Was&quot;, a groundbreaking American adaptation of a British television show, from 1963–1965.

Hayward&#x27;s interest in aviation led to his co-founding, in 1941, Southwest Airways, with financial help from his Hollywood friends.

Hayward was an eccentric in his food habits. He ate only white foods such as potatoes, chicken hash, lamb chops, eggs, custard and vanilla ice cream.

After suffering several strokes, Hayward died at his home, Haywire, in Yorktown Heights, New York, on March 18, 1971.

==Marriages and family==
Hayward was married five times.

#In 1921, aged 19, Hayward married the debutante Lola Gibbs.They divorced one year later, remarried and divorced again in 1934. They had no children.
#On 15 November 1936, Hayward married the stage and screen actress Margaret Sullavan, who was pregnant with his child. He thus became the third of Sullavan&#x27;s four husbands. Her previous husbands had been Henry Fonda and William Wyler, and after being divorced from Hayward in 1948, she would go on to marry British investment banker Kenneth Wagg. Hayward and Sullavan had three children, two of whom died by suicide. Margaret Sullavan herself died of an overdose of barbiturates in 1960. Their children were: 
#*Brooke Hayward, born July 5, 1937. She married three times, first to writer Michael Thomas and second to actor Dennis Hopper (1961–69). Her third marriage was to Peter Duchin in 1985. Her 1977 memoir, &quot;Haywire,&quot; recounts in detail the family&#x27;s dysfunctional life. Her children were:
#** William Thomas
#** Jeffrey Thomas
#** Marin Brooke Hopper
#*Bridget Hayward (1939–1960), who died by suicide from a barbiturate overdose in October 1960, aged 21, less than a year after her mother&#x27;s death from exactly the same cause, and only a few months after her father&#x27;s fourth marriage.
#*William Hayward III, born 1941, who committed suicide on March 20, 2008, by shooting himself in the heart. By his marriage to Rita Marie Rosate, he had two children:
#**Leland William Hayward
#**Bridget Pamela Hayward
#In 1950, Hayward married Slim Hawks. He had met her in Havana at a time when she was legally married to film director Howard Hawks but was staying with writer Ernest Hemingway and his latest wife Mary. Among her other previous relationships had been one with Clark Gable. Hayward and Slim divorced their respective spouses by 1949 and were married the following year; they had already been living together for some time. The marriage became strained after Slim had a one-night stand with Frank Sinatra and a longer affair with Peter Viertel. They were divorced in 1960.
#In 1960, Hayward married Pamela Churchill, former wife of Randolph Churchill. The couple was wed on 4 May 1960, in Carson City, Nevada, only hours after Hayward&#x27;s divorce from Hawks was final. They remained nominally married until Hayward&#x27;s death in 1971, but on the very day of his funeral, Pamela renewed her relationship with a former lover, W. Averell Harriman, and she married him later the same year.

In her 1977 memoir, &quot;Haywire,&quot; Hayward&#x27;s daughter Brooke recounts in detail the family&#x27;s thoroughly dysfunctional dynamics.

<doc id="1012790" wikidata="Q1326076" url="?curid=1012790" title="Janne Da Arc">
<text>Janne Da Arc was a Japanese visual kei rock band, formed in Hirakata, Osaka in 1991. Although inactive since 2007, they officially announced that they had disbanded on April 1, 2019. The band&#x27;s name is often shortened to or &quot;JDA&quot;.

==Career==
The band was signed to the Motorod record label, which is owned by Avex Group. They have released three indie albums, nine major-label albums (including single collections), 26 singles, and 14 DVDs.

On May 9, 2006, they celebrated their tenth anniversary, the date marking when the final member, shuji, became an official member of the band. The band was not named after historical figure Joan of Arc, despite their song &quot;Kyuuseishu (Messiah)&quot; being about her - yasu named the band after a character in the manga &quot;Devilman&quot; by Go Nagai. A picture of the character can be seen on the art for the band&#x27;s limited edition &quot;Janne Da Arc 10th Anniversary Indies Complete Box&quot;, released March 15, 2006.

Their sound is self-described as pop rock, but they played many musical styles such as alternative rock, progressive rock, hard rock and many others. Vocalist yasu takes many musical cues from his musical idol, Motoyuki &quot;Morrie&quot; Ōtsuka of the heavy metal band Dead End. However, the members of Janne Da Arc have proven themselves to be very versatile as well as proficient at their chosen instruments, and are influenced by many bands and musical styles.

As of January 26, 2007, the members of Janne Da Arc are pursuing solo projects, concurrent with their work in the band.

On May 19, 2009, they released a 10th Anniversary Complete Box Set.

On April 1, 2019, Janne Da Arc officially disbanded due to legal matters with their bassist, ka-yu, and health problems of their vocalist, yasu. The announcement was made by agency Uprise Product and elaborated on the circumstances of ka-yu&#x27;s departure. It noted that during the time the band was preparing for an announcement of a new album and a live tour last September, it had received documents addressed to ka-yu from a law firm. The announcement continued on saying that &quot;if the contents of the document were true,&quot; then it represented &quot;acts that went against society and what was right.&quot; As a result of these documents, the band decided to cease activity with any projects related to ka-yu.

==Members==
* yasu (Yasunori Hayashi), vocalist, born January 27, 1975, in Hirakata, Osaka, Japan. Favorite artists include Dead End and Boøwy. yasu also plays the guitar and keyboard, the latter of which he uses to compose most of his music. In 2007 he started his solo project, Acid Black Cherry.
* you (Yutaka Tsuda), guitarist, born July 24, 1974, in Kobe, Japan. Favorite artists include Unicorn and Nuno Bettencourt.
* ka-yu (Kazuyuki Matsumoto), bassist, born January 21, 1975, in Hirakata, Osaka, Japan. Favorite artists include Crazy Cool Joe (Dead End bassist) and Boøwy. ka-yu is characterized by his more visual kei look in comparison to the rest of the band members. In 2010 he has announced the start of a new project called DAMIJAW, starting out with an album on April 28.
*kiyo (Masanobu Kiyose), keyboardist, born June 27, 1974, in Hirakata, Osaka, Japan. Favorite artists include Earth, Wind, and Fire and Keith Emerson.

<doc id="1012799" wikidata="Q1427709" url="?curid=1012799" title="43 Commando Fleet Protection Group">
<text>The 43 Commando Fleet Protection Group Royal Marines (43 Cdo FP Gp RM), formerly Comacchio Company Royal Marines (1980–1983), Comacchio Group Royal Marines (1983–2001) and Fleet Protection Group Royal Marines (2001–2012), is a 550-man unit of the Royal Marines responsible for guarding the United Kingdom&#x27;s nuclear weapons. The unit, based at HM Naval Base Clyde, is part of UK Commando Force.

It inherited the traditions and battle honours of the Second World War No. 43 (Royal Marine) Commandos.

==History==
===Second World War===
Early Commando units were all from the British Army. In February 1942, the Royal Marines were asked to organize Commando units of their own, and 6,000 men volunteered.

In July 1943, 43 Commando was formed, after the conversion of the battalions of the Royal Marine Division into commando units. The initial intake of personnel was drawn from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Marines. Following commando training at Achnacarry in Scotland, the unit consisted of about 450 men organized into a headquarters, five infantry troops consisting of three officers and 63 other ranks, along with a heavy weapons troop—armed with Vickers machine guns, 3-inch mortars and 6-pounder anti-tank guns—and a signals platoon.

Along with No. 2, No. 9 and No. 40 (Royal Marine) Commandos, 43 Commando formed the 2nd Special Service Brigade. In 1943–45, No. 43 (Royal Marine) Commando served in Italy, Yugoslavia and Greece.

==== Victoria Cross ====
Corporal Thomas Peck Hunter was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during Operation Roast at Lake Comacchio, Italy during the Second World War. Hunter cleared a farmhouse containing three MG42 machine-guns on his own, firing a Bren Gun from his hip. Hunter then proceeded to draw enemy fire until most of his troop had taken cover. The Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Ian Riches RM was awarded the DSO in this action. He went on to be Commandant General Royal Marines between 1959 and 1962.

===Re-formed===
In 1961, 43 Commando RM was reformed at Stonehouse Barracks &quot;as a further contribution to the forces available for seaborne operations&quot;. The unit was disbanded again in 1968.

=== Comacchio Company ===
On 1 May 1980, the Comacchio Company Royal Marines was formed - taking its name from the battle honour &quot;Comacchio, Italy 1945&quot;, where Hunter posthumously received the Victoria Cross for his actions. On its formation, Comacchio Company took on the colours and traditions of the then-defunct 43 Commando. The company&#x27;s purpose was to guard the UK&#x27;s Naval nuclear weapons and be a maritime counter-terrorism unit for offshore installations, including oil rigs and ships. The company initially numbered around 424 personnel.

In November 1983, the Comacchio Company RM became Comacchio Group RM. In 1987, Comacchio Group ceased performing the maritime counter-terrorism role after a study transferred the task to the newly formed M-squadron of the Royal Marines Special Boat Service.

=== Fleet Protection Group Royal Marines ===
In March 2001, the Comacchio Group RM was renamed Fleet Protection Group Royal Marines, and restructured into its current organisation. The Group moved from RM Condor in Arbroath Angus, where it was co-located with 45 Commando, to HM Naval Base Clyde, which is situated near Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute, both in Scotland.

In 2012, FPGRM formally adopted the name 43 Commando Fleet Protection Group Royal Marines.

In 2016, elements of the unit began using the Colt Canada C8 carbine instead of the standard L85A2.

Commandos from 43 Commando regularly train with other forces both inside the UK and other nations including the US Marines.

==Tasks and organisation==
The primary mission is to prevent unauthorised access to the UK&#x27;s strategic nuclear deterrent through the provision of specialist military capability. Additionally, maritime boarding and sniper teams and the 
very high readiness Fleet Contingent Troop are deployed world-wide to conduct specialist maritime security tasks in support of the Royal Navy.

43 Commando Fleet Protection Group Royal Marines is a Royal Marine Unit based at HM Naval Base Clyde in Scotland and is part of UK Commando Force, the UK&#x27;s high readiness expeditionary amphibious force.

As of 2016, 43 Commando Fleet Protection Group Royal Marines has over 550 personnel and is organised into several sub-units:
*HQ headquarters squadron
*O Rifle Squadron
*P Rifle Squadron (reformed in 2018) 
*R Rifle Squadron
==Royal Navy Reserve Augmentation==
Naval ratings of the Royal Naval Reserve have been attached to 43 Commando Fleet Protection Group Royal Marines, to support the force protection tasks outside of the United Kingdom. This organisation was known as P Squadron. It was disbanded, with the force protection duties being transferred to the standing tasks commando unit, a duty which rotates annually between Commando units.

<text>Thermal Design Power (TDP), also known as thermal design point, is the maximum amount of heat that a computer component (like a CPU, GPU or system on a chip) can generate and that its cooling system is designed to dissipate during normal operation at a non-turbo clock rate (base frequency).

Some sources state that the peak power rating for a microprocessor is usually 1.5 times the TDP rating.

== Calculation ==

The &quot;average CPU power&quot; (ACP) is the power consumption of central processing units, especially server processors, under &quot;average&quot; daily usage as defined by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) for use in its line of processors based on the K10 microarchitecture (Opteron 8300 and 2300 series processors). Intel&#x27;s thermal design power (TDP), used for Pentium and Core 2 processors, measures the energy consumption under high workload; it is numerically somewhat higher than the &quot;average&quot; ACP rating of the same processor.

According to AMD the ACP rating includes the power consumption when running several benchmarks, including TPC-C, SPECcpu2006, SPECjbb2005 and STREAM Benchmark (memory bandwidth),
 which AMD said is an appropriate method of power consumption measurement for data centers and server-intensive workload environments. AMD said that the ACP and TDP values of the processors will both be stated and do not replace one another. &quot;Barcelona&quot; and later server processors have the two power figures.

The TDP of a CPU has been underestimated in some cases, leading to certain real applications (typically strenuous, such as video encoding or games) causing the CPU to exceed its specified TDP and resulting in overloading the computer&#x27;s cooling system. In this case, CPUs either cause a system failure (a &quot;therm-trip&quot;) or throttle their speed down. Most modern processors will cause a therm-trip only upon a catastrophic cooling failure, such as a no longer operational fan or an incorrectly mounted heat sink.

For example, a laptop&#x27;s CPU cooling system may be designed for a 20 W TDP, which means that it can dissipate up to 20 watts of heat without exceeding the maximum junction temperature for the laptop&#x27;s CPU. A cooling system can do this using an active cooling method (e.g. conduction coupled with forced convection) such as a heat sink with a fan, or any of the two passive cooling methods: thermal radiation or conduction. Typically, a combination of these methods is used.

Since safety margins and the definition of what constitutes a real application vary among manufacturers, TDP values between different manufacturers cannot be accurately compared (a processor with a TDP of, for example, 100 W will almost certainly use more power at full load than processors with a fraction of said TDP, and very probably more than processors with lower TDP from the same manufacturer, but it may or may not use more power than a processor from a different manufacturer with a not excessively lower TDP, such as 90 W). Additionally, TDPs are often specified for families of processors, with the low-end models usually using significantly less power than those at the high end of the family.

Until around 2006 AMD used to report the maximum power draw of its processors as TDP. Intel changed this practice with the introduction of its Conroe family of processors. Intel calculates a specified chip&#x27;s TDP according to the amount of power the computer&#x27;s fan and heatsink need to be able to dissipate while the chip is under sustained load. Actual power usage can be higher or (much) lower than TDP, but the figure is intended to give guidance to engineers designing cooling solutions for their products. In particular, Intel&#x27;s measurement also does not fully take into account Intel Turbo Boost due to the default time limits, while AMD does because AMD Turbo Core always tries to push for the maximum power.

== Alternatives ==

TDP specifications for some processors may allow them to work under multiple different power levels, depending on the usage scenario, available cooling capacities and desired power consumption. Technologies that provide such variable TDPs include Intel&#x27;s &quot;configurable TDP&quot; (cTDP) and &quot;scenario design power&quot; (SDP), and AMD&#x27;s &quot;TDP power cap&quot;.

&quot;Configurable TDP&quot; (&quot;cTDP&quot;), also known as &quot;programmable TDP&quot; or &quot;TDP power cap&quot;, is an operating mode of later generations of Intel mobile processors () and AMD processors () that allows adjustments in their TDP values. By modifying the processor behavior and its performance levels, power consumption of a processor can be changed altering its TDP at the same time. That way, a processor can operate at higher or lower performance levels, depending on the available cooling capacities and desired power consumption.

cTDP typically provide (but are not limited to) three operating modes:

* &quot;Nominal TDP&quot; the processor&#x27;s rated frequency and TDP.
* &quot;cTDP down&quot; when a cooler or quieter mode of operation is desired, this mode specifies a lower TDP and lower guaranteed frequency versus the nominal mode.
* &quot;cTDP up&quot; when extra cooling is available, this mode specifies a higher TDP and higher guaranteed frequency versus the nominal mode.

For example, some of the mobile Haswell processors support cTDP up, cTDP down, or both modes. As another example, some of the AMD Opteron processors and Kaveri APUs can be configured for lower TDP values. IBM&#x27;s POWER8 processor implements a similar power capping functionality through its embedded on-chip controller (OCC).

Intel introduced &quot;scenario design power&quot; (SDP) for some low power Y-series processors since 2013. It is described as &quot;an additional thermal reference point meant to represent thermally relevant device usage in real-world environmental scenarios.&quot; As a power rating, SDP is not an additional power state of a processor; it states the average power consumption of a processor using a certain mix of benchmark programs to simulate &quot;real-world&quot; scenarios.

== Ambiguities of the Thermal Design Power parameter==

As some authors and users have observed, the Thermal Design Power (TDP) rating is an ambiguous parameter. In fact, different manufacturers define the TDP using different calculation methods and different operating conditions, keeping these details almost undisclosed (with very few exceptions). This makes highly problematic (if not impossible) to reasonably compare similar devices made by different manufacturers based on their TDP, and to optimize the design of a cooling system in terms of both heat management and cost. 

=== Thermal Management fundamentals ===

To better understand the problem we must remember the basic concepts underlying Thermal management and Computer cooling. Let’s consider the thermal conduction path from the CPU case to the ambient air through a Heat sink, with:

:Pd (Watt) = Thermal power generated by a CPU and to be dissipated into the ambient through a suitable Heat sink. It corresponds to the total power drain from the direct current supply rails of the CPU.
:Rca (°C/W) = Thermal resistance of the Heat sink, between the case of the CPU and the ambient air.
:Tc (°C) = Maximum allowed temperature of the CPU&#x27;s case (ensuring full performances).
:Ta (°C) = Maximum expected ambient temperature at the inlet of the Heat sink fan.

All these parameters are linked together by the following equation:

:formula_1

Hence, once we know the thermal power to be dissipated (Pd), the maximum allowed case temperature (Tc) of the CPU and the maximum expected ambient temperature (Ta) of the air entering the cooling fans, we can determine the fundamental characteristics of the required Heat sink, i.e. its thermal resistance Rca, as:

:formula_2 

This equation can be rearranged by writing 

:formula_3 

where in Pd can replaced by the Thermal Design Power (TDP).

Note that the heat dissipation path going from the CPU to the ambient air flowing through the printed circuit of the motherboard has a thermal resistance that is orders of magnitude greater than the one of the Heat sink, therefore it can be neglected in these computations.

=== Issues when dealing with the Thermal Design Power (TDP) ===
Once all the input data is known, the previous formula allows to choose a CPU’s Heat sink with a suitable thermal resistance Rca between case and ambient air, sufficient to keep the maximum case temperature at or below a predefined value Tc. 

On the contrary, when dealing with the Thermal Design Power (TDP), ambiguities arise because the CPU manufacturers usually do not disclose the exact conditions under which this parameter has been defined. The maximum acceptable case temperature Tc to get the rated performances is usually missing, as well as the corresponding ambient temperature Ta, and, last but not least, details about the specific computational test workload. 

For instance, an Intel’s general support page states briefly that the TDP refers to &quot;the power consumption under the maximum theoretical load&quot;. Here they also inform that starting from the 12th generation of their CPUs the term Thermal Design Power (TDP) has been replaced with Processor Base Power (PBP) . In a support page dedicated to the Core i7-7700 processor, Intel defines the TDP as the maximum amount of heat that a processor can produce when running real life applications, without telling what these &quot;real life applications&quot; are. 
Another example: in a 2011 white paper where the Xeon processors are compared with AMD’s competing devices, Intel defines TDP as the upper point of the thermal profile measured at maximum case temperature, but without specifying what this temperature should be (nor the computing load). 
It is important to note that all these definitions imply that the CPU is running at the base clock rate (non-turbo). 

In conclusion:

:*Comparing the TDP between devices of different manufacturers is not very meaningful. 

:*The selection of a heat sink may end up with overheating (and CPU reduced performances) or overcooling (oversized, expensive heat sink ), depending if one chooses a too high or a too low case temperature Tc (respectively with a too low or too high ambient temperature Ta), or if the CPU operates with different computational loads.

:*A possible approach to ensure a long life of a CPU is to ask the manufacturer the recommended maximum case temperature Tc and then to oversize the cooling system. For instance, a safety margin taking into account some turbo overclocking could consider a thermal power that is 1.5 times the rated TDP. In any case, the lower is the silicon junction temperature, the longer will be the lifespan of the device, according to an acceleration factor very roughly expressed by means of the Arrhenius equation.

=== Some disclosed details of AMD’s Thermal Design Power (TDP)===

In October 2019, the GamersNexus Hardware Guides showed a table with case and ambient temperature values that they got directly from AMD, describing the TPDs of some Ryzen 5, 7 and 9 CPUs. The formula relating all these parameters, given by AMD, is the usual 

:formula_4 

The declared TPDs of these devices range from 65 W to 105 W; the ambient temperature considered by AMD is +42°C, and the case temperatures range from +61.8 °C to +69.3°C, while the case-to-ambient thermal resistances range from 0.189 to 0.420 °C/W.

<text>Hugh Desmond Hoyte (9 March 1929 – 22 December 2002) was a Guyanese politician who served as Prime Minister of Guyana from 1984 to 1985 and President of Guyana from 1985 until 1992.

==Early life and education==
Hoyte was born on 9 March 1929 to a middle-class family in Georgetown, the capital of British Guiana. He was educated at St Barnabas Anglican School and Progressive High School. In 1948, he joined the civil service, then entered public service as a teacher in Guyana and Grenada. While he was working, Hoyte earned an external B.A. from the University of London in 1950. In 1957, he went to the UK to pass his bar exams at the Middle Temple and earn an LL.B., which he received in 1959. In 1960 he joined the same law practice as Forbes Burnham (Clarke and Martin), before setting up private practice and became one of the leaders of the Guyana Bar Association. He would come to serve as a legal advisor to the Guyana Trades Union Congress. In 1962, he was appointed a member of the General Council of the People&#x27;s National Congress. In 1966, he was appointed to the National Elections Commission, which supervised the 1968 Guyanese general election.

==Politics==
After being a general council member for the party, he entered Parliament as a member of the People&#x27;s National Congress in 1968 and soon began serving in the cabinet. He was Home Affairs Minister from 1969 to 1970, Finance Minister from 1970 to 1972, Works and Communications Minister from 1972 to 1974, and Economic Development Minister in 1974 to 1980. In all of his ministerial positions, Hoyte was a part of the movement of the Burnham administration towards a planned economy, particularly in his role as the Minister of Economic Development during the nationalization of the bauxite and sugar industries following the 1974 Declaration of Sophia. In 1973, he was appointed a member of the central committee of the PNC.

Following the December 1980 election he became one of five vice-presidents, with responsibility for economic planning, finance, and regional development.

In August 1984, Hoyte became Prime Minister and first Vice President, replacing Hamilton Green, who was widely seen at the time as Burnham&#x27;s preference for successor.

Hoyte suffered a personal tragedy in 1985 when his two daughters Amanda and Maxine died in a car crash while traveling on 30 April to hear him deliver the May Day address in the town of Linden. His sister-in-law and his driver also died; his wife Joyce was the lone survivor. 

==Presidency==
On Burnham&#x27;s death on 6 August 1985, Hoyte became the third President of Guyana. Shortly before Burnham&#x27;s death, he and other members of the PNC had embarked on talks with the opposition People&#x27;s Progressive Party attempting to achieve a national unity formula to deal with the country&#x27;s problems. Hoyte announced his willingness to continue the dialogue, but also announced that a general election would be held on 9 December. Responding to criticisms of previous elections as fraudulent, he agreed to certain reforms.

Immediately after becoming President, Hoyte removed bans on imported food items and opened Guyana to greater international trade.

In July 1987, he hosted the President of the African National Congress, Oliver Tambo, for a four-day visit, highlighting the close links Guyana maintained with the liberation struggle in Southern Africa. Also in 1987, Hoyte established the Guyana Prize for Literature.

In 1989, Hoyte first proposed a conservation area in the Guyanese rainforest; this proposal would eventually become the Iwokrama Forest.

Hoyte was also Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1990 until 1992.

During Hoyte&#x27;s presidency, violent crime decreased, but Hoyte failed to reduce levels of corruption within the government.
Hoyte used the increased powers of the presidency (changed by his predecessor in the 1980 Constitution) to move away from policies advocated by previous president Forbes Burnham which had led to high poverty rates and high debt. He also invited foreign investment and made peace with the International Monetary Fund, which angered others in his party. During Hoyte&#x27;s tenure, Guyana&#x27;s significant sugar industry saw a revival, and the economically important Omai Mine was opened and began production.

During his presidency, he would try to improve racial relations between Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese, being called derisively &quot;Desmond Persaud&quot; for his supposed better treatment of Indo-Guyanese people. Hoyte also re-established freedom of press.

===1992 General Election===

Hoyte announced significant electoral reforms in 1990 prior to the 1992 election, influenced by former US President Jimmy Carter. These reforms included a ban on the military providing electoral services with the exception of for security purposes, counting being done at the place of voting, the establishment of an independent electoral commission and changes to ballots and ballot boxes. According to Hamilton Green, Jimmy Carter personally announced that overseas voting would no longer be allowed to the Guyanese public; overseas voting was used to manipulate the 1968 Guyanese general election.

Following Hoyte&#x27;s electoral reforms, the 1992 Guyanese general elections were the first free and fair elections since 1964. In the lead-up to the 1992 General Election, Hoyte believed that his party could win a free and fair election. On election day, it became clear that his electoral victory was unlikely, and PNC party supporters took to the streets to attack the headquarters of the electoral commission to try to halt the vote count. Hoyte announced that he would resign if this action continued, thus ending the demonstration.

The October 1992 election was won by the People&#x27;s Progressive Party, led by Cheddi Jagan; Hoyte conceded defeat.

==Post-Presidency==
Hoyte remained leader of the PNC until his death, and also Minority Leader and Leader of the Opposition.

In 1994, the PNC split, with a new party being founded by Hamilton Green after he was expelled from the PNC for a public disagreement with Hoyte over electoral reforms and party discipline. According to Green, the disagreement rose from a party meeting at East Ruimveldt Secondary School, where Green opposed Hoyte&#x27;s electoral policy on opposing overseas voting. Hoyte then appointed a panel to review the event, which resulted in Green&#x27;s expulsion. Green&#x27;s party, Good and Green Georgetown, won the Georgetown municipal elections, beating both the PNC and PPP.

Hoyte was the PNC candidate in the presidential elections of 1996 and 2001. He received second place both times (40.6% in 1996 and 41.7% in 2001).

In opposition, Hoyte obstructed several initiatives proposed by the ruling party, including constitutional changes and the establishment of a commission on race relations. He also conducted a campaign to overturn the results of the 1997 elections. He regularly protested the exclusion of Afro-Guyanese from government posts. After the 2001 elections, Hoyte&#x27;s PNC refused to take seats in parliament. Bharrat Jagdeo, the elected President, held reconciliation talks with Hoyte in 2001, but they were unsuccessful.

He died of heart failure in Georgetown, Guyana on 22 December 2002, aged 73. His tomb is at the Botanical Gardens. After his death a television station had its name amended as a posthumous homage.

==Personal life==
Hoyte married Joyce Noreen De Freitas in 1965. Hoyte&#x27;s wife, Joyce, died on 14 February 2011 aged 77. Hoyte had a sister, called Patricia. Hoyte and his family had a residence on North Road, Bourda, Georgetown, which was converted into a museum and library in his honour in 2016.

<text>Click fraud is a type of fraud that occurs on the Internet in pay per click (PPC) online advertising. In this type of advertising, the owners of websites that post the ads are paid based on how many site visitors click on the ads. Fraud occurs when a person, automated script, computer program or an auto clicker imitates a legitimate user of a web browser, clicking on such an ad without having an actual interest in the target of the ad&#x27;s link in order to increase revenue. Click fraud is the subject of some controversy and increasing litigation due to the advertising networks being a key beneficiary of the fraud.

Media entrepreneur and journalist John Battelle describes click fraud as the intentionally malicious, &quot;decidedly black hat&quot; practice of publishers gaming paid search advertising by employing robots or low-wage workers to click on ads on their sites repeatedly, thereby generating money to be paid by the advertiser to the publisher and to any agent the advertiser may be using. 

==Pay-per-click advertising==

PPC advertising is an arrangement in which webmasters (operators of websites), acting as publishers, display clickable links from advertisers in exchange for a charge per click. As this industry evolved, a number of advertising networks developed, which acted as middlemen between these two groups (publishers and advertisers). Each time a (believed to be) valid Web user clicks on an ad, the advertiser pays the advertising network, which in turn pays the publisher a share of this money. This revenue-sharing system is seen as an incentive for click fraud.

The largest of the advertising networks, Google&#x27;s AdWords/AdSense and Yahoo! Search Marketing, act in a dual role, since they are also publishers themselves (on their search engines). According to critics, this complex relationship may create a conflict of interest. This is because these companies lose money to undetected click fraud when paying out to the publisher but make more money when collecting fees from the advertiser. Because of the spread between what they collect and pay out, unfettered click fraud would create short-term profits for these companies.

==Non-contracting parties==

A secondary source of click fraud is non-contracting parties, who are not part of any pay-per-click agreement. This type of fraud is even harder to police, because perpetrators generally cannot be sued for breach of contract or charged criminally with fraud. Examples of non-contracting parties are:
*Competitors of advertisers: These parties may wish to harm a competitor who advertises in the same market by clicking on their ads. The perpetrators do not profit directly but force the advertiser to pay for irrelevant clicks, thus weakening or eliminating a source of competition.
*Competitors of publishers: These persons may wish to frame a publisher. It is made to look as if the publisher is clicking on its own ads. The advertising network may then terminate the relationship. Many publishers rely exclusively on revenue from advertising and could be put out of business by such an attack.
*Other malicious intent: As with vandalism, there are many motives for wishing to cause harm to either an advertiser or a publisher, even by people who have nothing to gain financially. Motives include political and personal vendettas. These cases are often the hardest to deal with, since it is difficult to track down the culprit, and if found, there is little legal action that can be taken against them.
*Friends of the publisher: Sometimes upon learning a publisher profits from ads being clicked, a supporter of the publisher (like a fan, family member, political party supporter, charity patron or personal friend) will click on the ads to help. This can be considered patronage. However, this can backfire when the publisher (not the friend) is accused of click fraud.

Advertising networks may try to stop fraud by all parties but often do not know which clicks are legitimate. Unlike fraud committed by the publisher, it is difficult to know who should pay when past click fraud is found. Publishers resent having to pay refunds for something that is not their fault. However, advertisers are adamant that they should not have to pay for phony clicks.

==Organization==
Click fraud can be as simple as one person starting a small Web site, becoming a publisher of ads, and clicking on those ads to generate revenue. Often the number of clicks and their value is so small that the fraud goes undetected. Publishers may claim that small amounts of such clicking is an accident, which is often the case.

Much larger-scale fraud also occurs in cybercrime communities. According to Jean-Loup Richet, Professor at the Sorbonne Business School, click fraud is frequently one link in the large ad fraud chain, and can be leveraged as part of a larger identity fraud and/or attribution fraud. Those engaged in large-scale fraud will often run scripts which simulate a human clicking on ads in Web pages. 
However, huge numbers of clicks appearing to come from just one, or a small number of computers, or a single geographic area, look highly suspicious to the advertising network and advertisers.
Clicks coming from a computer known to be that of a publisher also look suspicious to those watching for click fraud. A person attempting large-scale fraud, from one computer, stands a good chance of being caught.

One type of fraud that circumvents detection based on IP patterns uses existing user traffic, turning this into clicks or impressions. Such an attack can be camouflaged from users by using 0-size iframes to display advertisements that are programmatically retrieved using JavaScript. It could also be camouflaged from advertisers and portals by ensuring that so-called &quot;reverse spiders&quot; are presented with a legitimate page, while human visitors are presented with a page that commits click fraud. The use of 0-size iframes and other techniques involving human visitors may also be combined with the use of incentivized traffic, where members of &quot;Paid to Read&quot; (PTR) sites are paid small amounts of money (often a fraction of a cent) to visit a website and/or click on keywords and search results, sometimes hundreds or thousands of times every day Some owners of PTR sites are members of PPC engines and may send many email ads to users who do search, while sending few ads to those who do not. They do this mainly because the charge per click on search results is often the only source of revenue to the site. This is known as forced searching, a practice that is frowned upon in the Get Paid To industry.

Organized crime can handle this by having many computers with their own Internet connections in different geographic locations. Often, scripts fail to mimic true human behavior, so organized crime networks use Trojan code to turn the average person&#x27;s machines into zombie computers and use sporadic redirects or DNS cache poisoning to turn the oblivious user&#x27;s actions into actions generating revenue for the scammer. It can be difficult for advertisers, advertising networks, and authorities to pursue cases against networks of people spread around multiple countries.

Impression fraud is when falsely generated ad impressions affect an advertiser&#x27;s account. In the case of click-through rate based auction models, the advertiser may be penalized for having an unacceptably low click-through for a given keyword. This involves making numerous searches for a keyword without clicking of the ad. Such ads are disabled automatically, enabling a competitor&#x27;s lower-bid ad for the same keyword to continue, while several high bidders (on the first page of the search results) have been eliminated.

===Hit inflation attack===
A hit inflation attack is a kind of fraudulent method used by some advertisement publishers to earn unjustified revenue on the traffic they drive to the advertisers’ Web sites. It is more sophisticated and harder to detect than a simple inflation attack.

This process involves the collaboration of two counterparts, a dishonest publisher, P, and a dishonest Web site, S.
Web pages on S contain a script that redirects the customer to P&#x27;s Web site, and this process is hidden from the customer. So, when user U retrieves a page on S, it would simulate a click or request to a page on P&#x27;s site. P&#x27;s site has two kinds of webpages: a manipulated version, and an original version. The manipulated version simulates a click or request to the advertisement, causing P to be credited for the click-through. P selectively determines whether to load the manipulated (and thus fraudulent) script to U&#x27;s browser by checking if it was from S. This can be done through the Referrer field, which specifies the site from which the link to P was obtained. All requests from S will be loaded with the manipulated script, and thus the automatic and hidden request will be sent.

This attack will silently convert every innocent visit to S to a click on the advertisement on P&#x27;s page. Even worse, P can be in collaboration with several dishonest Web sites, each of which can be in collaboration with several dishonest publishers. If the advertisement commissioner visits the Web site of P, the non-fraudulent page will be displayed, and thus P cannot be accused of being fraudulent. Without a reason for suspecting that such collaboration exists, the advertisement commissioner has to inspect all the Internet sites to detect such attacks, which is infeasible.

Another proposed method for detection of this type of fraud is through use of association rules.

==Manipulation of organic search results==
One major factor that affects the ranking of websites in organic search results is the CTR (Click-through Rate). That is the ratio of clicks to impressions, or in other words how many times a search result is clicked on, as compared to the number of times the listing appears in search results.

In contrast to PPC fraud, where a competitor leverages the services of a botnet, or low-cost labour, to generate false clicks, in this case the objective is to adopt a &quot;beggar thy neighbour&quot; policy against competitors by making their CTR rate as low as possible, thereby diminishing their position in search results.

Bad actors will therefore generate false clicks on organic search results that they wish to promote, while avoiding search results they wish to demote. This technique can effectively create a cartel of business services controlled by the same bad actor, or be used to promote a certain political opinion etc. The scale of this issue is unknown but is certainly evident to many website developers who pay close attention to the statistics in webmaster tools.

==Legal cases==

===Lawsuits===
* Disputes over the issue have resulted in a number of lawsuits. In one case, Google (acting as both an advertiser and advertising network) won a lawsuit against a Texas company called Auction Experts (acting as a publisher), which Google accused of paying people to click on ads that appeared on Auction Experts&#x27; site, costing advertisers $50,000. Despite networks&#x27; efforts to stop it, publishers are suspicious of the motives of the advertising networks, because the advertising network receives money for each click, even if it is fraudulent.
* In July 2005, Yahoo settled a class action lawsuit against it by plaintiffs alleging it did not do enough to prevent click fraud. Yahoo paid $4.5 million in legal bills for the plaintiffs and agreed to settle advertiser claims dating back to 2004 In July 2006, Google settled a similar suit for $90 million.
* On March 8, 2006, Google agreed to a $90 million settlement fund in the class-action lawsuit filed by Lane&#x27;s Gifts &amp; Collectibles. The class-action lawsuit was filed in Miller County, Arkansas, by Dallas attorneys Steve Malouf, Joel Fineberg, and Dean Gresham. The expert witness for the Plaintiffs in the case was Jessie Stricchiola, an internet search expert who first identified instances of PPC fraud in 2001.

===Michael Anthony Bradley===
In 2004, California resident Michael Anthony Bradley created Google Clique, a software program that he claimed could let spammers defraud Google out of millions of dollars in fraudulent clicks, which ultimately led to his arrest and indictment.

Bradley was able to demonstrate that fraud was possible, and was impossible for Google to detect. The Department of Justice alleged that he contacted Google saying that unless they paid him $100,000 for the rights to the technology, he would sell it to spammers, costing Google millions. As a result, Bradley was arrested for extortion and mail fraud in 2006.

Charges were dropped without explanation on November 22, 2006; both the US Attorney&#x27;s office and Google declined to comment. &quot;Business Week&quot; suggests that Google was unwilling to cooperate with the prosecution, as it would be forced to disclose its click fraud detection techniques publicly.

===Fabio Gasperini===

On June 18, 2016, Fabio Gasperini, an Italian citizen, was extradited to the United States on click fraud charges. An indictment charged Gasperini with:
* two counts of computer intrusion
* one count of wire fraud 
* one count of wire fraud conspiracy 
* and one count of money laundering
According to the U.S. government, Gasperini set up and operated a botnet of over 140,000 computers around the world. This was the first click fraud trial in the United States. If convicted of all counts, Gasperini risked up to 70 years in prison.

Simone Bertollini, an Italian-American lawyer, represented Gasperini at trial. On August 9, 2017 a jury acquitted Gasperini of all the felony charges of the indictment. Gasperini was convicted of one misdemeanor count of obtaining information without a financial gain. Gasperini was sentenced to the statutory maximum of one year imprisonment, a $100,000 fine, and one year of supervised release following incarceration. Shortly after he was credited with time served and sent back to Italy. An appeal is currently pending.

==Solutions==
Proving click fraud can be very difficult since it is hard to know who is behind a computer and what their intentions are. When it comes to mobile ad fraud detection, data analysis can give some reliable indications. Abnormal metrics can hint at the presence of different types of frauds. To detect click fraud in the ad campaign, advertisers can focus on the following attribution points

* IP Address: As bots run similar scripts from the same server, any click fraud on mobile ads will indicate a high density of clicks coming from the same IP address or a range of similar IP addresses. Advertisers can also run check on IP addresses to verify their history with another fraud.
* Click Timestamp: Click timestamp maintains the time at which the click is made on the ad. The bot-based click fraud runs repeatedly to attempt clicking on the ads, which increases click frequency for that duration. A high range of clicks with almost similar timestamp points at the possibility of click fraud. A low duration and high frequency mean a high probability of fraud.
* Action Timestamp: Action timestamp is the time at which the user takes action on (or engages with) the app or website. With a bot-based click attack, there can be a similarity with action timestamp. As bot clicks on the advertisement and then performs the action on app or website without any delay, the advertiser can notice a low or almost no action timestamp.

Often the best an advertising network can do is to identify which clicks are most likely fraudulent and not charge the account of the advertiser. Even more sophisticated means of detection are used, but none are foolproof.

The Tuzhilin Report produced by Alexander Tuzhilin as part of a click fraud lawsuit settlement, has a detailed and comprehensive discussion of these issues. In particular, it defines &quot;the Fundamental Problem of invalid (fraudulent) clicks&quot;:
* &quot;There is no conceptual definition of invalid clicks that can be operationalized [except for certain obviously clear cases].&quot;
* &quot;An operational definition cannot be fully disclosed to the general public because of the concerns that unethical users will take advantage of it, which may lead to a massive click fraud. However, if it is not disclosed, advertisers cannot verify or even dispute why they have been charged for certain clicks.&quot;

The PPC industry is lobbying for tighter laws on the issue. Many hope to have laws that will cover those not bound by contracts.

A number of companies are developing viable solutions for click fraud identification and are developing intermediary relationships with advertising networks. Such solutions fall into two categories:

# &quot;Forensic analysis of advertisers&#x27; web server log files.&quot;&lt;br&gt;This analysis of the advertiser&#x27;s web server data requires an in-depth look at the source and behavior of the traffic. As industry standard log files are used for the analysis, the data is verifiable by advertising networks. The problem with this approach is that it relies on the honesty of the middlemen in identifying fraud.
# &quot;Third-party corroboration.&quot;&lt;br&gt;Third parties offer web-based solutions that might involve placement of single-pixel images or Javascript on the advertiser&#x27;s web pages and suitable tagging of the ads. The visitor may be presented with a cookie. Visitor information is then collected in a third-party data store and made available for download. The better offerings make it easy to highlight suspicious clicks, and they show the reasons for such a conclusion. Since an advertiser&#x27;s log files can be tampered with, their accompaniment with corroborating data from a third-party forms a more convincing body of evidence to present to the advertising network. However, the problem with third-party solutions is that such solutions see only part of the traffic of the entire network. Hence, they can be less likely to identify patterns that span several advertisers. In addition, due to the limited amount of traffic they receive when compared to middlemen, they can be overly or less aggressive when judging traffic to be fraud.

In a 2007 interview in Forbes, Google click fraud prevention expert Shuman Ghosemajumder said that one of the key challenges in click fraud detection by third-parties was access to data beyond clicks, notably, ad impression data.

Click fraud is less likely in cost per action models.

==Research==
The fact that the middlemen (search engines) have the upper hand in the operational definition of invalid clicks is the reason for the conflict of interest between advertisers and the middlemen, as described above. This is manifested in the Tuzhilin Report as described above. The Tuzhilin report did not publicly define invalid clicks and did not describe the operational definitions in detail. Rather, it gave a high-level picture of the fraud-detection system and argued that the operational definition of the search engine under investigations is &quot;reasonable&quot;. One aim of the report was to preserve the privacy of the fraud-detection system in order to maintain its effectiveness. This prompted some researchers to conduct public research on how the middlemen can fight click fraud. Since such research is presumably not tainted by market forces, there is hope that this research can be adopted to assess how rigorous a middleman is in detecting click fraud in future law cases. The fear that this research can expose the internal fraud-detection system of middlemen still applies. An example of such research is that done by Metwally, Agrawal and El Abbadi at UCSB. Other work by Majumdar, Kulkarni, and Ravishankar at UC Riverside proposes protocols for the identification of fraudulent behavior by brokers and other intermediaries in content-delivery networks.

<doc id="1012812" wikidata="Q287243" url="?curid=1012812" title="American-British-Dutch-Australian Command">
<text>The American-British-Dutch-Australian (ABDA) Command, or ABDACOM, was the short-lived supreme command for all Allied forces in South East Asia in early 1942, during the Pacific War in World War II. The command consisted of the forces of Australia, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and the United States. The main objective of the command, led by General Sir Archibald Wavell, was to maintain control of the &quot;Malay Barrier&quot; (or &quot;East Indies Barrier&quot;), a notional line running down the Malay Peninsula, through Singapore and the southernmost islands of the Dutch East Indies. ABDACOM was also known in British military circles as the &quot;South West Pacific Command&quot;, although it should not be confused with the later South West Pacific Area command (see below).

Although ABDACOM existed only for a few weeks and presided over one defeat after another, it provided some useful lessons for combined Allied commands later in the war.

==Formation==
Efforts to organise the ABDA Command began soon after war between the Allies and Japan commenced, on 7 December 1941. Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall and Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson were anxious to establish unity of command over the Allied forces in all theatres after observing Allied defeats in the Battle of France, the Mediterranean and Middle East theatre, and the attack on Pearl Harbor. 

Despite objections from the British military establishment, the scheme was finalized at the Arcadia Conference in Washington. On December 27 Marshall and Admiral Ernest King proposed an ABDA Command led by Archibald Wavell to Charles Portal, Dudley Pound, and John Dill. The British were skeptical and believed the Pacific theatre was too geographically large to be controlled by a single commander. Winston Churchill warned Marshall about the difficulties faced by Ferdinand Foch as Supreme Allied Commander while simply trying to coordinate operations across the Western Front of World War I. Marshall rebuffed this and other historical analogies from Churchill, telling him that he &quot;was not interested in Drake and Frobisher, but I was interested in having a united front against Japan.&quot; Churchill reluctantly telephoned his War Cabinet in London advising them to accept the arrangement despite their concerns. On December 29, Winston Churchill said that it had been agreed Wavell would be supreme commander in order to assuage British concerns. Wavell then held the position of British Commander-in-Chief, India. Churchill added:

It is intended that General Wavell should have a staff in the south Pacific accessible as Foch&#x27;s High Control Staff was to the Great Staffs of the British and French armies in France [during World War I]. He would receive his orders from an appropriate joint body who will be responsible to me as the Minister of Defence and to the President of the United States who is also Commander-in-Chief of all United States forces.
Following the declaration by the four nations on 1 January 1942, the Allied governments formally appointed Wavell. The formation of ABDACOM meant that Wavell had control of a huge, but thinly spread force, covering an area from Burma in the west, to Dutch New Guinea and the Commonwealth of the Philippines in the east. Other areas, including the British Raj and the Territory of Hawaii, remained officially under separate commands, and in practice General Douglas MacArthur was in complete control of Allied forces in the Philippines. At Wavell&#x27;s insistence, North West Australia (see map) was added to the ABDA area. The rest of Australia was under Australian control, as were its territories of Papua and New Guinea.

ABDA was charged with holding the Malay Barrier for as long as possible in order to retain Allied control of the Indian Ocean and the western sea approaches to Australia. This was a nearly hopeless task, given the Japanese supremacy in naval forces in the western Pacific. The task was further complicated by the addition of Burma to the command; the difficulties of coordinating action between forces of four nationalities that used different equipment and had not trained together; and the different priorities of the national governments. British leaders were primarily interested in retaining control of Singapore; the military capacity of the Dutch East Indies had suffered as a result of the defeat of the Netherlands by Nazi Germany in 1940, and the Dutch administration was focused on defending the island of Java; the Australian government was heavily committed to the war in North Africa and Europe, and had few readily accessible military resources; and the United States was preoccupied with the Philippines, which at the time was a U.S. Commonwealth territory.

Wavell arrived in Singapore, where the British Far East Command was based, on 7 January 1942. ABDACOM absorbed this British command in its entirety. On 18 January, Wavell moved his headquarters to Lembang near Bandoeng on Java. On 1 February the air force portion of ABDA moved its headquarters from Lembang to Bandoeng when it became clear that the former place lacked sufficient accommodation. This made cooperation between air and naval forces difficult.

The first notable success for forces under ABDACOM was the U.S. Navy&#x27;s attack at Balikpapan, Borneo on January 24, which cost the Japanese six transport ships, but had little effect on them capturing the prized oil wells of Borneo.

The governments of Australia, the Netherlands and New Zealand lobbied Winston Churchill for an Allied inter-governmental war council, with overall responsibility for the Allied war effort in Asia and the Pacific, based in Washington, D.C. A Far Eastern Council (later known as the Pacific War Council) was established in London on February 9, with a corresponding staff council in Washington. However, the smaller powers continued to push for a body based in the United States.

==Collapse and dissolution==
In the meantime, the rapid collapse of Allied resistance to Japanese attacks in Malaya, Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines and other countries had soon overwhelmed the Malay Barrier. The fall of Singapore on 15 February dislocated the ABDA command, which was dissolved a week later.
Wavell resigned as supreme commander on 25 February 1942, handing control of the ABDA Area to local commanders. He also recommended the establishment of two Allied commands to replace ABDACOM: a south west Pacific command, and one based in India. In anticipation of this, Wavell had handed control of Burma to the British Indian Army and reassumed his previous position, as Commander-in-Chief India.

Following the destruction of the ABDA strike force under Rear-Admiral Karel Doorman, at the Battle of the Java Sea, in February–March 1942, ABDA effectively ceased to exist.

As the Imperial Japanese Army closed in on the remaining Allied forces in the Philippines, MacArthur was ordered to relocate to Australia. On 17 March, the U.S. government appointed him as Supreme Allied Commander South West Pacific Area, a command which included Australia and New Guinea in addition to Japanese-held areas. The rest of the geographic area of the Pacific Theater of Operations remained under the Pacific Ocean Areas command, led by Commander-in-Chief Admiral Chester Nimitz of the U.S. Navy.

The inter-governmental Pacific War Council was established in Washington on 1 April, but remained largely ineffectual due to the overwhelming predominance of U.S. forces in the Pacific theater throughout the war.

Perhaps the most notable success for ABDA forces was the guerilla campaign in Timor, waged by Australian and Dutch infantry for almost 12 months after Japanese landings there on February 19.

<doc id="1012813" wikidata="Q5551972" url="?curid=1012813" title="Germanna Community College">
<text>Germanna Community College (GCC) is a community college in Virginia with campuses in Locust Grove, Fredericksburg, Stafford and Culpeper. Founded in 1970, it takes its name from Germanna, a settlement founded by Governor Alexander Spotswood for a group of German miners by the Rapidan River at what is now Germanna Ford.

Germanna Community College is one of the twenty-three community colleges in Virginia that comprise the Virginia Community College System. The college serves the residents of Caroline, Culpeper, King George, Madison, Orange, Spotsylvania, and Stafford counties and the City of Fredericksburg.

==Accreditation==
Germanna Community College is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, Commission on Colleges to award Associate&#x27;s degrees. The college&#x27;s Associate in Applied Science nursing program is accredited by the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission and both the Associate in Applied Science nursing and practical nursing certificate programs are approved by the Virginia Board of Nursing.

==Location and facilities==

===Fredericksburg Area Campus in Spotsylvania===
The Fredericksburg Area Campus in Spotsylvania is located on seventy acres in Spotsylvania County near the intersection of Interstate 95 at Routes 1 and 17 South donated by the John T. Hazel family. Phase I of the Fredericksburg Area Campus opened January, 1997. The V. Earl Dickinson Building, a 76,000 square-foot facility, includes classrooms, laboratories, library, student lounge, bookstore, and offices for faculty and administrative staff to provide a full range of services to students.

Phase II, The Workforce Development and Technology Center, a 40,000 square-foot building devoted to the use of technology for the delivery of instruction and advanced technology training programs, opened in October 2004.

Phase III, opened in 2012, is a 50,000 square-feet providing laboratories, instructional resources, student services and more. Parking decks opened at the same time. Tennis courts, playing fields, nature trails, jogging paths, and picnic areas are planned for future development of the 70-acre campus.

===Locust Grove Campus===

The Locust Grove Campus is located on Route 3 midway between Culpeper and Fredericksburg. The campus consists of 100 wooded acres donated by the Germanna Foundation in 1969, adjacent to the Rapidan River in Orange County.

The campus building of approximately 60,000 square feet includes classrooms, laboratories (including a state-of-the-art technologies laboratory), a wellness center, bookstore, administrative and faculty offices, a library, information services, business office, and student lounge. Outdoor facilities include tennis courts and a playing field, as well as nature trails, jogging paths, and a picnic area. Germanna President David Sam announced the facility is working toward obtaining $2.5 million to replace the new building, and will demolish the old building. Sam anticipates the project will take six years to finish, and has announced he has yet to approach architects.

===Daniel Technology Center (Culpeper)===

Located at the junction of U.S. Route 29 and State Route 3 adjacent to the town of Culpeper, Germanna&#x27;s Joseph R. Daniel Technology Center occupies 34 acres. The 39,000 square foot facility is designed primarily for workforce development instruction and technology training. A wide variety of credit classes are also offered. The Daniel Center includes a conference center with 700 theatre-style seats, a banquet with 300 seats, a manufacturing technology lab, an executive conference room, a training suite, and a catering kitchen. Its design also includes an interactive video theatre and a computer tech lab.

===Barbara J. Fried Center (Stafford County) ===
Germanna&#x27;s Barbara J. Fried Center in Stafford County is located at 124 Old Potomac Church Road. Germanna opened the facility in June 2018 with the support of Adam and Rhonda Fried and the Stafford County Economic Development Authority. The center provides a full range of credit courses for transfer to universities in addition to Workforce and Community Education. Stafford is also home to Germanna&#x27;s Automotive Technology Center at 42 BlackJack Road.

===Caroline Center (Ruther Glen)===

Located at 11073 Colonel Armistead Drive in Ruther Glen, the Caroline Center provides Workforce Development training in that county.

===FredCAT (Fredericksburg Center for Advanced Technology)===

Located at 1325 Central Park Blvd. in Fredericksburg, FredCAT provides Workforce Development training in a variety of fields and is a base for apprenticeship training. It opened in June 2017 with support from the Fredericksburg Economic Development Authority.

==August 23, 2011 earthquake==

On August 23, 2011 an earthquake damaged the Fredericksburg Area Campus&#x27; Dickinson Building. This was the only building with significant damage, while the damage to the other building was cosmetic.

<text>A designer drug is a structural or functional analog of a controlled substance that has been designed to mimic the pharmacological effects of the original drug, while avoiding classification as illegal and/or detection in standard drug tests. Designer drugs include psychoactive substances that have been designated by the European Union, Australia, and New Zealand, as new psychoactive substances (NPS) as well as analogs of performance-enhancing drugs such as designer steroids. 

Some of these designer drugs were originally synthesized by academic or industrial researchers in an effort to discover more potent derivatives with fewer side effects and shorter duration (and possibly also because it is easier to apply for patents for new molecules) and were later co-opted for recreational use. Other designer drugs were prepared for the first time in clandestine laboratories. Because the efficacy and safety of these substances have not been thoroughly evaluated in animal and human trials, the use of some of these drugs may result in unexpected side effects.

The development of designer drugs may be considered a subfield of drug design. The exploration of modifications to known active drugs—such as their structural analogues, stereoisomers, and derivatives—yields drugs that may differ significantly in effects from their &quot;parent&quot; drug (e.g., showing increased potency, or decreased side effects). In some instances, designer drugs have similar effects to other known drugs, but have completely dissimilar chemical structures (e.g. JWH-018 vs THC). Despite being a very broad term, applicable to almost every synthetic drug, it is often used to connote synthetic recreational drugs, sometimes even those which have not been designed at all (e.g. LSD, the psychedelic side effects of which were discovered unintentionally).

In some jurisdictions, drugs that are highly similar in structure to a prohibited drug are illegal to trade regardless of that drug&#x27;s legal status (or indeed whether or not the structurally similar analogue has similar pharmacological effects). In other jurisdictions, their trade is a legal grey area, making them grey market goods. Some jurisdictions may have analogue laws which ban drugs similar in chemical structure to other prohibited drugs, while some designer drugs may be prohibited irrespective of the legal status of structurally similar drugs; in both cases, their trade may take place on the black market.

==History==
===United States===

====1920s–1930s====
Following the passage of the second International Opium Convention in 1925, which specifically banned morphine and the diacetyl ester of morphine, heroin, a number of alternative esters of morphine quickly started to be manufactured and sold. The most notable of these were dibenzoylmorphine and acetylpropionylmorphine, which have virtually identical effects to heroin but were not covered by the Opium Convention. This then led the Health Committee of the League of Nations to pass several resolutions attempting to bring these new drugs under control, ultimately leading in 1930 to the first broad analogues provisions extending legal control to all esters of morphine, oxycodone and hydromorphone. Another early example of what could loosely be termed designer drug use, was during the Prohibition era in the 1930s, when diethyl ether was sold and used as an alternative to illegal alcoholic beverages in a number of countries.

====1960s–1970s====
During the 1960s and 1970s, a number of new synthetic hallucinogens were introduced, with a notable example being the sale of highly potent tablets of DOM in San Francisco in 1967. There was little scope to prosecute people over drug analogues at this time, with new compounds instead being added to the controlled drug schedules one by one as they became a problem. One significant court case from this period was in 1973, when Tim Scully and Nicholas Sand were prosecuted for making the acetyl amide of LSD, known as ALD-52. At this time ALD-52 was not a controlled drug, but they were convicted on the grounds that in order to make ALD-52, they would have had to be in possession of LSD, which was illegal. The late 1970s also saw the introduction of various analogues of phencyclidine (PCP) to the illicit market.

====1980s–early 1990s====
The modern use of the term designer drug was coined in the 1980s to refer to various synthetic opioid drugs, based mostly on the fentanyl molecule (such as α-methylfentanyl). The term gained widespread popularity when MDMA (ecstasy) experienced a popularity boom in the mid-1980s. When the term was coined in the 1980s, a wide range of narcotics were being sold as heroin on the black market. Many were based on fentanyl or meperidine. One, MPPP, was found in some cases to contain an impurity called MPTP, which caused brain damage that could result in a syndrome identical to late stage Parkinson&#x27;s disease, from only a single dose. Other problems were highly potent fentanyl analogues that caused many accidental overdoses.

Because the government was powerless to prosecute people for these drugs until after they had been marketed successfully, laws were passed to give the DEA power to emergency schedule chemicals for a year, with an optional 6-month extension, while gathering evidence to justify permanent scheduling, as well as the analogue laws mentioned previously. Emergency-scheduling power was used for the first time for MDMA. In this case, the DEA scheduled MDMA as a Schedule I drug and retained this classification after review, even though their own judge ruled that MDMA should be classified Schedule III on the basis of its demonstrated uses in medicine. The emergency scheduling power has subsequently been used for a variety of other drugs including 2C-B, AMT, and BZP. In 2004, a piperazine drug, TFMPP, became the first drug that had been emergency-scheduled to be denied permanent scheduling and revert to legal status.

The late 1980s and early 1990s also saw the re-emergence of methamphetamine in the United States as a widespread public health issue, leading to increasing controls on precursor chemicals in an attempt to cut down on domestic manufacture of the drug. This led to several alternative stimulant drugs emerging, the most notable ones being methcathinone and 4-methylaminorex, but, despite attracting enough attention from authorities to provoke legal scheduling of these compounds, their distribution was relatively limited in extent and methamphetamine continued to dominate the illicit synthetic stimulant market overall.

====Late 1990s–2004====
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was a huge explosion in designer drugs being sold over the internet. The term and concept of &quot;research chemicals&quot; was coined by some marketers of designer drugs (in particular, of psychedelic drugs in the tryptamine and phenethylamine family). The idea was that, by selling the chemicals as for &quot;scientific research&quot; rather than human consumption, the intent clause of the U.S. analogue drug laws would be avoided. Nonetheless, the DEA raided multiple suppliers, first JLF Primary Materials, and then multiple vendors (such as RAC Research) several years later in Operation Web Tryp. This process was accelerated greatly when vendors began advertising via search engines like Google by linking their sites to searches on key words such as chemical names and terms like psychedelic or hallucinogen. Widespread discussion of consumptive use and the sources for the chemicals in public forums also drew the attention of the media and authorities.

In 2004, the US Drug Enforcement Administration raided and shut down several Internet-based research chemical vendors in an operation called &quot;Web Tryp&quot;. With help from the authorities in India and China, two chemical manufacturers were also closed. Many other internet-based vendors promptly stopped doing business, even though their products were still legal throughout much of the world.

Most substances that were sold as &quot;research chemicals&quot; in this period of time are hallucinogens and bear a chemical resemblance to drugs such as psilocybin and mescaline. As with other hallucinogens, these substances are often taken for the purposes of facilitating spiritual processes, mental reflection or recreation. Some research chemicals on the market were not psychoactive, but can be used as precursors in the synthesis of other potentially psychoactive substances, for example, 2C-H, which could be used to make 2C-B and 2C-I among others. Extensive surveys of structural variations have been conducted by pharmaceutical corporations, universities and independent researchers over the last century, from which some of the presently available research chemicals derive. One particularly notable researcher is Alexander Shulgin, who presented syntheses and pharmacological explorations of hundreds of substances in the books &quot;TiHKAL&quot; and &quot;PiHKAL&quot; (co-authored with Ann Shulgin), and served as an expert witness for the defense in several court cases against manufacturers of psychoactive drugs.

The majority of chemical suppliers sold research chemicals in bulk form as powder, not as pills, as selling in pill form would invalidate the claims that they were being sold for non-consumptive research. Active dosages vary widely from substance to substance, ranging from micrograms to hundreds of milligrams, but while it is critical for the end user to weigh doses with a precision scale, instead of guessing (&quot;eyeballing&quot;), many users did not do this and this led to many emergency room visits and several deaths, which were a prominent factor leading to the emergency scheduling of several substances and eventually Operation Web Tryp. Some compounds such as 2C-B and 5-Meo-DiPT did eventually increase in popularity to the point that they were sold in pill form to reach a wider market, and acquired popular street names (&quot;Nexus&quot; and &quot;Foxy,&quot; respectively). Once a chemical reaches this kind of popularity, it is usually just a matter of time before it is added to the list of scheduled (i.e., illegal) drugs.

The late 1990s and early 2000s also saw the first widespread use of novel anabolic steroids by athletes in competition. Steroids had been banned by the International Olympic Committee since 1976, but due to the large number of different anabolic agents available for human and veterinary use, the ability of laboratories to test for all available drugs had always lagged behind the ability of athletes to find new compounds to use. The introduction of increasingly formalised testing procedures, especially with the creation of the World Anti-Doping Agency in 1999, made it much more difficult for athletes to get away with using these drugs without detection, which then led to the synthesis of novel and potent anabolic steroid drugs such as tetrahydrogestrinone (THG), which were not detectable by the standard tests.

====2005–2021====
While through recent history most designer drugs had been either opioids, hallucinogens, or anabolic steroids, the range of possible compounds is limited only by the scientific and patent literature, and recent years have been characterised by a broadening of the range of compounds sold as designer drugs. These have included a wide variety of designer stimulants such as geranamine, mephedrone, MDPV and desoxypipradrol, several designer sedatives such as methylmethaqualone and premazepam, and designer analogues of sildenafil (Viagra), which have been reported as active compounds in &quot;herbal&quot; aphrodisiac products. Designer cannabinoids are another recent development, with two compounds JWH-018 and (C8)-CP 47,497 initially found in December 2008 as active components of &quot;herbal smoking blends&quot; sold as legal alternatives to marijuana. Subsequently, a growing range of synthetic cannabinoid agonists have continued to appear, including by 2010, novel compounds such as RCS-4, RCS-8, and AB-001, which had never been reported in the literature, and appear to have been invented by designer drug manufacturers themselves. Another novel development is the use of research ligands for cosmetic rather than strictly recreational purposes, such as grey-market internet sales of the non-approved alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone tanning drugs known as melanotan peptides.

Mephedrone and the cathinones marked somewhat of a turning point for designer drugs, turning them from little known, ineffective substances sold in head shops to powerful substances able to compete with classical drugs on the black market. Mephedrone especially experienced a somewhat meteoric rise in popularity in 2009 and the resulting media panic resulted in its prohibition in multiple countries. Following this there was a considerable emergence of other cathinones which attempted to mimic the effects of mephedrone, and with a newly attracted customer base, plenty of money to drive innovation.

Subsequently, the market rapidly expanded, with more and more substances being detected every year. In 2009, the EMCDDA&#x27;s early warning system discovered 24 new drugs. In 2010, it found another 41; in 2011, another 49; and in 2012, there were 73 more. In 2013, a further 81 were identified: a total of 268 new drugs in just four years. These have not been limited to cathinones, with 35% being cannabinoids and the rest being composed of stimulants, benzodiazepines, psychedelics, dissociatives and to a lesser extent, every other class of drugs, even ibogoids and nootropics. The largest group of drugs being monitored by the EMCDDA is synthetic cannabinoids, with 209 different synthetic cannabinoids reported between 2008 and 2021 - including 11 new cannabinoids identified for the first time in 2020.

==== 2022–present ====
In the early 2020s, safety and legal difficulty of regulating peptides spurred the growth of grey-market synthetic peptide hormone vendors. These peptides are marketed as non-recreational and sold for their purported anti-aging, performance enhancing and cosmetic benefits, such vendors may employ medical professionals using legal ambiguity for their operations.

== Terminology ==
Many terms exist other than &quot;designer drug&quot; often depending on the context and geographical region. For example, the term new psychoactive substance (NPS) is more commonly used in academic settings, and in regions such as Australia, New Zealand, and European Union, including United Kingdom (UK).

===Common names===
In the UK to avoid being controlled by the Medicines Act, designer drugs such as mephedrone have been described as &quot;plant food&quot;, despite the compounds having no history of being used for these purposes.

In the US, similar descriptions (&quot;bath salts&quot; is the most common) have been used to describe mephedrone as well as methylone and methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV). Combined with labeling that they are &quot;not for human consumption,&quot; these descriptions are an attempt to skirt the Federal Analog Act which forbids drugs that are &quot;substantially similar&quot; to already classified drugs from being sold for human use.

Synthetic cannabinoids are known under a variety of names including K2, Spice, Black Mamba, Bombay Blue, Genie, Zohai, Banana Cream Nuke, Krypton, and Lava Red. They are often called &quot;synthetic marijuana,&quot; &quot;herbal incense,&quot; or &quot;herbal smoking blends&quot; and often labeled &quot;not for human consumption.&quot;

==Safety==
The safety of research chemicals is untested and little if any research has been done on the toxicology or pharmacology of most of these drugs. Few, if any, human or animal studies have been done. Many research compounds have produced unexpected side-effects and adverse incidents due to the lack of screening for off-target effects prior to marketing; both bromo-dragonfly and mephedrone seem to be capable of producing pronounced vasoconstriction under some circumstances, which has resulted in several deaths, although the mechanism remains unclear. Substituted phenethylamines such as the 2C family and substituted amphetamines such as the DOx family have also caused a limited number of deaths.

==Law==
Due to the recent development of many designer drugs, laws banning or regulating their use have not been developed yet, and in recent cases novel drugs have appeared directly in response to legislative action, to replace a similar compound that had recently been banned. Many of the chemicals fall under the various drug analogue legislations in certain countries, but most countries have no general analogue act or equivalent legislation and so novel compounds may fall outside of the law after only minor structural modifications.

In the United States, the Controlled Substances Act was amended by the Controlled Substance Analogue Enforcement of 1986, which attempted to ban designer drugs pre-emptively by making it illegal to manufacture, sell, or possess chemicals that were substantially similar in chemistry and pharmacology to Schedule I or Schedule II drugs.

Other countries have dealt with the issue differently. In some, the new drugs are banned as they become a concern, as in Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Sweden. In Sweden, the police and customs may also seize drugs that are not on the list of drugs covered by the anti-drug laws if the police suspect that the purpose of the holding is related to drug abuse. Following a decision by a prosecutor, the police may destroy the seized drugs.

In Ireland, the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010 bans substances based on their psychoactive effect, and was introduced as a catch-all to address the time lag between new substances appearing and their being banned individually. In the United Kingdom, the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016 adopts a similar approach.

Some countries, such as Australia, have enacted generic bans but based on chemical structure rather than psychoactive effect: if a chemical fits a set of rules regarding substitutions and alterations of an already-banned drug, then it too is banned. Brazil adopted the same model as Australia, in a recent ruling from ANVISA, which is responsible to define what constitute drugs.

===Temporary class drug===

A temporary class drug is a relatively new status for controlled drugs, which has been adopted in some jurisdictions, notably New Zealand and the United Kingdom, to attempt to bring newly synthesized designer drugs under legal control. The controlled drug legislation in these jurisdictions requires drug scheduling decisions to follow an evidence-based process, where the harms of the drug are assessed and reviewed so that an appropriate legal status can be assigned. Since many designer drugs sold in recent years have had little or no published research that could help inform such a decision, they have been widely sold as &quot;legal highs&quot;, often for months, before sufficient evidence accumulates to justify placing them on the controlled drug schedules.

<text>ABC Motors Limited (&quot;All British (Engine) Company&quot;) of Hersham, Surrey, England was a manufacturer of cars, aircraft, motor scooters, and engines for road and air. Established by Ronald Charteris in Hersham, Surrey in 1912, its chief designer was the young and talented Granville Bradshaw. It was absorbed into Vickers in 1951 and the factory finally closed in the 1970s. Last occupied by Ian Allan Publishing as Hersham&#x27;s Riverdene Industrial Estate, the factory was demolished around 2017-2018 and redeveloped as a Lidl supermarket (opened February 2019) with flats above.

The ABC radial aero engines of the World War I period were extremely advanced for their time, and were initially thought to be very promising indeed. Unfortunately they were all more or less plagued by problems – and although a number of types for the Royal Air Force were designed around ABC engines (especially the ill-fated &quot;Dragonfly&quot;) none saw squadron service with the RAF.

ABC also made a large number of engines for electrical generators and other purposes – mostly with a flat twin cylinder layout and unusual exhaust-over-inlet valve configuration. These smaller ABC engines have the distinction of being possibly the first airborne APUs- the Coastal class blimp (first flown in 1916) had a 1.5-horsepower unit installed to provide electricity for the onboard wireless set, whilst a similar engine was used to power the searchlight of the sole Supermarine Nighthawk &#x27;Zeppelin killer&#x27; of 1917.

<doc id="1012835" wikidata="Q78678" url="?curid=1012835" title="Hermann Höfle">
<text>Hermann Julius Höfle, also Hans (or) Hermann Hoefle (; 19 June 1911 – 21 August 1962), was an Austrian-born SS commander and Holocaust perpetrator during the Nazi era. He was deputy to Odilo Globočnik in the &quot;Aktion Reinhard&quot; program, serving as his main deportation and extermination expert. Arrested in 1961 in connection with these crimes, Höfle died via suicide by hanging in prison before he was tried.

==SS career ==
Born in Salzburg, Austria, Höfle joined the Nazi Party on 1 August 1933, with party number 307,469. He joined the SS at the same time. Before the war, he worked as an auto mechanic. Due to illegal political activities, he was imprisoned in Salzburg from 25 May 1935 to 1 January 1936.

=== Crimes against humanity ===
After the conquest of Poland, Höfle served in Nowy Sącz, in Southern Poland. In November 1940 he served as an overseer of a Jewish labour camp southeast of Lublin. Up to December 1941 Höfle was in Mogilev. He was involved in deportations to the camps of Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka. He lived and worked from the Aktion Reinhard headquarters with the Julius Schreck Barracks, Ostland Strasse, in Lublin.

Höfle was &quot;Coordinator&quot; of Operation Reinhard and chief of staff to Odilo Globočnik, serving as his main deportation and extermination expert. Alongside Christian Wirth, Höfle had chief authority of Operation Reinhard beside Globočnik. At the beginning of the operation, he held the rank of SS-&quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; (captain). SS members, including those from Action T4 who were assigned to the operation, reported to the headquarters in Lublin and were instructed to their duties by Höfle. For an example of the limited paperwork, every member of Operation Reinhard signed the following declaration of secrecy:


As head of the &quot;Main Department&quot; (&quot;Hauptabteilung&quot;), Höfle was in charge of the organization and manpower of Operation Reinhard. He coordinated the deportations of Jews from all areas of the General Government and directed them to one of the extermination camps. The deportation orders were coordinated and channeled through SS authorities from Höfle&#x27;s office for the Lublin reservation, through the district SS and Police Leaders, down to the localities where the expulsions were to take place.

Around May 1942 in the General Government, a substitution policy developed for a short time in which Polish workers who were sent to the German Reich were gradually replaced with Jewish laborers. It became standard procedure to stop deportation trains from the Reich and Slovakia in Lublin in order to select able-bodied Jews for work in the General Government, the others being sent on to their deaths in Belzec. In this way, many Jews were temporarily spared death and instead relegated to forced labor. Höfle was one of the chief supporters and implementers of this policy.

Höfle personally oversaw the deportation of the Warsaw Ghetto, the so-called Großaktion Warschau. The operation was preceded on 20 and 21 July 1942 by a spree of randomly killing actions along the streets of the Ghetto and by the arrest and brutal imprisonment of many others taken as hostages among counselors, department managers and those connected in a way or another to the Judenrat. All this was to intimidate and soften the Judenrat to the new upcoming measures. The day after, in the morning of 22 July, &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; Höfle, accompanied by an entourage of SS and government officials, arrived at the Judenrat in the Warsaw Ghetto and announced to the chairman, Adam Czerniaków, that the Jews, regardless of sex or age and with but a few exceptions, were to be evacuated to the East. The exceptions were workers in German factories who had valid work permits, Judenrat employees, the Jewish Ghetto Police, hospital patients and employees, and the families of the exempt. The deportees were allowed to carry with them 15 kg of baggage, food for three days, money, gold, and other valuables. The order also called for 6,000 Jews to report to the Umschlagplatz every day by 4 p.m. to board the trains for deportation.

Adam Czerniaków wrote in his diary on 22 July 1942, the day before he died by suicide: 

Höfle also played a key role in the Harvest Festival massacre of Jewish inmates of the various labour camps in the Lublin district in early November 1943. Approximately 43,000 Jews were murdered during this operation which was the single largest German massacre of Jews in the entire war. Höfle rejoined Globočnik in Trieste, after various missions in the Netherlands and Belgium.

===Höfle Telegram===
On 11 January 1943, Höfle sent a radiogram from Lublin to SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Franz Heim in Kraków, who was at the time the deputy commander of the Security Police and SD in the General Government, and to SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Adolf Eichmann in Berlin. The message documented the total deportations of Jews to the four Operation Reinhard camps through 31 of December 1942. Today this document is called the Höfle Telegram.

==After the war; arrest and suicide==
On 31 May 1945 Höfle was found hiding in Möslacher Alm near the Weissensee Lake in Carinthia (Southern Austria) by the British, along with SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Odilo Globocnik and SS-&quot;Sturmbannführers&quot; Ernst Lerch and Georg Michalsen. After two years in the British interrogation center Wolfsberg (Carinthia), he was released to the Austrian judicial system. On 30 October 1947, under oath, he was released to continue his earlier occupation as an auto mechanic in his birthplace, Salzburg.

After an extradition request on 9 July 1948 by the Polish government, he fled to Italy, where he lived under a false name until 1951. Later he returned to Austria and then emigrated to West Germany. There he was employed briefly as an informant for U.S. Army Counterintelligence.

Höfle returned to Salzburg, where he lived as a free man until 2 January 1961, when he was arrested by the Austrian authorities and sent to prison in Vienna, where in 1962 he hanged himself before his trial could begin.

<text>Nicholas of Lyra (;  – October 1349), or Nicolaus Lyranus, a Franciscan teacher, was among the most influential practitioners of biblical exegesis in the Middle Ages. Little is known about his youth, aside from the fact of his birth, around 1270, in Lyre, Normandy.

==Biography==
Rumors from the fifteenth century that Nicholas was born into a religiously-Jewish family have been dismissed by some modern scholars. For example, Deanna Copeland Klepper cites that &quot;as his fifteenth-century critic, Bishop Paul of Burgos (a converted Jew himself) noted, Nicolas’s knowledge of Hebrew and rabbinic interpretation was too limited to reflect a Jewish upbringing.&quot;

In 1291, he entered the Franciscan order in the convent of Verneuil-sur-Avre. He was a doctor at the Sorbonne by 1309 and ten years later was appointed the head of all Franciscans in France. His major work, &quot;Postillae perpetuae in universam S. Scripturam,&quot; was the first printed commentary on the Bible. Printed in Rome in 1471, it was later available in Venice, Basel, and elsewhere. In it, each page of biblical text was printed in the upper center of the page and embedded in a surrounding commentary (&quot;illustration, right&quot;). His &quot;Postilla super totam Bibliam&quot; was published by Johannes Mentelin of Strasbourg in 1472.

Nicolas of Lyra&#x27;s approach to explicating Scripture was firmly based on the literal sense, which for him is the foundation of all mystical or allegorical or anagogical expositions. He deplored the tortured and elaborated readings being given to Scripture in his time. The textual basis was so important that he urged that errors be corrected with reference to Hebrew texts, an early glimmer of techniques of textual criticism, though Nicholas recognized the authoritative value of the Church&#x27;s Tradition:
Nicholas utilized all sources available to him, fully mastered Hebrew and drew copiously from Rashi and other rabbinic commentaries, the &quot;Pugio Fidei&quot; of Raymond Martini and of course the commentaries of Thomas Aquinas. His lucid and concise exposition, his soundly-based observations made &quot;Postillae&quot; the most-consulted manual of exegesis until the 16th century. Martin Luther depended upon it. He used his commentaries extensively in his own work on the book of Genesis, &quot;Lectures on Genesis&quot;. He also highly praised his works in the Table Talk. When E. A. Gosselin compiled a listing of the printed editions of works by Nicolaus de Lyra, it ran to 27 pages (in &quot;Traditio 26&quot; (1970), pp 399–426).

He was born in the village of La Vieille-Lyre, Normandy, hence his name. Like others in the 14th century, he was occupied by the possibility of the conversion of the Jews, to whom he dedicated hortatory addresses. He wrote &quot;Pulcherrimae quaestiones Iudaicam perfidiam in catholicam fide improbantes&quot;, which was one of the sources Martin Luther used in his &quot;On the Jews and Their Lies&quot;.

<text>Catch the Fire World is a global non-denominational Charismatic Christian ministry that includes churches, music, books, schools and events.

Its flagship church and largest location is Catch the Fire Church in Toronto. This church is the birthplace and center of the Toronto Blessing, a religious revival and phenomenon in charismatic Christianity during the 1990s.

==History==
Pastors John and Carol Arnott founded the church around 1988. The church later joined John Wimber&#x27;s Vineyard movement and was known as Toronto Airport Vineyard Church. It met in various rented locations throughout Toronto until the early 1990s when the church found a more permanent home near the Lester B. Pearson Airport.

In January 1994, Randy Clark, a Vineyard pastor, was invited to preach. John Arnott heard that Clark had attended a conference with Rodney Howard-Browne and had been greatly impacted by Howard-Browne&#x27;s ministry. The revival started during Clark&#x27;s two-month visit but continued after he left. Some religious leaders criticized the church and revival because of the teachings and manifestations that occurred. Wimber initially defended the Airport Vineyard saying &quot;Nearly everything we&#x27;ve seen—falling, weeping, laughing, shaking—has been seen before, not only in our own memory, but in revivals all over the world.&quot;

Nevertheless, the church withdrew or was expelled, according to some, from the Vineyard. Wimber explained the circumstances surrounding the split in a &quot;Christianity Today&quot; interview, saying that the revival at Toronto was &quot;changing our definition of renewal in Vineyard&quot; and that &quot;[the Vineyard&#x27;s] decision was to withdraw endorsement; [TACF&#x27;s] decision was to resign&quot;.

After the break with Wimber and the Vineyard in 1995, the church was renamed Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship. It founded Partners in Harvest, a group of churches that shared similar beliefs. In 2006, the Arnotts resigned as senior pastors to pursue a new ministry, Catch the Fire. They were succeeded by Steve and Sandra Long.

The Arnotts now hold the position of Founding Pastors, and the church was renamed in 2010 as Catch the Fire Toronto, to reflect the &quot;fire&quot; of God spreading to other congregations around the world, unifying them.

After more than two decades of hosting revival, John and Carol as Senior Leaders passed on the baton to Duncan and Kate Smith in September 2015.

In 2019, pastors and leaders from both Partners in Harvest and Catch The Fire announced the integration of the two movements. The vision to integrate was that both Partners in Harvest and Catch The Fire will be &quot;“stronger together.”&quot; This will fulfill their God-given destiny, to invest in leaders, strengthen the local church, and resource missional initiatives.

==Beliefs and Practices==
At TACF revival services, worshippers have exhibited unusual behaviours that they attribute to an encounter with God and the presence of the Holy Spirit. The most common described behaviours include laughter (often referred to as &quot;holy laughter&quot;), weeping, deep bowing, shaking, &quot;drunkenness&quot; (a reference to Acts 2:13-15 and Ephesians 5:18), slain in the Spirit and speaking in tongues. Other less common behaviours include producing sounds that resemble animals, such as roaring like lions.

The TACF website described it thus:

The Toronto Blessing is a transferable anointing. In its most visible form it overcomes worshippers with outbreaks of laughter, weeping, groaning, shaking, falling, &#x27;drunkenness,&#x27; and even behaviours that have been described as a &#x27;cross between a jungle and a farmyard.&#x27;

The church is also the site where the prophecy of the golden sword was given.

The statement of faith of Catch the Fire Church can be found on their main website.

== Music ==
Catch The Fire Music is a collective of worship artists and worship leaders affiliated with Catch The Fire. They have produced several live albums recorded at conferences.

<doc id="1012855" wikidata="Q1414936" url="?curid=1012855" title="Blockbuster bomb">
<text>A blockbuster bomb or cookie was one of several of the largest conventional bombs used in World War II by the Royal Air Force (RAF). The term &quot;blockbuster&quot; was originally a name coined by the press and referred to a bomb which had enough explosive power to destroy an entire street or large building through the effects of blast in conjunction with incendiary bombs.

==Design==
Blockbuster bombs were the RAF&#x27;s high capacity (HC) bombs. Their especially thin casings allowed them to contain approximately three-quarters of their weight in explosive, with a 4,000 lb bomb (nominal weight) containing about Amatol, RDX or Torpex. Most general-purpose bombs, termed medium capacity&#x27; (MC) by the RAF, contained 50% explosive by weight, the remainder comprised primarily of the fragmentation casing. Blockbusters increased in size as the war progressed, rising from the original version to up to .

The 4000 lb HC Mark I bomb – actual weight around – was a welded, cylindrical shell of thick steel. The body of the bomb was in diameter and long with a conical nose. It had a long lightweight, empty cylindrical tail onto which a closed end was fitted, amounting to a total length of . A T-section steel beam was welded to the inner surface of the bomb to strengthen it. Subsequent Mark II and Mark III HC bombs differed in detail; the conical nose was replaced with a domed nose and the number of fuzes was increased from one to three to guarantee detonation. The Mark IV bomb did not have the T-section beam and the Mark V and Mark VI bombs were versions manufactured in the United States.
The larger bomb was constructed from two sections, of a larger diameter, that fitted together with bolts. A version was created by adding a third 4000 lb section and should not be confused with the 12,000lb Tallboy ground-penetrating &quot;earthquake&quot; bomb.

The 4000 lb high-capacity design was little more than a cylinder full of explosives: it was un-aerodynamic and lacked fins. The comparable American &quot;4,000 pound LC Bomb AN-M56&quot; was - like other US bombs - aerodynamically designed, with a sheet metal tailfin assembly and shaped nose and aft sections. When fitted with a conical nose and a drum tail, the blockbuster bomb would fall straight down. These bombs were designed for their blast effect, to cause damage to buildings, specifically to blow roof tiles off, so that the following barrage of small incendiary bombs could reach the building interiors unimpeded. In contrast to the American AN-M56 ordnance, cylindrical HC-class bombs were used only by the RAF and associated Commonwealth air forces, the only air forces who&#x27;s bombers had bomb bays large enough to hold them.

In 1947 Alfred Cecil Brooks of Stourbridge was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for creating the Blockbuster, although his citation was worded &quot;outstanding services to the King of a nature that cannot be revealed&quot;. The local newspaper referred to him as &quot;Blockbuster Brooks&quot;.

==Operational use==

The first type of aircraft to carry bombs operationally was the Wellington during a strike on Emden in April 1941; carriage of the bomb required the bomb beam to be removed from the bomb bay and a slot cut in the bomb doors - the bomb protruded slightly through this and, on release, simply fell out through the hole. The bomb later became part of the standard bomb load of the RAF&#x27;s heavy night bombers and Mosquitoes of the Light Night Strike Force, whose aircraft would sometimes bomb Berlin twice in one night, flown by two different crews.

The 2,000 lb HC was used until the end of the war, its usage peaking in 1944 with over 16,000 dropped.

The and the could be carried only by the Avro Lancaster which needed to be slightly modified with bulged bomb-bay doors.

The first use of the HC was by 15 Squadron Lancasters against Berlin on 2 December 1943. Bad weather and other factors meant their effectiveness was not noted.

The &quot;cookie&quot; was regarded as a particularly dangerous load to carry. Due to the airflow over the detonating pistols fitted in the nose, it would often explode even if dropped in a supposedly &quot;safe&quot; unarmed state. The safe height above ground for dropping the &quot;cookie&quot; was ; any lower and the dropping aircraft risked being damaged by the explosion&#x27;s atmospheric shock wave:
617 Squadron developed a technique of dropping a 1,000 lb MC bomb just before a 12,000 lb HC bomb. The shock wave from the 1,000 lb explosion fired the pistols on the 12,000 lb bomb, causing an &quot;air burst&quot;; this technique was used successfully in attacks including the Michelin factory at Clermont-Ferrand in March 1944.

==Post-war unexploded ordnance==
An unusual dry period led to low river levels in the Rhine in December 2011, exposing a 4,000 lb HC bomb in the riverbed near Koblenz. A radius of around the bomb site (containing about 45,000 people) was evacuated while the bomb was defused. Another unexploded blockbuster was found in Dortmund in November 2013, requiring the evacuation of more than 20,000 people from the area. Other bombs were found and defused in Vicenza on 29 April 2001 and 25 April 2014. In 2001, defusing operations required the evacuation of 70,000 within a radius of , while in 2014 defusing operations required the evacuation of 30,000 within a radius of .

On 19 December 2016, a British bomb identified as a 4,000 lb HC blockbuster was discovered in Augsburg, Germany. It was defused on Christmas Day, requiring evacuation of more than 54,000 people within a radius of 1.5 km.

On 29 August 2017, another British HC 4000 lb bomb was discovered during construction work near the Goethe University in Frankfurt, requiring the evacuation of approximately 65,000 people within a radius of . This was the largest evacuation in Germany since the Second World War.

On 8 April 2018, an HC 4000 lb bomb was discovered during gardening jobs in Paderborn, near the local university, leading to the evacuation of 26,400 people while the bomb was defused.

On 20 March 2024, a MK IV bomb was found in a construction site in Viterbo, Italy causing an evacuation of more than 30,000 people in a range of 1400m from the discover site.

==Bombs==
===2,000 lb HC===
Design of a 2,000 lb to meet requirements of similar size to existing 1900 lb GP bomb was by Vickers with parachute arrangements by the RAF; this was at the same time Woolwich was designing the 4000 lb bomb. Actual case construction was by Great Western Railway Company. Live tests began at start of 1941; a few were used operationally in late 1941 with parachute dropping and delay timer. The parachute requirement was dropped and from early 1942 they were used with conventional tail. Improved Mark II and Mark III (with different fuse positions) followed in 1943. Actual weight was for Mark II and III with 71% charge to weight filling of 60/40 or 50/50 Amatol, RDX/TNT 60/40, or Torpex 2.

===4,000 lb HC===
* Mark I: first production design
* Mark II: three nose pistols
* Mark III: no side pistol pockets
* Mark IV: no stiffening beam
* Mark V: U.S. production
* Mark VI: U.S. production

Filling was Amatol, RDX/TNT, Minol, or Torpex.
In 1943, 25,000 of these were used; this rose to 38,000 in 1944. In 1945 up to the end of the war a further 25,000 were used.

===8,000 lb HC===
* Mk I
* Mk II
Actual weight with charge to weight ratio of 68%. Filling was &#x27;Amatex 9&#x27; or &#x27;Torpex 2&#x27;. Bombs were produced from 1942 to 1945.

===12,000 lb HC===
* Mk I
* Mk II

Charge weight ratio of 80%. Filling was Amatex or Torpex. 170 were produced in the last two years of the war.

==Other uses==

===Air mines===
During The Blitz the Germans used naval mines dropped with parachutes as improvised blockbusters. Their fuse was triggered by the shock of landing, with the bomb exploding after a 17-second delay. As the bomb was not in a crater, the force of the blast would disperse laterally, causing extensive damage. The large raid on Coventry on 14–15 November 1940 included the use of 50 parachute mines, which caused extensive blast damage. The British called these devices &quot;air-mines&quot;, a calque of the German term &quot;Luftmine&quot;. These types were used also during air raids on Malta, especially on its harbour areas.

<text>Acidman (often stylized as ACIDMAN) is a Japanese rock group. The band was formed in 1997 with four members, Shiibashi Takeshi, Urayama Ichigo, Satou Masatoshi, and Ohki Nobuo. They created two demo tapes together in 1998, but former vocalist Shiibashi Takeshi left in 1999. Ohki Nobuo took his place and became the leader of the group. They continued playing live concerts, and were eventually signed to Toshiba-EMI. The band is often categorized as punk music or alternative rock but their musical style is broader and is said to blend various kinds of individual styles.

Ohki Nobuo paints many of the band&#x27;s album covers.

<text>A speeder (also known as a section car, railway motor car, putt-putt, track-maintenance car, crew car, jigger, trike, quad, trolley, inspection car, or draisine) is a small railcar used around the world by track inspectors and work crews to move quickly to and from work sites. Although slow compared to a train or car, it is called &quot;speeder&quot; because it is faster than a human-powered vehicle such as a handcar. Motorized inspection cars date back to at least 1895, when the Kalamazoo Manufacturing Company started building gasoline-engined inspection cars.

In the 1990s, many speeders were replaced by pickup trucks or sport utility vehicles with additional flanged wheels that could be lowered for travelling on rails, called &quot;road–rail vehicles&quot; or hi-rails for &quot;highway-railroad&quot;. Speeders are collected by hobbyists, who refurbish them for excursions organized by the North American Railcar Operators Association in the U.S. and Canada and the Australian Society of Section Car Operators, Inc. in Australia.

== Motorcar manufacturers and models ==

Various railways and their workshops also manufactured speeders. Often these were a copy of commercially available cars, such as Wickham and Fairmont.

== Dimensions ==
Approximate dimensions of a common speeder car are given below. Due to the variety of base models and customization these are not fixed numbers. These values are from a Fairmont A4-D.

<doc id="1012887" wikidata="Q2525814" url="?curid=1012887" title="Early modern warfare">
<text>Early modern warfare is the era of warfare during early modern period following medieval warfare. It is associated with the start of the widespread use of gunpowder and the development of suitable weapons to use the explosive, including artillery and firearms; for this reason the era is also referred to as the age of gunpowder warfare (a concept introduced by Michael Roberts in the 1950s). 

Fortification techniques evolved rapidly due to the development of artillery. Firearms revolutionized warfare, diminishing the role of aristocracies and heavy cavalry. Early firearms, like arquebuses and muskets, gradually replaced bows and crossbows, leading to the introduction and decline of plate armor as firearms became more effective. Flintlock muskets became dominant by the 1690s, and the invention of the bayonet combined pikes and muskets, transforming infantry into the most crucial military force. Warfare also saw a shift towards larger armies and more devastating conflicts. The rise of centralized states and bureaucracies supported the new, massive armies, while the use of mercenaries declined. Military formations adapted to these changes. Infantry relied on columns, lines, and squares for battle, while cavalry transitioned to lighter roles focused on scouting and flanking. Despite the decline in heavy cavalry&#x27;s dominance, cavalry charges remained effective under specific conditions, particularly against undisciplined infantry. The Age of Sail (usually dated as 1571–1862) was a period roughly corresponding to the early modern period and gunpowder dominated the era&#x27;s naval tactics, including the use of gunpowder in naval artillery.

Wars became longer and more destructive, often causing widespread civilian suffering:

*In the Horn of Africa, the Adal&#x27;s conquest of Ethiopia involving of the Ottomans, Mamluks and the Portuguese.
* In Asia, the Persia–Portugal war, the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598), the Mughal conquests, Nader&#x27;s Campaigns, the Anglo-Mysore Wars, and China&#x27;s Transition from Ming to Qing followed by the Ten Great Campaigns.
* All of the Great Powers of Europe and the Islamic gunpowder empires were actively fighting numerous wars throughout this period, grouped in rough geographical and chronological terms as:
** The European wars of religion between the 1520s and the 1640s (including the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Eighty Years&#x27; War and the Wars of the Three Kingdoms) and, the Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659), the Northern Wars, Polish–Swedish wars and Russo-Swedish Wars.
** The Russo-Turkish Wars, Ottoman–Habsburg wars, and other Ottoman wars in Europe.
** Throughout the 18th century the &quot;Second Hundred Years&#x27; War&quot;, an umbrella term which includes the Nine Years&#x27; War, Seven Years&#x27; War, War of the Spanish Succession, War of the Austrian Succession, American War of Independence (American Revolutionary War), French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars of the late 18th to early 19th centuries which mark the end of this era.

==Europe==

In Europe, Medieval castles were replaced by the &quot;Italian style&quot; fortresses, known for low, thick, sloping walls and star-shaped designs with bastions. However, by the mid-18th century, polygonal forts emerged to counter the power of explosive shells.

===Fortifications===

The period from 1501 to 1800 saw a rapid advance in techniques of fortification in Europe. Whereas medieval castles had relied on high walls to keep out attackers, early modern fortifications had to withstand artillery bombardments. To do this, engineers developed a style of fortress known as the &quot;Italian style&quot; or &quot;trace Italienne&quot;. These had low, thick, sloping walls, that would either absorb or deflect cannon fire.

In addition, they were shaped like stars, with bastions protruding at sharp angles. This was to ensure that every bastion could be supported with fire from an adjacent bastion, leaving no dead ground for an attacker to take cover in. These new fortifications quickly negated the advantages cannon had offered to besiegers.

In response to the vulnerabilities of star forts, military engineers evolved a much simpler but more robust style of fortification. A polygonal fort is a fortification in the style that evolved around the middle of the 18th century, in response to the development of explosive shells. The complex and sophisticated designs of star forts that preceded them were highly effective against cannon assault, but proved much less effective against the more accurate fire of rifled guns and the destructive power of explosive shells. The polygonal style of fortification is also described as a &quot;flankless fort&quot;. Many such forts were built in the United Kingdom and British Empire during the government of Lord Palmerston, and so they are also often referred to as Palmerston forts. Fort Tas-Silġ is an example of a British polygonal fort.

===Firearms===
The power of aristocracies &quot;vis à vis&quot; states diminished throughout Western Europe during this period. Aristocrats&#x27; 200- to 400-year-old ancestral castles no longer provided useful defences against artillery. The nobility&#x27;s importance in warfare also eroded as medieval heavy cavalry lost its central role in battle. The heavy cavalry - made up of armoured knights - had begun to fade in importance in the Late Middle Ages. The English longbow and the Swiss pike had both proven their ability to devastate larger armed forces of mounted knights. However, the proper use of the longbow required the user to be extremely strong, making it impossible to amass very large forces of archers.

The proper use of the pike required complex operations in formation and a great deal of fortitude and cohesion by the pikemen, again making amassing large forces difficult. Starting in the early 14th century, armourers added plate-armour pieces to the traditional protective linked mail armour of knights and men-at-arms to guard against the arrows of the longbow and crossbow. By 1415, some infantrymen began deploying the first &quot;hand cannons&quot;, and the earliest small-bore arquebuses, with burning &quot;match locks&quot;, appeared on the battlefield in the later 15th century.

====Decline of plate armour====

In virtually all major European battles during a period of 250 years (1400 to 1650), many soldiers wore extensive plate armour; this includes infantrymen (usually pikemen) and almost all mounted troops. Plate armour was expected to deflect edged weapons and to stop an arquebus or pistol ball fired from a distance, and it usually did. The use of plate armour as a remedy to firearms tended to work as long as the velocity and weight of the ball remained quite low, but over time the increasing power and effectiveness of firearms overtook the development of defenses to counteract them, such that flintlock muskets (entering use after 1650) could kill an armoured man at a distance of even 100 yards (though with limited accuracy), and the armour necessary to protect against this threat would have been too heavy and unwieldy to be practical.

The flintlock musket, carried by most infantrymen other than pikemen after 1650, fired a heavier charge and ball than the matchlock arquebus. A recruit could be trained to use a musket in a matter of weeks. Operating a musket did not require the great physical strength of a pikeman or a longbowman or the fairly rare skills of a horseman. Unlike their arquebus predecessors, flintlock muskets could neutralize even the most heavily armoured cavalry forces.

Since a firearm requires little training to operate, a peasant with a gun could now undermine the order and respect maintained by mounted cavalry in Europe and their Eastern equivalents. Although well-smithed plate-armour could still prevent the penetration of gunpowder-weapons, by 1690 it had become no match for massed firearms in a frontal attack and its use ended, even among the cavalry. By the end of the 17th century, soldiers in the infantry and most cavalry units alike preferred the higher mobility of being completely unarmoured to the slight protection, but greatly lessened mobility, offered by donning the heavy plate armour of the period.

====Transition to flintlock muskets====
The arquebus, in use from 1410, was one of the first handheld firearms that were relatively light (it still required a stand to balance on) and a single person could operate one. One of these weapons was first recorded as being used in the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, although this was still very much a medieval battle. The term &quot;musket&quot; originally applied to a heavier form of the arquebus, which fired a shot that could pierce plate armour, though only at close range. In the 16th century it still had to be mounted on a support stick to keep it steady. The caliver was the lighter form of the arquebus. By 1600, armies phased out these firearms in favour of a new lighter matchlock musket. Throughout the 16th century and up until 1690, muskets used the matchlock design.

However, the matchlock design was superseded in the 1690s by the flintlock musket, which was less prone to misfires and had a faster reloading rate. By this time, only light-cavalry scouting units, &quot;the eyes of the army&quot;, continued to wear front and back armour plates to protect themselves from distant or undisciplined musket-equipped troops.

While soldiers armed with firearms could inflict great damage on cavalry at a moderate distance, at close quarters the cavalry could slaughter the musket-armed infantry if they could break their formation and close to engage in melee combat. For many years infantry formations included a mix of troops armed with both firearms to provide striking power and pikes to allow for the defence of the arquebusiers or musketeers from a cavalry charge. The invention of the bayonet allowed the combining of these two weapons into one in the 1690s, which transformed the infantry into the most important branch of the early modern military—one that uniformly used flintlock muskets tipped with bayonets.

===Nature of war===
This period saw the size and scale of warfare greatly increase. The number of combatants involved escalated steadily from the mid 16th century and dramatically expanded after the 1660s. For example, Henry II of France, even in the dawn of religious unrest and inevitable violence, could amass an impressive 20,000 men in total for his 1550 decade of war against Habsburg Spain, but Louis XIV, Sun King with the highest population in the Kingdom of France and by extension Western Europe could deploy up to 500,000 men into the field by 1700 in the War of the Spanish Succession with more at stake. Moreover, wars and subsequent battles became increasingly deadly and pyrrhic in this period. The Battle of Fontenoy with advanced presence of Louis XV saw over 100,000 men deployed on both sides ending 20,000 lives, almost half of which were French, and despite a French victory, France herself did not keep Dutch territory gained as peace was desired for the bankrupt kingdom, a layman translation meaning almost 10,000 deaths were rendered obsolete by said king who witnessed the horrors from afar just 3 years later with very few battles left in the Austrian conflict. Cities that took months to siege could fall in mere days. European monarchs with bitter rivalries would invest many resources into intense warfare which often resulted in mass death and destruction of innocent populations, such as the Sack of Rome where the Supreme Pontiff&#x27;s life was endangered, a symbolic attack against God and Christendom. The Italian Wars alone would threaten Europe&#x27;s very existence. This may in part be attributed to improvements in weapons technology and in the techniques of using it (for example infantry volley fire).

However, the main reason was that armies were now much bigger, but logistical support for them was inadequate. This meant that armies tended to devastate civilian areas in an effort to feed themselves, causing famines and population displacement. This was exacerbated by the increasing length of conflicts, such as the Thirty Years&#x27; War and Eighty Years&#x27; War, when this period saw the size and scale of warfare greatly increase. The number of combatants involved escalated steadily from the mid 16th century and they fought over areas subjected to repeated devastation. For this reason, the wars of this era were among the most lethal before the modern period.

For example, the Thirty Years&#x27; War and the contemporary Wars of the Three Kingdoms, were the bloodiest conflicts in the history of Germany and Britain respectively before World War I. Another factor adding to bloodshed in war was the lack of a clear set of rules concerning the treatment of prisoners and non-combatants. While prisoners were usually ransomed for money or other prisoners, they were sometimes slaughtered out of hand - as at the Battle of Dungans Hill in 1647.

One of the reasons for warfare&#x27;s increased impact was its indecisiveness. Armies were slow moving in an era before good roads and canals. Battles were relatively rare as armies could manoeuvre for months, with no direct conflict. In addition, battles were often made irrelevant by the proliferation of advanced, bastioned fortifications. To control an area, armies had to take fortified towns, regardless of whether they defeated their enemies&#x27; field armies. As a result, by far the most common battles of the era were sieges, hugely time-consuming and expensive affairs. Storming a fortified city could result in massive casualties and cities which did not surrender before an assault were usually brutally sacked -for example Magdeburg in 1631 or Drogheda in 1649. In addition, both garrisons and besiegers often suffered heavily from disease.

The indecisive nature of conflict meant wars were long and endemic. Conflicts stretched on for decades and many states spent more years at war than they did at peace. The Spanish attempt to reconquer the Netherlands after the Dutch Revolt became bogged down in endless siege warfare. The expense caused the Spanish monarchy to declare bankruptcy several times, beginning in 1577.

The changes in warfare eventually made the mercenary forces of the Renaissance and Middle Ages obsolete. However this was a gradual change. As late as the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), most troops were mercenaries. However, after this conflict, most states invested in better disciplined and more ideologically inspired troops. For a time mercenaries became important as trainers and administrators, but soon these tasks were also taken by the state. The massive size of these armies required a large supporting force of administrators. The newly centralized states were forced to set up vast organized bureaucracies to manage these armies, which some historians argue is the basis of the modern bureaucratic state.

The combination of increased taxes and increased centralisation of government functions caused a series of revolts across Europe such as the English Civil War and the Fronde in France. In many countries, the resolution of this conflict was the rise of monarchical absolutism. Only in England and the Netherlands did representative government evolve as an alternative. From the late 17th century, states started financing wars through long term low interest loans from national banking institutions like the Bank of England. The first state to take full advantage of this process was the Dutch Republic.

This transformation in the armies of Europe had great social impact. J. F. C. Fuller famously stated that &quot;the musket made the infantryman and the infantryman made the democrat&quot;. This argument states that the defence of the state now rested on the common man, not on the aristocrats. Revolts by the underclass, that had routinely been defeated in the Middle Ages, could now conceivably threaten the power of the state. However, aristocrats continued to monopolise the officer corps of almost all early modern armies, including their high command.

Moreover, popular revolts almost always failed unless they had the support and patronage of the noble or gentry classes. The new armies, because of their vast expense, were also dependent on taxation and the commercial classes who also began to demand a greater role in society. The great commercial powers of the Dutch and English matched much larger states in military might.
As any man could be quickly trained in the use of a musket, it became far easier to form massive armies. The inaccuracy of the weapons necessitated large groups of massed soldiers. This led to a rapid swelling of the size of armies.

For the first time huge masses of the population could enter combat, rather than just the highly skilled professionals. It has been argued that the drawing of men from across the nation into an organized corps helped breed national unity and patriotism, and during this period the modern notion of the nation state was born. However, this would only become apparent after the French Revolutionary Wars. At this time, the levée en masse and conscription would become the defining paradigm of modern warfare.

Before then, however, most national armies were in fact composed of many nationalities. For example, although the Swedish Army under Gustavus Adolphus was originally recruited by a kind of national conscription, the losses of the Thirty Years&#x27; War meant that by 1648 over 80% of its troops were foreign mercenaries. In Spain, armies were recruited from all the Spanish European territories including Spain, Italy, Wallonia and Germany. The French recruited soldiers from Germany, Switzerland and elsewhere as well as from France. Britain recruited Hessian troops until the late 18th century. Irish Catholics made careers for themselves in the armies of many European states (See the Flight of the Wild Geese).

===Infantry===

Column - This formation was typically used while marching, although with sufficient will and mass it was effective at breaking through line formations, albeit with heavy casualties.

Line - A simple two- or three-rank deep line formation allowed most muskets to be brought to bear and was the most commonly used battle formation. Often the first rank would kneel after firing to allow the second rank to fire.

Skirmishers - Skirmishers were not a common infantry unit until late in the 18th century. Light infantry would advance and be the first to fire to draw the enemy to attack, while also probing the flanks. In later eras, sharpshooters would not only target common soldiers, but also officers so that the men were without leadership.

Square - This formation was used against cavalry. Bayonets would be fixed, the first line would kneel with their muskets angled upward (much like a pike.) The second and third lines would fire at the cavalry when it came close. This formation was very ineffective when faced with combined cavalry and infantry, or artillery fire in the case of plain squares.

===Cavalry===

The rise of gunpowder reduced the importance of the once dominant heavy cavalry, but it remained effective in a new role into the 19th century. The cavalry, along with the infantry, became more professional in this period but it retained its greater social and military prestige than the infantry. Light cavalry was introduced for skirmishing and scouting because of its advantage in speed and mobility. The new types of cavalry units introduced in this period were the dragoons or mounted infantry.

Dragoons were intended to travel on horseback but fight on foot and were armed with carbines and pistols. Even orthodox cavalry carried firearms, especially the pistol, which they used in a tactic known as the caracole. Cavalry charges using swords on undisciplined infantry could still be quite decisive, but a frontal charge against well-ordered musketeers and pikemen was all but futile. Cavalry units, from the 16th century on, were more likely to charge other cavalry on the flanks of an infantry formation and try to work their way behind the enemy infantry. When they achieved this and pursued a fleeing enemy, heavy cavalry could still destroy an enemy army. Only specialised cavalry units like winged hussars armed with long lances could break pikemen lines, but this was rather an exception. After wars with Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, when he fought often against superior mounted troops, King Gustavus II Adolphus started using successfully cavalry melee charge more often instead of caracole like during Battle of Breitenfeld. The cavalry charge remained an important part of battle tactics for the rest of 17th century and until the modern area, and its shock value could be decisive when implemented properly like during Battle of Vienna (1683).

However, the power formerly wielded by a heavy cavalry-focused army was at an end. For the first time in millennia, the settled people of the agricultural regions could defeat the horse peoples of the steppe in open combat. The power of the Mongols was broken in Russia and, no longer threatened from the east, Russia began to assert itself as a major force in European affairs. Never again would nomads from the east threaten to overrun Europe or the Middle East. In the Siege of Kazan (1552), Russia had employed artillery, sappers, cavalry and infantry armed with arquebus (Streltsy), while the Khanate of Kazan had only employed cavalry. The use of sappers proved decisive.

The one exception to this was the Ottoman Empire, which had been founded by Turkish horsemen. The Ottomans were some of the first to embrace gunpowder artillery and firearms and integrated them into their already formidable fighting abilities. As European infantry became better armed and disciplined, by about 1700, the Ottoman forces began to be regularly defeated by the troops of the Austria and Russia.

===Naval warfare===

The Age of Sail (usually dated as 1571–1862) was a period roughly corresponding to the early modern period in which international trade and naval warfare were dominated by sailing ships and gunpowder warfare, lasting from the mid-16th to the mid-19th centuries. The spread of European power around the world was closely tied to naval developments in this period. The caravel for the first time made unruly seas like the Atlantic Ocean open to exploration, trade, and military conquest. While in all previous eras, European navies had been largely confined to operations in coastal waters, and were generally used only in a support role for land-based forces, this changed with the introduction of the new vessels like the caravel, carrack, and galleon, and the increasing importance of international waterborne trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The new caravels were large enough and powerful enough to be armed with cannons with which they could bombard both shoreline defenses and other vessels.

==Africa==

===Somalia===

The Ethiopian–Adal War was a military conflict between the Ethiopian Empire and the Adal Sultanate from 1529 until 1543. The Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi (nicknamed Gurey in Somali and Gragn in Amharic (ግራኝ Graññ), both meaning &quot;the left-handed&quot;) came close to extinguishing the ancient realm of Ethiopia, and converting all of its subjects to Islam; the intervention of the European Cristóvão da Gama, son of the famous navigator Vasco da Gama, helped to prevent this outcome. Many historians trace the origins of hostility between Somalia and Ethiopia to this war. Some historians also argue that this conflict proved, through their use on both sides, the value of firearms such as the matchlock musket, cannons, and the arquebus over traditional weapons. Imam Ahmed was the first African commander to use cannon warfare on the continent during the Adal&#x27;s conquest of the Ethiopian Empire under Dawit II.

==Asia==
===China===
Gunpowder was invented in China in the Tang dynasty. It started being broadly used in warfare in the Song dynasty. From the 9th through 12th century, there were widespread advances in gunpowder technology. While the Europeans were pressed on technological advancements and military developments with gunpowder, the Chinese fell back in regards to further developing military technology. This was due to the fact that the Chinese were not as heavily engaged in wars or conquests as the Europeans. Notably, when the Chinese were at war with the Portuguese, for example, they swiftly adapted to military technology, and adopted Western style guns.

The Chinese pioneered the use of gunpowder weapons, crossbows, advanced forms of arms and armor, naval and nomadic cavalry. Thus, the Chinese even adopted Western military technology. Interestingly, the Chinese had many descriptions of how they utilized their technology. For Ming China, they had experiences on the battlefield: against Chinese rebels, Shan elephants, and Mongol horsemen. Nonetheless, under the Ming dynasty, intensively practiced tactical strategies based on their firearm use. Qi Jiguang and his troops used innovative battle techniques such as counter marching, dividing the troops, as a flexible way of adapting to the battlefield. These tactics were proved effective during the Sino-Dutch War beginning in 1661. While the Chinese were undermined as the inferior empire due to lack of weaponry, their strict adherence discipline and tactical strategy led to them defeating the Dutch. This draws a parallel to the Sino-Portuguese conflict. During the first war, in 1521, the Portuguese firepower was far more effective than the Chinese. As they witnessed the power of Portuguese artillery, the Chinese better prepared for the war in 1522. They modified, adapted, innovated and improved. The Chinese were a display of rapid militarization, as they instilled Western style learnings to their knowledge of artillery and war tactical strategy.

The fire arrows (rocket arrows) were first reported to have been used by the Southern Wu in 904 during the siege of Yuzhang.

===Safavid Empire===

Soon after the Ottoman Empire, two other Muslim gunpowder empires appeared: the Safavid Empire in Iran and the Mughal Empire in India. They both began in the early 16th century but later collapsed in the 18th century.

The refusal of their Qizilbash forces to use firearms contributed to the Safavid rout at Chaldiran in 1514.

After this, the Persians actively sought to acquire the skills to make and use firearms. In a report given to the Council of Ten on 24 September 1572, the Venetian envoy Vincenzo di Alessandri noted how firearms had become integrated into the Persian army:

They used for arms, swords, lances, arquebuses, which all the soldiers carry and use; their arms are also superior and better tempered than those of any other nation. The barrels of the arquebuses are generally six spans long, and carry a ball little less than three ounces in weight. They use them with such facility that it does not hinder them drawing their bows nor handling their swords, keeping the latter hung at their saddle bows till occasion requires them. The arquebus is then put away behind the back so that one weapon does not impede the use of the other.

===Japan===

The Japanese were introduced to early firearms by Portuguese traders arriving with European style arquebuses onto the island of Tanegashima, near the island of Kyushu in September 1543. The impact of this event would revolutionize Japanese strategy throughout the Sengoku-jidai, revolving around tactics that centered on usage of firearms.

While memoirs by Fernão Mendes Pinto attribute himself and Diogo Zeimoto as the traders to initially introduce firearms to Japan, studies of said memoirs call this claim highly embellished, and therefore the validity of this claim falls into question. Daimyō of the period, searching for any sort of new tactical edge over their regional rivals, were quick to acquire and have blacksmiths under their retinue, reverse-engineer and reproduce the early European firearms. Portuguese traders visiting Japan several years later found that the Japanese had successfully reproduced hundreds of arquebuses, and by 1546, a rough estimate of over 300,000 of the early firearms were in circulation throughout Japan. Early production of said firearms were limited to the general region of Kyushu, though gunsmiths would eventually migrate throughout Japan. Different schools started to emerge from this migration. with notable examples from Sakai, Yokkaichi, and Kunitomo being the most prevalent. Moreover, production of small arms ranged from the early Tanegashima arquebus, to later production teppo, which also subdivided into arquebuses of varying caliber and length, to &quot;hand cannons&quot; favored by those of the Shimazu clan.

Japanese military strategy upon receiving the new weapon, began to gradually shift towards infantry based tactics, rather than those that favored horseback cavalry. This is most famously portrayed at the Battle of Nagashino in 1575, where Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s 3,000 riflemen had handily dispatched the much larger Takeda clan cavalry force using the first recorded utilization of volley fire. However, certain studies have disputed the claim that Nobunaga was the first to utilize this tactic, though Japanese forces were utilizing it far earlier than other world contemporaries. Japanese battle planning soon centered around manipulating one&#x27;s enemies into allied fortified positions to rapidly dispatch enemy manpower, only engaging in hand-to-hand combat when necessary.

Similarly, Japanese daimyō were introduced to artillery in 1551, when a trader claiming to be the king of Rome presented elements of the Ōtomo clan with two examples of field artillery. As with their small arms counterparts, many warlords wished to quickly adopt the weapon in order to gain an advantage over their contemporaries, but difficulties in producing suitable reproductions led to limited early usage in comparison. As with personal firearms, Oda Nobunaga was early to adopt the new weapon, and later, after his death, one of his retainers Toyotomi Hideyoshi would use cannons to destructive effect to lay siege to Kanki Castle in 1582. Moreover, Nobunaga had attempted to incorporate cannons onto warships in 1578, but their inefficacy against rival naval daimyō forces under the Mori had led to the discontinuation of any further implementations to other naval forces.

These changes and adoptions into Sengoku era Japanese warfare made themselves present during the Japanese invasions of Korea of 1592–1598 after Toyotomi Hideyoshi had unified Japan. Early success in the first incursion during May 1592 into Korea was attributed to the varied small arms and tactics of the Japanese forces, allowing them to make and defend early footholds into the Korean peninsula. However, after the Koreans had allied themselves with Ming China, they gained access to better artillery with greater range and destructive power than their Japanese equivalents. Finally, the Korean navy under the command of Yi Sun-sin had utilized the superior, cannon-armed navy of the Korean-Ming alliance against the Japanese maritime supply lines, eventually leading to a shortage of supplies and Japanese losses on the mainland. Japan was driven off their last stronghold in Seoul in May 1594, and subsequent ventures 1597 would not come close to the success of the first, as the Korean-Ming alliance had developed countermeasures and equivalent small arms to Japanese equivalents.

The Japanese version of the fire arrow (rocket arrow) was known as the bo hiya. The Japanese pirates (wokou, also known as wako or kaizoku) in the 16th century were reported to have used the bo hiya which had the appearance of a large arrow. A burning element made from incendiary waterproof rope was wrapped around the shaft and when lit the bo hiya was launched from a mortar like weapon or a wide bore Tanegashima matchlock arquebus. During one sea battle it was said the bo hiya were &quot;falling like rain&quot;.

===Kingdom of Mysore===
The first iron rockets were developed by Tipu Sultan, a Muslim ruler of the South Indian Kingdom of Mysore. He successfully used these iron rockets against the larger forces of the British East India Company during the Anglo-Mysore Wars. The Mysore rockets of this period were much more advanced than what the British had seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile (up to 2 km range). After Tipu&#x27;s eventual defeat in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and the capture of the Mysore iron rockets, they were influential in British rocket development and were soon put into use in the Napoleonic Wars.

===Mughal Empire===

Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire on the Indian subcontinent, employed firearms, gun carts and movable artillery in battle. In particular, he used them at the first Battle of Panipat (1526) to defeat the much larger forces of Ibrahim Lodhi, the last ruler of the Delhi Sultanate. Other battles he fought using gunpowder weapons include the Battle of Khanwa in 1527 against Rana Sanga, and the Battle of Ghaghra in 1529.

His descendants also employed gunpowder weapons in their expansion of the Mughal Empire, such as Akbar the Great at the second Battle of Panipat (1556) against Adil Shah Suri and Hemu of the Sur dynasty. In 1582, Fathullah Shirazi, a Persian-Indian developed a seventeen-barrelled cannon, fired with a matchlock.

===Ottoman Empire===


The Ottoman Empire had been one of the first Middle Eastern states to effectively use gunpowder weapons and used them to great effect conquering much of the Middle East, North Africa, and the Balkans. In the 17th century the state began to stagnate as more modern technologies and strategies were not adopted. Specifically, the Ottoman Empire was slow to adopt innovations like boring cannon (rather than casting them in a mold), making the conversion from matchlock firearms to flintlocks, and the lightening of field guns and carriages.

In part this was because the military elite had become a powerful force in the empire and change threatened their positions. David Nicolle theorizes that one contributing factor to the Ottoman reluctance to adopt the flintlock musket, despite its superiority over the matchlock ignition system, was the dusty climate of much of the Middle East which could cause problems with reliability.

Overall, the Ottoman Empire between the 15th and 18th centuries has been assessed as a military producer which copies existing technologies, but does not capture the underlying process of innovation or adaption. Other research, though, complicates that view. A Chinese military manual published in 1644 compared Ottoman and European firearms in the following manner:

Firearms have been in use since the beginning of the dynasty, and field armies in battle formation have found them convenient and useful to carry along... Since muskets have been transmitted to China, these weapons have lost their effectiveness... In battle formation, aside from various cannon such as the &quot;three generals&quot;, the breech-loading swivel gun, and the &quot;hundred-league thunder&quot;, nothing has more range or power than the Turkish musket. The next best is the European one.

The fact that Ottoman firearms were considered by 17th century Chinese writers to be superior to European firearms demonstrates that the Ottoman Empire was at least a second tier producer of muskets during this period. However, some claim that the &#x27;European&#x27; firearms the Chinese researcher tested were actually Japanese arquebuses based on fifty-year-old Portuguese models. The design of the Ottoman matchlock is substantially different from that of the European variety and it in turn influenced the matchlocks produced in both Safavid Persia and Mughal India.

====15th century====
The Ottoman Empire by the middle of the fifteenth century had developed strategic infantry groups along with the ascension of weaponry. Early modern warfare has many important factors alongside weapons and artillery, and strategy is one of them. Developing a strong core for the sultan was key to understanding the way the Ottoman Empire could expand and take over vast territories to maintain them under their rule. One of the most important creations for their early modern warfare was a group called the Janissaries. They were considered to be an elite group of infantryman that were highly skilled and sociable. With their placement in use for the sultan, they were an unmatched military power that no European power could compete with during the fifteenth century.

The Ottoman Empire was brought up in a different way from most militaristic powers, and that was from the bottom up. They were developed in peaceful upbringings. When they conquered Constantinople in 1453, they had created a transcontinental government that would see them to continue to expand militarily and politically. They used the Janissary units to advance their stronghold on the will of the people they conquered. One of their techniques was to capture boys from the territories they had defeated and forced them to become Muslim in order to control their easily molded minds. It was a similar tactic to many growing empires, because it is understood that children are easily manipulated, and in order to maintain new territories guarded by the Janissary, they needed to have an easier population to mold. The Janissaries also had other roles outside of military conflict. They were one of the main protectors of the sultan in order to prevent coups from happening, or paramilitary units from gaining control of the empire. The problem with this is that the Ottoman Empire made the Janissaries too powerful and because of their socialization, career advancement options, and recruitment procedures, the men in the units were very cohesive and respected each other more than the sultan. This would prove to be an issue later on, but during the fifteenth century it was not an issue yet because their numbers were still growing and would continue to grow in order to boost their elite power.

A man by the name of Konstantin Mihailović was captured by the Turks in 1455 and would eventually write a memoir about his time with the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Janissary units. His account would be considered flawed because of the translations from Serbian to Czech and Polish. There is no original text from his memoir and only translations are left to work from, and those have far fetched ideas of what the Janissaries were doing during the time. He was recaptured in 1463 by Hungarian troops and eventually wrote the memoir after he became a Christian again. His memoir is an important piece of history, but scholars and historians have widely debated the authentic nature of his stories and doubt the consistency of his tales.

The Ottoman Empire was one of the first states to put gunpowder weapons into widespread use. The famous Janissary corps of the Ottoman army began using matchlock muskets as early as the 1440s. The army of Mehmed the Conqueror, which conquered Constantinople in 1453, included both artillery and foot soldiers armed with gunpowder weapons. The Ottomans brought to the siege sixty-nine guns in fifteen separate batteries and trained them at the walls of the city. The barrage of Ottoman cannon fire lasted forty days, and they are estimated to have fired 19,320 times.

====16th century====
The 16th century saw the first widespread use of the matchlock musket as a decisive weapon on the battlefield with the Turks becoming leaders in this regard. The first of these campaigns was the campaign against the Persians in 1514 under Yavuz Sultan Selim, or Selim the Grim. Armed with gunpowder weapons, his army defeated the Persians at the Battle of Chaldiran. After his victory over the Safavids, Selim turned his attention towards the Mamluk dynasty in Egypt. The decisive battle of his campaign against the Mamluks, and the battle which highlighted the importance of the musket in the Ottoman military, was the Battle of Raydaniyah, fought in 1517. There, Selim outflanked the entrenched Mamluk artillery, and attacked the Mamluk forces with his Janissaries. The Janissaries, armed with firearms, destroyed the Mamluk army, armed mostly with traditional swords and javelins.

Reference was made by João de Barros to a sea battle outside Jiddah, in 1517, between Portuguese and Ottoman vessels. The Muslim force under Salman Reis had &quot;three or four basilisks firing balls of thirty palms in circumference&quot;. This was estimated to be a cannon of about 90 inch bore &quot;firing cut stone balls of approximately 1,000 pounds (453 kg)&quot;.

After the death of Selim, he was succeeded by his son Suleiman the Magnificent. During his reign, gunpowder weapons continued to be used effectively. One important example is the Battle of Mohács in 1526. During this battle, Ottoman artillery, and Janissaries armed with muskets, were able to cut down charging Hungarian cavalry.

====17th century====
Although the cannon and musket were employed by the Ottomans long beforehand, by the 17th century they witnessed how ineffective the traditional cavalry charges were in the face of concentrated musket-fire volleys. In a report given by an Ottoman general in 1602, he confessed that the army was in a distressed position due to the emphasis in European forces for musket-wielding infantry, while the Ottomans relied heavily on cavalry. Thereafter it was suggested that the Janissaries, who were already trained and equipped with muskets, become more heavily involved in the imperial army while led by their &quot;agha&quot;.

By the middle of the 17th century, the continued reliance of the Ottomans on over-heavy ordnance had been made out by European officers as a liability. Raimondo Montecuccoli, the Habsburg commander who defeated the Ottomans at Battle of Saint Gotthard commented on Ottoman cannon:

This enormous artillery produces great damage when it hits, but it is awkward to move and it requires too much time to reload and site. Furthermore, it consumes a great amount of powder, besides cracking and breaking the wheels and the carriages and even the ramparts on which it is placed ... our artillery is more handy and more efficient and here resides our advantage over the cannon of the Turks.&quot;

===Vietnam===
Western matchlock arquebuses were imported into Vietnam during the early 16th century. The raging and lengthy wars between Le and Mac dynasties, and later Trinh and Nguyen clans invoked an arm race between the opposing factions. Gunnery and marksmanship rapidly spread across the country and soon Vietnamese musketeers became famous within Asia as masters of firearms.

<text>COMIT was the first string processing language (compare SNOBOL, TRAC, and Perl), developed on the IBM 700/7000 series computers by Victor Yngve, University of Chicago, and collaborators at MIT from 1957 to 1965. Yngve created the language for supporting computerized research in the field of linguistics, and more specifically, the area of machine translation for natural language processing. The creation of COMIT led to the creation of SNOBOL, which stand out apart from other programming languages of the era (during the 50s and 60s) for having patterns as first class data type.

Bob Fabry, University of Chicago, was responsible for COMIT II on Compatible Time Sharing System.

<text>The Hobart Bridge was a floating arch bridge that crossed the Derwent River, connecting the eastern and western shores of the city of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.

==History==
Plans for a bridge to link the Derwent River&#x27;s two shores near Hobart date back to 1832. It was not until 1943 that the first bridge was completed, the Hobart floating bridge and lift span. The bridge was opened to toll traffic on 22 December 1943 and the collection of tolls continued until midnight on 31 December 1948. It was built by the Hobart Bridge Co, being sold to the Government of Tasmania in 1946.

Soon after its opening a violent storm blew in and damaged a section of the bridge, and to prevent the same happening again, the bridge was anchored to the riverbed in the middle and strengthening cables were added to stiffen the structure. After these modifications were completed the lifespan of the bridge was estimated as 21 years.

The bridge provided much better connection between the eastern and western shores, and consequently development on the eastern shore sped up and became so dense by the mid-1950s that the floating bridge could no longer handle the amount of traffic that was crossing it. Congestion became a severe problem, and in the late 1950s the decision was taken to construct a completely new bridge, the Tasman Bridge, which opened in August 1964.

The floating bridge was closed to traffic on 17 August 1964, and the following day the locking pin was removed and the two concrete sections towed away. For several years they were moored, but one of them sank in November 1970, and the council undertook to dispose of them. The two halves were cut up and sunk at various locations.

The lift span was left in situ for some years but in the end it too was demolished. Today the only reminders of the bridge are the eastern foot of the lifting section which is still in place, and the preserved locking pin. One of the pontoons was sunk at Alonnah, and remains in use as a public jetty. Another piece is sunk in Ralphs Bay, in about of water.

==Construction==
The Hobart Bridge was of unique design and construction, and the first of its type anywhere in the world. It was a floating bridge with a lift span, constructed of hollow concrete pontoons, 24 in all, connected together forming a crescent shape curved upstream, and anchored in the middle.

The bridge was constructed in 12-pontoon sections which were then towed out into the river and connected to the banks and to each other in the middle. The total volume of concrete used in making these pontoons was . The two halves of the bridge were made of ten pontoons, one section, and one section, joined in the middle by a vertical locking pin, which was saved when the bridge was demolished and is now on display outside the Royal Engineers Building in Hobart.

The total length of the roadway was . The total width of the bridge was . It had a two-lane roadway and a footpath on one side. At the western end a large lifting section was provided to allow ships to pass. It provided a vertical clearance of at low tide, and the opening section was wide. Four electric motors were used to open the bridge, which took two minutes. The total weight of steel used in the construction of the bridge was .

== Engineering heritage award ==
The bridge received an Engineering Heritage National Marker from Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.

<doc id="1012901" wikidata="Q8005082" url="?curid=1012901" title="William Barnard Rhodes">
<text>William Barnard Rhodes (1807? – 11 February 1878), casually referred to as Barney Rhodes, was a New Zealand landowner, pastoralist, businessman and politician. He was probably born in Lincolnshire, England, but took up a career at sea at an early age. In 1839 he settled in Wellington, New Zealand and remained there for the rest of his life. He brought three of his younger brothers to New Zealand and they co-ordinated their efforts.

A tough man having &quot;shrewd judgement, unflagging energy and sheer determination&quot; his frugal ways and his personal engagement in physical labour deferred social acceptance by the new colony&#x27;s social élite. Nevertheless, he used these talents to make himself a rich man and with his three brothers all four became major landowners and pastoralists in the North and in the South Island.

When he died in Wellington he was described as one of the richest people in the country.

==Early life==
Barnard Rhodes was the eldest of eleven surviving children of William Rhodes, a wealthy tenant farmer born in Yorkshire, and his wife, Theodosia Maria Heaton. He was baptised on 9 May 1807 at Epworth, Lincolnshire, England. At the time of his death it was suggested he was rather older than his announced 70 years.

He was a second officer on a merchant vessel by 1826 and by 1831 he had his own command. After visiting South America, Africa, and India, Rhodes ended up in New South Wales where he was able to make substantial pastoral investments. Rhodes seems to have first visited New Zealand on a whaling expedition commanding the barque &quot;Australian&quot; for Sydney NSW business, Cooper and Holt later Holt and Roberts. During that time he arranged A B Smith and Co of Sydney to be his (stock and station) agents to look after his entire property in the colony of New South Wales.

In September 1836, as captain of the barque &quot;Australian,&quot; he climbed the Port Hills from Lyttelton Harbour and looking over the area now occupied by the city of Christchurch he observed a large grassy plain with two small areas of forest. He reported that &quot;All the land that I saw was swamp and mostly covered with water&quot;.

==Major landowner==
In late 1839, in partnership with the mercantile firm of Daniel Cooper and James Holt, he went back to New Zealand to acquire land for cattle runs and set up trading stations. He acquired deeds to nearly two million acres. For the trading stations he placed agents and stock-in-trade at carefully chosen landings. For his own base he chose Wellington and in late 1840 built his premises in Te Aro and completed his own wharf, Wellington&#x27;s first, the following year. Rhodes lived by the eastern corner of the junction of Cuba Street and Manners Street. He bought out Cooper and Holt&#x27;s share in 1850.

Though his claims to the near two million acres were largely disallowed his 30,000 acres Heaton Park estate at Bulls had been a component. It is thought his acquisition of another 80,000 acres in the North Island could be an underestimate and to that should be added another 100,000 acres of grazing rights. Later, along with his younger brothers, their South Island estates stretched from Banks Peninsula to Otago. With similar holdings in the Hawkes Bay – East Coast regions they together controlled, by the 1850s, in excess of 300,000 acres.

==W B Rhodes and Co==

In addition to supplying imported livestock and goods of all kinds including liquor to settlers he held the contract to supply troops, the &quot;Hickety Pips&quot;. He shipped out his own wool and rapidly obtained the agencies for the major shipping companies. By the 1850s he was not only an insurance agent but a substantial financier. He helped found The New Zealand Shipping Company, New Zealand Insurance and The Bank of New Zealand.

==Highland Park==
Rhodes bought his Wellington sheep run from the original holders in 1849 and in 1865 built the driveway now known as Wadestown Road for access to his new house there, &quot;The Grange&quot;. After his widow&#x27;s death it became the residence of Sir Harold Beauchamp, father of Katherine Mansfield and, in stages, the former sheep run was subdivided into sites for houses.

==Politics==


As a result of his prominence in the national community he decided to enter politics. He served on the Wellington Provincial Council, where he was a strong supporter of Isaac Featherston.

He was then elected to the 1st New Zealand Parliament as the representative for the Wellington Country seat, covering Miramar, Mākara, Porirua, the Kāpiti Coast and Horowhenua, from 1853 to 1855. From 1858 he represented the City of Wellington electorate in the 2nd Parliament and the 3rd Parliament, but failed to win re-election in 1866. He was later appointed to the Legislative Council.

==Family==
===Wives and his daughter===

W B Rhodes&#x27; first marriage was in May 1852 to Sarah King, daughter of solicitor John King. She died in August 1862 aged 28. There were no surviving children. In October 1869 after completing The Grange, a new homestead for his Highland Park property, he married Sarah Ann Moorhouse (c. 1837–1914), a sister of William Sefton Moorhouse and Lucy Ellen Sykes Moorhouse who married John Studholme. Though he had no children by either wife, about 1850 he and a Māori woman called Mary had a daughter, Mary Ann. William and Sarah loved his daughter, and Sarah adopted her. She was provided for in her father&#x27;s will. In spite of this Mary Ann challenged the will. She lost her case in the New Zealand Supreme Court but she was awarded £750,000 on appeal to the Privy Council.

William Barnard Rhodes is buried at Bolton Street Memorial Park, and his grave is part of the memorial trail.

Sarah Ann Rhodes died at the beginning of January 1914 aged 77. She made many charitable bequests including trusts for the university education of young women. One-ninth of her estate went to Victoria College for the education of women and another one-ninth went to the Wellington Boys&#x27; Institute.

===Descendants===
W B Rhodes&#x27; daughter, Mary Ann Rhodes, married her stepmother&#x27;s younger brother Edward Moorhouse in Wellington in 1883. They moved to England and raised four children, including William Barnard Moorhouse and Mary Rhodes Moorhouse.

Shortly before William Barnard Moorhouse married in 1912, as required by the will of his grandfather, he changed his name to William Barnard Rhodes-Moorhouse. Rhodes-Moorhouse was killed in action in April 1915, he was the first airman awarded the Victoria Cross. His only child was killed in action with the RAF over Tonbridge Kent in September 1940.

Mary Rhodes Moorhouse-Pekkala was married to the Finnish Socialist politician Eino Pekkala. She emigrated to Finland in 1928.

===The Rhodes brothers===
Rhodes was the eldest of 14 children. Three brothers followed him to New Zealand; Robert Heaton (1815–1884) of Christchurch, George (1816–1864) of Timaru and Joseph (1826–1905) of Clive, Hawkes Bay.

<text>Rodney Morgan Howard-Browne (born June 12, 1961) is a South African-born American evangelist and a conspiracy theorist. He has resided in Tampa, Florida since the mid-1990s and is pastor of The River Church in Tampa Bay. The River is a Pentecostal church with revival meetings, led by Howard-Browne, known for those in the audience breaking into &quot;holy laughter&quot; and experiencing other pentecostal and charismatic phenomena. Howard-Browne is the head of Revival Ministries International, a ministry he and his wife founded in 1997.

==Biography==
Howard-Browne and his three brothers (Mervyn, Bazil, and Gil) were raised in a Pentecostal family in the cities of Port Elizabeth and East London, South Africa. His father, Frank Mervyn Derric Howard-Browne (1924–2005), was a cleric. Howard-Browne became a Christian at age five. In 1981, he met and married his wife Adonica (née Weyers). In the 1980s, he volunteered to work for Youth for Christ before doing a teaching stint with Rhema Bible School in Johannesburg.

In December 1988, the family emigrated from South Africa to the United States, Howard-Browne opened his first U.S. church in Clifton Park, New York, in April 1989. In 1991, he moved to Louisville, Kentucky where he began holding revival meetings. The Rodney Howard-Browne Evangelistic Association was incorporated in November 1993 and the family moved to the Tampa Bay, Florida area in 1994. Rodney&#x27;s eldest brother Gil went on to operate Times of Refreshing Ministries, an online evangelical ministry. Likewise, his youngest brother Bazil established an eponymous evangelical ministry on 1 January 1994 with the professed aim of people achieving financial freedom through the special anointing of God. Prior to this he had worked alongside his brother Rodney for a year.

In 1996, Howard-Browne founded a church he named &quot;The River&quot; at Tampa Bay Church in Tampa, Florida, serving as its pastor ever since. Howard-Browne and his wife also founded Revival Ministries International in 1997, as well as River Bible Institute and River School of Worship.

Howard-Browne&#x27;s services are characterized by laying on of hands with worshipers giggling in apparent spiritual drunkenness, speaking in tongues, breaking into uncontrollable holy laughter, shaking, dancing in the aisles, or falling to the ground. He refers to himself as &quot;God&#x27;s bartender&quot; and the &quot;holy ghost bartender&quot;.

Howard-Browne is credited with introducing holy laughter to Carpenter&#x27;s Home Church in Lakeland, Florida during a series of revival services with Karl Strader in 1993. The holy laughter revivals later spread to nearby churches in Melbourne, Titusville, Stuart and Vero Beach, Florida. Howard-Browne is credited with bringing holy laughter to the charismatic Toronto Airport Vineyard Church (soon after expelled by its parent Vineyard Church) at a 1994 revival in Toronto, Canada with evangelist Randy Clark, known as the &quot;Toronto Blessing,&quot; and then a year later, to Assemblies of God (AOG) Brownsville Church in Pensacola, Florida with evangelist Steve Hill. The event became known in Christian circles as the Brownsville Revival. Howard-Browne also ministered under pastor Mike Rose at the Juneau Christian Center (formerly known as the Bethel Assembly of God) in Juneau, Alaska, an AOG church that Sarah Palin later attended after becoming governor of Alaska.

Howard-Browne first came to national prominence in the US in 1999 when his Revival Ministries organization rented Madison Square Garden in New York City for six weeks. The event, called Good News New York, was described as &quot;an effort to achieve a Billy Graham-style faith uprising&quot;, but was &quot;derided in local media as a giant flop&quot;. It was estimated to cost up to $10 million but only 3,000 people were counted in attendance at the 19,000-seat arena. Investigative journalists in his home town of Tampa reported at the time that since arriving from South Africa almost penniless in December 1989, his sudden wealth included a boat, a Harley Davidson motorcycle, a home in one of Tampa&#x27;s exclusive gated communities and access to a private jet; however, they were unable to find evidence of financial wrongdoing.

Howard-Browne&#x27;s daughter Kelly died of cystic fibrosis on Christmas Day 2002, at the age of 18. He then vowed &quot;to win 100 million souls to Jesus and to put $1 billion into world missions&quot;.

In 2012, it was reported that Howard-Browne&#x27;s River Church had hosted political meetings for the Florida chapter of the Republican Party during the preceding two years, including a rally for then presidential candidate Newt Gingrich, at which Howard-Browne called for a national &quot;rising&quot; of Christian Americans &quot;that will not sit idly by and allow the killing of unborn babies and allow Islam to take over this country&quot;. At the same event, he described Mormonism as a &quot;cult&quot; that, in the 19th century, &quot;had death squads that would go around killing everybody that was not a Mormon&quot;. He later recanted, saying Mormons were &quot;honourable people&quot;.

Howard-Browne published &quot;The Killing of Uncle Sam: The Demise of the United States of America&quot;, which was scheduled to be released in May 2018, and announced that proceeds from sales of the book would go to the River School of Government, a degree granting program, operated by Howard-Browne and his wife under the auspices of Revival Ministries, that funds training for people seeking to run for political office.

Howard-Browne&#x27;s evangelical movement has been described by some as &quot;a combination of brimstone and fire about God&#x27;s power, sprinkled with hipster references and a conviction that church—like Disneyland—should be &#x27;the happiest place on earth&#x27;.&quot; The Christian Research Institute labelled his operation a &quot;cult&quot; and called him &quot;a good stage hypnotist&quot; who has made millions from vulnerable believers. &quot;Yet Howard-Browne is also widely credited with having one of the most racially and economically diverse congregations in Florida. It feeds hundreds of poor Tampa families weekly and at his televised Sunday services dishes out huge checks to members facing financial crises.&quot; According to &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot;, critics have described him as &quot;a manipulator leading followers into a cult; a circus ring leader making a good living.&quot; On the other hand B.J. Oropeza (Ph.D., Durham University) concludes in his book &quot;A Time to Laugh&quot; (reviewed by Lloyd K. Pietersen, University of Sheffield and also by &quot;The Pneuma Review. Journal of Ministry Resources and Theology for Pentecostal and Charismatic Ministries &amp; Leaders&quot; which stated that it is &quot;well-documented and well-researched book&quot;) that he is not &#x27;a mass-hypnotist, charlatan or a cultist&#x27;. Dr. Oropeza (Professor of Biblical and Religious Studies at Azusa Pacific University and Seminary, Azusa, CA) further states about Howard-Browne that &quot;Having read RHB&#x27;s writings on financial stewardship and prosperity, I have concluded that he does not believe in a prosperity that promotes greed, materialism, or using God as a means to get rich. He denounces ministers who fleece the church through clever gimmicks.&quot;

&quot;The New International Dictionary of Pentecostal Charismatic Movements&quot; compares Howard-Browne meetings to great revivals under Whitefield, Wesley, and Finney.

In the Special Centennial Edition of &quot;The Azusa Street Revival, The Holy Spirit in America, 100 Years&quot;, the revival meetings conducted by Howard-Browne are compared to the Azusa Street Revival.

==Statements and controversies==
===Diploma mill doctorate===
Howard-Browne claimed to have earned a &quot;doctorate of ministry degree&quot; in 1992 from &quot;The School of Bible Theology&quot;, a non-accredited Pentecostal correspondence school in San Jacinto, California that has been described as a &quot;diploma mill&quot;.

===Multi-level marketing: Monavie and Jeunesse===
Howard-Browne and his wife Adonica were top-ranking (&quot;Black Diamond executive level&quot;) distributors for Monavie, a multi-level marketing company that sold acai berry juice-based beverages until folding in 2014 subsequent to a $182 million loan default and allegations of pyramid scheming, fraudulent advertising, and patent infringement. As of 2016, Howard-Browne also served as a &quot;North America Emerald Director&quot; for the multi-level marketing company Jeunesse.

=== Allegation of plot to attack Donald Trump ===
In July 2017, Howard-Browne was one of 17 evangelical pastors who visited the White House to pray for and lay hands on President Donald Trump. In a video several days later, Howard-Browne stated that &quot;there is a planned attack on our president and that&#x27;s all I can tell you about right now; I know what I&#x27;m talking about, I&#x27;ve spoken to high-ranking people in the government&quot;. Howard-Browne later said that the Secret Service met with him to discover which congressman told him about the plot but he refused to say, citing pastoral privilege. Howard-Browne praised God for giving America a &#x27;Rambo&#x27;.

In March 2016, Howard-Browne wrote a Facebook post titled &quot;Donald Trump Is the New World Order&#x27;s Worst Nightmare,&quot; where he detailed his choice to back Trump in the election as a check against a global conspiracy to destroy America.

===Hurricane Irma===
In September 2017, Howard-Browne received media attention after referring to Hurricane Irma—a category 4 storm that caused the death of fifty people in the United States and Caribbean and resulted in power outages affecting 5.5 million people in Florida—as a &quot;nothingburger&quot;. He further stated that &quot;prayer took the teeth out of the storm&quot;.

===Alleging human sacrifice===
In an October 2017 sermon at The River at Tampa Bay church, Howard-Browne alleged that &quot;They sacrifice children at the highest levels in Hollywood. They drink blood of young kids. This is a fact&quot;, continuing, &quot;The human sacrifice and the cannibalism has been going on for years&quot; in Hollywood and Washington, D.C.

===Arming of the River at Tampa Bay church===
Howard-Browne drew attention for a social media post in November 2017, two days after the Sutherland Springs church shooting, stating that his church was not a gun-free zone and that he and the church&#x27;s pastors &quot;are all heavily armed&quot; and would use &quot;deadly force&quot;.

===Conspiracy theories on InfoWars===
In March 2018, Howard-Browne made an appearance on Alex Jones&#x27; InfoWars program during which he claimed: that a string of bombings in Austin, Texas were being used by &quot;anarchist terrorists&quot; in an attempt to bring &quot;everything under control&quot;; that churches and religious groups were being censored in the U.S.; and that &quot;globalist gremlins&quot; were attempting to thwart Donald Trump.

===Christchurch Mosque shootings===
Shortly after the Christchurch mosque shootings in March 2019, Howard-Browne tweeted his opinion that it was a &#x27;false flag&#x27; operation: &quot;There is no doubt that what happened in New Zealand as horrific as it is, is a false flag that will be blamed on conservatives when it&#x27;s all said and done! Only a total nutjob lunatic, insane demonized freak goes into a building and kills people, it&#x27;s unacceptable on every level!&quot;

===Iqaluit sermon===
On August 27, 2019, Howard-Browne delivered a sermon in the Canadian Arctic territory of Nunavut as part of a 300-city tour. He preached for over an hour at an Iqaluit church to a mostly Inuit audience of more than 100 people. The event featured a call for donations, including a video of Howard-Browne claiming &quot;God loves a generous giver,&quot; which &quot;Nunatsiaq News&quot; criticized on the basis that poverty is widespread in the city and nearly half of Nunavut&#x27;s population relies on social assistance amidst long-standing crises in food security and housing. The news outlet also noted that he &quot;lashed out&quot; at and &quot;harangued&quot; audience members who tried to leave before the end of the sermon. Commenting after the event, Anglican bishop for the Arctic, David Parsons, described Howard-Browne as an extremist.

===Coronavirus pandemic===

Howard-Browne kept his church open during the COVID-19 pandemic and on March 15, 2020, he told his congregants to continue shaking hands because they were &quot;revivalists, not pansies&quot;. He dedicated most of the sermon to mocking fears about the spread of the coronavirus and calling it a &quot;phantom plague&quot; designed to shut down churches and terrify people into receiving a vaccine that would cause mass deaths as a population control scheme, which he claimed was part of a plan laid out in a 2010 document &quot;Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development&quot; produced by The Rockefeller Foundation and Global Business Network. Several weeks prior, Howard-Browne claimed in a video that he would cure Florida of coronavirus, and in a 2019 video he had falsely claimed that he and other worshipers at his church had cleansed Florida of Zika virus.

On March 29, 2020, Howard-Browne&#x27;s congregation received a visit from the Hillsborough County Sheriff&#x27;s Office warning about his violations of the county&#x27;s safer-at-home order, which limited public gatherings to 10 people. The next day, Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister announced that he had issued an arrest warrant for unlawful assembly and for violating rules regarding public health emergencies after Howard-Browne continued to hold large church services in defiance of the public order. Chronister said he had no choice but to take action against Howard-Browne, stating &quot;His reckless disregard for human life put hundreds of people from his congregation at risk and thousands of residents who may interact with them this week.&quot;

On March 30, 2020, Howard-Browne was arrested and jailed for unlawful assembly and for violating health and safety rules, with each charge carrying a maximum penalty of 60 days in jail and a $500 fine. He was released from jail after posting a $500 bond. On April 1, Howard-Browne said that he would not open his church the following weekend over fear of his congregation&#x27;s safety and to protect them from &quot;government tyranny.&quot; However, his lawyer, Mathew Staver of the law firm Liberty Counsel, said that Howard-Browne&#x27;s arrest earlier in the week had led to the pastor&#x27;s insurance policy being cancelled. Howard-Browne also claimed that he had received death threats. The pastor held open the possibility that the church would be open for Easter services but then announced on April 9 that it would instead be closed. Prosecutors dropped the charges on May 15, deeming that Howard-Browne posed no ongoing risk to public health after he took steps to maintain responsible social distancing at the church. Starting in May 2020, he reopened the church as TheStand20.

Bennett was born in Garden, Michigan, his mother was an immigrant from Luxembourg. He attended the public schools, and graduated from Watersmeet High School. He graduated from Marquette University Law School in 1925 and took a post-graduate course at the University of Chicago Law School in 1926.

He was admitted to the Wisconsin bar in 1925 and to the Michigan bar in 1926. He practiced law in Ontonagon, Michigan, from 1926 through 1942. He was prosecuting attorney of Ontonagon County from 1929 to 1934 and the deputy commissioner of the Michigan Department of Labor and Industry from 1935 to 1937.

==Tenure in Congress==
Bennett was unsuccessful in his first two attempts for a seat in the United States House of Representatives, losing in 1938 and 1940 to incumbent Democrat Frank E. Hook. In 1942 Bennett defeated Hook and was elected as a Republican from Michigan&#x27;s 12th congressional district to the 78th Congress, serving from January 3, 1943, to January 3, 1945.

In 1944 Bennett lost the election to Hook. Two years later in 1946 he returned to Congress once again, having been unsuccessfully challenged by Emil Hurja in the Republican primary. He was subsequently re-elected to the eight succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1947, until his death from cancer in Chevy Chase, Maryland, in August 1964.

In Congress, Bennett was a moderate Republican who voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960, but voted in favor of 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as well as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 shortly before his death at age 60.

He is interred in Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Silver Spring, Maryland.

<text>Hatteras Island (historically Croatoan Island, sometimes referred to as Hatorask) is a barrier island located off the North Carolina coast. Dividing the Atlantic Ocean and the Pamlico Sound, it runs parallel to the coast, forming a bend at Cape Hatteras. It is part of North Carolina&#x27;s Outer Banks and includes the communities of Rodanthe, Waves, Salvo, Avon, Buxton, Frisco, and Hatteras. It contains the largest part of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. Prior to European settlement the island was inhabited by Croatoan Native Americans. 

The island has a land area of and a population of 4,322, as of the 2010 census. It lies in parts of Kinnakeet Township and Hatteras Township in Dare County, and Ocracoke Township in Hyde County. Hatteras Island is known for sport fishing, surfing, windsurfing and kiteboarding, and Hatteras Village is known as the &quot;Blue Marlin Capital of the World&quot;.

The island is one of the longest in the contiguous United States, measuring along a straight line from end to end, or roughly along the curve of the land. The island, because of its function as a barrier island and its low lying profile, has experienced significant coastal erosion because of sea level rise. Some sections have significantly eroded already, with portions of Hatteras Island at 25% of its original width as of 2014.

==History==

===Pre-Columbian era===
The Croatoan Indians were the first human inhabitants of Hatteras Island. The Croatoans were composed of two groups: the Hatterask and the Kinnakeet. As Native Americans were often named by either their main town, their language, or by what they called themselves, Kinnakeet referred to an area on Croatoan Island (modern day Avon) as did Hatterask (modern day Frisco, not modern day Hatteras village). The central village was called Croatoan (council town, which is modern day Buxton), which is why the Native Americans and the Island were referred to by the English as Croatoans from Croatoan.

===Colonial era===
The story of the missing colony of Roanoke began when John White finally returned to Roanoke on a fifth voyage to the colony, a much-delayed re-supply mission arriving in 1590. At that time, the settlement was found abandoned. The only clues to the colonists&#x27; whereabouts were the letters &quot;CRO&quot; carved into the bark of a nearby tree and the word &quot;Croatoan&quot; found carved into the palisade of the fort. It is logical that the colonists left on Roanoke had gone back to Croatoan, as they had already lived there and had had a strong relationship with the natives, some of whom had visited England.

John White, who made maps showing both Croatoan and Roanoke, wrote in 1590:

 White had instructed them that if anything happened to them, they should carve a Maltese cross on a tree nearby, indicating that their disappearance had been forced. As there was no cross, White took this to mean they had moved to &quot;Croatoan Island&quot; (now known as Hatteras Island). Upon finding the message of CROATOAN carved on the palisade, White also wrote:

However, he was unable to conduct a search, as a massive storm was brewing and his men refused to go any further. The next day, they instead left the area without looking further for the colonists.

== Communities ==

While there are no incorporated places on Hatteras, there are several resort communities along the length of the island. From north to south these are:

*Chicamacomico is the older name for a contiguous settlement now divided into three villages. Together, they form what is known as the &quot;tri-villages&quot;:
**Rodanthe
**Waves
**Salvo
*Avon, formerly named Kinnakeet
*Buxton, the largest community by population on Hatteras Island, home to the Cape Hatteras Light as well as the elementary and secondary school that serves all residents of the island
*Frisco, location of the largest paved airstrip on the Island at Billy Mitchell Airport.
*Hatteras Village, terminus of the ferry to Ocracoke Island.

==Law enforcement==
As there are no incorporated places on Hatteras, the island is patrolled primarily by the Dare County Sheriff&#x27;s Office for general law enforcement, and the North Carolina Highway Patrol for traffic enforcement. Additionally, special subject matter law enforcement is conducted by the North Carolina Wildlife Enforcement and the North Carolina Marine Patrol. On federal lands, patrols are also conducted by the US National Park Service the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the US Marine Patrol, along with US Coast Guard.

The Island has one Coast Guard station. The Station is located adjacent to the ferry terminal. The station has two 47 foot Motor Lifeboats and other small craft. 

Additionally, the Island has a small rescue squad that helps rescue people from the water, and help with marine safety. The rescues squad headquarters are in Buxton, North Carolina

==Accessibility==

For many years, the only ways to reach Hatteras Island was by ferry and footpath.

In November 1963, the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge was completed, connecting Hatteras Island to the northern Outer Banks. The bridge&#x27;s namesake, Herbert Covington Bonner, was a Democratic congressman who represented the area between 1940 and 1965. The $4 million to build the bridge was financed by the State of North Carolina, the U.S. Commerce Department, and the National Park Service.

From the south, Hatteras is reached by way of a 40-minute ride on the Ocracoke-Hatteras ferry. Presently there is no direct route linking Hatteras Island to the Hyde County mainland, resulting in a 2-3 hour commute around the Pamlico Sound.

During a storm on October 26, 1990, a fishing dredge broke loose from its mooring and destroyed part of the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge, cutting Hatteras Island&#x27;s only bridge to the north. The bridge was repaired by February 1991.

In 2011, Hurricane Irene destroyed part of Highway 12 between Nags Head and Rodanthe. Until the construction of a temporary bridge in October 2011, the only way of accessing Hatteras Island was by ferry.

In March 2016, the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) began construction of a bridge to replace the Bonner Bridge. The replacement bridge, named after Senator Marc Basnight, was opened in February 2019.

==Education==
Residents are zoned to Dare County Schools. Zoned schools are Cape Hatteras Elementary School and Cape Hatteras Secondary School.

<doc id="1012916" wikidata="Q14340339" url="?curid=1012916" title="Harold Stanley">
<text>Harold Stanley (October 2, 1885 – May 14, 1963) was an American businessman and one of the founders of Morgan Stanley in 1935. For 20 years, he ran Morgan Stanley until he left the firm in 1955.

==Early life==
Stanley was born in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, the son of William Stanley, Jr. and Lila Courtney Stanley. William was an inventor with General Electric for whom the Stanley Works building was named in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. He graduated from the Hotchkiss School in 1904 and Yale University in 1908. Harold Stanley was a member of the Skull and Bones secret society.

==Career==
He became a vice-president of the bond department of the Guaranty Trust Company of New York in 1916, eventually spinning the division off into a separate and subsidiary securities company, the Guaranty Company, where he worked in cooperation with J. P. Morgan, Jr. In 1927, Morgan invited Stanley to become a partner in his firm, replacing Dwight Morrow, who became the United States Ambassador to Mexico. He made his name as a leader of the investment banking industry at J.P. Morgan, making the firm a strong player in securities offerings and especially the bond market, particularly after the Glass–Steagall Act separated commercial and investment banking. 

In 1935, along with Henry Sturgis Morgan, J. P. Morgan&#x27;s grandson and J. P. Morgan Jr.&#x27;s son, he helped found Morgan Stanley to take up the securities business that had to be given up by J. P. Morgan, and became the firm&#x27;s senior partner when it was reorganized from a corporation to a partnership in 1941. Stanley was influential in his testimony in the 1940s successfully defending the industry against government charges that it was anti-competitive.

==Personal life==
He married Edith Thurston, daughter of William Harris Thurston, in 1914. She died in 1934, and he married Louise Todd, widow of Seymour Parker Gilbert, in 1939. He had stepchildren, but no children from either of his marriages. He resided at 4 East 72nd Street on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side in New York City and died in Philadelphia in 1963.

===Activities and interests===
He was a member of the Links Club of New York, the National Golf Club, the Racquet and Tennis Club, and the Yale Club. He was a director of many companies including the Shell Caribbean Petroleum Corporation.

Stanley played ice hockey at Yale University between 1906 and 1908 and later on the St. Nicholas Hockey Club in the American Amateur Hockey League.

===Philanthropy===
In 1940, he led the New York campaign to raise $1.5 million () for the United States Commission for the Care of European Children, a private organization providing relief to young war refugees.

<text>The General Security Directorate (GSD) (مديرية الامن العامة, &quot;Mudiriyat al-Amn al-Amma&quot;) was the intelligence agency of Iraq. Although details on its organisation were not made clear at the time, the General Security Directorate&#x27;s designated mission was to &quot;infiltrate and annihilate Iraq&#x27;s tenacious insurgency&quot;.

The GSD was eventually replaced by the Iraqi National Intelligence Service.

==History==
After the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, L. Paul Bremer disbanded Saddam Hussein&#x27;s military and security services, including the Mukhabarat. As the security situation within Iraq deteriorated and Iraqi resistance to the occupation became stronger and more violent, the need for a secret service became more pressing. In December 2003, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported, Iyad Allawi and Nouri Badran, two members of the Interim Governing Council and Iraqi National Accord officials, flew to the US to discuss details of setting up a new secret service with the help of the CIA. The agency was to be headed by Badran and recruit many agents of Saddam&#x27;s Mukhabarat. The main objective of the new organisation was to counter the insurgency.

In January 2004, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that the creation of the new agency was under way. It was to employ between 500 and 2,000 staff and be financed by the U.S. government. Ibrahim al-Janabi was said to be the main candidate for leading the spy agency. These efforts drew criticism from Ahmed Chalabi, another formerly exiled Iraqi politician who had good connections with the CIA, who voiced worries that the new agency might be used for the restoration of the old Ba&#x27;athist security apparatus and follow the well-established pattern of government repression.

In March 2004, L. Paul Bremer announced the creation of the Iraqi National Intelligence Service, headed by Mohammed Abdullah Mohammed al-Shahwani and replaced the GSD. The INIS is funded from secret funds set aside within the Iraq appropriation approved by the US Congress. These secret funds, totalling $3 billion over three years, are said to be destined for covert CIA operations within Iraq (as well as, to a small extent, Afghanistan).

In June 2004, it was reported that the GSD also included ex-Iraqi Intelligence Service agents. It was announced by interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi at a press conference in July 2004 in a climate of widespread violence by terrorist groups and the Iraqi insurgency.

<text>The Iraqi National Intelligence Service (INIS; ) is a civilian intelligence agency whose constitutional duties is to collect intelligence, assess threats to national security, and advise the Iraqi government. The INIS is subject to legislative oversight and is attached to the Council of Ministers. It was created with the help of the CIA to replace the Mukhabarat, the main intelligence agency of the country. 

According to the constitution, a law that regulates the work and defines the duties and authorities of the agency must be passed by the Council of Representatives, but as of 2024, this is yet to be implemented.

==History==
After the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority L. Paul Bremer disbanded Iraq&#x27;s military and security services per CPA Order Number 2. As the security situation within Iraq deteriorated and Iraqi resistance to the occupation became stronger and more violent, the need for a secret service became more pressing. In December 2003, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Iyad Allawi and Nouri Badran, members of both the Iraq Interim Governing Council and the Iraqi National Accord political party, flew to the U.S. to discuss details of setting up a new secret service with the help of the CIA. The agency was to be headed by Badran and recruit many agents of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraqi Intelligence Service. The main objective of the new organisation was to counter the insurgency. The hiring process was aided by CIA polygraph

In January 2004, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the creation of the new agency was under way. It was to employ between 500 and 2,000 staff and be financed by the U.S. government. Ibrahim al-Janabi was said to be the main candidate for leading the agency. These efforts drew criticism from Ahmed Chalabi, another formerly exiled Iraqi politician who had good connections with the CIA, who voiced worries that the new agency might be used for the restoration of the old Ba&#x27;athist security apparatus and follow the well-established pattern of government repression.

===Establishment===
In April 2004, CPA head L. Paul Bremer signed Authority Order Number 69, which laid out a charter for the INIS and authorized the Iraqi Governing Council to create such an agency. Its first director is Mohammed Abdullah al-Shahwani and it has been funded from secret funds set aside within the Iraq appropriation approved by the U.S. Congress. These secret funds, totalling $3 billion over three years, are said to be destined for covert CIA operations within Iraq (as well as, to a small extent, Afghanistan). Al-Shehwani was in the Iraqi military from 1955 until 1984, fled to the UK in 1990 and lost his three sons in the 1996 failed coup organized by INA (Iraqi National Accord) and the CIA.

===Assassinations===
In mid-2004, 18 INIS agents were killed—ten by the Badr Organization and eight by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi&#x27;s Al-Qaeda in Iraq according to al-Shahwani. He also accused the Iranian embassy in Baghdad of organizing the Badr assassinations.

In 2021, a number of members of the agency were subjected to assassination, such as: the assassination of the assistant director of monitoring in the intelligence service, Colonel Nibras Abu Ali, and the assassination of an intelligence officer in the Mansour area, west of Baghdad.

According to Iraqi sources, the assassinations come as a &quot;reaction&quot; from the militias towards the restrictions imposed on them by the Al-Kadhimi government in several areas, including changing military and security leaders, removing members affiliated with Iran-backed militas from sensitive areas such as Karrada area near the Green Zone and the airport, and arresting leaders and people affiliated with them such as Hussam Al-Azerjawi, Qassem Musleh and the leader of the assassination squad in Basra during the 2019-21 protests.

==Mission==
According to CPA Order 69, which established the INIS, it is tasked to collect intelligence and perform intelligence activities with regard to: 

*Threats to the national security of Iraq. 
*Terrorism and Insurgency.
*Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, narcotics production and trafficking, and serious organized crime.
*Espionage and other acts threatening to Iraqi democracy.

Article 9 of the constitution of Iraq defines the basic duties of the agency.

<text>RTL is a French commercial radio network owned by the RTL Group through Groupe M6. Founded in 1933 as Radio Luxembourg, it broadcast from outside of France until 1981 because only public stations had been allowed until then. It is a general-interest, news, talk and music station, broadcasting nationally (&quot;category E&quot; as classified by the CSA) in France, Francophone Belgium, and Luxembourg. Until 2022, RTL was also broadcast on long wave frequency 234 kHz from Beidweiler which could be picked up in large parts of the continent. It has a sister station called Bel RTL tailored for the French Community of Belgium. As of 2018, RTL is France&#x27;s most popular radio station with an average of 6.4 million daily listeners that year.

==History==

===Radio Luxembourg===

On 19 December 1929 the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg established a state monopoly on broadcasting, but the law provided for possible concessions to private companies who wanted to use radio bandwidth, with the state charging a fixed amount for private use of radio.

The &quot;Société Luxembourgeoise d&#x27;Études Radiophoniques&quot; (SLER) was founded on 11 May 1929 with the aim of obtaining an eventual broadcasting contract from the Luxembourg government. This company was run by Luxembourger François Anen, French publisher Henry Etienne, and French engineer Jean le Duc representing the &quot;Compagnie des Compteurs de Montrouge&quot;, which possessed 84% of the project&#x27;s capital and had signed a secret agreement to work with the group CSF, the main stockholder in Radio Paris. Radio Paris wanted to set up a powerful peripheral radio station in Luxembourg, outside of the strict French regulations that only allowed public stations. A 25-year agreement between the SLER and the Luxembourg government signed on 29 September 1930 ensured the Luxembourg government a fee of 30% on future profits of the station. The agreement also set up a committee for programming and a technical committee which allowed the government to regulate the private station.

The Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Radiodiffusion (CLR) was founded on 30 May 1931, officially replacing the SLER.

On 14 January 1933, experimental broadcasts by Radio Luxembourg began at 1191 metres (200 kW), an unauthorized wavelength, from the longwave transmitter at Junglinster. The official opening of broadcast was on 15 March 1933 at 19:00 with a pre-recorded concert of light music. Radio Luxembourg broadcast each evening from 19:00 to 23:00, in German, French and Dutch and was therefore the only French-language private broadcaster available in France and Belgium. Programmes in English débuted on 3 December 1933 under the editorial guidance of Stephen Williams.

The station closed down at the outbreak of World War II in 1939, but it resumed service after the War.

Beginning in 1946, it could be heard easily in France. Until the 1980s, only the French public radio networks could transmit from France itself. Radio Luxembourg was one of private &quot;peripheral&quot; networks transmitting from abroad.

Radio Luxembourg quickly gained a large audience in France. In the 1960s, it was faced with the success of another peripheral network from Germany, Europe 1, which adopted a modern tone and attracted a young audience.

===RTL===
Radio Luxembourg&#x27;s changing environment led to the station being renamed &quot;RTL&quot; on 11 October 1966, less obviously mentioning its connection with Luxembourg (the acronym being short for &quot;Radio Télévision Luxembourg&quot;).

During the May 1968 civil unrest and protests by workers and students, the French public radio networks were on strike and TV was not independent from the government. RTL and Europe 1 were the main ways of obtaining independent information for the French people. They were nicknamed &quot;barricades radio&quot;.

Unlike the British government&#x27;s treatment of the Luxembourg English service, which was never allowed to have a landline from London, the French service has long had its main studios in Paris, with a landline from there to the transmitter. Consequently, it appears to the listener as simply a big French national radio station, as the Luxembourg connection is downplayed.

In 1981, under president François Mitterrand, privately run radio stations were allowed to broadcast in France. RTL, now broadcasting in France mostly at 104.3 MHz, was the radio network with the most listeners from 1981 to 2002.

Whereas Luxembourg&#x27;s English service was always centred on light entertainment and popular music, RTL France is a mixed station. About 50% of its broadcast is information and talk focusing on news and current affairs with a large team of respected journalists.

Radio Luxembourg&#x27;s two main national competitors are Europe 1 (another out-of-country commercial station, broadcasting from Saarland, again with Paris studios) and the state-owned France Inter. All three stations used to have very high-powered transmitters occupying long-wave frequencies that date back many decades.

The French service has called itself RTL for many years. It broadcasts through a network of FM transmitters throughout France, as well as the internet, cable and satellite. 

In 1991 a separate RTL Belgian service in French, called Bel-RTL, was established. Intended for the French-speaking part of Belgium with studios in Brussels, this station is licensed (along with many competing commercial stations) by the Belgian Government with a network of FM transmitters covering Brussels and Wallonia. It has no particular connection with the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg other than its ownership by the RTL parent company.

, RTL was the second-most listened to channel in France, behind France Inter, according to the Médiamétrie Étude Audience Radio survey. In the November–December 2021 survey period, RTL had about 6 million daily listeners.

In October 2022, RTL announced it would end its longwave broadcasts on January 1, 2023, in an effort to reduce the company&#x27;s energy use.

RTL&#x27;s long-wave broadcasts on 234 kHz were discontinued on January 2, 2023, at midnight UTC.

<doc id="1012926" wikidata="Q473579" url="?curid=1012926" title="Passenger (1963 film)">
<text>Passenger () is a 1963 Polish feature film directed by Andrzej Munk. When Munk died in a car crash during production, the unfinished film was assembled for release by directors Witold Lesiewicz and Andrzej Brzozowski.

&quot;Passenger&quot;, using the form of a documentary, dramatizes the memories of a fictional SS officer (played by Aleksandra Śląska) who had served at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. &quot;The Passenger&quot; examines the nature of oppressor and victim within the microcosm of a German extermination camp during the Jewish Holocaust.

==Plot==

&quot;The Passenger&quot; begins in 1960, fifteen years after the end of World War II. The setting is a transatlantic voyage aboard a luxury liner en route from South America to Europe.

Liza Kretschmer (Alexandra Śląska), a former concentration camp SS officer, has a chance encounter with a fellow passenger who was one of her inmates at the camp, Marta (Anna Ciepielewska). Aboard the vessel, the roles of Liza and Marta are more or less reversed. Marta is in a position to expose the former Nazi as a war criminal, and if not to the authorities, at least to Liza’s husband, who is ignorant of her past. 
The meeting unleashes a cascade of memories for Liza, in which she struggles to revisit the events at the extermination center, and the nature of her behavior towards Marta. In a series of flashbacks, Liza’s internal narrative, which serves to rationalize her role, clashes with memories of the systematic murder of men, woman and children that characterized the Holocaust. The complexities of the relationship between perpetrator and victim reveals the degradation of Marta, who survived by accommodating herself to her oppressors.

==Production history==

Munk, at the age of 39, died in a car accident while the film was in production and the completed scenes were combined from parts of original footage and screenplay sketches by Witold Lesiewicz. The methods used are explained in a voice-over during the course of the film, so its unfinished state itself takes a documentary form. Parts of the film were shot at Auschwitz. The source for &quot;The Passenger&quot; was a radio drama titled &quot;Passenger from Cabin Number 45&quot;, written by Zofia Posmysz-Piasecka in 1959.

Posmysz&#x27;s play was later reworked into a novel. It was published in 1962 as &quot;Pasażerka&quot;.

When the work was made into an opera in 1968, American audiences were first alerted to Munk&#x27;s impressive cinematic &quot;oeuvre&quot;.

From the novel, &quot;The Passenger&quot; was adapted into an opera &quot;The Passenger&quot; by Polish-Jewish-Soviet Composer Mieczysław Weinberg in 1967/68, in collaboration with Posmysz. The success of the opera since its staged premiere in 2010 has prompted a renewed interest in Munk&#x27;s film.

<text>The ABC Robin was a British single-seat light aircraft designed by A. A. (Tony) Fletcher in 1929. It was a high-wing, single-seat monoplane of conventional taildragger configuration. The cockpit was fully enclosed, the first lightplane to be so equipped in Britain. It was designed at the request of T. A. Dennis (managing director) specifically to use the firm&#x27;s 30–40 h.p. Scorpion engine.

Construction was primarily of wood with metal confined to fittings and a few highly stressed parts. The fuselage was constructed as a wooden box consisting of four spruce longerons with thin plywood covering with light internal bulkheads. The wood-framed wings, of RAF 34 section, were hinged at their inner rear corners to the top of the fuselage and supported by tubular struts in &#x27;Vee&#x27; formation to the lower longerons of the fuselage. The tail was also wood-framed and both wings and tail were covered with doped fabric.

The Robin, registered G-AAID, was built by ABC Motors Limited at Hersham in 1929. Its first flight was made at Brooklands in June and it was displayed at the Olympia Aero Show in July. ABC had no aircraft manufacturing facilities, so production aircraft were intended to be made by S. E. Saunders at East Cowes, Isle of Wight. Marketing was taken seriously, with the aircraft painted in the colours of National Flying Services (NFS) from whom an order was anticipated, and it was featured in the NFS 1929 Annual.

The aircraft was modified later in 1929 with the windscreen moved back to allow access to the fuel filler caps from the outside, and with an enlarged fin and rudder. It was granted its certificate of airworthiness in June 1930 and a week later took part in the King&#x27;s Cup Air Race, but it dropped out with engine problems, which were common with the Scorpion engine. Unfortunately, due to the Great Depression, there was no demand for the aircraft and the sole Robin built was scrapped at Brooklands in 1932.

<doc id="1012943" wikidata="Q4537871" url="?curid=1012943" title="Gary Younge">
<text>Gary Andrew Younge , (born January 1969) is a British journalist, author, broadcaster and academic. He was editor-at-large for &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, which he joined in 1993. In November 2019, it was announced that Younge had been appointed as professor of sociology at the University of Manchester and would be leaving his post at &quot;The Guardian&quot;, where he was a columnist for two decades, although he continued to write for the newspaper. He also writes for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;.

Younge is the author of the books &quot;No Place Like Home&quot; (2002), &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; (2006), and &quot;Who Are We – And Should It Matter in the 21st Century?&quot; (2011), &quot;The Speech: The Story Behind Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s Dream&quot; (2013), and &quot;Another Day in the Death of America&quot; (2016).

==Early years and education==
Younge grew up in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, where he was born. He is of Barbadian extraction.

In 1984, aged 15, he briefly joined the Young Socialists, the youth section of the Workers Revolutionary Party, but left a year later after harassment from other party members, including allegedly being accused of working for MI5 and claims that he supported Fidel Castro only because of his ethnicity. At the age of 17, Younge went to teach English in a United Nations Eritrean refugee school in Sudan with the educational charity Project Trust.

From 1987 to 1992, he attended Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland, where he studied French and Russian, and was elected vice president (welfare) of the student association, a paid sabbatical post that he held for a year.

==Career==
In his final year at university, Younge was awarded a bursary from &quot;The Guardian&quot; to study journalism at The City University in London, and after a short internship at Yorkshire Television he joined &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1993, and has since reported from all over Europe, and Africa, the US and the Caribbean.

His 1999 debut book, &quot;No Place Like Home&quot;, in which he retraced the route of the civil rights Freedom Riders, was shortlisted for the Guardian First Book Award. His subsequent books are &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land: Encounters in the Disunited States&quot; (2006), &quot;Who Are We – And Should It Matter in the 21st Century?&quot; (2011), &quot;The Speech: The Story Behind Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s Dream&quot; (2013), and most recently &quot;Another Day in the Death of America: A Chronicle of Ten Short Lives&quot; (2016), a &quot;deeply affecting&quot; account of everyday fatalities among young people across the US, which in 2017 won the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize from Columbia Journalism School and the Nieman Foundation for Journalism. Younge also wrote a monthly column for &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine, &quot;Beneath the Radar&quot;.

In 2019, Younge was appointed a professor of sociology in the School of Social Sciences at Manchester University, writing his last column for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in January 2020.

Younge was named on the 2020 list of 100 Great Black Britons. In addition, on the 2020 and 2021 &quot;Powerlist&quot;, Younge was listed among the Top 100 of the most influential people in the UK of African/African-Caribbean descent.

His 2023 book, &quot;Dispatches from the Diaspora: From Nelson Mandela to Black Lives Matter&quot;, a collection of his journalism covering four decades of reporting from Britain, the US, and South Africa, was described in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; as &quot;a reminder of how much racism has changed and how much it has stayed the same.&quot; It was said by the &quot;TLS&quot; reviewer to &quot;offer compelling, nuanced reflections on politics, history and culture&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 2011, Younge relocated to Chicago, Illinois, where he lived with his immediate family until returning to the UK in 2015. In 2015, he announced his intention to move to Hackney in London, with his wife and two children. His brother Pat Younge was chief creative officer of BBC Vision, becoming chair of the council at Cardiff University in 2022.

<text>Christophe Dechavanne (; born 23 January 1958) is a French television and radio host and program producer. He is the host of &quot;La Roue de la fortune&quot;.

==Biography==
Dechavanne attended the Cours Hattemer, a private school. He started working as a radio host in the early 1980s. In 1985, he presented the daily talk-show &quot;C&#x27;est encore mieux l&#x27;après-midi&quot; on the state-owned television channel Antenne 2. In 1987, he went to work for the newly privatized channel TF1 : his first show, &quot;Panique sur le 16&quot;, was not a success, but he soon found his niche with the late-night weekly talk-show &quot;Ciel mon mardi !&quot;, a program which could be compared to Jerry Springer productions in United States. Dechavanne&#x27;s energetic public persona and the frequent heated arguments between his guests proved popular among audiences, despite attracting criticism from several French media outlets. Dechavanne became his own producer in 1989, by creating the company Coyote productions.

From 1992 to 1994, Dechavanne presented the popular daily talk-show &quot;Coucou c&#x27;est nous !&quot;. However, he was less successful with the prime-time show &quot;Tout le toutim&quot;, which was stopped after four weeks for lack of sufficient audience shares. In 1997, he went back to state-owned television channels and presented &quot;Télé Qua Non&quot; and &quot;Du fer dans les épinards&quot; on France 2. He was then absent from television for several years and concentrated on his radio work for RTL and Europe 1.

In 2003, he took part on TF1 to &quot;Nice People&quot;, a French equivalent of sorts to &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, where common people and celebrities were locked in a house. He was then the host of &quot;La Ferme Célébrités&quot; in 2004 and 2005. Currently, Dechavanne hosts the French version of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, entitled &quot;La Roue de la fortune&quot; and presents special shows on a regular basis.

He is in relationship with Elena Foïs, twenty-two years younger than him, sister of french actress Marina Foïs.

<text>The SIG Sauer P226 is a full-sized service pistol made by SIG Sauer. This model is available in four chamberings: the 9×19mm Parabellum, .40 S&amp;W, .357 SIG, or .22 Long Rifle. It has the same mechanism of operation as the SIG Sauer P220, but is developed to use higher capacity, double stack magazines in place of the single stack magazines of the P220.

The P226 itself has spawned further sub-variants; the P228 and P229 are both compact versions of the double stack P226 design, while the P224 is a subcompact variant. The SIG Sauer P226 and its variants are in service with numerous law enforcement and military organizations worldwide.

==History==
Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG) is a Swiss company, now known as Sig Sauer AG. In 1975, SIG entered into an agreement with German gun manufacturer J.P. Sauer &amp; Sohn to develop and market a new handgun which became the P220. The P220 was the first SIG Sauer handgun sold in the US. It was marketed initially by Browning as the Browning BDA. The SIG Sauer P220 is a refinement of the Petter-Browning design used in the SIG P210. The locked breech design is very different and was pioneered by SIG Sauer.

The P226 was designed for entry into the XM9 Service Pistol Trials (see also Joint Service Small Arms Program) that were held by the US Army in 1984 on behalf of the US Armed Forces to find a replacement for the M1911A1 and 24 other makes of handgun in US military service. Only the Beretta 92SBF and the SIG P226 satisfactorily completed the trials. According to a GAO report, Beretta was awarded the M9 contract for the 92F due to a lower total package price. The P226 cost less per pistol than the 92F, but SIG&#x27;s package price with magazines and spare parts was higher than Beretta&#x27;s. The Navy SEALs, however, later chose to adopt the P226 as the P226 MK25 with special corrosion protection.

For the U.S. military XM9 trials, the P226 was imported by Saco Defense. Interarms took over importing when the pistol was introduced for civilian sales. SIG Sauer eventually founded SIGARMS, Inc. (now SIG Sauer) in the United States to handle importation of their products. In 2000, SIG Holding AG sold J.P. Sauer &amp; Sohn GmbH to two German businessmen. The brand name SIG Sauer remained at J.P. Sauer &amp; Sohn GmbH.

==Manufacture==
SIG Sauer firearms are manufactured in Eckernförde, Germany by Sig Sauer, GmbH and in Newington, New Hampshire, United States by SIG Sauer Inc., (formerly SIGARMS Inc.). Both of these companies along with Swiss Arms AG, Mauser Jagdwaffen GmbH, J.P. Sauer &amp; Sohn, John Rigby &amp; Company, German Sport Guns GmbH and Blaser Jagdwaffen Gmbh are subsidiaries of Luke and Ortmeier Gruppe of Emsdetten, Germany.

Copies of the P226 are produced in China by Norinco, under the name of NP22. These were subcontracted to the Zhejiang Xinhua Machinery Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (浙江省机电集团), known as State Factory 972 or known as the Xinhua Factory. Subsequent manufacturing improved on its ability to withstand failure after more than 10,000 rounds are fired.

The variants consist of the NP22, NP22A, NP34, NP56 and the NP58. The SDM XM9 is a variant of the NP22 chambered in 9×21mm for countries that don&#x27;t allow any pistol calibers that are only for the military and police. The LP3 and LP4 are versions of the NP22 and NP34 with manual safeties on the slide. The NP762 is chambered to fire 7.62×25mm bullets, which were exported in 2019. They were first made by Xinhua in 1999 and were known then as the NP2000 for potential contracts in China for the PLA and various law enforcement agencies.

The ZOAF is a clone of the P226 made in Iran.

==Variants==
===P226 Navy===

U.S. Navy SEAL teams started using the SIG P226 in the 1980s, after German Kampfschwimmer tested them successfully. In 1989, the P226 was adopted by the U.S. Navy SEALs and DEVGRU under the name Mk25 Mod 0.

The first Naval Special Warfare inspired P226 pistols to be offered to the public were the NSW Commemoratives, issued in early 2004. The SIG P226-9-NAVY is a version of the SIG P226 produced that features a stainless steel slide engraved with an anchor to designate them as Naval Special Warfare pistols. SIGARMS raised $100,000 for the Special Operations Warrior Foundation through the sale of these NSW serialized pistols. The pistol with the serial number NSW0001 was sold during a live auction on the US-wide syndicated Laura Ingraham radio show for an additional $25,000. Later produced commercial versions added a universal rail for accessory attachments while retaining the anchor of previous models, but do not have the SIGLITE Night Sights.

===P226 E2===

Introduced at the 2010 SHOT Show, the P226 E2 at the time was a significant update to the P226 line. &#x27;E2&#x27; (pronounced &#x27;E-squared&#x27;), or otherwise known as &quot;Enhanced Ergonomics&quot;, is SIG Sauer&#x27;s attempt to make the large frame gun more ergonomic for persons with small and medium-sized hands. A reduced grip size and reduced reach trigger bring the trigger face back more than , thus potentially allowing better trigger manipulation and control for a greater number of shooters. Other standard features include the Short Reset Trigger, aggressive grip finish texture, and a new wrap-around, one-piece grip panel configuration. The gun was discontinued from the P226 model lineup at the end of 2010 but the E2-style grip system has been adopted on and carried over to other P226 variants.

===P228 (M11)===

A compact version of the P226, the P228 is in use with various law enforcement agencies and also with the United States Armed Forces, where it is designated as the M11. The P228 has a shorter slide and barrel than the P226. Unlike the P226, the P228 is available only in 9×19mm Parabellum with a 13-round magazine, but can also use P226 15- or 20-round magazines. Aftermarket magazines extend the capacity of the P228 to 15 rounds.

From a distance, the P228 can be differentiated from the P226 by comparing the trigger guards (the P228&#x27;s is curved, while the P226&#x27;s is slightly hooked) and the barrel and slide lengths (the P228&#x27;s barrel , thus having a corresponding shorter slide). Also in a side-by-side comparison the P228 would appear slightly shorter ( shorter) than the P226. The larger capacity P226 magazine can also be employed in the P228 although it extends from the base of the grip. Civilian sales of the P228 were discontinued with the introduction of 9mm chambering in the P229 but were recently reintroduced in limited quantities to civilians with an accessory rail and hooked trigger guard, designated the P228R.

The P229 is nearly identical to the P228, however its slide is made from milled stainless steel (versus the P228&#x27;s folded carbon steel slide) and is available in 9mm, .40 S&amp;W, and .357 SIG. In the summer of 2012, SIG Sauer announced they were releasing the M11A1, which is essentially the milled-slide P229 chambered in 9mm with P228-labeled grips, a short reset trigger, SIGLITE tritium night sights, Mec-Gar 15-round magazines, and a military style smart tag and serial number. Later in 2012, U.S. Air Force M11b versions of the P228 were released for civilian sale. The M11 is to be replaced in the Army and Air Force through the Modular Handgun System program.
On January 19, 2017, it was announced that the SIG Sauer P320 Compact (M18) had been selected to replace the M11 as the U.S military service pistol. One factor in winning the Modular Handgun System competition was the ability to employ 9mm Parabellum, .357 Sig or .40 S&amp;W cartridges within the same basic frame.

===P229===
Introduced in 1992, the P229 is an upgrade to the P228 being an identical compact firearm often used for duty or concealed carry purposes. Developed specifically for the US market and assembled with both German and US-made parts, the P229 features a heavier slide to tolerate more powerful rounds than the P228 is capable of tolerating. The standard version features a DA/SA trigger. The pistol has also been made available in a Double Action Kellerman (DAK) model, which is a DAO system with two trigger reset points, and a lighter, smoother pull than that of traditional DAO handguns. Most of the above-mentioned factory variants of the P226 are also available for the P229, including the Equinox option, Elite lineup, as well as a SAS GEN 2 model.

The P229 differs from its cousin the P226 in several respects, and was originally introduced to supplement and then replace the P228 by adding the .357 SIG and .40 S&amp;W as available chamberings. The P229 was the first production handgun introduced that could chamber the .357 SIG round. The P226 and P228 were originally manufactured using a stamped-steel slide on an aluminum alloy frame. The P229 consists of a CNC-milled stainless steel slide, typically colored black with a Nitron finish. The P229&#x27;s milled steel slide was introduced to handle the higher slide velocities created by the .357 SIG and .40 S&amp;W loads, which the stamped slide of the P228 could not handle without the use of a much stiffer recoil spring. This would have made operating the slide manually much more difficult, so the use of a milled stainless slide (coupled with the new milling and stainless production capabilities found in the U.S. factory) with a standard weight recoil spring was chosen instead.

A standard weight recoil spring for the P229 is . A spring weight of or higher would have been required if a stamped slide was used for the .40 S&amp;W or .357 SIG chamberings. The SAAMI maximum chamber pressures of 9mm, 9mm +P, .40 S&amp;W, and .357 SIG are as follows: ; ; ; and . The slide on the P226 was redesigned in a similar fashion, and civilian sales of the P228 were discontinued in early 2005 due to declining sales and the advent of the P229 in 9mm. The P226 and P229 are both available with optional accessory rails and optional forged stainless steel frames.

The P229 can be chambered in .22 LR, 9mm, .40 S&amp;W or .357 SIG. Changing between .40 S&amp;W and .357 SIG is as simple as switching out the barrel; both calibers use the same magazine. Conversion barrels also allow a P229 or P226 to change between a .40 S&amp;W/.357 SIG to a 9mm caliber. The 9mm model (both railed and non-railed) can be converted to .22 LR, but in the past its receivers were not designed to provide the space needed for handling the larger rounds of .357 SIG and .40 S&amp;W. As SIG Sauer has slowly begun adopting the E2-style grip system across the P229 model range in 2011—a move similar to what is also happening to the larger P226—they have also begun using the .357 SIG/.40 S&amp;W spec frame dimensions for their factory 9mm P229s, presumably to streamline the number of variations in parts needed to be kept in inventory. Although the manufacturer has announced that older-configuration magazines will continue to operate in the new receiver configuration, SIG Sauer has nonetheless revised new P229 9mm factory magazines to a design that is specific to the resized magazine well of the newly reconfigured receiver/frame. As a consequence, the newer magazines are not back-compatible, due to their larger width.

===P224===
The P224 is a subcompact variant of the series. It has a barrel length of and an unloaded weight of . It has a 12-round capacity when chambered in 9mm; it is also available in .357 SIG and .40 S&amp;W. The P224 was introduced in 2012 as double-action only (DAO); it was reintroduced in 2013 as double action / single action (DA/SA) with a decocking lever. The P224 was discontinued in 2016.

<text>The British Rail Class 360 is an electric multiple unit class that was built by Siemens Mobility on its Desiro platform between 2002 and 2005 for First Great Eastern and Heathrow Connect. The remaining members of the class are operated by East Midlands Railway.

==Description==
===Class 360/1===

First Great Eastern ordered 21 four-car Class 360/1s to replace its slam-door Class 312 units. Built in Vienna, Austria, and Uerdingen, Germany the units feature air conditioning, plug doors, CCTV, a wheelchair area, and first class at the cab ends. After being tested at the Wildenrath, Germany and Velim, Czech Republic test tracks, the first entered service in August 2003. In February 2004, unit 360115 returned to Wildenrath for tests aimed at improving pantograph performance.

They were primarily used on Great Eastern Main Line services from London Liverpool Street to Clacton-on-Sea, Colchester Town and Ipswich. They also ran to Walton-on-the-Naze and the Mayflower line. They occasionally operated through to Norwich.

In April 2004, the Great Eastern franchise was merged into the Greater Anglia franchise that was awarded to National Express East Anglia. All passed with the franchise to Greater Anglia in February 2012. The Class 360s were not maintained by the franchisee, but under contract by Siemens at Ilford EMU Depot.

All were replaced by Class 720s in 2020/2021 and moved to East Midlands Railway (EMR) to operate services on the Midland Main Line from London St Pancras to Corby from May 2021. They were modified to operate at . They are now based at Bedford Cauldwell Walk depot.

Beginning in June 2020, all were cycled through Siemens at Kings Heath Depot, Northampton to be modified for operation. The first was transferred to EMR&#x27;s Cricklewood Depot in November 2020, with all having transferred by February 2021.

They entered service with East Midlands Railway on 16 May 2021 after the electrification of the Midland Main Line was complete in 2020 between Bedford and Corby. Two units had received a temporary application of the EMR Connect livery in time for this; full-scale repainting of the fleet began in June 2021.

===Class 360/2===

In June 2003, BAA plc ordered four Class 360 units for its Heathrow Connect service, which was designed to complement the non-stop Heathrow Express service by calling at a number of intermediate stations between London Paddington to Heathrow Airport. Siemens fulfilled the order by rebuilding four units it had previously built in speculation of an order from Angel Trains. One of these, 350001, had already been delivered to England and was being used for training by South West Trains at Northam Traincare Facility, while the others remained at the Wildenrath test track in Germany.

The first rebuilt unit arrived at Heathrow Connect&#x27;s Old Oak Common depot in November 2004, and services commenced in June 2005. An additional unit was subsequently ordered; it arrived in England in November 2005 but did not enter service for a further 12 months. In 2007 five additional intermediate vehicles were procured and used to lengthen each unit to five carriages. In 2010, one unit began operating a Heathrow Central to Heathrow Terminal 4 shuttle, with a new Heathrow Express livery. In May 2018 TfL Rail inherited all five of Heathrow Connect&#x27;s Class 360s, which were replaced by Class 345 units once problems with the European Train Control System in the Heathrow tunnel were resolved. On 30 July 2020, Class 345 units began entering passenger service on the Heathrow branch, and the last Class 360 units were withdrawn on 13 September 2020.

In February 2021, Rail Operations Group (ROG) purchased the five-strong fleet from Heathrow Airport Holdings. The fleet was moved to MoD Bicester for storage pending further use with the company, which potentially included conversion into &quot;fast freight&quot; units. In August 2022, ROG stated that the units would not be repurposed due to technical issues, and that they wished the units to return to passenger service. However, this did not occur, and on 23 August 2022 unit 360205 was taken to Sims Metal in Newport, South Wales, to be scrapped. Unit 360204 followed shortly thereafter.

In October 2022, it was announced that the remaining three units had been acquired by the Global Centre of Rail Excellence (GCRE). The units will be used in the running-in process for the GCRE&#x27;s infrastructure test track, as well as being made available to the railway industry as research and development test trains.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 25 May 2014, 360205 derailed as it entered due to bogie maintenance errors, exacerbated by a track defect.

<doc id="1012962" wikidata="Q3102017" url="?curid=1012962" title="George Witton">
<text>George Ramsdale Witton (28 June 1874 – 14 August 1942) was a lieutenant in the Bushveldt Carbineers in the Boer War in South Africa. He was sentenced to death for murder after the shooting of nine Boer prisoners. He was subsequently reprieved by Lieutenant-General Viscount Kitchener on the grounds that he was following the orders of his colleagues. However, Lieutenants Peter Handcock and Harry &quot;Breaker&quot; Morant, who were court martialled with him, were both executed by firing squad on 27 February 1902.

==Early life and involvement in the Boer War==

Witton was born into a farming family near Warrnambool, Victoria, Australia, with at least one brother. He served as a gunner in the Victorian Artillery Corps, then enlisted in the Victorian Imperial Bushmen for the Boer War and was promoted from Corporal to Squadron Quartermaster-Sergeant. Major Robert Lenehan then enlisted him into the Bushveldt Carbineers with a commission as Lieutenant.

After the killing of a number of Boer prisoners, Witton was one of four officers charged by the British Army with murder, and was convicted.(Witton wrote that he had fired at an escaping Boer to keep him away, although later in &quot;Scapegoats of the Empire,&quot; he admitted that he had shot an escaping Boer prisoner who had tried to seize Witton&#x27;s carbine). However, he strongly protested and secured a legal opinion from Isaac Isaacs KC, an Australian member of parliament, who recommended that he petition HM the King for a pardon.
Kitchener indeed commuted Witton&#x27;s sentence to life imprisonment. After further protests from numerous British and Australian politicians, including the rising Winston Churchill, Witton was released from prison on 11 August 1904. However, he was not pardoned. He had been ill twice in prison in England, once from arsenic fumes in a metal shop and once from typhoid fever. He returned to Australia on 12 November 1904, embittered after serving nearly three years at HMP Lewes, and wrote a book giving his version of the events involving Morant, Handcock and the BVC.

==&quot;Scapegoats of the Empire&quot; book==

Witton&#x27;s book, &quot;Scapegoats of the Empire&quot;, was originally published in 1907 by D. W. Paterson of Melbourne, but was long unavailable. It is claimed that prior to its reprint in 1982 by the Australian publishing house Angus &amp; Robertson, only seven copies of the book survived in various Australian state libraries and in the possession of Witton&#x27;s family. There has been a persistent though unproven allegation that the book was suppressed by the Australian government, and that most copies were destroyed on official instructions; another explanation is that most of the copies were destroyed in an accidental fire at the publisher&#x27;s warehouse. The 1982 reprinting was inspired by the success of a film based on the book, entitled &quot;Breaker Morant&quot;. George Witton&#x27;s cousin, Cecily Adams of Castlecrag (a Sydney suburb), owned the copyright for &quot;Scapegoats of the Empire&quot; following George&#x27;s death. Cecily was also aware of some additional documentation written by George, which he had always refused to make public. Determined that a further edition, which included this additional material, should be released, Cecily arranged in 1989 for a new edition to be published by Adlib Books of Bath, England, through an arrangement with Angus &amp; Robertson. In this version Cecily Adams was herself identified as the copyright owner.

Witton&#x27;s main assertion, as indicated by the book&#x27;s provocative title, was that he, Morant, and Handcock were made scapegoats by the British authorities in South Africa. In the book, he argued that the trio were unfairly arrested and put on trial, and the subsequent court-martial and executions were carried out for political reasons; partly to cover up a controversial and secret &quot;no prisoners&quot; policy promulgated by Lord Kitchener and partly to appease the Boer government over the killing of Afrikaner prisoners of war in order to facilitate a peace treaty (the Treaty of Vereeniging as signed on 31 May 1902).

Witton also claimed that many of the accusations about them, which led to their arrest and trial, were made by disaffected members of their regiment whose rebellious behaviour had been suppressed by Morant and Handcock.

==Later life==

When World War I broke out, an embittered Witton, then aged 40, did not rush to enlist. After former and future Prime Minister Andrew Fisher pledged during the 1914 general election that Australia would defend Britain &quot;to the last man and last shilling,&quot; Witton intimated that he would be that last man.

He lived in Gippsland, Victoria and in Queensland where he was a dairy farmer at &#x27;Dundarrah&#x27; property, Coalstoun Lakes, and by 1928, director of the Biggenden cheese factory. Some of Witton&#x27;s correspondence was cited in the 1932 Queensland royal commission into the butter industry and commissions paid to butter company managers. Dundarrah was sold in September 1936. He was involved as the secretary and treasurer of the Biggenden Golf Club, and a cup was in his name; and involved in competitive rifle shooting.

George married Mary Louisa Humphrey in September 1913. She died in March 1931, aged 56 years, and was buried at the Lutwyche Cemetery, Brisbane. In September 1932, he married Carolen Ellen Stranger. He did not have any children, although George and Mary Witton in 1928 sought to adopt an orphan, only to be denied on the grounds that George Witton had been dismissed with disgrace from the British armed forces.

In 1929, George Witton revealed in a letter to James Francis Thomas that Peter Handcock had confessed to murdering Rev. Daniel Heese on Morant&#x27;s orders shortly after they were both acquitted. At the time, Maj. Thomas was still unable to forgive himself for having failed to save Morant and Handcock&#x27;s lives and had continued battling for decades to prove his clients innocence and to keep the case in the public eye. Upon receiving Witton&#x27;s letter and realizing the degree to which his deceased clients had manipulated him, Maj. Thomas was, by all accounts, completely beside himself. 

Witton had a heart attack while cranking his car engine, and died in hospital on 14 August 1942, at the age of 68. He was buried with his first wife Mary in Brisbane&#x27;s Lutwyche Cemetery which, coincidentally, is located on the corner of Gympie and Kitchener Roads. His will indicated he was a retired estate agent, late of 41 Maling Road, Canterbury, Melbourne, Victoria, the executor being his nephew.

==2009 petitions for review of court martial ==
In 2009, an Australian lawyer and naval reservist, Commander Jim Unkles, submitted personal petitions, requesting a review of the convictions for Morant, Handcock and Witton, to The Crown, in the form of:
* Queen Elizabeth II personally
* the Australian government, in the form of the Australian House of Representatives Petitions Committee

The petitions committee considered Unkles&#x27; petition on 15 March 2010. He appeared before it, along with others including historian Craig Wilcox. Committee member Alex Hawke MP stated: &quot;there is in my view serious and compelling evidence that some form of redress should be given, all these years later, to those men executed by the British&quot;. The then Attorney-General of Australia, Robert McLelland referred the petition to the UK government.

On behalf of the Crown, Unkles&#x27; petition was rejected by UK Defence Secretary Liam Fox, in November 2010.

<doc id="1012964" wikidata="Q7420529" url="?curid=1012964" title="Blood Circus (film)">
<text>Blood Circus (also known as Blood Circus Wrestling) is a 1985 independent American science fiction-horror film about intergalactic professional wrestling. It was produced by Baltimore-native Santo Victor Rigatuso, also called Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Harris, who promoted it through infomercials for his mail-order &quot;Santo Gold&quot; jewelry business. Though it had a brief regional release funded by Rigatuso, the film never received distribution.

==Plot==
Aliens from the planet Zoran are sent to Earth to fight against professional wrestlers from the United States and the Soviet Union, but prove to actually be man-eaters who devour their opponents upon defeating them.

==Cast==
*Santo Victor Rigatuso as Santo Gold
*John Harris (III)
*Jerry Reese (as Voodoo Malumba)
*Vinnie Valentino

==Production==
Filming for &quot;Blood Circus&quot; began in 1985 on a purported budget of $2 million, largely financed by Rigatuso&#x27;s Credit Card Authorization Center business. This business offered customers with bad credit histories the opportunity to purchase a fake credit card for $50, with which they could only purchase exclusive &quot;Santo Gold&quot; jewelry (Rigatuso would later serve ten months in prison in 1989 for mail fraud in relationship to the enterprise).

One of the key moments in &quot;Blood Circus&quot; was filmed at the Baltimore Civic Center, where Rigatuso, playing a character called Santo Gold, performs a song before the climactic wrestling match. The song lyrics have nothing to do with the film; instead, the song promotes Rigatuso&#x27;s &quot;Santo Gold&quot; jewelry. Extras were paid $10 each to sit in arena and observe the action. Some of the &quot;Earth wrestlers&quot; were actual professional wrestlers from the San Antonio-based Southwest Championship Wrestling promotion, including Douglas “Ox” Baker, an experienced actor in his own right, Vinnie Valentino, and Eric Embry.

On June 5, 1985, it was reported in &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; that Rigatuso was planning to release a 30-minute documentary on the production and an album to promote the film.

==Release==
After spending two years editing the film, Rigatuso could not find a distributor for the &quot;Blood Circus&quot;; he ended up renting several theaters in the Baltimore area to show his film. It was shown for only a week, and took in far less than it cost to produce. The film was never shown to the public after it ended its initial run, and the original copy was believed to have been lost. Clips of &quot;Blood Circus&quot; can still be seen in portions of &quot;Santo Gold&quot; infomercials circulating on the Internet.

&quot;Scream bags&quot; were also provided to moviegoers as a promotional tie-in. The bags had a long poem about &quot;Blood Circus&quot; on each side, as well as a coupon for a free diamond ring from Rigatuso&#x27;s &quot;Santo Gold&quot; infomercials.

In 2008, Santo Gold claimed that the 35mm negatives of &quot;Blood Circus&quot; had finally been found, and that producers were being sought for its release.

<doc id="1012975" wikidata="Q378555" url="?curid=1012975" title="Gu Kaizhi">
<text>Gu Kaizhi (; c. 344–406), courtesy name Changkang (), was a Chinese painter and politician during the Eastern Jin dynasty (317–420). He was a celebrated painter of ancient China. He was born in Wuxi and first painted at Nanjing in 364. In 366, he became an officer (Da Sima Canjun or Assistant to the Minister of Defense, 大司馬參軍). Later he was promoted to royal officer (Sanji Changshi or Gentleman in Waiting to the Emperor, 散騎常侍). He was also a talented poet and calligrapher. He wrote three books about painting theory: &quot;On Painting&quot; (), &quot;Introduction of Famous Paintings of Wei and Jin Dynasties&quot; () and &quot;Painting Yuntai Mountain&quot; (). He wrote: &quot;In figure paintings the clothes and the appearances were not very important. The eyes were the spirit and the decisive factor.&quot;

Gu&#x27;s art is known today through copies of several silk handscroll paintings attributed to him.

==Biography==
Gu Kaizhi was born in Wuxi (in modern Jiangsu) where his father served in the imperial secretariat as an assistant. At about nineteen he was employed as aide to the Grand Marshal Huan Wen. He held a succession of minor official posts under various leaders of the Eastern Jin court.

One emperor under whom Gu Kaizhi served was Huan Xuan. An enthusiastic art collector, ahead of his accession Huan Xuan ordered a big boat to store paintings and other treasures so that they could be easily transported to safety in case of war. Gu Kaizhi entrusted to the emperor a sealed chest with his most precious works. The emperor broke open the box, stole the paintings, then repaired and returned it to the artist with the seals intact. Upon discovering his loss, Gu Kaizhi said that &quot;the marvelous works partook of divine power, transformed themselves and vanished, like men ascending to join the immortals.&quot;

==Works==

===&quot;The Admonitions of the Instructress to the Court Ladies&quot; (女史箴圖)===

This painting, dated between the 6th and 8th century AD—probably an early Tang dynasty copy—illustrates nine stories from a political satire about Empress Jia Nanfeng written by Zhang Hua (ca. 232–302). Beginning in the eighth century, many collectors and emperors left seals, poems, and comments on the scroll. The &quot;Admonitions&quot; scroll was stored in the emperor&#x27;s treasure until it was looted by the British army in the Boxer Uprising in 1900. Now it is in the British Museum collection, missing the first three scenes. There is another surviving copy of this painting, made during the Song dynasty and is now held in the Palace Museum in Beijing. The Song version is complete in twelve scenes.

The painting is on silk and is a polychrome. &quot;The figures, whose countenances are at once solemn and tranquil, are described with a thin, unmodulated brush-line... The brush-mode...has been described as &#x27;spring silkworms spitting silk&#x27;&quot;.


===&quot;Nymph of the Luo River&quot; (洛神賦)===
&quot;Nymph of the Luo River&quot; is a painting by Gu which illustrates a poem written by Cao Zhi (192–232). It survives in five copies dating to the Song and Ming dynasties. One copy is now held in the Palace Museum in Beijing, one copy in the National Palace Museum in Taipei and another one is now at the Freer Gallery in Washington, D.C. The third was brought to Manchuria by the last emperor Puyi (1906–1967) while he was the puppet emperor of Manchukuo under Japanese rule. When the Japanese surrendered in 1945 the painting disappeared. After ten years the Liaoning Province Museum recovered it. The fifth copy was bought by the British Museum in 1930 and is generally dated to the Ming Dynasty.



===&quot;Wise and Benevolent Women&quot; (列女仁智圖)===
&quot;Wise and Benevolent Women&quot; survives in a 13th-century copy dating to the Song dynasty, and is today located in the Palace Museum in Beijing. It illustrates a subset of the women described in the Han dynasty work &quot;Biographies of Exemplary Women&quot;. The 5-meter-long scroll is divided into 10 sections, with each section containing a short description.

<text>The Mexican Football Federation (), abbreviated as FMF is the official governing body of football in Mexico. It administers the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s national teams with all its youth teams, the national teams of futsal and beach soccer, the Liga MX with all its professional divisions, all affiliated amateur sectors, and controls promoting, organizing, directing, expanding, and supervising competitive football in Mexico. The FMF was established on August 23, 1927 to replace the &quot;Federación Central de Fútbol&quot; and its first president was Humberto Garza Ramos. It is an affiliate member of FIFA since 1929 and one of the founding members of CONCACAF since 1961. Subject to policies, statutes, objectives and ideals of those international governing bodies.
Its headquarters are located in Toluca, State of Mexico.

==History==
In 1919, the Mexican amateur league was divided into two leagues (Liga Mexicana and Liga Nacional). Due to the expulsion of Tigres México shortly before the start of the season, Real Club España and España Veracruz withdrew in solidarity and founded their own league. The separation of the leagues took place in the 1920–21 season. After only two seasons, in 1922 under the president Ulises Garza Ramos, the two leagues were unified to found the &quot;Federación Mexicana de Football Asociación&quot; and creating the &quot;Campeonato de Primera Fuerza&quot; which was the highest level of Mexican football at that time.
The following year it was renamed &quot;Federación Central de Fútbol&quot; due to its greater national influence, and it was its members who promoted the creation of Mexico&#x27;s first national team.

Finally in 1927 the current Federación Mexicana de Fútbol Asociación was reorganized and established. The Federation was renewed by the clubs: Club México, RC España, Necaxa, América, Asturias, Aurrerá and Germania, with the president Humberto Garza Ramos, the general secretary Juan B. Orraca and the treasurer Manuel Alonso who registered and affiliated the FMF with FIFA in 1929.
The first national championship endorsed and organized by the new FMF was held in the 1927–28 season still in the considered league&#x27;s amateur era until 1942.

The Federation has three operational centres: the Central Office, the High Performance Centre (, CAR) and the Training Centre (, CECAP).

==Structure==

The governing body of the Federation is the General Assembly that conforms with the participation of the Liga MX with 55% of the votes; Liga de Expansión MX with 5%; Liga Premier, with 18%; Liga TDP, with 13%, and the Amateur sector, with 9%. The executive and administrative body is the National Council, which comprises five members, one from each of the divisions mentioned, and are elected every four years.

==Criticism==
===Multi-team ownership issue===
The issue of multi-team ownership has been a highly debated one within the owners of the professional football clubs and the Femexfut. Of 33 clubs in the top two tiers, about a quarter of the teams are owned by three groups: Grupo Pachuca (Pachuca, León), Grupo Caliente (Tijuana, Querétaro, Dorados de Sinaloa) and Grupo Orlegi (Santos Laguna, Atlas). Of those groups that own more than one team, that ownership is usually split between the top two tiers of the league and act as a form of player development.

In May 2013, the Liga MX club owners approved banning a person or company from owning more than one team. The issue came to fore when rumor was that Carlos Slim, whose telecommunications company América Móvil owns a 30% stake in Grupo Pachuca, sought to acquire Guadalajara; he would refute the speculation. The ban applied to future acquisitions, not the then current team ownership, and did not require the sale of teams in excess of the one team limitation.

The issue reemerged in November 2013 when TV Azteca, owner of Monarcas Morelia, paid out 124 shareholders of Club Atlas US$50 million to acquire the club, which for years had been struggling financially.

==2026 World Cup Bid==

In September 2012, former Federación President Justino Compeán confirmed plans to bid. On 4 March 2016, Federación President Decio De Maria announced continued interest after the new FIFA president Gianni Infantino was elected in the wake of the Garcia Report corruption scandal. In April 2017, the Federación, with Canada and the United States, announced a joint bid to host the World Cup. It was awarded on 13 June 2018; 134 votes versus the Morocco bid by the Royal Moroccan Football Federation with 65 votes. Mexico will host 10 matches, Canada 3 matches, and the United States 60 matches in 10 cities including the final. The shortlist of match cities was selected in June 2022: Guadalajara, Mexico City, &amp; Monterrey.

<doc id="1012978" wikidata="Q608140" url="?curid=1012978" title="Whetstone (benchmark)">
<text>The Whetstone benchmark is a synthetic benchmark for evaluating the performance of computers. It was first written in ALGOL 60 in 1972 at the Technical Support Unit of the Department of Trade and Industry (later part of the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency) in the United Kingdom. It was derived from statistics on program behaviour gathered on the KDF9 computer at NPL National Physical Laboratory, using a modified version of its Whetstone ALGOL 60 compiler. The workload on the machine was represented as a set of frequencies of execution of the 124 instructions of the Whetstone Code. The Whetstone Compiler was built at the Atomic Power Division of the English Electric Company in Whetstone, Leicestershire, England, hence its name. Dr. B.A. Wichman at NPL produced a set of 42 simple ALGOL 60 statements, which in a suitable combination matched the execution statistics.

To make a more practical benchmark Harold Curnow of TSU wrote a program incorporating the 42 statements. This program worked in its ALGOL 60 version, but when translated into FORTRAN it was not executed correctly by the IBM optimizing compiler. Calculations whose results were not output were omitted. He then produced a set of program fragments which were more like real code and which collectively matched the original 124 Whetstone instructions. Timing this program gave a measure of the machine&#x27;s speed in thousands of Whetstone instructions per second (). The Fortran version became the first general purpose benchmark that set industry standards of computer system performance. Further development was carried out by Roy Longbottom, also of TSU/CCTA, who became the official design authority.

The Algol 60 program ran under the Whetstone compiler in July 2010, for the first time since the last KDF9 was shut down in 1980, but now executed by a KDF9 emulator.

== Benchmark content and enhancements ==

The benchmark employs 8 test procedures, with three executing standard floating point calculations, two with such as COS or EXP functions, one each for integer arithmetic, branching or memory assignments. Output from the original comprised parameters used for each test, numeric results produced and the overall KWIPS performance rating. In 1978, the program was updated to log running time of each of the tests, allowing MFLOPS (Millions of Floating Point Operations Per Second) to be included in reports, along with an estimation of Integer MIPS (Millions of Instructions Per Second). In 1987, MFLOPS calculations were included in the log for the three appropriate tests and MOPS (Millions of Operations Per Second) for the others. Code changes were also carried out, including by Bangor University, necessary to identify unexpected behaviour, without changing the implementation of the original 124 Whetstone instructions. One necessary change was to maintain measurement accuracy at increasing CPU speeds, with self calibration to run for a noticeable finite time, typically set for 10 seconds or 100 for early PCs with low timer resolution.

Note that there are other versions of the Whetstone Benchmark available online, some claiming copyright, without reference to CCTA or the design authority.

== Initial CCTA results ==

In conjunction with the undertaking controlled by the Contracts Division, CCTA engineers had responsibility to design and supervise acceptance trials 
of all UK Government computers and those for centrally funded for Universities and Research Councils, with systems varying from minicomputers to supercomputers. This provided the opportunity to gather verified Whetstone Benchmark results. Other results were obtained via new computer system appraisal activities.

CCTA records are now available in The UK National Archives, including technical reports. 
Original Whetstone Benchmark results are in the 1985 CCTA Technical Memorandum 1182, where overall speed is only shown as MWIPS. This contains more than 1000 results for 244 computers from 32 manufacturers, including the first for PCs and Supercomputers. The report might well be accessible from the Archive. The details were later included in a publicly available report (see Available Reports below).

== Vector processing version ==
Roy Longbottom converted the original Whetstone Benchmark to fully exploit capabilities of the new vector processors. Results were included in the paper “Performance of Multi-User Supercomputing Facilities” presented in the 1989 Fourth International Conference on Supercomputing, Santa Clara 
.

This was also repeated in the Harold Curnow paper “Whither Whetstone? The synthetic benchmark after 15 years” presented at the “Evaluating supercomputers: strategies for exploiting, evaluating and benchmarking computers with advanced architecture” conference in 1990, in book 

== Whetstone benchmark influences ==

Harold also reported comments from the 1989 conference “Software for Parallel Computers” in a presentation by Gordon Bell, designer of the Digital Equipment Corporation VAX range of minicomputers, indicating that the range was designed to perform well on the Whetstone Benchmark.

The Whetstone Benchmark also had high visibility concerning floating point performance of Intel CPUs and PCs, starting with the 1980 Intel 8087 coprocessor. This was reported in the 1986 Intel Application Report “High Speed Numerics with the 80186/80188 and 8087” 
The latter includes hardware functions for exponential, logarithmic or trigonometric calculations, as used in two of the eight Whetstone Benchmark tests, where these can dominate running time. Only two other benchmarks were included in the Intel procedures, showing huge gains over the earlier software based routines on all three programs.

Later tests, by a SSEMC Laboratory, evaluated Intel 80486 compatible CPU chips using their Universal Chip Analyzer 
Considering two floating point benchmarks, as used by Intel in the above report, they preferred Whetstone, stating “Whetstone utilizes the complete set of instructions available on early x87 FPUs”. This might suggest that the Whetstone Benchmark influenced the hardware instruction set.

By the 1990s the Whetstone Benchmark and results had become relatively popular. A notable quotation in 1985 was in “A portable seismic computing benchmark” quoting &quot;The only commonly used benchmark to my knowledge is the venerable Whetstone benchmark, designed many years ago to test floating point operations&quot; in the European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers Journal 

Details of the Vector Whetstone Benchmark performance were also repeated, by Roy Longbottom, at the June 1990 Advanced Computing Seminar at Natural Environment Research Council Wallingford. This led to Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils Distributed Computing Support collecting results from running “on a variety of machines, including vector supercomputers, minisupers, super-workstations and workstations, together with that obtained on a number of vector CPUs and on single nodes of various MPP machines “. More than 200 results are included, up to 2006, in the report available on the Wayback Machine Archive in entries to at least the year 2007 section 
The report also indicated “The wide variety of standard functions exercised (sqrt, exp, cos etc.) consume a far larger fraction of the reported times.”.

== The First 1 MIPS minicomputer and Dhrystone benchmark ==

On achieving 1 MWIPS, the Digital Equipment Corporation VAX-11/780 minicomputer became accepted as the first commercially available 32-bit computer to demonstrate 1 MIPS (Millions of Instructions Per Second), CERN 
not really appropriate for a benchmark dependent on floating point speed. This had an impact on the Dhrystone Benchmark, the second accepted general purpose computer performance measurement program, with no floating point calculations. This produced a result of 1757 Dhrystones Per Second on the VAX 11/780, leading to a revised measurement of 1 DMIPS, (AKA Vax MIPS), by dividing the original result by 1757.

== Later developments ==

Following retirement from CCTA, Roy Longbottom continued providing free benchmarking and stress testing programs available on his web site, latterly roylongbottom.org.uk, with most development using C (programming language), via Microsoft Windows and Linux based Operating Systems on PCs. This was initially in conjunction with the Compuserve Benchmarks and Standards Forum, see Wayback Machine Archive, 
covering PC hardware 1997 to 2008, providing numerous new benchmark results.

From 2008 to 2013 further PC results were collected privately. By then, PC processor operating clock speeds reached 4000 MHz and did not increase that much by the 2020s, reducing the need to gather results of the original scalar benchmark. In 2017 “Whetstone Benchmark History and Results” 
was published for public access, with identified year of first delivery and purchase prices were added, also doubling the number of computers covered in the CCTA report. The most notable citation for this was by Tony Voellm, then Google Cloud Performance Engineering Manager, entitled “Cloud Benchmarking: Fight the black hole” 
This considered available benchmarks and performance by time with detailed graphs, including those from the Whetstone reports. At a later stage, 504 of the results, by year, were included in the report “Techniques used for analyzing basic performance measurements” 

During this period, versions of the Whetstone Benchmark were produced to access Multithreading (computer architecture), initially for PCs running under Microsoft Windows, the latest supporting up to 8 CPUs or CPU cores particularly for those known as 4 core/8 thread varieties.

== Compiler and interpreter efficiency ==

The History report includes new sections for PC results, with CPUs from 1979, particularly those produced by up to 12 different compilers or interpreters, covering C/C++ ( up to 64 bit SSE level), Old Fortran, Basic and Java. These are based on the ratio MWIPS per MHz (multiplied by 100) to represent efficiency. Bottom line is one with a Core i7 CPU with ratings varying from 0.39, via the Basic Interpreter, to 311, via C, using 64 bit SSE options, then 1003 with the multithreading benchmarks, using all four CPU cores.

== Results with individual test performance ==

Another report “Whetstone Benchmark Detailed Later Results” 
was produced in 2017. 
This document provides a summary of speeds of the eight test loops in the benchmark, as MfLOPS or MOPS plus the MWIPS ratings. There are 22 pages of results covering the same Windows based PCs as the Historic file with different compilers and compiling options, some with multithreaded versions. Later results cover PCs using Linux. Then there are others for a sample of Android phones and tablets and, at the time, the full range of Raspberry Pi computers. For the latter, Roy Longbottom had been recruited as a voluntary member of Raspberry Pi Foundation new products Alpha Testing Team.

== Cray 1 supercomputer performance comparisons ==

Later scalar, vector and multithreading results were included in a 2022 report “Cray 1 Supercomputer Performance Comparisons With Home Computers Phones and Tablets” 
This included the following, originally in a report on the first Raspberry Pi computer:

&quot;In 1978, the Cray 1 supercomputer cost $7 Million, weighed 10,500 pounds and had a 115 kilowatt power supply. It was, by far, the fastest computer in the world. The Raspberry Pi costs around $70 (CPU board, case, power supply, SD card), weighs a few ounces, uses a 5 watt power supply and is more than 4.5 times faster than the Cray 1&quot;

This claim was based on the official average performance of the Livermore Loops Benchmark that was used to demonstrate that the first Cray 1 met the required contractual requirements. The scalar Whetstone Benchmark achieved a much higher gain of 16.7 times improvement.
The report includes comparisons with other supercomputers, a modern fairly fast laptop PC and the 2020 Raspberry Pi 400, where the latter obtained MWIPS gains over the Cray 1 of 155 times scalar, 38 vector and 593 scalar multithreading (4 CPU cores versus 1). The quad core laptop, using advanced SIMD compilations, obtained gains of 400, 215 and 3520 times respectively.

== Detailed Results, Source and Executable Codes ==

Whetstone Benchmark source codes, compiled programs and reports including results are currently (at the time of writing) on Roy Longbottom’s website roylongbottom.org.uk, but this has a limited lifetime.

For main reference purposes the HTML based reports were converted to PDF format and uploaded to ResearchGate. Brief descriptions of all files are included in an indexing file 
 (download via More v for menu choices). 
Unfortunately, the file structure was changed, disabling access to most older compressed files containing benchmark source codes and compiled programs.

The original website provides the same indexing format but includes the links 
to access both local files and those at ResearchGate, the former having options to download program codes. 

Presently, and hopefully for longtime future access, the website has been captured numerous times by the Wayback Machine Internet Archive site,

<text>Ciel, mon mardi ! was a television talk show hosted by Christophe Dechavanne, which ran on French television TF1 every Tuesday at the beginning of the 1990s.

The title literally means &quot;Heavens, it&#x27;s my Tuesday!&quot; but is also a wordplay on the more common &quot;Ciel, mon mari!&quot; expression, which means &quot;Heavens, it&#x27;s my husband!&quot;, which would have been uttered by a woman caught with another man by her husband.

Dechavanne invited groups of people who hated each other in real life to let them &quot;discuss&quot; their differences. For example, he would invite priests and homosexuals, Jewish groups and neo-Nazis, etc.

<doc id="1012996" wikidata="Q1151346" url="?curid=1012996" title="Helium-4">
<text>Helium-4 () is a stable isotope of the element helium. It is by far the more abundant of the two naturally occurring isotopes of helium, making up about 99.99986% of the helium on Earth. Its nucleus is identical to an alpha particle, and consists of two protons and two neutrons.

Helium-4 makes up about one quarter of the ordinary matter in the universe by mass, with almost all of the rest being hydrogen. While nuclear fusion in stars also produces helium-4, most of the helium-4 in the Sun and in the universe is thought to have been produced during the Big Bang, known as &quot;primordial helium&quot;. However, primordial helium-4 is largely absent from the Earth, having escaped during the high-temperature phase of Earth&#x27;s formation. On Earth, most naturally occurring helium-4 is produced by the alpha decay of heavy elements in the Earth&#x27;s crust, after the planet cooled and solidified.

When liquid helium-4 is cooled to below , it becomes a superfluid, with properties very different from those of an ordinary liquid. For example, if superfluid helium-4 is placed in an open vessel, a thin Rollin film will climb the sides of the vessel, causing the liquid to escape. The total spin of the helium-4 nucleus is an integer (zero), making it a boson. The superfluid behavior is a manifestation of Bose–Einstein condensation, which occurs only in collections of bosons. 

It is theorized that at 0.2 K and 50 atm, solid helium-4 may be a superglass (an amorphous solid exhibiting superfluidity).

==The helium-4 atom==

The helium atom is the second simplest atom (hydrogen is the simplest), but the extra electron introduces a third &quot;body&quot;, so its wave equation becomes a &quot;three-body problem&quot;, which has no analytic solution. However, numerical approximations of the equations of quantum mechanics have given a good estimate of the key atomic properties of , such as its size and ionization energy.

The size of the 4He nucleus has long been known to be in the order of magnitude of 1 fm. In an experiment involving the use of exotic helium atoms where an atomic electron was replaced by a muon, the nucleus size has been estimated to be 1.67824(83) fm.

==Stability of the 4He nucleus and electron shell==
The nucleus of the helium-4 atom has a type of stability called doubly magic. High-energy electron-scattering experiments show its charge to decrease exponentially from a maximum at a central point, exactly as does the charge density of helium&#x27;s own electron cloud. This symmetry reflects similar underlying physics: the pair of neutrons and the pair of protons in helium&#x27;s nucleus obey the same quantum mechanical rules as do helium&#x27;s pair of electrons (although the nuclear particles are subject to a different nuclear binding potential), so that all these fermions fully occupy 1s orbitals in pairs, none of them possessing orbital angular momentum, and each canceling the other&#x27;s intrinsic spin. Adding another of any of these particles would require angular momentum, and would release substantially less energy (in fact, no nucleus with five nucleons is stable). This arrangement is thus energetically extremely stable for all these particles, and this stability accounts for many crucial facts regarding helium in nature.

For example, the stability and low energy of the electron cloud of helium causes helium&#x27;s chemical inertness (the most extreme of all the elements), and also the lack of interaction of helium atoms with each other (producing the lowest melting and boiling points of all the elements).

In a similar way, the particular energetic stability of the helium-4 nucleus, produced by similar effects, accounts for the ease of helium-4 production in atomic reactions involving both heavy-particle emission and fusion. Some stable helium-3 is produced in fusion reactions from hydrogen, but it is a very small fraction, compared with the highly energetically favorable production of helium-4. The stability of helium-4 is the reason that hydrogen is converted to helium-4, and not deuterium (hydrogen-2) or helium-3 or other heavier elements during fusion reactions in the Sun. It is also partly responsible for the alpha particle being by far the most common type of baryonic particle to be ejected from an atomic nucleus; in other words, alpha decay is far more common than cluster decay.
The unusual stability of the helium-4 nucleus is also important cosmologically. It explains the fact that, in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, as the &quot;soup&quot; of free protons and neutrons which had initially been created in about a 6:1 ratio cooled to the point where nuclear binding was possible, almost all atomic nuclei to form were helium-4 nuclei. The binding of the nucleons in helium-4 is so tight that its production consumed nearly all the free neutrons in a few minutes, before they could beta decay, and left very few to form heavier atoms (especially lithium, beryllium, and boron). The energy of helium-4 nuclear binding per nucleon is stronger than in any of those elements (see nucleogenesis and binding energy), and thus no energetic &quot;drive&quot; was available to make elements 3, 4, and 5 once helium had been formed. It is barely energetically favorable for helium to fuse into the next element with a higher energy per nucleon (carbon). However, due to the rarity of intermediate elements, and extreme instability of beryllium-8 (the product when two 4He nuclei fuse), this process needs three helium nuclei striking each other nearly simultaneously (see triple-alpha process). There was thus no time for significant carbon to be formed in the few minutes after the Big Bang, before the early expanding universe cooled to the temperature and pressure where helium fusion to carbon was no longer possible. This left the early universe with a very similar hydrogen–helium ratio as is observed today (3 parts hydrogen to 1 part helium-4 by mass), with nearly all the neutrons in the universe trapped in helium-4.

All heavier elements—including those necessary for rocky planets like the Earth, and for carbon-based or other life—thus had to be produced, since the Big Bang, in stars which were hot enough to fuse elements heavier than hydrogen. All elements other than hydrogen and helium today account for only 2% of the mass of atomic matter in the universe. Helium-4, by contrast, makes up about 23% of the universe&#x27;s ordinary matter—nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen (1H).

<text>Darlene Joyce Zschech (; Steinhardt; 8 September 1965) is an Australian Pentecostal Christian worship leader and singer who primarily writes praise and worship songs. Described as a pioneer of the modern worship movement, she is the former worship pastor of Hillsong Church. Zschech is currently a contributing songwriter with CompassionArt, a charity founded by Christian songwriter Martin Smith. Along with her husband, Zschech is the lead pastor of Hope Unlimited Church in New South Wales.

==Early life==
Zschech starred on television at the age of ten, as part of an Australian children&#x27;s show, &quot;Happy Go Round&quot;. When she was 13, her parents divorced and the emotional stress of being on television and her parents&#x27; divorce resulted in her having bulimia for about four years.

In 1980, when Zschech was 15, her father rededicated his life to Christ and began taking her to church, where she also became a committed Christian and met her future husband, Mark Zschech. When they married, her husband suggested that they move from Brisbane to Sydney, which was confirmed at a small church they were visiting one Sunday when the guest speaker said in the middle of his sermon, &quot;This doesn&#x27;t happen to me very often, but whatever it is you two prayed last night, God says to do it now.&quot; They began attending Hills Christian Life Centre, which would become Hillsong Church.

Zschech sang jingles for several international companies including McDonald&#x27;s, KFC and Coca-Cola. 

===Career===

She released &quot;Make the Choice&quot; in 1987 and &quot;Pearls &amp; Gold&quot; in 1993. She eventually joined the staff of Hillsong Church after penning &quot;Shout to the Lord&quot; in 1993. When she presented it to Hillsong&#x27;s then-worship pastor, Geoff Bullock, she was so embarrassed that she requested he face away from her as she played and sang. It was first recorded on &quot;People Just Like Us&quot; and has appeared on more than 200 different albums by numerous artists in multiple languages. It is also the title track for the first live album co-produced with Integrity Music featuring Zschech as a worship leader. It was Integrity Music&#x27;s first album to feature a female worship leader. The album was nominated for Praise &amp; Worship Album of the Year at the 1997 Dove Awards. The song was nominated in the 1998 Dove Awards&#x27; Song of the Year category. It has been performed for the Pope at the Vatican and for the President of the United States. The song has become one of the most well-known modern worship songs, being sung by an estimated 25–30 million churchgoers every Sunday since the song&#x27;s release. She wrote the song during a time of personal struggle.

&quot;Shout to the Lord&quot;, the album, was nominated as Album of the Year for the 1997 Dove Awards and Song of the Year for the 1998 Dove Awards. In 2000, Zschech received a Dove Award nomination for Songwriter of the Year and received the International Award for influence in praise and worship.

Zschech was the worship pastor of Hillsong Church from 1996 to 2007, during which time she served as producer, vocal producer or executive producer for more than 20 albums under the Hillsong Music label and wrote more than 80 published worship songs. Under Zschech&#x27;s leadership, the album &quot;People Just Like Us&quot; (1994) was the first Christian album in Australia to be certified gold and platinum, and the album &quot;For All You&#x27;ve Done&quot; (2004) debuted at No. 1 on the Australian Record Industry Association album charts.

In 2003, Zschech released her first official solo album, &quot;Kiss of Heaven&quot;. &quot;Change Your World&quot; followed in 2005. She has since released two albums, in 2011, called &quot;Simply Darlene&quot; and &quot;You Are Love&quot;. In addition to writing songs, she has written five books: &quot;Worship&quot; (1996), &quot;Extravagant Worship&quot; (2002), &quot;The Kiss of Heaven&quot; (2003), &quot;The Great Generational Transition&quot; (2009) and &quot;Revealing Jesus: A 365-Day Devotional&quot; (2013).

In January 2011, with her husband, she became senior pastor of Hope Unlimited Church in New South Wales. Since becoming lead pastors there, Hope Unlimited has transitioned from being a local ministry to having a worldwide outreach with locations throughout Australia, India, and four major cities in the United States. The church also livestreams services through HopeUC.tv where the weekly services are also available on demand.

<doc id="1013002" wikidata="Q7883590" url="?curid=1013002" title="Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission Test">
<text>The Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission Test (UMAT ) was a test previously administered by the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) in Australia and New Zealand to assist in the selection of domestic students for health science courses, including most medical (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery) and dental degree programs, as well as other health science practical studies such as physiotherapy and optometry. The UMAT was used for domestic applicant selection into undergraduate courses only. Applicants for graduate medical education must take the Graduate Medical School Admissions Test, and foreign applicants must take the International Student Admissions Test. Each year, the UMAT was held on a single day in two sessions, morning and afternoon, typically in late July or early August at test centers in major cities in Australia and New Zealand, as well as a few other global cities.

The nature of the UMAT is different from typical high school examinations or university examinations. UMAT did not reliably predict academic performance in university medical programs. In addition, academic performance did not accurately predict whether the student would become a good doctor.

In 2019, the United Kingdom&#x27;s University Clinical Aptitude Test (UCAT) replaced the UMAT.

== History ==
Before the introduction of the UMAT as a component of university entrance requirements, the sole criterion for entry into medical or health science degrees in Australian universities was final year high school (Year 12) results. In New Zealand, entry was following completion of the first year of a related degree, with applicants selected based on their GPA for that year. A consortium of universities found this criterion too restrictive, as it did not reflect all the qualities required to successfully study and practice medicine. Consequently, the UMAT was introduced to assess the qualities deemed by ACER and the UMAT Consortium universities to be important to the study and practice of medicine and the health sciences. These qualities include: critical thinking and problem solving, ability to understand people, and abstract non-verbal reasoning. The first use of the UMAT was in 1991 for applicants to The University of Newcastle for selection into their medical program.

== Format ==
As of 2013, the UMAT consists of three multiple choice sections over a total of three hours:

# Section 1: Logical reasoning and problem solving (48 questions)
# Section 2: Understanding people (44 questions)
# Section 3: Non-verbal reasoning (42 questions)

It is important to note that as of 2013 each of these sections, whether in part or in full, can be completed in any order over the duration of the three hours.

A candidate&#x27;s UMAT score consists of three numbers, one raw score for each section of the test (this is not a percentage and the algorithms for their calculation have not been revealed by ACER), as well as a percentile ranking for each section. A final percentile and overall score (found usually by summing the three raw scores, but which can differ slightly due to each score&#x27;s decimal places which are not shown on the candidate&#x27;s statement of results) are given as part of the final results, and it is these final scores which are primarily used to determine the UMAT criteria for university admissions. For example, if a candidate was given the raw scores for Sections 1, 2, and 3 as 55, 60, 65 respectively, their overall score would be 179-181 and their percentile approximately 90.

As of 2012, all UMAT scores are valid for one year, this differs from the previous validity period of two years.

== Usage ==
The UMAT was an entry requirement for all UMAT Consortium universities, which constituted the vast majority of medical schools in Australia and New Zealand. Each university determined its own cut-off scores for UMAT results (based either on the &quot;raw&quot; section scores or section percentiles, depending on the university), obtained the results directly from ACER. Some universities, (for example, the University of Otago), also independently scaled each section of the UMAT in their selection process. In determining whether or not a candidate should be awarded a place, most universities also took into account a structured or semi-structured interview (such as a multiple mini interview) with the candidate, as well as Year 12 (Australia) or Year 13 (NCEA in New Zealand) results. Some universities, such as the University of Queensland, did not use interviews as part of the selection procedure.

==UMAT Consortium universities ==
The following universities were members of the UMAT Consortium:
* The University of Auckland 
* The University of Adelaide 
* Bond University 
* Charles Darwin University 
* Curtin University 
* Flinders University 
* La Trobe University 
* Monash University 
* The University of Newcastle/University of New England 
* The University of New South Wales 
* The University of Otago 
* The University of Queensland 
* The University of Tasmania 
* The University of Western Australia 
* The University of Western Sydney

==Controversy==
Due to its inclusion as a mandatory admission requirement into medical and health science courses, as well as the highly competitive nature of entry into such courses, there has been some controversy regarding the UMAT&#x27;s relevance, structure and necessity.
ACER do not release their marking and scaling procedures. As well as this there are a number of different test booklets, with many of the questions uniquely appearing in one. From other tests administered by ACER (e.g. the Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA), it is known that ACER likes a simple version of item response theory presumed to correct for varying item difficulties. The accuracy of this scaling is, however, disputed.

<text>William Huntington Russell (12 August 180919 May 1885) was an American businessman, educator, and politician. Notably, he was a co-founder of the Yale University secret society Skull and Bones, along with Alphonso Taft.

==Early life==
Russell was born in Middletown, Connecticut on 12 August 1809. He was the eighth of thirteen children born to Mary (née Huntington) Russell (1769–1857) and Matthew Talcott Russell (1761–1828), a Justice of the Peace who served as the State&#x27;s Attorney for Middlesex County and the treasurer of Middletown. Among his siblings were sisters Mary Huntington Russell and Harriet Russell (the wife of George Larned).

He was a descendant of several old New England families, including those of Huntington, Pierpont, Hooker, Willett, Bingham, and Russell. His ancestor, Rev. Noadiah Russell, was a founder and original trustee of Yale College. William&#x27;s older cousin, Samuel Russell, founded the successful merchant trading firm Russell &amp; Co. in 1823, but William was never associated with this firm.
Russell was a cadet at Alden Partridge&#x27;s American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy (later Norwich University) from 1826 until graduation in 1828, where he was taught under strict military discipline. In 1828, William&#x27;s father died. Despite being under severe financial restraints, he entered Yale College, graduating in 1833.

==Career==
Russell had planned on entering the ministry, but his financial problems forced him to obtain an immediate income through teaching. Therefore, from September 1833 to May 1835, he taught in Princeton, New Jersey before entering a tutorship at Yale. In September 1836, he opened a private prep school for boys in a small dwelling house. The school would become known as the New Haven Collegiate and Commercial Institute. Initially, the school was only attended by a small number of boys, but by the time of Russell&#x27;s death the school had become well known and had graduated around 4,000 boys. While running the Institute, Russell returned to Yale where was graduated from the Yale School of Medicine in 1838 with a M.D. degree.

In about 1840, Russell introduced a very thorough military drill and discipline into his school. He foresaw a Civil War in the future, and wanted to make sure his boys were prepared to fight for the Union. His students were so well schooled in military affairs that on the outbreak of the Civil War some were enlisted as drill instructors. He also served on the Board of Visitors appointed by the Secretary of War in 1863 to inspect and produce a report on West Point. Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry Barnard also served on this committee.

He not only gave his students to the Union army, but also his own services. Governor William Alfred Buckingham realized that Russell was one of the most knowledgeable men in military affairs. For this reason, Russell was hired to organize the Connecticut militia. He was later made a major-general by act of the legislature in April 1862.

===Political career===
From 1846 to 1847, Russell served as a Whig in the Connecticut state legislature, representing New Haven. Upon the repeal of the Missouri Compromise in 1854, he became active as one of the leaders of the movement which resulted in the organization of the Republican Party. Russell served as Collector of Internal Revenue for New Haven and Middlesex Counties from December 1868 to 1873.

He was a strong abolitionist and a friend of John Brown. Russell was named as a trustee in the will of John Brown. He was also the Connecticut representative on the National Kansas Committee.

==Later life==
In 1856, with several other Bonesmen, he incorporated Skull and Bones as the Russell Trust, later the Russell Trust Association. The Russell Trust Association is a tax-exempt association; it holds possession of the Skull and Bones Hall at Yale University and the society&#x27;s holiday island, Deer Island.

==Personal life==
On 19 August 1836, Russell was married to Mary Elizabeth Hubbard (1816–1890). Mary was a daughter of Lucy Hubbard and Dr. Thomas Hubbard, a professor of Surgery at the Yale Medical School. Together, they were the parents of ten children, six of whom survived him, including:

* Frances Harriet Russell (1839–1889)
* Talcott Huntington Russell (1847–1917), a lawyer who married Geraldine Whittemore Low.
* Thomas Hubbard Russell (1851–1916), a doctor who married Mary Katie Munson.
* Philip Gray Russell (1854–1900), who married Lilean Kendall, a daughter of John Edward Kendall.
* Edward Hubbard Russell (1855–1928)
* Robert Gray Russell (1860–1881)

In May 1885, Russell saw some boys throwing stones at birds in the park in New Haven, Connecticut. Russell sought to protect the birds from the boys. The activity was too much for him and he fell unconscious from a fatal rupture of a blood vessel and died several days later.

<text>The Abrams Air Craft Corporation was an aircraft manufacturer established in Lansing, Michigan, USA, in 1937 as an offshoot of Talbert Abrams&#x27; Aerial Survey Corporation. Abrams had founded an airline (ABC Airline) in 1929 but found himself increasingly interested in aerial photography.
The new company was created for the purpose of designing and producing a dedicated survey aircraft. The result was the P-1 Explorer, designed by Abrams with assistance from Kenneth Ronan of Ronan &amp; Kunzl.

World War II interrupted further work.

<text>Peguero Jean Philippe (born 29 September 1981), also known as Jean Philippe Peguero is a Haitian former professional footballer who played as a forward.

==Club career==
Peguero began his career with Haitian club Don Bosco FC, with whom he won the 2003 haitian League, and was named MVP and received the Golden Boot Award with 13 goals. He moved to Major League Soccer in March 2004 to play for Colorado Rapids. Peguero finished his first season with the Rapids with seven goals and four assists in 18 games. In his second season, he scored seven goals and had six assists before the Rapids traded Peguero to New York Red Bulls in April 2006 for Thiago Martins The deal also included the Red Bulls sending to the Rapids first-round and third-round picks in the 2007 MLS SuperDraft. Peguero scored six goals in 12 games for New York, in addition to two goals in a friendly match against German team Bayern Munich.

In July 2006, Peguero transferred to Danish Superliga club Brøndby IF. On 5 August 2006, he scored a goal in his debut for Brøndby; the third goal in a 3–0 win over AC Horsens. In his third league game for Brøndby, against Viborg FF on 20 August, Peguero ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament in his right knee as he scored Brøndby&#x27;s third goal in the 3–0 win. It was estimated that his recovery would last seven to eight months, but Peguero would play no more games for Brøndby.

On 15 April 2008, Peguero briefly joined the San Jose Earthquakes on loan from Brøndby, but persistent problems with his knee forced an early end to the loan.

After over two years out of the game, Peguero resumed his career when he signed with Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the North American Soccer League in April 2011.

In 2012, he returned to the Haitian club Don Bosco FC, his first club.

In March 2015, Peguero signed with Moca FC in the Dominican Republic. He later joined Real Hope FA before retiring from professional football.

==International career==
Peguero played nine games and scored seven goals for the Haiti national under-23 team. He made his full debut for the Haitian national team in a July 2003 friendly match against St Kitts &amp; Nevis.

In March 2009, Peguero made a comeback for the national team, playing the last 16 minutes of a 4–0 friendly match loss to Panama. He was on the squad for the 2–2 draw against Jamaica, but did not play.

<doc id="1013048" wikidata="Q5905282" url="?curid=1013048" title="Horrorscope (Eve 6 album)">
<text>Horrorscope is the second studio album by American rock band Eve 6. It was recorded at NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood, California. The album was influenced by Lit&#x27;s &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; (1999). It was released on July 25, 2000, through RCA Records. The neologism &quot;Horrorscope&quot; is not actually used within the album&#x27;s lyrics; though the chorus of &quot;Sunset Strip Bitch&quot; contains the proper word &quot;horoscope.&quot;

==Singles==
The first single, &quot;Promise&quot;, was a hit on alternative rock radio, reaching #3 on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart and #25 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Around this time, &quot;On the Roof Again&quot; made it to #19 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The follow-up single, &quot;Here&#x27;s to the Night&quot; was a major mainstream hit in 2001, reaching #30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Here&#x27;s to the Night&quot; became a hit at senior proms and graduation parties.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Horrorscope&quot; was met with &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an average score of 53 based on 10 reviews.

In a review for AllMusic, critic reviewer MacKenzie Wilson said: &quot;It&#x27;s another conventional rock record with thrashing guitar hooks and throbbing basslines firmly in place, but frontman Max Collins has lyrically improved. There isn&#x27;t anything intellectually impressive and the hyperactive little boy excitement is still present, but a lush sweet side also shines through the album.&quot; David Hiltbrand of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote &quot;the band&#x27;s music and lyrics often still sound labored.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
The album was certified Gold by the RIAA in the U.S., and also by the CRIA in Canada in 2001.

==Track listing==

==Personnel==
*Max Collins – bass, lead vocals
*Jon Siebels – guitar, backing vocals
*Tony Fagenson – drums
Additional
*David Campbell – String arrangements on &quot;Here&#x27;s to the Night&quot;

<doc id="1013062" wikidata="Q294718" url="?curid=1013062" title="Roberto Donadoni">
<text>Roberto Donadoni (; born 9 September 1963) is an Italian football manager and former midfielder.

A skilful and versatile winger, Donadoni was capable of playing on either flank, or in the centre. He began his career with Atalanta, and later he became a pillar of the powerhouse AC Milan team of the late 1980s and early 1990s, achieving domestic and international success during his time with the club. In his later career, he was also one of the pioneers of Major League Soccer, where he played two seasons for the NY/NJ MetroStars, before ending his career with Saudi Premier League side Ittihad in 2000.

At international level, Donadoni was also an important member of the Italy national team throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s. He represented his country at the 1988 and 1996 European Championships, and at the 1990 and 1994 FIFA World Cups. With Italy, he reached the semi-finals of Euro 1988, and won bronze and silver medals at the 1990 and 1994 World Cups respectively, earning 63 caps and scoring five goals over a decade.

Following his playing career, Donadoni began a career as a manager in 2001, which included spells with Italian clubs Lecco, Livorno and Genoa. He was later appointed head coach of the Italy national team, succeeding Marcello Lippi, who resigned after having won the 2006 World Cup. At Euro 2008, with Donadoni as coach, Italy reached the quarter-finals of the tournament, losing to eventual champions Spain on penalties. On 26 June 2008, Donadoni was dismissed despite having signed a contract extension prior to the beginning of Euro 2008, using a clause in the contract which allowed termination if Italy did not reach the semi-final. He was replaced by Lippi, who returned as national team manager. Following his position as Italy head coach, Donadoni managed Napoli, Cagliari and Parma, until the latter club&#x27;s bankruptcy in 2015. He then joined Bologna the following season.

==Club career==
===Atalanta and AC Milan===
Donadoni started his career with Atalanta in 1982, winning the Serie C1 title, and the Serie B title in 1984. He joined AC Milan in 1986 and he became a mainstay in the legendary team that dominated Italy and Europe in the late 1980s and early-to-mid-1990s. Usually playing a right-sided wide midfield role, Donadoni was a vital part of Milan&#x27;s squad under both Arrigo Sacchi and Fabio Capello, winning six Serie A titles, three European Cups, four Supercoppa Italiana, three European Super Cups, and two Intercontinental Cups during his time at Milan. Although Donadoni failed to win the Coppa Italia with Milan, he reached the final twice, during the 1989–90 and 1997–98 seasons.

Donadoni was knocked unconscious and suffered a broken jaw after a violent tackle from Goran Vasilijević in the 1988–89 European Cup campaign in a match against Red Star Belgrade. He required treatment on the pitch to stop him choking and was rushed to hospital, where he regained consciousness soon after. On 19 April 1989, he scored a goal in a 5–0 win over Real Madrid in the 1989 European Cup semi-finals. In the final of the European Cup, he assisted Gullit&#x27;s goal in a 4–0 win over Steaua București.

He provided the assist for Daniele Massaro&#x27;s goal in a 4–0 victory over Barcelona in the final of the UEFA Champions League.

===MetroStars===
After winning his fifth Serie A title with Milan, he went on to play in Major League Soccer (MLS) in the United States. The NY/NJ MetroStars of MLS made him a centerpiece of their franchise when they signed him in 1996. During his first year with the Metros, he was recalled to the Italy national team. He proved a solid performer, being named to the league Best XI in 1996, and was also named an MLS Eastern Conference All-Star, winning the inaugural 1996 MLS All-Star Game 3–2 over the Western Conference MLS All-Stars. Unfortunately, Donadoni&#x27;s play could not bring the MetroStars any success as a club. In total, Donadoni scored six goals for the MetroStars.

===Second spell at Milan and final season with Al-Ittihad===
Donadoni briefly rejoined Milan after the 1997 MLS season, helping lead them to another Coppa Italia final in 1998 during Fabio Capello&#x27;s second spell with the club. He also won another Serie A title under Alberto Zaccheroni in 1999, his sixth and final career Serie A title. In total, Donadoni scored 18 career Serie A goals for Milan in 287 appearances, and 23 in 390 appearances throughout all competitions.

He ended his career by playing for a short time with Al-Ittihad of Saudi Arabia, winning the Saudi Premier League during the 1999–2000 season, and officially retiring from professional football soon after.

==International career==
===Youth career, senior debut, Euro 88, and 1990 World Cup===
A member of the Italy under-21 national football team, reaching the final of the 1986 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, Donadoni made his Italy national team senior debut on 8 October 1986, under Azeglio Vicini in a 2–0 victory over Greece. He soon became a key member of his national side, reaching the semi-finals of Euro 1988, and he subsequently played in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, on home soil, helping Italy to a third place finish. Unfortunately, he missed one of the penalties in the fateful semi-final shoot-out against defending champions and eventual runners-up Argentina. Overall, he made five appearances throughout the tournament, missing out on the round of 16 victory against Uruguay due to injury, and the bronze medal match victory against England.

===1994 World Cup and Euro 96===
Donadoni also took part at the 1994 World Cup, under Arrigo Sacchi, helping Italy to a second-place finish, where Italy would once again be defeated on penalties, by Brazil. However, on this occasion Donadoni did not take a penalty in the final shoot-out. En route to the final, he set up Dino Baggio&#x27;s goal in Italy&#x27;s 2–1 quarter-final victory over Spain, and also provided the throw-in on the left flank from which Roberto Baggio scored his first goal in Italy&#x27;s 2–1 over Bulgaria in the semi-finals of the tournament. He also represented Italy at Euro 1996, which would be his final international tournament prior to his international retirement, appearing in all three group matches. His final appearance for Italy was on 19 June 1996, in the final group match, which ended in a 0–0 draw against the eventual champions Germany, eliminating the Italians in the first round of the tournament. Overall, Donadoni made 63 appearances for Italy, scoring five goals.

==Style of play==
Regarded as one of Italy&#x27;s greatest ever wingers, Donadoni was a consistent, versatile, and talented player, who was capable of playing anywhere in midfield except for defensive midfield. Due to his versatility, he could play on either wing, through the centre, or as an attacking midfielder, although he was most frequently deployed on the right flank. He was an important member of his club and national sides throughout his career, standing out for his explosive pace, agility, dribbling skills, and technical ability; he often beat players with feints both in one on one situations, or when undertaking individual runs. He was also known for his stamina and tactical intelligence, which enabled him to function as a box-to-box player. Particularly in his later career he operated in a more creative midfield role as a playmaker, due to his ability to orchestrate attacking moves for his team with his vision and passing. Donadoni was capable of delivering assists to teammates in the area from curling crosses or set-pieces. He was also a powerful and accurate striker of the ball from distance with either foot, despite being naturally right-footed, and an effective free kick taker. Michel Platini described him as Italy&#x27;s greatest player of the 1990s. Regarding his playing style, Donadoni once commented &quot;My greatest satisfaction comes from making the pass that leads to the goal.&quot;

==Managerial career==
===Early club career: Lecco, Livorno, and Genoa===
After retiring as a player, Donadoni trained to become a coach. His first job was as Lecco and he made his debut on 12 August 2001 in the Coppa Italia Lega Pro. This was followed by jobs with Livorno (2002–03) and Genoa (2003). In 2005, he returned to head Livorno in mid-season. After leading them to a surprising ninth-place finish and having the club in sixth place midway through the 2005–06 season, Donadoni resigned over criticism from club chairman Aldo Spinelli.

===International career===
In July 2006, following the resignation of Marcello Lippi three days after the Italy national team won the 2006 World Cup, Donadoni was named as new Italian head coach, his first task being to successfully lead Italy through qualification for UEFA Euro 2008.

On 16 August, Donadoni made his Italy head coaching debut in a friendly match against Croatia played at Stadio Armando Picchi, Livorno, which did not feature any of the 23 world champions, save for third goalkeeper Marco Amelia, and ended in a 2–0 defeat. Donadoni took solace in the fact Lippi&#x27;s first match in charge of the &quot;Azzurri&quot; was also a friendly defeat, to Iceland.

====Path to Euro 2008====
Donadoni&#x27;s competitive debut came in Euro 2008 qualifying. Italy drew its first match 1–1 with Lithuania, then lost 3–1 to France. Accordingly, Italian newspaper &quot;La Nazione&quot;&#x27;s front page featured, &quot;How to reduce Lippi&#x27;s masterwork to pieces in just three weeks,&quot; requesting the return of Lippi. However, despite all the critics, Donadoni led Italy to five consecutive wins to Georgia (3–1), Ukraine (2–0) and Scotland (2–0), the former being controversial for his omission of star Alessandro Del Piero from the squad. One of the main criticisms addressed by the media towards Donadoni was his alleged lack of pressure in persuading Francesco Totti to play again for the &quot;Azzurri&quot;. Following a question regarding a possible call-up for the Roma player, Donadoni jokingly claimed not to know him.

Italy qualified for Euro 2008 after a successful campaign, topping the group ahead of France, in spite of the shaky start. They defeated Scotland 2–1 in Glasgow to confirm their qualification.

====Euro 2008 campaign====
On 9 June 2008, Donadoni was handed the biggest defeat for Italy&#x27;s national team in over 25 years by former Milan teammate Marco van Basten, a 3–0 loss to the Netherlands. Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro was unable to play due to injury, and Donadoni was widely criticised for his choice of players for the match. His team drew the subsequent match with Romania on 13 June, despite some controversial officiating which saw a goal called back in each of these games creating intense criticism of the officials. The team then beat France 2–0 on 17 June to progress to the quarter-finals against much-fancied Spain, the eventual champions. The two teams played out a 0–0 draw, the only match Spain was held scoreless in regular time throughout the tournament. However, the Spaniards won 4–2 on penalties.

After Italy&#x27;s disappointing performance at the tournament, on 26 June 2008 Donadoni was sacked by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC), which named Lippi as his replacement.

===Post-international club coaching career===
====Napoli====
On 10 March 2009, Napoli announced it had appointed Donadoni as its new head coach following the termination of Edoardo Reja after five years leading the club. Donadoni&#x27;s first match in charge was a 1–1 draw with Reggina.

After a 2–1 loss to Roma on 6 October 2009, Donadoni was terminated as Napoli manager. He was replaced by former Sampdoria coach Walter Mazzarri.

====Cagliari====
On 16 November 2010, it was announced Donadoni would become head coach of Serie A relegation battlers Cagliari, replacing Pierpaolo Bisoli. After joining Cagliari, the club won its next two matches, 2–1 against Brescia on 21 November and 3–2 against Lecce on 28 November.

However, on 12 August 2011, two weeks prior to the start of the 2011–12 Serie A, Donadoni was surprisingly sacked by Cagliari chairman Massimo Cellino. Italian press sources cited divergencies between Donadoni and Cellino regarding the sale of Alessandro Matri to Juventus and the affair involving David Suazo, who first joined the pre-season training camp only to be asked to leave days later.

Donadoni was in talks with Iran Pro League side Persepolis in December 2011. However, no contract was reached.

====Parma====
On 9 January 2012, Donadoni was unveiled as head coach of Serie A club Parma, replacing Franco Colomba. Upon arriving at the club, the situation in the league table was critical for Parma, being close to the relegation zone.

Parma&#x27;s results improved immediately under Donadoni, winning seven Serie A matches in a row, a club record. Parma would finish the season in eighth place in the league table, equal on points with seventh-placed Roma.

Donadoni&#x27;s initial contract ran until 2013, but this was extended by two years in October 2012, the longest deal club president Tommaso Ghirardi had made with a head coach. At the end of the 2012–13 season, Parma impressed and finished in a comfortable tenth place, despite initial fears it would be relegated. In 2014, Donadoni guided Parma to sixth place in Serie A, helping the club to qualify for the UEFA Europa League for the first time since 2007. However, their entry to the tournament was barred because of the late payment of income tax on salaries, failing to qualify for a UEFA license, for which the club would also be docked seven points during the 2014–15 Serie A season.

The following season, Parma&#x27;s continuing severe financial difficulties led to the club&#x27;s eventual bankruptcy in March 2015, which meant the club be relegated. Although the FIGC allowed the club to complete the league season in Serie A, they finished bottom of the league in 20th place. Donadoni, who reported that he, as well as the Parma staff and players, had not received wages since July 2014, left the club at the end of the season.

====Bologna====
In October 2015, Donadoni was hired by newly promoted Serie A club Bologna as the club&#x27;s new coach, replacing Delio Rossi. Donadoni parted with Bologna on 24 May 2018.

====Shenzhen====
On 30 July 2019, Donadoni was appointed as manager of Chinese club Shenzhen.

<text>Earnest Lee Stewart Jr. (born March 28, 1969) is an American former soccer player who played as a forward or midfielder. His career spanned 17 years from 1988 until his retirement in 2005, with the majority of the years spent in the Netherlands, the country of his birth. Stewart also represented the United States in international soccer.

Since his retirement from professional soccer, Stewart has served as a soccer executive in various positions for multiple organizations. He is currently the director of football for PSV Eindhoven.

In 2011, Stewart was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

==Early life and education==
Earnie Stewart is the son of U.S. Air Force airman Earnie Stewart Sr. and his wife Annemien, Stewart grew up in Uden, Netherlands.

==Playing career==
Stewart began his professional career in the Netherlands in 1988 with VVV-Venlo. By the end of 1990, he made his first appearance for the United States national team against Portugal.

In his first season at Willem II, he finished third on the goal-scoring list for the Dutch First Division with 17. He went on to score 49 goals in six seasons there. In the meantime, he became a regular for the United States national team, starting all four games that the United States played in the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Most notably, he scored the goal that gave the United States its winning margin against Colombia in the group stage, the first World Cup game won by the United States since 1950.

By 1996, Stewart had moved to NAC Breda, eventually spending more than six seasons there. NAC was relegated in 1999, but Stewart helped the club win the First Division in 2000, thereby earning promotion back to the Eredivisie. During his years at NAC, he also played in all of the United States team&#x27;s matches at the 1998 and 2002 FIFA World Cups, becoming one of only five American men to play at three World Cups.

In January 2003, he left the Netherlands to play in Major League Soccer, and was allocated to D.C. United, where he won the MLS Cup in his second season. His scoring numbers did not equal his earlier high standards, as he tallied just four regular season goals and one playoff goal in MLS. He left D.C. after the 2004 season, coming back to the Netherlands and his original club, VVV-Venlo, where he became technical director following his retirement in 2005.

Stewart became the eighth American man to make his 100th international appearance in a 2004 World Cup qualifier against Grenada. His 111 goals as a professional in the Netherlands makes him the highest-scoring American in international club play. He was named U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year in 2001.

==Post-playing career==
On May 14, 2006, Earnie Stewart was named technical director of NAC Breda.

He was appointed as AZ Alkmaar&#x27;s director of football affairs in June 2010. The 41-year-old succeeded Marcel Brands, who left AZ for PSV. Stewart left his post as technical director at NAC Breda by mutual consent.

One of Stewart&#x27;s long-term goals was to return to the United States as a soccer executive: &quot;One ambition I do have is to go back to the United States and to be of importance to soccer.&quot;

Stewart accomplished that goal on October 26, 2015, when the Philadelphia Union officially announced that Stewart would take on the role of sporting director for the club.

On June 6, 2018, Stewart was named general manager of the United States men&#x27;s national team.

On August 12, 2019, Stewart was promoted to the position of sporting director of the United States Soccer Federation.

On January 26, 2023, the U.S. Soccer Federation announced that Stewart would be departing and would be joining PSV as the new technical director for the club. Stewart remained with U.S. Soccer until February 15, 2023, to assist with a smooth transition to the next sporting director.

<text>Talbert &quot;Ted&quot; Abrams (August 17, 1895 – August 25, 1990) was an American photographer and aviator known as the &quot;father of aerial photography&quot;.

==Early years==
Born in Tekonsha, Michigan, Abrams learned to fly at the Curtiss Aviation School while working as a mechanic for Curtiss. He was issued Fédération Aéronautique Internationale pilot&#x27;s license number 282. The certificate was signed by Orville Wright.

He joined the US Marine Corps in 1917 and was assigned to the US Navy flying school at Pensacola. Following World War I, his squadron took photos of rebel activities on Haiti, and Abrams became interested in the potential of aerial photography.

==Career==
In 1920, he left the military, purchased a war-surplus Curtiss JN-4 and founded a small airline, ABC Airline (Always Be Careful!), but remained more interested in photographic work. On January 17, 1923, he married Leota Pearl Fry. The same year, he purchased a Standard J-1, fitted it with cameras, and founded the Abrams Aerial Survey Corporation (sold to Aerocon in 2003). Over the next few years, he formed the Abrams Instrument Corporation to develop better cameras and instruments for his work, and the Abrams Aircraft Corporation in 1937 to develop specially designed aircraft.

He got his first income from aerial photography when he took a photo of a racetrack from his biplane for a newspaper. Later he used stereo-plotters to make maps for highway design and construction projects. In 1937 he developed a novel form of aircraft called &quot;The Explorer&quot;, which was the first aircraft designed exclusively for aerial photography.

During World War II, he founded the Abrams School of Aerial Surveying and Photo Interpretation to teach these skills to the US military, while his Instrument Corporation built reconnaissance cameras for aircraft.

In 1961, he sold the Abrams Instrument Corporation to Curtiss-Wright and went into semi-retirement.

In 1962 Abrams and his wife made a large donation to Michigan State University in order to fund the construction of a planetarium, which was then named in their honor.

He died in a nursing home in Lansing, Michigan on August 26, 1990, at the age of 95.

==Legacy==
Every year, the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) presents the Talbert Abrams Award to a person who makes an outstanding contribution to aerial photography and mapping. Mount Abrams in the Antarctic is named after him, as is the Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University.

&quot;For his participation in &quot;Operation Deep Freeze&quot; at the South Pole in the 1960s he became one of the few persons in the world to have a mountain named after him, besides being awarded the Antarctic Service Medal.&quot;

<text>Wire Train was a San Francisco-based alternative rock band, who released six albums in the 1980s and 1990s.

==History==
The band was formed in 1982 as the Renegades by two students from San Francisco State University, Kevin Hunter and Kurt Herr. Their rhythm section eventually stabilized with fellow students Federico Gil Solá (from Argentina) and Anders Rundblad (from Sweden). When they had to change their name, the band became Wire Train in 1983. The band&#x27;s first album features Anders Rundblad (bass guitar, vocals), Federico Gil Solá (drums), Kevin Hunter (vocals, guitar), and Kurt Herr (vocals, guitar). Rundblad had previously played with the Swedish bands Motvind and Gary T&#x27;To Band.

In June 1983, Wire Train signed to the local 415 Records label, also home to acts like Translator, Red Rockers and Romeo Void, all of which found themselves with national distribution when 415 entered into a deal with Columbia Records.

Wire Train&#x27;s debut, &quot;In a Chamber,&quot; produced by David Kahne at The Automatt in San Francisco, was released late in 1983. It achieved success on the U.S. college charts during 1984, and the band toured as openers for Big Country.

Brian MacLeod replaced Gil Solá prior to their second album, &quot;Between Two Words,&quot; and Herr left during its recording, replaced by Jeff Trott (ex-the Lifers). The album, produced in Vienna by Peter Maunu, was released in 1985. The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Ten Women&quot;, was recorded by Tim Palmer at Utopia studios in London and released in 1987. Ten Women featured a guest appearance by the Alarm guitarist Dave Sharp on &quot;Breakwater Days&quot; and had its first single &quot;She Comes On&quot; banned by the BBC.

After a 1987 European tour, the band went on a two-year hiatus, extricating themselves from their contract with Columbia. Trott played with World Party. and McLeod with Toy Matinee.

&quot;Wire Train&quot; (1990) and &quot;No Soul No Strain&quot; (1992) were issued by MCA Records. The latter, produced by Bill Bottrell, was their fourth album to chart, peaking at No. 43 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In 1993, MCA rejected their next effort, &quot;Snug,&quot; as &quot;too weird&quot;. It was released digitally in April 2009.

In 1996, Columbia released a compilation CD, &quot;Last Perfect Thing... A Retrospective&quot;. The first pressings mistakenly included an uncredited &quot;Half a Lifetime&quot;, substituted on later pressings with the correct track, &quot;Last Perfect Thing&quot;.

In 2003, the band reunited for an episode of VH1&#x27;s Band Reunited, but it was never aired.

In 2009, Hunter, MacLeod, Trott and Rundblad reunited again for a three-gig tour in California, in part, to commemorate the digital release of &quot;Snug.&quot; According to Hunter another collection of songs was recorded concurrently with &quot;Snug&quot; under the working title of &quot;Electric&quot;. No new album has been released at this time.

<doc id="1013081" wikidata="Q1712347" url="?curid=1013081" title="Willie Brown (musician)">
<text>Willie Lee Brown (1899 or August 6, 1900 – December 30, 1952) was an American blues guitar player and vocalist. He performed and recorded with other blues musicians, including Son House and Charlie Patton, and influenced Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters. Brown is considered one of the pioneering musicians of the Delta blues genre.

Brown worked as a side player, performing mostly with House, Patton, and Johnson. He recorded six sides for Paramount Records in Grafton, Wisconsin in 1930, which were subsequently released on 78-rpm discs. He made three recordings for the Library of Congress in 1941, accompanied by House. In 1952, Brown briefly joined House in Rochester, New York, but soon returned to Tunica, Mississippi, where he died the same year.

Although normally an accompanist, Brown recorded three highly rated solo performances: &quot;M &amp; O Blues&quot;, &quot;Make Me a Pallet on the Floor&quot; and &quot;Future Blues&quot;. He disappeared from the music scene during the 1940s, together with House, and died before the blues revival of the 1960s.

== Life and career ==
He learned to play the guitar as a teenager. He played with such notables as Charley Patton, Son House and Robert Johnson. He was not a self-promoting frontman, preferring to &quot;second&quot; other musicians. Little is known for certain about the man whom Johnson called &quot;my friend Willie Brown&quot; (in his &quot;Cross Road Blues&quot;) and whom Johnson once indicated should be notified in event of his death.

Brown played with Patton on &quot;M &amp; O Blues&quot; and &quot;Future Blues&quot;, recorded for Paramount Records in 1930. Both songs appear on the album &quot;Son House &amp; the Great Delta Blues Singers 1928–1930&quot; (Document Records, 1994) and are also included in the JSP box set of Patton&#x27;s recordings. At least four other songs Brown recorded for Paramount have never been found.

There has been speculation and some dispute about whether Brown played backup on &quot;Rowdy Blues&quot;, and &quot;Mississippi Bottom Blues&quot;, 1929 songs credited to Kid Bailey, or recorded it himself using the name of Kid Bailey.

The musicologist David Evans reconstructed the early biography of a Willie Brown living in Drew, Mississippi, until 1929. He was married by 1911, when he was 10 or 11(?), to a proficient guitarist named Josie Mills. He is recalled as singing and playing guitar with Patton and others in the neighborhood of Drew. Informants with conflicting memories led Gayle Dean Wardlow and Steve Calt to conclude that this was a different Willie Brown. Evans rejected this conclusion, believing that the singing and guitar style of the 1931 recordings is in the tradition of other performers from Drew, such as Patton, Tommy Johnson, Kid Bailey, Howlin&#x27; Wolf and artists not commercially recorded.

Alan Lomax, writing in 1993, suggested that the William Brown he recorded in Arkansas in 1942 was the same man as the Paramount artist. The recording was for a joint project between Fisk University and the Library of Congress documenting the music of Coahoma County, Mississippi, in 1941 and 1942. Writing over fifty years later, Lomax seemed to have forgotten that he had actually recorded Brown the previous summer with Son House, Fiddlin&#x27; Joe Martin and Leroy Williams. Brown played second guitar on three performances by the group and recorded one solo, &quot;Make Me a Pallet on the Floor&quot;. Willie Brown also played &quot;Ragged &amp; Dirty&quot;. According to Lomax, after Willie played &quot;Ragged &amp; Dirty&quot; for him, Brown quoted, &quot;That&#x27;s the blues, that&#x27;s the Delta blues.&quot;

The later biography is more clear. Brown lived in Robinsonville, Mississippi from 1929 and moved to Lake Cormorant, Mississippi by 1935. He performed occasionally with Charley Patton and continually with Son House until his death.

Brown died of heart disease in Tunica, Mississippi, in 1952.

==Discography==
Brown recorded six sides at a 1930 recording session in Grafton, Wisconsin. They were released on three 78-rpm shellac discs, of which only one has been found. Of the three sides known to exist below, all were issued on the 2001 Charley Patton box set.
* Paramount 13001: &quot;Grandma Blues&quot; / &quot;Sorry Blues&quot; (no copy has been found)
* Paramount 13090: &quot;M &amp; O Blues&quot; / &quot;Future Blues&quot; (only six copies are known)
* Paramount 13099: &quot;Window Blues&quot; / &quot;Kicking in My Sleep Blues&quot; (no copy has been found)
* Library of Congress recording by Lomax: &quot;Make Me a Pallet on the Floor&quot;

<text>Alberto Delgado y Pérez (born March 11, 1978) is a Cuban retired footballer.

==Club career==
Before joining the Rapids in 2005, he played for Ciudad de la Habana of Cuba and was one of the most dangerous players on the Cuba national team.

Delgado scored a goal and added three assists in his year with Colorado. He wears &quot;Pérez&quot; on the back of his jersey to honor his mother. He was released by the Rapids before the 2005 season, signing with Puerto Rico.

In 2008, he was loaned to Sevilla Bayamon in the Puerto Rico Soccer League and decided to stay with them instead of the Puerto Rico Islanders.

==International career==
He made his international debut for Cuba in 1998 and has earned a total of 22 caps, scoring 4 goals. He scored all of his goals in one game against Surinam, making him the only Cuban to score 4 in an official international match. His final international was a January 2002 CONCACAF Gold Cup match against South Korea.

===Defection to the United States===
Delgado defected from Cuba during that 2002 Gold Cup, together with cousin and future Colorado Rapids teammate Rey Ángel Martínez. He and Martínez ran away from their teammates halfway through breakfast, literally running for more than thirty minutes before finding a Spanish-speaking gas station attendant who then called a cab for them. Martínez made his way there shortly after that.

<doc id="1013089" wikidata="Q2296113" url="?curid=1013089" title="Solovay–Strassen primality test">
<text>The Solovay–Strassen primality test, developed by Robert M. Solovay and Volker Strassen in 1977, is a probabilistic primality test to determine if a number is composite or probably prime. The idea behind the test was discovered by M. M. Artjuhov in 1967 
(see Theorem E in the paper). This test has been largely superseded by the Baillie–PSW primality test and the Miller–Rabin primality test, but has great historical importance in showing the practical feasibility of the RSA cryptosystem. The Solovay–Strassen test is essentially an Euler–Jacobi probable prime test.

==Concepts==
Euler proved that for any odd prime number &quot;p&quot; and any integer &quot;a&quot;,

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the Legendre symbol. The Jacobi symbol is a generalisation of the Legendre symbol to formula_3, where &quot;n&quot; can be any odd integer. The Jacobi symbol can be computed in time O((log &quot;n&quot;)²) using Jacobi&#x27;s generalization of the
law of quadratic reciprocity.

Given an odd number &quot;n&quot; one can contemplate whether or not the congruence

:formula_4

holds for various values of the &quot;base&quot; &quot;a&quot;, given that &quot;a&quot; is relatively prime to &quot;n&quot;. If &quot;n&quot; is prime then this congruence is true for all &quot;a&quot;. So if we pick values of &quot;a&quot; at random and test the congruence, then 
as soon as we find an &quot;a&quot; which doesn&#x27;t fit the congruence we know that &quot;n&quot; is not prime (but this does not tell us a nontrivial factorization of &quot;n&quot;). This base &quot;a&quot; is called an &quot;Euler witness&quot; for &quot;n&quot;; it is a witness for the compositeness of &quot;n&quot;. The base &quot;a&quot; is called an &quot;Euler liar&quot; for &quot;n&quot; if the congruence is true while &quot;n&quot; is composite.

For every composite odd &quot;n&quot;, at least half of all bases

:formula_5

are (Euler) witnesses as the set of Euler liars is a proper subgroup of formula_6. For example, for formula_7, the set of Euler liars has order 8 and formula_8, and formula_6 has order 48.

This contrasts with the Fermat primality test, for which the proportion of witnesses may be much smaller. Therefore, there are no (odd) composite &quot;n&quot; without many witnesses, unlike the case of Carmichael numbers for Fermat&#x27;s test.

==Example==
Suppose we wish to determine if &quot;n&quot; = 221 is prime. We write (&quot;n&quot;−1)/2=110.

We randomly select an &quot;a&quot; (greater than 1 and smaller than &quot;n&quot;): 47.
Using an efficient method for raising a number to a power (mod &quot;n&quot;) such as binary exponentiation, we compute:
* &quot;a&quot;(&quot;n&quot;−1)/2 mod &quot;n&quot;  =  47110 mod 221  =  −1 mod 221
* formula_10 mod &quot;n&quot;  =  formula_11 mod 221  =  −1 mod 221.
This gives that, either 221 is prime, or 47 is an Euler liar for 221. We try another random &quot;a&quot;, this time choosing &quot;a&quot; = 2:
* &quot;a&quot;(&quot;n&quot;−1)/2 mod &quot;n&quot;  =  2110 mod 221  =  30 mod 221
* formula_10 mod &quot;n&quot;  =  formula_13 mod 221  =  −1 mod 221.
Hence 2 is an Euler witness for the compositeness of 221, and 47 was in fact an Euler liar. Note that this tells us nothing about the prime factors of 221, which are actually 13 and 17.

==Algorithm and running time==
The algorithm can be written in pseudocode as follows:
 inputs: &quot;n&quot;, a value to test for primality
 &quot;k&quot;, a parameter that determines the accuracy of the test
 output: &quot;composite&quot; if &quot;n&quot; is composite, otherwise &quot;probably prime&quot;
 repeat &quot;k&quot; times:
 choose &quot;a&quot; randomly in the range [2,&quot;n&quot; − 1]
 if or then 
 return &quot;composite&quot;
 return &quot;probably prime&quot;

Using fast algorithms for modular exponentiation, the running time of this algorithm is O(&quot;k&quot;·log3 &quot;n&quot;), where &quot;k&quot; is the number of different values of &quot;a&quot; we test.

==Accuracy of the test==
It is possible for the algorithm to return an incorrect answer. If the input &quot;n&quot; is indeed prime, then the output will always correctly be &quot;probably prime&quot;. However, if the input &quot;n&quot; is composite then it is possible for the output to be incorrectly &quot;probably prime&quot;. The number &quot;n&quot; is then called an Euler–Jacobi pseudoprime.

When &quot;n&quot; is odd and composite, at least half of all &quot;a&quot; with gcd(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) = 1 are Euler witnesses. We can prove this as follows: let {&quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;m&quot;} be the Euler liars and &quot;a&quot; an Euler witness. Then, for &quot;i&quot; = 1,2...,&quot;m&quot;:

:formula_14

Because the following holds:
:formula_15

now we know that

:formula_16

This gives that each &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; gives a number &quot;a&quot;·&quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot;, which is also an Euler witness. 
So each Euler liar gives an Euler witness and so the number of Euler witnesses is larger or equal to the number of Euler liars. Therefore, when &quot;n&quot; is composite, at least half of all &quot;a&quot; with gcd(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) = 1 is an Euler witness.

Hence, the probability of failure is at most 2−&quot;k&quot; (compare this with the probability of failure for the Miller–Rabin primality test, which is at most 4−&quot;k&quot;).

For purposes of cryptography the more bases &quot;a&quot; we test, i.e. if we pick a sufficiently large value of &quot;k&quot;, the better the accuracy of test. Hence the chance of the algorithm failing in this way is so small that the (pseudo) prime is used in practice in cryptographic applications, but for applications for which it is important to have a prime, a test like ECPP or the Pocklington primality test should be used which &quot;proves&quot; primality.

==Average-case behaviour==
The bound 1/2 on the error probability of a single round of the Solovay–Strassen test holds for any input &quot;n&quot;, but those numbers &quot;n&quot; for which the bound is (approximately) attained are extremely rare. On the average, the error probability of the algorithm is significantly smaller: it is less than

: formula_17

for &quot;k&quot; rounds of the test, applied to uniformly random . The same bound also applies to the related problem of what is the conditional probability of &quot;n&quot; being composite for a random number which has been declared prime in &quot;k&quot; rounds of the test.

==Complexity==
The Solovay–Strassen algorithm shows that the decision problem COMPOSITE is in the complexity class RP.

<text>Rey Ángel &quot;Boom-Boom&quot; Martínez (born May 13, 1980) is a Cuban footballer who most recently played for the Syracuse Silver Knights.

==Career==

===Professional===
Martínez began his career with Ciudad la Habana in his native Cuba, before defecting to the United States during the 2002 Gold Cup along with his national teammate Alberto Delgado. Martínez joined the Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer on June 11, 2004, and finished his first year with the Rapids with one assist in seven appearances (three starts), but struggled with injuries for much of the season. He was released by the Rapids before the 2005 season and signed with Rochester Rhinos of the USL First Division.
Martínez was used regularly as a late second-half attacking substitute, and went on to make 60 appearances for the Rhinos until August 2008, when he signed for the Carolina RailHawks for the rest of the season. In the fall of 2005, he moved indoors with the St. Louis Steamers. When the Steamers withdrew from the league during the summer of 2006, the Baltimore Blast selected Martinez in the third round of the dispersal draft. He played two seasons in Baltimore. On November 6, 2008, Martinez signed with the New Jersey Ironmen in the Xtreme Soccer League., and played for them for two seasons before returning to outdoor soccer with the Real Maryland Monarchs in the USL Second Division for the 2009 season.

In 2011, Martinez signed with the Rochester Lancers of the MISL.

===International===
He made his international debut for Cuba in a June 2000 FIFA World Cup qualification against Canada and has earned a total of 17 caps, scoring no goals. He represented his country in the Gold Cup, Copa Caribe, and Pan American Games.

His final international was a January 2002 CONCACAF Gold Cup match against South Korea.

<doc id="1013094" wikidata="Q2458173" url="?curid=1013094" title="Savannah River Site">
<text>The Savannah River Site (SRS) is a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) reservation in the United States, located in the state of South Carolina on land in Aiken, Allendale, and Barnwell counties adjacent to the Savannah River. It lies southeast of Augusta, Georgia. The site was built during the 1950s to refine nuclear materials for deployment in nuclear weapons. It covers and employs more than 10,000 people.

It is owned by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The management and operating contract is held by Savannah River Nuclear Solutions LLC (SRNS), a partnership between Fluor Corporation, Newport News Nuclear, Inc. (a subsidiary of Huntington Ingalls Industries) and Honeywell International, and the Integrated Mission Completion contract (including the former scope of the Liquid Waste Operations contract) is held by Savannah River Mission Completion, which is a team of companies led by BWX Technologies, AECOM, and Fluor. A major focus is cleanup activities related to work done in the past for American nuclear buildup. Currently none of the reactors on-site are operating (see list of nuclear reactors), although two of the reactor buildings are being used to consolidate and store nuclear materials. SRS is also home to the Savannah River National Laboratory and the United States&#x27; only operating radiochemical separations facility. Its tritium facilities are also the United States&#x27; only source of tritium, an essential component in nuclear weapons. The United States&#x27; only mixed oxide fuel (MOX) manufacturing plant was being constructed at SRS, but construction was terminated in February 2019. Construction was overseen by the National Nuclear Security Administration. The MOX facility was intended to convert legacy weapons-grade plutonium into fuel suitable for commercial power reactors.

Future plans for the site cover a wide range of options, including host to research reactors, a reactor park for power generation, and other possible uses. DOE and its corporate partners are watched by a combination of local, regional and national regulatory agencies and citizen groups.
==History==
In 1950, the federal government requested that DuPont build and operate a nuclear facility to make heavy water and tritium near the Savannah River in South Carolina. The company had expertise in nuclear operations, having designed and built the plutonium production complex at the Hanford site for the Manhattan Project during World War II. A large portion of farmland, the towns of Ellenton and Dunbarton, and several other communities including Meyers Mill, Leigh, Robbins, and Hawthorne were bought under eminent domain, and the site of became the Savannah River Site, managed by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. Biologists from the University of Georgia, led by professor Eugene Odum, began ecological studies of local plants and animals in 1951 creating Savannah River Ecology Laboratory (SREL), and plant construction began.

Production of heavy water for site reactors started in the Heavy Water Rework Facility in 1952, and the first production reactor, R Reactor, went critical in 1953. P, L, and K Reactors followed in 1954, and the first irradiated fuel was discharged. F Canyon, the world&#x27;s first operational full-scale PUREX separation plant, began radioactive operations on 4 November. PUREX (Plutonium and Uranium EXtraction) extracted plutonium and uranium products from materials irradiated in the reactors.

In 1955, C Reactor went critical. The first plutonium shipment left the site. H Canyon, a chemical separation facility, began radioactive operations. Permanent tritium facilities became operational and the first shipment of tritium to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was made. In 1956, the construction of the basic plant was complete.

===Nobel Prize===
The neutrino was discovered by Fred Reines and Clyde Cowan using the flux from P Reactor, with confirmation published in the 20 July 1956 issue of &quot;Science&quot;. Reines was awarded the 1995 Physics Nobel Prize; Cowan had already died.

In 1961, the AEC established a permanent ecology laboratory on the site; two Army barracks were converted into laboratory space for the scientists. The next year, the University of Georgia hired a full-time staff with doctoral degrees to expand the research effort. Known initially as the Laboratory of Radiation Ecology, it was renamed in the mid-1960s the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, reflecting the broad spectrum of ecological studies carried out on the site.

In 1962, the Heavy Water Components Test Reactor (HWCTR) went into operation, testing the heavy water system for use with civilian power reactors. In 1963, Receiving Basin for Off-Site Fuels (RBOF) received its first shipment of off-site spent nuclear fuel. That same year, curium-244 was produced as a heat source for space exploration. This was the first full scale conversion of an SRP reactor load to non-weapons materials.

R-Reactor and HWCTR were shut down in 1964. In 1965, californium-252, the heaviest isotope produced at SRP, was separated as a byproduct of the curium program. Beginning in 1969, californium-252 was made in a separate production program.

===Palomares===
Following the 1966 Palomares B-52 crash, the Savannah River Site received contaminated soil from the environmental clean up and remediation. Soil with radiation contamination levels above 1.2 MBq/m2 was placed in 250-litre (66 U.S. gallon) drums and shipped to the Savannah River Plant for burial. A total of 2.2 hectares (5.4 acres) was decontaminated by this technique, producing 6,000 barrels. 17 hectares (42 acres) of land with lower levels of contamination was mixed to a depth of 30 centimeters (12 in) by harrowing and plowing. On rocky slopes with contamination above 120 kBq/m2, the soil was removed with hand tools and shipped to the United States in barrels.

In 1968, L Reactor was shut down for upgrades, and, in 1971, K Reactor became the first reactor to be controlled by computer.

The site was designated as a National Environmental Research Park in 1972.

1977 saw the startup of the Plutonium Fuel Fabrication (PUFF) Facility.

The Savannah River Archaeological Program (SRARP) was established onsite in 1978 to perform data analysis of prehistoric and historic sites on SRP land.

===Remediation===
In 1981, an environmental cleanup program began. M Area Settling Basin cleanup began under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The heavy water rework facility was closed in 1982. Construction of the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) began in 1983. Wackenhut Services Incorporated (WSI) began providing security support services at SRP.

In 1985, HB-Line began producing plutonium-238 for NASA&#x27;s deep-space exploration program. The L-Reactor was restarted and C-Reactor shut down. A full-scale groundwater remediation system constructed in M-Area.

Construction of Saltstone and of the Replacement Tritium Facility began in 1986. In 1987, DuPont notified DOE that it would not continue to operate and manage the site. The Effluent Treatment Project (ETP) construction began.

In 1988, K, L and P Reactors were shut down. An Effluent Treatment Facility began operations to treat low-level radioactive wastewater from the F and H Area Separations facilities. In 1989, the site was included on the National Priority List and became regulated by the EPA. Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC) assumed management and operation of site facilities. The name of the facility changed from Savannah River Plant (SRP) to Savannah River Site (SRS).

In 1990, construction of a cooling tower for K Reactor began. Saltstone started operation. In 1991, the mixed waste management facility became the first site facility to be closed and certified under the provisions of RCRA. L Reactor and M Area settling basin were shut down. With the end of the Cold War, production of nuclear materials for weapons use ceased.

===Post-Cold War===
Roger D. Wensil, a pipe-fitter, worked for the B.F. Shaw Co., a subcontractor at Savannah River. In 1985, Wensil was dismissed as a whistleblower, after he complained of safety violations and illegal drug use among construction workers building a sensitive nuclear waste-handling facility at the plant. In 1992, the U.S. Congress enacted &quot;nuclear weapons whistleblower protection&quot;.

In 1992, the cooling tower was connected to the K Reactor, and the reactor operated briefly for the last time. The Secretary of Energy announced the phase-out of all uranium processing. Non-radioactive operations began at the Replacement Tritium Facility and the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). K Reactor was placed in cold standby condition in 1993. Non-radioactive test runs of the Defense Waste Processing Facility began. Construction began on the Consolidated Incineration Facility. Tritium introduced into the Replacement Tritium Facility and radioactive operations began. The Workforce Transition and Community Assistance was started.

In 1994, the Savannah River Site Citizens Advisory Board was established. The Replacement Tritium Facility saw its startup. In 1996, DWPF introduced radioactive material into the vitrification process. K Reactor was shut down. F Canyon was restarted and began stabilizing nuclear materials. In 1997, the first high-level radioactive waste tanks were closed, numbers 17 and 20. The Cold War Historic Preservation Program was begun.

In 2000, the K-Reactor building was converted to the K Area Materials Storage Facility. The Savannah River Site was selected as the location of three new plutonium facilities for: a MOX fuel fabrication; pit disassembly and conversion; and plutonium immobilization. WSRC earned the DOE&#x27;s top safety performance honor of Star Status.

Thousands of shipments of transuranic waste were contained and sent by truck and by rail to the DOE&#x27;s Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Project in New Mexico, with the first shipments beginning in 2001. DWPF completed production of four million pounds of environmentally acceptable classified waste.

In 2002, the F Canyon and FB Line facilities completed their last production run. The Savannah River Technology Center participated in a study of using a nuclear power reactor to produce hydrogen from water. Scientists reported finding a new species of radiation-resistant extremophiles inside one of the tanks. It was named Kineococcus radiotolerans.

In January 2003, Westinghouse Savannah River Co. completed transferring the last of F Canyon&#x27;s radioactive material to H Tank Farm. DWPF began radioactive operations with its second melter, installed during a shutdown. The last depleted uranium metal was shipped from M Area for disposition at Envirocare of Utah. The last unit of spent nuclear fuel from RBOF was shipped across the site to L Reactor in preparation for RBOF&#x27;s deactivation. Salt Waste Processing Facility (SWPF) construction began.

In 2004, the site shipped its 10,000th drum of transuranic waste to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), a DOE facility in New Mexico, 12 years ahead of schedule. In a visit, Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham designated the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL), one of 12 DOE national laboratories. Two prototype bomb disposal robots developed by SRNL were deployed for military use in Iraq.

2005 saw the Tritium Extraction Facility (TEF) completed for the purpose of extracting tritium from materials irradiated in the Tennessee Valley Authority&#x27;s commercial nuclear reactors. Savannah River Site&#x27;s first shipment of neptunium oxide arrived at the Argonne West Laboratory in Idaho. This was the last of the USA&#x27;s neptunium inventory, and the last of the materials to be stabilized to satisfy commitments for stabilizing nuclear materials. F Canyon was the first major nuclear facility at the site to be suspended and deactivated. Low-enriched uranium (LEU) from the site was used by a Tennessee Valley Authority nuclear power reactor to generate electricity. The tritium facilities modernization and consolidation project completed start-up and replaced the gas purification and processing that took place in 232-H. WSRC began multi-stage layoffs of permanent employees.

In 2006, design work took place for the Salt Waste Processing Facility (SWPF), a facility designed to process radioactive liquid waste stored in underground storage tanks at the site. The SWPF project work is performed by a group anchored by Parsons Corp. Work continued on design of the MOX fuel fabrication facility by a company now known as Shaw AREVA MOX Services. The SRNL was designated as the Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management&#x27;s &quot;Corporate Laboratory.&quot; Aiken County&#x27;s new Center for Hydrogen Research opened its doors. F-Area deactivation work was completed as was T-Area closure.

In 2007, the Tritium Extraction Facility (TEF) opened. On 1 August, construction officially began on the $4.86 billion MOX facility. Following startup testing, the facility expects a disposition rate of up to 3.5 tons of plutonium oxide each year.

In 2008, Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, LLC (SRNS) was awarded the contract for Maintenance and Operation of SRS. SRNS is a partnership between Fluor Corporation, Newport News Nuclear, Inc. (a subsidiary of Huntington Ingalls Industries) and Honeywell International. Savannah River Remediation (SRR) was awarded the contract for the Liquid Waste Operations of SRS. Historical markers were placed in P and R Areas commemorating the role both reactors played towards winning the Cold War. Construction on the Waste Solidification Building (WSB) began.

In 2009, SRS began The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) project representing a $1.6 billion investment in SRS. This project, expected to run through fiscal year 2011, will result in the accelerated cleanup of nuclear waste at SRS and a significant reduction in the site footprint. In 2009 alone, more than 1,500 new workers were hired and over 800 jobs retained, due to ARRA funding. SRS construction employees reached 23 million hours (11 consecutive years) without a lost time injury case.

M Area closure was completed in 2010, with the P and R Areas following in 2011.

In 2021, DOE awarded the new Integrated Mission Completion Contract to Savannah River Mission Completion, an LLC comprising BWX Technologies, Amentum&#x27;s AECOM, and Fluor. Transition from the Liquid Waste Operations contract to the Integrated Mission Completion Contract was completed in early 2022.

==MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility==

The MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility was created to satisfy the nuclear non-proliferation agreement between the Russian Federation and the United States. The Russian Federation has met its obligations of the 2000 treaty, completed its processing facility and commenced processing of plutonium into MOX fuel with experimental quantities produced in 2014 for a cost of about $200 million, reaching industrial capacity in 2015. A report by the National Nuclear Security Administration estimated the total cost over a 20-year life cycle for the Savannah river site MOX plant to be $47 billion if the annual funding cap was increased to $500 million or $110 billion if it were increased to $375 million. Other studies have disputed this cost assessment as excessive. The estimated time-to-completion of the facility was also contingent upon annual appropriations, with an estimated construction completion date of FY2043 for the $500 million annual cap and FY2099 for the $375 million annual cap (where completion was indicated to not be possible for annual appropriations below this level).

The Obama and Trump administrations have proposed cancelling the project, but Congress continues to fund construction. The Aiken Chamber of Commerce of the state of South Carolina filed a lawsuit against the federal government claiming they have simply become a dumping ground for unprocessed weapons grade plutonium for the indefinite future and demanding previously agreed upon payment of contractual non-delivery fines. The federal government filed for dismissal and it was granted in February 2017.

The State of South Carolina similarly sued the federal government over the termination of the project, arguing that the Department of Energy had not prepared an environmental impact statement concerning the long-term storage of plutonium in the state and additionally that the government had failed to follow the statutory provisions concerning obtaining a waiver to cease construction on the facility. In January 2019, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected South Carolina&#x27;s suit for lack of standing; in October 2019 the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the state of South Carolina&#x27;s petition of certiorari, thereby allowing the lower court&#x27;s ruling to stand and the federal government to terminate construction.

In May 2018, Energy Secretary Rick Perry informed Congress he had effectively ended the about 70% complete project. Perry stated that the cost of a dilute and dispose approach to the plutonium will cost less than half of the remaining lifecycle cost of the MOX plant program. In February 2019, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) granted a request to terminate the plant&#x27;s construction authorization.

== History of Accidents ==
A Congressional committee in 1988 heard testimony of over 30 significant accidents at the facility that were hidden from the public. These included: a near loss of control of the L Reactor in 1960 when technicians tried to restart it; a &quot;very significant leak&quot; of water from the C Reactor in 1965; a large radiation release in November, 1970, into the interior of the facility; and a melting of fuel rods in the C Reactor in December, 1970.

==Litigation==
After six years of litigation over plutonium moved to the site, South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson announced August 31, 2020 that the federal government agreed to pay the state $600 million. Wilson described this as &quot;the single largest settlement in South Carolina&#x27;s history&quot;. The federal government also agreed to remove the remaining 9.5 metric tons of plutonium stored at the site by 2037. At a town hall meeting at USC-Aiken on August 20, 2021, S.C. Governor Henry McMaster led a discussion on how to spend $525 million of that amount.

==Reactors==

Savannah River is home to the following nuclear reactors:

(see list of nuclear reactors)

==Contract changes==
Management of the Savannah River Site was to be bid in 2006, but the Department of Energy extended the contract with the existing partners for 18 months to June 2008.

In 2006 DOE decided to split the WSRC contract into two new separate contracts, i.e. the M&amp;O Contract and the Liquid Waste Contract to be awarded before June 2008. Responding to the DOE RFP, the Savannah River Nuclear Solutions (SRNS), LLC – now a Fluor partnership with Honeywell, and Huntington Ingalls Industries (formerly part of Northrop Grumman) – submitted a proposal in June 2007 for the new M&amp;O Contract. A team led by URS and including many of the WSRC partners also submitted a proposal. On January 9, 2008, it was announced that SRNS LLC had won the new contract, with a 90-day transition period to start 24 January 2008. However, the transition was delayed by a protest filed with GAO by the URS team on 22 January 2008. The GAO denied the protest on 25 April. DOE-SR then directed SRNS to start transition on 2 May and take over operation on 1 August 2008.

<text>Peter Keaston Reith (15 July 1950 – 8 November 2022) was an Australian politician who served in the House of Representatives from 1982 to 1983 and from 1984 to 2001, representing the Liberal Party. He was the party&#x27;s deputy leader from 1990 to 1993, and served as a minister in the Howard government.

Reith was born in Melbourne and studied law at Monash University. He settled in Cowes, Victoria, and served on the Phillip Island Shire Council from 1976 to 1981 (including as shire president for a period). Reith was elected to parliament at the 1982 Flinders by-election. He lost his seat at the 1983 federal election, but won it back the following year. In 1990, Reith was elected deputy leader of the Liberal Party under John Hewson. He was replaced by Michael Wooldridge after the 1993 election. In the Howard government, Reith served as Minister for Industrial Relations (1996–1997), Minister for Small Business (1997–2001), Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations (1998–2001), and finally Minister for Defence from January 2001 until his retirement at the 2001 election. After leaving politics he worked as a company director and political commentator.

==Early life==
Peter Keaston Reith was born in Melbourne on 15 July 1950. He was educated at Brighton Grammar School and at Monash University, from which he obtained bachelor&#x27;s degrees in economics and law. He then practised as a solicitor first in Melbourne and then at Cowes, a small town on Phillip Island. First elected as a Councillor of the Shire of Phillip Island from 1976, he was Shire President in his last year on the Council in 1981.

While living on Phillip Island, Reith was behind the establishment of Newhaven College, an independent school on Phillip Island. He was also the key proponent for the establishment of the penguin research facility.

==Political life==
Reith joined the Liberal Party in 1966. Representing that party, he entered the House of Representatives in December 1982 by winning a by-election for the seat of Flinders, caused by the resignation of former Deputy Liberal Leader Sir Phillip Lynch.

Reith lost the seat only three months later at the March 1983 general election. He regained the seat at the December 1984 election, which saw a substantial swing towards the Liberals (though not enough to win them government), and he continued to hold the seat for the next 17 years.

Except for a few months in 1993, Reith was a shadow minister from 1987 until 1996. His posts included Shadow Minister for Housing, Shadow Minister for Sport and Recreation, and then Shadow Attorney-General in 1988. In the latter capacity, he led the successful &quot;no&quot; campaign at the 1988 constitutional referendum.

He was also Shadow Minister for Defence and Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs. After the defeat of the Liberal Party led by Andrew Peacock at the 1990 federal election, and Peacock&#x27;s subsequent resignation from the leadership, Reith sought the leadership himself, but was defeated by John Hewson, who won by 62 votes to 13.

Following Hewson&#x27;s victory Reith was then elected deputy opposition leader and appointed Shadow Treasurer, a position he held from 1990 to 1993. Along with Hewson, Reith was one of the architects of the Liberal Party&#x27;s &quot;Fightback!&quot; policy, which included a Goods and Services Tax.

In 1991, he was technically shadow to five Treasurers. This came as a result of the ruling Labor Party having a leadership crisis that year.

Reith was Shadow Treasurer when the 1990, 1991 and 1992 Budgets were delivered and each by a different Treasurer.

He resigned as Shadow Treasurer after the Liberals were defeated in the 1993 election. He lost the deputy Liberal leadership in the post-election ballot, and was replaced by Michael Wooldridge.

Despite the fact that Reith was the incumbent deputy leader, he had five challengers to his position, including Wooldridge, and Reith did not win enough votes to make it to the final ballot. Following the landslide victory of John Howard at the 1996 election, Reith was appointed Minister for Industrial Relations, and Leader of the House. He was one of the best-known and most influential members of Howard&#x27;s cabinet. His responsibilities involved drafting and implementing the government&#x27;s industrial relations policy, and he is perhaps best known for the significant productivity reforms which followed the 1998 Australian waterfront dispute. Reith&#x27;s handling of the dispute, which included the failed attempt to use Australian Armed forces personnel, trained in Dubai to take over waterfront jobs and later the use of balaclava clad hired security guards with dogs, to remove working waterside workers from the work site. He strongly supported Patrick Corporation in its contest with the Maritime Union of Australia, which led to bitter opposition from the unions and the Australian Labor Party (ALP). The dispute was eventually settled in the courts with the decision going in the unions&#x27; favour and new enterprise agreements being negotiated in accordance with the court&#x27;s directions.

Reith also introduced and implemented reforms to the Commonwealth public service, a significant package of reforms for small business, and an innovative employment programme for indigenous Australians.

In 1994 when in Opposition, Reith supported the idea of citizen-initiated referendums but found no support with his Coalition colleagues with National Party leader Tim Fischer describing it as a &quot;law-making cancer&quot;.

During the campaign for the Australian republic referendum in 1999, Reith advocated for Australia becoming a republic, and favoured the idea of the president being directly elected.

In 2000, Reith was embroiled in an investigation over the use of his phone card, which had incurred charges totalling A$50,000. He admitted that about $1,000 of phone calls were the result of his son&#x27;s access to the PIN associated with the card. Prior to the phone card scandal, Reith had been discussed as a possible successor to Howard.

Howard transferred Reith to the Defence portfolio in 2000. The following year, Reith announced his impending retirement, and did not contest the 2001 election. Late in the election campaign he became embroiled in the &quot;Children Overboard affair&quot;, in which the government made claims that asylum seekers had thrown children overboard in a ploy to secure passage to Australia, and failed to correct the record when advised there was no evidence for the claims. Reith defended his actions, and made public statements about the matter in the documentary series &quot;The Howard Years&quot;, which screened in Australia in November and December 2008, in &quot;Leaky Boat&quot; in July 2011, and in the 2012 Logie Award-winning documentary &quot;Go Back to Where You Came From&quot;. Reith was succeeded as MP for Flinders by fellow Liberal Greg Hunt, and as Minister for Defence by Senator Robert Hill.

==After leaving parliament==

After leaving parliament, Reith had a number of part-time interests, including advising a Sydney government relations firm, Tenix, a major defence supplier and others. From 2003 to 2009 he was an executive director of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (based in London); in this capacity he represented Australia, the Republic of Korea, Egypt and New Zealand. While in London, Reith was also a member of an independent commission that reported to the Cameron Opposition on UK tax reform.

During 2011, after writing a report for the Liberal Party on the 2010 election, Reith challenged Alan Stockdale (who in the 1990s had been State Treasurer of Victoria) for the presidency of the Liberal Party. In that contest, Reith lost to Stockdale by just one vote: 56 to 57. Liberal leader Tony Abbott effectively made his vote for Stockdale public, when he was recorded on camera showing his vote to Stockdale. In 2013 Reith was Chairman of the Victorian Gas Market Review which concluded with the presentation of his report to the Napthine Government.

From 2014 Reith has been writing weekly for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and was a political commentator for Sky News Australia, appearing regularly on &quot;AM Agenda&quot; and &quot;The Cabinet&quot;. Reith began co-hosting a temporary format with Peter Beattie in April 2016 as a replacement for &quot;Richo&quot; while that program&#x27;s host Graham Richardson was on leave to have major surgery.

In April 2016, Reith registered as a political lobbyist in South Australia. He represented two clients in that jurisdiction: Bechtel Infrastructure Australia (Pty Ltd) and G4S Custodial Services Pty Ltd.

In March 2017, Reith was hospitalised after suspected bleeding on the brain and was unable to go through with his challenge to Michael Kroger for the Liberal party presidency. State Opposition Leader Matthew Guy had supported Reith challenging Kroger as he (along with many Liberal MPs) believed that branch stacking by power broker Marcus Bastiaan had gone ahead unchecked.

==Personal life and death==
In 2015, Peter married Kerrie Reith in a small and intimate ceremony surrounded by close friends and family. The two married at The Royal Brighton Yacht Club.

Reith died from complications from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on 8 November 2022, at the age of 72 in Melbourne.

<text>RIAS (; &quot;Radio in the American Sector&quot;) was a radio and television station in the American Sector of Berlin during the Cold War. It was founded by the US occupational authorities after World War II in 1946 to provide the German population in and around Berlin with news and political reporting. 

==History==

By the end of 1945 the US Military Administration in Berlin decided to establish its own broadcasting system, after the Soviets had refused to provide air time on the &quot;Berliner Rundfunk&quot; radio station. Supervised by the US Information Control Division, broadcasting commenced on 7 February 1946. For the first months the programme could be distributed via telephone line only (as DIAS – &quot;Drahtfunk im amerikanischen Sektor&quot;), until a first medium wave transmitter was installed in September.

By its creative and innovative programming, the station quickly gained much popularity. Its importance was magnified during the Berlin Blockade in 1948-49, when it carried the message of Allied determination to resist Soviet intimidation. At the same time, the RIAS Symphony Orchestra under chief conductor Ferenc Fricsay (still existing as the &quot;Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin&quot;) and a professional chamber choir, the &quot;Rundfunkchor des RIAS&quot; (present-day &quot;RIAS Kammerchor&quot;) were also established by the US forces; together with the RIAS Dance Orchestra and the RIAS Big Band, they largely contributed to the station&#x27;s entertainment programme under the editorship of the former &quot;Berliner Rundfunk&quot; employee Hans Rosenthal.

After the Berlin blockade, RIAS (by now carried on terrestrial medium wave and later FM transmitters) evolved into a surrogate home service for East Germans, as it broadcast news, commentary, and cultural programs that were unavailable in the controlled media of the German Democratic Republic. By own account &quot;a free voice of the free world&quot;, the station aired the chime of the Freedom Bell each Sunday at noon, followed by an excerpt from the text of the &quot;Declaration of Freedom&quot;. Listening to it in Soviet-controlled East Germany was discouraged. After the workers&#x27; riots in East Germany in 1953, which were the result of the government&#x27;s raising of food prices and factory production quotas, the Communist government blamed the incident on RIAS and the CIA.

Eventually RIAS was jointly funded and managed by the United States and West Germany. Under the supervision of the United States Information Agency from 1965, the station was staffed almost entirely with German employees, who worked under a small American management team. It maintained a large research component during the Cold War, and interviewed travellers from East Germany and compiled material from the East German Communist media, and broadcast programs for specific groups in East Germany, such as youths, women, farmers, even border guards. RIAS had a huge audience in East Germany and was the most popular foreign radio service. This audience began to shrink only when West German television became widely available to viewers in East Germany. A second radio programme, then called &quot;RIAS 2&quot;, was launched in 1953; it was remodelled as a youth radio station from 1985.

== Television ==
RIAS-TV, began broadcasting (as a part-time optout on the terrestrial frequency of SAT.1) from West Berlin in August 1988, which also acquired the German Educational Television Network in United States. Prior to this there were no Western television broadcasts &quot;specifically&quot; targeted at East Germany, although many of the domestic West German TV networks (particularly ARD) had high power transmitters along the border and could be received throughout most of East where many of their programmes attracted a larger audience than the official East German domestic broadcasters.

The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and German reunification the following year meant that RIAS-TV would be short lived. In 1992 Deutsche Welle (Germany&#x27;s International broadcaster) inherited the RIAS-TV broadcast facilities, using them to start a German, English and Spanish language television channel broadcast via satellite.

==Transmitters==
The station&#x27;s most important transmitter was at Berlin-Britz (on 612 kHz). Later a second transmitter at Hof in Bavaria was added to improve reception in the southern parts of East Germany (on 684 kHz), which was switched on at sunset to cover Germany with skywave. In addition to medium wave, the station also transmitted on shortwave on a frequency of 6.005 MHz. The Hof facility was closed and carted off to Mühlacker in 1994, though the Berlin-Britz facility remained in service until 2013, transmitting the programmes of Deutschlandradio Kultur; it was finally dismantled in 2015.

<doc id="1013109" wikidata="Q600806" url="?curid=1013109" title="Abrams P-1 Explorer">
<text>The Abrams P-1 Explorer is an American purpose-designed aerial photography and survey aircraft that first flew in November 1937.

==Design and development==
The Explorer was designed by aerial survey pioneer Talbert Abrams, to meet his needs for a stable aircraft with excellent visibility for his work. Abrams was an early aerial photographer in World War I. He used a Curtiss Jenny post-war, forming ABC airlines. In 1923, Abrams founded Abrams Aerial Survey Company and in 1937, Abrams Aircraft Corporation to build the specialized P-1 aircraft.

The standard single front-engined airplane of this era had many drawbacks for carrying out scientific photography. They were created to be nimble in the air rather than stable photographic platforms. Their engines leaked oil which would then flow under the aircraft and affect the camera lens. Finally, the loud engines made cockpit conversation difficult.

Abrams designed an aircraft with a rear engine to keep the camera apertures clean and reduce cockpit noise, and used a delta type wing to facilitate side vision. He hired engineers Kenneth Ronan and Andrew Edward Kunzl, in Marshall, Michigan, who drew plans and began construction in the former Page Brothers Buggy Company factory.

Ronan and Kunzl operated an aeronautical repair station at the Marshall airfield. Planning and construction took ten months, and resulted in an airplane designed for more efficient and economical aerial photography.

To create the clear nose so the pilot had an unobstructed view, Abrams hired the German company Rohm and Haas, creators of Plexiglas. With a wooden model of each window pane, the Plexiglas was clamped in a frame similar to a window frame. Heated until it began to sag, it was then pushed down by two workers holding the frame until it was molded to the wooden model.

The Plexiglas could then be trimmed and mounted in the frame work. When the Explorer came back for restoration, the panels which had been heated were as clear as when new, though were destroyed due to abuse during disassembly.

The Explorer was a low-wing aluminium monoplane with twin booms and a central nacelle for the pilot and camera equipment. The pod&#x27;s nose section was extensively glazed in Plexiglas. The undercarriage was fixed and of tricycle configuration.

Originally powered with a engine and a two-bladed propeller, it was sent back to Ronan &amp; Kunzul to increase the horsepower to 450. This change required braces to be added from the wing top to the fuselage and they added a three-bladed propeller, with Abrams hoping the increased power would attract a buyer.

World War II interrupted Abrams&#x27;s work, and the single aircraft built was put into storage for the duration of the war. Obsolete by the end of the conflict, it was donated to the US National Air and Space Museum in 1948, where it remains awaiting restoration.

==Variants==
*P-1: the initial design and prototype.
*PC-4: Abrams planned a pressurized version of the P-1, named the PC-4 that did not go into production.

==Operational history==

The P-1 was flown with a variety of camera gear. The Abrams Instrument Corporation C-3 camera was used to produce 650 nine by nine inch photos per flight.

== Restoration attempt ==
In 1968, a group of aviation enthusiasts began a project to restore the Explorer, including Jim Linn, who worked at Abrams Aerial Survey, Ron Dietz, a student pilot and engineer at Oldsmobile Division of General Motors, and Ellis Hammond, President of the Michigan Aerospace Educational Association. They worked with Don Lopez, the Assistant Director of the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum to release the aircraft, and in January 1975 the Explorer was transported in a Michigan National Guard Lockheed C-130 Hercules to the Capital City Airport in Lansing, Michigan.

The aircraft was moved to a state-owned hangar, where Dietz carried out careful photography before any disassembly was done, as well as detailed tracings of all the lettering so it could be recreated accurately at the end of the project.

The wings were sent to Montcalm Community College, where they were stripped, cleaned, repainted and recovered with silver painted fabric. The instruments panels and controls were disassembled and restored by Dietz&#x27;s colleagues at Oldsmobile.

The aircraft was physically moved to the Lansing Community College aviation program. However, the restoration attempt was never completed; in 1981, the Lansing Community College truck driving school returned the plane to the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility of the Smithsonian, where it remains.

<doc id="1013113" wikidata="Q525660" url="?curid=1013113" title="Andy Dorman">
<text>Andrew Dorman (born 1 May 1982) is a former professional footballer. During his club career, he played as a midfielder for New England Revolution, Crystal Palace and St. Mirren. Born in England, represented the Wales national team.

Born in England of English parents, he grew up in Wales and represented the Wales schools team, eventually gaining full senior international recognition when FIFA amended its rules on eligibility. He has played professionally in the United States, Scotland, and England.

==College==
Dorman moved to the United States to attend Boston University, where he was a standout for the school&#x27;s college soccer team.

==Club career==
===New England===
After graduating, Dorman was drafted 58th overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft by the New England Revolution on 16 January 2004. He succeeded in making the team&#x27;s 2004 developmental roster, signing as a &quot;Transitional International/
Developmental Player&quot; on 13 April 2004. Dorman made his debut for New England, coming on for Daouda Kanté, in a 3–1 loss against San Jose Earthquakes on 17 April 2004. In his first season with the Revs, Dorman clocked only 365 minutes, but scored two goals and an assist in that time, evincing an attacking flair. Dorman scored his first Revolution goal on 11 August 2004 in a 3-0 win over FC Dallas. He also recorded his first professional assist in the match, setting up Taylor Twellman in the 86th minute. Dorman appeared in all three of the Revolution&#x27;s 2004 MLS Cup Playoff matches, and provided a game-winning assist on 31 October in the Eastern Conference Semifinal against the Columbus Crew.

In 2005, Dorman made 30 appearances, and came on as a substitute in MLS Cup 2005 on 11 November.

The 2006 season was a break-out year for Dorman, as he played in all 32 games for the Revs (starting all 32), scoring six goals and recording a career-high ten assists. Soccer America named Dorman the third-best attacking midfielder in MLS for 2006. During a season when many Revolution players missed time due to injury, suspension, or international duty, Dorman was forced to play many roles and positions. His diligence and creativity on the attack gained the attention and respect of many around the league, and he was named the 2006 &quot;Man of the Year&quot; by the Midnight Riders, the Revolution&#x27;s independent supporters group. In the 2006 MLS Cup Playoffs, Dorman started all four of the Revs’ games, providing an assist on Taylor Twellman’s goal against Chicago in the second game of the Eastern Conference Semifinal.

In 2007, Dorman made 30 appearances for the Revs, scoring a career-high seven goals and notching two assists. On 23 June, Dorman had his first-ever multi-goal game, recording a brace against Toronto FC. He made his 100th MLS career appearance on 2 August against the Kansas City Wizards. On 3 October, Dorman played the entirety of the 2007 U.S. Open Cup final, helping the Revolution win their first-ever championship.

Although Dorman wanted to re-sign with New England in MLS, contract negotiations fell through.

===St Mirren===
Dorman signed with Scottish Premier League outfit St Mirren. Upon joining St Mirren, teammate Jay Heaps said Dorman was &quot;world class.&quot; One year on, Dorman revealed upon signing for St Mirren, he did not know the location of the club (Paisley). He made his debut during a home league match against Motherwell on 19 January 2008, and provided an early assist in a 3–1 victory. Dorman then scored a winning goal in a Scottish Cup replay against Dundee United and he also scored against them in a 1–1 draw one month later.

His performances for St Mirren during 2008–09 led to many teams watching Dorman with a view to bringing him into their side. Teams known to be interested included Sheffield United and Bolton Wanderers. Dorman&#x27;s contract with St Mirren included a club option of an extra year, which was exercised in March 2009 after he was voted Scottish Premier League player of the month for February 2009 and another player of the month for April 2009. Dorman spoke out about his transfer speculation, stating that he doesn&#x27;t pay attention to the rumours and insists he&#x27;s happy at St Mirren, while manager Gus MacPherson said he would only let Dorman leave for £1 million. Dorman finished the season as St Mirren&#x27;s joint top scorer (with Billy Mehmet) with 12 goals each.

However, the following season, Dorman couldn&#x27;t re-produce his form of the previous campaign and was unable to rediscover his goalscoring form; but still, other clubs were tracking him; like Championship side Watford. Shortly after the transfer headlines, Dorman suffered a hamstring injury, ruling him out for six weeks after coming off in the first half in a 3–1 loss against Celtic. In the next meeting against Celtic on 24 March 2010, Dorman scored a brace in a 4–0 win. After the match, MacPherson praised the players, including Dorman, himself. In mid April, Dorman scored three goals in the three games, including against Falkirk, St Johnstone and Kilmarnock. Dorman finished the season as St Mirren&#x27;s league top scorer, with Billy Mehmet with 12 goals each in all appearances. At the end of the season, Dorman announced his intention to leave St Mirren, ending a two-year association with the club, with Championship side Portsmouth keen to sign him.

=== Crystal Palace ===
After his contract at St Mirren expired, Dorman made the move to England to join Championship side Crystal Palace. On the opening day of the season, Dorman made his debut in a 3–2 win over Leicester City; two-months later, Dorman scored his first goal in a 4–3 loss against Preston. However, he made a slow start to life with the Eagles and soon dropped out of the Palace first-team after the sacking of George Burley, although Burley&#x27;s successor Dougie Freedman said out of favour players Dorman and Owen Garvan did have a future.

On 31 August 2012, Dorman&#x27;s contract was terminated by mutual consent, despite it being expected to end the next season.

=== Loan at Bristol Rovers ===
His second season in south London saw him limited to appearances for Palace&#x27;s reserve team, and so Dorman made the move to League Two side Bristol Rovers on a loan deal in November 2011. He made his debut for Rovers on 12 November in the FA Cup 3–1 win against Corby Town; Seven days later, Dorman made his league debut for the club in a 2–0 loss against Barnet. Dorman had initially signed until 2 January, which was extended by a further month. On 27 January 2012, he signed for the rest of the season, along with four other players. On 25 February 2012, Dorman scored his first goal in a 1–0 win over Rotherham United After scoring his first goal, Dorman spoke out about his frustration at wanting to get playing time after having his career revived at Bristol Rovers. Dorman also said he had experienced playing under three different managers during his loan spell, but saw the positive side of this. Towards the end of the season, Dorman scored his second goal in a 5–1 win over Accrington Stanley. After his loan spell at Bristol Rovers, Dorman did not rule out returning to the club after clarifying his future with Crystal Palace.

===Return to New England===
Dorman re-signed with New England Revolution on 15 November 2012, playing for his former teammate Jay Heaps. He made 12 appearances (3 starts) during the 2013 New England Revolution season, recording an assist in the Revolution&#x27;s 3-2 victory over the Columbus Crew on 19 October, and helping the Revolution return to the playoffs for the first time since 2009. Dorman received two straight red cards during the 2013 campaign, on 10 August against Sporting Kansas City, and on 5 October against the Red Bulls,

He started both of the Revolution&#x27;s playoff matches against Sporting Kansas City in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, scoring in the 55th minute of the first match to give the Revolution a 1-0 lead.

Dorman managed to make 16 appearances in the 2014 New England Revolution season despite being sidelined with an MCL injury on 15 July which kept him out of the team until 12 September. He recorded one assist in the Revolution&#x27;s 3-1 loss to the Philadelphia Union on 28 June. He also made 3 appearances in the Revolution&#x27;s 2014 playoff run, which ultimately culminated in a loss to the LA Galaxy in the 2014 MLS Cup Final.

In 2015, Dorman made 18 appearances for the Revolution. He scored the Revolution&#x27;s only goal in a 4-1 loss to the New York Red Bulls on 11 July. The goal was Dorman&#x27;s first for the Revolution in regular-season play since 14 July 2007. Dorman&#x27;s contract expired at the end of the 2015 season, and he joined the coaching staff of the Boston Bolts.

==Career statistics==
:&quot;(correct as of 5 May 2012)&quot;
==International career==

Although he was born in England of English parents, Dorman grew up in Wales, and represented the Welsh schools team. He expressed interest in either playing for England, Wales or gaining American citizenship and playing for the United States, having lived there for over seven years. Dorman had moved to America to attend Boston University, where he was named a two-time All-New England player.

Although Dorman considers himself to be Welsh, he was not eligible to play for Wales as he was born in England and none of his parents or grandparents were born in Wales. In October 2009, however, FIFA ratified changes which allow players with 5 years compulsory education in a country before the age of 16 to represent that country, which made Dorman eligible to represent Wales. Dorman was included in the squad to play against Scotland on 14 November 2009 when, ironically, he was playing his club football for Scottish team St Mirren. Wales won 3–0, but he stayed on the bench for the whole game. Dorman made his debut for the Wales national football team on 23 May 2010 against Croatia at the Stadion Gradski.

==Personal life==
Dorman has said his idol is Michael Owen. He attended Hawarden High School where Owen and the late Gary Speed also attended.

His brother is fellow player Richie Dorman.

Dorman holds a US green card which qualifies him as a domestic player for MLS roster purposes.
