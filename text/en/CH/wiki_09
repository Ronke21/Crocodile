<text>HMS &quot;Zebra&quot;, was an 18-gun &quot;Cruizer&quot;-class brig-sloop of the Royal Navy. She was built of teak in the East India Company&#x27;s Bombay Dockyard and launched in 1815 as the last of her class. She chased pirates in the Mediterranean, just missed the Battle of Navarino, sailed to East Indies, where she almost foundered, and on to Australia, chased Malay pirates, and was wrecked in 1840 during the Syrian War.

==Service==
Commander Robert Forbes commissioned &quot;Zebra&quot; in December 1815 to sail her to England. However, Philip Henry Bridges was acting commander of &quot;Zebra&quot; from December 1815 to November 1816, when he was promoted into . In May 1816, she arrived in Madras from Calcutta, and on 28 July 1816 she was at Simon&#x27;s Bay where a terrible hurricane stranded and almost destroyed her and the frigate . By 14 December 1816, she had reached Portsmouth. There she was paid off into ordinary, where she stayed until 1825. In February 1825, she was recommissioned for the Mediterranean under Commander Edward R. Williams, and sailed in May.

===Mediterranean pirates===
On 6 January 1827, &quot;Zebra&quot; left for the Mediterranean. She arrived in Zante on 28 January 1827 carrying dispatches from Captain Gawen William Hamilton of for Captain Irby of . At Zante Williams learned that the governor of Maina – Giovanni Mavromicali – had not fulfilled his pledge to bring his galliot and an Ionian prize to Zante to have their papers checked. Irby had warned Mavromicali that should the papers not be in order the British would seize both vessels, and should Mavromicali fail to comply, he should send his women and children into the mountains as the Royal Navy would be compelled to destroy his houses. Williams sailed on 30 January in search of Mavromicali.

On 4 February, &quot;Zebra&quot;″s boats brought out from the port of Catecali a small local sailing boat belonging to the pirate Nicolo Cipriotti, which they burnt. The boats also rescued an Ionian trabaccolo that Cipriotti had seized.

The boats continued their search for Mavromicali&#x27;s galley along the shore towards Cape Kitries. On 8 February, near Scardamoula, they sighted a vessel that appeared to be their quarry, but were unable to catch it before it took refuge in a port. Williams sent all his boats into the port to demand that the surrender of the galliot. The boats then left, having received a promise that Mavromicali would sail to Zante or Napoli di Romania the following morning. Not trusting Mavromicali&#x27;s word, &quot;Zebra&quot; anchored only 300 yards from the galliot. When Williams tried to send a further message to Mavromicali, the emissaries were rebuffed and although Williams wanted to respond by seizing the galliot the seas were too rough. In the morning, Williams saw that the hills were ringed with armed men and when the British reminded Mavromicali of his agreement, the Governor made no reply. Eventually &quot;Zebra&quot; fired a carronade at the bow of the galley, dismounting one of the galliot&#x27;s four guns. Mavromicalli agreed to give up his ship and the British then seized her. &quot;Zebra&quot; sailed on 10 February with her capture and arrived in Zante on the next evening.

On 4 March 1827 &quot;Zebra&quot; became becalmed off Zea. While there, she observed two boats full of men leaving the island. &quot;Zebra&quot; sent her own boats in pursuit. One fleeing boat ran ashore and all but four men fled ashore; the British then burned it. The following night as &quot;Zebra&quot; sailed through the Doro Passage, five boats harried her, firing on her. They then disappeared into the dark when &quot;Zebra&quot; tried to bring her guns to bear.

Williams received promotion to captain in April, and Charles Cotton replaced him in May. &quot;Zebra&quot; operated out of Malta, protecting British trade in the Greek Archipelago, at Alexandria, and around the coasts of Syria and Caramania.

The schooner &quot;Robert&quot;, Thomas Simson, master, sailed from Messina for Smyrna on 17 July. On the evening of 23 July, two boats fired on &quot;Robert&quot; while she was in mid channel between Serpho and Sepanto. About 100 pirates then boarded &quot;Robert&quot;, taking her cargo and the crew&#x27;s clothes and possessions. The pirates left at daybreak when a convoy came in sight. &quot;Robert&quot; approached the convoy and notified &quot;Zebra&quot;, which was escorting the convoy. &quot;Robert&quot; accompanied the convoy to Milo and then joined a French convoy to Smyrna.

===Navarino===

In October, &quot;Zebra&quot; joined Admiral Sir Edward Codrington in — together with and — in search of a force of Turkish vessels that &quot;Dartmouth&quot; reported had left Navarin or Navarino and were heading to Patras. Codrington&#x27;s small squadron intercepted the Ottoman fleet and forced it to return to Navarino. In this, &quot;Zebra&quot; played a striking role by firing across the bow of an 80-gun Ottoman ship of the line.

Eventually Codrington — joined by more British vessels, together with a number of French and Russian ones — inflicted a massive defeat on the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Navarino on 27 October. &quot;Zebra&quot; missed the battle, Codrington having sent her to get assistance.

Cotton died on board &quot;Zebra&quot; of a fever on 11 February 1828 and she came under the temporary command of her lieutenant, Wheatley. Cotton was believed to have developed the fever as a consequence of his exertions on 31 January in rescuing the crew of off Carabusa (Gramvousa) on Candia. Sir Thomas Staines had taken a small squadron to the island off Cape Busa (Vouxa) to deal with a nest of Greek pirates that had made the harbour there their home after the Greeks had taken possession of it early in the war against the Turks in Crete. The squadron consisted of &quot;Cambrian&quot;, &quot;Pelican&quot;, , , &quot;Zebra&quot;, and two French corvettes. In the port there were 14 Greek vessels, together with an Austrian and an Ionian merchantmen that the pirates had taken. After the pirates had refused to surrender, the squadron opened fire and destroyed a number of the vessels. Marines from &quot;Pelican&quot; and &quot;Isis&quot; then landed to take possession of the fortress there. However, as the squadron left, &quot;Isis&quot; struck &quot;Cambrian&quot;, causing her to broadside the rocks in the narrow channel. The strong swell then broke up &quot;Cambrian&quot;.

Commander Edmund W. Gilbert replaced Wheatley in October 1828.

===East Indies and Australia===
In January 1829, Commander Richard Pridham took command of &quot;Zebra&quot; and sailed her to the East Indies. Commander Durrell de Sausmarez was appointed to command in July, assumed command in November, and sailed her to Port Jackson. However, he left &quot;Zebra&quot; in February 1832 due to ill-health, returning home in the whaler &quot;Strathfieldsaye&quot;.

In September 1831, &quot;Zebra&quot; was at the Bay of Islands in response to a rumour that a French man-o-war was expected, with the suspected intention of annexing New Zealand.

In 1832, &quot;Zebra&quot; was at Port Taranaki in response to a report that the Māori there were planning to attack settlers. When she arrived it turned out there was no unrest so she continued on to Kapiti, and then on through Cook&#x27;s Straits to Tahiti.

In May, &quot;Zebra&quot; was at Keppel&#x27;s Island. There she found William Brown, J. Roberts (a negro), and all survivors of &quot;Port au Prince&quot;. Brown or Roberts was serving as the interpreter for the king there.

In August 1832 Lord Frederick Beauclerk (Acting) took command and paid &quot;Zebra&quot; off in Spring 1833.

Between February and September 1834, &quot;Zebra&quot; was at Chatham, fitting out. R. C. M&#x27;Crea assumed command in June and sailed for the East Indies on 24 September.

On 21 August 1835, &quot;Zebra&quot; was on her way from the Cocos (Keeling) Islands to the Swan River and west-south-west of Naturalite Bay when a strong squall threw the brig on its beam ends. Fortunately a port swung open, allowing the immense amount of water covering the weather coamings to escape, enabling her to right herself. The waves also threw two guns overboard; later M&#x27;Crae threw another two overboard as well to lighten &quot;Zebra&quot;. The bad weather continued, and on 27 August M&#x27;Crae threw the remaining eight cannon overboard. Two days later she reached Rottenest Island and eventually Fremantle. On 18 September 1834 he sailed for the Cape of Good Hope.

On the evening of 17 September 1836, &quot;Zebra&quot; on her way from Sydney to India when she anchored in Port Molle. Her sailing master, Lucius C. Bailey, gave a detailed description of its appeal as an anchorage. The next day, M&#x27;Crea examined Long Island Sound, finding it a good anchorage and an alternative to Port Molle if the winds blew strong from the north. They also remarked on the remains of the &quot;Valetta&quot;, which had wrecked there in 1825, and on a well the survivors had dug.

In 1837, M&#x27;Crae and &quot;Zebra&quot; engaged with Malay pirates. The East India Company awarded him a plate worth 100 guineas as a measure of their appreciation for his efforts. &quot;Zebra&quot; remained in the East Indies until early 1838 when she was ordered home.

===Mediterranean===
On 3 January 1839, Robert Fanshawe Stopford assumed command and sailed her to the Mediterranean. During Muhammad Ali&#x27;s revolt against the Ottoman Sultan and Ali&#x27;s subsequent invasion of Syria in what became known as the Oriental Crisis of 1840 or the Syrian War, &quot;Zebra&quot; served with the naval force in the Eastern Mediterranean under Charles Napier.

On 23 February 1840, Commander James John Stopford assumed command. On 5 May 1840, &quot;Zebra&quot; was in Malta for repairs. &quot;En route&quot; for Corfu, she had knocked off part of her false keel at Cape Blanco. On 19 July &quot;Zebra&quot; joined the first rate , the third rate , and the corvette in sailing for the Syrian coast. By 8 September, &quot;Zebra&quot; had sailed with Admiral Sir Robert Stopford&#x27;s fleet from Alexandria, which arrived at Beirut three days later. On 12 September her marines participated in the unsuccessful attack on the fortress at Gebail (Byblos) during which one of them was killed.

On 26 September 1840, &quot;Zebra&quot; joined &quot;Benbow&quot; and the sixth rate to cover an attack on Tortosa. The boats carrying the landing party grounded on a reef while under fire. The boats of the landing party could not get off before the landing party had suffered eight killed and eighteen wounded. This attack too was essentially unsuccessful, with &quot;Zebra&quot; suffering three or four men wounded.

&quot;Zebra&quot; was present at the capture of Acre and operated on the coast of Syria. The Navy awarded the Turkish Medal to participants in the campaign. On 16 October 1844, Parliament voted a grant to those on board the Royal Navy fleet from 9 September to 10 October 1840 and at the bombardment on 3 November of St Jean D&#x27;Acre.

==Fate==
On 2 December 1840, a heavy gale drove &quot;Zebra&quot; ashore off Mount Carmel near Haifa and wrecked her. During the evening, three crewmen jumped into a gig in an attempt to escape, but drowned when it capsized. In the morning a foreyard was placed over the gunwale that permitted the rest of the crew to reach shore safely.

The subsequent court martial on board acquitted Stopford, his officers, and his crew of any negligence. Rather, the board complimented them on their seamanlike and intrepid conduct.

<text>HMS &quot;Zebra&quot; was a Z-class destroyer. She was to have been named but was renamed in January 1943 before launching. The destroyer was launched on 18 March 1944 at William Denny &amp; Brothers shipyard in Dumbarton, Scotland and commissioned on 13 October 1944. She was &#x27;adopted&#x27; by the civil community of Urmston, then in the county of Lancashire.

==Design and construction==
The Z-class were War Emergency Programme destroyers, intended for general duties, including use as anti-submarine escort, and were to be suitable for mass-production. They were based on the hull and machinery of the pre-war J-class destroyers, but with a lighter armament (effectively whatever armament was available) in order to speed production. The Z-class of eight ships formed the 10th Emergency Flotilla, one of five flotillas of War Emergency destroyers ordered under the 1941 War Construction Programme (the U, V, W, Z and Ca-classes (40 destroyers)).

The Z-class were long overall, at the waterline and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of mean and full load. Displacement was standard and full load. Two Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers supplied steam at and to two sets of Parsons single-reduction geared steam turbines, which drove two propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at giving a maximum speed of and at full load. 615 tons of oil were carried, giving a range of at .

The ship had a main gun armament of four 4.5-inch (120 mm) QF Mk. IV guns, capable of elevating to an angle of 55 degrees, giving a degree of anti-aircraft capability, with the Z-class being the first class of destroyers to use the new gun. The close-in anti-aircraft armament was one Hazemayer stabilised twin mount for the Bofors 40 mm gun, and six Oerlikon 20 mm cannons (two twin and two single mounts, which was modified in 1945 by replacing two of the Oerlikons with two single 2-pounder (40 mm) &quot;pom-pom&quot; autocannon. Two quadruple mount for 21-inch (533 mm) torpedoes was fitted, while the ship had a depth charge outfit of four depth charge mortars and two racks, with a total of 70 charges carried. &quot;Zebra&quot; had a crew of 179 officers and other ranks.

The eight destroyers of the Z-class were ordered in February 1942, The ship that was to become &quot;Zebra&quot; was laid down at William Denny and Brothers&#x27;s Dumbarton shipyard on 14 May 1942 as &quot;Wakeful&quot;. The ship was renamed in January 1943, with the destroyer that was previously to be named &quot;Zebra&quot;, under construction at Fairfield&#x27;s was renamed at the same time. &quot;Zebra&quot; was launched on 8 March 1944 and completed on 13 October 1944, commissioning the same day. She was the sixth ship called &quot;Zebra&quot; to serve with the Royal Navy.

==Second World War==
After commissioning, &quot;Zebra&quot; underwent a period of working up before joining the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet based at Scapa Flow. Operational duties were delayed by a series of accidents, including a collision with the oiler &quot;San Castro&quot; on 3 October 1944 and with a jetty at Greenock on 15 October, and the destroyer was under repair at Glasgow from 25 November to 16 December 1944. Duties included screening duty and patrol on the North Western Approaches, along with She escorted a number of Arctic convoys, and other operations in the North Sea and off the coast of Scandinavia. On 1 January 1945, &quot;Zebra&quot; joined the escort for the Arctic convoy JW63, which had left Loch Ewe in Scotland on 30 December. She remained part of the convoy&#x27;s outer screen of escorts until it arrived unharmed at the Kola Inlet on 8 January. &quot;Zebra&quot; again formed part of the return convoy, Convoy RA 63, which left Kola on 11 January and arrived at Loch Ewe on 21 January. &quot;Zebra&quot; was meant to form part of the escort for the next outbound Arctic convoy, JW 64, but defects forced her to turn back and put into the Faroe Islands. After repair, on 11 February 1945, she formed part of the escort for the escort carriers and during Operation Selenium, a minelaying and anti shipping operation off the coast of Norway. From 26 to 27 February, &quot;Zebra&quot; reinforced the escort of the UK-bound Arctic convoy RA 64. &quot;Zebra&quot; underwent repairs and maintenance at Liverpool from 17 March to 15 May 1945. As the war reached its end &quot;Zebra&quot; was deployed with the Home Fleet to support operations to re-occupy countries previously under German occupation, and this included guardship duties.

==Postwar==
After the end of the war &quot;Zebra&quot; joined the 4th Destroyer Flotilla in which she served until 1947. The vessel was then paid-off and was reduced to reserve status in the Plymouth Reserve Fleet. During 1952 she was with the Harwich Reserve Fleet and returned to Plymouth a year later.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
The ship was nominated for conversion to an anti-submarine frigate and her main armament was to be removed. However, in 1955 this work was cancelled and the ship was placed on the Sale List. There were plans to transfer her to West Germany, but after inspection by West German officials the proposal was rejected due to her poor condition and she was sold to BISCO in 1958 for breaking-up at Newport, Monmouth by Cashmore. On 12 February 1959 she arrived in tow at the breakers yard.

<text>HMS &quot;Warspite&quot; was an first-class armoured cruiser, launched on 29 January 1884 and commissioned in 1886.

==Construction==
Morris states that &quot;Warspite&quot; had her sailing rig removed while building. The illustration of her with masts therefore shows her on trials, or is conjectural.

==Service history==
&quot;Warspite&quot; was the flagship on the Pacific Station between 1890 and 1893, then a port guard ship at Queenstown until 1896. From 1896 until 1902 she again served as the flagship of the Pacific Station. Captain Thomas Philip Walker was appointed in command in March 1899, when Rear-Admiral Henry Palliser was Commander-in-Chief of the station. In June 1899 she became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Lewis Beaumont, who kept Captain Walker as flag captain. The ship visited Coquimbo in March 1900. From late 1900 she was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Andrew Bickford, with Captain Colin Richard Keppel as flag captain in command of the ship. In late March 1902, Rear-Admiral Bickford transferred his flag to the newly arrived , and was joined by Captain Keppel. &quot;Warspite&quot; returned home under the command of Captain John Locke Marx (who had arrived on &quot;Grafton)&quot;, stopping at Bahia and São Vicente, Cape Verde on the way. She arrived at Plymouth on 28 May 1902, and paid off at Chatham on 1 July, when she was placed in the D Division of the Dockyard reserve and prepared for emergency service.
She was sold on 4 April 1904 to Thos. W. Ward of Preston. She arrived on the River Mersey on 3 October 1905 and then travelled on to Preston for breaking up.

<text>The latest HMS &quot;Warspite&quot; was the third of Britain&#x27;s nuclear-powered submarines, and the second (and final) of the . After entering service in 1967 she collided with a Soviet submarine the following year. A mechanical failure associated with the submarine&#x27;s nuclear reactor in 1991 led to the boat being laid up at HMNB Devonport where she awaits disposal.

==Operational history==
The second &quot;Valiant&quot;-class submarine, to be called &quot;Warspite&quot;, was ordered from Vickers-Armstrong&#x27;s Barrow shipyard on 12 December 1962, and was laid down on 10 December 1963. She was launched on 25 September 1965 by Mary Wilson, the wife of the then British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, and entered service on 18 April 1967.

In October 1968 whilst following a Soviet boat identified as an Echo II-class submarine, &quot;Warspite&quot; collided with the stern and propellers of that boat. &quot;Warspite&quot; suffered damage to her fin but after surfacing to inspect damage was able to submerge and return home, and later sail to Barrow for proper repairs. On 2 May 1976, &quot;Warspite&quot; was alongside in Liverpool, when she suffered a fire in her diesel generator room, in one of the most serious incidents the Royal Navy&#x27;s nuclear submarines have encountered. The fire filled the aft end of the submarine with dense smoke, making it very difficult for the submarine&#x27;s crew to monitor the status of the reactor, and &quot;Warspite&quot;″s commanding officer considered scuttling the submarine in the event that a reactor accident did develop. The fire was eventually extinguished with the aid of civilian firefighters from the Liverpool Fire Brigade after 4 hours. The submarine&#x27;s Marine Engineering Officer, Lieutenant Commander Tim Cannon, was one of three crew members awarded the Queen&#x27;s Gallantry Medal for their roles in the response to the fire. A further three crew members were awarded Queens Commendations for Brave Conduct 
&quot;Warspite&quot; underwent a two-year refit, which was nearing completion just as the Falklands War with Argentina started. After the war ended she carried out a record breaking patrol around the Falkland Islands and the Argentine coast. &quot;Warspite&quot; conducted the longest duration submerged submarine patrol made public from the dates of 25 November 1982 to 15 March 1983. A total of 111 days was spent submerged and unsupported, covering .

The submarine was decommissioned due to mechanical failure associated with the reactor in 1991. Mainly operated out of HMNB Clyde, at Faslane (the former Clyde Submarine Base) with the Third Submarine Squadron. Her hull and reactor are currently laid up afloat at Devonport Dockyard, Plymouth until facilities are available for the long-term storage of her radioactive components.

Notable commanders of this vessel include Sandy Woodward. Woodward went on to command the Falklands Conflict battle group, became Commander-in-Chief Naval Home Command and rose to the rank of admiral.

== Appearances in media ==
HMS &quot;Warspite&quot; was joined by a BBC film crew during NATO military exercise &#x27;Ocean Safari&#x27; in 1983. They documented the submarine&#x27;s role in the exercise as an enemy submarine, offering a detailed view of life on board for its crew. The program was broadcast on BBC One in January 1985, as part of a six-film series documenting the Royal Navy Submarine Service.

<text>HMS &quot;Upholder&quot; (P37) was a Royal Navy U-class submarine built by Vickers-Armstrong at Barrow-in-Furness. She was laid down on 30 October 1939, launched on 8 July 1940 by Mrs. Doris Thompson, wife of a director of the builders. The submarine was commissioned on 31 October 1940. She was one of four U-class submarines which had two external torpedo tubes at the bows in addition to the 4 internal ones fitted to all boats. They were excluded from the others because they interfered with depth-keeping at periscope depth.

==Career==
 She was commanded for her entire career by Lieutenant-Commander Malcolm David Wanklyn, and became the most successful British submarine of the Second World War. After a working up period, she left for Malta on 10 December 1940 and was attached to the 10th Submarine Flotilla based there. She completed 24 patrols, sinking 93,031 tons of enemy shipping including four warships; the destroyer after the Battle of the Duisburg Convoy, two submarines ( and ) and an auxiliary minesweeper, and ten merchant ships; three troopships, six cargo ships, and an auxiliary transport.

Wanklyn was awarded the Victoria Cross for a patrol in her in 1941, which included an attack on a particularly well-defended convoy on 24 May 1941 in which &quot;Upholder&quot; sank the Italian troop ship . On 28 July 1941 she damaged the (9500 tons). On 18 September 1941 she sank two troopships within hours of each other: the sister ships () and ().

&quot;Upholder&quot; also damaged the German freighter &quot;Duisburg&quot; (), the French tanker &quot;Capitaine Damiani&quot; (), the Italian freighters &quot;Dandolo&quot; () and &quot;Sirio&quot; () and destroyed the wreck of the German freighter &quot;Arta&quot; () already grounded after the battle of the Tarigo Convoy.

===Successes===
==Sinking==
&quot;Upholder&quot; was lost with all hands on her 25th patrol, which was to have been her last before she returned to England. She left for patrol on 6 April 1942 and became overdue on 14 April. On 12 April she was ordered, with and to form a patrol line to intercept a convoy, but it is not known whether she received the signal.

===Theories about her loss===

The most likely explanation for her loss is that after being spotted by a reconnaissance seaplane, she fell victim to depth charges dropped by the northeast of Tripoli on 14 April 1942 in the position , although no debris was seen on the surface. The attack was 100 miles northeast from Wanklyn&#x27;s patrol area and he may have changed position to find more targets. It is also possible that the submarine was sunk by a mine on 11 April 1942 near Tripoli, when a submarine was reported close to a minefield. A third and less likely theory came from an alleged air and surface attack on a submarine contact by German aircraft and the escort of a convoy on 14 April off Misrata, but no official Axis record of this action was found after the end of World War II.

More recent research carried out by Italian naval specialist Francesco Mattesini points to a German aerial patrol supporting the same convoy, comprising two Dornier Do 17 and two Messerschmitt Bf 110 aircraft, that attacked an underwater contact with bombs two hours before the &quot;Pegaso&quot; incident. The author also asserts that the seaplane crew was unsure if the target they pinpointed to &quot;Pegaso&quot; was a submarine or a school of dolphins. Mattesini admits the possibility that &quot;Pegaso&quot; could have finished off the submarine previously damaged by the German aircraft.

Canadian naval researcher Platon Alexiades has concluded that the &quot;Pegaso&quot; and German aircraft claims can be dismissed outright. Close examinations of British records show that submarine could not have been in the positions where these attacks occurred. Following an ULTRA intercept and a signal from Captain S.10 (the 10th flotilla commander), it is most likely HMS &quot;Upholder&quot; was lost on a mine as she was proceeding to intercept the Monreale/Unione convoy on 13 April. Her likely route would have brought her close to an Italian minefield laid by the destroyers and on 1st May 1941 (section d AN of the &quot;T&quot; minefield) some 15 miles north of Tripoli.

===Tribute===
When, on 22 August 1942, the Admiralty announced her loss, the communiqué carried with it an unusual tribute to Wanklyn and his men: &quot;It is seldom proper for Their Lordships to draw distinction between different services rendered in the course of naval duty, but they take this opportunity of singling out those of HMS &quot;Upholder&quot;, under the command of Lt.Cdr. David Wanklyn, for special mention. She was long employed against enemy communications in the Central Mediterranean, and she became noted for the uniformly high quality of her services in that arduous and dangerous duty. Such was the standard of skill and daring set by Lt.Cdr. Wanklyn and the officers and men under him that they and their ship became an inspiration not only to their own flotilla, but to the Fleet of which it was a part and to Malta, where for so long HMS &quot;Upholder&quot; was based. The ship and her company are gone, but the example and inspiration remain.&quot;
In all, &quot;Upholder&quot; was credited with having sunk 97,000 tons of enemy shipping, in addition to three U-boats and one destroyer.

Quoted by Admiral of the Fleet, The Lord Fieldhouse GCB, GBE probably during the Falklands War:
&quot;I can do no better than repeat the unique message following the sinking of HMS &quot;Upholder&quot; on April 14th 1942 : &#x27;The ship and her company are gone but the example and inspiration remain.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="1010393" wikidata="Q1459738" url="?curid=1010393" title="Macromanagement">
<text>Macromanagement is a style of leadership that is hands-off or from afar, allowing employees to have more freedom and control over their own work, while employers may shift their focus to strategic long-term goals.

Contrary to micromanagement, where managers closely observe and control the work of their employees, macromanagement is a more independent style of organizational management. Managers step back and give employees the freedom to do their job as they see fit, as long as the desired result is achieved. Micromanagement often focuses on short-term results, while macromanagement emphasizes long-term outcomes.

Both styles of management are viewed negatively when taken to an extreme. Therefore, it is important for organizations to develop a balance between micro- and macromanagement practices and understand when to apply each approach effectively. 

The downsides of macromanagement include a potential disconnect between managers and employees, as well as a lack of understanding regarding the roles and responsibilities of employees. These factors can contribute to an impression of bureaucracy within the workplace. 

Another interpretation of macromanagement is when an organization perceives itself as a social institution, aligning its goals and purpose with the aim of serving society. To achieve this, the organization ensures that its values, norms, and ethics are in harmony with those of the society in which it operates. 

In 1971, Alan Wells defined a social institution as “patterns of rules, customs, norms, beliefs and roles that are instrumentally related to the needs and purposes of society.” Other examples of social institutions in this respect include government and religious organizations, some more in-line with serving society that others. 

This interpretation of macromanagement is less about managing employees, but rather managing the organization from a broader perspective that is oriented toward the future. An organization that practices macromanagement greatly considers the future of the organization, the future of society, and their impact on one another.

<text>Carl Borivoj Presl (; 17 February 1794 – 2 October 1852) was a Czech botanist. 

==Biography==
Presl lived his entire life in Prague, and was a professor of botany at the University of Prague (1833–52). He made an expedition to Sicily in 1817, and with his brother, published a &quot;Flora bohemica&quot; titled &quot;Flora čechica: indicatis medicinalibus, oeconomicis technologicisque plantis&quot; in 1819.

His older brother Jan Svatopluk Presl was also a noted botanist; the journal &quot;Preslia&quot; of the Czech Botanical Society is named in their honor. The botanical genera &quot;Preslaea&quot; from the family Boraginaceae, (now a synonym of &quot;Euploca&quot; ) and &quot;Preslia&quot; of the family Lamiaceae (it is also now a synonym of &quot;Woodsia&quot; ) are dedicated to the two brothers. In 2006, botanists (Urb. &amp; Gilg) Weigend published &quot;Presliophytum&quot;, a genus of flowering plants from South America, belonging to the family Loasaceae which also honours Carl Borivoj Presl&#x27;s name.

He spent nearly 15 years producing the exsiccata &quot;Reliquiae Haenkeanae&quot; (published from 1825 to 1835), a work based on botanical specimens collected in the Americas by Thaddaeus Haenke.

<doc id="1010410" wikidata="Q5056682" url="?curid=1010410" title="Cedar Fire">
<text>The Cedar Fire was a massive, highly-destructive wildfire, which burned of land in San Diego County, California, during October and November 2003. The fire&#x27;s rapid growth was driven by the Santa Ana winds, causing the fire to spread at a rate of per hour. By the time the fire was fully contained on November 4, it had destroyed 2,820 buildings (including 2,232 homes) and killed 15 people, including one firefighter. Hotspots continued to burn within the Cedar Fire&#x27;s perimeter until December 5, 2003, when the fire was fully brought under control.

The fire remains one of the largest wildfires in California history and, as of January 2022, the ninth-largest wildfire in the state&#x27;s modern history. According to CALFIRE, it is also the sixth-deadliest and fourth-most destructive wildfire in state history, causing just over $1.3 billion in damages. In November 2018, the Camp Fire (2018) surpassed the Tubbs Fire (which had previously surpassed the 1991 Oakland Firestorm and the Cedar Fire) to become the single most destructive wildfire in California history, in terms of the number of buildings destroyed. In December 2017, the Thomas Fire surpassed the Cedar Fire to become California&#x27;s largest modern wildfire on record, before the Mendocino Complex Fire&#x27;s Ranch Fire surpassed both fires to become the state&#x27;s largest wildfire in August 2018.

==Fire progression==

The Cedar Fire began in the Cuyamaca Mountains within the Cleveland National Forest. It was first reported at 5:37p.m. PDT on October 25, 2003, to the south of Ramona in central San Diego County. At the time it began, at least eleven other wildfires were actively burning in Southern California. Within ten minutes of the initial report, the U.S. Forest Service had deployed 10 fire engines, two water tenders, two hand crews and two chief officers. Within 30 minutes, 320 firefighters and six fire chiefs were en route. An ASTREA helicopter of the San Diego County Sheriff&#x27;s Department that was rescuing a hunter spotted the fire at about the same time as the first phone report was received and called for an air response. Another sheriff&#x27;s helicopter equipped with a Bambi Bucket was dispatched to drop water on the fire. When the helicopter was only minutes away from the fire, a Forest Service fire chief cancelled the water drop because policy required the cutoff of aerial firefighting 30 minutes before sunset, a decision which was later severely criticized by the public, media, and other elected officials.

Between the time the fire started and midnight the predicted strong easterly Santa Ana winds surfaced and the fire burned approximately 5,319 acres. By 3:00a.m., had burned. Overnight, the fast-moving fire killed 12 people living in Wildcat Canyon and Muth Valley in the northern part of Lakeside, who had little or no warning that the fire was approaching. The fire destroyed 39 homes on the Barona Indian Reservation. In only a few hours, the Cedar Fire pushed southwest over and burned over at rates of up to per hour. The fire also crossed several large highways, including Interstate 15, and by noon on October 26, the fire was burning hundreds of homes in the Scripps Ranch community of San Diego, and was threatening many others.

On October 26, the fire forged into Alpine, Harbison Canyon, Lake Jennings and Crest, burning hundreds more homes in areas that had been devastated by the Laguna Fire 33 years earlier. By October 28, the strong easterly Santa Ana winds died down and the fire turned east, consuming another . The entire community of Cuyamaca, most of nearby Cuyamaca Rancho State Park, and more than 500 homes surrounding the town of Julian were destroyed.

On October 29, a group of firefighters attempting to defend a house in Riverwood Estates, near Santa Ysabel, became entrapped and overrun by the fire. One firefighter died. Another firefighter sustained severe injuries, and two others were hurt. Firefighters finally achieved full containment of the Cedar Fire on November 3, and the Cedar Fire was completely brought under control on December 5.

==Impacts==
In the wake of the 2003 firestorm, including the Cedar Fire, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger (Gray Davis was still governor) declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard to assist in the disaster relief process. President George W. Bush declared Los Angeles, San Bernardino, San Diego and Ventura counties major disaster areas. Air travel in and around the region was also disrupted due to the effect on air traffic control radar.

San Diego&#x27;s Qualcomm Stadium was used as an evacuation site, forcing the NFL to move the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game on October 27 between the San Diego Chargers and Miami Dolphins to Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona. The decision to move the game to Arizona was made less than 24 hours before the game started, and admission was free.

==Investigation==
Investigators determined that the fire was started by Sergio Martinez of West Covina, California, a novice hunter who was unprepared for the local back country and had become disorientated after venturing into &quot;thick and tall&quot; brush. Martinez initially told investigators that he had fired a shot from his rifle to draw attention and that &quot;sparks&quot; from the shot had caused the fire.

After gathering branches and other flammable brush together, Martinez intentionally lit a large fire that he quickly lost control of, spreading to the surrounding &quot;Chaparral brush. The daily high temperature combined with low humidity &amp; low moisture content of the highly flammable chaparral were ideal for a wildfire. At 8 p.m. local time the predicted evening Santa Ana winds blew hot and dry desert air from the east westward though the rugged terrain fanning the intense flames westward towards the residential areas of San Diego.

Two local Sheriff deputies searched for Martinez in a helicopter. They found him disoriented and confused, but apologized for starting the fire while being transported in the helicopter. 

Martinez was charged in federal court on October7, 2004 with setting the wildfire and lying about its cause to investigators. In November 2005, as part of a plea deal a federal judge sentenced Martinez to six months in a work-furlough program and ordered him to complete 960 hours (40 days) of community service. He also was sentenced to five years&#x27; probation and to pay $9,000 in restitution. As part of the plea bargain, prosecutors dropped the charge of lying to investigators.

==Criticism of the response==
===Outdated policies===
There were a number of controversies associated with the Cedar Fire, resulting in investigations lasting several years. A report, the &quot;2003 San Diego County Fire Siege Fire Safety Review&quot;, prepared in the wake of the fire and presented to the Governor&#x27;s Blue Ribbon Fire Commission, criticized the overall response. The report stated that though the fire conditions and severity should have been expected, the responsible agencies were not properly prepared when the fire broke out, and radio communications problems exacerbated the problem. The report stated that &quot;Disorganization, inconsistent or outdated policies among agencies that grounded aircraft or caused other problems, and planning or logistics in disarray also marked the preliminary stages of the difficult, dangerous firefighting.&quot; With multiple fires already burning in the state, many local crews were already headed north to fight other fires and could not be recalled to assist with the Cedar Fire.

===Forest Service issues===
The turning away of the Sheriff&#x27;s helicopters by the U.S. Forest Service in the fire&#x27;s early stages came under severe criticism by the public, media and elected officials, believing that an opportunity to prevent the fire from becoming out of control had been lost. The federal government has an aviation assets &quot;cutoff&quot; policy which stated that &quot;aircraft (planes or helicopters) may not be dispatched so as to arrive at an incident no later than 30 minutes before sunset&quot;. The helicopter pilot later claimed he could have made multiple water drops in the time he had before darkness. However, a study conducted by the Forest Service concluded that even if the helicopter had been able to drop multiple loads of water with direct hits on the flames, the impact on the fire would have been minimal.

Cutoff also prevented two air tankers and a helicopter stationed at Ramona Airport from being dispatched to the fire, although the tankers likely could not have been used anyway as the pilots had just spent seven hours fighting another fire, and FAA regulations stipulated that they could not continue to fly.

===California Department of Forestry issues===
A contributing factor to the initial lack of aviation resources to fight the fire was the California Department of Forestry&#x27;s &quot;no divert&quot; policy, which allows incident commanders to dedicate certain resources to a particular fire; the policy applied to both airborne aircraft as well as those on the ground awaiting dispatch. At the time that the Cedar Fire started, there were already 11 other fires burning in the region. Aviation resources in the area were currently being held on the ground under a &quot;no divert&quot; declaration, in order to be available for structures&#x27; protection on another fire. However, weather and visibility at the other fire was precluding their use, so the aircraft sat idle, despite the fact that conditions were acceptable for their use on the Cedar Fire.

Both the media and local elected officials were also critical of the lack of use of military aviation assets located nearby at Camp Pendleton and Miramar. The U.S. Marine Corps operates CH-46 Sea Knight and CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters that can carry water-dropping buckets, but existing policies prohibited their use until all other civilian resources were used. Additionally, the military aircraft radios were not compatible with those used by most state and local fire agencies, and the military pilots had not received any training in fire-specific operations, making them a potential safety hazard both to firefighters on the ground and other aircraft over the fire.

==Fatalities==
Fifteen people, including one firefighter, were killed by the fire. A survivor, Rudy Reyes, was burned over approximately 70% of his body. Many of those killed were trapped by the flames which were driven by winds that propelled the flames faster than residents could flee. Of those killed, 13 died in the first 24 hours of the fire. At least 10 people were trapped in their vehicles trying to outrun the flames. Some of those killed were so badly burned their remains were identified based on the dog tags of pets lying dead near them. On October 29, fire overran an engine crew from the Novato Fire District near the town of Julian. Engineer Steven Rucker sustained fatal injuries, while the three other members of the crew were able to take shelter in a house.

<doc id="1010421" wikidata="Q1054031" url="?curid=1010421" title="Smart File System">
<text>The Smart File System (SFS) is a journaling filesystem used on Amiga computers and AmigaOS-derived operating systems (though some support also exists for IBM PC compatibles). It is designed for performance, scalability and integrity, offering improvements over standard Amiga filesystems as well as some special or unique features.

== Features ==
SFS uses block sizes ranging from 512 (29) to 32768 (215) bytes with a maximum partition size of 128 GB.
Its good performance, better than FFS, and lack of need for long &quot;validation&quot; in case of an error, is achieved by grouping multiple directory entries into a single block and by grouping meta data blocks together into clusters. A bitmap is used to keep track of free space, and file data is kept track of using extents arranged into a B+ tree structure.

Integrity is maintained by keeping a transaction log of all changes made to metadata over a certain period of time. The log is written to disk first into free space and then meta data blocks are overwritten directly. Should the system crash, the next time the filesystem is mounted it will notice the uncompleted operation and roll it back to the last known consistent state. For performance reasons, only metadata integrity is ensured. Actual data in files can still be corrupted if a write operation is terminated halfway through. Unlike the original Amiga filesystems, FFS and OFS, filesystem integrity is very rarely compromised by this.

One feature of SFS that is almost unique among Amiga filesystems is its ability to defragment itself while the filesystem is in use, even for locked files. The defragmentation process is almost completely stateless (apart from the location it is working on), which means it can be stopped and started instantly. During defragmentation data integrity is ensured of both meta data and normal data. The filesystem may attempt to move a whole file to a different location when fragmentation is going to occur otherwise.

The filesystem offers a directory containing deleted files for recovery.

== History ==
SFS is written in C and was originally created and released as freeware in 1998 by John Hendrikx. After the original author left the Amiga scene in 2000, the source code to SFS was released and its development continued by Ralph Schmidt in MorphOS.

Since May 2005 SFSobjec and SFSconfig are available under the GPL license. SFS development has now forked; as well as the original Amiga version, there are now versions for MorphOS, AROS, AmigaOS 3, and a version for AmigaOS 4, which have different feature sets but remain compatible to each other. In addition, there is a driver for Linux to read (experimental to write) Amiga SFS volumes, GRUB natively supports it, and there are free drivers to use it from UEFI.

, SFS was one of the independent filesystems still being used on Amiga computers.

Versions for AROS, AmigaOS and MorphOS are based on different branches. The Linux version is independent code.

<text>Saxegothaea is a genus comprising a single species, Saxegothaea conspicua. It is a conifer in the podocarp family Podocarpaceae, native to southern South America. It grows in Chile and Argentina from 35° to 46° South latitude; in its northernmost natural distribution it grows between 800 and 1000 (2600–3300 ft) m above sea level and in the south it lives at sea level. The species is most often known by its genus name, or sometimes as female maniu (a translation of its name in Spanish) and Prince Albert&#x27;s yew; in South America it is known as mañío hembra or maniú hembra.

The genus name of &quot;Saxegothaea&quot; is in honour of Franz August Carl Albert Emanuel von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha (1819–1861), who was the consort of Queen Victoria from their marriage on 10 February 1840 until his death in 1861. Lindley wrote &quot;This remarkable plant, to which His Royal Highness Prince Albert has been pleased to permit one of his titles to be given, and which will probably rank among the most highly valued of our hardy evergreen trees, is a native of the mountains of Patagonia, where it was found by Mr. William Lobb, forming a beautiful tree 30 feet high.&quot; When he published the plant in J. Hort. Soc. London vol.6 on page 258 in 1851.

It is a slow-growing, long-lived evergreen tree growing to 15–25 m (50–80 ft) tall, with a trunk up to 1 m in diameter. The bark is thin and flaky to scaly, dark purple-brown. The leaves are arranged in an irregular spiral; they are lanceolate, 1.5–3 cm long, 2 mm broad, fairly hard with a prickly spine tip, dark green above, and with two glaucous blue-white stomatal bands below. The cones are 1 cm long, with 15-20 soft scales; usually only 2-4 scales on each cone are fertile, bearing a single seed 3 mm in diameter.

&quot;Saxegothaea&quot; is endemic to the Valdivian temperate rain forests of southern Chile and adjacent parts of Argentina, where it is generally found in association with &quot;Pilgerodendron uviferum&quot; and &quot;Fitzroya cupressoides&quot;.

The wood has a good quality and is used in furniture and barrels.

<text>&quot;The Poet&quot; is an essay by U.S. writer Ralph Waldo Emerson, written between 1841 and 1843 and published in his &quot;&quot; in 1844. It is not about &quot;men of poetical talents, or of industry and skill in meter, but of the true poet.&quot; Emerson begins the essay with the premise that man is naturally incomplete, since he &quot;is only half himself, the other half is his expression.&quot;
Emerson says that a poet represents humanity, as one that acknowledges interdependence between the material and spiritual world:

In the essay, Emerson expresses the need for the United States to have its own new and unique poet to write about the new country&#x27;s virtues and vices:
The final lines in the essay read as follows:
==Insights==
The essay offers a profound look at the poem and its role in society. In a paragraph mid-essay, Emerson observes:
==Influence==
The essay played an instrumental role in the 1855 appearance of the first edition of Walt Whitman&#x27;s collection of poems, &quot;Leaves of Grass.&quot; After reading the essay, Whitman consciously set out to answer Emerson&#x27;s call. When the book was first published, Whitman sent a copy to Emerson, whose letter in response helped launch the book to success. In that letter Emerson called the collection &quot;the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom America has yet contributed&quot;.

<doc id="1010442" wikidata="Q445839" url="?curid=1010442" title="Fumiko Hayashi (author)">
<text>was a Japanese writer of novels, short stories and poetry, who has repeatedly been included in the feminist literature canon. Among her best-known works are &quot;Diary of a Vagabond&quot;, &quot;Late Chrysanthemum&quot; and &quot;Floating Clouds&quot;.

==Biography==
Hayashi was born in Moji-ku, Kitakyūshū, Japan, and raised in abject poverty. In 1910, her mother Kiku Hayashi divorced her merchant husband Mayaro Miyata (who was not Fumiko&#x27;s biological father) and married Kisaburo Sawai. The family then worked as itinerant merchants in Kyūshū.

After graduating from high school in 1922, Hayashi moved to Tokyo and lived with several men, supporting herself with a variety of jobs, before settling into marriage with painting student Rokubin Tezuka in 1926. During this time, she also helped launch the poetry magazine &quot;Futari&quot;. Her autobiographical novel &quot;Diary of a Vagabond&quot; (&quot;Hōrōki&quot;), published in 1930, became a bestseller and gained her high popularity. Many of her subsequent works also showed an autobiographical background, like &quot;The Accordion and the Fish Town&quot; or &quot;Seihin no sho&quot;. In the following years, Hayashi travelled to China and Europe.

Starting in 1938, Hayashi, who had joined the &quot;Pen butai&quot; (&quot;Pen corps&quot;), war correspondents who were in favour of Japan&#x27;s militarist regime, wrote reports about the Sino-Japanese War. In 1941, she joined a group of women writers, including Ineko Sata, who went to Manchuria in occupied China. In 1942–43, again as part of a larger group of women writers, she travelled to Southeast Asia, where she spent eight months in the Andaman Islands, Singapore, Java and Borneo. In later years, Hayashi faced criticism for collaborating with state-sponsored wartime propaganda, but, unlike Sata, never apologised or rationalised her behaviour.

Writer Yoshiko Shibaki observed a shift from poetic sentiment towards harsh reality in Hayashi&#x27;s post-war work, which depicted the effects of the war on the lives of its survivors, as in the short story &quot;Downtown&quot;. In 1948, she was awarded the 3rd Women Literary Award for her short story &quot;Late Chrysanthemum&quot; (&quot;Bangiku&quot;). Her last novel &quot;Meshi&quot;, which appeared in serialised form in the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot;, remained unfinished due to her sudden death.

Hayashi died of myocardial infarction on June 28, 1951, survived by her husband and her adopted son. Her funeral was officiated by writer and friend Yasunari Kawabata. Hayashi&#x27;s house in Shinjuku Ward, Tokyo, was later turned into a museum, the Hayashi Fumiko Memorial Hall. In Onomichi, where Hayashi had lived in her teen years, a bronze figure was erected in her memory.

==Themes and legacy==
Many of Hayashi&#x27;s stories revolve around free spirited women and troubled relationships. Joan E. Ericson&#x27;s 1997 translations and analysis of the immensely popular &quot;Diary of a Vagabond&quot; and &quot;Narcissus&quot; suggest that Hayashi&#x27;s appeal is rooted in the clarity with which she conveys the humanity not just of women, but also others on the underside of Japanese society. In addition, Ericson questions the factuality of her autobiographical writings and expresses a critical view of scholars who take these writings by word instead of, as has been done with male writers, seeing a literary imagination at work which transforms the personal experience, not simply mirrors it.

In &quot;Japanese Women Writers: Twentieth Century Short Fiction&quot;, Noriko Mizuta Lippit and Kyoko Iriye Selden point out that, other than her autobiographical portrayals of women, Hayashi&#x27;s later stories are &quot;pure fiction finished with artistic mastery&quot;. Hayashi herself explained that she took this step to separate herself from the &quot;retching confusion&quot; of &quot;Diary of a Vagabond&quot;.

Her writings have been translated into English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Finnish and other languages.

<text>The Ana G. Méndez University (UAGM / AGMU) is a private university system with its main campus in San Juan, Puerto Rico that participates in the Puerto Rico Space Grant Consortium.

==History==
On January 2, 2019, Metropolitan University, University of Turabo and Universidad del Este merged into a single university of campuses to form Universidad Ana G. Méndez.

On December 15, 2023, the American Veterinary Association (AVMA) Council on Higher Education (COE) granted UAGM, Gurabo Campus&#x27; Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program a Letter of Reasonable Assurance, authorizing the School of Veterinary Medicine to admit the first cohort for the first, and only, degree of Doctor of Veterinary Medicine in the history of Puerto Rico. If the university meet the council&#x27;s reasonable assurance performance standards, the AVMA-COE will grant the university&#x27;s School of Veterinary Medicine Provisional Accreditation status, allowing graduates from the first cohort and all others thereafter to sit for the International Council for Veterinary Assessment (ICVA) North America Veterinary Licensing Examination (NAVLE).

The first 80-student cohort&#x27;s White Coat Ceremony was held on Saturday, September 28, 2024, on the premises of the School of Veterinary Medicine and future Veterinary Teaching Hospital grounds at UAGM, Gurabo campus. 

The university also transmits over the air across the broadband via WMTJ (PSIP virtual channel 40, ultra high frequency digital channel 15), a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) television station. The satellite communications transmission of WMTJ carriers over the spectrum with the call sign WQTO (PSIP virtual channel 26, ultra high frequency digital channel 19), transmitting at an Effective Radiated Power of six hundred ninety-six kilo lumens or Watts. Sistema television studios for «&quot;transmitting the good&quot;» are located at Rio Piedras in San Juan with the call sign&#x27;s acronym standing for &quot;Méndez Television San Juan&quot;. 

===University of Turabo===

University of Turabo (now the Gurabo campus) was established in 1972. In 1974 it earned accreditation from the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools and the Puerto Rico Higher Education Council.

In 2004, it began the doctoral program in Environmental Sciences and the advent of the Strategic Plan for Scientific Research. Today, enrollment exceeds 15,000 students of which over 450 are doctoral level.

In 2018, the National Science Foundation announced a partnership between the University of Turabo and the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source at Cornell University (CHESS).

It offered academic studies from technical certificates to doctorates degrees in seven schools: Engineering, Science and Technology, Health Sciences, Education, Business and Administration, Design and Architecture, and Social Sciences.

===Metropolitan University===
The Metropolitan University —or Universidad Metropolitana (UMET) in Spanish— is a private, non-profit, and secular university system in Puerto Rico which is now part of the Ana G. Mendez University. It has five campuses:
*Aguadilla
*Bayamón
*San Juan (now Cupey Campus) is the main campus and usually referred to as the Metropolitan University itself as it was the first campus and is the largest one.

===Universidad del Este===

Universidad del Este (UNE) was a private non-profit institution of higher education. Founded in 1949 as Puerto Rico Junior College, it grew into a four-year institution in 1992 and finally evolved into a university in 2001. Universidad del Este offered occupational, liberal arts, education, health, science and business programs leading to certificates, associate, bachelor, and master&#x27;s degree programs in different disciplines. Its main campus was located in Carolina, Puerto Rico. The university also maintained five off-campus sites located in Yauco, Utuado, Cabo Rojo, Manatí and Santa Isabel. In August 2003, Universidad del Este established its first branch campus, Metro Orlando University Center located in Orlando, Florida.

==Campuses==
The Ana G. Méndez University system has campuses in the following cities in Puerto Rico and mainland United States.

===Gurabo campus===
The Gurabo campus, usually referred to as &quot;&quot;el Turabo&quot;,&quot; consists of two central campuses —main and Navarro— alongside a series of island-wide satellite campuses. The main campus covers with a diversity of open spaces, malls, modern and historic structures, and a healthy distribution of amphitheatre-and-boutique common study/collaborative/collective spaces/areas. The university also hosts a comprehensive sports programme complete with its respective gymnasia, weight room, track &amp; field arena, swimming pool, baseball fields, tennis complex, basketball and volleyball courts, and a series of fountains and gardens to elevate enlightenment to the fullest — &quot;Había sequía en el Turabo y ahora se acabó la sequía. Ganamos&quot;. The campus&#x27; academic offering is organized across seven academic divisions:

* Liberal Arts
* Health Sciences
* Science and Technology
* Engineering, Design &amp; Architecture
* Naturopathic Medicine
* School of Veterinary Medicine
* Business, Tourism &amp; Entrepreneurship

====Museums and libraries====
The central university library is located at the main campus in Abelardo Díaz Alfaro Hall. It hosts the campus&#x27; central repository and circulation of information both analogue and digital, distributed over the structure with two computing centres spanning the main floor. The Vice-chancellorship of Information Resources is located on the building&#x27;s upper east side, the stairways leading to the top floor midway canvasing the entire width and wide reflecting the history culture and soul of Cariba&#x27;s society. Also on the upper floor there are five special collections reading rooms altogether encompassing: The Edgardo Rodríguez Juliá Room, Francisco Manrique Cabrera Room, García Passalacqua-Acosta Room, Ivonne Acosta Lespier Room, and José Luis González Room. From time to time, Abelardo Díaz Alfaro Hall propagates its walls with exhibitions from faculty and students alike. The works of David Méndez Pagán, the current rector, have been exhibited in Abelardo Díaz Alfaro&#x27;s hall.

There is a library-museum named after the former governor of Puerto Rico, Pedro Rosselló, as &quot;Biblioteca Museo Dr. Pedro Rosselló&quot;, which includes a museum, library, studying area, and an auditorium. Of the most memorable items curated at the museum is the Governor&#x27;s laptop, on whose keypads he redacted many of his diligent works.

There are also two museums within the Centre for Humanistic Studies on the campus&#x27; southwest end. On the top floor, a museum of anthropology and archeology curating and hosting exhibitions of archeological historical artifacts. But perhaps the most precious item in the collection is Ana G. Méndez desk, exhibited in the central room of the first floor.

====Puerto Rico Energy Centre (PREC)====

The Puerto Rico energy center is dedicated to advancing Puerto Rico&#x27;s energy efficiency and clean energy use through research, technology transfer, education and demonstration. Its mission is to contribute to the creation of knowledge in alternative and renewable energy, as well as in energy efficiency practices and technologies, and to promote the use of alternative resources to contribute to the conservation of the environment and the sustainable development of Puerto Rico, the Antilles and the World.

In order to foster graduate and undergraduate research practicums and intercontinental engineering-research-scientific collaboration, the centre leads a consortium of nationwide universities and national laboratories including Sandia, one if not the school of engineering founding father.

==Athletics==
The university offers athletic scholarships to outstanding freshman athletes with strong academic potential in swimming, basketball, volleyball, cross country, and others. It has participated in the Puerto Rico Inter-university Athletics League (LAI) (Spanish: Liga Atlética Interuniversitaria de Puerto Rico) since 1975.

<doc id="1010445" wikidata="Q2476047" url="?curid=1010445" title="Underdevelopment">
<text>Underdevelopment, in the context of international development, reflects a broad condition or phenomena defined and critiqued by theorists in fields such as economics, development studies, and postcolonial studies. Used primarily to distinguish states along benchmarks concerning human development—such as macro-economic growth, health, education, and standards of living—an &quot;underdeveloped&quot; state is framed as the antithesis of a &quot;developed&quot;, modern, or industrialized state. Popularized, dominant images of underdeveloped states include those that have less stable economies, less democratic political regimes, greater poverty, malnutrition, and poorer public health and education systems.

Underdevelopment per Walter Rodney is primarily made of two components, a comparative aspect as well the relationship of exploitation: namely, the exploitation of one country by another.

==History==

In critical development and postcolonial studies, the concepts of &quot;development&quot;, &quot;developed&quot;, and &quot;underdevelopment&quot; are often thought of to have origins in two periods: first, the colonial era, where colonial powers extracted labor and natural resources, and second (most often) in referring development as the postwar project of intervention on the so-called Third World. Mexican activist Gustavo Esteva asserted that underdevelopment began when American president Harry Truman delivered his inaugural address in 1949 since, after the second world war, poverty on a mass scale was suddenly &quot;discovered&quot; in these underdeveloped regions of the world. Esteva stated: &quot;On that day two billion people became underdeveloped.&quot; More than half of the world&#x27;s nations were categorized by what they lacked. The Euro-centric development discourse and its aura of expertise often conflated development with economic growth. When the world began to categorize nations based on their economic status, it narrowed the issue of underdevelopment to an economics problem. As a result, the solutions brought forth by development experts and practitioners were squarely economic—failing to address the profound political and social contexts such as colonial legacies and Cold War geopolitics.

=== The Green Revolution ===
The Green Revolution is a paradigm of a concerted effort of intervention in the name of global development. During this time, developed countries, in an attempt to modernize the global agricultural sector, sought to export the industrial agricultural model of production. At the start of the Green Revolution, the U.S., Canada, and other advanced European countries were giving their surplus crops to poorer countries in the form of food aid in order to mitigate widespread hunger that parts of the postcolonial world was then witnessing. Crops that weren&#x27;t previously prevalent across the globe, such as wheat, were being transferred and from the global north to south in massive quantities. This occurred until developing countries, such as India, became heavily dependent on the food aid—much of which were crops that could not be grown locally. In order for dependent countries to keep receiving foreign assistance, the U.S. made it conditional for recipients of food-aid to adopt the whole industrial model of agriculture.

The revolution was titled “Green” not just because of its connections to agriculture but also was used as a tool to fight the “Red”, or communist revolution. The West believed that hunger had the power to drive people to peasant revolutions, so food aid was used explicitly to fight the spread communism. While efforts were made to increase food security in poor nations by helping them move to being self-sufficient, the industrial model of agriculture that was exported to recipient countries had a complex system of necessary inputs. In order for yields to actually increase, farmers needed fertilizers, pesticides, and new irrigation systems, a costly chain of requirements that cut profits for the farmers even when their yields rose. The countries that were dependent on food aid now became dependent on the transnational corporations that provided agricultural inputs that the industrial model required. The Green Revolution was able to increase crop yields (at least in the short term, before land was degraded by the increased need for fertilizers and pesticides), but in the process it exacerbated vulnerable populations&#x27; poverty in countries that are now considered underdeveloped.

==Theories and explanations==

Several theories and types of explanation have been offered to explain why some countries have been underdeveloped and/or how their development may occur.

=== Geographical explanations ===
Seminal economist Adam Smith surmised not only that a nation&#x27;s prosperity depends on free markets, but also that coastal geography - easy access to sea trade - plays an important part. Compared with Europe, large proportions of Africa, Asia and the Americas are far from the ocean. Jeffrey Sachs and his collaborators have demonstrated this relationship of geography with underdevelopment more systematically, pointing out that this relationship is also mediated by factors of agricultural productivity and disease prevalence.

Jared Diamond has proposed that continental alignment also played a part: the east–west alignment of Europe-Asia allowed diffusion of useful agricultural species, while the north–south alignments of the Americas and Africa inhibited such diffusion.

===Modernization theory===
One of the first major theories to surface as a solution to this new issue of “underdevelopment” was the modernization theory. This highlights the positive role played by Western countries in modernizing and facilitating development in the non-West. It is often contrasted with dependency theory.

The theory of modernization consists of three parts:
* A hierarchical identification of nations or societies, and explanation of how those designated as &quot;modernized&quot; or relatively modernized differ from others
* Specification of how societies become modernized, comparing factors that are more or less conducive to transformation
* Generalizations about how the parts of a modernized society fit together, involving stages of modernization and ideal types of successfully modernized countries

In the mid-20th century, the world leaders that had emerged from the Second World War saw the former colonies as areas that needed increasing amounts of intervention because their populations were the subjects of much suffering. It became a moral imperative for developed nations, primarily the U.S., to offer assistance so that these countries could industrialize the way the countries of the first world had. The modernization theory, growing out of U.S. scholarship, equated modernization with industrialization, development, and progress.

One of the most notable contributors to the theory was Walt Whitman Rostow who developed an economic model which outlined five stages of growth for nations to follow in his essay, “The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto”.

Rostow&#x27;s Five Stages:
# The Traditional Society
# The Preconditions for take-off
# The Take-off
# The Drive to Maturity
# The Age of High Mass Consumption

These stages present a linear trajectory of development in a which the traditional society, exhibiting feudal and “backward” characteristics, can transform into a modern society with advanced industries and urban societies. By placing national growth on a linear path to modernization and hails industrialization as the key to development, Rostow&#x27;s model simplifies complex inequality between nations by claiming that (since various nations began the process of development at different time periods) different societies are simply at different stages of growth. Rostow&#x27;s model makes the assumption that the inequality between states will eventually disappear once each progresses on the timeline of modernity—sped up, he argued, through contact with modernized cultures and their modern economic and political models.

===Dependency theory===
Dependency theory reflects the body of mid-20th century theories by various intellectuals, both from the Third World and the First World, that suggest that the wealthy nations of the world need a subjugated peripheral group of poorer states in order to remain wealthy. Dependency theory states that the poverty of the countries in the periphery is not because they are &quot;not&quot; integrated into the world system, but because of &quot;how&quot; they are integrated into the system.

These poor nations provide natural resources, cheap labor, and consumer markets for the wealthy nations, without which, according to dependency theorists, they could not have the standard of living they enjoy. First world nations actively, but not necessarily consciously, perpetuate a state of dependency through various policies and initiatives. This state of dependency is multifaceted, involving economics, media control, politics, banking and finance, education, sport and all aspects of human resource development. Any attempt by the dependent nations to resist the influences of dependency could result in economic sanctions and/or military invasion and control. This is rare, however, and dependency is enforced far more by the wealthy nations setting the rules of international trade and commerce.

Dependency theory first emerged in the 1950s, advocated by Raul Prebisch whose research found that the wealth of poor nations tended to decrease when the wealth of rich nations increased. The theory quickly divided into diverse schools. Some, most notably Andre Gunder Frank and Walter Rodney adapted it to Marxism. &quot;Standard&quot; dependency theory differs sharply from Marxism, however, arguing against internationalism and any hope of progress in less developed nations towards industrialization and a liberating revolution. Former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso wrote extensively on dependency theory while in political exile. The American sociologist Immanuel Wallerstein refined the Marxist aspect of the theory, and called it the &quot;world system.&quot; World system theory adds another layer to what dependency theorists describe as the structure of the world: the semi-periphery. The semi-periphery is composed of countries such as Brazil and South Africa that can&#x27;t simply be categorized as part of the core or the periphery (i.e. they have developed urban areas but also large areas of rural poverty). World systems theory also states that the dynamic of surplus extraction that occurs between nations also occurs within them, between their elite and poor classes. According to this structure, which includes a core, a periphery, and a semi-periphery, not every nation can develop simultaneously (which directly challenges the linear model of modernization which suggests that all countries are on the trajectory of development). WST instead argues that development and underdevelopment are created simultaneously.

According to Brazilian social scientist, Theotonio Dos Santos, dependence means a situation in which certain countries economies&#x27; are conditioned by the development and expansion of another to which the former is subject. He goes on to further clarify that the interdependence of two or more economies, and consequently world trade, assumes the form of dependence when dominant countries can create dependency only as a reflection of that expansion, which can have a negative effect on the subordinate&#x27;s immediate economy.

Guyanese Marxist historian and political activist and one of the leading theorists on underdevelopment Walter Rodney contends in reference to Africa&#x27;s underdevelopment, &quot;The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism and its negative consequences for Africa spring mainly from the fact that Africa lost power. Power is the ultimate determinant in human society, being basic to the relations within any group and between groups. It implies the ability to defend one&#x27;s interests and if necessary to impose one&#x27;s will by any means available. In relations between peoples, the question of power determines maneuverability in bargaining, the extent to which a people survive as a physical and cultural entity. When one society finds itself forced to relinquish power entirely to another society, that in itself is a form of underdevelopment&quot;.

Rodney also elaborates on his broader theory of underdevelopment and the issues of using the term especially in reference to comparing economies, saying &quot;Actually, if &#x27;underdevelopment&#x27; were related to anything other than comparing economies, then the most underdeveloped country in the world would be the U.S.A, which practices external oppression on a massive scale, while internally there is a blend of exploitation, brutality, and psychiatric disorder.&quot;

<doc id="1010451" wikidata="Q1164499" url="?curid=1010451" title="RMS Alcantara (1913)">
<text>RMS &quot;Alcantara&quot; was an ocean liner which entered service just weeks before the start of World War I, was converted to an armed merchant cruiser in 1915, and was sunk in combat with the German armed merchant cruiser in the Action of 29 February 1916.

==Ocean liner==
Harland and Wolff in Govan built &quot;Alcantara&quot; for the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. She was one of the later members of RMSP&#x27;s &quot;A-series&quot; of liners, which had begun with RMS &quot;Aragon&quot; launched in 1905. In common with all of the last four &quot;A-series&quot; ships, &quot;Alcantara&quot; had triple screws. A pair of four-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines drove the port and starboard pair. Exhaust steam from their low-pressure cylinders powered a Parsons low-pressure steam turbine that drove the middle screw propeller.

&quot;Alcantara&quot; was launched on 30 October 1913 and made her maiden voyage in June 1914 on RMSP&#x27;s route from Southampton to Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo and Buenos Aires. &quot;Alcantara&quot; was registered at Belfast. Her UK official number was 132050 and her code letters were JFPR.

==HMS &quot;Alcantara&quot;==
In April 1915 the British Admiralty requisitioned &quot;Alcantara&quot; and her &quot;A-series&quot; sisters , and &quot;Andes&quot; to be armed merchant cruisers. She was armed with eight 6-inch guns, two six-pounder anti-aircraft guns, and depth charges. On 17 April at Liverpool she was commissioned into the Royal Navy&#x27;s 10th Cruiser Squadron as HMS &quot;Alcantara&quot;, with the pennant number M 94. &quot;Arlanza&quot; and &quot;Andes&quot; were also commissioned into the 10th Cruiser Squadron, which joined the Northern Patrol that was part of the First World War Allied naval blockade of the Central Powers. The Squadron patrolled about of the North Sea, Norwegian Sea and Arctic Ocean to prevent German access to or from the North Atlantic.

German submarine attacks on ships voyaging to and from Archangelsk created a suspicion that the Imperial German Navy had established a submarine base somewhere in the Arctic. In the summer of 1915 &quot;Alcantara&quot; was sent to Jan Mayen Island to investigate. She arrived on 3 July and sent a landing party ashore. It found no evidence of enemy activity; only the remains of the Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition base built in 1882 and three Arctic fox cubs, which for a short time were taken aboard as pets.

===Battle with &quot;Greif&quot;===
In January 1916 &quot;Alcantara&quot; embarked on the 10th Cruiser Squadron&#x27;s G patrol. She was due to return to port on 1 March, but on the morning of 29 February 1916 she was northeast of Shetland &quot;en route&quot; to a rendezvous with &quot;Andes&quot; she intercepted the Imperial German Navy merchant raider &quot;Greif&quot; disguised as the Norwegian merchant ship &quot;Rena&quot; with a home port of Tønsberg, Norway. At 0915 hrs at a range of &quot;Alcantara&quot; ordered &quot;Greif&quot; to stop for inspection, which she did. &quot;Alcantara&quot;″s ship&#x27;s company went to action stations, she trained her guns on &quot;Greif&quot;, closed to 2,000 yards and slowed to lower a cutter to put an armed guard aboard the suspect ship.

At 0940 hrs &quot;Greif&quot; increased speed and opened fire. One source claims she raised the Imperial German war ensign (&quot;Kriegsflagge&quot;). However, &quot;Alcantara&quot;″s commanding officer, Captain Thomas Wardle, reported that after lowering the Norwegian ensign &quot;Greif&quot; fought under no flag. The first shell hit &quot;Alcantara&quot;″s bridge, disabling her steering gear, engine order telegraph and all telephones and killing or wounding a number of men. Wardle ordered full speed and opened fire at a range of . A messenger was sent aft and got &quot;Alcantara&quot;″s after emergency steering gear connected.

&quot;Greif&quot; turned to starboard and closed range to . Several German shells hit &quot;Alcantara&quot; near her waterline, entering her stokehold bunkers and engine room. &quot;Greif&quot; tried to torpedo &quot;Alcantara&quot;. Wardle reported that evasive action at 1002 hrs allowed the torpedo to pass clear under &quot;Alcantara&quot;″s stern, but another source states that a torpedo detonated amidships against &quot;Alcantara&quot;″s port side. A shell from &quot;Alcantara&quot;″s port after gun hit and detonated the ready ammunition for &quot;Greif&quot;″s after gun, putting it out of action. By 1015 hrs &quot;Greif&quot; was badly afire by her bridge and seemed to have stopped. At 1022 hrs &quot;Alcantara&quot; saw boats leaving &quot;Greif&quot; and ceased fire.
&quot;Greif&quot; then fired one more shot, and &quot;Alcantara&quot; returned fire. The one shot was later attributed to a shell left in the breech of an abandoned gun being fired by the heat of the fire now raging aboard &quot;Greif&quot;.

By 1035 hrs &quot;Alcantara&quot; was reduced to about and her after steering gear was disabled. Her helm seemed to be jammed hard over to starboard but she was turning to starboard. Wardle ordered his company to cease fire, stop engines, and go to boat stations. The order to stop engines was not received, but flooding in the engine room stopped them. Several of &quot;Alcantara&quot;″s lifeboat falls had been damaged by enemy fire, so that attempts to launch some boats caused men to be dropped into the sea. &quot;Alcantara&quot; rolled, capsized and sank at 1102 hrs. At least 15 of her boats and a large liferaft floated clear.

The light cruiser and M-class destroyer then arrived. &quot;Comus&quot; proceeded to rendezvous with &quot;Andes&quot; about away, while &quot;Munster&quot; started rescuing survivors. &quot;Greif&quot; was carrying a large amount of cork that at first kept her afloat. &quot;Andes&quot; and &quot;Comus&quot; reopened fire on &quot;Greif&quot;. Eventually a large explosion, possibly of ammunition, sank the German ship.

The battle killed 230 men from &quot;Greif&quot; and 68 from &quot;Alcantara&quot;. Two hundred ten German survivors were rescued.

<text>Maldevelopment is the state of an organism or an organisation that did not develop in the &quot;normal&quot; way (used in medicine, e.g. &quot;brain maldevelopment of a fetus&quot;). It was introduced as a human and social development term in France in the 1990s by Samir Amin to challenge the concept of &quot;underdevelopment.&quot; The word &quot;maldéveloppement&quot; did not exist before then (the medical terms are &quot;malformation&quot; or &quot;développement anormal&quot;), so the word is a neologism meant to be analogous to the difference between undernutrition and malnutrition.

Maldevelopment is a global concept that includes human and social development. Under the philosophy of sustainable development, economic development is only a &quot;tool&quot; that allows for greater human and social development, not the final goal. &quot;Under&quot;-development is a quantitative notion, implying that a nation has a lack and must gain something to reach a particular reference state—the state of the nation that judges another nation as underdeveloped. So this notion also implies a unique development model—the one of the judging nation.

&quot;Mal&quot;-development, or &quot;ill&quot;-development, is a qualitative notion that expresses a mismatch, a discrepancy between the conditions (economic, political, meteorological, cultural, etc.) and the needs and means of the people.

<text>The Abaris Golden Arrow was a planned homebuilt civil utility aircraft, intended to be manufactured in kit form. It was an unusually large aircraft for its type, able to seat six people (including the pilot) and, also unusually in a homebuilt plane, powered by a turboprop engine.

The Golden Arrow was intended to be of conventional monoplane configuration, with retractable tricycle undercarriage and a T-tail. It was largely of composite construction.

The craft derived its name from a legendary arrow, carried by the ancient Greek sage Abaris the Hyperborean. The arrow, given to Abaris by the sun-god Apollo, conferred upon its bearer the power of flight.

In 2003, the first aircraft was not yet complete when the company closed down.

<text>Thumb twiddling is an activity that is done with the hands of an individual whereby the fingers are interlocked and the thumbs circle around a common point, usually in the middle of the distance between the two thumbs.

While it is an expression of at least a moderate amount of manual dexterity, thumb twiddling is frequently used as an example of a useless, time-wasting activity.

==Medical uses==
Thumb twiddling can be used as a simple test for manual dexterity.

== Contra-rotating thumbs ==
Contra-rotation involves moving the thumbs in opposing directions. While thumb twiddling comes naturally for almost everyone, it is extremely rare for people to be able to naturally contra-rotate their thumbs without spending a significant amount of time training the new technique. Typically, a person will get through a half rotation before both of the thumbs will inexplicably synchronize directions. A similar phenomenon occurs using similar finger or arm movements.

<doc id="1010466" wikidata="Q538516" url="?curid=1010466" title="Dark Blue World">
<text>Dark Blue World () is a 2001 war drama film by Czech director Jan Svěrák, the Academy Award-winning director of &quot;Kolya&quot;. The film is about Czech pilots who fought for the British Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War. The screenplay was written by Zdeněk Svěrák, the director&#x27;s father. The film stars Czech actors Ondřej Vetchý, Kryštof Hádek and Oldřich Kaiser. British actors include Tara Fitzgerald, Charles Dance and Anna Massey.

==Plot==
In 1950, during the Cold War, František (Franta) Sláma (Ondřej Vetchý) is incarcerated in Czechoslovakia, because of his prior service in the RAF. His recollections of the war begin in 1939, just days prior to the German invasion of Czechoslovakia. After the invasion, the Czechoslovak Army is disbanded and its Air Force has to surrender its aircraft. However, Franta and his young friend Karel Vojtíšek (Kryštof Hádek), among others, refuse to submit to their occupiers and flee to the United Kingdom to join the RAF.

The British make the Czechoslovaks retrain from the basics, which infuriates them, especially Karel, who is both impatient to fight the Germans and humiliated at being retaught what he already knows. Karel also sees the compulsory English language lessons as a pointless waste of his time. The RAF is in such a dire need of pilots during the Battle of Britain that eventually the Czechoslovak airmen are allowed to fly. After their first sortie they realise why the British have trained them so intensely: a young Czechoslovak nicknamed &quot;Tom Tom&quot; is shot down by a Messerschmitt Bf 109 and killed. Franta becomes the unit commander, with the younger Karel under his charge.

While shooting down a Heinkel He 111 bomber, Karel&#x27;s Spitfire fighter aircraft is shot down. However, he manages to survive and find his way to a farm. There he meets and falls in love with Susan (Tara Fitzgerald), although she thinks he is far too young. The next day, after returning to the aerodrome, Karel brings Franta to meet Susan. The latter begins to get attracted to Susan, although Karel believes that Susan is interested in him.

Following a mission to France where the squadron attacks a train, Karel is shot down, but Franta lands and rescues him, a move that shows that their friendship endures. Soon after, however, Karel learns a sort of love triangle has developed, with Susan being involved with Franta, which leads to a quarrel between the two friends. Later in the war, while escorting American bombers, Franta&#x27;s Spitfire malfunctions and he is forced to ditch into the ocean. His life raft bursts as he tries to inflate it, so Karel tries to drop his own raft, but he flies too low and fatally crashes. The raft emerges from the water, allowing Franta to survive.

Afterward, when the war is over, Franta drives to Susan&#x27;s home, only to find her with her injured husband recently returned from fighting overseas. Knowing he has no future with Susan and wanting to preserve her honour, he pretends to have lost his way and asks directions to the next town. Franta returns to Czechoslovakia and finds his old girlfriend has married the neighbourhood jobsworth, has given birth to a child, and has taken over Barča, his dog. All the disappointed Franta can do is endure the situation as stoically as he can. In prison, he only has his memories of his friendship with Karel to sustain him.

==Cast==
==Production==

Principal photography for the film involved a large number of locations: Hradčany Airport, Czech Republic, Dover, England, Germany and South Africa.

Dogfight footage from the 1969 film &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; was seamlessly integrated with contemporary film footage using computer imagery and mastering to create the aerial sequences due to the prohibitively expensive cost ($10,000 per hour) of renting a real Spitfire. The scene of a train being attacked was the most expensive scene in Czech cinema history, costing more than the entire film &quot;Kolya&quot;. Brief scenes from the 1990 film &quot;Memphis Belle&quot; were also incorporated. Director Jan Svěrák played a number of roles, including practically all the crew members of an Allied North American B-25 Mitchell bomber in the scene where a damaged bomber is escorted.

==Reception==
&quot;Dark Blue World&quot; opened in both the U.S. and Europe at major international film festivals in London and Toronto, to generally positive reviews, making it one of the most popular aviation war films made. 
Rex Reed described the film in &quot;The New York Observer&quot; as an &quot;epic that blends action, romance and tragedy. Brilliantly directed and sublimely acted.&quot; Animator Hayao Miyazaki was very positive of the film, praising it for showing the speed and fragility of aircraft and the historic tragedy of the Czech pilots after the war.

However, other reviewers were not as enthused. Leonard Maltin commented that the love triangle provided a &quot;more novel and interesting&quot; aspect but the &quot;surprisingly elaborate&quot; flying scenes helped make the film less of a &quot;capable but uninspired yarn&quot;, not very different from other World War II features. Peter Bradshaw&#x27;s review in &quot;The Guardian&quot; echoed a similar view, &quot;A by-the-numbers WW2 romantic tale of two Czech pilots in love with the same British woman, which plays like a mixture of &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; and &quot;Two Little Boys&quot; by Rolf Harris.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;Dark Blue World&quot; was the most popular Czech film of the year with admissions of 1 million. It was released in the United States on December 28, 2001, and grossed $258,771. The film grossed $2,300,000 worldwide.

===Awards and honours===
&quot;Dark Blue World&quot; was a major winner at the 2002 Czech Lion Awards with Box Office Award, Critics&#x27; Award
Jan Svěrák for Best Director, Vladimír Smutný for Best Cinematography, Ondřej Soukup for Best Music and Alois Fišárek for Best Editing. The film was also nominated for Best Film, Ondřej Vetchý for Best Actor, Kryštof Hádek for Best Supporting Actor, Linda Rybová for Best Supporting Actress, Zbyněk Mikulík for Best Sound, Věra Mirová for Best Costumes and Jan Vlasák for Best Art Direction.

&quot;Dark Blue World&quot; also won the 2001 National Board Review award for Best Foreign Film and the 2002 Love is Folly International Film Festival (Bulgaria), Golden Aphrodite Award (Best Film) for Jan Svěrák. Ondřej Vetchý was also nominated for the Audience Award (Best Actor) in the 2001 European Film Awards.

<doc id="1010471" wikidata="Q1594629" url="?curid=1010471" title="Heikegani">
<text>is a species of crab native to Japan, with a shell that bears a pattern resembling a human face – an example of the phenomenon of pareidolia – which is interpreted to be the face of an angry samurai, hence the nickname samurai crab. The crabs are named after the once powerful Taira clan which dominated medieval Japan, commonly known as the Heike. It is believed that these crabs are reincarnations of the Heike warriors defeated at the naval Battle of Dan-no-ura as told in &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot;. While the crabs are edible, they are not eaten by most Japanese.

== Origin of the carapace pattern ==
Heikegani were used by Carl Sagan in his popular science television series &quot;&quot; as an example of unintentional artificial selection, an interpretation originally published by Julian Huxley in 1952. According to this hypothesis, the crabs with shells resembling samurai were thrown back to the sea by fishermen out of respect for the Heike warriors, while those not resembling samurai were eaten, giving the former a greater chance of reproducing. Therefore, the more closely the crabs resembled a samurai face, the more likely they would be spared and thrown back.

This idea has met with some skepticism. Joel Martin, for instance, notes that humans do not eat Heikegani, and as such there is no artificial pressure favoring face-like shell patterns, contrary to Sagan&#x27;s implication. The pattern of ridges on the carapace serves a very functional purpose as sites of muscle attachment. Similar patterns are found on the carapaces of other species and genera throughout the world, including numerous fossil taxa.

==Battle of Dan-no-ura==
The Battle of Dan-no-ura was preceded by an immense struggle between the imperial rulers of Japan, the Taira clan (also known as the Heike), who the Heikegani crabs are named after, and the Minamoto clan (Genji), who were fighting for control of the throne at the end of the 12th century in the Genpei War (1180–1185).

On the 24th of April 1185 AD, two powerful Samurai clans fought to the death on the Dan-no-ura bay of Japan&#x27;s Inland Sea. The ruling Taira clan (Heike) was led by their child-Emperor, Antoku, and his grandmother, Taira no Tokiko. The Heike had ruled Japan for many decades, but now, massively outnumbered, they faced defeat at the hands of the Minamoto.

During the battle, Tokiko took the seven-year-old Emperor Antoku and leaped with him into the water in the Shimonoseki Straits, drowning the child emperor, rather than allowing him to be captured by the opposing forces, and most members and generals of the Taira clan followed them in despair. Antoku came to be worshipped as Mizu-no-kami (&quot;god of water&quot;).

This crucial battle was a cultural and political turning point in Japanese history: Minamoto Yoritomo became the first Shōgun, or military ruler, of Japan. Dan-no-ura marked the beginning of seven centuries during which Japan was ruled by warriors and shōguns instead of aristocrats and emperors.

== Cultural references ==
In &quot;&quot;, the writer, Lafcadio Hearn, references the Heike crab in &quot;The Story of Mimi-Nashi-Hoichi.&quot;

In the 1964 Japanese anthology film Kwaidan, based on Hearn&#x27;s stories, &quot;Hoichi the Earless&quot; recounts the story of the Battle of Dan-no-ura, which becomes the basis of &quot;Hoichi the Earless.&quot; The narrator explains the myth, illustrated with prominent footage of the crabs. At the end of the &quot;Hoichi the Earless&quot; segment, Hoichi is seen playing the lute, with heikegani on his shoulders.

In his 1980 science series &quot;&quot;, Carl Sagan used heikegani to illustrate artificial selection. British biologist Richard Dawkins discussed the same idea in his 2009 book &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution&quot;.

Heike crabs appear as an important part of the plot in one of the comic book stories of Usagi Yojimbo, a rabbit samurai character created by Stan Sakai. The &quot;Grass cutter&quot; story published in volume 2 of the Usagi saga tells the legend of how a sacred sword &quot;kusanagi&quot; was lost and then found with help from samurai crabs. 

In &quot;Another Crab&#x27;s Treasure&quot;, a Soulslike action-adventure video game developed and published by Aggro Crab, there is Heikea the Intimidation Crab, a samurai-inspired boss that is clearly based on the Heikegani. Heikea fights with a pair disposable chopsticks, wielding them like swords, and uses his face-shaped carapace to frighten the player character into submission.

<text>The Computer Professionals&#x27; Union (CPU or CP-Union) is a mass organization of information and communications technology (ICT) professionals, practitioners, and workers in the Philippines. It is registered in the Philippines as a non-stock, non-profit, non-government organization that promotes activist ICT principles and organize ICT professionals to provide ICT services to Filipino people. Their office is located at Quezon City and their current Chairperson is Kim Cantillas.

Some of CPU initiatives include Software Freedom Day celebration in the Manila, promotion of Free and Open Source Software including Drupal, the Philippine Digital Justice Initiative and collaboration with Wikimedia Philippines.

==History==

The organization was started in 2001 by a group of information communications technology practitioners. They officially registered under the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission in 2008 as a non-profit and non-stock corporation.

==Activism==

CPU is notable for its belief that the ICT sector in the Philippines is controlled and dominated by foreign monopoly capitalists, which stunts the growth and development of Filipino technology and economy. CPU supports a truly nationalist and democratic government that will advance and promote a people&#x27;s ICT. CPU believes that, like farmers, workers, and other sectors in the country, ICT workers also need to organize in order to advance their specific needs.

A year before the 2010 Philippine general elections, CPU warns sophisticated cheating with the Philippines&#x27; first automated polls. They had hosted a national conference in University of the Philippines in Diliman, Quezon City to discuss the automated election system (AES). Rick Bahague, CPU National Coordinator said that the goal of the conference was to gather experiences and best practices in technologies relevant to AES. He further said that software bugs in the AES system can affect machines to be used in the elections and the automated election system is vulnerable to manipulation from inside or outside attacks.

During the height of the protests against Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and PROTECT IP Act (PIPA) in January 2012, CPU expressed strong opposition to it. They said that SOPA and PIPA that were being pushed in the United States Congress attack free speech and expression and would have impacts to human rights groups, bloggers, advocacy groups and all content creators in the web. They believed that any website can be closed without due process.

In September 2012, Philippine President Aquino signed the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 enacted by 15th Congress of the Philippines. The law had led numerous sectors including Computer Professionals&#x27; Union to protest it. According to CPU, sections of the law may have various interpretations that may lead to intentional or non-intentional misinterpretations by State authorities wherein computer users can be punished without due process. They further said that Section 19 of the law has become far worse than SOPA and PIPA.

In 2021, CPU launched the Philippine Digital Justice Initiative.

In October 2022, Philippine President Marcos Jr. signed the SIM Card Registration Act. CPU condemned the enactment of the SIM Registration Act, saying that the law risks our right to privacy and data protection.

==Organization tenets==

In advancing CPU&#x27;s advocacy, these are their principles:

*Free Information: CPU believes that information in all forms is the collective knowledge and experience of humankind. It believes that no one owns information; therefore, anyone can use and develop it for the benefit of mankind and development of society.
*Privacy of Information: Computers and telecommunications networks have brought consumers many conveniences. But, the organization alleges, advanced technologies pose serious threats to privacy. CPU believes that information about us, our families, where we live, where we work, people we call, sites we surf, stores we shop in, etc., should be kept private.
*Open Source: CPU fully supports the open source initiative. One of the group&#x27;s aims is to convince fellow technology practitioners and the government to abandon the use of software by companies such as Microsoft and Oracle Corporation.
*Right to organize: CPU members believe that as workers, they have the right to form labor unions and associations that will collectively fight for workers&#x27; rights and welfare.
*Use of Appropriate Technology: CPU believes that technology alone cannot solve political and social problems. It aims to dispel myths about the infallibility of technological systems and neutrality of science and technology.

<doc id="1010480" wikidata="Q5442098" url="?curid=1010480" title="Felisa Rincón de Gautier">
<text>Felisa Rincón de Gautier (), also known as Doña Fela, (January 9, 1897 – September 16, 1994) was a Puerto Rican politician who served as the mayor of the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico. She was the first woman to be elected as mayor of a capital city in the Americas.

==Early years==
Rincón de Gautier was born on January 9, 1897, in Ceiba, Puerto Rico. She was the oldest of nine children — Felisa, Josefina, Cecilia, Esilda, Ramón, Rafael, Enrique, and Rita. Her father, attorney Enrique Rincón Plumey, was of Spanish descent; her direct paternal grandfather, Francisco Rincón Martín, came from Salamanca, Spain. She was politically influenced by her father, who was from the family of an earlier Mayor of Yabucoa. Her mother, teacher Rita Marrero Rivera, died when she was around 11 years old. After her mother died, her father married Mercedes Acha, the mother of her half brother Manuel. Felisa ran the household and raised her younger brothers and sisters.

Her father was determined to give Felisa the best education possible. She went to school in Fajardo, Humacao and Santurce, however she did not graduate from high school. During the summers, she visited her uncle in San Lorenzo, where she learned how to prepare medications and became a pharmacist.

In the early 20th Century, &quot;there was no welfare on the island; no social department to provide money or clothing or food for the poor (but) no jíbaro would let another jíbaro starve. This was the most important truth she learned. The jíbaros were a people steeped in tradition, the noblest of which was their hospitality.&quot; (Ruth Gruber, Felisa Rincon de Gautier: The Mayor of San Juan).

An expert seamstress, Felisa set herself the goal of creating employment in Puerto Rico by launching a local clothing factory. In order to master necessary skills, she worked for two years in New York City during the Great Depression, living with relatives, including her sister Josefina.

Upon her return to San Juan, she entered the wholesale/retail business and opened Felisa&#x27;s Style Shop on Calle Fortaleza in Old San Juan. She also managed a flower shop called Miles de Flores. Throughout her lifetime, she remained closely tied to the Roman Catholic Church, as she directed her efforts to raising the standards of living for impoverished Puerto Ricans.

==Women&#x27;s rights activist==
Rincón de Gautier was a firm believer in the women&#x27;s right to vote and was an active participant in the suffragist movement, motivating many women to register. When the law allowing women to vote was passed, Rincón de Gautier was the fifth woman to officially register. In 1932, she joined the Liberal Party of Puerto Rico, which believed in Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence, and was named representative by the party&#x27;s president Antonio R. Barceló. Motivated by the political ideas of Luis Muñoz Marín, she left the Liberal Party and in 1938 helped organize the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico.

==Marriage and family==

In 1940, Rincón de Gautier married San Juan lawyer Genaro A. Gautier, who served as the Assistant Attorney General of Puerto Rico and Secretary General of the Popular Democratic Party. They had no children.

==Political career==

In 1946, Rincón de Gautier was appointed mayor of San Juan, becoming the first woman mayor of a capital city in the Americas. Rincón was mayor of San Juan for 22 years, from 1946 to 1968. Under her leadership, San Juan was transformed into a Latin-American urban center. Rincón de Gautier designed innovative public services and established the first preschool centers called &quot;Las Escuelas Maternales&quot;, which would eventually become the model for the Head Start programs in the United States. She also renovated the public health system and was responsible for the establishment of the School of Medicine in San Juan.

Rincón worked with Ricardo Alegría to restore and conserve the historical structures of Old San Juan and provided housing and basic services to thousands of people. In 1951, during the Cold War era, she ordered the establishment of the island&#x27;s first Civil Defense system which was under the directorship of Colonel Gilberto José Marxuach. She often opened City Hall to the public and listened to concerns of the residents of the city. In 1959, San Juan was awarded the All American City Award.

Rincón de Gautier started a Christmas tradition, which would be continued every year by the governors of Puerto Rico. On the &quot;Día de los Reyes&quot; (&quot;Three Kings Day&quot;), celebrated on January 6, she would bring gifts and treats to the poor and needy children. In 1952, 1953 and 1954, she had planeloads of snow delivered to San Juan so that the children who had never seen or played in snow would be able to do so.

She participated as a delegate in the Democratic Party nominating conventions. Her last convention in 1992 and at 95 years old, she was the oldest delegate to attend.

==Later years==
Upon retiring as mayor, Rincón de Gautier served as the American Goodwill Ambassador for four United States presidents. She served in Latin America, Asia, and Europe promoting friendship between those regions and the United States.

Felisa Rincón de Gautier died due to a heart attack and a rumored stroke on in San Juan, on September 16, 1994 at the age of 97, and she was given the burial honors of a head of state. Dignitaries from all over the world attended her funeral service. She was buried at the Capital Municipal Cemetery in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico.

==Honors==
In both Puerto Rico and the United States, numerous public structures and avenues have been named in honor of Rincón de Gautier. There is a Felisa Rincón de Gautier Museum and a parking lot with the name of Doña Fela on Calle Recinto Sur in Old San Juan. In New York City, both the Felisa Rincón de Gautier Institute for Law &amp; Public Policy in the Bronx and a public school (PS 376) in Brooklyn, New York, are named in her honor.

On May 29, 2014, The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico honored 12 illustrious women — including Rincón de Gautier — with plaques in the &quot;La Plaza en Honor a la Mujer Puertorriqueña&quot; (Plaza in Honor of Puerto Rican Women) in San Juan. According to the plaques the 12 women, who by virtue of their merits and legacies, stand out in the history of Puerto Rico.

In 2019, Felisa Rincón de Gautier was highlighted by MSNBC for her outstanding political and humanitarian accomplishments as a notable American. Rincón was also leading the renovation of San Juan&#x27;s Municipal Hospital Complex eventually becoming the First Hospital in Puerto Rico to get full accreditation from the American hospital Association in 1960.

On March 14, 2019, The Puerto Rican Arts Alliance (PRAA) honored Felisa Rincón de Gautier with the Distinguished Woman award.

Dona Felisa received recognition from multiple governments such as France (Medal of Joan of Arc), Spain (Gold Medal of Honor), and Ecuador (Gold Medal of Honor).

Felisa Rincón de Gautier was also recognized as &quot;Woman of the Americas&quot; in 1954 by the Union of American women due to her contributions to American society.

<text>Antonio Barceló y Pont de la Terra (1 January 1717 – 30 January 1797) was a Spanish privateer and general admiral of the Spanish Navy.

Of humble origins, Barceló rose to admiral on military merits alone, an unusual event at his time. He was active against Barbary piracy and slave trade in the western Mediterranean, adopting their tactics to counter them and serving himself as a pirate hunter for most of his career. He later developed extensively the usage of naval artillery and gunboats, leading to the creation of the &quot;fuerzas sutiles&quot;.

==Biography==
He was the oldest of the five sons of Onofre Barceló, a small time privateer against the Muslim piracy that attacked the coasts of the western Mediterranean. Antonio started his career as a cabin boy in Onofre&#x27;s xebec &quot;Santo Cristo de Santa Margarita&quot;, eventually replacing Onofre as its captain, and added a job as a royal mail ship between Palma de Mallorca and Barcelona.

With the Spanish Navy focused on the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear since 1739, Barceló and other privateers were recruited and received the official mission to prevent further piracy. Eventually he became lieutenant general of the Spanish Navy.

He is also famous for his bombardments of Algiers (Bombardment of Algiers in August 1783 and 2nd Bombardment of Algiers in July 1784) and use of gunboats during the Great Siege of Gibraltar.

Antonio is also credited of putting sailors and ships under the patronage of the Virgin of Carmel and shifting away from the patronage of St. Elmo. Today, on the feast day of the Viring of Carmel, blessing of boats still takes place in many Spanish towns.

<doc id="1010494" wikidata="Q831795" url="?curid=1010494" title="Enterprise information system">
<text>An Enterprise Information System (EIS) is any kind of information system which improves the functions of enterprise business processes by integration. This means typically offering high quality of service, dealing with large volumes of data and capable of supporting some large and possibly complex organization or enterprise. An EIS must be able to be used by all parts and all levels of an enterprise.

The word &quot;enterprise&quot; can have various connotations. Frequently the term is used only to refer to very large organizations such as multi-national companies or public-sector organizations. However, the term may be used to mean virtually anything, by virtue of it having become a corporate-speak buzzword.

==Purpose==
Enterprise information systems provide a technology platform that enables organizations to integrate and coordinate their business processes on a robust foundation. An EIS is currently used in conjunction with customer relationship management and supply chain management to automate business processes. An enterprise information system provides a single system that is central to the organization that ensures information can be shared across all functional levels and management hierarchies.

An EIS can be used to increase business productivity and reduce service cycles, product development cycles and marketing life cycles. It may be used to amalgamate existing applications. Other outcomes include higher operational efficiency and cost savings.

Financial value is not usually a direct outcome from the implementation of an enterprise information system.

==Design stage==
At the design stage the main characteristic of EIS efficiency evaluation is the probability of timely delivery of various messages such as command, service, etc.

==Information systems==

Enterprise systems create a standard data structure and are invaluable in eliminating the problem of information fragmentation caused by multiple information systems within an organization. An EIS differentiates itself from legacy systems in that it is self-transactional, self-helping and adaptable to general and specialist conditions. Unlike an enterprise information system, legacy systems are limited to department-wide communications.

A typical enterprise information system would be housed in one or more data centers, would run enterprise software, and could include applications that typically cross organizational borders such as content management systems.

<text>Lyubov Petrovna Orlova ( ; – 26 January 1975) was a Soviet and Russian actress, singer, dancer and People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR (1950).

==Life and career==
Lyubov Orlova was born to a family of Russian hereditary nobles on her maternal side and gentry on her paternal side in Zvenigorod, 60 km from Moscow, then lived with her parents and older sister in Yaroslavl. Her acting and singing talents were evident very early on, but her noble parents considered acting a disgraceful career and directed her towards classical music. There she began to study music. In 1914, after her father left for the front, her mother Evgenia Nikolaevna and her daughters settled in Moscow, where the sisters entered the gymnasium. The Orlovs spent the difficult years of the Civil War in Voskresensk because their mother&#x27;s sister lived here. The family subsisted on funds from the sale of milk which was given by the aunt&#x27;s cow. Lyuba and Nonna drove nearly a hundred kilometers to Moscow, and then went home, with heavy cans. Hence comes the legend of the ugly hands which Orlova was so shy about. Her first and last names are meaningful words in Russian: любовь means &quot;love&quot;, and Орлова is the feminine form of орлов &quot;eagle&#x27;s&quot;.

When she was seven, Fyodor Shalyapin predicted her future as a famous actress. In 1919–1922, she studied as a piano student at the Moscow Conservatory ( class) but did not graduate because she had to work as a music teacher and a pianist-illustrator of silent films in movie theaters () to support her parents. In 1925, she has graduated from the Moscow Theatre College, choreography department. Her first husband, a Soviet economist, Andrei Berzin, was arrested in 1930. However, this did not affect her career. Dmitri Shcheglov, a biography author, wrote in &quot;Love and Mask&quot; (&#x27;Lyubov i maska&#x27;, 1997): &quot;As an eternal irony and foresight of fate, the best performer of the roles of house servants and enthusiasts of Communist labor was a descendant of ten Russian Orthodox saints. Two of them, Olga, the Grand Princess of Kiev, and Vladimir, the Grand Prince of Kiev, are among the Equal-to-apostles... Red Eagle in an azure-golden field, the House of Orlov&#x27;s coat of arms, is also present on the Bezhetsk clan branch the actress belonged to...&quot; The Orlov family was partly saved from the worst form of repression, camps or deportation, and the Bolshevik &quot;redistribution of property&quot; only because even before the Revolution, her father Peter had lost all three of his estates at cards, and therefore there was practically nothing to take away. However, Orlova&#x27;s father, an engineer and class enemy, was officially banned as an employee.

In September 1926, she was hired as a choir singer by the Nemirovich-Danchenko Theatre Music Studio finally deciding to become an actress, not a pianist. She received her first solo role in November, the same year. Her quick promotion was fueled by Olga Baclanova&#x27;s sudden departure from Russia and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko&#x27;s eye for this type of female beauty. In 1932, she received her first leading roles in &quot;La Périchole&quot; and &quot;Les cloches de Corneville&quot;. Despite her success with the public, vocal and acting training in a theatre with , Orlova wasn&#x27;t noticed by the press and was criticized by her colleagues for not having a real singing voice (Faina Ranevskaya, her close friend, used to say &quot;Orlova is a gorgeous actress for sure. But her voice! When she sings it sounds like somebody is urinating in an empty bucket.&quot;) However, Orlova had her &quot;trick&quot;. Remembering her student years (and she studied at the choreography department of the Moscow Theater College named after A.V. Lunacharsky, now - GITIS), she decided to bring herself back to her previous form and perform Serpoletta&#x27;s entrance aria on pointe. Alexander Hort, writer, wrote: &quot;The audience was smitten: while dancing, Serpoletta stood up on pointe shoes, so graceful, airy, romantic! And Orlova made a tactically verified move, she took the bull by the horns: the very first vocal number, Serpoletta&#x27;s verses &#x27;What a pity that an unsettling case pushed me to a different path!&#x27; she performed, dancing on her fingers.&quot; In the future, no one was able to repeat this trick, it has stayed as a semi-legendary fact of history.

In 1933 she met the novice director Grigory Alexandrov, who was casting actors for his movie &quot;Jolly Fellows&quot; (1934), and married him. Orlova&#x27;s performance in this comedy, very popular in the USSR, earned the young star the sympathy of Stalin and the title &quot;Honorable actor of the RSFSR&quot;. It had caused the first wave of the so-called &quot;Orlova syndrome&quot;, a Soviet psychiatric term describing women who wanted to be like Orlova. They diligently lightened their hair and self-styled themselves as relatives to the idol. According to her relatives, Orlova secretly loathed Joseph Stalin reacted to death with the words: &quot;Finally, this scum is dead&quot;. Her critics, including Sergei Eisenstein, had blamed the musician-turned-actress for ruining the serious career of Alexandrov. Despite her efforts, Orlova didn&#x27;t have a reputation of a serious drama actress, moreover, she was intentionally overplaying her film roles and didn&#x27;t stop her constant touring as a singer. Her haters credited her success to the marriage of convenience and Stalin protection

In the next few years she starred in four popular movies which also became instant Soviet classics: &quot;Circus&quot; (1936), &quot;Volga-Volga&quot; (1938), &quot;Tanya&quot; (1940), and &quot;Springtime&quot; (1947). She was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1941. In 1950, she became the first woman to receive the title of the People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR exclusively for her cinematic works. After that, she switched to playing in theatre productions of Yuri Zavadsky&#x27;s company. Her most famous roles included &quot;Nora&quot; - Nora, &quot;Dear Liar&quot; - Patrick Campbell, &quot;Strange Mrs. Savage&quot; - Mrs. Ethel Savage. But her most acclaimed performance was a title role in &quot;Lizzie MacKay&quot; (Russian title for &quot;The Respectful Prostitute&quot;). Jean-Paul Sartre was present on a jubilee 400th show in 1962, saying: &quot;I was especially impressed by Lyubov Orlova&#x27;s talented performance. After the show, I told her I&#x27;ve been delighted by her performance. It was not an empty compliment. Lyubov Orlova is really the best of all LizzieMacKay performers I know.&quot;

Since the 1928 till her death, she was constantly touring as a singer with her pianist Leo Mironov (). Her early repertoire included classical songs by Glinka, Mussorgsky, Dargomyzhsky and Tchaikovsky. During the war, she toured more than 50,000 kilometers along the front line, with her concerts based on Isaak Dunayevsky songs from her movies. For all of her career, she was banned from making the records of her songs and performing on television, supposedly because of her &quot;backstage war&quot; with Klavdiya Shulzhenko, Leonid Utesov&#x27;s choice of interest for &quot;Jolly Fellows&quot;. Ivan Kozlovsky especially regretted the absence of recordings of his own duets with Orlova.

== Personal relationships ==

In 1926 or, according to her grandniece Nonna Golikova, in 1921, Lyubov Orlova married a Soviet economist Andrei Berzin (1893-1951), the deputy head of the administrative and financial department for the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Agriculture. Berzin supported not only Orlova, but her parents, and older sister, all of them also moved to his place. Orlova had married to save her relatives from death but she absolutely didn&#x27;t love her husband and had an abortion or a miscarriage that, highly likely, had left her barren for the rest of her life. Berzin has understood and accepted that asking her to file for divorce and save herself from the inevitable labor camps or deportation, as both the wife of enemy of the people and the daughter of class enemy, just before his next arrest by NKVD. She had agreed. After that, Lyubov and all of her relatives had to move from Berzin&#x27;s gorgeous apartment in the center of Moscow.

In 1931, Orlova became a partner of a &#x27;German specialist&#x27;, engineer or businessman, named Franz. Nothing more is known about him. Their romance developed for about a year. After her performances, a foreign admirer picked the actress in a black Mercedes. Franz bought Orlova expensive foreign outfits that arouse the envy of all women, especially in a theatre. Orlova moved to her beloved in the Metropol hotel, where he lived in a luxurious room. When Lyubov Orlova was invited to shoot &quot;Jolly Fellows&quot;, which took place in Gagra, Franz went with her. At that time, Lyuba was already familiar with Grigory Alexandrov, then separated for many years from his wife, actress Olga Ivanova. Olga and Grigory had a son named Douglas (1925-1978) but at that time she was in relationships with the famous actor Boris Tiomkin. In Gagra, Orlova&#x27;s affection for Aleksandrov became obvious. She had explained the situation to Franz and he left, first for Moscow and then for his homeland. Faina Ranevskaya remembered in 1982: &quot;Don&#x27;t you know how handsome Aleksandrov, Lyubochka&#x27;s director, friend, husband, used to be? He was handsome like Antinous even though I&#x27;ve never seen Antinous personally. Like Philemon and Baucis, they loved each other.&quot;.

In January 1934, or, according to a different archive source, in 1937, Orlova married Aleksandrov. However, because of the couple&#x27;s suspicious lack of children and Aleksandrov&#x27;s unclear relationships and painful breakup with Sergei Eisenstein, for the many decades, a lot of researchers have perceived Orlova as &quot;a beard&quot; to conceal Aleksandrov&#x27;s bisexuality in exchange for the richer career opportunities. Later in life, Aleksandrov had answered about his wife&#x27;s lack of children, according to his relative, the following: &quot;In the beginning, she didn&#x27;t want, and later she couldn&#x27;t&quot;.

After Aleksandrov ex-wife Olga&#x27;s death during childbirth in June 1941, when she was already married to Boris Tiomkin, Orlova has adopted his son Douglas (forcefully renamed to &#x27;Vasili&#x27; during the next purges, arrested in 1952, had his first heart attack in prison, was liberated after Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death the next year). In 1975, Orlova died and in 1978, Vasili died. In 1979, Vasili&#x27;s widow Galina Krylova married the mentally sick Grigori Aleksandrov to serve as his maid in exchange for a subsequent property and archive. She loathed Lyubov Orlova for arrogance towards her and her previous husband, and towards her son, Aleksandrov&#x27;s grandson. Grigori Aleksandrov died in 1983, his documentary about his wife &quot;Lyubov Orlova&quot; was released in 1984. The wide has buried his corpse on the same line, the opposite side, of Novodevichy Cemetery as Lyubov Orlova&#x27;s grave. For many decades, Orlova-Aleksandrov&#x27;s archive had been plundered before being bought from Aleksandrov&#x27;s descendants by the Russian-Jewish lawyer Aleksandr Dobrovinsky.

== Political views ==
Orlova was never a member of the Communist Party, even when her husband has joined it in 1954, following Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death. In the 1960s, another Soviet actress was unsuccessfully recruited by the KGB, in order for her to inform the authorities about the luminaries of Mossovet Theatre: Lyubov Orlova, Rostislav Plyatt, and Gennadi Bortnikov.
Orlova&#x27;s movies include a decent amount of plot-defining in-jokes about the composers, (Beethoven in &quot;Jolly Fellows&quot;, &quot;Volga-Volga&quot;, Johann Sebastian Bach in &quot;Starling and Lyre&quot;), and a-la virtuoso grand piano performances (&quot;Circus&quot;, about virtuosity as a word with the previous meaning &#x27;virtue&#x27;, &quot;Springtime&quot;). Grigori Aleksandrov credited his second wife Orlova, she was fluent in both French and German, as a co-editor of his scripts. In the autobiography, he wrote: &quot;It was enough for her to try by ear a piece of the script which had previously was lying on my desktop in a state of blissful well-being. All the imperfections of the material that was not completely written out were personally revealed to me. Lyubov Petrovna unusually sensed the slightest falsity&quot;. On a contrary, the Russian upper-class has historically preferred Italian opera and French ballet, as brands, a lot more than anything else and these facts were concluded, by Aleksandrov and Orlova in &quot;The Composer Glinka&quot; and &quot;Mussorgsky&quot;, in a still popular statement about Russian political elites, House of Romanov especially, being historically Russophobic. In 2018, &quot;The Economist&quot; has also pointed out the significant role of Russian Orthodox Church and &quot;the ghost of the Romanovs&quot; in Putin&#x27;s Russia. Feodor Nikitich Romanov (1553-1633, Patriarch Filaret of Moscow, de facto ruler of Russia during the reign of his son, Mikhail) descended from the Rurik dynasty through a female line, his mother, Evdokiya Gorbataya-Shuyskaya was a Rurikid princess from the Shuysky branch, daughter of Alexander Gorbatyi-Shuisky. The last tsar Nicholas II was described as &quot;limited, stupid&quot; and &quot;degenerate&quot; even by the usually polite first Russian Nobel Prize winner, physiologist Ivan Pavlov.

In 1936, following her role of a young mother in &quot;Circus&quot;, Orlova was given an order to participate, among the best-known women in the country, in the discussion, and, practically, in the approval of the law banning the abortion. According to M. Kushnirov, the executive editor of the radio who prepared a text for her to read, in general, welcoming, of course, the wise project of the Stalin government &quot;On mother and child, on family and abortion&quot;, the actress &quot;has allowed herself to make some amendments and additions to it&quot;.

On alimony, Orlova added: &quot;It is irrational to punish a father-defaulter with prison, he must be forced to work.&quot; On abortion: &quot;There should be no doom in the abortion clause. In Soviet society, there are many independent women, many professions in which a woman successfully competes with a man... Pregnancy will tear a woman out of her job, maybe at the very moment when she completes a grandiose project or prepares for a heroic flight, or finishes work over a big role for which she has spent several years of her life, and, perhaps, at this crucial moment of her life, her social and political biography, she is forced to give up everything and lose a year of time. In such cases, let the woman give birth a little later. Let abortion be allowed in these cases. Let the woman know the law is not fatal. It seems to me, lately, all women want to give birth, everyone wants to have a child. I myself want a child, and I will certainly have one. And it is natural. Life is getting more and more joyful and more fun. The future is even more wonderful. Why not give birth?&quot;

In 1939, Orlova also perceived the annexation of Polish territories of Ukraine and Belarus through the eyes of a musician. She wrote in Komsomolskaya Pravda the following: &quot;Once these lands were the lands of the Belarusian and Ukrainian people. The same rains watered them, the same sun shone on them, and the same winds swept over their valleys and hills. But two decades ago, a border passed through these lands. For one part of the Belarusian and Ukrainian people, the land was shrouded in grave gloom, for another it blossomed with extraordinary colors which only the land of happy people can shine with.&quot;

Orlova continued: &quot;In one part of the land, in the West, people have even forgotten how to sing, they were forbidden to sing. The oppressors saw the sounds of a Ukrainian or Belarusian song as a danger for themselves. These songs could remind the disadvantaged of another world that began so disturbingly close, there behind this fishing line, there behind this village... Now the song broke free. Millions of lips have recently been looking for words of a curse to express their hatred towards the Polish landlords. Now, these millions of lips are looking for the words of happiness that are unusual for them in order to glorify a new life, the Red Army, the Soviet government, the wise Stalin.&quot; Orlova not only responded in writing to the annexation of the &quot;old&quot; new lands to the USSR. The Soviet press reported in October 1939: &quot;In Western Ukraine and Western Belarus there are concert brigades of the USSR State Academic Bolshoi Theater and the All-Union Concert and Touring Association, including I. Kozlovsky, M. Reizen, R. Zelyonaya, S. Obraztsov, L. Orlova, .

In 1952, according to the witnesses, there was a failed attempt to assassinate Orlova for her political views. Her grandniece Nonna Golikova wrote: &quot;In 1952, Lyubov Petrovna gave a concert in some border town in Western Ukraine, where, as we know, active anti-Russian sentiments and political movements have always existed. Orlova in the final of the concert went to bows. Someone from the audience gave her an extraordinary bouquet of roses. &#x27;I immediately drew attention to it,&#x27; Lyubochka told us later. - &#x27;Now I understand that it was for mourning. White roses, and in the middle are completely unusual - black ones. I&#x27;ve never seen such people.&#x27; She took the bouquet. The paper it was wrapped in was torn from the side facing it. Lyubochka pricked her finger, the thorns were soaked in poison. Rapid blood poisoning began, Orlova&#x27;s life was in danger.&quot;

According to the official credits, all the music is by Isaak Dunayevsky Lyubov Orlova had been sistematically trained as a pianist from 1907 to 1922 (with 3 courses at the Moscow Conservatory), and, from 1920 to 1926, she worked professionally as a musician. In 1961, Orlova strongly implied her collaborative efforts in songwriting weren&#x27;t credited, highly likely, because of the strict rules about the non-members of the Union of Soviet Composers. There is a story about a conversation between Dunaevsky (nicknamed Dunya) and Dmitry Shostakovich: 
Dunaevsky to Shostakovich: &quot;You and me, Mitya, are the most popular composers&quot;. &quot;Yes, Dunya,&quot; Shostakovich answers. &quot;The only difference is that everyone knows my name but no one knows a single note of mine. Just like everyone knows your tunes but nobody knows who they belong to...&quot;

==Legacy==

A minor planet, 3108 Lyubov, discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Zhuravlyova in 1972, is named after her. A cruise ship named after her was built by the Soviet Union in Yugoslavia in 1976 for expeditions to Antarctica and the Arctic Circle.

In a 1999 VCIOM poll, Orlova was voted as the greatest &quot;Russian Idol of the 20th Century&quot; by 10%, the highest-rated woman, and 10th place overall with Yuri Gagarin atop with 30%. Ten years later, in 2010, she finished 3rd with 7% of votes, behind figure-skater Irina Rodnina (9%) and ballerina Maya Plisetskaya (8%) only, on a 15th place overall with Yuri Gagarin atop with 35%.

In 2016, a monument of Orlova in Zvenigorod was established near the Lyubov Orlova Cultural Centre (est. 2007).

In 2019, she was featured as a Google Doodle on what would have been her 117th birthday.

=== Contradictory facts ===

Lyubov Orlova didn&#x27;t provide any information about her personal life during her rare interviews, and there were no yellow journalism in the USSR or tabloids that could have revealed a piece of dangerous information about her non-proletarian background and first marriage to Andrei Berzin, Gulag prisoner. According to her unpublished autobiography, she was accepted, at the age of seven, at the Yaroslavl Music College and her education at the Moscow Conservatory had started before 1919. Orlova wrote: &quot;Before 1919, I studied piano at the Moscow Conservatory, Profs. A. P. Ostrovskaya and K. A. Kipp. And, probably, my parents were slightly disappointed when it turned out the art form I&#x27;ve mastered didn&#x27;t give me a great success, or recognition, or fame, but... just a modest opportunity to accompany the films that were shown in cinema with my piano playing&quot;. The official Moscow Conservatory cites 1919 as a year of start for her studies with Kipp and explains Orlova&#x27;s drop: &quot;...due to the difficult financial situation, her conservatory studies weren&#x27;t completed&quot;. Other biographies, including her grandniece&#x27;s book, also don&#x27;t mention Orlova&#x27;s rare Ménière&#x27;s disease as a reason for the career focus change.

In March 2016, the Channel One TV-series &quot;Orlova and Alexandrov&quot; was released. In this biopic, Lyubov Orlova has graduated from Moscow Conservatory, Prof. Alexander Goldenweiser. The series also implies, through an explicit display of that kind of torture on a female character, Orlova&#x27;s music hands, her right hand especially, were seriously damaged during Cheka, or OGPU (the previous titles for NKVD) tortures for interrogation. However, the official profile of Prof. Kipp lists Lybov Orlova (as a famous actress) among the best of his students, just like Prof. Ostrovskaya&#x27;s (junior courses). Another biography, the 1987 &quot;Lyubov Orlova in Art and Life&quot; book, listed her as a conservatory graduate with Prof. Felix Blumenfeld as her senior piano class teacher, in addition to Kipp. Blumenfeld began his Moscow Conservatory career in 1922.

A source of Orlova&#x27;s pre-conservatory music education isn&#x27;t clear. Yaroslavl Music College was founded in 1904 on a foundation of the existing Yaroslavl Russian Musical Society classes. Education at the conservatory during the Civil War was provided as usual, even in unheated classrooms. Since July 1918, the education at Moscow Conservatory has become state-sponsored, free of charge for domestic students. The full training period was 9 years, junior department from I to V course, and senior department from VI to IX course, and the minimum age of enrollment was 10 years. From 1910 till his death in 1925, Prof. Kipp taught at the senior department.

According to Orlova-Aleksandrov&#x27;s archive holder, layer Aleksander Dobrovinsky, Orlova was voluntarily childless. Dobrovinsky said: &quot;I&#x27;ve found her correspondence with a professor, gynecologist No. 1 in the USSR. There are mainly things of a physiological nature, but they indicate that Lyubov Orlova, one of the first women in the USSR, had inserted a spiral or something like that for contraception.

Lyubov Orlova&#x27;s year of birth was debatable. Her only friend Faina Ranevskaya stated: &quot;Nobody will say how old she is. She is generally brilliant: when they issued passports in the early thirties, no documents were required. You could name any date of birth and any name too ... So Lyubochka did not lose her head and immediately knocked off a dozen years! It was me, the idiot, who hesitated: is it worth it? Then I calculated that I have spent two years at resorts, so the resorts, as they say, do not count, and a new date of birth has appeared in my passport: instead of 1895, 1897. So little that I still cannot forgive myself for such frivolity!&quot; According to Lyubov Orlova&#x27;s grandniece Nonna Golikova, her grandmother Nonna Orlova (1897-1960), was &quot;two or three years older&quot; than her famous sister. Lyubov Orlova&#x27;s mother, Evgenia Sukhotina, has changed her passport year of birth from 1863 to 1878, &#x27;nullifying&#x27; fifteen years.

<text>Douglas James Roche, OC, KCSG (born June 14, 1929) is a Canadian author, parliamentarian, diplomat and peace activist. Roche served as Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Edmonton—Strathcona from 1972 to 1979 and for Edmonton South 1979–1984. In 1984, he was appointed Canada&#x27;s Ambassador for Disarmament, a position he held until 1989. He was appointed to the Senate of Canada on September 17, 1998, where he served until June 13, 2004. Currently he resides in Edmonton, Alberta.

==History==
Born in Montreal, Quebec, he was elected as Conservative MP for Edmonton-Strathcona in 1972. He followed this by serving as MP for Edmonton South to 1984.

He did not run for re-election in 1984.

In 1984, he was appointed Canada&#x27;s Ambassador for Disarmament. He has long been concerned with the issue of nuclear disarmament. 

He was elected Chairman of the United Nations Disarmament Committee, the main United Nations body dealing with political and security issues, at the 43rd General Assembly in 1988. He is also the author of twenty books, and has contributed chapters to thirteen more, including &quot;Creative Dissent: A Politician&#x27;s Struggle for Peace&quot; (Novalis, 2008). 

From 1989 to 2001, he was appointed Visiting Professor at the University of Alberta, where he taught &quot;War or Peace in the 21st Century?&quot; In 1997, he was chosen by the Students&#x27; Union to receive a SALUTE Award for &quot;outstanding contributions to students&quot;.

He is an Officer of the Order of Canada, and a leading organizer of the project in which more than 500 members of the Order of Canada have endorsed a call for Canada to commit to working with other countries to achieve a Nuclear Weapons Convention, which would be a global ban on nuclear weapons.

He is the founding Chairman of the Middle Powers Initiative, co-sponsored by eight international non-governmental organizations specializing in nuclear disarmament; he now serves as Senior Advisor to the current Chairman, Ambassador Henrik Salander of Sweden.

In 1995, Pope John Paul II presented him with the Papal Medal for his service as Special Adviser on disarmament and security matters. In 1998, the Holy See named him a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great.

Roche has served as President of the United Nations Association in Canada and was elected in 1985 as Honorary President of the World Federation of United Nations Associations. He was the founding President of Parliamentarians for Global Action, an international network of 1,300 parliamentarians in 99 countries, and wrote &quot;The Case for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly&quot; in 2002. He was also founding editor of the &quot;Western Catholic Reporter&quot; (1965–1972), International Chairman (1990–1996) of Global Education Associates, and co-founder of the Canadian International Institute of Applied Negotiation (CIIAN) in 1992, which is dedicated to the prevention and resolution of destructive conflict.

In 2009, Roche was the recipient of the Distinguished Service Award of the Canadian Association of Former Parliamentarians, &quot;presented annually to a former parliamentarian who has made an outstanding contribution to the country and its democratic institutions.&quot; Roche was cited in particular &quot;for his years of Parliamentary service, for his contribution to and respect for the institution of Parliament and for his continued interest and activity in the promotion of human welfare, human rights and parliamentary democracy in Canada and abroad.&quot;

<text>Juan Pedro Julián Aguirre y López de Anaya (October 19, 1781 – July 17, 1837) was an Argentine revolutionary and politician.

Aguirre was born in Buenos Aires, on October 19, 1781, to parents Cristobal Aguirre Hordenana Lecue and Maria Manuela Inocencia Lopez Anaya y Ruiz Gamez. He fought in the wars against the British troops of 1806/07, rising to the rank of Captain. In 1820, he briefly served as interim Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, and was the last official to hold that title. In 1824, he was minister of economics, and in 1826, he became the first president of the newly established national bank.

<doc id="1010522" wikidata="Q5282264" url="?curid=1010522" title="Disjunction and existence properties">
<text>In mathematical logic, the disjunction and existence properties are the &quot;hallmarks&quot; of constructive theories such as Heyting arithmetic and constructive set theories (Rathjen 2005). 

==Definitions==
* The disjunction property is satisfied by a theory if, whenever a sentence &quot;A&quot; ∨ &quot;B&quot; is a theorem, then either &quot;A&quot; is a theorem, or &quot;B&quot; is a theorem.
* The existence property or witness property is satisfied by a theory if, whenever a sentence is a theorem, where &quot;A&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) has no other free variables, then there is some term &quot;t&quot; such that the theory proves .

===Related properties===
Rathjen (2005) lists five properties that a theory may possess. These include the disjunction property (DP), the existence property (EP), and three additional properties:

* The numerical existence property (NEP) states that if the theory proves formula_1, where &quot;φ&quot; has no other free variables, then the theory proves formula_2 for some formula_3 Here formula_4 is a term in formula_5 representing the number &quot;n&quot;.
* Church&#x27;s rule (CR) states that if the theory proves formula_6 then there is a natural number &quot;e&quot; such that, letting formula_7 be the computable function with index &quot;e&quot;, the theory proves formula_8. 
* A variant of Church&#x27;s rule, CR1, states that if the theory proves formula_9 then there is a natural number &quot;e&quot; such that the theory proves formula_7 is total and proves formula_11.

These properties can only be directly expressed for theories that have the ability to quantify over natural numbers and, for CR1, quantify over functions from formula_12 to formula_12. In practice, one may say that a theory has one of these properties if a definitional extension of the theory has the property stated above (Rathjen 2005).

==Results==
===Non-examples and examples===
Almost by definition, a theory that accepts excluded middle while having independent statements does not have the disjunction property. So all classical theories expressing Robinson arithmetic do not have it. Most classical theories, such as Peano arithmetic and ZFC in turn do not validate the existence property either, e.g. because they validate the least number principle existence claim. But some classical theories, such as ZFC plus the axiom of constructibility, do have a weaker form of the existence property (Rathjen 2005).

Heyting arithmetic is well known for having the disjunction property and the (numerical) existence property.

While the earliest results were for constructive theories of arithmetic, many results are also known for constructive set theories (Rathjen 2005). John Myhill (1973) showed that IZF with the axiom of replacement eliminated in favor of the axiom of collection has the disjunction property, the numerical existence property, and the existence property. Michael Rathjen (2005) proved that CZF has the disjunction property and the numerical existence property.

Freyd and Scedrov (1990) observed that the disjunction property holds in free Heyting algebras and free topoi. In categorical terms, in the free topos, that corresponds to the fact that the terminal object, formula_14, is not the join of two proper subobjects. Together with the existence property it translates to the assertion that formula_14 is an indecomposable projective object—the functor it represents (the global-section functor) preserves epimorphisms and coproducts.

===Relationship between properties===
There are several relationship between the five properties discussed above.

In the setting of arithmetic, the numerical existence property implies the disjunction property. The proof uses the fact that a disjunction can be rewritten as an existential formula quantifying over natural numbers:
:formula_16.
Therefore, if 
:formula_17 is a theorem of formula_18, so is formula_19. 
Thus, assuming the numerical existence property, there exists some formula_20 such that 
:formula_21 
is a theorem. Since formula_22 is a numeral, one may concretely check the value of formula_23: if formula_24 then formula_25 is a theorem and if formula_26 then formula_27 is a theorem.

Harvey Friedman (1974) proved that in any recursively enumerable extension of intuitionistic arithmetic, the disjunction property implies the numerical existence property. The proof uses self-referential sentences in way similar to the proof of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems. The key step is to find a bound on the existential quantifier in a formula (∃&quot;x&quot;)A(&quot;x&quot;), producing a bounded existential formula
(∃&quot;x&quot;&lt;&quot;n&quot;)A(&quot;x&quot;). The bounded formula may then be written as a finite disjunction A(1)∨A(2)∨...∨A(n). Finally, disjunction elimination may be used to show that one of the disjuncts is provable.

== History ==
Kurt Gödel (1932) stated without proof that intuitionistic propositional logic (with no additional axioms) has the disjunction property; this result was proven and extended to intuitionistic predicate logic by Gerhard Gentzen (1934, 1935). Stephen Cole Kleene (1945) proved that Heyting arithmetic has the disjunction property and the existence property. Kleene&#x27;s method introduced the technique of realizability, which is now one of the main methods in the study of constructive theories (Kohlenbach 2008; Troelstra 1973).

<doc id="1010534" wikidata="Q1753327" url="?curid=1010534" title="Accident of Birth">
<text>Accident of Birth is the fourth studio album by Bruce Dickinson, released on 3June 1997 through Castle Communications&#x27; sublabel Raw Power in the UK and through CMC International in the US.

Dickinson&#x27;s second collaboration with guitarist/producer Roy Z, the album is markedly different in style from his previous effort, &quot;Skunkworks&quot;. As well as RoyZ, Dickinson was joined for the album by fellow former Iron Maiden member Adrian Smith; both Dickinson and Smith would later return to their former band in early 1999. Thanks to the slightly bigger success of this album than his previous solo releases, Dickinson would continue to work with RoyZ on his subsequent albums, &quot;The Chemical Wedding&quot; (1998) and &quot;Tyranny of Souls&quot; (2005) and &quot;The Mandrake Project&quot; (2024)

==Album artwork==
The cover art was produced by Derek Riggs, best known for being the creator of Iron Maiden&#x27;s mascot, Eddie, and the artwork on all of Iron Maiden&#x27;s albums, singles, posters and tour brochures throughout 1980–1990 (and sporadically afterwards up until 2000&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot;, other than one additional Eddie drawing for the cover of his book &quot;Run for Cover&quot;). In reference to this, the jester puppet featured on the cover was jokingly christened Edison (&quot;Eddie&#x27;s Son&quot;). A grim reaper is also faintly visible in the background, such a figure having previously been included by Riggs in his artwork for Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;Live After Death&quot; and &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; albums, as well as on the band&#x27;s earlier single &quot;The Trooper&quot;.

Four versions of the album cover exist. Originally, the artwork showed Edison graphically bursting from a man&#x27;s stomach, but for the original European release this image was cropped to remove the man&#x27;s head (although the poster that came with the limited edition of the album included the original, unedited image). The cover was deemed too explicit for the US market, where the album was instead released with completely different artwork showing a frontal view of Edison. The 2005 re-release again used a different image for the cover, showing the puppet nailed to a cross; this image had previously been used for the Japan-only &quot;Man of Sorrows&quot; single. Finally, the extended edition of the album features the original, unedited artwork, with the head of the man from whom Edison is bursting clearly visible.

==Critical reception==
The German magazine &quot;Rock Hard&quot; previewed &quot;Accident of Birth&quot; as the &quot;Album of the Month&quot; in May 1997. The reviewer praised Dickinson&#x27;s voice and the songwriting: &quot;Bruce sings like a young god – actually better and more expressive than ever – and has based his songwriting on the milestones of his Maiden years, with the new/old sidekick Adrian Smith coming at the right time&quot; to deliver &quot;their best material since &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot;&quot;. In 2005, &quot;Accident of Birth&quot; was ranked number 338 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book of &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

Contemporary reviews are equally positive. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic defined the album &quot;intriguing&quot; and &quot;better than many latter-day Maiden efforts&quot;. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff described &quot;Accident of Birth&quot; as &quot;an unabashed metal record, produced smoothly and firmly&quot; and added that it &quot;would have made an intelligent, and ironically daring Maiden reunion record&quot;.

<doc id="1010536" wikidata="Q1632678" url="?curid=1010536" title="Mallory–Weiss syndrome">
<text>Mallory–Weiss syndrome is a condition where high intra-abdominal pressures causes laceration and bleeding of the mucosa called Mallory-Weiss tears. Additionally, Mallory–Weiss syndrome is one of the most common causes of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, counting of around 1-15% of all cases in adults and less than 5% in children. It has been found that tears are up to 2 to 4 times more prevalent in men than women. The tears can cause upper gastrointestinal bleeding and predominantly occur where the esophagus meets the stomach (gastroesophageal junction). However, the tears can happen anywhere from the middle of the esophagus to the cardia of the stomach. Mallory–Weiss syndrome is often caused by constant vomiting and retching from alcoholism or bulimia. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is another risk factor that is often linked with Mallory–Weiss syndrome. However, not every individual with Mallory–Weiss syndrome will have these risk factors. Individuals with Mallory–Weiss syndrome will have hematemesis (vomiting up blood), however the symptoms can vary.

==History==
Before 1929, there were cases reported with similar symptoms of bleeding in the esophagus, the first being Johann Friedrich Hermann Albers reporting ulcer in the lower esophagus in 1833 via autopsy; however those were caused by ulcers and not lacerations. Another instance of Mallory–Weiss syndrome was from 1879 when Dr. Heinrich Quincke discovered 3 cases of bleeding from the formation of ulcers in the gastroesophageal tube; 2 of the cases were fatal due to vomiting of blood. This was followed by 2 cases reported by Dieulafoy to witness death from the phenomenon via vomiting of blood and 100 more cases in later literature before the findings in 1929.

Mallory–Weiss syndrome was named after G. Kenneth Mallory and Soma Weiss who accurately characterized the condition as a lower esophageal laceration in 1929 in 15 patients afflicted with alcoholism who presented with signs and symptoms of vomiting and retching. It was hypothesized that repeated vomiting would lead to the formation of tears if the body was not able to coordinate the cardiac opening of the stomach with the contraction of the abdominal muscles to induce the vomiting. Years later, Weiss and Mallory performed autopsies on 4 patients that died due to the complications of the syndrome caused by the hemorrhage. With the autopsies, it was noted that patients had lesions that were present on the esophagus down to the junction of the esophagus that meets the stomach. These particular lesions had signs of continual exposure to gastric juices from the stomach caused by the vomiting due to the pressure imbalances from the stomach; as a result the acutely formed lesions developed into chronic ulcerative lesions that ran deep into the layers of the esophagus up until the muscle fibers. In addition, there were signs of small arterioles that ruptured and small veins that were near the lesions which explains the hemorrhage that was present in these patients.

Dr. John Decker also examined patients afflicted with Mallory–Weiss syndrome via autopsy to note that many of patients did not have a history of alcoholism unlike the initial study conducted by the physicians the syndrome is named after; though Decker did comment that patients could be examined via gastroscope alongside Dr. Palmer who specifically mentioned the use of an endoscopy for diagnosis of Mallory–Weiss syndrome, so clinicians would not have to wait for a patient to die before performing an autopsy. However, a common finding between the patients with Decker&#x27;s analysis is the exacerbation of the lesions caused by vomiting with atrophic gastritis being an underlying factor that to those formations; though atrophic gastritis is a condition that is common with the elderly population which most of the 11 patients undergoing an autopsy were above 60 years of age. Moving forward to 1955, advances in surgery allow for a patient afflicted with Mallory–Weiss syndrome to be identified, then treated with the surgical procedure with Dr. E. Gale Whiting &amp; Dr. Gilbert Baronne, when the only way in the past was to perform an autopsy when a patient is deceased. The following year, Hardy per the recommendations of Palmer and Decker was able to complete the first diagnosis of the syndrome via endoscopy, leading to an increased incidence of Mallory–Weiss syndrome as shown with over 200 cases being mentioned in the literature as of 1973, and eventually the standard to make use of endoscopy to diagnosis the condition to witness lacerations along the esophageal lining and the signs of hemorrhage.

==Signs and symptoms==
Mallory–Weiss syndrome often presents as an episode of vomiting up blood (hematemesis) after violent retching or vomiting, but may also be noticed as old blood in the stool (melena), and a history of retching may be absent. Oftentimes, hematemesis is accompanied by chest, back, or epigastric pain. Additional symptoms can occur depending on how severe the condition is. Some individuals have experienced dizziness, loss of consciousness, and upper abdomen pain.

The condition is rarely fatal since in 90% of cases the tears heal on their own and the bleeding will stop spontaneously within 48 to 72 hours. However, endoscopic or surgical treatment may be necessary for severe bleeds. In cases of more severe bleeding, the typical symptoms of Mallory-Weiss Syndrome are those typical found in shock, which can be life-threatening. If a patient does happen to go into shock it may be reversed if discovered early. Although there are multiple types of shock, hemorrhagic hypovolemic shock is most commonly associated with gastrointestinal bleeding. Furthermore, gastrointestinal losses, such as those incurred from prolonged vomiting or diarrhea are associated with non-hemorrhagic hypovolemic shock. Both hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic hypovolemic shock can occur when there are decreases in intravascular volume, such as when the body is hemorrhaging (bleeding) or significant fluid loss. This decrease in intravascular volume causes subsequent reflex mechanism produced by the body to activate SANs (sympathetic nervous system) in the later stages of hypovolemic shock. SANs is activated in response to the drop in mean arterial pressure that is brought on by the loss of fluid.

==Causes==
The causes of Mallory–Weiss syndrome is often associated with alcoholism, eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Specifically, up to 75% of patients have been observed with a heavy alcohol use associated with emesis.

It is also thought that Mallory–Weiss syndrome can be caused by actions that cause sudden increases in intra-abdominal pressure, such as repeated severe vomiting or coughing. There is some conflicting evidence that the presence of a hiatal hernia could be a predisposing condition to developing Mallory–Weiss syndrome. There is conflicting data suggesting the association between hiatal hernias and Mallory–Weiss syndrome. In 1989, a study conducted in Japan set out to determine if there was a link to Mallory–Weiss syndrome and hiatal hernias, this study found that hiatial hernias were found in 75% of patients with Mallory–Weiss syndrome. On the contrary, a case-control study in 2017 found there was no association between hiatal hernias and Mallory–Weiss syndrome. Forceful vomiting causes tearing of the mucosa at the junction. Additionally, the use of NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as ibuprofen, are known to increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. NSAIDs can increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding because they can cause further damage to the intestinal submucosa by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. NSAID abuse is also a rare association. In rare instances some chronic disorders like Ménière&#x27;s disease that cause long term nausea and vomiting could be a factor. Other potential risks for GI bleeds are usage of anticoagulants and older age.

Additionally, bleeding from Mallory-Weiss tears is often associated with individuals who have a history of portal hypertension and esophageal varices. Portal hypertension is where there is increased pressure within the venous portal system. Additionally, studies that were performed in patients with cirrhosis (scaring/fibrosis of the liver) who also had portal hypertension have shown that an increase in portal pressure can cause an increase in intra-abdominal pressure. These increases in intra-abdominal pressure are associated with Mallory-Weiss Syndrome. More severe upper gastrointestinal bleeds are associated with concurrent portal hypertension and esophageal varices. The formation of esophageal varices (dilated veins) is linked to the presence of portal hypertension. Additionally, esophageal varices can rupture which can be fatal.

The tear involves the mucosa and submucosa but not the muscular layer (contrast to Boerhaave syndrome which involves all the layers). Most patients are between the ages of 30 and 50 years, although it has been reported in infants aged as young as 3 weeks, as well as in older people. Hyperemesis gravidarum, which is severe morning sickness associated with vomiting and retching in pregnancy, is also a known cause of Mallory–Weiss tear.

There have been a few complications from invasive procedures such as trans-esophageal echocardiography and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy that cause Mallory-Weiss tears called iatrogenic Mallory–Weiss syndrome. However, it is infrequent since it only occurs in 0.07% to 0.49% of individuals who have received the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy procedure.

Furthermore, there were some cases reported of individuals developing Mallory-Weiss tears after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The individuals did not have a history of alcoholism, hiatal hernia, or gastrointestinal diseases, but woke up vomiting blood. A GI endoscopy was performed and tears were found on the esophagogastric junction and lesser curvature of the stomach. An increase in intragastric pressure during CPR caused the Mallory-Weiss tears.

==Diagnosis==
Definitive diagnosis of Mallory-Weiss tears is by upper GI endoscopy of the esophagus and stomach. Typically, the tear is located near the top of the stomach&#x27;s lesser curvature and below the gastroesophageal junction. In the majority of patients, tears usually range from approximately 2 to 4 cm in length. The findings may include indications of non-bleeding, active bleeding, or the presence of clot over the tear. Furthermore, an upper GI endoscopy can reveal underlying conditions that lead to the signs of bleeding secondary to the tears, including varices and ulcers along the upper GI tract. To determine if the patient has active bleedings or signs of chronic alcoholism that can precede Mallory–Weiss syndrome, the patient&#x27;s lab values would be obtained to get a complete blood count (CBC) including hematocrit &amp; hemoglobin levels alongside platelet count. Additionally, diagnosis of Mallory-Weiss Syndrome includes elimination of other causes of an upper gastrointestinal bleed and/or bleeding in general. For example, a patient should undergo more labs to determine kidney function via measuring blood urea nitrogen and creatinine as a patient with chronic kidney disease can be mistaken to have active bleeding due to anemia induced by chronic kidney disease or if both the esophageal lacerations and chronic kidney disease are contributing to the low hematocrit &amp; hemoglobin levels.

Proper history taking by the medical doctor to distinguish other conditions that cause haematemesis but definitive diagnosis is by conducting esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which is a procedure that allows the oropharynx, esophagus, stomach, and proximal duodenum (beginning of the small intestine) to be visualized.

==Treatment==
The course of treatment and management of Mallory–Weiss syndrome depends on the amount of bleeding or hematemesis. Although blood transfusion is ultimately needed for many patients with Mallory–Weiss syndrome, 90% of Mallory-Weiss tears can heal on their own spontaneously. If the bleeding is mild and localized, the condition can be managed with conservative treatment methods such as intravenous antacids, antiemetics, fasting, and bedrest. Antiemetics are medications used to help with nausea and vomiting. However, if constant bleeding is observed upon endoscopy, endoscopic hemostasis techniques are necessary as the first-line treatment. Four examples of endoscopic hemostasis techniques are hemoclipping, heat probe thermocoagulation, injection therapy, and band ligation.

Hemoclipping is an effective method for treating Mallory-Weiss tears because it uses small metal clips, which cause minimal tissue damage and stop the bleeding by clipping the affected blood vessels. Although hemoclip placement is a convenient procedure for nonfibrotic tissue, such as Mallory–Weiss syndrome, placing a hemoclip can be challenging at the typical location of Mallory-Weiss tears at the gastroesophageal junction.

Heat probe thermocoagulation is one of the endoscopic therapies used to stop bleeding by simultaneously applying heat and pressure directly on the area of the active bleed to start the coagulation. Thermocoagulation with bipolar or multipolar electrocautery can be employed to cauterize tissue. It is most appropriate for small and localized lesions that require minimal cauterization. However, it should be avoided in patients with esophageal varices as the absence of a serosal layer in the esophagus increases susceptibility to perforation and could exacerbate bleeding, posing significant risks. It should also be avoided in individuals with portal hypertension because more bleeding can occur. It is also noted that repeated coagulation therapy can lead to risk of transmural injury. Treatment is usually supportive as persistent bleeding after endoscopic treatment or esophagogastroscopy is uncommon.

Injection of epinephrine or cauterization to stop the bleeding through vasoconstriction may be undertaken during the index endoscopy procedure in the case of active and recurrent bleeding. Because it is easy to implement and widely available, such injection methods to stop bleeding are commonly used. However, this method requires close monitoring due to the possibility of causing ventricular tachycardia when administered submucosally. Thus, epinephrine injections should not be used in patients who have existing cardiovascular conditions.

Band ligation stops the bleeding by applying a direct pressure from a transparent ligation cap. The role of transparent cap is to stabilize the bleeding site and reduce the effects of peristalsis. Band ligation technique is relatively simple compared to other hemostatic techniques. Band ligation is recommended for individuals with esophageal varices or portal hypertension.

Some other options to stop bleeding include ethanol injections, ε-aminocaproic acid, or Argon plasma coagulation (APC). When endoscopy is ineffective, angiography or embolization of the arteries supplying the region may be required to stop the bleeding. If all other methods fail, high gastrostomy can be used to ligate the bleeding vessel. A Sengstaken-Blakemore tube will not be able to stop bleeding as here the bleeding is arterial and the pressure in the balloon is not sufficient to overcome the arterial pressure. After patient receives appropriate intervention, bleeding must be observed for at least 48 hours as a follow-up.

If a patient is thought to have shock, intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation should begin immediately. In the case of hypovolemic shock, patients are typically placed in the Trendelenburg position where the feet are above the head. Additionally, if there is found to be an active bleed treatment with PRBCs (packed red blood cells) is typical.

In pharmacological treatment, proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole, pantoprazole) and H2 receptor antagonist (such as famotidine) are utilized to manage and lower gastric acidity. Decreasing the acidity through use of proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists allows there to be time for healing. Proton pump inhibitors are preferred over H2 receptor antagonists because they are more potent and can keep gastric pH under control for a longer period of time. Furthermore, proton pump inhibitors have a decreased recurrent bleeding rate and do not lose their efficacy as a side effect when taken regularly over time (tachyphylaxis) compared to H2 receptor antagonists. It is recommended that individuals are given proton pump inhibitors within 72 hours of an endoscopy to prevent further GI bleeds. Additionally, antiemetics such as promethazine are given to control nausea and vomiting as part of the treatment regimen.

<text>Furl (from File Uniform Resource Locators) was a free social bookmarking website that allowed members to store searchable copies of webpages and share them with others. Every member received 5 gigabytes of storage space. The site was founded by Mike Giles in 2003 and purchased by LookSmart in September 2004. Diigo (a web annotation, social bookmarking &amp; research tool website) bought it from LookSmart in exchange for equity.

==Features==

Furl enabled members to bookmark, annotate, and share web pages. &quot;Topics&quot; were used to categorize saved sites, similar to the tagging feature of other social websites. Additionally, a user could write comments, save clippings, assign each bookmark a rating and keywords (which are given greater weight while searching), and have an option of private or public storage for each topic or item archived. 

Considered one of its main features,
Furl also privately archived a complete copy of the HTML of each page that a user bookmarks, making it accessible even if the original content was modified or removed, an antidote for link rot. This also allowed full text searches to be made within the archive. However, as highlighted under limitations below, images that were embedded using links were not archived with user&#x27;s copy of the HTML page, so images sometimes disappeared over time. To avoid claims of copyright violations, this archived copy was visible only to the member who bookmarked the page. Other users were directed to the publisher&#x27;s site, where the content could be viewed depending on membership requirements and privacy settings.

Users could see lists of other users who have &quot;furled&quot; a URL, and read their comments (if made public) to find users who share interests, supporting folksonomy. A dynamic recommendation list was automatically generated for each user based on the sites already saved by him or her and other users with similar interests. Lists of the most popular items for today, this week, and this month (and by topic) were also available. It was possible to subscribe to a user&#x27;s archive (or to a set of topics in a user&#x27;s archive) to get daily email notifications whenever new items were filed. 

Furl allowed bookmarks to be imported from (and exported to) Internet Explorer, Mozilla/Firefox, and Delicious; and also supported exporting of the entire saved archives to ZIP formats, and export metadata to XML format. There were other import/export functions, including various citation formats (MLA, APA, Chicago, CBE, BibTeX, and RIS/EndNote).
Toolbars and bookmarklets are available for Internet Explorer and Firefox to quicken the bookmarking process.

==Limitations==

Images which were embedded links were not archived with the HTML page. For example, when an HTML page was archived via Furl, the location of the JPG from the HTML content was saved, thus pulling up that image when the user&#x27;s personal copy was loaded; however, if that image no longer exists on the original server, it was lost and will not display with the user&#x27;s archived copy. So, a Furled site with many pictures could end up being just text.

The search result displayed items from the entire Furl archive, or only from a user&#x27;s own archive, but the sequence of these results was automatically ordered. There was no option to display results by date order, by popularity order, or in any other particular sequence. It was not obvious how the results are ordered.

The popularity of Furl exposed users to performance problems which began in the latter half of 2006 and persisted into 2007.

== Updates ==

New features were released in early 2007, including an updated user-interface. On January 30, 2008, Furl unveiled an updated user interface.
Furl shut down its services on April 17, 2009.

<text>William Alabaster (also Alablaster, Arblastier) (27 February 1567buried 28 April 1640) was an English Neo-Latin poet, playwright, and religious writer.

Alabaster became a Roman Catholic convert in Spain when on a diplomatic mission as chaplain. His religious beliefs led him to be imprisoned several times; eventually he gave up Catholicism, and was favoured by James I. He received a prebend in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, and the living of Therfield, Hertfordshire. He died at Little Shelford, Cambridgeshire.

==Biography==

Alabaster was born at Hadleigh, Suffolk, the son of Roger Alabaster of the Puritan cloth merchant family long settled there, and Bridget Winthrop of Groton, Suffolk. Through his mother, Alabaster was the first cousin of John Winthrop, the future Governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony.

According to Fr. John Gerard, an underground Roman Catholic priest of the Society of Jesus who briefly served as the former clergyman&#x27;s spiritual director, Alabaster was, &quot;raised in Calvin&#x27;s bosom.&quot;

He was educated at Westminster School, and Trinity College, Cambridge from 1583. He became a fellow of Trinity, and in 1592 was incorporated of the university of Oxford.

In June 1596 Alabaster sailed with Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, on the expedition to Cadiz in the capacity of Anglican military chaplain, and, while accompanying a subsequent diplomatic mission to Spain, Alabaster converted from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism. An account of his conversion is given in an obscurely worded sonnet contained in a manuscript copy of &quot;Divine Meditations, by Mr Alabaster&quot;.
Louise Imogen Guiney, however, gives a different account of Alabaster&#x27;s conversion. After returning from the diplomatic mission, the Earl of Essex had arranged for Alabaster to be assigned as Vicar of Landulph, in Cornwall. Alabaster had sought the parish because he was engaged to be married and the living was worth 400 crowns a year, which he first received on 8 September 1596.

According to Guiney, Sir Richard Topcliffe and other priest hunters covertly recruited Alabaster to meet with and persuade to convert to Anglicanism an underground Jesuit priest named Thomas Wright, the author, among many other volumes, of the samizdat book &quot;Passions of the Mind&quot;. Instead, &quot;Wright by the force of his reasoning had persuaded Alabaster of the truth of the Catholic religion&quot;. According to Guiney, the date of Alabaster&#x27;s covert reception into the illegal and underground Catholic Church in England, which caused the Vicar to willingly surrender both his living and his engagement, is fixed by an entry in his cousin Adam Winthrop&#x27;s diary as 13 July 1597.

Alabaster defended his new Faith in a pamphlet, &quot;Seven Motives&quot;, of which no copy is extant.

After his conversion and in about 1597, Alabaster wrote his Latin tragedy of &quot;Roxana&quot;, which Samuel Johnson later called, &quot;a tragedy against the Church of England.

It appears that Alabaster was imprisoned for his change of faith in the Tower of London and in The Clink in 1597 and 1598. According to historian Robert Caraman, during his incarceration, Alabaster adapted the sonnet form from love poetry into Christian poetry. Alabaster&#x27;s 85-long sonnet sequence, which &quot;portray some profound spiritual experiences&quot;, were mainly, &quot;written in 1597 while he was in The Clink prison and was conscious (as he himself says) of unwonted inspiration.&quot; Another source of &quot;unwonted inspiration&quot; for Alabaster&#x27;s religious poetry was, according to Gary Bouchard, the samizdat verse of recently martyred Jesuit priest Robert Southwell.

After his escape from The Clink, which John Chamberlain reported to Sir Dudley Carleton on 4 May 1598, Fr. John Gerard concealed William Alabaster for two or three months in a London safe house and secret Catholic chapel overseen by Anne Line and Fr. Robert Drury.

According to Fr. John Gerard, &quot;He was a learned man and spoke several languages. In order to become a Catholic he had declined many offers of high preferment in his church. Already he had had a taste of prison, and when he was offered the chance of escaping, I told him he could stay at my house.&quot;

During those months time, Fr. Gerard led Alabaster through a guided retreat based on &quot;The Spiritual Exercises&quot; of St. Ignatius Loyola and Alabaster expressed a desire to enter the Jesuit Order.

Fr. Gerard was reportedly very surprised and asked Alabaster, who, &quot; &quot;was used to having his own way over other people&quot;, to explain why he wished to join the Society, &quot;when he knew, or should know, that it meant just the contrary of all he was used to.&quot;

Alabaster&#x27;s answer satisfied Fr. Gerard&#x27;s concerns, and the latter arranged to smuggle the former Anglican clergyman, very likely through the Antwerp-based network led by Richard Verstegan, to the Spanish Netherlands and gave Alabaster 300 florins towards his future expenses.

In a subsequent interrogation on 22 July 1600, Alabaster admitted to receiving another £30 in Brussels and to having travelled to meet Fr. Robert Persons in Rome.

In 1607 Alabaster published at Antwerp &quot;Apparatus in Revelationem Jesu Christi&quot;, in which he used his study of the Kabbalah to give a mystical interpretation to the Christian Bible. The book was placed on the Vatican&#x27;s &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; early in 1610. He went to Rome and was imprisoned for a time by the Roman Inquisition, but succeeded in returning to England and again conformed to the Established Church of the Realm.

After returning to England, Alabaster became a doctor of divinity at Cambridge University and chaplain to King James I. After his marriage in 1618 his life now became more settled and he devoted his later years to theological studies. He had an appreciable library, and books with his inscription can be found in numerous libraries today.

==Personal life==
In 1618 Alabaster married Katherine Fludd, a widow, and was linked by marriage to the celebrated physician and alchemist Robert Fludd.

==Death==
He died in 1640 after serving as Vicar of St. Dunstan&#x27;s-in-the-West, at Little Shelford, Cambridgeshire.

==Works==
&quot;Roxana&quot; is modelled on the tragedies of Seneca, and is a stiff and spiritless work. Fuller and Anthony à Wood bestowed exaggerated praise on it, while Samuel Johnson regarded it as the only Latin verse worthy of notice produced in England before Milton&#x27;s elegies. &quot;Roxana&quot; is founded on the &quot;La Dalida&quot; (Venice, 1583) of Luigi Groto, known as &quot;Cieco di Hadria&quot;, and Hallam asserts that it is a plagiarism.

A surreptitious edition in 1632 was followed by an authorized version a &quot;plagiarii unguibus vindicata, aucta et agnita ab&quot; &quot;Aithore, Gulielmo, Alabastro.&quot; One book of an epic poem in Latin hexameters, in honour of Queen Elizabeth, is preserved in manuscript (MS) in the library of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. This poem, &quot;Elisaeis, Apotheosis poetica&quot;, Spenser highly esteemed. &quot;Who lives that can match that heroick song?&quot; he says in &quot;Colin Clout&#x27;s come home againe&quot;, and begs &quot;Cynthia&quot; to withdraw the poet from his obscurity.

Alabaster&#x27;s later cabalistic writings are &quot;Commentarius de Bestia Apocalyptica&quot; (1621) and &quot;Spiraculum tubarum&quot; (1633), a mystical interpretation of the Pentateuch. These theological writings won the praise of Robert Herrick, who calls him &quot;the triumph of the day&quot; and the &quot;one only glory of a million&quot;.

<text>Arcis-sur-Aube (, literally &quot;Arcis on Aube&quot;) is a commune in the Aube department in the Grand Est region of north-central France.

The commune has been awarded &quot;three flowers&quot; by the &quot;National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom&quot; in the &quot;Competition of cities and villages in Bloom&quot;.

==Geography==
Arcis-sur-Aube is located some 27 km north of Troyes and 40 km east of Romilly-sur-Seine. Access to the commune is by the D441 road from Villette-sur-Aube in the west passing through the commune and the town and continuing to Vaupoisson. The D677 also comes from Mailly-le-Camp in the north intersecting the D441 in the town and continuing south to Voué. The D31 also goes south-west from the town to Les Grandes-Chapelles. The D10 road comes from Allibaudières in the north-west and passes through the north-west of the commune joining the D441 west of the town. A railway passes through the west of the commune from north to south with a station west of the town. The Aube river marks the northern boundary of the town flowing west but the commune covers both left and right banks of the river. The D677 passes over the river on a bridge.

The right bank and a small portion of the left bank of the Aube consists of forest and farmland. The urban area of the town extends south from the left bank and occupies about a quarter of the land area. The south of the commune is entirely farmland.

==History==

*Saint Victor was a hermit and confessor at Arcis-sur-Aube in the 6th century.
*Around the same period a local coinage called Leudericus and Daovaldus was produced.
*In 1546, François I authorized the construction of walls around the city.
*Arcis has been the scene of the Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube, a bloody battle fought by Napoleon I on 1 March 1814 against the Austro-Russians: part of the city was burned. An erroneous claim has been made that Arcis-sur-Aube bares its name as a commemoration of the Cossacks from the Russian army a city in Ukraine (Artsyz) and a village in the southern Urals (Arsinski or Арсинский). In reality, the town already bore the name since medieval times, as witnessed by three sources, including The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines, which names Hilduin II as &quot;comes de Arceis et de Ramerut&quot; (count of Arcis and Ramerurpt)&quot;.&quot; 
*From 1790 to 1795 Arcis was the chief town of the arrondissement of Arcis-sur-Aube which was composed of 11 cantons and 89 communes.
*During the creation of arrondissements in 1800 Arcis became the capital of one of them but this was abolished in 1926. The cantons of Arcis-sur-Aube and Ramerupt are attached to the Arrondissement of Troyes; the Canton of Méry-sur-Seine was attached to the Arrondissement of Nogent-sur-Seine, and the Canton of Chavanges was attached to the Arrondissement of Bar-sur-Aube. This was effective from 1801: 4 cantons and 93 communes.

<doc id="1010561" wikidata="Q1753338" url="?curid=1010561" title="The Chemical Wedding (Bruce Dickinson album)">
<text>The Chemical Wedding is the fifth solo album by English heavy metal singer Bruce Dickinson, released on 15 September 1998 through Dickinson&#x27;s own label Air Raid Records. The record draws some inspiration from the works of William Blake, featuring sung and spoken excerpts of his prophetic works and poetry (notably &quot;And did those feet in ancient time&quot; on the track &quot;Jerusalem&quot;), and with cover art from his painting &quot;The Ghost of a Flea&quot;, although the name of the album and its title track derive from the Rosicrucian manifesto the &quot;Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz&quot;. As with the previous album, it featured Iron Maiden guitarist Adrian Smith, then a member of Dickinson&#x27;s solo outfit. This was his last solo album before he and Adrian Smith rejoined Iron Maiden the following year.

The film, &quot;Chemical Wedding&quot;, with a screenplay by Dickinson, was released in May 2008. It features the title track from the album on its soundtrack, but concerns a story about the reincarnation of Aleister Crowley and is otherwise unrelated.

== Lyrical themes ==
Dickinson: &quot;Each song has a sort of frame in which it operates. The first song is about fear, the second song is about tragedy, the third song is about union. You could pick a theme or a topic for each song so that&#x27;s what the song is about and then you put it in a frame. For example, one of the songs is about failure and the song is called &quot;The Trumpets of Jericho&quot;. In the story of the trumpets of Jericho in the Bible, the walls fall down when the tribes of Israel walk around the city and blow their trumpets. Except in this song they don&#x27;t, it doesn&#x27;t work. You&#x27;ve done everything right, everything&#x27;s cool but the wall&#x27;s still standing. And what do you do? How do you face up to that fact? And it&#x27;s all part of the whole alchemy thing. What were the alchemists trying to do? They were trying to achieve something that was virtually impossible, they spent their whole lives trying to do it, and all of them failed, or pretty damn near all of them failed. So, what does that feel like, and how does that work, and why keep carrying on. So that&#x27;s the way the songs kind of work. And you don&#x27;t have to go into them in all this detail, you could just sit back there and let it hit you over the head like a sledgehammer cause the album works it&#x27;s just a really heavy album. But it&#x27;s all there if you want to dig through the words.&quot;

== Additional recordings ==
According to an interview with &quot;Rock Brigade&quot; in October 1998, Bruce mentioned that the band recorded a cover of the Scorpions song, &quot;The Zoo&quot;. Although never released as a b-side or bonus track, it did see release that same year on the compilation &quot;&quot;.

==Reception==

Critical response to &quot;The Chemical Wedding&quot; was generally favourable, with AllMusic praising its &quot;modern metal aesthetic&quot;. Sputnikmusic said, &quot;Professionally written and recorded, Bruce Dickinson once again pours his soul into his music, and the result is spectacular&quot;, and went on to deem it &quot;one of the best metal albums of the late 90s&quot;. In 2005, &quot;The Chemical Wedding&quot; was ranked number 388 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In his review, Canadian journalist Martin Popoff praised Dickinson for finding &quot;creative wells that seems limitless, and groovy and literary all at once&quot; and for having recorded an album &quot;of phat, traditional, somber and aged heavy metal that sounds like bloody, beefy &quot;Piece of Mind&quot;-era Maiden crossed with &quot;Subhuman Race&quot;-era Skid Row.&quot;

== Track listing ==

Original pressings also include an untitled hidden track after 2 minutes of silence. It is a brief spoken piece that says: &quot;And all this vegetable world appeared on my left foot. As a bright sandal, formed immortal of precious stones and gold. I stooped down, and bound it on. To walk forward through eternity&quot;.

<doc id="1010562" wikidata="Q31813" url="?curid=1010562" title="Plummer–Vinson syndrome">
<text>Plummer–Vinson syndrome (also known as Paterson–Kelly syndrome or Paterson–Brown-Kelly syndrome in the UK) is a rare disease characterized by dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), iron-deficiency anemia, glossitis (inflammation of the tongue), cheilosis (cracking at the corners of the mouth), and esophageal webs (thin membranes in the esophagus that can cause obstruction). Treatment with iron supplementation and mechanical widening of the esophagus generally leads to excellent outcomes.

While exact epidemiological data are lacking, Plummer–Vinson syndrome has become extremely rare. The reduction in prevalence has been hypothesized to result from improvements in nutritional status and iron availability in countries where the syndrome was previously more common. The syndrome generally occurs in perimenopausal women. Identification and follow-up of affected individuals are important due to the increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and pharynx.

== Presentation ==
Patients with Plummer–Vinson syndrome often experience a burning sensation in the tongue and oral mucosa, and atrophy of the lingual papillae results in a smooth, shiny, red dorsum of the tongue. Common symptoms include:
* Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)
* Pain
* Weakness
* Odynophagia (painful swallowing)
* Atrophic glossitis (smooth tongue)
* Angular cheilitis (inflammation and cracking at the corners of the mouth)
* Koilonychia (abnormally thin or spoon-shaped nails)
* Splenomegaly (enlarged spleen)
* Upper esophageal webs (located in the post-cricoid region, contrasting with Schatzki rings found at the lower end of the esophagus)

Serial contrast gastrointestinal radiography or upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy may reveal the presence of esophageal webs. Blood tests typically show hypochromic microcytic anemia, consistent with iron-deficiency anemia. A biopsy of the affected mucosa usually reveals epithelial atrophy (shrinking) and varying degrees of submucosal chronic inflammation. Epithelial atypia or dysplasia may also be present. In some cases, the syndrome may manifest as post-cricoid malignancy, which can be detected by the absence of laryngeal crepitus. Normally, laryngeal crepitus is produced when the cricoid cartilage rubs against the vertebrae.

==Causes==
The cause of Plummer–Vinson syndrome is unknown; however, both genetic factors and nutritional deficiencies may play a role. The syndrome is more common in women, particularly those in middle age, with a peak incidence occurring in individuals over 50 years of age.

==Diagnosis==
The following clinical presentations may be indicative of Plummer–Vinson syndrome and may be used in its diagnosis:

# Dizziness
# Pallor of the conjunctiva and face
# Erythematous oral mucosa with a burning sensation
# Breathlessness
# Atrophic, smooth tongue
# Peripheral rhagades (cracks or fissures) around the oral cavity

The following tests are helpful in the diagnosis of Plummer–Vinson syndrome:

===Lab tests===
Complete blood cell counts, peripheral blood smears, and iron studies (e.g., serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, ferritin, and saturation percentage) are essential for confirming iron deficiency, with or without the presence of hypochromic microcytic anemia.

===Imaging===
Barium esophagography and videofluoroscopy can aid in detecting esophageal webs. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy allows for the visual confirmation of these webs, which are caused by subepithelial fibrosis.

==Prevention==
Maintaining good nutrition with adequate iron intake may help prevent this disorder. A balanced diet, combined with regular exercise, is also recommended.

==Treatment==

Treatment for Plummer–Vinson syndrome primarily focuses on correcting the underlying iron-deficiency anemia. Patients should receive iron supplementation as part of their diet, which may alleviate symptoms such as dysphagia and pain. If symptoms persist, the esophageal web can be dilated using esophageal bougies during upper endoscopy, which allows for normal swallowing and the passage of food. However, there is a risk of perforation of the esophagus with the use of dilators for treatment.

==Prognosis==
Patients generally respond well to treatment. Iron supplementation usually resolves the anemia and corrects the glossodynia (tongue pain). Plummer–Vinson syndrome is recognized as a risk factor for developing squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, esophagus, and hypopharynx. The risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is also increased, and therefore, the syndrome is considered a premalignant condition.

==Epidemiology==
Plummer–Vinson syndrome (PVS) is an extremely rare condition, and its exact prevalence remains unknown. While it is becoming less common in developed countries, the condition is increasingly found in developing regions, particularly in Asia. However, it is very rarely observed in African countries, despite the relatively high prevalence of iron deficiency there.

== History ==
The disease is named after two Americans working at the Mayo Clinic—physician Henry Stanley Plummer and surgeon Porter Paisley Vinson. In the UK, it is known as Paterson–Kelly or Paterson–Brown-Kelly syndrome, named after Derek Brown-Kelly and Donald Ross Paterson, who independently described the syndrome in 1919. Despite this, &quot;Plummer–Vinson syndrome&quot; remains the most commonly used name.

<doc id="1010567" wikidata="Q7307222" url="?curid=1010567" title="Reflected-wave switching">
<text>Reflected-wave switching is a signalling technique used in backplane computer buses such as PCI.

A backplane computer bus is a type of multilayer printed circuit board that has at least one (almost) solid layer of copper called the ground plane, and at least one layer of copper tracks that are used as wires for the signals. Each signal travels along a transmission line formed by its track and the narrow strip of ground plane directly beneath it. This structure is known in radio engineering as microstrip line.

Each signal travels from a transmitter to one or more receivers. Most computer buses use binary digital signals, which are sequences of pulses of fixed amplitude. In order to receive the correct data, the receiver must detect each pulse once, and only once. To ensure this, the designer must take the high-frequency characteristics of the microstrip into account.

When a pulse is launched into the microstrip by the transmitter, its amplitude depends on the ratio of the impedances of the transmitter and the microstrip. The impedance of the transmitter is simply its output resistance. The impedance of the microstrip is its characteristic impedance, which depends on its dimensions and on the materials used in the backplane&#x27;s construction. As the leading edge of the pulse (the &quot;incident wave&quot;) passes the receiver, it may or may not have sufficient amplitude to be detected. If it does, then the system is said to use &quot;incident-wave switching&quot;. This is the system used in most computer buses predating PCI, such as the VME bus.

When the pulse reaches the end of the microstrip, its behaviour depends on the circuit conditions at this point. If the microstrip is correctly terminated (usually with a combination of resistors), the pulse is absorbed and its energy is converted to heat. This is the case in an incident-wave switching bus. If, on the other hand, there is no termination at the end of the microstrip, and the pulse encounters an open circuit, it is reflected back towards its source. As this &quot;reflected wave&quot; travels back along the microstrip, its amplitude is added to that of the original pulse. As the reflected wave passes the receiver for a second time, this time from the opposite direction, it now has enough amplitude to be detected. This is what happens in a &quot;reflected-wave switching&quot; bus.

In incident-wave switching buses, reflections from the end of the bus are undesirable and must be prevented by adding termination. Terminating an incident-wave trace varies in complexity from a DC-balanced, AC-coupled termination to a single resistor series terminator, but all incident wave terminations consume both power and space (Johnson and Graham, 1993). However, incident-wave switching buses can be significantly longer than reflected-wave switching buses operating at the same frequency.

If the limited bus length is acceptable, a reflected-wave switching bus will use less power, and fewer components to operate at a given frequency. The bus has to be short enough, such that a pulse may travel twice the length of the backplane (one complete journey for the incident wave, and another for the reflected wave), and stabilize sufficiently to be read in a single bus cycle. The travel time can be calculated by dividing the round-trip length of the bus by the speed of propagation of the signal (which is roughly one half to two-thirds of &quot;c&quot;, the speed of light in vacuum).

<doc id="1010570" wikidata="Q1188882" url="?curid=1010570" title="Selichot">
<text>Selichot (, , &quot;səliḥā&quot;) are Jewish penitential poems and prayers, especially those said in the period leading up to the High Holidays, and on fast days. The Thirteen Attributes of Mercy are a central theme throughout these prayers.

== Selichot of the High Holidays ==
In the Sephardic tradition, recital of Selichot in preparation for the High Holidays begins on the second day of the Hebrew month of Elul. In the Ashkenazi tradition, in years where the first day of Rosh Hashanah begins on a Thursday or Saturday, selichot are recited from the Saturday night before Rosh Hashanah. If, however, the first day of Rosh Hashanah falls on a Monday or Tuesday, selichot are recited from the Saturday night more than a week before Rosh Hashanah to ensure that it is recited at least four times. This may be because originally the pious would fast for ten days during the season of repentance, and four days before Rosh Hashanah were added to compensate for the four of the Ten Days of Repentance on which fasting is forbidden – the two days of Rosh Hashanah, Shabbat Shuvah, and the day preceding Yom Kippur—and, while the fasts are observed by very few today, the Selichot that accompanied them have been retained. Alternatively, the Rosh Hashanah liturgy includes the Biblical phrase &quot;you shall observe a burnt offering&quot;, and like an offering which needs to be scrutinised for defects for four days, so too four days of self-searching are needed before the day of judgment. 

In the Italian rite, selichot always begin on a Monday or Thursday shortly before Rosh Hashanah. If Rosh Hashanah falls on Monday, they begin the previous Monday. If Rosh Hashanah falls on a Tuesday, they begin on the Monday eight days before. If Rosh Hashana falls on Thursday, they begin the previous Thursday. If Rosh Hashanah falls on Shabbat, they begin the Monday of that week.

Selichot refers to both the piyyutim that compose the service as well as to the service itself. In most Sephardic communities, selichot services are identical each day. However, some North African communities recited different selichot on Mondays, Thursdays and Shabbat, following the order in &quot;Siftei Renanot&quot;, while keeping the &quot;standard&quot; order on days without Torah Reading. In the Eastern Ashkenazic tradition, although the text and length of specific prayers varies from day to day, the overall format remains the same and is prefaced by Ashrei () and the Half-Kaddish. In the Western Ashkenazic tradition, there is similarly an overall format, but it begins with Adon Olam or Lecha Hashem Ha&#x27;Tzedaka, and the Half-Kaddish follows the first set of the thirteen attributes.

Selichot are usually recited between midnight and dawn. Some recite it at night after the Maariv prayer, or in the morning before Shacharit, due to the convenience of synagogue attendance when a prayer is already taking place there.

The most popular night of Selichot in the Ashkenazi tradition is the first night, when many women and girls as well as men and boys attend the late-night service on Saturday night. In some communities, the hazzan wears a kittel and sings elaborate melodies. In some congregations, it is not unusual for a choir to participate in this first night&#x27;s service. In the Eastern Ashkenazic tradition, this night also has more Selichot than any other night prior to Rosh Hashanah eve. The other nights are sometimes more sparsely attended and those services are often led by a layperson, rather than a trained musician, and with melodies that are less elaborate than the first night.

In addition to the Selichot of the High Holiday period, the recitation of Selichot on Yom Kippur itself is the centerpiece and most important part of the liturgy, recited in all of the prayers of the day. Beginning in the late 19th Century, many communities in Eastern Europe stopped reciting Selichot except at Maariv and Neilah. Western Ashkenazic communities, as well as a small number of Eastern Ashkenazic communities, maintain the recitation of Selichot in all of the prayers of Yom Kippur. Italian rite communities recite Selichot on Yom Kippur in all of the prayers except Musaf. Sephardic communities also recite Selichot at all of the prayers of Yom Kippur, although they recite them after the Chazzan&#x27;s repetition rather than as a part of it.

=== Categories of Selichot ===
Categories of Selichot in the Ashkenazic tradition may include:
* ( &#x27;forgiveness&#x27;) – This is the default Selichah and comprises the vast majority of the Selichot service. These can be subdivided into categories of &quot;Sheinya&quot; (with two line stanzas), &quot;Shelishiya&quot; (with three line stanzas) and &quot;Shalmonit&quot; (with four line stanzas).
* ( &#x27;chorus&#x27;) – These central Selichot vary according to the day and contain a chorus which is repeated after each stanza.
* ( &#x27;binding&#x27;, a word which specifically refers to the Binding of Isaac) – This Selichah contains the theme of the &quot;Akeidah&quot; as a merit for God answering our prayers. In the Ashkenazic selichot rites, these poems are recited on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, during the Ten Days of Repentance, and on Yom Kippur itself (but not during the first days of selichot prior to the eve of Rosh Hashanah). Depending on the specific rite, these poems are recited immediately before or immediately after the Pizmon.
* ( &#x27;we have sinned&#x27;) – Starting on the evening before Rosh Hashanah [and in the Western rites, even on the first days] and continuing through Yom Kippur, this Selichah is said after the final recitation of the Thirteen Attributes and before the &quot;Vidui&quot; confessional. It contains as its refrain, (&#x27;We have sinned, our Rock; forgive us, our Creator&#x27;). Perhaps the most famous Chatanu Selichah is the martyrology from the Midrash Eleh Ezkerah recited in the Eastern Ashkenazic rite during Musaf on Yom Kippur or at other times in other rites. The recitation of this refrain has been partially or entirely abandoned in many communities.
* ( &#x27;petition&#x27;) – It is recited during Tachnun at the very end of the Selichot service. In the Ashkenazic selichot rites, these poems are recited on the eve of Rosh Hashanah and during the Ten Days of Repentance (but generally not during the first days of selichot prior to the eve of Rosh Hashanah).

== Selichot of Fast Days ==

On minor fast days (including the Fast of Behav), some communities recite Selichot after the conclusion of the Shacharit Amidah. The content of these prayers is related to the specific fast day. In some communities (especially Western Ashkenazic communities, but also some Eastern Ashkenazic communities), the older practice is maintained to insert the recitation of the Selichot of minor fast days in the middle of the blessing for forgiveness (סלח לנו כי חטאנו) in the repetition of the Shacharit Amidah.

In Ashkenazic commuinities, Selichot are recited on the Fast of Gedaliah only before the prayer service like the selichot of the High Holidays; in many Sephardic communities, additional selichot are recited after the Amidah just like any other fast day. Selichot are not recited in any community today on the major fast day of Tisha B&#x27;Av, although they were recited by the Geonim of Babylonia.
==Selichot on other occasions==
In addition to High Holidays and Fast Days, there were communities that recited Selichot on Hoshana Rabbah.

Additionally, in the early modern period, there were &quot;shomerim la-boker societies&quot; which recited Selichot on every day of the year that Tachanun is recited.

== Selichot rites ==
There are at least thirteen Ashkenazic printed rites for selichot:

The following eight are variations of the Western Ashkenazic rite:
#Frankfurt and its surroundings
#Alsace
#Italian Ashkenazim
#Nuremberg and Fürth
#Switzerland and Swabia
#Worms
#Cologne
#Floß

The following five are variations of the Eastern Ashkenazic rite:
#Poland (Polin)
#Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, and Hungary
#Lithuania and Samogitia (Lita and Zamut)
#Poznań and Grodno
#Old Synagogue in Prague

Among 21st century Ashkenazi Jewish communities, the Polin and Lita variations are dominant, although Bohemia is the most common in England. Some associate Lita with Nusach Ashkenaz and Polin with Nusach Sefard, likely because in early 20th Century most Jews in Poland had adopted Nusach Sefard, whereas most Jews in Lithuania maintained Nusach Ashkenaz. However, the differences between Polin and Lita Selichot have origins several hundred years before the advent of Nusach Sefard, and the minhagim were geographic rather than ideological. Chabad recites Selichot according to Nusach Lita because they are from Lithuania, and there are Polish mitnagdim who recite Selichot according to Nusach Polin.

The poems recited in the major variations, with their assigned numbers, are as follows (page numbers in superscript to the right):

<text>Tattooed Millionaire is the debut solo studio album by Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson, released in 1990.

The album project began when Dickinson was asked to record a song for &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child&quot;, and so wrote &quot;Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter&quot;. Collaborating with future Iron Maiden guitarist Janick Gers, Dickinson began creating a solo album which was fundamentally different from his works with Iron Maiden, with a hard rock sound that is less progressive. &quot;Bring your Daughter...&quot; wasn&#x27;t included on the original release, as Iron Maiden planned to record an alternate version for their 1990 album &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot;, which went on to become the band&#x27;s only number one single on the UK Singles Chart to date.

The album did however yield four Top 40 singles in the UK, with the lead and title single &quot;Tattooed Millionaire&quot;, reaching No. 18. A cover of the David Bowie penned, Mott the Hoople hit &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot;, was also a relative success, reaching No. 23.

<doc id="1010583" wikidata="Q605384" url="?curid=1010583" title="Crate">
<text>A crate is a large shipping container, often made of wood, typically used to transport or store large, heavy items. Steel and aluminium crates are also used. Specialized crates were designed for specific products, and were often made to be reusable, such as the &quot;bottle crates&quot; for milk and soft drinks.

Crates can be made of wood, plastic, metal or other materials. The term &quot;crate&quot; often implies a large and strong container. Most plastic crates are smaller and are more commonly called a case or container. Metal is rarely used because of its weight. When metal is used, a crate is often constructed as an &quot;open crate&quot; and may be termed a cage. Although a crate may be made of any material, for these reasons, the term &#x27;crate&#x27; used alone often implies one constructed of wood.

== Wooden crates ==

A wooden crate has a self-supporting structure, with or without sheathing. For a wooden container to be a crate, all six of its sides must be put in place to result in the rated strength of the container. Crates are distinct from wooden boxes. The strength of a wooden box is rated based on the weight it can carry before the top (top, ends, and sides) is installed, whereas the strength of a crate is rated with the top in place. In general conversation, the term crate is sometimes used to denote a wooden box.
=== History ===

Crates had been used for many years without a clear origin in documented history. Modern crates from the early 20th century demonstrate a very evolved technology already considering practical and economic considerations built into crate designs. Moving heavy products such as enamelled cast iron sinks, bath tubs, and lavatories was often done without any packaging prior to 1910, which lead to nearly 20% losses due to chipping of the enamel in shipping. Some manufacturers assumed that protecting the product in rugged crating would reduce their losses, however, they found that railroad and shipping workers would handle the crates much more roughly when in a heavy crate, and losses actually increased. The technological solution was to pack enameled bath ware into open crates, which allowed the shipment to be lighter and cheaper, the handlers to use more precautions knowing what merchandise was being shipped, and allowed the customer to inspect the purchase at arrival before opening it. Another early documented reference to a shipping crate in the United States is in a 1930 handbook, &quot;Technical Bulletin No. 171&quot; written by C. A. Plaskett for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Plaskett was known for his extensive testing and defining of various components of transport packaging.
The USDA Forest Service revised and expanded it in 1964 as the &quot;Wood Crate Design Manual&quot;, Handbook 252.

=== Construction ===
Although the definition of a wooden crate, as compared to a wooden box, is clear, construction of the two often results in a container that is not clearly a crate or a box. Both wooden crates and wooden boxes are constructed to contain unique items, the design of either a crate or box may use principles from both. In this case, the container will typically be defined by how the edges and corners of the container are constructed. If the sheathing (either plywood or lumber) can be removed, and a framed structure will remain standing, the container would likely be termed a crate. If removal of the sheathing results in no way of fastening the lumber around the edges of the container, the container would likely be termed a wooden box.

=== Design ===
There are many variations of wooden crate designs. By far the most common are &#x27;closed&#x27;, &#x27;open&#x27; and &#x27;framed&#x27;. A Closed Crate is one that is completely or nearly completely enclosed with material such as plywood or lumber boards. When lumber is used, gaps are often left between the boards to allow for expansion. An Open Crate is one that (typically) uses lumber for sheathing. The sheathing is typically gapped by at various distances. There is no strict definition of an open crate as compared to a closed crate. Typically when the gap between boards is greater than the distance required for expansion, the crate would be considered an open crate. The gap between boards would typically not be greater than the width of the sheathing boards. When the gap is larger, the boards are often considered &#x27;cleats&#x27; rather than sheathing thus rendering the crate unsheathed. An unsheathed crate is a frame crate. A Frame Crate is one that only contains a skeletal structure and no material is added for surface or pilferage protection. Typically an open crate will be constructed of 12 pieces of lumber, each along an outer edge of the content and more lumber placed diagonally to avoid distortion from torque.

When any type of crate reaches a certain size, more boards may be added. These boards are often called cleats. A cleat is used to provide support to a panel when that panel has reached a size that may require added support based on the method of transportation. Cleats may be placed anywhere between the edges of a given panel. On crates, cleat placement is often determined by the width of the plywood used on plywood sheathed crates. On other crates, cleats are often evenly spaced as required to strengthen the panel. Sometimes two cleats are added across the top panel of a crate placed as needed to give the top of the crate added strength where lifting chains or straps may press on the crate while lifting. When the dimensions of a crate side necessitate more than one piece of plywood be used in that crate side&#x27;s construction, additional boards called &#x27;battens&#x27; are used to cover and provide support to the seams between abutting pieces of plywood. Battens are typically wider than cleats, but do not need to be so.

Cleats may have more specific names based on added benefit they provide. Some published standards only use those more descriptive terms and may never refer to these various lumber components as cleats. For example, lumber placed under the top of a wood container to add support for a large top are called &quot;joists&quot;. Lumber is built into the midsection of the top of a wood container to strengthen the top are called &quot;cleats&quot;. When the cleats are enlarged and constructed to support a large top, they may generically be termed &quot;cleats&quot; or more specifically be termed &quot;joists&quot;.
&quot;Skids&quot; or thick bottom runners, are sometimes specified to allow forklift trucks access for lifting.

Transportation methods and storage conditions must always be considered when designing a crate. Every step of the transportation chain will result in different stresses from shock and vibration. Differences in pressure, temperature and humidity may not only adversely affect the content of the crate, but also will have an effect on the holding strength of the fasteners (mostly the nails and staples) in the crate. In some countries, any wooden crate being designed to ship overseas must be treated to ISPM 15 standards or commonly known as the “bug stamp” to prevent the spread of disease and insects.

Although the above definition almost always stands true, there are many slightly altered or &#x27;sub-definitions&#x27; used by and in various organizations, agencies and documents. This is the result of the small size of the industry and the fact that a single, finite definition of an item that is different every time it is made can be difficult to define.

IATA, the International Air Transport Association, for example, doesn&#x27;t allow crates on airplanes because it defines a crate as an open transport container. Although a crate can be of the Open or Framed variety, having no sheathing, a Closed crate is not open and is just as safe to ship in as a wooden box, which is allowed by IATA.

==Other crates==

Milk crates and bottle crates are a form of reusable packaging used to ship to retail stores and to return empty bottles to the bottler or packager. These are usually moulded plastic designs expected to make several round trip shipments. Wood structures are also used.

<text>Balls to Picasso is the second solo album by Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson, released in 1994. It is the first album in Dickinson&#x27;s solo career that was released after he had officially left Iron Maiden (although he rejoined again in 1999).

This record marked the beginning of Dickinson&#x27;s collaborations with guitarist Roy Z, who would work on many of Dickinson&#x27;s later albums including &quot;Accident of Birth&quot;, &quot;The Chemical Wedding&quot; and &quot;Tyranny of Souls&quot;. Stylistically it departs from &quot;Tattooed Millionaire&quot; but is still more traditional-sounding than the follow-up album &quot;Skunkworks&quot; released in 1996. Later, Dickinson said that he and Roy Z were talked into making the album less heavy than it should have been.

==Overview==
Dickinson started working on his second solo album while still in Iron Maiden. For the very first recording sessions he recruited the British band Skin. Not satisfied with the style of the effort, Dickinson aborted the recording. His next attempt at a second solo album was a collaboration with producer Keith Olsen. &quot;Over and Out&quot;, &quot;Tibet&quot;, &quot;Tears of the Dragon (First Bit, Long Bit, Last Bit)&quot;, &quot;Cadillac Gas Mask&quot;, and &quot;No Way Out...Continued&quot; are all songs recorded with Olsen and set for inclusion on the second, aborted version of &quot;Balls to Picasso&quot;, also referred to by insiders as &quot;The Peter Gabriel Album&quot;. Other songs from these sessions that have yet to surface on any Dickinson release include &quot;Man of Sorrows&quot; (re-recorded for &quot;Accident of Birth&quot;; an older demo version from 1990 appears on &quot;The Best of Bruce Dickinson&quot;), &quot;Original Sin&quot; and &quot;Thank Heaven&quot;.

Dickinson decided to scrap this project as well and teamed up with guitarist Roy Z and his band Tribe of Gypsies to write and record &quot;Balls to Picasso&quot;. The song &quot;Change of Heart&quot; was originally written and demoed by Roy Z and vocalist Rob Rock with their band Driver. Dickinson changed the lyrics for the version that was recorded for &quot;Balls to Picasso&quot;. Z and Rock finally recorded and released their version when Driver reunited for their 2008 debut album, &quot;Sons of Thunder&quot;. Songs from the previous recording sessions later resurfaced as b-sides on singles from &quot;Balls to Picasso&quot; and subsequently also as bonus tracks on the album&#x27;s 2005 extended edition.

In the &quot;Anthology&quot; DVD, Dickinson said that he regrets not naming the album &quot;Laughing in the Hiding Bush&quot; after the song of the same name. The song itself is dedicated to his son, Austin, who penned the title.

&quot;Balls to Picasso&quot; was also released in DVD-Audio 5.1 mix and DualDisc (CD/DVD-Audio 5.1 mix) versions by Sanctuary Records.

==Cover artwork==
In a 1996 interview with Tom Russell of Glasgow-based Radio Clyde 1, Bruce revealed that the album was originally to be titled &quot;Laughing in the Hiding Bush&quot;. The artwork was designed by Storm Thorgerson – but they couldn&#x27;t afford it. His album&#x27;s title was changed and he drew two squares on a toilet wall for the cover, and Thorgerson&#x27;s artwork later ended up as the cover for the Anthrax album &quot;Stomp 442&quot;.

Thorgerson later did the artwork for Bruce&#x27;s &quot;Skunkworks&quot; album.

<text>Music, Martinis and Misanthropy is an album by Boyd Rice, released in 1990 by New European Recordings. It was recorded in Tokyo, Japan and Denver, Colorado between July 1989 and March 1990 and features several notable neofolk artists - Douglas P. (of Death in June), Tony Wakeford (of Sol Invictus), Rose McDowall (of Strawberry Switchblade) and Michael Moynihan and Bob Ferbrache of Blood Axis. Most of the music was arranged by Douglas P. in collaboration with Rice and Ferbrache.

This album was inspired by Rod McKuen&#x27;s spoken word albums and Jackie Gleason&#x27;s romantic recordings from the 1950s. The title and album cover are a tribute to Gleasons&#x27;s album, &quot;Music, Martinis, and Memories&quot;. The liner notes thank Anton LaVey, Rod McKuen, Ragnar Redbeard, Lee Hazlewood, Pat Purdy, Richard and Karen C., The Everly Brothers&#x27; Father, Walt Disney, Artie De Gobineau and &quot;Big&quot; Jim Huberty.

<doc id="1010592" wikidata="Q5194855" url="?curid=1010592" title="Curling's ulcer">
<text>Curling&#x27;s ulcer is an acute gastric erosion resulting as a complication from severe burns when reduced plasma volume leads to ischemia and cell necrosis (sloughing) of the gastric mucosa. The condition was first described in 1823 and named after Thomas Blizard Curling, who observed ten such cases in 1842.

These stress ulcers (actually shallow multiple erosions) were once a common complication of serious burns, presenting in over 10% of cases, and especially common in child burn victims. They result in perforation and hemorrhage more often than other forms of intestinal ulceration and had correspondingly high mortality rates (at least 80%).

==Treatment==
While emergency surgery was once the only treatment, combination therapies including enteral feeding with powerful antacids such as H2-receptor antagonists or, more recently, proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole have made Curling&#x27;s ulcer a rare complication.

<text>A Cushing ulcer, named after Harvey Cushing, is a gastric ulcer associated with elevated intracranial pressure. It is also called von Rokitansky–Cushing syndrome. Apart from the stomach, ulcers may also develop in the proximal duodenum and distal esophagus.

==Causes==
The mechanism of development of Cushing ulcers is thought to be due to direct stimulation of vagal nuclei as a result of increased intracranial pressure. Brain tumors, traumatic head injury, and other intracranial processes including infections, can cause increased intracranial pressure and lead to overstimulation of the vagus nerve. Efferent fibers of the vagus nerve then release acetylcholine onto gastric parietal cell M3 receptors, causing insertion of hydrogen potassium ATPase vesicles into the apical plasma membrane. The end result is increased secretion of gastric acid with eventual ulceration of the gastric mucosa.

==Diagnosis==
As Cushing ulcers have a higher incidence of developing after shock, sepsis or trauma, diagnosis should include recent medical history evaluation. Both endoscopy and angiography can be used to locate the lesion or ulcer, though endoscopy is more commonly used as a first-line diagnosis procedure.

==Treatment==
Most episodes of Cushing ulceration resolve on medical intervention, consisting primarily of rinsing the area with saline and the administration of antacids.

<text>Alive in Studio A is a heavy metal album released by Iron Maiden frontman Bruce Dickinson in 1995.

The album does not include new songs but instead re-recordings of songs from Bruce&#x27;s first two solo-albums &quot;Tattooed Millionaire&quot; and &quot;Balls to Picasso&quot; with his new band line-up. This line-up would record the next album, &quot;Skunkworks&quot;. The first CD was recorded live at Metropolis Studios, London, while the second CD is composed of live-recordings at the Marquee Club with his new band.

The idea was for a low-key release of these double albums, and, according to the booklet in the 2005 re-release, Bruce Dickinson was less than pleased when the record company tried to pass them off as new material. &quot;Alive In Studio A&quot; was originally meant as a live session to be played on a US radio station, however, this never took place.

<doc id="1010600" wikidata="Q870891" url="?curid=1010600" title="Linitis plastica">
<text>Linitis plastica (sometimes referred to as leather bottle stomach) is a morphological variant of diffuse stomach cancer in which the stomach wall becomes thick and rigid.

Linitis plastica is a type of adenocarcinoma and accounts for 3–19% of gastric adenocarcinomas. Causes of cancerous linitis plastica are commonly primary gastric cancer, but in rarer cases could be metastatic infiltration of the stomach, particularly breast and lung carcinoma. It is not associated with &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection or chronic gastritis. The risk factors are undefined, except for rare inherited mutations in E-cadherin. The hereditary form of this cancer, hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, accounts for only 1–3% of gastric adenocarcinomas. Somatic mutations in this gene are found in about 50% of diffuse-type gastric carcinomas.

==Signs and symptoms==

Diffuse stomach cancer is characterized by the presence of poorly differentiated tumor cells. Under a microscope, these appear as signet ring cells, meaning that mucin droplets are visible that displace the nucleus to one side.

Symptoms of linitis plastica do not usually present until the disease is in an advanced stage, making early diagnosis difficult. Symptoms are similar to those of stomach cancer including: difficulty swallowing, weight loss, indigestion, and vomiting.

== History ==
The condition was defined by William Brinton in 1859.

==Notable cases==
Napoleon Bonaparte and many members of his family are thought to have died from this type of cancer, although it is believed by others that he may have died from arsenic poisoning.

<doc id="1010604" wikidata="Q328269" url="?curid=1010604" title="Frederick Weld">
<text>Sir Frederick Aloysius Weld (9 May 1823 – 20 July 1891), was an English-born New Zealand politician and colonial administrator of various British colonies and territories located in Oceania and Southeast Asia. He was the sixth Prime Minister of New Zealand, and later served as Governor of Western Australia, Governor of Tasmania, and Governor of the Straits Settlements.

==Early life==
Weld was born near Bridport, Dorset, England, on 9 May 1823. His mother, Christina Maria Clifford, was the daughter of Baron Clifford of Chudleigh. Both of his parents were from old recusant Catholic families.

His father, Humphrey Weld of Chideock, was a member of the Weld family. Humphrey&#x27;s father Thomas Weld (of Lulworth) donated the land and endowed the Jesuit college at Stonyhurst. Weld&#x27;s upbringing was strongly grounded in the Roman Catholic faith. His early years were spent with his parents in the Restored Kingdom of France. Later, he received a good education, studying at Stonyhurst before attending a predecessor of the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, where he studied philosophy, chemistry, European languages, and law. He had originally intended to pursue a military career, but was convinced otherwise by his tutor at Fribourg. He instead decided to seek a career in the British colonies, and arrived in Wellington, Colony of New Zealand, on 22 April 1844.

In the Colony of New Zealand, he entered a partnership with his cousin, Charles Clifford. The two established a number of sheep stations around the country, and Weld became relatively prosperous. Weld found a life of agricultural management to be too mundane, however, and soon became active in political concerns. One of his more significant campaigns was to ward against any potential discrimination against Roman Catholics in New Zealand. He later became active in lobbying for representative government in New Zealand.

In 1848, Weld declined an offer by the Governor of New Zealand, Sir George Grey, of a seat on a proposed nominee council. In 1852 he visited England, where he published a pamphlet, &quot;Hints to Intending Sheep Farmers in New Zealand&quot;, which ran into three editions.

==Member of Parliament==
 
 
When the creation of the New Zealand Parliament was announced, Weld stood for election. He became a member of the 1st Parliament as the representative of Wairau, an electorate in the northeast of the South Island; he was declared elected unopposed. The main political division of the day was between &quot;centralists&quot; (favouring a strong central government) and &quot;provincialists&quot; (favouring strong regional governments). On this spectrum, Weld established himself as a moderate centralist, although he tended to oppose the extremes of either side.

Weld was also a member of the brief &quot;cabinet&quot; formed around James FitzGerald. This represented an attempt by Parliament to assume direct responsibility for administering New Zealand. Acting Governor Robert Wynyard managed to block this move, however, and Weld&#x27;s role as a &quot;minister&quot; came to an end. Despite the failure of the FitzGerald &quot;cabinet&quot;, Weld was pleased that Catholics were able to participate fully in politics. The fact that Charles Clifford, also a Catholic, had become Speaker was also encouraging to him.

Weld resigned from Parliament in June 1855, a short while before the end of its first term, returning to England for a brief time. When he returned, he was elected to the 2nd Parliament in a by-election, again representing Wairau. He briefly returned to England again in late 1858 to marry his second cousin, Filumena Mary Anne Lisle Phillipps, daughter of Ambrose Lisle March Phillipps De Lisle and a great grandchild of the 4th Baron Clifford of Chudleigh like Weld, with whom he would have thirteen children.

===Cabinet minister===
In 1860, Weld was invited to join Edward Stafford&#x27;s government, taking over responsibility for Native Affairs from William Richmond. In this role, Weld had to contend with conflicts such as the First Taranaki War. Although Weld disliked the prospect of war, and believed that Governor George Grey had mishandled the situation, he believed strongly in the need to assert the power of the government, describing it as a &quot;painful duty&quot;. He unexpectedly lost the 1861 election in Wairau against William Henry Eyes, but due to the staggered election dates successfully stood in the neighbouring electorate a fortnight later, where he defeated Charles Hunter Brown. Weld lost his ministerial position when the Stafford administration was defeated.

In 1864, the government of Frederick Whitaker resigned due to disputes with the Governor. The point in question was who should bear responsibility for funding British troops stationed in New Zealand. Weld, believing that it was British ineptitude that caused conflict with the Māori in the first place, strongly objected to Grey&#x27;s demands that Parliament should fund the troops. Weld instead believed that British troops should be removed from New Zealand altogether, and be replaced by local forces.

===Premier of New Zealand===

As Premier, Weld met with mixed success. In 1865 the capital was moved to Wellington, and his proposals for Māori relations were adopted. These two things generated considerable bitterness, however – Aucklanders were angry about the change of capital, and Māori were angry about the confiscation of over a million acres (4,000 km2) of land in the Waikato area. Weld&#x27;s other success, the withdrawal of British troops from New Zealand, was also controversial, and generated considerable hostility from the Governor. In addition, the government&#x27;s financial situation was precarious. A little less than a year after taking office, Weld&#x27;s government resigned.

==Colonial governorships==
Weld, suffering from poor health and stress, retired from politics in 1866, and returned to England the following year. However his health improved, and he began working again. In 1869 he published &quot;Notes on New Zealand Affairs&quot;, and in March of the same year he began a career as a British colonial governor with an appointment to the post of Governor of Western Australia.

===Governor of Western Australia===
Weld arrived in Western Australia in September, 1869. He immediately embarked on a series of tours of the state, which saw him travel about 1,200 miles (1,900 km) on horseback in his first six months in office. Impressed by the state&#x27;s isolation, he urged the establishment of telegraph lines and improvements to transportation. In March, 1870, he sent John Forrest to explore and survey a possible route for a telegraph line between Albany and Adelaide. This was later built, and by 1874, the state had more than 900 miles (1400 km) of operational telegraph line. Weld also oversaw the establishment of a steamship service along the coast, and the beginnings of a rail system.

Weld saw his appointment to the governorship as a mandate to institute similar constitutional changes to that achieved in New Zealand. With the enthusiastic support of his Colonial Secretary Frederick Barlee, he set about promoting representative government. At the first opportunity, Weld introduced a Bill which provided for the election of 12 Members of the Legislative Council, to sit with six official and nominee members. The Bill was eventually passed on 1 June 1870. Barlee then began agitating for responsible government, and in 1874 the Legislative Council passed a resolution calling for it. Although Weld did not think that Western Australia was ready for responsible government, he accepted the situation and passed on the request to the Colonial Office in London. The Colonial Office were strongly against granting responsible government, and were critical of Weld for allowing the situation to arise. In 1874, Weld went on leave to New Zealand to look after his partnership affairs. He is said to have remarked, upon his departure, &quot;At last she moves&quot;, in reference to the improvements he perceived in Western Australia. On this return, he was transferred to the post of Governor of Tasmania, and the issue of responsible government was dropped until 1890.

===Other colonial governorships===
Weld was Governor of Tasmania from 1875 to 1880. He found the role much less taxing than in Western Australia, as Tasmania already had responsible government and his main duty was to preside at meetings of the Executive Council. From 1880 to 1887, he was Governor of the Straits Settlements, consisting of Malacca, Penang, and Singapore. Louch (1966) writes of Weld&#x27;s seven years in Singapore: &quot;It was there with his wealth of experience that he found the fullest scope for his talents as a colonial administrator, and where he is best remembered now.&quot; He was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1875, promoted to Knight Commander of the order (KCMG) in the 1880 Birthday Honours, and promoted again to Knight Grand Cross (GCMG) in the 1885 Birthday Honours.

He was a devout Catholic all his life, and the Pope made him a knight of the Order of Pius IX.

==Governor of the Straits Settlements==

===Malay States Administration===
In 1880, Sir Frederick Weld arrived in the Straits Settlements. He began to take personal interest in the development of the Malay States. In the middle of 1881, Weld visited the town of Taiping, in Perak. He found &quot;the revenue increasing and everything going on excellent well...&quot; but &quot;labour for public works and roads and to develop other industries and sources of revenue besides tin-mining,&quot; he lamented, &quot;is the great want&quot;. he also reported that:

&quot;Water supply for Taiping from the hill (Maxwell Hill), the roads to Krian, which will connect Taiping town centre with Province Wellesley, and a rail and tramway from Taiping to the port (Port Weld, which was named after him) are amongst the next most necessary works to be undertaken. the town of Taiping has been much improved since the fire, which took place rather more than a year ago; new streets have been laid out to considerable width, and a better class of houses has been built&quot;

The construction of the Taiping – Port Weld railway was the beginning of a major transformation altering radically the landscape of the Malay Peninsula. It also brought the first influx of Indians (mainly Tamils) and Ceylonese to Perak. Sir Frederick Weld was in Taiping again in 1883 where he &quot;inspected everything&quot;. He spent time going down the Port Weld railway line, then in the course of construction, &quot;on a truck behind the Engine&quot;. He also put into effect plans to build a telegraph line along the road linking Taiping with Province Wellesley. It was nearing completion after which a railway along the same route would be constructed.

==Later life==
Weld finally retired from political life in 1887, although he remained active in other fields of work. In 1891, visiting the Straits Settlements once again, he contracted a serious illness, and returned to England. He died in Chideock on 20 July 1891.

<text>Stephen Ray Perry (born January 22, 1949) is an American singer and songwriter. He was the lead singer and frontman of the rock band Journey during their most successful years from 1977 to 1987, and again from 1995 to 1998. He wrote/co-wrote several Journey hit songs, including &quot;Any Way You Want It&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Open Arms&quot; and &quot;Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)&quot;. Perry had a successful solo career between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s, made sporadic appearances in the 2000s, and returned to music full-time in 2018.

Perry&#x27;s singing voice has garnered acclaim from prominent musical peers and publications; he has been dubbed &quot;The Voice&quot;, a moniker originally coined by Jon Bon Jovi. Ranked No. 76 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;, Perry was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Journey on April 7, 2017.

In August 2023, Perry made the &quot;Billboard&quot; list of the 50 greatest rock lead singers of all time, coming in at number 30. At the same time, &quot;Billboard&quot; readers chose Perry as their favorite rock singer of all time, with 67 percent of the overall votes.

==Early life==
Stephen Ray Perry was born in Hanford, California, to Portuguese parents from the Azores. He is an only child. Perry grew up interested in music, as his father, Raymond Perry (Pereira), was a vocalist and co-owner of radio station KNGS. Perry&#x27;s parents ended their relationship when he was eight. He and his mother then moved to his grandparents&#x27; dairy farm.

On Perry&#x27;s 12th birthday, his mother, Mary Quaresma, presented him with a gold eighth note pendant; Perry wears the pendant for good luck. At age 12, Perry heard Sam Cooke&#x27;s song &quot;Cupid&quot; on his mother&#x27;s car radio, and it inspired him to become a singer.

==Career==
===Early career===
In his early 20s, Perry moved to Sacramento to start a band, later named Ice, with 16-year-old future music producer Scott Mathews, who co-wrote, played drums and guitar and sang. In 1972, they recorded at the Record Plant studios in Los Angeles by day while Stevie Wonder recorded his &quot;Talking Book&quot; album by night. Upon returning to Sacramento, Ice disbanded as they had no management, Mathews was still in high school, and the recordings went virtually unheard. In 1975, Perry moved to Thousand Oaks, California, where he formed a progressive rock band called Pieces with Tim Bogert (who had previously worked with Jeff Beck), Denver Cross, and Eddie Tuduri. After a year and a half, the group was unable to secure a record deal and disbanded. Perry also unsuccessfully auditioned to replace Rod Evans in Captain Beyond.

Perry then moved to Banta, a small community near Tracy, California, where he fronted the band Alien Project in his mid-20s. He nearly gave up music when the bassist of that band, Richard Michaels, was killed in an automobile accident. 

===Journey era===

Upon returning to Lemoore, Perry decided not to continue his singing career, but at the urging of his mother, he answered a call from Herbie Herbert, manager of struggling San Francisco-based band Journey. Herbert had been given a demo of an Alien Project song, &quot;If You Need Me, Call Me&quot;, and was told by producer Scott Mathews that the young singer would be a great replacement for then-current frontman Robert Fleischman. Fleischman had never signed with Herbert&#x27;s company (preferring his previous manager) and had not fully coalesced with the band&#x27;s then progressive rock style. Perry was brought on tour and to avoid alarming Fleischman was referred to as a roadie&#x27;s Portuguese cousin. During a soundcheck in Long Beach, Perry surreptitiously performed a song with Journey while Fleischman was away from the stage; soon thereafter, Herbert informed the band members that Perry was the new lead singer.

Perry brought a radically new, more pop-influenced style sense to the band&#x27;s music despite some grumblings from the band&#x27;s existing members and fans of Journey&#x27;s progressive rock sound. He made his public debut on October 28, 1977, in San Francisco to a mixed reception. Perry eventually won over new fans on his first album with the group, &quot;Infinity,&quot; which included a single he wrote called &quot;Lights&quot;. The band&#x27;s style changed dramatically, but as Journey began to garner airplay and media buzz over &quot;Infinity&quot;, Perry&#x27;s arrival was fully accepted.

Perry provided lead vocals on nine of Journey&#x27;s albums: &quot;Infinity&quot; (1978), &quot;Evolution&quot; (1979), &quot;Departure&quot; (1980), &quot;Dream, After Dream&quot; (1980, a Japanese movie soundtrack), &quot;Captured&quot; (1980, a live album), &quot;Escape&quot; (1981, which reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart), &quot;Frontiers&quot; (1983), &quot;Raised on Radio&quot; (1986), and &quot;Trial By Fire&quot; (1996). The single &quot;Open Arms&quot; from &quot;Escape&quot; was their biggest hit single, charting at No. 2 for six weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

During his Journey tenure, Perry also sang backing vocals on several Sammy Hagar songs, including the 1980 tracks &quot;The Iceman&quot; (a nickname Hagar had for Scott Mathews) and &quot;Run For Your Life&quot;, and duetting with Kenny Loggins on the 1982 No. 17 hit single &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight It&quot;.
In 1984, following the release of &quot;Frontiers&quot; and the tour supporting this effort, Perry released his first solo album, &quot;Street Talk&quot;. The album&#x27;s title was derived from the original name of Perry&#x27;s earlier band Alien Project. The record sold more than 2 million units, scoring the hit singles &quot;Oh Sherrie&quot;, written for his then-girlfriend Sherrie Swafford and which went to No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and &quot;Foolish Heart&quot;, which went to No. 18. The music video for &quot;Oh Sherrie&quot; was on heavy rotation on MTV. The songs &quot;She&#x27;s Mine&quot; and &quot;Strung Out&quot; were also released as singles. The album featured former Alien Project drummer Craig Krampf on a few tracks, guitarist Michael Landau, and future &quot;American Idol&quot; judge Randy Jackson on bass, among others.

In 1985, Perry was one of 21 singers on the USA for Africa all-star benefit song &quot;We Are the World&quot;. He also recorded a song, &quot;If Only For the Moment, Girl&quot; for the &quot;We Are the World&quot; album. This song was added to the reissue of his album &quot;Street Talk&quot;. Also during this period, Perry worked with the Irish folk-rock group Clannad on their 1987 album &quot;Sirius&quot;.

While Perry was reuniting with Journey, his mother became ill. The recording of &quot;Raised on Radio&quot;, which Perry was producing, was stop-and-go as he frequently returned to the San Joaquin Valley to visit his mother, who died during the production of the album. It took a major toll on Journey to have intermittent recording sessions and a vocalist who was not with the band much of the time. Eventually, Perry became exhausted from the ordeal. Journey then went into hiatus in 1987 after the &quot;Raised on Radio&quot; tour.

In 1988, Perry began to work on another solo album, &quot;Against the Wall&quot;, which he ultimately left unfinished, although several of the songs that were recorded for the album would appear on Perry&#x27;s 1998 solo compilation, &quot;Greatest Hits + Five Unreleased&quot;). A year later, on April 30, 1989, at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California, Perry joined Bon Jovi to perform Sam Cooke&#x27;s &quot;Bring It On Home to Me&quot; and the Four Tops&#x27; &quot;Reach Out&quot;. He would also reunite with Journey at the Bill Graham tribute concert, &quot;Laughter, Love and Music&quot; on November 3, 1991, at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, performing &quot;Faithfully&quot; and &quot;Lights&quot;. Other than those three events, however, Perry mostly disappeared from the public eye for seven years, taking a break from the music industry.

In 1994, Perry released &quot;For the Love of Strange Medicine&quot;, his second solo effort. The album was successful, partly due to the Strange Medicine world tour.

Journey&#x27;s classic 1981–85 lineup reunited in 1996 to record &quot;Trial by Fire&quot;. The album was a huge success, entering the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts at No. 3 and going platinum before year&#x27;s end, but its triumph was short-lived. Before the &quot;Trial By Fire&quot; tour could begin, Perry suffered a hip injury while hiking in Hawaii and was unable to perform. Perry was diagnosed with a degenerative bone condition and a hip replacement was required, and as he was reluctant to rush into the surgery, Perry wanted to postpone the tour. The remaining members waited until 1998, nearly 17 months after Perry&#x27;s injury, before making a decision on Journey&#x27;s future. Growing impatient and realizing the window of opportunity was closing to follow up the success of the &quot;Trial By Fire&quot; LP with a world tour, Journey members Jonathan Cain and Neal Schon met with Perry. They presented him with an ultimatum: If he did not undergo hip replacement surgery so the tour could proceed upon his recovery, the band would hire a replacement singer. Still hesitant to undergo surgery, and now upset at his bandmates, Perry announced that he was permanently leaving Journey. His lead vocal duties were later taken over by Steve Augeri of Tall Stories. Nearly two years after the initial release of &quot;Trial by Fire&quot;, Journey began to tour.

Perry released his &quot;Greatest Hits + Five Unreleased&quot; compilation album on December 15, 1998; the unreleased tracks included an original Alien Project demo as well as selections from the abandoned &quot;Against the Wall&quot; album. Also in 1998, Perry recorded two songs for the Warner Bros. film &quot;Quest for Camelot,&quot; which can be found on the motion picture&#x27;s soundtrack. During an episode of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot; in 2001, Perry stated that he &quot;never really felt like [he] was part of the band&quot;. Former manager Herbie Herbert reacted by saying, &quot;That&#x27;s like the Pope saying he never really felt Catholic.&quot;

===21st century===
Perry appeared on two tracks by Kauai, Hawaii, artist Tommy Tokioka&#x27;s album &quot;Happy To Be Living&quot;, singing backup vocals on songs &quot;I Wish You Were Mine&quot; and &quot;An Angel Above Me&quot; in 2000. He collaborated with musician Jeff Golub on a song titled &quot;Can&#x27;t Let You Go&quot; for Golub&#x27;s &quot;Soul Sessions&quot; album, which was released in 2003. Perry provided vocals on the mostly instrumental jazz track.

Perry appeared with other Journey members at a ceremony on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on January 21, 2005, after previously stating it was unlikely that he would ever perform with the band again. He indicated that though it was a good experience, it was unlikely that he would rejoin the band. However, he has also said, &quot;never say never, unless you mean never, nevertheless&quot; when the issue of returning to Journey has been mentioned.

Perry co-produced &quot;A Brand New Start&quot;, a track on a solo album for former Ambrosia lead vocalist David Pack, in 2005. Perry also provided co-vocals and background vocals for the track, among the many songs he and Pack co-wrote shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks. That album, &quot;The Secret of Moving On&quot;, released in September 2005, includes covers of two of Pack&#x27;s biggest hits with Ambrosia, &quot;Biggest Part of Me&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re the Only Woman&quot;.

On October 3, 2006, Perry&#x27;s two solo projects, &quot;Street Talk&quot; and &quot;For the Love of Strange Medicine&quot; (both featuring previously unreleased material), and his &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; CD were remastered and re-released. Sony Legacy released &quot;Playlist: The Very Best of Steve Perry&quot; on January 13, 2009.

At three concerts in 2014, Perry joined the indie rock band Eels during the encore and sang several songs.

On April 7, 2017, Perry appeared alongside his Journey ex-bandmates for the first time since 2005 at the band&#x27;s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Perry gave an acceptance speech, but chose not to perform with the band in deference to current Journey lead singer Arnel Pineda.

Perry released a 10-track studio album, &quot;Traces&quot;, on October 5, 2018. A U.S. Deluxe Edition was released at Target and has five bonus tracks. Perry has described the album as a &quot;cathartic&quot; and &quot;emotional expression&quot; about the loss of a loved one. The record is Perry&#x27;s third studio work and his first since &quot;For the Love of Strange Medicine&quot;.

On December 17, 2018, Perry released a cover of &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot;.

In March 2019, Perry released a deluxe version of the &quot;Traces&quot; album, featuring five bonus tracks along with his first official music video in 25 years for &quot;We&#x27;re Still Here&quot;.

On November 1, 2019, Perry released a three-song holiday EP, &quot;Silver Bells&quot;.

On November 5, 2021, Perry released his first-ever Christmas album, &quot;The Season&quot;, via Fantasy Records.

On January 4, 2023, Perry confirmed that he sang backing vocals on Dolly Parton&#x27;s rock album, &quot;Rockstar&quot;, in addition to singing a duet cover of &quot;Open Arms&quot; on the same album.

On October 18, 2024, Perry announced that he would release a new holiday album, titled &quot;The Season 3&quot;, on November 8, 2024, through Dark Horse Records.

==Style==
===Vocal technique and acclaim===
Perry is renowned for his tenor vocal range, which spans from F2 to A5. Perry&#x27;s voice has been described as a &quot;high &#x27;tenor altino&#x27; [with] a tone somewhere between Sam Cooke and Aretha Franklin.&quot; He has been dubbed &quot;The Voice&quot;, a moniker originally coined by fellow singer Jon Bon Jovi. Queen guitarist Brian May said: &quot;Perry is a truly luminous singer, in my opinion—a voice in a million.&quot; Record executive, producer, and former &quot;American Idol&quot; judge and Journey session musician Randy Jackson has described Perry&#x27;s voice as &quot;the golden voice,&quot; adding that aside from Robert Plant, &quot;there&#x27;s no singer in rock that even came close to Steve Perry. The power, the range, the tone—he created his own style. He mixed a little Motown, a little Everly Brothers, a little Zeppelin.&quot; Journey guitarist Neal Schon likened Perry&#x27;s ability to that of Aretha Franklin, and agreed with Fozzy vocalist Chris Jericho&#x27;s assertion that Perry &quot;might be the greatest male singer of all time&quot;.

Greg Prato of AllMusic wrote: &quot;If only one singer could be selected as the most identifiable with &#x27;80s arena rock, it would have to be Journey&#x27;s Steve Perry.&quot; Prato&#x27;s colleague John Franck praised Perry&#x27;s as a soaring &quot;whale of a voice&quot;. He was voted among the ten greatest rock singers of all time in a 2009 &quot;Classic Rock&quot; reader poll. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Perry No. 76 in &quot;The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;, lauding his &quot;technical skills&quot; as well as his &quot;pure tone and passionate sincerity&quot;. Geoff Nicholls of &quot;Rhythm&quot; referred to Perry as &quot;arguably the best singer of his generation&quot;.

Sam Cooke, to whom Perry has been compared, was Perry&#x27;s primary influence. He has also cited the vocal approach of the Beach Boys, Jackie Wilson, Frankie Valli, Lou Christie, Marvin Gaye, Joe Tex, and Jack Bruce of Cream, along with female singers such as Diana Ross, Dee Dee Sharp and Aretha Franklin. Musically, Perry drew influence from Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry. He also spoke of his fondness for Motown recordings and English bands of the late 1960s.

===Songwriting===
Perry co-wrote most of Journey&#x27;s songs throughout his tenure with the band, as well as in his solo efforts. In 2020, he was nominated for the Songwriters Hall of Fame.
==Personal life==
In the 1980s Perry dated Sherrie Swafford, for whom he wrote the 1984 song &quot;Oh Sherrie&quot;.

In 2011, Perry began a relationship with Kellie Nash, a psychologist and breast cancer survivor. He was by Nash&#x27;s side as she battled a cancer recurrence, and she died in December 2012.

In a September 2018 interview, Perry said, &quot;Things happened to me as a child that I still can&#x27;t talk about – nothing to do with my parents, but things did happen. It happened to a lot of kids, as I find out... there was nowhere to talk it out, so I got to sing it out instead.&quot;

In a 2019 interview with Dan Rather, Perry said that he had a daughter and grandchildren, but declined to go into further details saying, &quot;I do have a child, but in the essence of protecting her, I kinda don&#x27;t want to get into that... and I have grandchildren too.&quot;

=== Health and interests ===
Perry underwent successful hip replacement surgery in 1998.

In May 2013, Perry had a mole removed that turned out to be melanoma. He had two surgeries to remove the cancer cells and was told the surgeries were successful, requiring no further treatment.

During the 2005 baseball season, the Chicago White Sox adopted Journey&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27; as their unofficial team anthem. As a result, Perry, a San Francisco Giants fan, was asked to attend the World Series and traveled with the White Sox to Houston, where he joined the players on the field and in the locker room as they celebrated winning the championship, their first since 1917.

<text>Scream for Me Brazil is a live album by Bruce Dickinson, recorded in São Paulo, Brazil and released in 1999. The actual concert set list consisted of eighteen songs, but six of them were cut out from this release. The songs in question were three Iron Maiden songs; &quot;Powerslave&quot;, &quot;2 Minutes to Midnight&quot; and &quot;Flight of Icarus&quot; as well as three of Dickinson&#x27;s own songs; &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, &quot;Taking the Queen&quot; and &quot;Tattooed Millionaire&quot;. &quot;Jerusalem&quot; from this concert was later released on &quot;The Best of Bruce Dickinson&quot; compilation album in 2001.

==Background==
The album was released when Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith had confirmed their return to Iron Maiden and is considered a valuable conclusion to Dickinson&#x27;s solo career. The first part of the concert consists entirely of songs from the album &quot;The Chemical Wedding&quot; before the inevitable &quot;Tears of the Dragon&quot; heralds a return to some older Dickinson classics. The album does not include songs from &quot;Skunkworks&quot; and &quot;Tattooed Millionaire&quot;.

<text>George Topîrceanu (; March 20, 1886 – May 7, 1937) was a Romanian poet, short story writer, and humourist.

==Biography==
He was born in Bucharest, the son of Ion Topîrceanu, a furrier and his wife, Paraschiva (née Cosma), a carpet weaver. The family lived in the Cotroceni neighborhood. It is said that the origins of the Topîrceanu family are with a family Niștor from the village Topîrcea near Sibiu; there is a family with the name Topîrceanu who claim to be related to the parents of George Topîrceanu, settled in Grădiștea and Periș.

Topîrceanu began his schooling in Bucharest, and then moved to the hilly countryside of Argeș County, in Șuici commune, where he formed his taste for themes taken from nature. After returning to Bucharest, he attended the Matei Basarab High School (1898–1901), and then completed his secondary studies at the Saint Sava High School (1901–1906). Upon graduation, he attended the University of Bucharest Law School, and then its Faculty of Letters, without ever finishing either. This was largely due to a hectic lifestyle, punctuated by numerous affairs and heavy alcohol use.

His debut came in 1905, the year he published his first verses in Sunday papers and minor magazines; in 1909, he managed to have poems featured in major periodicals, such as &quot;Sămănătorul&quot;. He worked in handcopying, and in 1909 made his mark by having his satirical &quot;Răspunsul micilor funcționari&quot; (&quot;A Reply from the Minor Civil Servants&quot;) in &quot;Viața Românească&quot;. In 1911, he moved to Iași, on Garabet Ibrăileanu&#x27;s invitation, and became chief editor at &quot;Viața Românească&quot;. He later wrote his well-received articles – &quot;Cum am devenit moldovean&quot; (&quot;How I Became a Moldavia Native&quot;) and &quot;Cum am devenit ieșean&quot; (&quot;How I Became a Iași Native&quot;) which trace his meanderings within Romania.

In 1912, he married a young schoolteacher, Victoria Iuga. They had one son, Gheorghe. Although the two were very much in love, the marriage soon began to crumble, due to Topîrceanu&#x27;s bouts of womanizing and alcoholism. Unable to redeem himself, George nonetheless suffered enormously, and the gradual distancing from Victoria, whom he will repeatedly refer to as his &quot;one saving grace&quot;, also influenced his literary output.

With the beginning of World War I, Topîrceanu was drafted, then taken prisoner and imprisoned by Bulgarian forces during the Battle of Turtucaia, in September 1916. He was kept in a POW camp until the end of the war, in 1918. After his return, Topîrceanu published several volumes of wartime recollections: &quot;Amintiri din luptele de la Turtucaia&quot; (&quot;Memories from Battle of Turtucaia&quot;, 1918), &quot;În ghiara lor... Amintiri din Bulgaria și schițe ușoare&quot; (&quot;In Their Claw... Memories from Bulgaria and Light Sketches&quot;, 1920), and &quot;Pirin-Planina, epizoduri tragice și comice din captivitate&quot; (&quot;Pirin-Planina, Tragic and Comical Episodes from Captivity&quot;, 1936), which represent, among others, a vivid depiction of the profound effects that the cholera epidemic had on the morale of Romanian troops during their attempted retreat.
He began publishing short verses to increasing critical acclaim. In 1926, he was awarded the National Poetry Prize.

Topîrceanu died in Iași in 1937 of liver cancer, and was buried in the city&#x27;s Eternitatea Cemetery. Streets are named after him in Berceni, Chișinău, Craiova, Hunedoara, Iași, Mediaș, Miroslava, Otopeni, Ploiești, Sibiu, and Suceava. Schools in Bucharest and Mioveni are also named after him.

==Works==

===Poetry===

His three main volumes of poetry, &quot;Balade vesele şi triste&quot; (&quot;Ballads, Merry and Sad&quot;), &quot;Parodii originale&quot; (&quot;Original Parodies&quot;) and &quot;Migdale amare&quot; (&quot;Bitter Almonds&quot;), are a compelling mixture of humor and delicate lyricism. Topîrceanu&#x27;s favorite device is to switch, without warning, from biting sarcasm to genuine sentiment and vice versa, often with beguiling ease. In his own words he aimed to: &quot;through jest, render tears all too clear&quot;.

Topîrceanu&#x27;s most celebrated pieces, such as &quot;Balada unui greier mic&quot; (&quot;The Ballad of a Tiny Cricket&quot;) and &quot;Rapsodii de toamnă&quot; (&quot;Fall Rhapsodies&quot;) can be enjoyed for their flowing verse, on an infantile level, as well as appreciated for carefully constructed metaphors, incisive humor and contemplative ambiance. Other, more muscular and less lyrical pieces such as &quot;Acceleratul&quot; (&quot;The Bullet Train&quot;) and &quot;Cioara&quot; (&quot;The Crow&quot;), display his command of the Romanian language, with cascading similes and emphatic rhythms.

===Prose===
Topîrceanu wrote many satirical pieces, almost all first published as articles. His prose works were collected in several volumes: &quot;Memories from the Battle of Turtucaia&quot; (Bucharest, 1918), &quot;In their claw...&quot; Memories from Bulgaria and Light Sketches (Jassy, 1920), 
&quot;Letters with No Address&quot;, Humorous and Pessimistic Prose (Bucharest, 1930), &quot;Pirin-Planina&quot;, Tragic and Comic Episodes from Captivity (Bucharest, 1936). He also left an unfinished novella, &quot;Minunile Sfântului Sisoe&quot; (&quot;The Wonders of Saint Sisoe&quot;), published posthumously in 1938.

<doc id="1010628" wikidata="Q333324" url="?curid=1010628" title="Method overriding">
<text>Method overriding, in object-oriented programming, is a language feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses or parent classes. In addition to providing data-driven algorithm-determined parameters across virtual network interfaces, it also allows for a specific type of polymorphism (subtyping). The implementation in the subclass overrides (replaces) the implementation in the superclass by providing a method that has same name, same parameters or signature, and same return type as the method in the parent class. The version of a method that is executed will be determined by the object that is used to invoke it. If an object of a parent class is used to invoke the method, then the version in the parent class will be executed, but if an object of the subclass is used to invoke the method, then the version in the child class will be executed. This helps in preventing problems associated with differential relay analytics which would otherwise rely on a framework in which method overriding might be obviated. Some languages allow a programmer to prevent a method from being overridden.

==Language-specific examples==
===Ada===
Ada provides method overriding by default.
To favor early error detection (e.g. a misspelling),
it is possible to specify when a method
is expected to be actually overriding, or not. That will be checked by the compiler.

 type T is new Controlled with ...;
 procedure Op(Obj: in out T; Data: in Integer);

 type NT is new T with null record;
 overriding -- overriding indicator
 procedure Op(Obj: in out NT; Data: in Integer);
 overriding -- overriding indicator
 procedure Op(Obj: in out NT; Data: in String);
 -- ^ compiler issues an error: subprogram &quot;Op&quot; is not overriding
===C#===
C# does support method overriding, but only if explicitly requested using the modifiers and or .


abstract class Animal
 public string Name { get; set; }
 // Methods
 public void Drink();
 public virtual void Eat();
 public void Go();

class Cat : Animal
 public new string Name { get; set; }
 // Methods
 public void Drink(); // Warning: hides inherited drink(). Use new
 public override void Eat(); // Overrides inherited eat().
 public new void Go(); // Hides inherited go().


When overriding one method with another, the signatures of the two methods must be identical (and with same visibility). In C#, class methods, indexers, properties and events can all be overridden.

Non-virtual or static methods cannot be overridden. The overridden base method must be &quot;virtual&quot;, &quot;abstract&quot;, or &quot;override&quot;.

In addition to the modifiers that are used for method overriding, C# allows the hiding of an inherited property or method. This is done using the same signature of a property or method but adding the modifier in front of it.

In the above example, hiding causes the following:
Cat cat = new Cat();

cat.Name = …; // accesses Cat.Name
cat.Eat(); // calls Cat.Eat()
cat.Go(); // calls Cat.Go()
((Animal)cat).Name = …; // accesses Animal.Name!
((Animal)cat).Eat(); // calls Cat.Eat()!
((Animal)cat).Go(); // calls Animal.Go()!
===C++===

C++ does not have the keyword that a subclass can use in Java to invoke the superclass version of a method that it wants to override. Instead, the name of the parent or base class is used followed by the scope resolution operator. For example, the following code presents two classes, the base class , and the derived class . overrides the class&#x27;s method, so as also to print its height.
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
class Rectangle {
 public:
 Rectangle(double l, double w) : length_(l), width_(w) {}
 virtual void Print() const;

 private:
 double length_;
 double width_;

void Rectangle::Print() const {
 // Print method of base class.
 std::cout « &quot;Length = &quot; « length_ « &quot;; Width = &quot; « width_;

class Box : public Rectangle {
 public:
 Box(double l, double w, double h) : Rectangle(l, w), height_(h) {}
 void Print() const override;

 private:
 double height_;

// Print method of derived class.
void Box::Print() const {
 // Invoke parent Print method.
 Rectangle::Print();
 std::cout « &quot;; Height = &quot; « height_;


The method in class , by invoking the parent version of method , is also able to output the private variables and of the base class. Otherwise, these variables are inaccessible to .

The following statements will instantiate objects of type and , and call their respective methods:
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
 Rectangle rectangle(5.0, 3.0);

 // Outputs: Length = 5.0; Width = 3.0
 rectangle.Print();

 Box box(6.0, 5.0, 4.0);

 // The pointer to the most overridden method in the vtable in on Box::print,
 // but this call does not illustrate overriding.

In C++11, similar to Java, a method that is declared codice_1 in the super class cannot be overridden; also, a method can be declared codice_2 to make the compiler check that it overrides a method in the base class.

===Delphi===
In Delphi, method overriding is done with the directive override, but only if a method was marked with the dynamic or virtual directives.

The inherited reserved word must be called when you want to call super-class behavior
type
 TRectangle = class
 private
 FLength: Double;
 FWidth: Double;
 public
 property Length read FLength write FLength;
 property Width read FWidth write FWidth;

 procedure Print; virtual;
 end;

 TBox = class(TRectangle)
 public
 procedure Print; override;
 end;
===Eiffel===

In Eiffel, feature redefinition is analogous to method overriding in C++ and Java. Redefinition is one of three forms of feature adaptation classified as redeclaration. Redeclaration also covers effecting, in which an implementation is provided for a feature which was deferred (abstract) in the parent class, and undefinition, in which a feature that was effective (concrete) in the parent becomes deferred again in the heir class. When a feature is redefined, the feature name is kept by the heir class, but properties of the feature such as its signature, contract (respecting restrictions for preconditions and postconditions), and/or implementation will be different in the heir. If the original feature in the parent class, called the heir feature&#x27;s precursor, is effective, then the redefined feature in the heir will be effective. If the precursor is deferred, the feature in the heir will be deferred.

The intent to redefine a feature, as in the example below, must be explicitly declared in the clause of the heir class.
class
 THOUGHT
feature
 message
 -- Display thought message
 do
 print (&quot;I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe.%N&quot;)
 end
end

class
 ADVICE
inherit
 THOUGHT
 redefine
 message
 end
feature
 message
 -- Precursor
 do
 print (&quot;Warning: Dates in calendar are closer than they appear.%N&quot;)
 end
end
In class the feature is given an implementation that differs from that of its precursor in class .

Consider a class which uses instances for both and :
class
 APPLICATION
create
 make
feature 
 make
 -- Run application.
 do
 (create {THOUGHT}).message;
 (create {ADVICE}).message
 end
end
When instantiated, class produces the following output:
I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe.
Warning: Dates in calendar are closer than they appear.
Within a redefined feature, access to the feature&#x27;s precursor can be gained by using the language keyword . Assume the implementation of is altered as follows:
 message
 -- Precursor
 do
 print (&quot;Warning: Dates in calendar are closer than they appear.%N&quot;)
 Precursor
 end
Invocation of the feature now includes the execution of , and produces the following output:
Warning: Dates in calendar are closer than they appear.
I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe.
===Java===
In Java, when a subclass contains a method with the same signature (name and parameter types) as a method in its superclass, then the subclass&#x27;s method overrides that of the superclass. 
For example:
class Thought {
 public void message() {
 System.out.println(&quot;I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe.&quot;);
}

public class Advice extends Thought {
 @Override // @Override annotation in Java 5 is optional but helpful.
 public void message() {
 System.out.println(&quot;Warning: Dates in calendar are closer than they appear.&quot;);
}
Class represents the superclass and implements a method call . The subclass called inherits every method that could be in the class. Class overrides the method , replacing its functionality from .
Thought parking = new Thought();
parking.message(); // Prints &quot;I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe.&quot;

Thought dates = new Advice(); // Polymorphism
dates.message(); // Prints &quot;Warning: Dates in calendar are closer than they appear.&quot;
When a subclass contains a method that overrides a method of the superclass, then that (superclass&#x27;s) overridden method can be explicitly invoked from within a subclass&#x27;s method by using the keyword . (It cannot be explicitly invoked from any method belongings to a class that is unrelated to the superclass.) 
The reference can be 
public class Advice extends Thought {
 @Override
 public void message() {
 System.out.println(&quot;Warning: Dates in calendar are closer than they appear.&quot;);
 super.message(); // Invoke parent&#x27;s version of method.


There are methods that a subclass cannot override. For example, in Java, a method that is declared final in the super class cannot be overridden. Methods that are declared private or static cannot be overridden either because they are implicitly final. It is also impossible for a class that is declared final to become a super class.

=== Kotlin ===
In Kotlin we can simply override a function like this (note that the function must be ):
fun main() {
 val p = Parent(5)
 val c = Child(6)
 p.myFun()
 c.myFun()

open class Parent(val a : Int) {
 open fun myFun() = println(a)

class Child(val b : Int) : Parent(b) {
 override fun myFun() = println(&quot;overrided method&quot;)


===Python===
In Python, when a subclass contains a method that overrides a method of the superclass, you can also call the superclass method by calling instead of . 
Example:
class Thought:
 def __init__(self) -&gt; None:
 print(&quot;I&#x27;m a new object of type Thought!&quot;)
 def message(self) -&gt; None:
 print(&quot;I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe.&quot;)

class Advice(Thought):
 def __init__(self) -&gt; None:
 super(Advice, self).__init__()
 def message(self) -&gt; None:
 print(&quot;Warning: Dates in calendar are closer than they appear&quot;)
 super(Advice, self).message()

t = Thought()
# &quot;I&#x27;m a new object of type Thought!&quot;
t.message()
# &quot;I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe.

a = Advice()
# &quot;I&#x27;m a new object of type Thought!&quot;
a.message()
# &quot;Warning: Dates in calendar are closer than they appear&quot;
# &quot;I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe.
# Introspection:

isinstance(t, Thought)
# True

isinstance(a, Advice)
# True

isinstance(a, Thought)
# True
===Ruby===
In Ruby when a subclass contains a method that overrides a method of the superclass, you can also call the superclass method by calling super in that overridden method. You can use alias if you would like to keep the overridden method available outside of the overriding method as shown with &#x27;super_message&#x27; below.

Example:
class Thought
 def message
 puts &quot;I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe.&quot;
 end
end

class Advice &lt; Thought
 alias :super_message :message
 def message
 puts &quot;Warning: Dates in calendar are closer than they appear&quot;
 super
 end
end

<text>is a 26-episode anime television series. The main character is a 15-year-old English girl named Jane Buxton, who dreams of building a flying machine due to the influence of her brother. The series documents her journey through the Near East to find her brother, who went missing after headed to the Near East to look for a floating liquid in an expedition. It is set in the late 19th century where impossible technologies such as landships and &quot;floating liquid&quot; exist side by side in a steampunk world.

The series is loosely based on two works by Jules Verne—his posthumous 1919 novel &quot;The Barsac Mission&quot;, which was largely written by his son Michel Verne (&quot;L’Étonnante Aventure de la mission Barsac&quot;, published in English in two volumes—&quot;Into the Niger Bend (Book One of the Barsac Mission)&quot;, and &quot;City in the Sahara (Book Two of the Barsac Mission)&quot;) as well as his 1896 novel &quot;Facing the Flag&quot; (&quot;Face au drapeau&quot;).

It was included in Jury selections in the 2002 Japan Media Arts Festival for the animation division.

==Characters==
: 
: The Main protagonist of the series, Jane is the little sister of George and stepsister of William.
: 
: The big brother of Jane and stepbrother of William.
: 
: The main antagonist of the series and stepbrother of Jane and George. He was eleven years old when his mother Marguerite married into the Buxton Family, but William did not like the new environment, step family and depened on his mother. After his mother died of an illness, he felt more lonely, when Jane showed him kindness and calling his mother as her own, William begins to love Jane as his own and felt no longer alone.

<text>Shelf Bank is a hill in the centre of Oswestry which has been a local nature reserve since 2014. It has an elevation of and is a area consisting of acid grassland and naturally regenerated areas of woodland and scrub.

==Location and surroundings==
The site occupies the majority of a knoll which offers views across Oswestry town and the wider Shropshire countryside. For that reason during World War II anti-aircraft guns and lookout posts were established on the summit. Along the southern edge of the site there can be found a section of Wat&#x27;s Dyke, an earth bank structure dating back to the Dark Ages. On the North side, it was surrounded by a vast desolate area of old railway sidings of the Cambrian Railways&#x27; Oswestry Branch Line (closed many years ago) and a huge Victorian engineering works, that has now been converted into a new Health Centre. On the rare occasions when snow falls in the town, it provides the local populace with superb sledging opportunities.

==Recent history==
Local legend had it that the land was donated to &quot;the children of Oswestry&quot; by a long-forgotten landlord and as a result of its disputed ownership has proved very difficult to redevelop, despite occupying valuable land just outside the town centre.

The site was compulsorily purchased in 2005 by Oswestry Borough Council to ensure it could be managed for wildlife and the quiet recreation of Oswestry residents and visitors alike. Shelf Bank was not left to the children of Oswestry, it was only through the intervention of Shropshire County Council staff that the previous owner of the site was finally found and the land purchased for the people of Oswestry.

Shelf Bank is now managed by Shropshire Council who succeeded in having it designated a Local nature Reserve in May 2014. A local group, &#x27;The Friends of Shelf Bank&#x27; has also been founded and a management plan implemented ensuring this jewel of Oswestry&#x27;s Green Network is enjoyed for its flourishing biodiversity, its heritage and views for generations to come.

<doc id="1010655" wikidata="Q822679" url="?curid=1010655" title="Garoowe">
<text>Garowe (, , ) is the capital city of Puntland located in northeastern Somalia. It serves as the administrative center of the Nugal region and is known for its strategic importance. The city has experienced growth and development, hosting government institutions and providing essential services to its residents. Garowe is situated in a territory with a semi-arid climate, and its economy is influenced by trade, livestock, and agriculture.

==Overview==
Garowe is situated in the Nugaal Valley, bounded by gradually ascending high plateaus that generally reach elevations of above sea level on the north, west, and south. The western part of the same plateau is crossed by numerous valleys and dry watercourses. Raising livestock forms the basis of the economy, and frankincense and myrrh are collected from the wild trees.

==History==

During the 19th century, Garowe and much of northeastern Somalia were an integral part of the Majeerteen Sultanate, ruled by Boqor Osman Mahamud, and Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid of the Sultanate of Hobyo.

The city would later be incorporated into Italian Somaliland during the colonial period.

Following independence, Garowe was made a district center of Nugaal. The city would subsequently be reassigned in the early 1970s as the regional capital of an area consisting of Las Anod and Eyl. Straddling the Nugal Valley, this new administrative division would be named Nugal.

Following the outbreak of the civil war in 1991, a homegrown constitutional conference was held in Garowe in 1998 over a period of three months. Attended by the area&#x27;s political elite, traditional elders (&quot;Issims&quot;), members of the business community, intellectuals and other civil society representatives, the autonomous Puntland State of Somalia was subsequently officially established so as to deliver services to the population, offer security, facilitate trade, and interact with both domestic and international partners.

==Geography==

===Location===
Garowe is situated in northeastern Somalia, in the heart of the Puntland region. Nearby settlements include to the east Gillab (4.8 nm), to the northeast Qalqalooc (15.3 nm), to the north Libaax Seexay (2.5 nm), to the northwest Geida Debabo (12.2), to the west Bixin (5.9 nm), to the southwest Lugo (6.0 nm), to the south Salaxley (5.3 nm), and to the southeast War Weytan (9.7 nm). The largest cities most proximate to Garowe are Qardho (205 km), Galkayo (216 km) and Erigavo (275 km).

===Climate===
Garowe has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;). As such, the weather is generally hot, sunny and dry. Coldest average temperatures occur during the months of November to February, when thermometer readings range from . The weather slowly heats up in the spring, as the April rainy season begins. Average temperatures later reach a maximum of around over the summer period. Come September, a gradual moderation starts to set in again. Annual rainfall is low, averaging . The sky is usually clear and bright throughout the year.


==Administration==

Garowe is the third largest city in Puntland after Bosaso and Galkayo. Situated in the Nugal province in the geographical center of the region, it is the seat of the regional parliament, the presidential palace and government ministries’ headquarters. 

Garowe&#x27;s municipal government is currently led by Ahmed Said Musse (Ahmedbarre). He was elected by city councilors on August 29, 2018 

On November 19, 2012, a ceremony was held in one of Garowe&#x27;s government districts to mark the opening of the new local Corrections Academy and Headquarters. The event was inaugurated by former Puntland President Abdirahman Mohamud Farole and Vice President Abdisamad Ali Shire, along with a UNODC delegation. A multi-tiered security complex, the compound features classrooms, staff quarters and offices. A new bureau for the Puntland Ministry of Justice and Rehabilitation was also opened. Additionally, the officials laid down the foundation for a new prison facility that is being constructed in the city. They later did the same in January 2013 for a new Ministry of Civil Aviation and Airports office. The area also features the Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Health buildings, as well as the Puntland State House. A new presidential palace was likewise opened on April 16, 2013.

On 8 January 2014, the Puntland presidential elections were held in the city, with former Prime Minister of Somalia Abdiweli Mohamed Ali voted into office.

In February 2015, the Garowe Municipality also launched a new house numbering system in the administrative capital. The initiative saw unique numerical digits assigned to each residential and commercial street address, as well as to land plots. Additionally, the Garowe Municipality launched a citywide cleaning campaign in March 2015. The government-public partnership is aimed at beautifying and sanitizing the Horsed suburb and other areas in the Puntland regional state&#x27;s administrative capital. Among other activities, the campaign saw residents construct gabions and fill gullies in some areas of the city.

==Demographics==
The broader Garowe District has an estimated total population of 190,000 residents. The city of Garowe is inhabited by Somalis from the Darod clan, especially, the Majerteen, Leelkase, Dhulbahante, Mehri and Awrtable with a population of Madhibaan living in the city as well. The city also hosts huge number of internally dispalced persons (IDPs). 

==Education==

Garowe has a number of academic institutions and facilities. According to the Puntland Ministry of Education, there are 30 primary schools in the Garowe District. Among these are Al Xikma, Mayle, Wabari and Darwiish, named after Diiriye Guure&#x27;s Dervish State. Secondary schools in the area include Alwaha, Gambol, Nawawi and Nugal High.

Puntland State University&#x27;s main campus is also located here. The school grew out of the Garowe School of Management, a women&#x27;s college in Garowe offering courses in business management, accounting, computer skills and business English. Following the graduation of 60 pupils in its inaugural year, the school was expanded to observe a two-year structure and renamed the Puntland Community College (PCC). In 2004, the PCC again expanded its syllabus, this time offering four-year programs; it was also renamed to Puntland State University (PSU).

Other institutions of higher learning in the city include the Garowe Teachers Education College (GTEC), a primary teachers&#x27; training center that caters to the larger region. East Africa University (EAU) also has a Garowe branch, one of its seven campuses in Puntland.

==Services==

A number of NGOs also have their main offices in the city, including the local Puntland Development Research Center (PDRC). The PDRC plays a key role in research and funding for the development of peace and effective governance initiatives in Puntland.

Additionally, the Puntland Agency For Social Welfare (PASWE) is headquartered here. Founded in May 2009 by the regional administration, it provides medical, educational and counseling support to vulnerable groups and individuals such as orphans, the disabled and the blind. PASWE is overseen by a board of directors, which consists of religious scholars (&quot;ulema&quot;), businesspeople, intellectuals and traditional elders.

Garowe is served by one major medical institution, Garowe Regional Hospital, in addition to numerous smaller health clinics. In 2008, the foundations were laid for the construction of a new general hospital, built with assistance from the Somali Manhal agency. Additionally, in conjunction with the Italian government, the Puntland authorities opened another hospital in the city. In 2009, a local non-profit organization also established the region&#x27;s first mental health facility.

In June 2014, the Puntland government launched a new tree-planting campaign in the state, with the regional Ministry of Environment, Wildlife and Tourism slated to plant 25,000 trees by the end of the year. Garowe is among the seven cities and towns earmarked for the reforestation initiative, which also include Bosaso, Dhahar, Qardho, Buuhoodle, Baran and Galkayo. The campaign is part of a broader partnership between the Puntland authorities and EU to set up various environmental protection measures in the region, with the aim of promoting reforestation and afforestation.

In April 2015, the Takaful Insurance Company officially launched a new office in Garowe. The firm provides Sharia compliant insurance for real estate properties and vehicles.

==Economy==

In April 2013, the Puntland Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources officially inaugurated a new fish market in Garowe. Constructed in conjunction with the UK authorities and the UNDP, it is part of a larger regional development plan which will see two other similar marketplaces launched within the year in Galkayo and Qardho.

In March 2014, the Puntland Chamber of Commerce oversaw a launching event in Garowe for the construction of a new Iftin Bank. The function was attended by Somali business community officials and tycoons, whom the Chamber of Commerce Chairman Saed Hussein Eid encouraged to invest within the region. Highlighting Puntland&#x27;s commercial potential, its natural resources and large reserves, the regional Minister of Commerce also expressed support for entrepreneurs with investments earmarked for the petroleum, livestock and agriculture sectors.

In October 2014, the firm Tawakal Money Express (Tawakal) also began construction of the four-storey Tawakal Plaza Garowe. The new high rise is slated to be completed by the end of 2015 and will feature a Tawakal Global Bank customer and financial services center, office spaces, multi-purpose rooms, and an upscale shopping mall.

In March 2015, the Ministry of Labour, Youth and Sports in conjunction with the European Union and World Vision launched the Nugal Empowerment for Better Livelihood Project in the Garowe, Dangorayo, Eyl, Godobjiran and Burtinle districts of Puntland. The three-year initiative is valued at $3 million EUR and is part of the New Deal Compact for Somalia. It aims buttress the regional economic sector through business support, training and non-formal education programs, community awareness workshops, and mentoring and networking drives.

==Transportation==
Garowe is traversed by a 750 km north–south highway. It connects major cities in the northern part of the country, such as Bosaso and Galkayo, with towns in the south. In 2012, the Puntland Highway Authority (PHA) completed rehabilitation work on the central artery linking Garowe with Galkayo. The transportation body also began an upgrade and repair project in June 2012 on the large Garowe–Bosaso Highway. Additionally, plans are in the works to construct new roads connecting littoral towns in the region to the main thoroughfare.

In October 2014, Puntland President Abdiweli Mohamed Ali laid down the foundation for a new highway connecting the presidential palace in Garowe with various other parts of the administrative capital. Financing for the project was provided by the Puntland government. According to the Head of the Puntland Highway Authority Mohamud Abdinur Adan, the new thoroughfare aims to facilitate local transportation and movement. Puntland Minister of Public Works Mohamed Hersi also indicated that the Puntland authorities plan to build and repair other roads linking to the regional urban centers. In March 2015, Puntland President Ali inaugurated additional newly built, paved roads in Garowe. The streets were constructed by a local company through the JPLG program. Puntland President Ali also inaugurated another new two-kilometer asphalt road in Garowe, a construction project that was implemented by the municipal authorities. According to the Nugal province Governor Abdullahi Aw-Isse, the highway links the city&#x27;s eastern neighborhoods with the downtown area and aims to buttress the ongoing local infrastructure and commercial development initiatives. It is the eighth bitumen road completed in the town since 2014, with the Garowe municipality aiming to convert to asphalt all of the city&#x27;s streets.

In March 2015, Ali in conjunction with EU Ambassador to Somalia Michele Cervone d’Urso and German Ambassador to Somalia Andreas Peschke also launched the Sustainable Road Maintenance Project. Part of the New Deal Compact for Somalia, the initiative&#x27;s implementation is facilitated by 17.75 million Euros and 3 million Euros provided by the EU and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), respectively. Among other objectives, the project aims to renovate the highway between Garowe and Galkayo, including funding refurbishments on the damaged segments of the road and construction of check dams and flood control structures. The initiative also involves a routine annual maintenance program, which focuses on side brushing, clearing bridges after floods, drainage and culvert clearance, and pothole filling. Additionally, the project will offer policy support to the Puntland Ministry of Public Works and the Puntland Highway Authority, and local contractors will receive on-the-job training to upgrade their skills.

Local air transport needs are served by Garowe International Airport, a major airport situated about 12 km from the city center. It was officially opened in 2010 under the aegis of the Ministry for Civil Aviation and Airports. The first phase of the airport&#x27;s construction was completed through a public-private partnership over a period of seven years, with the Garowe-based Mubarak construction company having assisted significantly in completing the project. The airport also attempts to adhere to the air transport standards established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

In March 2015, a business meeting was held in Dubai to evaluate tenders from various firms that are bidding for a contract to build a new airport in Garowe. The construction project was organized by the Puntland aviation and finance ministries, with the Kuwait Fund providing assistance. Four companies were reportedly awarded the contract, with the tender winner(s) scheduled to be officially announced in April of the year.

==Sports==
Mire Aware Stadium is sporting facility with a crowd capacity of over 15,000 spectators. In 2010, hosted the Somali National Football Tournament, the first nationwide football competition held since 1987 and the ensuing outbreak of the civil war. Organized by the Puntland administration in conjunction with the Somali Football Federation, the tournament also marked the first time that the event was held outside of Mogadishu.

==Media==
Various media organizations are based in Garowe. Puntland TV and Radio has offices in the city.

Radio Garowe, the sister outlet to Garowe Online, is also centered here. In May 2013, the broadcaster launched an additional FM station in Bosaso. Radio Daljir, Puntland&#x27;s largest radio station, also has a studio in Garowe, with its main headquarters in Bosaso. The broadcaster&#x27;s network of 7 FM transmitters reaches most of Puntland as well as part of the neighboring Galmudug region to the south.

==Accommodation==

Additionally, Garowe has various places of accommodation. Among these hotels and guest houses is the Meka Hotel, situated downtown.

==Districts==
Garowe is subdivided into several administrative areas:
*1da August
*Hantiwadaag
*Hilaac
*Hodan
*Horseed
*Israac
*Waaberi

<text>|}















The Yorkshire Cup is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged four years or older. It is run over a distance of 1 mile, 5 furlongs and 188 yards () at York in May.

==History==
Formerly a weight-for-age race, the event was revived as a handicap in 1927. It was originally contested over 2 miles. The first running was won by Templestowe.

The Yorkshire Cup was abandoned from 1940 to 1944. A substitute called the Yorkshire Autumn Cup, for horses aged three or older, was staged in 1945.

The event became a conditions race after the war. It temporarily reverted to a handicap in 1951. That year&#x27;s edition was titled the Yorkshire Stayers&#x27; Handicap. Its previous format was restored in 1952.

The race continued with its original distance until 1965. It was cut to 1¾ miles in 1966. It was given Group 2 status in 1971.

The Yorkshire Cup became part of the British Champions Series in 2011. It is now the first race in the long-distance division, which concludes with the British Champions Long Distance Cup in October.

The race is currently held on the final day of York&#x27;s three-day Dante Festival meeting. It is run the day after the Dante Stakes.

<doc id="1010669" wikidata="Q5300017" url="?curid=1010669" title="Double dispatch">
<text>In software engineering, double dispatch is a special form of multiple dispatch, and a mechanism that dispatches a function call to different concrete functions depending on the runtime types of two objects involved in the call. In most object-oriented systems, the concrete function that is called from a function call in the code depends on the dynamic type of a single object and therefore they are known as single dispatch calls, or simply virtual function calls.

Dan Ingalls first described how to use double dispatching in Smalltalk, calling it multiple polymorphism.

==Overview==
The general problem addressed is how to dispatch a message to different methods depending not only on the receiver but also on the arguments.

To that end, systems like CLOS implement multiple dispatch. Double dispatch is another solution that gradually reduces the polymorphism on systems that do not support multiple dispatch.

==Use cases==
Double dispatch is useful in situations where the choice of computation depends on the runtime types of its arguments. For example, a programmer could use double dispatch in the following situations:
* &quot;Sorting a mixed set of objects:&quot; algorithms require that a list of objects be sorted into some canonical order. Deciding if one element comes before another element requires knowledge of both types and possibly some subset of the fields.
* &quot;Adaptive collision algorithms&quot; usually require that collisions between different objects be handled in different ways. A typical example is in a game environment where the collision between a spaceship and an asteroid is computed differently from the collision between a spaceship and a spacestation.
* &quot;Painting algorithms&quot; that require the intersection points of overlapping sprites to be rendered in a different manner.
* &quot;Personnel management&quot; systems may &quot;dispatch&quot; different types of jobs to different personnel. A codice_1 algorithm that is given a person object typed as an accountant and a job object typed as engineering rejects the scheduling of that person for that job.
* &quot;Event handling&quot; systems that use both the event type and the type of the receptor object in order to call the correct event handling routine.
* &quot;Lock and key&quot; systems where there are many types of locks and many types of keys and every type of key opens multiple types of locks. Not only do you need to know the types of the objects involved, but the subset of &quot;information about a particular key that are relevant to seeing if a particular key opens a particular lock&quot; is different between different lock types.

==A common idiom==
The common idiom, as in the examples presented above, is that the selection of the appropriate algorithm is based on the call&#x27;s argument types at runtime. The call is therefore subject to all the usual additional performance costs that are associated with dynamic resolution of calls, usually more than in a language supporting only single method dispatch. In C++, for example, a dynamic function call is usually resolved by a &quot;single&quot; offset calculation - which is possible because the compiler knows the location of the function in the object&#x27;s method table and so can statically calculate the offset. In a language supporting &quot;double&quot; dispatch, this is slightly more costly, because the compiler must generate code to calculate the method&#x27;s offset in the method table at runtime, thereby increasing the overall instruction path length (by an amount that is likely to be no more than the total number of calls to the function, which may not be very significant).

==Example in Ruby==
A common use case is displaying an object on a display port which can be a screen or a printer, or something else entirely that doesn&#x27;t exist yet. This is a naive implementation of how to deal with those different media.
class Rectangle
 def display_on(port)
 # selects the right code based on the object class
 case port
 when DisplayPort
 # code for displaying on DisplayPort
 when PrinterPort
 # code for displaying on PrinterPort
 when RemotePort
 # code for displaying on RemotePort
 end
 end
end
The same would need to be written for Oval, Triangle and any other object that wants to display itself on a medium, and all would need to be rewritten if a new type of port were to be created. The problem is that more than one degree of polymorphism exist: one for dispatching the display_on method to an object and another for selecting the right code (or method) for displaying.

A much cleaner and more maintainable solution is then to do a second dispatch, this time for selecting the right method for displaying the object on the medium:
class Rectangle

==Double dispatch in C++==
At first glance, double dispatch appears to be a natural result of function overloading. Function overloading allows the function called to depend on the type of the argument. Function overloading, however, is done at compile time using &quot;name mangling&quot; where the internal name of the function encodes the argument&#x27;s type. For example, a function codice_2 may internally be called &#x27; and the function codice_3 may be called &#x27;. Thus, there is no name collision, and no virtual table lookup. By contrast, dynamic dispatch is based on the type of the calling object, meaning it uses virtual functions (overriding) instead of function overloading, and does result in a vtable lookup. Consider the following example, written in C++, of collisions in a game:

class SpaceShip {};
class ApolloSpacecraft : public SpaceShip {};

class Asteroid {
public:
 virtual void CollideWith(SpaceShip&amp;) {
 std::cout « &quot;Asteroid hit a SpaceShip\n&quot;;
 virtual void CollideWith(ApolloSpacecraft&amp;) {
 std::cout « &quot;Asteroid hit an ApolloSpacecraft\n&quot;;
};

class ExplodingAsteroid : public Asteroid {
public:
 void CollideWith(SpaceShip&amp;) override {
 std::cout « &quot;ExplodingAsteroid hit a SpaceShip\n&quot;;
 void CollideWith(ApolloSpacecraft&amp;) override {
 std::cout « &quot;ExplodingAsteroid hit an ApolloSpacecraft\n&quot;;
};

If you have:

Asteroid theAsteroid;
SpaceShip theSpaceShip;
ApolloSpacecraft theApolloSpacecraft;

then, because of function overloading,

theAsteroid.CollideWith(theSpaceShip); 
theAsteroid.CollideWith(theApolloSpacecraft); 

will print, respectively, codice_4 and codice_5, without using any dynamic dispatch. Furthermore:

ExplodingAsteroid theExplodingAsteroid;
theExplodingAsteroid.CollideWith(theSpaceShip); 
theExplodingAsteroid.CollideWith(theApolloSpacecraft);
will print codice_6 and codice_7 respectively, again without dynamic dispatch.

With a reference to an codice_8, dynamic dispatch is used, and this code:

Asteroid&amp; theAsteroidReference = theExplodingAsteroid;
theAsteroidReference.CollideWith(theSpaceShip); 
theAsteroidReference.CollideWith(theApolloSpacecraft);

prints codice_6 and codice_7, again as expected. However, the following code does not work as desired:

SpaceShip&amp; theSpaceShipReference = theApolloSpacecraft;
theAsteroid.CollideWith(theSpaceShipReference);
theAsteroidReference.CollideWith(theSpaceShipReference);

The desired behaviour is to bind these calls to the function that takes codice_11 as its argument, as that is the instantiated type of the variable, meaning the expected output would be codice_5 and codice_7. However, the output is actually codice_4 and codice_6. The problem is that, while virtual functions are dispatched dynamically in C++, function overloading is done statically.

The problem described above can be resolved by simulating double dispatch, for example by using a visitor pattern. Suppose the existing code is extended so that both codice_16 and codice_17 are given the function

virtual void CollideWith(Asteroid&amp; inAsteroid) {
 inAsteroid.CollideWith(*this);

Then, while the previous example still does not work correctly, reframing the calls so that the spaceship is the agent gives us the desired behaviour:

SpaceShip&amp; theSpaceShipReference = theApolloSpacecraft;
Asteroid&amp; theAsteroidReference = theExplodingAsteroid;
theSpaceShipReference.CollideWith(theAsteroid);
theSpaceShipReference.CollideWith(theAsteroidReference);

It prints out codice_5 and codice_7, as expected. The key is that codice_20 does the following at run time:
# codice_21 is a reference, so C++ looks up the correct method in the vtable. In this case, it will call codice_22.
# Within codice_22, codice_24 is a reference, so codice_25 will result in &quot;another vtable lookup&quot;. In this case, codice_24 is a reference to an codice_27 so codice_28 will be called.

==Double dispatch in C#==
In C#, when calling an instance method accepting an argument, multiple dispatch can be achieved without employing the visitor pattern. This is done by using traditional polymorphism while also casting the argument to &quot;dynamic&quot;. The run-time binder will choose the appropriate method overload at run-time. This decision will take into consideration the run-time type of the object instance (polymorphism) as well as the run-time type of the argument.

== Double dispatch in Eiffel ==
The Eiffel programming language can bring the concept of agents to bear on the double-dispatch problem. The example below applies the agent language construct to the double-dispatch problem.

Consider a problem domain with various forms of SHAPE and of drawing SURFACE upon which to draw a SHAPE. Both SHAPE and SURFACE know about a function called `draw&#x27; in themselves, but not in each other. We want objects of the two types to co-variantly interact with each other in a double-dispatch using a visitor pattern.

The challenge is to get a polymorphic SURFACE to draw a polymorphic SHAPE on itself.

=== Output ===
The output example below shows the results of two SURFACE visitor objects being polymorphically passed over a list of polymorphic SHAPE objects. The visitor code pattern is only aware of SHAPE and SURFACE generically and not of the specific type of either. Instead, the code relies on run-time polymorphism and the mechanics of agents to achieve a highly flexible co-variant relationship between these two deferred classes and their descendants.

 draw a POLYGON on ETCHASKETCH
 draw a POLYGON on GRAFFITI_WALL
 draw a RECTANGLE on ETCHASKETCH
 draw a RECTANGLE on GRAFFITI_WALL
 draw a QUADRILATERAL on ETCHASKETCH
 draw a QUADRILATERAL on GRAFFITI_WALL
 draw a PARALLELOGRAM on ETCHASKETCH
 draw a PARALLELOGRAM on GRAFFITI_WALL
 draw a POLYGON on ETCHASKETCH
 draw a POLYGON on GRAFFITI_WALL
 draw a RECTANGLE on ETCHASKETCH
 draw a RECTANGLE on GRAFFITI_WALL

=== Setup ===
Before looking at SHAPE or SURFACE, we need to examine the high level decoupled use of our double-dispatch.

==== Visitor pattern ====
The visitor pattern works by way of a visitor object visiting the elements of a data structure (e.g. list, tree and so on) polymorphically, applying some action (call or agent) against the polymorphic element objects in the visited target structure.

In our example below, we make a list of polymorphic SHAPE objects, visiting each of them with a polymorphic SURFACE, asking the SHAPE to be drawn on the SURFACE.
 make
 -- Print shapes on surfaces.
 local
 l_shapes: ARRAYED_LIST [SHAPE]
 l_surfaces: ARRAYED_LIST [SURFACE]
 do
 create l_shapes.make (6)
 l_shapes.extend (create {POLYGON}.make_with_color (&quot;red&quot;))
 l_shapes.extend (create {RECTANGLE}.make_with_color (&quot;grey&quot;))
 l_shapes.extend (create {QUADRILATERAL}.make_with_color (&quot;green&quot;))
 l_shapes.extend (create {PARALLELOGRAM}.make_with_color (&quot;blue&quot;))
 l_shapes.extend (create {POLYGON}.make_with_color (&quot;yellow&quot;))
 l_shapes.extend (create {RECTANGLE}.make_with_color (&quot;purple&quot;))

 create l_surfaces.make (2)
 l_surfaces.extend (create {ETCHASKETCH}.make)
 l_surfaces.extend (create {GRAFFITI_WALL}.make)

 across l_shapes as ic_shapes loop
 across l_surfaces as ic_surfaces loop
 ic_surfaces.item.drawing_agent (ic_shapes.item.drawing_data_agent)
 end
 end
 end

We start by creating a collection of SHAPE and SURFACE objects. We then iterate over one of the lists (SHAPE), allowing elements of the other (SURFACE) to visit each of them in turn. In the example code above, SURFACE objects are visiting SHAPE objects.

The code makes a polymorphic call on {SURFACE}.draw indirectly by way of the `drawing_agent&#x27;, which is the first call (dispatch) of the double-dispatch pattern. It passes an indirect and polymorphic agent (`drawing_data_agent&#x27;), allowing our visitor code to only know about two things:

* What is the drawing agent of the surface (e.g. al_surface.drawing_agent on line #21)?
* What is the drawing data agent of the shape (e.g. al_shape.drawing_data_agent on line #21)?

Because both SURFACE and SHAPE define their own agents, our visitor code is freed from having to know what is the appropriate call to make, polymorphically or otherwise. This level of indirection and decoupling is simply not achievable in other common languages like C, C++ and Java except through either some form of reflection or feature overloading with signature matching.

==== SURFACE ====
Within the polymorphic call to {SURFACE}.draw is the call to an agent, which becomes the second polymorphic call or dispatch in the double-dispatch pattern.
 deferred class
 SURFACE
 feature {NONE} -- Initialization
 make
 -- Initialize Current.
 do
 drawing_agent := agent draw
 end
 feature -- Access

 drawing_agent: PROCEDURE [ANY, TUPLE [STRING, STRING]]
 -- Drawing agent of Current.
 feature {NONE} -- Implementation
 draw (a_data_agent: FUNCTION [ANY, TUPLE, TUPLE [name, color: STRING]])
 -- Draw `a_shape&#x27; on Current.
 local
 l_result: TUPLE [name, color: STRING]
 do
 l_result := a_data_agent (Void)
 print (&quot;draw a &quot; + l_result.color + &quot; &quot; + l_result.name + &quot; on &quot; + type + &quot;%N&quot;)
 end
 type: STRING
 -- Type name of Current.
 deferred end
 end
The agent argument in line #19 and call in line #24 are both polymorphic and decoupled. The agent is decoupled because the {SURFACE}.draw feature has no idea what class `a_data_agent&#x27; is based on. There is no way to tell what class the operation agent was derived from, so it does not have to come from SHAPE or one of its descendants. This is a distinct advantage of Eiffel agents over the single inheritance, dynamic and polymorphic binding of other languages.

The agent is dynamically polymorphic at run-time because the object is created in the moment it is needed, dynamically, where the version of the objectified routine is determined at that time. The only strongly bound knowledge is of the Result type of the agent signature—that is—a named TUPLE with two elements. However, this specific requirement is based on a demand of the enclosing feature (e.g. line #25 uses the named elements of the TUPLE to fulfill `draw&#x27; feature of SURFACE), which is necessary and has not been avoided (and perhaps cannot be).

Finally, note how only the `drawing_agent&#x27; feature is exported to ANY client! This means that the visitor pattern code (who is the ONLY client of this class) only needs to know about the agent to get its job done (e.g. using the agent as the feature applied to the visited objects).

==== SHAPE ====
The SHAPE class has the basis (e.g. drawing data) for what is drawn, perhaps on a SURFACE, but it does not have to be. Again, the agents provide the indirection and class agnostics required to make the co-variant relationship with SHAPE as decoupled as possible.

Additionally, please take note of the fact that SHAPE only provides `drawing_data_agent&#x27; as a fully exported feature to any client. Therefore, the only way to interact with SHAPE, other than creation, is through the facilities of the `drawing_data_agent&#x27;, which is used by ANY client to indirectly and polymorphically gather drawing data for the SHAPE!
 deferred class
 SHAPE
 feature {NONE} -- Initialization
 make_with_color (a_color: like color)
 -- Make with `a_color&#x27; as `color&#x27;.
 do
 color := a_color
 drawing_data_agent := agent drawing_data
 ensure
 color_set: color.same_string (a_color)
 end

 feature -- Access
 drawing_data_agent: FUNCTION [ANY, TUPLE, like drawing_data]
 -- Data agent for drawing.
 feature {NONE} -- Implementation
 drawing_data: TUPLE [name: like name; color: like color]
 -- Data needed for drawing of Current.
 do
 Result := [name, color]
 end
 name: STRING
 -- Object name of Current.
 deferred end
 color: STRING
 -- Color of Current.

 end
=== Classic Spaceship example ===
A variation of the classic Spaceship example has one or more spaceship objects roaming about a universe filled with other items like rogue asteroids and space stations. What we want is a double-dispatch method for handling encounters (e.g. possible collisions) between two co-variant objects in our make-believe universe.
In our example below, the output excursion of our USS Enterprise and USS Excelsior will be:

Starship Enterprise changes position from A-001 to A-002.
Starship Enterprise takes evasive action, avoiding Asteroid `Rogue 1&#x27;!
Starship Enterprise changes position from A-002 to A-003.
Starship Enterprise takes evasive action, avoiding Asteroid `Rogue 2&#x27;!
Starship Enterprise beams a science team to Starship Excelsior as they pass!
Starship Enterprise changes position from A-003 to A-004.
Starship Excelsior changes position from A-003 to A-005.
Starship Enterprise takes evasive action, avoiding Asteroid `Rogue 3&#x27;!
Starship Excelsior is near Space Station Deep Space 9 and is dockable.
Starship Enterprise changes position from A-004 to A-005.
Starship Enterprise beams a science team to Starship Excelsior as they pass!
Starship Enterprise is near Space Station Deep Space 9 and is dockable.
==== Visitor ====
The visitor for the classic Spaceship example also has a double-dispatch mechanism.

make
 -- Allow SPACESHIP objects to visit and move about in a universe.
 local
 l_universe: ARRAYED_LIST [SPACE_OBJECT]
 l_enterprise,
 l_excelsior: SPACESHIP
 do
 create l_enterprise.make_with_name (&quot;Enterprise&quot;, &quot;A-001&quot;)
 create l_excelsior.make_with_name (&quot;Excelsior&quot;, &quot;A-003&quot;)
 create l_universe.make (0)
 l_universe.force (l_enterprise)
 l_universe.force (create {ASTEROID}.make_with_name (&quot;Rogue 1&quot;, &quot;A-002&quot;))
 l_universe.force (create {ASTEROID}.make_with_name (&quot;Rogue 2&quot;, &quot;A-003&quot;))
 l_universe.force (l_excelsior)
 l_universe.force (create {ASTEROID}.make_with_name (&quot;Rogue 3&quot;, &quot;A-004&quot;))
 l_universe.force (create {SPACESTATION}.make_with_name (&quot;Deep Space 9&quot;, &quot;A-005&quot;))
 visit (l_enterprise, l_universe)
 l_enterprise.set_position (&quot;A-002&quot;)
 visit (l_enterprise, l_universe)
 l_enterprise.set_position (&quot;A-003&quot;)
 visit (l_enterprise, l_universe)
 l_enterprise.set_position (&quot;A-004&quot;)
 l_excelsior.set_position (&quot;A-005&quot;)
 visit (l_enterprise, l_universe)
 visit (l_excelsior, l_universe)
 l_enterprise.set_position (&quot;A-005&quot;)
 visit (l_enterprise, l_universe)
 end
feature {NONE} -- Implementation
visit (a_object: SPACE_OBJECT; a_universe: ARRAYED_LIST [SPACE_OBJECT])
 -- `a_object&#x27; visits `a_universe&#x27;.
 do
 across a_universe as ic_universe loop
 check attached {SPACE_OBJECT} ic_universe.item as al_universe_object then
 a_object.encounter_agent.call ([al_universe_object.sensor_data_agent])
 end
 end
 end

The double-dispatch can be seen in line #35, where two indirect agents are working together to provide two co-variant calls working in perfect polymorphic concert with each other. The `a_object&#x27; of the `visit&#x27; feature has an `encounter_agent&#x27; which is called with the sensor data of the `sensor_data_agent&#x27; coming from the `al_universe_object&#x27;.
The other interesting part of this particular example is the SPACE_OBJECT class and its `encounter&#x27; feature:

==== Visitor action ====
The only exported features of a SPACE_OBJECT are the agents for encounter and sensor data, as well as the capacity to set a new position. As one object (the spaceship) visits each object in the universe, the sensor data is collected and passed to the visiting object in its encounter agent. There, the sensor data from the sensor_data_agent (that is—the data element items of the sensor_data TUPLE as returned by the sensor_data_agent query) are evaluated against the current object and a course of action is taken based on that evaluation (see `encounter&#x27; in SPACE_OBJECT below).
All other data is exported to {NONE}. This is similar to C, C++ and Java scopes of Private. As non-exported features, the data and routines are used only internally by each SPACE_OBJECT.
Finally, note that encounter calls to `print&#x27; do not include specific information about possible descendant classes of SPACE_OBJECT! The only thing found at this level in the inheritance are general relational aspects based completely on what can be known from the attributes and routines of a general SPACE_OBJECT. The fact that the output of the `print&#x27; makes sense to us, as human beings, based on what we know or imagine about Star ships, space stations and asteroids is merely logical planning or coincidence. The SPACE_OBJECT is not programmed with any specific knowledge of its descendants.

deferred class
SPACE_OBJECT
feature {NONE} -- Initialization
make_with_name (a_name: like name; a_position: like position)
 -- Initialize Current with `a_name&#x27; and `a_position&#x27;.
 do

 sensor_data_agent := agent sensor_data
 encounter_agent := agent encounter
 ensure
 name_set: name.same_string (a_name)
 position_set: position.same_string (a_position)
 end
feature -- Access

 -- Agent for returning sensor data of Current.

 ensure

 end
feature {NONE} -- Implementation
encounter (a_sensor_agent: FUNCTION [ANY, TUPLE, attached like sensor_data_anchor])
 -- Detect and report on collision status of Current with `a_radar_agent&#x27;.
 do
 a_sensor_agent.call ([Void])
 check attached {like sensor_data_anchor} a_sensor_agent.last_result as al_sensor_data then
 if not name.same_string (al_sensor_data.name) then
 if (position.same_string (al_sensor_data.position)) then
 if ((al_sensor_data.is_dockable and is_dockable) and
 (is_manned and al_sensor_data.is_manned) and
 (is_manueverable and al_sensor_data.is_not_manueverable)) then
 print (type + &quot; &quot; + name + &quot; is near &quot; + al_sensor_data.type + &quot; &quot; +
 al_sensor_data.name + &quot; and is dockable.%N&quot;)
 elseif ((is_dockable and al_sensor_data.is_dockable) and
 (is_manned and al_sensor_data.is_manned) and
 (is_manueverable and al_sensor_data.is_manueverable)) then
 print (type + &quot; &quot; + name + &quot; beams a science team to &quot; + al_sensor_data.type + &quot; &quot; +
 al_sensor_data.name + &quot; as they pass!%N&quot;)
 elseif (is_manned and al_sensor_data.is_not_manned) then
 print (type + &quot; &quot; + name + &quot; takes evasive action, avoiding &quot; +
 al_sensor_data.type + &quot; `&quot; + al_sensor_data.name + &quot;&#x27;!%N&quot;)
 end
 end
 end
 end
 end
name: STRING
 -- Name of Current.
type: STRING
 -- Type of Current.
 deferred
 end
position: STRING
 -- Position of Current.
is_dockable: BOOLEAN
 -- Is Current dockable with another manned object?
 deferred
 end
is_manned: BOOLEAN
 -- Is Current a manned object?
 deferred
 end
is_manueverable: BOOLEAN
 -- Is Current capable of being moved?
 deferred
 end
sensor_data: attached like sensor_data_anchor
 -- Sensor data of Current.
 do
 Result := [name, type, position, is_dockable, not is_dockable, is_manned, not is_manned, is_manueverable, not is_manueverable]
 end

 sensor_data_anchor: detachable TUPLE [name, type, position: STRING; is_dockable, is_not_dockable, is_manned, is_not_manned, is_manueverable, is_not_manueverable: BOOLEAN]
 -- Sensor data type anchor of Current.

end

There are three descendant classes of SPACE_OBJECT:

SPACE_OBJECT
ASTEROID
SPACESHIP
SPACESTATION

In our example, the ASTEROID class is used for the `Rogue&#x27; items, SPACESHIP for the two star ships and SPACESTATION for Deep Space Nine. In each class, the only specialization is the setting of the `type&#x27; feature and of certain properties of the object. The `name&#x27; is supplied in the creation routine as well as the `position&#x27;.
For example: Below is the SPACESHIP example.

class
SPACESHIP
inherit
SPACE_OBJECT
create
make_with_name
feature {NONE} -- Implementation
type: STRING = &quot;Starship&quot;
 -- &lt;Precursor&gt;
is_dockable: BOOLEAN = True
 -- &lt;Precursor&gt;
is_manned: BOOLEAN = True
 -- &lt;Precursor&gt;
is_manueverable: BOOLEAN = True
 -- &lt;Precursor&gt;
end

So, any SPACESHIP in our universe is dock-able, manned and maneuverable. Other objects, like Asteroids are none of these things. A SPACESTATION, on the other hand, is both dock-able and manned, but is not maneuverable. Thus, when one object has an encounter with another, it first checks to see if the positions put them in the vicinity of each other and if they are, then the objects interact based upon their basic properties.
Note that objects with the same type and name are considered to the same object, so an interaction is logically disallowed.

=== Eiffel example conclusion ===
With regards to double-dispatch, Eiffel allows the designer and programmer to further remove a level of direct object-to-object knowledge by decoupling class routines from their classes by way of making them agents and then passing those agents instead of making direct object feature calls. The agents also have specific signatures and possible results (in the case of queries), making them ideal static type checking vehicles without giving up specific object details. The agents are fully polymorphic so that the resulting code has only the specific knowledge required to get its local job done. Otherwise, there is no maintenance burden added by having specific internal class feature knowledge spread around many co-variant objects. The use and mechanics of agents ensure this.
One possible downside of the use of agents is that an agent is computationally more expensive than its direct call counterpart. With this in mind, one ought never to presume the use of agents in the double-dispatch and their application in visitor patterns. If one can clearly see a design limit as to the domain of class types that will be involved in the co-variant interactions, then a direct call is the more efficient solution in terms of computational expense. However, if the class domain of participating types is expected to grow or differ substantially, then agents present an excellent solution to lessening the maintenance burden in the double-dispatch pattern.

<text>Richard Charles Hillman is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, played by Brian Capron. He first appeared on 20 June 2001 and became the show&#x27;s main antagonist until his eventual departure on 14 March 2003. Richard arrives in Weatherfield for the funeral of his late cousin, Alma Halliwell (Amanda Barrie). He befriended Alma&#x27;s close friend, Gail Platt (Helen Worth), and they start a relationship which culminated in them marrying a year later. However, Richard secretly withholds both a homicidal streak and an ongoing financial crisis during the time he occasionally played happy families with Gail along with her two children Sarah-Louise (Tina O&#x27;Brien) and David (Jack P. Shepherd).

Over his stint, Richard ends up leaving his business partner Duggie Ferguson (John Bowe) to die after the latter ends up having a fatal accident, murders his ex-wife Patricia (Annabelle Apsion) with a shovel when she attempts to expose his fraudulent dealings, clashes with Gail&#x27;s ex-husband Martin (Sean Wilson) on certain family occasions, swindles neighbours Jack (Bill Tarmey) and Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn) from their life savings in an investment scam and kidnaps Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden). Richard later begins plotting to kill his mother-in-law Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) by setting her house on fire, after which he exploits his failure to doing so with the conclusion that she has Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and then murders Audrey&#x27;s co-worker Maxine Peacock (Tracy Shaw) with a crowbar after using it to unsuccessfully murder Norris&#x27; roommate Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire) and frames Sarah&#x27;s ex-boyfriend Aiden Critchley (Dean Ashton) for the crimes.

Richard confesses his crimes to Gail in a two-hander episode on 24 February 2003. He seemingly departs Weatherfield after Gail denounces their marriage, and the extent of his illicit activities subsequently became public knowledge, but Richard returns weeks later with the intent of killing his stepfamily and himself. He abducts Gail and her children, along with Sarah&#x27;s infant daughter Bethany, from their house and attempts to kill them all in their garage. However, after Audrey and Martin discovered his last-ditch familicide plan, Richard drove off with his captive stepfamily and ends up plunging their Ford Galaxy into a canal; however, they survived, while he drowned.

Richard&#x27;s popularity on the show caused the character to be referenced multiple time and play a posthumous role in several storylines. Capron played the role of Richard&#x27;s cousin Dickie in the 2010 direct-to-DVD film &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;, which paid homage to the Richard character. In December 2024 it was announced that Capron would return as Richard&#x27;s &quot;ghost&quot; in order to tie into the upcoming exit of Gail.

==Creation and development==

Capron said of playing Richard: &quot;He&#x27;s a wonderful character to play and I&#x27;m enjoying every minute of it. I love the fact that Richard has two sides to him, there&#x27;s the loving family man and the psychopath. He&#x27;s got a real dark side to him, it&#x27;s kind of like a psychopathic nature. He comes across as this normal nice guy on the outside but if people knew what he&#x27;d done they&#x27;d be stunned. In his head I think he seriously believes he loves his family but who knows what goes on in his head.&quot;

In January 2002, it was rumoured that &quot;Coronation Street&quot; executive producer Carolyn Reynolds would be axing several characters in a bid for the show to beat BBC One soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; in the ratings. Characters that were rumoured to be axed were Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) and sons Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) and Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley), Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin), Shelley Unwin (Sally Lindsay) as well as Richard. A source commented: &quot;It&#x27;s Carolyn &#x27;Chainsaw&#x27; Reynolds from here on in. There&#x27;s that much chopping to do that if she used an axe it would take forever. The former producer Brian Park chopped his way through nine characters, but Carolyn is close to knocking off a dozen. It hasn&#x27;t done much for cast morale. Only last year the top earners had to sign up for pay cuts or face the chop themselves. New &quot;strong&quot; characters will be brought in over the coming months, but the number will be limited in order to keep the wage bill down.&quot; These rumours were later proved to be false.

Richard Hillman is renowned as one of the greatest soap villains ever. Throughout his time on the soap, he turned from a conniving fraudster into a fully-fledged serial killer – becoming known as &#x27;Killman&#x27; Hillman by the press. He murdered one Street resident along with his second wife before attempting to kill several others – including his wife, two stepchildren, and step-granddaughter – as well as being partly responsible for the death of Duggie Ferguson. Throughout these storylines, ITV used elaborate trailers using the phrase &#x27;Killer Corrie&#x27;, which was later used to describe other storylines.

Asked how people are reacting to the storyline, Brian Capron said in an interview with &quot;Digital Spy&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s great, it really seems to be capturing people&#x27;s imaginations. Everyone just wants to know what he&#x27;s going to do next and if he&#x27;ll kill Gail. I don&#x27;t know what the writers have got planned for Richard but he&#x27;s definitely not finished yet I can promise that. I think he&#x27;ll be homing in on one or two of the street&#x27;s best-loved residents. He&#x27;s definitely going to get nastier before he gets his comeuppance&quot;.

===Legacy===
Richard&#x27;s popularity on the show caused the character to be referenced multiple times and play a posthumous role in several storylines. Capron played the role of Richard&#x27;s cousin Dickie in the 2010 direct-to-DVD film &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;, which paid homage to the Richard character.

In December 2024 it was announced that Capron would return as Richard&#x27;s &quot;ghost&quot; in order to tie into the upcoming exit of Gail.

==Storylines==
===Backstory===
Before arriving in Coronation Street, Richard Hillman became a financial advisor and married twice. He and his first wife, Marian, tried to have a baby for many years without success. When Richard&#x27;s mother falls ill, Marian decides she doesn&#x27;t want to look after an old pensioner, so she leaves Richard. During their separation, Marian dies. Sometime later, Richard&#x27;s mother died, and he married his second wife, Patricia (Annabelle Apsion). Like Marian beforehand, Patricia wants children, and she and Richard are shocked to discover that he is sterile. Knowing that Richard and Marian had tried unsuccessfully to have a child, Patricia believes that Richard has deceived her about his fertility. However, Richard later tells his third wife Gail Platt (Helen Worth) that he had always believed that Marian was at fault and was stunned to discover that he was responsible. Regardless, Patricia and Richard divorced.

===2001–2003===
Richard Hillman makes his first appearance in Weatherfield when he attends the funeral of a resident, Alma Baldwin (Amanda Barrie), in the summer of 2001, claiming to be her cousin. He quickly befriends Alma&#x27;s best friend, Gail, and they gradually form a romantic relationship together. Richard moves in with her, winning over her children Sarah-Louise (Tina O&#x27;Brien) and David (Jack P. Shepherd) by buying them expensive gifts. He also forms an unlikely mutual friendship with Gail&#x27;s ex-husband Martin Platt (Sean Wilson); they initially became hostile to each other after Richard shouts at David for going on his computer without permission, but the pair soon befriend each other as time goes on.

Richard&#x27;s dealings are soon questioned after local shopkeeper Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) learns that Richard was responsible for several older people losing their savings. Richard sets up a business called Kellett Holdings, which specialises in buy-back mortgages — he would buy the house, but the occupant was free to live there until their death. Richard also goes into business with the new Rovers Return landlord Duggie Ferguson (John Bowe), building an estate of new homes. Richard confronts Duggie at an under-construction block of flats during a disagreement about Duggie&#x27;s shoddy workmanship. During the argument, Duggie falls several storeys when a bannister gives way - ironically, due to his own shoddy workmanship. Duggie is critically injured, and Richard leaves him to die, opportunistically allowing the incident to remove his unwanted business partner. He panics at first, whipping out his mobile and dialling emergency services. However, he only dials &quot;99&quot; before stopping; then, he goes to Duggie&#x27;s flat to steal the cash Duggie stored there.

In May 2002, Richard&#x27;s ex-wife, Patricia, inconveniently turns up as Richard finalises his and Gail&#x27;s wedding plans. As she is moving to Australia, Patricia wants to cash in her directorship of Kellett Holdings, Richard&#x27;s property company. Patricia owns 20% of Kellett Holdings, which Richard finally persuades her is worth £25,000. He agrees to hand over the cheque at his Oakhill flats development, where they descend into an argument as Richard stalls on the money due to the cost of underpinning work. In the ensuing confrontation, Patricia falls into the underpinning trench and spits on Richard&#x27;s face upon vowing to expose him; in response, Richard hits Patricia on the head with a spade - killing her instantly. The next day, her body is covered in tons of cement for the underpinnings. Gail and Richard are married on 28 July 2002.

Upon returning from their honeymoon, Richard learns that his business is going downhill. His attempts to uphold his marriage to Gail are threatened when Patricia&#x27;s best friend, Charlotte Morris (Joanne Zorian), visits the street about the circumstances of her disappearance; however, Richard manages to convince her otherwise, and Charlotte leaves Weatherfield for good. When he learns that Gail&#x27;s mother Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) is worth £250,000, he hatches a plan to save his business from being on the verge of financial bankruptcy. Over the next few months, Richard manages to convince Audrey and her family that she has Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, even getting the doctor to prescribe her medication for sufferers of the condition, and tries to kill her by setting her house on fire. She survives after being pulled out of the blaze by Richard&#x27;s second business partner, Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), and later tries to warn Gail; however, already convinced that her mother is indeed senile, Gail refuses to believe Audrey and the pair end up quarrelling over Audrey&#x27;s theory about Richard. Eventually, Gail cuts all ties with Audrey after she and her friend Archie Shuttleworth (Roy Hudd) – who became aware of Richard&#x27;s agenda when the pair had a previous debate over Patricia&#x27;s funeral – had reported Richard to the police. However, they were unsuccessful due to a lack of evidence.

Richard becomes desperate for money and resolves to kill again. He decides to target Audrey&#x27;s neighbour Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire), whose house he had bought. During a birthday party at The Rovers Return, where Gail and the others are helping their friend Doreen Heavey (Prunella Gee) celebrate her 50th birthday, Richard leaves the pub. He then goes to the squat where Sarah&#x27;s tearaway ex-boyfriend Aiden Critchley (Dean Ashton) is staying, and since Richard has drugged Aiden, he can take and use Critchley&#x27;s coat and shoes without him waking up. Disguised as Critchley, he enters the house owned by Doreen&#x27;s daughter Maxine (Tracy Shaw), where Emily is babysitting. Richard attacks Emily with a crowbar, but he is interrupted when Maxine enters the house and confronts him. Richard then kills Maxine by beating her to death with the crowbar and stages a robbery to frame Aiden, who is subsequently charged with murder and attempted murder.

Soon afterwards, Richard receives a phone call from a woman telling him that her father, who had sold his home to Richard in a buy-back scheme, had died two weeks earlier. He is wracked with guilt, realising that the attempt on Emily&#x27;s life and Maxine&#x27;s murder had been pointless.

This also impacts Maxine&#x27;s funeral, in which Richard ends up delivering a heartfelt speech about Maxine to cover up her murder further. Upon watching him, Audrey realises that Richard killed Maxine and desperately tries again to prove her theory; however, she is dismissed, and Richard is later hailed a hero by Maxine&#x27;s husband Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold), who thanks him for contributing to his late wife&#x27;s funeral.

Richard&#x27;s downfall begins on the day that his money troubles end. He receives the money from the buy-back scheme and puts a deposit on an expensive new house for the family, after which farewell drinks are arranged for him and Gail. Whilst Richard blissfully looks to the future, drug tests show that Aiden was drugged with the tranquillisers prescribed for Audrey. Sarah visits Aiden in his detention centre, where he adamantly tells her that he did not commit the murder. Audrey tells Gail this, who also learns that Richard has lied about several matters connected to his ex-wife&#x27;s disappearance. She recalls seeing Richard at the cabinet where the tranquillisers were kept on the night of Maxine&#x27;s murder. In The Rovers Return, Richard tells Gail that he does not care about Audrey and Archie&#x27;s accusations because &quot;he&#x27;s won&quot; before quickly correcting himself to &quot;we&#x27;ve won&quot;, which proves to be one of his fatal errors. Steve then reveals that he had found a bracelet on the building site that Gail was currently wearing, a bracelet Richard claimed he had bought for her.

After making a farewell speech at everyone&#x27;s request, Richard spots Gail heading home and follows her. He is stunned when she accuses him of various crimes after finding out that the tranquillisers were in the cupboard before Richard disposed of them. Caught off-guard, Richard confesses to killing Maxine; Gail is shocked and does not buy Richard&#x27;s excuse when he attempts to blame Aidan for what he did to Sarah. In the ensuing argument between them, Richard finally comes clean about his other crimes to Gail, explaining in full detail how he left Duggie for dead after seeing him fall and then covering up Patrica&#x27;s disappearance when he murdered her. Realising that Audrey, Archie, and Norris were right about Richard all along, Gail describes her husband as &quot;Norman Bates with a briefcase&quot;. She then guesses that Richard is sterile and accuses him of not being in love with her, saying that he had merely married her to gain the &quot;ready-made family&quot; she, David, Sarah and Sarah&#x27;s daughter, Bethany, provided. Richard is horrified by Gail&#x27;s words and reluctantly leaves. Gail then tells the police everything, including the location of Patricia&#x27;s body, and they dig it out of the cement, thus confirming Richard as a guilty man.

As Richard goes on the run, becoming the most wanted man in Britain, his crimes are publicly exposed, with Emily finally learning that Norris was right about Richard all along, while Ashley learns that Richard was the one who killed his wife, not Ade. In response to the news, Ashley confronts Gail over Maxine&#x27;s murder and wishes her dead. In March 2003, Gail&#x27;s efforts to overcome Richard&#x27;s antics grow increasingly harder when the police investigate her husband&#x27;s property company, Kellett Holdings. It soon turns out that Richard&#x27;s company is non-existent and that he has been defrauding several people, including Jack and Vera. To make matters worse, Gail is under suspicion of collaborating with Richard in his criminal activities when the police confirm that she had been working alongside him in his &quot;company&quot;. The situation worsens for Gail when Jack and Vera later learn that Richard has conned them out of their investment. Although Jack gradually copes with the result, Vera begins harassing Gail and even goes as far as to smash their window when Gail is forced to tell them that she cannot afford to repay the money Richard stole from them. This soon leads to David smashing Vera&#x27;s window as she continues harassing his mother. When Vera plans to report David to the police after learning about this, David breaks down and explains that Richard is the reason why she lost her money and is also the reason why Gail is having a difficult time. In response, Vera eventually accepts the result and later makes amends with Gail.

Gail&#x27;s troubles seem to have finally ended when she recovers from her trauma and manages to recoup her relationship with both her mother and children. However, Richard soon returns to Weatherfield with a last-ditch familicide intent, seeking to be with Gail and her children by his side forever by killing them and himself. He is in the house when David returns home and keeps him silent when David&#x27;s new friend Craig Harris (Richard Fleeshman) calls through the window. When Sarah returns later with her new boyfriend, Todd, she leaves her daughter Bethany on the sofa. After she has seen Todd out, Richard takes them captive. Gail returns home in the evening and has her hands tied by Richard; however, she manages to smuggle a pair of nail scissors into her hands on the way out of the house. The children are safe but are bound and gagged in the family&#x27;s car. While Gail tells them she loves them, she puts the scissors in Sarah&#x27;s hands. Initially, Richard intended to gas the family in the garage until Audrey called in and disturbed his plans. With the help of Martin and his friends, local mechanic Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell) and Craig&#x27;s father Tommy (Thomas Craig), they break down the garage door to see Richard has abducted Gail and her children. Richard then proceeds to drive off with his captive stepfamily.

As Richard flees, Martin pursues him with Kevin and Tommy in another car. The trio catches up with Richard just as his stepfamily frees themselves. They try to get Richard to stop the car, which prompts him to drive the car into the canal - though not before he shouts to Gail and her children, &quot;This is it! I LOVE YOU!&quot;. Gail, Bethany, David and Sarah free themselves from the vehicle and are rescued by Tommy and Martin on shore. Tommy then returns to the water to save Richard but finds he has escaped from the car. Later on, the police inform Gail that a body has been found at the canal side; she returns there with Audrey, and together they identify the body as Richard&#x27;s. With her husband dead and all the troubles he inflicted upon both her family and the Weatherfield community over at last, Gail heads home with Audrey after throwing the rings that Richard gave her into the canal. Towards the end of March 2003, Richard&#x27;s funeral takes place, with Archie carrying out the ceremony and Gail reluctantly attending alone to ensure that her killer husband is laid to rest for good. Shortly afterwards, Gail returned to join the rest of the community in celebrating Maxine&#x27;s memorial. There, Ashley comforted Gail over her ordeal with Richard and forgave her over Maxine&#x27;s death.

===2024===
On Christmas Eve 2024, Gail experiences a vision of Richard, who taunts her over her impending marriage to Jesse Chadwick (John Thomson) and claims she will never be happier than she was with him. Gail ultimately rejects Richard before waking up on Christmas Day, revealing the whole confrontation to be a dream; Gail goes on to marry Jesse and leave Coronation Street for good.

==Reception==
The character of Richard Hillman proved to be very successful with viewers and critics. On 13 January 2003, an estimated 15.3 million viewers watched the first instalment of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; with 15.6 million tuning in to watch Richard murder long-standing character Maxine Peacock in the second episode. The two episodes caused a power surge; a National Grid spokesman said: &quot;Obviously, there was a huge audience which meant at the end of the programme people were getting up, turning lights on, going to the toilet, opening fridge doors and boiling kettles. It&#x27;s that concentrated period when a programme finishes and millions of people around the country go and do something else other than watching Coronation Street.&quot;

The double-bill broadcast on 24 February 2003, in which Richard revealed all to Gail, attracted an average of 17.2 million viewers for the first instalment, with the second episode averaging 17.6 million. The second episode peaked at 19.4 million. A spokesperson for Granada Television stated, &quot;The figures are truly staggering. The phones haven&#x27;t stopped here with fantastic feedback. The whole nation has woken up and is talking about it.&quot; 
On 12 March 2003, 19.4 million viewers (62% audience share) tuned in to see Richard drive the Platt family into the canal. The ratings success of the serial killer storyline made &quot;Coronation Street&quot; the most-watched UK television programme of 2003, beating rival &quot;EastEnders&quot; into second place.

At the 2003 British Soap Awards, Capron swept the board for his portrayal of Richard, winning for &#x27;Best Actor&#x27;, &#x27;Best Exit&#x27; and &#x27;Villain of the Year&#x27;. His confessions episode was voted &#x27;Most Spectacular Scene&#x27; and his murders were voted &#x27;Best Storyline&#x27;. In a 2003 &quot;TVTimes&quot; poll, Richard was voted the top soap villain of all time.

<text>In the sports of baseball and softball, a batted ball is a pitch that has been contacted by the batter&#x27;s bat. Batted balls are either fair or foul, and can be characterized as a fly ball, pop-up, line drive, or ground ball. In baseball, a foul ball counts as a strike against the batter, unless there are already two strikes on the batter, with special rules applying to foul tips and foul bunts. Fly balls are those hit in an arcing manner, with pop-ups being a subset of fly balls that do not travel far. Line drives are batted balls hit on a straight line trajectory, while ground balls are hit at a low trajectory, contact the ground shortly after being hit, and then either roll or bounce. Batted balls, especially line drives, can present a hazard to players, umpires, and spectators, as people have been seriously injured or killed after being struck by batted balls.

==Fair or foul==

On the playing field, two straight lines (each known as a foul line) are drawn from the corner of home plate; one past first base and one past third base. The foul lines extend all the way to the outer limit of the outfield, typically a wall or fence, and perpendicularly up the wall or fence. The entire area between foul lines, including the foul lines themselves, is considered fair territory; anything not in fair territory is considered foul territory.

In general, batted balls are judged by where they land (first contact the ground) or are first touched by a player. That is, a batted ball landing in fair territory or first touched by a player in fair territory is fair, while a batted ball landing in foul territory or first touched by a player in foul territory is foul. However, batted balls in the infield (not yet at or beyond first base or third base) are judged on either where they are first touched by a player or &quot;where they come to rest&quot;. For example, if a batted ball &quot;in the infield&quot; first lands in foul territory but then rolls into fair territory and is touched there or comes to rest there, it is fair. Likewise, if a batted ball &quot;in the infield&quot; first lands in fair territory but then rolls into foul territory and is touched there or comes to rest there, it is foul.

That a batted ball hit into the ground has to pass first base or third base in fair territory to be considered fair originated in response to &quot;fair-foul&quot; hitting of the 1860s and 1870s. Batters would intentionally hit the ball into the ground in fair territory near home plate, at an angle that would send it into foul territory away from the fielders, allowing the batter to reach first base successfully. Dickey Pearce, a well-known and respected player of the era, is credited with inventing the tactic.

===Effect===
Fielders can attempt to make an out by catching any ball hit in the air, fair or foul, as long as it is still in play. Balls that leave the field of play, such as by going into spectator areas or the dugouts, are out of play. For balls on the ground, fielders can attempt to make an out on fair balls only.

A batted ball that clears the outfield fence in fair territory is a home run. Since 1931, whether such a batted ball is fair or foul is judged on its position when it leaves the field (that is, where it is as it passes over the outfield fence or wall). Previously, the ball had to be &quot;fair when last seen&quot; to be ruled a home run. Also since 1931, the ball must clear the fence or wall on the fly to be a home run; previously, the ball could bounce over and still be considered a home run—such a batted ball is now an automatic double.

A foul ball normally counts as a strike unless the batter already has had two strikes assessed against them, in which case the count does not change. Treating foul balls as strikes was adopted by the National League in 1901 and the American League in 1903. There are specific rules for foul tips and foul bunts, which are described below. In slow-pitch softball, a foul ball &quot;always&quot; counts as a strike, even when the batter already has two strikes.

==Characterization==
Major League Baseball (MLB) uses four characterizations for all batted balls put into play:

===Fly ball===
A fly ball is a batted ball hit in an arcing manner. For statistical purposes, MLB uses the term &quot;fly ball&quot; for such balls that go into the outfield, and a separate term (pop-up, below) for such balls that stay in the infield.

Fielders attempt to catch fly balls on their descent, and an out is recorded if the ball is caught before it hits the ground. Under early baseball rules, a fly ball caught on a bounce also resulted in an out; this was abolished for fair balls in 1864 and for foul balls in 1883.

===Pop-up===
A pop-up is a fly ball that does not travel far; rather than going into the outfield, it is hit to the infield. Such a batted ball may, under specific circumstances, be deemed an &quot;infield fly&quot; by an umpire, which has special consideration as outlined below.

===Line drive===

A line drive (colloquially, a &quot;liner&quot; or &quot;rope&quot;) is a batted ball &quot;hit in a nearly straight line usually not far above the ground.&quot; Batters are usually most successful when they hit line drives, reaching base over 70% of the time, as compared to about 25% of the time on ground balls or fly balls.

===Ground ball===
A ground ball (colloquially, a &quot;grounder&quot;) is a batted ball hit at a low enough trajectory that it contacts the ground a short distance after being hit and &quot;rolls or bounces close to the ground.&quot; The term is &quot;not&quot; used for fly balls, pop-ups, or line drives that are uncaught and happen to contact the ground.

==Statistics==

MLB.com provides statistics for hitters, using the above four categories, as part of a &quot;Batted Ball Profile&quot;. For example, during the 2022 season, for the balls that designated hitter J. D. Martinez of the Boston Red Sox put into play, 38.2% were ground balls, 30.8% were fly balls, 26.7% were line drives, and 4.3% were pop-ups (the four figures sum to 100%).

FanGraphs also provides batted ball statistics, but uses the four categories slightly differently: all balls put into play are characterized into one of &quot;three&quot; categories: ground ball, fly ball (regardless of where hit), or line drive. The percentage of fly balls that were hit in the infield is then provided as a separate figure. FanGraphs&#x27;s statistics for Martinez for the 2022 season indicate 38.2% ground balls, 39.7% fly balls, and 22.1% line drives (the three figures sum to 100%). Martinez also had a 5.8% &quot;infield fly ball percentage&quot;, meaning that 5.8% of the fly balls he hit were infield pop-ups.

In 2010, FanGraphs noted that the &quot;league average&quot; for batted ball rates was 44% ground balls, 35% fly balls, and 21% line drives (the three figures sum to 100%) with 11% of fly balls being infield pop-ups.

==Special cases==
The following have special rules considerations.

===Infield fly===

A specific rule applies to infielders attempting to catch some fly balls: the infield fly rule, which has specific context. If (and only if) there are less than two outs and there are baserunners on first base and second base (or the bases are loaded) a fly ball &quot;which can be caught by an infielder with ordinary effort&quot; results in the batter being called out, regardless of if the ball is caught. This rule is in place to prevent infielders from intentionally not catching the ball and being able to record multiple outs via a force play.

An infield fly is verbally declared by an umpire, whose decision &quot;should be made immediately&quot;. Umpires commonly also give a visual indication by pointing straight up in the air with their right arm. If a batted ball declared to be an infield fly is left untouched and it comes to rest (or is first touched) in foul territory before passing first base or third base, it is treated the same as any other foul ball (that is, the batter is &quot;not&quot; automatically out). The infield fly rule was adopted in 1895.

===Foul tip===
By rule, a foul tip is &quot;a batted ball that goes sharp and direct from the bat to the catcher&#x27;s hands and is legally caught.&quot; A foul tip is considered to be the same as a regular strike, thus a foul tip (that is caught per the definition) with two strikes already against the batter results in a strikeout. This provision has been part of baseball rules since 1895.

===Bunt===

A bunt is a special type of batted ball. Bunts occur when pitched balls are &quot;intentionally met with the bat&quot; rather than being swung at. A ball that is bunted by a batter may be fair or foul, and while generally it does not travel very far, it may be a ground ball (the desired outcome), pop-up, or (rarely) line drive.

====Foul bunt====
Unlike other types of batted balls, for which a third strike is not assessed when a foul ball is hit with two strikes in the count, a third strike &quot;is&quot; assessed to the batter when a two-strike bunt goes foul, resulting in a strikeout. This rule originated as early as 1894 in response to batters intentionally bunting pitches foul in order to tire the pitcher, also impacting pace of play.

==Safety concerns==

Batted balls, especially line drives, can be dangerous to players, umpires, and spectators. There are myriad examples; several are provided below. A batted ball hit sharply at the pitcher is known as a &quot;comebacker&quot;.

In August 1982, Jim Rice of the Boston Red Sox left the dugout to carry a young boy that had been hit by a foul line drive into the team&#x27;s clubhouse for medical treatment; the boy later underwent emergency surgery at a local hospital. In July 2007, first base coach Mike Coolbaugh was killed when a foul line drive hit him in the head during a minor-league game. Umpire Dale Scott had to leave a game in August 2012 after being struck by a foul tip while serving as home plate umpire, and also had to leave a game in June 2015 when struck by a line drive while umpiring at second base. In May 2019, a young fan at a Houston Astros game required hospitalization after being hit with a foul line drive. In a June 2021 minor-league game, pitcher Tyler Zombro was hit in the head by a line drive, fracturing his skull and causing him to have a seizure.

<text>The Chaser election specials are a number of Australian political satire based comedy programs produced by The Chaser. The shows, which have run under various titles, provide commentary on Australian federal election and has been produced since 2001 for ABC TV. The first show, The Election Chaser in 2001 was the first ever television production of the Chaser team. In 2004 and 2007 they produced The Chaser Decides which won the Logie Award for &quot;Most Outstanding Comedy Program&quot; for the 2004 series. In 2010, the Chaser team produced a 5-episode series about the 2010 election, called Yes We Canberra!. A new series was produced for the 2013 election, called The Hamster Decides. &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s Election Desk&quot; aired in the six weeks prior to the 2016 federal election.

==Series==
===2001 series (&quot;The Election Chaser&quot;)===
The show was the first television production of The Chaser team, which had been running their satirical newspaper &quot;The Chaser&quot; since 1999. An ABC personality, Andrew Denton, offered the Chaser, as a collective, a contract with the ABC and they went on to produce &quot;The Election Chaser&quot;, which first aired on 23 October 2001. It was based around the 2001 federal election and was presented in the form of an election tally room, similar to the regular ABC election coverage. The presenters (panelists) were Charles Firth, Julian Morrow, Chris Taylor, Craig Reucassel, Chas Licciardello and Dominic Knight. The show was nominated for &quot;Most Outstanding Comedy Program&quot; in the 2002 Logies but lost to &quot;The Micallef Program&quot;, which also ran on the ABC.

===2004 series (&quot;The Chaser Decides&quot;)===
Since &quot;The Election Chaser&quot;, the Chaser team had gone on to produce &quot;CNNNN&quot;, a spoof of various 24-hour news networks, which ran in 2002 and 2003. &quot;CNNNN&quot; won the 2004 Logie for &quot;Most Outstanding Comedy Program&quot;. With the 2004 federal election looming, The Chaser team decided to produce another series based upon &quot;The Election Chaser&quot;. The show was titled &quot;The Chaser Decides&quot; and ran at the timeslot of Thursday from 24 September 2004 to 14 October 2004.

The show was presented again in a National Tally Room, but only had four presenters in Morrow, Reucassel, Taylor and Andrew Hansen. Licciardello and Firth did reporting roles while Knight stayed on as a writer. The show was hugely popular and won the 2005 Logie award for &quot;Most Outstanding Comedy Program&quot;.

===2007 series (&quot;The Chaser Decides&quot;)===

Following the second series of &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot;, the Chaser crew produced two episodes of &quot;The Chaser Decides&quot; based on the 2007 federal election. The two episodes replaced the &quot;War on Everything&quot; in its timeslot for 21 November and 28 November 2007. The format took the same as the 2004 series.

===2010 series (&quot;Yes We Canberra&quot;)===
For the 2010 federal election, The Chaser appeared in five episodes of the retitled &quot;Yes We Canberra!&quot;. Four episodes aired before the election date on Wednesday&#x27;s at 9.45 pm and one episode after the election in that timeslot. This was the group&#x27;s first television production in almost a year after the third and final season of &quot;War on Everything&quot; in 2009. The show premiered on 28 July 2010, with the election to be held on 21 August. The shows context was supposedly part of news program Lateline with the Chaser team being there to warm up the crowd for Tony Jones or Leigh Sales. To this effect the show was held on a set with the same design as Lateline (whereas the &quot;real&quot; Lateline set does not feature an audience) with Jones and Sales making guest appearances. This was changed for the final episode when the show preceded , so that set design was used with guest appearances by hosts David Stratton and Margaret Pomeranz.

A DVD containing all five episodes plus extras and commentary was released by Roadshow Entertainment on 16 September 2010. Extras include deleted and extended scenes plus behind the scenes footage.

===2013 series (&quot;The Hamster Decides&quot;)===
In March 2012, the Chaser announced the 2013 election series, tentatively called The Election Hamster. It was announced that it will be called &quot;The Hamster Decides&quot; and the first of five episodes was to air on 21 August 2013. When Kevin Rudd announced the change of election date from 14 to 7 September, the first episode was brought forward one week to 14 August. The show was run at a timeslot of 9:15pm on Wednesday. The set used was the same set as &quot;The Hamster Wheel&quot;.

===2016 series (&quot;The Chaser’s Election Desk&quot;)===
The 2016 series, &quot;The Chaser’s Election Desk&quot;, began on 8 June 2016. New cast members that joined the series included Zoe Norton Lodge, Ben Jenkins, Kirsten Drysdale, Alex Lee, Scott Abbot, Mark Sutton and Hannah Reilly.
===2019 series (&quot;Democracy Sausage&quot;)===
In November 2018, it was announced that the ABC declined to fund an election special for the 2019 election. Instead, Taylor and Reucassel hosted a podcast, &quot;Democracy Sausage&quot;, available for free on the ABC&#x27;s website. In the later weeks of the campaign episodes were also available on ABC iView and ABC Comedy.

===2022 series (The Chaser Report: Election Edition)===
There was again no TV series for the 2022 election. Instead, Charles Firth and Dominic Knight did a free daily election podcast called &quot;The Chaser Report: Election Edition&quot;. Other members Craig Reucassel, Andrew Hansen, Chris Taylor and Chas Licciardello appear occasionally, as well as the &quot;Chaser Interns&quot;, with occasional pranks uploaded to The Chaser&#x27;s social media channels.

==Home release==
On 3 December 2010, a DVD titled &quot;The Chaser Election Collection&quot; was released. It contained every election special The Chaser had screened to date, as well as special features including the never-before-seen &quot;The Election Chaser&quot; pilot.

==Jokes/Segments==
===Primary===
====The Mal Award====
Every episode of the show ends with a member of The Chaser presenting The Mal Award, named after Mal Meninga&#x27;s extremely short political career in 2001. Every week, the team present the award to a politician &quot;for the greatest act of political suicide during an election campaign&quot;. In the 28 November 2007 episode, Meninga satirised himself when brought in to present the award but &quot;gave up&quot; mid-speech.

===Former===
====&quot;This Person Votes&quot;====

A joke featured in all but the 2010 series, the show would often feature short clips of people (usually drunk) acting ignorant towards the election (e.g. &quot;I reckon Mickey Mouse is the best&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s John Howard?&quot;), followed by an on-screen graphic that reads &quot;This Person Votes.&quot; For episodes that aired after the election, it was replaced by &quot;This Person Voted.&quot;

====Scrolling newsbar====

For the 2004 and 2007 series, a newsbar - similar to the one that would appear in CNNNN - would scroll across the bottom of the screen, with humorous news items. For the 2010, 2013 and 2016 series, it was replaced with fake Twitter updates from celebrities and politicians.

<text>Luciano Bottaro (16 November 1931 – 25 November 2006) was an Italian comic book artist.

He was influenced by Otto Messmer&#x27;s &quot;Felix the Cat&quot;, Winsor McCay&#x27;s &quot;Little Nemo in Slumberland&quot;, Frederick Burr Opper&#x27;s &quot;Happy Hooligan&quot;, Rudolph Dirks&#x27;s &quot;the Katzenjammer Kids&quot;, and Barks and Gottfredson&#x27;s Disney adaptations.

== Biography ==
Born in Rapallo, he abandoned his accounting studies for cartooning in 1949. That year, he began his career for &quot;Lo Scolaro&quot;, an Italian magazine, with the character Aroldo il bucaniere.

He worked for &quot;La Domenica del Corriere&quot;, Edizioni Alpe and Mondadori, the Italian Disney comics publisher: his first story was &quot;Paperino e le onorificenze&quot; written by Alberto Testa and published in 1952.

In the same year he began to collaborate with Guido Scala and Franco Aloisi. They were subsequently joined by Carlo Chendi. Unofficially they were called &quot;Rapallo&#x27;s School&quot;, before the birth of the &quot;Bierrecì Studios&quot;.

== Bierrecì Studios ==
Besides his work on Disney&#x27;s characters, he worked on other magazines, creating a lot of characters (&quot;Whisky &amp; Gogo&quot;, &quot;Baldo&quot;, &quot;Pon Pon&quot;, &quot;Giò Polpetta&quot;, &quot;Maramao&quot;), and in 1958 he founded the Bierrecì Studios with Carlo Chendi and Giorgio Rebuffi.

The first Bierreci Studios&#x27; publication was &quot;Re di Picche&quot;, a comic book that published the adventures of the king of the cards, a pitiless and blood-thirsty parody of military world, inspired by &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;.

One of his most popular characters was &quot;Pepito&quot;, the comical adventures of a 17th-century buccaneer who fights, among others, the greedy, grasping but essentially lovable Governor of a Spanish Caribbean colony. Published in various countries in magazines that ranged from monthly to fortnightly, &quot;Pepito&quot; proved surprisingly more popular outside of Italy than in its country of origin.

Several cartoonists began working with them, including Maria Luisa Uggetti, Tiberio Colantuoni, Ivo Milazzo, Giancarlo Berardi. They worked on several characters, including Mickey Mouse, Uncle Scrooge, Warner Bros. characters.

They also produced the comics version of &quot;Carosello&quot;, an Italian television program that, during the 1950s and 1960s, played the first Italian advertisements.

==Reprints==
Fantagraphics has since 2018 reprinted some of Bottaro&#x27;s Disney comics in volumes of the &quot;Disney Masters&quot; hardcover series.

<doc id="1010701" wikidata="Q2699476" url="?curid=1010701" title="The Circus (Erasure album)">
<text>The Circus is the second studio album by the English synth-pop duo Erasure, released on 30 March 1987 by Mute Records in Germany and the United Kingdom and on 7 July 1987 by Sire Records in the United States. It was Erasure&#x27;s second consecutive album to be produced by Flood.

&quot;The Circus&quot; became the duo&#x27;s breakthrough in the UK, spawning four successful singles and reaching number six. It was an immediate success thanks to the number two UK placing of the first single &quot;Sometimes&quot;, six months earlier. The album remains Erasure&#x27;s longest-running on the UK charts.

Although mainstream success in the US did not occur with this album, it did generate two hits (including a number-one) on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. It also became their first record to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

&quot;The Two Ring Circus&quot;, also released in 1987, is a double 12-inch remix album that served as a companion piece to &quot;The Circus&quot;. It includes remixes and re-recordings along with live bonus tracks on the cassette and CD versions.

==Reissues==
On 4 July 2011, EMI re-released Erasure&#x27;s first two albums in 2CD/DVD format. Both feature the original album remastered, plus another disc of tracks associated with the album, and a DVD containing promo videos and a live concert.

Subsequent to their acquisition of Erasure&#x27;s back catalogue, and in anticipation of the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 2016, BMG commissioned reissues of all previously released UK editions of Erasure albums up to and including 2007&#x27;s &quot;Light at the End of the World&quot;. All titles were pressed and distributed by Play It Again Sam on 180-gram vinyl and shrinkwrapped with a custom anniversary sticker.

In 2016, American boutique record label Intervention Records acquired access to Sire Records&#x27; US analogue masters of Erasure&#x27;s &quot;Wonderland&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Circus&quot; (1987), as well as the rights to remaster and reissue them. &quot;Wonderland&quot; was released in December of that year, pressed on 180-gram vinyl and in a 60s-style Tip-On jacket. However, despite finalized art copy and announcing that production had completed for its Q1 2017 release, &quot;The Circus&quot; was withdrawn in February of that year.

<doc id="1010702" wikidata="Q2470698" url="?curid=1010702" title="East Farndon">
<text>East Farndon is a small linear village and civil parish about one mile south of Market Harborough in West Northamptonshire, England. The village is close to the border with Leicestershire, and has a Leicestershire post code and telephone dialling code. At the time of the 2001 census, the parish&#x27;s population was 258 people, increasing to 307 at the 2011 census.

The villages name means &#x27;Ferny hill&#x27;.

The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. In a field on the west side of the parish is the Judith Stone. This is a glacial erratic, brought from probably hundreds of miles away during an ice age. It is thought to take its name from the Countess Judith, niece of William the Conqueror. She is recorded in the Domesday Book as holding land in the parish, so perhaps the stone marked a boundary of some kind.

The church stands at the top of a hill and the village street runs down the hill quite steeply from there towards the town of Market Harborough. The church dates mainly from the 13th and 14th centuries and has a fine tower which can be seen for some miles around. 
King Charles&#x27;s army came through the village and occupied the ridge to the south of the church before its defeat at the Battle of Naseby in 1645.

==Notable buildings==
The Historic England website contains details of a total of six listed buildings in the parish of East Farndon, all of which are Grade II apart from St John the Baptist&#x27;s Church, which is Grade I. They include:
*St John the Baptist&#x27;s Church
*East Farndon Hall, Back Road
*Home Farmhouse, Back Road
*Kiln Yard, Marston Lane
*The Manor House, Back Road

<doc id="1010708" wikidata="Q910656" url="?curid=1010708" title="Neem oil">
<text>Neem oil, also known as margosa oil, is a vegetable oil pressed from the fruits and seeds of the neem (&quot;Azadirachta indica&quot;), a tree which is indigenous to the Indian subcontinent and has been introduced to many other areas in the tropics. It is the most important of the commercially available products of neem, and its chemical properties have found widespread use as a pesticide in organic farming.

== Composition ==
Azadirachtin is the most well known and studied triterpenoid in neem oil. Nimbin is another triterpenoid which has been credited with some of neem oil&#x27;s properties as an antiseptic, antifungal, antipyretic and antihistamine.

== Uses ==

=== Ayurveda ===
Neem oil has a history of use in Ayurvedic folk medicine.

=== Pesticide ===
Formulations that include neem oil have found wide usage as a biopesticide for horticulturists and for organic farming, as it repels a wide variety of insect pests including mealy bugs, beet armyworms, aphids, cabbage worms, thrips, whiteflies, mites, fungus gnats, beetles, moth larvae, mushroom flies, leaf miners, caterpillars, locusts, nematodes and Japanese beetles. 

When sufficiently diluted and not concentrated directly into their area of habitat or on their food source, neem oil is not known to be harmful to mammals, birds, earthworms or some beneficial insects such as butterflies, honeybees and ladybugs. It can be used as a household pesticide for ants, bedbugs, cockroaches, houseflies, sand flies, snails, termites and mosquitoes both as a repellent and as a larvicide.

Neem extracts act as an antifeedant and block the action of the insect molting hormone ecdysone. Azadirachtin is the most active of these growth regulators (limonoids), occurring at 0.2–0.4% in the seeds of the neem tree.

== Toxicity ==
The ingestion of neem oil is potentially toxic and can cause metabolic acidosis, seizures, kidney failure, encephalopathy and severe brain ischemia in infants and young children. Neem oil should not be consumed alone without any other solutions, particularly by pregnant women, women trying to conceive or children. It can also be associated with allergic contact dermatitis.

<doc id="1010711" wikidata="Q7866925" url="?curid=1010711" title="USRowing">
<text>The United States Rowing Association, commonly known as USRowing, is the national governing body for the sport of Rowing in the United States. It serves to promote the sport on all levels of competition, including the selection and training of those athletes who represent the US at international level.

In 1982, the United States Rowing Association was formed by the merger of the National Association of Amateur Oarsmen, founded in 1872, and the National Women&#x27;s Rowing Association, established in the early 1960s. In 1985, the organization moved from Philadelphia to Indianapolis, home of several other Olympic sport governing bodies. In 1994, Indianapolis became the only U.S. city to host a world rowing championship. In 2006, USRowing moved its corporate headquarters to Princeton, N.J., home of the USRowing National Team Training Center.

USRowing registers more than 185 regattas across the country each year, ensuring they are run under specific safety guidelines. The association also provides programs to educate referees and coaches.
USRowing also runs several regattas, including the USRowing National Championships, regional and national championships for masters and youth athletes, and the USRowing Indoor National Championships in partnership with the CRASH-B Sprints.

USRowing is also responsible for national team selection, and runs events to identify and select national team athletes including the National Selection Regatta and olympic trials.

USRowing is a member of the United States Olympic Committee and the International Rowing Federation.

== Membership ==
USRowing offers both individual and organizational membership opportunities. With more than 14,000 individual members and 1,050 organizational members, USRowing membership is at the core of its mission.

USRowing individual membership offers opportunities to race in USRowing&#x27;s national and regional regattas, eligibility to compete in U.S. National Team qualifying events and eligibility to participate in national team testing. Membership also includes insurance coverage, help in locating clubs across the nation, access to USRowing&#x27;s resource library of more than 700 articles, eligibility to attend the USRowing Annual Convention, eligibility to participate in the coaching education program and much more.

== National Teams ==

USRowing&#x27;s Senior National Team represents the U.S. at the highest level of competition, either at the Olympic Games or the World Championships. While the Summer Olympics are held once every four years, the world championships are held every year. There are 22 world championship&#x27;s events and only 14 Olympic events. In Olympic years, the Games serve as the world championships for those 14 events, while the other eight events have their own world championships held in conjunction with the Junior World Championships. Athletes on the Senior National Teams are chosen from both a selection camp and trials process, depending on the boat category.

USRowing&#x27;s Under 23 National Team competes at the World Rowing Under 23 Championships each year. This developmental team has placed numerous athletes on the world championships and Olympic squads. Athletes on the Under 23 squad are chosen from both a selection camp and trials process, depending on the boat category.

USRowing also fields a Junior National Team that competes at the World Rowing Junior Championships each year. Junior national team athletes are chosen from both a selection camp and trials process, depending on the boat category.

== Events ==
USRowing hosts five national championships regattas – USRowing Indoor National Championships, USRowing Summer National Championships, USRowing Summer Youth National Championships, USRowing Youth National Championships and USRowing Masters National Championships.

In addition, USRowing hosts national team selection events for the Senior, Under 23 and Junior National Teams. USRowing also hosts several regional regattas for youth and masters athletes.

In addition, USRowing hosts several national team selection events each year. The National Selection Regattas are the initial step in the senior national team selection process. USRowing also holds National Team Trials to select certain boat categories for the Junior, Under 23 and Senior National Teams.

==Classifications and masters handicaps==
In the &quot;Rules of Rowing,&quot; USRowing sets classifications for competitors by age, skill, and sets handicaps by age for masters rowers.

Classifications by skill include:
*Elite: National Team athletes or medalists at the World Rowing U23 Championships
*Senior: Non-elite rowers who have won in the Intermediate or Senior category at the USRowing National Championships or Royal Canadian Henley Regatta
*Intermediate: Athletes who are not Senior or Elite

USRowing classifications by age are based on the calendar year in which an athlete&#x27;s birthday occurs for a given category. So for the U19 category, the athlete may compete in the category until December 31 of the year of their 18th birthday. The Rules of Rowing contain categories for U23, U21, U19, U17, and U15. Athletes may compete in &quot;youth&quot; categories until the year they turn 19, or are no longer seeking a secondary school diploma.

After the year in which athletes turn 21, they are considered &quot;masters&quot; athletes. USRowing rules include 11 age-based masters categories and handicaps for each category, representing time that may be subtracted from the crew&#x27;s finish time. The average age is used for the crew.

== Coaching education ==
USRowing offers three levels of coaching certification, an annual convention and other continuing education opportunities.

The USRowing Coaching Education Certification Program is designed to help coaches get the information they need to run a safe and successful program. The Initiation Level (Level I) is designed for someone who has never coached rowing before, the Foundation Level (Level II) is for a coach with about one year&#x27;s experience and the Intermediate Level (Level III) is for the new varsity coach or an assistant with five years of experience.

For coaches whose experience goes beyond what is offered in the certification program, USRowing offers the Advanced Coaches Series at the USRowing Annual Convention. This program brings together expert speakers from around the rowing world, as well as other sports-related disciplines.

Continuing education clinics are presentations designed by the USRowing staff and a local host organization. USRowing works with the local host organizations to provide information on topics of their interest. The continuing education clinics are not &quot;certification clinics&quot; but can be used as continuing education credits.

This definition is valid for any function, but most used for convex functions. A proper convex function is closed if and only if it is lower semi-continuous.

==Properties==

* If formula_1 is a continuous function and formula_7 is closed, then formula_8 is closed.
* If formula_9 is a continuous function and formula_7 is open, then formula_5 is closed if and only if it converges to formula_12 along every sequence converging to a boundary point of formula_7.
* A closed proper convex function &quot;f&quot; is the pointwise supremum of the collection of all affine functions &quot;h&quot; such that &quot;h&quot; ≤ &quot;f&quot; (called the affine minorants of &quot;f&quot;).

<text>Historically, English [[rugby league]] clubs competed for the Lancashire Cup and the Yorkshire Cup, known collectively as the county cups. The leading rugby clubs in Yorkshire had played in a cup competition (affectionately known as &quot;t’owd tin pot&quot;) for several years prior to the schism of 1895. However, the Lancashire authorities had refused to sanction a similar tournament, fearing it would lead to professionalism.

After the split, the replacement for the Yorkshire Cup was not immediately introduced; however, new Yorkshire and Lancashire Cups were introduced in the 1905–06 season.

The county cups were played on the same basis as the Challenge Cup, with an open draw and straight knock-out matches leading to a final.

The county cups were abandoned in 1993 due to the more successful clubs complaining about overloaded fixtures, but the Yorkshire Cup was revived in 2019.

== Lancashire Cup ==
== Yorkshire Cup ==
== TV coverage ==
The BBC regularly televised both the Lancashire and Yorkshire Cup finals from 1958–59 to 1984–85 usually as part of the &quot;Grandstand&quot; programme but after 1984–85 the BBC dropped the county cups from its Rugby League coverage due to cutbacks. But from 1987–88 to 1990–91 both the Lancashire and Yorkshire Cup finals were televised by ITV in their respective regions. In 1987–88, 1988–89, 1989–90 and 1990–91 Yorkshire Television through their Scrumdown programme with live coverage. The Lancashire Cup final was televised by Granada in 1989–90 and 1990–91 under the Rugby League Live name again with live coverage. The 1991–92 Lancashire and Yorkshire Cup finals were both shown by British Aerospace Sportscast the Yorkshire Cup Final was live but the Lancashire Cup Final was recorded and shown on the Monday Night. But the last finals in 1992–93 were not shown on TV. The 1985–86 and 1986–87 Yorkshire Cup finals and the Lancashire Cup finals in 1985–86, 1986–87, 1987–88 and 1988–89 also had no TV coverage. The 1965–66 and 1968–69 Lancashire Cup finals were played on a Friday night and likely to have been recorded by the BBC and shown on &quot;Grandstand&quot; the following day.

<text>John Cargill (1821 – 2 January 1898) was a New Zealand politician and .

==Early life==
Cargill was born in 1821; he was the son of William Cargill, one of Otago&#x27;s most prominent settlers. Edward Cargill was a younger brother. John Cargill served in the Royal Navy, and he served in the West Indies on &quot;Ringdove&quot; and . He retired from the navy in 1840 and by 1841, he came to Tasmania and then Port Phillip. He visited the Pacific Islands and settled in Ceylon where he had a coffee plantation. He was asked by his father to help with preparations for the Otago emigration scheme and returned to England in 1846. On 24 November 1847, the Cargill family sailed for New Zealand on the ship , arriving at what is now Port Chalmers, Otago on 23 March 1848.

==New Zealand==
John Cargill took up a sheep run at the Coast where the Tokomairaro River flows into the Pacific Ocean at Toko Mouth. He then had sheep runs at Mount Stuart, a locality inland from Milton. He later owned the Teviot run with his son-in-law where they had 55,000 merino, and a further run at Gladfield in South Otago.



He was elected to the 1st New Zealand Parliament as a representative of the Dunedin Country electorate, which covered rural Otago, Southland, and Fiordland. He was re-elected for the 2nd Parliament, serving alongside his father. The house had not been convened in 1857 and Cargill Jr. placed an advertisement in the &quot;Otago Witness&quot; on 12 September 1857, announcing his intention of handing in his resignation. The resignation became effective when the house next met later in 1858.

He later served in the 4th Parliament, representing the electorate of Bruce (which had been formed out of Dunedin Country), until he resigned in 1870. He was one of five candidates in the 1871 Roslyn by-election and came third. He also participated in Otago Provincial politics.

==British Columbia==
After running into financial difficulties, Cargill left New Zealand for England in 1884, and went on to British Columbia about three years later. He died in the Okanagan district of British Columbia on 2 January 1898. He is buried in the Armstrong Pioneer Cemetery just north of Vernon, British Columbia, Canada.

==Family==
Cargill married twice. Firstly in 1849, he married Sarah Charity Jones, the daughter of John Jones. They had four daughters and two sons. One daughter married John Harris, a son of John Hyde Harris. His youngest daughter and his two sons also went to British Columbia. His first wife died on 27 January 1866 at their home in Green Island.

On 1 September 1869, Cargill married Kate Featherston at St. Paul&#x27;s cathedral in Wellington. She was the third daughter of Isaac Earl Featherston, his fellow member of parliament and Superintendent of Wellington Province. They had three children, of whom two sons survived their childhood.

<doc id="1010717" wikidata="Q7270119" url="?curid=1010717" title="Queen's Theatre, Dublin">
<text>The Queen&#x27;s Theatre, Dublin, located in Pearse Street was originally built in 1829 as the Adelphi Theatre. This building was demolished in 1844 and rebuilt. It reopened that same year as the Queens Royal Theatre, the new owner having been granted a Royal Patent to operate as a patent theatre. The theatre quickly became known as simply the Queen&#x27;s.

It was most famous in the 20th century as the home of the Happy Gang, a troupe of comics, singers and musicians including Danny Cummins, Jimmy Harvey, Mick Eustace and Cecil Nash. The regular members of the &quot;gang&quot; took part in sketches as required, but in addition each had to be a solo performer in his own right.

== Suspected political associations ==
During the War of Independence, popular Queen&#x27;s Theatre manager John Lawrence Christopher &quot;Jack&quot; Sullivan made headlines across Ireland when he was arrested by the military in the early hours of Thursday, 14 October 1920 on suspicion of Sinn Fein membership in the weeks leading up to Bloody Sunday.

Sullivan had been assistant manager for many years but only weeks earlier had replaced Charlie Wright as manager.

The British military broke open the back door of his home at 28 Lower Mount St sometime after 1am.

Upholstered chairs were ripped open, pictures dismantled, and doors were torn off two cabinets, and papers examined in a &#x27;long thorough search&#x27; of Sullivan&#x27;s home, in the dark, as the gas meter was broken.

The military surrounded and raided houses number 28, 29, and 30, which belonged to Sullivan&#x27;s mother-in-law Margaret O&#x27;Mara nee Cronan.

Sullivan was taken onto Lower Mount St in his night attire and questioned about Sinn Fein battalion membership, along with a Queen&#x27;s actor who rented a room upstairs, J Clancy.

Sullivan, and a 17-year-old student lodger named Mr Herriott from Nenagh at number 29, was arrested under the defence of the realm regulations by General Boyd and taken to Ship St Barracks at Dublin Castle.

It is believed he was released without charge the following day.

Neither had any connection with politics, &#x27;and their arrests have occasioned much surprise&#x27;.

A month later, six doors up, British Army Intelligence Officer Lieutenant Henry Angliss (cover name &#x27;Patrick McMahon&#x27;,) was shot by the IRA at 22 Lower Mount Street on Bloody Sunday.

The military returned to number 30 the following Monday night and arrested Sullivan&#x27;s brother-in-law William Frances O&#x27;Mara, but it&#x27;s not believed any charges were laid.

Sullivan resigned in 1924 to pursue other theatrical enterprises.

== Union controversy ==
Eleven men were brought before the Dublin District Court and bound to six months of good behaviour, and banned from picketing the Queens Theatre, after they were charged with illegal picketing in late 1924.

It was a muscle-flexing exercise by trade unionist James Larkin and his new Worker&#x27;s Union of Ireland, following the theatre&#x27;s ownership change the previous week.

Larkin had just been released from Sing Sing and had returned to Ireland the previous year, and had fallen out of favour with his former union, the ITGWU. 

== Final days ==
The Abbey Theatre took over the building after the Abbey fire of 1951 and remained until July 1966. The lease was then put up for sale. Trinity College Dublin were the ground landlords, but the Department of Education refused to grant them the funds to purchase the building. The lease was purchased by Herbert McNally, who was involved in the cinema business. He attempted to secure planning permission to build a office block, and when this was refused he sold it to George Colley. The theatre closed in 1969 and was demolished in 1975.

The new building, Áras An Phiarsaigh, was built on the site.

<doc id="1010724" wikidata="Q140599" url="?curid=1010724" title="Bartonella henselae">
<text>Bartonella henselae, formerly Rochalimæa henselae, is a bacterium that is the causative agent of cat-scratch disease (bartonellosis).

&quot;Bartonella henselae&quot; is a member of the genus &quot;Bartonella&quot;, one of the most common types of bacteria in the world. It is a facultative intracellular microbe that targets red blood cells. In the United States, about 20,000 cases are diagnosed each year, most under 15 years old. Most often, it is transmitted by scratches or bites from kittens.

==History==
The specific name &quot;henselae&quot; honors Diane Marie Hensel (b. 1953), a clinical microbiology technologist at University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, who collected numerous strains and samples of the infective agent during an outbreak in Oklahoma in 1985.

==Etiology==
One study showed &quot;Bartonella henselae&quot; invaded the mature blood cells of humans. It infects the host cell by sticking to it using trimeric autotransporter adhesins. 

==Diagnosis==
&quot;Bartonella henselae&quot; is a Gram-negative rod. It can be cultured in a lysis-centrifugation blood culture. The presence of bacteria can be detected by Warthin-Starry stain, or by a similar silver stain technique performed on infected tissue. A pan-Bartonella PCR detection is non-invasive and uses blood or biopsies to diagnose.

==Symptoms==
&quot;Bartonella henselae&quot; infection can appear up to 10 days after exposure to the microbe. Symptoms start with a papule at the site the microbe entered, followed by lymphadenopathy, usually in the axillary node. Half of patients also get aches, nausea, abdominal pain, and malaise. Many other complications can arise from this infection beyond the typical fever, lymphadenopathy, and general malaise. Immunocompromised people or patients who already have other conditions are at greater risk for further complications. Some cases have been found in children who had previous heart-valve disease; these children got endocarditis from &quot;B. henselae&quot; infection. Some patients had hepatosplenic involvement, myalgia, and arthritis after exposure to &quot;B. henselae&quot;. In rare cases, osteomyelitis, an infection in the bone, can be a manifestation of &quot;B. henselae&quot;.

==Treatment==
No definite treatment regimen is known for a patient infected with &quot;B. henselae&quot;. Treatment depends on the wide range of symptoms that present. In most cases, it will resolve on its own in four to six weeks. Aminoglycosides in laboratory tests showed some bactericidal activity. Bacteriostatic antibiotics are not able to easily get through to intracellular &quot;Bartonella&quot;, so they are not recommended. In immunocompromised patients, pain medication is often prescribed. Nodes may need to be aspirated if painful, microabscesses often form, the abscess needs to be aspirated in many places to remove all the exudate. Because of chronic sinus tract formation risks, the nodes should not be incised to be drained. Azithromycin can be used for lymphadenopathy, which is enlarged or swollen lymph nodes.

<text>Lymphadenopathy or adenopathy is a disease of the lymph nodes, in which they are abnormal in size or consistency. Lymphadenopathy of an inflammatory type (the most common type) is lymphadenitis, producing swollen or enlarged lymph nodes. In clinical practice, the distinction between lymphadenopathy and lymphadenitis is rarely made and the words are usually treated as synonymous. Inflammation of the lymphatic vessels is known as lymphangitis. Infectious lymphadenitis affecting lymph nodes in the neck is often called scrofula.

Lymphadenopathy is a common and nonspecific sign. Common causes include infections (from minor causes such as the common cold and post-vaccination swelling to serious ones such as HIV/AIDS), autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Lymphadenopathy is frequently idiopathic and self-limiting.

==Causes==

Lymph node enlargement is recognized as a common sign of infectious, autoimmune, or malignant disease. Examples may include:
* Reactive: acute infection (e.g., bacterial, or viral), or chronic infections (tuberculous lymphadenitis, cat-scratch disease).
** The most distinctive sign of bubonic plague is extreme swelling of one or more lymph nodes that bulge out of the skin as &quot;buboes&quot;. The buboes often become necrotic and may even rupture.
** Infectious mononucleosis is an acute viral infection usually caused by Epstein-Barr virus and may be characterized by a marked enlargement of the cervical lymph nodes.
** It is also a sign of cutaneous anthrax and human African trypanosomiasis
** Toxoplasmosis, a parasitic disease, gives a generalized lymphadenopathy (&quot;Piringer-Kuchinka lymphadenopathy&quot;).
** Plasma cell variant of Castleman&#x27;s disease - associated with HHV-8 infection and HIV infection
** Mesenteric lymphadenitis after viral systemic infection (particularly in the GALT in the appendix) can commonly present like appendicitis.
Infectious causes of lymphadenopathy may include bacterial infections such as cat scratch disease, tularemia, brucellosis, or prevotella, as well as fungal infections such as paracoccidioidomycosis.
* Tumoral:
** Primary: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma give lymphadenopathy in all or a few lymph nodes.
** Secondary: metastasis, Virchow&#x27;s node, neuroblastoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
* Autoimmune: systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis may have a generalized lymphadenopathy.
* Immunocompromised: AIDS. Generalized lymphadenopathy is an early sign of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). &quot;Lymphadenopathy syndrome&quot; has been used to describe the first symptomatic stage of HIV progression, preceding a diagnosis of AIDS.
* Bites from certain venomous snakes such as the pit viper
* Unknown: Kikuchi disease, progressive transformation of germinal centers, sarcoidosis, hyaline-vascular variant of Castleman&#x27;s disease, Rosai-Dorfman disease, Kawasaki disease, Kimura disease

===Benign (reactive) lymphadenopathy===
 lymphadenopathy is a common biopsy finding, and may often be confused with malignant lymphoma. It may be separated into major morphologic patterns, each with its own differential diagnosis with certain types of lymphoma. Most cases of reactive follicular hyperplasia are easy to diagnose, but some cases may be confused with follicular lymphoma. There are seven distinct patterns of benign lymphadenopathy:
* Follicular hyperplasia: This is the most common type of reactive lymphadenopathy.
* Paracortical hyperplasia/Interfollicular hyperplasia: It is seen in viral infections, skin diseases, and nonspecific reactions.
* Sinus histiocytosis: It is seen in lymph nodes draining limbs, inflammatory lesions, and malignancies.
* Nodal extensive necrosis
* Nodal granulomatous inflammation
* Nodal extensive fibrosis (Connective tissue framework)
* Nodal deposition of interstitial substance

These morphological patterns are never pure. Thus, reactive follicular hyperplasia can have a component of paracortical hyperplasia. However, this distinction is important for the differential diagnosis of the cause.

==Diagnosis==

In cervical lymphadenopathy (of the neck), it is routine to perform a throat examination including the use of a mirror and an endoscope.

On ultrasound, B-mode imaging depicts lymph node morphology, whilst power Doppler can assess the vascular pattern. B-mode imaging features that can distinguish metastasis and lymphoma include size, shape, calcification, loss of hilar architecture, as well as intranodal necrosis. Soft tissue edema and nodal matting on B-mode imaging suggests tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis or previous radiation therapy. Serial monitoring of nodal size and vascularity are useful in assessing treatment response.

Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) has sensitivity and specificity percentages of 81% and 100%, respectively, in the histopathology of malignant cervical lymphadenopathy. PET-CT has proven to be helpful in identifying occult primary carcinomas of the head and neck, especially when applied as a guiding tool prior to panendoscopy, and may induce treatment related clinical decisions in up to 60% of cases.

===Classification===
Lymphadenopathy may be classified by:
* Size, where lymphadenopathy in adults is often defined as a short axis of one or more lymph nodes is greater than 10mm.
* By extent:
** &quot;Localized lymphadenopathy&quot;: due to localized spot of infection; e.g., an infected spot on the scalp will cause lymph nodes in the neck on that same side to swell up

** Generalized lymphadenopathy: due to a systemic infection of the body; e.g., influenza or secondary syphilis
*** Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL): persisting for a long time, possibly without an apparent cause
* By localization:
** Hilar lymphadenopathy.
** Mediastinal lymphadenopathy
** Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy
* Dermatopathic lymphadenopathy: lymphadenopathy associated with skin disease.
* By malignancy: Benign lymphadenopathy is distinguished from malignant types which mainly refer to lymphomas or lymph node metastasis.

====Size====
* By size, where lymphadenopathy in adults is often defined as a short axis of one or more lymph nodes is greater than 10mm. However, there is regional variation as detailed in this table:
Lymphadenopathy of the axillary lymph nodes can be defined as solid nodes measuring more than 15 mm without fatty hilum. Axillary lymph nodes may be normal up to 30 mm if consisting largely of fat.

In children, a short axis of 8 mm can be used. However, inguinal lymph nodes of up to 15 mm and cervical lymph nodes of up to 20 mm are generally normal in children up to age 8–12.

Lymphadenopathy of more than 1.5–2 cm increases the risk of cancer or granulomatous disease as the cause rather than only inflammation or infection. Still, an increasing size and persistence over time are more indicative of cancer.

<text>William Oldfield Cautley (1822 – 17 February 1864) was a New Zealand settler and politician.

==Early life and family==
Cautley was born in the English county of Buckinghamshire in 1822, the son of the Reverend Richard Cautley. He was educated at Uppingham School from 1837 to 1840, where he was an exhibitioner on leaving, and then matriculated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge in the Michaelmas term, 1840.

However, in September 1841 he sailed from West India Docks on the &quot;Mary Ann&quot;, bound for the New Zealand Company&#x27;s new settlement of Nelson, landing there on 8 February 1842. He began farming a property known as &quot;Wensley Hill&quot; at Waimea East (now called Richmond).

In September 1842 Cautley was appointed as the Nelson postmaster and clerk to magistrates, and in 1848 he was appointed a Justice of the Peace for the province of New Munster.

==Political career==

In 1850, Cautley was appointed as a member of the short-lived Legislative Council of the province of New Munster.

In the 1853 general election, Cautley was elected as representative for the Waimea electorate alongside David Monro. The first session of the 1st New Zealand Parliament started on 24 May 1854, and Cautley resigned his seat on 26 May 1854. He did not serve in any further Parliaments.

In November 1854, Cautley was elected as a member for Waimea East on the Nelson Provincial Council following the death of sitting member Francis Otterson. Cautley defeated Stephen Lunn Müller by 54 votes to 40.

==Later life==
Cautley died in London on 17 February 1864, after a long illness.

==Early life and career==
Crompton was born in Birmingham, England, in 1811, and received his education at an academy in Bristol run by Lant Carpenter. Crompton&#x27;s father was a merchant trading with Brazil. He lived in northern France for some years and held a scholastic appointment. During this time, he took on the Catholic faith. He emigrated from England on the &quot;Lord William Bentinck&quot; and arrived in New Plymouth on 6 January 1852, and took land in nearby Omata. Later in 1852, he was the &quot;Taranaki Herald&quot;&#x27;s first editor, but resigned after nine editions had been printed over a disagreement with the owners of the newspaper.

==Member of Parliament==
Crompton served in the 1st New Zealand Parliament as the representative for the Omata electorate. In the , he was declared elected unopposed. He was ill in 1855 and initially feared that he could not attend the parliamentary session in Auckland, but he did go in the end. His ongoing illness prevented him from declaring his intentions prior to the and when it appeared that the Omata electorate would not have a representative, Alfred William East stepped forward and became a candidate. In the end, the election was contested by Crompton, but East had a majority of six votes. Crompton did not serve in any further Parliaments.

==Later career==
He was later a member of the Taranaki Provincial Council and continuously represented the Omata electorate from January 1862 until the abolition of provincial government in October 1876. He was Deputy Superintend of Taranaki Province on three occasions: in 1863–64 under Charles Brown, in 1870–74 under Frederic Carrington, and from June 1876 once again under Carrington. He was the council&#x27;s speaker from August 1862 until abolition 14 years later. As a member of the Taranaki Waste Lands Board, he oversaw the establishment of towns in Taranaki including Inglewood, which he had tried to name after the poet Milton, and Stratford-upon-Patea (later renamed simply Stratford), after Stratford-upon-Avon, the birthplace of William Shakespeare.

His house and property were destroyed in the First Taranaki War. After the Second Taranaki War was over, Crompton opened an academy in New Plymouth and ran it until 1884, when he retired for health reasons. He was a member of many organisations and was for many years Deputy Sheriff. He was an active member of the Catholic church.

==Death==
Crompton was affected by a paralytic stroke for the last two years of his life. He died on 27 December 1886 and was survived by his wife, two daughters, and one son. He was buried at Te Henui Cemetery.

<doc id="1010736" wikidata="Q2084109" url="?curid=1010736" title="Indonesian Democratic Party">
<text>The Indonesian Democratic Party (, PDI) was a political party in Indonesia which existed from 1973 to 2003. During the New Order era, the PDI was one of the two state-approved parties, the other being the Islam-based United Development Party (PPP).

==Origins==
Ten political parties participated in the 1971 legislative elections, a number that President Suharto considered to be too much. Suharto wished that political parties be reduced to just two or three and that the parties should be grouped based on their programs. The electoral system itself already limits the electoral field by eliminating independent candidates and requiring that each party has at least 20 percent of seats in the DPR.

The basis for the merger that would result in the birth of PDI was a coalition of the five Nationalist and non-Islamic Parties in the People&#x27;s Representative Council (DPR) called the Democracy Development Faction. This faction consisted of the Indonesian National Party (PNI), the League of Supporters of Indonesian Independence (IPKI), Murba Party (&quot;Partai Murba&quot;), the Indonesian Christian Party (&quot;Parkindo&quot;), Catholic Party (&quot;Partai Katolik&quot;).

On 10 January 1973, as part of Suharto&#x27;s program to reduce political parties, these five parties were merged to form PDI.

==Factions==
The PNI, the largest of the PDI&#x27;s five parties, and the legatee of Sukarno, had its base in East and Central Java. IPKI had been strongly anti-PKI in the Old Order in contrast to the once-leftist Partai Murba. Even more heterogeneous than the United Development Party (PPP), the PDI, with no common ideological link other than the commitment to the Pancasila as its sole principle, was faction-ridden and riven with personality disputes.

This factionalism was displayed in the 1977 Indonesian legislative election, the first Legislative Elections that PDI participated in. The Party was unable to show a united front and would come 
third and last in the 1977 legislative election.

==Government intervention==
The 1977 legislative election would also see a tense political battle between Golkar and PPP. The government became worried that with PDI struggling to function as a party, Indonesian society would be polarized into a secular camp (Golkar) and an Islamic camp (PPP). To counter this, the Government decided to actively intervene into PDI&#x27;s affairs and make it into a 3rd party to prevent the polarization that it feared.

Measures were taken by the government to keep PDI going as a party which at one time involved the Minister of Home Affairs to arrange PDI&#x27;s Congresses for them. Efforts were also made to encourage PDI, such as refurbishing the tomb of the late President Sukarno in 1978 and officially recognizing him as the &quot;Hero of Independence Proclamation&quot;. This recognition of Sukarno was a change from the earlier New Order policy of playing down his achievements or ignoring him altogether.

==PDI in New Order==
Until Suharto&#x27;s fall in 1998, PDI was the smallest political party in Indonesia. Despite playing up its Sukarnoist heritage when campaigning, PDI continued to come last in the legislative elections.

==Schism with Megawati Sukarnoputri==
At the 1993 National Congress, Megawati Sukarnoputri was elected as the Chairperson of PDI to replace Suryadi. The government refused to recognize this and continued to push for Budi Harjono, their candidate for the Chairpersonship to be elected. A Special Congress was held where the Government expected to have Harjono elected, but Megawati once again emerged victorious. The victory was consolidated when a PDI National Assembly ratified the results of the Congress.

In June 1996, the government finally made its move. Another National Congress was held in Medan, where Megawati was not invited to come along and attended by anti-Megawati members. With the Government&#x27;s backing, Suryadi was re-elected as PDI&#x27;s Chairperson. Megawati refused to acknowledge the results of this congress and continued to see herself as the rightful leader of PDI.

Suryadi began threatening to take back PDI&#x27;s Headquarters in Jakarta. This threat came true during the morning of 27 July 1996. That morning, Suryadi&#x27;s supporters (reportedly with the government&#x27;s backing) attacked the PDI Headquarters and faced resistance from Megawati supporters who had been stationed there ever since the National Congress in Medan. In the ensuing fight, Megawati&#x27;s supporters managed to hold on to the headquarters.

A riot then ensued, followed by a crackdown by the government. The government would later blame the riots on the People&#x27;s Democratic Party.

PDI was now divided into two factions, Megawati&#x27;s faction and Suryadi&#x27;s faction. In the 1997 Indonesian legislative election, Mega and her faction threw their votes behind PPP while PDI languished with only 3% of the votes.

In October 1998, after Suharto&#x27;s fall, Megawati declared the formation of Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) to differentiate her faction of PDI from the government-backed one.

==1999 legislative elections and aftermath==
PDI participated in the 1999 legislative election and won two seats, but refused to ratify the election results. This was not enough to pass the electoral threshold to allow the party to participate in the following elections in 2004. After failing to join with other parties to reach the threshold, the party renamed itself the Indonesian Democratic Vanguard Party.

<doc id="1010738" wikidata="Q7760013" url="?curid=1010738" title="The Reels">
<text>The Reels are an Australian rock band which formed in Dubbo, New South Wales in 1976. It disbanded in 1991, and reformed in 2007. Its 1981 song &quot;Quasimodo&#x27;s Dream&quot; was voted one of the top 10 Australian songs of all time by a 100-member panel from Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) in 2001. The Reels had top 10 Australian singles chart successes with covers of Herb Alpert&#x27;s &quot;This Guy&#x27;s in Love with You&quot; (No. 7, 1982) and Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; (No. 11, 1986). Rock music historian Ian McFarlane described the group as &quot;one of the most original and invigorating pop bands to emerge from the Australian new wave movement of the late 1970s.&quot;

==Career==
===1976–1980: Early years===
Native Sons, consisting of John Bliss on drums, Craig Hooper on lead guitar and synthesiser, and Dave Mason on vocals, formed in the regional centre of Dubbo, New South Wales in 1976. Mason is the son of NSW parliamentarian, John Mason, who was the state&#x27;s Liberal Party leader during 1978–1981. Colin (Polly) Newham (keyboards/brass) from Orange, N.S.W. joined in 1977.

Native Sons played in the Dubbo/Orange/Newcastle area for two years, with a repertoire of cover versions and original songs. After moving to Sydney in 1978, the band added Paul Abrahams on bass guitar and changed its name to The Brucelanders. It developed an original repertoire of fast-paced, quirky pop and ska, and its energetic performances gained it a following on the east coast live music scene. It was given support in Sydney by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) rock radio station Double J, which continued when the station moved to the FM band in 1980 and became Triple J.

By 1979, the Brucelanders had secured a recording contract with the Australian branch of Mercury Records and changed its name to the Reels, with the line-up of Abrahams, Bliss, Hooper, Mason and Newham. It released its debut single, &quot;Love Will Find a Way&quot; in October, which entered the top 40 of the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart. The group&#x27;s self-titled debut album was produced by Mark Opitz (the Angels, Cold Chisel) and appeared in November, as did a second single, &quot;Prefab Heart&quot;. The group&#x27;s distinctive image meant it gained increasing attention with music videos featured on the influential national ABC TV pop show &quot;Countdown&quot;.

In July 1980, the Reels added a sixth member, also a synthesiser player, Karen Ansel, a former member of Melbourne group the Romantics. This new line-up released a third single, &quot;After the News&quot;. It marked a transition in the Reels&#x27; music – the group minimised guitars instead utilising synthesisers as its main instruments. The Reels were one of the first groups to use headsets instead of traditional microphones.

During late July, the group undertook the innovative Reels By Rail Tour, using rail transport to destinations in the eastern states. At the end of the year, returning to its covers band origins, The Reels released a five-track Christmas EP, &quot;Five Great Gift Ideas from The Reels&quot;, produced by Bruce Brown and Russell Dunlop, which included Jim Reeves&#x27; &quot;According to My Heart&quot; and Freda Payne&#x27;s &quot;Band of Gold&quot;. &quot;According to My Heart&quot; was accompanied by a folksy music video filmed at a farm in New Zealand. The EP included one original, &quot;The Bombs Dropped on Xmas&quot;, co-written by band members Mason, Newham and Ansel with Pamela Shalvey.

===1981: &quot;Quasimodo&#x27;s Dream&quot;===
In May 1981, The Reels released the single &quot;Shout and Deliver&quot; as a precursor to the album considered by many to be its best work, &quot;Quasimodo&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Here The Reels displayed an impressive maturity in song writing, backed with strong performances, inventive arrangements and top-class production. It peaked at No. 27 in June. The album&#x27;s title track was released as a single but, although widely considered to be one of the best Australian singles of that period, it failed to chart. The band undertook the Kitchen Man Tour, which saw the stage dressed as a fully equipped Australian kitchen.

The Reels&#x27; lack of top 10 mainstream commercial success was at odds with their strong live following, but it was due in part to the restrictive programming on commercial radio at that time, which gave little exposure to local &quot;new wave&quot; acts. The group&#x27;s deteriorating relationship with Mercury was also a factor, as evidenced by the album&#x27;s track listing: it included the earlier hit &quot;According to My Heart&quot;, but a disclaimer printed on the sleeve noted that it had been included at the insistence of the record company (i.e. against the band&#x27;s wishes).

Internal tensions were also a factor in the group&#x27;s career vicissitudes. Bliss left just after the recording of the album, to be replaced by Stefan Fidock (who had played with Ansel in the Romantics). The new five-piece lineup promoted the album with the Kitchen Man Tour, after which Ansel, Newham then Abrahams left the band. Now reduced to a trio (Mason, Hooper and Fidock) The Reels continued performing by augmenting their live sound with taped backing tracks, and used the new Fairlight synthesiser for studio recordings.

===1982–1985: &quot;Beautiful&quot; ===
In late 1982, having signed a new contract with the RCA Records label, The Reels recorded the &quot;Beautiful&quot; album, mainly covering middle of the road classics with a synthesiser feel. The Reels persuaded RCA to allow a &quot;Beautiful&quot; &quot;Limited Collectors Edition&quot; to be released by K-tel, known for its licensed pop hit compilations and budget &#x27;golden oldies&#x27;. At the time K-tel advertised extensively on Australian TV and was widely regarded as the antithesis of credible music. To emphasise the point, &quot;Beautiful&quot; was released with &quot;bad taste&quot; artwork that matched the K-tel aesthetic. Although the tracks on &quot;Beautiful&quot; walked a fine line between sincere tribute and gentle parody, it proved to be the biggest success of their career, selling in excess of 40,000 copies and reaching No. 32 on the album chart, as well as being certified gold. A single taken from it, a cover of the Burt Bacharach-Hal David song &quot;This Guy&#x27;s in Love With You&quot; gave the Reels their biggest hit in Australia, peaking at number 7 around November 1982. The album was later re-released through RCA.

In 1983, the band released a five-track EP of original songs, &quot;Pitt Street Farmers&quot; (the title is an old Sydney satirical expression referring to wealthy owners of rural land who never leave the city). This was followed by a new version of &quot;Quasimodo&#x27;s Dream&quot; in December 1983, which also failed to chart on its second release. At this point Mason was forced to give up performing after contracting hepatitis, which effectively ended the group. Hooper joined the Church as keyboard player, and later joined the Mullanes, the original incarnation of Crowded House, and Fidock returned to Melbourne, joining the Sacred Cowboys.

By late 1985, Mason had recovered and the Reels was revived (with the line-up of Mason, Hooper, Bliss and Newham) and completed its commitments to RCA with a single, a cover version of Etta James&#x27;s &quot;It Must Be Love&quot;.

===1986–1988: Later years===
The band then signed with Regular Records and released a radically slowed-down, synthesiser-driven version of Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot;. It proved to be another hit, reaching No. 11 (October 1986); the arrangement featuring prominent use of the Vocoder voice synthesiser, which the band also used extensively on stage to augment Mason&#x27;s vocals. However, at the end of 1986, Bliss left the band again.

In January 1987, their next single was a cover of the Edison Lighthouse hit &quot;Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)&quot;. During that year, they embarked on the popular &quot;Reels By Request&quot; tour, where the audience was allowed to call out for the songs they wanted to hear, chosen from long printed lists. This was followed by an &#x27;all Australian songs&#x27; version of the same concept, which led to The Reels&#x27; next studio album, &quot;Neighbors&quot; - the name of which excluded the &#x27;u&#x27; which would normally be contained in the Australian English spelling. This LP contained their idiosyncratic versions of thirteen Australian rock classics, including the singles &quot;Are You Old Enough&quot; (originally a hit for Dragon) and &quot;Forever Now&quot; (by Cold Chisel). Steve Prestwich, who wrote &quot;Forever Now&quot;, played on the Reels&#x27; version. The album also featured a new version of the Reels&#x27; own song &quot;Shout and Deliver&quot;.

===1989–1992: Breakup===
In 1989, Mason appeared in the acclaimed Australian feature film &quot;Ghosts... of the Civil Dead&quot;, in which he co-starred with Nick Cave. In September 1991, The Reels issued its first original single in five years, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Love You Anymore&quot;, followed by what proved to be their last single, a remix by Filthy Lucre of &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot;. The group officially disbanded to coincide with the release of the compilation CD &quot;Requiem&quot;.

===2007–present: Comeback===
In May 2007, Dave Mason released his first solo album, &quot;Reelsville&quot;, an acoustic re-recording of Reels hits. In August 2007, &quot;Reel to Reel&quot; was also released, a compilation of the Reels classic tracks with new liner notes as written by Mason.

In May 2008, Dave Mason, John Bliss and Colin Newham reunited and played shows.

At a subsequent show (the Gaelic Club, Surry Hills; 27 September 2008), Mason announced that Newham was retiring from the band. Original bassist Abrahams then rejoined the band, after 23 years. Despite this, the Reels never got to reunite as a six-piece group.

==After the Reels==

Hooper was also a member of the Church, the Mullanes (the original incarnation of Crowded House), and also recorded with Rockmelons and Ross Wilson.

Karen Ansel retired from the music business and became a noted film and TV computer graphics specialist in the US.

Paul Abrahams also played bass in a band with Newham called Company of Strangers and was also a member of Peter Blakeley&#x27;s band, The Resurrection. In addition, he played bass for Wendy Matthews, plus drums for Ya Ya Choral, Rat Tat Tat (Peter Blakeley and Jeff Stapleton) and The Bonerattlers who were regular buskers at Paddington Markets.

Fidock joined the Sacred Cowboys in 1987. Around 2008, he established his company Fidock Drums, creating handcrafted snares and drumkits. He died from cancer in April 2020.

John Bliss co-authored the book &quot;The A to Zen of Lawn Bowls&quot; with John Salter in 1997.

David Mason appeared in the Countdown Spectacular 2 concert series in Australia between late-August and early-September 2007 as a solo performer. He sang only one song, &quot;Quasimodo&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

In 2007, Mason released a new album, &quot;Reelsville&quot; on Liberation Blue. He performed one gig to launch the album at The Basement in Sydney on 16 May 2007. A further gig was booked for the Factory Enmore Theatre in Sydney on 24 May 2008. This show became a local cause celebre when police with sniffer dogs arrested two 60-year-old punters for smoking illegal drugs.

On 26 March 2011, Mason appeared on episode 114 of &quot;RocKwiz&quot; on SBS TV. He performed &quot;Quasimodo&#x27;s Dream&quot; and ended the show in a duet with Sally Seltmann performing the Conway Twitty song &quot;As Soon as I Hang Up the Phone&quot;.

Mason, who now suffers from bipolar disorder, continues to play occasionally in three separate shows, an acoustic duo with Brendan Gallagher from Karma County and an electronic (one man show) &#x27;Dark&#x27; with visuals by artist Libby Blainey, music by Scott Saunders from Dig; both these shows are mostly interpretations of Reels songs. 2017 saw the formation of the group Sandy Shores with Mason, Gallagher, Blainey together with Lindy Morrison and Amanda Brown from the Go-Betweens playing hits from past bands but mostly new original material.

<text>William Henry Cutten (10 April 1822 – 30 June 1883) was a New Zealand politician from the Otago region.

==Biography==
Cutten was born in London in 1822. He received a good education and then studied law, which earned him a job at the department of the commissioner
of bankruptcy. At age 26, Cutten emigrated to New Zealand in 1848, arriving in Dunedin with the first settlers, including William Cargill on the &quot;John Wickliffe&quot;. Two years later, in 1850, he married Cargill&#x27;s eldest daughter, Christina Dorothea Cargill, and the couple had 11 children.

Initially in the new settlement he was an auctioneer and storekeeper, but then became an immigration agent before being appointed a lands claim commissioner and, later, chief commissioner of Crown lands.

Cutten served in the 1st New Zealand Parliament as representative for the Dunedin Country electorate –1855, but resigned before the end of his term, as he found it unsustainable to spend that much time at parliament in Auckland away from his business.

He was one of four candidates in the 1870 Caversham by-election, one of two candidates in the 1872 Caversham by-election; and came second both times. He was one of five candidates in the 1871 Roslyn by-election and came second.

He served in the 6th Parliament as a representative for Taieri from an until the end of the parliamentary term in 1879, when he retired. In the , he contested the and, of the four candidates, he came a close second against James Seaton.

He served on the Otago Provincial Council representing the Town of Dunedin electorate. He was a member of the first, second, third and sixth council, from 1853 to 1863, and from 1871 to 1873. He was on the Council&#x27;s Executive for four periods between 1854 and 1872.

He was the first editor of the &quot;Otago Witness&quot; newspaper in 1851, and in 1861 he founded the &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot; with Julius Vogel.

He died at his home in the Dunedin suburb of Anderson Bay in 1883, and was buried in the Dunedin Northern Cemetery.

<text>Giemsa stain (), named after German chemist and bacteriologist Gustav Giemsa, is a nucleic acid stain used in cytogenetics and for the histopathological diagnosis of malaria and other parasites.

==Uses==
It is specific for the phosphate groups of DNA and attaches itself to regions of DNA where there are high amounts of adenine-thymine bonding. Giemsa stain is used in Giemsa banding, commonly called G-banding, to stain chromosomes and often used to create a karyogram (chromosome map). It can identify chromosomal aberrations such as translocations and rearrangements.

It stains the trophozoite &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot;, which presents with greenish discharge and motile cells on wet prep.

Giemsa stain is also a differential stain, such as when it is combined with Wright stain to form Wright–Giemsa stain. It can be used to study the adherence of pathogenic bacteria to human cells. It differentially stains human and bacterial cells purple and pink respectively. It can be used for histopathological diagnosis of the &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species that cause malaria and some other spirochete and protozoan blood parasites. It is also used to stain &quot;Wolbachia&quot; cells in host tissue.

Giemsa stain is a classic blood film stain for peripheral blood smears and bone marrow specimens. Erythrocytes stain pink, platelets show a light pale pink, lymphocyte cytoplasm stains sky blue, monocyte cytoplasm stains pale blue, and leukocyte nuclear chromatin stains magenta. It is also used to visualize the classic &quot;safety pin&quot; shape in &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;.

Giemsa stain is also used to visualize chromosomes. This is particularly relevant for detection of Cytomegalovirus infection, where the classical finding would be an &quot;owl-eye&quot; viral inclusion.

Giemsa stains the fungus &quot;Histoplasma&quot;, &quot;Chlamydia&quot; bacteria, and can be used to identify mast cells.

==Generation==

Giemsa&#x27;s solution is a mixture of methylene blue, eosin, and Azure B. The stain is usually prepared from commercially available Giemsa powder.

A thin film of the specimen on a microscope slide is fixed in pure methanol for 30 seconds, by immersing it or by putting a few drops of methanol on the slide. The slide is immersed in a freshly prepared 5% Giemsa stain solution for 20–30 minutes (in emergencies 5–10 minutes in 10% solution can be used), then flushed with tap water and left to dry.

<text>William Field Porter (24 January 1784 – 30 March 1869) was a ship owner from Liverpool, who migrated to South Australia in 1838. He relocated to Auckland in 1841, where he became a member of the New Zealand Parliament.

==Early life==

Porter was born in London in 1784. He was orphaned by 1796 and it is likely he commenced his career at sea shortly after. His first command was , sailing in the Liverpool to Barbados trade. Her owners, Barton, Irlam and Higginson specialized in that trade. Later, in the War of 1812, &quot;Tiger&quot;, still under Porter&#x27;s command, was granted a letter of marque to operate offensively, not just defensively, against American shipping. &quot;Tiger&quot;, in company with , also a vessel that Barton, Irlam and Higginson owned, captured three American ships in 1813 as the two British ships were returning to England from Barbados.

In 1810, he married Alice Roper (1790–1862) in Liverpool, with whom he had four children. His only daughter, Alice, married fellow coastal trader John Salmon in 1853.

On 29 November 1811 Captain Porter stood trial at London for having taken on board &quot;Tiger&quot; at Carlisle Bay, Barbados, two deserters from the Royal Navy and having concealed them when the Navy sent a Lieutenant to look for them. (Apparently he had concealed more than two, but the charges only related to two.) Porter was found guilty and fined £500 and to be held at Newgate for 12 months or until he had paid his fine. It is not clear who paid the fine, if they did, and whether Porter spent any time in prison.

Porter became a prominent sea captain, operating a small fleet out of his own yard at Liverpool. Other members of the Porter family sailed for the British East India Company (e.g. his cousin, George Porter).

==Australia==
In the late 1830s he suffered substantial losses at sea, which his son said were behind his decision to migrate. Porter sold his shipyard in Liverpool and took two of his ships, &quot;Porter&quot;, and &quot;Dorset&quot;, provisioned with livestock and a range of personnel (including a doctor, tutors and servants), so that he could set up a relatively self-sufficient farming station in South Australia. He was accompanied by his wife, a son and daughter, William and Alice and an adult son Richard and his wife.

Porter himself captained his namesake, &quot;Porter&quot; (a 252-ton (bm) brig), which he had built in 1824 and which had been strengthened so that it would be fit for the hazardous voyage. Upon arrival, he used this vessel to set up a shipping service from Port Lincoln and Adelaide to and from other Australian ports. Porter also built &quot;Dorset&quot; (95 tons) in 1838, specifically as a back-up ship for the journey to Australia. This he sold upon arrival.

Porter&#x27;s expedition arrived at Adelaide in early 1839. A special survey was authorised by the Governor for Port Lincoln on the Eyre Peninsula and Porter was an investor in the survey company that took out the licence. He received land there as a consequence. The &quot;Porter&quot; moved the family to this new settlement in 1839. The &quot;Dorset&quot; by now in other ownership brought other settlers. The party was just one of three to arrive with settlers for the district in the 1830s and 1840s. It became apparent to him that Adelaide would be the main settlement in South Australia and that immediate prospects for Port Lincoln would be limited. Impatient for success, he decided to forego the significant investment and effort he had made in the fledgling settlement (e.g. building a house, establishing a bank and donating to a proposed Church of England). He abandoned the settlement in 1840. Although Porter&#x27;s tenure in Port Lincoln only lasted 18 months, he had, nevertheless, been appointed the first Magistrate of the Eyre Peninsula and his family left its name at &#x27;Porter Bay&#x27;.

==New Zealand==

In May 1841, Porter arrived in Auckland, New Zealand. He built a house and store on Auckland&#x27;s waterfront and commenced trading from there with stock brought on the &quot;Porter&quot;. He also invested in land in and around Auckland and bought interests in land claims from before 1840. Later he developed a farm at Kohimarama.

In 1841 Governor Willam Hobson appointed Porter to his first Legislative Council, a small body with only an advisory role. Here Porter was closely involved in early attempts to deal with land claims from before 1840, a central issue in the early governance of New Zealand.

Porter served in the 1st New Zealand Parliament as representative for the Suburbs of Auckland electorate from to 1855, when he retired, but did not serve in any further Parliaments. He also served on the Auckland Provincial Council. He was on the first Council of the Auckland Museum.

Porter died on 30 March 1869 at Mangatangi, Waikato.

<text>Andrew Haug&#x27;is a radio announcer and heavy metal musician from Melbourne, Australia. He is one of the most prominent figures in Australia&#x27;s largely underground heavy metal scene.

Haug started his radio career doing the heavy metal music program &quot;The Hard Report&quot; for Melbourne community radio station 3RRR. He was most notable as the presenter of the heavy metal music program &quot;Full Metal Racket&quot; (formerly &quot;3 Hours of Power&quot; and currently &quot;The Racket&quot;) on Australian alternative music radio station Triple J, which he hosted from 2001 to 2011. He has stated that he did not leave Triple J by his choosing.

Haug also plays drums with outfit Contrive, which also features his identical twin brother Paul Haug on lead vocals/guitar.

In 2002, Haug was convinced by Australian comedian John Safran to appear on his SBS television series &quot;John Safran&#x27;s Music Jamboree&quot;. His appearance involved a Christian psychic who monitored him during a radio broadcast and at a Contrive live gig, claiming she could see &quot;dark spirits&quot; who were supposedly attracted to him due to his interest in heavy metal music.

Andrew has also been a guest programmer for the ABC&#x27;s music video show &quot;Rage&quot; as well as MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;.

==Early years==
Andrew was born in Melbourne, Victoria, along with twin brother Paul.

==Career==
Haug started working in radio in 1993, with a local demo segment on Melbourne&#x27;s 3RRRFM &quot;Metal Show&quot;. Haug soon became the lead host of the show, spanning all facets of the program including interviews with several hundred local and international artists right up until leaving the station for a new opportunity.

In 2001 he became the host of Triple J&#x27;s national weekly metal program, &quot;Full Metal Racket&quot;. Over his decade-long run he conducted 612 interviews with musicians such as James Hetfield, Ozzy Osbourne, Maynard James Keenan, Ronnie James Dio, Rob Halford, and interviewed Steve Harris of Iron Maiden on board their plane, Ed Force One. Haug once convinced JJJ management to do a live seven-hour straight metal radio marathon.

In 1995 Haug co-hosted a local TV music show on Channel 31, &quot;Metal Vision&quot;. This lasted for two years and included local and international interviews with the likes of Fear Factory and Deicide, as well as general music discussion. In 2002 he hosted the long-standing national TV music show &quot;Rage&quot;, handpicking five hours of his favourite rock and metal video clips, and in 2006 hosted a four-hour special on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; dedicated to the acts on that year&#x27;s Gigantour festival.

Haug has stated that he did not leave Triple J&#x27;s The Racket voluntarily.

In June 2012 Haug revealed his plan to create a dedicated rock and metal online radio station in Australia. The station was officially launched on 20 November 2012. In 2017, the station started a partnership with platform iHeartRadio.

From 2012, Haug hosted a weekly two-hour metal show, Haugmetal for Soundwave festival&#x27;s online radio station, Soundwave Pirate Radio.

Haug has written music columns for &quot;Kerrang! Australia&quot;, Roadrunner Australia&#x27;s &quot;Outsider&quot; Magazine, plus weekly metal music columns for various street press magazines.

He was the sole label and marketing manager at the Australian branch of German-based record label Century Media (Arch Enemy, Suicide Silence, Lacuna Coil, Architects) from 1998 to 2014 full time.

Haug managed and played drums for the heavy metal band Contrive with his twin brother Paul. They released two EPs and three albums to date and toured the USA in May 2019 on a 25 Date tour with Polish progressive band Riverside. They also played in Australia with Machine Head, Opeth, Stone Sour, Coroner, Cavalera Conspiracy, Testament, Sepultura, Soilwork, Mayhem, Skinlab, and Parkway Drive.

AndrewHaug.com, now in its 11 years of broadcasting, remains the First &amp; Only 24/7 Metal Radio Station Online in Australia, where many have come after and now cease broadcasting.

2020, during the Covid pandemic, Haug, with his long-time interest in self-development, undertook 2 years of full-time study to become a life coach, to which he now operates under the banner Arise Coaching 

Haug, being an avid endurance runner on &amp; off over the years, reignited his passion for running in Oct 2019 after a 10KM fun run in Vietnam. This took his running to new heights to now doing once a week - full marathons to ultra distances of 60+KM. In June 2023, Haug did his first ever 100KM run, none of these runs completed were &#x27;official&#x27; sign-up community runs, he does them alone purely for self-growth and is now close to clocking 7000KM since Oct 2019, you can find him on Strava.

He is also plant-based Vegan since 2012 &amp; Alcohol-free since 2008.

<text>Charles John Taylor (1826 – 22 April 1897) was a New Zealand politician.

He was the second son of General Taylor (1790–1868) who owned land at west Tamaki, now absorbed into the Auckland suburban area. Charles was a judge in India before emigrating to New Zealand, and was a director of The Bank of New Zealand, of which his brother, Allan Kerr Taylor, was auditor

Charles John Taylor lived at Glen Orchard (now Saint Heliers, Auckland), and had two brothers and one half-brother who also lived in Auckland: William Innes Taylor at Glen Innes, and Richard James Taylor at Glen Dowie. The names of the latter two properties became the names of the suburbs Glen Innes and Glendowie respectively.

The half-brother, Allan Kerr Taylor, lived in Mount Albert in a house called Alberton. The Mount Albert Taylors became known as the Kerr Taylors or Kerr-Taylors – apparently adopting Allan&#x27;s middle name as part of their surname.

Charles John Taylor served in the 1st New Zealand Parliament and the 2nd New Zealand Parliament as representative for the Southern Division; (consisting of the Waikato, Bay of Plenty, and East Cape regions). He resigned on 13 April 1858. From the 1861 election, he served in the 3rd New Zealand Parliament as representative for the Raglan electorate. He resigned from Raglan before the end of that term on 1 April 1865.

His election statement for the 1861 election read, &quot;Having always held opinions opposed to a centralising policy, I should vote for the repeal of the &quot;New Provinces Act.” I am prepared to unite with the other representatives of this province in obtaining a sweeping reduction in the expenditure now lavished on an overgrown and daily increasing official staff, and to act in concert with those gentlemen that Auckland may hold the prominent position due to her in the government of the colony.&quot; In that election he defeated Theodore Haultain.

He represented the Southern Division electorate on the 3rd Auckland Provincial Council from 26 October 1860 to 12 September 1861. He was appointed to the Legislative Council on 31 March 1869. His membership lapsed on 26 July 1878 through absence, when he and his family went to live in England.

News was received in New Zealand in July 1897 of his death in London, England.

<doc id="1010758" wikidata="Q1137870" url="?curid=1010758" title="Courvoisier's law">
<text>Courvoisier&#x27;s principle (known as Courvoisier&#x27;s sign or Courvoisier–Terrier&#x27;s sign, or Courvoisier syndrome) states that a painless palpably enlarged gallbladder accompanied with mild jaundice is unlikely to be caused by gallstones. Usually, the term is used to describe the physical examination finding of the right-upper quadrant of the abdomen. This sign implicates possible malignancy of the gallbladder or pancreas and the swelling is unlikely due to gallstones.

This observation is best explained as a matter of the gradual increase in gallbladder distention that occurs secondary to chronic processes versus the abrupt increase in gallbladder pressure observed in acute processes. Courvoisier&#x27;s sign occurs due to the gradual (chronic) nature of the obstruction caused by cancer (e.g. pancreatic, often located in pancreatic head, cholangiocarcinoma, etc.), which gradually causes biliary back-pressure and gradually distends the gallbladder over time, without causing acute damage, thus without causing pain. Conversely, gallstones cause obstruction of the biliary tree in a more abrupt (acute) nature when the gallstone becomes suddenly lodged somewhere along the biliary tree, blocking the passage of bile. This process causes the gallbladder to distend as it contracts against an abruptly blocked/higher pressure biliary tree, resulting in acute inflammation of the gallbladder (acute cholecystitis) and right upper quadrant abdominal pain (i.e., not Courvoisier&#x27;s sign). Fibrosis of the gallbladder is another chronic process that occurs due to repeated acute inflammation (i.e., chronic cholecystitis), resulting in a shrunken, fibrotic (therefore hard), and calcified gallbladder (&quot;porcelain gallbladder&quot;), which typically will not present with Courvoisier&#x27;s sign and is diagnosed with imaging.

Ludwig Georg Courvoisier&#x27;s original observations, published in Germany in 1890, were not originally cited as a &#x27;law&#x27;, and no mention of malignancy or pain (tenderness) was made. These points are commonly misquoted or confused in the medical literature.

== Exceptions ==
Exceptions to Courvoisier&#x27;s law imply that a stone is responsible for jaundice and a non-tender, palpable gall bladder. Typically gall bladder stones form slowly which allow time for the gall bladder to become tender. The exceptions to the law are stones that dislodge and acutely block the duct distally to the hepatic/cystic duct junction: 
# Double gallstones with one falling and blocking the common bile duct (responsible for jaundice) and one at the cystic duct (palpable non-tender gallbladder results from precisely a mucocele of the fibrotic gallbladder)

Cholangiocarcinoma, Klatskin tumors, ascariasis, or recurrent pyogenic cholangitis are not exceptions to the law because they all fall under it. For example, in the case of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis complicated by calcium bilirubinate stone dislodging to the common bile duct causing a distended gallbladder by back pressure. (Where formation of stones are not strictly in gallbladder, hence not fibrotic, but in the intrahepatic bile ducts). To reiterate, the law simply says that jaundice and non-tender, palpable gall bladders are caused by other things than chronic bile gallstone formation.

The law does not say that these symptoms automatically mean pancreatic cancer. It just happens that pancreatic cancer is the most common cause that falls under Courvoisier&#x27;s law. Other cause includes malignancy of the CBD (i.e. cholangiocarcinoma), head of pancreas and ampulla of Vater.

== Related conditions ==
A palpable &quot;tender&quot; gallbladder (hence the law cannot be applied) may be seen in acute acalculous cholecystitis, which commonly follows trauma or ischemia and causes acute inflammation of the gallbladder in the absence of gallstones.

A palpable gallbladder without mild jaundice (hence the law cannot be applied) can also be seen in Mirizzi&#x27;s syndrome.

The following case is an illustration of using the rationale underlying the Courvoisier Law clinically. In a patient with a history of lung cancer presenting with jaundice and a non-palpable gallbladder it is likely that it is caused by a double cancer affected the common hepatic ducts and not from metastasis to the lymph node causing obstructive jaundice. This is because in the latter case, location of the lymph node has got to be in the CBD (simply by anatomical location) and one would expect a palpable gallbladder. All these speculations assume that the patient did not have gallstone disease previously (where the gallbladder would be fibrotic and not palpable) and that the patient does not have a history of other liver diseases (such as recurrent pyogenic cholangitis).

<doc id="1010760" wikidata="Q5482097" url="?curid=1010760" title="Francis Ormond">
<text>Francis Ormond (23 November 1827 – 5 May 1889) was a Scottish-born Australian pastoralist, member of the Parliament of Victoria and philanthropist in the areas of education and religion.

Ormond is notable for founding the Working Men&#x27;s College of Melbourne, which became the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT), and for endowing the position of Ormond Professor of Music and donating the majority of funds towards the establishment of Ormond College, both at the University of Melbourne.

==Early life and voyage to Australia==
Francis Ormond was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, the only son of three children to British Merchant Navy sailor, Captain Francis Ormond Sr., and Isabella (née Esson). He was educated at the Tyzack&#x27;s Academy in Liverpool, England, after his father moved his family to the major shipping city to further his career, circa 1835.

Ormond&#x27;s father adopted an early interest in Britain&#x27;s southern colonies, which came from stories he heard of the expedition of Hume and Hovel and of Australia Felix. In command of the merchant vessel &quot;John Bull&quot;, Captain Ormond was the first to transport British settlers to the newly founded settlement of Melbourne – in the south-east of the Colony of New South Wales – arriving in the bay of Port Phillip in 1840. Upon his first landing in Melbourne, he was so impressed by the pastoralism opportunities the settlement presented, he began plans to move his family to the colony. He purchased the barque &quot;Tuscan&quot; the following year, and set sail with his family for the fledgling Port Phillip District.

When the Ormonds arrived in Melbourne in 1842, they found the district in the midst of a trade crisis. The crisis was caused by dissent some other districts of New South Wales held for the Port Phillip District – which had attempted to become an independent colony in 1840 – and many novice pastoralists neglecting their interests, and spending most of their time in the burgeoning settlement of Melbourne. This had led to a considerable depreciation in the pastoralism industry, with sheep once costing 35 shillings (≈ A$200 today) being sold for 18 pence (≈ A$10 today), and sometimes less.

Discouraged by the economic state of the Port Phillip District, the Ormonds then sailed to the Colony of New Zealand, after hearing positive reports about the islands. However, there they were met with heightened tension between British settlers and the indigenous Māori tribes. His father unsure of what to do, Ormond accompanied him to meet with a former passenger of the &quot;John Bull&quot; who counselled them and suggested they return to the Port Phillip District.

==Settlement in the Port Phillip District==
After the Ormonds returned to Melbourne, in 1843 Capt. Ormond took a seven-year lease on 20 acres (80,937 m2) of land near Geelong (near what is the present day site of Shelford). As part of his lease agreement, he was to &quot;improve the land and build a substantial inn&quot;. He established the &quot;Settler&#x27;s Arms Inn&quot; (which was affectionately known as &quot;Ormond&#x27;s Inn&quot;) on the site - becoming the first inn on the trade route from Geelong to Hamilton - which prospered due to its location. The younger Ormond worked as a book keeper at his father&#x27;s inn, who had intended for him to later train in commerce in the counting house of a merchant in Geelong.

However, in 1847 Captain Ormond was presented with the opportunity to purchase the small sheep station &quot;Mopiamnum&quot; near Piggoreet, south-west of Ballarat, for a considerably low price. With the lease not up on his inn, he placed his confidence in the younger Ormond and made him the station manager at age 19. The land of &quot;Mopiamnum&quot; was poor, and much of it was covered with thick scrub which made it very difficult for him to maintain the flock of sheep, in addition to constant attacks by dingoes which inhabited the scrubland. Despite all this, he endured the physical hardships of the land and in his spare time found happiness in the study of classical literature and self-improvement.

Through Ormond&#x27;s perseverance &quot;Mopiamnum&quot; prospered, and more assistance was required to manage the land. In 1850, he hired a number of station hands only to discover that the majority of them were quite uneducated. Since they had never had the opportunity of an education, he took it upon himself start a class for his employees. He devoted almost every evening to their tutorage, until the time came for them to leave his employment, to which they did with a useful level of education.

===Pastoral wealth===

As a way of raising capital to improve his flock, in 1850 he accepted a tender for the arduous task of the carriage of mail. With the help of his station hands he also &quot;rode the post&quot; for the Geelong region, in addition to his pastoral duties. Later that year, he was then able to purchase the neighbouring property &quot;Ghirangemerajah&quot;, north of Lismore. Now with a sizable staff of station hands, he was able to effectively manage his second property from his base at &quot;Mopiamnum&quot;.

On 6 February 1851, the &quot;Black Thursday&quot; bushfires - one of the worst fires in Australian colonial history - passed over &quot;Mopiamnum&quot;. While Ormond worked to exhaustion to save some of his flock, the station and much of its grazing land were engulfed by the blaze, including the scrub which covered much of the land. When the rains followed shortly after they renewed the previously worthless scrubland into prime grazing land, which raised the value of &quot;Mopiamnum&quot; substantially.

Ormond sold the land for an advance on the original price his father had paid and, later that year, also sold his second property &quot;Ghirangemerajah&quot;. He paid his father for &quot;Mopiamnum&quot; in full and purchased the 30,000 acre (121,405,692 m2) station &quot;Borriyalloak&quot; near Skipton, east of Piggoreet, along with its flocks of merino sheep. On 2 August 1851, gold was discovered in Ballarat, marking the beginning of the Victorian Gold Rush - one of the biggest gold rushes in the world - which once again raised the value of Ormond&#x27;s land. With his financial position assured, on 23 November 1851 (his 24th birthday) he married Ann Greeves, the daughter of a distinguished doctor in the district, at the Christ Church in Geelong.

==Early philanthropic endeavours==
In 1853, Ormond was made a territorial magistrate, and regularly sat on the Common Bench of towns close to &quot;Borriyalloak&quot; at Skipton, Linton, Carngham and Chepstowe. He was known as a thoughtful magistrate, devoted to the duties of his office. In 1855, he and two other prominent land owners in the area formed the Skipton Agricultural and Pastoral Association - the first of its kind in the district. The association&#x27;s annual show became an important event for the district, creating keen competition between pastoralists in the district and contributing to the widespread fame of Australian merino wool.

During the mid-1850s, Ormond continued with the educational work he&#x27;d began in 1850 and started a class for the children of his employees at &quot;Borriyalloak&quot;, who were often left on their own while their parents worked the land and not privileged to an education. Ormond was also a devout Presbyterian, and in 1856 - after a town meeting in Skipton - he began lengthy talks with the Presbytery of Melbourne, calling for the establishment of a parish in Skipton. He persevered in 1857, when a small brick church was constructed in the town and a minister finally consigned to the newly devised Parish of Mount Emu Creek/Skipton.

As a magistrate, Ormond investigated a murder that took place near Ballarat in 1858, and concluded that the death of the man in question was accidental. However, unknown to him, his findings were never presented at the trial. Some time later, he read in the newspaper that the man accused had been sent to appear at the Supreme Court of Victoria in Melbourne and found guilty by a jury. After reading that the man had been sentenced to death by hanging, to take place in two days, he ordered his best horses to be saddled and hastily made the long and difficult journey to the city.

Ormond rode all night and the following day, crossing bridgeless and flooded rivers, to arrive in Melbourne on the evening before the hanging was to take place. He immediately went to the office of the Attorney-General, who told him it was too late for anything to be done. However, Ormond demanded the Attorney-General relentlessly to view the documents of his findings. When he eventually yielded and went through the documentation, sighting the grave miscarriage of justice, he immediately postponed the hanging pending a full investigation. The man accused&#x27;s innocence was later proven and his pardon ordered by the Governor of Victoria, Sir Henry Barkly.

==Growing wealth and move to Melbourne==

===First European tour===
As his wealth grew, Ormond continued to take an interest in education and even established a school on his station for the children of his employees. In 1860, during a trip to Europe, he was impressed by an appeal he had heard by Thomas Guthrie on behalf of the Ragged Schools charity. Upon his return to Victoria, he began to take a greater interest in philanthropic endeavours. His first substantial donation was in 1872, when he donated £1,000 towards the establishment of a scholarship at the Presbyterian Theological Hall in Melbourne.

===Ormond College===

After his father died in 1875, Ormond and his wife moved from Skipton to Melbourne. He purchased the mansion house, &quot;Ognez&quot;, in Toorak, and later assisted with the establishment of the Presbyterian church in Toorak. Ormond was a devout Presbyterian and an elder in the church. When the question of establishing a Presbyterian college at the University of Melbourne was raised in 1877, he pledged £10,000 to the appeal. At the opening of the college on 18 March 1881, it was announced that it would be officially named Ormond College in honour of his major contribution. Over his lifetime, Ormond donated almost £40,000 towards its complete construction.

===First wife&#x27;s death===
Ormond&#x27;s wife, Mary Ann, died on 6 July 1881, at their home in Toorak. His late wife was a member of the Church of England and, &quot;in memoriam&quot;, he anonymously donated £5,000 towards the construction of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in Melbourne. The donation financed the completion of its central tower and its western tower. In 1881, he purchased a large section of James Balfour&#x27;s &quot;Round Hill Station&quot; near Albury in New South Wales, naming his section &quot;Kirndeen Station&quot;. He also further expanded his Victorian land holdings at his &quot;Bangal Station&quot; in Skipton.

In 1881, Ormond was appointed a member of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Education Act. He refused the position of Commission Chairman, due to his advocacy of religious education in state schools, but accepted a general position with the commission. Ormond encouraged the creation of the Technological Commission, which was later responsible for the introduction of technical education into state schools. He also proposed the idea of a technical college for Melbourne. He pledged £5000 towards the proposal, on the provision that the government supply a site and trade unions contribute the majority of funds. However, the proposal was met with little support from the commission, and was subsequently dropped.

===Election to parliament===
Ormond also tried to establish a music college in Melbourne, in 1882. However, like his technical college proposal, it was met with little support. He stood for the Parliament of Victoria in 1882, and was subsequently elected the Member of the Legislative Council for the South-Western Province. With his new political status, Ormond revived his technical college proposal, which received approval in late 1882. He remarried on 1 October 1885, to Mary (&quot;née&quot; Oliphant) in London, while visiting technical colleges and music colleges in Europe to examine their methods and practices. Also in 1885, he became a key contributor of the proposed Gordon Memorial Technical College in Geelong.

==Ormond&#x27;s &quot;Working Men&#x27;s College&quot;==
During his first four trips to Europe, Ormond visited a number of technical colleges, to examine their methods and practices. He set out to apply the best of these methods and practices to a model for a similar college in Victoria.
One result of this was his conviction that a working men&#x27;s college would serve a very useful purpose, and he intimated that if the government would provide a site he would give £5000 towards the building. He met with no encouragement, and the scheme was temporarily dropped.

In May the question of a Working Men&#x27;s College was revived. He again offered £5000 and, after some preliminary difficulties had been disposed of, the college was at last opened in June 1887. There were 320 students on the opening night, within 12 months the number had risen to over 1000. The number of students reached nearly 10,000 in 1938. Later known as the Royal Melbourne Technical College and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, it&#x27;s known today as RMIT University and is one of Australia&#x27;s largest and leading universities.

==Later life and death==
In the 1880s, after he tried to found a college of music in Melbourne; when other assistance was not forthcoming he gave £20,000 to found the Ormond chair of music at the university.

Ormond found there was much difference of opinion in Melbourne concerning the wisest way of using his proposed donation, and very little response had come to the appeal for funds to found scholarships. However, the money was eventually raised and in May 1887 the Ormond chair of music at the university of Melbourne was founded.

Ormond had no children, but adopted two girls and a boy.

On his fifth visit to Europe Ormond had a rapid physical breakdown ascribed to overwork and died at Pau, South France, on 5 May 1889. His body was sent to Melbourne and after a service at Scots Church and a large procession to Spencer Street was taken by train to Geelong where he was buried on 7 September. He was survived by his wife who died in 1925.

==Ormond legacy==
The Ormond Chair of Music at the University of Melbourne, Ormond Hall at the Royal Victorian Institute for the Blind, RMIT&#x27;s Francis Ormond Building (the former Working Men&#x27;s College), Ormond College at the University of Melbourne, Ormond Road in Geelong, The Francis Ormond Masonic Lodge No 286 UGLV and the Melbourne suburb of Ormond are all named in his honour.

A bronze statue of Francis Ormond stands outside RMIT&#x27;s Francis Ormond Building on La Trobe Street in Melbourne.

<doc id="1010769" wikidata="Q442737" url="?curid=1010769" title="John IV of Constantinople">
<text>John IV of Constantinople (died 2 September 595), also known as &quot;John Nesteutes&quot; (, &quot;Ioannes the Faster&quot;), was patriarch of Constantinople (12 April 582 – 2 September 595). He was the first to assume the title &quot;Ecumenical Patriarch&quot;. He is regarded as a saint by the Eastern Orthodox Church which holds a feast on 2 September.

== Life ==
John IV (surnamed &quot;Jejunator&quot;, sometimes also &quot;Cappadox&quot;) was born at Constantinople of artisan parents, and worked as a goldsmith. Under the Patriarch John Scholasticus (565–577) he was deacon at the Hagia Sophia church; then he became sakellarios (an official who acts as patriarchal vicar for monasteries). He was famous for his ascetical life and called &quot;the Faster&quot;. Under Eutychius of Constantinople (552–565 and 577–582) he became an important person among the clergy of the city. At Eutychius&#x27;s death he was made patriarch by the Emperor Tiberius II Constantine (574–582).

According to one account, a horse show was scheduled in the Hippodrome on eve of the Feast of Pentecost. Patriarch John IV found his flock&#x27;s attendance unacceptable. Through the patriarch&#x27;s fervent prayer, a terrible thunderstorm arose with rain and hailstones so that everyone dispersed in fear and came to realize the inappropriateness of such entertainment.

Under the next emperor, Maurice (582–602), he was still a favourite at court. He had always a great reputation for asceticism and charity to the poor. In 587 or 588, he summoned the bishops of the East in the name of the &quot;Ecumenical Patriarch&quot; to examine certain charges against Gregory of Antioch, Patriarch of Antioch, (although Fortescue questions on what authority).

Patriarch Gregory was acquitted and returned to his episcopal see. A report was sent to Rome and Pope Pelagius II solemnly annulled the acts of this council. In 590 Pope Pelagius II was succeeded by Pope Gregory I, who was initially on good terms with John IV, whom he had known when Gregory I served as legate at Constantinople.

In 593, John IV was severely blamed by Pope Gregory I for having allowed an Isaurian presbyter named Anastasius, who had been accused of heresy, to be beaten with ropes in the church of Constantinople.

In 595, the controversy was again rife about the title of Ecumenical Patriarch. Gregory wrote to his legate Sabinianus forbidding him to communicate with John IV. In the case of a presbyter named Athanasius, accused of being to some extent a Manichaean, and condemned as such, Gregory I tried to show that the accuser was himself a Pelagian, and that by the carelessness, ignorance, or fault of John IV, the Nestorian council of Ephesus had actually been mistaken for the Orthodox Council of Ephesus.

== Works ==
Isidore of Seville (&quot;de Script. Eccl.&quot; 26) attributes to him only a letter, not now extant, on baptism addressed to St. Leander, John IV, he says &quot;propounds nothing of his own, but only repeats the opinions of the ancient Fathers on trine immersion&quot;. There are, however, several works attributed to John IV still extant (edited in Patrologia Graeca, vol. 88):
* His Penitential, &quot;Libellus Poenitentialis&quot;, or, as it is described in Book III of the work of Leo Allatius, &quot;de Consensu Utriusque Ecclesiae&quot; (Rome, 1655, quarto), &quot;Praxis Graecis Praescripta in Confessione Peragenda&quot;;
* &quot;Instructio, qua non modo confitens de confessione pie et integre edenda instituitur, sed etiam sacerdos, qua ratione confessiones excipiat, poenitentiam imponat et reconciliationem praestet informatur&quot;;
* Homily on penitence, continence, and virginity. It is often printed among John Chrysostom&#x27;s homilies but now agreed not to be Chrysostom&#x27;s. Bernard de Montfaucon, Isaac Vossius, and Pearson held it to be by John IV; Morel and Savile printed it among Chrysostom&#x27;s works;
* Homily on False Prophets and False Doctrine. It is attributed occasionally to Chrysostom, by Peter Wastel to John of Jerusalem, but by Isaac Vossius, Petavius, and Cave to John IV;
* A set of Precepts to a Monk, in a manuscript at the Paris library.

The Orthodox in the Middle Ages always attributed the first two of these to the Patriarch.

<text>(; ) is an optical phenomenon in which a bright spot appears around the shadow of the viewer&#x27;s head in the presence of dew. In photogrammetry and remote sensing, it is more commonly known as the hotspot. It is also occasionally known as Cellini&#x27;s halo after the Italian artist and writer Benvenuto Cellini (15001571), who described the phenomenon in his memoirs in 1562.

Nearly spherical dew droplets act as lenses to focus the light onto the surface behind them. When this light scatters or reflects off that surface, the same lens re-focuses that light into the direction from which it came. This configuration is similar to a cat&#x27;s eye retroreflector. However a cat&#x27;s eye retroreflector needs a refractive index of around 2, while water has a much smaller refractive index of approximately 1.33. This means that the water droplets focus the light about 20% to 50% of the diameter beyond the rear surface of the droplet. When dew droplets are suspended on trichomes at approximately this distance away from the surface of a plant, the combination of droplet and plant acts as a retroreflector. Any retroreflective surface is brightest around the antisolar point.

Opposition surge by other particles than water and the glory in water vapour are similar effects caused by different mechanisms.

<text>Lake Ainslie is the largest natural freshwater lake on Cape Breton. The Southwest Margaree River starts at the lake and empties into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The lake is approximately long and averages in width.
It was formed during the Pleistocene, about two million years ago, when glacial outwash blocked the drainage of the valley of Loch Ban. It is underlain primarily by sedimentary deposits of the Horton and Windsor Formations, dating back about 350 million years.

A number of bald eagles nest around the lake. The lake was named after George Robert Ainslie, the Lieutenant Governor of Cape Breton Island from 1816 to 1820, when Cape Breton became part of Nova Scotia.

<text>Nikolai Philippe Fraiture (born November 13, 1978) is an American musician best known as the bassist of the rock band The Strokes. Since co-founding the band in 1998, he has released six studio albums with them. Among other creative projects, Fraiture released a solo record under the name Nickel Eye in 2009 and has been the frontman of the band Summer Moon since 2016.

==Early life==
Fraiture was born in New York City to a French-Russian mother and French father. He was raised with his older brother Pierre and younger sister Elizabeth in the Yorkville neighborhood of the Upper East Side. Fraiture met future bandmate Julian Casablancas at the age of six while attending the Friends School and Lycée Français de New York, from which he graduated in 1997. Through Casablancas, Fraiture met future Strokes members Nick Valensi and Fabrizio Moretti while they were teenagers. Fraiture later attended Hunter College with Valensi.

Fraiture received his first bass at 16 when his grandfather gave it to him as a graduation present, but Fraiture gave it away to Casablancas and did not resume playing until two years later.

== Career ==

=== The Strokes ===
Fraiture took up bass when he was around 18 and started playing in a band with childhood friend Julian Casablancas, guitarist Nick Valensi, and drummer Fabrizio Moretti. The Strokes were formed in 1998 when guitarist Albert Hammond Jr. joined the group. After a year of rehearsing and playing at small venues, and several rejections from record companies, the group caught the interest of Ryan Gentles, then a booker at New York&#x27;s Mercury Lounge. Gentles sent their three-track demo to Geoff Travis of Rough Trade Records and their first EP &quot;The Modern Age&quot; was released on the label, followed by a tour in England to promote the EP, with Gentles joining them as their manager. After a bidding war, the band signed with RCA in March 2001. Their first album, &quot;Is This It&quot;, was released in fall 2001. Following the completion of their five-album contract deal with RCA Records in 2013, the band has continued to release new music through Casablancas&#x27; Cult Records.

===Nickel Eye===
Fraiture started his side project, Nickel Eye, during the hiatus after &quot;First Impressions of Earth&quot;. He enlisted the help of South, a UK band introduced to him by a friend, as his backing band. Nickel Eye recorded some demos at South Studios in Hackney, London. With some guest appearances by Nick Zinner of the New York City-based band Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Regina Spektor, &quot;The Time of the Assassins&quot; was completed a few months later in New York. The album is musically inspired by some of Fraiture&#x27;s favorite artists, such as Neil Young, Frank Black, Leonard Cohen, and The Kinks. &quot;The Time of the Assassins&quot; was released on January 27, 2009 on Rykodisc. Nickel Eye’s first performance was on October 15, 2008 at London’s Borderline venue.

As Nickel Eye, Fraiture released 2014 demo &quot;Same Difference&quot; digitally in 2020.

=== Summer Moon ===
In 2016, Fraiture started a new band, Summer Moon with Jane’s Addiction’s Stephen Perkins (drums), Uh Huh Her’s Camila Grey (keyboardist and vocalist), and The Airborne Toxic Event&#x27;s Noah Harmon (guitar), with Fraiture providing vocals and bass for the group. The group&#x27;s debut album &quot;With You Tonight&quot; was released in 2017. As of 2020, the band is working on an EP.

=== Other collaborations ===
In 2007, Fraiture composed the music and starred in the movie &quot;A Kind of Dream&quot; with wife Illy Fraiture. The movie was a 30-minute black and white silent film written and directed by Danny Velez.

On May 19, 2012, for the 37th season finale of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Fraiture played bass alongside Arcade Fire and guest/musical host Mick Jagger.

Fraiture is one-half of the performance art project Arts Elektra with his brother Pierre Fraiture, a New York-based mixed medium artist. The duo combines live performance of original rock music compositions with live painting. Beginning in 2019, Arts Elektra launched a twelve-act, site-specific piece entitled &quot;C&#x27;est Le Moment Ou Jamais (It&#x27;s Now Or Never)&quot; at different locations globally. Their first act was performed in April 2019 at the World Trade Center in New York City and the second act was presented that December during Art Basel week at the Miami River Art Fair. The works created are auctioned off to benefit different charities.

==Personal life==
Fraiture married artist Ilona &quot;Illy&quot; Jankovich in 2004. They have two children, Elysia and Phoenix. 

The family lives in New York City and have lived in the West Village neighborhood for a number of years. 

Fraiture and his wife practice Nichiren Buddhism in the Soka Gakkai Buddhist tradition.

<text>The Margaree River (&quot;Abhainn Mhargaraidh&quot;) is a river on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. The northeast branch of the river derives from the watershed of the Cape Breton Highlands, while the Southwest Margaree flows northeast from Lake Ainslie. The two branches join at Margaree Forks. The river then flows north to empty into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence at Margaree Harbour, Nova Scotia. The river is 120 km in length and drains an area of 1,375 km². The Margaree has been well known for a century for its trout and Atlantic salmon sport fishery, that draws anglers from near and far. Fishing is highly regulated now and is restricted to fly fishing only, with barbless hooks, in the main stem of the river. Famed American angler and Atlantic salmon conservationist Lee Wulff caught his first salmon on a fly on the Margaree in 1933.

The gravel bars of the upper Northeast Margaree provide spawning grounds for Atlantic salmon; its steep valleys provide habitat for American marten and the rare Gaspé shrew. The Margaree Valley includes a mix of farms and woodlands.

During the 18th century, Acadians settled along the coast near the mouth of the river; the French name for this river was St. Marguerite. Scottish Highlanders began to settle in the Margaree Valley at the beginning of the 19th century.

Moses Coady, a noted son of the Margaree Valley, attended school in Margaree Forks and later, taught there before completing his education in Antigonish and Rome.

The Margaree was designated a Canadian Heritage River in 1998.

HMCS &quot;Margaree&quot;, a World War II Canadian naval destroyer, was named after this river.

<doc id="1010796" wikidata="Q2735120" url="?curid=1010796" title="The Gate (1987 film)">
<text>The Gate is a 1987 supernatural horror film directed by Tibor Takács and starring Stephen Dorff in his film debut. The film follows two young boys who accidentally release a horde of demons from their backyard through a large hole in the ground.

An international co-production between Canada and the United States, the film was released by the New Century Vista Film Company and grossed around twice its budget. Since its release, it has obtained a cult following and was followed by a sequel in 1990 titled &quot;The Gate II: Trespassers&quot;.

A 3D-remake directed by Alex Winter was in production; it was initially set for a release in 2011, but no release occurred at that time.

== Plot ==
Twelve-year-old Glen has a nightmare of finding his home abandoned, then going into his tree-house only for it to be struck by lightning and collapse. When he wakes, he finds that in his backyard, workers have cut down the same tree from his nightmare and unearthed a large geode which is later found by Glen and his older friend Terry. Glen catches a splinter and leaves a small amount of blood behind.

Glen&#x27;s parents leave town for three days, placing his 15-year-old sister Alexandra (&quot;Al&quot;) in charge. While Al throws a party, Terry and Glen break open the geode after discovering it has left strange writing on a notepad, and read the incantations aloud. They go downstairs just as the party-goers are playing a levitation game. Everyone is shocked when they levitate Glen.

That night, Glen sees his bedroom wall stretching, and Terry embraces an apparition of his dead mother that turns out to be Glen&#x27;s dog Angus, who dies as a result. The next day, Terry brings a heavy metal album to Glen&#x27;s house with lyrics based on &quot;The Dark Book&quot;. He believes that the hole in Glen&#x27;s backyard is a gateway to a domain of evil gods, and speculates that their actions opened it. He concludes that the only missing element would be to deposit a sacrifice into the hole. Unknown to them, a friend of Al&#x27;s dumps Angus&#x27;s body into the hole, completing the summoning. After reading a section from &quot;The Dark Book&quot; that is supposed to close the gateway, the boys find the hole closed and assume that their efforts succeeded.

That night, a swarm of moths shatter Glen&#x27;s bedroom window, and Angus&#x27; corpse is found in Terry&#x27;s bed. Demonic arms try pulling Al under her bed; Terry and Glen barely save her. They try fleeing the house, but are greeted outside by Glen and Al&#x27;s parents, actually disguised demons. After returning to the house, Al volunteers to inspect the yard, but the others see it swarming with small demons and call her back. Terry leads everyone to the basement to retrieve &quot;The Dark Book&quot;, but it bursts into flames. They then attempt to stop the creatures by reading the Bible. Terry reads from Psalm 59 and the hole begins to close, but he slips and falls into the hole. Terry is attacked by the small demons before Al and Glen pull him out. Terry reads from Genesis, then throws the Bible into the hole, causing an explosion that appears to seal the hole.

That night, a wall breaks open and a construction worker&#x27;s corpse falls through (Terry had previously lied to Glen that when his house was built, one of the workers died and the other workers had sealed him inside a wall). The worker pulls Terry into the wall, which seals behind him. Upstairs, Al notices a hazy image of the construction worker in her mirror before Glen bursts into her bedroom. Al throws a stereo at the construction worker and he disintegrates into dozens of little demons. Al holds the bedroom door shut while Glen races downstairs to find their father&#x27;s gun. A demonic version of Terry appears, biting his hand before Al stabs Terry in the eye. Al and Glen hide in a closet, but the construction worker breaks through an interior wall and drags Al away.

Glen realizes that Terry and Al represent the two human sacrifices that would fully open the gate. He also realizes that the rocket he had given to Al for her birthday, a symbol of love, light and purity, may stop the rise of the Old Gods. He makes his way upstairs as the floor collapses, revealing a chasm beneath the house. Glen attempts to launch the rocket, but his matches keep blowing out. The wind sucks Glen onto the foyer, where a giant serpentine demon emerges. The demon pats Glen on the head and touches his hand before returning to the hole. Glen discovers that the demon&#x27;s touch has placed an eye in the palm of his hand. He stabs the eye, then struggles to descend the staircase, at which point the demon re-emerges. Glen uses a battery-powered launcher to fire his rocket into the demon, causing it to explode.

Angus emerges from the front closet, seemingly restored to life. He is followed by Terry and Al, also unhurt. Later, the kids worry about how to explain the wreckage of the house to their parents.

== Production ==
The first draft of the script was written by Michael Nankin when he was unemployed and recently divorced, basing it on &quot;the nastiest thoughts from [his] childhood&quot;. Glen and Al were depicted as being more mischievous than shown in the final film, and the demons spread to the rest of the town, where they would drag neighbors out into the streets to kill them. The gigantic demon was originally envisioned as being made of bloody entrails.

The house was a real home in Toronto, but an exterior exit had to be constructed for the production, featuring bricks, stairs, and a bug zapper. Beyond the backyard was a new housing development, so the crew erected a fence around the yard to block the construction vehicles and workers from view.

The effects used to create the demons included stop-motion animation as well as forced perspective, wherein actors wearing rubber suits were made to look minuscule by their position relative to the camera and to the human characters. Randall William Cook, the film&#x27;s special effects supervisor, used his hand and eye to create the scene where an eyeball appears in Glen&#x27;s palm.

== Release ==
&quot;The Gate&quot; opened in the US on May 15, 1987. It ranked second in its opening weekend and grossed $4.3 million. It grossed a total of $13.5 million by the end of its run. Lionsgate released a special edition DVD on October 6, 2009, with audio commentary from the director and interviews. They later released a Blu-ray version via their label Vestron Video on February 28, 2017. It includes commentary from the filmmakers and several featurettes.

=== Critical response ===
Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 36% based on 11 reviews and a rating average of 4.90/10. Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, in comparing it to the works of Steven Spielberg and Stephen King, wrote, &quot;whatever minor triumphs it dredges up, is too hopelessly copycat&quot;. In rating it 3/5 stars, &quot;TV Guide&quot; called it a &quot;surprisingly effective&quot; and refreshingly uncynical horror film that may be too wimpy for some horror fans. Commenting on the film&#x27;s dreamlike plot, &quot;Time Out&quot; said it could have been a cult film had the filmmakers abandoned their attempts to tie together the bizarre elements.

In a retrospective review, Odie Henderson of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; wrote, &quot;If you can get in touch with your inner 12-year-old, &quot;The Gate&quot; is a pleasant diversion.&quot; Henderson identifies family values as a core theme, though it is subtle enough not to be preachy. Reviewing the DVD for Dread Central, Paul Nicholasi rated it 4.5/5 stars and called it &quot;a MUST HAVE movie for all horror fans&quot; that they can show their kids to introduce them to horror films.

== Sequels ==
In 1992 a sequel was released entitled &quot;The Gate II: Trespassers&quot; Louis Tripp reprises his role as Terry, but was the only original cast member to return. It was directed by Tibor Takács and opened in 350 theaters on February 28, 1992, and grossed $2 million. It was released on VHS in 1992 by Columbia Tristar Home Video. In October 2017, Scream Factory released &quot;The Gate II&quot; on Blu-ray.

In 2009, Actor and Director Alex Winter was in development of a 3rd film entitled The Gate 3D pitched as a remake. However the project has been stuck in development hell since.

In 2020, Louis Tripp worked with Australian musician KidCrusher on a music and video collaboration entitled Sacrifice, reprising his role as Terry for a tribute to The Gate. On KidCrusher&#x27;s podcast he mentioned &quot;The Gate&quot; is the scariest movie he has ever seen and working with Tripp was a blessing.

<text>Lisch nodule, also known as iris hamartoma, is a pigmented hamartomatous nodular aggregate of dendritic melanocytes affecting the iris, named after Austrian ophthalmologist Karl Lisch (1907–1999), who first recognized them in 1937.

The first published use of the term &quot;Lisch nodule&quot; was in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; &quot;Medical Progress&quot; series article of December 31, 1981 (Riccardi VM: Von Recklinghausen Neurofibromatosis. &quot;N Engl J Med&quot; 1981;305:1617–27).

These nodules are found in neurofibromatosis type 1, and are present in greater than 94% of patients over the age of six. They are clear, yellow-brown, oval to round, dome-shaped papules that project from the surface of the iris. These nodules typically do not affect vision, but are very useful in diagnosis. They are detected by slit lamp examination. Immunohistochemistry stains positive against the proteins vimentin and S-100, and points to an ectodermal origin for the nodules. Their precise origin and structure, however, are still under investigation. They can rarely be seen in neurofibromatosis type 2.

<doc id="1010805" wikidata="Q1052171" url="?curid=1010805" title="Ca' Rezzonico">
<text>Ca&#x27; Rezzonico () is a palazzo and art museum on the Grand Canal in the Dorsoduro of Venice, Italy. It is a particularly notable example of the 18th century Venetian baroque and rococo architecture and interior decoration, and displays paintings by the leading Venetian painters of the period, including Francesco Guardi and Giambattista Tiepolo. It is a public museum dedicated to 18th-century Venice () and one of the 11 venues managed by the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia.

==History==
===Construction (17th-18th centuries)===
Ca&#x27; Rezzonico stands on the right bank of the Grand Canal of Venice, at the point where it is joined by the Rio di San Barnaba. The site was previously occupied by two houses, visible in early paintings of Venice in 1500, which a century and a half later were in a sad state of decay. They belonged to the Bon family, one of Venice&#x27;s patrician clans. In 1649 the head of the family, Filippo Bon, a Procurator of the city and patron of the arts, decided to transform the two houses into a single large palazzo on the site. For this purpose he employed Baldassarre Longhena (1597-1682), the greatest proponent of Venetian Baroque, a style slowly replacing the Renaissance and Palladian architectural style. Longhena was the designer of the famous dome of the Church of Santa Maria della Salute, a Venice baroque landmark. By 1661 Longhena had combined the two earlier structures, and work had begun on the facade facing the canal, and had reached as high as the first, or Noble, floor. However, neither architect nor client was to see the completion of the Palazzo Bon: Longhena died in 1682, and Filippo Bon saw his finances ruined by the cost of the palazzo. He was forced to halt the work.

Filippo Bon died in 1712, and the unfinished palace, already decaying, was inherited by his sons and then grandsons, but none had the funds to complete the construction. In 1750 The Bons offered the unfinished palazzo to Giambattista Rezzonico, a banker and fabric merchant from Lombardy, whose family had bought a title of Venetian nobility in 1648, during the War of Candia war with the Ottoman Empire, when the Venetian state coffers were depleted. Rezzonico paid 60,000 gold ducats for the unfinished building. Municipal inspectors examined the building, and concluded that most of the structure was a ruin, in danger of collapse. Only the rear part of the building, completed up to the second floor, had a roof and could be saved. Rezzonico hired the most prestigious architect of his time, Giorgio Massari (1687-1766), who had built the churches of the Jesuits and the church of the Pietà in Venice, as well as the palazzo of the Grassi family, which faced the Rezzonico palace on the other side of the Grand Canal.

A Canaletto painting of the early 18th century shows only the ground floor and first &quot;piano nobile&quot; completed, and a temporary roof protecting the structure from the elements. The Rezzonicos rushed the reconstruction along. In 1752, the accidental dropping of a piece of marble caused the scaffolding to collapse, dropping five stonemasons to the ground below. Massari largely followed the original plan of Longhena, but made a number of modifications to suit the lighter rococo tastes. He removed some ponderous double columns on the facade replacing them with more slender pillars, and eliminated a heavy plinth of columns, giving the building a lighter, more graceful appearance. He also installed a row of small oval windows above the larger windows on the second floor, adding light and a rococo touch.

The facade was finished between 1750 and 1752. Turning his attention to the interior, Massari broke with Venetian custom and put the major ceremonial room at the back of the building, not overlooking the canal. He doubled the height of the ceiling in this room and eliminated walls to create a more dramatic space. He laid out a ceremonial route that would take visitors from the dock and gateway on the Grand Canal to a fountain in the interior courtyard, surmounted by the coat of arms of the Rezzonico in marble; then taking a triumphal hallway to the monumental stairway which took them up to the grand salon or ballroom. As soon as the salons were completed, their ceilings were painted with frescoes by Giovanni Battista Crosato and in &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; by Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna.

The interior work was nearly finished in 1756. The pinnacle of the Rezzonico&#x27;s power and the Palazzo&#x27;s grandeur came in 1758, when Carlo, the younger brother of Giambattista Rezzonico, was elected Pope as Clement XIII, the same year Ludovico Rezzonico married Faustina Savorgnan, uniting the two richest families in Venice. To mark that occasion, Rezzonico commissioned the most celebrated painter of Venice, the aging Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, to paint the ceilings of two salons, along painters with Gaspare Diziani and Jacopo Guarana.

The palace was the site of further celebrations in 1759, when Aurelio Rezzonico was elected Procurator of San Marco, and in 1762, when Ludovico Rezzonico was elected to the same position. For three nights, the facades and interiors of the palace were lit with torches and candles in celebration. Upon his election as Pope, Carlo Rezzonico transferred a large part of the family art collection from Venice to Rome.

===19th-20th century- decline and revival===
Fifty years after the completion of the palace, in 1810, the last member of the Venetian branch of the Rezzonicos, cardinal Abbondio of Pisa, died, bringing an end to the family line. The palace nearly became a Jesuit College, but went instead through several families, and in 1832 to Carlo Pindemonte, the grandson of a Piedomontese poet and political figure, Ippolito Pindemonte. Pindemonte sold all the furnishings and art collections of the palazzo. Only the frescos remained in situ. In 1837, Pindemonte sold the empty building to Count Ladislao Zelinsky, who in turn rented the palazzo to the Baron von Bülow, then to count Zichj Cerner. From 1840 to 1857, it was rented to the Duke of Modena and his family, which included Don Carlo, the Duke of Madrid, the pretender to the Spanish throne.

Beginning in about 1850, the second floor of the palace was rented by the antiquarian and art dealer Jacobo Querci della Rovere, who used it as a gallery to sell paintings by Rubens, Rembrandt, Caravaggio, Canaletto, and other old masters. In the 1880s, it became the home of the painter Robert Barrett Browning, whose father Robert Browning, the poet, died in his apartment on the mezzanine floor in 1889. At this time, the American portrait painter John Singer Sargent also had a studio in the palazzo.

In 1906 Browning received an offer from the German Emperor, Wilhelm II, to buy the building, but sold it instead to Count , a deputy of the Italian parliament and a collector of modern art. The Palazzo became the setting for spectacular costume balls, celebrations by torchlight and candlelight, and concerts.

American songwriter and composer Cole Porter rented Ca&#x27; Rezzonico for $4,000 a month in the 1920s. Porter engaged 50 gondoliers and employed a troupe of high-rope walkers to &quot;perform in a blaze of colored lights&quot;.

The global depression of the 1930s brought an end to Minerbi&#x27;s funds and extravagance, and he sought a buyer for the Palace. After four years of negotiations, in June 1935 the city of Venice purchased the Palazzo and began to transform it into a museum of Venetian art from the 18th century. Works of art of the 18th century, including ceiling frescoes, from other houses and collections owned by the municipality were brought together in the Ca&#x27; Rezzonico, to accompany the original frescoes on the ceilings. The city also purchased additional works by Tiepolo, Guardi, Canova, and other artists to augment the collection. The building underwent a major restoration in the late 1970s and was completed in 2001.

==The ground floor and courtyard==

Visitors typically arrived by gondola at the main entrance, opening onto the Grand Canal. The building is narrow and deep, with the facade on the canal only three rooms wide. Visitors passed through the entrance, and down a long corridor to the courtyard, where a fountain is placed, with the coat of arms of the Rezzonico family. The entrance to the streets of Venice is behind the fountain. From the ground floor, visitors climb to the &quot;Piano Nobile&quot; by the staircase of honour, which has marble balustrades decorated with statuary by Giusto Le Court. Le Court was the leading sculptor in Venice in the late 17th century, and worked closely on many projects with the first architect of the building, Longhena.

==&quot;Piano Nobile&quot;==
The Palazzo&#x27;s ceremonial rooms are located on the &quot;piano nobile&quot;. The largest and most impressive is the grand salon or ballroom, fourteen by twenty-four meters in size, at the rear of the building. This room, created by Massari, is of double height, and appears even higher because of the &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; architecture painted on the walls and ceiling by Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna (not by Pietro Visconti, as long believed). The centerpiece of the ceiling, painted by Giovanni Battista Crosato, depicts Apollo riding his carriage between Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. The coat of arms of the Rezzonico family, with a double-headed eagle, also is prominently displayed on the wall of the ballroom facing the entry door. The two enormous chandeliers made of wood and gilded metal, from the mid-18th century, are among the few fixtures that date to the original period of the building. The ballroom is now decorated with 18th century statues by Andrea Brustolon, including a statue of an Ethiopian warrior carved of ebony.

The Salon of the Allegory, a room decorated to commemorate the 1758 marriage of Ludovico Rezzonico, the nephew of Pope Clement XIII Rezzonico, and future procurator of San Marco, to Faustina Savorgnan, is also on the &quot;Piano Nobile&quot;. The ceiling has a large fresco by Giambattista Tiepolo and his son, Giandomenico Tiepolo, depicting the groom and his bride ferried by Apollo&#x27;s chariot. It was one of the last works of Tiepolo in Venice, before his departure for Madrid in 1762. Tiepolo completed the work on the ceiling in only twelve days on the scaffolding. The Tiepolo fresco, like the paintings in the Grand salon, is framed by &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; paintings of architecture, including a false balustrade, by Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna, who also did the painted frames in the Grand Salon. The painting depicts the bridal couple in a chariot, being led by the sun god, Apollo. Other allegorical figures include cupid blindfold, a flight of &quot;putti&quot; and doves, the figure of Fame, holding a trumpet; the three graces on a cloud; a bearded old man with a laurel crown symbolizing Merit; and a lion, the symbol of Venice, along with coats of arms of the two families.

The furnishings of the salon included paintings and furnishings by Italian artists of the first half and mid-18th century, including portrait of Pope Clement XIII Rezzonico by Anton Raphael Mengs, a &quot;retable&quot; by Francesco Zugno, a pupil of Tiepolo, and a prie-dieu of carved walnut illustrating the fantasy of the Italian rococo style.

A passage from the Salon leads to a small chapel, suspended over the Rio San Barnaba. The chapel was built by either Aurelio Rezzonico or Cardinal Rezzonico, the nephew of Pope Clement XIII, in the second half of the 18th century. Some of the original decoration remains, including the sculpted and gilded rococo stucco sculpture on the white walls, and a retable, &quot;The Virgin and Saints&quot;, by a pupil of Tiepolo, Francesco Zugno, and &quot;prie-dieu&quot;, or seat for kneeling and praying, in the twisting and turning Venetian rococo style.
===The Salon of Pastels===
was originally a room for holding audiences; in that room the Papal Legate informed Cardinal Rezzonico that he had been elected Pope the day before. The ceiling is decorated with frescos depicting the Triumph of the Arts over Ignorance, presented in a &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; painted frame, with allegorical scenes painted in the corners. The paintings, particularly &quot;The Triumph of Poetry&quot;, date from the time when Tiepolo was working in the main salon, and are usually attributed to either Giambattista Crosato or Gaspare Diziani of Belluno. The room takes its name from the number of pastel portraits by Rosalba Carriera and other notable Venetian artists. They include a fine pastel portrait of the opera singer Faustina Bordoni by Carriera. Another notable pastel portrait is that of Cecilia Guardi Tiepolo, wife of the painter Tiepolo, painted by her son Lorenzo. It was painted in 1757.
===The Tapestry Hall===
features three large Flemish tapestries from the end of the 17th century, as well as sculpted and gilded furniture from the period. The ceiling frescoes represent The Triumph of Virtue, by Jacopo Guarana. The yellow door is also notable; it portrays a lacquered painting of a Chinese man with a parasol, surrounded by floral motifs, and dates from 1760.

===The Throne Room===
At the end of the &quot;piano nobile&quot;, looks out at both the Grand Canal and the Rio San Barnaba. It takes its name from an elaborate gilded and sculpted wooden throne which was used during the brief visit of Pope Pius VI in 1778, on his way from Rome to Vienna. It was also the bridal chamber of Ludovico Rezzonico and Faustina Savorgnan. Besides the throne, the other notable features of the room are the ceiling frescos, titled &quot;The Allegory of Merit&quot;, which were painted by Tiepolo and his sons in just twelve days. The furniture in the room is also notable, particularly sculpted and gilded tables, mirrors and candlesticks, ornamented with statues of putti and figures representing the different virtues. The room also features several fine Chinese porcelain vases.
===The Tiepolo Hall===
Has the third of the four Tiepolo ceilings in the building, called &quot;Nobility and Virtue defeating Ignorance&quot;. Unlike the other Tiepolo ceilings, this ceiling, painted in 1744–45, was not made for the Ca&#x27; Rezzonico, but for the family of Pietro Barbarigo for his own house in Santa Maria del Giglio. It was bought by the city of Venice in 1934 and installed in the museum. The room also displays paintings by Venetian artists, including Pietro Longhi, Francesco Guardi, and two early works in oval frames by Giambattista Tiepolo from 1715 to 1716. The furnishings also pieces of Venetian baroque furniture, including a gaming table, and an ornate painted secretary, or cabinet, used to hold previous objects, made in Germany in the 18th century.
===The library===
(or Morlaiter hall) with four large bookcases filled with small sculptures in terra-cotta or baked earth by the Venetian sculptor Giovanni Maria Morlaiter (1699-1781), which were acquired for the museum by the City of Venice in 1935. The ceiling has a fresco on the same theme as the Tiepolo fresco in the Throne Room, &quot;Allegory of Merit&quot;, by Mattia Bortoloni.

===Lazzarini Hall===
The Lazzarini Hall takes its name from the Venetian painter Gregorio Lazzarini, from the end of the 17th century. The three large mythological paintings in the room were attributed to him in the 19th century. More recent scholarship attributes one painting in the room, &quot;Orpheus massacred by the Bacchanantes&quot;, to Lazzari. The others are now attributed to Antonio Bellucci and Antonio Molinari. The five oval paintings on the ceiling, also on mythological themes, are by Francesco Maffei, from the end of the 17th century. The room also features a very fine marquetry desk, inlaid with ivory and decorated with gilded bronze, by the ebenist Pietro Pifetti, signed and dated 1741.
===Brustolon Hall===
The Brustolon Hall is devoted to the sculpted furniture and carved figures of Andrea Brustolon, the most celebrated Venetian baroque wood sculptor. The works displayed are dated 1706, and use different colored woods, including ebony, and extremely ornate baroque curves and twists to portray action and emotion. The room also features a notable chandelier with multi-colored glass in floral forms from the Murano glass workshop of Giuseppe Briani, made in the middle of the 18th century.
=== Ceiling from palazzo nani in Ca&#x27;Rezzonico-museum ===
===Portego===
In the traditional structure of the Venetian palace, the portego, or passing lounge, was the largest room of the building, intended to play the role of a performance room. This space today presents marble busts of the eighteenth century representing allegorical portraits and figures, while the walls are covered with Red Verona marble.
* &quot;Lucretia&quot; by Filippo Parodi Italian sculptor Baroque of the Genoese school, pupil of Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Active in Padua and Venice.
* &quot;Allegory of Envy&quot; by Giusto Le Court.
* Pair of Atlantis marble supporting a lintel chimney by Alessandro Vittoria (1525 -1608) a sculptor Mannerist of the Venetian school.
* A marble bust of the Pope Innocent XI above the door.
* Busts of Democritus and Heraclitus by Giuseppe Torretti.
==Second floor galleries==
===Portego paintings===
The second (third, in U.S. use), or upper floor, contains a series of galleries displaying Venetian paintings and decorative arts from the 18th century. Several major paintings by Canaletto are on display, including &quot;Architectural Caprice&quot; and two views of the Grand Canal, painted in 1719-20 during his youth. They marked the beginning of his famous series of Venice scenes. They were purchased for the museum by the City of Venice in 1983. Another large-scale depiction of the port &quot;The festival of Saint Martha&quot; by Gaspare Diziani, is also on display, along with several celebrated scenes of life in Venice during the period by Francesco Guardi.
===Parlor Room===
The Parlor Hall takes its name from Francesco Guardi&#x27;s painting: &quot;The Parlor of the Nuns at San Zaccaria&quot; (1740-1745) exhibited in the hall with |&quot; The Foyer of Dandolo&#x27;s palace in San Moisè&quot;. The fresco of the ceiling entitled: Conjugal Concorde crowned by Virtue in the presence of Justice, Prudence, Temperance, Fame, Abundance is a work of Costantino Cedini (Padua, 1741 - Venice, 1811), member of the Guild of the painters of Venice and professor at the Academy of Fine Arts of Venice. The fresco was originally in the palace Nani in Cannaregio. It was transferred in the 1930s to its current location. The frame surrounding the fresco is older than a century ago and is due to the quadraturist Antonio Felice Ferrari (1667 - 1720).
Other Venetian artists whose works can be seen on this floor include Cima da Conegliano, Alvise Vivarini, Bonifacio de&#x27; Pitati; Tintoretto, Schiavone, the Bassano family, Paolo Fiammingo, Lambert Sustris; Padovanino and Carpinoni, Pietro Vecchia, Giovanni Segala, Palma il Giovane, Bernardo Strozzi, Francesco Maffei, Giovan Battista Langetti, Pietro Liberi; Balestra, Niccolò Bambini, Piazzetta, Nicola Grassi, Pietro Longhi, Rosalba Carriera, Sebastiano and Marco Ricci, Pellegrini, Amigoni, Antonio Marini, Zuccarelli, Zais, Giuseppe Bernardino Bison, Natale Schiavoni, Ippolito Caffi, Mancini, and Emma Ciardi.

===Frescos from Villa Zianigo===
A section on the second floor contains rooms with of frescos by Giandomenico Tiepolo, son of Giambattista Tiepolo, which were originally in the Villa Zianigo, near Mirano.

;The hallway
In the corridor leading to the hall, on the left wall, a scene of the liberated Jerusalem of the Cup: &quot;Renaud who abandons the Garden of Armida&quot; by Giandomenico Tiepolo, who was on the ground floor of the villa from Zianigo. On the right wall of the vestibule two canvases of Nicolò Bambini: &quot;Achilles and the girls of Licomede&quot; and &quot;The Sabines&#x27; kidnapping&quot;; overcoming these two canvases &quot;The Apotheosis of Venice&quot; by Francesco Fontebasso; on the right, an &quot;Allegory of Summer&quot;; on the back wall: &quot;Falcon chasing a flock of sparrows on the run&quot; by Giandomenico Tiepolo.
Pulcinella was a standard character in Italian Commedia dell&#x27;arte since the 17th century, a figure for ridicule and satire; he wore a tall white hat and gown, a mask, and carried a club or long forks. The frescos were begun in about 1759, and illustrate the stories of Pulcinella in various comic or satiric scenes. They were originally made by the elder Tiepolo for his own country house. They were finished in about 1797.
Another important Tiepolo work is displayed in tho section; the &quot;New World&quot;; a long fresco in the corridor which was originally on the ground floor of the Villa Zianigo, depicting a line of Venetians, including one in a Pulcinella costume with a long a fork, waiting to look into a magic lantern presentation, &quot;Promenade&quot; is said to show Tiepolo himself, to the right, looking at the scene ironically through his eyeglass. On the opposite wall are two more scenes, &quot;Promenade&quot; and &quot;Minuet&quot;, showing, also in a certain ironic vein, Venetian aristocrats dancing and promenading.

The Pulcinella Room, in this section, contains a group of three frescoes by Giandomenico Tiepolo from the Villa, called &quot;Pulcinella in Love&quot;, &quot;Pulcinella and the Saltimboques&quot;, and the &quot;Departure of Pulcinella&quot;. The round fresco on the ceiling depicts Pulcinella seen from below walking across a tightrope. These paintings were made between 1793 and 1797 at the Villa Zianigo, at the time of the first occupation of Venice by the French, and the beginning of downfall of the Venetian Republic, and its particular style of life and art.

The Pulicinella section contains two more rooms, the Cabinet of the Centaurs and the Cabinet of Satyrs, with monochromatic scenes by Giandomenico Tiepolo of themes and creatures. The ceiling of the Cabinet of Centaurs has a red monochrome meed image called &quot;Rhapsody&quot;, which is said to be a tribute to the poet Homer, along with medallions and images of mythological scenes and creatures. On the ceiling is a large rectangular painting of &quot;Scenes from Roman History&quot;, and, over the doors, more images of both male and female satyrs.

The Chapel is a room which displays paintings by Giandomenico Tiepolo for the chapel of the Villa Zianigo, which was consecrated in 1758. The paintings are signed by Tiepolo with the date 1759. The main figure in the paintings is Saint Jerome Émilien, depicted with handcuffs to represent his imprisonment in 1511 by soldiers of the Holy Roman Empire, and his liberation, according to the legend, through the intervention of the Virgin Mary.

===Antonio Guardi Room===
Commissioned by Maria Barbarigo Savorgnan from the painter Antonio Guardi, the frescoes of this room were covered with plaster during the nineteenth century and found during a restoration of the Palace Barbarigo Dabalà in 1936. Detached and mounted they were transferred to Ca&#x27; Rezzonico. They are three in number: &quot;Minerva&quot;; &quot;Venus and Love before Vulcan&#x27;s forge&quot;; and &quot;Apollo&quot;. The frescoes were framed with plasterwork. These restored frescoes are the only examples of this type of work by Guardi. The &quot;Veiled Lady&quot;, represents the allegory of Purity, is the work of the Venetian sculptor Antonio Corradini, who was known for his depiction of figures under veils.

===Longhi Hall===
The paintings in this room offer the opportunity to compare two different trends in the Venetian painting school of the Eighteenth century: vivid, sensual, rococo, visible in the allegorical and mythological works of Giambattista Tiepolo, with a ceiling, &quot;zephyr and Flore&quot; ironic and the critical spirit of the Venetian Lights, visible in the paintings of Pietro Longhi hanging on the walls. The canvas of Tiepolo, painted in the 1730s for Ca&#x27; Pesaro, is part of the beginnings of his work. The joint presence of Zephyr, one of the four winds, and Flore is a reference to spring, so to fertility. The colors are bright and transparent. The artist has virtually drawn sensual flesh tones and accentuated color contrasts. Pietro Longhi&#x27;s series of paintings on the walls depict scenes from everyday life; a visit to a painting studio, a hairdresser at work, scenes of family and family life, concerts, events and entertainment. Longhi appears in them as an insightful observer of forms and ways of life, submitting in detail the empty habits and pompous weaknesses of his heroes and their world. He distinguishes himself by presenting house interiors as, to a certain extent, by Canaletto with his vedute.

===Green lacquer room===
The decoration of this piece (&quot;Sala delle Lacche Verdi&quot;) is a set of furniture painted green and gold, called &quot;Salotto Calbo-Crotta&quot; with chinoiserie motifs, very popular in Venetian eighteenth century. The set comes from Palazzo Calbo Crotta in Cannaregio. On the ceiling of the hall is the fresco of Giovanni Antonio Guardi&#x27;s triumph of Diana, from the Barbarigo-Dabalà palace to Angelo Raffaele. The allegorico-mythological work, created in the 1850s, is a perfect example of the talent of the artist in the style of rock, bright and full of fantasy. The walls of the room are decorated with vedute and landscapes.
* &quot;Landscape with monks and travelers&quot; and &quot;Landscape with mill and laundress&quot; by Marco Ricci, Italian vedute engraver and painter. Main initiator Venetian landscape in the eighteenth century.
* &quot;Caprice with an arch&quot; and &quot;Caprice with the fountain of Neptune&quot; by Luca Carlevarijs.
* &quot;Landscape with marine&quot; and &quot;Landscape with a caravan&quot; by Johann Anton Eismann, an Austrian painter born in Salzburg and active in Verona and Venice. He mainly painted scenes of port and battle genre. He died in Venice in 1698.
* &quot;Landscape with a waterfall&quot; and &quot;Landscape with a marine&quot; by Jacob de Heusch, Dutch painter of the golden century. He is known for his paintings of Italian landscapes.
* From Giuseppe Zais, already met in other rooms: &quot;Landscape&quot;, &quot;Landscape with shepherds&quot;, &quot;Landscape with milking&quot;
==Third Floor and mezzanine: Martini Collection and Mestrovich Collection==
The third and top floor (second floor in U.S. usage) has a recreation of an 18th-century Venetian pharmacy, which was reconstituted in 1936 with original materials from a pharmacy of the period. It also includes an art gallery devoted to the collection of 264 paintings of collector Egidio Martini, including works from the 15th to the end of the 19th century by the major Venetian masters. It occupies nearly the entire third floor. It includes important works by Bernardo Strozzi, Francesco Maffei, Pietro Vecchia, the Tiepolos father and son, Giambattista Piazzetta, Gaspare Diziani, and other major Venetian masters.

The mezzanine, reached by the stairway to the ground floor, contains another gallery displaying the Mestrovich Collection, by Ferrucio Mestrovich, whose family lived in Dalmatia, and who emigrated to Venice in 1945. He donated his collection to the museum in December 2001 and October 2009. It consists of about thirty paintings from the 15th to 20th century. It includes major works by Jacopo Tintoretto and Bonifazio Veronese, among others.

Other major works that can be seen on the top floor include the historical &quot;The Death of Darius&quot; by Giovanni Battista Piazzetta; and a collection of three portraits by Pietro Bellotti. Also represented in the museum collection, with a pastel, is the Venetian artist Maria Molin.

<doc id="1010807" wikidata="Q912068" url="?curid=1010807" title="Wu (state)">
<text>Wu () was a state during the Western Zhou dynasty and the Spring and Autumn period, outside the Zhou cultural sphere. It was also known as Gouwu () or Gongwu () from the pronunciation of the local language. Wu was located at the mouth of the Yangtze River east of the State of Chu and south of the State of Qi. Its first capital was at Meili (梅里, in modern Wuxi), then Helü&#x27;s City (闔閭, in present-day Xueyan town near Wuxi), and later moved to Gusu (姑蘇, probably in modern Suzhou).

==History==
A founding myth of Wu, first recorded by Sima Qian in the Han dynasty, traced its royal lineage to Taibo, a relative of King Wen of Zhou. According to the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, Taibo was the oldest son of Gugong Danfu and the elder uncle of King Wen who started the Zhou dynasty. Gugong Danfu had three sons named Taibo, Zhongyong, and Jili. Taibo was the oldest of three brothers, Jili being the youngest. Realizing that his youngest brother, Jili, was favored by his father to inherit the throne of Predynastic Zhou, the older brothers Taibo and Zhongyong left Zhou to avoid conflict and settled southeast to Wu with a group of followers loyal to him and his brother Zhongyong. They established their first capital at Meili (), believed to be today&#x27;s Meicun in Wuxi. Taibo&#x27;s youngest brother Jili who was eventually the heir of the throne became the father of King Wen, who is attributed to starting the Zhou dynasty.

Little is known about the history of Wu before the Spring and Autumn period. Wu rose to power in the 6th century BC, after it was aided by the State of Jin as a useful ally against the State of Chu.

In 584 BC, Wu rebelled against Chu upon the advice of Wuchen, a Jin minister, who defected from Chu. From then on, Wu would become a constant threat to the Chu Kingdom. Wu planted seeds of rebellion amongst Chu&#x27;s vassals along the Yangtze valley. Wu Zixu, a highly influential Chu politician&#x27;s father and brother was murdered by King Ping of Chu and fled to Wu plotting revenge. Wu Zixu later became a trusted advisor of Prince Guang and helped him assassinate his cousin King Liao of Wu and usurp the throne. After the successful assassination of King Liao, Prince Guang ascended the throne and became known as King Helü of Wu.
In 506 BC, during the reign of King Zhao of Chu, King Helü decided to invade Chu. The king personally led the army, along with his younger brother Fugai, Wu Zixu, as well as Sun Tzu, author of &quot;The Art of War&quot;. Although Chu had a strong army led by Nang Wa and Shen Yinshu, it suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of Boju. King Zhao of Chu fled to Sui and the Wu army captured Ying, Chu&#x27;s capital. After entering Ying, Wu Zixu exhumed King Ping&#x27;s corpse, and gave it 300 lashes to exact vengeance on for his father and brother who were murdered by the Chu King. The military victory led to Wu Zixu&#x27;s elevation to Duke of Shen and his alias Shenxu. After these victories, Wu briefly became the most powerful state and turned to other campaigns, defeating the State of Qi in 484 BC.

King Helü of Wu is considered to be one of the Five Hegemons of China during the Spring and Autumn period due to his military successes at this time with the help of his famous commander/strategist Sun Tzu. Wu is also generally regarded as developing the first Chinese Navy. This navy was quite complex and had different classes of ships. Its &quot;classes&quot; of ships were the great wing (&quot;da yi&quot; - 大翼), the little wing (&quot;xiao yi&quot; - 小翼), the stomach striker (&quot;tu wei&quot; - 突冒), the castle ship (&quot;lou chuan&quot; - 楼船), and the bridge ship (&quot;qiao chuan&quot; - 桥船). These were listed in the &quot;Yuejueshu&quot; (越绝书 - &quot;Lost Records of the State of Yue&quot;) as a written dialogue between King Helü of Wu (r. 514 BC–496 BC) and Wu Zixu (526 BC–484 BC) in which the latter stated:
Nowadays in training naval forces we use the tactics of land forces for the best effect. Thus great wing ships correspond to the army&#x27;s heavy chariots, little wing ships to light chariots, stomach strikers to battering rams, castle ships to mobile assault towers, and bridge ships to light cavalry.


Ironically, Wu was later threatened by an upstart state to its own south, Yue; Chu then aided Yue&#x27;s rise as a counter to Wu. Although Wu won majority of battles against the Yue and captured their King Goujian, Wu failed to completely subjugate Yue, in part because of Fuchai&#x27;s willingness to let King Goujian live in Wu as his servant. King Goujian suffered for years as Fuchai&#x27;s servant/slave and planned his revenge. Fuchai under the promise of peace, let Goujian return to Yue, his homeland which later proved to be a fatal mistake for Wu. While Wu was engaged in a military campaign in the north, Goujian enacted his revenge and launched a surprise attack on Wu in 482 BC and conquered the capital. Over the next decade, Wu was unable to recover and Yue absorbed the state in 473 BC.

Wu, Yue, and Chu all proclaimed themselves kings in the 6th century BC, showing the drastic weakening of the Zhou court&#x27;s authority during the Spring and Autumn period.

Wu and Yue were masters of metallurgy, fabricating excellent swords with incised messages, geometric patterns, and inlaid gold or silver. Wu and Yue swords tend to use much more tin than copper compared to those of other states. Wu often sent swords as gifts to northern states, such as Qi and Cai. Examples include the spearhead of King Fuchai and the sword of Prince Guang.

==Kings of Wu family tree==
Chinese historical texts linked the kings of Wu to Taibo, the uncle of King Wen of Zhou. Their ancestral name was Ji and their clan name was Gufa. The last king of Wu, King Fuchai had at least four sons, three of whom were named You, Hong and Hui. You was his heir but was killed in one of the battles leading to the defeat of Wu, and Hong became the new heir. After the collapse of the state, the other three sons of Fuchai were exiled. Themselves, their blood relatives and descendants took Wu as their clan name in honor of their fallen kingdom.

==Culture==

The &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; states that the people in Wu wore their hair short and sported tattoos. For Sima Qian this would have illustrated their supposed barbarism, as in his time Chinese men and women were not allowed to cut their hair or otherwise modify their body - doing so was considered an offence against the ancestors from which one had inherited one&#x27;s physical features.

Wu rulers did not receive posthumous names after death.

===Literature===
The famed military strategist Sun Tzu, renowned for his military treatise &quot;The Art of War&quot;, served as a general under King Helü of Wu.

===Languages===
The rulers of Wu are said to be descendants of early Zhou; however, the indigenous language of the Wu region is distinct from Old Chinese spoken by central Chinese states. Historians have attempted to link the language with Austronesian languages, Kra–Dai or a non-Chinese Sino-Tibetan language. A substrate of Daic languages has been detected in Wu dialects.

==Legacy==
&quot;Wu&quot; continues to be used as a name for the region around Suzhou and Shanghai and their regional speech, Wu Chinese. It was employed by other states and princes holding power in the region, most notably Eastern Wu of the Three Kingdoms, and Wu and Wuyue of the Ten Kingdoms.

===Connections with Japan===
Ambassadorial visits to Japan by the later Chinese dynasties Wei and Jin recorded that the Wajin of Japan claimed to be descendants of Taibo of Wu, traditionally believed to be the mythical founder of Wu. Several scholars suggest that the Yamato people and the Imperial House of Japan are descendants of the Wu and possibly Taibo. Many Japanese historians also link the early Japanese Yayoi people to the Baiyue tribes.

===Wu in astronomy===
Wu, together with Yue, is represented with the star Zeta Aquilae in asterism &quot;Left Wall&quot;, Heavenly Market enclosure (see Chinese constellations).
