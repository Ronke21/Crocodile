<text>The Trinidad and Tobago national football team, nicknamed the &quot;Soca Warriors&quot;, represents the twin-island Republic of Trinidad and Tobago in international football. It is controlled by the Trinidad and Tobago Football Association, which is a member of CONCACAF (the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football), the Caribbean Football Union (CFU), and the global jurisdiction of FIFA.

The national team competes in the World Cup, Gold Cup, and the Nations League, as well as other competitions by invitation. The Soca Warriors&#x27; lone appearance at the FIFA World Cup came in 2006, after the team defeated Bahrain 2–1 on aggregate in the CONCACAF–AFC intercontinental play-off. The team has qualified for the CONCACAF Gold Cup on 18 occasions with their best performance in 2000, after reaching the semi-finals, finishing third. However, the national team did experience great success at the defunct Caribbean Cup, having won the sub-continental competition ten times and runners-up on seven occasions.

The separate Trinidad and Tobago national football teams are not related to the national team and are not directly affiliated with the game&#x27;s governing bodies of FIFA or CONCACAF, but are affiliated with the Trinidad and Tobago Football Association.

==History==

===1970s===
At the 1973 CONCACAF Championship, Trinidad and Tobago fell two points short of qualifying for the 1974 World Cup in controversial fashion. Trinidad and Tobago lost a crucial game on 4 December 1973 against hosts Haiti 2–1 after being denied five goals. The referee, José Roberto Henríquez of El Salvador, and Canadian linesman James Higuet were subsequently banned for life by FIFA for the dubious events of the match.

===1980s to 1990s: The Strike Squad===
Trinidad and Tobago came within one game of qualifying for the 1990 World Cup in Italy. Nicknamed the &quot;Strike Squad&quot; during the qualifying campaign, Trinidad and Tobago needed only a draw to qualify in their final game played at home against the United States on 19 November 1989. In front of an over-capacity crowd of more than 30,000 at the National Stadium on &quot;Red Day&quot;, Paul Caligiuri of the United States scored the only goal of the game in the 38th minute dashing Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s qualification hopes. For the good behaviour of the crowd at the stadium, despite the devastating loss and overcrowded stands, the spectators of Trinidad and Tobago were awarded the FIFA Fair Play Award in 1989.

===2000s===

====2006 FIFA World Cup====

Trinidad and Tobago qualified for the 2006 World Cup in Germany, its first-ever qualification for the tournament. During their qualifying campaign, they sat at the bottom of the table in the final round of qualifying with one point from three. However, after the arrival of Leo Beenhakker as team coach and the recalling of veteran players Dwight Yorke and Russell Latapy, Trinidad and Tobago reversed its fortunes and placed fourth in the group. They qualified via a play-off against Bahrain, recovering from a 1–1 draw at home to win 1–0 in Manama, Bahrain to book a place in the finals. As a result, Trinidad and Tobago became the smallest country to qualify for the FIFA World Cup, a record they held until Iceland reached their first World Cup in 2018.

In Germany, Trinidad and Tobago were grouped with England, Sweden and Paraguay in Group B.They played their initial game, drawing 0–0 against Sweden, even though they were reduced to ten men early in the second half. They faced losses in their remaining matches against England and Paraguay, each by a 2–0 margin.

===2010s===

====2010 World Cup Cycle====
Trinidad and Tobago began their campaign in the second round against Bermuda. Trinidad and Tobago lost the first match 2–1 at home, but bounced back to win the away leg 2–0 to progress to the third round 3–2 on aggregate. The Soca Warriors entered Group 1 alongside the United States, Guatemala, and Cuba. They then progressed to the Hexagonal round, finishing second in the group with eleven points from six games. There they faced Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico and the United States. The group began badly for Trinidad and Tobago as they drew 2–2 with El Salvador after leading 2–0, and then drew 1–1 with Honduras. Three consecutive losses, to the United States, Costa Rica and Mexico, put the Soca Warriors in last place with two points from five matches. After defeating El Salvador 1–0, they suffered further losses to Honduras and the United States the following month, ending their hopes of qualifying, and they eventually finished bottom of the group.

====2014 World Cup Cycle====
Trinidad and Tobago entered qualification for the 2014 World Cup in the second round as a seeded team, with Guyana, Bermuda and Barbados also drawn in Group B. The Soca Warriors defeated Bermuda (1–0) and Barbados (2–0) in their first two matches. However, on 7 October 2011, they lost away to Bermuda in Devonshire Parish 2–1. The team recovered four days later by defeating Barbados 4–0 in the Hasely Crawford Stadium with a hat-trick from Lester Peltier. Entering the final two matches in the Second Round, Trinidad and Tobago were in second place, behind Guyana by one point. As only the group winners would advance to the third round, the Soca Warriors needed to take four points in the two matches against Guyana to advance. Trinidad and Tobago first traveled to Providence, Guyana to face the Golden Jaguars on 11 November 2011. With an early goal from Ricky Shakes and another from Leon Cort in the 81st minute, Trinidad and Tobago trailed 2–0 and faced elimination. Kenwyne Jones pull a goal back in the 93rd minute, but the match ended 2–1 to Guyana. On 12 January 2012, Otto Pfister was sacked after the country&#x27;s earliest exit from World Cup qualification since 1994.

====2018 World Cup Cycle====
Trinidad and Tobago entered qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in the fourth round and were drawn into Group C with Guatemala, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and the United States. The team finished second in the group with 11 points to qualify for the Hexagonal. However, they finished in sixth place in the final round with only six points, even though they eliminated the United States from World Cup contention with a 2–1 victory in the final match.

====2022 World Cup Cycle====

Trinidad and Tobago entered qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in the first round and were drawn into Group F with Saint Kitts and Nevis, Puerto Rico, Bahamas, and Guyana. The team finished second in the group with 8 points and failed to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

====2026 World Cup Cycle====

Trinidad and Tobago entered qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the second round and were drawn into Group B with Saint Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, Bahamas, and Costa Rica.

===Home stadium===
For the first eighty years of their existence, Trinidad and Tobago played their home matches all around the country with Queen&#x27;s Park Oval, generally thought of as the most picturesque and largest of the old cricket grounds in the West Indies, as the most often used venue. The cricket ground served as the country&#x27;s largest stadium until the new National Stadium was built in Mucurapo, Port of Spain, to host the nation&#x27;s athletics competitions and international football matches.

The stadium later was renovated and renamed after Hasely Crawford, the first person from Trinidad and Tobago to win an Olympic gold medal, prior to Trinidad and Tobago hosting the 2001 FIFA U-17 World Championship. The stadium currently has a seating capacity of 23,000 and is owned by the Trinidad and Tobago government and managed through the Ministry of Sport via its special purpose state agency called SporTT.

In recent years, the TTFA have hosted matches at the smaller 10,000 seat Ato Boldon Stadium in Couva, citing a problem with the lighting system at Hasely Crawford Stadium, lower expenses for matches at Ato Boldon, and fans being seated closer to the pitch. Trinidad and Tobago hosted two games during &quot;The Hex&quot; in late 2017. They lost to Honduras 1–2 on 1 September 2017. On 10 October 2017, Trinidad and Tobago defeated the United States 2–1, causing the United States to fail to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1986. Ato Boldon Stadium has since hosted friendlies against Grenada, Guyana, and Panama.

===Supporters===

The major supporters&#x27; group for the national team is the Soca Warriors Supporters Club or the &quot;Warrior Nation&quot;. The group is a non-profit organisation that is independent of the Trinidad and Tobago Football Association. Formed shortly after Trinidad and Tobago secured qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the supporters&#x27; club was organised by Soca Warriors Online founder Inshan Mohammed and Nigel Myers.

The group&#x27;s activities include promoting teams locally and globally, lobbying the Trinidad and Tobago Football Association as representatives of football fans, advocating fair pricing and allocation of event tickets, organising travel for fans to home and away matches, providing a family-oriented fans&#x27; organisation, and promoting football among the young people of Trinidad and Tobago.

<doc id="1014733" wikidata="Q4899314" url="?curid=1014733" title="Bev Desjarlais">
<text>Beverly Faye Desjarlais (née Nowoselsky; August 19, 1955 – March 15, 2018) was a Canadian politician. She represented the Manitoba electoral district of Churchill in the House of Commons of Canada from 1997 to 2006, initially as a New Democrat and later as an Independent after losing her party&#x27;s nomination in late 2005. She had lost the confidence of the NDP after she voted against the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot;, legalizing same-sex marriage in Canada. She later worked as a departmental aide to Conservative Veterans Affairs Minister Greg Thompson.

Her ex-husband, Bob Desjarlais, was a prominent labour leader in northern Manitoba, who campaigned for Mayor of Thompson in 2006.

==Early life and career==
Desjarlais was born in Regina, Saskatchewan. She graduated from Bert Fox Composite High School in 1973, and held several positions at the General Hospital in Thompson, Manitoba, over the next twenty-four years. At the time of her election, she was a ward clerk. Desjarlais was also a union steward with the United Food and Commercial Workers and a member of Canadian Parents for French.

Her political career began in 1992, when she was elected as a trustee for the Mystery Lake School Division. She became Chair of the Board in 1994, and served until her election to Parliament in 1997.

==Member of Parliament==
===New Democratic Party MP===
Desjarlais challenged Liberal incumbent Elijah Harper for the Churchill riding in the 1997 federal election. Although Harper had gained national fame in 1990 for blocking passage of the Meech Lake Accord (while he was serving as the NDP member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for Rupertsland), he was not a prominent Member of Parliament. Desjarlais won by 2,764 votes and joined twenty other New Democrats on the opposition benches. Her opposition to the Canadian gun registry was likely a contributing factor to her victory, as the registry was unpopular in rural Manitoba.

She held several official responsibilities in the 36th Canadian Parliament, including serving as her party&#x27;s critic for housing and the Treasury Board of Canada. In the latter capacity, she was a prominent supporter of pay equity policies to benefit Canadian women. Desjarlais was also chosen as her party&#x27;s representative on the Commons Transport Committee, and held this position for several years. She defeated Harper again in the 2000 election, and NDP leader Alexa McDonough appointed her to be the party&#x27;s Industry Critic in the following parliament.

In 2001, she participated in a military training exercise to educate parliamentarians about the Canadian Forces. Desjarlais joined the Canadian Air Force for a week, and participated in a search and rescue exercise in Northern Ontario. She later supported fellow Manitoba MP Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign to become NDP leader in 2002–03. Blaikie finished second against Jack Layton.

Desjarlais was re-elected in the 2004 election over a strong challenge from Liberal candidate and First Nations leader Ron Evans. After the election, she was named NDP critic for Transport, Crown Corporations, and the Canadian Wheat Board in the 38th Canadian Parliament. In early 2005, former Assembly of First Nations National Chief Ovide Mercredi announced that he would challenge Desjarlais for the NDP nomination in Churchill. He later withdrew the challenge.

===Policy views===
Desjarlais was one of the most socially conservative members of the federal NDP, and when in caucus was its most socially conservative member. She was the only New Democrat to vote against the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; (Bill C-38), which legalized same-sex marriage in Canada, on its third and final reading in 2005. Her position placed her in conflict with both official NDP policy and party leader Jack Layton, who described same-sex marriage as a human rights issue and ruled that caucus members would not be permitted a free vote on matters of equality.

Desjarlais argued that her position was based on personal religious convictions and was not grounded in homophobia. She acknowledged as early as 2003 that opposing same-sex marriage was contrary to NDP policy, and accepted that &quot;discipline may take place&quot; as a result. She was stripped of her shadow cabinet posts after the 2005 vote.

On other issues, her views were closer to official NDP policy. She was a strong defender of the rights of labour and public health care and supported the principle of aboriginal self-government.

===Independent MP===
On October 17, 2005, Desjarlais lost the Churchill NDP nomination to Niki Ashton, daughter of Manitoba cabinet minister Steve Ashton, in a vote of the membership of the Churchill NDP riding association. She resigned from the NDP caucus on the same day and announced she would run as an Independent in the next federal election, which took place on January 23, 2006 after Prime Minister Paul Martin&#x27;s government lost a vote of confidence. She acknowledged that her position on same-sex marriage was a prominent factor in her defeat.

Desjarlais was endorsed on January 5, 2006 by Vote Marriage Canada, a group which opposes same-sex marriage. She finished third, behind Ashton and winning Liberal candidate (and &quot;North of 60&quot; star) Tina Keeper.

==After defeat==
After her defeat, Desjarlais took a job in Ottawa in the office of Greg Thompson, Minister of Veterans&#x27; Affairs in the Conservative government of Stephen Harper. The reaction from her former NDP colleagues was mixed. Caucus Chair Judy Wasylycia-Leis described her decision as &quot;mind-boggling and very disappointing&quot;, and commented that it was &quot;hard to understand how Bev could have gone from being an active New Democrat to actually supporting and upholding the Stephen Harper agenda&quot;. Veterans Affairs critic Peter Stoffer said that Desjarlais had always worked well with MPs of all parties and that she and Thompson would &quot;work well together&quot;.

She died in Brandon, Manitoba on March 15, 2018.

<text>Monotype Imaging Holdings Inc., founded as Lanston Monotype Machine Company in 1887 in Philadelphia by Tolbert Lanston, is an American (historically Anglo-American) company that specializes in digital typesetting and typeface design for use with consumer electronics devices. Based in Woburn, Massachusetts, the company has been responsible for many developments in printing technology—in particular the Monotype machine, which was a fully mechanical hot metal typesetter, that produced texts automatically, all single type. Monotype was involved in the design and production of many typefaces in the 20th century. Monotype developed many of the most widely used typeface designs, including Times New Roman, Gill Sans, Arial, Bembo and Albertus.

Via acquisitions including Linotype GmbH, International Typeface Corporation, Bitstream, FontShop, URW, Hoefler &amp; Co., Fontsmith, and Colophon Foundry, the company has gained the rights to major font families including Helvetica, ITC Franklin Gothic, Optima, ITC Avant Garde, Palatino, FF DIN and Gotham. It also owns MyFonts, used by many independent font design studios. The company is owned by HGGC, a private equity firm.

==History==

===Monotype System===
The Lanston Monotype Machine Company was founded by Tolbert Lanston in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1887. Lanston had a patented mechanical method of punching out metal types from cold strips of metal which were set (hence &quot;typesetting&quot;) into a matrix for the printing press. In 1896, Lanston patented the first hot metal typesetting machine and Monotype issued Modern Condensed, its first typeface. The licenses for the Lanston type library have been acquired by P22, a digital type foundry based in Buffalo, New York.

In a search for funding, the company set up a branch in London around 1897 under the name Lanston Monotype Corporation Ltd, generally known as the Monotype Corporation. In 1899, a new factory was built in Salfords near Redhill in Surrey where it has been located for over a century. The company was of sufficient size to justify the construction of its own Salfords railway station.

The Monotype machine worked by casting letters from &quot;hot metal&quot; (molten metal) as pieces of type. Thus spelling mistakes could be corrected by adding or removing individual letters. This was particularly useful for &quot;quality&quot; printing - such as books. In contrast, the Linotype machine—a direct competitor—formed a complete line of type in one bar. Editing these required replacing an entire line (and if the replacement ran onto another line, the rest of the paragraph). But Linotype slugs were easier to handle if moving a complete section of text around a page. This was more useful for &quot;quick&quot; printing - such as newspapers.

The typesetting machines were continually improved in the early years of the 20th century, with a typewriter style keyboard for entering the type being introduced in 1906. This arrangement addressed the need to vary the space between words so that all lines were the same length.

The keyboard operator types the copy, each key punching holes in a roll of paper tape that will control the separate caster. A drum on the keyboard indicates to the operator the space required for each line. This information is also punched in the paper. Before fitting the tape to the caster it is turned over so that the first holes read on each line set the width of the variable space. The subsequent holes determine the position of a frame, or die case, that holds the set of matrices for the face being used. Each matrix is a rectangle of bronze recessed with the shape of the letter. Once the matrix is positioned over the mould that forms the body of the type being cast, molten type metal is injected.

To promote its image, the company ran a magazine, the &quot;Monotype Recorder&quot;, over most of the twentieth century, and also ran a compositor (typesetter operator) training school in London. In 1936, the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange and became the Monotype Corporation Ltd. Board members of the company included future Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, Vice-Chairman, and other businessmen connected to publishing.

===Typefounding===

Monotype&#x27;s role in design history is not merely due to their supply of printing equipment but due to their commissioning of many of the most important typefaces of the twentieth century.

The company&#x27;s first face, issued in 1896, was a rather generic design, now named &quot;Modern&quot;, influenced by Bodoni and Scotch Roman designs. However, by the 1920s, the company&#x27;s British branch was well known for commissioning popular, historically influenced designs that revived some of the best typefaces of the past, with particular attention to the early period of printing from the Renaissance to the late eighteenth century. This series of releases was a major part of the typographic renaissance of the period, an expansion of the Arts and Crafts movement interest in printing into the more workaday world of general-purpose printing. Key executives of the company in this period included historian and adviser Stanley Morison, publicity manager Beatrice Warde, engineering expert Frank Hinman Pierpont and draughtsman Fritz Stelzer (the latter two both recruited from the German printing industry, although Pierpont was American), under managing director William Isaac Burch, who led the company from 1924 to 1942. Despite tensions within the company, particularly between the historically minded faction of Morison and Warde and Pierpont in Salfords, notable typefaces commissioned included Gill Sans, Times New Roman and Perpetua, and the company maintained high standards of development allowing it to produce designs with good spacing, careful adaptation of the same basic design to different sizes and even color on the page, essential qualities for balanced body text.

Historian James Mosley, who worked closely with Monotype in the 1950s and onwards, has commented:The English Monotype Corporation of the interwar years looks in retrospect rather like one of the great public bodies of the period, for example the British Broadcasting Corporation or London Transport... benevolent monopolies ruled by autocrats who revelled in the role of patron of the arts on a scale exceeding that of Italian Renaissance princes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monotype enjoyed, in Britain at least, something approaching a monopoly in book and better-quality magazine typesetting.. .Monotype exploited the glamor of its new typefaces... with brilliant publicity, for which Morison and his devoted young American recruit Beatrice Warde were partly responsible.

The American branch lagged behind the British in artistic reputation. Their designs are now often rather obscure, since (unlike products from the British branch) few have been made widely available through bundling with Microsoft products. The company employed Frederic Goudy on several serif font projects which were well received at the time, and on staff type designer Sol Hess, who created the geometric sans-serif Twentieth Century as a competitor to the German Futura.

===Decline===
Monotype entered a decline from the 1960s onwards. This was caused by the reduction in use of hot metal typesetting and replacement with phototypesetting and lithography in mass-market printing. This offered considerable efficiencies, such as no need to print books from solid metal type, quicker setting of type and a reduced number of operators needed. It also promised a more diverse and exciting range of fonts than that possible with hot metal, where it is necessary to own life-size matrices for every size of every font to be used.

Monotype made the transition to cold type and began to market its own &quot;Monophoto&quot; phototypesetting systems, but these suffered from problems. Its first devices were heavily based on hot metal machinery, with glass pictures of characters which would be reproduced on photographic paper replacing the matrices used to cast metal type. While this reduced the need for retraining, the resulting devices often set type slowly compared to legacy-free next-generation devices from providers such as Photon and Compugraphic, and were often more expensive. Its devices were slow to incorporate use of electronics, and while its type library was of high quality, changing tastes and the development of other companies&#x27; libraries competed with this. Its type library was also easily pirated, since fonts have only limited copyright protection. The company was eventually split into three divisions: Monotype International, which manufactured spinning mirror switched laser beam phototypesetters; Monotype Limited, which continued the hot metal machines; and Monotype Typography, which designed and sold typefaces. A research and development department was set up in Cambridge to isolate it from day to day production issues.

Monotype in the UK continued to enjoy prestige through the 1970s with the patronage of major British printers such as the university presses at Oxford and Cambridge; it also enjoyed some success with its Lasercomp laser-based typesetting system from the 1970s onwards, developed by the Cambridge research group. However, new technology and finally publishing software such as Quark XPress and Aldus PageMaker running on general-purpose computers ate away at its competitiveness in the market of complete typesetting solutions by the 1990s.

Monotype, however, has continued in business, for instance marketing typeface designs to third-party buyers, computing companies such as Microsoft (many fonts on Microsoft computers in particular are Monotype-designed) and companies and organisations such as London Transport and the UK parliament requiring custom digital typefaces. Much of its metal type equipment and archives were donated to the Type Museum collection in London; other materials are held at St Bride Library.

The history and decline of the hot metal American Lanston Monotype Corporation is described in full detail by Richard L. Hopkins, in &quot;Tolbert Lanston and the Monotype. The origin of digital Typesetting&quot;. In 2004, P22 type foundry bought the &quot;Lanston Type Co.&quot; from Gerald Giampa.

===Consolidation, reorganization, and expansion===
In 1992, The Monotype Corporation Ltd. appointed Administrative Receivers on 5 March and four days later Monotype Typography Ltd. was established. Cromas Holdings, an investment company based in Switzerland, bought the Monotype Corporation Ltd. and Monotype Inc. (excluding Monotype Typography) and five other direct subsidiary companies in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Singapore. Monotype Systems Ltd. was the adopted name for the new organization with Peter Purdy as Chairman, the name Monotype was under license from Monotype Typography Ltd which retained the trademark Monotype. Monotype Systems Ltd. focused on selling pre-press software and hardware, raster image processors and workflow.

Cromas Holdings reorganized its publishing interests with the formation of the International Publishing Asset Holding Ltd. effectively controlling Monotype Systems Ltd., QED Technology Ltd., and GB Techniques Ltd.

The company acquired Berthold Communications; the UK subsidiary of the German composing equipment supplier.

In June 2002, Monotype Systems Limited was re-branded, IPA Systems Limited, as this marked the end of the existing trademark licence with Monotype Corporation. In the US Monotype Inc became alfaQuest Technologies Limited. Both companies still sell pre-press software and hardware.

In 1999, Agfa-Compugraphic acquired the company, which was renamed Agfa Monotype. In late 2004, after six years under the Agfa Corporation, the Monotype assets were acquired by TA Associates, a private equity investment firm based in Boston. The company was incorporated as Monotype Imaging, with a focus on the company&#x27;s traditional core competencies of typography and professional printing.

Monotype was the first company to produce a digital version of the handwritten Persian script, Persian Nasta&#x27;liq. A Chinese &quot;keyboard&quot; was developed to typeset Chinese characters; it consisted of a book with a stylus. As the pages were turned, the page number was detected electrically and this was combined with the position of the character selected by the stylus on a large grid.

In 2003, the company launched Fontwise, the first software to audit desktops for licensed and unlicensed (not necessarily illegal) fonts.

On 2 October 2006, the company acquired Linotype GmbH, a subsidiary of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen.

On 18 September 2006, the company acquired China Type Design Limited, a typeface design and production company based in Hong Kong. CTDL was responsible for developing Microsoft JhengHei, the default traditional Chinese interface font for Windows Vista. The deal also secured an exclusive relationship with Creative Calligraphy Center (CCC), a font production company in Zhuhai, China, with 30 production specialists.

On 11 December 2009, the company acquired Planetweb, a developer specialized in applications and development tools for embedded devices.

On 8 December 2010, the company acquired Ascender Corporation, a provider of fonts and font technologies used in computers, mobile devices, consumer electronics and software products.

In March 2012, the company acquired Bitstream Inc., a digital font retailer. The deal also gave Monotype ownership of the MyFonts font sale website used by many independent designers and its WhatTheFont recognition service.

On 15 July 2014, the company acquired FontShop, the last large independent digital font retailer.

In October 2019 Monotype changed ownership to HGGC, a private equity firm. A few months later, on January 27, 2020, the company added FontSmith, an independent London foundry, to its font catalog.

On May 18, 2020, Monotype made another major expansion by purchasing URW Type Foundry from Global Graphics plc. In late 2021 it continued its expansion by acquiring iconic New York company Hoefler &amp; Co. (created by Jonathan Hoefler in 1989), thus increasing its library with well-known fonts such as Gotham, Knockout, Mercury, Sentinel, Chronicle, Decimal, and Archer.

On 19 July 2023, Monotype acquired Japanese type foundry Fontworks.

On 4 May 2023, Monotype Corporation acquired 39 typefaces from the Font Bureau library, but not the company.

In 2024, Monotype acquired the rights to typefaces from US type foundry Sharp Type, but not the company.

<doc id="1014743" wikidata="Q4411278" url="?curid=1014743" title="Arabian riff">
<text>&quot;Arabian riff&quot;, also known as &quot;The Streets of Cairo&quot;, &quot;The Poor Little Country Maid&quot;, and &quot;the snake charmer song&quot;, is a well-known melody, published in different forms in the 19th century. Alternate titles for children&#x27;s songs using this melody include &quot;The Girls in France&quot; and &quot;The Southern Part of France&quot;.

== History ==
There is a clear resemblance between the riff and the French song &quot;Colin prend sa hotte&quot; (published by Christophe Ballard in 1719), whose first five notes are identical. &quot;Colin prend sa hotte&quot; appears to derive from the lost &quot;Kradoudja&quot;, an Algerian folk song of the 17th century.

A version of the riff was published in 1845 by Franz Hünten as &quot;Melodie Arabe&quot;. The melody was described as an &quot;Arabian Song&quot; in the &quot;La grande méthode complète de cornet à piston et de saxhorn par Arban&quot;, first published in 1864.

Sol Bloom, a showman (and later a U.S. congressman), published the song as the entertainment director of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in 1893. It included an attraction called &quot;A Street in Cairo&quot; produced by Gaston Akoun, which featured snake charmers, camel rides and a scandalous dancer known as Little Egypt. Songwriter James Thornton penned the words and music to his own version of this melody, &quot;Streets Of Cairo or The Poor Little Country Maid&quot;. Copyrighted in 1895, it was made popular by his wife Lizzie Cox, who used the stage name Bonnie Thornton. The oldest known recording of the song is from 1895, performed by Dan Quinn (Berliner Discs 171-Z).

The song was also recorded as &quot;They Don&#x27;t Wear Pants in the Southern Part of France&quot; by John Bartles, the version sometimes played by radio host Dr. Demento.

==Travadja La Moukère==
In France, there is a song which pieds-noirs from Algeria brought back in the 1960s called &quot;Travadja La Moukère&quot; (from &quot;trabaja la mujer&quot;, which means &quot;the woman works&quot; in Spanish), which uses the same riff.

==Children&#x27;s culture and parodies==
The tune is used for a 20th-century American children&#x27;s song with – like many unpublished songs of child folk culture – countless variations as the song is passed from child to child over considerable lengths of time and geography, the one constant being that the versions are almost always obscene. One variation, for example, is:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;There&#x27;s a place in France
Where the ladies wear no pants
But the men don&#x27;t care
&#x27;cause they don&#x27;t wear underwear.&lt;/poem&gt;
or a similar version:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;There&#x27;s a place in France
Where the naked ladies dance
There&#x27;s a hole in the wall
Where the men can see it all.&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="1014766" wikidata="Q1253024" url="?curid=1014766" title="Local Media Group">
<text>Local Media Group, Inc., formerly Dow Jones Local Media Group and Ottaway Newspapers Inc., owned newspapers, websites and niche publications in California, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon and Pennsylvania. It was headquartered in Campbell Hall, New York, and its flagship was the &quot;Times Herald-Record&quot;, serving Middletown and other suburbs of New York City. 

The Ottaway organization was founded in by James H. Ottaway Sr., owner of the &quot;Endicott Daily Bulletin&quot; of Endicott, NY, in 1936. It had grown to nine newspapers in the northeastern United States by 1970, when it was acquired by Dow Jones &amp; Company, publisher of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and later a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation. Following the 2013 split of News Corporation into 21st Century Fox and News Corp, News Corp sold the Dow Jones Local Media Group to Newcastle Investment Corp., an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group, which placed the holdings in the GateHouse Media portfolio of its New Media Investment Group, renamed Gannett following that company&#x27;s 2019 acquisition by New Media Investment Group.

==History==

===Ottaway newspapers===
James H. Ottaway Sr. founded the company in November 1936, when he purchased the &quot;Bulletin&quot;, a semi-weekly paper in Endicott, New York, that he converted to a daily within a year. Ottaway added the &quot;Oneonta Star&quot; in 1944, followed two years later by the &quot;Pocono Record&quot;.

The company was a seller more often than a buyer in the 2000s (decade), however, and several observers—including the &quot;New York Post&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; and Ottaway&#x27;s own &quot;Cape Cod Times&quot;—speculated that News Corporation intended to sell all or part of the company in the near future.

===Dow Jones Local Media Group===
Under Dow Jones&#x27; ownership, Ottaway sold several newspapers in recent years, however, most recently in December 2006, when the company dealt nearly half its daily newspapers to Community Newspaper Holdings Inc. (CNHI) for $287.9 million (including real estate).

Until December 2006, the following dailies and weeklies were also part of the Ottaway chain. Other than the California and Connecticut newspapers, they are all now part of CNHI.
* &quot;Santa Cruz Sentinel&quot; daily of Santa Cruz, California
* &quot;The News-Times&quot; daily of Danbury, Connecticut
* &quot;The Spectrum&quot; weekly of Milford, Connecticut
* &quot;Traverse City Record-Eagle&quot; daily of Traverse City, Michigan
* &quot;The Grand Traverse Herald&quot; weekly of Traverse City, Michigan
* &quot;Cooperstown Crier&quot; weekly of Cooperstown, New York
* &quot;Daily Star&quot; of Oneonta, New York
* &quot;Press-Republican&quot; of Plattsburgh, New York
* &quot;Daily Item&quot; of Sunbury, Pennsylvania
* &quot;The Danville News&quot; weekdays only, of Danville, Pennsylvania

These four daily newspapers were sold by Ottaway to CNHI for $182 million in 2002:
* &quot;The Herald&quot; of Sharon, Pennsylvania
* &quot;The Independent&quot; of Ashland, Kentucky
* &quot;The Free Press&quot; of Mankato, Minnesota
* &quot;The Joplin Globe&quot; of Joplin, Missouri

Also, Ottaway sold the three daily newspapers of Essex County Newspapers Inc. to &quot;The Eagle-Tribune&quot; of North Andover, Massachusetts, in 2002, for $70 million. &quot;The Eagle-Tribune&quot;, along with the Essex papers listed below, was later purchased by CNHI.
* &quot;Daily News of Newburyport&quot; of Newburyport, Massachusetts
* &quot;Gloucester Daily Times&quot; of Gloucester, Massachusetts
* &quot;Salem Evening News&quot; of Salem, Massachusetts

===Sale to Newcastle===
On September 4, 2013, News Corp announced that it would sell the Dow Jones Local Media Group to Newcastle Investment Corp.—an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group, for $87 million. The newspapers will be operated by GateHouse Media, a newspaper group owned by Fortress. News Corp. CEO and former &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; editor Robert James Thomson indicated that the newspapers were &quot;not strategically consistent with the emerging portfolio&quot; of the company. GateHouse in turn filed prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 27, 2013, to restructure its debt obligations in order to accommodate the acquisition. Newcastle combined Local Media Group with the post-bankruptcy GateHouse Media later in 2013 to form New Media Investment Group. 

==Holdings==

===Holdings by frequency of publication===
Dow Jones Local Media Group published eight daily and 15 weekly newspapers in seven U.S. states. Its circulation was given in 2005 as 282,000 daily, 316,000 Sunday and 119,000 daily unique visitors on newspaper Internet sites.

<doc id="1014770" wikidata="Q1294703" url="?curid=1014770" title="Shanty town">
<text>A shanty town, squatter area, squatter settlement, or squatter camp is a settlement of improvised buildings known as shanties or shacks, typically made of materials such as mud and wood, or from cheap building materials such as corrugated iron sheets. A typical shanty town is squatted and, at least initially, lacks adequate infrastructure, including proper sanitation, safe water supply, electricity and street drainage. Over time, shanty towns may develop their infrastructure and even change into middle class neighbourhoods. They can be small informal settlements or they can house millions of people.

First used in North America to designate a shack, the term &quot;shanty&quot; is likely derived from French &quot;chantier&quot; (construction site and associated low-level workers&#x27; quarters), or alternatively from Scottish Gaelic &quot;sean&quot; () meaning &#x27;old&#x27; and &quot;taigh&quot; () meaning &#x27;house[hold]&#x27;.

Globally, some of the largest shanty towns are Ciudad Neza in Mexico, Orangi in Pakistan and Dharavi in India. They are known by various names in different places, such as favela in Brazil, villa miseria in Argentina and gecekondu in Turkey. Shanty towns are mostly found in developing nations, but also in the cities of developed nations, such as Athens, Los Angeles and Madrid. Cañada Real is considered the largest informal settlement in Europe, and Skid Row is an infamous shanty town in Los Angeles. Shanty towns are sometimes found on places such as railway sidings, swampland or disputed building projects. In South Africa, squatter camps, often referred to as &quot;plakkerskampe&quot;, directly translated from the Afrikaans word for squatter camps, often starts and grows rapidly on vacant land or public spaces within or close to cities and towns, where there may be nearby work opportunities, without the cost of transport. 

==Construction==

Shanty towns tend to begin as improvised shelters on squatted land. People build shacks from whatever materials are easy to acquire, for example wood or mud. There are no facilities such as electricity, gas, sewage or running water. The squatters choose areas such as railway sidings, preservation areas or disputed building projects. Swiss journalist Georg Gerster noted, with specific reference to the &quot;invasões&quot; of Brasília, that &quot;squatter settlements [as opposed to slums], despite their unattractive building materials, may also be places of hope, scenes of a counter-culture, with an encouraging potential for change and a strong upward impetus&quot;. Stewart Brand observed that shanty towns are environmentally friendly, with people recycling as much as possible and tending to travel by foot, bicycle, rickshaw or shared taxi rather than car, due to poverty.
==Development and future prospects==
While most shanty towns begin as precarious establishments haphazardly thrown together without basic social and civil services, over time, some have undergone a certain amount of development. Often the residents themselves are responsible for the major improvements. Community organizations sometimes working alongside NGOs, private companies, and the government, set up connections to the municipal water supply, pave roads, and build local schools. Some of these shanties have become middle class suburbs. One such example is the Los Olivos neighbourhood of Lima, Peru, which now contains gated communities, casinos, and plastic surgery clinics.

Some Brazilian favelas have also seen improvements in the 21st century, and can even attract tourists. Development occurs over a long period of time, and newer towns—and many older ones—still lack basic services. Nevertheless, there has been a general trend whereby shanties undergo gradual improvements, rather than relocation to even more distant parts of a metropolis.

In Africa, many shanty towns are starting to implement the use of composting toilets and solar panels. In India, people living in slums have access to cell phones and the internet.

Other African shanty towns have even become popular tourist attractions. Soweto (SOuthWEst TOwnship), an old squatter camp from apartheid-era South Africa is now classified as a city within a city, with a population of almost 2 million. The &quot;Soweto Towers&quot; vertical adventure centre is in Soweto, and there are guided excursions, often including a Shisa-nyama.

Pope Francis argued in his 2015 encyclical letter Laudato si&#x27; that shanty town settlements should be developed, if possible, rather than people being moved on and their settlements destroyed. He and the Catholic Church&#x27;s Council for Justice and Peace have emphasised the need for information, involvement and choice being offered to people being moved on.

==Instances==
Shanty towns are present in a number of developing countries. In Francophone countries, shanty towns are referred to as (French for &quot;can town&quot;); such countries include Haiti, where Cité Soleil houses between 200,000 and 300,000 people on the edge of Port-au-Prince.

===Africa===
In 2016, 62% of Africa&#x27;s population was living in shanty towns. 

Squatter camps in South Africa typically use cheap, and easily acquired building materials such as corrugated tin sheets to build shacks. Offering very little protection against extreme weather conditions, these squatter camps, often built near streams or rivers due to the steady water supply, are often subjected to flash floods. They are also prone to runaway fires due to the close proximity they are built in. They often cause a great deal of damage to naturally occurring ecosystems, both directly, and indirectly. An example of severe indirect damage is the use of washing detergents, and refuse disposal in the nearby water source, which can often be seen for hundreds of kilometers down stream.

Due to the lack of infrastructure, and the cost of basic services, such as water and electricity, the overall squatted area is often barren, with the ground sweeped and stamped to minimise dust, and where gardening is simply impossible and unaffordable. Illegal and dangerous electricity connections are abundant, another danger for fires, and electrical accidents,

The Joe Slovo squatter camp, in Cape Town, houses an estimated 20,000 people. Shack dwellers in South Africa organise themselves in groups such as Abahlali baseMjondolo and Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign.

In Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, Kibera has between 200,000 and 1 million residents. There is no running water and inhabitants use a flying toilet in which faeces are collected in a plastic bag then thrown away. Mathare is a collection of slums which contain around 500,000 people. In Zambia, the informal housing areas are known as kombonis and approximately 80% of the people in the capital Lusaka are living in them.

===Asia===

The largest shanty town in Asia is Orangi in Karachi, Pakistan, which had an estimated 1.5 million inhabitants in 2011. The Orangi Pilot Project aims to lift local people out of poverty. It was begun by Akhtar Hameed Khan and run by Parveen Rehman until her murder in 2013. Residents laid sewage pipes themselves and almost all of Orangi&#x27;s 8,000 streets are now connected. In India, an estimated one million people live in Dharavi, a shanty town built on a former mangrove swamp in Mumbai. It is one of the most densely populated places on the globe. In 2011, there were at least four improvised settlements in Mumbai containing even more people. There are in total 3.4 million people living in the 5,000 informal settlements of Bangladesh&#x27;s capital city Dhaka.

Thailand has 5,500 informal settlements, one of the largest being a shanty town in the Khlong Toei District of Bangkok. In China, 171 urban villages were demolished before the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. As of 2005, there were 346 shanty towns in Beijing, housing 1.5 million people. Author Robert Neuwirth wrote that around six million people, half the population of Istanbul lived in gecekondu areas.

In Hong Kong, the Kowloon Walled City housed up to 50,000 people, with rooftop slums currently providing some additional housing. 

===Latin America===
The world&#x27;s largest shanty town is Ciudad Neza or Neza-Chalco-Itza, which is part of the city of Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl, next to Mexico City. Estimates of its population range from 1.2 million to 4 million.

Brazil has many favelas. In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, it was calculated in 2000 that over 20% of its 6.5 million inhabitants were living in more than 600 favelas. For example, Rocinha is home to an estimated 80,000 inhabitants. It has developed into a densely populated neighbourhood with some buildings reaching six storeys high. There are theatres, schools, nurseries and local newspapers.

In Argentina, shanty towns are known as villas miseria. As of 2011, there were 500,000 people living in 864 informal settlements in the metropolitan Buenos Aires area. In Peru, they are known as pueblos jóvenes (&quot;young towns&quot;), as campamentos in Chile, and as asentamientos in Guatemala.

===Developed countries===
During the 1930s Great Depression, shanty towns nicknamed Hoovervilles sprang up across the United States. Following the Great Depression, squatters lived in shacks on landfill sites beside the Martin Pena canal in Puerto Rico and were still there in 2010. More recently, cities such as Newark and Oakland have witnessed the creation of tent cities. The Umoja Village shanty town was squatted in 2006 in Miami, Florida. There are also colonias near the border with Mexico.

Although shanty towns are now generally less common in developed countries in Europe, they still exist. The growing influx of migrants has fuelled shantytowns in cities commonly used as a point of entry into the European Union, including Athens and Patras in Greece. The Calais Jungle in France had grown to over 8,000 people by the time of its clearance in October 2016. Bidonvilles exist in the peripheries of some French cities. The state authorities recorded 16,399 people living in 391 slums across the country in 2012. Of these, 41% lived on the outskirts of Paris.

In Madrid, Spain, a shanty town named Cañada Real is considered the largest informal settlement in Europe. It has an estimated 8,628 inhabitants, who are mainly Spanish, Romani and north African, but only one mobile health unit. After 40 years, property developers began to take an interest in the site in 2012.

There have been cardboard cities in London and Belgrade. In some cases, shanty towns can persist in gentrified areas that local governments have yet to redevelop, or in regions of political dispute. A major historical example was the Kowloon Walled City in Hong Kong.

In Australia and New Zealand, there were many shanty towns before World War II, some of which still exist (for example Wyee, a suburb of the Central Coast).

==In popular culture==
Many films have been shot in shanty towns. &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; centres on characters who spend most of their lives in Indian shanty towns. The Brazilian film &quot;City of God&quot; was set in Cidade de Deus and filmed in another favela, called Cidade Alta. &quot;White Elephant&quot;, a 2012 Argentinian movie, is set in a villa miseria in Buenos Aires. The South African film &quot;District 9&quot; is largely set in a township called Chiawelo, from which people had been forcibly resettled.

The 2016 Chinese TV series &quot;Housing&quot; tells the story of shantytown clearance in Beiliang, Baotou, Inner Mongolia.

A 2023 Nigerian crime thriller titled &quot;Shanty Town&quot; was released on Netflix on January 20, 2023. It is a six-part series that tells the story of a ruthless leader named Scar (Chidi Mokeme) who handles a lot of dirty business and is popularly regarded as the King of Shanty Town.

Video games such as &quot;Max Payne 3&quot; have levels located in fictional shanty towns.

Reggae singer Desmond Dekker sang a song called &quot;007 (Shanty Town)&quot;.

<text>The Young Lords was a Chicago-based street gang that became a civil rights and human rights organization. The group, most active in the late 1960s and 1970s, aimed to fight for neighborhood empowerment and self-determination for Puerto Rico, Latino, and colonized (&quot;Third World&quot;) people. Tactics used by the Young Lords include mass education, canvassing, community programs, occupations, and direct confrontation. The Young Lords became targets of the United States FBI&#x27;s COINTELPRO program.

In party platform points, the Young Lords may spell &quot;American&quot; as &quot;amerikkkan&quot; or &quot;Amerikkkan&quot;—expressing, among other things, opposition to U.S. military presence in Puerto Rico. The platform follows the mission clearly, stating: &quot;We demand immediate withdrawal of U.S. military forces and bases from Puerto Rico, Vietnam, and all oppressed communities inside and outside the U.S. No Puerto Rican should serve in the U.S. Army against his brothers and sisters, for the only true army of oppressed people is the people&#x27;s army to fight all rulers.&quot;

==History==
===Origins===
The Young Lords started in 1960 in Chicago&#x27;s Lincoln Park neighborhood as a Puerto Rican turf gang. On Grito de Lares, September 23, 1968, Jose Cha Cha Jimenez reorganized them and formed the Young Lords as a national political and civil rights movement. The new community-wide movement then spread to nearly 30 cities, including three branches in New York, which at the time served as the entry point for 90% of Puerto Ricans. In addition, the Young Lords began operating free programs for the community. In addition to their support for Puerto Ricos&#x27; independence, all Latino nations, and oppressed nations of the world, the Young Lords also supported neighborhood empowerment. The radical movement of the Young Lords modeled themselves after the Black Panther Party, calling for a vanguard of revolutionary minority parties coming together that felt oppressed by a system that wasn’t designed to be of assistance to minorities.

The Young Lords&#x27; focus remains self-determination for Puerto Rico, other Latino and Third World countries, and for neighborhood-controlled development. The movement expanded from Chicago to include a broader audience and chapters in 30 cities, including three branches in New York City, the port of entry for the majority of Puerto Rican migrants.

During Mayor Daley&#x27;s tenure in Chicago, a program of urban renewal resulted in Puerto Ricans in Lincoln Park and several Mexican communities being evicted from what became prime real estate areas near the Loop, Lakefront, Old Town, and Lakeview neighborhoods. The rationale was to increase property tax revenues by luring White, middle-class suburbanites and creating a suburb within the city. Some Young Lords were involved in the Puerto Rican June 1966 Division Street Riots in Wicker Park and Humboldt Park.

The 1968 Democratic Convention protests in Grant Park and the adjacent Lincoln Park Neighborhood, resulted in the Young Lords, under the leadership of founder José Cha Cha Jiménez, to join with others to form a broader civil and human rights movement. Puerto Rican self-determination and the displacement of Puerto Ricans and poor residents became the primary issues of organizing. The Young Lords organization also began to train students and youth to take on the leadership to organize the Latino community on a national level.

Multiple chapters formed nationwide based on the original Chicago chapter, including several branches in New York City and along the East Coast. The National Headquarters in Chicago asked the loose coalition of chapters in New York to unite as a single regional branch. All chapters considered neighborhood empowerment and Puerto Rican self-determination as unifying missions.

The Great Migrations of the late 1940s resulted in many Puerto Ricans coming to the mainland for opportunity and settling in the Midwest, Florida, and on the East Coast of the United States. Chicago, one of the most populated centers of the Puerto Rican diaspora, took on a significant role as a regional headquarters of the movement.

The office in Chicago attempted to construct a nationwide grassroots movement within the U.S. barrios to unite Puerto Ricans with other Latinos and carry out its mission for Puerto Rican independence. The New York City regional chapter formed July 26, 1969, ten months after the Young Lords Movement began in Chicago. The National Headquarters in Chicago had gained national prominence by leading protests against conditions faced by Puerto Ricans in the U.S. Because most members in New York were students with a middle-class income, who were media-savvy, the New York chapter flourished. It provided needed support for the National Headquarters then under surveillance by the F.B.I. and the Chicago city government.

The National Headquarters&#x27; first action was to ransack and close the Department of Urban Renewal office in Chicago. The Young Lords attended an Urban Renewal meeting and told the panel of the local neighborhood association that no more meetings would be permitted in Lincoln Park until people of color were included on the Urban Renewal Board.

On July 27, 1969, the chapter office in New York City mounted a &quot;Garbage Offensive&quot; to commemorate the 1968 Sanitation Strike and to protest the substandard garbage collection service in East Harlem. The event also promoted the opening of the Young Lords&#x27; New York City office. The offensives targeted local city services and were aligned with the National Headquarters mission to develop neighborhood empowerment. In Chicago, the Young Lords occupied local institutions in the Lincoln Park neighborhood to support low-income housing for working families.

The New York members had first read about the Chicago Young Lords in an issue of the Black Panther newspaper. It reported actions for Puerto Rican and Latino self-determination and publicized the increasing repression of Jose &quot;Cha Cha&quot; Jimenez and the Chicago National Headquarters. The New York office followed the actions of the People&#x27;s Church in Chicago and took over the First Spanish United Methodist Church in East Harlem. Over 100 members were arrested in the two-week takeover. National Headquarters members encouraged the New York members not to resist arrests, in order to avoid bloodshed.

The New York occupation of First Spanish United Methodist Church in East Harlem took place on December 28, 1969, after several similar actions in Chicago: the sit-in at Grant Hospital, the take-over of People&#x27;s Park, the occupation of McCormick Seminary, and the occupation of Chicago&#x27;s People&#x27;s Church (Armitage Avenue United Methodist Church). In several cities, the Young Lords set up free community programs, such as breakfast and classes. United Methodist Pastor Rev. Bruce Johnson, of the North Side Cooperative Ministry, worked to obtain funds to support the Young Lords programs. Rev. Sergio Herrera, a Cuban assistant pastor of the Young Lords People&#x27;s Church in Chicago, did not initially agree with their occupation of the church, nor of their murals of Che Guevara and Pedro Albizu Campos. Later he participated in all the neighborhood events.

Occupying the Armitage Avenue United Methodist Church in May 1969, the Young Lords set up programs inside what they called the People&#x27;s Church. The building remained a church but also served as the Young Lords National Headquarters for nearly two years. UMC Bishop Pryor was pressured to oust the two UMC ministers and the Young Lords from the People&#x27;s Church by Alderman George Barr McCutcheon and members of the Lincoln Park Conservation Association. The Court fined the People&#x27;s Church $200 each day the free daycare center remained open.

On September 29, 1969, the church&#x27;s pastor and his wife, Reverend Bruce and Eugenia Ransier Johnson, were stabbed to death, killed in their home. The case remains open and has yet to be solved. The assistant Pastor, Rev. Sergio Herrera, was transferred soon afterward to Los Angeles, where he was also murdered. The murders occurred while the two ministers were working with the Young Lords in those cities. That is also a cold case.

Hampton had created an alliance with the Young Lords via the Rainbow Coalition. Two months later, Chicago police killed Black Panthers Fred Hampton and Mark Clark in a raid on Hampton&#x27;s apartment, on December 4, 1969.

===Expansion===
The Puerto Rican nation&#x27;s diaspora has been divided and has created multiple neighborhoods or barrios in Florida, along the East Coast of the United States, New York City and Chicago. These Puerto Rican mainland communities developed across the U.S. during Operation Bootstrap which gave way to the Great Puerto Rican Migration of the late 1940s and early 1950s. In 1968, branches of the Young Lords sprouted up in Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Connecticut, New Jersey, Boston, Milwaukee, Hayward (California), San Diego, Los Angeles, and Puerto Rico.

The organizations&#x27; newspapers, &quot;The Young Lord&quot;, &quot;Pitirre&quot;, and &quot;Pa&#x27;lante&quot;, reported the increasingly militant activities of the Young Lords. Over 120 publicly accessible oral histories, &quot;Young Lords in Lincoln Park&quot; are curated at Grand Valley State University in Michigan.

Besides the coalition with the National Black Panther Party Office in Oakland and the Black Panthers in Chicago, integrated into by the Rainbow Coalition of Fred Hampton, the Young Lords also participated in coalitions with groups of the Puerto Rican Independence Movement, Northside Cooperative Ministry and the Lincoln Park Poor People&#x27;s Coalition.

The Young Lords grew into a national movement under the leadership of Jose Cha Cha Jimenez which also included Angela Lind Adorno, Alberto Chavarria, Marta Chavarria, Andres Nunez, Edwin Diaz, Jose (Cosmoe) Torres, Eddie Ramirez, Raul Lugo, Juan Gonzalez, Felipe Luciano, Iris Morales, Judy Cordero, Denise Oliver, Pablo Yoruba Guzman, Hilda Ignatin, Maria Romero, Omar Lopez, David Rivera, Tony Baez, Richie Perez, and Juan Fi Ortiz.

By May 1970 due to infiltration by the local Red Squad, the Gang Intelligence Unit, Chicago Patronage Machine and COINTELPRO, the New York regional office broke away from the Young Lords National Headquarters and formed the short lived Young Lords Party. The separation also resulted from rapid development, growing pains, and a friendly competition between U.S. cities. The infiltration and divisions created conflict between the chapters and division of the Puerto Rican Independence Movement. Branches on the east coast were forced to remain affiliated with the New York regional office. Most other chapters remained loyal to the Chicago National Headquarters. The separation was a major blow to the liberation movement in the U.S. The separation occurred in other movements such as the Black Panthers, Students for a Democratic Society, The Young Patriots and the American Indian Movement, as revealed in COINTELPRO documents.

Women in the Young Lords participated in community organizing and wrote newspaper articles against sexism and patriarchy including the &quot;Young Lords Party Position Paper on Women&quot;, published in 1970, and included in &quot;The Young Lords: A Reader&quot; (2010), edited by Darrel Enck-Wanzer.

The Young Lords in New York and Chicago continued to grow in numbers and influence from 1968 to 1983. Jose Cha Cha Jimenez introduced the newly elected African American mayor of Chicago, Harold Washington, to a June crowd of 100,000 Puerto Ricans that the Young Lords helped organize in Humboldt Park, Chicago.

===Repression===
The Young Lords were a target of the FBI&#x27;s COINTELPRO program that targeted Puerto Rican independence groups. The New York-Chicago schism mirrored the divisions within other New Left groups including the Black Panther Party, Students for a Democratic Society and Brown Berets, often as a result of COINTELPRO activities of police infiltration by informants and provocateurs. The Young Lords leaders were framed and discredited by both Mayor Richard J. Daley forces and the FBI. The entire Chicago leadership of the Young Lords was forced underground to reorganize and avoid complete destruction. COINTELPRO tactics used against the movements such as the Young Lords included rumor campaigns and pitting groups against each other to create factionalism, distrust, and personality conflicts. In Chicago, COINTELPRO created an anti-Rainbow Coalition component. The Red Squad also monitored the Young Lords National Headquarters 24 hours a day. Jose Cha Cha Jimenez became a main police target and was indicted 18 times in a six-week period on felony charges including assault and battery on police and creating a mob action. The intent of the police action was to cripple the organization. While the Young Lords advocated armed strategies similar to those advocated by the Black Panthers, the basis was as a right to self-defense. Such self defense was advocated after the shooting of Manuel Ramos, the suspected police involvement in the death of José (Pancho) Lind, the alleged suicide of Julio Roldan while in the custody of the New York Police Department, the fatal stabbings in Chicago of the United Methodist Church Rev. Bruce Johnson and his wife Eugenia, and the murder of Assistant Pastor Sergio Herrera shortly after his transfer to Los Angeles. The Young Lords accused the FBI CointelPro of a conspiracy to murder Young Lords and Black Panthers.

The Young Lords worked in their communities to provide resources, similar to actions of the Brown Berets and the Black Panther Party. A goal was to raise awareness of the oppression and educate on the history and struggle of the Puerto Ricans. &quot;The Young Lords: A Reader&quot; (2010), edited by Darrel Enck-Wanzer details the purpose, goals, and tactics of the Young Lords New York chapter. He wrote, &quot;Puerto Ricans have suffered as a group, racially and culturally, not as individuals. Therefore the fight against amerikkkanism must be a group struggle.&quot; Enck-Wanzer&#x27;s book details that every Puerto Rican has suffered and felt the pain of their fellow Puerto Rican brothers, sisters, friends, and relatives. His book argues that Puerto Ricans must fight for their nation against American colonialism by organizing and educating in the barrios and raise awareness of the repression since the creation of the Young Lords as a movement in the Lincoln Park neighborhood.

===Decline===
By 1973, the Young Lords and its leadership were in disarray. Jose Cha Cha Jimenez along with many central committee members set up an underground training school at a farm near Tomah, Wisconsin. Some members continued independent efforts around self-determination for Puerto Rico and neighborhood empowerment. In Chicago, the Young Lords resurfaced after two and a half years. The New York Young Lords and other chapters also continued to function.

After Jimenez served a year in prison, in 1975 he ran for alderman of the 46th Ward against Mayor Daley&#x27;s machine candidate. He garnered 39% of the vote against the Democratic candidate, Chris Cohen. The election re-energized the symbolic Rainbow Coalition formed by Black Panthers, Young Patriots, Young Lords and other groups and communities.

In 1983, the Young Lords organized the first major Latino event for the successful campaign of Chicago&#x27;s first African-American mayor, Harold Washington. After Washington&#x27;s victory, Jiménez introduced the mayor to a crowd of 100,000 Puerto Ricans in Humboldt Park in June 1983 where the Young Lords distributed 30,000 buttons inscribed with &quot;Tengo Puerto Rico En Mi Corazon.&quot; In the fall of 1995, Jose Cha Cha Jimenez brought together Chicago Young Lords&#x27; Tony Baez, Carlos Flores, Angel Del Rivero, Omar López and Angie Lind Adorno to form the Lincoln Park Project to collect the history of the Young Lords movement. They curated the history and documented the displaced Latinos of the Lincoln Park Neighborhood. In support of the Puerto Rican Vieques campers, the struggle for Puerto Rican independence, and against the displacement of Puerto Ricans in the Diaspora, the Young Lords organized the Lincoln Park Camp near Grand Rapids, Michigan, on September 23, 2002.

The Young Lords supported freed Puerto Rican nationalist leaders and urban guerrilla groups such as the Macheteros. Other Young Lords members joined Maoist formations such as the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Workers Party or provided the leadership of the National Congress for Puerto Rican Rights (NCPRR). Some Young Lords worked in the media, such as Juan González of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; and &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;, Pablo &quot;Yoruba&quot; Guzmán at WCBS-TV New York, Felipe Luciano and Miguel &quot;Mickey&quot; Meléndez of WBAI-FM New York.

==Organization==
===13 Point Program of the Young Lords===
The National Headquarters Young Lords&#x27; mission called for self determination for Puerto Rico, all Latino nations, all oppressed nations of the world, and for barrio empowerment. The Young Lords also created a 10-point program modeled after the Black Panthers 10 point program. The New York office created a 13-point program after they split from Chicago National Headquarters as follows:

# We want self-determination for Puerto Ricans—Liberation on the island and inside the United States.
# We want self-determination for all Latinos.
# We want liberation for all third world people.
# We are revolutionary nationalists and oppose racism.
# We want community control of our institutions and land.
# We want true education of our creole culture.
# We oppose capitalists and alliances with traitors.
# We oppose the amerikkkan military.
# We want freedom for all political prisoners.
# We want equality for women. Machismo must be revolutionary ... not oppressive.
# We fight anti-Communism with international unity.
# We believe armed self-defense and armed struggle are the only means to liberation.
# We want a socialist society.

In November 1970, that platform was revised. The revised 5th point called for women&#x27;s equality and opposed male chauvinism. The revised 6th point focused on community control of institutions and land. The revised 7th point demanded education of the Afro-Indio culture and the Spanish language. The revised 10th point called for freedom for political prisoners. The revised 11th point focused on the group&#x27;s internationalist perspective.

===Social action===
The Young Lords&#x27; mission supported self determination for Puerto Rico, Latino nations, all oppressed nations, and also supported neighborhood empowerment. The mission is reflected in the Young Lords logo of a map of Puerto Rico, a brown fist holding a rifle, and the words &quot;Tengo Puerto Rico en mi Corazon&quot; (&quot;I have Puerto Rico in my heart&quot;). The Young Lords envisioned themselves as the vanguard of a people&#x27;s struggle as they initially fought against the displacement of Puerto Ricans from Lincoln Park.

In New York, the Young Lords followed the lead of Chicago related to city services with the &quot;Garbage Offensive&quot; as a preliminary action. Organizers spent weeks cleaning up garbage in Puerto Rican communities. In need of additional cleaning supplies, they asked the New York City Department of Sanitation for assistance and were refused. Disgruntled, the Young Lords blocked 3rd Avenue traffic at 110th, 111th, and 112th Street.

The original urban renewal campaign was framed by the Chicago office as the modern day land question inspired by Emiliano Zapata who said, &quot;all revolutions are based on land.&quot;

The Young Lords created community projects similar to those of the Black Panthers, yet centralized around Latinos. The programs included free breakfast for children, the Emeterio Betances free health clinic, community testing for tuberculosis and lead-poisoning, free clothing drives, cultural events, and Puerto Rican history classes. In Chicago, the Young Lords set up a free dental clinic and community day care center and worked on solidarity for incarcerated Puerto Ricans and the rights of Vietnam War veterans. The New York female leadership advocated for women&#x27;s rights. In Chicago, women advocacy was led by Hilda Ignatin, Judy Cordero and Angela Adorno, in a subgroup known as Mothers And Others, that also helped to educate the male members and the community at large.

The Young Lords carried out many direct-action occupations of vacant land, hospitals, churches and other institutions to demand programs for the poor. The direct actions included a campaign to force New York City to increase garbage pick-up in Spanish Harlem, and in Chicago the seven-day McCormick Theological Seminary take-over that won Lincoln Park residents $650,000 for low-income housing, and the four-month People&#x27;s Park camp-out/take-over at Halsted and Armitage Avenue by 350 community residents that prevented the construction of a for-profit tennis court on land used for low incoming housing. In New York, the local health-care activism was carried out with the Health Revolutionary Unity Movement. In Chicago, the Young Lords&#x27; health program was coordinated by Jack Johns, Quentin Young, Ana Lucas, and Alberto and Marta Chavarria who also worked with a Black Panther-led coalition to recruit medical-student organizations like the Medical Committee for Human Rights (MCHR) to advocate for health care for the poor.

=== Women ===

In their position paper, the Young Lords asserted that colonized women (Puerto Ricans, blacks, &quot;Third World&quot;) were oppressed within society and their homes due to their sex, race/ethnicity, nationality and class. Thus, activism among these women was understood as &quot;the revolution within the revolution.&quot; The Young Lords recognized that &quot;Third World women have an integral role to play in the liberation of all oppressed people.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Cultural influence===

The Young Lords inspired young community leaders, professionals, and artists, forming part of a Puerto Rican cultural renaissance in the 1970s. In New York City, the renaissance was called the Nuyorican Movement and became a nationwide development including poetry and music. Felipe Luciano, a poet in Harlem&#x27;s black nationalist circles, became the Deputy Chairman of the New York regional chapter. He was expelled for male chauvinism and opportunism by the Young Lords Party, though the Young Lords National Headquarters never recognized the expulsion. His poems written while a member of The Last Poets, including &quot;Jíbaro&quot;, &quot;Un Rifle Oración&quot; and &quot;Hey Now&quot;. The poet Pedro Pietri wrote and recited his poems &quot;Puerto Rican Obituary&quot; and &quot;Suicide Note of a Cockroach in a Low Income Project&quot; at New York Young Lord events. Alfredo Matias wrote poems about Afro-Boricua pride and David Hernández recited &quot;La Armitage&quot; about the Chicago street that became the downtown for Puerto Ricans and the Young Lords. The song &quot;Qué Bonita Bandera&quot; (&quot;What a Beautiful Flag&quot;) was written by Pepe y Flora in Puerto Rico and adopted by the Young Lords as their anthem.

===Remembrance===
The documentary &quot;Palante, Siempre Palante! The Young Lords&quot;, produced by Iris Morales, aired on PBS in 1996. In 2015, a retrospective &quot;¡Presente! The Young Lords in New York,&quot; was held in New York City.

In 2001, Omar López, Minister of Information of the Young Lords was asked to donate by the Lincoln Park Project archival material that had been used in the Young Lords newspapers. The materials are now curated in DePaul University&#x27;s Special Collections and Archives Department and a portion digitized as part of DePaul&#x27;s Digital Collection. In 2012, 120 oral, audio, and visual histories were collected by Jimenez. They are currently online and are housed at Seidman College of Grand Valley State University.

Many books have been published by the Young Lords including in 2010 New York University Press &quot;The Young Lords: A Reader,&quot; edited by Darrel Enck-Wanzer with a foreword by former Young Lords Iris Morales and Denise Oliver-Vélez. The book primarily covers the Young Lords New York chapter through documents such as speeches and articles from &quot;Pa&#x27;lante&quot;, the Young Lords Newspaper, interviews, posters, and photographs.

Artist Sophia Dawson created &quot;Women of the Young Lords&quot;, included in the 2015 Bronx Museum exhibition, ¡Presente! The Young Lords in New York.

Darrel Wanzer-Serrano&#x27;s account of &quot;The New York Young Lords and the Struggle for Liberation&quot; authored in 2015 characterizes the roots of the local chapter.

The Puerto Rican activist group El Grito de Sunset Park, co-founded by Dennis Flores, had ties to and was influenced by the Young Lords.

Co-founder and one-time chair of the Young Lords organization, José &#x27;Cha Cha&#x27; Jiménez, died on January 10, 2025, at the age of 76.

<text>Matt Howarth is an American comic book writer/artist known for such series as &quot;Those Annoying Post Bros&quot;, &quot;Savage Henry&quot;, &quot;Star Crossed&quot;, and &quot;Bugtown&quot;.

== Biography ==
Howarth&#x27;s influences include writers Philip K. Dick and H. P. Lovecraft, comics artists Steve Ditko, Bernie Wrightson, Moebius, and Philippe Druillet, and progressive music. He was active in the field of fanzines from 1969, when he also co-founded Howski Studios.

==Career==
Howarth, via Howski Studios, published a number of graphic novels and comics in the years 1976–1985.

Howarth&#x27;s first ongoing series was &quot;Those Annoying Post Bros.&quot;, about two fun-loving bad boys from the fictional Bugtown. In the early 1980s &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; introduced &quot;Post Bros&quot; as a continuing story, but they did not have their own comic book until Vortex Comics began publishing &quot;Those Annoying Post Bros.&quot; in 1985. It ran for 18 issues until 1990. In 1991, the title was taken over by Rip Off Press, which published an additional 20 issues until 1994. MU Press picked up the title from 1994–1998, publishing 25 more issues, for a total of 63 issues.

While continuing to produce &quot;Those Annoying Post Bros.&quot; Howarth wrote and drew the six-issue limited series &quot;Particle Dreams&quot; for Fantagraphics in 1986–1987. In 1988, Fantagraphics also published Howarth&#x27;s six-issue series &quot;Keif Llama: Xeno-Tech&quot;.

From 1987 to 1994, Howarth did the comic book series &quot;Savage Henry&quot; for Rip Off Press, about the adventures of a guitarist from an alternate reality. He is the lead guitarist for a fictional insect band called The Bulldaggers. Most issues of this series featured authorized guest appearances by real musicians, including The Residents, Hawkwind, Moby, Ash Ra Tempel, Klaus Schulze, Nash the Slash, Foetus, Yello, Wire, Steve Roach, Richard Pinhas, Ron Geesin, and David Borden. Conrad Schnitzler (an original member of Tangerine Dream and Kluster) was a regular guest in this series and several graphic novels. Howarth created album cover artwork for several releases on the Birdo&#x27;Pray record label. He also provided the illustrations for &quot;Dr. Adder&quot; by K. W. Jeter.

James Wallis of Hogshead Publishing designed a roleplaying game based on Howarth&#x27;s &quot;Bugtown&quot; comics. Wallis brought his &quot;Bugtown&quot; game to Phage Press in 1992 to be produced, but Erick Wujcik had creative differences with Wallis so he pulled the deal from Phage in 1994. Wallis brought his &quot;Bugtown&quot; game to Wizards of the Coast, but was not successful there either, as Howarth was unable to come to an agreement with Wizards on royalties. In 1996, Wujcik was able to talk Howarth into licensing the &quot;Bugtown&quot; rights to him again, although Wujcik never actually published a game based on the comic. Howarth did write and draw a crossover between &quot;Bugtown&quot; and Amber titled &quot;Amber Raves of Pain&quot; which was published in &quot;Amberzine&quot; from issue #6 (February 1994) through #9 (January 1997).

In 1994–1995, Antarctic Press published Howarth&#x27;s four-issue series &quot;Konny and Czu&quot;. The MU Press imprint Aeon Press published Howarth&#x27;s six-issue limited series &quot;Comix of Two Cities&quot; in 1996. The DC Comics imprint Helix released Howarth&#x27;s three-issue limited series &quot;Star Crossed&quot; in 1997.

In the 2000s, Howarth published the six-issue series &quot;Bugtown&quot; and the second-volume of &quot;Keif Llama: Xeno-Tech&quot; (also six issues), both with MU Press.

Since 2008 Howarth has published a number of prose novels and short story collections through a print on demand service.

In 2012, Sonoluxe Records released Howarth&#x27;s 110 page graphic novel &quot;The Last of the Neon Cynics&quot; as a PDF File on an Enhanced CD also featuring nine pieces composed by musician Bill Nelson as a soundtrack. Set in the 23rd century, the Science-Fiction Western features an intergalactic cowboy called Cassidy. The same year, Howarth contributed a comic to accompany Arthur Brown&#x27;s CD &quot;The Magic Hat&quot;.

<doc id="1014774" wikidata="Q6925237" url="?curid=1014774" title="Mountain States Legal Foundation">
<text>Mountain States Legal Foundation (MSLF) is an American 501(c)(3) nonprofit conservative free market public interest law firm based in Lakewood, Colorado. Its lawyers argue cases on property rights and federal land management in the American West, as well as gun rights and other constitutional law cases.

Past attorneys for MSLF include James G. Watt and Gale Norton, who became U.S. secretaries of the interior in the Reagan administration and George W. Bush administration, respectively; William Perry Pendley, acting director of the Bureau of Land Management in the first Trump administration; and John Kyl, former U.S. senator from Arizona.

==History and activities==
MSLF was incorporated in Denver, Colorado, in 1976 with funding from the National Legal Center for the Public Interest and Joseph Coors. MSLF&#x27;s first president was James G. Watt. MSLF filed &quot;amicus&quot; briefs opposing an affirmative action program at the University of Colorado Law School, opposing business inspections, and opposing Idaho&#x27;s ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.

MSLF is governed by a volunteer Board of Directors, which also approves all legal actions taken by MSLF, and assisted in the selection of its litigation by a volunteer Board of Litigation. MSLF employs a full-time staff, which includes attorneys who conduct all of the litigation in which MSLF engages. The organization reports its annual budget to be over $2 million.

MSLF&#x27;s office is in Lakewood, Colorado, near Denver. MSLF publishes a quarterly newsletter, &quot;The Litigator&quot;, which addresses topical legal issues.

Since its creation, MSLF has argued cases before the Supreme Court of the United States and numerous federal courts of appeals. In 1995, its president, William Perry Pendley, argued before the Supreme Court in &quot;Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña,&quot; the case in which the justices ruled that preferential treatment based on race is almost always unconstitutional. MSLF has continued its litigation regarding affirmative action, reverse discrimination, and racial quotas and preferences, and also has litigated regarding the Voting Rights Act.

In addition, MSLF has litigated regarding property rights. Its lawsuits have involved the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, (especially regarding wetlands), the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the National Forest Management Act, the Antiquities Act, the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, and the General Mining Act of 1872, and bars on and restrictions regarding the ability to develop natural resources such as energy and minerals and forest and agricultural products. In a case dismissed in 2002, MSLF sued George W. Bush for failing to overturn a designation of national monuments action by Bill Clinton.

MSLF&#x27;s sources of funding have included Texaco, U.S. Steel, Phillips Petroleum, and ExxonMobil corporations, and Castle Rock Foundation.

<doc id="1014785" wikidata="Q193386" url="?curid=1014785" title="Bolivia national football team">
<text>The Bolivia national football team (), nicknamed La Verde, has represented Bolivia in men&#x27;s international football since 1926. Organized by the Bolivian Football Federation (FBF), it is one of the ten members of FIFA&#x27;s South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL).

After playing in the 1930 and 1950 World Cups, they have qualified just once, in 1994, where they were eliminated in the group stage. Bolivia have never advanced past the first round of any World Cup, and have only scored one goal, in 1994. Despite their World Cup performances, Bolivia won the Copa América at home in 1963, and finished runners-up in 1997, which they also hosted. At the 2015 Copa América in Chile, they advanced to the quarter-finals for the first time since 1997, after defeating Ecuador 3–2. This also ended a winless streak in the Copa América, with their last win being on 28 June 1997, when they defeated Mexico 1–0 in the semi-finals.

==History==

Bolivia debuted in international football in 1926, one year after the Bolivian Football Federation was founded, and joined FIFA that same year. As participants at the 1926 South American Championship in Chile, Bolivia played their first match against the hosts on 12 October 1926, and even ended up scoring first against them, but wound up being defeated by the Chileans 7–1. Bolivia also lost their following three matches: 0–5 against Argentina, 1–6 against Paraguay and 0–6 against Uruguay.

In 1930, Bolivia was one of the teams invited to the inaugural edition of the World Cup, held in Uruguay. Drawn in Group 2 of the 1930 World Cup, Bolivia lost both its games 4–0, first to Yugoslavia at the Estadio Parque Central, and then to Brazil in the Estadio Centenario. The match versus the Yugoslavs would be the last match against non-South American opposition for Bolivia until 1972 – when they again met Yugoslavia. They returned for the 1950 World Cup, where Argentina&#x27;s withdrawal from the qualifiers gave Bolivia an automatic berth. With three teams declining to play in Brazil, Bolivia was put in a group of two along with Uruguay. The Bolivians&#x27; only game was an 8–0 defeat to Uruguay at the Estádio Independência in Belo Horizonte.
Bolivia&#x27;s greatest football achievement was the 1963 South American Championship title, which they hosted and won after placing first out of 7 countries, including being undefeated, with five wins and one draw. The only draw for Bolivia in the tournament was a 4–4 draw against Ecuador in the opening match. They also had the advantage of being better accustomed to higher altitudes. In the following edition, the 1967 South American Championship, held in Uruguay, Bolivia finished last out of six teams, with one draw and four losses, which was far below what the public expected, as Bolivia had been the defending champion.

Afterwards, the country only started to resurge at an international level with the creation of the in Santa Cruz de la Sierra in 1978, a football school that developed players such as Marco Etcheverry, Erwin Sánchez and Luis Cristaldo.

Under Spanish coach Xabier Azkargorta and featuring nine players from Tahuichi, Bolivia surprisingly became the first team to beat Brazil in the 1994 World Cup qualifiers while playing them in La Paz, with a 2–0 win, and qualified for the 1994 World Cup by finishing second in Group B behind the Brazilians themselves, which included record 7–0 and 7–1 wins over Venezuela during their qualification campaign.

Bolivia was drawn into the tournament&#x27;s Group C, and played defending champions Germany in the tournament&#x27;s opening match at Soldier Field. Bolivia outplayed Germany in the first half. In the second half, Lothar Matthäus took a 40-yard run and struck Marco &quot;El Diablo&quot; Etcheverry with a high elbow to his jaw. Etcheverry retaliated by fouling Matthäus and was sent off. Eventually, Bolivia lost on a controversial offside goal by Jürgen Klinsmann. Following a goalless draw with South Korea at Foxboro Stadium, where Bolivia was forced to play with ten men again after Cristaldo&#x27;s red card, Bolivia returned to Chicago and lost 3–1 to Spain, with Sánchez scoring the first ever Bolivian goal in a World Cup.

Following the World Cup, Bolivia participated in the 1995 Copa América held in Uruguay, with Antonio Lopez Habas as manager, where they made the quarter-finals for the first time since winning the competition in 1963, with one win, one draw, and one loss. In the quarter-finals, the nation lost to hosts Uruguay 2–1. Despite the decent performance the team displayed during the tournament, Lopez Habas left his post shortly before the 1997 Copa America, being replaced by Dušan Drašković. The 1997 edition was the second time Bolivia held the tournament. The team reached the final, as had happened last time Bolivia was the host, but this time they finished runner-up to reigning world champion Brazil after losing 3–1 in the final.

With their runner-up finish at the previous Copa America, Bolivia made their first and only FIFA Confederations Cup appearance in the 1999 edition, this time under new Argentine manager Héctor Veira. Bolivia was placed in group A along with hosts Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. Their campaign started with a 2–2 draw against Egypt. Their next match was a 0–0 draw against Saudi Arabia. For their last match in the group, they had to play hosts Mexico, in which Bolivia lost 0–1 with a goal from Francisco Palencia. Bolivia finished third in the group with two draws and a loss, being eliminated from the tournament in the first stage.

In the 2015 Copa América in Chile, under Bolivian manager Mauricio Soria, Bolivia were placed in Group A, with Chile, Mexico, and Ecuador. In their match against Mexico, Bolivia drew 0–0. However, against Ecuador, Bolivia won 3–2, with goals from Raldes, Smedberg-Dalence, and Moreno. From this victory against Ecuador, Bolivia made it to the next round, the quarter-finals, for the first time since the 1997 tournament, which they hosted. Bolivia were defeated by Peru 1–3 in the quarter-finals of the tournament, and Bolivia&#x27;s only goal of the game was a penalty in the last minutes of the match scored by Marcelo Moreno. In the next three Copa América editions, Bolivia performed poorly, losing all games in these tournaments.

In 2021, Bolivian Football Federation&#x27;s new President, Fernando Costa Sarmiento, lamented the deteriorating condition of football in Bolivia and vowed to rebuild the country&#x27;s football system. He accused the previous Presidents of mismanaging football as he aimed to reconstruct Bolivian football into a more professional manner.

On 28 March 2023, Bolivia registered its first-ever away win against a World Cup team in the 21st century, a 2–1 over Saudi Arabia in Jeddah in a friendly.

==Stadium==
Bolivia plays their home matches at Estadio Hernando Siles, which has an altitude of above sea level, making it one of the highest football stadiums in the world. Many visiting teams have protested that the altitude gives Bolivia an unfair advantage against opponents. On 27 May 2007, FIFA declared that no World Cup Qualifying matches could be played in stadiums above 8,200 feet (2,500 m) above sea level. However, FIFA raised the altitude limit to 3,000 meters a month later after negative feedback against the ban, and included a special exception for La Paz, thus allowing the stadium to continue holding World Cup qualifying matches. A year after the original ban, in May 2008, FIFA removed the altitude limit entirely.
In 2024 the Bolivian Football Federation decided that from then on the home games would be played in the Estadio Municipal de El Alto, that has an altitude of above sea level. The official reasoning by the coach is that it was freshly renovated and that they would play where they live.

===Kit history===
Bolivia&#x27;s first uniforms were all white. In the 1930 FIFA World Cup, before the match with Yugoslavia, Bolivia painted one of the letters in &quot;Viva Uruguay&quot; in each of the eleven starters&#x27; jerseys to please the local crowd. In the following game with Brazil, given the adversary also wore white, Bolivia instead borrowed Uruguay&#x27;s own blue uniform to play. Bolivia again painted a message to the hosts in the 1945 South American Championship, with the players&#x27; jerseys reading &quot;Viva Chile&quot;. In 1946, Bolivia changed their jersey colors to black and white stripes, like the colors of the Cochabamba region. FBF reverted to white the following year. In 1957, FBF decided to use one of the colors in the Flag of Bolivia. Given red and yellow were used by many of the other South Americans, green became the primary color, leading to the nickname &quot;La Verde&quot; (&quot;The Green&quot;).

<doc id="1014787" wikidata="Q492511" url="?curid=1014787" title="Yamaha Virago">
<text>The Yamaha Virago was Yamaha&#x27;s first V-twin cruiser motorcycle, and one of the earliest mass-produced motorcycles with a mono-shock rear suspension. Originally sold with a &#x27; engine in 1981, Yamaha soon added&#x27; and &quot;&quot; versions.

The bike was redesigned in 1984, switching from a rear mono-shock to a dual-shock design, and adding a tear-drop shaped gas tank. That year, Harley-Davidson, fearful of the inroads in the US market made by the Virago and other new Japanese cruiser-style motorcycles, pushed for a tariff on imported bikes over 700 cc. Yamaha replaced the 750 cc engine with a 699 cc version to avoid the tariff, while the 920 cc engine grew to 981 cc (XV1000), and later 1063 cc (XV1100).

In 1988 a 250 cc Virago was added. A short production (1997–2000) of 125 cc was also manufactured. Yamaha made an XV125, XV250, XV400, XV500, XV535, XV700, XV750, XV920R, XV1000/TR1, and an XV1100, with the XV400SCLX being the rarest. XV125, XV250, XV920R and XV1000/TR1 were chain driven, other models were equipped with shaft drive.

The larger-displacement Viragos were eventually phased out of production, replaced by the V-Star and Road Star series of motorbikes. The engines lived on, however. The facelifted version of the original XV750/1100 powerplant was used in the V-star 1100 models, the XV400/535 engine with slightly more bore and stroke was used in the V-star 650. The last motorcycle to bear the Virago name was the 2007 Virago 250. For 2008 it was renamed the V-Star 250.

According to &quot;Motorcyclist&quot; magazine, the early Virago has a design flaw in the starter system. Being fully mechanical, under less than ideal circumstances (e.g. weak battery) it promoted wear on the starter engagement/disengagement system. This magazine states that the starter&#x27;s defect exists in early Virago models made in year 1981, 1982 and 1983. XV700 models of the model years 1984 and 1985 also had the weaker, fully mechanical starter system. Improved electro-mechanical systems were applied as of 1986 on all 700, 750, 1000 and 1100 cc units.

<text>Key-based routing (KBR) is a lookup method used in conjunction with distributed hash tables (DHTs) and certain other overlay networks. While DHTs provide a method to find a host responsible for a certain piece of data, KBR provides a method to find the &quot;closest&quot; host for that data, according to some defined metric. This may not necessarily be defined as physical distance, but rather the number of network hops.

<text>Aleksandr Vasilyevich Medved (16 September 1937 – 2 September 2024) was a Ukrainian-born Soviet Belarusian freestyle wrestler of Russian ethnicity who competed for the Soviet Union and was named &quot;one of the greatest wrestlers in history&quot; by FILA, the sport&#x27;s governing body. Between 1962 and 1972 he won three Olympic gold medals, seven world and three European titles. He served as the Olympic flag bearer for the Soviet Union in 1972, for Belarus in 2004 and recited the Judge&#x27;s Oath at the Opening Ceremony of the 1980 Olympics.

==Biography==
According to Medved, his grandparents came from Russia; his grandmother was ca. 195 cm, and his grandfather was even taller. Medved was smaller, at 190 cm and 100+ kg, yet big enough to fit into his last name, which means &quot;bear&quot; in Russian (and with minor variations in Belarusian and Ukrainian languages).

Between 1967 and 1972 Medved had a rivalry with Turkish-Bulgarian wrestler Osman Duraliev. They met eight times in the finals of major international championships and Medved won on all occasions. He was close to losing at the 1971 World Championships in Sofia, where Duraliev led the match 4:3 with 43 seconds left. Yet Medved equalized the score and won the title because of his lower body weight.

After retiring from competitions in 1972 Medved moved to Belarus, where prior he served with the Soviet Army in the late 1950s. There he worked as a national coach and lectured at the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union he was appointed as vice-president of the Belarus Olympic Committee and of the Belarus Wrestling Federation. Previously he was awarded the Order of Lenin (1964), Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1970), and Order of the Badge of Honour (1964, 1969, 1985). In 2001 he was chosen as the best Belarusian athlete of the 20th century and in 2003 became one of the first 10 inductees to the FILA International Wrestling Hall of Fame. He is an honored citizen of Minsk, where since 1970s an annual wrestling tournament is held in his honor.

Medved was married to Tatyana, they had a daughter Yelena and son Aleksei. Yelena was a Belarusian tennis champion, while Aleksei won a junior world title in wrestling in 1987.

Medved died in Minsk on 2 September 2024, at the age of 86.

<text>Investcorp is a global manager of alternative investment products, for private and institutional clients. Founded in Bahrain in 1982, the firm has offices in United States, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, India, China, Japan, and Singapore. Investcorp&#x27;s principal client base is in the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, but it also has a growing base of institutional clients in North America, Europe, and Asia.

The group&#x27;s biggest external shareholder is Mubadala Investment Company, a $229 billion Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, which has a stake of 20 percent. The company&#x27;s main activities include private equity, real estate, and credit management, and has $50 billion worth of assets under management, as of April 2023.  

Investcorp has 7 asset classes which include private equity, real estate, credit, absolute return strategies, GP stakes, infrastructure, and insurance asset management.

== History ==
The company was co-founded in 1982 by Nemir Kirdar, Elias Hallak, Savio Tung, Mike Merritt, and Cem Cesmig and acquired Tiffany &amp; Co in 1984, floating in 1987. In 1988, Maurizio Gucci sold almost 47.8% of Gucci to Investcorp, and withheld the other 50% until 1993.

The company diversified in 1997 into hedge funds. Kirdar stepped down as CEO and executive chairman in 2015. With Kirdar resigning, Mohammad Alardhi became the Executive Chairman of the company. The changes also involved an update to the business model, which is now focused on raising funds, raising institutional capital, and diversifying strategies further.

Investcorp made several acquisitions between 2016 and 2019, pushing into China with investments into tech and the food sector. In 2019, the company also pushed into the US market with the acquisition of Mercury Capital, which ceased operations in late 2024 &quot;due to the very challenging capital raising environment&quot;. Investcorp&#x27;s portfolio company, Moneybookers, ended its relationship with WikiLeaks in August 2010.

The company was regulated in Bahrain as a wholesale bank until 2019, when it voluntarily surrendered its wholesale banking license. It remained listed on the Bahrain Bourse (BSE) for four decades until 2021, when it delisted itself as a result of low trading volumes.

<text>Henry Francis Lyte (1 June 1793 – 20 November 1847) was a Scottish Anglican divine, hymnodist and poet.

==Biography==
===Youth and education===
Henry Francis Lyte was the second son of Thomas and Anna Maria (née Oliver) Lyte, whose family came originally from Lytes Cary Manor. He was born at Ednam, near Kelso, Scotland. The Lyte family originated from Somerset in South West England and was one of considerable prominence as early as the reign of Edward I. Its seat was at Lytes Cary Manor, but the house passed out of the family in 1748.

Thomas Lyte, an army captain, does not seem to have formally married Anna Maria Oliver, although it has been argued that since they were accepted as husband and wife in Scotland where they lived, they were legally married according to Scottish law. Lyte&#x27;s father was described as a &quot;ne-er do-well ... more interested in fishing and shooting than in facing up to his family responsibilities&quot;. He deserted the family shortly after making arrangements for his two oldest sons to attend Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, in Ulster; and Anna moved to London, where both she and her youngest son died.

The headmaster at Portora, Robert Burrowes, recognised Lyte&#x27;s ability, paid the boy&#x27;s fees and &quot;welcomed him into his own family during the holidays&quot;. Lyte was effectively an adopted son.

===Religious conversion===
After studying at Trinity College, Dublin, and with very limited training for ordained ministry, Lyte took Anglican holy orders in 1815 and for some time he held a curacy in Taghmon near Wexford. Lyte&#x27;s &quot;sense of vocation was vague at this early stage. Perhaps he felt an indefinable desire to do something good in life&quot;. However, in about 1816, Lyte experienced an evangelical conversion. In attendance on a dying priest, the latter convinced Lyte that both had earlier been mistaken in not having taken the epistles of St Paul &quot;in their plain and literal sense&quot;. Lyte began to study the Bible &quot;and preach in another manner,&quot; following the example of four or five local clergy whom he had previously laughed at and considered &quot;enthusiastic rhapsodists&quot;.

===Early career and marriage===

In 1817 Lyte became a curate in Marazion, Cornwall, and there met and married Anne Maxwell, daughter of William Maxwell of a well-known Scottish-Irish family. She was 31, seven years older than her husband and a &quot;keen Methodist.&quot; Furthermore, she &quot;could not match her husband&#x27;s good looks and personal charm.&quot; Nevertheless, the marriage was happy and successful. Anne eventually made Lyte&#x27;s situation more comfortable by contributing her family fortune, and she was an excellent manager of the house and finances. They had two daughters and three sons, one of whom was the chemist and photographer Farnham Maxwell-Lyte. A grandson was the well known historian Sir Henry Churchill Maxwell-Lyte.

From 1820 to 1822 the Lytes lived in Sway, Hampshire. Itself only from the sea, the house in Sway was the only one the couple shared during their marriage that was neither on a river or by the sea. At Sway Lyte lost a month-old daughter and wrote his first book, later published as &quot;Tales In Verse Illustrative of the Several Petitions of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot; (1826). In 1822 the Lytes moved to Dittisham, Devon, on the River Dart and then, after Lyte had regained some measure of health, to the small parish of Charleton.

===Brixham===

About April 1824, Lyte left Charleton for Lower Brixham, a Devon fishing village. Almost immediately, Lyte joined the schools committee, and two months later he became its chairman. Also in 1824, Lyte established the first Sunday school in the Torbay area and created a Sailors&#x27; Sunday School. Although religious instruction was given there, the primary object of both was educating children and seamen for whom other schooling was virtually impossible. Each year Lyte organised an Annual Treat for the 800–1000 Sunday school children, which included a short religious service followed by tea and sports in the field.

Shortly after Lyte&#x27;s arrival in Brixham, the minister attracted such large crowds that the church had to be enlarged—the resulting structure later described by his grandson as &quot;a hideous barn-like building.&quot; Lyte added to his clerical income by taking resident pupils into his home, including the blind brother of Lord Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, later British prime minister. About 1830, Lyte made excavations at nearby Ash Hole Cavern, where he discovered pottery and human remains.

===Character and personality===

Lyte was a tall and &quot;unusually handsome&quot; man, &quot;slightly eccentric but of great personal charm, a man noted for his wit and human understanding, a born poet and an able scholar.&quot; He was an expert flute player and according to his great-grandson always had his flute with him. Lyte spoke Latin, Greek, and French; enjoyed discussing literature; and was knowledgeable about wild flowers. At Berry Head House, a former military hospital at Berry Head, Lyte built a library —largely of theology and old English poetry—described in his obituary as &quot;one of the most extensive and valuable in the West of England&quot;.

Lyte was also able to identify with his parish of fishermen, visiting them at their homes and on board their ships in harbour, supplying every vessel with a Bible, and compiling songs and a manual of devotions for use at sea. In theology he was a conservative evangelical who believed that man&#x27;s nature was totally corrupt. He frequently rose at 6 am and prayed for two or more hours before breakfast.

In politics, Lyte was a Conservative who feared revolt among the irreligious poor. He publicly opposed Catholic Emancipation by speaking against it in several Devon towns, stating that he preferred Catholics to be &quot;emancipated from priests and from the power of the factious and turbulent demagogues of Ireland&quot;. A friend of Samuel Wilberforce, Lyte also opposed slavery, organising an 1833 petition to Parliament requesting it be abolished in Great Britain.

===Decline and death===
In poor health throughout his life, Lyte suffered various respiratory illnesses and often visited continental Europe in attempts to check their progress. In 1835 Lyte sought appointment as the vicar of Crediton but was rejected because of his increasingly debilitating asthma and bronchitis. In 1839, when only 46, Lyte wrote a poem entitled &quot;Declining Days.&quot; Lyte also grew discouraged when numbers of his congregation (including in 1846, nearly his entire choir) left him for Dissenter congregations, especially the Plymouth Brethren, after Lyte expressed High Church sympathies and leaned towards the Oxford Movement.

By the 1840s, Lyte was spending much of his time in the warmer climates of France and Italy, making written suggestions about the conduct of his family&#x27;s financial affairs after his death. When his daughter was married to his senior curate, Lyte did not perform the ceremony. Lyte complained of weakness and incessant coughing spasms, and he mentions medical treatments of blistering, bleeding, calomel, tartar emetic, and &quot;large doses&quot; of Prussic acid. Yet his friends found him buoyant, cheerful, and keenly interested in affairs of the Europe around him. One of his last publications was the first full volume of Welsh poet Henry Vaughan’s works since his death in 1695, with a thirty-eight-page biographical sketch trying to reverse the poet’s lack of recognition. Lyte spent the summer of 1847 at Berry Head then, after one final sermon to his congregation on the subject of the Holy Communion, he left again for Italy. He died on 20 November 1847 at the age of 54, in the city of Nice, at that time in the Kingdom of Sardinia, where he was buried. His last words were &quot;Peace! Joy!&quot;

==Works==
Lyte&#x27;s first composition was &quot;Tales in Verse illustrative of Several of the Petitions in the Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot; (1826), written at Lymington and commended by John Wilson in the &quot;Noctes Ambrosianae&quot;. Lyte next published &quot;Poems, chiefly Religious&quot; (1833), and in 1834, a small collection of psalms and hymns entitled &quot;The Spirit of the Psalms&quot;. After his death, a volume of &quot;Remains&quot; (1850) with a memoir was issued, and the poems contained in this, with those in &quot;Poems, chiefly Religious&quot;, were afterward published in one volume (1868). Three of Lyte&#x27;s best-known hymns are paraphrases of psalms, published in &quot;The Spirit of the Psalms&quot;: &quot;Praise, my soul, the King of heaven&quot; (Psalm 103), &quot;God of Mercy, God of Grace&quot; (Psalm 67), and &quot;Pleasant are thy courts above&quot; (Psalm 84).

Lyte&#x27;s best known hymns are:
* Abide with me! fast falls the eventide
* 

===Abide with me===
Of these hymns, &quot;Abide with Me&quot; is the best known. According to the traditional story given in the &quot;Remains&quot;, Lyte wrote it a few hours after conducting the final service at his church, which was probably 5 September 1847. More likely the hymn was actually written in July or August of that year.

Lyte himself created for the hymn what his biographer has disparaged as &quot;a dull tune.&quot; When &quot;Hymns Ancient and Modern&quot; was published in 1861, the editor, William H. Monk—whose three-year-old daughter had just died—composed his own tune, &quot;Eventide,&quot; for Lyte&#x27;s poem.

The hymn became a favourite of Kings George V and George VI and was sung at the former&#x27;s funeral. The hymn also inspired Field Marshal Herbert Kitchener and General Charles &quot;Chinese&quot; Gordon, and it was said to have been on the lips of Edith Cavell as she faced a German firing squad in 1915.

&quot;Abide with Me&quot; has been sung prior to kick-off at the FA Cup Final since 1927 when the association secretary substituted the hymn for the playing of &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band.&quot; In Rugby league, the hymn has been sung before the Challenge Cup final since 1929, the first year the match was staged at Wembley Stadium. The hymn was also played by the combined bands of the Indian Armed Forces during the annual Beating Retreat ceremony held on 29 January at Vijay Chowk, New Delhi, which officially marks the end of Republic Day celebrations but was dropped by Narendra Modi&#x27;s government before the celebrations of Republic day events in the year 2022, citing its foreign origin not in agreement with India&#x27;s ancient republican ideas. The hymn is the Portora Royal School victory song and is sung at its remembrance service.

==Significance==
Leon Litvack has written in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; that although Lyte&#x27;s &quot;poetic energies were directed at scripturally and evangelically minded audiences, his lyric gift was universally appreciated. The example of ‘Abide with me’ is instructive: intensely personal and contemplative, yet nationally popular—even being sung (always, after its publication in 1861, to W. H. Monk&#x27;s tune, ‘Eventide’) on secular occasions such as at football matches, and especially, since 1927, at the English cup final.&quot; The 20th-century hymnologist Erik Routley referred to the &quot;much-loved H. R. Lyte&quot; who &quot;though scriptural and evangelical in his emphases, always writes good literature and is rarely deserted by an exquisite lyric gift. Perhaps the centrally &#x27;romantic&#x27; hymn of all hymns is the intensely personal yet, as it has proved, wholly universal hymn, &#x27;Abide with me.&#x27;&quot;

<text>Roberval () is a city on the south-western shore of Lac Saint-Jean in the Le Domaine-du-Roy Regional County Municipality of Quebec, Canada. With a population of 9,840 in the Canada 2021 Census, it is the fourth largest city on this lake after Alma, Dolbeau-Mistassini and Saint-Félicien.
It is the seat of the Domaine-du-Roy RCM and the main service centre for the region with a hospital and some government services. It is also the seat of the judicial district of Roberval.

It is the only Lac Saint-Jean town whose core is directly on the lakeshore.

Benoît Bouchard, former cabinet Minister and Canadian Ambassador in France, and Michel Gauthier, former federal Leader of the Opposition, represented the area in the federal parliament. Bernard Lord the former Premier of New Brunswick was born here.

Roberval was the 2008 winner of &quot;Kraft Hockeyville&quot;. In their newly renovated arena, Roberval hosted an NHL preseason game between the Montreal Canadiens and the Buffalo Sabres on September 23, 2008.

Roberval is the home of the Traversée internationale du lac St-Jean, an annual swimming competition held since 1955. The major competition feature the crossing of Lake St-Jean over a distance of . The 2010 FINA World Open Water Swimming Championships were also hosted in Roberval.

==History==
Circa 1850, the first settlers began to colonize the area, followed afterwards by families especially from the Charlevoix area. The settlement, the oldest village on the shores of Lake Saint-Jean, was first known as Notre-Dame-du-Lac-Saint-Jean, named after the parish founded in 1854. A few years later in 1857, the Municipality of Lac-Saint-Jean was formed but in 1859 was split into several municipalities including the Municipality of Roberval. It was named after the geographic township of Roberval, which in turn was named by surveyor Joseph Bouchette in honour of the first Lieutenant General of New France Jean-François de la Roque de Roberval (1496–1560). In 1862, the Roberval post office opened.
In 1884, the settlement separated from the municipality to form the Village Municipality of Roberval. It experienced rapid growth in the 1880s when Horace Jansen Beemer, an American entrepreneur from Philadelphia, came to Roberval. He established logging and sawmill businesses and led the construction of the railroad to Quebec City in 1888. Beemer personally took care of logging, land speculation, and construction of railway bridges. He also built a tourist complex in Roberval in 1898, centred on fishing for landlocked salmon and organized excursions to the Grande Décharge (outlet of Lake Saint-Jean). A fire destroyed the Grand Hotel Roberval in 1908, putting an abrupt end to luxury tourism in the Lake Saint-Jean area.

In 1903, the village of Roberval gained town (&quot;ville&quot;) status, and in 1956, city (&quot;cité&quot;) status. In 1976, it merged with the Municipality of Roberval to form the current city.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Roberval has a cold and highly seasonal humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;), with mild summers, cold winters and high annual snowfall. Due to seasonal lag and influence from the nearby lake, September is well above the subarctic threshold as the fourth warmest month.

== Education ==
Roberval has two primary schools: Notre-Dame et Benoît-Duhamel and a secondary school la Cité Étudiante. There are also two centres for adult training: Ste-Ursules et le Centre de formation professionnelle (CFP).

=== The Ursulines ===
Founded in 1882 by Sister Saint-Raphaël, the Ursuline convent was the first domestic sciences school in Canada. There was also an agricultural school.

Fires in 1897 and 1919 led to rebuilding and improvement of facilities.

Following a fire in 2005, a portion of the convent was replaced by the Jardin des Ursulines, a craft vendors market. In 2011, after 129 years of service to the community, the Ursuline community left Roberval.

<text>Camlann Medieval Village is a living history museum which recreates rural life in England in 1376, located in Carnation, Washington; it is run by the Camlann Medieval Association, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational corporation founded in 1981.


==Bors Hede Inne==
The Bors Hede Inne is a dinner theater restaurant, open year round by reservation. The food is prepared from recipes found in historical medieval cookbooks, and served by in-character interpreters. The Bors Hede is patterned after an actual late medieval inn, which would expect to serve the well-to-do. Upon arrival, guests are provided with Borde knives and spoons, and genteel laving (handwashing) before being presented with a trencher, a flat half of bread, which serves as a plate. Throughout the meal they are periodically visited by a minstrel who plays songs appropriate to the period.

==Feasts==
Public feasts are held throughout the year in the inn&#x27;s undercroft feast hall, on occasions such as Lent or St. George&#x27;s Day. These feasts are two or three courses, with about six dishes per course. Feast also feature songs from the minstrel, or other entertainment appropriate to the feast&#x27;s particular theme.

==Village life==
The village is open each weekend from May to the end of September. Visitors may explore the buildings and speak with volunteers playing the part of villagers going about their daily tasks such as cooking, dyeing, practicing archery, or daubing homes. Others perform various crafts such as blacksmithing, carpentry or sewing. They are trained to speak from an authentic point of view, about their personal histories and local events.

On festival days, regular villagers are joined by minstrels, puppeteers, magicians or armored knights.

<text>Marta Teresa Smith de Vasconcellos Suplicy (; born 18 March 1945) is a Brazilian politician and psychologist. She was Mayor of São Paulo from 2001 to 2004. She later served as the Brazilian Minister of Tourism between 14 March 2007, and 4 June 2008, when she resigned to run again for the mayoralty of São Paulo. In 2015, she left the Brazilian Workers&#x27; Party (PT), but she returned to the party in January 2024 in order to be the running mate of Guilherme Boulos in the 2024 São Paulo mayoral election.

==Career==
Marta Suplicy attended Michigan State University (1966–68), and Pontifícia Universidade Católica de São Paulo (1969–75); she did graduate work at Stanford University (1973). Suplicy started her career as a TV anchorwoman, providing sex advice on a popular show named &quot;TV Mulher&quot; (Woman TV), broadcast by Rede Globo. 

=== PT ===
While serving as Congresswoman, she proposed a gay civil unions act. After running for governor of São Paulo and losing to Mário Covas of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) in 1998, she was elected mayor of the state capital, São Paulo, in 2000.

==== Mayor of São Paulo ====
Her administration of the city is marked by the changes she made to the city&#x27;s bus system, creating a ticket that is valid for a period of two hours, called &quot;bilhete único&quot;. In the public educational system she created large schools and cultural centers, called &quot;CEU&quot;, which were built in the poorest districts of the city. Towards the end of her administration, she began the construction of several underpasses which alleviated traffic in certain points of the city. She also increased many existing municipal taxes as well as creating new ones. In 2004, she ran for a second term, but was unseated by former PSDB presidential candidate José Serra.

==== National Politics ====
On 14 March 2007, Suplicy accepted the Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&#x27;s invitation to become the new Minister of Tourism. Later that same year, on 13 June 2007, when interviewed about the 2006–2007 Brazilian aviation crisis, Suplicy suggested that users of the Congonhas Airport in São Paulo who suffered long delays while heading for vacation should &quot;relax and enjoy because they will forget the troubles afterwards&quot; (Portuguese: &quot;relaxa e goza porque você vai esquecer dos transtornos.&quot;). Her speech included a &quot;double entendre&quot;, as the word she used for &quot;enjoy&quot; can also refer to an orgasm.

On 3 October 2010, Suplicy was elected for the Federal Senate of Brazil, becoming the top voted female Senator ever, receiving over 8.3 million votes. She is also the first female ever elected Senator from São Paulo, the most populous state of Brazil. She promised to fight for the approval of PLC 122, a bill criminalizing homophobia, and also reintroduced the same-sex civil unions bill. The latter received its first victory in the Senate Human Rights Committee on 24 May 2012.

=== MDB ===
In 2016, after leaving the PT and joining the PMDB, Suplicy vigorously supported Vice President Michel Temer and President of Congress Eduardo Cunha in the move to impeach her former political party colleague President Dilma Rousseff. Suplicy&#x27;s decision was deemed divisive by many, including her son, Supla, who proclaimed, &quot;Minha mãe é golpista, meu pai é petista e eu sou anarquista. Momentos políticos difíceis, né&quot; (&quot;My mother is a coup-plotter, my father is a member of the PT, and I am an anarchist. Difficult times, huh?&quot;).

==Family==
Suplicy has three sons, one of whom is the musician Supla. From 1965 to 2001, she was married to Eduardo Suplicy, a PT Brazilian senator from the state of São Paulo who is the father of her children. Later, she married Luis Favre, whom she divorced after a relationship of nearly eight years. She currently dates Márcio Toledo, ex-president of the Jockey Club of São Paulo.

<text>Earlestown railway station is a railway station in Earlestown, Merseyside, England, and one of the few &quot;triangular&quot; stations in Britain.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
The station lies on the former Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which was opened on 15 September 1830. The station opened with the commencement of passenger services on 17 September. The station was not originally called Earlestown; it was listed as Viaduct, Newton Junction and Warrington Junction in timetables during its early years of operation. By 1861, it was known as Earlestown Junction until 5 June 1950, when the &#x27;Junction&#x27; suffix was dropped.

On 25 July 1831 the Warrington and Newton Railway was opened for public use, making a junction at a point in the township of Newton, facing in the direction of Liverpool.

The surviving Earlestown station buildings were constructed around 1835 on the original site, at the point of intersection of these two early railways, incidentally forming the first steam railway junction, which was given the name Newton Junction.

The junction had a very tight curvature and this caused problems. Train travelling on the curves were restricted to a slow maximum speed. The original building now forms the (currently unused) waiting room of Earlestown Station.

The Grand Junction Railway (GJR) absorbed the Warrington and Newton company as of 31 December 1834 and from the GJR&#x27;s completion of their trunk line from Birmingham on 4 July 1837 used it to access the Liverpool and Manchester line. A new &quot;Curve&quot; was built at Newton Junction so that trains could run towards Manchester; this gave the station a triangular formation with six platforms. To complicate matters, there was also a branch line from Richard Evans&#x27;s collieries at Haydock which had a curve to join the L &amp; M in the Manchester direction and passed through the triangle to join the Warrington and Newton line.

The method of operation involved the despatch of a Grand Junction train from both Liverpool and Manchester to meet at Earlestown. These were joined together and continued as one train to Birmingham. Both portions conveyed through carriages after 1839 to London. The Grand Junction trains arriving from Birmingham were usually split at Warrington (Bank Quay) and passed through Earlestown as separate Liverpool and Manchester trains.

An area between the station and the &quot;Nine Arches&quot; viaduct was selected in 1833 by Messrs Jones, Turner and Evans as the site of their Viaduct Locomotive Works. In 1853, the London and North Western Railway took a lease on the premises and thus established the company&#x27;s carriage and wagon works, and the area developed into something of a &#x27;company town&#x27; which, after the construction of company houses, was given the nickname &quot;Earle&#x27;s Town&quot; after Hardman Earle, a director of the company and its predecessors, the Liverpool &amp; Manchester and Grand Junction Railways. The name has stuck, despite it being corrupted to its present version and never having been an actual town.

The London and North Western Railway later operated their main line service to the Scottish border by way of Earlestown and Parkside, utilising a short section of the old Liverpool and Manchester line. This inconvenient routing was eliminated by the construction of the Golborne cut-off, a direct connection avoiding Earlestown. The original route, on the eastern section of the triangle, was electrified at as part of the West Coast Main Line electrification, since it was then used by a few trains stopping at Earlestown.

In the Beeching Report of 1963, Earlestown was listed as one of the stations to be closed, but it remained open along with other stations between Liverpool and Manchester that had also been listed such as and . However, direct trains to via were withdrawn in 1964.

The remaining parts of the station were electrified as part of the North West electrification, which was announced in July 2009. This project saw the original West Coast Main Line electrification joined to the Manchester to Liverpool electrification at the east and south sides of Earlestown station. This electrification work was completed in February 2015.

At present, there are frequent services to , , , , and then via the North Wales Coast Line to .

Scheduled electrically-operated passenger services commenced from the station during March 2015, when the Liverpool Lime Street to Manchester Airport service converted from diesel to electric traction. Previously, despite the long-standing electrification of part of the station, no electrically operated passenger services were scheduled to call at Earlestown.

==Historical status==
The triangular track layout at Earlestown (originally named Newton Junction) represents the oldest junction in the world between two passenger railways, in the form of the first &quot;stationary turntable&quot; or wye ever constructed. Nearby on the line towards Liverpool is the Sankey Viaduct, the first mainline railway viaduct which crosses the Sankey Canal: that means that one of the earliest passenger railways crosses the first canal of the industrial revolution.

Earlestown is one of two triangular railway stations left in the UK, the other being in West Yorkshire

The waiting room on the Liverpool-bound platform is the oldest station building in the world still in passenger service, although this is now limited to providing shelter from the rain under its canopy. The building is currently derelict, with tickets being sold in a more recent structure on the opposite side of the line.

==Facilities==

The ticket office is staffed for the duration of service here each day (06:00 to midnight weekdays and Saturdays, 08:30 to midnight Sundays). Digital information screens, timetable poster boards and automatic announcements provide train running information. All platforms have either shelters or canopies. Only platforms 1 and 5 have step-free access, as the others are reached via the stepped footbridge between platforms 1 and 2.

<doc id="1014852" wikidata="Q5055308" url="?curid=1014852" title="Cayetano Garza">
<text>Cayetano &#x27;Cat&#x27; Garza (born October 15, 1972) is a comic artist, cartoonist, illustrator, and musician in the United States. He is best known for his experiments with webcomics.

Garza has been published in various anthologies and publications. He is considered by Scott McCloud, author of &quot;Understanding Comics&quot;, as a pioneer in the area of web design and interface for online comics. Garza is featured in McCloud&#x27;s sequel to &quot;Understanding Comics&quot;, &quot;Reinventing Comics&quot;, and on his website. He has also been featured in &quot;Toon Art: The Graphic Art of Digital Cartooning&quot; by Steven Withrow.

==Biography==

Garza was born and raised in the Rio Grande Valley in the city of Harlingen, Texas on October 15, 1972. His interest in comics stems from a day in his early youth when, as a six-year-old child, his mother bought him his first comic, an issue of &quot;The Flash&quot;. In second grade he sold homemade comics with a cast characters that included the likes of &quot;Glue Man&quot; to his classmates for a quarter or their lunch ticket. As a child he typically read superhero comics, but what really caught his attention was the humor comic &quot;Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!&quot;. He also read a number of comic strips, including &quot;Peanuts&quot; and &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;.

Garza&#x27;s formal artistic training started with a few high school art courses. He went on to get his Bachelor of Fine Arts at UTPA, concentrating on studio art. He started grad school, dropped out after only one year.

Creating strips throughout high school and college Garza was heavily influenced by the comic scene in Austin, Texas, including artists who had strips in &quot;The Daily Texan&quot;, such as Chris Ware, Walt Holcombe, Shannon Wheeler, Robert Rodriguez, Tom King, Lance Myers, and Korey Coleman. Many of his comics during this period contain reflections of youthful righteous indignation directed at the atrocities of the world.

As a student at UTPA, Garza had access to a free website provided by the university. This was the catalyst for the idea of publishing strips online. In 1996, he put samples of his work online for publishers to see when he sent them submissions packages. Soon after it occurred to him that using the web he could self-publish. To create his comics he hand codes HTML in combination with GIF and JPEG images.

After college he spent a while in Austin as a street artist. He appeared in &quot;Adventures Into Digital Comics&quot;, a 2006 documentary on the comics industry.

In 2009 his webcomic &quot;The Year of The Rat&quot; won the Ignatz Award for Outstanding Online Comic.

In addition to his work as a comic artist, Garza is also a musician. He played guitar in the Vermont band, The Wheelers before returning to Texas in 2011.

Garza&#x27;s current comic strip, &quot;Whimville&quot;, runs daily. His other ongoing comic strip for &quot;Modern Tales&quot;, &quot;Cuentos De La Frontera&quot;, has been featured in articles in news outlets such as &quot;Wired&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot;, and &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;.

<doc id="1014857" wikidata="Q7363749" url="?curid=1014857" title="Ron Evans (politician)">
<text>Ron Evans (born 1957) is a former clergyman and politician in Manitoba, Canada. He is the former Chief for the Norway House Cree Nation and former Grand Chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs. A former priest in the Anglican Church of Canada, Evans is also a prominent figure in the Aboriginal community of northern Manitoba. He unsuccessfully sought election to both the Manitoba Legislature and the House of Commons of Canada, and has served as a band councillor and chief.

Evans was born and raised in Norway House, Manitoba, and was educated in Winnipeg, Calgary and La Tuque, Quebec. Prior to his career with the clergy and politics, Evans was a truck driver and commercial fisherman. As a priest, Evans is a member of the Diocesan Council in the Anglican Diocese of Keewatin and a member of the &quot;Anglican Council of Indigenous People&quot;. He served as a band councillor in Norway House from 1980 to 1988, and was the band&#x27;s acting chief for two years during this period. He was elected as the band&#x27;s chief in 1996, was re-elected in 1998 and 2002, and was also an executive councillor in the Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak and the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs. He stepped down as chief of Norway House Cree Nation to run for the AMC leadership. In addition to his political work, Evans is a member of the &quot;Norway House Fisherman&#x27;s Co-op&quot;, and, until 2018, held a commercial fishing license. In 1998, Evans was presented with &quot;The Order of the Buffalo Hunt&quot; (late replaced by the Order of Manitoba) from then-Premier Gary Filmon.

In the 1999 provincial election, Evans was a candidate of the governing Progressive Conservative Party in the northern riding of The Pas. Despite the unpopularity of the Progressive Conservative party in other northern ridings, Evans&#x27;s personal popularity was such that he was almost able to defeat the riding&#x27;s incumbent MLA, New Democrat Oscar Lathlin (who is also aboriginal). Lathlin received 2952 votes, Evans 2737.

For the federal election of 2000, Evans switched parties and sought the Liberal nomination in the riding of Churchill. He was defeated by former MLA and MP Elijah Harper, who in turn lost to NDP candidate Bev Desjarlais in the general election.

Evans again ran for the Liberal nomination in the 2004 election, this time successfully. Once again, his personal popularity was such that he was able to run a credible campaign against a popular incumbent; nevertheless, he was defeated by Desjarlais by 8612 votes to 7604.

Evans was elected Grand Chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs (AMC) in 2005, a provincial body which advocates on behalf of all of Manitoba&#x27;s First Nations. He was re-elected in August 2008. Marcel Balfour replaced Evans as chief of Norway House. 

Evans decided not to seek a third term at AMC and on July 22, 2011 was re-elected chief of Norway House Cree Nation. He was defeated as chief by Larson Anderson in 2018 and stripped of his fishing licence by the Fisherman&#x27;s Co-Op. As of the summer, 2019, Evans was campaigning for the Conservatives in The Pas (which no longer includes Norway house) in the 2019 provincial election.

<text>In much of the &quot;Old World&quot; (approximately Africa, Asia and Europe) the names of many places cannot easily be interpreted or understood; they do not convey any apparent meaning in the modern language of the area. This is due to a general set of processes through which place names evolve over time, until their obvious meaning is lost. In contrast, in the &quot;New World&quot; (roughly North America, South America, and Australasia), many place names&#x27; origins are known.

Although the origin of many place names is now forgotten, it is often possible to establish likely meanings through consideration of early forms of the name. Some general conclusions about the nature of place names, and the way in which place names change, can be made and are examined below. It is also possible to distinguish regional trends and differences in the naming of places, as is also discussed below.

==Types of place name==
There are several clearly definable types of place name, the primary division being between the names of natural features and the names of human settlements. That the latter are &#x27;places&#x27; is obvious. The case is slightly more ambiguous for natural features, depending on how exactly &#x27;place&#x27; is defined, and what exactly the concept of a &#x27;place&#x27; is used for. If, as is probable, natural features were originally given names to distinguish nearby hills, streams etc. from each other, then these features can be thought of as places, in that they represent distinct geographic locations. However, as names are applied on a larger scale, they may become less useful as place names. 

For instance, a relatively small, distinct upland valley (e.g. Swaledale) clearly represents a definable geographic location. However, the broad, extended valley of a major river, such as the Trent, is not easily understood as a single location. That notwithstanding, it is probable that the origins of the names of both settlements and natural features is the same, namely to distinguish one from another; and thus that both should be considered place names.

Many other types of place name can be defined, for example those relating to tribal or personal names. Previously names relating to pagan religion were extensively studied as these were thought to be early. Another class studied was those relating to particular people, example: the Ancient British.

The place names also can be based upon the nature of the occupation of the people in that area or the particular function performed by the people in that area.

==Toponymic processes==
There are identifiable processes which occur over time to place names, and which alter the place names in such a way that their original meanings are lost. These apply to both the names of settlements and natural features, although more so to the former.

The processes by which place names change include abbreviation, conflation, convergence, development in the parent language (but stasis in the place name) and replacement of the parent language. The latter in particular can result in dramatic shifts in place names, since the original meaning (and often sounds) are not conveyed in the new language, the place name thus shifts to a form appropriate for the new language.

*Abbreviation tends to break down a name into a more easily pronounced form, e.g.&quot;Cantwaraburh&quot; to &quot;Canterbury&quot;; &quot;Dornwaracaster&quot; to &quot;Dorchester&quot;; &quot;Eborakon&quot; (through &quot;Eoforwīc&quot; and &quot;Jorvik&quot;) to &quot;York&quot;.
*Conflation is where two similar elements of place names become confused, for instance the Old English roots &quot;den&quot; (hill) and &quot;don&quot; (valley) are conflated in place names e.g. &quot;Willesden&quot; (&#x27;stream hill&#x27;), &quot;Croydon&quot; (&#x27;crocus valley&#x27;).
*Convergence occurs when place names drift towards other familiar phonemes in place names; e.g. in &quot;Abingdon&quot; (&quot;Aebbeduna&quot;, &#x27;Aebbe&#x27;s hill&#x27;), the middle sound has converged to the familiar &#x27;ing&#x27; found in many place names (usually meaning &#x27;people of&#x27;).
*Evolution of the parent language may not change a place name by itself; indeed names may show more inertia to change than languages themselves. However, evolution of the parent language permits other processes to occur. For instance, if a name no longer means anything in the modified language, it may drift towards a new form; e.g. &quot;Maethelac&quot; (&#x27;Moot-oak&#x27;) to &quot;Matlock&quot;. Or, as the parent language changes, attributes which already form part of a name may be appended to the name. For instance &quot;Portsea Island&quot; (&#x27;Port-island island&#x27;); once the meaning of &quot;Portsea&quot; became obscure, it became necessary to add &quot;island&quot;.
*Replacement of the parent language is one of the most dramatic processes of change. If, for whatever reason, a new language becomes spoken in the area, a place name may lose all meaning. At its most severe, the name may be completely replaced. However, often the name may be recycled and altered in some way. Typically, this will be in one of the above ways; as the meaning of place-name is forgotten, it becomes changed to a name suitable for the new language. For instance Brittonic &quot;Eborakon&quot; (perhaps &#x27;place of the yew trees&#x27;) became Anglo-Saxon &quot;Eoforwic&quot; (&#x27;Boar-town&#x27;), then Old Norse &quot;Jorvik&quot; (&#x27;Horse-bay&#x27;), and modern English &quot;York&quot;.
*Elaboration of place names often occurred to make distinctions between similarly named settlements. For instance, in England, two nearby and related settlements often became &#x27;lower/nether&#x27; and &#x27;upper/higher&#x27;; or &#x27;little&#x27; and &#x27;great&#x27; (or the equivalent in Latin, &quot;parva&quot; and &quot;magna&quot;). Alternatively, two geographically separated places might be distinguished by local features; e.g. &quot;Newcastle-under-Lyme&quot; and &quot;Newcastle upon Tyne&quot;; or &quot;Newton-le-Willows&quot;, &quot;Newton-by-Frodsham&quot;, &quot;Newton under Roseberry&quot; (and so on). In England, many additions were made in the medieval period, to show that settlements were ruled by certain families, e.g. as &quot;Stoke Mandeville&quot;. Some elaborations (particularly in Latin) date back to medieval times, such as &quot;Weston-super-Mare&quot; (&#x27;Weston-on-sea&#x27;), while others were added relatively recently, for instance &quot;Bognor Regis&quot; (&#x27;Bognor of the King&#x27;).
*Backformation: the process whereby names are derived from one another in the opposite direction to that which would be expected - in many cases a river with an obsolete or forgotten name is renamed after a town on its banks rather than vice versa. For example, the river running through Rochdale became known as the &#x27;Roch&#x27; through this process. Cambridge perhaps uniquely illustrates both normal and back formation. Originally &quot;Grantabrice&quot;, a bridge on the Granta, the name became &quot;Cantebrugge&quot;, and then &quot;Cambrigge&quot;, from which the river was renamed &#x27;Cam&#x27;.

==Problems of interpretation==
Place names often need specialists to interpret their meanings. Some of the main problems are:

*Language. Sometimes the language used in the formation of a place name is unclear; for example, some names may be plausibly derived from either Old English or Celtic roots. In recent years there has been a tendency to seek Celtic origins for names in England that were previously taken to be Anglo-Saxon.
*Element order. In Germanic languages, and thus in Old English and Old Norse, the substantive element is generally preceded by its modifier, such as &quot;north farm&quot; (&quot;Norwich&quot;), &quot;Badecca&#x27;s spring&quot; (&quot;Bakewell&quot;). In Celtic place names the order is usually reversed with the thing being described (hill, valley, farm, etc.) as the first element, for example &quot;settlement of the Cuebris&quot; (&quot;Tregonebris&quot;), &quot;mouth of the Dee&quot; (&quot;Aberdeen&quot;). However, this is not true of all Celtic names, for example &quot;bald hill&quot; (&quot;Malvern&quot;).
*Translation. The general similarity of Old Norse and Old English meant that the place names in the Danelaw were often simply &quot;norsified&quot;. For instance, in &quot;Askrigg&quot; (&#x27;ash (tree) ridge&#x27;) in Yorkshire, the first element is indubitably the Norse &quot;asc&quot; (pronounced ask), which could easily represent a &quot;norsification&quot; of the Old English element &quot;aesc&quot; (pronounced ash) with the same meaning.
*False analogy. Sometimes, however, the place names were changed by new settlers to match pronunciation habits without reference to the original meaning. For example, the Old English name &quot;Scipeton&quot; (&quot;sheep farm&quot;), which would normally become *&quot;Shipton&quot; in modern English, instead was altered to &quot;Skipton&quot;, since Old English &quot;sc&quot; (pronounced &#x27;sh&#x27;) was usually cognate with Old Norse &quot;sk&quot; — thus obscuring the meaning, since the Old Norse word for &#x27;sheep&#x27; was entirely different.
*Lost reason. Interpreting some names can be difficult if the reason for the name is no longer evident. Some names originally referred to a specific natural feature such as a river, ford or hill that can no longer be identified. For example, &quot;Whichford&quot; (Warwickshire) means &quot;the ford of the Hwicce&quot;, but the location of the ford is lost.
*Confusion between elements. Pairs of original elements can produce the same element in a modern place name. For example, the Old English elements &quot;den&quot; (valley) and &quot;dun&quot; (hill) are sometimes confused, as they can now lack obvious meanings. Croy&quot;don&quot; is in a valley and Willes&quot;den&quot; is on a hill.
*Multiple meanings. Some elements, such as &quot;wich&quot; and &quot;wick&quot;, can have many meanings. Generally &quot;wich/wick/wyke&quot; indicates a farm or settlement (e.g. &quot;Keswick&quot; &quot;cheese farm&quot;). However, some of the sites are of Roman or early Post-Roman origin, in which the &quot;wich&quot; represents Latin &quot;vicus&quot; (&quot;place&quot;). These &quot;vici&quot; seem to have been trading-posts. On the coast, &quot;wick&quot; is often of Norse origin, meaning &quot;bay&quot; or &quot;inlet&quot; (e.g. &quot;Lerwick, Scotland, Runswick, North Riding&quot;).

==Names of landscape features==
The names of natural or man-made features in the landscape tend to be older than those of settlements since the former are often more widely known. Names are given to water features, hills and valleys, islands and marshes, as well as woods and districts. Man-made landscape features that have been given names include roads and trackways as well as burial mounds, etc. Many topographic elements become incorporated into settlement names, together with plant, creature names or personal names. Many topographical words convey not just an image of the place but also a wealth of information about the likely size, status and pattern of farming practised by the community living there.

Water was of major importance to the early settlers of an area, both for subsistence and for religious reasons. Names were given to springs, streams, rivers and lakes as well as marshes, bays and seas. Eilert Ekwall carried out an early study of river names in England while Krahe conducted a European-wide examination of river names which showed that there were common roots in the names over a wide area. There is still controversy over the language of these roots. Sometimes a generic word was adopted as a specific label, for example the Celtic word for river was &quot;afon&quot;, which is used in many cases as the name (Avon) of rivers in England.

Land characteristics were important to both hunters and farmers, and there are many terms relating to different types of hills and valleys. Some terms, like &quot;cumb&quot; and &quot;penn&quot;, were adopted from Celtic by Anglo-Saxons. Other terms relate to the expansion of farming.

Topographical names were held in low esteem by early place name scholars but their importance was raised in a book by Margaret Gelling, first published in 1978. This discusses the many elements of topographical place names, with updates in 1988 and 1997.

==Names of settlements==
Most pre-modern settlement names contain a generic element describing the place&#x27;s function (e.g. &#x27;farm&#x27;, &#x27;market&#x27;, &#x27;fort&#x27;) or a prominent natural feature, or both; if only one of these is present, it is often modified by a personal name or an adjective.

For instance, examples from England:
*Personal name + function + feature - Todmorden - &#x27;Totta&#x27;s boundary valley&#x27;
*Personal name + function - Grimsby - &#x27;Grimr&#x27;s farm&#x27;
*Existing name + function - Exeter - &#x27;River Exe (Roman) fort&#x27;
*Function + natural feature - Church Fenton - &#x27;Marsh Farm (with a church)&#x27;
*Personal name + natural feature - Barnsley - &#x27;Beorn&#x27;s clearing&#x27;
*Existing name + natural feature - Cockermouth - &#x27;River Cocker mouth&#x27;
*Function - Keswick - &#x27;Cheese farm&#x27;
*Natural feature - Blackburn - &#x27;Black stream&#x27;

These basic elements can also be found in place names in other countries; e.g., Amsterdam (&#x27;River Amstel dam&#x27;), Liechtenstein (&#x27;Light-stone&#x27;), Copenhagen (equivalent to “chapmen’s haven”), Paris (&#x27;Home of the Parisii&#x27;), Shanghai (approximately &#x27;Seaport&#x27;), Tashkent (&#x27;Stone city&#x27;). These elements are also clearly present in the less &#x27;weathered&#x27; New World place names - e.g. Fort Knox, Thunder Bay, Little Rock and so on. Carson City, for instance, was named for Kit Carson, and Belo Horizonte means &quot;beautiful view&quot;. However, some apparent meanings may be deceptive; New York was not directly named after the English city of York but after the Duke of York, who was the head of the British Navy at the time of the British take-over, and Los Angeles was not named after angels but after the Virgin Mary, or the Queen of the Angels (El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Angeles).

Countries which have seen repeated large-scale cultural and/or linguistic changes, such as England or France, tend to have more broken down place names, as the original meaning is forgotten and drifts more quickly. They may also have more linguistically diverse place names; for instance in England place names may have Pre-Celtic, Celtic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Norse, or Norman-French origins. Conversely, countries with a more uniform cultural and linguistic history tend to have less broken down and diverse place namesWales for instance (especially when compared to neighbouring England).

==Place name origins in Britain and Ireland==

Various names have been used for the island of Britain, see Britain (name). The origin of place names of the countries within Britain are discussed below. Each country is divided into a number of counties. 

===England===

Most English place-names are either Anglo-Saxon or Old Norse in origin but Celtic names are to be found over the whole country, most notably in Cornwall (see below) and counties bordering Wales. Other place-names are hybrids of Celtic and Anglo-Saxon elements. There is a high level of personal names within the place names, presumably the names of local landowners at the time of naming. In the north and east, there are many place names of Norse origin; similarly, these contain many personal names. In general, the Anglo-Saxon and Norse place names tend to be rather mundane in origin, the most common types being [personal name + settlement/farm/place] or [type of farm + farm/settlement] (almost all towns ending in -wich, -ton, -ham, -by, -thorpe, -stoke/stock are of these types).

In Shropshire and Herefordshire many Welsh place names are found in the borderlands such as Pontrilas and Trefonen.
In Cornwall most place-names are Cornish in origin, whilst in Cumbria there remain a number of place names in Cumbric, the Brythonic language of this region; examples including Carlisle, Helvellyn and Blencathra.
Most old Roman settlements, whether actually inhabited or not, were given the title of &quot;-chester/caster&quot; in Anglo-Saxon (from the Latin &quot;castrum&quot;, &#x27;camp&#x27; or its plural form &quot;castra&quot;); the specific names for each may only have little relation to the Roman names (e.g. Chester - &#x27;Deva&#x27;, Winchester - &#x27;Venta Belgarum&#x27; etc.).

Many English places derive part of their name from the river upon which they were built, but in the 16th century many English rivers were renamed with back-formations from towns on their banks. Cambridge, perhaps uniquely, illustrates both effects: originally &quot;Grontabricc&quot;, a bridge on the Granta, the name became &quot;Cantebruge&quot; and then &quot;Cambrugge&quot;, from which the river was renamed Cam. The scholars of Oxford renamed the upper course of the River Thames running through Oxford to Dorchester-on-Thames as the &quot;Isis&quot;, owing to an incorrect assumption that the Latin name of the river, Tamesis, represented a combination of &quot;Thame&quot; (a river that joins the Thames at Dorchester) and &quot;Isis&quot;.

One place in Yorkshire which retains Celtic toponymy is Pen-y-ghent (one of the Yorkshire Three Peaks), whose name means Hill-by-the-Border in Cumbric, a Brittonic language.

===Wales===

The vast majority of place names in Wales are Welsh by origin, containing elements such as Llan-, Aber-, Pen- etc. Along the south coast of Wales, where English has historically been more widely spoken, many place names are commonly anglicized, such as Pontypool, derived from &quot;Pont-y-Pŵl&quot;. Many places throughout Wales have alternative names in English unrelated to the name in Welsh, for example, Newport (where the Welsh name &quot;Casnewydd&quot; means &quot;New Castle&quot;) and Swansea (derived from the Norse meaning &quot;Svein&#x27;s island&quot;) for the Welsh &quot;Abertawe&quot; (Mouth of the River Tawe. In some cases these are in fact related to their Welsh name, but disguised through linguistic processes of consonant mutation, for example Monmouth and the Welsh &quot;Trefynwy&quot; both referring to the River Monnow (Mon- &lt; Monnow &lt; &quot;Mynwy&quot; &gt; &quot;-fynwy&quot;).

Welsh place names tend to be associated with natural features rather than people, hence elements describing rivers, hills and valleys are common. The exceptions are places with the prefix &quot;Llan&quot;, meaning &#x27;Church&#x27;, which often contain the name of the Saint the church is dedicated to, e.g. Llansantffraid - &#x27;Church of St. Bridget&#x27;.

===Scotland===

In the islands of Scotland, particularly Orkney and Shetland, but also the Western Isles, there are many names of Norse origin; this is also true on Caithness and other coasts of the mainland.

In the Highlands, the names are primarily in Scottish Gaelic, with emphasis on natural features; elements such as Glen- (valley) and Inver- (confluence, mouth) are common. These have replaced Pictish names that still occur on the east coast.

In lowland Scotland, names are of more diverse origin. Many are Gaelic, but many are also from the Brythonic branch of Celtic languages (such as Ayr). There are also place names from Old English and Scots, such as Edinburgh.

===Isle of Man===
Most place-names are of Gaelic or Norse origin but there are traces of an earlier language in some names.

===Channel Islands===
Most place names derive from Norman-French.

===Ireland===

The vast majority of placenames in Ireland are anglicizations (adaptations to English phonology) of Irish language names. However, some names come directly from the English language or Scots language, and a handful come from Old Norse.

==Place name origins in the United States==
Place names in the United States are often taken from the European nation that first colonized the land. Many names that have been transferred from Britain, as is the case with Barnstable, Massachusetts and Danbury, Connecticut. Many others are of French origin, such as Detroit, Michigan, which was established along the banks of the river they called &quot;le détroit du lac Érié&quot;, meaning the strait of Lake Erie. Many in the former New Netherland colony are of Dutch origin, such as Harlem, Brooklyn and Rhode Island. Many place names are taken from the languages of native peoples. Specific (personal or animal) names and general words or phrases are used, sometimes translated and sometimes not.

A great many names that appear to be Native American in origin were created by non-Natives with at best a rudimentary grasp of native languages. Pasadena, California&#x27;s early Anglo residents, looking for a pleasant sounding (euphonious) name for the town, used the Ojibwe word &quot;pa-sa-de-na&quot;, which means &quot;of the valley&quot;. Similarly, Negaunee, Michigan&#x27;s name is derived from the Ojibwe word &quot;nigani&quot; meaning &quot;foremost, in advance, leading&quot;, which was determined to be the closest Ojibwe approximation to the English word &quot;pioneer&quot;.

Nine counties in the U.S. state of Michigan have names invented by Henry Schoolcraft, usually adapted from parts of Native American words, but sometimes having parts from Greek, Arabic and Latin roots. &quot;(see List of counties in Michigan.)&quot; In some cases the native meanings of a place name are wholly lost, despite guesses and theories, for example Tampa and Oregon.

Place names in the United States tend to be more easily traceable to their origins, such as towns simply named after the founder or an important politician of the time, with no alterations except a simple suffix, like -town. Carson City, for instance, was named for Kit Carson. In the 21st century, real estate developers often conduct historical research in order to craft a name for a modern development that connects to the local history of the community.

==Place name origins in Canada==
French, English, Latin and Gaelic derived names occur in Canada. There are also Indigenous place names.

==Place name origins in Australia==
Australian place names are mainly a mixture of Indigenous and British-derived toponyms.

==Place name origins in New Zealand==
New Zealand place names derive mostly from Maori and from British sources. The Maori named most of New Zealand&#x27;s natural features. When Europeans began arriving in New Zealand from the 17th century they gave their own names to many geographical features and settlements, often after places in Britain or important settlers or famous British people. Recently there has been a movement to revive some Maori names.

<doc id="1014878" wikidata="Q1919504" url="?curid=1014878" title="Mellel">
<text>Mellel (, the Hebrew for &quot;text&quot;) is a word processor for Mac OS X, developed since 2002 and marketed as especially suited for technical and academic writers, and for writers with long, complex documents. It is made by Mellel AAR, a small software company. New features are added to the program every few months, many of which come from user suggestions. Its closest competitor is Nisus Writer Pro.

One remarkable feature present in Mellel is its multilanguage support. Languages with non-Latin alphabets, including Arabic, Syriac, Hebrew, Greek, Korean or Persian, for example, are handled well due to the fact that Mellel sports its own text engine, that is not reliant on macOS text support, and in addition support for Unicode and OpenType fonts.

Mellel also presents a feature set suitable for working with long and complex documents, in order to match the needs of scholars and technical writers. Mellel has a distinctive way of handling footnotes and endnotes, allowing creation of numerous &quot;streams&quot; of notes in a single document. This feature allows inclusion of three or more footnote types at the same time (e.g., editor notes, translator notes, endnotes, regular notes, etc.). Cross-references are also dealt with in a singular way by Mellel. The software offers support for Outline, based on headings in the document text. With Mellel 4.0 the software added an Index tool which according to the company website &quot;rivals dedicated Index applications&quot;. Mellel has a unique way of handling styles, which are also organised as part of a style set, that can be utilised by multiple documents. Its Replace Styles feature is able to reformat a large amount of text scattered throughout a document (a feature also present in OpenOffice.org Writer and in Nisus Writer for Mac OS Classic).

Due to its unique approach to implementing many of its features, Mellel originally lacked full compatibility with standard word processors, but--as of July 2020--Mellel exports accurately to .docx and to ePub according to the developer&#x27;s website. From the outset, Mellel has exported accurately to .pdf. 

Mellel provides tight integration with Bookends and Sente, bibliographical tools for managing citations, including Live Bibliography (instant updates of Bibliography when one adds a citation). 

A version of Mellel is available for the iPad.

Owners of Mellel announced in January 2011 that they will give free updates for life for anyone who will purchase the application outside the Mac App Store. As per the company, this policy was dropped in February 2014. With the release of Mellel 4.0 Mellel AAR, the developer, announced that a for fee upgrade policy was re-instated (two years of free updates). This policy does not apply to users who&#x27;ve purchased Mellel during the &quot;lifetime&quot; period.

The current version of Mellel, 6.0, reportedly supports MacOS 10.15.x.

<doc id="1014883" wikidata="Q2564544" url="?curid=1014883" title="Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine">
<text>Harrison&#x27;s Principles of Internal Medicine is an American textbook of internal medicine. First published in 1950, it is in its 21st edition (published in 2022 by McGraw-Hill Professional ) and comes in two volumes. Although it is aimed at all members of the medical profession, it is mainly used by internists and junior doctors in this field, as well as medical students. It is widely regarded as one of the most authoritative books on internal medicine and has been described as the &quot;most recognized book in all of medicine.&quot;

The work is named after Tinsley R. Harrison of Birmingham, Alabama, who served as editor-in-chief of the first five editions and established the format of the work: a strong basis of clinical medicine interwoven with an understanding of pathophysiology.

==History==
It was published in 1950 by Blakiston. Creator and editor Tinsley Harrison&#x27;s quotation appeared on the first edition of this book in 1950: Blakiston was acquired by McGraw-Hill in 1954.
The 17th edition of the textbook is dedicated to George W. Thorn, who was editor of the first seven editions of the book and editor in chief of the eighth edition. He died in 2004.

The 18th edition of the book () was edited by Anthony Fauci, Dennis Kasper, Stephen Hauser, J. Larry Jameson and Joseph Loscalzo. New chapters added include &quot;Systems Biology in Health and Disease,&quot; &quot;The Human Microbiome,&quot; &quot;The Biology of Aging,&quot; and &quot;Neuropsychiatric Illnesses in War Veterans.&quot;

The 19th edition of the book was edited by Dennis Kasper, Anthony Fauci, Stephen Hauser, Dan Longo, J. Larry Jameson and Joseph Loscalzo.

AL.com in December 2014 wrote that it was still &quot;a best-selling internal medicine text in the United States and around the world,&quot; and that it had been reprinted 16 times and translated into 14 languages.

The 20th edition of the book, edited by Dennis Kasper, Anthony Fauci, Stephen Hauser, Dan Longo, J. Larry Jameson and Joseph Loscalzo, was released on 17 August 2018.

The 21st edition of the book was released on 28 March 2022.

<text>Louise Abbéma (30 October 185329 July 1927) was a French painter, sculptor, and designer of the Belle Époque.

==Biography==
Abbéma was born in Étampes, Essonne. She was born into a wealthy Parisian family, who were well connected in the local artistic community. Her great-grandmother was the actress Louise Contat. She began painting in her early teens, and studied under such notables of the period as Charles Joshua Chaplin, Jean-Jacques Henner and Carolus-Duran. She first received recognition for her work at age 23 when she painted a portrait of Sarah Bernhardt, her lifelong friend and possibly her lover.

She went on to paint portraits of other contemporary notables, and also painted panels and murals which adorned the Paris Town Hall, the Paris Opera House, numerous theatres including the &quot;Theatre Sarah Bernhardt&quot;, and the &quot;Palace of the Colonial Governor&quot; at Dakar, Senegal. She had an academic and impressionistic style, painting with light and rapid brushstrokes.

She was a regular exhibitor at the Paris Salon, where she received an honorable mention for her panels in 1881. Abbéma was also among the female artists whose works were exhibited in the Women&#x27;s Building at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago. A bust Sarah Bernhardt sculpted of Abbéma was also exhibited at the exposition.

Abbéma specialized in oil portraits and watercolors, and many of her works showed the influence from Chinese and Japanese painters, as well as contemporary masters such as Édouard Manet. She frequently depicted flowers in her works. Among her best-known works are &quot;The Seasons&quot;, &quot;April Morning, Place de la Concorde&quot;, &quot;Among the Flowers&quot;, &quot;Winter&quot;, and portraits of actress Jeanne Samary, Emperor Dom Pedro II of Brazil, Ferdinand de Lesseps, and Charles Garnier.

Abbéma was also an accomplished printmaker, sculptor, and designer, as well as a writer who made regular contributions to the journals &quot;Gazette des Beaux-Arts&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Art&quot;. She also illustrated several books, including la mer, René Maizeroy.

Among the many honors conferred upon Abbéma was Palme Academiques, 1887 and nomination as &quot;Official Painter of the Third Republic.&quot; She was also awarded a bronze medal at the 1900 Exposition Universelle. In 1906 she was decorated as Chevalier of the Order of the Légion d&#x27;honneur.

She never married and there has been longtime speculations that she was a lesbian. This however was never openly stated by her and she actually opposed women&#x27;s wearing masculine clothing and even feminism and the suffragette movement.

Abbéma died in Paris in 1927. At the end of the 20th century, as contributions by women to the arts in past centuries received more critical and historical attention, her works have been enjoying a renewed popularity. Abbéma was included in the 2018 exhibit &quot;Women in Paris 1850-1900&quot;.

As educational opportunities were made more available in the 19th century, women artists became part of professional enterprises, including founding their own art associations. Artwork made by women was considered to be inferior, and to help overcome that stereotype women became &quot;increasingly vocal and confident&quot; in promoting women&#x27;s work, and thus became part of the emerging image of the educated, modern and freer &quot;New Woman&quot;. Artists then, &quot;played crucial roles in representing the New Woman, both by drawing images of the icon and exemplifying this emerging type through their own lives,&quot; including Abbéma who created androgynous self-portraits to &quot;link intellectual life through emphasis on ocularity&quot;. Many other portraits included androgynously dressed women, and women participating in intellectual and other pastimes traditionally associated with men.

<doc id="1014899" wikidata="Q712502" url="?curid=1014899" title="Prince Henri, Duke of Aumale">
<text>Henri Eugène Philippe Louis d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Aumale (16 January 1822 – 7 May 1897) was a leader of the Orleanists, a political faction in 19th-century France associated with constitutional monarchy. He was born in Paris, the fifth son of King Louis-Philippe I of the French and Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily and used the title Duke of Aumale. 

Aumale became an infantry officer and saw active service in the French conquest of Algeria and in 1847 was appointed as its Governor-General. After the French Revolution of 1848, he went to live in England, where he pursued historical interests. The Franco-Prussian War enabled him to return to France, where he was elected to parliament and the Académie française. In 1872, he returned to the army as a Divisional General, and from 1879 to 1883 was inspector-general of the army.

An important art collector, Aumale left his Château de Chantilly to the Institute of France, to display his collection.

==Early life==


Born at the Palais Royal in Paris, the young Henri was brought up by his parents in relative simplicity. At the age of eight, he inherited a fortune of 66 million livres (approximately £200 million today), the lands and wealth of his godfather, Louis Henri de Bourbon, Prince of Condé, the last Prince of Condé. This inheritance included the famous Château de Chantilly, the Château d&#x27;Écouen, and the domaines of Saint-Leu, Taverny, Enghien, Montmorency, and Mortefontaine. 

He was educated at the Collège Henri IV, then at the age of seventeen entered the French army with the rank of a captain of infantry.

==Marriage and children==
On 25 November 1844, aged 22, Aumale married in Naples his first cousin Princess Maria Carolina of the Two Sicilies, a daughter of Leopold of the Two Sicilies, Prince of Salerno, and Archduchess Maria Clementina of Austria. The couple had several children, of whom two reached adulthood, but still predeceased him:

#Louis Philippe Marie Léopold d&#x27;Orléans, Prince of Condé (15 November 1845 – 24 May 1866), died unmarried and childless. 
#Henri Léopold Philippe Marie d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Guise (11 September 1847 – 10 October 1847), died in infancy.
#Stillborn daughter (16 August 1850).
#François Paul d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Guise (11 January 1852 – 15 April 1852), died in infancy.
#François Louis Philippe Marie d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Guise (5 January 1854 – 25 July 1872), died unmarried.
#Stillborn son (May 1857).
#Stillborn son (15 June 1861).
#Stillborn son (June 1864).

==Career==
Aumale distinguished himself during the French invasion of Algeria and, in 1847, he became lieutenant-general and was appointed Governor-General of Algeria, a position he held from 27 September 1847 to 24 February 1848.

In this capacity, he received the submission of the emir Abdel Kadir, in December 1847. After the Revolution of 1848, he retired to England and busied himself with historical and military studies, responding in 1861 to Napoleon III&#x27;s violent attacks upon the House of Orléans with a &quot;Letter upon History of France&quot;.

After the Bavarian-born King Otto of Greece was overthrown in October 1862, the Greeks still favoured a monarchy and wanted Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as their new king, but he declined. In the search for a king, the French put forward the name of Aumale, while other contenders included Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the Prince of Leiningen, and Archduke Maximilian of Austria. Eventually, the choice fell on Prince William of Denmark, aged only seventeen, and the Greek National Assembly elected him as the new King of the Hellenes in March 1863.

At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, Aumale volunteered for service in the French army, but his offer was declined. Elected to parliament as deputy for the Oise, he returned to France. He also succeeded to the seat of the Count Montalembert in the Académie française. 

In March 1872, he returned to the army as a Divisional General and in 1873 presided over the court-martial which condemned Marshal Bazaine to death.

At this time, having been appointed commander of the VII Army Corps at Besançon, Aumale retired from political life. In 1879, he became inspector-general of the army. The act of exception, passed in 1883, deprived all members of families who had reigned in France of their military commissions. Consequently, Aumale was placed on the unemployed supernumerary list.

In 1886, another law was promulgated which expelled from French territory the heads of former reigning families and provided that, henceforward, all members of those families should be disqualified from holding any public position or function and from election to any public body. Aumale protested energetically but was nonetheless expelled from France.
In his will, written on 3 June 1884, Aumale had bequeathed his Chantilly estate to the Institute of France, including the Château de Chantilly, which was to be turned into a museum displaying his large art collection. After this act of generosity was revealed, the French government withdrew the decree of exile, and the duke returned to France in 1889.

==Bibliophile==

Aumale was a notable collector of antique books and manuscripts and owned the important medieval Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry. Most of his collection is still at Chantilly.

==Death==
Henri d&#x27;Orléans, duc d&#x27;Aumale, died in Lo Zucco, Sicily. After the fire of the Bazar de la Charité on 4 May 1897, which killed 126 people, mostly aristocratic women, he wanted to send his condolences to the families of the victims. After writing twenty letters, he suffered a cardiac arrest and died. He was buried in Dreux, in the chapel of the Orléans.

<doc id="1014906" wikidata="Q867330" url="?curid=1014906" title="Cyclomatic complexity">
<text>Cyclomatic complexity is a software metric used to indicate the complexity of a program. It is a quantitative measure of the number of linearly independent paths through a program&#x27;s source code. It was developed by Thomas J. McCabe, Sr. in 1976.

Cyclomatic complexity is computed using the control-flow graph of the program. The nodes of the graph correspond to indivisible groups of commands of a program, and a directed edge connects two nodes if the second command might be executed immediately after the first command. Cyclomatic complexity may also be applied to individual functions, modules, methods, or classes within a program.

One testing strategy, called basis path testing by McCabe who first proposed it, is to test each linearly independent path through the program. In this case, the number of test cases will equal the cyclomatic complexity of the program.

==Description==
===Definition===

There are multiple ways to define cyclomatic complexity of a section of source code. One common way is the number of linearly independent paths within it. A set formula_1 of paths is linearly independent if the edge set of any path formula_2 in formula_1 is not the union of edge sets of the paths in some subset of formula_4. If the source code contained no control flow statements (conditionals or decision points) the complexity would be 1, since there would be only a single path through the code. If the code had one single-condition IF statement, there would be two paths through the code: one where the IF statement is TRUE and another one where it is FALSE. Here, the complexity would be 2. Two nested single-condition IFs, or one IF with two conditions, would produce a complexity of 3.

Another way to define the cyclomatic complexity of a program is to look at its control-flow graph, a directed graph containing the basic blocks of the program, with an edge between two basic blocks if control may pass from the first to the second. The complexity is then defined as

formula_5

where
* = the number of edges of the graph.
* = the number of nodes of the graph.
* = the number of connected components.

An alternative formulation of this, as originally proposed, is to use a graph in which each exit point is connected back to the entry point. In this case, the graph is strongly connected. Here, the cyclomatic complexity of the program is equal to the cyclomatic number of its graph (also known as the first Betti number), which is defined as
formula_6

This may be seen as calculating the number of linearly independent cycles that exist in the graph: those cycles that do not contain other cycles within themselves. Because each exit point loops back to the entry point, there is at least one such cycle for each exit point.

For a single program (or subroutine or method), always equals 1; a simpler formula for a single subroutine is
formula_7

Cyclomatic complexity may be applied to several such programs or subprograms at the same time (to all of the methods in a class, for example). In these cases, will equal the number of programs in question, and each subprogram will appear as a disconnected subset of the graph.

McCabe showed that the cyclomatic complexity of a structured program with only one entry point and one exit point is equal to the number of decision points (&quot;if&quot; statements or conditional loops) contained in that program plus one. This is true only for decision points counted at the lowest, machine-level instructions. Decisions involving compound predicates like those found in high-level languages like codice_1 should be counted in terms of predicate variables involved. In this example, one should count two decision points because at machine level it is equivalent to codice_2.

Cyclomatic complexity may be extended to a program with multiple exit points. In this case, it is equal to
formula_8
where formula_9 is the number of decision points in the program and is the number of exit points.

===Algebraic topology===
An even subgraph of a graph (also known as an Eulerian subgraph) is one in which every vertex is incident with an even number of edges. Such subgraphs are unions of cycles and isolated vertices. Subgraphs will be identified with their edge sets, which is equivalent to only considering those even subgraphs which contain all vertices of the full graph.

The set of all even subgraphs of a graph is closed under symmetric difference, and may thus be viewed as a vector space over GF(2). This vector space is called the cycle space of the graph. The cyclomatic number of the graph is defined as the dimension of this space. Since GF(2) has two elements and the cycle space is necessarily finite, the cyclomatic number is also equal to the 2-logarithm of the number of elements in the cycle space.

A basis for the cycle space is easily constructed by first fixing a spanning forest of the graph, and then considering the cycles formed by one edge not in the forest and the path in the forest connecting the endpoints of that edge. These cycles form a basis for the cycle space. The cyclomatic number also equals the number of edges not in a maximal spanning forest of a graph. Since the number of edges in a maximal spanning forest of a graph is equal to the number of vertices minus the number of components, the formula formula_10 defines the cyclomatic number.

Cyclomatic complexity can also be defined as a relative Betti number, the size of a relative homology group:

formula_11

which is read as &quot;the rank of the first homology group of the graph &quot;G&quot; relative to the terminal nodes &quot;t&quot;&quot;. This is a technical way of saying &quot;the number of linearly independent paths through the flow graph from an entry to an exit&quot;, where:
* &quot;linearly independent&quot; corresponds to homology, and backtracking is not double-counted;
* &quot;paths&quot; corresponds to first homology (a path is a one-dimensional object); and
* &quot;relative&quot; means the path must begin and end at an entry (or exit) point.

This cyclomatic complexity can be calculated. It may also be computed via absolute Betti number by identifying the terminal nodes on a given component, or drawing paths connecting the exits to the entrance. The new, augmented graph formula_12 obtains
formula_13

It can also be computed via homotopy. If a (connected) control-flow graph is considered a one-dimensional CW complex called formula_14, the fundamental group of formula_14 will be formula_16. The value of formula_17 is the cyclomatic complexity. The fundamental group counts how many loops there are through the graph up to homotopy, aligning as expected.

=== Interpretation ===
In his presentation &quot;Software Quality Metrics to Identify Risk&quot; for the Department of Homeland Security, Tom McCabe introduced the following categorization of cyclomatic complexity:

* 1 - 10: Simple procedure, little risk
* 11 - 20: More complex, moderate risk
* 21 - 50: Complex, high risk
* &gt; 50: Untestable code, very high risk

==Applications==
===Limiting complexity during development===
One of McCabe&#x27;s original applications was to limit the complexity of routines during program development. He recommended that programmers should count the complexity of the modules they are developing, and split them into smaller modules whenever the cyclomatic complexity of the module exceeded 10. This practice was adopted by the NIST Structured Testing methodology, which observed that since McCabe&#x27;s original publication, the figure of 10 had received substantial corroborating evidence. However, it also noted that in some circumstances it may be appropriate to relax the restriction and permit modules with a complexity as high as 15. As the methodology acknowledged that there were occasional reasons for going beyond the agreed-upon limit, it phrased its recommendation as &quot;For each module, either limit cyclomatic complexity to [the agreed-upon limit] or provide a written explanation of why the limit was exceeded.&quot;

===Measuring the &quot;structuredness&quot; of a program===
Section VI of McCabe&#x27;s 1976 paper is concerned with determining what the control-flow graphs (CFGs) of non-structured programs look like in terms of their subgraphs, which McCabe identified. (For details, see structured program theorem.) McCabe concluded that section by proposing a numerical measure of how close to the structured programming ideal a given program is, i.e. its &quot;structuredness&quot;. McCabe called the measure he devised for this purpose essential complexity.

To calculate this measure, the original CFG is iteratively reduced by identifying subgraphs that have a single-entry and a single-exit point, which are then replaced by a single node. This reduction corresponds to what a human would do if they extracted a subroutine from the larger piece of code. (Nowadays such a process would fall under the umbrella term of refactoring.) McCabe&#x27;s reduction method was later called &quot;condensation&quot; in some textbooks, because it was seen as a generalization of the condensation to components used in graph theory. If a program is structured, then McCabe&#x27;s reduction/condensation process reduces it to a single CFG node. In contrast, if the program is not structured, the iterative process will identify the irreducible part. The essential complexity measure defined by McCabe is simply the cyclomatic complexity of this irreducible graph, so it will be precisely 1 for all structured programs, but greater than one for non-structured programs.

===Implications for software testing===
Another application of cyclomatic complexity is in determining the number of test cases that are necessary to achieve thorough test coverage of a particular module.

It is useful because of two properties of the cyclomatic complexity, , for a specific module:
* is an upper bound for the number of test cases that are necessary to achieve a complete branch coverage.
* is a lower bound for the number of paths through the control-flow graph (CFG). Assuming each test case takes one path, the number of cases needed to achieve path coverage is equal to the number of paths that can actually be taken. But some paths may be impossible, so although the number of paths through the CFG is clearly an upper bound on the number of test cases needed for path coverage, this latter number (of &quot;possible&quot; paths) is sometimes less than .

All three of the above numbers may be equal: branch coverage formula_18 cyclomatic complexity formula_18 number of paths.

For example, consider a program that consists of two sequential if-then-else statements.
if (c1())
 f1();
else
 f2();

if (c2())
 f3();
else
 f4();

In this example, two test cases are sufficient to achieve a complete branch coverage, while four are necessary for complete path coverage. The cyclomatic complexity of the program is 3 (as the strongly connected graph for the program contains 9 edges, 7 nodes, and 1 connected component) ().

In general, in order to fully test a module, all execution paths through the module should be exercised. This implies a module with a high complexity number requires more testing effort than a module with a lower value since the higher complexity number indicates more pathways through the code. This also implies that a module with higher complexity is more difficult to understand since the programmer must understand the different pathways and the results of those pathways.

Unfortunately, it is not always practical to test all possible paths through a program. Considering the example above, each time an additional if-then-else statement is added, the number of possible paths grows by a factor of 2. As the program grows in this fashion, it quickly reaches the point where testing all of the paths becomes impractical.

One common testing strategy, espoused for example by the NIST Structured Testing methodology, is to use the cyclomatic complexity of a module to determine the number of white-box tests that are required to obtain sufficient coverage of the module. In almost all cases, according to such a methodology, a module should have at least as many tests as its cyclomatic complexity. In most cases, this number of tests is adequate to exercise all the relevant paths of the function.

As an example of a function that requires more than mere branch coverage to test accurately, reconsider the above function. However, assume that to avoid a bug occurring, any code that calls either codice_3 or codice_4 must also call the other. Assuming that the results of codice_5 and codice_6 are independent, the function as presented above contains a bug. Branch coverage allows the method to be tested with just two tests, such as the following test cases:

* codice_5 returns true and codice_6 returns true
* codice_5 returns false and codice_6 returns false

Neither of these cases exposes the bug. If, however, we use cyclomatic complexity to indicate the number of tests we require, the number increases to 3. We must therefore test one of the following paths:

* codice_5 returns true and codice_6 returns false
* codice_5 returns false and codice_6 returns true

Either of these tests will expose the bug.

===Correlation to number of defects===
Multiple studies have investigated the correlation between McCabe&#x27;s cyclomatic complexity number with the frequency of defects occurring in a function or method. Some studies find a positive correlation between cyclomatic complexity and defects; functions and methods that have the highest complexity tend to also contain the most defects. However, the correlation between cyclomatic complexity and program size (typically measured in lines of code) has been demonstrated many times. Les Hatton has claimed that complexity has the same predictive ability as lines of code.
Studies that controlled for program size (i.e., comparing modules that have different complexities but similar size) are generally less conclusive, with many finding no significant correlation, while others do find correlation. Some researchers question the validity of the methods used by the studies finding no correlation. Although this relation likely exists, it is not easily used in practice. Since program size is not a controllable feature of commercial software, the usefulness of McCabe&#x27;s number has been questioned. The essence of this observation is that larger programs tend to be more complex and to have more defects. Reducing the cyclomatic complexity of code is not proven to reduce the number of errors or bugs in that code. International safety standards like ISO 26262, however, mandate coding guidelines that enforce low code complexity.

<text>The scarce swallowtail (&quot;Iphiclides podalirius&quot;) is a species of butterfly belonging to the family Papilionidae. It is also called the sail swallowtail or pear-tree swallowtail.

==Subspecies==
Subspecies include:

*&quot;Iphiclides podalirius centralasiae&quot; 
*&quot;Iphiclides podalirius persica&quot; 
*&quot;Iphiclides podalirius podalirius&quot; (Central and Southern Europe)
*&quot;Iphiclides podalirius virgatus&quot; 
*&quot;Iphiclides podalirius xinyuanensis &quot; China (Xinyuan)

Else see:
*&quot;Iphiclides podalirius feisthamelii&quot; (North Africa, Spain and southwest France), often treated as a valid species, &quot;Iphiclides feisthamelii&quot;.

==Distribution==
Despite the name &quot;scarce swallowtail&quot;, this species is quite common. The scarcity of United Kingdom migrants is responsible for the English vernacular name. This species is widespread in the East Palearctic realm and in most of Europe with the exception of the northern parts. Its range extends northwards to Lower Lusatia and central Poland and eastwards across Asia Minor and Transcaucasia as far as the Arabian Peninsula, Pakistan, India and western China. A few specimens of the scarce swallowtail have been reported from central Sweden and the United Kingdom but they were probably only strays and not migrants.

==Habitat==
These swallowtail butterflies inhabit gardens, towns as well as the countryside, in fields and open woodlands. They are found in places with sloe thickets and particularly orchards. In the Alps they can be found up to altitudes of 2000 m, but usually they prefer foothills and lower levels.

The presence of &quot;Iphiclides podalirius&quot; in the floodplain of the Morava River in the Slovak Republic have been found to be a good indicator of relatively well preserved grassland habitats with forest-steppe vegetation, which have no cutting history.

==Status==
In some years the scarce swallowtail is quite abundant. The scarce swallowtail is getting rarer as blackthorn bushes are being cleared. The butterfly is now protected by law in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Russia, Ukraine, Poland and Macedonia . It is considered rare and endangered and protected in some provinces of Austria and of indeterminate status throughout Europe. In Armenia the species demonstrates stable population trend and is evaluated as Least Concern. Though referred by some authorities to be of status &quot;vulnerable&quot;, it is however unlisted in the IUCN Red List.

==Description==
&quot;Iphiclides podalirius&quot; has a wingspan of in males, of in females. It is a very large distinctive butterfly. The background color of the wings is creamy white or pale yellow. On the front wings there are six tiger stripes and wedge-shaped markings. At the outer edge of the hind wings there are blue crescent markings, with an oblong, orange spot at the back corner and a relatively long tail.

This species is rather similar to &quot;Papilio machaon&quot;, &quot;Papilio hospiton&quot;, &quot;Papilio alexanor&quot; and &quot;Protographium marcellus&quot;.

==Biology==

Adults of &quot;Iphiclides podalirius&quot; fly from March to October. There are one, two, or three generations a year. Caterpillars are polyphagous feeding on &quot;Crataegus&quot; (Finland), &quot;Crataegus monogyna&quot; (Palaearctic), &quot;Malus pumila&quot; and &quot;Malus domestica&quot; (Palaearctic), &quot;Prunus&quot; (Finland, Palaearctic), &quot;Prunus armeniaca&quot; (Palaearctic, Spain), &quot;Prunus avium&quot; (Palaearctic, Spain) &quot;Prunus cerasus&quot; (Palaearctic, Russia), &quot;Prunus domestica&quot; (Palaearctic), &quot;Prunus dulcis&quot; (Palaearctic, Spain), &quot;Prunus padus&quot; (Palaearctic), &quot;Prunus persica&quot; (Palaearctic), &quot;Prunus spinosa&quot; (Palaearctic), &quot;Pyrus&quot; (Palaearctic) and &quot;Sorbus aucuparia&quot; (Palaearctic).

The caterpillars spin little pads on leaves and grip them firmly. The newly hatched caterpillar is dark in colour with two smaller and two bigger greenish patches on the dorsal side; later they are greenish with yellowish dorsal and side stripes. The summer chrysalids are green as a rule, the hibernating ones are brown. A number of hibernating chrysalids fall prey to various enemies. The caterpillars of the scarce swallowtail have been noted to leave silk trails from the permanent resting sites to feeding sites. This has been seen in both solitary and territorial larvae with larvae having the ability to discern their trails from those of others.

Research on pupae of &quot;Iphiclides podalirius&quot; in Spain indicates that the pupae manifest in two colours, green and brown, for the purpose of camouflage. The green pupae develop on host plants and develop directly while brown pupae enter into diapause in the leaf litter. Pupating larvae tend to form green pupae before August while after August they tend to form brown pupae. Duration of the or light period appears to be the mechanism which dictates the path of development of the pupa. The results suggest that the green pupa develop on food plants to avoid predation by small mammals and visual avian predators while the brown pupa develop on leaf litter to avoid avian predators.

<text>The Type 97 was a diameter torpedo used by the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. Intended for use with Japan&#x27;s &quot;Kō-hyōteki&quot;-class midget submarines, the torpedo was based on the 24-inch diameter Type 93 &quot;Long Lance&quot; used by Japanese surface vessels, but redesigned to meet the smaller 18-inch physical dimensions of the midgets&#x27; two torpedo tubes. Larger Japanese submarines were armed with the 21-inch Type 95 torpedo.

It was not a great success. Its first operational use was in the attack on Pearl Harbor, after which it was modified as the Type 97 Special, sometimes known as the Type 98. It had a warhead and a range of at .

==Type 97 Special==
Four Type 97 Special torpedoes were fired during the Japanese midget submarine raid on Sydney Harbour in the early hours of June 1, 1942. Two were fired by the midget &quot;M-24&quot; and aimed at the American heavy cruiser USS &quot;Chicago&quot;, then tied to the No 2. buoy at Garden Island in Sydney Harbour. Both missed. One struck the harbour wall beneath the depot ship HMAS &quot;Kuttabul&quot;, sinking the converted ferry and killing 19 Australian and 2 British sailors aboard. The second failed to arm, and ran harmlessly aground at Garden Island.

The remaining two were fired in Sydney Harbour by the midget &quot;M-21&quot;. The timing of their firing and their target, if any, are unknown. &quot;M-21&quot; had been rammed and depth charged by HMAS &quot;Yandra&quot; at the entrance to Sydney Harbour around 2300 on May 31, but managed to recover sufficiently to enter the harbour at 03:01 on June 1. &quot;M-21&quot; was eventually cornered and sunk at 05:15 on June 1 in Taylors Bay inside Sydney Harbour. When the wreck was raised on June 4, both torpedoes had been fired. However the bow caps covering the torpedo tubes failed to drop clear, instead remaining caught in the buckled bow cage of the submarine. The No. 1 torpedo travelled approximately three feet clear of the tube before jamming. The No. 2 torpedo travelled before it too jammed.

<text>The label Progressive-Conservative was used by some candidates for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1925, 1926, 1930 and 1935 federal elections. The term probably indicates that these candidates were supporters of both the Progressive Party of Canada and the Conservative Party.

In 1942, the Conservative Party renamed itself the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada when the former Progressive Premier of Manitoba, John Bracken, became the party leader. Most Progressives, however, had previously joined the Liberal Party of Canada.

The only &quot;Progressive-Conservative&quot; candidate to be elected to the House of Commons was Errick Willis.

Willis first sought election to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1926 federal election as a &quot;Progressive-Conservative&quot; candidate in the riding of Souris, Manitoba. He was defeated by Progressive candidate James Steedman, who won 6,105 votes to Willis’ 4,946 votes.

In the 1930 federal election, Willis, again running as a &quot;Progressive-Conservative&quot; defeated Steedman 6,252 to 5,780.

After serving in the Conservative back-benches for five years, Willis sought re-election as a &quot;Progressive-Conservative&quot;, but was defeated in the 1935 federal election by George William Macdonald, running as a Liberal-Progressive candidate. Willis lost by only three votes, placing second out of four candidates, with 4,501 votes (42.5% of the total).

Willis later became leader of the Manitoba Conservative Party in 1936, and served until 1954, by which time it had taken the name, &quot;Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba&quot;.

<doc id="1014939" wikidata="Q1186085" url="?curid=1014939" title="Kakuma">
<text>Kakuma is a town in northwestern Turkana County, Kenya. It is the site of a UNHCR refugee camp, established in 1992. The population of Kakuma town was 60,000 in 2014, having grown from around 8,000 in 1990. In 1991, the camp was established to host unaccompanied minors who had fled the war in Sudan, Somalia and from camps in Ethiopia. It was estimated that there were 12,000 &quot;lost boys and girls&quot; who had fled here via Egypt in 1990/91.

Kakuma is situated in the second poorest region in Kenya and as a result of this poverty, there are ongoing tensions between the refugees and the local community that has occasionally resulted in violence. Compared to the wider region, the Kakuma camp has better health facilities and a higher percentage of children in full-time education, which resulted in a general notion that the refugees were better off than the locals. The host community is composed largely of nomadic pastoralists who stick to their traditions and do not co-operate with refugees. Camp is becoming a normal part of the regional socio-economic landscape and a part of livelihood options available in the region. Kakuma is one of two large refugee camps in Kenya; the second and bigger one is Dadaab.

Malnutrition, communicable disease outbreaks, and malaria are all ongoing problems, while donor support has faltered due to conflicts in other parts of the world. Many people in Kakuma are long-term refugees, living in hopelessness and desperation. The situation is particularly bad for young people. Many of the refugees hope to leave Kakuma for third country resettlement in another country. For example, the &quot;Lost Boys of Sudan&quot; were a special group who were resettled from the camp to the United States.

==Climate==
Semi-arid climate with average temperatures reaching 40 °C and only drop to the low 30&#x27;s at night: dry and windswept, dust storms. Kakuma is wedged between two dry river-beds, and the occasional rain can lead to flooding.

The only plants that survive are thorny bushes and a few flat-topped trees. As agriculture is almost impossible this results in fierce competition among different local groups for ownership of cattle. Refugees are not allowed to keep animals, due to the potential for conflict between the refugees and the local Turkana people. This camp was made because of the Lost boys even though they were not all boys.

==Camp structure==
The complex comprises four parts (Kakuma I-IV), and is managed by the Kenyan government and the Kenyan Department of Refugee Affairs in conjunction with the UNHCR. As of December 2020, the site hosts around 200,000 people, mostly refugees from the civil war in South Sudan.

Staff members are housed outside the camp in three large compounds with various amenities.

The 5pm curfew at the camp means no help available for refugees after 5pm. Don Bosco has special role in the camp because they are the only workers who can help refugees in emergency situations at night.

Each ethnic community occupies a separate and somewhat discrete location. Each neighbourhood built its own market stands, coffee shops, library, and places of worship.

===Aid agencies===
The International Rescue Committee (IRC) is responsible for health services in the camp, the Lutheran World Federation is responsible for providing primary education, early childhood development, child protection and sustainable livelihoods programs, the National Council of Churches of Kenya provides housing, the Jesuit Refugees Services provide education, Don Bosco, an Italian NGO, runs a vocational training centre; Rädda Barnen (Swedish Save the Children) has been the lead agency responsible for providing primary and some secondary education. FilmAid Kenya (https://filmaidkenya.org) is the core communication agency in the refugee operations, though it also serves the host communities in Kakuma and other parts of Turkana West sub-county. Working collaboratively with other agencies, FilmAid Kenya provides key messages in the areas of protection, education, health, water, sanitation, hygiene, food assistance and nutrition using such media as film, radio broadcasts, radio talk shows, mobile information caravan services, participatory educative theatre and FilmAid&#x27;s Virtual Distribution Network (FVDN). ORAM (Organization for Refuge, Asylum &amp; Migration) provides support to the LGBTQIA+ community within the camp.

==Housing==
New arrivals normally receive one piece of reinforced plastic 4 by 5 meters with which to construct their shelter. The plastic, while providing an excellent waterproof layer, is not self-supporting, nor does it provide any insulation. They need long supple pieces of wood to make the frame and grass to complete the shelter walls of the hut and provide some thermal insulation. Housing is built of mud brick, wood, or cane extracted from the surrounding territories and new or scavenged canvas. The other half is thatched roof huts, tents, and mud abodes.

==Food==
Except for the tiny minority who were able to establish shops, the vast majority of the population of Kakuma is completely dependent on the food rations supplied for their survival. The World Food Programme (WFP) provides a food ration to all the refugees once a month based on the minimal dietary requirement of 2,100 calories/person/day. WFP is responsible for deciding the amount of food to be distributed and for providing it in the form of staples. In 2011, the WFP provided food to 98.3% of the registered refugees, averaging 2,076 calories/person/day.

The main problem with the food rations is that they do not necessarily provide the elements necessary for a basic diet. Furthermore, it is insensitive to cultural differences and household needs, leading to refugees considering food assistance as degrading – where they are expected to be grateful for inappropriate provisions. Moreover, when, as is frequent, WFP is unable to provide all of these staples, the calories are distributed through whatever commodity is available. There have been times when all of the 1900 calories (i.e. before it was increased to 2,100) were supplied in maize flour. In 1997, refugees had not received any beans or lentils for eight weeks, their only potential source of protein.

When the maize is too dry it needs to be milled/ground. Fuel is needed for transporting them to the mills for grinding the corn. Cash is inevitable to pay mills to grind the maize ration into flour (for porridge). When there is a firewood shortage (i.e. very regularly) the dried beans cannot be eaten as they cannot be cooked without firewood or other fuel. Cash is needed for buying coal and firewood (since violent clashes with local Turkana people nobody dares to collect firewood themselves). Through its agreement with WFP, UNHCR has accepted responsibility for providing additional foods which will supply the micro-nutrients. A large-scale micronutrient powder program targeting the entire population of the camp was initiated in February 2009 for 17 months.

WFP expects that refugees will trades some food received. A thriving ration resale market operated directly in front of one of the main food distribution centres. More often tolerated than not, ration resale periodically became the subject of active policing, including police sweeps that forced ration sellers to clear the area, particularly when these practices become too blatant and visible. Since the Turkana people do not have any food, they do odd jobs and buy maize and beans from refugees.

Since 2015, the WFP has introduced digital cash transfers, i.e. sends 100 KShi in cash per person/ month through a mobile phone to replace part of the food rations (10% of staple cereal like maize, wheat flour, or sorghum). The cash can only be redeemed for food. This gives refugees more freedom to decide what they will eat and is also good for the local economy.

==Security==

There is a Kenyan police station located just outside the entrance of the camp. Kenyan police do not typically operate in the camp after dusk. Kenyan police sweep the major roads at dusk, requiring all non-refugees that they encounter to leave the camp. Within the camp, LWF has responsibility for security. LWF employ a number of Kenyans, mainly ex-military personnel who patrol the camp and all issues relating to security have to be reported to them. There is a 120-member force of local guards, drawn from both the refugee and local populations. &#x27;Police stations&#x27; which are staffed around the clock and which provide a base for night-time patrols have been constructed. Refugee residents have their own guards and patrols after nightfall and in many of the residential groups, guards carry machetes and makeshift bows on their patrols. There is a Protection Area within the camp, which is a fenced enclosure accommodating around 120 families. It is intended as a temporary solution when a refugee&#x27;s safety cannot be ensured in the camp, so almost no services are provided. As a result of several Turkana thefts and intrusions into domestic spaces inside the camp there is increased fencing especially along the edges of each residential group.

* In 2014 at least fourteen people have been killed in fighting between South Sudanese refugees: officials say the fighting, following the alleged rape of a young girl, has divided Dinka and Nuer residents against each other.
* There were collective punishments after enclosures built for distributing rations and counting refugees were destroyed by unidentified refugees (1994 and 1996). Because of that food distribution was cut off for 21 days and 14 days, respectively and the &#x27;incentives&#x27; paid to employed refugees were withdrawn. After these tensions some refugee leaders were invited to a meeting with UNHCR representatives in the next bigger town (Lodwar). They attended believing it would provide an opportunity to sort out the misunderstandings between the refugees and the agencies. However these leaders were arrested, charged with incitement, destruction of property and theft of building materials. They spend two months in prison and the following court hearings had to be paid by the refugee community. They were acquitted for this charge but could not get compensation for being in prison because of UNHCRs jurisdictional immunity.

==Justice==
In theory, Kenyan law applies to Kakuma camp. In practice, this seldom happens. It is not usual for the Kenyan police to intervene in camp security without having been specifically asked to do so by UNHCR. Refugees have been allowed to establish their own &#x27;court&#x27; system which is funded by LWF. Community leaders preside over these courts and are allowed to pocket the fines they impose. Apart from fines there are punishments, including flogging and detention. Dinka community members (from South Sudan) tend to get stronger punishments. Refugees are left without legal remedies against abuses as they cannot appeal against their own courts.

==Education==
The education coverage is: pre-primary 25%, primary education 65%, secondary education 2%. In 2014 there were: 7 pre-schools, 21 primary schools, 4 secondary schools (2 high schools and 2 technical colleges, where the Kenyan curriculum and Arabic courses are taught), numerous vocational training and other courses.

Cultural/traditional practices do not favour girl&#x27;s education. Girls only represent 20% of pupils in primary and secondary schools, due to the prevalence of forced and early marriages. Some parents deny their daughters schooling due to fears they could learn about family planning, contraception and critical thinking skills. However, the girls themselves are partial to education, as they see it as a means to free themselves from familial oppression. There is a rule requiring boys and girls to eat together at school, which has encouraged the coeducational idea, in sharp contrast to traditional practice, particularly for the Sudanese.

There are boarding schools dedicated solely to give girls a space to focus on learning. Angelina Jolie Girls Primary School, is an example of one, located far from the residences, which has helped reduce the number of girls dropping out due to pregnancy. Another example is Morneau Shepell High School, which was built in 2013, created to give girls the ability to solely focus on education. Depending on their performance, they are offered a chance to study at the University of Toronto after they graduate. These two schools show the support for girls education from all around the world.

Congestion in schools, dilapidated and underresourced facilities, and a lack of trained teachers. Some pupils have to walk up to 10 kilometres to school (one way). In 2003, the Kakuma Distance Learning Centre offered 29 students the possibility to take academic courses with the University of South Africa.
As a form of entrepreneurship, refugees started schools and training centres for language and vocational skills, sometimes with Kenyan teachers or volunteers from the camp. The Instant Network Schools eLearning project was launched in a secondary school and a community library in 2015, which is a mobile solution that allows for interactive classes using mobile educational content.

==Health==
There is a 90-bed main hospital with the possibility and practice of referral to other hospitals in Kenya, five satellite clinics with a total capacity of 520. In 1997, a community mental health service was established by IRC and UNHCR: slightly less than 1% of the camp population used it between 1997 and 1999. Data from a 2004 study reports that 38.6% of patients were diagnosed with PTSD. 22.7% were diagnosed with anxiety, 12.3% were diagnosed with psychosis, 10.6% with depression, and 6.9% with epilepsy.

In 2021 the first paediatric operating theatre was installed. It was said to be the first in any refugee camp anywhere. The theatre was organised by a Scottish organisation called KidsOR and the theatre has a capacity for 1,000 operations each year. 3,000 items were required to create it and a paedatric surgeon, Dr Neema Kaseje, trained the team who operate it.

==Work and income==
Restrictions on employment deter refugee jobseeking. However, all NGOs in the camp &#x27;employ&#x27; refugees, but due to Kenyan laws prohibiting employment of refugees, they are engaged on a voluntary basis and paid an &quot;incentive&quot;, which is far lower than a wage would be for a Kenyan or international in an equivalent position.

Refugees who work for aid agencies are paid around $20–40 per month. The salaries of the local Kenyan or the international staff are 10 to 100 times higher (for the same jobs). For example, a refugee teacher was paid an &#x27;incentive&#x27; of 3,000 KSh in contrast to Kenyan teachers who earned 12,000 KSh. $66,000 is paid to refugees per month in salaries and wages from employment in the humanitarian and commercial sectors. This practice is justified on the grounds that to pay refugees on par with others would require them to have a work permit issued by the Kenyan authorities.

Incentive staff represents only a small fraction of the refugee population. The work opportunities available from the UNHCR, the WFP or partner agencies usually consist of jobs involving physical labour (construction and security) or low-level clerical work, including bookkeeping and nursing. Incentives are vital to the survival of the population – they ensure that some money is injected into the camp economy.
For many refugees, the attraction of these jobs is the enhanced and sustainable access to goods and services through proximity to the commercial and relief actors, rather than the immediate cash benefit. Jobs in the commercial sector pay marginally better wages, ranging from $100–200 per month. It is possible for refugees to start small businesses, if the capital is available. Local businessmen have to obtain a trading licence costing 1,970 KSh per year.

CARE International began running a credit facility which has since provided cash and materials to a wide range of income generating activities. The international remittances received by refugees total between $100,000 and $150,000 every month. Together with national remittances more than $200,000 flows into Kakuma every month. 20% of families receive remittances of on average $50 per month. 70 to 80% of the refugee population have access to cash through local employment and business activities (both estimated at $66,000), or remittances (estimated at $200,000 monthly). This group tends to sell up to 90% of their relief packages. They retain only a few items such as wheat flour, cooking oil, soap, and some of the lentils such as green grams. 20 to 30% of the population do not have any income and get money only through selling up to 50% of relief packages into the black market (estimated at $89,000). For selling 100% of the relief package an individual recipient might receive between 600-1200 KSh per month. The traders of the aid rations pay around $89,000 per month to the refugees for their overall sold rations. Depending on family size, refugees selling their relief rations realize between 600 KSh and 4,000 KSh a month, cash that is used to buy goods from the camp stores.

==Economy==
The Kakuma camp hosts more than 500 retail and wholesale shops. It has various markets, mostly organized according to ethnicity, where a wide variety of products are on sale, such as fresh and canned food items, vegetables, meat, clothing, household items, hardware, medicine, cosmetics, building equipment, electrical equipment, such as radios and telephones, and bicycles. 

There is a service sector with restaurants, coffee and tea shops, bars, pool halls, laundries and businesses offering telephone, banking, electronic repairs and maintenance, education, computing and internet services. The main market has more than 120 stalls, with video clubs, hardware stores, a post office which relays Kenyan mail, and so-called &#x27;hotels&#x27; which are coffee shops where locally brewed beer is served. 

At the market in Kakuma town (outside the camp), refugees come to sell their food rations at very low prices. Some traders specialize in buying up food rations from the refugees in small quantities and selling it in large quantities to merchants outside the camp. Most of the local retailers have been ruined by the competition with refugees. Goods sold in the camp are very cheap because refugees do not pay tax, rent, food, health care or education for their children. Still, taking formal and informal economy together the monthly turnover in the camp is $300,000 to $400,000. Taxation in the camp would yield more than two million Kenyan Shillings. However, the market is finite, since Kakuma is in a very isolated area.

==Threatened closure in 2016==
In 2016, the Kenyan government announced it would close Kakuma as well as the refugee camp at Dadaab. The government said it had already disbanded its Department of Refugee Affairs as part of the move. Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Interior Karanja Kibicho declared, &quot;Due to Kenya&#x27;s national security interest, the government has decided that hosting of refugees has to come to an end. The government acknowledges that this decision will have adverse effects on the lives of refugees but Kenya will no longer be hosting them&quot;. The camp was still in existence in 2022.

<doc id="1014947" wikidata="Q7425900" url="?curid=1014947" title="Satan Takes a Holiday">
<text>Satan Takes a Holiday is an album by Anton Szandor LaVey, a celebrity figure best known for his creation of the Church of Satan (CoS) inside of the United States, which was released through Amarillo Records in 1995. In addition to founding LaVeyan Satanism as a belief system, he had a long career as a showman and particularly as a musician, which the album&#x27;s various tracks captured.

The album is an eclectic work of underground music featuring a diverse mix of musical styles as well as lyrical topics, with its songs being primarily based on LaVey&#x27;s personal interest in the synthesizer. Unlike the public image often associated with his words and actions, and the surrounding controversy, the album has received positive reviews from publications such as AllMusic and is known for its often comedic approach, emphasizing straightforward entertainment. Scholar James R. Lewis of the book &quot;Satanism Today: An Encyclopedia of Religion, Folklore, and Popular Culture&quot; has asserted that &quot;LaVey&#x27;s musicianship is preserved&quot; in both the album and a previous release from 1994 in songs that &quot;are impressive&quot;, particularly given LaVey&#x27;s abilities in musical engineering.

It&#x27;s title is a reference to the notorious Tommy Dorsey &amp; His Orchestra release of the same name alongside multiple previous forms of popular media known as &quot;_____ Takes a Holiday&quot;. These include the drama movies &quot;Death Takes a Holiday&quot; and &quot;Sin Takes a Holiday&quot; among other things.

==Background and release==
In addition to founding LaVeyan Satanism as a belief system, LaVey had a long career as a showman and particularly as a musician, which the album had captured. In contrast to the dramatic and serious public image often associated with LaVey and his doctrines, with his words and actions drawing controversy, the album is a frequently comedic release intended for straightforward entertainment purposes featuring popular music styles of a &quot;lighthearted&quot; nature, including lyrics with romantic appeals and merry-go-round type carnival backgrounds. It additionally features materials from a diverse array of songwriters, including media created in the 19th Century. A praising review by music journalist Greg Prato of AllMusic remarked that &quot;[b]efore listening to this album, one must cast aside all preconceptions of... LaVey&quot;. Prato regarded LaVey&#x27;s diverse take in both musical genres and instrumental skills as &quot;comforting&quot; to the listener, in the context of the whole album&#x27;s &quot;spooky&quot; nature.

In depth, &quot;Satan Takes a Holiday&quot; is an eclectic body of songs that LaVey primarily constructed using his personal synthesizer. A few of these tracks are standards, being associated with famous media of years prior, and their composers well known. Nevertheless, LaVey chose all of these songs to create deliberate modes of feeling in terms of emotional tone. His original treatments of many of these releases, and others similar to them in context and style, were performed on a variety of organs that he mastered over the course of his life. Throughout his various experiences, LaVey performed many such songs in burlesque houses, circuses, carnivals, and roadhouses as an entertainer, with his career&#x27;s twists and turns not necessarily being associated with the CoS in any sense. The album&#x27;s very title shows this in the context of the positive term &quot;holiday&quot;.

LaVey is joined on this recording by Blanche Barton, another celebrity who&#x27;s otherwise best known for serving as the &quot;High Priestess&quot; of the CoS. Nick Bougas additionally takes part. He&#x27;s otherwise best known for being the director of LaVey&#x27;s film biography titled &quot;Speak of the Devil: The Canon of Anton LaVey&quot;, having also worked in other movie projects over the years.

It&#x27;s title is a reference to the notorious Tommy Dorsey &amp; His Orchestra release of the same name alongside multiple previous forms of popular media known as &quot;_____ Takes a Holiday&quot;. These include the drama movies &quot;Death Takes a Holiday&quot; and &quot;Sin Takes a Holiday&quot; among other things.

Looking back in retrospect, scholar James R. Lewis of the book &quot;Satanism Today: An Encyclopedia of Religion, Folklore, and Popular Culture&quot; has asserted that &quot;LaVey&#x27;s musicianship is preserved&quot; in both the album and a previous release from 1994 in songs that &quot;are impressive&quot;, particularly given LaVey&#x27;s abilities in musical engineering. Still looking back retrospectively, Amarillo Records released &quot;Satan Takes a Holiday&quot; in 1995, in the context of LaVey&#x27;s campaigns during the 1990s. The independent record label has been known for its association with other eccentric artists (especially in the burgeoning San Francisco music scene of the 1990s) and was created by actor and comedian Gregg Turkington, who ironically had absolutely no connection to Amarillo, Texas whatsoever and abandoned the company while also emigrating out of the United States altogether.

<text>The Royal Dublin Society (RDS) () is an Irish philanthropic organisation and members club which was founded as the &#x27;Dublin Society&#x27; on 25 June 1731 with the aim to see Ireland thrive culturally and economically. It was long active as a learned society, especially in agriculture, and played a major role in the development of Ireland’s national library and museums.

The RDS is synonymous with its 160,000 m2 campus in Ballsbridge, Dublin, Ireland. The premises include the &#x27;RDS Arena&#x27;, &#x27;RDS Simmonscourt&#x27;, &#x27;RDS Main Hall&#x27; and other venues which are used regularly for exhibitions, concerts and sporting events like the Dublin Horse Show or Leinster Rugby games. The Royal Dublin Society was granted royal patronage in 1820 by George IV. The RDS Members&#x27; Club is a members-only club offering exclusive access to sports events on its premises and weekly luncheons and dinners.

The RDS is one of nine organisations that may nominate candidates for the Seanad Éireann (Irish upper house of parliament) elections on the Agriculture panel.

== Name and history ==

The society was founded by members of the Dublin Philosophical Society, chiefly Thomas Prior, as the &#x27;Dublin Society for improving Husbandry, Manufactures and other Useful Arts&#x27;. On 1 July 1731 – at the second meeting of the Society – the designation &#x27;and Sciences&#x27; was added to the end of its name. The Society&#x27;s broad agenda was to stimulate economic activity and aid the creation of employment in Ireland. For the first few years of its existence, the Dublin Society concentrated on tillage technology, land reclamation, forestry, the production of dyestuffs, flax cultivation and other agricultural areas.

In 1738, following the publication of his pamphlet entitled &#x27;Reflections and Resolutions Proper for the Gentlemen of Ireland&#x27;, Samuel Madden initiated a grant or &#x27;premium&#x27; scheme to create incentives for improvements in Irish agricultural and arts. He proposed a fund of £500 be raised for this and he personally contributed £130. By 1740 the premium scheme had raised £900, and was adjudicated upon the following January and awarded to enterprises in earthenware, cotton, leatherwork, flax, surveying, as well as a number of painters and sculptors.

In 1761 the Irish Parliament voted for £12,000 to be given to the Dublin Society for the promotion of agriculture, forestry, arts, and manufactures. This funding was used to increase the amount of premiums distributed by the Dublin Society. Further funds were given by Parliament to the Dublin Society on a sporadic basis until 1784 when an annual parliamentary vote of £5,000 was put in place and remained so until the dissolution of Grattan&#x27;s Parliament in 1800.

The &quot;Royal&quot; prefix was adopted in 1820 when George IV became society patron. Despite Irish Independence from the United Kingdom in 1922 the RDS is one of several organisations based in Ireland that retain their royal patronage.

As of 2019, the RDS reportedly had 3,500 members.

== Arts ==

On foot of the successful award of premiums to artists and the public interest in this area, the RDS decided to establish an arts school. Through successful petitioning of the then Lord Lieutenant, Lord Chesterfield, it applied for government support and was awarded an annual grant of £500 in 1746. The drawing school was established in 1750 and had an early emphasis on figure drawing, landscape and ornament, with architectural drawing added in the 1760s. Tuition was free and popular among people of a wide variety of trades and backgrounds. A notable student was James Hoban, who attended in the 1780s and went on to design the White House, in Washington DC. Among the artists who attended the RDS schools of art or were awarded premiums by the Society were: James Barry, George Barrett, Francis Danby, Edward Smyth, John Hogan.

In 1867 as part of a wider initiative, the government took control of the RDS art school, which subsequently became the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art, and later became the National College of Art and Design.

The annual RDS Visual Art Awards incorporate the RDS Taylor Art Award which has been awarded since 1878. This award is now valued at €10,000 and is open to Irish visual art graduates. The total prize fund for the RDS Visual Art Awards is €30,000.

Former notable winners of the RDS Taylor Art Award include: Walter Osborne, William Orpen, Seán Keating, Mainie Jellet, Colin Midleton, Nora McGuinness and Louis le Brocquy, as well as more contemporary artists such as Eamon O&#x27;Kane, Dorothy Cross James Hanley and Conor Walton.

== Music ==
The RDS association with classical music extends back to 1886 when it first organised a series of popular recitals that took place over a phased basis from March, and it included works by Corelli, Haydn and Beethoven performed by teaching staff of the Royal Irish Academy of Music.

In subsequent years a number of RDS recitals were recorded by RTÉ for broadcast. The RDS chamber recitals continued into 1980s and 1990s, hosting artists such as András Schiff, Jessye Norman, Isaac Stern and Nigel Kennedy. The last RDS chamber recital was held in October 2002 and featured Irish pianist Hugh Tinney.

The RDS became the main venue for Feis Ceoil in 1983 onward. In 2003 offered its first RDS Music Bursary of €10,000 to one of the winners of selected Feis Ceoil senior competitions. The RDS Music Bursary currently offers two prizes, one of €15,000 and the RDS Jago Award of €5,000. Both prizes also offer performance engagements. An additional prize, the RDS Collins Memorial Performance Award is given to a former Music Bursary winner each year, offering them a professional performance opportunity with Blackwater Valley Opera Festival.

== Agriculture ==
Agriculture has been a persistent theme of endeavour since the foundation of the Dublin Society. In its first eighteen months, the Society reprinted or published up-to-date material on the latest agricultural innovations, such as Jethro Tull&#x27;s book on Tillage, a paper &#x27;on improvement of flax by changing the soil&#x27; and &#x27;a new method of draining marshy and boggy lands&#x27;. The Society followed this in the year to come with further publications on grass cultivation, saffron planting, drainage, management of hops, bee management, wool production and tillage. They also held demonstrations on how to use newly designed farm machinery.

Forestry was encouraged from an equally early stage with records of the Society showing that premiums were increasingly awarded for afforestation from 1742 onwards. Between 1766 and 1806 over 55 million trees were planted in Ireland on foot of the Society&#x27;s initiatives.

The genesis of Dublin&#x27;s Botanic Gardens can be found in the minute books of the Dublin Society as far back as 1732. From this time onwards, the Dublin Society sporadically leased land around the city to conduct agricultural and botanic experiments and initiatives. In 1790, enabled by funding from the Irish Parliament, the Society leased land in Glasnevin with the intent of making the lands ready for delivering public education on botany. It appointed a professor of Botany to oversee the gardens along with an experienced head gardener from Scotland. With the completion of offices and greenhouses in 1799, the Botanic Gardens, Dublin were opened in 1800 and remained in the care of the Society until 1877 when they were transferred over to the State.

In 1845 the early signs of potato blight that would go on to have a devastating effect on Ireland were detected by the RDS in the Botanic Gardens. The Society offered a prize of £20 for the best research on the poorly understood disease. Utilising knowledge of both agriculture and science, the Society directed its own scientists to find remedies, but despite many trials and experiments both in the Botanic Gardens and in the Society&#x27;s laboratory in Leinster House, they were unable to find one.

The first Spring Show was held in April 1831 on the grounds of Leinster House, Kildare Street, the purpose of which was to encourage best breeding practices in livestock by showcasing the best in the country. By 1848 the judges of the Show were satisfied that English breeders would soon be purchasing Irish stock such was the quality of cattle breeding on display. Their confidence was validated in 1856 at the Paris International Cattle Show where Irish shorthorn cattle took more prizes in proportion to livestock displayed, than their English and Scottish counterparts combined. The Spring Show moved to the RDS grounds of Ballsbridge in 1881 and continued it there until the last Spring Show took place in 1992.

The association with agriculture persists to today and it forms an important part of the Society&#x27;s philanthropic mission. The RDS Forestry and Woodland Awards have been awarded annually since 1988 and in 2017 had a prize fund of €15,000 which is spread across four different categories. In 2016 the RDS, in conjunction with the IIEA, outlined the framework of a &#x27;Climate Smart Agriculture&#x27; plan for Ireland. The Society continues to award annual prizes for the best cattle in Ireland, including the Economic Breeding Index (EBI) dairy cow. In 2021 the RDS was the host of the National Dialogues on Ireland&#x27;s Food System, part of Ireland&#x27;s engagement with the United Nations Food Systems Summit 2021.

== Science ==
In the early period of the Society, science was innately linked to agriculture and industry. A link that continued well into the nineteenth century; for instance, the Botanic Gardens had cross-over appeal to both science and agriculture, as did the public lectures in veterinary science. But science began to also carve out its own separate area of interests towards the latter end of the eighteenth century with professorships in chemistry and physics funded by the Society in the 1790s, the employment of an itinerant geologist who toured Ireland collecting specimens for the Society, and the purchase of the Leskean Cabinet of minerals in 1792.

The Dublin Society began holding science lectures covering an array of topics in 1797, with lectures on physics and chemistry made open to the public in 1824. In 1810 a large laboratory and lecture room were built in Hawkins House and a similar facility was constructed in Leinster House when the Society moved there, allowing the public lectures on science to continue (in what is now the Dáil Chamber in the Houses of the Oireachtas). In 1835 the RDS co-hosted the British Association for the Advancement of Science, which it also did again in 1957, and from 1838 commenced sponsoring science lectures outside of Dublin.

In 1903 the Society imported radium into Ireland for the first time and through experimental methods, devised by RDS Members John Joly and Walter Stevenson, one of the earliest forms of cancer treatment was created to much international acclaim. It subsequently became known as the &#x27;Dublin method&#x27;. In 1914 the Society established the Irish Radium Institute to supply radon to Irish hospitals, a function it carried out until the Irish Radiological Institute was established in 1952.

In 1961 the RDS held its first exhibition on atomic energy which was followed up in 1963 and 1966, garnering audiences of over 30,000. The Young Scientists and Technology Exhibition was started at this time by physicists Tom Burke and Tony Scott, the latter being a member of the RDS Science Committee. The Exhibition has been held in the RDS since 1966.

Today, the RDS continues to promote science in Ireland through the awarding of the Boyle Medal on a biennial basis, alternating between a scientist based in Ireland and an Irish scientist based abroad, with a prize of €20,000. The Boyle Medal has been awarded since 1899 and is Ireland&#x27;s most prestigious scientific honour.

The RDS Primary Science Fair encouraged primary school classes to explore science hypotheses and from 2017 operated in three cities around Ireland, with over 7,000 participating children across all three venues. The RDS Primary Science Fair was cited as a positive example of informal science education by the Government commissioned &#x27;STEM Education in the Irish School System&#x27;. In 2019 the RDS developed Science Blast and ESB came on board as title sponsors. Science Blast is managed and delivered by the RDS. In its first year it had over 10,000 primary school pupils engaged with STEM.

RDS STEM Learning is a continuous professional development programme for primary school teachers to gain confidence in teaching science in the classroom.

== Headquarters and venues ==

===Grafton Street===
The society constructed a house on Grafton Street as its first headquarters around 1766-67 and met for the first time there on the 3rd of December 1767. Adjacent to Navigation House, the office of the Commissioners for improving Inland Navigation and which later became the headquarters of the Royal Irish Academy. It is likely the building was designed by Christopher Myers although Thomas Ivory was involved in designing part of a museum space.

The schools of drawing were located at the rear of the buildings and were also designed by Myers.

The last meeting of the society at Grafton Street was held on the 4th of August 1796 and the building was then sold for £3,000.

===Hawkins Street===
A large dedicated headquarters for the society was developed at Hawkins Street close to the River Liffey in 1796.

In 1820, the building was demolished and replaced with the Theatre Royal.

===Leinster House===
The society purchased Leinster House, home of the Duke of Leinster, in 1815 and founded a natural history museum there.

==Ballsbridge==
The society acquired its current premises at Ballsbridge in 1879, and has since increased from the original fifteen to forty acres (60,000 to 160,000 m2). The premises consist of a number of exhibition halls (at the &quot;RDS Main Hall&quot;), a multi-purpose sports stadium (the &quot;RDS Arena&quot;), meeting rooms, bars, restaurants, and a multi-purpose indoor venue named &quot;RDS Simmonscourt Pavilion&quot;.

=== RDS Main Hall ===
The RDS Main Hall is a major centre for exhibitions, concerts and other cultural events in Dublin. It hosts, for example, the Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition each January.

=== RDS Simmonscourt ===

The multi-purpose RDS Simmonscourt (also known as RDS Simmonscourt Pavilion or Simmonscourt Main Hall) has a capacity of approximately 7,000 (6,500 theatre style) and is the largest hall in the complex.

It has hosted the Meteor Music Awards in 2008, 2009 and 2010, touring ice show Disney on Ice, as well as a number of concerts including Thin Lizzy in 1982 and 1983, Neil Young, Queen, AC/DC, The Smashing Pumpkins and My Chemical Romance, and the Eurovision Song Contest in 1981 and 1988. Simmonscourt is where the show jumping horses are stabled during Dublin Horse Show week.




=== RDS Arena ===
The RDS Arena (more commonly known simply as the RDS) was developed to host equestrian events, including the annual Dublin Horse Show. It is often used for other sporting events, however – primarily football and rugby. Between September 1990 and April 1996 it was used for home games of Shamrock Rovers football club, on 19 February 1992 it played host to a home game between the Republic of Ireland national football team and Wales, and hosted the 2007 and 2008 FAI Cup finals.

In 2007 and 2008 the arena&#x27;s capacity was expanded to 18,250 (with additional seated stands being built), and the venue is now used by the Leinster Rugby team for home games. The club also moved their Leinster Rugby Store to the RDS (between the two parade rings), and it is open on match days.

The covered Anglesea Stand is the oldest stand in the ground below which there is a small amount of terracing. Opposite the Anglesea Stand is the Grandstand which contains the TV gantry and was covered with a roof in 2008. Behind the goals are the uncovered North and South stands which are removed for show jumping events to allow for extra space.

The DART runs close to the RDS premises with Lansdowne and Sandymount being the closest stops. The RDS is served by bus route numbers 4, 7, 18 and 27x, which stop outside the Main Hall Entrance to the RDS on Merrion Road.

== Events ==
=== Dublin Horse Show ===

The first Dublin Horse Show took place in 1864 and was operated in conjunction with the Royal Agricultural Society of Ireland. The first solely Society-run Horse Show was held in 1868 and was one of the earliest &quot;leaping&quot; competitions ever held. Over time it has become a high-profile International show jumping competition, national showing competition and major entertainment event in Ireland. In 1982 the RDS hosted the Show Jumping World Championships and incorporated it into the Dublin Horse Show of that year. The Dublin Horse Show has over 130 classes and they can be generally categorised into the following types of equestrian competitions: showing classes, performance classes and show jumping classes.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, on 20 April 2020, the RDS announced that the Dublin Horse Show—scheduled for 15–19 July—was cancelled, the first time this had occurred since 1940.

===Concerts===
In recent years, the venue has been used as a music venue, for many rock, heavy metal and pop artists.

Bruce Springsteen has played there eleven times since 1988: The Tunnel of Love Express Tour (1988), The Other Band Tour (1993), The Reunion Tour (1999), The Rising Tour (2003), The Magic Tour (2008), three times for The Working on a Dream Tour (2009), and twice for The Wrecking Ball Tour (2012). He played for 40,000 people during The Rising Tour in May 2003, 115,500 people at the arena during his Magic Tour in May 2008, and 80,000+ people during his Working on a Dream Tour.

In June 2008, American band Paramore played their debut Irish concert in the RDS Arena.

Other notable performers who have played in the main arena include: Iron Maiden, Bon Jovi, Kanye West, Michael Jackson, Tina Turner, Kylie Minogue, Radiohead, Shania Twain, The Cure and Metallica among others. U2 played 2 dates of their &quot;Zooropa&quot; tour on 27 and 28 August 1993 in the main Arena.

On 30 April 1988, the Eurovision Song Contest took place in the Simmonscourt Main Hall and was won by Celine Dion. Seven years earlier, on 4 April 1981, the venue also hosted the contest with British pop group Bucks Fizz being the eventual winners.

=== Professional wrestling ===
In 2005, the RDS hosted a WWE SmackDown event as part of the WWE Summerbash tour of Europe. The event featured wrestlers such as Stone Cold Steve Austin, John Cena, Kurt Angle, and Rey Mysterio.

=== Rugby Union ===
The RDS is the home of Leinster Rugby. The RDS hosts Leinster&#x27;s home matches in the Pro14 and the Heineken Cup as well as some pre-season games. In March 2008, the final of the Leinster Schools Senior Cup was played in the RDS due to the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road, its traditional venue. An autumn international between Ireland and Fiji was played 21 November 2009.

=== Association Football ===
Shamrock Rovers F.C. played their home matches at the RDS stadium between 1990 and 1996, including against Górnik Zabrze in the 1994–95 UEFA Cup. The stadium hosted an international between the Republic of Ireland and Wales in February 1992; the 1994 UEFA Under-16 Championships; the FAI Cup Final in 2007 and 2008; and the 2008–09 UEFA Cup match between St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic and Hertha Berlin. St. Pat&#x27;s also played Steaua București in the Arena on 27 August 2009 in the Play-off round of the opening season of the Europa League. The Republic of Ireland played two international friendly fixtures on 25 and 28 May 2010 against Paraguay and Algeria.

=== Other ===
In 1983, the Ireland team played in the World Group of the Davis Cup for the only time. The match against a United States team including John McEnroe was played in the RDS rather than the usual venue, Fitzwilliam, to accommodate crowds of 6,000 each day.

In 1986, the RDS was transformed into a very large ballet venue for three days of performances by the Bolshoi Ballet.

In April 2023, the Irish Poker Open was held at RDS.

=== Exams ===
The RDS hosts the University College Dublin exams before Christmas and in May/June, and Trinity College Dublin exams in April, among others.

<doc id="1014962" wikidata="Q2482321" url="?curid=1014962" title="Type 91 torpedo">
<text>The Type 91 was an aerial torpedo of the Imperial Japanese Navy. It was in service from 1931 to 1945. It was used in naval battles in World War II and was specially developed for attacks on ships in shallow harbours.

The Type 91 aerial torpedo had two unique characteristics. Firstly, it used wooden stabilizers attached to the tail fins which were shed upon water entry. Secondly, it engaged an angular acceleration control system to control rolling movements, which was very advanced for its time. This system made it possible to release the Type 91 not only at a cruising speed of at an altitude of , but also in a power-glide torpedo-bombing run at the maximum speed of the Nakajima B5N &#x27;Kate&#x27;, 

The Type 91 torpedo was an diameter torpedo, similar in size to other nations. There were five models put into service, with high-explosive warheads weighing from with effective ranges from at .

Since the Type 91 torpedo was the only practical aerial torpedo of the Imperial Japanese Navy, it was simply known as the &quot;Koku Gyorai&quot; or &quot;aerial torpedo&quot;. Surface warships and submarines used other types of torpedoes, namely the Type 93 and Type 95 respectively, while the Type 97 torpedo was designed for use by midget submarines.

==Specifications==
The torpedo measured in length, with a diameter of , and weighed , with an explosive charge of . It had a range of and a speed of . A slightly-modified variant was used to sink HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and HMS &quot;Repulse&quot;, launched from Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot; bombers in an action in the South China Sea three days after Pearl Harbor on 10 December 1941.

=== Initial development ===
Rear Admiral Seiji Naruse led the team in charge of the initial development of the Type91 aerial torpedo at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. The team was known as the &quot;Ninety One Association&quot; and included Lt Cmdr Haruo Hirota, Lt Cmdr Makoto Kodaira (Matsunawa), Naval Assistant Manager Iyeta, Naval Engineer Noma, Naval Engineer Moritoshi Maeda, Lieutenant Hidehiko Ichikawa, and Teruyuki Kawada, a university student who was a naval apprentice.

Captain Fumio Aiko was in charge of further development of the torpedo from 1931. Captain Aiko managed the team as it developed an effective aerial torpedo and anti-rolling controller. He considered the Type91 aerial torpedo to be his great achievement.

===Delayed development===
At the beginning of 1934, &quot;Kan-Pon&quot; or the Imperial Japanese Navy Technical Department, an operating division of the Ministry of the Navy of the Imperial Japanese government, which had the primary responsibility for naval weapon systems, had their own plan for a Japanese aerial torpedo. In their concept, a big flying boat was to carry a variant of the heavy Type93 &quot;oxygen torpedoes&quot; to launch at long range, and then turn back towards safety. This eventually proved to be an unrealistic desk plan. &quot;Kan-Pon&quot; confidentially developed their own Type94 torpedo and even ordered a halt to production of the Type 91. This significantly delayed the development schedule of the Type91 and frustrated the project members.

=== Wooden tail stabilizers added ===
The project team developed Kyoban wooden aerodynamic stabilizer plates for the Type91&#x27;s tail fins as &quot;revision1&quot; in 1936. These stabilized the torpedo in flight to ensure the proper angle for water entry and were designed to shear off on entry to the water, preventing the torpedo from diving too deep. The team demonstrated their effectiveness in tests at altitudes of both the following year.

The original Type91 was considered to have a frail body, and so this was strengthened in a new model in 1938 known as &quot;revision2&quot;.

=== Anti-rolling controller developed ===
Type 91 aerial torpedoes won admiration for their effective anti-rolling controller and acceleration control system. Before the anti-rolling controller was introduced, the early versions of the Type91 had serious problems, as did all other aerial torpedoes of the time. When released at high speed, it had a tendency to make a double-roll in the air. When released into heavy seas, a spin could be imparted by the hard impact on water entry. Other issues included: the running direction veering on water impact; not running horizontally after water entry, but continuing vertically to either stick in the bottom of shallow water or be crushed by the water pressure (at a depth of 100m or so); jumping back out of the water; skipping along the water surface; or even running backwards. Only very experienced aviators could be sure of a clean torpedo bombing run, and then only when operating over a calm sea. A tumbling torpedo will run out of control once it hits the water. The gyrocompass and the depth meter may work well, but the torpedo cannot control the running direction by tail rudders unless they are initially in the neutral position. Once the torpedo rolls, the horizontal and vertical rudders lose their positions, resulting in a runaway.

The specification for the launch speed of aircraft was increased from with the expectation that it would be increased again. The engineers and scientists of the Type 91 project concluded that any aerial torpedo needed an anti-rolling system with not only a damping stabilizer function but also an acceleration controlling function. Without these features any torpedo would be highly likely to fall into an unstable state. The idea of acceleration-control, or &quot;counter-steering&quot;, was at the time widely considered to be impossible.

A breakthrough on aerial torpedo design was made with the anti-rolling controller invented first by Iyeda, assistant manager of the arsenal workmen, in spring 1941. Ten days later, while the Iyeda system was being tested, Naval Engineer Noma invented another system. It functioned in a similar way, but with a different mechanism. During the prototype tests, Noma&#x27;s system was found to be the better, having less time lag in its responses. So the Noma system was adopted for the next production version of Type91 and it went into final testing in August 1941, making practical the use of aerial torpedoes both in rough seas and in shallow waters. It enabled the Type91rev.2 to run under water no deeper than 20 meters, with experienced pilots learning to launch their torpedo so as to sink to a depth of no more than 10 meters.

=== Increase in explosive weight ===
The anti-rolling controller also made it possible for the Type91 to carry a heavier warhead. The Type91rev.1 warhead weighed with a high explosive charge of , but the rev.2 warhead weighed with of high explosive. Warhead rev.7, which was carried by twin-engine bombers, weighed and boasted a high explosive charge of ; this was designed to pierce the reinforced armour plates of the latest US Navy ships.

==Production==
The Type 91 was researched and developed at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in Kanagawa Prefecture. It was first produced at the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works division of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Later, the Imperial Japanese Navy established two manufacturing sites: Suzuka Naval Arsenal in Mie Prefecture; and Kawatana Naval Arsenal, a branch of Sasebo Naval Arsenal, in Nagasaki Prefecture. The Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works plant at Kawatana specialized in torpedo production and was destroyed by the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki.

==Technology transfer to Germany==
Germany approached Japan requesting the transfer of Japanese aerial torpedo technology. In a &quot;yanagi&quot; mission the Imperial Japanese Navy sent the plans and a number of Type91 aerial torpedoes on Japanese submarine &quot;I-30&quot; (a large cruiser type submarine) which arrived in Lorient on August2, 1942. It was designated the &quot;Lufttorpedo LT 850&quot; in German service. The weight of the LT 850 German version was somewhat lighter at , with a length.

Germany wished to acquire the knowledge behind the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service&#x27;s aerial torpedo technology in order to more effectively attack the Allied transport ships steaming in the Mediterranean Sea. It had previously imported Italian-made aerial torpedoes, which became unavailable following the Italian Armistice of Cassibile with the Allies in September 1943. The indigenous German aerial torpedo designs were badly restricted in launch speed and launch altitude.

==Variants==
The Type 91 (modification 2), was a shallow-water aerial torpedo that was designed for and used in the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Wooden fins and a softwood breakaway nose cone were added to allow for launching into shallow water at low altitudes.

There were two versions in the Type 91 warhead rev.3, differing in designed maximum launch speeds.

Later, heavier models had a decreased range.

== Further development ==
In spring 1944, the Yokosuka air arsenal began development of the &quot;Shisei Gyorai M&quot; (trial model torpedo M), or simply the &quot;Two tonne torpedo&quot;. This was an enlarged version of the Type 91 aerial torpedo and was in diameter, long, weighing , and carrying a warhead. It would have been the largest aerial torpedo in the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force, but the operating concept became outdated and the project was never completed. However, the Type91 aerial torpedo project members did not regard it as a part of the Type91 series.

==Post-war commemoration==
Some 30 years after the war, surviving members of the development team raised money to privately publish a small book, &quot;Koku Gyorai Note&quot; or Aerial Torpedo Notebook.

Type 91 torpedoes are currently displayed at the Etajima school of Japan Maritime Self-Defense (the Maritime Self Defense Force 1stTechnical School) and Shimofusa Base. They are missing the roll rudders. An excavated Type 91aerial torpedo is preserved at the Resource Museum in JGSDF Camp Naha, 1st Combined Brigade of The Western Army, JGSDF, located in Naha city, Okinawa. It retains the original features. It was picked up as unexploded ordnance by a bomb-disposal unit of the JGSDF. A captured Type91 aerial torpedo is displayed at the US Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland. It rests on two supports flanking a pathway in a small park in front of the Academy&#x27;s Dahlgren Hall. Displayed on the other side of the pathway is a Type93 Japanese Long Lance ship-launched torpedo.

<text>Winged Migration (, also known as The Travelling Birds in some UK releases, or The Travelling Birds: An Adventure in Flight in Australia) is a 2001 documentary film directed by Jacques Cluzaud, Michel Debats and Jacques Perrin, who was also one of the writers and narrators, showcasing the immense journeys routinely made by birds during their migrations.

The film is dedicated to the French ornithologist Jean Dorst.

== Plot ==
The movie takes the viewer on a journey alongside many species of birds from the old and new world.

It begins on Europe, following the ending of winter on a riverside, where European robins, cuckoos and kingfishers feed with the plenty of spring. A flock of Greylag geese soon land and depart when a kid spooks them off; one of the geese gets tangled in a net, but the kid manages to release it and it reunites with its flock as night falls.

After a flight with the geese flock and a Mallard, the movie shifts to the view of two other birds: the Common crane, seen arriving at a farm and accidentally spooked by an old lady, and White stork, who arrives to breed on the roofs of buildings. Barnacle geese are then followed on a flight across shorelines while whooper swans soar across Asia towards Japan. The film also showcases a group of Japanese cranes dancing as a mating ritual and a flock of Bar-headed geese escaping an avalanche on the Himalayas.

On North America, in the Grand canyon, a Bald eagle sees a flock of Canada geese fly north, with the flock landing to take a rest but soon spooked by a herd of wild horse, accidentally causing one to get lost. Clark&#x27;s greebe run in the water in sychrony to court before a group of American white pelicans arrive. Sandhill cranes arrive at a lake to pass the night before making their final flight north.

On a field, some songbirds like Red-winged blackbird and Yellow-headed blackbird sing amidst a wetland while on a field, combine harvesters reap the fruits of their labor, unaware they&#x27;re close to a quail&#x27;s nest. The flock of Canada geese seen earlier fly over a farm where a farm goose tries to follow to no success.

Greater sage-grouse fight for the right to mate, while Snow geese make one final stretch to reach the Arctic Circle just in time for spring. The ice on the north thaws as glaciers begin to break. Arctic terns hunt for fish near the breaking zone while the flock of Barnacle geese turn around.

The tundra bursts with life as hatchlings of dozens of migratory species begin to hatch, from Whooper swans and Common loons, to Sandhill cranes, Snowy owls, and Snow geese, with one hatchling being chased by a Parasitic jaeger for getting too close to its nest

On the coasts of the Arctic Ocean, as summer reaches its peak, Common eiders plunge into the water while Puffins run the gauntlet of Great skuas. Guillemots, Kitiwakes and Northern gannets feed and rear their young around the clock. The good times do not last for long, however, for as autumn arrives, food becomes scarce, and birds must now fly back south.

The Barnacle geese flock fly once again through the same route they came from, soaring over a stormy sea and having to land on top of a navy ship when the weather worsens; Meanwhile, the Canada and Snow geese fly through redwoods as winter beings to close in, running the gauntlet of hunters who kill some of the flock. A flock of Red-breasted geese fly across a refinery, and one member gets stuck on some oil. The flock of Greylag geese close in on their winter grounds, but the flock is ambushed by hunters, with the goose with the tangled net remains surviving the ordeal.

The Common cranes fly south and across the same farm where they got spooked earlier, but this time, they accept the food given by the old lady. The White storks finish their migration on an oasis on the Sahara desert in Africa. Other birds alongside the coastline, like wading birds, arrive to feed. Great white pelicans fly inland to a large wetland to feed in vast numbers alongside other birds like Black heron, White-faced whistling ducks and African darters.

The movie then moves to the Amazon rainforest, where Macaws survive the daily downpurs of the jungle. A boat is then showed with animals such as Red-and-green macaw, Equatorial saki, and Toucans being kept in wooden vages; one lucky Hyacinth macaw, however, manages to escape and fly back into the wild. On the Andean mountains, Andean condor use the rocky walls to catch thermals to soar over the land in search of food.

The final stretch follows the Antarctic ocean, where on the Falkland Islands, Rockhopper penguins and Black-browed albatross come to breed every year. On other antarctic islands, King penguins assemble in large flocks to breed, reducing, not eradicating, the threat of predators, as a group of Giant petrels catch and kill one hatchling. On another corner of the island, Wandering albatross display their enormous wings to other females as their mating ritual.

The birds soon fly into the sea to feed, with a flock of King penguins heading to the sea. The Arctic terns fly back north, as the good times on the north return, while back on Europe, spring arrives to the opening riverside once again. The Eurasian robin and the kid from the beginning of the movie witness the flock of Greylag geese, along with the one with the tangled net remains, stop momentarily before continuing their flight north once again.

==Production==
The movie was shot over the course of three years on all seven continents. Filming began in July 1998 and ended in spring 2001. Most of the footage is aerial, shot using in-flight cameras from ultralights, paragliders, and hot air balloons, with additional footage captured from trucks, motorcycles, motorboats, remote-controlled robots, and a French Navy warship.

The viewer appears to be flying alongside birds of successive species, with many shots of Canada geese. They traverse every kind of weather and landscape, covering vast distances in a flight for survival. The filmmakers exposed over 590 miles of film to create an 89-minute piece. In one case, two months of filming in one location was edited down to less than one minute in the final film.

Much of the aerial footage was taken of &quot;tame&quot; birds. The filmmakers raised birds of several species, including storks and pelicans, from birth. The newborn birds imprinted on staff members, and were trained to fly along with the film crews. The birds were also exposed to the film equipment over the course of their lives to ensure that the birds would not be unsettled by it. Several of these species had never been imprinted before.

Its producer says that &quot;Winged Migration&quot; is neither a documentary nor fiction, but rather a &quot;natural tale&quot;.

The film states that no special effects were used in the filming of the birds, although some entirely CGI segments that view Earth from outer space and include animated birds augment the real-life footage.

The film&#x27;s soundtrack by Bruno Coulais was recorded by Bulgarian vocal group Bulgarka Junior Quartet in Bulgarian, as well as Nick Cave in English and Robert Wyatt. The vocal effects include sequences in which panting is superimposed on wingbeats to give the effect that the viewer is right alongside a bird.

Release date
The film was released in France on 2001/12/12, Japan 2003/04/05...(Tokyo), the USA 2003/04/5...(Philadelphia International Film Festival), and the UK on 2003/09/05

==Reception==
&quot;Winged Migration&quot; had an overall approval rating of 95% on Rotten Tomatoes as of October 2021, based on 132 reviews, and an average rating of 8.2/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;A marvel to watch&quot;. It also has a score of 82 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.
By gross ticket sales, the film still holds seventh place in nature documentaries and eighteenth in documentary overall.

==Awards and honors==
The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. It won &quot;Best Editing&quot; at the 27th César Awards, where it was also nominated for &quot;Best Music&quot; and &quot;Best Debut&quot;.

<text>Oxie () is a locality and was a city district () in the south-east of Malmö Municipality, Sweden. On 1 July 2013, the city district was merged with Fosie, forming Söder. In 2012, Oxie had a population of 12,453 of the municipality&#x27;s 307,758. The area was 2,306 hectares.

Notable buildings include the medieval Oxie church (&quot;Oxie kyrka&quot;) and the water tower. From the railway station commuter trains proceed to Malmö and Ystad.

It is dominated by residential areas of single-family detached home and semi-detached houses. Oxie centrum is the center point of the town with a small square, several stores and service providers.

==History==

The area around Oxie is rich in archaeological finds. Settlements from the Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age have been discovered. The spectacular bronze-age burial mounds &quot;Kungshögarna&quot; (Mounds of the Kings) provides a monumental sight, overlooking the highway to Malmö. These mounds, at 60 m above sea level, are also the highest natural point in Malmö municipality.

Oxie is first mentioned in written sources 1130 as Oshögha, believed to mean the mound by the spring. As the center point of the church municipality Oxie hundred, Oxie was also the seat of the hundred thing (&quot;Häradstinget&quot;), which was held every spring and autumn. Local names such as &quot;Tingbacken&quot; (Thing hill) and &quot;Tingdammen&quot; (Thing pond) indicate the location of the things. &quot;Galjebacken&quot; (Gallow Hill) is another place, bearing witness to the judicial powers of the hundred thing. Galjebacken was used for executions well into the 19th century. The oldest building in Oxie is the church, originally built in 1160. It was heavily restored in 1848 by Carl Georg Brunius, but the walls of the nave, the southern gate and the Baptismal font are all remains from the original church. There are theories that a wooden church existed at the site prior to the 1160 stone construction.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, the village expanded with the establishment of several brick and gravel industries. Remains from this era can still be seen in the topography of Oxie. Like in many other small, rural communities this rapid industrialisation was facilitated by the establishment of railroad communications.

Oxie was a municipality of its own until it merged with Malmö in 1967. Today, Oxie is made up of the previously separate villages Oxie, Käglinge, Toarp and Kristineberg. In addition, Oxie district also included the villages Lockarp, Glostorp and Krumby.

==Neighborhoods==

The neighbourhoods of the city district of Oxie were:

==Demographics==
During the later half of the 20th century, the population skyrocketed to more than 10,000 from 1,608 in 1957, as it became more attractive for families to move outside of the city. A major residential area, Oxievång, was built during the 1970s and 1980s.

During the 1990s and early 2000s, significant numbers of immigrants moved to Oxie.

The ten largest groups of foreign-born persons are:
# Denmark (858)
# Poland (220)
# Former Yugoslavia (200)
# Iraq (108)
# Hungary (95)
# Iran (91)
# Pakistan (84)
# Germany (78)
# Bosnia and Herzegovina (77)
# Finland (66)

The construction of the Øresund Bridge, combined with the high cost of living in Denmark, has led to large numbers of Danish people settling in Oxie recently. The proximity to Copenhagen and good communications make Oxie an attractive alternative for those who commute to the Danish side. In 2006, there were 451 Danish-born persons, the figure increased to 602 in 2007 and in 2009, 858 Danes lived in Oxie.

==Education==
There are nine public preschools/kindergartens as well as four schools in Oxie today. Blankebäcksskolan, Kungshögsskolan and Tingdammsskolan are primary schools, while Oxievångsskolan is a secondary school. Oxie is the location of a flower school named &quot;Ingvar Strandhs Blomsterskola&quot;. It is the leading florist school in Sweden, with students coming from as far as Japan to participate in courses.

==Sports==
The following sports clubs are located in Oxie:

* Oxie IF
* Rönnebäcks GK, a golf club

==Flower business==
In addition to hosting the florist school, Oxie is the number one flower transit point in Sweden. Several flower importing companies have facilities in Oxie, receiving shipments of flowers from all over Europe. As much as 80% of the imported cut flowers coming to Sweden pass through here.

Her father is Jewish while her mother is African-American and a Baptist. She adopted the name Tracee Ellis Ross, wishing to retain both of her parents&#x27; names after her father dropped the name Silberstein. She has a younger sister, Chudney Lane Silberstein, and an older half-sister, Rhonda Ross Kendrick. Actor and musician Evan Ross is her half-brother.

In the 80s, Tracee was photographed along with her mother, Rhonda and Chudney by Andy Warhol. Her mother used her own photo for the cover of her 1982 album, &quot;Silk Electric&quot;, for which Warhol was given credit.

When her mother married Arne Næss Jr. in 1985, Tracee gained three step-siblings: Katinka, Christoffer, and folk singer Leona Naess. She remains on close terms with all of them.

Following a speech at the American Music Awards, Internet trolls commented on her condition, leading her to post an Instagram video saying, &quot;I know y&#x27;all make fun of my eyes, you know what I mean? Well, f**ck off, &#x27;cause it&#x27;s not my fault, alright? My body does what it does, I don&#x27;t know why. But sometimes when I&#x27;m tired, this one just gives up, and it&#x27;s like, &#x27;Goodnight!&#x27;...&quot;Go ahead, make fun of my eyes, OK? But I think they&#x27;re nice, I think they&#x27;re so nice, I do.&quot;

<text>Larry Haines (born Larry Hecht; August 3, 1918 – July 17, 2008) was an American actor.

==Early years==
Haines was born on August 3, 1918, in Mount Vernon, New York. (Some sources say August 18, 1918, in the same city). He had been active in dramatics in high school, and while he was in college, he was advised to try acting. After a few months of instruction in dramatics, he passed an audition with CBS. He dropped out during his sophomore year of college and &quot;went right into radio working on little stations all around New York City,&quot; beginning at WWRL.

==Radio==
Haines first became known in the 1930s as an actor on the radio crime series &quot;Gangbusters&quot;. Playing Joe Lincoln, he was the star of &quot;Treasury Agent&quot; on the Mutual Broadcasting System in 1947–48, and he had the title role of Mike Hammer in &quot;That Hammer Guy&quot; on Mutual in 1953–54. He also was featured in &quot;The Chase&quot;, &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot;, &quot;Inner Sanctum Mystery&quot;, &quot;The Man Behind the Gun&quot;, and &quot;This Is Nora Drake&quot;. It was estimated that he acted in more than 15,000 radio programs in the 1940s and 1950s.
Four decades later, he would return to radio, starring in 82 episodes of the &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot;.

==Television==
His best known role was that of next door neighbor Stu Bergman on the soap opera &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;. Haines joined the show for its eleventh episode in 1951, and remained on the serial for the show&#x27;s duration. He won Daytime Emmy Awards in 1976 and 1981, and was First Lady Pat Nixon&#x27;s favorite soap opera actor. Haines was reunited with longtime &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; costar Mary Stuart on the prime-time special which saluted 50 years of the soaps in 1994.

In the 1980s, he co-starred with one of his &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; co-stars, Rick Lohman (who had played his grandson, Gary Walton) in a short-lived sitcom, called &quot;Phyl &amp; Mikhy&quot;. Larry played Max Wilson, the father of Phyllis Wilson Orloff (Murphy Cross), who was married to Mikhy Orloff.

In 1989, several years after the cancellation of &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, he briefly joined the cast of another NBC/Procter and Gamble serial, &quot;Another World.&quot; Haines played the role of Sid Sugarman, Ada Hobson&#x27;s old boyfriend who escorted her to a gala honoring the show&#x27;s 25th anniversary. He was later in the cast of Agnes Nixon&#x27;s &quot;Loving&quot;, playing Neal Warren, the biological father of Gwyneth Alden with whom he was reunited right before she was identified as the serial killer in the slaying of the Alden family and several other characters. In the last episodes of the show, his character proposed to old girlfriend Kate Rescott.

==Stage==
Haines&#x27; Broadway debut came in 1962, when he played in &quot;A Thousand Clowns&quot;.
He earned Tony nominations for his work in &quot;Generation&quot; (1965) and &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; (1968). His other Broadway appearances were in &quot;Last of the Red Hot Lovers&quot;, &quot;Twigs&quot;, &quot;No Hard Feelings&quot;, and &quot;Tribute&quot;.

==Death==
Haines died in Delray Beach, Florida, on July 17, 2008. He was predeceased by his former wives, Gertrude Haines and Jean Pearlman Haines as well as by his only daughter, Debora Haines. He was survived by one niece.

==Film==
Haines appeared in the role of Speed in the film version of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; (1968). He also appeared in the films &quot;The Seven-Ups&quot; (1973) and &quot;Tank&quot; (1984).

<doc id="1015016" wikidata="Q954257" url="?curid=1015016" title="Degenerative disease">
<text>Degenerative disease is the result of a continuous process based on degenerative cell changes, affecting tissues or organs, which will increasingly deteriorate over time.

In neurodegenerative diseases, cells of the central nervous system stop working or die via neurodegeneration. An example of this is Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The other two common groups of degenerative diseases are those that affect circulatory system (e.g. coronary artery disease) and neoplastic diseases (e.g. cancers).

Many degenerative diseases exist and some are related to aging. Normal bodily wear or lifestyle choices (such as exercise or eating habits) may worsen degenerative diseases, depending on the specific condition. Sometimes the main or partial cause behind such diseases is genetic. Thus some are clearly hereditary like Huntington&#x27;s disease. Other causes include viruses, poisons or chemical exposures, while sometimes, the underlying cause remains unknown.

Some degenerative diseases can be cured. In those that can not, it may be possible to alleviate the symptoms.
==Examples==

* Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD)
* Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease)
* Cancers
* Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT)
* Chronic traumatic encephalopathy
* Cystic fibrosis
* Some cytochrome c oxidase deficiencies (often the cause of degenerative Leigh syndrome)
* Ehlers–Danlos syndrome
* Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva
* Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia
* Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
* Some cardiovascular diseases (e.g. atherosclerotic ones like coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, congenital defects etc.)
* Huntington&#x27;s disease
* Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy
* Keratoconus (KC)
* Keratoglobus
* Leukodystrophies
* Macular degeneration (AMD)
* Marfan&#x27;s syndrome (MFS)
* Some mitochondrial myopathies
* Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome
* Mueller–Weiss syndrome
* Multiple sclerosis (MS)
* Multiple system atrophy
* Muscular dystrophies (MD)
* Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis
* Niemann–Pick diseases
* Osteoarthritis
* Osteoporosis
* Parkinson&#x27;s disease
* Pulmonary arterial hypertension
* All prion diseases (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fatal familial insomnia etc.)
* Progressive supranuclear palsy
* Retinitis pigmentosa (RP)
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Sandhoff Disease
* Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA, motor neuron disease)
* Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis
* Substance Use Disorder
* Tay–Sachs disease
* Vascular dementia (might not itself be neurodegenerative, but often appears alongside other forms of degenerative dementia)

<doc id="1015057" wikidata="Q1326966" url="?curid=1015057" title="Honorific">
<text>An honorific is a title that conveys esteem, courtesy, or respect for position or rank when used in addressing or referring to a person. Sometimes, the term &quot;honorific&quot; is used in a more specific sense to refer to an honorary academic title. It is also often conflated with systems of honorific speech in linguistics, which are grammatical or morphological ways of encoding the relative social status of speakers. Honorifics can be used as prefixes or suffixes depending on the appropriate occasion and presentation in accordance with style and customs.

Typically, honorifics are used as a style in the grammatical third person, and as a form of address in the second person. Some languages have anti-honorific (&quot;despective&quot; or &quot;humilific&quot;) first person forms (expressions such as &quot;your most humble servant&quot; or &quot;this unworthy person&quot;) whose effect is to enhance the relative honor accorded to the person addressed.

== Modern English honorifics ==

The most common honorifics in modern English are usually placed immediately before a person&#x27;s name. Honorifics used (both as style and as form of address) include, in the case of a man, &quot;Mr.&quot; (irrespective of marital status), and, in the case of a woman, previously either of two depending on marital status: &quot;Miss&quot; if unmarried and &quot;Mrs.&quot; if married, widowed, or divorced; more recently, a third, &quot;Ms.&quot;, became the more prevalent norm, mainly owing to the desire to avoid identifying women by their marital status. Further considerations regarding identifying people by gender currently are raised with varying prevalence and details; in some environments, honorifics such as Mx., Ind. or Misc. may be used so as not to identify people by gender. In some environments, the honorific &quot;Mstr.&quot; may be used for a boy who has not yet entered adult society; similar to this, &quot;Miss&quot; may be considered appropriate for a girl but inappropriate for a woman (but unless parallel to &quot;Mstr.&quot; the reasoning is not explicit). All the above terms but &quot;Miss&quot; are written as abbreviations—most were originally abbreviations (e.g., from &quot;Mister&quot;, &quot;Mistress&quot;), others may be considered as coined to directly parallel them for consistency. Abbreviations that include the initial and final letters (a type of contraction) are typically written in most English dialects (modern U.K. English, Australian English, South African English as examples) without full stops (periods) but in U.S. English and Canadian English always end with a period.

Other honorifics may denote the honored person&#x27;s occupation, for instance &quot;Doctor&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Captain&quot;, &quot;Coach&quot;, &quot;Officer&quot;, &quot;The Reverend&quot; (for all Christian clergy) or &quot;Father&quot; (for a Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, or Anglican Christian priest), &quot;Rabbi&quot; for Jewish clergy, or Professor. Holders of an academic doctorate, such as a Ph.D., are addressed as &quot;Doctor&quot; (abbreviated Dr.).

Some honorifics act as complete replacements for a name, as &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot;, or &quot;Your Honour/Honor&quot;. Subordinates will often use honorifics as punctuation before asking a superior a question or after responding to an order: &quot;Yes, sir&quot; or even &quot;Sir, yes, sir.&quot;

Judges are often addressed as &quot;Your Honour/Honor&quot; when on the bench, the plural form is &quot;Your Honours&quot; and the style is &quot;His/Her Honour&quot;. If the judge has a higher title, that may be the correct honorific to use, for example, for High Court Judges in England: &quot;Your Lordship&quot; or &quot;My Lord&quot;. Members of the U.S. Supreme Court (as well as some state-level appellate judges) are addressed as &quot;Justice&quot;.

Similarly, a monarch ranking as a king/queen or emperor and his/her consort may be addressed or referred to as &quot;Your/His/Her Majesty&quot;, &quot;Their Majesties&quot;, etc. (but there is no customary honorific accorded to a female monarch&#x27;s consort, as he is usually granted a specific style). Monarchs below kingly rank are addressed as &quot;Your/His/Her Highness&quot;, the exact rank being indicated by an appropriate modifier, e.g. &quot;His Serene Highness&quot; for a member of a princely dynasty, or &quot;Her Grand Ducal Highness&quot; for a member of a family that reigns over a grand duchy. Verbs with these honorifics as subject are conjugated in the third person (e.g. &quot;you are going&quot; vs. &quot;Your Honour is going&quot; or &quot;Her Royal Highness is going&quot;.) Protocol for monarchs and aristocrats can be very complex, with no general rule; great offence can be given by using a form that is not exactly correct. There are differences between &quot;Your Highness&quot; and &quot;Your Royal Highness&quot;; between &quot;Princess Margaret&quot; and &quot;The Princess Margaret&quot;. All these are correct, but apply to people of subtly different rank. An example of a non-obvious style is &quot;Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother&quot;, which was an official style, but unique to one person.

In music, a distinguished conductor or virtuoso instrumentalist may be known as &quot;Maestro&quot;.

In aviation, pilots in command of a larger civil aircraft are usually addressed as &quot;Captain&quot; plus their full name or surname. This tradition is slowly diminishing in the United States and most European Union countries. However, many countries, especially in Asia, follow this tradition and address airline pilots, military pilots, and flight instructors exclusively as &quot;Captain&quot; even outside of the professional environment. In addition, such countries&#x27; etiquette rules dictate that this title must be placed on all the official letters and social invitations, business cards, identification documents, etc. In the U.S., when addressing a pilot, common etiquette does not require the title &quot;Captain&quot; to be printed on official letters or invitations before the addressee&#x27;s full name. However, this is optional (akin to &quot;Esq.&quot; after an attorney&#x27;s name, in the U.S.) and may be used where appropriate, especially when addressing airline pilots with many years of experience.

Occupants of state and political office may be addressed with an honorific. A president may be addressed as Your Excellency or Mr./Madam President, a minister or secretary of state as &quot;Your Excellency&quot; or Mr./Madam Secretary, etc. A prime minister may be addressed as &quot;the Honorable&quot;. In the UK, members of the Privy Council are addressed as &quot;the Right Honourable...&quot;. A member of Parliament or other legislative body may have particular honorifics. A member of a Senate, for example, may be addressed as &quot;Senator&quot;. The etiquette varies and most countries have protocol specifying the honorifics to be used for its state, judicial, military and other officeholders.

Former military officers are sometimes addressed by their last military rank, such as &quot;Admiral&quot;, &quot;Colonel&quot;, &quot;General&quot;, etc. This is generally adopted only by those officers who served and at least obtained the rank equivalency of Major. In the U.S., veterans of all ranks who have served during wartime and were honorably discharged may &#x27;bear the title&#x27; of the highest rank held, as codified in law, 10 USC 772e, both officer and enlisted.

=== Africa ===


In areas of East Africa where the Bantu language Swahili is spoken, &quot;mzee&quot; is frequently used for an elder to denote respect by younger speakers. It is used in direct conversation and used in referring to someone in the third person. Other honorifics include &quot;mukubwa&quot; (for ministers, employers, and authorities), &quot;dada/kaka&quot; (for peers, friends, colleagues), and &quot;mama/baba&quot; (for parents and grandparents). Additionally, some Arabic loanwords are used in coastal regions as honorifics, too, such as &quot;ami&quot; (paternal uncle) and &quot;haloo&quot; (maternal aunt), the familial roles for which are more often described elsewhere in the Swahili-speaking world as &quot;baba mkubwa/mdogo&quot; (older/younger father) or &quot;mama mkubwa/mdogo&quot; (older/younger mother). Furthermore, parents are oftentimes addressed by a combination of their parental title and the name of a child, e.g. &quot;Baba Zekiyah&quot; refers to the father of Zekiyah. While Swahili is Bantu, it is highly influenced by Arabic and Hindi languages and cultures. &quot;Babu&quot; is a prefix honorific used with elders, similar to &quot;mzee&quot;, but may also mean grandfather. Other prefix honorifics are &quot;ndugu&quot;, for brother or a close male friend, and &quot;dada&quot; for a sister or close female friend; thus, John and Jane would be Ndugu John and Dada Jane, respectively.

Amongst the Akan ethnic groups of West Africa&#x27;s Ghana, the word &quot;nana&quot; is used as an aristocratic pre-nominal by chiefs and elders alike.

In Yorubaland, also in West Africa, the word &quot;ogbeni&quot; is used as a synonym for the English &quot;mister&quot;. Titled members of the region&#x27;s aristocracy are therefore called &quot;oloye&quot; instead, this being the word for &quot;chief&quot;. Although the former of the two titles is only used by men, aristocrats of either gender are addressed using the latter of them.

===Europe and former European colonies===
==== Ancient Rome ====

Some honorifics used by Ancient Romans, such as Augustus, turned into titles over time.

==== Italy ====

Italian honorifics are usually limited to formal situations. Professional titles like &quot;Ingegnere&quot; (engineer) are often substituted for the ordinary &quot;Signore&quot; / &quot;Signora&quot; (mister or Mrs.), while &quot;Dottore&quot; or &quot;Dottoressa&quot; (doctor) is used freely for any graduate of a university. For college professors on academic settings, the honorifics &quot;Professore&quot; or &quot;Professoressa&quot; prevail over &quot;Dottore&quot; or &quot;Dottoressa&quot;. Masculine honorifics lose their &quot;e&quot; ending when juxtaposed to a surname: e.g., Dottor Rossi, Cardinal Martini, Ragionier Fantozzi. Verbs are conjugated in the third person singular (as opposed to the second person singular) when addressing someone using an honorific and the formal pronoun &quot;Lei&quot; (with a capital L) is used instead of the informal &quot;tu&quot;.

==== Spanish-speaking cultures ====

Spanish has a number of honorific forms that may be used with or as substitutes for names, such as &quot;señor&quot; or &quot;caballero&quot; (&quot;Mr.&quot;, &quot;Sir&quot;, &quot;Gentleman&quot;); &quot;señora&quot; (&quot;Madam&quot;, &quot;Mrs.&quot;, &quot;Lady&quot;, &quot;ma&#x27;am&quot;) and &quot;señorita&quot; (&quot;Miss&quot;, &quot;young lady&quot;); &quot;licenciado&quot; for a person with bachelor&#x27;s or a professional degree (e.g., attorneys and engineers); &quot;maestro&quot; for a teacher, master mechanic, or person with a master&#x27;s degree; &quot;doctor&quot; (&quot;doctor&quot;); etc. Also used is &quot;don&quot; (male) or &quot;doña&quot; (female) for people of rank or, in some Latin American countries (e.g., Puerto Rico), for any senior citizen. In some Latin American countries, like Colombia, &quot;Doctor&quot; is used for any respected figure regardless of whether they have a doctoral degree (for instance Colombian presidents are often referred to as Doctor ___); likewise &quot;Maestro&quot; is used for artistic masters, especially painters.

Additionally, older people and those with whom one would speak respectfully (e.g., one&#x27;s boss or teacher), are often addressed as &quot;usted,&quot; abbreviated &quot;ud.&quot;, a formal/respectful way of saying &quot;you&quot; (e.g. &quot;Dra. Polo, ¿cómo está usted?&quot; Dr. Polo, how are you?). The word &quot;usted&quot; historically comes from the honorific title &quot;vuestra merced&quot; (literally &quot;your mercy&quot;). This formal you is accompanied by verb conjugation that is different from the informal you &quot;tú&quot;. Intimate friends and relatives are addressed as &quot;tú&quot;. In some regions, addressing a relative stranger as &quot;tú&quot; can be considered disrespectful or provocative, except when it is directed to a person notably younger than the speaker, or in an especially informal context.

===Subcontinental Asia and the Middle East===
==== India ====

Indian honorifics abound, covering formal and informal relationships for commercial, generational, social, and spiritual links. Honorifics may be prefix, suffix, or replacement types. There are many variations.

* &quot;Prefix type&quot;: The most common honorifics in India are usually placed immediately before the name of the subject. Honorifics which can be used of any adult of the appropriate sex include &quot;Sri&quot; (also Romanised as &quot;Shri&quot;, abbreviation of &quot;Sriman&quot;), &quot;Smt&quot; (abbreviation of &quot;Srimati&quot;), and &quot;Kum&quot; (abbreviation of &quot;Kumari&quot;). In Punjab, &quot;Sardar&quot; is used for Sikh men and &quot;Sardarni&quot; for Sikh women. In Tamil, &quot;Thiru&quot; (abbreviation of &quot;Thiruvalar&quot; for men) and &quot;Thirumathi&quot; (for women) are used. In Telugu, Chi (abbreviation of &#x27;chiranjeevi&#x27;) is used for younger men and Chi.La.Sou (Chiranjeevini Lakshmi Soubhagyavathi) is prefixed for the names of younger women. In India, honorifics mostly come prior to the name of object.
* &quot;Replacement type&quot;: Some honorifics, like &quot;Bhavān&quot; or &quot;Bhavatī&quot;, act as complete replacements for a name. For example, in Gujarati, for an uncle who is your mother&#x27;s brother, the replacement honorific &quot;maama&quot; (long &quot;a&quot; then short &quot;a&quot;) is used, and a male friend will often earn the suffix honorific of &quot;bhai&quot;.
* &quot;Suffix type&quot;: 
** The traditional Hindi honorific is the suffix &quot;-ji&quot;. For example, M.K. Gandhi (the Mahatma) was often referred to as Gandhi&quot;-ji&quot;. (Hindi, like many languages, distinguishes between pronouns for persons older in age or status. Such a person is referred as &quot;aap&quot;; a person of same status is called &quot;tum&quot; (both translating as &quot;you&quot; in English, but similar in principle to the &quot;vous&quot;/&quot;tu&quot; distinction in French or the &quot;usted&quot;/&quot;tú&quot; distinction in Spanish). A similar distinction exists for third person pronouns. When honorifics are attached in Hindi, the verb matches the plural case.)
** The traditional Bengali honorific for ordinary men is the suffix &quot;Babu&quot; (বাবু), used with the person&#x27;s given (first) name. Thus, Shubhash Basu would be Shubhash-Babu. For men with whom one has a more formal relationship, the suffix &quot;Moshai&quot; (মশাই) (&quot;mohashoi&quot; (মহাশয়)) is used with the person&#x27;s family (last) name. Thus, Shubhash Basu would be Basu-Moshai.
** The traditional Kannada honorific is the suffix &quot;-avaru&quot;. For example, Visveswariah was referred to as Visveswariah&quot;-avaru&quot;.
** The traditional Marathi honorific is the suffix &quot;-rao&quot;. For example, Madhav Scindia was referred to as Madhav&quot;-rao&quot;.
** The traditional Mizo honorific for men and women are the prefix &quot;Pu&quot; and &quot;Pi&quot; respectively. For example, Pu Laldenga or Pi Ropuiliani. Additionally, the prefix &quot;U&quot; may be used for elder siblings.
** The traditional Tamil honorific is the prefix &quot;Thiru/Tiru&quot; (meaning &quot;sacred&quot;) which is used to address adult males and is often a part of many city names (e.g &quot;Tiruvannamalai&quot;). Another common honorific is &quot;Selvan&quot;, meaning &quot;master&quot;, which is used to address unmarried men. Its female equivalent is &quot;Selvi&quot; (&quot;Miss&quot;).
** The traditional Telugu honorific is the suffix &quot;Garu&quot;. Thus, Potti Sriramulu would be Potti Sriramulu &quot;Garu&quot;.

==== Pakistan ====

Pakistan has numerous honorific forms that may be used with or as a substitute for names. The most common honorifics in Pakistan are usually placed immediately before the name of the subject or immediately after the subject. There are many variations across Pakistan.
* &quot;Prefix type&quot;: The traditional Urdu honorific in Pakistan for a man is the prefix &quot;Mohtaram&quot;. For example, Syed Mohammad Jahangir would become Mohtaram Syed Mohammad Jahangir. The traditional Urdu honorific in Pakistan for a woman is the prefix &quot;Mohtarma&quot;. For example, Shamim Ara would become Mohtarma Shamim Ara. These prefixes are, however, rarely used in formal and informal conversations and are almost entirely used as a title given to a national figure or when writing applications or letters. 
* &quot;Suffix type&quot;: The traditional Urdu honorific in Pakistan for a man is the suffix &quot;&quot;. For example, Syed Zaki Ahmed would become Syed Zaki Ahmed Sahab. The traditional Urdu honorific in Pakistan for a woman is the suffix &quot;Sahiba&quot;; for instance, Shamim Ara would become Shamim Ara Sahiba.
* Bibi/Begum may be used as both a Prefix and Suffix for an honorable lady or even a spouse. Historically the term Begum was used to refer to a Muslim woman of high rank equivalent of Mrs. whereas Bibi can also serve as the equivalent of Miss or Mrs.
* Mian or miyan is an honorific commonly used to refer to any man in general. Historically the term was used to indicate a king or a prince under the suzerainty of the Mughal emperor.
* &quot;Hazrat&quot; is used before the names of religious leaders and scholars.
*Hajji is used before the name of individuals who have completed Hajj
*Sir and Ma&#x27;am/Madam have become increasingly common in formal professional settings. &quot;Baji/Appa/Aapi&quot; (sister), Bhai (brother), &quot;Uncle&quot; (male elder), &quot;Auntie&quot; (female elder) or Khaala (sister) are used in vernacular Urdu and non-professional settings. These honorifics are usually said without the name of the individual. If specification is required, they are more regularly used as suffixes than prefixes (though both are used).

==== Persian cultures ====

Persian honorifics generally follow the second name, especially if they refer to gender or particular social statuses (e.g., &quot;Name Agha&quot; [= Mr. Name], &quot;Name Khanom&quot; [= Ms. Name], &quot;Name Ostad&quot; [teacher or cleric], &quot;Name Rayis&quot; [manager, leader or director]). Such honorifics are used in both formal and informal situations. A more formal honorific referring to gender would be &quot;Jenab&quot; [His Excellency], which precedes &quot;Name Agha&quot; [= Mr. Name] and &quot;Sarkar&quot; [= Her Excellency], which precedes &quot;Name Khanom&quot; [= Ms. Name]. A newer honorific is &quot;Arjomand&quot; [esteemed], which comes after other honorifics (except those referring to gender), and is not gender-specific (e.g., &quot;Ostad Arjomand Name Surname&quot;, or &quot;Rayis Arjomand Sarkar Khanom Name Surname&quot;). They are generally used in very formal situations.

==== Turkey ====

Turkish honorifics generally follow the first name, especially if they refer to gender or particular social statuses (e.g. Name Bey [Mr.], Name Hanım [Ms.], Name Beyefendi [literally meaning &quot;Lord Master&quot;], Name Hanımefendi [literally meaning &quot;Lady Master&quot;], Name Hoca [teacher or cleric], Name Öğretmen [solely for teacher]), Name Agha [high official]. Such honorifics are used in both formal and informal situations. Another honorific is &quot;Sayın&quot;/Muhterem [esteemed], which precedes the surname or full name, and is not gender-specific. (e.g. Sayın/Muhterem Name Surname, or Sayın/Muhterem Surname). They are generally used in very formal situations.
===Southeast and East Asia=== 

==== China ====

Chinese honorifics () and honorific language are words, word constructs, and expressions in the Chinese language that convey self-deprecation, social respect, politeness, or deference. During the ancient and imperial periods, Chinese honorifics varied greatly based on one&#x27;s social status, but with the end of Imperial China, many of these distinctions fell out of favour due to the May Fourth Movement. As such, honorific usage today is mostly used in formal situations and business settings only. Although Chinese honorifics have simplified to a large degree, many classical constructs are still occasionally employed to convey formality, humility, politeness or respect. Honorific language in Chinese is achieved by using honorific or beautifying alternatives, prefixing or suffixing a word with a polite complement, or by dropping casual-sounding words. 

In general, there are five distinct categories of honorific language:

* Respectful Language (), which is used when referring to others to show deference and politeness.
* Humble Language (), which is used when referring to oneself in a self-deprecating manner to show humbleness and humility.
* Indirect Language (), which is the use of euphemisms or tactful language to approach sensitive topics and show respect.
* Courteous Language (), which employs praising and laudatory words or phrases with the intent to flatter the addressee.
* Elegant Language (), which employs elegant and beautiful expressions and words in lieu of more casual words and phrases to describe people, objects, actions or concepts. It is often used on occasions where casual language may be deemed inappropriate. Due to the lack of equivalent expressions in English, translated phrases often do not convey the same sense of beauty or elegance.

==== Japan ====

In Japanese, honorifics called are used in everyday conversation. Most of them denote how the speaker&#x27;s status relates to the one they are speaking to, and their use is mandatory in many formal and informal social situations. Japanese grammar, as a whole, tends to function on hierarchy; honorific stems are appended to verbs and many nouns, though primarily names, and in many cases one word may be exchanged for another word entirely with the same verb or noun meaning, but with different honorific connotations.

In Japan, there are three rough divisions of honorifics:

* , the most popular &quot;keigo&quot; that is used in daily life, used as a formal and polite way of speaking to others in general. It is usually used when the speaker does not know the other person well. Under &quot;teineigo&quot; there is also which is used when people simply want to speak in a polite way regardless of the age or class of the other person.
* is another type of &quot;keigo&quot;. It is used to make the person who is being spoken to in a higher position. It is mainly used at work and when speaking with teachers. In the past, this was a type of language that was formed based on the classes Japanese society used to have. is the highest &quot;sonkeigo&quot; that exists and it is used only for the Japanese emperor, his family members and equivalent foreign nobles.
* lowers the position of the speaker or the subject of the conversation, and is primarily used at the workplace and in academia. This is also specifically used when the person is much older or in a higher position than the speaker, or often when one apologizes to someone else.

==== Javanese (Indonesia) ====

Indonesia&#x27;s Javanese majority ethnicity has many honorifics. For example:

* &quot;Bang&quot; or &quot;Bung&quot; is a somewhat outdated, egalitarian term to refer to a brotherhood among men. &quot;Bang&quot; is Betawi language for &quot;Mas&quot;.
* &quot;Bapak&quot; and its contraction &quot;Pak&quot; meaning: &quot;Sir&quot;, &quot;Mister&quot;, or literally &quot;Father&quot;.
* &quot;Bapak Cilik&quot; and its contraction &quot;Pak lik&quot; are used for a very familiar friend or sir; they literally meaning &quot;small father&quot; or a relative younger than one&#x27;s father.
* &quot;Bapak Gede&quot; and its contraction &quot;Pak de&quot; are used for a big father, uncle, or relative older than one&#x27;s father, meaning literally &quot;Grand Sir&quot;.
* &quot;Bendara Raden Mas&quot;, &quot;Bendara Mas&quot;, or the contraction &quot;&#x27;ndoro&quot;, meaning &quot;Prince, flag-bearer &#x27;His Highness.
* &quot;Eyang Putera Kakung&quot; and its contraction &quot;Eyang Kakung&quot; meaning &quot;grandfather&quot;, literally &quot;Grand Sir&quot;.
* &quot;Eyang Puteri&quot; and its contraction &quot;Eyang&quot; meaning &quot;grandmother&quot;, literally &quot;Grand Lady&quot;.
* &quot;Ibu&quot; and its contraction &quot;Bu&quot; meaning: &quot;Madam&quot;, &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot;, &quot;Ms.&quot;, or &quot;Mrs.&quot;, and literally meaning &quot;Mother&quot;.
* &quot;I Gusti&quot; means &quot;His or Her Royal Majesty&quot;.
* &quot;Kyai&quot; is an honorific used with a highly respected Muslim cleric (same as mullah in Iran and maulana in South Asia).
* &quot;Mbak yu&quot; and the more common &quot;mbak&quot; are derived from Surakarta court. Initially used to address unmarried women who are adolescents or of marriageable age, they are now used with all women, with no age or marital status connotation.
* &quot;Mbok&quot; is not an honorific; it denotes an older woman of very low status, in some cases a mother (Common Language).
* &quot;Raden Behi&quot;, contracted to &quot;Den Behi&quot;, means &quot;Heir Apparent&quot; and is now obsolete.
* &quot;Raden Emas&quot; and its contraction &quot;Mas&quot; denote: &quot;Mr.&quot; among colleagues, friends, and others of slightly higher age or social status, meaning literally &quot;Golden Son&quot;, &quot;Lord&quot;, or &quot;Heir Apparent&quot;.
* &quot;Raden Emas Behi&quot;, contracted to &quot;Mas Behi&quot;, means &quot;Second Heir Apparent&quot; and is now obsolete.

==== Korea ====


Korean honorifics are similar to Japanese honorifics, and similarly, their use is mandatory in many formal and informal social situations. Korean grammar as a whole tends to function on hierarchy; honorific stems are appended to verbs and some nouns, and in many cases, one word may be exchanged for another word entirely with the same verb or noun meaning, but with different honorific connotations. Linguists say there are six levels of honorifics in Korean but, in daily conversation, only four of them are widely used in contemporary Korean. Suffix -ssi-(씨) is used at most honorific verbs, but not always. It is considered very impolite and offensive not to use honorific sentences or words with someone who is older or has a higher social status, and most Koreans avoid using non-honorific sentences with someone they have met for the first time. In Korean, names, first or last, always precede a title, e.g., Park Sonsaengnim, Park Kwanjangnim, etc.

==== Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore ====

A complex system of Titles and honorifics is extensively used in the Malay language-speaking cultures in Brunei and Malaysia. In contrast Singapore, whose Malay royalty was abolished by the British colonial government in 1891, has adopted civic titles for its leaders. Being Muslim, Malay people address high-ranking religious scholars as &quot;tok imam&quot; (grandpa imam). &quot;Tok dalang&quot; is a honorific used to address a village leader.

==== Philippines ====

The usage of Filipino honorifics differs from person to person, though commonalities occur like the occasional insertion of the word &quot;po&quot; or &quot;ho&quot; in conversations, and their dependence on age-structured hierarchies. Though some have become obsolete, many are still widely used in order to denote respect, friendliness, or affection. Some new &quot;honorifics&quot;, mainly used by teenagers, are experiencing surges in popularity.

The Filipino language has honorifics like &quot;Binibini/Ate&quot; (&quot;Miss&quot;, &quot;Big sister&quot;), &quot;Ginang/Aling/Manang&quot; (&quot;Mrs.&quot;, &quot;Madam&quot;), &quot;Ginoo/Mang/Manong/Kuya&quot; (&quot;Mister&quot;, &quot;Sir&quot;, &quot;Big brother&quot;) that have roots in Chinese culture.

Depending on one&#x27;s relation with the party being addressed, various honorifics may be used.

As such addressing a man who is older, has a higher rank at work or has a higher social standing, one may use Mr or Sir followed by the First/ last/ or full name.
Addressing a woman in a similar situation as above one may use &quot;Miss&quot;, or &quot;Madam&quot; and its contraction &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot;, followed by First/ last/ or full name. Older married women may prefer to be addressed as &quot;Mrs.&quot;
The use of Sir/Miss/Madam or Ma&#x27;am, followed by the first name, nickname, or surname is usually restricted to Filipino vernacular and social conversation, even in television and film. Despite this, non-Filipinos and naturalized Filipinos (such as expat students and professionals) also address older people in the Filipino way.

On a professional level, many use educational or occupational titles such as Architect, Engineer, Doctor, Attorney (often abbreviated as Arch./Archt./Ar., Engr., Dr. [or sometimes Dra. for female doctors], and Atty. respectively) on casual and even formal bases. Stricter etiquette systems frown upon this practise as a sign of Filipino professionals&#x27; obsession with flaunting their educational attainment and professional status. Despite this, some of their clients (especially non-Filipinos) would address them as simply Mr. or Mrs./Ms. followed by their surnames (or even Sir/Ma&#x27;am) in conversation. It is very rare, however, for a Filipino (especially those born and educated abroad) to address Filipino architects, engineers, and lawyers, even mentioning and referring to their names, the non-Philippine (i.e. international standard) way.

Even foreigners who work in the Philippines or naturalized Filipino citizens, including foreign spouses of Filipinos, who hold some of these titles and descriptions (especially as instructors in Philippine colleges and universities) are addressed in the same way as their Filipino counterparts, although it may sound awkward or unnatural to some language purists who argue that the basic titles or either &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Ma&#x27;am/Madam&quot; are to be employed for simplicity, as they are unnecessary when he or she is included in a list of wedding sponsors, or when their name appears in the list of officials of a country club or similar organization. They are uncalled for in public donations, religious activities, parents–teachers association events, athletic competitions, society pages of newspapers, and in any activity that has nothing to do with one&#x27;s title or educational attainment. It is also acceptable to treat those titles and descriptions (except &quot;Doctor&quot;) as adjectival nouns (i.e., first letter not capitalized, e.g. &quot;architect&quot; ) instead.

Even though Doctor is really a title in standard English, the &quot;created&quot; titles Architect, Attorney, and Engineer (among other examples) are a result of vanity (titles herald achievement and success; they distinguish the title holder from the rest of society) and insecurity (the title holder&#x27;s achievements and successes might be ignored unless announced to the public), even due to historical usage of pseudo-titles in newspapers when Filipinos first began writing in English.

Possible reasons are firstly, the fact the English taught to Filipinos was the &quot;egalitarian&quot; English of the New World, and that the Americans who colonized the Philippines encountered lowland societies that already used Iberian linguistic class markers like &quot;Don&quot; and &quot;Doña.&quot; Secondly, the fundamental contradiction of the American colonial project. The Americans who occupied the Philippines justified their actions through the rhetoric of &quot;benevolent assimilation&quot;. In other words, they were only subjugating Filipinos to teach them values like American egalitarianism, which is the opposite of colonial anti-equality. Thirdly, the power of American colonialism lies in its emphasis on education—an education that supposedly exposed Filipinos to the &quot;wonders&quot; of the American way of life. Through education, the American colonial state bred a new elite of Filipinos trained in a new, more &quot;modern&quot;, American system. People with advanced degrees like law or engineering were at the apex of this system. Their prestige, as such, not only rested on their purported intelligence, but also their mastery of the colonizer&#x27;s way of life. This, Lisandro Claudio suspects, is the source of the magical and superstitious attachment Filipinos have to attorneys, architects and engineers. The language they use is still haunted by their colonial experience. They linguistically privilege professionals because their colonizers made them value a certain kind of white-collar work. Again, even expatriate professionals in the Philippines were affected by these reasons when they resided and married a Filipino or were naturalized so it is not unusual for them to be addressed Filipino style.

==== Thailand ====

According to Thai translator, Mui Poopoksakul, &quot;The Thai language is absolutely immediate in its indication of the speaker and addressee&#x27;s places in the society and their relationship to each other. Thai has honorifics as well as what I like to call &#x27;dishonorifics&#x27;: it has a multitude of pronouns that are extremely nuanced—for example, there are so many ways to say &#x27;I&#x27;, and most of them already indicate the speaker&#x27;s gender and often their age and societal standing relative to the person they are speaking to.&quot;

The most common Thai honorifics are used to differentiate age between friends, family, and peers. The most commonly used are:

* คุณ () (mid tone) is used the same way as &quot;mister&quot; or &quot;Mrs&quot; or &quot;Miss&quot;. It is a formal way to refer to persons not overly familiar. It is also used as a pronoun for the word &quot;you&quot;.

* พี่ () (falling tone) is used when speaking to or about an older sibling or friend. It is used for both men and women and can also be used when referring to oneself if one is older than the addressees.

* น้อง () (high tone) is the exact opposite of the above. It is use when speaking to or about a younger sibling or friend. It is used between both men and women and can also be used when referring to oneself if the person speaking is younger than the addressees. It could be used by a babysitter to address the child she takes care of.

* ครู () (mid tone) is used when addressing a teacher, translating literally to &#x27;teacher&#x27;.

* อาจารย์ () (mid-tone both syllables) is used to address a professor. It is used much in the same way as &quot;khru&quot; however &quot;achan&quot; carries more prestige. It generally refers to someone who is a master in their field. Many Theravada Buddhist scholars and those who have dedicated their lives to Theravada Buddhism assume this title among their followers.

* พระ () (high tone) This is perhaps one of the highest honorifics in Thai culture. It is reserved for monks and priests. It is also allows for use when referring to a most revered place or object such as a temple or palace.

==== Vietnam ====

Honorifics in Vietnamese are more complex compared to Chinese, where the origins of many of these pronouns can be traced, and many have fallen out of usage or have been replaced due to the changing times. An honorific, or a pronoun, in Vietnamese when referring to a person acts as a way to define two peoples&#x27; degree of relationship with one another. Examples of these pronouns include &#x27;chị&#x27; older sister, &#x27;ông&#x27; male elder and &#x27;chú&#x27; younger uncle (younger brother of father/only used on father&#x27;s side). The exclusive use of the Vietnamese words for &#x27;I&#x27; and &#x27;you&#x27; are considered informal and rude. Rather honorifics are used to refer to oneself and to others. These terms generally differ from province to province, or region to region. As with East Asian tradition, the surname is written prior to the given name (i.e., Hoang Khai Dinh: Hoang is the surname and Khai Dinh is the given name). This occurs in all formal situations. However, placing the surname last has become a commonality in order to cater to westerners, for example, on social media sites such as Facebook. When referring to a person as Mr or Mrs (teacher, painter, etc.) as in the English tradition of &#x27;Mr Hoang&#x27;, the given name is more commonly used e.g., &quot;Mr Khai Dinh&quot;) in order not to cause confusion. This is due to many Vietnamese sharing the same surname (e.g., up to 40% of Vietnamese share the surname Nguyen).
===Oceania===
====Fiji====

Many honorifics are used within the culture of Fiji in Melanesia. The most commonly encountered of these is the chiefly title Ratu and its female equivalent Adi.

==== Māori (New Zealand) ====
Within New Zealand&#x27;s Māori culture, the term &quot;ariki&quot; is used for a chief, with the Maori King or Queen addressed as &quot;arikinui&quot; (literally &quot;big chief&quot; or &quot;high chief&quot;). The term &quot;ariki&quot; and cognates such as &quot;&#x27;aliki&quot; and &quot;ali&#x27;i&quot; are used in many other Polynesian nations for the same honorific purpose.

Respected elders within the country&#x27;s &quot;iwi&quot; (tribes) are given the honorific &quot;kaumātua&quot;, literally meaning &quot;without parents&quot;. This reflects that the person is likely to be in the oldest living generation, which in theory holds tribal knowledge. Male and female &quot;kaumātua&quot; are often referred to as &quot;koro&quot; and &quot;kuia&quot; respectively, terms which can be roughly traslated as &quot;grandfather&quot; and &quot;grandmother&quot;.

==== Pingelap (Micronesia) ====
Pingelapese is a Micronesian language spoken on the Pingelap atoll and on two of the eastern Caroline Islands, called the high island of Pohnpei. Pingelapese does not employ many honorifics into their speech. Their society is structured in a way that everyone is seen as equal, most likely due to the fact that there are so few of them due to emigration. There is no structured hierarchy to enforce the use of honorific speech. There are not many polite vocabulary words and the language they use can be classified as a commoners&#x27; language.

However, among the Micronesian languages, Pohnpeian is the only language that uses a thoroughly developed honorific speech. This demonstrates that a highly structured hierarchical society was very important in their culture. There are multiple ways that Pohnpeic speakers show respect through their language. In the Pohnpeic language there is royal language, which is used for the two highest-ranking chiefs. Next, respect honorifics are used with other superiors and people who are considered respected equals. There is not only the use of honorifics, but humiliative language as well, which is used to lower oneself below higher-ranking people, showing respect and reverence. This speech was lost in Pingelap when Pohnpei speakers migrated to the Pingelap atoll and adapted their more casual way of speaking.

Even though the younger generation of Pingelapese speakers does not use honorific speech, elders in the language report being taught a form of &#x27;language of respect&#x27;. This language was to be used to address elders and leaders in the community. Women were also told to use it towards their brothers and with their children. Phrases could be made polite by adding the second person singular possessive suffix &quot;-mwi&quot;. Other ways to utilize honorific speech is by changing words entirely.

====Wuvulu-Aua (Papua New Guinea) ====
Wuvulu-Aua does not normally incorporate honorifics as it is reserved for only the utmost respect. Originally without any honorifics, the semantics of pronouns change depending on the social context. In particular, the second person dual pronoun is used as an honorific address. The dual reference communicates that the second person is to be respected as two people. This honorific is typically reserved for in-laws. It is undocumented if any other honorifics exist beyond this one.

== Opposition and alternatives ==

People who have a strong sense of egalitarianism, such as Quakers and certain socialists, and others, eschew honorific titles. When addressing or referring to someone, they often use the person&#x27;s name, an informal pronoun, or some other style implying social equality, such as &quot;brother&quot;, &quot;sister&quot;, &quot;friend&quot;, or &quot;comrade&quot;. This was also the practice in Revolutionary France and socialist countries which used (&quot;Citizen&quot;) as the manner of address. Also, some revolutionary governments abolished or banned the use of honorifics. One example is Turkey, which abolished honorifics and titles in 1934. Although it was abolished, titles such as &quot;ağa&quot; (for landlords) and &quot;paşa&quot; (for high-ranking military officials) continued to be used by people.

Feminist criticism of the use of separate honorifics for married and unmarried women (Mrs. and Miss) has led to some women adopting the honorific &quot;Ms.&quot;

<text>During World War II, the Nazi German were a sub-group of the &quot;&quot; (mobile killing squads) – up to 3,000 men total – usually composed of 500–1,000 functionaries of the SS and Gestapo, whose mission was to exterminate Jews, Polish intellectuals, Romani, and communists in the captured territories often far behind the advancing German front. &quot;Einsatzkommandos&quot;, along with &quot;Sonderkommandos&quot;, were responsible for the systematic murder of Jews during the aftermath of Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. After the war, several commanders were tried in the Einsatzgruppen trial, convicted, and executed.

==Organization of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;==
&quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; () were paramilitary groups originally formed in 1938 under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich – Chief of the SD, and &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; (Security Police; SiPo). They were operated by the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS). The first &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; of World War II were formed in the course of the 1939 invasion of Poland. Then following a Hitler-Himmler directive, the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were re-formed in anticipation of the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union. The &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were once again under the control of Reinhard Heydrich as Chief of the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA); and after his assassination, under the control of his successor, Ernst Kaltenbrunner.

Hitler ordered the SD and the Security Police to suppress the threat of native resistance behind the Wehrmacht&#x27;s fighting front. Heydrich met with General Eduard Wagner representing Wilhelm Keitel, who agreed to the activation, commitment, command, and jurisdiction of Security Police and SD units in the Wehrmacht″s table of operations and equipment (TOE); in the rear operational areas, the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were to function in administrative sub-ordination to the field armies in order to effect the tasks assigned them by Heydrich. Their principal task (during the war), according to SS General Erich von dem Bach, at the Nuremberg Trials: &quot;was the annihilation of the Jews, Gypsies, and Soviet political commissars&quot;. They were a key component in the implementation of the &quot;Final Solution of the Jewish question&quot; (German: &quot;Die Endlösung der Judenfrage&quot;) in the conquered territories. These killing units should be viewed in conjunction with the Holocaust.

The military commanders knew the task of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;. The &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; depended upon their sponsoring army commander for billet, food, and transportation. Relations between the regular army and the SiPo and the SD were close. &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; commanders reported that the understanding by Wehrmacht commanders of &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; tasks made their operations considerably easier.

For Operation Barbarossa (June 1941), initially four &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were created, each numbering 500–990 men to comprise a total force of 3,000. Each unit was attached to an army group: &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; A to Army Group North; &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; B to Army Group Center, &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; C to Army Group South, and &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; D to the 11th German Army. Led by SD, Gestapo, and Criminal Police (Kripo) officers, &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; included recruits from the regular police (Orpo), SD and Waffen-SS, augmented by uniformed volunteers from the local auxiliary police force. When occasion demanded, German Army commanders bolstered the strength of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; with their own regular-army troops who assisted in rounding up and murdering Jews of their own accord.

==The earliest &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; in occupied Poland==

The first eight &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; of World War II were formed in 1939 for the invasion of Poland. They were composed of the Gestapo, Kripo and SD functionaries, and deployed during the classified Operation Tannenberg (codename for murder of Polish civilians) and the Intelligenzaktion lasting till the spring of 1940; followed by the German AB-Aktion which ended in late 1940. Long before the attack on Poland, the Nazis prepared a detailed list identifying more than 61,000 Polish targets by name, with the help of the German minority living in the Second Polish Republic. The list was printed as a called &quot;Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen&quot; (Special Prosecution Book–Poland), and composed only of names and birthdates. It included politicians, scholars, actors, intelligentsia, doctors, lawyers, nobility, priests, officers and numerous others – as the means at the disposal of the SS paramilitary death squads aided by Selbstschutz executioners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Browning-31/34&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1939 already, they summarily murdered around 50,000 Poles and Jews in the annexed territories, including over 1,000 POWs.

The SS operational groups were assigned Roman numerals for the first time on 4 September 1939. Before that, their names were derived from the names of their places of origin in the German language.

His group consisted of 340 men from the Waffen-SS, 89 from the Gestapo, 35 from the SD, 133 from the Orpo, and 41 from the Kripo. Soviet troops withdrew from the Lithuanian temporary capital Kaunas (Kovno) the day before, and the city was taken over by Lithuanians during the anti-Soviet uprising. On 25 June, the &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; A entered Kaunas with the forward units of the German army.

===&quot;Jäger&quot; Report===

The &quot;Jäger&quot; Report is the most precise surviving chronicle of the activities of one &quot;Einsatzkommando&quot;. It is a tally sheet of the actions of &quot;Einsatzkommando&quot; 3—a running total of their killings of 136,421 Jews (46,403 men, 55,556 women, 34,464 children), 1,064 Communists, 653 persons with mental disabilities, and 134 others, from 2 July to 1 December 1941. A second, major sweep occurred in 1942, before death camp murders replaced &quot;Einsatzkommando&quot; open-pit executions. &quot;Einsatzkommando&quot; 3 operated in the Kovno (Kaunas) district, west of Vilna (Vilnius) in contemporary Lithuania. (See also Rollkommando Hamann)

==&quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; B ==
The operational command of &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; B, attached to the Army Group Center, was established under the command of Arthur Nebe a few days after the German attack on the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa. &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; B departed from the occupied city of Poznań (Posen) on 24 June 1941, with 655 men from the Security Police, Gestapo, Kripo, SD, Waffen-SS and the 2nd Company of Reserve Police Battalion 9. On 30 June 1941 Himmler visited the newly formed Bezirk Bialystok district and pronounced that more forces were needed in the area, due to potential risks of partisan warfare. The chase after the Red Army&#x27;s rapid retreat left behind a security vacuum, which required urgent deployment of additional personnel.
Scrambling to meet the &quot;new threat&quot;, Gestapo headquarters in Zichenau (Ciechanów) formed a lesser known unit called &quot;Kommando SS Zichenau-Schroettersburg&quot;, which departed from the sub-station Schröttersburg (Płock) under the command of &quot;SS-Obersturmführer&quot; Hermann Schaper, with the mission to murder Jews, communists and the NKVD collaborators across the local villages and towns in the Bezirk. On 3 July additional formation of &quot;Schutzpolizei&quot; arrived in Białystok from the General Government. It was led by &quot;SS-Hauptsturmführer&quot; Wolfgang Birkner, veteran of &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; IV from the Polish Campaign of 1939. The relief unit, called &quot;Kommando Bialystok&quot;, was sent in by &quot;SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer&quot; Eberhard Schöngarth on orders from the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA), due to reports of Soviet guerrilla activity in the area with Jews being of course immediately suspected of helping them out. On 10 July 1941, Schaper&#x27;s unit was split into smaller &quot;Einsatzkommandos&quot; due to requirements of Operation Barbarossa.

In addition to mass shootings, &quot;Einsatzgruppe B&quot; engaged in public hangings used as a terror tactic on the local population. An &quot;Einsatzgruppe B&quot; report, dated 9 October 1941, described one such hanging. Due to suspected partisan activity in the area around the settlement of Demidov, all males aged fifteen to fifty-five in Demidov were detained in a camp for screening. The screening produced seventeen people identified as &#x27;partisans&#x27; and &#x27;communists&#x27;. Thereafter, 400 local residents were assembled to watch the hanging of five members of the group; the rest were shot.

On 14 November 1941, Nebe told Berlin that, up until then, 45,000 persons had been eliminated. A further report, dated 15 December 1942, established that the &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; B had shot a total of 134,298 people. After 1943, the mass killings of &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; B diminished, and the unit was decommissioned in August 1944.

;Commanders:
#&quot;SS-Gruppenführer und Generalmajor der Polizei&quot; Arthur Nebe (June–November 1941)
#&quot;SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Polizei&quot; Erich Naumann (November 1941 – March 1943)
#&quot;SS-Standartenführer&quot; Horst Böhme (12 March–28 August 1943)
#&quot;SS-Oberführer und Oberst der Polizei&quot; Erich Ehrlinger (28 August 1943 – April 1944)
#&quot;SS-Oberführer und Oberst der Polizei&quot; Heinrich Seetzen (28 April–August 1944)
#&quot;SS-Standartenführer&quot; Horst Böhme (12 August 1944)

Around 5 July 1941, Nebe consolidated &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; B near Minsk, establishing a headquarters and remaining there for some two months. The &quot;Gruppenführer&quot; determined that &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; 7a and &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; 7b and the &quot;Vorkommando&quot; Moskau would follow the Army Group Center, while &quot;Einsatzkommandos&quot; 8 and 9 clean up to the sides of the spearhead. In compliance, &quot;Einsatzkommando&quot; 8 reached Bialystok on 1 July, passed through Słonim and Baranowicze, and began systematic mass killing operations in modern-day southern Belarus (eastern Poland before World War II).

On 5 August, Nebe moved his &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; command to Smolensk, where the &quot;Vorkommando&quot; Moskau was concentrated. On 6 August, &quot;Einsatzkommando&quot; 8 reached Minsk, remaining there until 9 September 1941. From Minsk, it reached Mogilev, which became its general headquarters, and from there &quot;Einsatzkommando&quot; 8 effected successive killings in Bobruisk, Gomel, Roslavl, and Klintsy systematically attacking the local Jewish communities, and killing the inhabitants.

Meanwhile, &quot;Einsatzkommando&quot; 9 was put to work; they had left Treuburg, in eastern Prussia, and reached Vilna on 2 July. Their main theater of mass killing operations were Grodno and Bielsk-Podlaski (Biala-Podlaska). On 20 July it moved its headquarters to Vitebsk, and then exterminated the citizens of Polotzk, Nevel, Lepel, and Surazh. The command progressed to Vtasma, and from there they killed the communities of Gshatsk and Mozhaisk in the Moscow vicinity. The Soviet counter-offensive forced the &quot;Einsatzkommando&quot; to withdraw to Vitebsk on 21 December 1941. Anticipating the fall of Moscow, the &quot;Vorkommando&quot; Moskau advanced to Maloyaroslavets, earlier captured by the Wehrmacht on 18 October 1941. In practice, &quot;Sonderkommandos&quot; 7a and 7b operated behind the vanguard of the army. The actions were fast, in order to prevent the Jews from escaping the advancing German Army. To the south and east of Smolensk and Minsk, the two &quot;Sonderkommandos&quot; left a wake of dead civilians, from Velikiye Luki, Kalinin, Orsha, Gomel, Chernigov and Orel, to Kursk.

;&quot;Sonderkommando&quot; 7a
&quot;Sonderkommando&quot; 7a led by Walter Blume, was attached to the 9th Army under General Adolf Strauß. SK 7a entered Vilna on 27 June and remained there until 3 July. Soon Vilna was in the command sphere of &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; A, and &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; 7a was transferred to Kreva near Minsk. The &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; was active in Vilna, Nevel, Haradok, Vitebsk, Velizh, Rzhev, Vyazma, Kalinin, and Klintsy. It executed 1344 people.

<text>The Primero River (, &#x27;First River&#x27;), also known as Suquía (the name used by the Comechingones, the indigenous people), runs through the city of Córdoba, Argentina.

The tributaries of the Primero (mainly the San Roque and Cosquín rivers) flow into the San Roque Reservoir; from there, the Primero goes east into the plains surrounding the city of Córdoba.

Once inside the city, the river channels into &quot;La Cañada&quot;, a waterway delineated by a stonework canal built through the downtown area, and inaugurated in 1944. About to the east, &quot;Isla de los Patos&quot; (Ducks Island) was repopulated with ducks and swans in the 1980s. During the crisis years of 1988–91 and 2001–02, the duck population was devastated, allegedly by people desperately looking for food. It was reported in March 2006 that a large number of ducks had died due to unspecified causes. Pollution by chemical waste is suspected as the cause, but avian influenza is also being investigated as a possible cause.

Beyond the city limits, the river flows towards the Algarrobos swamp and ends its course on the southern coast of the Mar Chiquita (or Mar de Ansenuza) salt lake. All in all, the river has a length of approximately and carries, on average, , with a minimum of and a maximum of , with a peak during the summer months.

Pollution of the water and of the riverbank is a major environmental issue in Córdoba. Periodic cleaning operations are carried out to increase the quality of the water and to preserve the viability of fishing, both in the San Roque reservoir area and downstream.

<text>Robert Rand Brittingham Beers (born November 30, 1942) is an American government official. He served as Deputy Homeland Security Advisor to the President of the United States during the Barack Obama administration. He also served as acting Secretary of Homeland Security following the resignation of Secretary Janet Napolitano on September 6, 2013, until Jeh Johnson assumed that office on December 23, 2013.

==Early career==
Beers began his professional career as a Marine officer and rifle company commander in Vietnam (1964–1968). He entered the Foreign Service in 1971 and transferred to the Civil Service in 1983. He served most of his career in the Department of State, including as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Regional Affairs in the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, focusing on the Middle East and Persian Gulf (1992–1993). He was Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (1998–2002).

Beers also served on the NSC Staff in the following capacies: Director for Counter-terrorism and Counter-narcotics (1988–1992), Director for Peacekeeping (1993–1995), and Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Intelligence Programs (1995–1998), and Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Combating Terrorism on the NSC Staff (2002–2003).

He resigned from the NSC Staff in March 2003, retired from government service in April 2003, and served as national security advisor for the Kerry-Edwards campaign (2003–2004).

==John McCain controversy==
Beers stirred up controversy with remarks he made at an event hosted by the Center for American Progress in June 2008. The event, dubbed &quot;McCain University,&quot; was a comprehensive effort to illustrate John McCain&#x27;s policy proposals in the context of the 2008 Presidential Election. During the question and answer portion of the event, Beers noted that &quot;his [John McCain&#x27;s] national security experience [...] is sadly limited&quot; due to the fact that &quot;he was in isolation essentially for many of those years and did not experience the turmoil here or the challenges that were involved for those of us who served in Vietnam during the Vietnam war.&quot; McCain, a captured U.S. Navy aviator, was a prisoner of war of the North Vietnamese government for several years, and was repeatedly tortured. Beers&#x27;s comments elicited widespread criticism from conservative observers such as Rush Limbaugh and Karl Rove, as well as a variety of right-wing blogs.

==Homeland Security career==
As Under Secretary, Beers directed the Department&#x27;s efforts to reduce risks to physical, cyber and communications infrastructures. NPPD collaborates with all levels of government, the private sector, non-government organizations, and international bodies to prevent, respond to, and mitigate threats to U.S. national security from acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and other catastrophic events.

He is a member of the National Infrastructure Advisory Council.

Beers served as Counselor to Secretary Janet Napolitano beginning on January 21, 2009, and continued in that capacity while directing the activities of NPPD. Before his appointment, he was the co-leader of the Department of Homeland Security Transition Team for the incoming Obama administration. Prior to the 2008 election, Beers was president of the National Security Network, a Washington, D.C.–based foreign policy think tank he founded in 2006 to foster discussion of progressive national security ideas around the country, and an adjunct lecturer at Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University.

Between April and September in 2013, he was the acting United States Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security.

Following Napolitano&#x27;s resignation on September 6, 2013, Beers became acting United States Secretary of Homeland Security. His tenure ended when Jeh Johnson was confirmed as Napolitano&#x27;s replacement by the United States Senate on December 23, 2013.

==Personal life==
Beers earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Dartmouth College and a master&#x27;s degree from the University of Michigan. The &quot;New York Times&quot; described Beers as &quot;always a Democrat, though he served in several Republican administrations and says he voted for only one Republican: Spiro T. Agnew for governor of Maryland in 1966&quot;.

<text>Sundal or Sunndal is the largest village in the Mauranger district of Kvinnherad municipality in Vestland county, Norway. The village is located on the southern shore of the Maurangsfjorden, south of Nordrepollen and Gjetingsdalen. The village of Austrepollen lies to the east of Sunndal. It sits in a deep valley, with steep mountains surrounding it on three sides. The Bondhusbreen glacier is located at the southern end of the valley.

The village has been a centre of tourism for over 150 years. There are about 70 inhabitants in the village, which has a camping ground, a shop, and an inn. At the end of the 19th century, German and English tourists travelled to Sundal to experience the great nature including the nearby Folgefonna glacier, and the small Bondhusbreen arm which reaches into the valley towards Sundal. Today, the nearby Folgefonna National Park is a major draw to the area which is popular among outdoor enthusiasts.

<text>Dadaab () is a semi-arid town in Garissa County, Kenya. It is the site of a UNHCR base hosting 302,805 registered refugees and asylum seekers as of 31 October 2023, in four camps (Dagahaley, Hagadera and Ifo, and Ifo 2), making it one of the largest in the world behind Kutupalong refugee camp. The centre is run by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and its operations are financed by foreign donors. In 2013, UNHCR, the governments of Kenya and Somalia signed a tripartite agreement facilitating the repatriation of Somali refugees at the complex.

==Establishment==

===Construction===

The Dadaab camps Dagahaley, Hagadera and Ifo were constructed in 1992. In 2011 and 2013, two new refugee camps were opened when 164,000 new refugees from Somalia arrived, due to severe drought. The Ifo II camp extension was originally constructed in 2007 by the Norwegian Refugee Council, in response to major flooding that destroyed over 2,000 homes in the Ifo refugee camp. However, legal problems with the Kenyan Government prevented Ifo II from fully opening for relocation, until 2011. As of 13 May, Hagadera was the largest of the camps, containing just over 74,744 individuals and 17,490 households. Ifo refugee camp, on the other hand, is the smallest camp with 65,974 refugees. Former Kambioss and Ifo2 refugee camps were closed in April 2017 and May 2018, respectively.

Ifo camp was first settled by refugees from the civil war in Somalia. The UNHCR subsequently made efforts to improve the premises. As the population of the camps in Dadaab grew, UNHCR commissioned the German architect Werner Schellenberg to draw the original design for Dagahaley Camp. Swedish architect Per Iwansson, designed and initiated the establishment of Hagadera camp.

===Population growth and decline===

People first began arriving at the Dadaab complex shortly after its construction in 1992, with most escaping the Somali Civil War. When refugees arrive at the camp, they are registered and fingerprinted by the Kenyan government. However, the camps themselves are managed by the UNHCR, with other organizations directly in charge of specific aspects of the resident&#x27; lives. CARE oversees Water and Sanitation Hygiene as well as warehouse management and the World Food Programme (WFP) distributes food rations. Until 2003, only Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) provided refugees with access to health-care. Now, healthcare is decentralized. Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) provides health care services in ifo refugee camp, International Rescue committee (IRC) in Hagadera and Medicins Sans Frontieres in Dagahley refugee camp. Although refugees arriving at Dadaab receive assistance from each of these organizations, aid is often not immediate due to overcrowding. Other relief organizations include Danish Refugee Agency (DRC), Norwegian Refugee Agency (NRC), Windle International, Lutheran World Federation, Center for Victims of Torture, 
In July 2011, due to a drought in Eastern Africa, over 1,000 people per day were arriving in need of assistance. The influx reportedly placed great strain on the resources, as the capacity of the camps was around 90,000, whereas the camps hosted 439,000 refugees in July 2011 according to the UNHCR. The number was predicted to increase to 500,000 by the end of 2011 according to estimates from Médecins Sans Frontières. Those population figures at the time made Dadaab the largest refugee camp in the world. According to the Lutheran World Federation, military operations in the conflict zones of southern Somalia and a scaling up of relief operations had by early December 2011 greatly reduced the movement of migrants into Dadaab. By 2024, more than 380,000 people lived at Dadaab.

==Demographics==

Before the UNHCR base was opened, the local town population traditionally consisted of nomadic ethnic Somali pastoralists, who were mainly camel and goat herders. However, since the 1990s, an influx of refugees has dramatically shifted the demographics of the area. Most of the people living in Dadaab have fled various conflicts in the broader Eastern Africa region. The majority have come as a consequence of the civil war in southern Somalia as well as due to droughts. According to Human Rights Watch, most of these displaced persons belong to the Bantu ethnic minority population as well as the Rahanweyn clan. Most of the latter have migrated from the southern Jubba Valley and the Gedo region, while the remainder have arrived from Kismayo, Mogadishu and Bardera.

In 2005, around 97% of registered refugees at Dadaab were Muslims from Somalia. The remainder mainly consisted of Muslims from the Somali Region (Ogaden) in Ethiopia, Ethiopian Christians and Sudanese Christians, totalling 4,000 individuals. While the Muslim minorities did not face any persecution, tensions with the Christian minorities were reportedly high.

According to the UNHCR, 80% of residents were women and children and 95% were Somalia nationals as of mid-2015. Of the registered refugee population from Somalia, the number of men and women is equal, but only 4% of the total population is over the age of sixty. Each year, thousands of children are born in the Dadaab camps. A number of adults have spent their entire lives as refugees in the complex.

In 2024, the camp was still over 97 percent Somali, but was also home to people from Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, South Sudan, Burundi, Eritrea and Ethiopia.

==Infrastructure==

The Dadaab refugee camp complex is so vast that it has been compared to a city, with urban features such as high population density, economic activity, and concentration of infrastructure. Like a typical urban area, Dadaab contains public service buildings such as schools and hospitals. The Ifo II camp, for example, includes religious spaces, a disability centre, police stations, graveyards, a bus station, and more. In addition, it is designed in a grid-like pattern, with the market on one side and a green belt at the centre of the many lines of tents. Despite these many amenities, however, the camps are crowded and have few signposts, making them confusing and difficult to navigate for new arrivals.

Refugees in Dadaab typically live in tents, which are made of plastic sheeting and distributed by the UNHCR. Although many residents have voluntarily repatriated, the camps are still overcrowded and exceed their intended capacity. By 2024, many residents had built homes to escape the heat of the sun, using mud, metal sheets, and tree branches. On average, four people live together in each household.

==Living conditions==
With camps filled to capacity, NGOs have worked to improve camp conditions. However, as most urban planners frequently lack the tools to contend with such complex issues, there have been few innovations to improve Dadaab. Opportunities remain such as upgrading and expansion processes for communications infrastructure, environmental management and design. Aside from the infrastructure, some of the factors affecting quality of life for refugees are health-care and diet, education, environment, security, and their economic and legal status.

===Education===

According to the Kenya Commissioner for Refugees, when migrants first began arriving in Dadaab town from Somalia, they were all educated. An assessment survey completed in 2011 found that access to education in Dadaab was considerably limited, restricting the ability of refugees at the centre to find jobs and become less reliant on aid organizations. Dadaab had only one secondary school; those who managed to be educated there could receive jobs working for aid agencies such as CARE, WFP, or GTZ that distribute resources to refugees. Those who were uneducated could pursue jobs in restaurants or helping load and unload trucks. Many chose other modes of subsistence. In 2011, only around 48% of children in Dadaab were enrolled in school.

In response, the Ministry of Education of Somalia announced that all high school students at the centre who were Somali citizens would be eligible for higher education scholarships. To further improve the education standards, a new European Union-funded project was launched in 2013. The initiative was earmarked for three years, with $4.6 million allocated toward its syllabus. It included new classrooms for all local schools, adult programs, girls&#x27; special education, and scholarships for elite students based on merit. 75% of the funds were set aside for refugees at the complex, and 25% were reserved for local constituencies in Lagdera and Fafi.

The camps schools had over 70,000 students in 2024. Schools are built of stone, and use long white tents for additional space. 

===Health care===

The German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) provides basic healthcare. On a typical day, around 1,800 refugees get outpatient treatment in hospitals inside the camps. Since 2015, Dadaab has had the largest solar-powered borehole in Africa, which is equipped with 278 solar panels and provides 16,000 residents of the complex with a daily average of about 280,000 litres of water.

Local health risks are complicated by overcrowding. They include diarrhea, pulmonary issues, fever, measles, acute jaundice syndrome, and cholera. Hepatitis E is also a potential issue, as the premises often have substandard sanitary facilities and unclean water.

One reason refugees arrive at the camps is displacement caused by natural disasters. By the end of 2011, more than 25% of residents at the complex had come as a result of a drought in Eastern Africa. Individuals arriving under these conditions were already malnourished, and once at the camps they could experience additional food scarcity. Although malnutrition is a contributing factor to high death rates among children, it has been observed that life expectancy at the complex is positively correlated with years of inhabitation.

Refugees receive food rations containing cereal, legumes, oil, and sugar from the World Food Programme (WFP). Due to overcrowding and lack of resources, they are not eligible for their initial rations until 12 days after arrival, on average. The rations are generally first distributed to children under the age of five because they are at the greatest health risk. Markets at each of the camps have fresh food for sale. However, due to limited income opportunities, most residents are unable to afford them. Some have used innovations such as multi-storey gardens to supplement rations. These require only basic supplies to construct and less water to maintain than normal gardens.

===Environment===

Deforestation has an effect on the lives of Dadaab&#x27;s residents. Although they are typically required to remain in the camp, residents often have to venture out in search of firewood and water. They are thus obliged to travel farther due to deforestation in nearby areas. This leaves women and girls vulnerable to violence as they journey to and from the complex.

In 2006, flooding severely affected the region. More than 2,000 homes at the Ifo camp were destroyed, forcing the relocation of more than 10,000 refugees. The sole access road to the camp and to the town was also cut off by the floods, impeding the delivery of essential supplies. Humanitarian agencies present in the area worked together to bring vital goods to the area.

In 2011, a drought in Eastern Africa caused a dramatic surge in the camps&#x27; population, placing greater strain on resources. By February 2012, aid agencies had shifted their emphasis to recovery efforts, including digging irrigation canals and distributing plant seeds. Long-term strategies by national governments in conjunction with development agencies are believed to offer the most sustainable results. Rainfall had also surpassed expectations and rivers were flowing again, improving the prospects of a good harvest in early 2012.

===Security===

Refugees at the UNHCR centre are not protected by the Government of Kenya (GOK). This has contributed to dangerous living conditions and outbreaks of violence. Because they are not protected under the law and are unable to possess a Kenyan national identification card, refugees are constantly at risk for arrest. Additionally, the Kenyan government screens ethnic Somalis and Ethiopians separately from other residents due to their different physical characteristics. A special category in local police documents is earmarked for &quot;Kenyan-Somalis&quot;.

While all refugees at the camp are at risk of violence, the UNHCR and CARE have identified women and children as being particularly vulnerable. They have created a department called &#x27;Vulnerable Women and Children&#x27; (VWC) to tackle the issues surrounding violence against these populations. As of August 2015, 60% of Dadaab&#x27;s total population is under the age of 18, and there are equal numbers of men and women, so women and children make up a significant portion of the camps&#x27; demographics. Specifically, the VWC department has identified orphans, widows, divorcees, rape victims and the disabled as the most vulnerable among all women and children. They offer counselling, additional food rations and supplies, and advice on how to earn an income and be financially self-sufficient. However, the effectiveness of these efforts has been questioned, and following an analysis by Dr. Aubone at St. Mary&#x27;s University, more research and data is required to identify the best ways to prevent gender-based violence at the complex.

===Economic and legal status===

Operations at the complex are financed by foreign donors. Despite this, public perception in Kenya is that refugees in general cause a strain on the economy. Research, however, has found that many refugees are economically self-sufficient for the most part.

In order to try to further increase the economic independence of refugees living in Dadaab, CARE has initiated microfinance programs, which are particularly important for encouraging women to start their own businesses. However, recent scholarly research has identified some flaws with microfinance, arguing that it has unintended negative consequences. Microfinance typically requires borrowers to pay very high interest rates, which can be detrimental to the poorest if any unexpected problems or crises arise. Living in a community with other economically disadvantaged individuals can also make it difficult to make a profit from a business venture since potential customers are not able to afford the service or product that is being sold. Others have argued that this is beneficial to individuals as a short-term economic solution, but that over the long-term it does not improve the economy as a whole. CARE is also working to create more inclusive markets that refugees are able to participate in to profit off of their newly acquired skills and business ventures.

==Repatriation and resettlement==

In November 2013, the Foreign Ministries of Somalia and Kenya and the UNHCR signed a tripartite agreement in Mogadishu paving the way for the voluntary repatriation of Somalia nationals living in Dadaab. Both governments also agreed to form a repatriation commission to coordinate the return of the refugees. This repatriation effort was in response to an attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, and belief that Al-Shabaab, the militant group responsible for the attack, was using Dadaab to recruit new members.

In 2014, the UNHCR assisted 3,562 refugees originating from Somalia to resettlement from Kenya. Slightly over 2,000 individuals returned to the Luuq, Baidoa and Kismayo districts in southern Somalia under the repatriation project. Despite these government endorsed repatriation schemes, the majority of the returnees have instead repatriated independently. By February 2014, around 80,000 to 100,000 residents had voluntarily repatriated to Somalia, significantly decreasing the base&#x27;s population.

Following the Garissa University College attack in April 2015, which resulted in 148 deaths, the Kenyan government asked the UNHCR to repatriate the remaining refugees to a designated area in Somalia within three months. The proposed closure was reportedly spurred by fear that Al-Shabaab was still recruiting members from Dadaab. Some individuals reported that the anxiety caused by the Kenyan government repeatedly threatening to shut down the camps was enough to convince them to leave. Without job availability or reliable access to resources, greater opportunities existed for them outside of Dadaab. Others questioned the government&#x27;s rationale for closing the camps, dismissing the claims of terrorist elements as baseless and refusing to depart. The three-month ultimatum passed without Dadaab being closed.

The Federal Government of Somalia and UNHCR confirmed that the repatriation would continue to be voluntary in accordance with the tripartite agreement, and that eight districts in Somalia from where most of the individuals had come had officially been designated as safe for repatriation. However, the Kenyan government has intermittently threatened to close down the Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps. In May 2016, it declared that it had already disbanded the local Department of Refugee Affairs as part of the move, citing national security interests as the primary reason behind the forced repatriations. The UNCHR regards the Kenyan authorities&#x27; unilateral declaration as irresponsible, and has sought to broker a deal to ensure that the complex remains open. The threat of closure by the Kenyan government is believed to be a ploy on its part to leverage more foreign donations. It also comes as the Somali federal authorities are challenging the Kenyan government at the International Court of Justice over demarcation of their respective territorial waters.

<text>Laurent Louis &quot;Larry&quot; Desjardins (March 15, 1923 – February 7, 2012) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as a member of the Manitoba legislature for most of the period from 1959 to 1988, and was a cabinet minister under New Democratic Premiers Edward Schreyer and Howard Pawley.

==Early life==
The son of Joseph A. Desjardins and Valentine Desautels, Desjardins was educated at &quot;St. Boniface College&quot;, &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s College&quot; and the &quot;Cincinnati College of Embalming&quot;. Desjardins played professional football with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. He was general manager of the St. Boniface Jr. Canadians and was a scout for the Montreal Canadiens. He was inducted into Manitoba’s sports hall of fame in 1990. He served in the Canadian navy during World War II. He worked as a funeral director, and was the President and Managing Director of &quot;Chapels, Ltd&quot;. He also joined the Knights of Columbus and the Canadian Council of Christian and Jews during the early years of his career. In 1944, he married Bernice McGuire.

Desjardins began his political career at the municipal level, serving as an alderman on the St. Boniface City Council from 1951 to 1954, and also serving on the St. Boniface Hospital Board for a number of years.

==Provincial career==
In the Manitoba general election of 1959, he was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the riding of St. Boniface as a Liberal-Progressive. This was the year of Progressive Conservative Premier Dufferin Roblin&#x27;s first majority win, and Desjardins joined ten other Liberal-Progressives in the official opposition.

In 1961, Desjardins emerged as one of the leading parliamentary supporters of government funding for private and denominational schools. A Roman Catholic and a native French-speaker, Desjardins regarded such funding as necessary for redressing anti-francophone legislation that had been pursued by previous Manitoba governments in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The Roblin government took some steps on this front, but the issue was still unresolved by the 1970s.

Despite the Roblin government&#x27;s popularity, Desjardins had little difficulty being returned in the elections of 1962 and 1966 (the Liberal-Progressives had changed their name to the Manitoba Liberal Party in 1961). In the 1969 election, Desjardins faced stronger than usual competition from his New Democratic opponent, Kam Gajdosik, but won by 4210 votes to 2656.

===Crossing the floor===
The 1969 election was a watershed in Manitoba politics, and resulted in a dramatic shift in Desjardins&#x27; career. Under Edward Schreyer&#x27;s leadership, the social-democratic NDP moved from third to first place, winning 28 seats out of 57 in the assembly. This was one short of a majority, and there was initial uncertainty as to which party or parties would form government. There was some consideration of an &quot;anti-socialist coalition&quot;, which would have brought together all parties except the NDP under the leadership of former Liberal leader Gildas Molgat. This, however, did not occur. The impasse was ended when Desjardins announced that he would offer parliamentary support to the NDP, and change his party affiliation to &quot;Liberal-Democrat&quot;.

Desjardins&#x27; change of affiliation was significant, and on some levels surprising. He had previously been known as an opponent of socialism, and the Franco-Manitoban community had not traditionally been supportive of the New Democratic Party before this time. Nevertheless, Desjardins formed an alliance with Schreyer (himself a centrist New Democrat), on the understanding that he would be able to continue to work in favour of denominational school funding on the government side.

In order to make sure this move was supported by his constituents, Desjardins organized a vote of confidence on this decision on July 8. Had he lost this vote, Desjardins would have resigned as MLA, and would have run as a Liberal-Democrat candidate in a subsequent by-election. About 1000 people showed up at the Louis Riel School gymnasium for the vote of confidence, and Desjardins received a standing ovation when he arrived in the hall. The vast majority of the attendees gave their support to Desjardins, with only 13 people opposing him. Desjardins became Schreyer&#x27;s legislative assistant in 1969, and formally joined the New Democratic Party in 1971.

On December 1, 1971, Desjardins was appointed Minister of Tourism, Recreation and Cultural Affairs. In July 1972, his efforts in support of denominational schools were dealt a setback when a government-sponsored bill to permit funding was defeated by a free vote in the legislature. (The Schreyer government did, however, make administrative agreements with certain private schools to provide them with access to public monies.)

===Defeat and return===
Given the lack of historical francophone support for the NDP in Manitoba, it was unclear if Desjardins would be re-elected in the provincial election of 1973, and his riding was targeted by a right-wing &quot;citizen&#x27;s&quot; group in the recently amalgamated city of Winnipeg (which included St. Boniface). This group convinced the Progressive Conservative Party to withdraw their candidate in St. Boniface to provide a single &quot;anti-socialist&quot; alternative to the NDP.

Desjardins&#x27; sole opponent in June 1973 was Liberal candidate J. Paul Marion. Following a very close race, Marion was declared the winner by a single vote (4301 to 4300). This result was disputed, however, and was subsequently overturned by the Controverted Elections Act. In December 1974, Desjardins defeated Marion in a by-election by over 600 votes.

===Later career===
In 1973, Schreyer&#x27;s New Democrats were re-elected, winning their first majority government. Desjardins had resigned from cabinet on January 28, 1974, during the ongoing controversy concerning the St. Boniface results, but that December 23, he was re-admitted to cabinet as Minister of Health and Social Development. On January 8, 1975, he was also given responsibility for the Manitoba Lotteries Act.

Desjardins was easily re-elected in the 1977 election, although Schreyer&#x27;s New Democrats were defeated provincially by the Progressive Conservatives under Sterling Lyon. Desjardins sat as a member of the opposition for the next four years.

The New Democrats returned to power in the 1981 provincial election under the leadership of Howard Pawley, and Desjardins was personally re-elected without difficulty. He was re-appointed to cabinet on November 30, 1981, serving as Minister of Health and Minister of Recreation and Sport, with responsibility for the Lotteries and Gaming Control Act. He was re-designated as Minister of Health with responsibility for Minister responsible for Sport, the Fitness and Amateur Sport Act, and the Boxing and Wrestling Commission Act and the Manitoba Lotteries Foundation Act.

During the 1980s, Desjardins was a prominent supporter of Howard Pawley&#x27;s efforts to expand and entrench French-language services in Manitoba.

On January 30, 1985, Desjardins was shifted to the Ministry of Urban Affairs. He was again re-elected without difficulty in the 1986 provincial election, and on April 17, 1986, he was reappointed Minister of Health and Sport (once again holding responsibility for the Boxing and Wrestling Commission Act and the Fitness and Amateur Sport Act).

Desjardins&#x27;s work for the interest of sport in Manitoba was recognized with his induction into the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame as a Multi-sport Builder in 1990.

===Retirement===
Desjardins resigned from his cabinet positions on February 10, 1988, after a Supreme Court ruling that provinces could not restrict a woman&#x27;s right to abortion, and announced that he would be leaving the legislature to take a job in the private sector. His seat was not formally declared vacant, but he stopped attending sessions of the legislature after this period. He then served as head of the Manitoba Health Organization until 1990.

Ironically, just as Desjardins had helped bring the NDP into government in 1969, his decision to leave the legislature in 1988 played a major role in the party&#x27;s unexpected fall from power. In his absence, the legislature was almost evenly divided between government and opposition members; as such, NDP backbencher Jim Walding&#x27;s decision to vote against his government&#x27;s budget was enough to defeat the Pawley ministry in the House. The NDP lost the subsequent 1988 Manitoba general election, and did not return to power until 1999.

During his time in the legislature, Desjardins was known as a personable figure; fellow New Democratic cabinet minister Russell Doern once called him a &quot;Rabelasian character&quot;. He was regarded as cautious and pragmatic, and was often more supportive of small-business interests than others in the New Democratic Party. Desjardins was a member of the federal Liberal Party for most, if not all of time in the provincial NDP. This practice is no longer possible; the federal NDP is now integrated with its provincial and territorial branches. He openly supported former Liberal MLA Lloyd Axworthy&#x27;s successful bid to enter the House of Commons of Canada in 1979.

During the 1990s, Desjardins led a policy review group which studied Manitoba&#x27;s lotteries system, and argued against the expansion of Manitoba&#x27;s casino economy. In 2002, he wrote an open letter on health-care reform, arguing that money alone would not resolve the problems within the system. In March 2003, he participated in a discussion on health-care funding at the Frontier Centre for Public Policy, in which he argued that Canada&#x27;s provinces should be permitted to enact user fees and expand the role of the private sector in health-care provision. He served as first president of the Western Canada Lottery Foundation.

Desjardins died at the Victoria Hospital in Winnipeg following a fall; he was 88 years old.

<text>Bullarebygden is the name of the area surrounding three connected lakes in Bohuslän in the southwestern part of Sweden. Another commonly used name for the same area is Bullaren. The landscape is a mixture of forests and meadows. Less than 2,000 people populate the rural area and by tradition farming is still common. Moose hunting and fishing are popular activities, both by people living there and by visitors. Bullaren is known for the annual bicycle race called &quot;Bullingrutten&quot; which is much like a huge feast for the locals, since no one is actually trying to win the actual race. The race takes the competitors around the center lake, while the nature at the same time brings beautiful views. Other events that take place is the annual market, as well as a live show made by &quot;Bullingen Jär´et igen&quot; at the local rustic site.

<text>The European Dream: How Europe&#x27;s Vision of the Future Is Quietly Eclipsing the American Dream is a book, by Jeremy Rifkin published on 19 August 2004, by Jeremy P. Tarcher Inc. Rifkin describes the emergence and evolution of the European Union over the past five decades, as well as key differences between European and North American values. He argues that the European Union, which he describes as the first truly postmodern governing body, is already an economic superpower rivaling the US, and has the potential to become a full world superpower.

==Overview==

According to Rifkin, the &quot;European Dream&quot; is one in which individuals find security not through individual accumulation of wealth, but through connectivity and respect for human rights. Rifkin&#x27;s concept of connectivity is displayed in the Dutch people&#x27;s quest for gezelligheid (meaning a cozy, inclusive environment), as well as the social market theories that have dominated French and German economic planning since WWII. Rifkin argues that this model is better-suited to 21st-century challenges than the &quot;American Dream&quot;.

Rifkin explains Europe&#x27;s opposition to the death penalty in a historical context; after losing so many lives to wars in the early and mid-20th century, Europe is opposed to state-sponsored killing as a matter of principle. He also discusses the European commitment to &quot;deep play&quot; – a notion which he claims is absent in the United States .

To support his thesis, Rifkin notes that in addition to the European Union having more people and a greater Gross Domestic Product than the US, the potential of the EU as an economic superpower is shown by having: 14/20 of the top banks in the world, 61 of the 140 of the top companies of the world as measure by the Global Fortune 500 (the US has 50), a homicide rate that is 1/4 than in the US, the 18 most developed countries in Europe all have more broadly distributed wealth than the US (the US ranks 24th in the world), higher lifespan than the US, higher literacy rates than the US, and higher quality of life than the US. Also, Europeans provide 47% of all the humanitarian aid in the world, and are seen by Rifkin as being more effective in global economic market regulation, evidenced by the fact that the EU stopped the merger of General Electric and Honeywell, fined Microsoft for anti-trust, and blocked genetically modified food despite US opposition.

Rifkin also draws a clear distinction between the &quot;hard power&quot; of the United States and the &quot;soft power&quot; of the European Union in the sphere of international relations. The United States has relied upon military strength and economic dominance to a greater degree than the EU. Conversely, Europe has combined its strength in the financial industry and economics generally with a commitment to humanitarian aid, economic assistance programs, trade deals, international institutions and patient, multilateral diplomacy.

For many countries around the world, this has resulted in widespread hostility towards American power and a relative willingness to cooperate with the European Union. Rifkin argues that &quot;soft power&quot; is thus able to win greater influence in the long term at considerably less expense. He notes however, that Europe has relied heavily upon American military assistance for its security, and that American post-war economic assistance was considerably important in the recovery of Western Europe and thereby indirectly expedited the establishment of the nascent EU institutions.

In South Korea this book made a huge sensation and enjoyed unexpected popularity, because Roh Moo-hyun, the former (16th, 2003–2008) Korean president, read the book, then inspired by the author&#x27;s idea and briefly planned his version in Asia, all of which happened just before his death.

<doc id="1015102" wikidata="Q364959" url="?curid=1015102" title="Adolfas Mekas">
<text>Adolfas Mekas (30 September 1925 – 31 May 2011) was a Lithuanian-born American filmmaker, writer, director, editor, actor and educator. With his brother Jonas Mekas, he founded the magazine &quot;Film Culture&quot;, as well as the Film-Makers&#x27; Cooperative and was associated with George Maciunas and the Fluxus art movement at its beginning. He made several short films, culminating in the feature &quot;Hallelujah the Hills&quot; in 1963, which was played at the Cannes Film Festival of that year and is now considered a classic of American film.

==Early life==
Mekas was born on a farm in Semeniškiai, Lithuania, the son of Elzbieta (Jašinskaitė) and Povilas Mekas. His sister was Elžbieta and brothers were Povilas, Petras, Kostas and Jonas. Adolfas was the youngest in the family.

At 14 years old, while still in Lithuania, Mekas saw his first film, &quot;Captain Blood&quot; starring Errol Flynn. In July 1944, Adolfas and his brother Jonas fled the approaching Red Army, going West in an attempt to reach neutral Switzerland, holding fabricated student papers from the University of Vienna. Their train was redirected and they spent eight months in a forced labor camp near Hamburg, and then entered several displaced persons camps. While in Germany, Adolfas attended classes in literature and theater arts and philosophy in Mainz, where he also wrote and published short stories, novels, and children&#x27;s books. Having been refused entry into Israel, New Zealand, and Canada, Mekas was sent as a refugee to the United States, where he arrived with his brother at the end of 1949.

==Early years in the United States==
In the spring of 1950 he purchased a 16mm Bolex camera and took up photography. At the same time, he wrote more than 50 scripts and attended film screenings at the Museum of Modern Art, Cinema 16, Thalia, Stanley, and other venues. He supported himself with a variety of jobs, including washing dishes and working as a foreman in a Castro Convertible factory. He was drafted into the United States Army during the Korean War, where he was assigned to the Signal Corps, and sailed for France in September 1951. On his return to the United States from Europe in 1953, he continued writing and filming and also began organizing the American Film House, along with his brother Jonas. Though the brothers approached many independent filmmakers, none were interested in collaborating on the project. They continued looking for a location in Manhattan for over a year, without success. In 1954 they abandoned the idea of the American Film House and with the money they had borrowed for the project started a film society, which they called the Film Forum. Mekas wrote of the period &quot;We showed films at public schools and at Carl Fischer Hall on 57th Street, wherever we could, until we went bankrupt in the middle of the second film series later in the year just in time to start &quot;Film Culture&quot; magazine, the first issue of which came out in December 1954.&quot;

&quot;Film Culture&quot; was an outlet for anyone who had something to say about film. P. Adams Sitney wrote of the project &quot;The brothers little realized at the time that they were actually elevating American culture to new heights, and marshaling a level of film criticism that has never been equaled since in our country.&quot; Adolfas served as editor of &quot;Film Culture&quot; until 1968.

Together with his brother in the early 50s, Adolfas wrote, directed and photographed a number of films that were never finished, including his first script in 1950 – &quot;Lost, Lost, Lost, Lost&quot;, which was later renamed &quot;Lost, Lost, Lost&quot;, and in 1951, &quot;Grand Street&quot; – both films documented the fate of displaced persons, old and new immigrants to Brooklyn. In 1953, together with Jonas he wrote, directed and edited a somber romance called &quot;Silent Journey&quot;, in which he played a principal role. In 1955, with Jonas and Edouard de Laurot, he began Film Essay, a spoof of American avant-garde film of that time. 

During those years, he made short trips to Canada to visit friends and find material for the novel he was writing, &quot;A Canadian Romance&quot;. In 1958 he left New York to spend a year in Oaxaca, Mexico. Living on $1 a day, he was free to write, and he wrote short stories, later published, and began longer works, notably his diaristic work &quot;George the Man&quot;. While in Mexico, he finished the screenplay for &quot;Hallelujah the Hills&quot;. In 1959 he returned to the States and to the daily struggle to live and create and express the needs of the growing movement of independent and avant-garde filmmakers in New York.

On 28 September 1960, Adolfas, Jonas and producer Lew Allen hosted a group of 20 independent filmmakers at the Producers Theatre on West 16th Street and by unanimous vote bound themselves into the free and open organization of the New American Cinema. The second meeting took place on September 30 at the Bleecker Street Cinema and the first draft of the statement of aims was read, discussed and approved, and later published in &quot;Film Culture&quot;. Subsequently, a third and fourth meeting took place, leading to the establishment in 1962 of the Film-makers&#x27; Co-op, a distribution organization for the dissemination of independent, experimental and avant-garde films. The New York group included, among others, Lionel Rogosin, Shirley Clarke, Robert Frank, Maya Deren, Peter Bogdanovich and Daniel Talbot.

==Middle years in the United States==
In 1961 Jonas began shooting &quot;Guns of the Trees&quot;. Mekas assisted him in all stages of production, writing and editing, and played one of the lead roles in the film. Other actors were Ben Carruthers, Frances Stillman and Argus Speare Juilliard. The controversial film was considered to be a &quot;poetic-political manifesto.&quot;

In 1963 Mekas&#x27;s film &quot;Hallelujah the Hills&quot; was the surprise hit of the Cannes Festival. Subsequently, it was invited to 27 film festivals, including the first New York Film Festival, the London Festival, the Montreal International Film Festival, the Mannheim Film Festival and the Bombay Film Festival; it won the Silver Sail at the Locarno Festival, was invited to a Command Screening for the Royal Family at Buckingham Palace and had a 15-week run at the Fifth Avenue cinema in New York. &quot;Time&quot; called it &quot;... the weirdest, wooziest, wackiest screen comedy of 1963.&quot; Jean-Luc Godard wrote in &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; &quot;&quot;Hallelujah&quot; proved clearly that Adolfas is someone to be reckoned with. He is a master in the field of pure invention, that is to say, in working dangerously – &#x27;without a net.&#x27; His film, made according to the good old principle – one idea for each shot – has the lovely scent of fresh ingenuity and crafty sweetness.&quot;

In 1964 Mekas was hired as post-production coordinator and editor of the independent comedy drama &quot;Goldstein&quot;, which was co-directed by Ben Manaster and Philip Kaufman. Mekas created a Jewish fable, edited as a fugue.

The same year Mekas edited sound and film footage taken by brother Jonas of a performance of &quot;The Brig&quot;, directed by Judith Malina. It was selected for the New York Film Festival, the London Festival, the Moscow Festival and others and took first prize at the Venice Festival in the documentary category. &quot;Variety&quot; described it as &quot;...one of the more remarkable films in the entire fest (NY Film Festival &#x27;64) is the Jonas and Adolfas Mekas film version of The Living Theatre&#x27;s &quot;The Brig&quot;. This filmed-on-the-stage version of a play...has a vitality as film which is unique and does in cinema terms what the seekers for new form in plays and novels are attempting.&quot;

In March 1964 he met Pola Chapelle, who became his wife. They were separated before their marriage by the production of his second feature film, &quot;The Double Barreled Detective Story&quot;, but never again during their long lifetime together. A replica nineteenth-century town was built just outside Johnstown, Pennsylvania, for the location of the film. The screenplay was based on a Mark Twain short story and the film starred Hurd Hatfield and Greta Thyssen. In spite of the performance of Hurd Hatfield, who played two parts in the film, there were problems with the production from the start, and Mekas never got to do a final cut. The producers took the film out of his hands and refused to release it. Nonetheless, with help from his friends, he was able to take a print to the Venice Film Festival of 1965. Gene Moskowitz in &quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;The Double Barreled Detective Story&quot; is authentic Mark Twain-esque with all the rustic humor of the 1880s...Mekas shows he has a way with parody and he gets disarmingly innocent performances from his cast.&quot;

In the same year Mekas directed Pola Chapelle in a short parody of Italian art films of the time, written by Peter Stone for the Broadway show &quot;Skyscraper&quot; which starred Julie Harris and Charles Nelson Reilly. Paul Sorvino played opposite Pola in the three-minute film clip which won praise from the critics. &quot;NY World Telegram&quot; described it as &quot;... a priceless film sequence satirizing Italian movies, for some of the heartiest laughs of the evening.&quot; Julius Novick wrote in &quot;Village Voice&quot; &quot;...there is a film sequence made by Adolfas Mekas: a very funny parody of an Italian movie, in Italian, complete with English subtitles and a projector that goes &#x27;zzzzzzz.&quot;

After his marriage in 1965 and for the rest of the 1960s, Adolfas wrote and hustled his scripts to agents and producers while working as an editor and/or post-production coordinator on various independent films, including the soft-core films of Joe Sarno, ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Wild World of Sports&quot;, and a few TV musicals. He was encouraged by Howard Hausman of the William Morris Agency, who had seen promise in &quot;Hallelujah the Hills&quot; and had made more than a few attempts at getting Mekas&#x27;s scripts into the hands of independent producers who would understand their style. Although three of his screenplays remained under consideration at Warner Brothers for a few years, none were ever produced.

In 1967, with a very tight budget, Adolfas made a 16mm black-and-white film from his own script, &quot;Windflowers, Elegy for a Draft Dodger&quot;. Dominique Noguez in &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; wrote &quot;...No frills, no Gipsy violin effects, no second movement of Aranjuez&#x27;s concerto – and it is thereby, poignant. It is the other side of Vietnam. The stubbornness of a silent young man who is running away...who simply wanted to live.&quot;

Shortly after the completion of &quot;Windflowers&quot;, Adolfas was contacted by Governor Harold E. Hughes of Iowa and his staff. After an interview with the Governor, he was given the job of creating promotional commercials for Hughes&#x27;s campaign for the United States Senate. He had no experience in the genre, but the challenge was enticing and he spent the summer of 1967 filming Hughes as he stumped the Iowa cornfields. He produced 35 TV commercials for Hughes&#x27;s election campaign, which was ultimately successful.

In 1968 Mekas wrote, directed, and starred in a 3-minute short entitled &quot;Interview with the Ambassador from Lapland&quot;. It was photographed by Jonas, with assistance from Shirley Clarke on sound. It was produced by Pola Chapelle. Noguez wrote &quot;In these 3 minutes Mekas is Swift, the horrible and admirable Swift of the &#x27;Modest Proposal.&#x27; One really must admit that Mekas has made the USA a bit less loathsome.&quot; (Note that Jonas sometimes claimed authorship of this short film, calling it the &quot;Time Life Vietnam Newsreel&quot;.)

In 1969 Mekas photographed and edited &quot;Fishes in Screaming Water&quot; a catfilm produced by Pola Chapelle for the First International CatFilm Festival – INTERCAT &#x27;69 – which she founded. For the 2nd International Catfilm Festival in 1973, he made the award-winning &quot;How to Draw A Cat&quot;.

He edited and subtitled &quot;Companeras and Companeros&quot; in 1970. This was a feature documentary, shot in Cuba by David and Barbara Stone. He edited three versions, one for United States release, one for European release, and one for Cuban release. The same year he cut and edited a film by Yoko Ono, 360 legs, in &quot;Up Your Leg.&quot;

In 1972, assisted by Pola Chapelle, Mekas completed an autobiographical film that documented his return to Lithuania after a 27-year absence. &quot;Going Home&quot; was invited to the New York Film Festival and many other festivals that year. It was part of the Conference on Visual Anthropology at Temple University in 1974 and was chosen by the Museum of Modern Art to be screened in its Anthropological Cinema exhibit, which toured internationally from 1975 to 1977.

==The Bard Years==

On 3 July 1971, Mekas received a teaching contract from Bard College. Soon after, he began organizing the new Film Department. At first denied tenure, he began a campaign believing that, if he were given tenure, the Film Department itself would be tenured. Armed with letters from colleagues in the film world and former students, he was successful, and in 1979 was granted tenure. Mekas, Chapelle, and their son Sean Mekas a upstate ny artist moved to the Hudson Valley, where he dedicated himself to teaching. Adolph&#x27;s, a nearby pub also known locally as &quot;Down The Road&quot;, became their after hours seminar room.

Only a very small budget was available to the Film Department, and the department continued as the &quot;orphan in the storm&quot; for many years. Mekas was not discouraged and, once a year, rented a truck and, together with Pola, visited film friends in New York City. They looked in their friends&#x27; labs for reels, split reels, cores, viewers, projectors and occasionally a moviola, which they took back to the Bard College Film Center. The lack of proper funding of the department worked to energize Mekas and his students in innovative ways. For instance, to raise funds for senior projects in film he held lunchtime auctions outside the dining commons on campus. The film department was small - more than three graduates was rare in the early years – but it was active and visible. During his years as chairman, Adolfas brought to the Bard Film Department some of the most noted independent and experimental filmmakers, including, Bruce Baillie, Ernie Gehr, Andrew Noren, Barry Gerson, Peter Hutton and Peggy Ahwesh and film historians and theorists Paul Arthur, P. Adams Sitney. John Pruitt, and guest faculty – friends including Ken Jacobs, Sidney Peterson, Shirley Clarke and George Kuchar. The Film Department grew in stature to become a well-respected film department.

P. Adams Sitney writes, &quot;what came to be known as the People&#x27;s Film Department was [Mekas&#x27;s] theater of hijinks; he surprised even himself with his enormous didactic gifts, his startling administrative skill and his unceasing fount of comic invention. His own fractured education and his nearly total disregard for academic decorum made him the ideal professor. Nowhere in the archive of film is there an invented character who could come near the brilliant, lovable, outrageous mischief that consistently turned his classrooms into arenas of magic. He taught generations how to see and act.&quot;

In the summer of 1971, while visiting Italy after his first trip back to the home he had left behind in Lithuania, Mekas had a vision of St. Tula. In Porto Santo Stefano, when he first saw her representation, it was clear that she was the Patron Saint of Cinema. He had no name for her at the time, but took a photo and displayed it in the Film Department. Shortly after, written under her photo in the Carriage House, was seen &quot;St. Tula loves your film. Even if no one else does.&quot; The name stuck and an altar was built. Sometime later the &quot;Sayings of St. Tula&quot; was published.

In addition to chairing the Film Department and teaching film courses until 2004, in 1981 he co-founded the Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts at Bard College and directed the MFA program from &#x27;83 to &#x27;89. He also taught film courses at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, and was a visiting lecturer at many institutions around the country.

Adolfas Mekas died in the early morning of 31 May 2011. By his bedside was his treatment for the fantasy docudrama he would make on the life and death by fire of the Neapolitan poet, philosopher, and so-called heretic Giordano Bruno. He called Bruno the first Beatnik.

<doc id="1015135" wikidata="Q1673374" url="?curid=1015135" title="Isaac Coles">
<text>Isaac Coles (March 2, 1747June 3, 1813) was an American planter, militia officer and politician from Virginia.

==Early life and education==
Coles was born in Richmond in the Colony of Virginia in 1747 to the former Mary Winston. His father, John Coles, had emigrated from Enniscorthy, Ireland, then became a merchant in first Hanover County. He moved somewhat south to Henrico County where he helped to settle Richmond at the falls of the James River, became colonel of the local militia, as well as speculated in land further south and west and helped found now-historic St. John&#x27;s Church. His maternal grandfather, Isaac Winston, for whom this boy and several relatives would be named, was from Hanover County. However, John Coles died months after this son&#x27;s birth. His eldest son John Coles inherited land in Albemarle County, and Issac and his middle brother Walter when they came of legal age inherited lands along the Staunton River in what was then Brunswick County but later became Halifax County. Meanwhile, Isaac was educated as befit his class, including at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg. Their sister Mary married Henry Tucker and had children, though his sister Sarah who married General George Muter had no children.

==Personal life==

Isaac Coles married twice. In 1771 he married Elizabeth Lightfoot, the daughter of one-term burgess William Lightfoot of Charles City County. Before her death a decade later, she bore three children, but only one survived to adulthood --Isaac Coles Jr.(1777-1814) -- who (briefly) inherited his father&#x27;s lands in Halifax County and also served in the Virginia House of Delegates. In January 1790, during his Congressional service in New York City, the widowed Isaac Coles met Catherine Thompson, who according to different accounts was the sister of a former member of the Queen&#x27;s Guards or a beauty descended from the Beekman family of New York City. Her sister Anne Thompson (1767-1848) married the elderly bachelor Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, who had been one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence and held many offices including Governor of Massachusetts, Congressman and vice president of the United States. In any event, Catherine Thompson Coles had several children and survived her husband by decades.Their eldest son Walter Coles became a congressman, as well as planter.

==Military service==

During the American Revolutionary War, Coles joined the Virginia militia and served as a colonel in Halifax County.

==Career==
When he reached legal age (21) and came into his inheritance, Coles became a planter in Halifax County. He built a mansion he called &quot;Springwood&quot; near Houston and Coles Ferry across the Staunton River. In 1785, Coles bought over 5,000 acres of land in Pittsylvania County, near Chatham, from Philip Lightfoot, a relative of his first wife. Over the next decade Coles developed this plantation, which he called &quot;Coles Hill&quot;. In 1787, Coles owned 3,896 acres of land, as well as 32 enslaved adults, 34 children, 24 horses and 97 other livestock, as well as 4 phaeton wheels in Halifax County.

In 1780, his brother Walter Coles (patriot) died, leaving his Halifax County plantations to his widow and children, and this Isaac Coles began his political career. After Halifax County voters elected Coles as one of their (part-time) representatives in the Virginia House of Delegates, he won re-election in 1781, then after a two-session break, continually won re-election between 1783 and 1787. Halifax County voters also elected Isaac Coles as one of their representatives to the Virginia Ratifying Convention, which assembled in June 1788. There, Coles opposed ratification of the United States Constitution, although his proved the minority view.

Nevertheless, Coles successfully ran for the United States House of Representatives. During his first term, from 1789 to 1791, he opposed adoption of the new Constitution, then also voted to abolish the slave trade. This did not prove a significant liability, for Coles won re-election to the House in 1792 and 1794, thus serving from March 4, 1793, to March 3, 1797. However, his marriage in New York City proved a political liability, as perhaps did his shift toward the Federalist party of his brother-in-law, for he lost to Matthew Clay, who had repeatedly reminded voters that the widower failed to remarry a Virginia woman.

In any event, concerned about malaria and other unhealthy conditions at his Halifax County plantation, and his eldest son having become an adult carrying on the family&#x27;s planter and political traditions, Coles moved his second family to his Pittsylvania County estate and sold the rest of his Halifax County property to resolve some financial difficulties. He continued to farm using enslaved labor.

==Death and legacy==

Coles died on his plantation, Coles Hill, in Pittsylvania County near Chatham, Virginia in 1813 and was buried in the family cemetery there. His son Isaac Coles Junior only survived him by a year. His son Walter Coles would also carry on the family&#x27;s political and planter traditions, and served in the House of Representatives as had his father.

A nephew, Isaac A. Coles (b. 1780 at Enniscorthy, Albemarle County and brother of future Illinois governor Edward Coles) served as personal secretary to Presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Madison during their administrations. Another nephew Isaac H. Coles served in the Virginia senate, representing Charlotte, Halifax and Prince Edward Counties.

==Elections==

*1789; Coles was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives unopposed.
*1793; Coles was re-elected unopposed.
*1795; Coles was re-elected with 36.76% of the vote, defeating Independents Simon C. McMahon and Matthew Clay.

<doc id="1015145" wikidata="Q947912" url="?curid=1015145" title="Fort Ében-Émael">
<text>Fort Eben-Emael (, ) is an inactive Belgian fortress located between Liège and Maastricht, on the Belgian-Dutch border, near the Albert Canal, outside the village of Ében-Émael. It was designed to defend Belgium from a German attack across the narrow belt of Dutch territory in the region. Constructed in 1931–1935, it was reputed to be impregnable and at the time, the largest in the world. 

The fort was neutralized by glider-borne German troops (85 men) on 10–11 May 1940 during the Second World War. This was the first strategic airborne operation using paratroopers ever attempted in military history. The action cleared the way for German ground forces to enter Belgium, unhindered by fire from Eben-Emael. While still the property of the Belgian Army, the fort however has been preserved as a museum and may be visited.

== Location ==
The fort is located along the Albert Canal where it runs through a deep cutting at the junction of the Belgian and Dutch borders, about northeast of Liège and about south of Maastricht. A huge excavation project was carried out in the 1920s to create the Caster cutting through Mount Saint Peter to keep the canal in Belgian territory. This created a natural defensive barrier that was augmented by the fort, at a location that had been recommended by Brialmont in the 19th century. Eben-Emael was the largest of four forts built in the 1930s as the Fortified Position of Liège I (&quot;Position Fortifiée de Liège I&quot; (PFL I)). From north to south, the new forts were Eben-Emael, Fort d&#x27;Aubin-Neufchâteau, Fort de Battice and Fort de Tancrémont. Tancrémont and Aubin-Neufchâteau are smaller than Eben-Emael and Battice. Several of the 19th century forts designed by General Henri Alexis Brialmont that encircled Liège were reconstructed and designated PFL II.

A great deal of the fort&#x27;s excavation work was carried out on the canal side, sheltered from view and a convenient location to load excavated spoil into barges to be taken away economically. The fort&#x27;s elevation above the canal also allowed for efficient interior drainage, making Eben-Emael drier than many of its sister fortifications.

== Description ==
Fort Eben-Emael was a greatly enlarged development of the original Belgian defence works designed by General Henri Alexis Brialmont before World War I. Even in its larger form, the fort comprised a relatively compact ensemble of gun turrets and observation posts, surrounded by a defended ditch. This was in contrast with French thinking for the contemporary Maginot Line fortifications, which were based on the dispersed &quot;fort palmé&quot; concept, with no clearly defined perimeter, a lesson learned from the experiences of French and Belgian forts in World War I. The new Belgian forts, while more conservative in design than the French &quot;ouvrages&quot;, included several new features as a result of World War I experience. The gun turrets were less closely grouped. Reinforced concrete was used in place of plain mass concrete, and its placement was done with greater care to avoid weak joints between pours. Ventilation was greatly improved, including an air filtration system for protection against gas attack, magazines were deeply buried and protected, and sanitary facilities and general living arrangements for the troops were given careful attention. Eben-Emael and Battice featured 120 mm and 75 mm guns, giving the fort the ability to bombard targets across a wide area of the eastern Liège region.

Fort Eben-Emael occupies a large hill just to the east of Eben-Emael village (now part of Bassenge) and bordering the Albert Canal. The irregularly-shaped fort is about in the east-west dimension, and about in the north-south dimension. It was more heavily armed than any other in the PFL I. In contrast to the other forts whose main weapons were in turrets, Eben-Emael&#x27;s main weapons were divided between turrets and casemates. The 60 mm, 75 mm and 120 mm guns were made by the Fonderie Royale des Canons de Belgique (F.R.C.) in the city of Liège. The artillery turrets were so well-designed and constructed the artillerists were not required to wear hearing protection when firing the guns.
* Block B.I – entrance block with two 60 mm anti-tank guns (F.R.C Modèle 1936) and machine guns.
* Blocks B.II, B.IV and B.VI – flanking casemates located around the perimeter ditch to take the ditch in enfilade with two 60 mm guns and machine guns.
* Block B.V – similar to II, IV and VI, with one 60 mm gun.
* Cupola 120 – one twin 120 mm gun (F.R.C Modèle 1931) turret, with a range of 17,5 km. There were also three dummy 120 mm turrets.
* Cupola Nord and Cupola Sud – each had one retractable turret with two 75 mm guns (F.R.C Modèle 1935), with a range of 10,5 km.
* Visé I and IÍ – each house three 75 mm guns, facing south.
* Maastricht I and II – each house three 75 mm guns, firing north in the direction of Maastricht.
* Canal Nord and Sud – were twinned blocks housing 60 mm guns and machine guns covering the canal. &#x27;Sud&#x27; was demolished when the canal was enlarged.
* &#x27;Mi-Nord and Sud&#x27; are machine gun blocks (&quot;mitrailleuses&quot;) in the main surface of the fort. They were crucial in defending the top of the fort.
* &#x27;Block O1&#x27; overlooks the canal and guarded the Lanaye locks. It housed a 60 mm gun and machine guns.
Underground galleries extend over beneath the hill, connecting the combat blocks and serving the underground barracks, power plant, ammunition magazines and other spaces. Fresh air was obtained from intake vents over the canal.

== Personnel ==
In 1940, Fort Eben-Emael was commanded by Major Jottrand. There were around 1,200 Belgian troops stationed at the fort, divided into three groups. The first group was permanently stationed at the fort and consisted of 200 technical personnel (e.g. doctors, cooks, weapon maintenance technicians, administration staff). The two other groups consisted of 500 artillerists each. In peacetime, one group would be stationed at the fort for one week, and the other group would be in reserve at the village of Wonck, about away. These two groups would change places every week.

Except for some of the officers and NCOs, most of the men were conscripts. The majority of these were reservists and were called up after the Invasion of Poland in 1939. Infantry training was poor, since the men were considered to be purely artillerists.

== 1940 ==

On 10 May 1940, 78 paratroopers of the German 7th &quot;Flieger&quot; (later 1st &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; Division) landed on the fortress with DFS 230 gliders, armed with special high explosives to attack the fortress and its guns. Most of the fort&#x27;s defenders were taken by complete surprise. Eben-Emael&#x27;s loss delivered a hard blow from which the Belgian Army could not recover.

== Present day ==
Fort Eben-Emael is now open to the public. While still military property, it is administered by the Association Fort Eben-Emael, which provides tours and activities.

<text>Phecda , also called Gamma Ursae Majoris (γ Ursae Majoris, abbreviated Gamma UMa, γ UMa), is a star in the constellation of Ursa Major. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. Based upon parallax measurements with the &quot;Hipparcos&quot; astrometry satellite, it is located at a distance of around from the Sun.

It is more familiar to most observers in the northern hemisphere as the lower-left star forming the bowl of the Big Dipper, together with Alpha Ursae Majoris (Dubhe, upper-right), Beta Ursae Majoris (Merak, lower-right) and Delta Ursae Majoris (Megrez, upper-left). Along with four other stars in this well-known asterism, Phecda forms a loose association of stars known as the Ursa Major moving group. Like the other stars in the group, it is a main sequence star, as the Sun is, although somewhat hotter, brighter and larger.

Phecda is located in relatively close physical proximity to the prominent Mizar–Alcor star system. The two are separated by an estimated distance of ; much closer than the two are from the Sun. The star Merak is separated from Phecda by .

==Nomenclature==

&quot;γ Ursae Majoris&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Gamma Ursae Majoris&quot;) is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation.

It bore the traditional names &quot;Phecda&quot; or &quot;Phad&quot;, derived from the Arabic phrase &quot;fakhth al-dubb&quot; (&#x27;thigh of the bear&#x27;). In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included &quot;Phecda&quot; for this star.

To the Hindus this star was known as &quot;Pulastya&quot;, one of the seven rishis.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Northern Dipper&quot;, refers to an asterism equivalent to the Big Dipper. Consequently, the Chinese name for Gamma Ursae Majoris itself is (, ) and (, ).

==Properties==
Phecda is an Ae star, which is surrounded by an envelope of gas that is adding emission lines to the spectrum of the star; hence the &#x27;e&#x27; suffix in the stellar classification of A0 Ve. It is 2.4 times more massive than the Sun and is 333 million years old. It rotates rapidly with a rotational velocity of 386 km/s at its equator, which causes it to have an oblate shape. The equatorial radius measures , while the polar radius measures . The effective temperature varies as well, from 6,750 K in the equator to 10,520 K in the poles.

Phecda is also an astrometric binary: the companion star regularly perturbs the Ae-type primary star, causing the primary to wobble around the barycenter. From this, an orbital period of 20.5 years has been calculated. The secondary star is a K-type main-sequence star that is 0.79 times as massive as the Sun, and with a surface temperature of .

<doc id="1015182" wikidata="Q8051745" url="?curid=1015182" title="Yellow House Artist Collective">
<text>The Yellow House at 57–59 Macleay Street, Potts Point, was an artists&#x27; collective that existed from 1970 through to the beginning of 1973 in Sydney, Australia. The collective was established by artist Martin Sharp on his return from London at the beginning of 1970. Initially operated as a space for the exhibition of his work, Sharp and filmmaker Albie Thoms expanded the facility in 1971 to incorporate input from a variety of artists and performers. They modelled it on Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s Yellow House at Arles and the Dutch artist&#x27;s partially realised dream of establishing an artists&#x27; community there. The British Arts Lab movement of the late 1960s was also an influence on Sharp, who was resident in London between 1966-9.

Many well-known artists contributed to the multi-media performance art space that may have been Australia&#x27;s first 24-hour-a-day ‘happening’. The canvas was the house itself and almost every wall, floor and ceiling became part of the gallery and performance space. The rooms of the house were inspired by Pop Art, Surrealism, Dada and Conceptualism. Overseas visitors to the Yellow House included members of the rock band Pink Floyd, Marty Feldman and David Litvinoff.

Apart from the exhibition of painting, drawing, sculpture and photography, there was also a puppet theatre, light shows, performance of plays and regular screening of films. These included a range of classic, avant-garde and modern works such Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí&#x27;s &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot;, Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot;, Phil Noyce&#x27;s &quot;Better to Reign in Hell&quot;, Leni Riefenstahl&#x27;s &quot;Olympia&quot; and Peter Weir&#x27;s &quot;Count Vim&#x27;s Last Exercise&quot;, as well as works by Albie Thoms, Bruce Petty, Mick Glasheen and Arthur and Corinne Cantrill.

In 1990 the Art Gallery of New South Wales staged an exhibition which comprised, in part, reconstruction of some of the rooms from the Yellow House. A retrospective history of the Yellow House was compiled by Johanna Mendelson in association with the exhibition. The original building survives, though it now houses a mix of residential and commercial development, including the Yellow restaurant.

<doc id="1015188" wikidata="Q5262313" url="?curid=1015188" title="Derek Robinson (trade unionist)">
<text>Derek Robinson (1927–2017) was a British trade unionist. Formerly a convenor and shop steward within car manufacturer British Leyland for much of the 1970s, he was commonly known as &quot;Red Robbo&quot; in the British press.

==Career==
Robinson was born in Cradley, then in Worcestershire and began work in the motor industry as an apprentice at the Austin Motor Company in Longbridge during the Second World War, training as a tool maker. He soon became a member of the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) and joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1951. He stood as a Communist candidate in four consecutive general elections in Birmingham, Northfield between 1966 and 1974.

British Leyland was the result of a series of mergers between different British motor vehicle manufacturers. By 1975, Robinson was the union convener of the Longbridge plant in Birmingham, having worked his way up from the shop floor to serve as the deputy of the previous convenor, Dick Etheridge, a fellow member of the Communist Party.

With his network of representatives in the 42 different Leyland plants around the country, he led a long-running campaign of strikes around the company, which he argued were in protest at mismanagement, leading 523 walkouts at Leyland&#x27;s Birmingham plant during a 30-month period. In 1975, British Leyland became bankrupt and was nationalised by the Government. In 1977, a new managing director, Michael Edwardes, was appointed. He aimed to find a resolution to the ongoing industrial disputes and turn the company around. Robinson, for his part, supported the development of the policy of &quot;participation&quot;, in which convenors and stewards would work together with company management.

Robinson had seen the idea of &quot;participation&quot; as central both to his political aims and to making British Leyland a success, stating: &quot;If we make Leyland successful, it will be a political victory. It will prove that ordinary working people have got the intelligence and determination to run industry&quot;.

During the 1970s union organisation in British Leyland was split between the largely Communist Party-oriented stewards under Etheridge, and later Robinson, at Longbridge, and a smaller number of Trotskyist stewards based at the more militant Cowley plant. Many of the individual workers, however, took a more militant line than that espoused by the CP officials. An article by Frank Hughes in &quot;Workers&#x27; Liberty&quot; suggests that Robinson, by supporting the introduction of the &quot;measured day work&quot; system in place of piecework and by encouraging the adoption of &quot;participation&quot;, in fact destroyed the relationship between stewards and the shop floor and left them unable to control unofficial strikes.

==Relationship with the press, and sacking==
The filmmaker Ken Loach suggested that Robinson was unfairly smeared by the press of the time; contrary to their depiction of him controlling strikes at will, Loach claimed, he in fact spent much of his time attempting to prevent unofficial strikes. This viewpoint was examined by Loach in part of an (untransmitted) documentary film series, &quot;Questions of Leadership&quot; (1983).

Margaret Thatcher later described Robinson in her memoirs as a &quot;notorious agitator&quot;. Many years later, Robinson commented &quot;The pressures were immense but were it not for the ideological understanding that I had, I could very well have ended up with a nervous breakdown&quot;.

A 2002 BBC documentary series by Peter Taylor revealed that in the late 1970s MI5 had been attempting to undermine Robinson through an agent they had placed amongst his union officials; Edwardes stated that he had been &quot;privileged to read minutes of meetings of the [...] joint committee of the Communist Party and our shop stewards&quot;, which had been passed to him via the Government.

Robinson was eventually sacked by BL in November 1979 for putting his name to a pamphlet that criticised the BL management, and refusing to withdraw his name from the pamphlet when asked to do so. A ballot on a proposed strike in sympathy with Robinson and against his dismissal was lost, with 14,000 votes against and only 600 in favour.

Taylor&#x27;s documentary suggested that this was a result of the MI5 agent&#x27;s activity, with Edwardes acknowledging that the removal of Robinson was in some ways necessary for the company&#x27;s preparations to bring the new Austin Metro into production. Longbridge was being substantially redeveloped and expanded for the new car, whose assembly was heavily automated in comparison to previous models and job losses would have been inevitable: &quot;It was planned only in the sense...well, the answer is &#x27;Yes&#x27;, from a strategic point of view we knew that we couldn’t have the Metro and him. Whether or not we wanted him to go, his actions made it inevitable that he would have to go&quot;.

==After British Leyland==
Robinson subsequently applied for several engineering jobs and for a position as an organiser for the AEU in the Midlands, but these were rejected. He became a sales representative for the &quot;Morning Star&quot; newspaper, worked as a tutor in trade union studies during the 1980s and 1990s, and was national chair of the Communist Party of Britain for a period in the 1990s.

<text>Ukrainian Canadians are Canadian citizens of Ukrainian descent or Ukrainian-born people who immigrated to Canada.

In the late 19th century, the first Ukrainian immigrants arrived in the east coast of Canada. They were primarily farmers and labourers who were looking for a better life and economic opportunities. Most settled in the western provinces of Canada, particularly in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. These provinces offered fertile land and economic opportunities for farming, which was a familiar occupation for most Ukrainians. Ukrainian immigrants were able to establish a strong community in Canada. They built churches, community centres, and cultural organizations to preserve their language and traditions. After 1920 many moved to urban Ontario.

During the early years of Ukrainian immigration to Canada, many immigrants faced discrimination and prejudice. Ukrainian immigrants were interned during World War I as a part of the confinement of those deemed to be &quot;enemy aliens.&quot; Between 1914 and 1920, thousands of Ukrainian-Canadians were interned in camps.

Today, Ukrainian-Canadians continue to be an important part of Canada&#x27;s cultural mosaic. They have made significant contributions to Canadian society and continue to preserve and celebrate their rich cultural heritage. In 2021, there were an estimated 1,258,635 persons of full or partial Ukrainian origin residing in Canada (the majority being Canadian-born citizens), making them Canada&#x27;s eleventh largest ethnic group and giving Canada the world&#x27;s third-largest Ukrainian population behind Ukraine itself and Russia. Self-identified Ukrainians are the plurality in several rural areas of Western Canada. According to the 2011 census, of the 1,251,170 who identified as Ukrainian, only 144,260 (or 11.5%) could speak the Ukrainian language (including the Canadian Ukrainian dialect).

==History==
===Unconfirmed settlement before 1891===
Minority opinions among historians of Ukrainians in Canada surround theories that a small number of Ukrainians settled in Canada before 1891. Most controversial is the claim that Ukrainians may have been infantrymen alongside Poles in the Swiss French “De Watteville&#x27;s Regiment” who fought for the British on the Niagara Peninsula during the War of 1812 – it has been theorized that Ukrainians were among those soldiers who decided to stay in Upper Canada (southern Ontario). Other Ukrainians supposedly arrived as part of other immigrant groups; it has been claimed that individual Ukrainian families may have settled in southern Manitoba in the mid- to late 1870s alongside block settlements of Mennonites and other Germans from the Russian Empire. &quot;Galicians&quot; are noted as being among the miners of the British Columbia gold rushes and figure prominently in some towns in that new province&#x27;s first census in 1871 (these may have been Poles and Belarusians as well as Ukrainians). Because there is so little definitive documentary evidence of individual Ukrainians among these three groups, they are not generally regarded as among the first Ukrainians in Canada.

===First wave: Settlers, 1891–1914===

During the nineteenth century the territory inhabited by Ukrainians in Europe was divided between the Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires. The Austrian crownlands of Galicia and Bukovina were home to many Ukrainian speakers. Austrian Galicia was one of the poorest and most overpopulated regions in Europe, and had experienced a series of blights and famines. Emigration on a large scale from Galicia to the Balkans (the north-south border region of and ) and even to Brazil was already underway by 1891.

The first wave of Ukrainian immigration to Canada began with Iwan (&quot;Ivan&quot;) Pylypow and Wasyl (&quot;Vasyl″&quot;) Eleniak, who arrived in 1891, and brought several families to settle in 1892. Pylypow helped found the Edna-Star Settlement east of Edmonton, the first and largest Ukrainian block settlement. However, it is Dr Josef Oleskow, along with Cyril Genik, who are considered responsible for the large Ukrainian Canadian population through their promotion of Canada as a destination for immigrants from western (Austrian-ruled) Ukraine in the late 1890s. Ukrainians from Central Ukraine, which was ruled by the Russian monarchy, also came to Canada – but in smaller numbers than those from Galicia and Bukovina. Approximately 170,000 Ukrainians from the Austro-Hungarian Empire arrived in Canada from September 1891 to August 1914.

Clifford Sifton, Canada&#x27;s Minister of the Interior from 1896 to 1905, also encouraged Ukrainians from Austria-Hungary to immigrate to Canada since he wanted new agricultural immigrants to populate Canada&#x27;s prairies. After retirement, Sifton defended the new Ukrainian and East European immigrants to Canada – who were not from the United Kingdom, the United States, Scandinavia, Iceland, France or Germany – by stating: 

This Ukrainian immigration to Canada was largely agrarian, and at first Ukrainian Canadians concentrated in distinct block settlements in the parkland belt of the prairie provinces: Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. While the Canadian Prairies are often compared to the steppes of Ukraine, the settlers came largely from Galicia and Bukovina – which are not steppe lands, but are semi-wooded areas in the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. This is why Ukrainians coming to Canada settled in the wooded aspen parklands – in an arch from Winnipeg and Stuartburn, Manitoba to Edmonton and Leduc, Alberta – rather than the open prairies further south. Furthermore, the semi-feudal nature of land ownership in the Austrian Empire meant that in the &quot;Old Country&quot; people had to pay the &quot;pan&quot; (landlord) for all their firewood and lumber for building. Upon arriving in Canada, the settlers often demanded wooded land from federal &quot;Dominion Lands Act&quot; registry officials so that they would be able to supply their own needs, even if this meant taking land that was less productive for crops. They also attached deep importance to settling near to family, people from nearby villages or other culturally similar groups, furthering the growth of the block settlements.

Fraternal and benevolent organizations established by these settlers include the Ukrainian Labour Farmer Temple Association (ULFTA, affiliated with the Communist Party of Canada), the Ukrainian Catholic Brotherhood (UCB, affiliated with the Ukrainian Catholic Church in Canada), and the Ukrainian Self- League (USRL, affiliated with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada). The ULFTA transformed itself into the Association of United Ukrainian Canadians in 1946, the UCB and USRL are member organizations of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress today.

By 1914, there were also growing communities of Ukrainian immigrants in eastern Canadian cities, such as Toronto, Montreal, Hamilton, and Windsor. Many of them arrived from the provinces of Podillia, Volhynia, Kyiv and Bessarabia in Russian-ruled Ukraine. In the early years of settlement, Ukrainian immigrants faced considerable amounts of discrimination at the hands of Northern European Canadians, an example of which was the internment.

===Internment (1914–1920)===


From 1914 to 1920, the political climate of the First World War allowed the Canadian Government to classify immigrants with Austro-Hungarian citizenship as &quot;aliens of enemy nationality&quot;. This classification, authorized by the August 1914 &quot;War Measures Act&quot;, permitted the government to legally compel thousands of Ukrainians in Canada to register with federal authorities. About 5,000 Ukrainian men, and some women and children, were interned at government camps and work sites. Although many Ukrainians were &quot;paroled&quot; into jobs for private companies by 1917, the internment continued until June 20, 1920 – almost a year after the Treaty of Versailles was signed by Canada on June 28, 1919.

There are some two dozen Ukrainian-specific plaques and memorials in Canada commemorating Canada&#x27;s first national internment operations, including several statues – on the fairgrounds of Canada&#x27;s National Ukrainian Festival south of Dauphin, Manitoba, the grounds of the Manitoba Legislative Building in Winnipeg; and at the locations of the former internment camps in Banff National Park, Alberta, Spirit Lake (La Ferme), Quebec, and Kapuskasing, Ontario. Most were placed by the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association (UCCLA) and its supporters. On August 24, 2005, Prime Minister Paul Martin recognized the Ukrainian Canadian internment as a &quot;dark chapter&quot; in Canadian history, and pledged $2.5 million to fund memorials and educational exhibits although that funding was never provided.

On May 9, 2008, following the 2005 passage of Inky Mark&#x27;s Bill C-331, the Government of Canada, under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, established a $10 million fund following several months of negotiation with the Ukrainian Canadian community&#x27;s representatives, including the UCCLA, Ukrainian Canadian Congress and Ukrainian Canadian Foundation of Taras Shevchenko (also known as the Shevchenko Foundation), establishing the Canadian First World War Internment Recognition Fund (CFWWIRF). The Endowment Council of the CFWWIRF uses the interest earned on that amount to fund projects that commemorate the experience of Ukrainians and other Europeans interned between 1914 and 1920. The funds are held in trust by the Shevchenko Foundation. Amongst the commemorative projects funded by the Endowment Council was the unveiling, simultaneously across Canada, of 115 bilingual plaques on August 24, 2014, recalling the 100th anniversary of the first implementation of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;. This was known as Project &quot;Сто&quot; ( &quot;Sto&quot;; meaning &quot;one hundred&quot;), and organized by the UCCLA.

===Second wave: Settlers, workers and professionals, 1923–1939===
In 1923, the Canadian government modified the &quot;Immigration Act&quot; to allow former subjects of the Austrian Empire to once again enter Canada – and Ukrainian immigration started anew. Ukrainians from western Volhynia – the Polesie and Wołyń Voivodeships (under Polish rule), and southern Bessarabia – also known as the Budjak (under Romanian rule), joined a new wave of emigrants from Polish-governed Galicia and Romanian-governed Bukovina. Around 70,000 Ukrainians from Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia arrived in Canada from 1923 to September 1939, although the flow decreased severely after 1930 due to the Great Depression.

Relatively little farmland remained unclaimed – the majority in the Peace River region of northwestern Alberta – and less than half of this group settled as farmers in the Prairie provinces. The majority became workers in the growing industrial centres of southern Ontario, the Montreal region and the Eastern Townships of Quebec; the mines, smelters and forests of northern Ontario; and the small heavy industries of urban western Canada. A few Ukrainian professionals and intellectuals were accepted into Canada at this time; they later became leaders in the Ukrainian Canadian community.

The second wave was heavily influenced by the struggle for Ukrainian independence during the Russian Civil War, and established two competing fraternal / benevolent organizations in Canada: the United Hetman Organization (UHO) in 1934 – which supported the idea of a Ukrainian &quot;Cossack kingdom&quot; led by Pavlo Skoropadskyi; and the rival Ukrainian National Federation (UNF) in 1932 – which supported the idea of an independent Ukrainian republic and politically supported the armed Ukrainian nationalist insurgency in Polish-occupied Western Ukraine. The UHO ceased to exist by 1960, while the UNF continued to expand and became the largest and most influential Ukrainian organization in Canada, spearheading the creation of the coordinating Ukrainian Canadian Committee (later Ukrainian Canadian Congress) during World War II.

===Third wave: Workers, professionals and political refugees, 1945–1980s===
From 1945 to 1952, most Ukrainians coming to Canada were political refugees and Displaced Persons. In the aftermath of the Second World War, many Ukrainians who had been displaced by the war began to immigrate to Canada. These immigrants were often refugees who had been forced to flee their homes and were looking for a safe haven. In the 1950s and 1960s, many Ukrainians who had been living in displaced persons camps in Europe were given the opportunity to immigrate to Canada. These immigrants were often highly skilled and educated, and they contributed to the growth and development of Canada&#x27;s economy.

Another wave of Ukrainian immigration occurred in the 1970s and 1980s, driven by political and economic factors. Many Ukrainians were dissatisfied with the Soviet regime and its policies, and were looking for greater freedoms and opportunities. Additionally, economic factors such as a shortage of jobs and a declining standard of living also played a role in driving migration.

During this period, many Ukrainian immigrants settled in urban areas, such as Toronto and Montreal, and found work in manufacturing and other industries. Despite facing some challenges with discrimination and prejudice, Ukrainian immigrants were able to establish strong communities in Canada and preserve their culture and heritage. The result was large Ukrainian communities in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. They established a number of new organizations and affiliated newspapers, women&#x27;s and youth groups, the most prominent of which was the Canadian League for the Liberation of Ukraine (renamed the League of Ukrainian Canadians after the collapse of the USSR in 1991). The League joined the Ukrainian Canadian Committee (later Ukrainian Canadian Congress) as a member organization in 1959.

===Fourth wave: Post-independence immigrants and recent refugees, 1991–present===
After the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, emigration from Ukraine increased. Rising levels of corruption, the dismantlement of some social services, low-paying employment as well as a loss of jobs in Ukraine, made immigration attractive once again. Many Ukrainians saw Canada as a land of opportunity and a place where they could build a better life for themselves and their families. The Canadian government also made it easier for Ukrainians to immigrate, offering various programs and initiatives designed to attract skilled workers and entrepreneurs. One of the most popular programs for Ukrainian immigrants was the Federal Skilled Worker Program, which allowed skilled workers to immigrate to Canada based on their education, work experience, language proficiency, and other factors. Many Ukrainians also immigrated to Canada through family sponsorship, as they had family members already living in Canada. In addition to economic opportunities, Ukrainians were also attracted to Canada&#x27;s multicultural society and the freedom and rights afforded to its citizens. Many Ukrainian immigrants have made significant contributions to Canadian society in various fields, including business, academia, politics, and the arts.

==Participation in the Canadian economy==
In the first half of the twentieth century, Ukrainian Canadians overwhelmingly earned their livings in primary industry – predominantly in agriculture, but also in mining, logging, construction, and the extension of the Canadian railway system; most importantly as labour in completing the transcontinental mainlines of the Canadian Northern Railway and Grand Trunk Pacific, both then nationalized and consolidated into the Canadian National Railway (CN). As agriculture became more mechanized and consolidated, male Ukrainian Canadians shifted into non-farm primary and secondary industry jobs, while women took jobs in domestic work and unskilled service industries. By 1971, only slightly more Ukrainian Canadians worked in agriculture than in the wider Canadian labour force. While they remain somewhat over-represented in agriculture today (7% versus 4% of all working Canadians) and underrepresented in elite managerial positions, Ukrainian Canadians have largely assimilated more into the broader economy, such that the Ukrainian Canadian workforce is now similar to that of Canada as a whole in nearly all other respects.

== Demography ==

=== Population ===
=== Language ===


In addition to the official English and French languages, many prairie public schools offer Ukrainian language education for children, including immersion programs. Generally second language students are taught the local Canadian Ukrainian dialect, rather than Standard Ukrainian.

The Canadian Ukrainian dialect is based on the Ukrainian spoken by the first wave of immigrants from the Austro-Hungarian Empire from 1891 to 1914. Because the Ukrainian language of this era had no words for such things as agricultural machinery other than a plow, words for wildlife or vegetation common to North America and uncommon in Ukraine, words related to the automobile or other self-propelled vehicles on roads, or words for internal combustion engine-powered or electrically-powered tools or home appliances of any kind, extensive borrowings and adaptations from Canadian English were independently made by Ukrainian settlers in the block settlements of the Prairies during their first decades in Canada. The decline of regular communication with relatives in Ukraine, especially the severe restrictions between 1939 and 1989, further isolated the Western Canadian Ukrainian dialect from an evolving Ukrainian language in Soviet Ukraine. Now, immigrants from Ukraine to Western Canada since 1991, speaking Ukrainian, find the Canadian Ukrainian dialect old-fashioned and sometimes strange, for modern Ukrainian no longer uses some of the expressions and vocabulary common to the Canadian dialect – or, in the case of the Canadian loan words and adaptations, never did use, because Standard Ukrainian either invented other terms or borrowed and adapted from other languages, such as French, German or Russian.

There are a few Ukrainian Catholic elementary schools in the Greater Toronto Area, including St. Demetrius Catholic Elementary school, St. Josaphat Catholic Elementary school, and Josef Cardinal Slipyj Elementary school, all in Etobicoke; as well as St. Sofia Catholic Elementary school in Mississauga.

=== Religion ===

Most Ukrainians who came to Canada from Galicia were Ukrainian Catholic and those from Bukovina were Ukrainian Orthodox. However, people of both churches faced a shortage of priests in Canada. The Ukrainian Catholic clergy came into conflict with the Roman Catholic hierarchy because they were not celibate and wanted a separate governing structure. At the time, the Russian Orthodox Church was the only Orthodox Christian church that operated in North America – because they had arrived first via Alaska, and traditionally Orthodox churches are territorially exclusive. However, Ukrainians in Canada were suspicious of being controlled from the Russia, first by the Tsarist government and later by the Soviets. Partially in response to this, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada was created as a wholly Ukrainian Canadian-controlled alternative. As well, the Ukrainian Catholic clergy were eventually given a separate structure from the Roman Church.
== Geographical distribution ==

=== Provinces &amp; territories ===
=== Cities ===

The provinces with the largest Ukrainian populations (single and multiple origins, 2006) are Ontario, 336,355; Alberta, 332,180; British Columbia, 197,265; Manitoba, 167,175; Saskatchewan 129,265; and Quebec, 31,955. In terms of proportion of the total population, the most Ukrainian provinces and territories are Manitoba (15%), Saskatchewan (13%), Alberta (10%), Yukon (5%), British Columbia (5%), and Ontario (3%).

The metropolitan regions with the largest Ukrainian populations (single and multiple origins, 2006) are: Edmonton, 144,620; Toronto, 122,510; Winnipeg, 110,335; Vancouver, 81,725; Calgary, 76,240; Saskatoon, 38,825; Hamilton, 27,080; Montreal, 26,150; Regina, 25,725; Ottawa-Gatineau, 21,520; St. Catharines-Niagara, 20,990; Thunder Bay, 17,620; Victoria, 15,020; Kelowna, 13,425; Oshawa, 12,555; London, 10,765; and Kitchener, 10,425.

The Census Divisions with the largest percentage of Ukrainians (single and multiple origins, 2006) are Manitoba #12 (25%), Alberta #10 (20%), Alberta #12 (19%), Manitoba #11 (15%), Manitoba #7 (13%), Manitoba #10 (12%), Manitoba #9 (12%), Manitoba #2 (10%).

There are a number of smaller rural communities in Western Canada with significant proportions of Ukrainians (single and multiple origins, 2016), including: Canora, Saskatchewan (52.6%), Speers, Saskatchewan (50%), Andrew, Alberta (48%), Mundare, Alberta (46%), Bradwell, Saskatchewan (41%), Vilna, Alberta (40%), Smoky Lake, Alberta (39%), Hafford, Saskatchewan (39%).
== Culture ==

Having been separated from Ukraine, Ukrainian Canadians have developed their own distinctive Ukrainian culture in Canada. To showcase their unique hybrid culture, Ukrainian Canadians have created institutions that showcase Ukrainian Canadian culture such as Edmonton&#x27;s Cheremosh and Shumka troupes – among the world&#x27;s elite Ukrainian dancers; or the Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Village – a living-history museum approximately 39 kilometres east of Edmonton where Ukrainian pioneer buildings are displayed along with extensive cultural exhibits.

Ukrainian Canadians have also contributed to Canadian culture as a whole. Actress and comedian Luba Goy, singer Gloria Kaye, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; host Alex Trebek, hockey executive Kyle Dubas, and painter William Kurelek, for example, are well known outside the Ukrainian community.

Perhaps one of the most lasting contributions Ukrainian Canadians have made to the wider culture of Canada is the concept of multiculturalism, which was promoted as early as 1963 by Senator Paul Yuzyk. During and after the debates surrounding the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, Ukrainian leaders, such as linguist Jaroslav Rudnyckyj, came out in force against the idea of English – French biculturalism, which they believed denied the contributions other peoples had made to Canada. Partly in response to this, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau shifted Canada to a policy of official multiculturalism; notably, the day after the Canadian Multiculturalism Policy of 1971 was officially announced, Trudeau gave a forceful speech in support of the policy at a national assembly of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress in Winnipeg.

===Architecture===

The Western Ukrainian agricultural settlers brought with them a style of folk architecture dominated by buildings made of unprocessed logs, which were much better suited to the wooded parkland belt rather than the &quot;bald prairie&quot;. The first house built – usually a &quot;burdei&quot; – used some sod; but was not exactly a sod hut, more like a dugout. The second house was often a white-washed and plastered log cabin usually with thatched roof, very similar to those seen in Ukraine. Barns, chicken coops, granaries, and so on were all built using the same techniques as the houses. By the 1930s most Ukrainian Canadians adopted the building styles of the North American mainstream including framed homes and barns built from commercial plans and using milled lumber.

Early churches, built by pioneer farmers rather than trained builders, were basically log cabins with a few added decorations. They aspired to the designs of Ukraine&#x27;s wooden churches, but were much more humble. Latter churches – such as the &quot;prairie cathedral&quot; style of Father Philip Ruh, using a mixture of Byzantine and Western influences – were much more decorative.

===Politics===
Many Ukrainians fled Russia, Poland, and later, the Soviet Union, to find freedom and a better life in Canada. For them Canada became &quot;an anti-Russia&quot;, where they could realize their political and economic ideas. Most Ukrainian Canadians were anti-Soviet, yet a minor group of Ukrainians has since 1910 supported Canadian socialism and contributed to the formation of the Communist Party of Canada, and formed a significant bloc within that group. They were also active in other Marxist organizations like the Ukrainian Labour Farmer Temple Association (ULFTA). Ukrainians also played a central role in the 1930s formation of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and the 1960s formation of the New Democratic Party. Ukrainians were a notable portion of the Mackenzie–Papineau Battalion of Canadians who volunteered and fought in the Spanish Civil War on the side of the leftist republican government against the nationalist troops of Generalísimo Francisco Franco.

Ukrainians in Canada at first supported the Liberal Party federally and provincially, a minority moved towards the 1930s protest parties of Social Credit and the CCF federally and provincially. The vocal anti-communism of John Diefenbaker in the 1950s led the more nationalist-minded to support the federal Progressive Conservatives. Today&#x27;s Ukrainian community tends to vote based on economic class interests and regional preferences.

The nationalist movement, through the Ukrainian National Federation and the Canadian League for the Liberation of Ukraine, was also an important part of the community. After Ukraine became independent Canada was one of the first nations to recognize Ukraine. From 1992 to 1994, Ukrainian Canadians were vital in fundraising to purchase a building in Ottawa to house the Embassy of Ukraine. As well, Canada has recognized the &quot;Holodomor&quot; (Ukrainian Famine) as an act of genocide. Canada also sent many observers to Ukraine during the disputed 2004 presidential election (see: Orange Revolution). The Government of Canada as well as its provincial governments – especially the Ukrainian strongholds in Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan – do much to support Ukraine&#x27;s economic and political development.

The Ukrainian Canadians had and have much more influence in Canadian society and policy than any other East European group; therefore they have had several prominent figures in top positions. Ray Hnatyshyn was the 24th Governor General of Canada (1990–1995) and the first Governor General of Ukrainian descent. Ukrainians were also elected leaders of Canada&#x27;s prairie provinces: Gary Filmon was Premier of Manitoba (1988–1999), and Roy Romanow was Premier of Saskatchewan (1991–2001).

Ed Stelmach became Premier of Alberta in 2006 as the third provincial premier of Ukrainian descent. He succeeded Ralph Klein (1992–2006), who had cabinets with many Ukrainian ministers. Stelmach himself is the grandson of Ukrainian immigrants and speaks fluent Ukrainian. He left office in October 2011.

Chrystia Freeland, who was Deputy Prime Minister of Canada from 2019 to 2024, is of Ukrainian descent and speaks Ukrainian. Rona Ambrose (née Chapchuk), who was Leader of the Opposition and interim Conservative party leader from 2015 to 2017, is of Ukrainian descent.

===Arts===

Canada is home to some very vibrant Ukrainian dance groups. Some examples of Ukrainian dance ensembles in Canada are the Ukrainian Shumka Dancers and the Cheremosh Ukrainian Dance Company in Edmonton, the &quot;Rusalka&quot; Ukrainian Dance Ensemble and &quot;Rozmai&quot; Ukrainian Dance Company in Winnipeg, the Svitanok Ukrainian Dance Ensemble in Ottawa, Saskatoon&#x27;s Rushnychok Ukrainian Folk Dance Association, and hundreds of other groups.

The Ukrainian Canadian Foundation of Taras Shevchenko provides some financial support for Ukrainian Canadian performing, literary and visual arts.

Ukrainians in general are noted for their elaborately decorated Easter Eggs or &quot;pysanky&quot;, and that is also true in Canada. The world&#x27;s second largest pysanka is in Vegreville, Alberta.

Ukrainian Canadian churches are also famous for their onion domes, which have elaborately painted murals on their interior, and for their iconostasis, or icon walls.

=== Literature and academia ===
Ukrainian Canadians have contributed to the literature of Canada and to the field of folklore.

Professor of folklore and Kule Chair Emerita at the University of Alberta, Natalie Kononenko, is well respected, and has made numerous contributions to her field. In 2023, Kononenko published a book entitled, &quot;Ukrainian Ritual on the Prairies: Growing a Ukrainian Canadian Identity.&quot;.

From British Columbia, Ukrainian Canadian author Danny Evanishen wrote and published more than eleven books retelling Ukrainian folk tales in English and sharing stories from his childhood and travel.

===Music===

Ukrainian Canadian musicians and groups include Randy Bachman, Luba, the Canadian Bandurist Capella, Ron Cahute, Rick Danko, Victor Mishalow, Chantal Kreviazuk, Gordie Johnson, &quot;Canadian Idol&quot; season 2 runner-up Theresa Sokyrka, Zirka from Toronto, D-Drifters from Winnipeg, Cheremshyna (ensemble) from Montreal, Sons of the Steppes (known as Сини степів or Syny Stepiv) from Montreal, Wasyl Kohut of the progressive rock band CANO, and Rushnychok from Montreal. The Edmonton-based group the Kubasonics focuses on a folk fusion of traditional Ukrainian music with modern touches.

===Food===

Cultural food is an important part of Ukrainian culture. Special foods used at Easter as well as Christmas are not made at any other time of the year. In fact on Christmas Eve (January 6 in the Gregorian calendar), a special twelve-dish meatless meal is served. The best-known foods are &quot;borshch&quot; (a vegetable soup, usually with beets), &quot;holobtsi&quot; (cabbage rolls), &quot;pyrohy&quot; or &quot;varenyky&quot; (dumplings often called &quot;perogies&quot;), and &quot;kovbasa&quot; (sausage).

Several items of Ukrainian food and culture have been enshrined with roadside attractions throughout the Prairie provinces. These are celebrated in the polka &quot;Giants of the Prairies&quot; by the Kubasonics. For example, the world&#x27;s largest perogy is in Glendon, Alberta, and the world&#x27;s biggest &quot;kovbasa&quot; is in Mundare, Alberta.

===Institutions===
There are a number of Ukrainian Canadian institutions, mostly affiliated with an umbrella organization or with a university, such as:

<text>Princess Esther Kamatari (born on 30 November 1951 in Bujumbura) is a writer, model, and exiled Burundian princess.

==Biography==
Esther Kamatari grew up in Burundi as a member of the royal family. She was educated at l&#x27;Ecole Nationale d&#x27;Administration du Burundi. Following independence in 1962, the king was overthrown in a military coup d&#x27;état, and the monarchy abolished in 1966. Kamatari fled the country in 1970 after her father&#x27;s assassination and settled in Paris, where she became the first African model in France. An attempt to re-establish the kingdom ended with the murder of King Ntare V in 1972. 

Burundi&#x27;s post-independence history has been dominated by tensions between the Hutu majority and the Tutsi minority. The civil war of the 1990s in Burundi and conflicts with neighbouring countries and the plight of thousands of child-victims of war led her to become involved with the Association of the People of Burundi in France. In Burundi she is known for her humanitarian work.

A peace brokered by South Africa has made elections possible in Burundi, and Esther Kamatari and her Abahuza party, which means &quot;bringing people together,&quot; will run on the platform of restoration of the monarchy.

== Marriage and children ==

Esther is married to a French man named Gilles. He is a doctor. They have two children, Jade and Arthur. Esther already had a daughter, Frédérique.

<doc id="1015211" wikidata="Q170249" url="?curid=1015211" title="Imaginations from the Other Side">
<text>Imaginations from the Other Side is the fifth studio album by the German power metal band Blind Guardian, released in 1995. The atmosphere of this album is darker in comparison to their earlier works, such as &quot;Battalions of Fear&quot;, which had a relatively light tone. This album also marks the first since &quot;Battalions of Fear&quot; which Kai Hansen (Helloween, Gamma Ray) did not contribute guest vocals or guitar, and the last album to feature vocalist Hansi Kürsch as bassist. It was also their first album to spawn singles, namely &quot;A Past and Future Secret&quot; and &quot;Bright Eyes&quot;. It was remastered and re-released on 15 June 2007, with bonus tracks and videos.

== Background and recording ==
Having experienced much success from their previous releases, &quot;Somewhere Far Beyond&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Tales&quot; (their first live album), the band was optimistic as they began writing for a new album once again. They soon noted how slow the process was advancing in comparison to previous writing sessions. For these new songs, personal standards were raised for which parts should make the cut, and ideas that weren&#x27;t satisfactory were therefore scrapped. However, after the first two songs, &quot;Imaginations from the Other Side&quot; and &quot;The Script for my Requiem&quot;, were demoed, the bandmembers were pleased by their exceptional quality, and once the next two songs, &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; and &quot;A Past and Future Secret&quot;, were written and added to the demo tape, they were confident in moving forward. Having not been satisfied with the production on their last two releases, &quot;Somewhere Far Beyond&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Tales&quot; (both produced by Kalle Trapp), Kürsch and Olbrich soon began searching for a new producer whilst traveling around Europe.

At their first stop, Denmark, they met producer Flemming Rasmussen, who had previously worked with bands Rainbow, Pretty Maids, and Metallica (a predominant influence on the band&#x27;s style). After visiting other studios throughout the summer, even ones in which albums of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones were recorded, the two felt that Rasmussen, who had been noticeably impressed by the demo tape, was the obvious choice. Despite him expecting more out of the band than they were previously accustomed to with Trapp (specifically in rhythm guitar and vocal performances), there was a noticeable chemistry between Rasmussen and the band. Rhythm guitarist Marcus Siepen would later reflect that he &quot;took [them] to a completely different level, in any aspect.&quot;

== Musical style ==
Following the footsteps of the band&#x27;s previous albums, &quot;Imaginations&quot; continued to stray from purely speed metal tendencies. In addition to fast guitar riffing, high-pitch distorted singing and extreme drumming (signature of speed metal) came catchy chord progressions and clean singing - components reminiscent of classic European folk music. Two tracks, &quot;A Past and Future Secret&quot; and &quot;Mordred&#x27;s Song&quot; (comparable to their previous album&#x27;s &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Song (In the Forest)&quot; by similar use of acoustic guitar), could even be considered to be a &quot;ballad&quot; and &quot;power ballad&quot;, respectively.

==Critical reception==

In 2005, &quot;Imaginations from the Other Side&quot; was ranked number 373 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

&quot;Loudwire&quot; named the album at second in their list &quot;Top 25 Power Metal Albums of All Time&quot; and &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; ranked it at third in a similar list.

== Track listing ==
All songs written by Hansi Kürsch and André Olbrich, except for where noted.


== Lyrical references ==
* &quot;Bright Eyes&quot;, according to an interview with Hansi, is his own story.
* According to an interview with Hansi, &quot;And the Story Ends&quot; is a continuation of &quot;Bright Eyes&quot;. This story continues on the band&#x27;s 10th studio album, Beyond the Red Mirror.
