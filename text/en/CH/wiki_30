<text>WBZY (105.7 FM) branded &quot;Z105.7&quot; is a commercial radio station licensed to Canton, Georgia, broadcasting a Spanish-language contemporary hits format. Owned by iHeartMedia, WBZY serves the Atlanta metropolitan area. The WBZY studios are located in Atlanta, while the station transmitter resides in the nearby suburb of Marietta. Besides a standard analog transmission, WBZY broadcasts over two HD Radio channels, and is available online via iHeartRadio. WBZY formerly repeated over the 32.25 digital subchannel of Atlanta television station WANN-CD (29 UHF, 32 PSIP) and previously did so on a number of occasions with sister station WBZW, the most recent lasting until November 5, 2021.

The station is also broadcast in HD radio.

==History==

===Country (1964–1993)===
From its sign-on in 1964 until 1991, the station was country music WCHK-FM on 105.5 MHz in Canton, Georgia, sister station to WCHK AM. In 1993, owner Cherokee Broadcasting received FCC approval to upgrade to class C2, with a much stronger signal and relocation of their transmitter site from the WTLK-TV 14 (now WPXA-TV) tower on Bear Mountain (near Lake Arrowhead southwest of Waleska) south-southeastward toward Atlanta. (This large broadcast tower in Holly Springs is next to Interstate 575 and old Georgia 5 at Rabbit Hill Road, and now only has mobile phone base stations about halfway up on it). This change also required a frequency shift of one channel to 105.7. Subsequently, this also allowed a later move by WMAX-FM (now sister station WRDG) on 105.3 from Carrollton east towards Atlanta, also having changed channels from 105.5. WCHK remained under local management for a little over a year afterward, briefly as &quot;North Metro&#x27;s K-105&quot; then as &quot;Country 105.7&quot;, and finally as &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s Classic Country 105.7&quot;, before owner Chuck McClure leased the station to iHeartMedia (which also owns 105.3), then known as Clear Channel Communications.

===News/talk (1993–2000)===
Under Clear Channel management, the station became WGST-FM and simulcast news/talk WGST, beginning October 1. In the mid-1990s, it again relocated its transmitter site southward, this time to the Sweat Mountain antenna farm in northeastern Cobb County (where several other stations are). In 2004, Clear Channel purchased the station and license outright from McClure, and still holds Canton as its city of license. A new WCHK-FM, located at 100.1 and also owned by McClure, was sold and changed to WNSY FM (oldies &quot;Sunny 100&quot;) in 1999, later becoming the market&#x27;s third hispanic FM station, but covering more toward northwest Georgia.

===Adult contemporary (2000–2002)===
On September 8, 2000, 105.7 broke away from the WGST simulcast, and became rock AC/classic rock &quot;Mix 105.7&quot; (WMXV), but did not stay that way for long due to lagging Arbitron ratings, despite adding a simulcast on 96.7 FM for the South Metro in October 2001 (which was dropped in April 2002).

===Oldies (2002–2005)===
On February 3, 2003, at 5pm, WMXV began stunting with all-Beatles music. At 12:10 pm on February 7, WMXV became WLCL &quot;Cool 105.7&quot; (the first song on &quot;Cool&quot; was &quot;You Keep Me Hanging On&quot; by The Supremes), playing 1960s and 1970s oldies music after Cox Radio dropped its 1950s and 1960s, &quot;Fox 97&quot; format from WFOX, which is now WSRV. At the time, WLCL was the only oldies station in Atlanta; however, the format was not as profitable to companies as it was in Fox 97&#x27;s prime.

===Spanish music (2005–2009)===
On May 2, 2005, the oldies format was ended, and WWVA moved its &quot;Viva&quot; format to the 105.7 frequency. During the flip, &quot;Viva&quot; warned listeners on the old 105.3 frequency to make the change to 105.7 that was played on a format loop. One week later, the station officially became WWVA-FM itself, swapping the WLCL callsign over to 105.3, where &quot;The Buzz&quot; format from 96.7 was put. Strangely, that left the hard modern rock of &quot;The Buzz&quot; with the WLCL call letters instead of its own WBZY-FM, which was unused for about two weeks. (&quot;The Buzz&quot; later merged into &quot;96 Rock&quot;, becoming &quot;Project 9-6-1&quot;, but remaining as WKLS).

&quot;Viva 105.7&quot; began simulcasting on 96.7 FM (formerly &quot;The Buzz&quot;) on May 17, and that station&#x27;s callsign was changed to WVWA (an anagram of WWVA, with the two middle letters transposed). Because 105.7 is north of Atlanta, 96.7 gave some coverage to the south. Its far-northeastern simulcast on WHEL (105.1 FM) in Helen, Georgia was sold in 2005, and has since changed formats to hot AC. On December 20, 2006, WVWA flipped formats to 94.9&#x27;s former adult contemporary format as &quot;96.7 Lite FM&quot; and took its WLTM callsign as well. (This station would flip about a year later to country music WWLG FM 96.7 &quot;The Legend&quot;, and later returned to simulcast this station).

===Rhythmic (2009–2012)===
On October 19, 2009, at 10am, the station dropped the Spanish format and again began simulcasting WGST AM 640, leading to speculation that it would return to its former news/talk format. At the same time, its website displayed a large question mark. However, the station would shift to a stunt featuring the possible return of AC station &quot;The Peach&quot;, which was formerly heard on 94.9 FM, and some Christmas music as &quot;Holiday 105.7&quot;. At 4 pm the same day, the format wheel would officially land on rhythmic AC as &quot;Groove 105.7&quot;. (The &quot;Viva&quot; format now airs on the HD2 channel of sister station 105.3 &quot;El Patron&quot;). The new station featured a mix of current and gold-based rhythmic hits targeting ages 25 to 54. Its primary competitors were a variety of Atlanta stations because of its unique approach: AC WSB-FM, rhythmic WSBB-FM, top-40 WWWQ and WSTR, urbans WVEE and WHTA, and urban ACs WALR-FM and WUMJ. For its kick-off, WWVA&#x27;s first songs were &quot;Into The Groove&quot; by Madonna, &quot;Shake Your Groove Thing&quot; by Peaches &amp; Herb, &quot;Groove Is In The Heart&quot; by Deee-Lite and &quot;Let&#x27;s Groove&quot; by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. Clear Channel, in turn, merged WWVA&#x27;s format into WBZY&#x27;s, giving Atlanta a hybrid regional Mexican and Spanish AC outlet at the latter. On January 11, 2010, the nationally syndicated morning drive-time &quot;Elvis Duran and the Morning Show&quot; premiered on the station. Duran previously did evenings in Atlanta with sidekick &quot;Hot Henrietta&quot; at Z-93 during the late 1980s.

The station briefly aired &quot;Streetz 102.9&quot; on its HD-2 channel, in order to satisfy a legal fiction so that it could be broadcast on W275BK FM 102.9. A lawsuit regarding the owners of that broadcast translator quickly ensued, and W275BK is now assigned to WAMJ. Since the end of March, the station is now also simulcast on WANN-CD, a low-power digital TV station on physical (RF) TV channel 29 in Atlanta. The main channel was heard on virtual channel 32.106, with Pride Radio (WWVA&#x27;s HD2 digital subchannel) formerly on 32.105. Clear Channel&#x27;s other Atlanta stations are also heard via DTV radio on WANN.

In May, WWVA&#x27;s music and playlist direction shifted to rhythmic Top 40 by adding more current rhythmic pop/R&amp;B/dance tracks. They also added a few mainstream pop songs, but later dropped them from the playlist. It also phased out the heavy amount of rhythmic gold product. This move was expected to benefit WWVA (as evidenced on their Facebook page at their website) as it stood to pick up listeners and carry the rhythmic Top 40 mantle from WBTS, who exited the rhythmic format after 11 years to become a simulcast of WSB on August 16. Despite the sudden shift to rhythmic Top 40 and primary signal coverage into Atlanta, there was some criticism over whether WWVA could actually replace WBTS, or fill the void for that matter, in terms of music, personalities, area promotion, and signal presence.

In efforts to fill in a signal shortcoming in southern portions of the market, the station re-added WWLG FM 96.7 as a simulcast on September 6. It also changed its positioner to &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s Party Station&quot;, which was last used at WWLG&#x27;s predecessor WLDA when it was &quot;Wild 96.7&quot;. Another move came from the hiring of former WBTS and WHTA DJ-mixer Mami Chula to The Groove&#x27;s lineup. On November 14, the station changed its name to &quot;WiLD 105.7 &amp; 96.7&quot;, retaining the &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s Party Station&quot; slogan. (The first song on &quot;WiLD&quot; was &quot;We R Who We R&quot; by Ke$ha). WWVA saw an increase in terms of listeners and ratings, mostly among the 18-34 audience and managed to carve its own niche by playing dance-pop and rhythmic tracks that their competitors usually avoid.

===Alternative rock (2012–2020)===
On August 29, 2012, sister station WKLS FM (&quot;Project 9-6-1&quot;) (now WWPW) flipped from its long-time rock format to Top 40, branded as &quot;Power 96-1&quot;. Because WiLD was under the same ownership of Power, and with nearly identical formats, it was likely the two formats would merge, with 105.7/96.7 flipping to a new format after Labor Day. A change was also likely due to the station&#x27;s program director being released days before the change, but on August 30, it was announced that WWVA would retain their rhythmic format, but tweaked its direction towards more hip-hop tracks and less emphasis on dance under its new PD (Rick Vaughn) for both WWVA and WWPW.

However, by March 2013, due to the launch of Power, the move of &quot;Elvis Duran and the Morning Show&quot; to WWPW, and a lack of promotion, ratings had tumbled from a mid-3 share to a 1.8 share, among the lowest-rated commercial music radio stations in the area. Therefore, on March 28, at 11am, with little warning, after playing &quot;Rosa Parks&quot; by Atlanta hip hop group OutKast, WWVA/WWLG went into a stunt loop consisting of R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot; and &quot;Radio Song&quot;. One hour later, WWVA/WWLG launched an alternative rock format, branded as &quot;Radio 105.7&quot;, with the first song being &quot;It&#x27;s the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)&quot; by R.E.M. (from nearby Athens, Georgia). This filled the hole left by 99X when it flipped to active rock in September 2012 and adult album alternative WZGC (&quot;92.9 Dave FM&quot;) flipping to sports talk the following month.

The two stations&#x27; broadcast callsigns were changed to WRDA and WRDG, respectively, on April 11, and the &quot;Wild&quot; format moved to WWPW FM 96.1 HD2, replacing the &quot;Project 9-6-1&quot; format that was eliminated from analog and HD1 by Wild&#x27;s near-clone &quot;Power 96-1&quot;.

On November 11, 2016, WRDG dropped its simulcast of WRDA and flipped to urban; however, WRDA retained the alternative format. On December 5, 2017, WRDA rebranded as &quot;Alt 105-7&quot;, to align itself with other iHeartMedia-owned alternative outlets.

===Spanish music (2020–present)===
On April 20, 2020, at midnight, after playing &quot;Novocaine&quot; by The Unlikely Candidates, WRDA flipped back to a Spanish-language CHR format as &quot;Z105.7&quot; (the first song played was &quot;Fantasía&quot; by Ozuna), initially as a simulcast of WBZY (105.3 FM), where the format has been heard since October 2018. WBZY serves areas to the south and west of Atlanta, while WRDA covers the more populous northern and eastern portions of the market, as well as where the majority of the market&#x27;s Hispanic and Latino population resides. The simulcast would last until May 4, when WBZY adopted WRDG&#x27;s urban format. Both WBZY and WRDA had a 0.9 rating in the March 2020 Nielsen Audio ratings, which had just been released days prior to the flip. The WBZY call letters would move to 105.7 FM on May 11; in turn, the WRDA calls moved to 105.3 FM. On May 18, WBZY began simulcasting on WBZW (96.7 FM) once again, but would then drop the simulcast again on November 5, 2021.

==HD radio and other outlets==
WBZY&#x27;s digital subchannel offers one different format:
*HD2: WBZY-HD2 is a Regional Mexican simulcast of sister station WBZW, which is used to cover the areas WBZW cannot reach.
*HD3: WBZY-HD3 airs Pride Radio, which plays dance music targeted towards the LGBT community

WBZY&#x27;s main channel was also heard on DTV radio via digital low-power TV station WANN-CD 29, on virtual channel 32.23, with the former WiLD format on 32.25.

<text>Stanisław Łojasiewicz (9 October 1926 – 14 November 2002) was a Polish mathematician.

==Biography==
At the end of the 1950s, he solved the problem of distribution division by analytic functions, introducing the %C5%81ojasiewicz inequality. Its solution opened the road to important results in the new theory of partial differential equations. The method established by 
Łojasiewicz led him to advance the theory of semianalytic sets, which opened an important chapter in modern analysis.

==Commemoration==
The &quot;Łojasiewicz Lectures&quot; are a series of annual lectures in mathematics given at the Jagiellonian University in honour of Łojasiewicz.

<doc id="1018155" wikidata="Q1757803" url="?curid=1018155" title="Vib-Ribbon">
<text>(stylized vib-ribbon) is a 1999 rhythm video game developed by NanaOn-Sha and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. The game came out in Japan on December 9, 1999 and in Europe on September 1, 2000, but was never released for the PlayStation in North America; it was re-released on the PlayStation 3 via PlayStation Network in October 2014, which finally brought the game to North America in addition to Japan and Europe. NanaOn-Sha had previously developed the &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot; series of games for Sony.

The game was initially commissioned as an advertisement for the Mercedes-Benz A-Class car. After design issues surfaced with the car and the ad plan was dropped, development continued as a stand-alone game. Masaya Matsuura returned to lead &quot;Vib-Ribbon&quot;. The game&#x27;s software loads into the console&#x27;s RAM, allowing the player to remove the game disc and insert music CDs to play custom levels; the game can generate a unique level from any track on a standard audio CD. The graphics for &quot;Vib-Ribbon&quot; are simple, consisting of straight, white vector lines forming crude, angular drawings of the level and the player character, named Vibri.

&quot;Vib-Ribbon&quot; has received generally positive reviews from critics, praising its minimalist visuals and innovative concept, and has garnered a cult following; though the game has also received criticism for its simplistic gameplay and design. It spawned two Japan-only follow-ups:&quot; Mojib-Ribbon&quot; (2003) and &quot;Vib-Ripple&quot; (2004).

==Gameplay==
&quot;Vib-Ribbon&quot; is a rhythm game in which players guide Vibri the rabbit across a line filled with obstacles tied in correspondence to the beat of the song, in a dimension called Music World. Stages contain four basic obstacles; block, loop, wave, and pit, which require players to press the L1, R1, X, or Down buttons respectively at the right time to navigate. Sometimes two obstacles will be merged, requiring the player to press two buttons at the same time (for example, a block and pit combination will require players to press L1 and Down together). Not pushing a button at the right time turns Vibri into a scribbled version of herself temporarily. Getting hit by obstacles too many times will degenerate Vibri from a rabbit into a frog, followed by a worm. Getting hit too many times while in worm form will end the game. Successful actions will help Vibri recover back to her higher forms, and clear enough obstacles in succession while in the rabbit form will evolve Vibri into Super Vibri, increasing the player&#x27;s score until Vibri is hit.

The player&#x27;s score is tallied via symbols during the gameplay and converted into points at the end of the run. Earning a high score will cause Vibri to sing a congratulatory song based on their position. The base game features six songs divided into bronze, silver, and gold courses containing two songs each.
Once the game is loaded onto the PlayStation, players can remove the disc and insert their own music CDs to play stages generated from its tracks. Players have the option of selecting a single track from the CD or playing all tracks consecutively. The difficulty varies depending on the intensity of the music.

== Development ==

&quot;Vib-Ribbon&quot; was developed by NanaOn-Sha with a team of eleven people including Masaya Matsuura as designer and producer. The project began shortly after the completion of &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot; (1996) when Mercedes-Benz contacted Sony to promote their then-upcoming A-Class car. Matsuura was motivated by the concept of music-generated stages after fans repeatedly asked him to create games of their preferred music genre. The first prototype used polygon graphics with the player character represented as a living automobile. The levels were initially represented as roads taking the shape of audio waveforms created by extant music. Mercedes-Benz dropped the concept after the car failed the moose test, resulting in the game&#x27;s development continuing as an original project. During the initial prototype&#x27;s development, Matsuura felt the levels were too similar for capturing only bass drum frequencies and was having difficulties with the levels synchronizing with the audio. This led him to stop developing the game after a year and a half in development. He decided to resume development after his team encouraged him to continue and one programmer discovered how to analyze CD audio using the PlayStation&#x27;s hardware.

&quot;Vib-Ribbon&quot; minimalistic wireframe visuals were chosen based on Matsuura&#x27;s love of early computer graphics, and the technical requirements of the game&#x27;s software being small enough to play within the PlayStation&#x27;s memory after its initial load. The gameplay was designed to use both hands on the controller based on Matsuura&#x27;s addiction to drumming and noted efficient drumming required using both left and right hands. The automatic music-generation concept was implemented when a programmer found a way to make the PlayStation analyze music CDs; the system looks eight seconds ahead of what the player is listening to and generates obstacles based on &quot;interesting&quot; frequency changes. Vibri&#x27;s voice was produced using a NTT Communications&#x27; Speech Synthesizer.

The soundtrack was composed by J-pop band Laugh and Peace, with vocals consisting of Toshiyuki Kageyama, Koichi Hirota, and Yoko Fujita. Matsuura instructed them to create music that fit the game&#x27;s world without giving players the impression that a particular style of music is associated with the game. Working with the band, Matsuura wanted a soundtrack that would encourage players to use their music CDs. Reluctance to associate the game with a music genre was a big part of why the game&#x27;s visuals are so color-neutral and simple. A soundtrack was released by King Records titled A second soundtrack was released on vinyl in 2020 by Minimum Records, featuring the unreleased song &quot;Rainbow&quot;.

==Release ==
&quot;Vib-Ribbon&quot; was released in Japan on December 9, 1999, and in PAL regions on August 30, 2000. The North American release was skipped as Sony Computer Entertainment America were reportedly unimpressed with the game&#x27;s simplistic graphics, causing fans to campaign for an American release, which Matsuura supported. In December 2000, Sony Magazine released a promotional picture book in Japan titled 

At E3 2014, &quot;Vib-Ribbon&quot; was referenced by Shawn Layden, the then-newly appointed CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment of America. Layden was not aware the game had not been released in America at the time, which resulted in people on the Internet interpreting the mention of the game as a hint of a North American release despite the company having no plans to do so. A group of Twitter users became displeased when there was no further mention of the game during the press conference. When Layden realized his mistake, he asked his team to work on perfecting a North American port for PlayStation Network. It was released on October 7 in North America with Layden writing an apology for the confusion. It was released in Japan the following day and in Europe on October 15.

==Reception==
&quot;Vib-Ribbon&quot; sold 100,000 units in Japan within its first week. The game was received positively by reviewers. 

When reviewing the visuals, &quot;GameSpot&quot; Jeff Gerstmann noted that the minimalistic style gives it a defining look and adds to the game&#x27;s appeal. The simplistic wireframe design was picked up by &quot;TechnologyTell&quot;, stating the graphics were &quot;impressive&quot; and &quot;minimalistic&quot;. &quot;Hyper&quot; reviewer, Cam Shea, felt the minimalistic visuals were refreshing due to other video games attempted to outdo one another with graphic fidelity. Shea praised the visual concept of evolution to show progress, and thought the game was sending a philosophical message of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;. Mike Wilcox of &quot;PlayStation Official Magazine – Australia,&quot; who bashed the visuals upon initial review, would later realize the visuals were intentional and not an insult to one&#x27;s hubris. However, &quot;PlayStation Official Magazine – UK&quot; Dan Mayers considered the visuals overall to be &quot;too strange to avoid gawping at&quot;.

&quot;Vib-Ribbon&quot; gameplay reception was mixed, with &quot;Hardcore Gamer&quot; calling the game &quot;cruel on the highest difficulty&quot;, and that the ability to use one&#x27;s own CDs in the game was &quot;flawed&quot; and &quot;ridiculous&quot; but &quot;deserving of a 2nd chance&quot;. &quot;TechnologyTell&quot; described the timing as &quot;inconsistent&quot; but &quot;refreshingly difficult&quot; and a &quot;great concept&quot;.

&quot;GameFan&quot; considered the game to have a &quot;solid soundtrack&quot;. 

==Legacy==
The game spawned a spinoff, &quot;Mojib-Ribbon&quot;, which focused on rap music and calligraphy; and a sequel, &quot;Vib-Ripple&quot;, which was similar to &quot;Vib-Ribbon&quot; but instead used digital images loaded into the game to generate the levels. Both were released in Japan only for the PlayStation 2. In 2012, the game was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art as part of its permanent collection of video games. In 2020, the game was celebrated among numerous other PlayStation franchises in the PlayStation 5 tech demo &quot;Astro&#x27;s Playroom&quot;, where a &quot;Vib-Ribbon&quot; stage is seen being played within the location &quot;Caching Caves&quot;.

<text>Andrey Ivanovich Yeryomenko (; Ukrainian: Андрій Іванович Єрьоменко; November 19, 1970) was a Soviet general during World War II and Marshal of the Soviet Union. During the war, Yeryomenko commanded the Southeastern Front (later renamed the Stalingrad Front) during the Battle of Stalingrad in summer 1942 and planned the successful defense of the city. He later commanded the armies responsible for the occupation of Western Hungary and Eastern Czechoslovakia in 1945.

==Military career==

===Draft and early service===

A Ukrainian, Yeryomenko was born in Markivka in Kharkov Governorate (today in Ukraine) to a peasant family, Yeryomenko was drafted into the Imperial Army in 1913, serving on the Southwest and Romanian Fronts during World War I. He joined the Red Army in 1918, where he served in the legendary Budyonny Cavalry (First Cavalry Army). He attended the Leningrad Cavalry School and then the Frunze Military Academy, graduating in 1935. In addition to his education, he was appointed to command of a regiment of cavalry in Dec. 1929, then a division in 1937, and then the 6th Cavalry Corps in 1938.
===World War II===
On Sept. 17, 1939, Yeryomenko led his 6th Cavalry Corps into eastern Poland as part of the operations agreed to between Germany and the Soviet Union under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. In general, this Soviet operation was not efficiently organized. Yeryomenko (whose Corps contained light tank and other motorized elements) was forced to request an emergency airlift of fuel so as to continue his advance. Despite these difficulties, the Corps kept moving, and Yeryomenko earned the nickname &quot;the Russian Guderian&quot;.

Yeryomenko was given command of the prestigious 1st Red Banner Far Eastern Army, deep in eastern Siberia, where he was serving at the outbreak of Operation Barbarossa on June 22, 1941.

Eight days after the invasion began, Yeryomenko was recalled to Moscow, where he was made the Acting Commander of the Soviet Western Front, two days after its original commander, General of the Army Dmitri Pavlov, was dismissed (and later convicted and executed) for incompetence. Yeryomenko was thrust into a very precarious position. The Nazi Blitzkrieg approach to warfare quickly dominated the Western Front, but Yeryomenko motivated the remaining troops, and halted the German offensive just outside Smolensk. During this vicious defensive Battle of Smolensk, Yeryomenko was wounded. Because of his injuries, he was transferred to command the newly created Bryansk Front.

In late August, Yeryomenko was ordered to launch counter-offensive operations along the Bryansk Front, primarily against Guderian&#x27;s Second Panzer Group as it began to move south to trap Kirponos&#x27; Southwestern Front around Kiev. Stavka, particularly Stalin and Shaposhnikov, seemed convinced that Yeryomenko could block or distract Guderian&#x27;s drive and save Kiev from encirclement. The counter-offensive failed to accomplish its objectives despite a valiant effort, leaving Bryansk Front severely weakened.

In October, the Germans launched Operation Typhoon, which was an offensive aimed at capturing Moscow. Most of Yeryomenko&#x27;s weakened forces (3rd, 13th and 50th Armies) were partially encircled by Oct. 8 although small units managed to escape for days or weeks following. On Oct. 13, Yeryomenko was once again wounded, this time severely. He was evacuated to a military hospital in Moscow, where he spent several weeks recovering. In January 1942, Yeryomenko was appointed commander of the 4th Shock Army, part of the Northwestern Front. During the Soviet Winter Counteroffensive, Yeryomenko&#x27;s army was part of the highly successful Toropets–Kholm Offensive, which liberated Toropets and much of the surrounding region, helping to create the Rzhev Salient, which became a major battlefield over the next 15 months. On Jan. 20, 1942, Yeryomenko was again wounded, this time in one leg, when German planes bombed his headquarters. Yeryomenko refused to evacuate to a hospital until the battle surrounding him finished.

====Battle of Stalingrad====

Yeryomenko&#x27;s performance in the winter offensives restored Stalin&#x27;s confidence, and he was given command of the Southeastern Front, on Aug. 1, 1942, where he proceeded to launch powerful counterattacks against the German offensive into the Caucasus, &quot;Fall Blau&quot;. Yeryomenko and Commissar Nikita Khrushchev planned the defense of Stalingrad, rallying and re-organizing men and equipment falling back to the city from the Don River and the steppes to the west. When one of his subordinates, Gen. Anton Lopatin, doubted if his 62nd Army would be able to defend Stalingrad, Yeryomenko replaced him with Lt. Gen. Vasily Chuikov as Army commander on Sept. 11, 1942. Chuikov and the 62nd Army went on to prove themselves as the defenders of the city, confirming Yeryomenko&#x27;s judgement. On Sept. 28, the Southeastern Front was renamed the Stalingrad Front.

During Operation Uranus, November 1942, Yeryomenko&#x27;s forces helped to surround the German 6th Army from the south, linking up with the northern penetration at Kalach-na-Donu. German General Erich von Manstein soon attempted to counterattack the Soviet forces and break through the line to relieve the surrounded Germans. Yeryomenko successfully repelled the attack, largely with the forces of the 2nd Guards Army along their fall-back positions on the Myshkova River.

====After Stalingrad====

On January 1, 1943, the Stalingrad Front was renamed Southern Front. After the end of the winter offensive, in March 1943, Yeryomenko was transferred north to the Kalinin Front, which remained relatively quiet until September, when Yeryomenko launched a small, but successful offensive. In December, Yeryomenko was once again sent south, this time to take command of the Separate Coastal Army, which was put together to retake Crimea, which was accomplished with assistance from Fyodor Tolbukhin&#x27;s 4th Ukrainian Front. In April, Yeryomenko once again was sent north, to command the 2nd Baltic Front. During the summer campaign, 2nd Baltic was very successful in crushing German opposition, and was able to capture Riga, helping to bottle up some 30 German divisions in Latvia. On March 26, 1945, Yeryomenko was transferred to the command of the 4th Ukrainian Front, the unit he controlled until the end of the war. Fourth Ukrainian was positioned in Eastern Hungary. Yeryomenko&#x27;s subsequent offensive helped capture the rest of Hungary, and paved the way for the Soviet liberation of Czechoslovakia. His army liberated many cities and towns in Czechoslovakia, most notably Ostrava. Today, many streets in the Czech Republic bear his name.

==Post-war career==
After the war, Yeryomenko had three major commands: in 1945–1946, he was the Commander in Chief of the Carpathian Military District, in 1946–1952 he was the Commander in Chief of the Western Siberian Military District, and in 1953–1958 he was the Commander in Chief of the North Caucasus Military District. On March 11, 1955, Yeryomenko, along with five other noteworthy commanders, was given the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union. He was made Inspector General for the Ministry of Defense in 1958, a largely ceremonial role that allowed him to retire that same year.

Yeryomenko died on November 19, 1970, aged 78. The urn containing his ashes is buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

<text>The Texas Instruments TI-74 Basicalc is a type of programmable calculator, which was released in 1985 to replace the Compact Computer 40. 

The TI-74&#x27;s architecture is descended from the never-released TI CC-40 Plus. TI utilized the CC-40 Plus ROM to create the TI-74&#x27;s BIOS; it removed the CC-40&#x27;s internal debugger to gain enough space to add calculator mode to the TI-74. The CC-40 Plus&#x27; cassette routines were reused in the TI-74, and the CC-40&#x27;s Hexbus port underwent a physical footprint change and was renamed to Dockbus. The Hexbus protocol is 100% compatible between the CC-40 and TI-74 with an adapter.

One variant, the TI-74S, has a blank faceplate instead of secondary functions to allow for customization (otherwise it is the same as the 74). Both models accepted customized ROM-modules. The TI-95, released at the same time, was a keystroke programmable descendant of the TI-59 and TI-66, with the same general form factor, but a two-line display (the second line was for function key definitions).

<text>The Avion II (originally referred to as the Zephyr (west wind) or the Éole II) was the second primitive aircraft designed by Clément Ader in 1893. Most sources agree that work on it was never completed, Ader abandoning it in favour of the Avion III that had a financial backer. Ader&#x27;s later claim that he flew the Avion II in August 1892 for a distance of 100 m at a field in Satory is not widely accepted.

==Design and development==
The name &quot;Avion&quot; was devised by Ader from Latin &quot;avis&quot; (&quot;bird&quot;) and became the origin of the word &quot;&quot;, the most common in French to designate an airplane (heavier-than-air aircraft). The first official text noting it is French patent no. 205 555 granted to Ader on April 19, 1890.

The engine developed for Avion II, called &quot;Zéphyr&quot; was a light steam engine driving a diameter 4-bladed propeller, in which steam was cooled through a condenser. It yielded at 480 rpm at a pressure of , weighing dry, and with full boiler and accessories.

<text>The British Rail Class 205 (3H) diesel-electric multiple units were built by BR at Eastleigh from 1957 to 1962, and in service for 47 years from BR Southern Region to Connex South Central and finally to the Southern franchise. They were eventually replaced by Class 171 Turbostar units.

==Description==
This class of unit was built in four different batches for use on different lines.

The Southern Region class 201 to 207 DEMUs are nicknamed &#x27;Thumpers&#x27; owing to the noise they made while in motion.

The first batch of units, numbered 1101–1118, was built in 1957 as two-car units and classified as 2H. They were built for services in Hampshire on the non-electrified routes between , and and between , and . The first units entered service in September 1957. However, owing to increasing passenger numbers, all eighteen units were strengthened to three cars in 1958 and 1969, with the addition of a centre trailer, and therefore were reclassified as 3H units. Upon the introduction of TOPS they were reclassified as Class 205. Some of these were later converted back to 2 car sets, but they retained their Class 205 designation.

The second batch of 2H units, numbered 1119–1122, was built as 2-car units in 1958. These units were built for services on the Marshlink Line from to Ashford, and associated branch lines. These units remained as two-car sets until 1979, and were reclassified as Class 204 upon the introduction of TOPS. In May 1979, following the disbandment of the four Class 206 units, they were strengthened to three cars and redesignated as Class 205s.

The third batch of units was built as three-car sets in 1959, and numbered 1123–1126. These units were built to supplement the first batch on services in Hampshire. Collectively, the first and third batches are often called &quot;Hampshire&quot; sets. The final batch of units, numbered 1127–1133, was built in 1962 as three car sets. These units have some detail differences from the earlier batches, such as a different internal layout, and smaller route indicators. They were built for services from to Salisbury, and other services in Berkshire. The final batch of units is sometimes referred to as &quot;Berkshire&quot; sets.

==Technical details==

Number 1129 was experimentally fitted with a Dorman 12QTCW V-12 diesel engine of 

==Operations==
The first examples of the class entered service in September 1957 after a month of testing. They were initially used on services linking Portsmouth and Southampton to Salisbury, as well as those between Southampton and Portsmouth Harbour and from Southampton to Alton/Andover. Journey times were around two-thirds of those required by the steam locomotives which the units replaced. The new services proved so popular that the class was temporarily taken off the route to Alton and Andover to provide extra capacity on the other lines prior to the fitting of a third carriage to the first 18 units.

The delivery of the second batch of four units saw the class introduced to the Marshlink Line between Ashford and Hastings. These units also ran on the Bexhill West Branch Line and the short line to , and a Sunday-only service on the Fawley Branch Line. All of these routes except for the Marshlink Line had been closed by 1967, by which time the route between Reading and Salisbury was also operated by the class. The units also operated on the to route from 1966 until its closure in 1972. Other routes served included the Steyning Line between and , which closed in 1967; the Cuckoo Line, which closed in 1968; the Lymington Branch Line, which was served by the units for two months in 1967 prior to its electrification; and some journeys on the Oxted Line, which was also served by the newer units. In 1973 some services from Portsmouth to and were converted to Class 205 operation.
Soon after introduction, an orange &quot;V&quot; shape was painted on the motor-coach in order to provide an early visual indication to station staff that there was no brake van at the other end of the unit. With the introduction of yellow warning panels the orange V was replaced by an inverted black triangle; this being extended at this time to all Southern Region two- and three-car multiple units.

The electrification of the line to in 1987 saw the majority of the class withdrawn. Those which survived largely operated on services from Ashford to Hastings and from London to Uckfield. The privatisation of British Rail in 1995/6 saw the surviving Class 205s, most of which now carried Network SouthEast livery, pass to the new Connex South Central franchise.

In 1966, unit number 1102 was used in the film &quot;The Great St. Trinian&#x27;s Train Robbery&quot;.
When Govia won the South Central franchise in 2001, a franchise commitment was to replace all Mark 1 rolling stock by 2005, as it did not meet modern health and safety requirements. Southern ordered &quot;Turbostar&quot; trains of and (later converted to Class 171) from 2003 onwards to replace the Class 205s. The final units, numbers 205001/009/033 were withdrawn in mid-December 2004.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 31 July 1989, unit 205101 collided with a van on the level crossing at .
*At 08:27 on 15 October 1994, the Cowden rail crash occurred, involving a head-on collision between two trains in heavy fog. The branch line is from Hurst Green junction near Oxted, south to Uckfield and at this point is single track. The northbound train failed to wait at the Ashurst loop and entered the single line section at Blackham junction against the red signal at OD58. The southbound train driver, unaware of the train coming towards him on the same track, pulled away from and the two units collided around south of the station. Units involved were 205029 with 205032 and 205018 with 205001.

<text>In Norse mythology, Snær (Old Norse Snærr, East Norse Sniō, Latin Nix, Nivis, English &quot;snow&quot;) is seemingly a personification of snow, appearing in extant text as an euhemerized legendary Scandinavian king.

==Icelandic tradition==
In the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;, Snow the Old (&quot;Snærr hinn gamli&quot;) is son of Frosti &#x27;frost&#x27; son of Kári. In the account called &quot;Hversu Noregr byggdist&quot; (&#x27;How Norway was inhabited&#x27;) in the &quot;Flatey Book&quot;, Snær is son of Jökul (&quot;Jǫkull&quot; &#x27;icicle, ice, glacier&#x27;) son of Kári. This Kári is lord of the wind and brother of Ægir or Hlér and Logi, all three being sons of the giant Fornjót. Fornjót was the king of &quot;Gotlandi, Kænlandi and Finnlandi&quot; and Snaer bears the title of a king too.

Snow&#x27;s son in &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; and &quot;Hversu&quot; is Þorri &#x27;frozen-snow&#x27;. The &quot;Hversu&quot; also gives Snow three daughters: Fön (&quot;Fǫnn&quot; &#x27;Snowdrift&#x27;), Drífa &#x27;snowfall&#x27;, and Mjöl (&quot;Mjǫll&quot;, &#x27;powdered snow&#x27;). &quot;Sturlaugs saga&quot; (section 22) brings in King Snow of Finmark and his daughter Mjöl who flies quickly through the air.

The &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; relates how Vanlandi the ruler of Sweden visited Snow and married his daughter Drífa, but left in the spring and did not return. Drífa bore Vanlandi a son called Vísbur. See Vanlandi for further details.

The &quot;Hversu&quot; also mentions in passing, when speaking of Snær&#x27;s distant descendant Halfdan the Old, that Snær&#x27;s life lasted three hundred years.

Snow&#x27;s son Thorri reigned as king after Snow, and had two sons named Nór and Gór and a daughter named Gói (&#x27;thin snow, track-snow&#x27;). See Nór to follow this lineage further.

==Danish tradition==
===Snow and Lǣ===
A legendary Danish king named Snow (&quot;Sniō&quot;) appears in the &quot;Annales Ryensis&quot;, section 14, and in the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot;, section 5, between the reigns of Helgi and Hrólf Kraki.

The &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; inserts the common folktale of the dog king after Helgi&#x27;s death. In this account King Hākun of Sweden sent a small dog to the Danes to take as their king but warned that whoever told him of the death of the dog would lose his life. One day, when larger dogs are fighting, the small dog sprang to the floor among them and was torn to death. Then Lǣ, the giant of Lǣsø̄ (Læsø), gave some advice on the matter to his herdsman Snow. (&quot;Lǣ&quot; is a Danish form of &quot;Hlér&quot;, a common name for Ægir who is Snow&#x27;s great-granduncle in the Norse tradition). Snow went to Hākun&#x27;s court and by riddling talk eventually got the king himself to say that the dog was dead. Snow was then appointed king of Denmark in place of the dog. Snow was a vicious, oppressive, and dishonest king. Snow sent his servant named Roth &#x27;Red&#x27;, whom he disliked, to the giant Lǣ to ask about how Snow will die, intending that Lǣ would kill Roth who would be unable to pass his tests. Roth passed and Lǣ gave Roth two gloves to take to Snow in answer. Snow put them on in an assembly and lice suddenly attacked him and ate him to death. Thereupon Helgi&#x27;s son Hrólf was made king.

The &quot;Annals of Lund&quot; tells the same tale, save that the king of Sweden is Adils which harmonizes with other tales in which Adils reigns over Sweden during the reigns of Helgi and his son Hrólf Kraki.
===Snow son of Sivald===
Saxo Grammaticus in his &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; inserts the reign of Snow much later in Danish history, telling of him in book VIII among kings who reigned after the death of Harald War-tooth. Here Snow is a rightful king of Denmark, son of King .

Of King Sivald Saxo tells nothing save that Sivald was son of Broder, son of King Jarmerik (who is actually Ermanaric King of the Ostrogoths changed by Saxo or one of his sources into a king of Denmark).

Saxo makes Snow a brave Viking during his father&#x27;s lifetime, who after gaining the crown crushed two champions named Eskil and Alkil and so regained Scania. Saxo then follows with a romantic tale of Snow&#x27;s love for the daughter of an unnamed King of Götaland whom Snow eventually defeated in a single combat with the terms that the winner would rule both Denmark and Götaland. But finding that the dead king&#x27;s daughter had been married to the king of Sweden, also unnamed here, Snow with the aid of an accomplice disguised as a beggar abducted her. Indecisive war with Sweden followed.

Then came a famine because of bad weather, this perhaps being an allegory having to do with Snow as a personification. Because of the lack of grain, Snow forbade making strong drink from grain and ordered abstinence from drinking alcohol on pain of death. Saxo follows with a tale of a lush who saved himself from death with clever excuses and finally convinced Snow to rescind those laws.

Then Saxo introduces Paul the Deacon&#x27;s account of the origin of the Lombards which he summarizes. Paul the Deacon and made the Lombards to have been originally from an island of Scandza in the far north. According to Saxo this famine and the departure of many Danes explained why in his own day much of the Danish land was overrun with forests in which stone piles alone showed that the land had once been cultivated fields.

Snow was succeeded by his son Biorn.

<doc id="1018172" wikidata="Q7624015" url="?curid=1018172" title="Stringfellow Barr">
<text>Stringfellow Barr (January 15, 1897 – February 3, 1982) was an American historian, author, and former president of St. John&#x27;s College in Annapolis, Maryland, where he, together with Scott Buchanan, instituted the Great Books curriculum.

==Career==
Barr was the editor of &quot;Virginia Quarterly Review&quot; from 1931 to 1937. He established and was president of the Foundation for World Government from 1948 to 1958. In the 1950s he taught classics at Rutgers University.

Barr wrote compact yet lucid historical surveys of three major periods of western history. Two of his books, &quot;The Will of Zeus&quot; and &quot;The Mask of Jove&quot; deal with the Greeks and Romans, respectively. He also wrote &quot;The Pilgrimage of Western Man&quot;, dealing with western history from the Renaissance through the early post-World War II era.

His nickname was &quot;Winkie.&quot;

In a 1951 &quot;New York Post&quot; column, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. mocked Barr as belonging to the &quot;solve-the-Russian-problem-by-giving-them-money school,&quot; along with Carey McWilliams and Thomas Emerson. Schlesinger said of them, &quot;None of these gentlemen is a Communist, but none of them objects very much to Communism. They are the Typhoid Marys of the left, bearing the germs of the infection even if not suffering obviously from the disease.&quot;

Barr&#x27;s views on the poor quality of American education and an American society driven by consumerist ideology are presented in ironic terms in &quot;Purely Academic&quot; (1958), a classic academic novel set in an anonymous Corn Belt university during the McCarthy period, as when a character in the story says that

:Many observers here and abroad note a kind of higher illiteracy in our college graduates. But we like it that way. In our cars we like horsepower; in our studies we like slow-motion and low-gear. In education the intellectually second-rate does not shock us. To insist on the first-rate would be arrogant. Anyhow, if we are so second-rate, how come we are the richest nation in recorded history and the fattest people on earth?

In 1959, Barr was one of a number of signatories to a petition asking the U. S. Congress to abolish the House Committee on Unamerican Activities. Other notable signatories included Eleanor Roosevelt and Reinhold Niebuhr.

Barr wrote &quot;The Kitchen Garden Book&quot; (New York: Viking Press, 1956) with Stella Standard. The &quot;Kitchen Garden&quot; is a manual on growing and cooking common vegetables.

&quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer Edmund Fuller called his 1958 novel, &quot;Purely Academic,&quot; &quot;bitterly hilarious,&quot; &quot;sadistically satirical,&quot; and &quot;funny and appalling.&quot;

<text>Scott Soames (; born 1945) is an American philosopher. He is a professor of philosophy at the University of Southern California (since 2004), and before that at Princeton University. He specializes in the philosophy of language and the history of analytic philosophy. He is well known for defending and expanding on the program in the philosophy of language started by Saul Kripke as well as being a major critic of two-dimensionalist theories of meaning.

==Life and career==
Scott Soames was born in 1945. He did his undergraduate work in philosophy at Stanford University and his graduate work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in linguistics and philosophy. He received his Ph.D. in philosophy from MIT in 1976.

Soames taught briefly at Yale University (from 1976 to 1980) and, then, from 1980 to 2004 at Princeton University. His departure from Princeton in 2004 was seen as a major loss at the philosophy department there. Gilbert Harman, one of Soames&#x27;s colleagues, was quoted at the time saying that &quot;He&#x27;s one of the most distinguished people we&#x27;ve got.&quot; Since 2004, he has been a professor at the University of Southern California, Department of Philosophy. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2010.

Soames is a public advocate and supporter of Donald Trump.

==Philosophical work==
Soames specializes in the philosophy of language and the history of analytic philosophy. He has published books and articles primarily on issues concerning truth, reference, and meaning. Fairly early in his career, he and Nathan Salmon edited a book entitled &quot;Propositions and Attitudes&quot; (1989), a collection of readings that investigates philosophical issues surrounding the nature of propositions. Later in his career, Soames has been known for expanding on the anti-descriptivist philosophy of language developed by Saul Kripke in &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot; (1972/1980)—see Soames&#x27;s &quot;Beyond Rigidity: The Unfinished Semantic Agenda of &#x27;Naming and Necessity&quot;&#x27; (2002). He is also a major critic of two-dimensionalist theories of semantics—see his &quot;Reference and Description: The Case against Two-Dimensionalism&quot; (2005).

&quot;Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century&quot; (2003), his two-volume history of analytic philosophy developed from a lecture course regularly given at Princeton, has been the subject of significant controversy among historians of analytic philosophy, with exchanges, often heated, on the &quot;Notre Dame Philosophical Review&quot;, Brian Weatherson&#x27;s blog, the journal &quot;The Philosophical Quarterly&quot;, and Soames&#x27;s own web page.

<text>Kazimierz Prószyński (4 April 1875 – 13 March 1945) was a Polish inventor active in the field of cinematography. He patented his first film camera, called Pleograph, before the Lumière brothers, and later went on to improve the cinema projector for the Gaumont company. He was also the inventor of the widely used first hand-held Aeroscope camera.

==Biography==
Born in Warsaw, Prószyński was educated in both Poland and Belgium, and was also active in France, England and the United States. He was the grandson of the photographer Stanisław Antoni Prószyński, who had been accused and sentenced by Congress Poland&#x27;s Imperial Russian authorities of placing Polish patriotic symbols in the background of photographs. He was also the son of Konrad Prószyński, an active Polish educator, writer and publisher.

In 1894, Kazimierz Prószyński built one of the first movie cameras. This Pleograph, or apparatus for taking photographs and projecting pictures, was built before the Lumière brothers lodged their patent. Prószyński also produced several films in Poland at the beginning of the 20th century as well as creating an improved film projector shutter, the first hand held film camera and devised a method of synchronizing sound and film tracks.

Kazimierz Prószyński spent a large part of his active life abroad. At the beginning of the 20th century, he was active in France and England as an inventor and producer of the Aeroscope (1909) camera, powered by compressed air. Filming with Aeroscope the cameraman did not have to turn the crank, as in all cameras of that time, so he had both hands on the camera to operate. This made it possible to film with a hand-held camera in most difficult circumstances and from airplanes. Compressed air was pumped into the camera system, before filming, with a simple special pump similar to the ones still used to pump bicycle tires. Hundreds of light and relatively compact Aeroscope cameras were used by British Army combat cameramen on the battlefields of World War I and later by newsreel cameramen until the late 1920s, when more modern spring cameras like Eyemo and later Bolex took over. Still, there are archival photographs of Aeroscope cameras being pumped by British combat cameramen as late as in 1940, at the beginning of World War II.

As soon as Poland regained its independence in November 1918, Prószyński returned with his English wife, Dorothy, and children Kazimierz junior and Irena. From the start it was difficult to find business partners for his invention. In 1922, he managed to establish a company Oko (Polish for: eye) to promote a simple amateur camera of his construction with the same name, which Prószyński intended to mass-produce for schools and the public. The economic crisis of the 1920s interrupted Kazimierz Prószyński&#x27;s plans. He was busy with other inventions, such as simple home film projectors and reading machines for the blind, but did not manage to mass-produce any of them.

During World War II and the German occupation of Poland, German Gestapo police discovered his workshop. They arrested Prószyński and his co-worker under the accusation of conspiracy. Released after 10 days, Prószyński did not manage to remove all suspicion. He was chased by Gestapo and had to move often to avoid arrest. On 25 August 1944, during the Warsaw Uprising, he was arrested.

Kazimierz Prószyński died in the Nazi concentration camp of Mauthausen in spring of 1945, as the prisoner number 129957, shortly before liberation.

Kazimierz Prószyński is regarded along with Bolesław Matuszewski and Jan Szczepanik as one of the most important pioneers of Polish cinema and cinematography.

<text>Charles Alfred Cripps, 1st Baron Parmoor, (3 October 1852 – 30 June 1941) was a British politician who crossed the floor from the Conservative to the Labour Party and was a strong supporter of the League of Nations and of Church of England causes.

==Family and early career==
Cripps was born in 1852 in West Ilsley, Berkshire, the third son of Henry William Cripps, a wealthy barrister and Queen&#x27;s Counsel from Berkshire. He attended Winchester College from 1866 and New College, Oxford, from 1871, both on scholarships, and won four first classes at Oxford. At the end of his undergraduate years he was awarded a Fellowship at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, which he held for six years.

He was called to the Bar from the Middle Temple in 1877 and went into practice as a barrister. In 1890 he became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel and in 1893 a Bencher of the Middle Temple. He was appointed as Attorney-General to the Prince of Wales in 1895, an appointment he retained until 1914 under two further Princes, the future George V in 1901 and the future Edward VIII in 1910; his personal service to the royal family was rewarded in 1908 with a knighthood in the Royal Victorian Order.

==Parliament==
Cripps later claimed to have been a supporter of the Liberal Party, but in deference to his die-hard Conservative father, he declined to get involved in politics. However he sided with the Unionists over the issue of home rule for Ireland and was elected as a Unionist to Parliament for Stroud in 1895, where he was a member of the South Africa Commission (investigating the Jameson Raid). He lost his seat in 1900, but soon returned in a by-election as MP for Stretford.

As a devout Anglican of the high church tradition, Cripps was very active in church affairs and was appointed Vicar-General of York in 1900 and of Canterbury in 1902. He again lost his seat in the Liberal landslide victory of 1906, but was elected for Wycombe (the constituency which included the family home) in 1910. He received a peerage from the Liberal government in 1914 and took the title Baron Parmoor, of Frieth in the County of Buckingham, from the family estate.

During the First World War he headed a committee determining compensation for damage caused by German air raids. Although not a judge, he was specially appointed to the Privy Council and to its Judicial Committee, and was among the members of it which ruled on the case of &quot;The Zamora&quot; (1916), concerning the owner&#x27;s rights on requisition of a neutral cargo ship, which he later considered, when sitting as a member of the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords on the government&#x27;s appeal concerning an owner&#x27;s entitlement to compensation for requisition of a London hotel, in the case of &quot;A-G v De Keyser&#x27;s Royal Hotel Ltd&quot; (1920).

==Great War==

Parmoor considered that his elevation to the peerage in a semi-judicial role had removed any previous political affiliations. The war had a profound effect on Parmoor&#x27;s political views, as he considered the decision to go to war a disaster. He opposed conscription and sympathised with conscientious objectors, who he thought were subject to excessive punishment.

In the aftermath of war, he became very active in international causes, setting up the &#x27;Fight the Famine Council&#x27; which had as its secondary objective the establishment of a League of Nations. The organisation was non-partisan but several trade unions and senior members of the Labour Party took part. When the National Church Assembly was established in 1920 to govern the Church of England, Parmoor was elected to the House of Laity and became its first chairman.

==Labour Party==
Parmoor approved of the statement on peace in the Labour Party&#x27;s 1923 election manifesto. After the election, with a Labour government in prospect, he received a letter from Ramsay MacDonald inviting him to join it. Parmoor wrote that he &quot;should rejoice in the formation of a Labour Government under your leadership&quot;. He was made Lord President of the Council and joint Leader of the House of Lords with Viscount Haldane, with the difficult job of piloting government legislation through a House in which it had minimal support. Although the government lost practically every vote, Parmoor was able to persuade the opposition that they would lose support by wrecking the whole legislative programme. Macdonald, who was serving as his own Foreign Secretary, also chose Parmoor as British representative to the Council of the League of Nations, and to its Assembly in September 1924.

After the end of the Labour government, Parmoor remained active in the House of Lords, and when Haldane died in 1928, was elected Leader of the Labour Peers. He served again as Lord President of the Council with special responsibility for League of Nations affairs in the second Labour government of 1929–1931, despite his advanced age of 76 at reappointment. He remained with the Labour Party when MacDonald formed the National Government in August 1931, disapproving of MacDonald&#x27;s actions on constitutional grounds, but stepped down as Leader of the Labour Peers at the dissolution of Parliament on 7 October.

==Family==
In 1881, Charles Cripps married Theresa Potter, daughter of the Radical MP Richard Potter and sister of Beatrice Webb, Baroness Passfield, and Catherine Courtney, Baroness Courtney of Penwith. 

Of the four sons of the marriage, the elder two, Alfred and Frederick, succeeded in turn to the peerage, the third son, Leonard, had a military career, and the youngest, Stafford, became a prominent political figure in the 1930s and 1940s. Charles&#x27; only daughter Ruth married the chemist, Sir Alfred Egerton.

Theresa died in 1893. In 1919, Lord Parmoor married Marian Ellis; there were no children of the marriage. Lord Parmoor died in June 1941, aged 88. His second wife died in July 1952.

<doc id="1018197" wikidata="Q6897884" url="?curid=1018197" title="Monadic Boolean algebra">
<text>In abstract algebra, a monadic Boolean algebra is an algebraic structure &quot;A&quot; with signature 

: of type 〈2,2,1,0,0,1〉,

where 〈&quot;A&quot;, ·, +, &#x27;, 0, 1〉 is a Boolean algebra.

The monadic/unary operator ∃ denotes the existential quantifier, which satisfies the identities (using the received prefix notation for ∃):
* 
* 
 is the &quot;existential closure&quot; of &quot;x&quot;. Dual to ∃ is the unary operator ∀, the universal quantifier, defined as . 

A monadic Boolean algebra has a dual definition and notation that take ∀ as primitive and ∃ as defined, so that . (Compare this with the definition of the dual Boolean algebra.) Hence, with this notation, an algebra &quot;A&quot; has signature , with 〈&quot;A&quot;, ·, +, &#x27;, 0, 1〉 a Boolean algebra, as before. Moreover, ∀ satisfies the following dualized version of the above identities:
# 
# .
 is the &quot;universal closure&quot; of &quot;x&quot;.

==Discussion==
Monadic Boolean algebras have an important connection to topology. If ∀ is interpreted as the interior operator of topology, (1)–(3) above plus the axiom ∀(∀&quot;x&quot;) = ∀&quot;x&quot; make up the axioms for an interior algebra. But ∀(∀&quot;x&quot;) = ∀&quot;x&quot; can be proved from (1)–(4). Moreover, an alternative axiomatization of monadic Boolean algebras consists of the (reinterpreted) axioms for an interior algebra, plus ∀(∀&quot;x&quot;)&#x27; = (∀&quot;x&quot;)&#x27; (Halmos 1962: 22). Hence monadic Boolean algebras are the semisimple interior/closure algebras such that:
*The universal (dually, existential) quantifier interprets the interior (closure) operator;
*All open (or closed) elements are also clopen.
A more concise axiomatization of monadic Boolean algebra is (1) and (2) above, plus ∀(&quot;x&quot;∨∀&quot;y&quot;) = ∀&quot;x&quot;∨∀&quot;y&quot; (Halmos 1962: 21). This axiomatization obscures the connection to topology.

Monadic Boolean algebras form a variety. They are to monadic predicate logic what Boolean algebras are to propositional logic, and what polyadic algebras are to first-order logic. Paul Halmos discovered monadic Boolean algebras while working on polyadic algebras; Halmos (1962) reprints the relevant papers. Halmos and Givant (1998) includes an undergraduate treatment of monadic Boolean algebra.

Monadic Boolean algebras also have an important connection to modal logic. The modal logic S5, viewed as a theory in &quot;S4&quot;, is a model of monadic Boolean algebras in the same way that S4 is a model of interior algebra. Likewise, monadic Boolean algebras supply the algebraic semantics for &quot;S5&quot;. Hence S5-algebra is a synonym for monadic Boolean algebra.

Memory area A000-FFFF was either available as user memory (if expansion was present), or would simply repeat the contents of 0000-1FFF

A few glitches are:
* POKE 1867,0 → would delete any user PASSWORD
* POKE PEEK(8027)+256*PEEK(8028),32 → would recover contents of MEMO after a RESET ALL
* POKE PEEK(8027)+256*PEEK(8028),26 → would hide contents of MEMO, much like a RESET ALL would do, but without losing the programs

The internal function library was programmed in BASIC itself and could be extracted with a BASIC decompiler.

Any function in the library can be executed from a regular BASIC program by using GOTO &quot;LIB0:NNNN&quot; where NNNN is the function number (e.g. 5010 for prime factorization). The command GOTO &quot;LIB0:0400&quot; executes a self-test program.

Characters 252 to 255 were user defined. They could be defined by issuing the command DEF CHR$(n)=&quot;HHHHHHHHHH&quot; where n ranges from 252 to 255 and the H&#x27;s are 10 hexadecimal digits (5 bytes). Every byte defines the pixel pattern for a column. Since a column is 7 pixels high, the least significant bit of every byte is ignored.

The CHR$(26) would activate a different character set for Katakana and Kanji characters. CHR$(27) would deactivate Kanji.

Via a serial cable the calculator could connect to a PC or to another Casio FX-850P, allowing the transfer to MEMO and stored programs.

<text>Grand Hotel is a musical in two acts with a book by Luther Davis, music and lyrics by Robert Wright and George Forrest, and additional music and lyrics by Maury Yeston.

Based on Vicki Baum&#x27;s 1929 novel, its eponymous spin-off play, &quot;Menschen im Hotel&quot; (People in a Hotel), and the subsequent 1932 MGM feature film, the musical focuses on events taking place over the course of a weekend in an elegant hotel in 1928 Berlin and the intersecting stories of the eccentric guests of the hotel, including a fading prima ballerina; a fatally ill Jewish bookkeeper, who wants to spend his final days living in luxury; a young, handsome, but destitute Baron; a cynical doctor; an honest businessman gone bad, and a typist dreaming of Hollywood success.

The show&#x27;s 1989 Broadway production garnered 12 Tony Award nominations, winning five, including best direction and choreography for Tommy Tune. Big-name cast replacements, including Cyd Charisse and Zina Bethune, helped the show become the first American musical since 1985&#x27;s &quot;Big River&quot; to top 1,000 performances on Broadway.

==Background==
&quot;Menschen im Hotel&quot; marked the beginning of the career of popular Austrian novelist Baum in 1929 and she dramatized her novel for the Berlin stage later in the same year. After the play became a hit, its English-language adaptation enjoyed success in New York in the early 1930s and was made into the blockbuster 1932 Academy Award-winning film, &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;, starring Greta Garbo, John Barrymore and Joan Crawford.

===&quot;At the Grand&quot;===
Davis, Wright, and Forrest first adapted Baum&#x27;s story in 1958 under the title &quot;At the Grand&quot;, changing the setting from 1928 Berlin to contemporary Rome and transforming the ballerina into an opera singer closely resembling Maria Callas to accommodate Joan Diener, who was scheduled to star under the direction of her husband Albert Marre. All of them had collaborated on the earlier musical &quot;Kismet&quot; and anticipated another success, but Davis&#x27; book strayed too far from the story familiar to fans of the film. When Paul Muni agreed to portray Kringelein, the role was changed and expanded, with the character becoming a lowly hotel employee whose stay in a hotel suite is kept secret from the management. Flaemmchen became a dancing soubrette, Preysing and his dramatic storyline were eliminated completely, and two deported American gangsters were added for comic relief.

&quot;At the Grand&quot; opened to mixed reviews and good business in Los Angeles and San Francisco, but when it became apparent to the creators that Muni was ill and would not be able to sustain a Broadway run, producer Edwin Lester decided to cancel the Broadway opening scheduled for September 25, 1958, and everyone moved on to other projects.

===&quot;Grand Hotel&quot;===
Three decades later, Davis, Wright, and Forrest decided to dust off their original material and give the show another try, returning the show to its original setting in 1928 Berlin. This time it was placed in the hands of director-choreographer Tommy Tune, who envisioned it as a two-hour, non-stop production comprising dialogue scenes, musical numbers, and dance routines overlapping and at times competing with each other, thereby capturing the mood of a bustling hotel where something is happening at all times. Seven songs from &quot;At the Grand&quot; were incorporated into what was now called &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;, although two were dropped during the Boston tryout.

During the Boston run in 1989, Wright and Forrest acquiesced when Tune requested Maury Yeston, with whom he had worked in &quot;Nine&quot;, be brought in to contribute fresh material. Yeston wrote seven new songs in the first week, including &quot;Love Can&#x27;t Happen&quot;, &quot;I Want to Go to Hollywood&quot;, &quot;At The Grand Hotel&quot;, &quot;Bonjour Amour&quot;, &quot;Roses at the Station&quot; and &quot;Grand Parade&quot; (the new opening number), as well as additional lyrics for some of the Wright and Forrest songs. At Tune&#x27;s request, Peter Stone came in as uncredited play doctor, though the book remained entirely the work of Davis. Yeston received billing for Additional Music and Lyrics and was nominated for two Drama Desk Awards for his work. Ballroom choreography was by Pierre Dulaine and Yvonne Marceau, who played The Gigolo and The Countess in the show, and as a favor to Tune, Thommie Walsh choreographed a brief dance section in &quot;I Want to Go to Hollywood&quot;.

==Synopsis==
The roaring &#x27;20s are still in high gear, and Berlin is the center of high life. Guests come and go at the opulent Grand Hotel, as cynical Doctor Otternschlag, who still suffers from World War I wounds, injects his morphine. Assistant concierge Erik, busy at the front desk, waits to hear of his son&#x27;s birth; his wife is having a difficult labor. Baron Felix Von Gaigern, young, good-looking, and destitute, uses his charisma to help him secure a room in the overbooked hotel while stiffing a tough gangster who pretends to be a chauffeur. Aging Russian prima ballerina Elizaveta Grushinskaya arrives with her entourage who tries to persuade her that she still can and must dance. Her confidante and dresser, Raffaela knows that they would have to come up with a lot of money if the dancer failed to show up for her contracted engagements. Raffaela has feelings for Elizaveta.

Jewish bookkeeper Otto Kringelein, who is fatally ill, wants to spend his life&#x27;s savings to live his final days at the hotel in the lap of luxury. The Baron helps him secure a room. Meanwhile, Hermann Preysing, the general manager of a failing textile mill, hears that the merger with a Boston company is off, spelling financial ruin; he does not want to lie to his stockholders but gives in to the pressure. He plans to go to Boston to try to revive the merger and presses his temporary secretary, Flaemmchen, to accompany him and &quot;take care of him&quot;. She dreams of Hollywood stardom and fears she might be pregnant, but flirts with the Baron. She also agrees to a dance, at the Baron&#x27;s suggestion, with the surprised and delighted Otto. Elizaveta suffers through another unsuccessful dance performance and rushes back to the hotel. She bursts into her room to find the Baron as he is about to steal her diamond necklace to pay back the gangster, but he pretends to be her biggest fan. The two fall in love with each other and spend the night. He agrees to go with her to Vienna so that she can fulfill her dancing engagements, and they will get married; they plan to meet at the train station.

Two African-American entertainers, the Jimmys, sing at the bar and dance with Flaemmchen. Erik tries to get off work so that he can join his wife at the hospital, but the unpleasant hotel manager, Rohna, refuses to give him any time off. The Baron has persuaded Otto to invest in the stock market, and Otto has made a killing in the market overnight. But Otto is not feeling well, and the Baron helps him to his room, resisting the temptation to steal his wallet. Otto rewards the Baron with some cash. The gangster confronts the Baron and directs him to steal Preysing&#x27;s wallet; he gives the Baron a gun. Preysing has cornered Flaemmchen in their adjoining rooms and pressures her for sex. The Baron, who was in Preysing&#x27;s room trying to steal his wallet, hears Flaemmchen&#x27;s cries next door and walks into her room to defend her while still holding Preysing&#x27;s wallet. After a struggle, Preysing kills the Baron with the gangster&#x27;s gun. Preysing is arrested. Raffaela struggles with how to tell Grushinskaya that her lover is dead and ultimately decides not to, leaving Grushinskaya ecstatic to see him at the train station when she leaves.

Otto offers to take Flaemmchen to Paris; he has plenty of money now so that they can enjoy the good life for as much time as he has left, and she realizes that she is fond of him. Erik has a son and finds out that his wife came through the labor just fine. Doctor Otternschlag observes: &quot;Grand Hotel, Berlin. Always the same – people come, people go – One life ends while another begins – one heart breaks while another beats faster – one man goes to jail while another goes to Paris – always the same. ... I&#x27;ll stay – one more day.&quot;

==Productions==
After thirty-one previews, &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; opened on November 12, 1989, at the Martin Beck Theatre, and later transferred to the George Gershwin Theatre to complete its total run of 1,017 performances. The show is played without an intermission. The original cast included Liliane Montevecchi as Elizaveta, David Carroll as the Baron, Michael Jeter as Otto, Jane Krakowski as Flaemmchen, Tim Jerome as Preysing, John Wylie as Otternschlag, and Bob Stillman as Erik. Replacements later in the run included Zina Bethune and Cyd Charisse (in her Broadway debut at age 70) as Elizaveta, Rex Smith, Brent Barrett, John Schneider, and Walter Willison as the Baron, and Chip Zien and Austin Pendleton as Kringelein. The production captured 12 Tony nominations, winning five awards, including best direction and choreography for Tommy Tune. The original cast recording was released nearly two years after the show premiered. By the time the recording was made, Carroll was seriously ill with AIDS and died from a pulmonary embolism in the recording studio as he was about to record his vocal tracks. Brent Barrett, his understudy, who had appeared as the Baron in the national tour, sang the role for the cast album, released by RCA Victor. The cast album features a bonus track of Carroll&#x27;s performance during a 1991 cabaret fundraiser for Equity Fights AIDS, singing the Baron&#x27;s song, &quot;Love Can&#x27;t Happen&quot;.

The production was reproduced by the same team in Berlin, Germany, in 1991, in German, at the Theater des Westens, with Leslie Caron as Grushinskaya.

The first West End production opened on July 6, 1992, at the Dominion Theatre, where it ran for slightly less than four months. In 2004, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio starred as Elizaveta in a small-scale production directed by Michael Grandage at the Donmar Warehouse, garnering an Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival. A further production opened on July 31, 2015, at London&#x27;s Southwark Playhouse, running for five weeks.

&quot;Grand Hotel: The 25th Anniversary Reunion Concert&quot; at the nightclub 54 Below in New York City on May 24, 2015, was written and directed by Walter Willison. Willison starred alongside fellow Broadway cast members Montevecchi, Barrett, Jerome, as well as Karen Akers, Ben George, Ken Jennings, Hal Robinson and Chip Zien. Dance consultant was Yvonne Marceau. The show was produced by &quot;Encores!&quot;, directed by Josh Rhodes, in New York City from March 21–25, 2018. &quot;Grand Hotel: A 30th Anniversary Celebration in Concert&quot; at the nightclub The Yellow Pavilion (aka The Green Fig), presented by The Green Room 42, in New York City on November 11, 2019, was again written and directed by Willison, as a benefit for the Actors Fund of America, and dedicated to Montevecchi. Willison starred alongside Akers, Jerome, Jennings, Schneider, Jill Powell, Judy Kaye and Sachi Parker. The associate director and choreographer (in the style of Tommy Tune) was Joanna Rush, and dance consultant was again Marceau.

<text>The British Rail Class 207 (3D) diesel-electric multiple units were built by BR at Eastleigh in 1962. The fleet had a lifespan of 42 years. The Southern Region class 201 to 207 DEMUs are nicknamed &#x27;Thumpers&#x27; due to the distinctive sound of their engines.

==Operational history==

When new the class were used on the Oxted Line, and were mostly concentrated on services between and Uckfield and Eridge to Tonbridge via . Other routes that the units operated included occasional workings on the Marshlink Line, the Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells Central Line and the Cuckoo Line. Following the closure of the last two of these routes the unit gained workings on the Redhill to Tonbridge Line, and were known to deputise for 3R units on the North Downs Line to . Most units were withdrawn in 1987 following the electrification of the Oxted Line&#x27;s branch. Four of the seven surviving units were used on the Reading to Basingstoke Line between 1988 and 1993; once this had finished three were withdrawn and the fourth sent to join the other three survivors on the Marshlink Line; between 1995 and 1998 this included through services from to . After this the class operated on the Marshlink Line between Ashford and and the Oxted Line between London Victoria and for privatised companies Connex South Central and Southern. The final three units were withdrawn in August 2004.

==Technical details==
;Power car (one per set):
* Introduced: 1962
* Weight: 
* Engine: English Electric 4-cylinder type 4SRKT Mark II of at 850 rpm

==Preservation==

Three complete units have been preserved:
*207017 – Spa Valley Railway (3-car unit)
*207202 – Formerly owned by Coulsdon Old Vehicle &amp; Engineering Society, Bicester (2-car unit numbered 1305); purchased by and moved to the Bluebell Railway in January 2023.
*207203 – Swindon and Cricklade Railway (2-car unit) – DMBSO 60127 damaged by fire on 20 May 2016. Class 205 DTCsoL 60822 will be added to replace DTSO destroyed by fire. This vehicle had been stored at Pershore (ex unit 1123) and arrived at the Swindon &amp; Cricklade Railway on 17 June 2016. TS 60669 (ex unit 1124) also stored at Pershore arrived at the same time and will be stripped of usable spares to restore 60822.
In addition, driving motor vehicle from unit 207013 has also been preserved:
*207013 – DMBSO 60138 (cab only) – Reduced to just a cab in May 2016 and remaining section at the South Wales Cab Preservation Group.

<text>Konrad Rudnicki (born 2 July 1926 in Warsaw, Poland, died 12 November 2013 in Kraków, Poland) was a Polish astronomer, professor at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, and a priest of the Old Catholic Mariavite Church.

He was a member of the Free European Academy of Science, of Commission 28 (Galaxies) of the International Astronomical Union, and of the Mathematical-Astronomical Section at the Goetheanum in Switzerland.

==Life==
In World War II, Rudnicki fought as a partisan in the &quot;Gwardia Ludowa&quot;. While they were living in Piotrków Trybunalski, he and his mother Maria gave shelter to a Jewish family, the Weintraubs, who thus escaped the Holocaust. In January 1996 Konrad and his mother were recognized at Yad Vashem as Righteous among the Nations.

Rudnicki was at the California Institute of Technology from 1965 to 1967 and at Rice University from 1988 to 1989.

He discovered several supernovae. One of them, found between two galaxies, was the first such discovery to be made in the history of astronomy. He also advanced a new hypothesis on the structure of galaxy clusters.

His areas of interest included extragalactic astronomy, cosmology, and the philosophy and methodology of science.

He discovered comet C/1966 T1, known as &quot;Rudnicki&#x27;s Comet.&quot;

<text>The term preference relation is used to refer to orderings that describe human preferences for one thing over an other.

* In computer science, machine learning algorithms are used to infer preferences, and the binary representation of the output of a preference learning algorithm is called a preference relation, regardless of whether it fits the weak ordering or semiorder mathematical models.

<doc id="1018216" wikidata="Q135491" url="?curid=1018216" title="White Fang (1991 film)">
<text>White Fang is a 1991 American northern period adventure drama film directed by Randal Kleiser, and starring Ethan Hawke, Klaus Maria Brandauer, and Seymour Cassel. Based on Jack London&#x27;s novel of the same name, the film tells the story of the friendship between a young Klondike gold prospector and a wolfdog. White Fang is portrayed by a wolfdog, Jed, who also appeared in such films as &quot;The Thing&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Journey of Natty Gann&quot; (1985). The film was released on January 18, 1991, by Buena Vista Pictures. A sequel to the film, &quot;White Fang 2: Myth of the White Wolf&quot;, was released in 1994.

==Plot==
In 1896, during the Klondike Gold Rush, a young explorer named Jack Conroy arrives in Alaska from San Francisco to look for his deceased father&#x27;s mining claim. He meets Clarence &quot;Skunker&quot; Thurston and Alex Larson, two mushers who reluctantly agree to guide him. While on their journey, they are stalked by a wolf pack. One night, while resting at a campfire, a wolf lures one of the sled dogs away from the group. Another wolf then chases the dog into the woods. Skunker tries to save his dog and is killed by the pack. Later that night, the wolves return but are scared off by Jack and Alex using burning branches. The following morning, the wolves attack the two men, but they are saved when another sled team arrives. In the ensuing fight, a female wolf is mortally shot. The wolf hobbles back to her den, and her cub remains by her side. She eventually dies, leaving the pup to fend for himself. Jack and Alex reach a town where they plan to stay for the winter. A band of Native Americans, meanwhile, find the pup, and the chief, realizing he is a wolfdog (a hybrid of a wolf and dog) from the color of his teeth, names him White Fang.

As spring comes, Jack and Alex resume their quest, but stop off at the Native Americans&#x27; settlement. The chief explains that White Fang has been raised to obey, not to be friendly, but Jack seeks to change that. Jack&#x27;s chance comes when he is attacked by a grizzly bear, who chases him until he takes cover under a woodpile. White Fang, seeing Jack in danger, intervenes and defends him from the bear, leading to him having a standoff with the animal which ends with the bear leaving. Afterwards, Jack and Alex later leave the settlement. Not long after, White Fang is unfairly traded to Beauty Smith, a sadistic dogfighter who previously stole Jack&#x27;s money; he blackmails the Native American for the wolfdog, saying that ownership of a wild animal is considered illegal. Smith and his gang train and abuse White Fang into becoming a ferocious killing machine in order to enter him into illegal dogfights. White Fang eventually meets his match in a brutal fight against a bulldog, but Jack happens upon the fight and intervenes in the nick of time. Having earlier reached his father&#x27;s claim and begun the work of digging for gold, Jack returns with White Fang to the cabin, seeking to transform White Fang&#x27;s vicious and territorial nature.

Jack&#x27;s attempts to tame White Fang eventually succeed, and the two develop a close bond. Alex and Jack mine for gold, striking it rich with the help of White Fang. One morning, Jack travels to town to claim proper ownership of the gold when Luke notices White Fang. Seeking retaliation and planning to steal the gold for himself, Smith and his men attack the cabin site with guns and explosives. White Fang attacks Tinker, who accidentally discharges his gun and wounds Luke. White Fang eventually subdues Smith until he is ordered by Jack to back down. Jack and Alex take Smith and his men prisoner and force them at gunpoint to haul gold ore into town.

Alex and his wife, Belinda, offer to take Jack back to San Francisco, but he lets Jack know that city life is no place for a wolf; he must let White Fang run free in the wild. Though White Fang cannot understand why Jack is trying to leave him, Jack&#x27;s efforts by using a stick (which is White Fang&#x27;s worst fear when he was under Smith) succeed in scaring the wolfdog off. Later, just as he is boarding the ship back to San Francisco, Jack realizes that his rightful place is in the Yukon and decides to stay behind alone and live off the land; Alex congratulates him by saying that it is what Jack&#x27;s father would have wanted. After a short time, White Fang returns to the cabin site and happily reunites with Jack.

==Cast==
==Production==
The Walt Disney Company began filming on February 26, 1990, and officially ended this cinematic production five months later. Bart the Bear and the timber wolves were trained by professional employees of Heber City, Utah&#x27;s &quot;Wasatch Rocky Mountain Wildlife&quot;.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
The film received mixed-to-positive reviews. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 67% from 21 critics, with an average score of 5.80/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;This glossy edition of &quot;White Fang&quot; shaves off the rough-hewn edges that made Jack London&#x27;s epic story so distinct, but gorgeous photography and heartfelt performances make this an appealing adventure.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100 based on 17 reviews, indicating “generally favorable reviews&quot;. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four. He described it as a film that &quot;holds the natural world in wonder and awe&quot;, and praised the actors&#x27; &quot;authentic and understated” performances as well as the &quot;magnificently photographed” cinematography.

===Box office===
The film was produced on a budget of $14 million and grossed $34,793,160 in the United States and Canada. The film was also a particularly large box office hit in France where it had 3,501,373 admissions and a gross of over 35 million French Franc ($6 million), becoming the fourth highest-grossing film of 1991.

<text>The Avion III (sometimes referred to as the Aquilon or the Éole III) was a steam-powered aircraft built by Clément Ader between 1892 and 1897, financed by the French War Office.

Retaining the same bat-like configuration of the &quot;Éole&quot;, the &quot;Avion III&quot; was equipped with two engines driving two propellers. While the earlier aircraft had no means of directional control at all, this one was equipped with a rudder.

Trials began at the Satory army base near Versailles on 12 October 1897, with the aircraft taxiing along a circular track. On 14 October 1897, it left the track, turned halfway around, and then stopped, but did not take flight. Later in his life, Ader claimed that there had been a flight of 100 m (328 ft) on this day, and said he had two witnesses to confirm it. Regardless, the French military was unimpressed with the demonstration and cancelled any further funding.

The machine is preserved at the &quot;Musée des Arts et Métiers&quot; in Paris. It underwent extensive restoration in the 1980s.

<doc id="1018224" wikidata="Q1095600" url="?curid=1018224" title="Crown of sonnets">
<text>A crown of sonnets or sonnet corona is a sequence of sonnets, usually addressed to one person, and/or concerned with a single theme. Each of the sonnets explores one aspect of the theme, and is linked to the preceding and succeeding sonnets by repeating the final line of the preceding sonnet as its first line. The first line of the first sonnet is repeated as the final line of the final sonnet, thereby bringing the sequence to a close.

==Heroic crown==
An advanced form of crown of sonnets is also called a sonnet redoublé or heroic crown, comprising fifteen sonnets, in which the sonnets are linked as described above, but the final binding sonnet is made up of all the first or the last lines of the preceding fourteen, in order. The fifteenth sonnet is called the Mastersonnet. This form was invented by the Siena Academy, which was formed in 1460, but there are no existing crowns of sonnets written by them. The form was first described by Giovanni Mario Crescimbeni in his work &quot;L&#x27;Istoria della volgar poesia&quot; (History of Vernacular Poetry), published in Venice, 1731 and later by P.G. Bisso in his &quot;Introduzione alla volgar poesia&quot; (Introduction to Vernacular Poetry), published in Venice, 1794. A variation on the form is sometimes used in which the binding sonnet is the first sonnet, and subsequent sonnets end with a line taken from it in order. The oldest complete crown which survived time was published in 1748. It was written by a group of 14 poets to celebrate the birth of the ideal woman: &quot;Corona di rime per festeggiare il natalizio giorno di fille&quot;.

John Donne wrote &quot;La corona&quot;, a set of 7 sonnets which are linked together. Because there are only 7 of them and because there&#x27;s no Mastersonnet, &quot;La corona&quot; is not a full heroic crown. Probably the first full crown of sonnets in English is Lady Mary Wroth&#x27;s &quot;A Crown of Sonnets Dedicated to Love&quot; which is from circa 1620.

The children&#x27;s book &quot;A Wreath for Emmett Till&quot; by Marilyn Nelson also follows the form of a heroic crown of sonnets. Another well-known and frequent author of contemporary crowns of sonnets is Marilyn Hacker. &quot;Intertidal&quot;, a collaborative crown of sonnets by contemporary poets Judith Barrington, Annie Finch, Julie Kane, Julia Lisella, D&#x27;Arcy Randall, Kathrine Varnes, and Lesley Wheeler, was organized through discussion on the Wom-Po listserv and published in 2007. The form is used frequently by Tyehimba Jess, both in his first book &quot;Leadbelly,&quot; and multiple times in his Pulitzer-prize winning collection &quot;Olio,&quot; which is structured around a heroic crown of persona poems in the voices of the original Fisk Jubilee Singers.

21st Century crowns in English are e.g. by Linda Bierds, Andrea Carter Brown, Robert Darling, Moira Egan, Jenny Factor, Andrei Krylov, Rachael Briggs, Julie Fay, Constance Merritt, Julie Sophia Paegle, Marie Ponsot, Patricia Smith, Marilyn Taylor, Natasha Trethewey, David Trinidad, John Murillo, John McDonough, Kathrine Varnes, Angela Alaimo O&#x27;Donnell, Laurie Ann Guerrero, Cindy Tran, Alicia Mountain, and Robert Luis Rodriguez. Fiona Chamness&#x27;s heroic crown &quot;Choreography for Ensemble&quot; won the 2014 Beloit Poetry Prize.

&quot;A Wreath of Sonnets&quot; () is the oldest Slovenian crown of sonnets, written by the Romantic poet France Prešeren. It was written in 1833 and was enriched with acrostic in the master sonnet. Prešeren&#x27;s crown of sonnets was translated into Russian in 1889, which had great influence on many poets, including Valery Bryusov. Jaroslav Seifert wrote his sentimental &quot;Věnec sonetů&quot; (A Wreath of Sonnets) in this form about Prague, with an authorized translation by Jan Křesadlo, who also composed his own emigre riposte in the same format, as well as writing several other sonnet cycles. The poet Venko Markovski wrote and published more than 100 crowns of sonnets, which also contained acrostics dedicated to various historical figures.

The oldest Dutch crown of sonnets is written by H.Th. Boelen in 1876: &#x27;Saffo-fantasie&#x27;, published in a journal for theatre. The second Dutch crown is by Eliza Laurillard: &#x27;Der bloemen lof&#x27;, published in his book &quot;Bloemen en knoppen&quot; from 1878. Jeanne Reyneke van Stuwe wrote the third Dutch crown, her book &quot;Impressies&quot; (1898) opens with a crown. In the 20st and 21st Century the crown became a regular form of poetry in Dutch literature, with authors like Frédéric Bastet, Ilja Leonard Pfeijffer, Frank van Pamelen, Wouter Ydema, and O.B. Kunst.

==Heroic crown of crowns==
In 1828 the German poet Ludwig Bechstein published &quot;Sonettenkränze&quot;. This book consists of 14 crowns of sonnets. Alas Bechstein did not think about linking the 14 Mastersonnets together to make a new crown. A crown of crowns consists of 14 crowns of which the mastersonnets form a crown on their own. Those 14 Mastersonnets generate a 15th Mastersonnet by their first or last lines, that 15th Mastersonnet is called the Grandmastersonnet. A crown of crowns consists thus of 196 linked sonnets which generate 14 Mastersonnets which generate 1 Grandmastersonnet; this leads to a total of 211 sonnets.

Bas Jongenelen and Martijn Neggers claimed to have written the first crown of crowns of sonnets in 2016: &quot;Een kruisweg van alledaags leed&quot;. 14 crowns made 14 Mastersonnets. These Mastersonnets are a crown on their own, generating another Mastersonnet, which is called the Grandmastersonnet. But their claim is false. The first crown of crowns ever was written by Mitja Šarabon in Slovenia in 1971: &quot;Sonetni venec sonetnih vencev&quot;. &quot;Een kruisweg van alledaags leed&quot; was the first crown of crowns in Dutch literature, other Dutch crown of crowns are e.g. &quot;Dichter bij het eind&quot;, &quot; &#x27;t Is egoïstisch, maar &#x27;t is mooi geweest&quot;, &quot;Ik maak er gauw een eind aan, en ik kom&quot;, &quot;Met rasse schreden naar het laatste feest&quot;, and &quot;Zo feestend leef ik naar het einde toe&quot; by Olax. Evi Aarens is, after Olax, the second individual poet who wrote a Dutch crown of crowns. In 2021 she published &quot;Disoriëntaties&quot;, a crown of crowns about the history of mankind.

The first crown of crowns was from Slovenia, more Slovenian poets wrote crowns of crowns. From 1994 dates &quot;Sla sponina&quot; by Janko Moder. Milan Batista published in 1998 &quot;Veliki sonetni venec&quot;, and Valentin Cundrič published in the same year 8 crowns of crowns, one of those is &quot;Pamtivid&quot; (which can also be found online). The other 7 crowns of crowns are published in his book &quot;Slovenska knjiga mrtvih&quot;. 2 of those are also published on the Internet: &quot;Molitvenik peščeni&quot; en &quot;Terjatve&quot;. The crowns of crowns by Cundrič doesn&#x27;t have Master- and Grandmastersonnets, it is up to the reader to puzzle them together.

Russian literature has also a tradition on crowns of crowns. Vladimir Germanovich Vasilyev wrote in 1987 his &quot;Мир&quot;, but he wasn’t able to publish it as a book, in 2016 he published it online. Anatoly Martynov published in 1996 &quot;Благовест&quot;. In 2007, the Russian poet Natalia Shamberova published &quot;The Mists of August&quot;, a wreath of wreaths: 211 interlacing sonnets composed of 14 wreaths of sonnets to form the wreath of magistrals, and a final sonnet called the magistrals&#x27; magistral. In 2010 came Arkady Alferov with &quot;Корона венков сонетов&quot; and in 2011 Sergey Don &quot;Тебе, мой город&quot;, and Elin Grigory Yakovlevich &quot;Колокол Герцелойды&quot;, Izyaslav Kotlyarov published in 2001 &quot;Земля простит, но не прощает небо&quot; and in 2015 &quot;Ещё за далью и за высотой&quot; uit. Not every crown of crown has a known year of publication. Vladimir Ostapenko’s two crowns of crowns &quot;Отшельник&quot; and &quot;Монолог&quot; for example. Or &quot;Корона жизни – Око&quot; by Leo Himmelsohn. Also Mark Polykovsky’s &quot;Волшебство сна&quot; is undated, just as &quot;Метаморфозы&quot; by Sluka Alexander Yaroslavovich, &quot;Мировоззре́ние Ми́стика&quot; by Igor Morozov, &quot;При све́те – Не уснуть&quot; van Ananyin Valery Zosimovich, and &quot;Моя Мифологики&quot; by Alexander Chetverkin.

Belarus knows several crowns of crowns: in 2015 Sophia Nikolaevna Shah published &quot;Мару стаць я мастаком&quot;. Special about the crown of crowns is that it&#x27;s a children&#x27;s book. Shah also published the crown of crowns &quot;Адухаўленне&quot; (2000), &quot;Прысвячэнне&quot; (2001), &quot;Прызначэнне&quot; (2002), &quot;Увасабленне&quot; (2003), &quot;Спасціжэнне&quot; (2004), &quot;Азарычы&quot; (2007) en &quot;Каб тое выказаць…&quot; (2015).

The first crown of crowns outside Europe was published in Brazil by the poet Paulo Camelo in 2002: &quot;Coroas de uma coroa&quot; (Crowns of a crown). He also published in 2020 &quot;Mulheres, mulheres&quot;. In 2024 he published &quot;Via Crucis&quot;, his third crown of crowns. Joedson Adriano da Silva Santos is also a Brasilian poet of crown of crowns, his &quot;Alcides&quot; is about Hercules, and published as a poster. In his later published book &quot;Alcides&quot; he published three complete crowns of crowns: &#x27;Teoria e Práxis&#x27;, &#x27;Parerga e Paralipomena&#x27; and &#x27;Dodecatlo&#x27;. This last crown of crowns is the same as &quot;Alcides&quot; on the poster.

In English literature John Patrick McDonough&#x27;s &quot;Heroic Crown of Heroic Crowns&quot; &quot;O Logos Tou Theou&quot; was completed in 2020. It was officially published on January 13, 2024. In 2021 Daniel Ståhl published &quot;Requiem - In memory of all that should have been&quot;. It claims to be a heroic crown of crowns: 14 crowns of which the Mastersonnets form a new crown. But the sonnets are not linked together, Ståhl&#x27;s crowns consists of 14 individual sonnets which are not woven together, the Mastersonnet is made of the first lines of the 14 sonnets before it. So &quot;Requiem&quot; is not a fully real crown of crowns. This technique looks like the one which the Slovenian poet Anton Gričnik used in 2005 in his &quot;Hvalnica Življenju&quot;. This book has 14 crowns, but they form not a strict interwoven 15th crown, because the 14 Mastersonnets are not linked together. Still that 15th crown generates a Grandmastersonnet, so the total of sonnets is 211.

&quot;A Celestial Crown of Sonnets&quot;, written by Sam Illingworth and Stephen Paul Wren, was published in 2021 by Penteract Press. It explores the development of astronomy from Thales of Miletus to Shi Shen to William Herschel.

Bas Jongenelen published on 2021-09-14 on neerlandistiek.nl (a scholarly website for Dutch language and literature) an Excel sheet to make a crown of crowns:
 First you write and fill in the Grandmastersonnet; the lines of which jump to the 14 Mastersonnets. If you write the 14 Mastersonnets, the lines jump to the 196 individual sonnets.

<text>Kreuzlingen is a municipality in the district of Kreuzlingen in the canton of Thurgau in north-eastern Switzerland. It is the seat of the district and is the second-largest city of the canton, after Frauenfeld, with a population of about 22,000. Together with the adjoining city of Konstanz just across the border in Germany, Kreuzlingen is part of the largest conurbation on Lake Constance with a population of almost 120,000.

==History==
The name of the municipality stems from the Augustinian monastery &quot;Crucelin&quot;, later Kreuzlingen Abbey. It was founded in 1125 by the Bishop of Constance Ulrich I. In the Swabian War and the 30 Years&#x27; War after the siege of Constance by Swedish troops, the Augustinian monastery was burned down by the people of Constance, who blamed the monks for having supported the enemy. In 1650, the monastery was rebuilt in its present location. With secularization in 1848, the buildings became a teachers&#x27; school. The chapel became a Catholic church.
The area was already settled during the Bronze Age. Celtic and Roman coins and artifacts testify of continued settlement. Kurzrickenbach is first mentioned as &quot;Rihinbah&quot; in 830, Egelshofen as &quot;Eigolteshoven&quot; in 1125, and Emmishofen as &quot;Eminshoven&quot; in 1159. The territory of the municipality, except for the Augustinian monastery, belonged to the Bishop of Constance. When the &quot;Eidgenossen&quot; conquered Thurgau in 1460 and further with the Reformation, the ties to the neighboring city loosened.

Until the beginning of the 19th century, the present center of Kreuzlingen was still largely agricultural. The first steamboats began to operate on Lake Constance in 1824. The first train line to Romanshorn was finished in 1871, and the second to Etzwilen in 1875. This brought commerce and industry to the region.

In 1874, the municipality of Egelshofen was renamed &quot;Kreuzlingen&quot; and became the capital of the district, instead of Gottlieben. It reached its present size with the incorporation of Kurzrickenbach in 1927 and Emmishofen in 1928. However, until World War I, Kreuzlingen was a kind of suburb of Constance. Most of its industry was in the hands of German firms. The war made Kreuzlingen more independent. In 1947 Kreuzlingen passed the mark of 10,000 residents, thus becoming according to Swiss statistical convention a town.

The Sanatorium of Bellevue (1857–1980), which occupied part of the old monastery, played an important role in the history of Kreuzlingen. In 1842, Ignaz Vanotti from Constance bought a large tract of land and built a residential and commercial building in 1843 to house the emigrant press of Bellevue, which had previously been located in Römerburg. In 1857, Ludwig Binswanger, a psychiatrist from Münsterlingen acquired the property and opened a private sanatorium. The clinic was very modern and remained in the control of the Binswanger family for nearly 120 years. Important psychiatric advances, particularly under the founder&#x27;s grandson, also called Ludwig Binswanger, especially in the development of existential psychotherapy, were made at the sanatorium. However, few of its buildings remain.

In the late 2010s, Kreuzlingen&#x27;s downtown began to experience a dearth of shoppers as many of them, including buses from elsewhere in Switzerland that pass through the city, started crossing the border to shop in Konstanz instead, due to lower prices for basic items in Germany, a favorable exchange rate between the euro and the franc and a German VAT refund that allows shoppers from non-European Union countries such as Switzerland to get back as much as a fifth of the price of the goods they buy. Elected officials from the city have asked the national government to negotiate a change in this policy with their German counterparts as they feel it is anti-competitive; at the same time some Konstanz residents, feeling displaced in their own hometown by the onslaught of Swiss on weekends, have opened businesses in Kreuzlingen that primarily cater to other Germans.

<doc id="1018226" wikidata="Q84922" url="?curid=1018226" title="Meinhardt Schomberg, 3rd Duke of Schomberg">
<text>General Meinhardt Schomberg, 3rd Duke of Schomberg, 1st Duke of Leinster, KG (30 June 1641 – ), was a German-born military officer and peer who served as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in 1691. He spent the majority of his military career in service to William III of England, fighting in the Portuguese Restoration War, Franco-Dutch War, Williamite War in Ireland and the War of the Spanish Succession.

==Life==
Born the son of Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg (who was of Huguenot descent), and Johanna Elizabeth de Schomberg (née von Schönberg), Meinhardt Schomberg joined his father in the service of the English Expeditionary brigade to Portugal and served as a lieutenant-colonel and then as a colonel. He then settled in La Rochelle with his father and became a French subject. He attained the rank of brigadier and, afterwards, maréchal de camp (major general), during the Franco-Dutch War in 1678. He fought under Marshal François de Créquy at the Battle of Kochersburg in October 1677, the Battle of Freiburg im Breisgau on 14 November 1677, at the Battle of Rheinfelden in July 1678 and at the Battle of Kinzing later that month, before serving under Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg as a general of cavalry.

He travelled to England in Spring 1689 and was made colonel of Lord Cavendish&#x27;s Regiment of Horse on 10 April 1690 and commissioned a general of the horse on 19 April 1690.

He served under his father during the Williamite War in Ireland, fighting against the Jacobite Irish Army. Frederick Schomberg was second in command of William&#x27;s army at the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690. Meanwhile, Meinhardt Schomberg commanded the right wing of William&#x27;s army during the battle and led the crucial crossing of the River Boyne at Roughgrange near Rosnaree on the Jacobites&#x27; flank, the turning point in the confrontation, despite a gallant defence by Sir Neil O&#x27;Neill, a Jacobite general. Schomberg then engaged in a pursuit of the retreating troops towards Duleek: there were no casualties amongst his regiment&#x27;s soldiers. Schomberg&#x27;s father died during the latter stages of the Battle which resulted in a decisive Williamite victory.

Meinhardt Schomberg was created Duke of Leinster for his part in the Battle on 30 June 1690 and, after taking part in the abortive Siege of Limerick in August 1690, he became a British subject through naturalization by Act of Parliament on 25 April 1691. From May 1691 he was also made Commander-in-Chief of the Forces during the King&#x27;s travels in Flanders. In Spring 1693 Schomberg was placed in command of the abortive descent on Saint-Malo and in October 1693 he inherited the title of Duke of Schomberg following the death of his younger brother Charles Schomberg at the Battle of Marsaglia. In 1698 he moved into Schomberg House, a new mansion specially commissioned for him on the south side of Pall Mall, London.

In 1703, he was created Knight of the Garter and Queen Anne appointed him Commander-in-Chief of the British forces sent to Portugal for the War of the Spanish Succession. Once in Portugal Schomberg was ineffective, simply allowing the Spanish General Tserclaes de Tilly to pass by unchallenged. Moreover, Schomberg had a dreadful temper which attracted universal disgust: neither Peter II, King of Portugal, nor Charles, claimant to the throne of Spain, were prepared to accept his turbulent behaviour and he was sent home in disgrace.

Meinhardt Schomberg had an interest in naval matters and registered a patent concerning inspecting the fishing for wrecks. He commissioned the construction of Hillingdon House in 1717 as his hunting lodge and died there on . He had no surviving male issue so all of his titles (Duke of Schomberg, Duke of Leinster, Marquess of Harwich, Earl of Brentford, Earl of Bangor, Baron Teyes and Count of Mértola) except Count of Mértola died with him.

The town of Schomberg, Ontario was renamed to commemorate the 3rd Duke of Schomberg in 1862.

==Family==

On 3 August 1667 Schomberg married Piedmontese Barbara Luisa Rizzi in La Rochelle. The couple did not have any children, although some sources suggest that shortly after the marriage he abandoned his wife when she was seven months pregnant after she refused to divorce.

On 4 January 1682 Schomberg married for the second time, to Raugravine Caroline Elisabeth (a daughter of Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine) and together they had four children:
* Charles Louis Schomberg, Marquess of Harwich (15 December 1683 – 14 October 1713), died from tuberculosis.
* Lady Caroline Schomberg (1686 – 18 June 1710)
* Lady Frederica Schomberg (c. 1688–1751) married (1) Robert Darcy, 3rd Earl of Holderness, and (2) Benjamin Mildmay, 1st Earl FitzWalter
* Lady Mary Schomberg (bap. 16 March 1692 – 29 April 1762) married Christoph Martin von Degenfeld-Schonburg

On October 2, 2014, it was announced that Huffman would be star and executive producer alongside Carol Mendelsohn in her untitled drama about a special agent (Huffman) who is the fearless leader of a team of young agents on the New York City Joint Terrorism Task Force. The project was developed for ABC, but was not green-lighted for 2015–16 television season. &quot;American Crime&quot; debuted on ABC in March, 2015 and Huffman received critical acclaim for her performance as an antagonistic character. Robert Bianco from &quot;USA Today&quot; said in his review &quot;A triumph for Oscar winner John Ridley, who created, produced and directed &quot;American Crime&quot;, and a reconfirmation that Felicity Huffman is one of the best actors we have... In no case is that truer than with Huffman&#x27;s Barb, who is the morally questionable center of the story. Barb is a Lifetime movie heroine: a tough, divorced mother who raised her children alone, and is fighting now to bring her son&#x27;s murderer to justice. Except this isn&#x27;t that kind of show, and Barb&#x27;s battles have not just made her stronger; they&#x27;ve made her hate all the people she&#x27;s felt she had to fight. Which is why Huffman&#x27;s gut-wrenching performance is so startling. A bundle of barely concealed fury, Huffman forces us to invest in a woman who thinks her bigotry makes her not just right, but noble.&quot;

In 2017, Huffman voiced a parody of herself in two episodes of the Netflix animated series &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot;. In 2018, Huffman starred in the second season of the Epix comedy-drama &quot;Get Shorty&quot;.

In 2019, Huffman starred in two Netflix projects: the Ava DuVernay miniseries &quot;When They See Us&quot; about the famous Central Park jogger case from 1989 in which a jogger was attacked in Central Park in New York City and in the comedy-drama film &quot;Otherhood&quot; based on the novel &quot;Whatever Makes You Happy&quot; by William Sutcliffe, She also starred in the drama film &quot;Tammy&#x27;s Always Dying&quot; directed by Amy Jo Johnson. which had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2019. It received generally positive reviews from critics, particularly for Huffman&#x27;s and Phillips&#x27; performances. It was released through video on demand on May 1, 2020, by Quiver Distribution.

In November 2020, it was reported that Huffman would star in an ABC comedy television series pertaining to minor league baseball. However, the pilot was ultimately not picked up as a series.

In March 2023, Huffman appeared in an episode of &quot;The Good Doctor&quot;, in which she portrayed distinguished attorney Janet Stewart. Huffman was meant to reprise the role in a spin-off titled &quot;The Good Lawyer&quot;; however, this spin-off was cancelled due to the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike.

==Personal life==

Huffman dated actor William H. Macy on and off for 15 years before they married on September 6, 1997. They have two daughters, Sophia and Georgia. She has appeared on television, in movies and on stage many times with her husband. The couple each received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on March 7, 2012.

In 2005, Huffman revealed that she had suffered from both anorexia and bulimia in her late teens and twenties.

Huffman is the co-author of the self-help book &quot;A Practical Handbook for the Boyfriend&quot;. On March 1, 2012, Huffman launched What The Flicka, a website dedicated to women and mothers where she was a regular contributor. In March 2019, the website was reportedly deactivated.

Huffman is a supporter of the Democratic Party. In 2016, Huffman voiced support for Hillary Rodham Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In 2019, Huffman donated $400 to Kamala Harris&#x27;s campaign in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.

Felicity Huffman has been a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in the Actors Branch since 2006.

=== Varsity Blues scandal ===

Huffman was among dozens charged by the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office on March 12, 2019, in a nationwide college entrance exam cheating scandal. Prosecutors alleged that Huffman&#x27;s $15,000 donation to the Key Worldwide Foundation, ostensibly a charitable contribution, was in fact payment to someone who posed as Huffman&#x27;s daughter Sophia to take the SAT, receiving a score that showed significant improvement over Sophia&#x27;s score on the Preliminary SAT (PSAT). Huffman was arrested at her California home on March 12 by FBI agents and IRS agents and charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services fraud. She appeared on March 13 in Los Angeles Federal Court, where federal agents took her passport and the court released her on $250,000 bail. At her court appearance in Boston on April 3, she acknowledged her rights, charges and maximum possible penalties then waived a pretrial hearing, signed conditions of her release and was allowed to leave. On April 8, she agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.

Huffman formally pleaded guilty to honest services fraud on May 13 and to federal charges for paying $15,000 to have a proctor correct SAT questions answered incorrectly by her daughter. On September 13, she was sentenced to 14 days in jail and one year of supervised release, fined $30,000 and ordered to do 250 hours of community service. She reported to the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin, California on October 15 to begin her sentence. She was released on October 25, two days early, because October 27 fell on a weekend. As of October 2020, when Huffman completed her full sentence, no charges have been filed against her husband and Sophia&#x27;s father, actor and director William H. Macy.

In a November 2023 interview with KABC-TV, Huffman spoke about the Varsity Blues scandal for the first time, saying &quot;It felt like I would be a bad mother if I didn&#x27;t do it.&quot;

<text>Tadeusz Julian Banachiewicz (13 February 1882, Warsaw – 17 November 1954, Kraków) was a Polish astronomer, mathematician and geodesist.

== Scientific career ==

Banachiewicz was educated at University of Warsaw and his thesis was on &quot;reduction constants of the Repsold heliometer&quot;. In 1905, after the closure of the University by the Russians, he moved to Göttingen and in 1906 to the Pulkovo Observatory. He also worked at the Engelhardt Observatory at Kazan University from 1910 to 1915.

In 1919, after Poland regained its independence, Banachiewicz moved to Kraków, becoming a professor at the Jagiellonian University and the director of Kraków Observatory (). A major contribution was a modified method of determining parabolic orbits. In 1925, he invented a theory of &quot;cracovians&quot; – a special kind of matrix algebra – which brought him international recognition. This theory solved several astronomical, geodetic, mechanical and mathematical problems.

In 1922 he became a member of Polish Academy of Learning and from 1932 to 1938 was the vice-president of the International Astronomical Union. He was also the first President of the Polish Astronomical Society, the vice-president of the Geodetic Committee of The Baltic States and, from 1952 to his death, a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences. He was also the founder of the journal Acta Astronomica. He was the recipient of Doctor Honoris Causa titles from the University of Warsaw (1929), the University of Poznań (1936) and the Sofia University in Bulgaria (1948).

Banachiewicz invented a chronocinematograph, an astronomical instrument for precise observations of solar eclipses. He published more than 500 scientific papers, scientific and popular press communications, telegraph scientific reports, polemics, reviews, reports and editorial works, dealing with astronomy, mathematics, mechanics, geodesy, geophysics and other fields
of science. The LU decomposition was introduced by Banachiewicz in 1938.

== Honors ==

The lunar crater Banachiewicz and the main-belt asteroid 1286 Banachiewicza are named after him. The asteroid 1287 Lorcia was named after his wife following his suggestion to the discoverer.

<text>Ecgberht (or Egbert, and sometimes referred to as Egbert of Rath Melsigi) (died 729) was an Anglo-Saxon monk of Northumbria. After studying at Lindisfarne and Rath Melsigi, he spent his life travelling among monasteries in northern Britain and around the Irish Sea. He was instrumental in the establishment of Wihtberht&#x27;s mission to Frisia.

==Life==
Ecgberht was an Anglo-Saxon of a noble family, probably from Northumbria. After some years of study in the monastery of Lindisfarne,
he travelled to Ireland to study. One of his acquaintances at this time was Chad of Mercia. He settled at the monastery of Rath Melsigi, in modern-day county Carlow. In 664, most of his Northumbrian travelling companions, including Æthelhun, died of the plague, and he contracted it as well.

Ecgberht vowed that if he recovered, he would become a &quot;peregrinus&quot; on perpetual pilgrimage from his homeland of Britain and would lead a life of penitential prayer and fasting. He was twenty-five, and when he recovered he kept his vow until his death at age 90. According to Henry Mayr-Harting, Ecgberht was one of the most famous ‘pilgrims’ of the early Middle Ages, and occupied a prominent position in a political and religious culture that spanned northern Britain and the Irish Sea.

Ecgberht was ordained a priest and began to organize monks in Ireland to proselytize in Frisia; many other high-born notables were associated with his work: Adalbert, Swithbert, and Chad. He, however, was dissuaded from accompanying them himself by a vision related to him by a monk who had been a disciple of Boisil (the Prior of Melrose under Abbot Eata). Ecgberht instead dispatched Wihtberht, another Englishman living at Rath Melsigi, to Frisia. Ecgberht then arranged the mission of Wigbert, Willibrord, and others.

In 684, he tried to dissuade King Ecgfrith of Northumbria from sending an expedition to Ireland under his general Berht, but he was unsuccessful.

While in Ireland, Ecgberht was one of those present at the Synod of Birr in 697, when the Cáin Adomnáin was guaranteed.

Ecgberht had influential contacts with the kings of Northumbria and of the Picts, as well as with Iona, to which he moved around 716. He attempted to persuade the monks there to adopt the Roman Easter dating. He died on Iona at the age of ninety, on the first day that the Easter feast was observed in this manner in the monastery, on 24 April 729.

His feast day in the Roman Catholic Church, 24 April, is found in both the Roman and Irish martyrologies, and in the Metrical Calendar of York. Although he is now honoured simply as a confessor, it is probable that Ecgberht was a bishop. 

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, his feast day is celebrated on January 5.

Ecgberht ought not to be confused with the later Ecgberht, Archbishop of York, or Egbert of Lindisfarne.

<doc id="1018252" wikidata="Q673344" url="?curid=1018252" title="A7 motorway (Switzerland)">
<text>The A7 is a motorway (German: &quot;Autobahn&quot;) which runs from Winterthur in northeastern Switzerland through to Kreuzlingen, a border town with Konstanz (Germany).

The A7 is fully motorway and is relatively devoid of either traffic jams or, indeed, traffic at all. The A7 leaves Winterthur at the Attikon interchange, heading slightly north before turning northeast and continuing onto the capital of the canton of Thurgau, Frauenfeld.

The A7 next connects to another interchange at Grüneck. Before the A7 was completed in full to Kreuzlingen, the A7 would continue from the Müllheim exit through to Eschikofen. That road is now the A23.

The portion of the A7 after Grüneck (heading northeast) is nearly devoid of car park areas, service areas, or even exits. No exit, in fact, would link with the motorway until Kreuzlingen. Meanwhile, the motorway runs through a few tunnels, including a rather long and winding tunnel just before its terminus in Kreuzlingen.

A rarely seen motorway/main road roundabout in Kreuzlingen marks the end of the toll section of the A7. Heading north, the customs area with Kreuzlingen marks the final end of the A7 motorway.

&quot;Main route&quot;: Winterthur - Frauenfeld - Grüneck - Kreuzlingen - border with Konstanz (Germany)

&quot;Speed limit&quot;: 120 km/h (75 mph) nearly throughout.

&quot;Tolls&quot;: Covered by CHF 40 annual motorway toll sticker (&quot;Vignette&quot;). (Does not apply for short section just south of Konstanz/Kreuzlingen border crossing, north of Kreuzlingen roundabout.)

<text>Edmund Faustyn Biernacki (19 December 1866 in Opoczno – 29 December 1911 in Lwów) was a Polish physician.

Biernacki was the first one to note a relationship between the sedimentation rate of red blood cells in a human blood sample and the general condition of the organism. This method, known as the Biernacki Reaction, is used worldwide to assess erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which is one of the major blood tests.

<text>In mathematics, a 3-manifold is a topological space that locally looks like a three-dimensional Euclidean space. A 3-manifold can be thought of as a possible shape of the universe. Just as a sphere looks like a plane (a tangent plane) to a small and close enough observer, all 3-manifolds look like our universe does to a small enough observer. This is made more precise in the definition below.

==Principles==

===Definition===
A topological space formula_1 is a 3-manifold if it is a second-countable Hausdorff space and if every point in formula_1 has a neighbourhood that is homeomorphic to Euclidean 3-space.

===Mathematical theory of 3-manifolds===
The topological, piecewise-linear, and smooth categories are all equivalent in three dimensions, so little distinction is made in whether we are dealing with say, topological 3-manifolds, or smooth 3-manifolds.

Phenomena in three dimensions can be strikingly different from phenomena in other dimensions, and so there is a prevalence of very specialized techniques that do not generalize to dimensions greater than three. This special role has led to the discovery of close connections to a diversity of other fields, such as knot theory, geometric group theory, hyperbolic geometry, number theory, Teichmüller theory, topological quantum field theory, gauge theory, Floer homology, and partial differential equations. 3-manifold theory is considered a part of low-dimensional topology or geometric topology.

A key idea in the theory is to study a 3-manifold by considering special surfaces embedded in it. One can choose the surface to be nicely placed in the 3-manifold, which leads to the idea of an incompressible surface and the theory of Haken manifolds, or one can choose the complementary pieces to be as nice as possible, leading to structures such as Heegaard splittings, which are useful even in the non-Haken case.

Thurston&#x27;s contributions to the theory allow one to also consider, in many cases, the additional structure given by a particular Thurston model geometry (of which there are eight). The most prevalent geometry is hyperbolic geometry. Using a geometry in addition to special surfaces is often fruitful.

The fundamental groups of 3-manifolds strongly reflect the geometric and topological information belonging to a 3-manifold. Thus, there is an interplay between group theory and topological methods.

=== Invariants describing 3-manifolds ===
3-manifolds are an interesting special case of low-dimensional topology because their topological invariants give a lot of information about their structure in general. If we let formula_1 be a 3-manifold and formula_4 be its fundamental group, then a lot of information can be derived from them. For example, using Poincare duality and the Hurewicz theorem, we have the following homology groups:
formula_5where the last two groups are isomorphic to the group homology and cohomology of formula_6, respectively; that is,formula_7From this information a basic homotopy theoretic classification of 3-manifolds can be found. Note from the Postnikov tower there is a canonical mapformula_8If we take the pushforward of the fundamental class formula_9 into formula_10 we get an element formula_11. It turns out the group formula_6 together with the group homology class formula_13 gives a complete algebraic description of the homotopy type of formula_1.

==== Connected sums ====
One important topological operation is the connected sum of two 3-manifolds formula_15. In fact, from general theorems in topology, we find for a three manifold with a connected sum decomposition formula_16 the invariants above for formula_1 can be computed from the formula_18. In particularformula_19Moreover, a 3-manifold formula_1 which cannot be described as a connected sum of two 3-manifolds is called prime.

==== Second homotopy groups ====
For the case of a 3-manifold given by a connected sum of prime 3-manifolds, it turns out there is a nice description of the second fundamental group as a formula_21-module. For the special case of having each formula_22 is infinite but not cyclic, if we take based embeddings of a 2-sphereformula_23 where formula_24then the second fundamental group has the presentationformula_25giving a straightforward computation of this group.

== Important examples of 3-manifolds ==

===Euclidean 3-space===

Euclidean 3-space is the most important example of a 3-manifold, as all others are defined in relation to it. This is just the standard 3-dimensional vector space over the real numbers.

===3-sphere===

A 3-sphere is a higher-dimensional analogue of a sphere. It consists of the set of points equidistant from a fixed central point in 4-dimensional Euclidean space. Just as an ordinary sphere (or 2-sphere) is a two-dimensional surface that forms the boundary of a ball in three dimensions, a 3-sphere is an object with three dimensions that forms the boundary of a ball in four dimensions. Many examples of 3-manifolds can be constructed by taking quotients of the 3-sphere by a finite group formula_6 acting freely on formula_27 via a map formula_28, so formula_29.

===Real projective 3-space===

Real projective 3-space, or RP&quot;3&quot;, is the topological space of lines passing through the origin 0 in R4. It is a compact, smooth manifold of dimension &quot;3&quot;, and is a special case Gr(1, R4) of a Grassmannian space.

RP3 is (diffeomorphic to) SO(3), hence admits a group structure; the covering map &quot;S&quot;3 → RP3 is a map of groups Spin(3) → SO(3), where Spin(3) is a Lie group that is the universal cover of SO(3).

===3-torus===

The 3-dimensional torus is the product of 3 circles. That is:

:formula_30

The 3-torus, T3 can be described as a quotient of R3 under integral shifts in any coordinate. That is, the 3-torus is R3 modulo the action of the integer lattice Z3 (with the action being taken as vector addition). Equivalently, the 3-torus is obtained from the 3-dimensional cube by gluing the opposite faces together.

A 3-torus in this sense is an example of a 3-dimensional compact manifold. It is also an example of a compact abelian Lie group. This follows from the fact that the unit circle is a compact abelian Lie group (when identified with the unit complex numbers with multiplication). Group multiplication on the torus is then defined by coordinate-wise multiplication.

===Hyperbolic 3-space===

Hyperbolic space is a homogeneous space that can be characterized by a constant negative curvature. It is the model of hyperbolic geometry. It is distinguished from Euclidean spaces with zero curvature that define the Euclidean geometry, and models of elliptic geometry (like the 3-sphere) that have a constant positive curvature. When embedded to a Euclidean space (of a higher dimension), every point of a hyperbolic space is a saddle point. Another distinctive property is the amount of space covered by the 3-ball in hyperbolic 3-space: it increases exponentially with respect to the radius of the ball, rather than polynomially.

===Poincaré dodecahedral space===

The Poincaré homology sphere (also known as Poincaré dodecahedral space) is a particular example of a homology sphere. Being a spherical 3-manifold, it is the only homology 3-sphere (besides the 3-sphere itself) with a finite fundamental group. Its fundamental group is known as the binary icosahedral group and has order 120. This shows the Poincaré conjecture cannot be stated in homology terms alone.

In 2003, lack of structure on the largest scales (above 60 degrees) in the cosmic microwave background as observed for one year by the WMAP spacecraft led to the suggestion, by Jean-Pierre Luminet of the Observatoire de Paris and colleagues, that the shape of the universe is a Poincaré sphere. In 2008, astronomers found the best orientation on the sky for the model and confirmed some of the predictions of the model, using three years of observations by the WMAP spacecraft.
However, there is no strong support for the correctness of the model, as yet.

===Seifert–Weber space===

In mathematics, Seifert–Weber space (introduced by Herbert Seifert and Constantin Weber) is a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold. It is also known as Seifert–Weber dodecahedral space and hyperbolic dodecahedral space. It is one of the first discovered examples of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

It is constructed by gluing each face of a dodecahedron to its opposite in a way that produces a closed 3-manifold. There are three ways to do this gluing consistently. Opposite faces are misaligned by 1/10 of a turn, so to match them they must be rotated by 1/10, 3/10 or 5/10 turn; a rotation of 3/10 gives the Seifert–Weber space. Rotation of 1/10 gives the Poincaré homology sphere, and rotation by 5/10 gives 3-dimensional real projective space.

With the 3/10-turn gluing pattern, the edges of the original dodecahedron are glued to each other in groups of five. Thus, in the Seifert–Weber space, each edge is surrounded by five pentagonal faces, and the dihedral angle between these pentagons is 72°. This does not match the 117° dihedral angle of a regular dodecahedron in Euclidean space, but in hyperbolic space there exist regular dodecahedra with any dihedral angle between 60° and 117°, and the hyperbolic dodecahedron with dihedral angle 72° may be used to give the Seifert–Weber space a geometric structure as a hyperbolic manifold.
It is a quotient space of the order-5 dodecahedral honeycomb, a regular tessellation of hyperbolic 3-space by dodecahedra with this dihedral angle.

===Gieseking manifold===

In mathematics, the Gieseking manifold is a cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold of finite volume. It is non-orientable and has the smallest volume among non-compact hyperbolic manifolds, having volume approximately 1.01494161. It was discovered by .

The Gieseking manifold can be constructed by removing the vertices from a tetrahedron, then gluing the faces together in pairs using affine-linear maps. Label the vertices 0, 1, 2, 3. Glue the face with vertices 0,1,2 to the face with vertices 3,1,0 in that order. Glue the face 0,2,3 to the face 3,2,1 in that order. In the hyperbolic structure of the Gieseking manifold, this ideal tetrahedron is the canonical polyhedral decomposition of David B. A. Epstein and Robert C. Penner. Moreover, the angle made by the faces is formula_31. The triangulation has one tetrahedron, two faces, one edge and no vertices, so all the edges of the original tetrahedron are glued together.

== Some important classes of 3-manifolds ==

* Graph manifold
* Haken manifold
* Homology spheres
* Hyperbolic 3-manifold
* I-bundles
* Knot and link complements
* Lens space
* Seifert fiber spaces, Circle bundles
* Spherical 3-manifold
* Surface bundles over the circle
* Torus bundle

===Hyperbolic link complements===
A hyperbolic link is a link in the 3-sphere with complement that has a complete Riemannian metric of constant negative curvature, i.e. has a hyperbolic geometry. A hyperbolic knot is a hyperbolic link with one component.

The following examples are particularly well-known and studied.

* Figure eight knot
* Whitehead link
* Borromean rings

The classes are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

== Some important structures on 3-manifolds ==

=== Contact geometry ===

Contact geometry is the study of a geometric structure on smooth manifolds given by a hyperplane distribution in the tangent bundle and specified by a one-form, both of which satisfy a &#x27;maximum non-degeneracy&#x27; condition called &#x27;complete non-integrability&#x27;. From the Frobenius theorem, one recognizes the condition as the opposite of the condition that the distribution be determined by a codimension one foliation on the manifold (&#x27;complete integrability&#x27;).

Contact geometry is in many ways an odd-dimensional counterpart of symplectic geometry, which belongs to the even-dimensional world. Both contact and symplectic geometry are motivated by the mathematical formalism of classical mechanics, where one can consider either the even-dimensional phase space of a mechanical system or the odd-dimensional extended phase space that includes the time variable.

=== Haken manifold ===

A Haken manifold is a compact, P²-irreducible 3-manifold that is sufficiently large, meaning that it contains a properly embedded two-sided incompressible surface. Sometimes one considers only orientable Haken manifolds, in which case a Haken manifold is a compact, orientable, irreducible 3-manifold that contains an orientable, incompressible surface.

A 3-manifold finitely covered by a Haken manifold is said to be virtually Haken. The Virtually Haken conjecture asserts that every compact, irreducible 3-manifold with infinite fundamental group is virtually Haken.

Haken manifolds were introduced by Wolfgang Haken. Haken proved that Haken manifolds have a hierarchy, where they can be split up into 3-balls along incompressible surfaces. Haken also showed that there was a finite procedure to find an incompressible surface if the 3-manifold had one. Jaco and Oertel gave an algorithm to determine if a 3-manifold was Haken.

===Essential lamination===
An essential lamination is a lamination where every leaf is incompressible and end incompressible, if the complementary regions of the lamination are irreducible, and if there are no spherical leaves.

Essential laminations generalize the incompressible surfaces found in Haken manifolds.

=== Heegaard splitting ===

A Heegaard splitting is a decomposition of a compact oriented 3-manifold that results from dividing it into two handlebodies.

Every closed, orientable three-manifold may be so obtained; this follows from deep results on the triangulability of three-manifolds due to Moise. This contrasts strongly with higher-dimensional manifolds which need not admit smooth or piecewise linear structures. Assuming smoothness the existence of a Heegaard splitting also follows from the work of Smale about handle decompositions from Morse theory.

=== Taut foliation ===

A taut foliation is a codimension 1 foliation of a 3-manifold with the property that there is a single transverse circle intersecting every leaf. By transverse circle, is meant a closed loop that is always transverse to the tangent field of the foliation. Equivalently, by a result of Dennis Sullivan, a codimension 1 foliation is taut if there exists a Riemannian metric that makes each leaf a minimal surface.

Taut foliations were brought to prominence by the work of William Thurston and David Gabai.

== Foundational results ==
Some results are named as conjectures as a result of historical artifacts.

We begin with the purely topological:

===Moise&#x27;s theorem===

In geometric topology, Moise&#x27;s theorem, proved by Edwin E. Moise in, states that any topological 3-manifold has an essentially unique piecewise-linear structure and smooth structure.

As corollary, every compact 3-manifold has a Heegaard splitting.

===Prime decomposition theorem===

The prime decomposition theorem for 3-manifolds states that every compact, orientable 3-manifold is the connected sum of a unique (up to homeomorphism) collection of prime 3-manifolds.

A manifold is &quot;prime&quot; if it cannot be presented as a connected sum of more than one manifold, none of which is the sphere of the same dimension.

=== Kneser–Haken finiteness===
Kneser-Haken finiteness says that for each compact 3-manifold, there is a constant C such that any collection of disjoint incompressible embedded surfaces of cardinality greater than C must contain parallel elements.

===Loop and Sphere theorems===

The loop theorem is a generalization of Dehn&#x27;s lemma and should more properly be called the &quot;disk theorem&quot;. It was first proven by Christos Papakyriakopoulos in 1956, along with Dehn&#x27;s lemma and the Sphere theorem.

A simple and useful version of the loop theorem states that if there is a map

:formula_32

with formula_33 not nullhomotopic in formula_34, then there is an embedding with the same property.

The sphere theorem of gives conditions for elements of the second homotopy group of a 3-manifold to be represented by embedded spheres.

One example is the following:

Let formula_1 be an orientable 3-manifold such that formula_36 is not the trivial group. Then there exists a non-zero element of
formula_36 having a representative that is an embedding formula_38.

===Annulus and Torus theorems===
The annulus theorem states that if a pair of disjoint simple closed curves on the boundary of a three manifold are freely homotopic then they cobound a properly embedded annulus. This should not be confused with the high dimensional theorem of the same name.

The torus theorem is as follows: Let M be a compact, irreducible 3-manifold with nonempty boundary. If M admits an essential map of a torus, then M admits an essential embedding of either a torus or an annulus

===JSJ decomposition===

The JSJ decomposition, also known as the toral decomposition, is a topological construct given by the following theorem:

:Irreducible orientable closed (i.e., compact and without boundary) 3-manifolds have a unique (up to isotopy) minimal collection of disjointly embedded incompressible tori such that each component of the 3-manifold obtained by cutting along the tori is either atoroidal or Seifert-fibered.

The acronym JSJ is for William Jaco, Peter Shalen, and Klaus Johannson. The first two worked together, and the third worked independently.

===Scott core theorem===

The Scott core theorem is a theorem about the finite presentability of fundamental groups of 3-manifolds due to G. Peter Scott. The precise statement is as follows:

Given a 3-manifold (not necessarily compact) with finitely generated fundamental group, there is a compact three-dimensional submanifold, called the compact core or Scott core, such that its inclusion map induces an isomorphism on fundamental groups. In particular, this means a finitely generated 3-manifold group is finitely presentable.

A simplified proof is given in, and a stronger uniqueness statement is proven in.

===Lickorish–Wallace theorem===

The Lickorish–Wallace theorem states that any closed, orientable, connected 3-manifold may be obtained by performing Dehn surgery on a framed link in the 3-sphere with formula_39 surgery coefficients. Furthermore, each component of the link can be assumed to be unknotted.

===Waldhausen&#x27;s theorems on topological rigidity===
Friedhelm Waldhausen&#x27;s theorems on topological rigidity say that certain 3-manifolds (such as those with an incompressible surface) are homeomorphic if there is an isomorphism of fundamental groups which respects the boundary.

===Waldhausen conjecture on Heegaard splittings===
Waldhausen conjectured that every closed orientable 3-manifold has only finitely many Heegaard splittings (up to homeomorphism) of any given genus.

===Smith conjecture===

The Smith conjecture (now proven) states that if &quot;f&quot; is a diffeomorphism of the 3-sphere of finite order, then the fixed point set of &quot;f&quot; cannot be a nontrivial knot.

===Cyclic surgery theorem===

The cyclic surgery theorem states that, for a compact, connected, orientable, irreducible three-manifold &quot;M&quot; whose boundary is a torus &quot;T&quot;, if &quot;M&quot; is not a Seifert-fibered space and &quot;r,s&quot; are slopes on &quot;T&quot; such that their Dehn fillings have cyclic fundamental group, then the distance between &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot; (the minimal number of times that two simple closed curves in &quot;T&quot; representing &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot; must intersect) is at most 1. Consequently, there are at most three Dehn fillings of &quot;M&quot; with cyclic fundamental group.

===Thurston&#x27;s hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem and the Jørgensen–Thurston theorem===

Thurston&#x27;s hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem states: formula_40 is hyperbolic as long as a finite set of &quot;exceptional slopes&quot; formula_41 is avoided for the &quot;i&quot;-th cusp for each &quot;i&quot;. In addition, formula_40 converges to &quot;M&quot; in &quot;H&quot; as all formula_43 for all formula_44 corresponding to non-empty Dehn fillings formula_45.

This theorem is due to William Thurston and fundamental to the theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. It shows that nontrivial limits exist in &quot;H&quot;. Troels Jorgensen&#x27;s study of the geometric topology further shows that all nontrivial limits arise by Dehn filling as in the theorem.

Another important result by Thurston is that volume decreases under hyperbolic Dehn filling. In fact, the theorem states that volume decreases under topological Dehn filling, assuming of course that the Dehn-filled manifold is hyperbolic. The proof relies on basic properties of the Gromov norm.

Jørgensen also showed that the volume function on this space is a continuous, proper function. Thus by the previous results, nontrivial limits in &quot;H&quot; are taken to nontrivial limits in the set of volumes. In fact, one can further conclude, as did Thurston, that the set of volumes of finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds has ordinal type formula_46. This result is known as the Thurston-Jørgensen theorem. Further work characterizing this set was done by Gromov.

Also, Gabai, Meyerhoff &amp; Milley showed that the Weeks manifold has the smallest volume of any closed orientable hyperbolic 3-manifold.

===Thurston&#x27;s hyperbolization theorem for Haken manifolds===

One form of Thurston&#x27;s geometrization theorem states:
If &quot;M&quot; is a compact irreducible atoroidal Haken manifold whose boundary has zero Euler characteristic, then the interior of &quot;M&quot; has a complete hyperbolic structure of finite volume.

The Mostow rigidity theorem implies that if a manifold of dimension at least 3 has a hyperbolic structure of finite volume, then it is essentially unique.

The conditions that the manifold &quot;M&quot; should be irreducible and atoroidal are necessary, as hyperbolic manifolds have these properties. However the condition that the manifold be Haken is unnecessarily strong. Thurston&#x27;s hyperbolization conjecture states that a closed irreducible atoroidal 3-manifold with infinite fundamental group is hyperbolic, and this follows from Perelman&#x27;s proof of the Thurston geometrization conjecture.

===Tameness conjecture, also called the Marden conjecture or tame ends conjecture===

The tameness theorem states that every complete hyperbolic 3-manifold with finitely generated fundamental group is topologically tame, in other words homeomorphic to the interior of a compact 3-manifold.

The tameness theorem was conjectured by Marden. It was proved by Agol and, independently, by Danny Calegari and David Gabai. It is one of the fundamental properties of geometrically infinite hyperbolic 3-manifolds, together with the density theorem for Kleinian groups and the ending lamination theorem. It also implies the Ahlfors measure conjecture.

===Ending lamination conjecture===

The ending lamination theorem, originally conjectured by William Thurston and later proven by Jeffrey Brock, Richard Canary, and Yair Minsky, states that hyperbolic 3-manifolds with finitely generated fundamental groups are determined by their topology together with certain &quot;end invariants&quot;, which are geodesic laminations on some surfaces in the boundary of the manifold.

===Poincaré conjecture===

The 3-sphere is an especially important 3-manifold because of the now-proven Poincaré conjecture. Originally conjectured by Henri Poincaré, the theorem concerns a space that locally looks like ordinary three-dimensional space but is connected, finite in size, and lacks any boundary (a closed 3-manifold). The Poincaré conjecture claims that if such a space has the additional property that each loop in the space can be continuously tightened to a point, then it is necessarily a three-dimensional sphere. An analogous result has been known in higher dimensions for some time.

After nearly a century of effort by mathematicians, Grigori Perelman presented a proof of the conjecture in three papers made available in 2002 and 2003 on arXiv. The proof followed on from the program of Richard S. Hamilton to use the Ricci flow to attack the problem. Perelman introduced a modification of the standard Ricci flow, called &quot;Ricci flow with surgery&quot; to systematically excise singular regions as they develop, in a controlled way. Several teams of mathematicians have verified that Perelman&#x27;s proof is correct.

===Thurston&#x27;s geometrization conjecture===

Thurston&#x27;s geometrization conjecture states that certain three-dimensional topological spaces each have a unique geometric structure that can be associated with them. It is an analogue of the uniformization theorem for two-dimensional surfaces, which states that every simply connected Riemann surface can be given one of three geometries (Euclidean, spherical, or hyperbolic).
In three dimensions, it is not always possible to assign a single geometry to a whole topological space. Instead, the geometrization conjecture states that every closed 3-manifold can be decomposed in a canonical way into pieces that each have one of eight types of geometric structure. The conjecture was proposed by William , and implies several other conjectures, such as the Poincaré conjecture and Thurston&#x27;s elliptization conjecture.

Thurston&#x27;s hyperbolization theorem implies that Haken manifolds satisfy the geometrization conjecture. Thurston announced a proof in the 1980s and since then several complete proofs have appeared in print.

Grigori Perelman sketched a proof of the full geometrization conjecture in 2003 using Ricci flow with surgery.
There are now several different manuscripts (see below) with details of the proof. The Poincaré conjecture and the spherical space form conjecture are corollaries of the geometrization conjecture, although there are shorter proofs of the former that do not lead to the geometrization conjecture.

===Virtually fibered conjecture and Virtually Haken conjecture===

The virtually fibered conjecture, formulated by American mathematician William Thurston, states that every closed, irreducible, atoroidal 3-manifold with infinite fundamental group has a finite cover which is a surface bundle over the circle.

The virtually Haken conjecture states that every compact, orientable, irreducible three-dimensional manifold with infinite fundamental group is &quot;virtually Haken&quot;. That is, it has a finite cover (a covering space with a finite-to-one covering map) that is a Haken manifold.

In a posting on the ArXiv on 25 Aug 2009, Daniel Wise implicitly implied (by referring to a then unpublished longer manuscript) that he had proven the Virtually fibered conjecture for the case where the 3-manifold is closed, hyperbolic, and Haken. This was followed by a survey article in Electronic Research Announcements in Mathematical Sciences.
Several more preprints have followed, including the aforementioned longer manuscript by Wise. In March 2012, during a conference at Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris, Ian Agol announced he could prove the virtually Haken conjecture for closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The proof built on results of Kahn and Markovic in their proof of the Surface subgroup conjecture and results of Wise in proving the Malnormal Special Quotient Theorem and results of Bergeron and Wise for the cubulation of groups. Taken together with Wise&#x27;s results, this implies the virtually fibered conjecture for all closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

===Simple loop conjecture===
If formula_47 is a map of closed connected surfaces such that formula_48 is not injective, then there exists a non-contractible simple closed
curve formula_49 such that formula_50 is homotopically trivial. This conjecture was proven by David Gabai.

===Surface subgroup conjecture===
The surface subgroup conjecture of Friedhelm Waldhausen states that the fundamental group of every closed, irreducible 3-manifold with infinite fundamental group has a surface subgroup. By &quot;surface subgroup&quot; we mean the fundamental group of a closed surface not the 2-sphere. This problem is listed as Problem 3.75 in Robion Kirby&#x27;s problem list.

Assuming the geometrization conjecture, the only open case was that of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. A proof of this case was announced in the Summer of 2009 by Jeremy Kahn and Vladimir Markovic and outlined in a talk August 4, 2009 at the FRG (Focused Research Group) Conference hosted by the University of Utah. A preprint appeared on the arxiv in October 2009. Their paper was published in the Annals of Mathematics in 2012. In June 2012, Kahn and Markovic were given the Clay Research Awards by the Clay Mathematics Institute at a ceremony in Oxford.

== Important conjectures ==

===Cabling conjecture===
The cabling conjecture states that if Dehn surgery on a knot in the 3-sphere yields a reducible 3-manifold, then that knot is a formula_51-cable on some other knot, and the surgery must have been performed using the slope formula_52.

===Lubotzky–Sarnak conjecture===
The fundamental group of any finite volume hyperbolic &quot;n&quot;-manifold does
not have Property τ.

<doc id="1018263" wikidata="Q6544408" url="?curid=1018263" title="Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia">
<text>The lieutenant governor of British Columbia () is the representative of the monarch in the province of British Columbia, Canada. The office of lieutenant governor is an office of the Crown and serves as a representative of the monarchy in the province, rather than the governor general of Canada. The office was created in 1871 when the Colony of British Columbia joined Confederation. Since then the lieutenant governor has been the representative of the monarchy in British Columbia. Previously, between 1858 and 1863 under colonial administration the title of lieutenant governor of British Columbia was given to Richard Clement Moody as commander of the Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment. This position coexisted with the office of governor of British Columbia served by James Douglas during that time.

The lieutenant governor of British Columbia is appointed in the same manner as the other provincial viceroys in Canada and is similarly tasked with carrying out most of the monarch&#x27;s constitutional and ceremonial duties. The present, and 31st lieutenant governor of British Columbia is Wendy Lisogar-Cocchia, who has served in the role since 30 January 2025.

==Role and presence==

The lieutenant governor of British Columbia is vested with a number of governmental duties.

The viceroy is also expected to undertake various ceremonial roles. The lieutenant governor, him or herself a member and Chancellor of the order, will induct deserving individuals into the Order of British Columbia and, upon installation, automatically becomes a Knight or Dame of Justice and the Vice-Prior in British Columbia of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem. The viceroy further presents other provincial honours and decorations, as well as various awards that are named for and presented by the lieutenant governor; these are generally created in partnership with another government or charitable organization and linked specifically to their cause. These honours are presented at official ceremonies, which count amongst hundreds of other engagements the lieutenant governor partakes in each year, either as host or guest of honour; the lieutenant governor of British Columbia undertook 350 engagements in 2006 and 390 in 2007.

At these events, the lieutenant governor&#x27;s presence is marked by the lieutenant governor&#x27;s standard, consisting of a blue field bearing the escutcheon of the Arms of Majesty in Right of British Columbia, surmounted by a crown and surrounded by ten gold maple leaves, symbolizing the ten provinces of Canada. Within British Columbia, the lieutenant governor also follows only the sovereign in the province&#x27;s order of precedence, preceding even other members of the Canadian Royal Family and the Canadian monarch&#x27;s federal representative, the governor general of Canada.

==History==

The first British settlement in the area was the Colony of British Columbia, of which the first lieutenant governor was Richard Clement Moody, who had previously served as the first governor of the Falkland Islands. Moody selected the site for and founded New Westminster—the original capital of British Columbia—and established Cariboo Road and Stanley Park. He named Burnaby Lake after his private secretary, Robert Burnaby, and named Port Coquitlam&#x27;s &quot;Mary Hill&quot; after his wife, Mary. Port Moody is named after him.

The original Colony of British Columbia was amalgamated with the Colony of Vancouver Island in 1866. That larger jurisdiction was succeeded by the present-day province of British Columbia, following the territory&#x27;s entry into Canadian Confederation in 1871, when the present office of the lieutenant governor of British Columbia came into being.

Since 1871, 28 lieutenant governors have served the province, including firsts such as David Lam—the first Asian-Canadian lieutenant governor in Canada—and Iona Campagnolo—the first female lieutenant governor of British Columbia. The shortest mandate by a lieutenant governor of British Columbia was Edward Gawler Prior, from 1919 to his death in 1920, while the longest was George Pearkes, from October 1960 to July 1968.

In 1903, before political parties were a part of British Columbia politics, Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière was the last lieutenant governor in Canada to dismiss an incumbent premier, Edward Gawler Prior, from office. Prior had been found to have given an important construction contract to his own hardware business; though, he was later appointed as lieutenant governor himself. In 1952, without a clear majority in the legislative assembly following the general election, Lieutenant Governor Clarence Wallace was required to exercise his personal judgement in selecting the province&#x27;s premier. Though the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF; now the New Democratic Party) held one fewer seat than the Social Credit Party (Socred), Wallace was under pressure to call on the CCF leader to form a government. Wallace, however, went with Socred leader W.A.C. Bennett, which resulted in the start of a 20-year dynasty for the latter.

The provincial election in 2017 resulted in neither the incumbent Liberals, nor the opposition New Democrats (NDP), winning a majority. The balance rested with the Green Party, which eventually agreed to support an NDP minority government with NDP leader John Horgan as premier. Still, Premier Christy Clark refused to resign until she could test the legislative assembly&#x27;s confidence in her. As the vote on the Speech from the Throne is automatically a confidence vote and the speech was voted down, Clark&#x27;s government fell. She advised Lieutenant Governor Judith Guichon to call a new elections, contending that the NDP would be unable to provide a stable government due to the need for one of its members to act as speaker, likely resulting in frequent tied votes that could be broken only by the speaker. Guichon disagreed and refused to dissolve the legislature. Clark then resigned and Guichon invited Horgan to form a government, which was sworn in by Guichon on 18 July.

During Guichon&#x27;s time serving as lieutenant governor, she put a strong focus on the interaction of the Crown in British Columbia with the Indigenous peoples in the province, which she said needed to be defined by &quot;respect, relationships, and responsibility&quot;, stating that the Canadian monarchy was central to the treaty relationship.

<text>A jet injector is a type of medical injecting syringe device used for a method of drug delivery known as jet injection. A narrow, high-pressure stream of liquid is made to penetrate the outermost layer of the skin (stratum corneum) to deliver medication to targeted underlying tissues of the epidermis or dermis (&quot;cutaneous&quot; injection, also known as classical &quot;intradermal&quot; injection), fat (&quot;subcutaneous&quot; injection), or muscle (&quot;intramuscular&quot; injection).

The jet stream is usually generated by the pressure of a piston in an enclosed liquid-filled chamber. The piston is usually pushed by the release of a compressed metal spring, although devices being studied may use piezoelectric effects and other novel technologies to pressurize the liquid in the chamber. The springs of currently marketed and historical devices may be compressed by operator muscle power, hydraulic fluid, built-in battery-operated motors, compressed air or gas, and other means. Gas-powered and hydraulically powered devices may involve hoses that carry compressed gas or hydraulic fluid from separate cylinders of gas, electric air pumps, foot-pedal pumps, or other components to reduce the size and weight of the hand-held part of the system and to allow faster and less-tiring methods to perform numerous consecutive vaccinations.
Jet injectors were used for mass vaccination, and as an alternative to needle syringes for diabetics to inject insulin. However, the World Health Organization no longer recommends jet injectors for vaccination due to risks of disease transmission. Similar devices are used in other industries to inject grease or other fluid.

The term &quot;hypospray&quot;, although better known from its usage in the 1960s television show Star Trek, is attested in the medical literature as early as 1956.

==Types==
A jet injector, also known as a jet gun injector, air gun, or pneumatic injector, is a medical instrument that uses a high-pressure jet of liquid medication to penetrate the skin and deliver medication under the skin without a needle. Jet injectors can be single-dose or multi-dose.

Throughout the years jet injectors have been redesigned to overcome the risk of carrying contamination to successive subjects. To try to stop the risk, researchers placed a single-use protective cap over the reusable nozzle. The protective cap was intended to act as a shield between the reusable nozzle and the patient&#x27;s skin. After each injection the cap would be discarded and replaced with a sterile one. These devices were known as protector cap needle-free injectors or PCNFI. A safety test by Kelly and colleagues (2008) found a PCNFI device failed to prevent contamination. After administering injections to hepatitis B patients, researchers found hepatitis B had penetrated the protective cap and contaminated the internal components of the jet injector, showing that the internal fluid pathway and patient-contacting parts cannot safely be reused.

Researchers developed a new jet injection design by combining the drug reservoir, plunger and nozzle into a single-use disposable cartridge. The cartridge is placed onto the tip of the jet injector and, when activated, a rod pushes the plunger forward. This device is known as a disposable-cartridge jet injector (DCJI).

The International Standards Organization recommended abandoning the use of the name &quot;jet injector&quot;, which is associated with a risk of cross-contamination and rather refer to newer devices as &quot;needle-free injectors&quot;.

===Modern needle-free injector brands===
Since the late 1970s, jet injectors have been increasingly used by diabetics in the United States. These devices have all been spring-loaded. At their peak, jet injectors accounted for 7% of the injector market. Currently, the only model available in the United States is the Injex 23. In the United Kingdom, the Insujet has recently entered the market. As of June 2015, the Insujet is available in the UK and a few select countries.

Researchers from the University of Twente in the Netherlands patented a Jet Injection System, comprising a microfluidic device for jet ejection and a laser-based heating system. A continuous laser beam – also called a continuous-wave laser – heats the liquid to be administered, which is launched in a droplet form across the epidermis and slows down into the tissue below.

==Concerns==
Since the jet injector breaks the barrier of the skin, there is a risk of blood and biological material being transferred from one user to the next. Research on the risks of cross-contamination arose immediately after the invention of jet injection technology.

There are three inherent problems with jet injectors:

===Splash-back===
Splash-back refers to the jet stream penetrating the outer skin at a high velocity, causing the jet stream to ricochet backward and contaminate the nozzle.

Instances of splash-back have been published by several researchers. Samir Mitragrotri visually captured splash-back after discharging a multi-use nozzle jet injector using high-speed microcinematography. Hoffman and colleagues (2001) also observed the nozzle and internal fluid pathway of the jet injector becoming contaminated.

===Fluid suck-back===
Fluid suck-back occurs when blood left on the nozzle of the jet injector is sucked back into the injector orifice, contaminating the next dose to be fired.

The CDC has acknowledged that the most widely used jet injector in the world, the Ped-O-Jet, sucked fluid back into the gun. &quot;After injections, they [CDC] observed fluid remaining on the Ped-O-Jet nozzle being sucked back into the device upon its cocking and refilling for the next injection (beyond the reach of alcohol swabbing or acetone swabbing),&quot; stated Dr. Bruce Weniger.

===Retrograde flow===
Retrograde flow happens after the jet stream penetrates the skin and creates a hole, if the pressure of the jet stream causes the spray, after mixing with tissue fluids and blood, to rebound back out of the hole, against the incoming jet stream and back into the nozzle orifice.

This problem has been reported by numerous researchers.

Hepatitis B can be transmitted by less than one nanolitre so makers of injectors must ensure there is no cross-contamination between applications. The World Health Organization no longer recommends jet injectors for vaccination due to risks of disease transmission.

Numerous studies have found cross-infection of diseases from jet injections. An experiment using mice, published in 1985, showed that jet injectors would frequently transmit the viral infection lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV) from one mouse to another. Another study used the device on a calf, then tested the fluid remaining in the injector for blood. Every injector they tested had detectable blood in a quantity sufficient to pass on a virus such as hepatitis B.

From 1984 to 1985, a weight-loss clinic in Los Angeles administered human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) with a Med-E-Jet injector. A CDC investigation found 57 out of 239 people who had received the jet injection tested positive for hepatitis B.

Jet injectors have also been found to inoculate bacteria from the environment into users. In 1988 a podiatry clinic used a jet injector to deliver local anaesthetic into patients&#x27; toes. Eight of these patients developed infections caused by &quot;Mycobacterium chelonae&quot;. The injector was stored in a container of water and disinfectant between use, but the organism grew in the container. This species of bacteria is sometimes found in tap water, and had been previously associated with infections from jet injectors.

==History==

* 19th century: Workmen in France had accidental jet injections with high-powered grease guns.
* December 18, 1866: Jules-Auguste Béclard presented Dr. Jean Sales-Girons invention, Appareil pour l&#x27;aquapuncture to l&#x27;Académie Impériale de Médecine in Paris. This is the earliest documented jet injector to administer water or medicine under enough pressure to penetrate the skin without the use of a needle.
* 1920s: Diesel engines began to be made in large quantities: thus the start of serious risk of accidental jet-injection by their fuel injectors in workshop accidents.
* 1935: Arnold K. Sutermeister, a mechanical engineer, witnessed a worker injure his hand from a high-pressure jet stream and theorized of using the concept to administer medicine. Sutermeister collaborates with Dr. John Roberts in creating a prototype jet injector.
* 1937: First &quot;published&quot; accidental jet injection by a diesel engine&#x27;s fuel injector.
* 1936: Marshall Lockhart, an engineer, filed a patent for his idea of a jet injector after learning of Sutermeister&#x27;s invention.
* 1947: Lockhart&#x27;s jet injector, known as the Hypospray, was introduced for clinical evaluation by Dr. Robert Hingson and Dr. James Hughes.
* 1951: The Commission on Immunization of the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board requested the Army Medical Service Graduate School to develop &quot;jet injection equipment specifically intended for rapid semiautomatic operation in large-scale immunization programs.&quot; This device became known as the multi-use nozzle jet injector (MUNJI).
* 1954–1967: Dr. Robert Hingson partook in numerous health expeditions with his charity, Brother&#x27;s Brother Foundation. Hingson stated he vaccinated upwards of 2 million people across the globe using various multi-use nozzle jet injectors.
* 1955: Warren and colleagues (1955) reported on the introduction of a prototype multi-dose jet injector, known as the Press-O-Jet, which had successfully undergone clinical testing upon 1,685 soldiers within the U.S. Army.
* 1959: Abram Benenson, the Lieutenant Colonel for the Division of Immunology at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, reported on the development of what became widely known as the Ped-O-Jet. The invention was the collaboration of Dr. Benenson and Aaron Ismach. Ismach was a civilian scientist working for the US Army Medical Equipment and Research Development Laboratory.
* 1961: The Department of the Army made multi-use nozzle jet injectors the standard for administering immunizations.
* 1961: The CDC implemented mass vaccination programs across the United States called Babies and Breadwinners to combat polio. These vaccination events used multi-use nozzle jet injectors.
* 1964: Aaron Ismach invented an intradermal nozzle for the Ped-O-Jet injector, which allowed delivery of the shallower smallpox vaccinations.
*1964: Aaron Ismach was awarded the Exceptional Civilian Service Award at the Eighth Annual Secretary of the Army Awards ceremonies for his invention of the intradermal nozzle.
* 1966: Oscar Banker, an engineer, patented his invention of a portable multi-use nozzle jet injector that utilizes as its energy source. This would become known as the Med-E-Jet. 
* September 1966: The &quot;Star Trek&quot; series started to use its own jet injector device under the name &quot;hypospray&quot;.
* 1967: Nicaraguans undergoing smallpox vaccinations nicknamed the gun-like jet injectors (Ped-O-Jet and Med-E-Jet) as &quot;la pistola de la paz&quot;, meaning &quot;the pistol of peace&quot;. The name &quot;Peace Guns&quot; stuck.
* 1976: The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) published a book called &quot;War on Hunger&quot; which detailed the War Against Smallpox which Ismach&#x27;s Jet Injector gun was used to eradicate the disease in Africa and Asia. The US government spent $150 million a year to prevent its recurrence in North America.
* 1986: A hepatitis B outbreak occurs amongst 57 patients at a Los Angeles clinic due to a Med-E-Jet injector.
* 1997: The US Department of Defense, the jet injector&#x27;s biggest user, announced that it would stop using it for mass vaccinations due to concerns about infection.
* 2003: The US Department of Veterans Affairs recognized for the first time that a veteran acquired Hepatitis C from his military jet injections and awarded service-connection for his disability.
* April 2010: A laser-based reusable microjet injector for transdermal drug delivery was made by Tae-hee Han and Jack J. Yoh.

<text>Andreas Gryphius (; 2 October 161616 July 1664) was a German poet and playwright. With his eloquent sonnets, which contains &quot;The Suffering, Frailty of Life and the World&quot;, he is considered one of the most important Baroque poets of the Germanosphere. He was one of the first improvers of the German language and German poetry.

Gryphius was born and raised in Glogau (Głogów), Duchy of Głogów, Silesia. At the age of 33, he married Rosina Deutschländer, with whom he had six children, Christian, Constantin, Anna Rosine, Theodor, Maria Elisabeth, and Daniel.

==Life==

===Early life===
Andreas Gryphius was the son of Paullus Gryphius, a respected clergyman and a Lutheran archdeacon of Glogau, originally from Uthleben and Paullus&#x27; third wife, Anna (née Eberhardin), who was 32 years younger than her husband, the daughter of a businessman from Fraustadt, the councilor Jonas Deutschländer the Elder (died in 1661) and Anna Sachse. He was born in Großglogau (Głogów). The family name was originally &quot;Greif&quot; and had been Latinised to &quot;Gryphius&quot; by Andreas&#x27; paternal great-grandfather (Peter Greif von Heringen). Left early an orphan and driven from his native town by the troubles of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, he received his schooling in various places, but notably at Freistadt (Polish: Wschowa), where he enjoyed an excellent classical education.

==Career in poetry==
In 1634 he went to Danzig (Polish: Gdańsk) where he met professors Peter Crüger and Johann Mochinger at the Danzig Gymnasium, who introduced Gryphius to the new German language poetry. Crüger had for years close contacts to Martin Opitz, who became known as the &#x27;father of German poetry&#x27;. Greatly influenced by Crüger, he is the only one Gryphius dedicated poems to. Gryphius wrote Latin language poetry, German poems and sonnets.

The same year that Gryphius arrived, the printer Andreas Hünefeld published Martin Opitz&#x27;s &quot;Buch von der deutschen Poeterey&quot; (Book of German Poetry). The same publisher printed Opitz&#x27;s translation &quot;Tetrastichen des Pibrac&quot; (Tetrasticha of Pibrac, or four verse) and &quot;Antigone&quot;. Among Gryphius&#x27; benefactors was the city&#x27;s secretary Michael Borck, who wrote a German version of the life of Jesus Christ. Borck&#x27;s illustrated book is still at the Gdańsk library. Coming from war riddled Silesia, taking refuge at the big international harbor and a Polish city, greatly stimulated Gryphius. In 1635 he published his second epos of &quot;Herodes&quot;, &quot;Dei Vindicis Impetus et Herodis Interitus&quot;. He dedicated this to the city state council.

In 1636, while still in Danzig, he published the &quot;Parnassus renovatus&quot; in praise of his mentor and patron, the eminent jurist Georg Schönborner (1579–1637). Later the same year Gryphius became the tutor of Schönborner&#x27;s two sons, on Schönborner&#x27;s estate near Freystadt, in Silesia (today, Kożuchów, Poland). A highly educated scholar, Schönborner held various government administrative posts and by that time had been honored by Emperor Ferdinand II with the title of Imperial Count Palatine (Hofpfalzgraf). On 30 November 1637, Schönborner recognized Gryphius&#x27;s poetic talent by bestowing upon him the title of &quot;poeta laureatus&quot; and master of philosophy, as well as a patent of nobility (of which Gryphius, however, never made use). Schönborner died less than a month later, on 23 December 1637.

While staying with Schönborner, Gryphius completed his first collection of poems, &quot;Sonnete&quot; (&quot;Sonnets&quot;), which was published in 1637 by Wigand Funck in Lissa (today Leszno, Poland), and is also known as the &quot;Lissaer Sonettbuch&quot;, after the town. The collection of 31 sonnets includes some of his best known poems, such as &quot;Vanitas vanitatum, et omnia vanitas&quot;, later titled &quot;Es ist alles eitel&quot; (All is vanity), about the effects of war and the transitoriness of human life; &quot;Menschliches Elende&quot; (Human misery); and &quot;Trawrklage des verwüsteten Deutschlandes&quot; (Lament of devastated Germany).

In 1632, he had witnessed the pillaging and burning of the Silesian town of Freystadt by Swedish troops, and immortalized the event in his poem &quot;Fewrige Freystadt&quot;. Also in 1637 he went to continue his studies at Leiden, where he remained for six years, both hearing and delivering lectures. Here he fell under the influence of the great Dutch dramatists, Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft and Joost van den Vondel, who largely determined the character of his later dramatic works.

In 1635 with the &quot;Prager Frieden&quot; (Peace of Prague), the Habsburgs took control over in Silesia again and persecuted Protestants and closed their churches. In 1638 Paul Gryphius, the brother of Andreas, received a position as Superindendant at Crossen an der Oder (Krosno Odrzańskie) in Brandenburg from the Elector Georg Wilhelm of Brandenburg. Paul was for several years banned from Silesia for of being a Protestant, and Andreas dedicated and sent him several poems for the start of his new position.

==Travel and dramatic work==
After travelling in France, Italy and South Germany, Gryphius settled in 1647 at Fraustadt, where he began his dramatic work, and in 1650 was appointed syndic of Glogau, a post he held until his death. A short time previously he had been admitted under the title of &quot;The Immortal&quot; into the Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft (&quot;Fruitbearing Society&quot;), a literary society, founded in 1617 by Ludwig, prince of Anhalt-Köthen on the model of the Italian academies.

Gryphius grew up during the Thirty Years&#x27; War and witnessed the destruction of large parts of Germany, which had lasting effects for centuries. Not yet an adult himself, he saw the child of a benefactor (Crüger) die, and prepared another (Schönborner) for his approaching death. It is therefore not surprising that some morbid disposition, and his melancholy temperament, fostered by the misfortunes of his childhood is largely reflected in his lyrics, of which the most famous are the &quot;Kirchhofsgedanken&quot; (&quot;Cemetery thoughts&quot;, 1656). His best works are his comedies, one of which, &quot;Absurda Comica, oder Herr Peter Squentz&quot; (1663), is evidently based on the comic episode of Pyramus and Thisbe in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. &quot;Die geliebte Dornrose&quot; (1660), written in Silesian dialect, contains many touches of natural simplicity and grace, and ranks high among the comparatively small number of German dramas of the 17th century. &quot;Horribilicribrifax&quot; (1663), founded on the &quot;Miles Gloriosus&quot; of Plautus, is a rather labored attack on pedantry. Besides these three comedies, Gryphius wrote five tragedies. In all of them the tendency is to become wild and bombastic, but he had the merit of at least attempting to work out artistically conceived plans, and there are occasional flashes both of passion and of imagination. His models seem to have been Seneca and Vondel. In &quot;Carolus Stuardus&quot; (1657) he dramatised events of his own day, namely the death of King Charles I of England; his other tragedies are &quot;Leo Armenius&quot; (1650); &quot;Katharina von Georgien&quot; (1657), &quot;Cardenio und Celinde&quot; (1657) and &quot;Papinianus&quot; (1659). No German dramatic writer before him had risen to so high a level, nor had he worthy successors until about the middle of the 18th century.

<text>NJ Transit Rail Operations is the rail division of NJ Transit. It operates commuter rail service in New Jersey, with most service centered on transportation to and from New York City, Hoboken, and Newark. NJ Transit also operates rail service in Orange and Rockland counties in New York under contract to Metro-North Railroad. The commuter rail lines saw riders in , making it the third-busiest commuter railroad in North America and the longest commuter rail system in North America by route length. 

== Network and infrastructure ==
The lines operated by NJ Transit were formerly operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad, Central Railroad of New Jersey, New York and Long Branch Railroad, and Erie Lackawanna Railroad, most of which date from the mid-19th century. From the 1960s onward, the New Jersey Department of Transportation began funding the commuter lines. By 1976, the lines were all operated by Conrail under contract to NJDOT. The system took its current form in 1983, when NJ Transit took over all commuter service in New Jersey. NJ Transit Rail Operations is divided into the Hoboken Division and the Newark Division. The two networks were not integrated until the opening of Secaucus Junction in 2003, which enabled passengers to transfer between lines bound for New York and Hoboken.

=== Lines ===
As of 2022, NJ Transit&#x27;s commuter rail network consists of 12 lines and 165 stations, primarily concentrated in northern New Jersey, with one line running between Atlantic City and Philadelphia.

==== Current lines ====
Operations are in two divisions:
*Hoboken Division, formerly operated by the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, runs from Hoboken Terminal or through Newark – Broad Street and includes Midtown Direct service via the Kearny Connection. Most station platforms are low-level.
*Newark Division, formerly operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad, Central Railroad of New Jersey and New York and Long Branch Railroad, operates through Newark Penn Station via the Northeast Corridor, with most trains continuing to New York Penn Station. This division also includes the Atlantic City Line formerly operated by the Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines. Most station platforms are high-level.


==== Freight usage ====

Although NJ Transit itself does not carry freight, NJTR allows freight service to be operated over its lines via trackage rights agreements with several railroads. Conrail Shared Assets Operations (CSAO), CSX, Norfolk Southern (NS) and several short lines (Cape May Seashore Lines (CMSL), Dover and Delaware River Railroad (DD), Morristown &amp; Erie Railway (M&amp;E), and Southern Railroad of New Jersey (SRNJ) currently have trackage rights contracts to operate freight service on NJ Transit lines. The Morristown &amp; Erie Railway can only use NJT trackage to get between its owned trackage; it cannot serve customers on NJ Transit trackage. A similar situation exists for Conrail on the Atlantic City Line.

Below is a list of NJ Transit lines and freight lines that operate on them:

*Morristown Line: DD, M&amp;E
*Montclair-Boonton Line: DD, M&amp;E
*Main Line: NS, M&amp;E
*Bergen County Line: NS, M&amp;E
*Pascack Valley Line: NS
*Raritan Valley Line: CSAO
*North Jersey Coast Line: CSAO
*Atlantic City Line: CSAO, SRNJ

==== Non-passenger lines ====
NJTR also owns several lines not used for regular passenger service. These lines were purchased by the New Jersey Department of Transportation in the late 1970s for railbanking purposes, with ownership transferring to NJ Transit upon its creation in 1979. These lines are either leased for freight/tourist service, interim rail trail use, or remain derelict:
*Harrison-Kingsland Branch: derelict
*Raritan Valley Line:
**High Bridge-Bloomsbury: NS
**Bloomsbury-Phillipsburg: trackage removed due to construction of Interstate 78 in 1989
*Red Bank-South Lakewood: Conrail Shared Assets Operations (CSAO), Delaware and Raritan River Railroad
*Woodmansie-Winslow Junction: derelict
*Beesley&#x27;s Point Secondary:
**Winslow Junction-Palermo/Beesley&#x27;s Point: CSAO, Cape May Seashore Lines
**Palermo-Ocean City: leased to city of Ocean City in 1999 for use as interim Ocean City Bike Path rail trail
*Tuckahoe-Cape May: Cape May Seashore Lines, Southern Railroad of New Jersey
*HX Interlocking (Hackensack River)-Croxton Yard: realigned for Secaucus Junction, used as yard lead by NS
*Freehold-Farmingdale: derelict
*Freehold-Matawan: leased to Monmouth County Park System until 2020 as interim section of Henry Hudson Trail

=== Ownership ===
NJT owns most of its tracks, infrastructure, bridges, tunnels and signals. The exceptions are:
*Atlantic City Line – Philadelphia 30th Street Station to Frankford Junction (owned by Amtrak) and Frankford Junction to Pennsauken Delair Junction (owned by Conrail)
*Northeast Corridor Line – entire line except Morrisville Yard (owned by Amtrak)
*Port Jervis Line – Suffern to Port Jervis (owned by Norfolk Southern and leased by Metro-North)
*Raritan Valley Line – Aldene to Hunter (owned by Conrail)

=== Yards and maintenance ===
NJ Transit&#x27;s main storage and maintenance facility is the Meadows Maintenance Complex in Kearny, New Jersey. Other major yard facilities are located at Hoboken Terminal. Amtrak&#x27;s Sunnyside Yard in Queens, New York serves as a layover facility for trains to New York Penn Station. Additional yards are located at outlying points along the lines. These include:

*Main and Bergen County Lines:
**Waldwick Yard
**Suffern Yard
*Montclair-Boonton Line:
**Great Notch Yard, Little Falls
*Morris and Essex Lines:
**Gladstone Yard
**Summit Yard
**Dover Yard
**Port Morris Yard
*North Jersey Coast Line:
**Long Branch Yard
**Bay Head Yard
*Northeast Corridor:
**Morrisville Yard, Morrisville, PA (near the Trenton Transit Center)
**County Yard, New Brunswick (near Jersey Avenue)
**Hudson Yard, Harrison (Serves mostly Raritan Valley Line trains)
*Pascack Valley Line:
**Woodbine Yard, Spring Valley, NY
*Port Jervis Line:
**Port Jervis Yard, Port Jervis, NY
*Raritan Valley Line:
**Raritan Yard
**Hudson Yard, Harrison (Shared with Northeast Corridor)

NJT has a fleet of maintenance crews and vehicles that repair tracks, spread ballast, deliver supplies and inspect infrastructure. There are eight non-revenue work diesels used for these purposes.

=== Movable bridges ===
NJT utilizes numerous moveable bridges:

*Dock Bridge, Newark (Passaic River) – Northeast Corridor Line (vertical lift) (&quot;owned and operated by Amtrak&quot;)
*Portal Bridge, Secaucus (Hackensack River) – Northeast Corridor Line (swing) (&quot;owned and operated by Amtrak&quot;)

<doc id="1018279" wikidata="Q1053964" url="?curid=1018279" title="Memorandum of understanding">
<text>A memorandum of understanding (MoU) is a type of agreement between two (bilateral) or more (multilateral) parties. It expresses a convergence of will between the parties, indicating an intended common line of action. It is often used either in cases where parties do not imply a legal commitment or in situations where the parties cannot create a legally enforceable agreement. It is a more formal alternative to a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement.

Whether a document constitutes a binding contract depends only on the presence or absence of well-defined legal elements in the text proper of the document (the so-called &quot;four corners&quot;). The required elements are offer and acceptance, consideration, and the intention to be legally bound (&quot;animus contrahendi&quot;). In the US, the specifics can differ slightly depending on whether the contract is for goods (falls under the Uniform Commercial Code) or services (falls under the common law of the state).

Many companies and government agencies use MoUs to define a relationship between departments, agencies or closely held companies.
== In private enterprise ==
In business, an MoU is typically a legally non-binding agreement between two (or more) parties, outlining terms and details of a mutual understanding or agreement, noting each party&#x27;s requirements and responsibilities—but without establishing a formal, legally enforceable contract (though an MoU is often a first step towards the development of a formal contract).

== In government and public affairs ==
In the United Kingdom, the term MoU is commonly used to refer to an agreement between parts of The Crown. The term is often used in the context of devolution, for example the 1999 concordat between the central Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Scottish Environment Directorate. 

MoUs can also be used between a government agency and a non-commercial, non-governmental organization.

==In public international law==
In international relations, MoUs fall under the broad category of treaties and should be registered in the United Nations treaty collection. In practice and in spite of the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs&#x27; insistence that registration be done to avoid &#x27;secret diplomacy&#x27;, MoUs are sometimes kept confidential. As a matter of law, the title of MoU does not necessarily mean the document is binding or not binding under international law. To determine whether a particular MoU is meant to be a legally binding document (i.e., a treaty), one needs to examine the parties’ intent as well as the signatories&#x27; position (e.g., Minister of Foreign Affairs vs. Minister of Environment). A careful analysis of the wording will also clarify the exact nature of the document. The International Court of Justice has provided some insight into the determination of the legal status of a document in the landmark case of &quot;Qatar v. Bahrain&quot;, 1 July 1994.

===Advantages===
One advantage of MoUs over more formal instruments is that, because obligations under international law may be avoided, they can often be put into effect without requiring legislative approval. Hence, MoUs are often used to modify and adapt existing treaties, in which case these MoUs have factual treaty status. The decision concerning ratification, however, is determined by the parties&#x27; internal law and depends to a large degree on the subject agreed upon. MoUs that are kept confidential (i.e., not registered with the UN) cannot be enforced before any UN organ, and it may be concluded that no obligations under international law have been created.

Although MoUs in the multilateral field are seldom seen, the transnational aviation agreements are actually MoUs.

===Examples===
Examples include:
* The &quot;Memorandum of Understanding Relating to the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems on May 26, 1972&quot; signed by the United States (Richard Nixon) and the Soviet Union (Leonid Brezhnev) updating the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
* The &quot;Memorandum of Understanding on Hijacking of Aircraft and Vessels and Other Offenses&quot; between the US and Cuba, meant to criminalize hijacking in both countries (February 3, 1973)
* The agreement between the Cayman Islands and Cuba, under which Cayman immigration officers must give Cuban refugees two choices: disembark and be repatriated back to Cuba, or continue on their way with no help.
* The Agreed Framework between the U.S. and North Korea over nuclear weaponry on October 21, 1994
* The Oil-for-Food programme, for which Iraq signed an MoU in 1996
* The agreement between the government of Indonesia and the GAM in the Aceh peace process, 15 August 2005.
* The agreement between the UK and Jordan, Libya and Lebanon regarding potential extradition of suspects (commonly terrorist suspects), who, if they are to be tried, must be tried fairly and in a manner similar to the European Convention on Human Rights; for example, withholding from using evidence obtained through the use of torture (Article 3). Such an understanding has been criticised for its inability to be legally enforced. This has been highlighted in the current deportation process of the suspected terrorist Abu Qatada, who is wanted by Jordan in connection with a terrorist attack. However, at present, the Court of Appeal has rejected the UK Government&#x27;s appeal based on the Court&#x27;s concern of Jordan obtaining evidence potentially incriminating Qatada through the use of torture.
* The &quot;Memoranda of Understanding on Labour Cooperation&quot; between the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Singapore and New Zealand on 2008, in parallel with their respective free trade agreements
* The Under2 Coalition is a 2015 memorandum of understanding which sets climate change mitigation goals for jurisdictions with over 1 billion residents.
* On December 2, 2019, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Nation signed an MoU to co-manage the Sanilac Petroglyphs Historic State Park. The agreement marks the first state-tribal co-management of a Michigan state park.

== Examples ==
Examples from U.S. law include:
* The generic sample template for interagency agreements with the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) from the U.S. Department of Justice.

Examples from international development contexts include: 
* MoUs developed by grassroots organizations working with municipalities in South Africa to improve land and housing for the urban poor
* The MoU used by NGOs and the Bangladeshi government to determine tasks under the National Tuberculosis Control Programme
* The MoU used by city authorities and NGOs in Harare, Zimbabwe to collaboratively document and upgrade slums

<doc id="1018286" wikidata="Q969761" url="?curid=1018286" title="Capri-Sun">
<text>Capri-Sun ( , ) is a brand of juice concentrate–based drinks manufactured by the German company Wild and regional licensees. Rudolf Wild invented the drink in 1969 and introduced it in West Germany as Capri-Sonne (a name retired in favor of the English name in 2017). It has come to be sold in over 100 countries, with licensees including Kraft Foods in the United States (as Capri Sun) and Coca-Cola Europacific Partners in parts of Europe. It is one of the most popular juice brands in the world; , roughly 6 billion pouches are sold per year globally.

Since its launch, Capri-Sun has been packaged in laminated foil vacuum Doy-N-Pack pouches, with which the brand has become strongly associated. In the United States, these pouches predated the advent of Tetra Brik, in an era when fruit juice was usually sold in large containers. The pouch design has stayed largely the same, but changes in some markets have included transparent bottoms and paper straws, while other container types have been introduced for some products. Capri-Sun is available in varying ranges of flavors in different countries, targeting different national flavor profiles. Globally, its best-known flavor is Orange.

Capri-Sun&#x27;s main products are high in sugar content, although lower than many competitors. Characterizations of the juice drinks as &quot;all-natural&quot; have led to conflict in several countries between consumer advocates who highlight the high sugar content and low juice percentage and Capri-Sun and its licensees, who have generally maintained that the term correctly describes the ingredients. Disputes over sugar content and &quot;all-natural&quot; status have led to two lawsuits in the United States and the removal of the brand&#x27;s main line from Tesco shelves in the United Kingdom.

In France, Capri-Sun has figured prominently in rap songs and has been noted as a drink of choice in poor areas. Capri-Sun is often marketed to children, which has earned it a negative award from the consumer advocacy group Foodwatch. In the United States, Kraft and its former parent company, the tobacco conglomerate Philip Morris Cos. ( Altria), have successfully marketed Capri Sun using strategies developed for selling cigarettes to children. American parents often misidentify Capri Sun as healthy, and it is one of the most favorably rated brands among Generation Z Americans.

== Brand history ==

=== Origins and global overview ===

Rudolf Wild founded Rudolf Wild &amp; Co. (better known as Wild) in Heidelberg, Germany, in 1931. After World War II, Rudolf Wild created Libella, which, according to Rudolf&#x27;s son Hans-Peter Wild, was Germany&#x27;s first branded beverage with a fruit-juice base. Libella was successful, and Wild pursued several other ventures, including Capri-Sonne, which was developed in the 1960s. Restrictions on color additives at the time in West Germany led to less visually appealing soft drinks, incentivizing opaque packaging. Rudolf Wild &amp; Co. engaged with Thimonnier, a French company that primarily manufactured sewing machines, for rights to use their patented pouch design and pouch-making machines. According to Hans-Peter, Rudolf Wild &amp; Co., they did not obtain exclusive rights to Thimonnier&#x27;s patents but bought all of their machines to make the pouches. After initial issues with spoilage and stains were resolved, the product debuted in West Germany in 1969. The name references the Italian island of Capri, a fashionable yet affordable vacation destination for Germans of the 1960s. Capri inspired many other product names around the same time and place, such as the Ford Capri, Capri pants, and Langnese Capri ice cream; it was branding that appealed to, and represented, bourgeois indulgence.
At the initiative of Hans-Peter Wild, champion boxer Muhammad Ali began promoting the brand in 1978. SiSi-Werke, the Wild subsidiary responsible for Capri-Sonne, said that the deal included one product crate a week for four years. The endorsement—in which Ali said Capri-Sonne was, like him, &quot;the greatest of all time&quot;—led to a significant increase in sales. By 1982, Capri-Sun was sold in 23 countries, in 19 of which it was the most popular fruit juice. Availability rose to 52 countries by 1991.

Capri Sun GmbH (renamed from SiSi-Werke in 2018) is organized and headquartered in Germany and is a subsidiary of Swiss companies Capri Sun AG and Capri Sun Group Holding AG and of German company Wild. When Rudolf Wild &amp; Co. went public in 2009, Hans-Peter Wild excluded Capri Sun AG from the offering to avoid losing control of it. Wild licenses the brand to different companies, which bottle Capri-Sun in 18 countries; Wild subsidiary INDAG supplies the various bottling plants. Another subsidiary, Pouch Partners, which has served as Capri-Sun&#x27;s pouch supplier, was sold to CCL Industries in 2023 and rebranded as CCL Specialty Pouches.

In 2009, Capri-Sun&#x27;s global sales of 1.106 billion liters of absolute volume (243 million imp gal; 292 million U.S. gal) ranked third in the world among fruit juice brands, after Tropicana and Minute Maid. At that time, per capita consumption in the United States and Germany was around 6 Capri-Sun pouches per year, while the French island of Réunion—a major Capri-Sun exporter where the juice sells for the same price as water—had the highest per capita consumption at 9.6. , Capri-Sun sells an estimated 6 billion pouches per year globally. , &quot;Forbes&quot; reports sales in more than 100 countries, netting roughly $500 million per year.

=== Europe ===

After initial poor sales under RHM Foods, Coca-Cola Schweppes Beverages took over production of Capri-Sun in the United Kingdom in 1994. Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE), which bought Coca-Cola Schweppes in 1997, began selling the drink in France in 2007. As the number of children in Germany aged 6 to 12 decreased, SiSi-Werke developed a resealable spouted pouch aimed toward older demographics, which debuted in Germany and the United Kingdom by 2009. By 2014, CCE was selling Capri-Sun in France, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom; its successors Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP) continued selling the brand. In Ukraine, Capri-Sun is licensed to . In France, 213 million pouches were sold in 2016, a 24% increase from the previous year. Sales increased another 20% to 250 million the next year.

In February 2017, SiSi-Werke announced that it would rename &quot;Capri-Sonne&quot; to &quot;Capri-Sun&quot; in Germany, the last country to have retained the original name. The brand faced some criticism for the change, some of it lighthearted in tone; they did not rule out reintroducing the name later. Three months later, Capri Sun Group&#x27;s CEO reported no negative impact on sales. Starting in 2018, Capri Sun Group began assuming direct control of more of its distribution, starting with Switzerland, Austria, the Middle East, China, and Poland. Citing a desire to be more &quot;agile and responsive&quot;, in 2023 it announced an end to its agreement with CCEP (covering Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom), with a gradual transition to begin in March 2024. It hired an additional 70 employees for the CCEP transition.

=== North America ===

==== 1979–1991: Shasta Beverages ====
In 1979, Shasta Beverages (then a part of Consolidated Foods) began to license the drink from Wild in the United States under the name &quot;Capri Sun&quot;. After two promising test runs in Buffalo, New York, and Atlanta, Georgia, Shasta began a rolling expansion, starting with the Midwestern and Southeastern United States in 1980 and 1981.

When Shasta introduced the product in the United States, its single-serving packaging was unusual in contrast with the cans that dominated the fruit juice market. Despite initial issues on the rollout, the packaging was light, durable, blunt, long-lasting, freezable, and insular. The patented design, trademarked under the name Doy-N-Pack and exclusively licensed by Shasta from Wild, soon faced a competitor in aseptic &quot;brick packaging&quot; like Tetra Brik. Both proved popular in stores, and Doy-N-Pack would usher in the use of pouches for single-serving food and beverage containers in the United States.

Shasta intended the product for children around 7 to 12; its marketing director for new products told a journalist, &quot;Adults have a mental block about putting the straw in—they try to be careful, and it just doesn&#x27;t work.&quot; Instead of general advertising, Shasta&#x27;s marketing placed image spots in kids&#x27; magazines such as &quot;DuckTales&quot; and &quot;Sports Illustrated for Kids&quot;, building brand loyalty based on promotional offers, word of mouth, and child-oriented package design. Early marketing emphasized the product as all-natural, a designation that was met with some criticism. By 1982, it had a 10% market share where it was available and was aiming for a 15–20% share against competitors Hi-C and Hawaiian Punch, which were about half its price. Most of Capri Sun&#x27;s early market share gains came at the expense of small brands.

In 1983, the Capri Sun brand brought Shasta $28 million in sales. In 1985, Sara Lee (the former Consolidated Foods) sold Shasta to National Beverage. Capri Sun Inc., a dedicated subsidiary, was established to market Capri Sun in the 1980s, headquartered in San Mateo, California, with factories in nearby Fresno and in Granite City, Illinois.

==== 1991–present: Kraft Foods ====
In December 1991, Kraft General Foods announced a buyout of Capri Sun Inc. for $155 million ($ million in ), making it part of General Foods USA. Kraft&#x27;s acquisition of Capri Sun was expected to strengthen the former&#x27;s share in the juices and drinks market and increase the latter&#x27;s marketing power. The acquisition covered marketing rights in the United States (extending to Puerto Rico), Canada, and Mexico, the former two of which Kraft retains rights in .

Kraft&#x27;s parent company, Philip Morris Cos. (later renamed Altria), had been barred from marketing cigarettes to children, but had accrued significant experience in selling to young people before the ban was implemented. To make use of this expertise, they acquired sugary drink brands, including Capri Sun, Kool-Aid, and Tang. The campaign they created emphasized flashy colors and beach scenes, evoking a bright and fun-seeming &quot;California cool&quot;; later, they would switch to a sporty theme. In 1994, Philip Morris added Capri Sun to Lunchables, prepackaged lunch sets for schoolchildren. By 2006, marketing techniques had gone online as well, including a website where children under the age of 13 could submit photos for a chance to win a vacation for their families or send Capri Sun–themed greeting cards. These techniques were extremely successful: by 1996, Capri Sun was selling 26% more each year than the last, and sales had risen to over $230 million from around $100 million in 1991. This rise was also attributed to improvements in manufacturing efficiency. In 2008, Capri Sun went from projecting a 5% drop in sales to a 17% increase because of a &quot;Respect the Pouch&quot; campaign aimed at 6–12 year-olds. A 2019 review in &quot;The BMJ&quot;, which criticized the health effects of marketing sugary drinks to children, found that the marketing techniques introduced by Philip Morris were still in use, even after Kraft became independent of it in 2007.

In the 2020s, Capri Sun has been noted for its marketing to parents. In 2020, Kraft used the Granite City plant to manufacture pouches of filtered water labeled &quot;we&#x27;re sorry it&#x27;s not juice&quot;, donating 5 million pouches to schools in the Granite City area and Chicagoland. The accompanying ad campaign, according to &quot;Ad Age&quot;, was targeted towards parents in the area who were concerned about COVID-19 pandemic safety restrictions shutting down drinking fountains. In 2022, the company released an advertisement more directly targeted at parents in light of new regulations, starring a character named &quot;Juicio&quot;. The character, modeled after the male leads of romance novels (such as those modeled by Fabio), appears onscreen in-character for long enough to try and disinterest children viewers and then changes tack to pitch Capri Sun to the adults still watching. This was not their first foray into marketing to parents: under Philip Morris Cos., Capri Sun slightly changed the formula to include juice concentrate, which allowed them to include &quot;Natural fruit drink. No artificial flavors.&quot; on the packaging.

=== Africa and Asia ===
In 1980, Capri-Sun established a factory in Nigeria. the brand is licensed there by Chi Limited, a Coca-Cola Company subsidiary. A second African factory was established in Viana, Angola, in 2013. In 2012, SDU Beverages of India agreed to produce Capri-Sun there, with distribution rights in Bangladesh, the Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. SDU has produced pouches from a factory in Hyderabad since 2014. In L&#x27;Étang-Salé on Réunion, a French island in the Indian Ocean, Grand Sud Productions has operated a factory since 2004, which also distributes to Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, and Tahiti. By 2016, the factory had produced more pouches than either Angola or India.
Capri-Sun products first became available in China in 2005 but did not spread beyond the Beijing area until 2015, when Reignwood Group partnered with Capri-Sun to expand nationwide. Their factory in the Beijing Yanqi Economic Development Area has a capacity of 650 million pouches per year. According to &quot;China Daily&quot;, Capri-Sun sold 80 million pouches in China in 2015. Agthia Group began producing Capri-Sun in the United Arab Emirates in 2009, also selling to the rest of the Gulf Cooperation Council, excluding Saudi Arabia. Agthia discontinued their sale of Capri-Sun in 2020.

=== Contents ===
A Capri-Sun executive told &quot;China Daily&quot; in 2016 that they produce 27 flavors worldwide. The best-known flavor globally is Orange. In the United States, an initial roster of Apple, Fruit Punch, Lemonade, and Orange has expanded to include Mountain Cooler, Pacific Cooler, Strawberry Kiwi, Tropical Punch, and Wild Cherry. Options vary by country: In France , for instance, the only flavors in the main line are Classic (orange) and Red Multifruit and Yellow Multifruit organic (&quot;&quot;) flavors; Orange, Tropical, Blackcurrant, and Cherry are sold in the United Kingdom ; and the Chinese market has Orange, White Grape, Pear, and Peach Apple. Flavor profile also varies: German fruit flavors are riper than French ones. Flavors in China, Mexico, and the United Arab Emirates are sweeter than those in Europe, which Capri-Sun says is to cater to local tastes; likewise, Hungarian cherry flavors are more sour than elsewhere.

Flavor notes

In addition to the main line of juice concentrate–based beverages, American Capri Sun products have included four no-added-sugar lines—100% Juice, Fruit Refreshers, Fruit &amp; Veggie Blends (previously Super V), and Organic—and Roarin&#x27; Waters, a line of flavored waters. The United Kingdom has its flavored water line, Fruity Water (sold in Mango Passionfruit and Blackcurrant). A &quot;No Added Sugar&quot; version debuted there in 2015, in 2020 becoming &quot;No Added Sugar Nothing Artificial&quot; through use of stevia as a sweetener; in 2023, Capri-Sun began replacing it with &quot;Zero Added Sugar&quot;, which contains sucralose. Fruit Crush, another no-added-sugar line, is sold in France in Apple Strawberry and Tropical flavors. Capri-Sun squash (concentrated syrup) is sold in the United Kingdom and Germany. Sisi-Werke introduced an organic variety of the drink in 2011.

A 2009 comparison of various flavored drinks published by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health classified Capri Sun Strawberry Kiwi in the least healthy tier, alongside all of the other surveyed fruit punch and fruit juice drinks. Drinks in this tier, which had a classification requirement of more than 12 grams (2.9 teaspoons) of sugar per 12 fluid ounces (.35L), were recommended for consumption only &quot;sparingly and infrequently&quot;. At 34 grams (8.1 tsp) of sugar, the drink&#x27;s sugar content was the lowest in the fruit drinks category. Capri Sun Lemon Lime, a sports drink with 20 grams (4.8 tsp) of sugar per 12 ounces, was also placed in the least healthy tier. In 2015, facing declining sales, Kraft switched the main Capri Sun line from high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) to regular sugar and switched the Roarin&#x27; Waters flavored water brand from HFCS and sucralose to sugar and stevia, dropping the sugar content from 30g per 12 ounces to 26g. In 2022, Capri Sun cut the sugar content of its pouches by just under half by adding monk fruit concentrate. The same year, CCEP changed the composition of some of its Capri-Sun flavors to be compliant with the United Kingdom&#x27;s new rules on food high in fat, salt, and sugar.

In January 2007 a Florida woman, backed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, filed suit against Kraft for deceptive packaging, alleging that its usage of HFCS made its claimed &quot;all-natural&quot; status inaccurate. Kraft announced a day later that they would cease labeling Capri Sun that way as part of a planned reformulation and repackaging, replacing the words with &quot;no artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives&quot;. Tesco, the largest supermarket chain in the United Kingdom, announced in 2015 that it would stop selling Capri-Sun pouches with added sugar, as part of an initiative that also affected competitors Ribena and Rubicon; &quot;The Guardian&quot; characterized the move as an unprecedented action against branded sugary drink suppliers. In January 2023, a class action was filed in the United States, disputing the &quot;no artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives&quot; tagline in light of Capri Sun apple juice&#x27;s incorporation of citric acid.

=== Packaging ===

Capri-Sun drinks are stored in laminate foil pouches made of aluminum, polyester, and polyethylene, usually in volume. The distinctive Doy-N-Pack pouches were developed by Rudolf Wild &amp; Co. in collaboration with Thimonnier. The pouches have become a key part of Capri-Sun&#x27;s brand identity, and their advent in the United States, where Tetra Brik packaging had yet to debut, played a major role in popularizing stand-up pouches. In the United States, the pouches, sold in packs of 10, were initially double the price of their 46-US-fluid-ounce (1.4 L) competitors, but over time stand-up pouches have become cheaper than alternatives. The Doy-N-Pack patents expired in the 1990s. Around 1998, stand-up pouches overtook aseptic &quot;brick&quot; packaging as the more common format for food and beverages. 

Capri-Suns were introduced with plastic-wrapped plastic straws. After England banned single-use plastic straws in 2020, Capri-Sun introduced paper straws to its pouches in the United Kingdom, a move it said was environmentally friendly. Capri-Sun drew some criticism for the straws&#x27; inability to pierce the pouch in opening the drink and the still-existing plastic wrapping on the straw, which Capri-Sun said was required under British law.

SiSi-Werke attempted to secure trademarks for eight of its pouch designs in the European Union (although not the original pouch shape), in the context of fruit drinks and fruit juices. The European Court of Justice, which has consistently rejected trademarks based on product shape, rejected the request in 2006. The shape is trademarked in Germany, where SiSi-Werke has won multiple court cases defending it. Capri Sun GmbH has filed some lawsuits in the United States to defend its trademark on the pouch design, securing a $650,000 licensing fee from Faribault Foods in one case. In 2017, Capri Sun GmbH sued the pouch manufacturer American Beverage, claiming that the pouches it supplied to SunnyD and 23 other brands constituted trademark infringement. In April 2022, U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer found conflicting evidence for Capri Sun GmbH&#x27;s claim that the pouch design was regularly associated with Capri Sun by consumers. The parties reached a settlement-in-principle in October 2023 on the eve of the trial.

After a series of instances in which mold was found in its pouches, Kraft in 2014 introduced clear bottoms, both to assuage concerns about mold and emphasize the lack of artificial colors, which internal research showed most consumers were unaware of. Occasional mold reports have continued, including in a viral 2021 TikTok in which a father shows the mold through a pouch&#x27;s clear bottom. Kraft stresses that the mold is naturally occurring, and may arise due to small punctures. Kraft permanently reverted to foil bottoms in 2022, citing supply chain issues. The same year, Kraft recalled over 5,000 Wild Cherry pouches after discovering some were contaminated with cleaning supplies.

The packaging of Capri-Sun has been the subject of scrutiny. In 2015, U.S. environmental activist groups started a campaign to make Kraft rethink its packaging of Capri Sun, claiming that the packages are not easily recycled, resulting in 1.4 billion pouches littered annually. Capri Sun pouch recycling is done by TerraCycle, founded in 2001, but according to environmental groups, only 2% of pouches are recycled this way. In Germany, Capri-Sun purchases a recycling guarantee from the aluminum industry (which does the recycling), getting a Green Dot on every pouch and box of pouches. A 2001 essay by Niklas Maak, however, termed Capri-Sonne the &quot;antichrist of the environmentalists&quot; in 1980s Germany for its 12% juice content, as well as the packaging materials. &quot;More waste is not possible for of aqueous liquid&quot;, he wrote. 

In addition to the well-known Doy-N-Pack pouch, Capri-Sun comes in other packaging in various markets. Products targeting older demographics have included a resealable pouch with spout and safety cap, and in the United States a 16.5-US-fl-oz (0.5 L) aluminum &quot;bottle can&quot; manufactured in Japan by . The squash lines are sold in one-liter plastic bottles.

== Impact ==
=== Health and public perception ===
At the same time that Philip Morris Cos. and Kraft marketed Capri Sun to children, child obesity rates in the United States began rising, a phenomenon attributed in part to the rise in sugary drinks consumption across the board. Food industry advertising, including the marketing of sugary drinks to children, has been linked to adverse effects on diet. A 2013 online poll from Foodwatch, a European consumer protection group, resulted in Capri-Sun receiving a &quot;Golden Windbag&quot; award for perceived deceptive advertising to children. Capri-Sun denied that its advertising was targeted towards children.

Parents who respond to surveys tend to overrate the health value of Capri Sun and underestimate its harmful additives. A 2015 study in &quot;Public Health Nutrition&quot; on American parents&#x27; attitudes towards sugary drinks found that 36% of surveyed parents with children between the ages of 2 and 17 rated Capri Sun as &quot;somewhat&quot; or &quot;very healthy&quot;; 48% say that they gave the drink to their children in that age group. Black and Hispanic parents were significantly more likely to rate Capri Sun as healthy than white parents, and the rating was higher than sugary fruit drinks as a category, which only 30% of parents gave the same rating. Regarding Roarin&#x27; Waters, 39% rated the same, but only 16% said they give their children a drink. Hispanic parents were significantly more likely than white parents to rate the product as healthy, although black parents were not. Roarin&#x27; Waters was one of a few products to be rated less healthy than its category overall; 48% rated flavored water drinks as healthy. The study concluded that those parents may have selected Capri Sun Roarin&#x27; Waters because they considered it a healthier option. A 2021 survey published in &quot;Pediatric Obesity&quot; found that most parents with young children correctly guessed that the Fruit Punch and Roarin&#x27; Waters flavors had added sugar, but a majority did not accurately guess that Roarin&#x27; Waters contained non-nutritive sweeteners. Only 3.1% of respondents who looked at the front packaging of Roarin&#x27; Waters correctly assessed that it contained no juice, and that number increased to a slight majority for those who viewed an information panel about the drink. Niklas Maak criticized the trend of Capri-branded items in West Germany at the time it was launched, terming it a flashy way to sell poor-quality products, and specifically criticized the Capri-Sonne packaging as difficult to handle and use.

In 2015, author Josephine Lébard noted Capri-Sun&#x27;s popularity, along with that of SunnyD, in Clichy-sous-Bois, a banlieue near Paris—indicative of the drink&#x27;s broad popularity in poorer areas in France. A representative of Coca-Cola France told &quot;Slate.fr&quot; in 2018 that 87% of families with children under 15 recognized the Capri-Sun brand. A 2021 report from the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health found that the average black child in the United States between the ages of 6 and 11 viewed an ad for Capri-Sun 21 times in 2018; for a white child in the same age group, that number was 11. 

A 2022 Morning Consult survey of American Generation Z adults ranked Capri Sun in 17th place out of over 4,000 on a list of their most favored brands, rated favorably by 77% of respondents. Capri Sun was also one of the brands with the largest differential between Gen Z and older peers; the brand&#x27;s favorability rating with Gen Z was 16 percentage points higher than the U.S. adult population at large, 19th highest in the brands surveyed, and 7 percentage points higher than the Millennial (Gen Y) respondents, for 16th place.

=== Reception ===
A 2022 review of fruit punch drinks in the &quot;Marin Independent Journal&quot; gave Capri Sun All Natural Fruit Punch two of four stars, noting its lower sugar content compared to other listed sugary drinks but criticizing its taste as &quot;watery&quot; and not evocative of the fruits depicted on the label. Marnie Shure of &quot;The Takeout&quot;, reviewing Capri Sun fruit punch after the addition of monk fruit, wrote that the sweetness had now become the primary flavor, rather than notes of actual fruit as before, and assessed a perhaps 5% increase in tartness, but complimented the lack of aftertaste she associated with most sweeteners. Chad Eschman of &quot;VinePair&quot; reviewed Capri Sun flavors as they relate to creating mixers; reviews included positively rating the combination of gin and Pacific Cooler as tasting like a large white gummy bear and negatively rating the combination of tequila and Tropical Cooler as &quot;we&#x27;ve made a huge mistake&quot;.

A 2017 review of &quot;your kids&#x27; lunch box favorites&quot; by Brooke Jackson-Glidden and Cooper Green in the &quot;Statesman Journal&quot; noted the Capri Sun Strawberry Kiwi&#x27;s 13 grams of sugar, praising its moderately sweet taste and small size. Green commented that it was &quot;definitely not the best flavor of Capri Sun.&quot; &quot;The Daily Meal&quot; in 2021 (before the monk fruit change) faulted the 13 grams in Fruit Punch and 20 grams of fruit sugar in 100% Juice Fruit Punch, calling it a &quot;red flag&quot; and ranking Fruit Punch among the unhealthiest juice boxes. The publication further criticized the lack of Vitamin C in either.

Roarin&#x27; Waters faced early criticism for its sugariness and lack of juice. Gannett News Service&#x27;s Kim Painter characterized it as &quot;a reduced-calorie fruit drink, apparently made for children who expect all drinks, even water, to be sweet&quot;, while James Lileks of the Minneapolis &quot;Star Tribune&quot; wrote that his daughter thought it tasted like Easy Mac. &quot;The Daily Meal&quot; also ranked Roarin&#x27; Waters (all flavors) on its list of unhealthiest juice boxes, citing its lack of juice and its 8 grams of sugar. They granted that it may be an option for children who do not drink enough water and concluded, &quot;It&#x27;s not bad for you &quot;per se&quot;, but you may be better off diluting real juice with water.&quot;

=== In popular culture ===
Capri-Sun in Europe has sponsored a number of athletic endeavors, including holding naming rights to the cycling team previously known as IJsboerke in 1981 and 1982.
A number of French rap artists, including Jul and Timal, have referenced Capri Sun in their songs. Rappers BoyBandit and Edinho have both written songs called &quot;CAPRI-SUN&quot;. Nicolas Santolaria of &quot;Le Monde&quot; described Capri-Sun as &quot;the new ostentatious elixir of French rappers and gangsters&quot;. Humorist Alexandre Majirus connected the trend to a broader phenomenon of 1990s nostalgia in rap. A Coca-Cola France representative told &quot;Slate.fr&quot; that they were not working with the rappers and neither supported nor opposed the trend. Naps&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (2017) originally depicted hiding drugs in a Capri-Sun pouch; the brand name was removed after Capri-Sun sought to have the video taken down.

, the Guinness World Record for the fastest time to drink a Capri-Sun is held by Fayis Nazer of India, at 8.02 seconds. When the record was created, Guinness established a benchmark time at 18 seconds, but no one officially attempted to take the title until 2021, when Declan Evans of England completed the task in 16.65 seconds. The record has changed hands multiple times; Guinness says it has received over 100 applications for the title since the video of a successful attempt by André Ortolf of Germany went viral.

<doc id="1018292" wikidata="Q938937" url="?curid=1018292" title="Hylozoism">
<text>Hylozoism is the philosophical doctrine according to which all matter is alive or animated, either in itself or as participating in the action of a superior principle, usually the world-soul (&quot;anima mundi&quot;). The theory holds that matter is unified with life or spiritual activity. The word is a 17th-century term formed from the Greek words ὕλη (&quot;hyle&quot;: &quot;wood, matter&quot;) and ζωή (&quot;zoē&quot;: &quot;life&quot;), which was coined by the English Platonist philosopher Ralph Cudworth in 1678.

== Hylozoism in Ancient Greek Philosophy ==
Hylozoism in Western philosophy can be traced back to ancient Greece. The Milesian philosophers Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes, can be described as hylozoists. Philosopher David Skrbina states that hylozoism was implicit in early Greek philosophy, and was not a doctrine that was typically challenged. &quot;For the Milesians, matter (&quot;hyle&quot;) possessed life (&quot;zoe&quot;) as an essential quality. Something like hylozoism was simply accepted as a brute condition of reality.&quot; Though hylozoism was implicit in early Greek thought, the philosopher Heraclitus specifically used the term &quot;zoe&quot;, making him explicitly hylozoist. The hylozoism of the pre-Socratic philosophers such as Thales and Heraclitus influenced later Greek philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics.

Though hylozoism was common in ancient Greek thought, the term had not been coined yet. In modern literature, hylozoism has tended to carry a negative connotation, and labeling a Greek philosopher as a hylozoist might be a vague disparagement of their thought.

== Renaissance period and early modernity ==
During the Renaissance period in Western Europe, humanist scholars and philosophers such as Bernardino Telesio, Paracelsus, Cardanus, and Giordano Bruno revived the doctrine of hylozoism. The latter, for example, held a form of Christian pantheism wherein God is conceived as the source, cause, medium, and end of all things, and therefore all things are participatory in the ongoing Godhead. Bruno&#x27;s ideas were so radical that he was excommunicated by the Catholic Church with the accusation of heresy, as well as from a few Protestant denominations, and he was eventually burned at the stake for various other beliefs that were regarded as heretical. Telesio, on the other hand, began from an Aristotelian basis and, through radical empiricism, came to believe that a living force was what informed all matter. Instead of the intellectual universals of Aristotle, he believed that life generated form.

In the Kingdom of England, some of the Cambridge Platonists approached hylozoism as well. Both Henry More and Ralph Cudworth (&quot;the Younger&quot;, 1617–1688), through their reconciliation of Platonic idealism with Christian doctrines of deific generation, came to see the divine lifeforce as the informing principle in the world. Thus, like Bruno, but not nearly to the extreme, they saw God&#x27;s generative impulse as giving life to all things that exist. Accordingly, Cudworth, the most systematic metaphysician of the Cambridge Platonist tradition, fought hylozoism. His work is primarily a critique of what he took to be the two principal forms of atheism—materialism and hylozoism.

Cudworth singled out Hobbes not only as a defender of the hylozoic atheism &quot;which attributes life to matter&quot;, but also as one going beyond it and defending &quot;hylopathian atheism, which attributes all to matter.&quot; Cudworth attempted to show that Hobbes had revived the doctrines of Protagoras and was therefore subject to the criticisms which Plato had deployed against Protagoras in the &quot;Theaetetus&quot;. On the side of hylozoism, Strato of Lampsacus was the official target. However, Cudworth&#x27;s Dutch friends had reported to him the views which Spinoza was circulating in manuscript. Cudworth remarks in his &quot;Preface&quot; that he would have ignored hylozoism had he not been aware that a new version of it would shortly be published.

Spinoza&#x27;s idealism also tends toward hylozoism. In order to hold a balance even between matter and mind, Spinoza combined materialistic with pantheistic hylozoism, by demoting both to mere attributes of the one infinite substance. Although specifically rejecting identity in inorganic matter, he, like the Cambridge Platonists, sees a life force within, as well as beyond, all matter.

== Contemporary hylozoism ==
Immanuel Kant presented arguments against hylozoism in the third chapter of his 1786 book &quot;Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Naturwissenschaften&quot; (&quot;First Metaphysical Principles of Natural Science&quot;) and also in his 1781 book &quot;Kritik der reinen Vernunft&quot; (&quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;). Yet, in our times, scientific hylozoism – whether modified, or keeping the trend to make all beings conform to some uniform pattern, to which the concept was adhered in modernity by Herbert Spencer, Hermann Lotze, and Ernst Haeckel – was often called upon as a protest against a mechanistic worldview.

In the 19th century, Haeckel developed a materialist form of hylozoism, specially against Rudolf Virchow&#x27;s and Hermann von Helmholtz&#x27;s mechanical views of humans and nature. In his &quot;Die Welträtsel&quot; of 1899 (&quot;The Riddle of the Universe&quot; 1901), Haeckel upheld a unity of organic and inorganic nature and derived all actions of both types of matter from natural causes and laws. Thus, his form of hylozoism reverses the usual course by maintaining that living and nonliving things are essentially the same, and by erasing the distinction between the two and stipulating that they behave by a single set of laws.

In contrast, the Argentine-German neurobiological tradition terms &quot;hylozoic hiatus&quot; all of the parts of nature which can only behave lawfully or nomically and, upon such a feature, are described as lying outside of minds and amid them – i.e. extramentally. Thereby the hylozoic hiatus becomes contraposed to minds deemed able of behaving semoviently, i.e. able of inaugurating new causal series (semovience). Hylozoism in this contemporary neurobiological tradition is thus restricted to the portions of nature behaving nomically inside the minds, namely the minds&#x27; sensory reactions (Christfried Jakob&#x27;s &quot;sensory intonations&quot;) whereby minds react to the stimuli coming from the hylozoic hiatus or extramental realm.

Martin Buber too takes an approach that is quasi-hylozoic. By maintaining that the essence of things is identifiable and separate, although not pre-existing, he can see a soul within each thing.

The French Pythagorean and Rosicrucian alchemist, Francois Jollivet-Castelot (1874–1937), established a hylozoic esoteric school which combined the insight of spagyrics, chemistry, physics, transmutations and metaphysics. He published many books, including the 1896 publication &quot;L’Hylozoïsme, l’alchimie, les chimistes unitaires&quot;. In his view there was no difference between spirit and matter except for the degree of frequency and other vibrational conditions.

The Mormon theologian Orson Pratt taught a form of hylozoism.

Alice A. Bailey wrote a book called &quot;The Consciousness of the Atom&quot;.

Influenced by Alice A. Bailey, Charles Webster Leadbeater, and their predecessor Madame Blavatsky, Henry T. Laurency produced voluminous writings describing a hylozoic philosophy.

Influenced by George Ivanovich Gurdjieff, the English philosopher and mathematician John Godolphin Bennett, in his four-volume work &quot;The Dramatic Universe&quot; and his book &quot;Energies&quot;, developed a six-dimensional framework in which matter-energy takes on 12 levels of hylozoic quality.

The English cybernetician Stafford Beer adopted a hylozoism position, arguing that it could be defended scientifically and expending much effort on Biological computing in consequence. This is described as Beer&#x27;s &quot;spiritually-charged awe at the activity and powers of nature in relation to our inability to grasp them representationally&quot;. Beer claimed that &quot;Nature does not need to make any detours; it does not just exceed our computational abilities, in effect it surpasses them in unimaginable ways. In a poem on the Irish Sea, Beer talks about nature as exceeding our capacities in way that we can only wonder at, ‘shocked’ and ‘dumbfounded.’&quot; In partnership with his friend Gordon Pask, who was experimenting with various chemical and bio-chemical devices, he explored the possibility for intelligence to be developed in very simple network-complex systems. In one possibly unique experiment led by Pask, they found that such a structure would &#x27;grow&#x27; a sensing organization in response to the stimuli of different audio inputs in about half a day.

Ken Wilber embraces hylozoism to explain subjective experience and provides terms describing the ladder of subjective experience experienced by entities from atoms up to Human beings in the &quot;upper left quadrant&quot; of his Integral philosophy chart.

Physicist Thomas Brophy, in The Mechanism Demands a Mysticism, embraces hylozoism as the basis of a framework for re-integrating modern physical science with perennial spiritual philosophy. Brophy coins two additional words to stand with hylozoism as the three possible ontological stances consistent with modern physics. Thus: hylostatism (universe is deterministic, thus &quot;static&quot; in a four-dimensional sense); hylostochastism (universe contains a fundamentally random or stochastic component); hylozoism (universe contains a fundamentally alive aspect).

Architect Christopher Alexander has put forth a theory of the living universe, where life is viewed as a pervasive patterning that extends to what is normally considered non-living things, notably buildings. He wrote a four-volume work called &quot;The Nature of Order&quot; which explicates this theory in detail.

Philosopher and ecologist David Abram articulates and elaborates a form of hylozoism grounded in the phenomenology of sensory experience. In his books &quot;Becoming Animal&quot; and &quot;The Spell of the Sensuous,&quot; Abram suggests that matter is never entirely passive in our direct experience, holding rather that material things actively &quot;solicit our attention&quot; or &quot;call our focus,&quot; coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things. In the absence of intervening technologies, sensory experience is inherently animistic, disclosing a material field that is animate and self-organizing from the get-go. Drawing upon contemporary cognitive and natural science as well as the perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous, oral cultures, Abram proposes a richly pluralist and story-based cosmology, in which matter is alive through and through. Such an ontology is in close accord, he suggests, with our spontaneous perceptual experience; it calls us back to our senses and to the primacy of the sensuous terrain, enjoining a more respectful and ethical relation to the more-than-human community of animals, plants, soils, mountains, waters and weather-patterns that materially sustains us.

Bruno Latour&#x27;s actor-network theory, in the sociology of science, treats non-living things as active agents and thus bears some metaphorical resemblance to hylozoism.

The metaphysics of Gilles Deleuze has been described as a form of hylozoism.

==In popular culture==
===Art===
*&quot;Hylozoic Series: Sibyl&quot;, an interactive installation of Canadian artist and architect Philip Beesley, was presented in the 18th Biennale of Sydney and was on display until September, 2012. Using sensors, LEDs, and shape memory alloy, Beesley constructed an interactive environment that responded to the actions of the audience, offering a vision of how buildings in the future might move, think and feel.

===Literature===
*In mathematician and writer Rudy Rucker&#x27;s novels &quot;Postsingular&quot; and &quot;Hylozoic&quot;, the emergent sentience of all material things is described as a property of the technological singularity.
*The &quot;Hylozoist&quot; is one of the Culture ships mentioned in Iain M. Banks&#x27;s novel &quot;Surface Detail&quot; – appropriately, this ship is a member of the branch of Contact dealing with smart matter outbreaks.

===MMORPGs===
*The monster &quot;Hylozoist&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;Heirozoist&quot;) in the MMORPG &quot;Ragnarok Online&quot; is a plush rabbit doll with its mouth sewn shut, possessed by the spirit of a child. Although hylozoism has nothing to do with possession, it is clear that the name was derived from this ancient philosophy.

===Music===
*The Hylozoists are a Canadian band.
*Sonic Youth references hylozoism in the second verse of the fourth track on the Sister LP

<text>A barrel organ (also called roller organ or crank organ) is a French mechanical musical instrument consisting of bellows and one or more ranks of pipes housed in a case, usually of wood, and often highly decorated. The basic principle is the same as a traditional pipe organ, but rather than being played by an organist, the barrel organ is activated either by a person turning a crank, or by clockwork driven by weights or springs. The pieces of music are encoded onto wooden barrels (or cylinders), which are analogous to the keyboard of the traditional pipe organ. A person (or in some cases, a trained animal) who plays a barrel organ is known as an [[Street organ|organ grinder]].

==Terminology==
There are many names for the barrel organ, such as hand organ, cylinder organ, box organ (though that can also mean a positive organ), street organ, grinder organ, and Low Countries organ. 

In French names include &quot;orgue à manivelle&quot; (&quot;crank organ&quot;) and &quot;orgue de Barbarie&quot; (&quot;Barbary organ&quot;); German names include &quot;Drehorgel&quot; (&quot;crank organ&quot;), &quot;Leierkasten&quot; (&quot;brace box&quot;), and &quot;Walzenorgel&quot; (&quot;cylinder organ&quot;); Hungarian names include &quot;verkli&quot; (from Austrian-German &quot;Werkl&quot;), &quot;sípláda&quot; (&quot;whistle chest&quot;) and &quot;kintorna&quot; (from Bayern-Austrian &quot;Kinterne&quot;); Italian names include &quot;organetto a manovella&quot; (&quot;crank organ&quot;) and &quot;organo tedesco&quot; (&quot;German organ&quot;); the Polish name is &quot;katarynka&quot;. 

However, several of these names include types of mechanical organs for which the music is encoded as book music or by holes on a punched paper tape instead of by pins on a barrel. While many of these terms refer to the physical operation of the crank, some refer to an exotic origin. The French name &quot;orgue de Barbarie&quot;, suggesting barbarians, has been explained as a corruption of, variously, the terms &quot;bara&quot; (&quot;bread&quot;) and &quot;gwen&quot; (&quot;wine&quot;) in the Breton language, the surname of an early barrel-organ manufacturer from Modena, Giovanni Barberi, or that of the English inventor John Burberry.

The term hurdy-gurdy is sometimes mistakenly applied to a small, portable barrel organ that was frequently played by organ grinders and buskers (street musicians), but the two terms should not be confused. Although the hurdy-gurdy is also powered by a crank and often used by street performers, it produces sound with a rosin-covered wheel rotated against tuned strings. Another key difference is that the hurdy-gurdy player is free to play any tune he or she desires, while the barrel organist is generally confined to pre-programmed tunes.

Some also confuse the barrel organ with the steam organ or calliope. In the United Kingdom barrel pianos, particularly those played in the streets, are frequently called barrel organs.

==Barrel==

The pieces of music (or tunes) are encoded onto the barrel using metal pins and staples. Pins are used for short notes, and staples of varying lengths for longer notes. Each barrel usually carried several different tunes. Pinning such barrels was something of an art form, and the quality of the music produced by a barrel organ is largely a function of the quality of its pinning.

The organ barrels must be sturdy to maintain precise alignment over time, since they play the same programming role as music rolls and have to endure significant mechanical strain. Damage to the barrel, such as warpage, would have a direct (and usually detrimental) effect on the music produced.

The size of the barrel will depend on the number of notes in the organ and the length of the tune to be played. The more notes, the longer the barrel. The longer the tune, the greater the diameter.

Since the music is hard-coded onto the barrel, the only way for a barrel organ to play a different set of tunes is to replace the barrel with another one. While not a difficult operation, barrels are unwieldy and expensive, so many organ grinders have only one barrel for their instrument.

==Operation==

A set of levers called keys is positioned just above the surface of the barrel. Each key corresponds to one pitch. A rod is connected to the rear of each key. The other end of the rod is a metal pin which operates a valve within the wind chest. When the instrument is played (by turning the crank), offsets on the crank shaft cause bellows to open and close to produce pressurized air. A reservoir/regulator maintains a constant pressure. A worm gear on the crank shaft causes the barrel to rotate slowly and its pins and staples lift the fronts of the keys. This causes the other end of the key to press down on the end of the rod which, in turn, activates the valve and allows air from the bellows to pass into the corresponding pipe. 
To allow different tunes to be played from one barrel, the barrel can be moved laterally to bring a different set of pins and staples under the keys. Street barrel organs usually play 7 to 9 tunes, although small organs (usually the older ones) can play up to 15 tunes. Less commonly (and usually for large orchestrions) the pinning will form one continuous spiral and the barrel will be gradually moved as it rotates so that the pins remain lined up with the keys. In this case, each barrel plays only one long tune.

==Usage==

The barrel organ was the traditional instrument of organ grinders. With a few exceptions, organ grinders used one of the smaller, more portable versions of the barrel organ, containing perhaps one (or just a few) rank(s) of pipes and only 7 to 9 tunes. Use of these organs was limited by their weight. Most weighed 25 to 50 pounds but some were as heavy as 100 pounds.
There were many larger versions located in churches, fairgrounds, music halls, and other large establishments such as sports arenas and theaters. The large barrel organs were often powered by very heavy weights and springs, like a more powerful version of a longcase clock. They could also be hydraulically powered, with a turbine or waterwheel arrangement giving the mechanical force to turn the barrel and pump the bellows. The last barrel organs were electrically powered, or converted to electrical power. Eventually, many large barrel organs had their barrel actions removed and were converted to play a different format of music, such as cardboard books or paper rolls.

==Combined barrel and manually played instruments==

Especially in churches, some large barrel organs were built as &quot;barrel and finger&quot; organs. Such instruments are furnished with a normal organ keyboard, in addition to the automatic mechanism, making it possible to play them by hand when a human organist is available. The barrels were often out of sight.

At the beginning of the 20th century, large barrel organs intended for use as fairground organs or street organs were often converted, or newly built, to play music rolls or book music rather than barrels. This allows a much greater variety of melodies to be played.

<text>Darik&#x27;s Boot and Nuke, also known as DBAN , is a free and open-source project hosted on SourceForge. The program is designed to securely erase a hard disk until its data is permanently removed and no longer recoverable, which is achieved by overwriting the data with pseudorandom numbers generated by Mersenne Twister or ISAAC. The Gutmann method, Quick Erase, DoD Short (3 passes), and DOD 5220.22-M (7 passes) are also included as options to handle data remanence.
DBAN can be booted from a CD, DVD, USB flash drive or diskless using a Preboot Execution Environment. It is based on Linux and supports PATA (IDE), SCSI and SATA hard drives. DBAN can be configured to automatically wipe every hard disk that it sees on a system or entire network of systems, making it very useful for unattended data destruction scenarios. DBAN exists for x86 systems.

DBAN, like other methods of data erasure, is suitable for use prior to computer recycling for personal or commercial situations, such as donating or selling a computer, as well as disposing of hard drives.

==Current status==
In September 2012, Blancco of Finland announced its acquisition of DBAN.

The most recent version of DBAN, 2.3.0, was released on 4 June 2015. Since that time, DBAN development has ended and the DBAN official website is now used by Blancco to market their Blancco Drive Eraser instead.

==nwipe==

The dwipe program that DBAN uses has been forked and is available as a standalone command line program called &quot;nwipe&quot;, which is maintained by Martijn van Brummelen and released under the GNU General Public License 2.0 license.

<text>Wecta (Old English: &quot;Wægdæg&quot;, Old Norse: &quot;Vegdagr&quot;) is a figure mentioned in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;.

Wecta is considered mythological, though he shows up in the genealogies as a Saxon ancestor of Hengest and Horsa and the kings of Kent, as well as of Aella of Deira and his son Edwin of Northumbria.

Wecta appears in the &quot;Prologue to the Prose Edda&quot; as Vegdeg, one of Woden&#x27;s sons, a mighty king who ruled East Saxony. Although Wecta is mentioned as the father of Witta and the grandfather of Wihtgils in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and the Anglian collection of Anglo-Saxon genealogies reverses the order of Witta and Wihtgils in the genealogy.

<text>The Anglo-Australian Near-Earth Asteroid Survey (AANEAS) operated from 1990 to 1996, becoming one of the most prolific programs of its type in the world. Apart from leading to the discovery of 38 near-Earth asteroids, 9 comets, 63 supernovae, several other astronomical phenomena and the delivery of a substantial proportion of all NEA astrometry obtained worldwide (e.g., 30% in 1994–95), AANEAS also led to many other scientific advances which were reported in the refereed literature.

<doc id="1018303" wikidata="Q6902050" url="?curid=1018303" title="Monotropism">
<text>Monotropism is an individual&#x27;s tendency to focus their attention on a small or singular number of interests at any time, with them neglecting or not perceiving lesser interests. This cognitive strategy has been posited as the central underlying feature of autism.

The theory of monotropism was developed by Dinah Murray, Wenn Lawson and Mike Lesser starting in the 1990s, and first published in 2005. Lawson&#x27;s further work on the theory formed the basis of his PhD, &quot;Single Attention and Associated Cognition in Autism&quot;, and book &quot;The Passionate Mind&quot; published in 2011.

A tendency to focus attention tightly has a number of psychological implications, with it being seen as a state of &quot;tunnel vision&quot;. While monotropism tends to cause people to miss things outside their attention tunnel, within it, their focused attention can lend itself to intense experiences, deep thinking, and more specifically, flow states. However, this form of hyperfocus makes it harder to redirect attention, including starting and stopping tasks, leading to what is often described as executive dysfunction in autism, and stereotypies or perseveration, where a person&#x27;s attention is repeatedly drawn back to the same subject or activity.

== Characteristics ==


Since the amount of attention available to a person is limited, cognitive processes are forced to compete. In the monotropic mind, interests that are active at any given time tend to consume most of the available attention, causing difficulty with other tasks such as conventional social interaction. Language development can be affected, both through the broad attention required and the psychological impact of language, which provides a tool for others to manipulate a child&#x27;s interest system.

Monotropic individuals have trouble processing multiple things at once, particularly when it comes to multitasking while listening. For example, some students have trouble taking notes in class while listening to a teacher and may find it difficult to read a person&#x27;s face and comprehend what they are saying simultaneously. A common tendency is for individuals to avoid complex sensory environments because of this hypersensitivity. Monotropic individuals may suppress attention and focus on something else, or develop great depth in a given interest or skill.

== Implications for practice ==
Murray et al. (2005) proposed certain steps to help autistic individuals, such as increasing &quot;connections&quot;, building understanding through the child&#x27;s interests, and making connections between people and concepts more &quot;meaningful and less complex.&quot;

<doc id="1018316" wikidata="Q159202" url="?curid=1018316" title="Lucius Fox">
<text>Lucius Fox is a character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the superhero Bruce Wayne / Batman. He is Wayne&#x27;s business manager at Wayne Enterprises who runs the business interests that supply his equipment needs as well as financing his operations, and is the father of Luke Fox / Batwing, Tiffany Fox / Batgirl, and Jace Fox / Batman.

Lucius Fox has been featured in various media adaptations. The character was voiced by Brock Peters in &quot;&quot;, Mel Winkler in &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;, Louis Gossett Jr. in &quot;The Batman&quot;, Phil LaMarr in &quot;DC Super Hero Girls&quot;, and Dave Fennoy in the video game &quot;&quot;. Lucius Fox made his live-action debut in &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; Trilogy, portrayed by Morgan Freeman, with Chris Chalk portraying him in the television series &quot;Gotham&quot;, and Simon Manyonda portraying a young version of Chalk&#x27;s Lucius Fox in the second and third seasons of the television series &quot;Pennyworth&quot;. Hugh Maguire portrays an Irish Catholic substitute of the character named Jack Fox O&#x27;Dwyer in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) film &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;.

==Publication history==
Lucius Fox was created by writer Len Wein and penciller John Calnan and first appeared in &quot;Batman&quot; #307 (January 1979).

==Fictional character biography==
As CEO and President of Wayne Enterprises, Lucius Fox is one of Bruce Wayne&#x27;s closest allies. He is an experienced businessman, entrepreneur, and inventor who runs the business interests that supply weapons, gadgets, vehicles, and armor for Bruce Wayne to use when he fights crime as the vigilante Batman. The character is depicted as being aware that Bruce Wayne is Batman, having replaced Alfred Pennyworth in cave operations, after Alfred&#x27;s untimely death at the hands of Bane.

===Business career===
Lucius Fox is regarded as having the &quot;Midas Touch&quot;, an ability to turn failing businesses into successful conglomerates, and is consequently a highly sought-after businessman throughout the corporate world. Fox is called in to the failing Wayne Enterprises and brings balance to both Bruce Wayne&#x27;s private and business finances. In &quot;Batman Confidential&quot;, he is shown heading the project that produced the prototype that would become the Batwing. He also manages the particulars of the Wayne Foundation while Bruce dictates the organization&#x27;s general policies. Since then, Fox has been approached repeatedly by other companies seeking his expertise. After overcoming the original challenge of returning Wayne Enterprises to its former glory, Fox has elected to stay, having been given an unparalleled freedom in the company.

In &quot;&quot;, it is explained that a young Bruce Wayne rescued Lucius Fox from muggers in Paris. Later, Fox asked him if he wants to start a foundation for charity, to which Bruce agrees many years later, deciding that not all of his money has to go to crime fighting.

Bruce Wayne, as Batman, originally forms the Outsiders to rescue Fox from Baron Bedlam. When Fox later suffers a stroke, Bruce makes sure that Fox gets the best care possible and supports him and his family.

===Family life===
With his wife Tanya, Lucius has several children, all introduced in the comics at different stages over the years. Fox&#x27;s daughter Tam is introduced in &quot;Red Robin&quot;. Her father sends her to personally locate Tim Drake, only to discover his secret identity as Red Robin and become involved in his conflicts with the League of Assassins. For a time it was believed Fox was dead, but this was a ruse to help combat his enemies. It is believed that learning Drake&#x27;s secrets has led Tam Fox to realize that Bruce Wayne is Batman. However, she apparently did not report her findings to her father.

Fox&#x27;s youngest daughter, Tiffany, was first shown in &quot;Batman&quot; #308 (1979), but was not substantially explored until 2011&#x27;s The New 52 reboot of DC&#x27;s continuity, which reintroduced her along with her siblings in &quot;Batwing&quot; #22. The alternative future story shown in &quot;Batgirl: Futures End&quot; (2014) shows Tiffany grows up to be a gifted protege of Barbara Gordon, becoming one of several women to use the Batgirl moniker, with a pink-accented Batsuit.

Prior to The New 52, Lucius had a son named Timothy whose occasional delinquency embarrassed his father. Tim, now calling himself &#x27;Jace&#x27; returns in the &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot; miniseries &quot;The Next Batman: Second Son&quot;. Lucius also has a son named Lucas &quot;Luke&quot; Fox, introduced in the New 52 continuity, who is an intellectual prodigy and mixed martial artist and who, unbeknownst to his father, was selected and trained by Bruce Wayne to become the vigilante known as Batwing using a high-tech Batsuit designed by his father. Both Luke and his predecessor as Batwing, David Zavimbe, are agents of the international crime-fighting organization Batman Incorporated.

After Bruce Wayne announces his public support for Batman Inc., Fox becomes active supplying him with the company&#x27;s resources and research prototypes.

====Live-action====
* A younger Lucius Fox appears in &quot;Gotham&quot;, portrayed by Chris Chalk. He first appears in &quot;The Anvil or the Hammer&quot; where he is introduced to a young Bruce Wayne by corrupt Wayne Enterprises executive Sid Bunderslaw. He tells Bruce about his father being &quot;a very guarded man&quot; and &quot;a true Stoic&quot; before sending him on his way. This clue helps Bruce discover his father&#x27;s secret life. Fox later reappeared in the show&#x27;s second season and is asked by Bruce to fix the computer Alfred destroyed with Wayne Enterprises&#x27; secrets and research. Fox confirmed that the computer can be fixed but it will take a while. In &quot;Rise of the Villains: Worse Than a Crime,&quot; Lucius Fox emerges from the secret room to tell Bruce and Alfred that he fixed the computer only to find them not there and that there were signs of a struggle. Lucius reports them missing to Captain Nathaniel Barnes who makes an exception to the &quot;file a missing persons report in 24 hours&quot; part. When it was revealed that Alfred had been brought in by the police, Lucius was present when Alfred mentioned that he was attacked by Tabitha Galavan while voicing his suspicion that Theo Galavan is responsible. Edward Nygma later tipped off Lucius Fox, Alfred Pennyworth, and Harvey Bullock on where James Gordon is recuperating. While Gordon, Bullock, Pennyworth, Oswald Cobblepot&#x27;s gang, and Selina Kyle went to rescue Bruce Wayne from Theo Galavan and the Order of St. Dumas, Lucius tipped off Nathaniel Barnes on where Bruce Wayne can be found. In &quot;Wrath of the Villains: Mr. Freeze,&quot; James Gordon and Harvey Bullock meet with Lucius Fox at a diner and ask him about any cryogenic research done by Wayne Enterprises. He tells them that Wayne Enterprises did cryogenic research until Thomas Wayne shut it down for reasons Lucius was unaware of. In &quot;Mad City: Better to Reign in Hell...,&quot; Lucius Fox has left Wayne Enterprises and has become a science expert at the Gotham City Police Department. During season 5, Lucius continues to help with the GCPD after it becomes a following Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s attack. In &quot;A Dark Knight: A Beautiful Darkness&quot;, Lucius reveals that he is a black belt in Jiu-jitsu, having taken night classes. Before Bruce confronts Bane and saves Gotham City, he meets with Lucius Fox who has plenty of new gadgets to give the budding vigilante. One of them is next-generation stealth-tech which Lucius dubs the &quot;Nightwing Project.&quot; In the series finale, Bruce returns after 10 years of training abroad and recruits Fox to help build his suit.

=====&quot;The Dark Knight Trilogy&quot;=====

Lucius Fox appears in the Dark Knight trilogy, portrayed by Morgan Freeman.
* Introduced in &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, this version is a research head and friend of Thomas Wayne who is demoted to the Applied Sciences division, which involves overseeing the supplies of aborted research projects and prototypes. Upon returning to the business, Bruce Wayne strikes up a fast friendship which allows him to all but recruit Fox as his armorer for his Batman activities. Fox proves valuable in this role, even when he is fired by Earle. Regarding Bruce&#x27;s identity as Batman, he tells Bruce, &quot;[If] you don&#x27;t want to tell me exactly what you&#x27;re doing— when I&#x27;m asked, I don&#x27;t have to lie. But don&#x27;t think of me as an idiot.&quot; Fox later discovers Bruce&#x27;s real identity through Alfred Pennyworth, who calls upon Fox to Bruce&#x27;s rescue after he is assaulted by Scarecrow&#x27;s fear toxin. At the end of the film, Bruce, having gained majority control of Wayne Enterprises&#x27; shares, fires Earle and makes Fox the company&#x27;s CEO.
* In &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, Fox actively participates in a support capacity as Bruce&#x27;s armorer, designing a new Batsuit designed for more efficient mobility and which can withstand against dogs, though also makes Bruce vulnerable to knives and gunfire. When Wayne Enterprises negotiates a deal with Lau, an investment holdings owner who also is an accountant for the Gotham mafia, both Bruce and Fox look at the books and decide that Lau&#x27;s business is illegal based on their profits. With Harvey Dent and Lt. James Gordon needing Lau alive to find where he has hidden the mob&#x27;s money, Bruce makes a trip to Hong Kong and Fox accompanies him to make it look like they&#x27;ve only gone there to cancel the negotiations with Lau&#x27;s investment company. When Batman uses Fox&#x27;s cell phone sonar technology to create a computer system that can spy on the whole city to find Joker, Fox says that he will help just this once, but will resign immediately afterward. After the police arrest the Joker, Fox types his name into the system as instructed by Batman and the computer self-destructs. Fox walks away smiling, evidently having withdrawn his threat to resign.
* In &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, Fox has become the president of a nearly bankrupt Wayne Enterprises, with Wayne Enterprises board member Miranda Tate taking over the role of chairman and CEO. He brings the reclusive Bruce up to speed on the poor state of the company&#x27;s finances, which have all but evaporated after heavy investment in an aborted fusion reactor project failed to pay off thanks to John Daggett. Fox shows Bruce around the Applied Sciences division once again, &quot;for old time&#x27;s sake,&quot; introducing him to the new airborne vehicle he has nicknamed &quot;The Bat&quot;, in addition to other new gadgets he has developed. After Bane takes over Gotham City, Fox spends much of the intervening three-month period hiding in Wayne Enterprises property with fellow employees. Bane and his men raid Wayne Enterprises and kill the special forces soldiers that infiltrated Gotham City while rounding up the Wayne Enterprises employees to await judgement at Scarecrow&#x27;s show trial. When Batman returns, he lets himself get captured as Bruce Wayne so that Selina Kyle can sneak in, knock out the guards and break Fox out. Fox attempts to help him disarm the newly weaponized fusion core, waiting in the reactor chamber for it to be returned by Batman. Miranda Tate, who was responsible for the project in the first place, reveals herself to be Talia al Ghul as she floods the chamber to make re-installment of the core impossible. Fox manages to escape. After Batman tows the core away from Gotham and it detonates at sea, Bruce Wayne is thought by Fox to be dead and his estate is divided to cover his debts, with the remainder being given to Alfred Pennyworth, except for Wayne Manor. While researching ways he could have fixed &quot;The Bat&quot;&#x27;s autopilot, Fox learns that Bruce fixed it himself six months earlier and realizes that he is still alive.

<text>The Lawson criterion is a figure of merit used in nuclear fusion research. It compares the rate of energy being generated by fusion reactions within the fusion fuel to the rate of energy losses to the environment. When the rate of production is higher than the rate of loss, the system will produce net energy. If enough of that energy is captured by the fuel, the system will become self-sustaining and is said to be ignited.

The concept was first developed by John D. Lawson in a classified 1955 paper that was declassified and published in 1957. As originally formulated, the Lawson criterion gives a minimum required value for the product of the plasma (electron) density &quot;n&quot;e and the &quot;energy confinement time&quot; formula_1 that leads to net energy output.

Later analysis suggested that a more useful figure of merit is the triple product of density, confinement time, and plasma temperature &quot;T&quot;. The triple product also has a minimum required value, and the name &quot;Lawson criterion&quot; may refer to this value.

On August 8, 2021, researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory&#x27;s National Ignition Facility in California confirmed to have produced the first-ever successful ignition of a nuclear fusion reaction surpassing the Lawson&#x27;s criteria in the experiment.

==Energy balance==

The central concept of the Lawson criterion is an examination of the energy balance for any fusion power plant using a hot plasma. This is shown below:

Net power = Efficiency × (Fusion − Radiation loss − Conduction loss)

#Net power is the excess power beyond that needed internally for the process to proceed in any fusion power plant.
#Efficiency is how much energy is needed to drive the device and how well it collects energy from the reactions.
#Fusion is rate of energy generated by the fusion reactions.
#Radiation loss is the energy lost as light (including X-rays) leaving the plasma.
#Conduction loss is the energy lost as particles leave the plasma, carrying away energy.

Lawson calculated the fusion rate by assuming that the fusion reactor contains a hot plasma cloud which has a Gaussian curve of individual particle energies, a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution characterized by the plasma&#x27;s temperature. Based on that assumption, he estimated the first term, the fusion energy being produced, using the volumetric fusion equation.

Fusion = Number density of fuel A × Number density of fuel B × Cross section(Temperature) × Energy per reaction

#Fusion is the rate of fusion energy produced by the plasma
#Number density is the density in particles per unit volume of the respective fuels (or just one fuel, in some cases)
#Cross section is a measure of the probability of a fusion event, which is based on the plasma temperature 
#Energy per reaction is the energy released in each fusion reaction

This equation is typically averaged over a population of ions which has a normal distribution. The result is the amount of energy being created by the plasma at any instant in time.

Lawson then estimated the radiation losses using the following equation:

formula_2

where &quot;N&quot; is the number density of the cloud and &quot;T&quot; is the temperature. For his analysis, Lawson ignores conduction losses. In reality this is nearly impossible; practically all systems lose energy through mass leaving the plasma and carrying away its energy.

By equating radiation losses and the volumetric fusion rates, Lawson estimated the minimum temperature for the fusion for the deuterium–tritium (D-T) reaction 
:formula_3
to be 30 million degrees (2.6 keV), and for the deuterium–deuterium (D-D) reaction 
:formula_4
to be 150 million degrees (12.9 keV).

==Extensions into &quot;nτ&quot;&quot;E&quot;==

The confinement time formula_1 measures the rate at which a system loses energy to its environment. The faster the rate of loss of energy, formula_6, the shorter the energy confinement time. It is the energy density formula_7 (energy content per unit volume) divided by the power loss density formula_6 (rate of energy loss per unit volume):

:formula_9

For a fusion reactor to operate in steady state, the fusion plasma must be maintained at a constant temperature. Thermal energy must therefore be added at the same rate the plasma loses energy in order to maintain the fusion conditions. This energy can be supplied by the fusion reactions themselves, depending on the reaction type, or by supplying additional heating through a variety of methods.

For illustration, the Lawson criterion for the D-T reaction will be derived here, but the same principle can be applied to other fusion fuels. It will also be assumed that all species have the same temperature, that there are no ions present other than fuel ions (no impurities and no helium ash), and that D and T are present in the optimal 50-50 mixture. Ion density then equals electron density and the energy density of both electrons and ions together is given, according to the ideal gas law, by

:formula_10

where formula_11 is the temperature in electronvolt (eV) and formula_12 is the particle density.

The volume rate formula_13 (reactions per volume per time) of fusion reactions is

:formula_14

where formula_15 is the fusion cross section, formula_16 is the relative velocity, and formula_17 denotes an average over the Maxwellian velocity distribution at the temperature formula_11.

The volume rate of heating by fusion is formula_13 times formula_20, the energy of the charged fusion products (the neutrons cannot help to heat the plasma). In the case of the D-T reaction, formula_21.

The Lawson criterion requires that fusion heating exceeds the losses:

:formula_22

Substituting in known quantities yields:

:formula_23

Rearranging the equation produces:
The quantity formula_24 is a function of temperature with an absolute minimum. Replacing the function with its minimum value provides an absolute lower limit for the product formula_25. This is the Lawson criterion.

For the deuterium–tritium reaction, the physical value is at least

:formula_26

The minimum of the product occurs near formula_27.

==Extension into the &quot;triple product&quot; ==

A still more useful figure of merit is the &quot;triple product&quot; of density, temperature, and confinement time, &quot;nTτ&quot;&quot;E&quot;. For most confinement concepts, whether inertial, mirror, or toroidal confinement, the density and temperature can be varied over a fairly wide range, but the maximum attainable pressure &quot;p&quot; is a constant. When such is the case, the fusion power density is proportional to &quot;p&quot;2&lt;σ&quot;v&quot;&gt;/&quot;T&quot; 2. The maximum fusion power available from a given machine is therefore reached at the temperature &quot;T&quot; where &lt;σ&quot;v&quot;&gt;/&quot;T&quot; 2 is a maximum. By continuation of the above derivation, the following inequality is readily obtained:

:formula_28

The quantity formula_29 is also a function of temperature with an absolute minimum at a slightly lower temperature than formula_30.

For the D-T reaction, the minimum occurs at &quot;T&quot; = 14 keV. The average &lt;σ&quot;v&quot;&gt; in this temperature region can be approximated as

:formula_31
where &quot;m&quot;&quot;i&quot; denotes mean ionic mass. The inertial confinement time formula_1 can thus be approximated as
:formula_33

By substitution of the above expression into relationship (), we obtain
:formula_34
This product must be greater than a value related to the minimum of &quot;T&quot; 3/2/&lt;σv&gt;. The same requirement is traditionally expressed in terms of mass density &quot;ρ&quot; = &lt;&quot;nm&quot;i&gt;:

:formula_35

Satisfaction of this criterion at the density of solid D-T (0.2 g/cm3) would require a laser pulse of implausibly large energy. Assuming the energy required scales with the mass of the fusion plasma (&quot;E&quot;laser ~ &quot;ρR&quot;3 ~ &quot;ρ&quot;−2), compressing the fuel to 103 or 104 times solid density would reduce the energy required by a factor of 106 or 108, bringing it into a realistic range. With a compression by 103, the compressed density will be 200 g/cm3, and the compressed radius can be as small as 0.05 mm. The radius of the fuel before compression would be 0.5 mm. The initial pellet will be perhaps twice as large since most of the mass will be ablated during the compression.

The fusion power times density is a good figure of merit to determine the optimum temperature for magnetic confinement, but for inertial confinement the fractional burn-up of the fuel is probably more useful. The burn-up should be proportional to the specific reaction rate (&quot;n&quot;2&lt;&quot;σv&quot;&gt;) times the confinement time (which scales as &quot;T&quot; -1/2) divided by the particle density &quot;n&quot;:

:formula_36

Thus the optimum temperature for inertial confinement fusion maximises &lt;σv&gt;/&quot;T&quot;3/2, which is slightly higher than the optimum temperature for magnetic confinement.

==Non-thermal systems==
Lawson&#x27;s analysis is based on the rate of fusion and loss of energy in a thermalized plasma. There is a class of fusion machines that do not use thermalized plasmas but instead directly accelerate individual ions to the required energies. The best-known examples are the migma, fusor and polywell.

When applied to the fusor, Lawson&#x27;s analysis is used as an argument that conduction and radiation losses are the key impediments to reaching net power. Fusors use a voltage drop to accelerate and collide ions, resulting in fusion. The voltage drop is generated by wire cages, and these cages conduct away particles.

Polywells are improvements on this design, designed to reduce conduction losses by removing the wire cages which cause them. Regardless, it is argued that radiation is still a major impediment.

== Notes ==
 It is straightforward to relax these assumptions. The most difficult question is how to define formula_12 when the ion and electrons differ in density and temperature. Considering that this is a calculation of energy production and loss by ions, and that any plasma confinement concept must contain the pressure forces of the plasma, it seems appropriate to define the effective (electron) density formula_12 through the (total) pressure formula_39 as formula_40. The factor of formula_41 is included because formula_12 usually refers to the density of the electrons alone, but formula_39 here refers to the total pressure. Given two species with ion densities formula_44, atomic numbers formula_45, ion temperature formula_46, and electron temperature formula_47, it is easy to show that the fusion power is maximized by a fuel mix given by formula_48. The values for formula_49, formula_50, and the power density must be multiplied by the factor formula_51. For example, with protons and boron (formula_52) as fuel, another factor of formula_53 must be included in the formulas. On the other hand, for cold electrons, the formulas must all be divided by formula_54 (with no additional factor for formula_55).

<text>The providence petrel (Pterodroma solandri) is a large and heavy build gadfly petrel that nests in two locations in the Tasman Sea: Lord Howe Island (some 800 km from the Australian mainland) and Philip Island.

The scientific name of this species was given in honour of the Swedish botanist Daniel Solander, with Solander&#x27;s petrel being an alternative common name.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
This bird was once numerous on Norfolk Island, however an estimated 1 million birds were harvested for food, and was completely exterminated on this island by 1800. It was also threatened by the introduction of mammalian predators in the late 18th century.

This species is classified as least concern. However, the providence petrel is deemed to be in a precarious position because its breeding is confined to two mountain tops and one tiny islet, and is therefore at great risk from a catastrophe.

Graceful and supple in flight, the providence petrel has a cumbersome propensity on the ground, making it vulnerable to attack by predators. Main in causes of death are predation by the endangered Lord Howe rail and flooding of burrows. Other dangers include rat predation and drowning in longline fishing gear. The current population is estimated at only 64,000.

More than 99% of the global population now breeds on Lord Howe Island, where approximately 32,000 pairs nest on Mt Gower and Mt Lidgbird with some additional birds nesting on the lower slopes and Northern Hills.

&quot;Diet and foraging behaviour of the Providence Petrel Pterodroma solandri on Lord Howe Island, Australia, were investigated during three consecutive breeding seasons. Diet consisted largely of squid (predominantly Cranchiidae, Onychoteuthidae, Spirulidae and Histioteuthidae) and fish (principally Myctophidae), with crustaceans (mainly Decapoda and Isopoda) being somewhat less important.&quot;

Some populations are diurnal, while others are nocturnal. This may be a result of different foraging areas or historical predators that are no longer present.

<doc id="1018347" wikidata="Q3274096" url="?curid=1018347" title="Utility maximization problem">
<text>Utility maximization was first developed by utilitarian philosophers Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. In microeconomics, the utility maximization problem is the problem consumers face: &quot;How should I spend my money in order to maximize my utility?&quot; It is a type of optimal decision problem. It consists of choosing how much of each available good or service to consume, taking into account a constraint on total spending (income), the prices of the goods and their preferences.

Utility maximization is an important concept in consumer theory as it shows how consumers decide to allocate their income. Because consumers are modelled as being rational, they seek to extract the most benefit for themselves. However, due to bounded rationality and other biases, consumers sometimes pick bundles that do not necessarily maximize their utility. The utility maximization bundle of the consumer is also not set and can change over time depending on their individual preferences of goods, price changes and increases or decreases in income.

==Basic setup==
For utility maximization there are four basic steps process to derive consumer demand and find the utility maximizing bundle of the consumer given prices, income, and preferences.

1) Check if Walras&#x27;s law is satisfied
2) &#x27;Bang for buck&#x27;
3) the budget constraint
4) Check for negativity

=== 1) Walras&#x27;s Law ===
Walras&#x27;s law states that if a consumers preferences are complete, monotone and transitive then the optimal demand will lie on the budget line.

==== Preferences of the consumer ====
For a utility representation to exist the preferences of the consumer must be complete and transitive (necessary conditions).

===== Complete =====
Completeness of preferences indicates that all bundles in the consumption set can be compared by the consumer. For example, if the consumer has 3 bundles A,B and C then;

A formula_1 B, A formula_1 C, B formula_1 A, B formula_1C, C formula_1B, C formula_1A, A formula_1A, B formula_1B, C formula_1C. Therefore, the consumer has complete preferences as they can compare every bundle.

===== Transitive =====
Transitivity states that individuals preferences are consistent across the bundles.

therefore, if the consumer weakly prefers A over B (A formula_1 B) and B formula_1C this means that A formula_1 C (A is weakly preferred to C)

===== Monotone =====
For a preference relation to be monotone increasing the quantity of both goods should make the consumer strictly better off (increase their utility), and increasing the quantity of one good holding the other quantity constant should not make the consumer worse off (same utility).

The preference formula_1 is monotone if and only if;

1)formula_14

2) formula_15

3) formula_16

where formula_17 &gt; 0

=== 2) &#x27;Bang for buck&#x27; ===

Bang for buck is a concept in utility maximization which refers to the consumer&#x27;s desire to get the best value for their money. If Walras&#x27;s law has been satisfied, the optimal solution of the consumer lies at the point where the budget line and optimal indifference curve intersect, this is called the tangency condition. To find this point, differentiate the utility function with respect to x and y to find the marginal utilities, then divide by the respective prices of the goods.

formula_18

This can be solved to find the optimal amount of good x or good y.

=== 3) Budget constraint ===
The basic set up of the budget constraint of the consumer is: formula_19

Due to Walras&#x27;s law being satisfied: formula_20

The tangency condition is then substituted into this to solve for the optimal amount of the other good.

=== 4) Check for negativity ===

Negativity must be checked for as the utility maximization problem can give an answer where the optimal demand of a good is negative, which in reality is not possible as this is outside the domain. If the demand for one good is negative, the optimal consumption bundle will be where 0 of this good is consumed and all income is spent on the other good (a corner solution). See figure 1 for an example when the demand for good x is negative.

== A technical representation ==
Suppose the consumer&#x27;s consumption set, or the enumeration of all possible consumption bundles that could be selected if there were a budget constraint.

The consumption set = formula_21 (a set of positive real numbers, the consumer cannot preference negative amount of commodities).

formula_22

Suppose also that the price vector (&quot;p&quot;) of the n commodities is positive,

formula_23

and that the consumer&#x27;s income is formula_24; then the set of all affordable packages, the budget set is,

formula_25

The consumer would like to buy the best affordable package of commodities.

It is assumed that the consumer has an ordinal utility function, called &quot;u&quot;. It is a real-valued function with domain being the set of all commodity bundles, or

:formula_26

Then the consumer&#x27;s optimal choice formula_27 is the utility maximizing bundle of all bundles in the budget set if formula_28 then the consumers optimal demand function is:

formula_29

Finding formula_27 is the utility maximization problem.

If &quot;u&quot; is continuous and no commodities are free of charge, then formula_27 exists, but it is not necessarily unique. If the preferences of the consumer are complete, transitive and strictly convex then the demand of the consumer contains a unique maximiser for all values of the price and wealth parameters. If this is satisfied then formula_27 is called the Marshallian demand function. Otherwise, formula_27 is set-valued and it is called the Marshallian demand correspondence.

== Utility maximisation of perfect complements ==
U = min {x, y} 
For a minimum function with goods that are perfect complements, the same steps cannot be taken to find the utility maximising bundle as it is a non differentiable function. Therefore, intuition must be used. The consumer will maximise their utility at the kink point in the highest indifference curve that intersects the budget line where x = y. This is intuition, as the consumer is rational there is no point the consumer consuming more of one good and not the other good as their utility is taken at the minimum of the two ( they have no gain in utility from this and would be wasting their income). See figure 3.

== Utility maximisation of perfect substitutes ==
U = x + y

For a utility function with perfect substitutes, the utility maximising bundle can be found by differentiation or simply by inspection. Suppose a consumer finds listening to Australian rock bands AC/DC and Tame Impala perfect substitutes. This means that they are happy to spend all afternoon listening to only AC/DC, or only Tame Impala, or three-quarters AC/DC and one-quarter Tame Impala, or any combination of the two bands in any amount. Therefore, the consumer&#x27;s optimal choice is determined entirely by the relative prices of listening to the two artists. If attending a Tame Impala concert is cheaper than attending the AC/DC concert, the consumer chooses to attend the Tame Impala concert, and vice versa. If the two concert prices are the same, the consumer is completely indifferent and may flip a coin to decide. To see this mathematically, differentiate the utility function to find that the MRS is constant - this is the technical meaning of perfect substitutes. As a result of this, the solution to the consumer&#x27;s constrained maximization problem will not (generally) be an interior solution, and as such one must check the utility level in the boundary cases (spend entire budget on good x, spend entire budget on good y) to see which is the solution. The special case is when the (constant) MRS equals the price ratio (for example, both goods have the same price, and same coefficients in the utility function). In this case, any combination of the two goods is a solution to the consumer problem.

== Reaction to changes in prices ==
For a given level of real wealth, only relative prices matter to consumers, not absolute prices. If consumers reacted to changes in nominal prices and nominal wealth even if relative prices and real wealth remained unchanged, this would be an effect called money illusion. The mathematical first order conditions for a maximum of the consumer problem guarantee that the demand for each good is homogeneous of degree zero jointly in nominal prices and nominal wealth, so there is no money illusion.

When the prices of goods change, the optimal consumption of these goods will depend on the substitution and income effects. The substitution effect says that if the demand for both goods is homogeneous, when the price of one good decreases (holding the price of the other good constant) the consumer will consume more of this good and less of the other as it becomes relatively cheeper. The same goes if the price of one good increases, consumers will buy less of that good and more of the other.

The income effect occurs when the change in prices of goods cause a change in income. If the price of one good rises, then income is decreased (more costly than before to consume the same bundle), the same goes if the price of a good falls, income is increased (cheeper to consume the same bundle, they can therefore consume more of their desired combination of goods).

== Reaction to changes in income ==

If the consumers income is increased their budget line is shifted outwards and they now have more income to spend on either good x, good y, or both depending on their preferences for each good. if both goods x and y were normal goods then consumption of both goods would increase and the optimal bundle would move from A to C (see figure 5). If either x or y were inferior goods, then demand for these would decrease as income rises (the optimal bundle would be at point B or C).

== Bounded rationality ==
for further information see: Bounded rationality

In practice, a consumer may not always pick an optimal bundle. For example, it may require too much thought or too much time. Bounded rationality is a theory that explains this behaviour. Examples of alternatives to utility maximisation due to bounded rationality are; satisficing, elimination by aspects and the mental accounting heuristic.

* The satisficing heuristic is when a consumer defines an aspiration level and looks until they find an option that satisfies this, they will deem this option good enough and stop looking. 
* Elimination by aspects is defining a level for each aspect of a product they want and eliminating all other options that do not meet this requirement e.g. price under $100, colour etc. until there is only one product left which is assumed to be the product the consumer will choose. 
* The mental accounting heuristic: In this strategy it is seen that people often assign subjective values to their money depending on their preferences for different things. A person will develop mental accounts for different expenses, allocate their budget within these, then try to maximise their utility within each account.

== Related concepts ==
The relationship between the utility function and Marshallian demand in the utility maximisation problem mirrors the relationship between the expenditure function and Hicksian demand in the expenditure minimisation problem. In expenditure minimisation the utility level is given and well as the prices of goods, the role of the consumer is to find a minimum level of expenditure required to reach this utility level.

The utilitarian social choice rule is a rule that says that society should choose the alternative that maximizes the &quot;sum&quot; of utilities. While utility-maximization is done by individuals, utility-sum maximization is done by society.

<text>USS &quot;Champlin&quot; (DD-104) was a built for the United States Navy during World War I.

==Description==
The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was an improved and faster version of the preceding . Two different designs were prepared to the same specification that mainly differed in the turbines and boilers used. The ships built to the Bethlehem Steel design, built in the Fore River and Union Iron Works shipyards, mostly used Yarrow boilers that deteriorated badly during service and were mostly scrapped during the 1930s. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a crew of 6 officers and 108 enlisted men.

Performance differed radically between the ships of the class, often due to poor workmanship. The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was powered by two steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of intended to reach a speed of . The ships carried of fuel oil which was intended gave them a range of at .

The ships were armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts and were fitted with two 1-pounder guns for anti-aircraft defense. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A &quot;Y-gun&quot; depth charge thrower was added to many ships.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Champlin&quot;, named in honor of Stephen Champlin, was launched 7 April 1918 by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California; sponsored by Miss G. H. Rolph; and commissioned 11 November 1918.

&quot;Champlin&quot; arrived at Newport, Rhode Island, 12 December 1918 for duty with the Atlantic Fleet. After training operations in the Caribbean, she cleared New York City 19 November 1919 for San Diego, California. Arriving 24 December 1919, she went into reserve with the Pacific Fleet the same day, and cruised on training assignments with a reduced complement until decommissioned 7 June 1922. Laid up at San Diego until her assignment for use in experiments on 19 May 1933, &quot;Champlin&quot; was sunk in tests 12 August 1936.

<doc id="1018357" wikidata="Q7889869" url="?curid=1018357" title="Duel Masters Trading Card Game">
<text>The Duel Masters Trading Card Game is a two-player or two vs. two team collectible card game (CCG) jointly developed by Wizards of the Coast and Takara Tomy (itself an affiliate of Hasbro, which owns WotC). The card game is part of the &quot;Duel Masters&quot; franchise.

The game was released in Japan in May 2002, where it quickly became the number one selling trading card game for over a year. Owing to this popularity, it was released in the United States on March 5, 2004. The game shares several similarities with &quot;&quot;, the world&#x27;s first collectible card game, which was also published by Wizards of the Coast. In fact, &quot;Duel Masters&quot; was originally intended as an alternative tradename for &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot; and the earlier game play was abandoned in the &quot;Duel Masters&quot; manga plot to promote this latest experience.

As in &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot;, &quot;Duel Masters&quot; players summon creatures and cast spells using mana. Key differences include the fact that all creatures and spells can act as mana producers, creatures cannot block attacking creatures without having the “blocker” ability, and that creatures only have one “power” statistic. Furthermore, duelists have shields in the form of cards that go to their hand when “broken” as opposed to &quot;Magic&quot;″s “life points”. Owing to the popularity of &quot;Duel Masters&quot;, four video games (three released for the Game Boy Advance and the other for the PS2) based around the game have been produced, titled &quot;Duel Masters: Kaijudo Showdown&quot;, &quot;Duel Masters: Sempai Legends&quot;, &quot;Duel Masters: Shadow of the Code&quot; for the GBA and &quot;Duel Masters: Cobalt&quot; for the PS2.

As of December 2006, the English sets of &quot;Duel Masters&quot; were discontinued by Wizards of the Coast due to weak sales. As of 2024, the game is still published in Japan by Takara Tomy where it&#x27;s still one of the most popular trading card games. 
In June 2012, Wizards of the Coast relaunched Duel Masters for the western market, under a new franchise named &quot;Kaijudo: Rise of the Duel Masters&quot;. Based on the existing Duel Masters brand, Kaijudo featured an online game, trading card game, and a television series. In 2014, the company announced they would stop production of the paper version of the game in the United States.

==Game Play==
In &quot;Duel Masters&quot;, two players play the role of duelists, using the &quot;art&quot; of &quot;kaijudo&quot; (a marketing term created for the North American version which supposedly describes the &quot;art of battling with giant monsters,&quot; from the Japanese words &quot;kaiju&quot;, strange beast or giant monster, and &quot;do&quot;, way or art) to bring their creatures to life to do battle. Players battle each other by placing cards into their respective &quot;mana zones,&quot; then using that mana to cast spells or summon creatures into the &quot;battle zone.&quot;

Each player has five shields that protect them from damage; once these are gone, it takes one successful attack to win the duel. When a player&#x27;s deck runs out of cards, that player automatically loses the duel.

Each player&#x27;s deck must have a minimum of 40 cards in it. As with all trading card games, players construct their own decks out of cards from their collection. Players can purchase booster packs to increase the number of cards they have in their collection. Boosters are available in English for the first 12 DM-series sets, and Japanese for each expansion set released.

<doc id="1018359" wikidata="Q1129121" url="?curid=1018359" title="Splenomegaly">
<text>Splenomegaly is an enlargement of the spleen. The spleen usually lies in the left upper quadrant (LUQ) of the human abdomen. Splenomegaly is one of the four cardinal signs of &quot;hypersplenism&quot; which include: some reduction in number of circulating blood cells affecting granulocytes, erythrocytes or platelets in any combination; a compensatory proliferative response in the bone marrow; and the potential for correction of these abnormalities by splenectomy. Splenomegaly is usually associated with increased workload (such as in hemolytic anemias), which suggests that it is a response to hyperfunction. It is therefore not surprising that splenomegaly is associated with any disease process that involves abnormal red blood cells being destroyed in the spleen. Other common causes include congestion due to portal hypertension and infiltration by leukemias and lymphomas. Thus, the finding of an enlarged spleen, along with caput medusae, is an important sign of portal hypertension.

==Definition==

The standard system for classifying splenomegaly on radiography is:
* Normal (not splenomegaly): the largest dimension is less than 11 cm
* Moderate splenomegaly: the largest dimension is between 11 and 20 cm
* Severe splenomegaly: the largest dimension is greater than 20 cm
Also, a cutoff of a craniocaudal height of 13 cm is also used to define splenomegaly. In addition, individual intervals have been established:

For children, the cutoffs for splenomegaly are given in this table, when measuring the greatest length of the spleen between its dome and its tip, in the coronal plane through its hilum while breathing quietly.

At autopsy, splenomegaly can be defined as a spleen weight above the upper limit of the standard reference range of .

Splenomegaly refers strictly to spleen enlargement, and is distinct from hypersplenism, which connotes overactive function by a spleen of any size. Splenomegaly and hypersplenism should not be confused. Each may be found separately, or they may coexist. Clinically, if a spleen is palpable (felt via external examination), it means it is enlarged as it has to undergo at least twofold enlargement to become palpable. However, the tip of the spleen may be palpable in a newborn baby up to three months of age.

Calculators have been developed for measurements of spleen size based on CT, US, and MRI findings.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms may include abdominal pain, chest pain, chest pain similar to pleuritic pain when stomach, bladder or bowels are full, back pain, early satiety due to splenic encroachment, or the symptoms of anemia due to accompanying cytopenia.

Signs of splenomegaly may include a palpable left upper quadrant abdominal mass or splenic rub. It can be detected on physical examination by using Castell&#x27;s sign, Traube&#x27;s space percussion or Nixon&#x27;s sign, but an ultrasound can be used to confirm diagnosis. In patients where the likelihood of splenomegaly is high, the physical exam is not sufficiently sensitive to detect it; abdominal imaging is indicated in such patients.

In cases of infectious mononucleosis splenomegaly is a common symptom and health care providers may consider using abdominal ultrasonography to get insight into a person&#x27;s condition. However, because spleen size varies greatly, ultrasonography is not a valid technique for assessing spleen enlargement and should not be used in typical circumstances or to make routine decisions about fitness for playing sports.

==Causes==
The most common causes of splenomegaly in developed countries are infectious mononucleosis, splenic infiltration with cancer cells from a hematological malignancy and portal hypertension (most commonly secondary to liver disease, and sarcoidosis). Splenomegaly may also come from bacterial infections, such as syphilis or an infection of the heart&#x27;s inner lining (endocarditis). Splenomegaly also occurs in mammals parasitized by &quot;Cuterebra fontinella&quot;.

The possible causes of moderate splenomegaly (spleen &lt;1000 g) are many, and include:

The causes of massive splenomegaly (spleen &gt;1000 g) are
* chronic myelogenous leukemia
* myelofibrosis
* malaria
* splenic marginal zone lymphoma

==Pathophysiology==

Splenomegaly can be classified based on its pathophysiologic mechanism:
* Congestive, by pooled blood (e.g., portal hypertension)
* Infiltrative, by invasion by cells foreign to the splenic environment (e.g., metastases, myeloid neoplasms, lipid storage diseases)
* Immune, by an increase in immunologic activity and subsequent hyperplasia (e.g., endocarditis, sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis)
* Neoplastic, when resident immune cells originate a neoplasm (e.g., lymphoma).

==Diagnosis==
Abdominal CT is the most accurate. The spleen needs to be 2–3 times larger than normal to be palpable below the costal margin in physical examination.

==Treatment==
If the splenomegaly underlies hypersplenism, a splenectomy is indicated and will correct the hypersplenism. However, the underlying cause of the hypersplenism will most likely remain; consequently, a thorough diagnostic workup is still indicated, as, leukemia, lymphoma and other serious disorders can cause hypersplenism and splenomegaly. After splenectomy, however, patients have an increased risk for infectious diseases.

Patients undergoing splenectomy should be vaccinated against &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, and &quot;Meningococcus&quot;. They should also receive annual influenza vaccinations. Long-term prophylactic antibiotics may be given in certain cases.

==As an adaptation==
An enlarged spleen may be an inherited, adaptive trait selected in populations that need extra oxygen carry capacity such as deep sea divers. The Sama-Bajau people, notable for free-diving, have spleens that are 50% larger than those of nearby ethnic groups.

<text>HAVAL is a cryptographic hash function. Unlike MD5, but like most modern cryptographic hash functions, HAVAL can produce hashes of different lengths – 128 bits, 160 bits, 192 bits, 224 bits, and 256 bits. HAVAL also allows users to specify the number of rounds (3, 4, or 5) to be used to generate the hash. HAVAL was broken in 2004.

HAVAL was invented by Yuliang Zheng, Josef Pieprzyk, and Jennifer Seberry in 1992.

==HAVAL hashes==
The HAVAL hashes (also termed &quot;fingerprints&quot;) are typically represented as 32-, 40-, 48-, 56- or 64-digit hexadecimal numbers. The following demonstrates a 43-byte ASCII input and the corresponding HAVAL hash (256 bits, 5 passes):

 HAVAL(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy og&quot;, 256, 5) =
 b89c551cdfe2e06dbd4cea2be1bc7d557416c58ebb4d07cbc94e49f710c55be4

Even a small change in the message will (with overwhelming probability) result in a completely different hash, e.g. changing the letter to a produces the following hash value:

 HAVAL(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy og&quot;, 256, 5) =
 60983bb8c8f49ad3bea29899b78cd741f4c96e911bbc272e5550a4f195a4077e

The hash of a zero-length string is:

 HAVAL(&quot;&quot;, 256, 5) =
 be417bb4dd5cfb76c7126f4f8eeb1553a449039307b1a3cd451dbfdc0fbbe330

==Security==
Research has uncovered weaknesses which make further use of HAVAL (at least the variant with 128 bits and 3 passes with 26 operations) questionable. On 17 August 2004, collisions for HAVAL (128 bits, 3 passes) were announced by Xiaoyun Wang, Dengguo Feng, Xuejia Lai, and Hongbo Yu.

<doc id="1018365" wikidata="Q235710" url="?curid=1018365" title="Futurama (video game)">
<text>Futurama is a 3D platform video game based on the science fiction animated series of the same name. It was developed by Unique Development Studios for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, both of which use cel-shading technology. The cutscenes of the game are presented as an entire &quot;lost episode&quot; of &quot;Futurama&quot; on the DVD of &quot;&quot;.

The game is considered to be as one of the rarest and most expensive game on PlayStation 2 and Xbox in a physical copy, ranging in places like eBay around 200$ to 800$. Mainly due to incredibly low selling of the game, since it saw a very limited run of printings and partly due to show&#x27;s cancellation not long after its release.

==Gameplay==
Gameplay is a mix of shooting and platforming. As the game progresses, players play as each of four characters: Fry, Bender, Leela and Zoidberg. Fry&#x27;s levels mostly involve shooter mechanics, as he can use a multitude of guns. Bender&#x27;s levels are platformer-oriented, while Leela&#x27;s revolve around hand-to-hand combat. Zoidberg is featured in a short segment as well. There are several Nibblers hidden in each level; collecting them unlocks extras such as movie clips and galleries.

==Plot==
The game begins with Professor Farnsworth, wearing a sombrero, selling the Planet Express delivery company to Mom, explaining that it had been losing money for years due to mismanagement. The buyout gives Mom ownership of more than fifty percent of Earth, allowing her to become the planet&#x27;s supreme ruler. Soon after this, she enslaves humanity.

Finding the ship inexplicably broken, the Professor tasks Leela and Bender with repairing it, and sends Fry off to find a hammer to keep him out of the way. After Fry is crushed to death under a pile of debris, he is resurrected by the Professor&#x27;s new invention, the Re-animator (which closely resembles a giant toaster), which brings the crew back to life every time they die. Fry is then tasked with locating the Professor&#x27;s missing tools.

After discovering that the ship&#x27;s dark matter engine is beyond repair, and informing the crew that the back-up was pawned in exchange for a gun, the Professor sends Fry off to retrieve it, having to travel via the sewers to avoid curfew. After Fry returns, they escape from Earth with the Re-animator.

However, Mom pursues them in an effort to capture Farnsworth. She hopes to turn Earth into a giant warship, and Farnsworth is the only person who knows how to build an engine large enough to move the Earth. After Bender frees the ship from a suck beam generated from a desert asteroid, Mom ultimately captures Farnsworth, places his head in a jar, and sends the ship hurtling into the Sun with Fry, Leela, and Bender on board.

After discovering that the Sun is habitable, Leela helps the Sun People to defeat their evil Sun God in exchange for a full tank of dark matter. After Leela destroys the Sun Temple, the crew then head for the planet of Bogad, where Farnsworth&#x27;s mentor, Adoy, lives. Adoy has invented a time machine, but its generator is inconveniently placed a great distance away, with hazardous swamps in the way. Using the time machine&#x27;s hand crank, which turns back time by two minutes if cranked for that long, Zoidberg (who had inexplicably appeared on Bogad &quot;making a cameo&quot;) manages to reach and activate the generator. Fry, Leela and Bender manage to travel back to a few minutes before Mom buys Planet Express from the Professor. However, the ship crashes into Planet Express, destroying the ship. This prompts them to steal the ship of the past, leaving the broken ship to be repaired by their past selves. They attempt to stop the sale, which prompts Mom to send Destructor to attack them. They defeat the robot, but the Re-animator gets damaged and falls on Destructor, causing it to fall on top of them. Angry at the fact that the robot killed his crew, the professor refuses to sell Planet Express. But after Mom bribes him with a sombrero, he sells, and the events of the game continue in an endless cycle.

==Development==
Development on the game started before the series&#x27; cancellation, but the game was not released until after the last episode of season 4 had already been shown. Thus, the game has been known as a &quot;lost episode&quot; of sorts since it includes 28 minutes of new animation.

Many of the crew from the &quot;Futurama&quot; series worked on the game. Matt Groening served as Executive game developer and David X. Cohen directed the voice actors. These voice actors were the original actors from the series: Billy West, Katey Sagal, John DiMaggio, Tress MacNeille, Maurice LaMarche, and David Herman. Cast members Phil LaMarr and Lauren Tom weren&#x27;t included in the game due to budgetary reasons. Also adding to the authenticity of the game was the original music composition provided by Christopher Tyng who also composed the music in the series and &quot;Futurama&quot; scriptwriter and producer J. Stewart Burns who scripted an original storyline for the plot. The music during the end credits of the game is later used in the four straight-to-DVD &quot;Futurama&quot; films: in the extended intro of &quot;Bender&#x27;s Big Score&quot;, and rearranged versions during the end credits of the subsequent three films.

A GameCube version was planned for release, but was cancelled due to console&#x27;s slow sales in the United States.

===&quot;Futurama: The Lost Adventure&quot;===
The cutscenes, along with some in-game footage provided by Cohen, were compiled into a 30-minute feature titled &quot;&quot; (described by Cohen as &quot;the 73rd episode&quot;) and included as a special feature with the direct-to-DVD movie &quot;&quot;. With Unique Development Studios having gone out of business, the production team were unable to acquire the original full-quality video files for the cutscenes and instead sourced the footage by recording video from an Xbox console running the game. The &quot;Lost Adventure&quot; compilation also removes meta references to being a video game and adds new effects to the sound mix.

==Reception==
&quot;Futurama&quot; received &quot;mixed&quot; reviews from critics. A video game review aggregator Metacritic. critics praised game&#x27;s cutscences and humor, but Gameplay was generally criticized.

Gameplay was generally considered lackluster, though the cutscenes were described in Wired as &quot;side-splitting&quot;.

Douglass C. Perry from an American video game and entertainment media website IGN gave the game 6.7 out of 10, and praised game&#x27;s story, Cel-shaded visual, sound design, cutscences, voice-acting and it&#x27;s performance, though criticized it&#x27;s cheap and unforgiving AI, poor collision detection, punishing and frustrating difficulty, shoddy controls, and overall bearable roughness and distinct lack of polish in both playability and graphic finesse of the gameplay.

Tim Tracy of an American video game and entertainment media website GameSpot gave 4.9/10 (Poor). Though praised voice-acting, cutscenes, Cel-shaded visual, writing and plot overall, criticized was camera and targeting (aiming) system.

&quot;Maxim&quot; of now gave the game a score of six out of ten and said: &quot;It&#x27;s too bad that clunky controls and &quot;eh&quot; game play stay forever buried in a time lock of dull sloppiness.&quot; 

Russian magazine &quot;Strana Igr&quot; gave the game 6.5 out of 10, calling the game ordinary and uninteresting.

<text>Edward Irving Edwards (December 1, 1863 – January 26, 1931) was an American attorney, banker, and Democratic Party politician who served as the 37th Governor of New Jersey from 1920 to 1923 and represented the state in the United States Senate from 1923 to 1929. He was a leading critic of Prohibition.

==Early life and career==
Edwards was born on December 1, 1863, in Jersey City, New Jersey, the son of Emma J. (Nation) and William W. Edwards.

Edwards attended Jersey City High School (since renamed as William L. Dickinson High School) and attended New York University from 1880 to 1882. He later studied law in the office of his brother, William David Edwards, who also represented Hudson County in the State Senate from 1887 to 1889.

He engaged in banking and in the general contracting business. He later became president and chairman of the board of directors of the First National Bank of Jersey City. As a businessman with an interest in politics and a State Senator for a brother, he attracted the attention of the powerful Hudson County Democratic machine.

Edwards served as state comptroller from 1911 to 1917 and was elected to the New Jersey Senate in 1918. He became a friend and close political ally of Mayor Frank Hague, the boss of the Democratic machine.

== Governor of New Jersey (1920–23) ==

=== 1919 election ===

In the Democratic primary, his opponent was James R. Nugent, chair of the Essex County party and former state party boss. The campaign became a proxy for Frank Hague&#x27;s struggle with Nugent for state power, and Edwards emerged victorious with 53.6 percent of the vote. He carried fifteen counties and a huge majority in Hudson County; Hague emerged as the undisputed leader of the New Jersey Democratic Party, which he would dominate through the late 1940s.

In the general election, Edwards faced Newton A.K. Bugbee. Despite Republican victories throughout the northeast in reaction to Wilson&#x27;s unpopularity, nationwide labor and racial unrest, and anarchist terrorism, Edwards prevailed narrowly. With the exception of a Camden trolly strike, the New Jersey campaign focused on the single issue of the prohibition of alcohol, following the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in January 1919 and the passage of the Volstead Act over President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s veto on October 28. An Elizabeth daily newspaper dubbed Edwards&#x27;s campaign the &quot;Applejack Campaign,&quot; because although Edwards personally did not drink alcohol, he ran as an avowed &quot;wet&quot; opponent of prohibition. His victory was attributed to an urban political revolt by Catholic and ethnic immigrants, overcoming those groups&#x27; dissatisfaction with Wilson&#x27;s proposal for the League of Nations. Historian Warren E. Stickle has referred to the election as the &quot;Edwards Revolution,&quot; as it significantly reshaped New Jersey politics for the twentieth century and served a prelude to the New Deal coalition.

=== Term in office ===

Edwards&#x27;s time in office was defined by Republican domination of the state legislature; the State Senate, which then apportioned one vote per county, was dominated by rural and small-town interests which increasingly aligned with Republicans and against Edwards&#x27;s urban base. Following the 1920 Republican landslide, the General Assembly was also dominated by Republicans—only one Democratic member was elected to serve in the legislature of 1921–22. Thus, Edwards played only a minor role in legislation as Governor; the Republican majorities frustrated much of his own program and repeatedly passed their own legislation over his veto, including the establishment of the Port Authority (which Edwards later supported) and the New Jersey State Police.

On prohibition, Edwards did briefly succeed in passing a bill which permitted the sale and manufacture of beverages with less than 3.5 percent alcohol content, which he signed on March 2, 1920; it was repealed in January 1921 and laws for the enforcement of prohibition were passed over Edwards&#x27;s veto. With his legislative power cut off, Edwards instead exercised executive power by joining the state as a plaintiff in &quot;Rhode Island v. Palma&quot;, a challenge to the constitutionality of prohibition policies. He also called on Congress to modify the Volstead Act to permit the sale of light wines and beer. Because of his aggressive public stance against Prohibition, his name was entered in the Illinois and New Jersey presidential preference primaries in 1920; he won both.

Edwards also used his appointments power to fire the members of the Public Utility Commission as part of a fight for reduced rates, but the Republican legislature established a new commission over his veto. He also opposed blue laws which restricted activity on Sundays and supported the arrangement of boxing matches in the state against moral objections.

== United States Senator (1923–29) ==
With his term in office expiring in 1923, Edwards spent his final year as Governor running for the United States Senate against incumbent Senator Joseph S. Frelinghuysen. Running on a slogan of &quot;Wine, Women, and Song,&quot; Edwards ran against the Republican platform of &quot;100-percent Americanism, blue laws, Sunday closing laws, compulsory English lessons, immigration restriction, and prohibition.&quot; He carried the race over Frelinghuysen by a convincing margin, dramatically reversing President Harding&#x27;s landslide victory by re-establishing and enlarging his 1919 coalition. His victory also further established Frank Hague&#x27;s domination over the party.

In 1928, Edwards ran for re-election to the Senate, continuing to emphasize his opposition to Prohibition. His opponent, Hamilton Fish Kean, however, came out publicly for modification of the Volstead Act and, in early October, declared himself as opposed to Prohibition as Edwards. Though the Anti-Saloon League revoked its endorsement of Kean, he won in a landslide, helped by a general feeling of prosperity associated with Republican President Calvin Coolidge and rural opposition to the more urban Democratic coalition.

== Personal life ==
Edwards married Blanche Smith on November 14, 1888. They had two children, Edward Irving Jr. and Elizabeth Jule. She died in 1928.

He was a member of the Episcopal Church and a Freemason.

==Later life and death==
Following his wife&#x27;s death and his departure from office in March 1929, Edwards&#x27;s fortunes continued to decline. He went broke in the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and was implicated in an electoral fraud scandal. Politically, he broke with Frank Hague and threatened to join the reform coalition against Hague in the 1930 election. He initially sought to run for Governor in 1931, but found himself blocked by Hague&#x27;s preferred choice, A. Harry Moore.

Edwards was diagnosed with skin cancer and shot himself in his apartment at 131 Kensington Avenue in Jersey City, New Jersey on January 26, 1931. He was 67 years old. He was buried in Bayview – New York Bay Cemetery in the plot of his older brother, William David Edwards, who died in 1916.

<text>Water reclamation is the process of converting municipal wastewater or sewage and industrial wastewater into water that can be reused for a variety of purposes . It is also called wastewater reuse, water reuse or water recycling. There are many types of reuse. It is possible to reuse water in this way in cities or for irrigation in agriculture. Other types of reuse are environmental reuse, industrial reuse, and reuse for drinking water, whether planned or not. Reuse may include irrigation of gardens and agricultural fields or replenishing surface water and groundwater. This latter is also known as groundwater recharge. Reused water also serve various needs in residences such as toilet flushing, businesses, and industry. It is possible to treat wastewater to reach drinking water standards. Injecting reclaimed water into the water supply distribution system is known as direct potable reuse. Drinking reclaimed water is not typical. Reusing treated municipal wastewater for irrigation is a long-established practice. This is especially so in arid countries. Reusing wastewater as part of sustainable water management allows water to remain an alternative water source for human activities. This can reduce scarcity. It also eases pressures on groundwater and other natural water bodies.

There are several technologies used to treat wastewater for reuse. A combination of these technologies can meet strict treatment standards and make sure that the processed water is hygienically safe, meaning free from pathogens. The following are some of the typical technologies: Ozonation, ultrafiltration, aerobic treatment (membrane bioreactor), forward osmosis, reverse osmosis, and advanced oxidation, or activated carbon. Some water-demanding activities do not require high grade water. In this case, wastewater can be reused with little or no treatment.

The cost of reclaimed water exceeds that of potable water in many regions of the world, where fresh water is plentiful. The costs of water reclamation options might be compared to the costs of alternative options which also achieve similar effects of freshwater savings, namely greywater reuse systems, rainwater harvesting and stormwater recovery, or seawater desalination.

Water recycling and reuse is of increasing importance, not only in arid regions but also in cities and contaminated environments. Municipal wastewater reuse is particularly high in the Middle East and North Africa region, in countries such as the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and Israel.

== Definition ==
The term &quot;water reuse&quot; is generally used interchangeably with terms such as wastewater reuse, water reclamation, and water recycling. A definition by the USEPA states: &quot;Water reuse is the method of recycling treated wastewater for beneficial purposes, such as agricultural and landscape irrigation, industrial processes, toilet flushing, and groundwater replenishing (EPA, 2004).&quot; A similar description is: &quot;Water Reuse, the use of reclaimed water from treated wastewater, has been a long-established reality in many (semi)arid countries and regions. It helps to alleviate water scarcity by supplementing limited freshwater resources.&quot;

The water that is used as an input to the treatment and reuse processes can be from a variety of sources. Usually it is wastewater (domestic or municipal, industrial or agricultural wastewater) but it could also come from urban runoff.

== Overview ==
Reclaimed water is water that is used more than one time before it passes back into the natural water cycle. Advances in municipal wastewater treatment technology allow communities to reuse water for many different purposes. The water is treated differently depending upon the source and use of the water as well as how it gets delivered.

=== Driving forces ===
The World Health Organization has recognized the following principal driving forces for municipal wastewater reuse: 
#increasing water scarcity and stress,
#increasing populations and related food security issues,
#increasing environmental pollution from improper wastewater disposal, and
#increasing recognition of the resource value of wastewater, excreta and greywater.
In some areas, one driving force is also the implementation of advanced wastewater treatment for the removal of organic micropollutants, which leads to an overall improved water quality. 

Water recycling and reuse is of increasing importance, not only in arid regions but also in cities and contaminated environments.

Already, the groundwater aquifers that are used by over half of the world population are being over-drafted. Reuse will continue to increase as the world&#x27;s population becomes increasingly urbanized and concentrated near coastlines, where local freshwater supplies are limited or are available only with large capital expenditure. Large quantities of freshwater can be saved by municipal wastewater reuse and recycling, reducing environmental pollution and improving carbon footprint. Reuse can be an alternative water supply option.

Achieving more sustainable sanitation and wastewater management will require emphasis on actions linked to resource management, such as wastewater reuse or excreta reuse that will keep valuable resources available for productive uses. This in turn supports human wellbeing and broader sustainability.

=== Potential benefits ===
Water/wastewater reuse, as an alternative water source, can provide significant economic, social and environmental benefits, which are key motivators for implementing such reuse programs. These benefits include: 
* For cities and households: Increased water availability (drinking water substitution – keep drinking water for drinking and reclaimed water for non-drinking use such as industry, cleaning, irrigation, domestic uses, and toilet flushing).
* For the environment: Reduced nutrient loads to receiving waters (i.e. rivers, canals and other surface water resources); reduced over-abstraction of surface and groundwater; enhanced environmental protection by restoration of streams, wetlands and ponds; reduced energy consumption associated with production, treatment, and distribution of water (1.2 to 2.1 kWh/m3) compared to using deep groundwater resources, water importation or desalination 
* Reduced manufacturing costs of using high quality reclaimed water
* In agriculture: Irrigation with treated wastewater may contribute to improve production yields, reduce the ecological footprint and promote socioeconomic benefits. It may also lead to reduced application of fertilizers (i.e. conservation of nutrients and reducing the need for artificial fertilizer through soil nutrition by the nutrients existing in the treated effluents).
Reclaiming water for reuse applications instead of using freshwater supplies can be a water-saving measure. When used water is eventually discharged back into natural water sources, it can still have benefits to ecosystems, improving streamflow, nourishing plant life and recharging aquifers, as part of the natural water cycle.

===Scale===

Global treated wastewater reuse is estimated at 40.7 billion m3 per year, representing approximately 11% of the total domestic and manufacturing wastewater produced. Municipal wastewater reuse is particularly high in the Middle East and North Africa region, in countries such as the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and Israel.

For the Sustainable Development Goal 6 by the United Nations, Target 6.3 states &quot;Halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally by 2030&quot;.

== Types and applications ==

Treated wastewater can be reused in industry (for example in cooling towers), in artificial recharge of aquifers, in agriculture, and in the rehabilitation of natural ecosystems (for example in wetlands). The main reclaimed water applications in the world are shown below:

=== Urban reuse ===
In rarer cases reclaimed water is also used to augment drinking water supplies. Most of the uses of water reclamation are non-potable uses such as washing cars, flushing toilets, cooling water for power plants, concrete mixing, artificial lakes, irrigation for golf courses and public parks, and for hydraulic fracturing. Where applicable, systems run a dual piping system to keep the recycled water separate from the potable water.

Usage types are distinguished as follows:
* Unrestricted: The use of reclaimed water for non-potable applications in municipal settings, where public access is not restricted.
* Restricted: The use of reclaimed water for non-potable applications in municipal settings, where public access is controlled or restricted by physical or institutional barriers, such as fencing, advisory signage, or temporal access restriction.

=== Agricultural reuse ===

Irrigation with recycled municipal wastewater can also serve to fertilize plants if it contains nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. There are benefits of using recycled water for irrigation, including the lower cost compared to some other sources and consistency of supply regardless of season, climatic conditions and associated water restrictions. When reclaimed water is used for irrigation in agriculture, the nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) content of the treated wastewater has the benefit of acting as a fertilizer. This can make the reuse of excreta contained in sewage attractive.

The irrigation water can be used in different ways on different crops, such as for food crops to be eaten raw or for crops which are intended for human consumption to be eaten raw or unprocessed. For processed food crops: crops which are intended for human consumption not to be eaten raw but after food processing (i.e. cooked, industrially processed). It can also be used on crops which are not intended for human consumption (e.g. pastures, forage, fiber, ornamental, seed, forest and turf crops).
==== Risks in agricultural reuse ====
In developing countries, agriculture is increasingly using untreated municipal wastewater for irrigation – often in an unsafe manner. Cities provide lucrative markets for fresh produce, so they are attractive to farmers. However, because agriculture has to compete for increasingly scarce water resources with industry and municipal users, there is often no alternative for farmers but to use water polluted with urban waste directly to water their crops.

There can be significant health hazards related to using untreated wastewater in agriculture. Municipal wastewater can contain a mixture of chemical and biological pollutants. In low-income countries, there are often high levels of pathogens from excreta. In emerging nations, where industrial development is outpacing environmental regulation, there are increasing risks from inorganic and organic chemicals. The World Health Organization developed guidelines for safe use of wastewater in 2006, advocating a ‘multiple-barrier&#x27; approach wastewater use, for example by encouraging farmers to adopt various risk-reducing behaviors. These include ceasing irrigation a few days before harvesting to allow pathogens to die off in the sunlight; applying water carefully so it does not contaminate leaves likely to be eaten raw; cleaning vegetables with disinfectant; or allowing fecal sludge used in farming to dry before being used as a human manure.

Drawbacks or risks often mentioned include the content of potentially harmful substances such as bacteria, heavy metals, or organic pollutants (including pharmaceuticals, personal care products and pesticides). Irrigation with wastewater can have both positive and negative effects on soil and plants, depending on the composition of the wastewater and on the soil or plant characteristics.

=== Environmental reuse ===
The use of reclaimed water to create, enhance, sustain, or augment water bodies including wetlands, aquatic habitats, or stream flow is called &quot;environmental reuse&quot;. For example, constructed wetlands fed by wastewater provide both wastewater treatment and habitats for flora and fauna.

=== Industrial reuse ===
Treated wastewater can be reused in industry (for example in cooling towers).

=== Planned potable reuse ===
Planned potable reuse is publicly acknowledged as an intentional project to recycle water for drinking water. There are two ways in which potable water can be delivered for reuse – &quot;Indirect Potable Reuse&quot; (IPR) and &quot;Direct Potable Reuse&quot;. Both these forms of reuse are described below, and commonly involve a more formal public process and public consultation program than is the case with de facto or unacknowledged reuse.

Some water agencies reuse highly treated effluent from municipal wastewater or resource recovery plants as a reliable, drought-proof source of drinking water. By using advanced purification processes, they produce water that meets all applicable drinking water standards. System reliability and frequent monitoring and testing are imperative to their meeting stringent controls.

The water needs of a community, water sources, public health regulations, costs, and the types of water infrastructure in place— such as distribution systems, man-made reservoirs, or natural groundwater basins— determine if and how reclaimed water can be part of the drinking water supply. Some communities reuse water to replenish groundwater basins. Others put it into surface water reservoirs. In these instances the reclaimed water is blended with other water supplies and/or sits in storage for a certain amount of time before it is drawn out and gets treated again at a water treatment or distribution system. In some communities, the reused water is put directly into pipelines that go to a water treatment plant or distribution system.

Modern technologies such as reverse osmosis and ultraviolet disinfection are commonly used when reclaimed water will be mixed with the drinking water supply.

Many people associate a feeling of disgust with reclaimed water and 13% of a survey group said they would not even sip it. Nonetheless, the main health risk for potable use of reclaimed water is the potential for pharmaceutical and other household chemicals or their derivatives (environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants) to persist in this water. This would be less of a concern if human excreta was kept out of sewage by using dry toilets or, alternatively, systems that treat blackwater separately from greywater.

==== Indirect potable reuse ====
Indirect potable reuse (IPR) means the water is delivered to the consumer indirectly. After it is purified, the reused water blends with other supplies and/or sits a while in some sort of storage, man-made or natural, before it gets delivered to a pipeline that leads to a water treatment plant or distribution system. That storage could be a groundwater basin or a surface water reservoir.

Some municipalities are using and others are investigating IPR of reclaimed water. For example, reclaimed water may be pumped into (subsurface recharge) or percolated down to (surface recharge) groundwater aquifers, pumped out, treated again, and finally used as drinking water. This technique may also be referred to as &quot;groundwater recharging&quot;. This includes slow processes of further multiple purification steps via the layers of earth/sand (absorption) and microflora in the soil (biodegradation).

IPR or even unplanned potable use of reclaimed wastewater is used in many countries, where the latter is discharged into groundwater to hold back saline intrusion in coastal aquifers. IPR has generally included some type of environmental buffer, but conditions in certain areas have created an urgent need for more direct alternatives.
IPR occurs through the augmentation of drinking water supplies with municipal wastewater treated to a level suitable for IPR followed by an environmental buffer (e.g. rivers, dams, aquifers, etc.) that precedes drinking water treatment. In this case, municipal wastewater passes through a series of treatment steps that encompasses membrane filtration and separation processes (e.g. MF, UF and RO), followed by an advanced chemical oxidation process (e.g. UV, UV+H2O2, ozone). In ‘indirect&#x27; potable reuse applications, the reclaimed wastewater is used directly or mixed with other sources.

==== Direct potable reuse ====
Direct potable reuse (DPR) means the reused water is put directly into pipelines that go to a water treatment plant or distribution system. Direct potable reuse may occur with or without &quot;engineered storage&quot; such as underground or above ground tanks. In other words, DPR is the introduction of reclaimed water derived from domestic wastewater after extensive treatment and monitoring to assure that strict water quality requirements are met at all times, directly into a municipal water supply system.

=== Reuse in space stations ===
Wastewater reclamation can be especially important in relation to human spaceflight. In 1998, NASA announced it had built a human waste reclamation bioreactor designed for use in the International Space Station and a crewed Mars mission. Human urine and feces are input into one end of the reactor and pure oxygen, pure water, and compost (humanure) are output from the other end. The soil could be used for growing vegetables, and the bioreactor also produces electricity.

Aboard the International Space Station, astronauts have been able to drink recycled urine due to the introduction of the ECLSS system. The system costs $250 million and has been working since May 2009. The system recycles wastewater and urine back into potable water used for drinking, food preparation, and oxygen generation. This cuts back on the need to frequently resupply the space station.

=== De facto wastewater reuse (unplanned potable reuse) ===
De facto, unacknowledged or unplanned potable reuse refers to situations where reuse of treated wastewater is practiced but is not officially recognized. For example, a sewage treatment plant from one city may be discharging effluents to a river which is used as a drinking water supply for another city downstream.

Unplanned Indirect Potable Use has existed for a long time. Large towns on the River Thames upstream of London (Oxford, Reading, Swindon, Bracknell) discharge their treated sewage (&quot;non-potable water&quot;) into the Thames, which supplies water to London downstream. In the United States, the Mississippi River serves as both the destination of sewage treatment plant effluent and the source of potable water.

== Design considerations ==
=== Distribution ===

Non-potable reclaimed water is often distributed with a dual piping network that keeps reclaimed water pipes completely separate from potable water pipes.

=== Treatment processes ===

There are several technologies used to treat wastewater for reuse. A combination of these technologies can meet strict treatment standards and make sure that the processed water is hygienically safe, meaning free from pathogens. Some common technologies include ozonation, ultrafiltration, aerobic treatment (membrane bioreactor), forward osmosis, reverse osmosis, advanced oxidation or activated carbon. Reclaimed water providers use multi-barrier treatment processes and constant monitoring to ensure that reclaimed water is safe and treated properly for the intended end use.

Some water-demanding activities do not require high grade water. In this case, wastewater can be reused with little or no treatment. One example of this scenario is in the domestic environment where toilets can be flushed using greywater from baths and showers with little or no treatment.

In the case of municipal wastewater, the wastewater must pass through numerous sewage treatment process steps before it can be used. Steps might include screening, primary settling, biological treatment, tertiary treatment (for example reverse osmosis), and disinfection.

Wastewater is generally treated to only secondary level treatment when used for irrigation.

A pump station distributes reclaimed water to users around a city. These may include golf courses, agricultural uses, cooling towers, or landfills.

=== Alternative options ===
Rather than treating municipal wastewater for reuse purposes, other options can achieve similar effects of freshwater savings: 
* Greywater reuse systems – at a household level, treated or untreated greywater may be used for flush toilets or to water a garden.
* Rainwater harvesting and stormwater recovery – Urban design systems which incorporate rainwater harvesting and reduce runoff are known as water-sensitive urban design (WSUD) in Australia, low-impact development (LID) in the United States and sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) in the United Kingdom. 
* Seawater desalination – an energy-intensive process where salt and other minerals are removed from seawater to produce potable water for drinking and irrigation, typically through membrane filtration (reverse osmosis) or steam distillation.

=== Costs ===
The cost of reclaimed water exceeds that of potable water in many regions of the world, where fresh water is plentiful. However, reclaimed water is usually sold to citizens at a cheaper rate to encourage its use. As fresh water supplies become limited from distribution costs, increased population demands, or climate change, the cost ratios will evolve also. The evaluation of reclaimed water needs to consider the entire water supply system, as it may bring important flexibility into the overall system 

Reclaimed water systems usually require a dual piping network, often with additional storage tanks, which adds to the costs of the system.

=== Barriers to implementation ===
Barriers to water reclamation may include:
* Full-scale implementation and operation of water reuse schemes still face regulatory, economic, social and institutional challenges. 
* Low economic viability of water reuse schemes. This may partly be due to costs of water quality monitoring and identification of contaminants. Difficulties in contaminant identification may include the separation of inorganic and organic pollutants, microorganisms, colloids, and others. Full cost recovery from water reuse schemes is difficult. There is a lack of financial water pricing systems comparable to already subsidized conventional treatment plants.
*Psychological barriers, sometimes referred to as the &quot;yuck factor&quot;, can also be an impediment to implementation, particularly for direct potable reuse plans. These psychological factors are closely associated with disgust, specifically pathogen avoidance.

== Health aspects ==

Reclaimed water is considered safe when appropriately used. Reclaimed water planned for use in recharging aquifers or augmenting surface water receives adequate and reliable treatment before mixing with naturally occurring water and undergoing natural restoration processes. Some of this water eventually becomes part of drinking water supplies.

A study published in 2009 compared the differences in water quality between reclaimed/recycled water, surface water, and groundwater. Results indicated that reclaimed water, surface water, and groundwater are more similar than dissimilar with regard to constituents. The researchers tested for 244 representative constituents typically found in water. When detected, most constituents were in the parts-per-billion and parts-per-trillion range. DEET (an insect repellant) and caffeine were found in all water types and in virtually all samples. Triclosan (in antibacterial soap and toothpaste) was found in all water types, but detected in higher levels (parts-per-trillion) in reclaimed water than in surface or groundwater. Very few hormones/steroids were detected in samples, and when detected were at very low levels. Haloacetic acids (a disinfection by-product) were found in all types of samples, even groundwater. The largest difference between reclaimed water and the other waters appears to be that reclaimed water has been disinfected and thus has disinfection byproducts (due to chlorine use).

A 2005 study found that there had been no instances of illness or disease from either microbial pathogens or chemicals, and the risks of using reclaimed water for irrigation are not measurably different from irrigation using potable water.

A 2012 study conducted by the National Research Council in the United States found that the risk of exposure to certain microbial and chemical contaminants from drinking reclaimed water does not appear to be higher than the risk experienced in some current drinking water treatment systems, and may be orders of magnitude lower. This report recommends adjustments to the federal regulatory framework that could enhance public health protection for both planned and unplanned (or &quot;de facto&quot; reuse) and increase public confidence in water reuse.

== Environmental aspects ==

Using reclaimed water for non-potable uses saves potable water for drinking, since less potable water will be used for non-potable uses.

It sometimes contains higher levels of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and oxygen which may help fertilize garden and agricultural plants when used for irrigation.

Fresh water makes up less than 3% of the world&#x27;s water resources, and just 1% of that is readily available. Even though fresh water is scarce, just 3% of it is extracted for human consumption. The remaining water is mostly used for agriculture, which uses roughly two-thirds of all fresh water.

Reclaimed water can offer a viable and effective alternative to freshwater where freshwater supplies are scarce. Reclaimed water is utilized to maintain or increase lake levels, restore wetlands, and restore river flows during hot weather and droughts, protecting biodiversity. Additionally, reclaimed water is utilized for street cleaning, irrigation of urban green spaces, and industrial processes. Reclaimed water has the advantage of being a consistent source of water supply that is unaffected by seasonal droughts and weather changes.

The usage of water reclamation decreases the pollution sent to sensitive environments. It can also enhance wetlands, which benefits the wildlife depending on that ecosystem. It also helps to reduce the likelihood of drought as recycling of water reduces the use of fresh water supply from underground sources. For instance, the San Jose/Santa Clara Water Pollution Control Plant instituted a water recycling program to protect the San Francisco Bay area&#x27;s natural salt water marshes.

The main potential risks that are associated with reclaimed wastewater reuse for irrigation purposes when the treatment is not adequate are the following: 
# Contamination of the food chain with microcontaminants, pathogens (i.e. bacteria, viruses, protozoa, helminths), or antibiotic resistance determinants; 
# Soil salinization and accumulation of various unknown constituents that might adversely affect agricultural production; 
# Distribution of the indigenous soil microbial communities;
# Alteration of the physicochemical and microbiological properties of the soil and contribution to the accumulation of chemical/biological contaminants (e.g. heavy metals, chemicals (i.e. boron, nitrogen, phosphorus, chloride, sodium, pesticides/herbicides), natural chemicals (i.e. hormones), contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) (i.e. pharmaceuticals and their metabolites, personal care products, household chemicals and food additives and their transformation products), etc.) in it and subsequent uptake by plants and crops; 
# Excessive growth of algae and vegetation in canals carrying wastewater (i.e. eutrophication); 
# Groundwater quality degradation by the various reclaimed water contaminants, migrating and accumulating in the soil and aquifers.

== Guidelines and regulations ==
=== International organizations ===

* World Health Organization (WHO): &quot;Guidelines for the safe use of wastewater, excreta and greywater&quot; (2006). 
* United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP): &quot;Guidelines for municipal wastewater reuse in the Mediterranean region&quot; (2005).
* United Nations Water Decade Programme on Capacity Development (UNW-DPC): Proceedings on the UNWater project &quot;Safe use of wastewater in agriculture&quot; (2013).

=== European Union ===

Since 26 June 2023 there is an EU regulation on minimum requirements for water reuse for irrigation purposes. The water quality requirements are divided into four categories depending on what is irrigated and how the irrigation is performed. The water quality parameters included are &quot;E.coli&quot;, BOD5, total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity, legionella, and intestinal nematodes (helminth eggs).

In the Water Framework Directive, reuse of water is mentioned as one of the possible measures to achieve the Directive&#x27;s quality goals. However, this remains a relatively vague recommendation rather than a requirement: Part B of Annex VI refers to reuse as one of the &quot;supplementary measures which Member States within each river basin district may choose to adopt as part of the programme of measures required under Article 11(4)&quot;.

Besides that, Article 12 of the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive concerning the reuse of treated wastewater states that &quot;treated wastewater shall be reused whenever appropriate&quot;, which some consider not specific enough to promote water reuse as it may leave too much room for interpretation as to what can be considered as an &quot;appropriate&quot; situation to reuse treated wastewater.

Despite the lack of common water reuse criteria at the EU level, several member states have issued their own legislative frameworks, regulations, or guidelines for different water reuse applications (e.g. Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, and Spain).

However, an evaluation carried out by the European Commission on the water reuse standards of several member states concluded that they differed in their approach. There are important differences among the standards regarding permitted uses, parameters to be monitored, and limit values allowed. This lack of harmonization among water reuse standards could potentially create trade barriers for agricultural goods irrigated with reclaimed water. Once on the common market, the level of safety in the producing member states may be not considered sufficient by the importing countries. The most representative standards on wastewater reuse from European member states are the following: 
* Cyprus: Law 106 (I) 2002 Water and Soil pollution control and associated regulations (KDP 772/2003, KDP 269/2005) (Issuing Institutions: Ministry of Agriculture, Natural resources and Environment, Water Development Department).
* France: Jorf num.0153, 4 July 2014. Order of 2014, related to the use of water from treated urban wastewater for irrigation of crops and green areas (Issuing Institutions: Ministry of Public Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, Ministry of Ecology, Energy and Sustainability). 
* Greece: CMD No 145116. Measures, limits and procedures for reuse of treated wastewater (Issuing Institutions: Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change). 
* Italy: DM 185/2003. Technical measures for reuse of wastewater (Issuing Institutions: Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Public Health).
* Portugal: NP 4434 2005. Reuse of reclaimed urban water for irrigation (Issuing Institutions: Portuguese Institute for Quality). 
* Spain: RD 1620/2007. The legal framework for the reuse of treated wastewater (Issuing Institutions: Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, Ministry of Health).
By 2023, a new EU agriculture law may raise water reuse by six times, from 1.7 billion m3 to 6.6 billion m3, and cut water stress by 5%.

=== United States ===
In the U.S., the Clean Water Act of 1972 mandated elimination of the discharge of untreated waste from municipal and industrial sources to make water safe for fishing and recreation. The US federal government provided billions of dollars in grants for building sewage treatment plants around the country. Modern treatment plants, usually using oxidation and/or chlorination in addition to primary and secondary treatment, were required to meet certain standards.

Los Angeles County&#x27;s sanitation districts started providing treated wastewater for landscape irrigation in parks and golf courses in 1929. The first reclaimed water facility in California was built at San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Park in 1932. The Water Replenishment District of Southern California was the first groundwater agency to obtain permitted use of recycled water for groundwater recharge in 1962.

Denver&#x27;s Direct Potable Water Reuse Demonstration Project examined the technical, scientific, and public acceptance aspects of DPR from 1979 to 1993. A chronic lifetime whole-animal health effects study on the 1 MGD advanced treatment plant product was conducted in conjunction with a comprehensive assessment of the chemical and microbiological water quality. The $30 million study found that the water produced met all health standards and compared favorably with Denver&#x27;s high quality drinking water. Further, the projected cost was lower than estimates for obtaining distant new water supplies.

Reclaimed water is not regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), but the EPA has developed water reuse guidelines that were most recently updated in 2012. The EPA Guidelines for Water Reuse represents the international standard for best practices in water reuse. The document was developed under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement between the EPA, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the global consultancy CDM Smith. The Guidelines provide a framework for states to develop regulations that incorporate the best practices and address local requirements.

====Trade associations====
* The WateReuse Association is a trade association in the United States which promotes reuse of water. According to their website, &quot;The WateReuse Association is the nation&#x27;s only trade association solely dedicated to advancing laws, policy, funding, and public acceptance of recycled water. WateReuse represents a coalition of utilities that recycle water, businesses that support the development of recycled water projects, and consumers of recycled water.&quot; The WateReuse Research Foundation was merged into the WateReuse Association on July 11, 2016.

== History ==
Wastewater reuse (planned or unplanned) is a practice which has been applied throughout human history and is closely connected to the development of sanitation.

== Country examples ==

=== Australia ===
=== Israel ===
=== Namibia ===
=== Singapore ===
Water reclaimation was pursued primarily due to geopolitical tensions arising from Singapore’s dependency on water imported from Malaysia.

=== South Africa ===

<text>USS &quot;Williams&quot; (DD-108) was a in the United States Navy entering service in 1919, and was the second ship to bear the name. Following a brief stint in active service, the ship was laid up for 17 years before being reactivated during World War II. &quot;Williams&quot; transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II as part of Lend-Lease and was renamed HMCS &quot;St. Clair&quot; (I65), surviving the war and being scrapped in 1946.

== Construction and career ==

=== United States Navy ===

Named in honor of John Foster Williams, the destroyer was laid down on 25 March 1918 at San Francisco, California, by the Union Iron Works plant of the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation. &quot;Williams&quot; was launched on 4 July 1918, sponsored by Mrs. H. G. Leopold, the wife of Commander H. G. Leopold. The destroyer commissioned on 1 March 1919 at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California.

Following shakedown trials, &quot;Williams&quot; and the destroyer departed Newport, Rhode Island, on 5 June 1919, bound for the Azores. Arriving at Ponta Delgada on 11 June, &quot;Williams&quot; proceeded to Gibraltar, where she picked up information pertaining to minefields still in operation in the Adriatic Sea, for delivery to the Commander, Naval Forces, Eastern Mediterranean. The destroyer visited Split, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes; Gallipoli, in the Dardanelles; and Trieste, Italy, where she operated as part of the US naval forces monitoring the local situation there.

After returning to the United States arriving at New York City on 1 August 1919, &quot;Williams&quot; was assigned to the Pacific Fleet. Given the hull number DD-108 on 17 July 1920, the destroyer operated out of San Diego, California until decommissioned there on 7 June 1922 and placed in reserve.

The German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 began hostilities in Europe, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt immediately declared the United States&#x27; neutrality. To augment the fleet units already engaged in the Neutrality Patrol hurriedly placed off the eastern seaboard and gulf coast of the United States, the navy recommissioned 77 destroyers and light minelayers.

&quot;Williams&quot; was among those recommissioned at San Diego on 6 November 1939. Following a refit at Mare Island, the destroyer operated in the San Diego area until sailing for Panama on 5 February. Transiting the Panama Canal on 16 February, she lay at Balboa, Panama, for a brief time. During her stay there, the destroyer &quot;manned the rail&quot; in honor of President Roosevelt, who was then engaged in an informal inspection of the Canal Zone&#x27;s defenses. Underway soon thereafter, &quot;Williams&quot; arrived at the Naval Operating Base (NOB), Key West, Florida, on 27 February.

In the following months, &quot;Williams&quot; operated with the Atlantic Squadron of the fleet, conducting neutrality patrols as well as training cruises consisting of short-range battle practices and ship-handling drills in March, she conducted an astronomical survey in the Bahamas. On 9 April, &quot;Williams&quot; transported a survey party to Palmetto Island in the British West Indies before shifting to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. After moving back to Key West for a time, &quot;Williams&quot; departed Florida&#x27;s waters on 2 June and arrived at New York on 4 June. She conducted two training cruises for embarked Naval Reserve contingents, which kept her busy into mid-1940. After a final refit at the Boston Navy Yard, she departed Charlestown, Massachusetts, on 18 September, bound for Canadian waters; and reached Halifax, Nova Scotia, two days later.

As one of the 50 destroyers transferred to the British under lend-lease in return for leases on important base sites in the Western Hemisphere— &quot;Williams&quot; was selected as one of the six units slated for the Royal Canadian Navy. Soon after her arrival at Halifax on 20 September 1940, she got underway for a brief familiarization cruise for the Canadian crewmen. &quot;Williams&quot; was decommissioned and turned over to the Canadian government on 24 September; her name was subsequently struck from the Navy list on 8 January 1941.

=== Royal Canadian Navy ===

Renamed HMCS &quot;St. Clair&quot; with the pennant number I65—following the Canadian practice of naming destroyers after Canadian rivers (but with deference to the U.S. origin), her name commemorates the St. Clair River which forms the boundary between Michigan and Ontario—the destroyer was fitted out for convoy escort duties and sailed for the British Isles on 30 November, in company with (ex-) and (ex-).

Operating with the Clyde Escort force, &quot;St. Clair&quot; escorted convoys in and out of the heavily travelled Western Approaches to the British Isles in the spring of 1941. Late in May, when the powerful German battleship and the heavy cruiser slipped through the Denmark Straits, the &quot;flush decker&quot; became involved in the intensive and widespread effort to destroy the German dreadnought. Eventually, a British force located and sank &quot;Bismarck&quot; on 27 May, but not before the tragic loss of the battlecruiser on 24 May. The search for the elusive German force brought some of the British units dangerously close to exhaustion of their fuel supplies. Two s, and , were located by German long-range bombers soon after &quot;Bismarck&quot; had slipped beneath the waves and were sunk. &quot;St. Clair&quot;, near the battle area, became involved in the action when she, too, came under attack. The old destroyer doggedly put up a good defense—shooting down one, and possibly, a second, enemy plane.

&quot;St. Clair&quot; subsequently joined the Newfoundland Escort Force after this group&#x27;s establishment in June 1941 and operated on convoy escort missions between Newfoundland and Reykjavík, Iceland, through the end of 1941. &quot;St. Clair&quot; was assigned to the Western Local Escort Force following repairs at Saint John, New Brunswick, in early 1942, and operated out of Halifax over the next two years, escorting coastwise convoys until withdrawn from this service in 1943 due to her deteriorating condition.

Operating as a submarine depot ship at Halifax until deemed unfit for further duty &quot;in any capacity&quot; in August 1944, &quot;St. Clair&quot; was used as a fire-fighting and damage control hulk until 1946. Handed over to the War Assets Corporation for disposal, on 6 October 1946, &quot;St. Clair&quot; was subsequently broken up for scrap.

<text>Prostitution in the Netherlands is legal and regulated. Operating a brothel is also legal. &quot;De Wallen&quot;, the largest and best-known Red-light district in Amsterdam, is a destination for international sex tourism.

== History ==

===Toleration during the Middle Ages===
During the Middle Ages, prostitution was tolerated. The attitude of worldly and religious authorities towards prostitution was pragmatic. Many cities tolerated prostitution to protect non-prostitute female citizens from rape and defilement. There were, however, a number of conditions imposed on prostitutes and their clients. Prostitutes were not allowed to be married.

Still, prostitution was considered a dishonorable profession. Prostitutes were not expected to conform to sexual rules, and were not protected by the law. The concept of &quot;honor&quot; was very important in early modern Dutch society. Honor had social significance, but it also had legal ramifications. &quot;Honorable&quot; people had more rights. Until the late sixteenth century honor, aside from citizenship, was the most important criterion for the stratification of society.

Despite the fact that prostitution was seen as indispensable, city governments tried to separate &quot;dishonorable&quot; prostitution from the honorable world. Until the fifteenth century, Dutch cities tried to keep prostitution outside of the city walls. Later, city governments tried to reserve certain areas of the city for prostitution. Prostitution businesses were driven to the streets and alleys near the city walls.

Typical is the following decree from the city of Amsterdam in 1413:
:&quot;Because whores are necessary in big cities and especially in cities of commerce such as ours – indeed it is far better to have these women than not to have them – and also because the holy church tolerates whores on good grounds, for these reasons the court and sheriff of Amsterdam shall not entirely forbid the keeping of brothels.&quot;

===Regulation and suppression starting in the 16th century===
During the sixteenth century, attitudes about sexuality changed under the influence of the Spanish occupation and rising Protestantism. Sexual activities were only tolerated within marriage. Church and state were not separated, and what was defined by the church as a sin was defined as a crime by the government. Prostitution and procurement were viewed as a sin and therefore prohibited. However, during this century the city of Amsterdam started to regulate prostitution. Only the police and the bailiff and his servants could keep a brothel in the Pijl and Halsteeg (currently the Damstraat). Prostitutes who practiced their trade in other parts of the city were arrested and their clients fined. Prostitution was a lucrative trade for the bailiff&#x27;s servants as well as for the city treasury. In 1578, the city of Amsterdam left the Spanish side during the Netherlands uprising and converted from Catholicism to Calvinism. The city then stopped regulating prostitution.

===17th century: &quot;laissez-faire&quot;===
Calvinistic morals were mirrored in the government policies of the seventeenth century. Titillating activities like dancing, fairs, and prostitution were sometimes outlawed. This morality did not, however, always correspond with the views and customs of the people. During the Golden seventeenth century sexuality was openly displayed in paintings and in literature. The image of the prostitute in literature was very negative. Prostitutes were portrayed as unreliable, impudent, lazy, and often ugly and dirty. In paintings, the image of the prostitute was more positive. Brothel-scenes were an important subject and prostitutes were painted as beautiful young women. The clients, however, were portrayed as fools who allowed themselves to be deceived. In both literature and paintings the madams were portrayed as evil profiteers. The authorities could not uphold the laws against prostitution and tended to leave brothels alone if they did not cause trouble.

===18th century: middle class adopts stringent morals===
During the eighteenth century, the morals preached by the church and government became more in line with certain developments within Dutch society. There was a growing middle class which tried to distinguish itself by a strong work ethic and self-control. By restrained sexual behavior, the middle class could separate itself from the &#x27;loose&#x27; lower class as well as the indecent nobility. Rich and poor also began to separate geographically. Prior to this period different social classes lived side by side, but they now lived in separate neighborhoods. The image of women also changed. Bourgeois women were seen by men of their class as faithful and chaste, but working-class women were viewed by middle-class men as potential prostitutes.

The working conditions of prostitutes were very poor. There was no proper birth control, condoms were not widely available and there were no effective cures against venereal diseases. Prostitutes often became pregnant and, because of venereal diseases, they eventually became infertile. This situation would not improve before the twentieth century.

===Napoleonic mandatory registration and medical examination===
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the armies of Napoleon started to regulate prostitution in the Netherlands (in 1810) to protect soldiers against venereal diseases. Prostitutes were forced to register and were subjected to mandatory medical examinations. Registered prostitutes were handed a red card which was a sort of work permit. If they were found to be infected, their red card was taken and they were given a white card instead while they were prohibited from working and were only allowed to work when declared fit. After the French occupation the Dutch government stopped regulating prostitution, but during several decades slowly began to regulate prostitutes again in the same style as under the French occupation. Many scientists during the nineteenth century believed that sexual abstinence for men was unhealthy. In their eyes, it was unavoidable that a number of women had to sacrifice themselves to protect the rest of the women from the destruction of an even more revolting kind. The women who had to sacrifice themselves were supposed to be lower class. Prostitutes themselves, however, were still despised and portrayed as disgusting creatures. Lower-class people themselves detested prostitutes.

===Abolitionists outlaw the owning of brothels===
During the 19th century, sexual morals became stricter, and a counter movement arose against regulated prostitution. In the beginning, this movement consisted of wealthy orthodox-Protestant Christians, but it later got support from other movements like Catholics, socialists, feminists and progressive liberals. They attacked the idea that men could not abstain from sex. Clients were viewed as low, dirty lechers, and the clients were not the young unmarried men prostitution was meant for, but were often well-off middle-aged married men. They also attacked the mandatory medical examinations, which were deemed degrading and ineffective to stop the spread of venereal diseases. Many prostitutes lived in the brothels and were bound to the madams by debts to pay off expensive working clothes. Prostitutes were often sold among madams, were subjected to fines, and could only leave the brothel under supervision. Medical expenses were added to their debt. Brothel keepers throughout Europe sold women among each other. The abolitionist movement in the Netherlands was largely connected to the international abolitionist movement. The movement slowly gained more influence, and during the last decades of the nineteenth-century city governments slowly started to abolish regulated prostitution. At first, the abolitionist movement mainly targeted mandatory health checks for prostitutes, but when the movement became more successful the focus shifted towards the people who profited from prostitution. In 1911 living on the avails of prostitution and owning a brothel were prohibited by law. Prostitution itself was not prohibited.

=== 20th century: toleration and eventual legalization ===

Until the 1970s, prostitutes in the Netherlands were predominantly white lower-class women from the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and Northern Germany. During the 1970s, in the wake of the sex trips to South-East Asia by Dutchmen, the sex operators brought in women from Thailand and the Philippines. In the 1980s there was a second wave from Latin America and Africa. In the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, women came from post Soviet countries. Foreign prostitutes are economically motivated to come to the Netherlands, and they tend to travel to engage in sex work between the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, and other European societies.

During the second half of the twentieth century, prostitution and brothels were condoned and tolerated by many local governments. The police interfered only when public order was at stake or in cases of human trafficking. The reasoning behind this &quot;gedoogbeleid&quot; (policy of tolerance) was harm reduction, and the belief that the enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws would be counterproductive, and that the best way to protect the women was to tolerate prostitution. This genuine Dutch policy of tolerating formally illegal activities for harm reduction purposes has been and still is also applied towards illegal drugs in the Netherlands. (See drug policy of the Netherlands.)

The Red Thread (&quot;de Rode Draad&quot;) is a support and advocacy association for prostitutes that was founded in 1985 and works for the legitimization and against the stigmatization of prostitutes.

Prostitution was defined as a legal profession in January 1988.

Brothel prohibition made it difficult to set rules for the sex industry. During the eighties many municipalities urged the national government to lift the ban on brothels. In 1983 minister Korthals Altes had presented an amendment to the law on prostitution. It took until 1 October 2000 for brothels to leave the half-legal status of being tolerated and to become fully legal and licensed businesses. Prostitutes may work as regular employees, though the vast majority work as independent contractors. The Dutch union FNV has accepted prostitutes as members since that time.

In the 1990s, Dutch attitudes supported the legalization of prostitution: in a 1997 survey, 73 percent of Dutch citizens favored legalization of brothels, 74 percent said that prostitution was an &quot;acceptable job&quot;, and in a 1999 poll 78 percent felt that prostitution is a job like any other job.

===21st century: reducing the size of the Red-light district===

When the Dutch government legalized prostitution in 2000, it was to protect the women by giving them work permits, but authorities now fear that this business is out of control: &quot;We&#x27;ve realized this is no longer about small-scale entrepreneurs, but those big crime organizations are involved here in trafficking women, drugs, killings, and other criminal activities&quot;, said Job Cohen, the former mayor of Amsterdam.

More recently, officials have noticed an increase in violence centered on this irregular industry, and have blamed this increase on the illegal immigration of individuals into Amsterdam to participate in the sex industry: &quot;The guys from Eastern Europe bring in young and frightened women; they threaten them and beat them&quot;, said a resident of De Wallen. Prostitution has remained connected to criminal activities, which has led the authorities to take several measures, including detailed plans to help the prostitutes quit the sex trade and find other professions.

In 2005 Amma Asante and Karina Schaapman, two councilors for the Labour Party (Netherlands), wrote a report, &quot;Het onzichtbare zichtbaar gemaakt&quot; (Making the Invisible Visible). Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing.
In response to the problems associated with the involvement of organized crime into the sex trade, the Dutch government has decided to close numerous prostitution businesses. Concerned about organized crime, money laundering, and human trafficking, Amsterdam officials under Mayor Cohen denied the license renewals of about 30 brothels in the Amsterdam Red-light district De Wallen in 2006; the brothel owners appealed. To counter negative news reports, the district organized an open house day in 2007 and a statue to an unknown sex worker was unveiled, &quot;intended to honor those employed in the industry world-wide.&quot; In September 2007 it was announced that the city of Amsterdam was buying several buildings in the Red-light district from Charles Geerts in order to close about a third of the windows.

At the end of 2008, Mayor Cohen announced plans to close half of the city&#x27;s 400 prostitution windows because of suspected criminal gang activity. The mayor is also closing some of the city&#x27;s 70 marijuana cafes and sex clubs. This comes at the same time as the Government&#x27;s decision to ban the sale of &quot;magic mushrooms&quot; and the closure of all coffee shops situated near schools. Nevertheless, Mayor Cohen has noted, &quot;It is not that we want to get rid of our Red-light district. We want to reduce it. Things have become unbalanced and if we do not act we will never regain control.&quot;

In 2009 the Dutch justice ministry announced the appointment of a special public prosecutor charged with closing down prostitution windows and coffee shops connected to organized crime syndicates.

A law proposal was introduced in the House of Representatives of the Netherlands in 2009 and amended in 2010 which would ban prostitution by people younger than 21. Prostitutes are required to register; they receive a registration pass with a photograph and a registration number, but no name or other personal data. Clients are required to check this pass. In addition to municipal rules a national rule is introduced requiring sex companies to have a license, including prostitution companies such as brothels and escort agencies, but also, for example, adult movie theaters. Under the proposed amendments, an advertisement of an individual prostitute should contain his or her registration number, an advertisement of a sex company should contain its license number. The premises for public access of a sex company (if any) should have on the outside a sign showing that the company is licensed, while inside a copy of the license has to be displayed.
A vote on the law has been deferred to allow both sides to examine the matter more closely.

The 70-year-old twin sisters Louise and Martine Fokkens, who have worked for decades as prostitutes in the Red-light districts of Amsterdam, were the subject of a 2011 film and a 2012 book. In a 2012 interview, they complained that the legalisation of 2000 had led to more criminality and to the taxation of the trade.

==== 2020–2021 temporary ban during COVID-19 pandemic ====
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, all legally operating brothels in the Netherlands were closed on 15 March 2020, based on emergency orders from their police district. The closing orders caught some customers in the middle of their acts. Since the Dutch government failed to provide financial compensation for sex workers (especially those who paid taxes through the &quot;opting-in&quot;-system, designed because sex workers cannot be employees obeying a boss), many of them were forced to continue to work, turning to illegal home-based prostitution.

As the Netherlands went into a semi lock-down, questions were raised in Dutch parliament about sex workers who had to continue to work to pay their bills, or even buy food. Christian politicians said they wanted to help women to escape from exploitation, but sex workers&#x27; unions responded that they don&#x27;t want to be &quot;saved&quot; by people who would like to forbid prostitution again. Sex workers and their support groups complained several times, during radio and TV interviews, that politicians were talking about them, rather than talking with them. Leaving sex workers out of the debate on sex work leads to wrong decisions, based on the loudest voices, from people who might feel that prostitution should be made illegal, instead of listening to experienced sex workers and give sex workers the power to make their own choices.

Sex workers from licensed brothels who had paid taxes for many years felt betrayed by the Dutch government as many millions of Euros in support money were distributed to companies and independent workers to keep the economy afloat, but sex workers did not fulfil the rules for compensation, unless they had officially registered as an independent worker. Many sex workers in the Netherlands complained that they could no longer afford food or rent. Brothel owners feared that many sex workers would turn their backs on legally operating brothels for good and would continue to work illegally in residential areas, where they could remain anonymous.

According to a road map for relaxing of anti-Corona-measures presented by the Dutch government, the reopening of brothels in the Netherlands was supposed to take place in September 2020. In a later press conference, on 24 June 2020, it was announced that prostitution would be made legal again in the Netherlands starting 1 July 2020. After Belgium lifted the ban on prostitution from 8 June 2020 and the Belgian border reopened on 15 June 2020, both sex workers and customers started travelling to neighbouring Belgium. On 18 May 2021, sex workers were allowed to resume their jobs.

==== 2021–present ====
From 1 January 2022, a customer will be punished if they purchase a sexual service from a sex worker of whom they know or have serious reason to suspect that there is coercion, exploitation or human trafficking.

==Demographics==
===Extent===
As with other countries, estimates regarding the total number of prostitutes vary. Most sources place this number between 15,000 and 30,000.

An article published in 1997 in the International Encyclopedia of Sexuality claimed that the total number of prostitutes in the Netherlands was about 15,000 to 20,000.
 CATW has stated that there were 30,000 prostitutes in the Netherlands, citing &quot;&quot;Sex tax Ticks off Dutch,&quot; Associated Press, 14 October 1997&quot;. According to Radio Netherlands, in 1999, there were estimated to be 25,000 prostitutes in the Netherlands, with 12,500 working at any one time at a total of 6,000 locations.

In 2012, most prostitution consisted of females selling sex to males. About 5% of prostitutes were estimated to be males and 5% were transgender females.

In 2016, UNAIDS estimated the number of sex workers in the Netherlands to be 25,000.

=== Migrant sex workers ===
In the 1970s, the majority of migrant sex workers in the Netherlands were from Thailand, in the 1980s from Latin America and the Caribbean. No more than one third were Dutch nationals, the remainder representing 44 nationalities. The majority were from the Dominican Republic and Colombia.

An article written by Marie-Victoire Louis in &quot;Le Monde diplomatique&quot; in 1997, claimed that 80% of sex workers in Amsterdam were foreigners and 70% had no immigration papers (but did not quote the source). A Dutch report released in June 1999 estimated that two-thirds of sex workers were migrants.

In 2008, Karina Schaapman, a former sex worker and former member of the Amsterdam city council, produced a report about the Amsterdam sex trade. She offered the police a Facebook with 80 &quot;violent pimps&quot;, of whom only three were Dutch-born. She said that more than 75% of Amsterdam&#x27;s 8,000 to 11,000 sex workers were from the former Soviet Union, Africa and Asia.

A 2009 study released by TAMPEP in 2009 put the number of migrant sex workers in 2008 at 60% (a decrease from 70% in 2006), originating from Central Europe (EU) 40%, Latin America 20%, Western Europe 12%, Eastern Europe (non-EU) 8%, Africa 8%, the Balkans 4%, Asia 4%, and the Baltic states 3%.

=== Customers ===
In a 1989 study, 13.5% of men in the Netherlands reported having paid for sex at least once in their life, and 2.6% had done so during the past year.

== In practice ==

According to the International Encyclopedia of Sexuality, during the 1990s, some 10% of prostitutes worked on the streets, 30% in window prostitution, 30% in sex clubs, 15% in an escort service, and 15% in their private residence. Drug addicts, including drug tourists, were said to be numerous in the street prostitution group.

Some Dutch cities provide facilities called &quot;afwerkplek&quot;, a sex drive-in enclosure for cars for street prostitution.

According to Radio Netherlands in 2012, prostitution was concentrated in and around the big cities and in the border towns in the regions of Limburg, Groningen, Twente, West Brabant and Zeeland. Prostitution occurred in various forms: window and street prostitution, clubs, escort agencies, and home-based prostitution. Window prostitution occurred in 12 cities in the Netherlands. It was estimated that on average some 2,000 sex workers were engaged daily in this form of prostitution. Street prostitution existed in 10 Dutch cities and involved on average some 320 sex workers daily. Between 3,500 and 4,000 sex workers were employed daily in 600–700 clubs and private brothels. The extent of other forms of prostitution such as escort agencies and home-based prostitution was much more difficult to estimate. Home-based prostitution occurred in at least 17 municipalities, and escort agencies existed in at least 28 municipalities.

In 2008, city statistic showed 142 licensed brothels in Amsterdam, with about 500 window displays, and officials estimated that sexual transactions in Amsterdam account for about 100 million US dollars per year.

In 2011 Dutch authorities started asking sex workers to pay taxes on their earnings.

== Sex worker organisations ==
=== National organisations ===

Sex workers in the Netherlands have set up various organisations in order to guard their interests, including human rights, labour rights, healthcare and social inclusion. The first historical example of a Dutch labour union for sex workers was The Red Thread (De Rode Draad) (1985–2012). is a national sex trade union for (former) sex workers based in Amsterdam, founded in 2015 as a successor of The Red Thread. Red Light United was founded in 2019 as a trade union of (mostly migrant) window workers on De Wallen in Amsterdam. The Prostitution Information Center (PIC) in Amsterdam has been providing information to sex workers, customers, tourists, the government and the general public since 1994. In addition, the / Soa AIDS Nederland is an Amsterdam-based organisation which runs a Sex Work Projects Programme to prevent HIV/AIDS and STIs amongst sex workers.

=== International organisations ===

Amsterdam is also home to several international sex worker organisations, labour unions, networks, support groups and programmes. The International Committee for Prostitutes&#x27; Rights (ICRP) was founded in Amsterdam in 1985, where the first of a series of World Whores Congresses was hosted the same year, at which the World Charter for Prostitutes&#x27; Rights was adopted. It was relaunched as the International Committee for the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe (ICRSE) in Amsterdam in 2005, and drew up another charter of rights for sex workers, with a focus on European countries. TAMPEP, founded in 1993, based in Amsterdam and hosted from Helsinki, calls itself the &quot;European Network for HIV/STI Prevention and Health Promotion among Migrant Sex Workers&quot;. The Red Umbrella Fund (RUF) was founded in 2012 as an Amsterdam-based fund making grants to sex workers&#x27; rights groups worldwide. In addition, the La Strada International Association (LSI) is an Amsterdam-based anti-trafficking organisation which has the decriminalisation of sex work as a &quot;strategic focus area&quot;.

== Sex trafficking ==
NGOs and police estimated that the number of women and girls trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation ranged from 1,000 to 3,600. The Foundation Against Trafficking in Women (STV), an independent NGO that helped victims of trafficking, registered 579 victims in 2006, up from 424 in 2005. The top five countries of origin were the Netherlands (157 victims), Nigeria (91), Bulgaria (42), Romania (35), and China (30).

Countries that are major sources of trafficked persons include Thailand, India, the Netherlands, Mexico, China, Nigeria, Albania, Bulgaria, Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine, Sierra Leone, and Romania.

According to figures obtained from the National Centre against Human Trafficking, there were 1,711 registered presumed victims of human trafficking in 2012, of whom 1,177 were women forced to work in the sex industry. However, an increase in identified presumed victims does not necessarily mean an increase in trafficking but can be caused by, for instance, better awareness and cooperation among the different agencies which come into contact with potential victims.

Within the Netherlands, victims are often recruited by so-called &quot;loverboys&quot; – men who seduce young Dutch women and girls and later coerce them into prostitution. The phenomenon was highlighted in 2008 by Maria Mosterd, who published a book about her ordeal as the 12-year-old victim of a loverboy. The truthfulness of this book is disputed, and was the subject of an investigative journalism report.

Many victims of human trafficking are led to believe by organized criminals that they are being offered work in hotels or restaurants or in child care and are forced into prostitution with the threat or actual use of violence. Estimates of the number of victims vary from 1,000 to 7,000 on a yearly basis. Most police investigations on human trafficking concern legal sex businesses. All sectors of prostitution are well represented in these investigations, but window brothels in particular are overrepresented. 

At the end of 2008, a gang of six people was sentenced to prison terms of eight months to 7½ years in what prosecutors said was the worst case of human trafficking ever brought to trial in the Netherlands. The case involved more than 100 female victims, violently forced to work in prostitution. In December 2009, two Nigerian men were sentenced to 4 and 4½ years in prison for having smuggled 140 Nigerian women aged 16–23 into the Netherlands. The women were made to apply for asylum and then removed from asylum centers to work as prostitutes in surrounding countries. The men were said to have used &quot;voodoo&quot; curses on the women to prevent escape and enforce payment of debts.

The US State Department&#x27;s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks the Netherlands as a &#x27;Tier 1&#x27; country, indicating full compliance with the minimum standards of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA).

<doc id="1018371" wikidata="Q1129690" url="?curid=1018371" title="Coole Park">
<text>Coole Park is a nature reserve of approximately located a few miles west of Gort, County Galway, Ireland.
It is managed by the Irish National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service, part of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.
The park is in a low–lying karstic limestone area characterised by seasonal lakes, known as turloughs, which are almost unique to Ireland. It has extensive woodlands. There are 6 kilometres of signposted nature trails plus a formal late 18th century walled garden.

==History==

The park was formerly the estate of the Gregory family. Coole House was built in the late 18th century for Robert Gregory: a three-storey house with a square porch and as principal rooms a dining room and drawing-room with bay windows facing out to Coole Lough and the Burren Hills, and a library in between them.

In 1880, Robert&#x27;s great-grandson, William Henry Gregory married Isabella Augusta Persse, who became Lady Gregory. The death in World War I of their only child, Robert, a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps, inspired the poet W B Yeats to write works which included &quot;An Irish Airman Foresees His Death.&quot;

The walled garden contains an &quot;autograph tree&quot;, a copper beech that is engraved with initials of many of the leading figures of the Irish Literary Revival who were personal friends of Lady Gregory including Yeats, Edward Martyn, George Bernard Shaw, John Millington Synge, Mario Manlio Rossi and Seán O&#x27;Casey. Yeats&#x27; poem &quot;The Wild Swans at Coole&quot; was inspired by the beauty of the swans in the turlough at Coole Park. Yeats&#x27;s home at Thoor Ballylee was just 3 miles away; he also wrote &quot;Coole Park, 1929&quot;, a poem that describes the park as a symbol for the revival of Irish literature:

&quot;Here traveller, scholar, poet, take your stand, / 
When all these rooms and passages are gone /
When nettles wave upon a shapeless mound /
And saplings root among the broken stone.&quot;

Coole House was sold by Margaret Gregory, the widowed wife of Robert Gregory, to the Irish state in 1927, with life tenancy for her mother-in-law. Lady Gregory died in 1932 and the furnishings were soon auctioned off. According to the National Archives, the building fell into a ruin, a neglect deplored by Micheál Mac Liammóir in 1964, and was demolished by the state in 1941. Today, all that remains is the plinth on which it stood.

==Today==
The grounds are open to the public all year round (free admission). A visitor centre located in the former outbuildings (late 18th century) operates during high season (April to September inclusive). The centre offers tea rooms, an audio/visual presentation on Lady Gregory and the literary history of Coole Park, and also a multi-media exhibition called &quot;Coole Park through the eyes of &#x27;Me and Nu&#x27;, Granddaughters of Lady Gregory&quot;.

In 2014, fungal disease forced the felling of many trees in Coole Park for safety reasons, as confirmed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (Ireland).

==Ecology==
The ephemeral nature of turlough hydrology gives rise to a characteristic ecology. Turloughs have been designated as a Priority Habitat in the EU Habitats Directive.
Coole Park is part of the Coole-Garryland Complex, a candidate Special Area of Conservation (site code SAC 252).

Since 1990 Coole Lough &amp; Garryland Wood has been protected as a Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention.

===Protection for birds===
A wildfowl sanctuary, where the shooting of game birds is not permitted, is designated under the Wildlife Act 1976.
The park is included in a Special Protection Area for birds under the EU Birds Directive: this site of 520 ha (site code SPA 107) was designated in 1996 because of its importance for wintering waterfowl, notably whooper swan.
The SPA overlaps with a smaller Important Bird Area, Coole Park and Garryland complex.

<doc id="1018374" wikidata="Q2223302" url="?curid=1018374" title="Santa Ynez Mountains">
<text>The Santa Ynez Mountains are a portion of the Transverse Ranges, part of the Pacific Coast Ranges of the west coast of North America. It is the westernmost range in the Transverse Ranges.

The range is a large fault block of Cenozoic age created by the movements of the Santa Ynez Fault. A very narrow range, the Santa Ynez Mountains rise quickly on its north side and drops off equally dramatically along the range&#x27;s south face along the Gaviota Coast. The Santa Ynez Mountains begin as a series of volcanic hills near Point Arguello, and gradually transitions eastward into a single, well-defined ridge extending from Gaviota Peak to Matilija Creek. The range is approximately contiguous with the Topatopa Mountains beyond to the east, which terminates abruptly at Sespe Creek.

The climate of the range is Mediterranean with most of the precipitation falling between November and March. Most of the range lies in the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion. At the crest and on the north slope, the rainier regions support extensive oak woodlands, mixed with other broadleafed species such as madrone, sycamore and bay laurel, along with some conifers, primarily Coulter pines.

==Geography==

The mountains are principally in Santa Barbara County, with an eastward extension into Ventura County, and are unusual in being an entirely east–west trending mountain range—one of the few in the United States. This is attributed in part to clockwise rotations of crustal blocks 90° or more since the early Miocene or about 17 million years ago. The range is mostly within Los Padres National Forest.

The southern slopes of the range drop off into a series of alluvial plains which make up the Gaviota Coast along the Santa Barbara Channel. They tend to be made up of unconsolidated riverine deposits overlying shale bedrock. The northern boundary of the range is marked by the Santa Ynez Fault, the massive thrust fault that uplifted the mountains since approximately 5 million years ago starting in the Pliocene. Notable features along the fault which mark the boundary of the range include Jalama Creek and the Santa Ynez River to the west and Matilija Creek in the far east. To the north of the range are the San Rafael Mountains.

Laterally, the mountains extend from an eastern terminus at the canyon of the Ventura River and Matilija Creek, north of Ojai, west across the Santa Barbara County line, to immediately north of the city of Santa Barbara, and then west, paralleling the coast, to the city of Lompoc and Vandenberg Space Force Base. The Santa Ynez River flows just north of the mountains, paralleling them for most of their length. Before reaching Lompoc the mountain range diverges into two low ridges, separated by Jalama Creek, which then vanish into the Pacific Ocean.

The mountains parallel the Channel Islands to the south, another east–west trending range, a geologic extension of the Santa Monica Mountains; the two ranges are about thirty miles apart. Principal summits in the Santa Ynez range include Divide Peak, , La Cumbre Peak, (above Santa Barbara), and Santa Ynez Peak, . There are several important passes, including Gaviota Pass in the western portion of the range, through which runs U.S. Highway 101 via the Gaviota Tunnel; and San Marcos Pass near Santa Barbara, through which runs California State Route 154 capped by the magnificent Cold Spring Canyon Arch Bridge near the summit.

The highest point, an unnamed and unmarked crest colloquially called &quot;Peak 4864&quot;, is located right above the eastern terminus of the range, near Lake Casitas and Matilija Canyon.

==Geology==
Geologically the mountains are young and mostly of sedimentary origin. The most common rock types in the range are sandstones and shales, with some limestone in the western portion of the range. Volcanic rocks can be found at the very western extremity of the range, near Point Arguello (Tranquillion Mountain Volcanics), while some schists of the Franciscan Assemblage are exposed in a number of locations.

The Santa Ynez Mountains were uplifted in Pliocene and Pleistocene time, beginning about five million years ago, along the Santa Ynez Fault, a feature which is considered to be active. The left bend in the San Andreas Fault is proposed to have constrained northward moving lithosphere to cause uplift of the range. Being a young uplift, the slopes are steep and the topography is extremely rugged; the gradient is highest on the northern side above , adjacent to the trace of the fault. Dramatic sandstone formations, including outcrops of the resistant Coldwater and Matilija formations, are visible at many locations in the range.

==Biology==
The predominant ground cover is chaparral, with coastal sage scrub, oak woodland and grasslands at lower elevations. Isolated stands of conifers (mostly Coulter pines) and other evergreen trees such as bay laurel, tanbark oak and madrone grow on the higher parts of the northern slopes, which are cooler and shadier than the southern slopes exposed to the sun. At lower elevations on the southern side of the range, a virtually frost-free zone, avocados are grown in considerable quantity.
The Santa Ynez Mountains are home to many species typical of the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion, such as the Western fence lizard, Nuttall&#x27;s woodpecker, Steller&#x27;s jay, striped skunk, raccoon, mule deer, bobcat, and coyote. Large predator species include mountain lion and black bear, the latter of which wanders in and out of the range within territories in excess of 15 square miles.

==Inhabitants==
Early inhabitants included the Chumash people who left behind many examples of rock art including those at Painted Cave SHP. Large portions of the mountain range are now in the Los Padres National Forest, although there are private inholdings, including some substantial communities, such as the Painted Cave community where Jane Fonda owned the ridgetop Laurel Springs Ranch into the late 1990s. Other famous residents have included Ronald Reagan, whose Rancho del Cielo is at the top of the range west of Santa Barbara, and Ben Adelson. The Cold Spring Tavern is a popular local gathering place beneath the Cold Spring Bridge.
==Climate==
The climate of the mountain range is Mediterranean. Summers are warm and almost entirely rainless, save for occasional monsoonal showers in August and September, though in most years there is no rain between May and October. Most of the higher coastal slopes of the range average between to almost of precipitation per year (mostly falling between November and March), about twice the total of the coastal plain below. About one year in three snow falls on the higher peaks in the mountains, but it rarely stays for longer than a few days. In the late spring and early summer the mountains and areas below to the south are subject to occasional intense sundowner winds, a type of foehn wind in which the air is heated adiabatically and dried as it moves downslope. In dry years these winds pose an extreme fire hazard.

Occasionally extremely destructive fires originate in the Santa Ynez Mountains. In June 1990, a fire which began near Painted Cave burned south into the city of Santa Barbara, driven by sundowner winds, destroying over 500 homes. A fire in the 1940s destroyed most of the mansion that is now called Knapp&#x27;s Castle. More recent fires, such as the Tea and Jesusita fires, have also been destructive to properties.

<text>USS &quot;Hart&quot; (DD-110) was a built for the United States Navy during World War I.

==Namesakes==
Ezekiel Bishop Hart was born c. 1795. He entered the Navy as a Midshipman on 30 April 1814. He was killed in the action of Commodore Isaac Chauncey&#x27;s squadron on Lake Ontario on 26 August 1814.

John E. Hart was appointed a Midshipman on 23 February 1841. He served on various ships of the fleet, and was appointed Lieutenant Commander in July 1862. Commanding , Hart served in the West Gulf Blockading Squadron during the American Civil War and engaged two Confederate steamers in the Red River near Fort DeRussy on 4 May 1863. He died of fever contracted on duty on the Mississippi River on 11 June 1863.

==Description==
The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was an improved and faster version of the preceding . Two different designs were prepared to the same specification that mainly differed in the turbines and boilers used. The ships built to the Bethlehem Steel design, built in the Fore River and Union Iron Works shipyards, mostly used Yarrow boilers that deteriorated badly during service and were mostly scrapped during the 1930s. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a crew of 6 officers and 108 enlisted men.

Performance differed radically between the ships of the class, often due to poor workmanship. The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was powered by two steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of intended to reach a speed of . The ships carried of fuel oil which was intended gave them a range of at .

The ships were armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts and were fitted with two 1-pounder guns for anti-aircraft defense. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A &quot;Y-gun&quot; depth charge thrower was added to many ships.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Hart&quot;, named in honor of Ezekiel Hart and John E. Hart, was launched 4 July 1918; by Union Iron Works of San Francisco, California, sponsored by Mrs. Daniel C. Nutting; and commissioned 26 May 1919. &quot;Hart&quot; joined the destroyer force and operated off the California coast until 17 July 1920, when she was reclassified as a light minelayer, DM-8, and proceeded to Mare Island Navy Yard for installation of minelaying equipment. Following her conversion, &quot;Hart&quot; was assigned to Mine Detachment, Asiatic Fleet, and sailed for the Philippine Islands in November 1920. She subsequently operated in waters off the Philippine Islands and China in peacetime operations.

Ordered to San Diego, California, for deactivation, &quot;Hart&quot; sailed from Manila, 12 December 1930 and arrived at San Diego 24 January 1931. She decommissioned 1 June 1931, and her name was struck from the Navy List 11 November. &quot;Hart&quot; was sold for scrap 25 February 1932 in accordance with the London Treaty for the limitation of naval armaments.

<doc id="1018380" wikidata="Q7970462" url="?curid=1018380" title="Warren Ryan">
<text>Warren Redman Ryan (born 27 October 1941) is an Australian former professional rugby league football coach and player. He is considered one of the most influential rugby league coaches of the 20th century. Ryan also played in the NSWRFL Premiership for the St George Dragons and Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks.

He was formerly employed as a color commentator by ABC Radio 702 for its Rugby League coverage . Ryan also formerly contributed opinion articles to the Brisbane &quot;Courier-Mail&quot; and &quot;Newcastle Herald&quot;.

==Athletics==
Ryan was also an elite track and field athlete, representing Australia in the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in the shot put coming seventh in a field of sixteen with a throw of 51&#x27;8&quot; (15.75m).
Ryan accredits his famous attention to detail in his coaching to his Czech-born track coach of this time.

==Rugby league playing career==
Warren Ryan was a St. George Dragons lower grade player. He played in the Dragons 1965 reserve grade grand final, and appeared in first grade on a number of occasions as a replacement during 1966.

In 1967, he switched to the Cronulla Sharks in their debut season and became a regular in first grade, and was club Captain at different times during 1967–68.

In 1969 he moved to Wollongong Wests and had four seasons there, the final two as captain-coach. He captained NSW Country in 1972.

==Coaching career==

Ryan coached Collegians in 1974, and then Wests Under 23s.

He took over as coach of Newtown in 1979 and took them to the 1981 Grand Final.

Ryan moved over to Canterbury, coaching them to premierships in 1984 and 1985. He resigned from the club in 1987.

Ryan moved to Balmain and took them to grand finals in 1988 and 1989.

Ryan went to Wests, and took them to fourth position in 1991, the year he won the &#x27;Dally M&#x27; Coach of the Year.

Ryan took over as Newcastle coach for two years in 1999.

==Broadcaster and journalist==
&quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; journalist Dean Ritchie once wrote, &quot;Abrasive and rude, Ryan hated the media. And I think those feelings were reciprocated.&quot; However Ryan had a long media career.

Warren Ryan wrote for the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; for many years as a sports journalist. He is also a former member of the ABC Grandstand rugby league commentary team; where, rather than calling the match play itself, he supplied special comments throughout the broadcast.

Ryan used the term &quot;old darky&quot; during the call of an NRL match between the Roosters and Bulldogs. He claimed he was quoting a scene from &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. After listeners&#x27; complaints, he was stood down from the ABC with his colleague David Morrow pending an investigation. The scene he claimed to refer to is the &#x27;quittin&#x27; time&#x27; scene in which a slave calls quittin&#x27; time, presuming the role of the foreman. Having asserted his rights, the foreman immediately calls &#x27;quittin&#x27; time!&#x27; The incident involving Ryan made headlines, while notable indigenous leaders called for an investigation. While the investigation continued, Warren Ryan resigned. He had intended to retire at the end of the 2014 season, but brought it forward rather than face the results. Refusing to address the use of a racist term, Ryan said, &quot;The word used to describe the character was a direct quote from the film. There was no offence intended, so I won&#x27;t be apologising. It would be insincere. Furthermore, there is no appeasing those who are determined to be offended. So that&#x27;s it. I&#x27;ve had a long run and, for the most part, it&#x27;s been very enjoyable.&quot;

He proposed his own finals system, an alternative to McIntyre Final Eight and AFL, but it was not accepted.

==Personal life==
In addition to his rugby league career, Ryan was also a long-time physical education teacher at Belmore Boys High School in Sydney&#x27;s southwest.

In April 2006, Ryan&#x27;s son Matthew died of heart failure at age 24 following an overdose of the party drug, &quot;gamma hydroxybutyrate&quot; (GHB).

<text>Yellow cab taxicab operators exist all around the world (some with common heritage, some without). The original Yellow Cab Company, based in Chicago, Illinois, was one of the largest taxicab companies in the United States.

== History ==
Yellow cabs date back to at least 1798, when the musical comedy, &quot;Cabriolet Jaune&quot; (&quot;Yellow Cab&quot;), debuted at Paris&#x27; Theatre de l&#x27;Opera Comique National. Yellow cabs were known in Paris and London throughout most of the 1800s. A yellow cab company shook up the New York Cab system in the mid-1880s, offering cheaper, more predictable fares than competitors. One of the first automobile cabs in London, in the 1890s, was a yellow electric automobile.

The Yellow Cab Company of Chicago was founded by John D. Hertz in 1907. Their specially designed taxicabs were powered by a 4-cylinder Continental engine equipped with a purpose-built taxicab body supplied by the Racine Body Co., of Racine, Wisconsin. According to Yellow Cab Co. tradition, the color (and name) yellow was selected by John Hertz as the result of a survey he commissioned at a &quot;local university&quot;, which indicated it was the easiest color to spot. However, &quot;he was certainly not the first taxicab operator to use that color and the university study to which B. C. Forbes refers has yet to be discovered.&quot; In 2017, a study showed that the color yellow, for taxis, was more noticeable, resulting in 9% fewer accidents.

In 1908, Albert Rockwell, founder and General Manager of the New Departure Manufacturing Co. of Bristol, Connecticut, travelled to Europe to evaluate their taxi systems, hoping to develop a similar one in Washington, D.C. Ernest Wyckoff, Alfred Church and Clarence Partridge, well-known automobile dealers in New York, had a number of orange-yellow colored Rockwell taxicabs operating on Manhattan streets in 1909. By March 1910, the Connecticut Cab Co. (essentially the directors of New Departure Manufacturing Co.) assumed operating control of Wyckoff, Church and Partridge&#x27;s taxis.

The Yellow Taxicab Co. was incorporated in New York on April 4, 1912. Its fares that year started at 50¢/mile (roughly equivalent to $12.12 in 2016 adjusted for inflation). Among its directors and major stockholders were Albert Rockwell and the Connecticut Cab Co. Shortly after incorporation the Yellow Taxicab Co. merged with the Cab and Taxi Co., and with the strength of Connecticut Cab Co. behind them, the young business assumed a large share of the New York market. Its independent corporate life was fairly short, however, as fare wars and regulations forced a merger with the Mason-Seaman Transportation Co. on March 3, 1914. Shortly after, an injunction was filed by the company, seeking to restrain the city from enforcing the Public Hack ordinances, but it was rejected on appeal. By 1916, the company was being held in receivership, due to suits by numerous creditors.

The Yellow Cab Manufacturing Company was formed in 1920.

<doc id="1018391" wikidata="Q6540851" url="?curid=1018391" title="Liberal parties in pre-confederation Newfoundland">
<text>Several political groupings functioned in the Dominion of Newfoundland under the name Liberal Party of Newfoundland from the granting of responsible government to the island in the 1850s until its suspension in 1934 when the Commission of Government was instituted. During that period, Newfoundland was an independent dominion within the British Empire, responsible for its own internal affairs.

The original Liberal Party was originally a coalition of Catholics and Methodists who opposed the Anglican-dominated political establishment. This party agitated for the granting of &#x27;responsible government&#x27; to the island. Shortly after responsible government was instituted in 1854, the Methodists left the party to join the Anglicans in the Conservative Party, leaving the Liberals as a predominantly Irish Catholic party. Political parties in the dominion were thus divided along sectarian lines for the next thirty years - a situation that resulted in periodic riots and other political violence. This division also reflected class differences: most Catholics were working class or farmers, and most members of the middle and business classes were Protestant.

In the 1880s, a denominational compromise was reached and political parties realigned with a new Liberal Party being formed by former Conservative Premier William Whiteway. Whiteway launched the new Liberal Party as a vehicle to promote the construction of a cross-island railway.

Under Robert Bond, the Liberals suffered a split when Edward Patrick Morris left to form the Newfoundland People&#x27;s Party. The NPP won the 1909 and 1913 elections. In 1919, Richard Squires merged his Liberal Party with the Fishermen&#x27;s Protective Union to form the Liberal Reform Party. The Liberal Reform Party won the 1919 election, but collapsed prior to the 1924 election due to a crisis over corruption. This crisis toppled both Squires and his successor, William Warren. In 1923, some members of the Liberal Reform Party joined with Albert Hickman and John Robert Bennett to form a new Liberal-Progressive Party.

Many former supporters of William Warren joined in alliance with former Conservative leader William J. Higgins to form the Liberal-Conservative Progressive Party. This party emerged as a conservative opposition to the Liberals and won the 1924 election. It later changed its name to the United Newfoundland Party.

By 1928, Squires had formed a new Liberal Party, which won the 1928 election. This second Squires government was again beset by corruption and scandal. The economic crisis caused by the Great Depression compounded these problems, and led to riots in 1932. Squires&#x27;s government was toppled by the conservative United Newfoundland Party.

The UNP was elected on a promise to consider suspending responsible government. Responsible government was suspended in 1934, and a Commission of Government appointed by the British government took over the administration of Newfoundland. Newfoundland&#x27;s status as an independent dominion came to an end, along with party politics.

Party politics returned to Newfoundland when it joined Canadian confederation in 1949 and a new Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador was formed under the leadership of Joseph Smallwood. The pre-Commission of Government Liberals, both in their early incarnation and their relaunching under Whiteway, tended to be identified more with poorer Newfoundlanders, while the Conservatives tended to be the party of the business establishment.

<doc id="1018396" wikidata="Q209374" url="?curid=1018396" title="Checker Motors Corporation">
<text>Checker Motors Corporation was a vehicle manufacturer, and later an automotive subcontractor, based in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The company was established by Morris Markin in 1922, created by a merger of the firms Commonwealth Motors and Markin Automobile Body, and was initially named the Checker Cab Manufacturing Company. The manufacturer was originally based in Chicago, before moving to Kalamazoo in 1923. The company was renamed Checker Motors in 1958. 

Checker made the iconic American taxi cab, valued by taxicab companies for its durability in heavy use. Special features included wide rear doors, large rear seats and trunks, and jump seats for two extra passengers. In later years, the company had trouble competing with fleet discounts offered by the larger manufacturers, as well as economies of scale in procuring components. The final models were produced in 1982. After 1982, Checker invested significantly in the third party manufacturing business, serving GM and Chrysler.

On January 16, 2009, the company filed for Chapter 11 protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.

==Corporate history==
===Pre-Checker history and its formation===
Commonwealth Motors in 1919, introduced the &quot;Mogul Taxi&quot;. Commonwealth could trace its history back to the DeSchaum Motor Syndicate, later renamed Suburban Limiteds, who founded in 1908 in Buffalo, New York. The Mogul combined the sturdy Commonwealth frame with a purpose-built taxicab body from Lomberg Auto Body Manufacturing Company, who were founded in the late 1910s by Russian immigrant Abraham Lomberg in Joliet, Illinois. Soon after, Lomberg looked for further capital to increase the capacity to build the expected orders for the Mogul, and took out a $15,000 personal loan from businessman, Morris Markin. Markin had emigrated from Russia in 1913 and worked as a clothier in Chicago, Illinois, earning his fortune by winning a contract to supply uniforms to the United States Army during World War I. 

However, demand for the Mogul was lower than expected and Lomberg defaulted on the loan, surrendering his company to Markin in late 1920. When Markin took over he renamed the business Markin Automobile Body. Mogul sales continued to be slow, but Commonwealth was rescued temporarily from bankruptcy by a large order from Checker Taxi in late 1920. At the time, Checker Taxi was a privately owned taxi operator based in Chicago that had no affiliation with Markin. However, the order only kept Commonwealth afloat for a short while, and eventually it was unable to repay its creditors and entered it bankruptcy in late 1921. Markin offered Commonwealth&#x27;s receivers Markin Automobile Body shares for the company&#x27;s assets. Markin was helped by the assets of Markin Automobile Body being valued at $182,703, a figure that was greater than its actual worth, and that it was probably the only offer on the table. The offer was accepted by the receivers in October 1921, with Markin merging the two firms in 
May 1922 as the Checker Cab Manufacturing Company in May 1922.
Checker Cab produced the Mogul alongside Commonwealth passenger cars briefly, but soon began concentrating on commercial sales, introducing the Checker &quot;Model C&quot; on June 18, 1922, followed by a Mogul variant, the &quot;Model H&quot;, later that year. Markin is credited with devising and applying the brand&#x27;s signature checkerboard trim to the vehicle&#x27;s beltline. With the ongoing war between Checker Taxi and Yellow Cab, including Markin&#x27;s house being bombed, Markin decided he needed to move his business away from Chicago. Checker Cab moved to Kalamazoo in 1923, taking over two factories previously operated by Dort Motor Car Company and Handley-Knight. In 1930, Checkers came in either black, maroon, yellow or canary.

===Solidifying the taxi market===
Markin gradually acquired the unrelated taxicab operator Checker Taxi of Chicago over the course of the 1920s. In 1929, he purchased Checker Taxi&#x27;s rival Yellow Cab Company from John D. Hertz, who had grown weary of the decade-long Chicago Taxi War between Checker and Yellow Cab. The two operators were merged into the Parmelee Transportation Company. Yellow Cab previously had used taxicabs built by a subsidiary, the Yellow Cab Manufacturing Company, but after Yellow Cab (the taxi operator) was folded into Parmelee, both companies turned to Checker Cab instead, ensuring a steady demand for its taxicabs. Yellow Cab Mfg. had been established in 1920 and following its acquisition by General Motors (GM) in 1925, was reorganized as Yellow Truck &amp; Coach. By that time, Yellow Cab Mfg. had begun to pivot towards producing motorbuses, but continued to manufacture taxicabs. Markin would go on to acquire the principal taxicab operating companies in New York City, Pittsburgh, and Minneapolis. From 1922 to 1928, Checker Cab made and sold 8,019 taxicabs to various operators.

Markin&#x27;s captive market strategy proved sound during the Great Depression; with Checker Cab sales holding steady, the company continued to return a reliable profit. Although the year-to-date profit for Checker Cab in May 1931 was just US$665, it was still a positive profit when many automobile manufacturers were struggling, prompting GM to rename the Yellow Cab company to General Cab and to re-enter the taxicab market. However, operators took advantage of GM&#x27;s generous terms which did not include a repayment schedule. General Motors withdrew from the market in 1938. Checker&#x27;s strategy also attracted the attention of the federal government, which later brought an antitrust suit against Checker and Markin under the Sherman Act. Although the case was initially dismissed by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, that decision was reversed by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1947 and decided in favor of the defendants in 1948, who argued successfully that Checker Cab&#x27;s successes with taxicab operators were due to the marque&#x27;s inherent advantages and not the complex relationships between the manufacturer and operators: because Checker Cab&#x27;s vehicles were purpose-built for the taxicab industry, operators naturally would choose them over modified passenger cars. After another appeal, the Supreme Court upheld the lower court&#x27;s verdict in 1949.

When Parmelee was founded, Markin owned 12% of the shares of Checker Cab Mfg.; his share declined to 5% by mid-1930. The largest shareholder was a group led by John J. Raskob and millionaire Pierre S. duPont, which controlled 34%. 1931 was a profitable year for Checker, but that would soon change in 1932 as the depression finally caught up with the company. After several profitable years, sales collapsed and Checker started to bleed money, generating losses month after month. So bad was the economy that Checker shut down for several weeks at the tail end of 1932. In 1932, Checker Cab introduced the Model T and switched from Buda engines to Lycoming, which was owned by E. L. Cord. 1933 found many auto manufacturers in the midst of significant financial issues. Checker now needed to recapitalize. Unfortunately for Checker CEO Morris Markin, a hostile corporate takeover ensued via a series of capital transactions. The corporate board was reduced in size by the Raskob-duPont group in June 1933; the smaller board, which included duPont, subsequently voted to oust Markin.
However, Markin still retained his small share of ownership and held options to acquire a 60 percent share of the company. Ten days later Markin sold those options to E. L. Cord for less than $1 million; Checker Cab became part of the Cord Corporation and Markin was reinstalled as head of the company. With funds secured and new ownership in place, Checker Cab was integrated into the Auburn–Cord–Duesenberg (A-C-D) group, allowing Checker to operate autonomously and still draw on engineering talent from the larger group, including Auburn vice-president of engineering Herbert C. Snow.

Three short years later Cord and Markin came under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for their dealings in Checker Cab stock, which had raised the price from US$7 per share in November 1935 to $69 per share in April 1936. In order to avoid prosecution, Cord sold the Cord Corporation to the Aviation Corporation in 1937. Morris Markin bought out Cord&#x27;s interest in Checker Cab and was able to secure complete control of Checker. A-C-D eventually folded in the wake of the stock scandal but the now-independent Checker continued to produce taxicabs. Between 1929 and 1942, when production was suspended for World War II, Checker Cab made 29,260 cabs.

===Return to tradition===
After the war, Checker Cab began developing several new models which never made it to production; the Model A2 that was introduced in 1947 was mechanically similar to the pre-war (1939) Model A. The Model A also had switched to a new engine supplier; Checker cabs now used the Continental inline-six. The A2 was introduced alongside the A3, which had a different internal configuration to seat up to eight passengers. The A2/A3 went through minor modifications as the A4/A5 and A6/A7.

In addition to taxicabs, Checker briefly built the chassis for the Series E transit buses; the primary customer was Detroit Street Railways.
In 1956, Checker introduced the A8, which continued with minor styling changes as the A9/A10 and A11/A12 through the end of Checker vehicle production in 1982. Also that year, the company changed its name to Checker Motors Corporation. The A9 was the designation for the taxicab model, while the A10 was the corresponding vehicle sold to the public as a passenger car; a similar relationship exists between the A11 and A12, which were introduced in 1961.

By the 1970s, conventional automobiles from the Big Three were replacing the purpose-built Checker Cabs; the Checker was considered &quot;too big, too cumbersome, [and] too thirsty&quot; as it had been built to meet obsolescent requirements.

In 1982, with the body stamping dies wearing out, production of the Checker Cab was discontinued.

===Subcontracting===
After winding down vehicle production in 1982, Checker Motors served as a subcontractor, supplying automotive parts and stampings to Detroit-area manufacturers.

In 1989, Checker Motors and Checker Holding Company were involved in a reverse acquisition with International Controls Corporation (Great Dane Trailers), and the company later changed its name to CRA Holdings. The company was reorganized in 1995 into three wholly owned subsidiaries: Yellow Cab (owns and leases taxicabs in Chicago), Chicago Autoworks (taxicab repair and other services) and CMC Kalamazoo. Other subsidiaries include American Country Insurance Company (a provider of property and casualty insurance), Great Dane (the largest manufacturer of truck trailers, containers and chassis) and South Charleston Stamping &amp; Manufacturing Company. The company was renamed Great Dane Limited Partnership, and was acquired by Chicago-based CC Industries.

Purchased in August 1989, South Charleston Stamping was sold by Checker to Mayflower Corp. in November 1996. South Charleston Stamping had been owned previously by Volkswagen and supported Volkswagen automobile production in Pennsylvania in the late 1970s.

Checker Motors operated as a subsidiary of CC Industries as an automotive subcontractor, primarily for General Motors, into the 21st century. Checker made body stamping for various GMC/Chevrolet truck lines and chassis components for Cadillac. David Markin, son of founder Morris Markin, continued to act as CMC Chief Executive Officer.

In 2008, due to the late-2000s recession and high gasoline prices, sales at GM and other automakers plummeted. As a major supplier to GM, Checker saw its sales drop significantly. The company had net sales of $61 million in 2008 and projected 2009 sales of only $34.5 million, a decline of 43%. During the summer of 2008, Checker employed about 340 workers.

While the United States economy was in full recession, Checker Motors CEO David Markin fell victim to the Ponzi scheme started and run by Bernie Madoff. David Markin&#x27;s name appears five times on the official list of Madoff victims. One address on the list was 2016 North Pitcher Street, Kalamazoo, the same address as Checker Motors Corp.

On January 16, 2009, the 87-year-old Kalamazoo company filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Escalating raw material prices and dwindling sales for its customers&#x27; products were cited as the main reasons for the filing, but another reason was labor costs. It was reported that a deal with unionized labor could not be reached after a year of negotiations.

At the time of the bankruptcy, Checker&#x27;s customer base included General Motors, Chrysler LLC, Ford Motor Company, Navistar International and GM Shanghai. Checker was the eighth-largest American auto supplier to go bankrupt in recent years. GM and Chrysler followed Checker&#x27;s bankruptcy just several months later.

In February, Checker asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for Western Michigan to reject its contract with 125 union workers and eliminate health care and pension benefits for 176 union retirees. On February 27, 2009, the judge in Checker Motors Corp.&#x27;s bankruptcy case threw out the company&#x27;s request to eliminate its labor agreement. Bankruptcy Judge James D. Gregg agreed with United Steelworkers Union Local 2-682 attorneys that the company had not treated all parties involved in the proceeding fairly when it awarded four top executives a total of $275,000 in retention bonuses prior to filing for bankruptcy.

In March 2009, a committee of unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy case asked Judge Gregg to consider whether negotiations among the union, United Steel Workers Local 2-682 and Checker Motors could resume and reach concessions or if a mediator should be brought in, according to court documents.

On April 4, 2009, Checker notified its more than 270 employees that CMC would close its business by the end of June.

In a bankruptcy court hearing Monday, April 6, 2009, CMC and labor union representatives said they intended to continue trying to negotiate a new union contract that would allow Checker Motors to survive.

In May Checker was given permission to enter into agreements with General Motors Corp. that were intended to help the bankrupt supplier stay afloat until it could negotiate the sale of itself to a new owner.

In late May, Checker announced that it found a potential buyer, the Narmco Group. On June 9, 2009, Judge Gregg approved the sale of Checker Motors Corp. to the subsidiaries of two Canadian automotive suppliers, Narmco Group LLC and Van-Rob Inc.

The Narmco Group, based in Windsor, Ontario, paid $650,000 for Checker&#x27;s business of making stamped metal and welded assemblies for GM trucks and other vehicles. Van-Rob Inc., based in Aurora, Ontario, paid $950,000 for some of Checker&#x27;s manufacturing equipment.

Christopher Grosman, an attorney representing Checker Motors, told Judge Gregg that the offers from Narmco and Van-Rob represented the &quot;highest and best value&quot; to Checker&#x27;s creditors. Grosman said much of the company&#x27;s machinery could not be sold because, in the wake of downsizing throughout the automotive industry, the market had been flooded with similar equipment.

The $1.6-million sale meant the end of the road for Checker. About 125 Checker workers in Kalamazoo made parts until June 30, then the business was transferred to Canada. In July 2009, General Motors Corp paid $1.5 million to Walker Tool and Dies for tools and dies that remained on site at Checker. Walker Tool had liens on the tools, so payment was required to move the tools to Canada. The tooling was transferred to Canada to make the Buick Lacrosse.

On January 14, 2010, the Checker Motor Company officially went out of business with the sale of its Kalamazoo headquarters. It was purchased for just under $3 million by a holding company, the Jones Group, which was to sell off the assets and clear the 72 acres. Checker president David Markin was quoted in the New York Times, &quot;It&#x27;s finished. Our family is very distressed about the closing of the company, but it became inevitable.&quot;

Private investment company Oak Point Partners acquired the remaining assets, consisting of any known and unknown assets that weren&#x27;t previously administered, from the Checker Motors Corporation Bankruptcy Estate on January 31, 2018.

==Commercial vehicles==


Checker is best known for its taxicab, on which it built its business and reputation. In its early years Markin not only produced the vehicles but also ran Checker Taxi, a taxicab operator in Chicago that was in direct competition with the Yellow Cab Company, owned by John D. Hertz.

During the 1930s Checker built trailers for Sears-Roebuck and truck cabs for Ford Motor Company. Checker also built four prototype Jeeps that were tested by the U.S. Army. They were developed in partnership with the American Bantam Company (a builder of Austin-based tiny autos) and featured four-wheel drive and four-wheel steering. During World War II Checker built tank retrieval trailers, tank recovery vehicles and semi-, petroleum and other types of trailers.

Checker designs changed infrequently; Markin held on to certain design features long after they were discontinued by major automobile manufacturers. For example, open front fenders were retained by Markin into the 1940s because it saved operators the expense of repairing minor dents. Taxicab models were designated by a letter series; significant modifications in models (new major systems, etc.) were designated by a number following the model letter.

Checker&#x27;s commercial vehicles were usually given letter designations instead of model names (most notably variations of the Checker Model A). An exception to this rule was the Checker Aerobus, an extended version of its cars, built on a stretched wheelbase allowing for each row of seats to have its own doors. The Aerobus was often associated with airports and train stations, although vacation resorts also used Aerobuses for transporting guests.

===Early taxis (C, H, H2, E, F, G)===
The early Models C and H were built at Joliet; with the move to Kalamazoo, Checker introduced the Model H2. The Kalamazoo factory opened on June 23, 1923. Models E, F, and G followed; all of these early taxicabs were based on the original Commonwealth &quot;Mogul&quot; design. Model E was offered as a five-passenger vehicle from 1924 to 1926 with a choice of three body styles: Landau, Limousine, or Roadster. The Model F was introduced in 1925 and could be distinguished from the Model E by its raked windshield, and the Model G, introduced in 1927, offered an optional six-cylinder engine for the first time. At Kalamazoo, bodies were built at the former Dort factory on South Pitcher Street, then shipped to the former Handley-Knight factory on North Pitcher Street where the chassis were built, being integrated at North Pitcher as each finished chassis rolled off the line.

===Model K (1928)===

There were major changes at Checker with a truly new model, the Model K, introduced on October 4, 1928. An advanced, modern design for its day, it was now a purpose built taxi with luxurious town car styling cues. The body was integrated in its design bumper to bumper; no longer did it possess the Commonwealth Mogul front clip mated to a taxicab body first introduced in 1918.

The Model K was Checker&#x27;s first ground-up design, introduced 6 years after the founding of Checker. Consistent with previous Checkers, the Model K utilized a 127-inch wheelbase and the Buda six-cylinder was now the only engine available. Within the first month of introduction, there were over 4,800 orders. By January 1929, 950 units had been produced and sold. At the end of January 1929, over 8,000 Checkers were chasing fares in New York City, a city with a total population of 21,000 cabs. This made Checker one of the two dominant taxicab builders in the US, the other being Yellow Cab Manufacturing. Together, the two taxicab manufacturers pushed the other taxicab producers, Premier, Pennant and HCS, out of the market. These two taxicab giants would slug it out through the next decade.

===Model M (1930)===
The Model M was introduced in late 1930; compared to the Model K, the M had front fenders that pointed straight forward, carried headlights set in rectangular bezels, and rode on a wheelbase shorter. The M carried a more powerful Buda J-214 six-cylinder engine with , more than double the output of the Buda CS6 in the K.

In addition to the taxicab sedans, the Model M was available with a &quot;utility&quot; station wagon body as the MU6 in 1931 and 1932. Wealthy businessman Samuel Insull ordered a custom bulletproof M limousine, but was tried for fraud one year after he took delivery; it is not known what happened to his car.

===Model T (1933) ===

Despite the losses of 1932 and using minimal funds, Checker was able to introduce a new taxicab for 1933, the Model T, derived from the Model M. The new taxicab utilized the new Lycoming GU or GUC straight-eight cylinder engine; Lycoming was part of the Auburn-Cord-Duesenberg (A-C-D) group owned by E.L. Cord, who also had recently assumed ownership of Checker.

In 1933 Checker would also produce a brand-engineered version of the Model T, the Auburn Safe-T-Cab for A-C-D, which was sold in limited numbers to the Safe-T-Cab Company in Cleveland. Like the Model M, the Model T also was offered in a &quot;Suburban Utility&quot; variant for 1933 and 1934. In addition, approximately 500 Model T trucks were built in 1933.

===Model Y (1934)===

In 1934, Checker began development of a new taxicab, the Model Y. It was the third offering in the evolution of the 1928 Model K and quite striking in appearance, with many style cues reminiscent of its new corporate cousin, the Auburn, albeit an industrial version. Cord continued his method of marketing through up-to-date style and a sense of luxury, adding chrome trim, flared fenders, padded tops and vacuum-powered sunroofs.

The Model Y also served as a platform for many new Checker concepts to be utilized for the next 50 years. The long wheelbase version could be purchased in 6- and 8-door variations and also offered an integrated body trunk, a first in the automotive industry. This configuration yielded the first mass-produced car with a three box design, years ahead of the 1947 Studebaker and 1949 Ford post-war offerings.

Other features included a multi-position adjustable driver seat and glass windows in the roof that passengers would love when sightseeing in major cities. Looks alone were not the only similarities to Auburn; the Model Y utilized the Lycoming 148 hp inline GFD 8, the same engine used in the Auburn 850, although later in 1936 there was the option of a six-cylinder Continental engine. This taxicab would be produced until 1939.

In addition to automobile production, Checker played a significant role as a third-party automotive supplier of OEM body stampings. In the late 1930s Checker produced truck bodies for Hudson in addition to manufacturing complete Ford truck cabs. Checker also produced truck bodies for the REO Motor Car Company.

===Model A (1939)===
The Model A was put on sale in 1940. When the Checker Model A was introduced it had more interior room than any previous model produced. It was also the first Checker to migrate away from the limousine concept with its driver dividers, focusing on the taxi commodity business: the Model A brochure, placed significant emphasis that taxi operators should consider themselves the seller of a commodity and should think of new ways to attract customers.

With the Model A, Checker incorporated new features to enhance the taxi passenger riding experience, including the new landaulet top, where at a touch of a finger, the driver could lower the back section of the roof so that passengers could ride in an open-air mode. If shade was required, a cloth awning could be inserted to reduce the effects of the sun, yet still maintain the open-air feel. Passengers in the jump seats were not left out of the experience, because above their heads was a ventilated glass roof (marketed as &quot;Air-n-Lite&quot;) that passengers could open to increase the flow of fresh air, yet still sight-see through the glass roof. Both the glass roof and the landaulet roof were Checker exclusive features, patented in 1936 and 1939 respectively.

The taxi driver also rode with the comfort of Checker exclusive features. Checker claimed that the seat could be adjusted in no less than 15 positions, because the company had always maintained that a comfortable seat would allow the driver to drive longer shifts and yield greater profits for taxicab operators. This Checker exclusive had been patented in 1931. Above the driver&#x27;s head was a vent in the roof to allow fresh air to flow into the driver compartment. The driver compartment was now protected during all four seasons and for the first time was heated. Gone were the days of drivers being exposed to the weather. The manual transmission shift was moved to the steering column, again in an effort to improve the overall driving experience.

From the rear back, the Model A has the very tasteful streamline styling that was very popular at the time; that said, the Model A front end has always garnered strong opinions from automobile fans. Early artists’ renditions of the Model A depict an integrated streamline design from fore to aft, but the production car sports a unique, even gothic front clip. It&#x27;s unclear why the major change in the front end styling was made to the production vehicle, but it has been said that the “sugar scoop” fenders, inherited in part from the preceding Model Y, were purpose built to provide safety from tire damage in minor city traffic accidents. At the time, other taxis with streamlined fenders ran the risk of having a tyre pierced in a minor accident, whereas the Model A had a higher probability of driving away.

The Checker Model A was only made for two full years, 1939 and 1940. 1941 was a shortened model run due to WWII.

===Post-WW2: Models B, C, and D===
Over the years the rumour grew up that Morris Markin melted down all the body tools and dies for the war effort. Automobile production ceased as Checker supported the army by supplying them with trailers to be used with a new invention of the war, the Jeep. During this time Checker was one of many producers of the G518 Ben Hur trailer.

As the war ended, Checker was facing the challenge of designing and producing a new postwar car. During this period Checker utilized two innovative consultants, Herbert C. Snow and Ray Dietrich. Snow was formerly the chief of engineering at Auburn-Cord-Duesenberg. While at A-C-D, Snow was the engineering leader who designed the front-wheel drive system used on the classic Cord L-29 and 810/812. Morris Markin hired Ray Dietrich as a consultant in May 1938, for the hefty sum of one hundred dollars a day. Like Snow, Dietrich was an experienced designer, having worked for Briggs, Le Baron and eventually Chrysler. Dietrich&#x27;s rise at Chrysler was credited to his redesign of the Chrysler Airflow; the resulting Chrysler Airstream saved Chrysler from the sales failure of the Airflow.

Now, with two of the automotive industry&#x27;s top engineers, Checker set out to introduce a replacement for the Model A. Called the Model B, the new, very unconventional Checker was to be very different from Checkers of the past, or for that matter any US produced car. Snow proposed a rear engine/rear drive vehicle, much like the Volkswagen Microbus. In a memo in May 1945 Snow laid out his vision. He wrote, &quot;The primary purpose of a vehicle of this kind is to carry passengers comfortably and economically. To do this, passengers must be placed in the most advantageous seating and riding position. The vehicle must be light if it is to operate economically. Keeping weight to a minimum means that the entire vehicle must be as compact as possible without any sacrifice in passenger space.&quot; The project progressed to the development of a mule. Designated the Model C, it utilized a L-head Continental 6 placed transversely in the rear of the cab, mated to a Warner three speed manual transmission. The overall length of the cab was 198.5 inches and the wheelbase was 100 inches. As was always the case with Checker being an &quot;assembled car&quot;, many components for the Model C were sourced from the &quot;parts bin&quot; of other makers and independent component producers. In the case of the test mule, the front and rear suspension, brakes and wheels were from Studebaker.

The test mule went through extensive testing, and the results were poor. Prior to his death, Snow recounted to automotive writer Karl Ludvigsen the facts of the project:

&quot;The objections to this design were that a vehicle of this type with the engine mounted in the rear behind the rear axle cannot have good weight distribution on a short wheelbase. There was too much weight on the rear wheels for good roadability and performance. Furthermore we had passenger seats facing each other as in trains and this we considered would be very objectionable to the passengers who rode backwards in the front seat.&quot;
Given its poor handling and questionable passenger comfort, the project was killed.

In the summer of 1945, Snow moved on to a new project, the Checker Model D. Like the Model C, it was unconventional. It would be a front-wheel drive vehicle with a transverse engine mounted forward of the cab. Plans called for a significant number of variations to be produced, including sedans, limos, station wagons, coupes, convertibles, and light trucks.

Two running prototypes, a five-passenger sedan and a seven-passenger taxicab, were developed. The prototypes were equipped with a transverse mounted Continental 6 cylinder engines mated to a 3-speed manual transmission. The prototypes rode on a 112-inch wheelbase within a total length of 189.5 inches, six inches shorter than the 1946 Ford sedan and a foot shorter than the Model C prototype. The Dietrich styling was quite attractive and current. Unlike the Model A, its front end styling was well integrated into the overall design of the car, bearing a very close resemblance to the 1941 Chrysler.

The two prototypes were tested for well over 100,000 miles. The taxicab was tested in real taxi service, accumulating over 35,000 miles and the sedan ran in tests totaling over 65,000 miles. According to Snow, quoted in Special Interest Auto Magazine in 1973, &quot;The passengers commented on the excellent ride qualities and the drivers claimed it was easy to keep on the road, handled well in traffic and on the highway.&quot; Tested in the early winter, according to Snow: &quot;In heavy blizzards under adverse road conditions, it performed exceptionally well, pulling out from curbs blocked with snow without difficulty.&quot; Although both vehicles tested well, in the end it appeared that the Model D would have a higher cost per unit to produce. Tests also indicated that maintenance cost for the more complex FWD Checker would be higher than Taxi operators would find acceptable. The Model D project was killed in 1946, which left Checker with a major problem. The company had not produced a car in close to five years and whatever Markin had done with the body tooling, there was none left from the Model A to continue production in the post war years. A new effort was initiated to quickly develop a modified version of the Model A; the resulting product would be the Model A2.

===Model A2 (1946)===

Checker rapidly developed a replacement for the Model A, combining the chassis and engine configuration of the original Model A with the Dietrich-designed body of the Model D. The resulting vehicle was called the Model A2. The body passenger compartment of the A2 is virtually identical to the Model D, the only difference being the length of the front clip, which was redesign to be configured for a front inline Continental 6-cylinder flathead engine and rear wheel drive configuration of the Model A. The Checker A2 dimensions were consistent with most large US produced automobiles at a total length of riding on a wheelbase of .

The Model A2 was developed in less than one year and was introduced to the public on December 15, 1946, in &quot;Automotive Industries&quot; Magazine. Checker&#x27;s partnership with A-C-D in the 1930s had included sharing engineering talent. Herb Snow, the vice-president of engineering for Auburn, previously had introduced a rear-drive ladder frame chassis with an X-shaped brace in 1931 with the Auburn 8-98. Snow would later use a similar X-braced ladder frame under the Checker A2. Despite the limited time and fast-paced development time the patented X-Frame continued to set the bar for purpose built taxis. The A2 was a stylish car with pontoon fenders that flowed into the doors, a classic long hood and curvaceous passenger cabin. The body line behind the windshield was comparable with the styling on other classic cars of the period. Missing from the Model A were the driver roof vent, the glass roof and the landaulet opening roof.

===Model A3 (1947)===

The following year, in August 1947 Checker introduced another model, the A3. Called a pleasure car, this automobile was Checker&#x27;s first official entry into the non-taxi market; a car that could be sold into the “Black Car” limo markets that were growing in most US cities. A deluxe version of the A2, the A3 sported a full-width bench front seat, more chrome, and was equipped with a rear trunk. This was the first time Checker had offered a trunk as standard equipment. Since the A2 was designed as a taxi cab, it did not have a trunk. This was because many US cities still had laws on the books that prohibited taxis equipped with trunks. Many of these laws dated back to the prohibition era as rumrunners would transport illegal booze out of sight of the police in the trunks of taxicabs.

In 1947, Checker began limited sales of the A3 to the public; previously, Checker sold almost exclusively to commercial operators.

===Models A4 &amp; A5 (1950) | A6 &amp; A7 (1953)===

Checker introduced the A4 and A5 in 1950, minor updates to the A2 and A3 respectively for the taxicab and limousine markets. Overall length grew modestly to , but both vehicles retained the same wheelbase as their predecessors. The windows, jump seats, and grille were enlarged; the new models had an aggregate increase of of glass area.

The A6 and A7 followed in 1953, with the A6 intended for the taxicab market and the A7 as a limousine. For passengers, the primary difference from the preceding A4/A5 was a raised roof to improve rear headroom.

===Model A8 (1956)===

When New York City limited the wheelbase of taxis to 120 inches, Checker was ready with a brand-new body that would form the basic styling until the end of production in 1982. This was the A8, which featured slab-sided, boxy styling for the first time. The A8, produced from 1956 to 1958, had single headlights and a heavy bar-type grille in front, with high-mounted taillights resembling the 1953 Chevrolet. The basic chassis and drivetrain, however, remained similar to previous models going back to the 1939 Model A, including its Continental F-226 &quot;Red Seal&quot; inline 6 cylinder engine.

The body was designed to simplify maintenance, as exterior panels were fastened by bolts and could be replaced without special tools or welding; the front and rear bumpers were interchangeable. The X-frame chassis used a Dana 44 rear axle on leaf springs with an independent front suspension that used some components from the 1954 Ford models. The A8 was equipped with drum brakes and a three-speed manual transmission.
===Model A9 (1958)===
For 1958, a restyle of the A8 was introduced, the A9. It featured dual headlights, and a revised egg-crate grille with parking lights built in, surrounded by a &quot;starburst&quot; design. Shortly after the A9 was introduced, Checker began marketing their cars to the general public, the first of these being the A10 Superba, which was a &quot;civilian&quot; A9 with the taxi equipment removed. The Superba was available both as a four-door sedan and as a station wagon. The wagon was designated &quot;A10W&quot;.
===Model A11 (1961)===

The A11 (sold to the public as the A12) was introduced in 1961 and incorporated quad headlamps. During the 1960s, Checker usually managed to meet its target volume of 6,000-7,000 cars a year. In 1962, production topped 8,000, most of which were taxis.

In 1964, the state of New York pursued Markin and Checker on antitrust charges, alleging that it controlled both the taxi service and manufacture of taxis, and thus favored itself in fulfilling orders. Rather than allow Checker drivers to begin buying different brands of cars, Markin began selling licenses in New York City.

The next year, the company switched from the Continental inline six engine, offering either Chevrolet overhead-valve I6s or small block V8s. The Continental F-226 was an L-head design that was built for reliability and longevity with an output of ; however, the special features meant they were sold to Checker at a loss, so when Continental raised the price of the engine, Teledyne Continental vice president Bill Rutherford recalled the company lost the Checker account and that &quot;everybody was mad at us. But we stopped the losses, or &#x27;advertising&#x27; expense&quot; of overbuilt engines. It was the last automotive application for the venerable Continental design, as the company had moved on to specialize in aviation engines after the war. Checker went on to incorporate an ever higher percentage of GM parts.

By the 1970s the Checker cab design was several automotive generations old. As the decade started, the Checker A11 design had been in production for close to twenty years. A11 design elements could be attributed to a 1950 clay design. Some chassis components retained ancestral linkage to the 1939 Model A design. 

The A11 and A12 were still produced throughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s, albeit in ever-smaller numbers and updated for Federal safety and emissions requirements. In July 1982, the last Checker automobile left the Kalamazoo assembly plant. It was an A11 Taxi, painted in Chicago green and ivory livery. Checker was now out of the automobile manufacturing business.

===Epilogue===
The last operating Checker Cab in New York City, an A11 built in 1978 with plate #1N11 and nicknamed &quot;Janie&quot;, was retired in on July 26, 1999, as a New York City taxicab ordinance passed in 1996 requires that livery vehicles be replaced after six years of service. Janie, which racked up during her service, has since been sold at auction in 1999 (US$134,500), 2006 ($9,400), and 2015 ($7,700).

Today, the vast majority of Checker automobiles are gone, having spent hard lives as taxicabs over rough city streets. Most survivors are from the later A11 and A12 models, and occasionally come up for sale at collector car shows and Internet sites. Virtually all of the pre-1960 models are gone with the exception of a handful of cars in museums, since they were never prized as collector cars.

Pre-war survivors include two Model H (one owned by the Gilmore Car Museum and the other in Hollywood), one Model G pickup, one Model T, two Model Ms (a taxi and a farm truck), and two Model Ys (one sedan and one two truck conversion). Only one 1939 Model A is known to exist. It has been restored and resides in a private collection.

A few post-war Checkers are in the hands of collectors. Approximately one dozen Checker Model A2s survive in Finland, which had imported 500 ex-Chicago taxicabs for service during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Only one each of the Checker Model A3 and A4 exist and they are currently owned by a private Checker collector. Five Checker A8s (one wrecked) survive and are also owned by private collectors.

The largest collection of restored Checker Cabs is held at the National Auto &amp; Truck Museum in Auburn, Indiana, which acquired six cars as a donation in 2012. Ben Merkel, who owns and operates Twilight Taxi Parts, had approximately 80 Checker Cabs in 2003. Twilight Taxi donated the 1981 A11 which is now on exhibit at the Henry Ford Museum.

The very last Checker automobile assembled, the 1982 A11 Chicago Taxi, resides in the Gilmore Museum in Hickory Corners, Michigan. Never having seen taxi use, it remains brand-new with less than 10 miles on its odometer. The Gilmore Museum also owns a 1923 Model H2, one of the first to be assembled in Kalamazoo, and a Model Y. Yellow Cab of New London, Connecticut owns the only surviving Model M. The Auburn Cord Duesenberg Automobile Museum owns the only surviving Model T. Also present is the 1978 A11 &quot;Cab 804,&quot; made famous in the television show &quot;Taxi.&quot; Painted in NYC livery, it remains basically new with less than 400 total miles on the odometer.

==Consumer vehicles==
From 1922 to 1947, Checker&#x27;s production vehicles were built almost exclusively for the commercial livery (taxi) business, although cars for personal use were available upon request. In 1947 the Checker Model A3 was introduced. The major difference between the A2 Taxicab was the inclusion of a full front bench seat and opening trunk. Checker had limited success with the A3 pleasure car.

Checker needed to enter the consumer vehicle market when taxi sales declined. New York City sales dropped significantly due to the new 1954 taxi commission regulations that expanded big three competition in the market. Checker needed to enter the retail market to fill plant capacity lost to the big 3. In 1956 Checker started to expand its distribution channel with the introduction of regional sales offices. When Checker introduced the Checker Model A8, it officially entered the retail sale market. Articles and reviews were generated in &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; and &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine. Sales were phased in regionally across the US in 1959, starting in New York and New England. Nationally, introduction of the Checker Superba took place at the Chicago Auto Show on February 8, 1960. Checker continued to expand its dealer network on a regional basis. The first new market after New York City was Boston and parts of New England. 

The dealer network continued to grow throughout the early 1960s. Four-door sedans and station wagons (Superba and Marathon models) also were advertised to individual customers in upscale publications. The ads emphasized the durability of the Checker and the attention to quality improvements. In 1962, almost 3,000 cars were sold to individuals—20% of production—but that percentage declined to 10% in the 1970s.

===A10 Superba and A12 Marathon===

The A10/A12 consumer car designs were derived from the A8/A9/A11 taxicabs. The A8 was Checker&#x27;s response to new New York City taxi laws that mandated taxis could not run on a chassis wheelbase longer than . Civilian models were as utilitarian as their fleet counterparts, sporting a simple, flat dashboard with round gauges (this would remain unchanged up to the final Checkers in 1982), rubber mats instead of carpeting and hardboard ceilings. Floors were flat to allow easy entry and exit. Checker cars and taxicabs used the same basic body and chassis design from 1956 until production ceased, as Morris Markin declared that there would be no major changes as long as there was a demand for the car. However, numerous alterations in the appearance of the cars were made throughout production, especially in the late 1960s and 1970s.

In February 1960 Checker introduced the Checker Superba nationally, its first model specifically built for the consumer market. In its initial year, the civilian sedans and station wagons were marketed as the Superba Standard or Superba Special. Vehicle Identification Numbers had three parts, starting with the model code, then the production order, and then the serial number, which started at 37396. The sedans carried a model code of A10 and the wagons were coded as WA10. The wagons were more expensive (suggested retail price was US$2896 for the Superba Standard wagon, compared to US$2542 for the Standard sedan, with corresponding Special prices being approximately $100 more) and heavier. The only engine was the Continental inline six, which had been used in dozens of cars (including Kaiser-Frazer) and trucks since the 1930s. Two versions were offered: a low-compression L-head unit with only in the sedans and an OHV unit for the wagons with higher compression and . There were few changes for 1961: the Superba Special was renamed to the Marathon and model codes for 1961 and 1962 were W/10L (sedan) and W/A10 (wagon) instead. 1962 was the last year for the A10 model codes. Wagons came standard with a motorized fold-down rear seat, which — combined with different bodies — pushed the price $350 above the sedan. Three-on-the-tree manual shift was standard, and a Borg-Warner three-speed automatic with optional overdrive was an option.

In 1963, model codes switched to A12 (sedan) and A12W (wagon) and a long-wheelbase limousine (the Marathon Town Custom) was introduced with model code A19E, riding on a wheelbase extended to . The high-compression OHV 6 was made optional for all vehicles. For 1964, which was the last year for the Continental 6, the Superba name was dropped and the Town Custom model code was revised to A12E. Some of the 1964 Checkers were revised later to be part of the 1965 model year if their serial number was higher than 20000. This also was the year that Chevrolet engines and transmissions were offered; the standard engine was the &quot;Turbo-Thrift&quot; 230 I-6 and the optional engine was the small block 283 V-8; an optional 2-speed Turbo Hydramatic could be specified as a $248 option instead of the standard 3-speed Warner Gear manual transmission. A second engine option, the small block 327 V-8, was added for 1966. The A12E extended-wheelbase sedan was dropped for the 1967 model year, but presumably was available as a special order as Aerobus production continued. 

Starting in 1967, an energy-absorbing steering column was fitted to meet safety regulations, similar in appearance to AMC&#x27;s column. Round side marker lights on each fender were added in 1968. Seat belts were fitted as mandated by the United States government, including shoulder belts on Checkers built after December 1967. The 1969 cars got high-rise headrests and 1970 models adopted the government-required steering column and shift lever lock. The 1974 Checkers eschewed the attractive, chrome-plated bumpers for girder-like, aluminum-painted units. The 1975 models featured the catalytic converter emissions device, which came with an &quot;Unleaded Fuel Only&quot; label for both fuel gauge and fuel filler. 

During the 1970s, Checkers adopted a standard Chevrolet steering column assembly, including steering wheel (without the &quot;Chevrolet&quot; badges), shift lever and ignition switch. The 1978 and later models can be identified when Chevrolet switched to a &quot;Delta Spoke&quot; steering wheel design, duly used on Checkers. The rear fold-down jump seats were also removed, as they failed all safety tests. Parallel-action windshield wipers also appeared on the 1978 models.

Checker&#x27;s cars were lightly marketed, using campaigns that centered on their durability and unchanging style. Checker promoted its vehicles as cars at a time when most United States automakers shied away from mileage promises. Overall, Checker sales began shrinking in the 1970s, causing the company to reduce its production capacity. Limousines were dropped after 1970 and wagons followed in 1974. The standard-wheelbase sedans remained until the end. Production of the Checker consumer vehicles was approximately 1,000 vehicles per year from 1960 through 1968; annual production fell sharply in 1969 to 760 and never recovered to more than 1,000 per year before Checker stopped production in 1982. This decline was due to a number of factors:
* First, the oil embargo of 1973-1974 (and later the 1979-1982 recession) caused the Big Three to lose consumer sales, and they attempted to make up for this by targeting the fleet market more aggressively.
* Many of the body stamping dies were worn out after 20 years of use, and that required manual body adjustments by body-and-fender mechanics to make the parts fit. The fenders and doors were the most problematic, as taxis are involved in numerous minor accidents due to their heavy usage. 
* As a low-volume manufacturer, Checker could not compete on price, which due to inflation had risen to almost $5,000 by the middle of the 1970s. This was Buick and Chrysler territory, and a large sum for a dated design with unimpressive build quality. Safety and emissions requirements added further costs.
* Meanwhile, the company refused several proposals for a replacement to its 20-year-old design.

With the Marathon outmoded and not selling in viable quantities, and with no resources to develop a new model, Checker decided to leave the auto manufacturing business. The last models were produced for the 1982 model year, and the final automobile rolled off the assembly line on July 12, 1982, after members of the Markin family decided to end production rather than meet labor demands.

===Mechanical===
The car had very poor fuel economy, as the tall front end and engine compartment had been designed for a Continental 226-cubic-inch inline six, which required the large engine compartment. In 1964, Checker ceased using Continental engines. Continental had been losing money on each unit sold to Checker for several years and Checker was not interested in a price increase. Checker experimented with several engine options, including the Chrysler 318. Eventually it went to a Chevrolet straight six. That engine, along with an optional Chevrolet V-8, was used until the late 1970s. Engines and drivetrains matched the full-sized Chevrolet models. During the 1970s the Impala&#x27;s Turbo-Hydramatic 400 transmission was fitted to all Checker sedans. Some of the last Checkers built were equipped with Oldsmobile 350 Diesel V8s.

When GM discontinued the straight six in its full-sized Chevrolet models for 1980, Checker purchased a small V6 that was also used in the big Chevrolets. However, the large and tall grill and hood made for poor aerodynamics, which contributed to the car&#x27;s poor fuel economy. A number of the V6s were converted to use propane as fuel.

==Failed replacement projects==
In the 1970s and 1980s, Checker initiated several projects aimed at developing a modern taxi that would allow Checker to produce cars into the next century. The US went through two energy crises in 1973 and 1979, adding motivation for Checker to consider developing a modern fuel efficient taxi that would allow the company to produce cars into the next century. The changes in the market were also making it harder and harder for Checker to find suitable off-the-shelf parts for its existing heavy vehicle, as General Motors (and Detroit overall) moved to producing lighter cars.

===Project Galva===
Several projects were executed in the 1970s in the attempt to develop a new Checker. In 1974, US Steel and prototype builder Autodynamics of Madison Heights, Michigan, proposed a new Checker idea called “Galva” to CMC. The plan was to design a new Checker using newly developed manufacturing techniques to produce a vehicle with a reduced amount of tooling. Unfortunately, the project never got off the drawing board; Checker management was happy and profitable. Checker would continue to produce the A11 and various other specialty cars.

===Volkswagen project===
In March 1977, seven years after the death of Morris Markin, retired GM President Ed Cole and car dealer Victor Potamkin bought into Checker with the intent of re-energizing the company and developing a new, more modern Checker. With Cole as President of Checker&#x27;s taxicab operating company, they planned to purchase partially completed Volkswagen Rabbit&#x27;s from VW&#x27;s new Westmoreland Assembly Plant in Pennsylvania. After shipping the Volkswagens to the Checker Motors factory in Kalamazoo, they would cut them in half and insert a section to lengthen the car, as well as raising the roof and then sell the modified vehicles as taxis. Cole had forecasted that they could sell 50,000 a year, but less than 90 days after joining Checker, Cole died when his plane crashed near Kalamazoo in May 1977. In August 1977, the Checker-VW project was introduced in &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine. The project was scrapped shortly after when it was determined that the Volkswagen was not suitable for taxi service. In 2019, a prototype Checker-VW taxi was found in a former dealership in Kalamazoo after being stored there for an estimated three decades.

===X-body project===
In the early 1980s, by way of a series of financial transactions, David Markin monetized CMC. Potamkin and Cole&#x27;s widow were paid out and both exited the company. Markin had total control of CMC again and the funds available to produce a new Checker. Moving beyond the Rabbit/Golf project, Checker&#x27;s next attempt at a new taxicab was initiated via a partnership with General Motors&#x27; Fisher Body division and Autodynamics. In 1980, General Motors introduced the X-Car line which was a major departure from traditional GM design. It was a front-wheel-drive platform with a transverse engine, similar to the BMC Mini concept. The new Checker was to be front wheel drive, ironic as this concept was first tested by Checker in the mid-1940s with the Model D project. The planned partnership would have Checker purchase Chevrolet Citation “bodies-in-white” and then Checker would assemble them for taxicab use. The project did produce one prototype Citation test mule, but the project was short-lived, and the prototype was destroyed.

===Galva II===
Checker&#x27;s final attempts at introducing a new taxicab came in early 1981. CMC signed a contract with Autodynamics to develop a new model. The project was called Galva II, an extension of the project originally begun back in 1974. Autodynamics developed a design that would use the latest GM components developed under the GM X car program. If successful, Checker could retrofit GM components as developed on a Checker-built body and would not have to rely on the Citation body.

The new taxicabs were designed as a line of front-wheel-drive hatchbacks with varying wheelbases of wheelbases. The target weight was , a reduction of approximately 30% compared to the A11/A12, but for durability, the taxicab would be built as a body on frame. It was intended to use a Chevrolet 173 cu.in. (2.8L) V-6 engine. Fisher Body was also involved in the Galva project. Plans were made for Fisher to supply various body components: door locks, windows regulators, door hinges and door handles.

Consistent with the original Galva 1974 project, the new Checker would be based on limited tooling. Paul E. Newman of Autodynamics was quoted in &quot;Automobiles Quarterly&quot;: &quot;We had a particular build concept for them (Checker). It involved a low cost tooling and break form panels&quot;. Howard E. Klausmeier of Autodynamics was quoted in &quot;Automotive News&quot;: &quot;The intent is to standardize componentry and simplify tooling and manufacturing as much as possible. The only curved glass will be the windshield. All other glass is flat. In addition, the components provide easy replacement for repair and maintenance using simplified attachment systems.&quot;

In November 1981, Sab Hori describes more details of the new Checker for automotive writer John Melrose: &quot;We&#x27;re going to try and do everything we can to make the cab easy to service ... We&#x27;ll have bolt-on fenders, possibly of plastic, and we’re considering bolt-on door panels made from either RIM (reinforced injection molding) or SMC (sheet molding compound) plastic because if a panel is damaged it would be easier to replace. The fenders will be friendly, flexible type, like those on Oldsmobile&#x27;s new sport Omega. We&#x27;re also thinking about plastic hoods, rear hatch doors and facias because the tooling costs are lower. As a low-volume producer, we have the advantage of not worrying about the slow cycle times needed in making plastic parts. And what we&#x27;re trying to do is go as far as possible with proven technology. Checker is so small that we can’t afford to be the leaders; we’ve got to be followers.&quot;

The new Checker would have a fully independent rear suspension. The design was based on a Firestone-developed system called the Marsh Mellow, a fabric reinforced rubber cylinder. A striking solution for Checker, the Marsh Mellow spring was known for reliability, corrosion resistance, low cost, and basic simplicity. Best of all from Checker&#x27;s point of view, unlike a conventional rear leaf spring, if a Marsh Mellow spring fails, the cab would not have been taken off the road immediately. This feature would endear it to taxi fleets. Surely it could handle the pot -holed streets of New York City.

At the time of design, Head of CMC Engineering Sab Hori was quoted in Automotive News, “The New Generation of taxicab design will be a four door hatchback designed with identical bumpers, glass, lighting, engines, transmissions, and front/rear end styling. All four models will have surround-type frames, extended for longer vehicles”, indicating like CMC models of the past, several variation of wheelbase and configurations would be available.

David Markin was also quoted in Automotive News, stating that “[t]he new vehicle will be sold to both fleet operators and private individuals.&quot; Plans called for three different wheelbases: for six passengers, for eight passengers, and for seating nine and a raised-roof paratransit vehicle with wheelchair capabilities.

Ultimately, the project was killed. Balancing the required investment in the new Checker compared to making similar investments in the third party production business, Checker opted out of automobile production.

<doc id="1018399" wikidata="Q6346844" url="?curid=1018399" title="Kaharingan">
<text>Kaharingan is an indigenous monotheistic folk religion of the Dayak people such as Katingan, Lawangan, Ma&#x27;anyan, Ngaju, Ot Danum people native to the Central Kalimantan and South Kalimantan region in Indonesia.

The word means something like &quot;Way of the life&quot;, and this belief system includes a concept of many deities and often one supreme deity—although this may be the result of the need to conform to the idea of &quot;One Supreme God&quot; (&quot;Ketuhanan yang Maha Esa&quot;), which is the first principle of the Indonesian state ideology Pancasila. The influence of Hinduism can also be seen in this religion. Before 2017, the Indonesian government viewed it as a form of Folk Hinduism because the Indonesian government at that time recognized only six official religions, and Kaharingan was not one of them. However, since November 2017, the government started to formally recognize Aliran Kepercayaan, a broadly defined group of native religions which also includes Kaharingan.

The main festival of Kaharingan is the &quot;Tiwah&quot; festival, which lasts for thirty days, and involves the sacrifice of many animals like buffaloes, cows, pigs and chickens, as offerings to the spirits and deities.

The religion has ritual offerings called &quot;Yadnya&quot;, places of worship called &quot;Balai Basarah&quot; or &quot;Balai Kaharingan&quot; and a holy book called Panaturan, &quot;Talatah Basarah&quot; (group of prayers) and &quot;Tawar&quot; (a guide to seek God&#x27;s help by giving rice). Ancestor worship and the belief in many supernatural beings is common.

== Overview ==
&quot;Kaharingan&quot; comes from the Old Dayak word &quot;haring&quot; meaning &quot;life&quot; or &quot;alive&quot;. This concept is expressed in the symbol of the faith depicting a kind of &quot;Tree of Life&quot; called Batang Garing. This Tree of Life somewhat resembles a spear that has three branches on either side, some facing up and some down. At the bottom of the symbol are two receptacles, while at the very top are a hornbill and the sun.

The spear and its branches denote the upper world and the afterlife (spirit world), while the lower receptacles convey the idea of man&#x27;s earthly life. Although both the spiritual world and the earthly world are different, but they are closely connected to one another and are inseparable since they are both interdependent. The branches, where some face up while others face down, mean that there is an eternal balance between the earthly and the afterlife. That life on earth is temporary, and that human life is designed for the hereafter.

Altogether the Tree of Life expresses the core of the Kaharingan faith, which is that human life must be balanced and kept in harmony between man and spirits and between man and his natural environment. This is also the basic concept of Balinese Hinduism, which in Bali is known as the Tri Hita Karana.

In practice the Ngaju Dayaks focus on the supernatural world of spirits, including ancestral spirit. For them, the secondary funeral is most important, usually held after several months or even years after burial. During the second funeral rites (known as &quot;tiwah&quot;) the bones are exhumed and cleansed then placed in a special mausoleum, called &quot;sandung&quot;. The spirit of the deceased is then believed to watch over the village. The mausoleums are often beautifully decorated, showing scenes of the upper world. An ornate ship of the dead made of rubber is usually placed next to the remains depicting his entourage that accompany the soul to paradise.

One of the most outstanding features of the Dayak faith is their local wisdom and innate concern to preserve the forest and the natural environment. There are strict rules and directives on how to treat the rain forests, what may be done or taken from the forests and what are taboo. The Dayaks’ local wisdom directs that trespassing these rules will destroy the balance of the forest and animals living in the forest, and so directly or indirectly will adversely damage communities living from the forest bounty.

== Recognition by the Indonesian government ==

Among the many tribes of Dayaks in Borneo, those living in the upper reaches of the rivers in the province of Central Kalimantan are the Dayak Ngaju, the Lawangan, the Ma&#x27;anyan and the Ot Danum, known as the Barito Dayaks, named after the large Barito river. The Ngaju, who inhabit the Kahayan river basin by the present city of Palangkaraya, are involved in agricultural commerce, planting rice, cloves, coffee, palm oil, pepper and cocoa, whilst, the other tribes still mostly practice subsistence farming through the slash-and-burn lifestyle. The Dayak Ngaju were more open to technological and cultural influences from the outside than most other Dayak ethnic groups, even during precolonial times. With the arrival of the Dutch and – in 1835 – the missionary Rheinische Mission (later followed up by the Basel Mission), many converted to Christianity. The missionaries founded schools and increased the literacy rate. Education stimulated a &#x27;national awakening&#x27; among the Ngaju and Ma&#x27;anyan Dayak.

Already long before the Second World War, the Dayak founded nationalistic political parties. During the Indonesian battle for independence against the Dutch, the Dayak from the Kalimantan region fought under Major Tjilik Riwut, a parachutist from the Ngaju Dayak who practiced the traditional religion. After the proclamation of independence, Jakarta decided that the Islamic Banjarmasin and mostly Dayak area west of it, should be one province. The plan got some resistances from the Dayak – the Ngaju in front – which demanded a sole province. Under Riwut, which had become big during the revolution, the Dayak began small guerrillas. The Indonesian army limited escalation of the conflict, probably because Riwut had been a loyal soldier. In 1957, the province of Kalimantan Tengah (&quot;Central Kalimantan&quot;) or &#x27;Kalteng&#x27; was officially established by a Presidential Decree. The local government was led by the Ngaju with Rawit as governor. The traditional religions of the Ngaju, Ot Danum, Ma&#x27;anyan and other Dayak was named Kaharingan (&quot;power of life&quot; or &quot;way of life&quot;).

After the Communist Party of Indonesia was declared illegal in the 1960s, the subject &#x27;religion&#x27; became very sensitive. The state ideology that time defined a religion as a belief in one God which exclusively recognized only five religions (Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism and Buddhism). The Dayak were seen as &#x27;atheists&#x27;, whom were highly associated with the communist ideology. They had to pick between two options: conversion to a recognized religion voluntarily or being pressured by local authorities to do so. With this in mind; it is fairly clear why the missions with their schools and hospitals had more success after the 1960s in converting the Dayaks. Compared to the situations in the 17th and 18th century, Christianity in the 1960s offered more possibilities for social progresses than Islam did. Over time, the ban on local religions or aliran kepercayaan was abandoned. In 1980, Kaharingan was officially recognised as religion, but only as a part of the Hindu Dharma, so in fact it was placed under Hinduism. In Nov 2017, the government of Indonesia officially and formally recognizes aliran kepercayaan, which kaharingan was a part of.

There is a rising pride among the Dayak people to profess their belief in kaharingan and there has been a small but noteworthy rise among the believers of Kaharingan and other animistic traditions.

== Carnival in the jungle ==

In the religion of the Ngaju, the supernatural world is important, in which the souls of their ancestors live. Just like among other Dayak ethnic groups, the Ngaju performs re-burial rituals, which usually takes place several months (sometimes years) after the first burial. These re-burial rituals are very important for the souls of the deceased, so they can reach the highest point of heaven. By practicing these rites, they protect themselves against bad supernatural powers. The first funeral takes place just after someone died. During this ritual, masked dancers protect the deceased against bad spirits. Guided by drums, the kaharingan-priests start singing a song that can send the soul to heaven. On its journey on a traditional ship of souls, the soul accompanied by spirits. Once reaching the first layer of heaven, the soul has to wait there until the re-burial takes place.

During this re-burial ritual (tiwah), the remains of the deceased are excavated, cleaned and stored in a special grave. These ornate, wood-carved graves often have take a shape of a bird or a water snake, sometimes also depict the images of the afterlife. Recently, these wood-carved graves have been replaced by factory-made sandungs. The tiwah is a big, complex and long event. The costs vary between US$6,000 to US$12,000. The high cost is due to the requirement to sacrifice a large number of animals such as water buffaloes and pigs. It is common that several families cooperate to organize a tiwah together, so they can divide the cost among them. Once there was a record of more than 200 souls brought to a higher layer of heaven in one ceremony. Tiwahs are generally seen as a fun gathering. In the open air, food stalls put up their tents. Sometimes at a certain distance, revelers set up gambling rings. Tiwahs are like carnivals in the jungle.

== Adaptions ==

Sandungs are tombs made out of concrete to replace the wood-carved tombs for burial in the Kaharingan religion. To keep the religion recognized by the government, a council was set up to oversee the theological and ritual activities of the 330,000 adherents. None of the 78 basir upu (famous experts about the rituals) and 300 kaharingan priests make it to the council. The council decides many aspects about religion practices in Indonesia. It also organizes weekly meetings in specially-built kaharingan communal spaces with sermons and prayers. Furthermore, the council takes a registration and coordinates the tiwah schedules (two to ten every year) and process a permit from the police.

Since early times, the Iban believed that gamecocks are controlled by supernatural spirits which can turn them into human warriors. The cock fight represents &quot;intangible qualities of human nature, spiritual fulfillment and religious refinement&quot;

Shamanic healing or &quot;balian&quot; is one of the core features of Kaharingan ritual practices. These healing practices are often performed after the loss of a soul resulting from some kind of illness. However, the focus of this practice is on the body. Sickness comes when the patient upsets one of the spirits inhabiting the earth, usually by failing to prepare sacrifices for them. The goal of the &quot;balian&quot; is to call back the wayward soul and restore the health of the patient through trance dances and spirit possessions.

<text>The Yellow Cab Company was a taxicab company in Chicago which was co-founded as the Walden W. Shaw Livery Company in 1907 by Walden W. Shaw and John D. Hertz. The Yellow Cab Company&#x27;s rapid growth in the late 1910s and 1920s innovated a new kind of taxi company, one which covered the entire city limits, promising a cab to any address in ten minutes or less. In establishing its service, the Yellow Cab Company developed many of the procedures and safety protocols that would be adopted by taxi companies around the country. The company&#x27;s meteoric success also invited bitter competition on the city&#x27;s streets, leading to a period known as the &quot;Taxi Wars.&quot; During the Depression, Morris Markin, owner of Yellow Cab&#x27;s rival Checker Cab Mfg. Company, significantly consolidated ownership of the city&#x27;s taxi companies, putting an end to the violence. Yellow Cabs remain on the city&#x27;s streets today, though ownership was split between multiple companies upon its declaration of bankruptcy in 2015. 

== Beginning of Chicago&#x27;s Yellow Cab Company ==
On Aug. 2, 1915, the first 45 Yellow Cabs appeared on the streets of Chicago. These cabs differed from earlier Walden W. Shaw livery vehicles in that they were purpose-built as taxis and painted yellow for maximum visibility. Shaw and Hertz designed the Yellow Cabs themselves to be tough and lightweight, to improve fuel efficiency and reduce operating costs. Unlike Walden W. Shaw Livery vehicles, which operated on an account-based system of payment, Yellow Cabs could be hailed directly on the street or by calling the main garage dispatch center, and payment was taken in cash at the conclusion of each ride.

== Yellow Cab Manufacturing Company ==
In 1916, Shaw and Hertz formed the Walden W. Shaw Manufacturing Company to manufacture Yellow Cab taxicabs. In 1920, when Walden W. Shaw retired from the company, the name was changed to the Yellow Cab Manufacturing Company. The company produced all of the Yellow Cabs in Chicago&#x27;s fleet, and sold cabs to other Yellow Cab franchises and taxi companies around the world. In 1925, General Motors acquired the Yellow Cab Manufacturing branch of the business and renamed it Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing. As part of the deal, Hertz joined General Motors as the president of its Board of Directors.

== Acquisition of Parmelee ==
In 1917, Shaw and Hertz acquired the taxi division of the Parmelee Transfer Company. Charles McCulloch, the manager of that division, continued in that role at Yellow Cab and joined the Board of Directors of the Walden W. Shaw Corporation. After acquiring Parmelee&#x27;s taxi division, Yellow Cab retired their cars and replaced them with 200 Yellow Cabs on the city&#x27;s streets. 

== Taxi wars ==
During the 1910s and 1920s the company was involved in multiple incidents of intimidation, harassment and violence with taxi drivers from other companies. In 1921, a Yellow Cab driver named Thomas A. Skirven, Jr. was shot and killed while standing outside a Yellow Cab garage. Two Checker Taxi drivers were eventually convicted of his murder. This began a period of particularly bitter relations between Yellow Cab and Checker Taxi which led to shootings, targeted murders and firebombings. This period eventually led to the involvement in the taxi industry of mobsters associated with the Chicago Outfit and other powerful gangs during Prohibition.

By 1925 the company was a subsidiary of the Chicago Yellow Cab Company, a public holding company with shares equally divided between Hertz,and a small group of other investors. 

Hertz sold his remaining interest in the Yellow Cab Company in 1929 to Morris Markin, who had established Checker Cab Manufacturing Company as a driver cooperative with the Checker Taxi. Hertz had decided to focus on car rentals (later Hertz Rent-a-Car which still uses a yellow logo). The sale was prompted by the violence associated with the business that culminated in 1928 in his racing stables being destroyed in a $200,000 fire in which 11 thoroughbred horses died.

From 1930 till 1982 Yellow Cab of Chicago sourced all of their taxicab fleet from Markin&#x27;s Checker Motors Corp. of Kalamazoo, Michigan. Holding a near monopoly of taxicab operations in Chicago, the majority of Chicago taxicabs were purpose built Checker Cabs spanning three generations.

Yellow Cab Co. was sold again in 1996 to Patton Corrigan, who in turn sold controlling interest in 2005 to Michael Levine, a third-generation taxicab operator from New York City. The Levine/Corrigan group purchased the Checker Taxi affiliation in Chicago, to reunite the two companies once again. In 2015, Yellow Cab of Chicago filed for bankruptcy. Yellow Cab Co eventually split into multiple companies nationwide bearing the Yellow Cab name. In January 2016, San Francisco&#x27;s Yellow Cab cooperative filed for bankruptcy protection.

Since the bankruptcy, many of the companies that continue to carry the Yellow Cab name have struggled to compete with rideshare services such as Uber and Lyft that have drivers use their own personal vehicles for services traditionally provided by Yellow Cab and generally have much lower fares than traditional taxicabs. In some cities such as Pittsburgh, Yellow Cab even changed their business model to match ridesharing services by using a smartphone app and converted their drivers from employees to independent contractors while still being able to hail a taxicab in the traditional sense.

<text>USS &quot;Ingraham&quot; (DD-111) was a built for the United States Navy during World War I.

==Description==
The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was an improved and faster version of the preceding . Two different designs were prepared to the same specification that mainly differed in the turbines and boilers used. The ships built to the Bethlehem Steel design, built in the Fore River and Union Iron Works shipyards, mostly used Yarrow boilers that deteriorated badly during service and were mostly scrapped during the 1930s. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a crew of 6 officers and 108 enlisted men.

Performance differed radically between the ships of the class, often due to poor workmanship. The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was powered by two steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of intended to reach a speed of . The ships carried of fuel oil which was intended gave them a range of at .

The ships were armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts and were fitted with two 1-pounder guns for anti-aircraft defense. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A &quot;Y-gun&quot; depth charge thrower was added to many ships.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Ingraham&quot;, named for Duncan Nathaniel Ingraham, was launched 4 July 1918 by the Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California; sponsored by Mrs. Alfred S. Gann; and commissioned 15 May 1919. &quot;Ingraham&quot; departed 20 May for her shakedown cruise, transiting the Panama Canal and arriving Newport, Rhode Island 6 June. After repairs in New York, she sailed for a European tour of duty. While visiting Ostend, Belgium 22 September, she carried the King and Queen of Belgium to Calais, France. The destroyer returned to San Diego 8 January 1920 via New York and the Canal Zone to begin conversion to a minelayer.

Reclassified DM-9, &quot;Ingraham&quot; began minelaying exercises January 1921 along the California coast before departing Mare Island 7 June. She arrived at Pearl Harbor 18 June and engaged in operations there until she decommissioned at Pearl Harbor 29 June 1922. Her name was struck from the Navy List 1 December 1936 and she was sunk as target off Pearl Harbor on 23 July 1937.

<text>Orahov Do (Serbian Cyrillic: Орахов До) is a village in Ravno municipality Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was formerly part of the Trebinje municipality, up until the Bosnian War. It is only a few kilometers away from the border with Croatia on the road from the Adriatic coast to Popovo polje. It was the birthplace of Ragusan merchant Nikola Bošković, father of famed astronomer Ruđer Bošković.

==Name==
The literal translation of &quot;Orahov Do&quot; is &quot;Walnut Valley&quot;. Other variants include &quot;Orahovi Do&quot;, &quot;Orovi Do&quot;, and &quot;Orahovo&quot;. In Serbian Cyrillic, the name is written as &quot;Орахов До&quot;.

==History==
In a Dubrovnik court file from 1284 the village of Orahov Do is mentioned with the name Orahovec(Oraxouech).
The village is mentioned in Ragusan documents dating to July 1405 (as &quot;Horachindol&quot;), 1408 (as &quot;Orachouo dol&quot;) and 1414 (as &quot;Oracouodol&quot;). The 1405 document mentions Novak Grgurić as a subject of &quot;vojvoda&quot; Sandalj Hranić. The 1408 document mentions nobleman Pokrajac Novaković&#x27;s granting his subject, Novak Grgurić, from Orahov Do to settle with his family in the Ston region. The 1414 document mentions Radonja Pripković from the village. During the Middle Ages the region was part of the &quot;župa&quot; (county) of Popovo. In 1475 the village was called Rahov Do and was inhabited by 23 families. The village was burned by the Ottomans in 1687. In 1692 during the mass Don Ilija Bošković uncle of Ruđer Bošković was killed by Uskoks. In 1624 the list of Fr. Blaz Gračanin states that the village contained 19 Catholic houses and about 100 Catholics, and In 1639 the list of Fr. Dominik Andrijasević village has 14 Catholic families. According to the Austro-Hungarian Census from 1879 Orahov Do there lived only Catholics.

During the Great Turkish War in 1689, Hajduks attacked Orahov Do, Nijev Do and Balenići on the order of &quot;serdar&quot; Nonković.

==Demographics==
The village is inhabited by a Croat majority and Serb minority. In the 1991 census, the village had 42 residents, including:
*38 (90.47%) Croats
*4 (9.52%) Serbs

According to the 2013 census, its population was 151, all Croats.

==Anthropology==
Surnames found in the village include Burum, Kristić, Đurinov, Čupović, Bjelanov, Delić, Zurević, Cajin, Pirijač, Kićunov, and others.

According to Serbian sources, the Bošković brotherhood (ancestors of Roger Joseph Boscovich), originally surnamed Pokrajčić, had settled the village from the surrounding mountains. Branches of the brotherhood also settled the surroundings of Stolac.

==Notable people==
*Dominik Andrijašević (1572–1639), Ragusan Franciscan bishop
*Benedikt Orsini (fl. 1629–1637), Ragusan Franciscan bishop
*Nikola Bošković (1642–1721), Ragusan trader and father of Roger Joseph Boscovich
