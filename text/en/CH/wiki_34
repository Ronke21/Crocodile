<text>Halmstad () is a port, university, industrial and recreational city at the mouth of the Nissan river, in the province of Halland on the Swedish west coast. Halmstad is the seat of Halmstad Municipality and the capital of Halland County. The city had a population of 71,422 in 2020, out of a municipal total of over 100,000. Halmstad is Sweden&#x27;s 19th-largest city by population and located about midway between Gothenburg (the second most populous) and Malmö (the third). 

==History==
Halmstad, at the time part of the Kingdom of Denmark, received its first city charter in 1307, and the city celebrated its 700th anniversary in 2007. The oldest remains of that first town are to be found at &quot;Övraby&quot; upstream on Nissan, just south of and quite close to the present day regiment buildings. The remains of the church can still be seen today between a defunct brick industry and a former landfill.

In the 1320s the town moved to the present day town centre. At this time there were two monasteries in the town and during the 15th century the St. Nikolai church was built. Halland was the object of numerous battles, sieges and occupations by Swedish troops.

During the Kalmar Union, a Nordic Union between Sweden, Norway and Denmark which lasted between 1397 and 1523, it was in Halmstad that the Union King was to be finally selected.

At the end of the 16th century Christian IV of Denmark ordered the fortification of Halmstad and in the beginning of the 17th century to build a crescent-shaped fort with Nissan as part of the defences.

1619 is an important date in the history of Halmstad. In March of that year, King Gustav II Adolf of Sweden and Christian IV met at the castle. Over a period of a week they celebrated the payment in full of the Älvsborg ransom. August of the same year saw the destruction of Halmstad by fire.

Halland became part of Sweden for a period of thirty years when peace was declared at the Treaty of Brömsebro in 1645 and Danish rule ended. The Treaty of Roskilde in 1658 made this acquisition permanent. Sweden defeated Denmark in the Battle of Fyllebro which took place in 1676 just outside Halmstad. In 1678, a parliamentary meeting (Riksdag) was held in Halmstad.

The Riksdag decided in 1734 that the city&#x27;s fortifications would be demolished. Some residues of fortifications have been preserved, including one of the four city gates, Norre Port. For a period, the old fortifications were used for tobacco cultivation.

The city&#x27;s first major industry, Wallbergs Factory AB was built in 1823. The brewery Appeltofftska (now Krönleins) was founded in 1836 and brewery Östra Bryggeriet in 1846. AB Malcus Holmquist, also called Malcus, was formed in 1902. Nordiskafilt AB started in 1904 and Halmstads Järnverk in 1916. Lundgren&#x27;s foundry started in 1917 and Waco in 1918. 

A large rebuilding of Halmstad&#x27;s port was conducted in 1837–1840. The Halländska steamship company was formed in Halmstad in 1850 and started traffic between Gothenburg and Copenhagen, which was soon expanded with several connections. The first railway line, Halmstad—Värnamo, opened in 1877.

Halmstad was continually industrialized at the end of the 19th century. The city grew from 12,000 to 15,000 inhabitants during the 1890s. Every year, 1,000 people moved to Halmstad and 800—900 moved away.

Halmstad&#x27;s first union was formed in 1885 by tailor workers. The first May Day demonstration in Sweden was held in Halmstad in 1897.

After expanding in 1967, Halmstad become central town in 1971 in Halmstad&#x27;s municipality. The population grew from 48,800 in 1990 to 58,577 in 2010.

<text>Falkenberg is a locality and the seat of Falkenberg Municipality, Halland County, Sweden, with 27,813 inhabitants in 2019 (out of a municipal total of about 45,000). It is located at the mouth of river Ätran. The name consists of the Swedish words for falcon (&quot;falk&quot;) and mountain (&quot;berg&quot;). Falkenberg is a popular tourist destination in the summers, and the main beach of the town is Skrea strand.

== History ==
In the early part of the 13th century the Danish king built a fort on the east shore of the river Ätran, which eventually would give the town its name. Halland was at that time part of Denmark. It is known that falconry was pursued in the area. However, in Hallandia antiqua et hodierna, that specified a location (&quot;mountain&quot;) where the falconry should have taken place, and which should have given name to the town, has later been shown to be incorrect.
The area north of Ätran was from time to time Norwegian or Swedish. It was on this side that a market town developed. At around 1300 a church was built. From the 14th century until the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War (1563—1570) a second town, &quot;Ny-Falkenberg&quot; (&quot;New Falkenberg&quot;) was located close to the town. The fort was destroyed by Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson&#x27;s troops in 1434. The town gained market rights at the latest in 1558.

Along with the rest of the Halland, Falkenberg was to be temporarily Swedish in accordance with the Treaty of Brömsebro (1645). The Treaty of Roskilde thirteen years later made the province permanently Swedish. For a long period it struggled to keep its privileges with regard to trade and jurisdiction from the Danish time. Also like the rest of the county, it only started to slowly industrialise in the late 19th century. The city of Falkenberg was transformed at the municipal reform in 1862 to a city municipality with smaller parts in surrounding country municipalities. In 1908, Herting was incorporated from Skrea Country Mommun, 1937 Arvidstorp from Stafsinge Country Commun and 1950 a small area from Vinberg&#x27;s country municipality. In 1971, Falkenberg&#x27;s city in Falkenberg&#x27;s municipality and the resort is since its central town in the municipality.

In the 20th century it has gained a reputation as a seaside resort.

== Communications ==
Falkenberg is located along a traditional trade route along the Swedish west coast, about northwest of Halmstad, and south of Gothenburg. These transport needs are currently catered by European route E6, which runs as a dual carriageway just outside the town, and the West Coast Railway Line. County road 150 and County road 154 connect to Torup and Svenljunga. Falkenberg railway operated from the 1890s to the 1950s. The town has seven bus routes.

==Areas of the town==
== Sport ==
The town hosts several teams at national level. The football team, Falkenbergs FF, has since the late 1980s established itself in the second division (currently Superettan). The table tennis team, Falkenbergs BTK, has won ten national championships, as well as one European championship. In the early 2000s, Falkenbergs VBK developed to become one of the best volleyball teams in the country and accordingly won the national championship 2007. BK Falkarna has played ten seasons in the top bowling league.

<text>Maxwell Dixon (born William Brewster Dixon III; March 4, 1966), known professionally as Grand Puba, is an Jamaican-American rapper and record producer, best known as a member of Brand Nubian from New Rochelle, New York. He was formerly a member of Masters of Ceremony.

==Early life==
Puba was born on March 4, 1966 in New Rochelle, New York. During the late 1970s, Puba first got into hip hop after purchasing cassettes of his favorite artists such as The Cold Crush Brothers, T-Connection and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. Puba attended the Remington Boys Club in New Rochelle. While at his club for boys, a DJ by the name of Grand Mixer DXT would send out cassette tapes at his club, to where Puba would learn to rap and write rhymes. His first cousin by the name of Dr. Who (Tod Dixon), that would later form a group with Puba as Masters of Ceremony, would bang on tables, spitting rhymes with each other. Puba himself was also a breakdancer. He began making beats on cassettes of his own, around in New Rochelle where he grew up. When he was finally known, he started DJing at clubs after his popularity grew. His first rap group was called the &quot;Tray-Bag MC&#x27;s&quot;.

== Career ==
He made his debut as Grand Puba Maxwell with the group Masters of Ceremony in 1985. It&#x27;s album &quot;Dynamite&quot; (1988) was hailed by critics, but because of lack of sales the group soon disbanded and Puba became the lead emcee of Brand Nubian after working out a deal with A&amp;R Dante Ross and signing to Elektra Records. After their debut album &quot;One for All&quot; (1990) — covering areas from reggae-influenced hip hop music to new jack swing — Puba left the group after disputes and began a solo career. He released his first solo album &quot;Reel to Reel&quot; on Elektra Records in 1992, alongside DJ Stud Doogie and DJ Alamo who was previously a member with Brand Nubian. In 1992 Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs tapped Grand Puba to collaborate with up &amp; coming R&amp;B singer Mary J. Blige on her debut album &quot;What&#x27;s the 411&quot; The title song in which Puba co-wrote was the first time Blige incorporated her own rap technique which proved to be very successful. This was a rap/r&amp;b hit record that went to number one on the R&amp;B charts in the early spring of 1993. He released his second album &quot;2000&quot; in 1995. Around 1997 he rejoined the group, recording a few tracks for various soundtracks leading up to the full-length album &quot;Foundation&quot; in 1998. Puba&#x27;s states in an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, saying &quot;I never did go, i just wanted that experience and it was a good thing&quot;. In 1999, Grand Puba and Sadat X performed on the track &quot;Once Again&quot; on Handsome Boy Modeling School&#x27;s concept album &quot;So... How&#x27;s Your Girl?&quot;. After following Brand Nubian&#x27;s 2004 record &quot;Fire in the Hole&quot;, Grand Puba appeared on tracks with Beanie Sigel (&quot;Bread and Butter&quot;, also featuring groupmate Sadat X), Missy Elliott (&quot;My Struggles&quot;, featuring his onetime collaborator Mary J. Blige), and Ugly Duckling (&quot;Something&#x27;s Going Down Tonight&quot;).

He released his third album &quot;Understand This&quot; in 2001 on Koch Records.

In 2009, Grand Puba released his fourth solo album, &quot;Retroactive&quot;, featuring production from Q-Tip, Large Professor, Kid Capri as well as fellow Brand Nubians. Puba also appeared on the heavy posse cut &quot;Fresh&quot; together with Cormega, KRS-One, Big Daddy Kane, DJ Red Alert and PMD.

In 2016, he released his fifth album &quot;Black from the Future&quot;.

==Personal life==

Puba&#x27;s son, Sonny Dixon, who goes by the name, &quot;Stunna Gang&quot; is also a rapper.

<doc id="1019340" wikidata="Q176163" url="?curid=1019340" title="August Cieszkowski">
<text>Count August Dołęga Cieszkowski (; ; 12 September 1814 – 12 March 1894) was a Polish philosopher, economist and social and political activist. His Hegelian philosophy influenced the young Karl Marx and action theorists.

==Biography==
Cieszkowski was born in Nowa Sucha, in the Duchy of Warsaw. He studied at the Jagiellonian University and in then, from 1832, at the University of Berlin where he became interested in Hegelianism through the lectures of Karl Ludwig Michelet, who became a lifelong friend. He gained his doctorate in philosophy from Heidelberg University in 1838. After his studies he travelled around Europe, visiting France, England and Italy before returning to Poland in 1840 and settling permanently in Wierzenica, near Poznań, in 1843.

Cieszkowski co-founded the Polish League (Liga Polska) in 1848. He was a member of the Prussian National Assembly (1848–1855) and a political activist. He (unsuccessfully) endeavoured to start a university in Poznań and co-founded the Poznań Society of Friends of Arts and Sciences (PTPN) in 1857, being elected to its presidency three times (1857–1858, 1861–1868, 1885). It was the most important cultural and scientific society in Poland until the creation of Kraków&#x27;s Academy of Learning (Akademia Umiejętności) in 1871–73. In 1870 he founded the Halina School of Agriculture in Żabikowo, named after his wife Halina, who had died in 1861. In 1873 it became affiliated to the Kraków Academy of Learning, established in 1872.

==Philosophical work==
Cieszkowski coined the term historiosophy in his 1838 work &quot;Prolegomena zur Historiosophie&quot; (&quot;Prolegomena to a Historiosophy&quot;), a revision of the Hegelian philosophy of history. He adopted a threefold division of human history from medieval millenarians such as Joachim of Fiore ( 1135 – 1202) and mixed it with Hegelian categories and concepts. He is arguably the creator of the &quot;philosophy of action&quot;.

* Cieszkowki&#x27;s &quot;first&quot; period of history was that of antiquity.
* The &quot;second&quot; period was the Christian era, which represented the birth of reflectiveness, a turning inwards and upwards from natural sensual immediacy toward the universal and abstract. The spirit existed &quot;for itself&quot; (&quot;für sich&quot;). This period was marked by an intolerable duality between the opposed worlds of the God and temporal existence, spirit and matter, action and thought. The Hegelian philosophy of spirit, thought and universality at the expense of will, matter and particularly the (Hegelian) spirit had not yet experienced the division of mind and body and living in a primal pre-reflective unity with nature, mainly expressing itself through art. The spirit was &quot;in itself&quot; (&quot;an sich&quot;) in Hegelian jargon. The existence represented the apotheosis and supreme manifestation of this period of history.
* The &quot;third&quot; period of history was the &quot;post-Hegelian&quot; era in which the dualisms of the last were overcome and superseded. The one-sided emphasis on thought in the Christian era would be overcome and the spirit would assimilate nature to itself as well. Thus philosophy would come to an end as the synthesising and self-actualising activity of the spirit now took the form of creative practical activity. This final stage of the development of spirit represents the ultimate synthesis of opposites: God and world, necessity and freedom, desire and duty, Heaven and Earth are all as one.

Cieszkowski&#x27;s later works, &quot;Gott und Paligenesie&quot; (&quot;God and Palingenesis&quot;) (1842) and &quot;Ojcze Nasz&quot; (&quot;Our Father&quot;, 1848–1906, four volumes), reformulate his triad in much more explicitly religious terms. The three eras are expressed as those of God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. He stresses the role of the Catholic Church and accords a significant world-transforming role to the Slavs (a common theme in the Messianistic philosophy current in Poland at the time) in the process through which the Holy Spirit would emerge.

Cieszkowski&#x27;s belief in a personal God, it has been argued, disqualifies him as one of the Left Hegelians, differentiated from Hegel&#x27;s more orthodox followers by their generally critical attitude to religion and Christianity. The Left certainly did not count him as one of their own, even though some of its members soon took up the idea of the unity of philosophy of action. On the other hand, Cieszkowski did incorporate an elaborate system of social reforms into his philosophy and was strongly influenced by the French socialist tradition, which was often overtly religious, and thus did not share the characteristic political conservatism of the &quot;Right Hegelians&quot;.

==Legacy==

Cieszkowski exerted a significant (and reciprocated) influence on Polish Romantic poet, playwright and Gothic novelist Zygmunt Krasiński, whom he met in Milan in 1839 and became close friends with (Józef Kallenbach published (in Polish) two volumes of their correspondence in 1912). He also influenced the poet Cyprian Norwid, philosopher Bronisław Trentowski and philosopher, art historian and proto-psychologist Józef Kremer. He is arguably the creator of the &quot;philosophy of action.&quot; His most important philosophical legacy is probably his influence on the young Karl Marx, via German communist and Young Hegelian Moses Hess. The latter adopted Cieszkowski&#x27;s idea of that the dualism between consciousness and action would collapse in the latter part of the history of humanity, though he believed the synthesis had occurred on various occasions throughout history and located the transition to the &#x27;third age&#x27; at the Reformation instead of the philosophy of Hegel. Scholars David McLellan and Shlomo Avineri argue that Marx, who was a friend of and collaborator with Hess from a few years from 1841 onwards, owes various aspects of his thought on alienation and the nature of and transition to communist society to Cieszkowski, including that the dualism between consciousness and action would collapse in revolutionary &quot;praxis&quot;. (Cieszkowski was one of the earliest philosophers to use the term &quot;praxis&quot; as meaning &quot;action oriented towards changing society&quot; in his &quot;Prolegomena zur Historiosophie&quot;).

The University of Life Sciences in Poznań was named the August Cieszkowski Agricultural University of Poznań from 1996 until 11 April 2008, when it gained official university status, in recognition of Cieszkowski&#x27;s contributions to agricultural science and education in the region.

<doc id="1019343" wikidata="Q705413" url="?curid=1019343" title="Maxi Priest">
<text>Max Alfred Elliott (born 10 June 1961), known by his stage name Maxi Priest, is a British reggae vocalist of Jamaican descent. He is best known for singing reggae music with an R&amp;B influence, otherwise known as reggae fusion. He was one of the first international artists to have success in this genre, and one of the most successful reggae fusion acts of all time.

==Early life==
Maxi Priest was born in Lewisham, London, the second youngest of nine siblings. His parents had moved to England from Jamaica to provide more opportunity for their family and he grew up listening to gospel, reggae, R&amp;B, funk and soul music. He first learned to sing in church, encouraged by his mother, who was a Pentecostal missionary.

Priest grew up listening to Jamaican artists such as Dennis Brown, Burning Spear, Coxsone Dodd&#x27;s Studio One, John Holt, Ken Boothe, Beres Hammond and Gregory Isaacs as well as singers like Marvin Gaye, Al Green, Cat Stevens, Steve Winwood, the Beatles, Phil Collins and Frank Sinatra.

As a teenager, he lifted speaker boxes for the Jah Shaka and Negus Negast sound-systems. He was a founder member of Saxon Studio International, and it was with Saxon that Maxi began performing at neighbourhood youth clubs and house parties.

His music is sometimes influenced by R&amp;B, which he blends with reggae. Priest lost his cousin Jacob Miller in a car crash on 23 March 1980. Miller was the frontman in the popular reggae group Inner Circle, as well as a reggae icon who had worked with King Tubby and Augustus Pablo.

Two of Priest&#x27;s sons are also singers; Marvin Priest (born Marvin Cornell Elliott) and Ryan Elliott, who was in the 1990s boy band, Ultimate Kaos.

==Career==
Priest&#x27;s musical career began with him singing on the South London reggae soundsystem Saxon Studio International, after which some independent single releases followed, such as his groundbreaking release with conscious dancehall toaster Papa Levi, &quot;Sensi&quot;, backed by CAUTION and released on the Level Vibes label in a discomix vocal and dub style. Maxi Priest&#x27;s early discomix releases secured his reputation with both the dancehall and the concsious roots reggae sound system audiences. His first major album, &quot;Maxi&quot; (titled &quot;Maxi Priest&quot; in the US and Canada), was released in 1988, and, along with his cover of Cat Stevens&#x27; &quot;Wild World&quot; (which he recorded with Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare) established him as one of the top British reggae singers.

He is one of only two British reggae acts (along with UB40) to have an American &quot;Billboard&quot; number one: &quot;Close to You&quot; in 1990. A duet with Roberta Flack, &quot;Set the Night to Music&quot;, reached the American Top Ten in 1991. His duet with Shaggy in 1996, &quot;That Girl&quot;, was also a hit in the United States, peaking at number twenty.

In the latter half of his recording career, Priest favoured working alongside other artists, both established and up-and-coming. He has worked with Sly and Robbie, Drummie Zeb of Aswad, Shaggy, Beres Hammond, Jazzie B, Apache Indian, Roberta Flack, Shurwayne Winchester, Shabba Ranks, Robin Trower, and Lee Ritenour.

It was reported in some newspapers in the Birmingham area, including the &quot;Birmingham Mail&quot; on 13 March 2008, that Priest would be replacing Ali Campbell as the new lead singer of UB40, and that he had recorded a cover of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot; with the band, based on information from &quot;an unnamed source close to the band&quot;. Priest had joined UB40 on tour in 2007, culminating in sold-out shows at the National Exhibition Centre in Solihull in December. Another local newspaper, the &quot;Express &amp; Star&quot; that had reported that Priest would be the new UB40 frontman, included a statement from band spokesman Gerard Franklyn which contradicted the claim, stating: &quot;Maxi is collaborating with the band to record material but he won&#x27;t be the new lead singer, that will be Duncan Campbell, the brother of Ali and Robin Campbell. He will only be appearing with them for this new recording.&quot;

In 2012, Priest recorded a cover of Japanese band L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel&#x27;s song &quot;Vivid Colors&quot; for the band&#x27;s English-language tribute album.

In 2013, Priest recorded a remix version of the Hindi song &quot;&quot; originally sung by Arijit Singh. It was remixed by British Indian producer Rishi Rich.

His 2014 album &quot;Easy to Love&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Reggae Albums Chart at number two.

==Sport==
Priest played for non-League football club Southall, his son Marvin&#x27;s team, in March 2003 when they needed players to fulfil a fixture due to an injury crisis at the club. Southall lost 3–0 to Feltham.

<text>White Oak Lake State Park is a state park in the southwest of the U.S. state of Arkansas, a few miles from Bluff City. The reservoir sits surrounded by tall pine trees, giving it a rich, wooded beauty. The state park offers camping facilities, hiking and mountain biking trails, boat and bicycle rentals, as well as playground facilities.

Because White Oak Lake was created in a woodland area, the lake features many submerged dead trees. These serve as excellent cover for bass, crappie, and bream, all of which are reasonably abundant in the lake. Catfish also thrive at the lake.

The park features hiking trails of easy to moderate difficulty, of which the Beech Ridge and Silver Maples trails give a good understanding of the &quot;West Gulf Coastal Plain forest&quot; setting. Deer and heron sightings are common at the park, while some bald eagles winter there.

White Oak Lake is reasonably popular with local residents, but its location in a part of Arkansas with few tourists keeps it from undue crowding or traffic. White Oak Lake is near the Poison Springs Battleground State Park, a Civil War battlefield.

Completed in 1961, the lake is 19 miles southeast of Prescott, and 15 miles northwest of Camden, off State Highways 387 and 24. It is the second largest lake created by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, at .

<text>Indigenous churches are churches suited to local culture and led by local Christians. There have been two main Protestant strategies proposed for the creation of indigenous churches:

# Indigenization: Foreign missionaries create well-organized churches and then hand them over to local converts. The foreign mission is generally seen as a scaffolding which must be removed once the fellowship of believers is functioning properly. Missionaries provide teaching, pastoral care, sacraments, buildings, finance and authority, and train local converts to take over these responsibilities. Thus the church &quot;becomes&quot; indigenous. It &quot;becomes&quot; self-supporting, self-propagating and self-governing.
# Indigeneity: Foreign missionaries do not create churches, but simply help local converts develop their own spiritual gifts and leadership abilities and gradually develop their own churches. Missionaries provide teaching and pastoral care alone. The church is thus indigenous &quot;from the start&quot;. It &quot;has always been&quot; self-supporting, self-propagating and self-governing.

==Proponents==
===Nineteenth century===

Henry Venn (Anglican, Church Missionary Society) (1796–1873) and Rufus Anderson (Congregationalist, American Board) (1796–1880) simultaneously developed a strategy of Indigenization in response to the extreme paternalism exercised by western missionaries of the early 19th century, particularly in Asia. They perceived that &quot;rice&quot; Christians were completely dependent on missionaries and loyal to the church only as long as they were receiving free food. In exchange, missionaries expected complete loyalty from the &quot;natives&quot; and resisted giving up authority and control. The system was thought to foster an unhealthy parent–child relationship between the missionaries and national believers.

Anthony Norris Groves (1795–1853) attempted to avoid this problem in pioneer areas by guarding against any form of dependency from the start. He chose to represent no foreign denomination or missionary society, and he encouraged full co-operation between all Protestant missionaries for the encouragement of indigenous initiatives. He predated Roland Allen by eighty years as an advocate of Indigeneity rather than Indigenization. Looking directly to God for guidance and provision, he was a formative influence on Hudson Taylor and the &quot;faith mission&quot; movement, but the direct influence of his indigenous strategy is more evident in the remarkable movements associated with Bakht Singh in India and Watchman Nee in China. Nee, however, eschewed the label indigenous, saying that the organizing principle of a church was locality and not nationality, so that all believers in a given city were members of the church in that city regardless of national origin.
John Ross (1848-1915), a Scottish missionary to Manchuria, established indigenous churches along the lines of the three-self principles among those of Korean descent beginning from 1874.

John Livingstone Nevius (1829–1893) served as a Presbyterian missionary to the Shandong province in China and later in Korea in the late 1800s. After questioning the methods of western missionaries of his time, he wrote a book published in 1886, &quot;The Planting and Development of Missionary Churches&quot;, which called for discarding old-style missions and the adoption of his new plan to foster independent, self-supporting local churches. He criticized the missionaries&#x27; practice of paying national workers out of mission funds, believing the healthy local church should be able to support its own local workers.

Hudson Taylor (1832–1905) was a Protestant missionary from England to China and founder of the China Inland Mission. He became disillusioned with other Protestant missionaries in China that lived in compounds and employed indigenous people as servants. Taylor subsequently learned local dialects, adopted local dress, and went up and down rivers in China preaching. He sought to distance himself from any paternal organizations or denominations in favour of &quot;faith missions&quot; which relied on the support of nationals and individuals. He also sought to train indigenous leaders to lead churches and mission stations in China, rather than have them run by foreigners.

Dixon Edward Hoste (1861–1946) succeeded Hudson Taylor as director of the China Inland Mission. Hoste is credited with making the Chinese churches apply the three-self principle of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation. This threefold motto was later adopted by the Three-Self Patriotic Movement after missionaries were expelled from China.
===Twentieth century===

Roland Allen (1868–1947) also attempted to apply indigenous church principles to the missions of his day. After serving as an Anglican missionary in China from 1895 to 1903, he returned to England and spent 40 years writing about missions principles. Two of his books, &quot;Missionary Methods: St. Paul&#x27;s or Ours?&quot; (1912) and &quot;The Spontaneous Expansion of the Church: And Causes that Hinder It,&quot; are still in print.

Alice Luce (1873–1955), first an Anglican missionary in India, and subsequently an Assemblies of God missionary among Hispanics along the US–Mexico border, was influenced by Allen&#x27;s theory of missions and in 1921 she wrote a series of articles, &quot;Paul&#x27;s Missionary Methods&quot;, for the &quot;Pentecostal Evangel&quot;. Due to her advocacy, indigenous church principles became normative for Assemblies of God missions during the early part of the 20th century.

Nicolás Zamora (1875–1914) founded on 28 February 1909 the first Indigenous Evangelical Church in the Philippines. Behind the founding of the IEMELIF, nationalist and subsequent independence movements. Filipinos wanted full autonomy, including in the realm of religion, as the 333 years of Spanish rule were marked by the Catholic Church&#x27;s control over both temporal and spiritual affairs. His vision and motivation was faith in God&#x27;s providence, and belief that the Filipino was capable of erecting a self-sustaining, autonomous, and self-propagating evangelical church. In 1903, he was assigned to be a pastor at Knox Memorial Church becoming the first Filipino Protestant pastor. Zamora took up law at the University of Santo Tomas where he honed his skills in debate and oration, then entered a seminary in Shanghai.

Many speakers at the 1910 World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh emphasized indigenization of churches raised up by mission work, including the lone native Chinese attendee, Cheng Jingyi, who later became the general secretary of the National Christian Council of China and the first moderator of the Church of Christ in China.

John Wesley Haley (1878–1951), Free Methodist Church in Canada missionary to South Africa 1902–1909, 1917–1934, and Ruanda-Urundi 1934–1946. Haley left South Africa after several decades of ministry disillusioned with traditional mission practice and initiated new ministry in Burundi following the indigenous mission approach, involving Burundian converts in the leadership, decision-making process &quot;from the beginning&quot;. He felt a special kinship with the work of Nevius and Allen, despite limited understanding from his mission board.

Melvin Hodges (1909–1988), an Assemblies of God missionary to Nicaragua, again popularized the idea in the 1950s with his book, &quot;On the Mission Field: The Indigenous Church.&quot; He defined the indigenous church as &quot;a native church ... which shares the life of the country in which it is planted and finds itself ready to govern itself, support itself, and reproduce itself.&quot; Hodges believed that foreign money creates dependence and establishes paternalistic patterns within mission movements, leading to an unhealthy, anemic church. His experience as a missionary no doubt influenced his presentation of the three-self principle. He emphasized the need for flexibility and tailoring the principles to fit the need of the local believers.

In his book &quot;Transforming Mission&quot;, David Bosch (1929–1992), a Dutch Reformed Afrikaner missiologist, echoed Paul G. Hiebert&#x27;s suggestion that a &quot;fourth&quot; &quot;self&quot; needed to be added to the Venn–Anderson framework: &quot;self-theologizing&quot;. Though much self-theologizing had already taken place in mission churches, much of it has been left unnoticed or considered syncretistic. Bosch suggested that in order to not fall into the two extremes of syncretism or &quot;Babylonian captivity&quot;, self-theologizing must be in dialogue with the universal invisible church. Only then would a truly indigenous church exist.

<doc id="1019348" wikidata="Q711260" url="?curid=1019348" title="Shabba Ranks">
<text>Rexton Rawlston Fernando Gordon OD (born 17 January 1966), better known by his stage name Shabba Ranks, is a Jamaican dancehall musician. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he was one of the most popular Jamaican musicians in the world. Throughout his prominence in his home country as a dancehall artist, he gained popularity in North America with his studio album &quot;Just Reality&quot; in 1990. He released other studio albums, including &quot;As Raw as Ever&quot; and &quot;X-tra Naked&quot;, which both won a Grammy Award as Best Reggae Album in 1992 and 1993, respectively. He is notoriously popular for &quot;Mr. Loverman&quot; and &quot;Ting-A-Ling&quot;, which were globally acclaimed and deemed his signature songs.

==Early life==
Shabba Ranks was born in Sturge Town, Saint Ann, Jamaica, and raised in Seaview Gardens, Kingston. 

His father, Ivan Gordon, was a mason who died in 1990. His mother, Constance &quot;Mama Christie&quot; Christie, remained in Seaview after Shabba&#x27;s success, feeding the community with money sent from her son after his emigration. She was the subject of the 2015 hit song &quot;Shabba Madda Pot&quot; from the dancehall artist Dexta Daps.

==Career==
He gained his fame mainly by toasting (or rapping) rather than singing, like some of his dancehall contemporaries in Jamaica. He was a protégé of DJ Josey Wales. His original stage name was Co-Pilot. His international career started in the late 1980s, along with a number of fellow Jamaicans including reggae singers Cocoa Tea and Crystal. Ranks also worked with Chuck Berry and American rappers KRS-One and Chubb Rock.

He secured a recording contract with Epic Records in 1989.

The stylistic origins of the genre reggaeton can be traced back to the 1990 song &quot;Dem Bow&quot;, from Ranks&#x27; album &quot;Just Reality&quot;. Produced by Bobby &quot;Digital&quot; Dixon, the Dem Bow riddim became so popular in Puerto Rican freestyle sessions that early Puerto Rican reggaeton was simply known as &quot;Dembow&quot;. The Dem Bow riddim is an integral and inseparable part of reggaeton, so much so that it has become its defining characteristic.

His biggest hit single outside of Jamaica was the reggae fusion smash &quot;Mr. Loverman&quot;. Other big tracks include &quot;Housecall&quot; with Maxi Priest, &quot;Slow and Sexy&quot; with Johnny Gill, &quot;Respect&quot;, &quot;Pirates Anthem&quot;, &quot;Trailer Load a Girls&quot;, &quot;Wicked inna Bed&quot;, &quot;Caan Dun&quot;, and &quot;Ting A Ling&quot;. He won the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album in 1992 for &quot;As Raw as Ever&quot; and in 1993 for &quot;X-tra Naked&quot;.

In 1993, Ranks scored another hit in the &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; soundtrack to which he contributed a rap/reggae version of the Sly and the Family Stone hit &quot;Family Affair&quot;. His third album for Epic, &quot;A Mi Shabba&quot;, was released in 1995. He was dropped by the label in 1996. Epic went on to release a greatest hits album, entitled &quot;Shabba Ranks and Friends&quot; in 1999.

Ranks made a partial comeback in 2007 when he appeared on a song called &quot;Clear the Air&quot; by Busta Rhymes, which also featured Akon. Shabba released a single on Big Ship&#x27;s Pepper Riddim called &quot;None A Dem&quot;, in April 2011. In 2012, Shabba was featured on Tech N9ne&#x27;s EP &quot;E.B.A.H.&quot; on the track &quot;Boy Toy&quot;. In 2013, Shabba was also mentioned in A$AP Ferg&#x27;s song &quot;Shabba,&quot; and has a cameo near the end of the music video. He was featured in the remix alongside Migos and Busta Rhymes on 23 November 2013. In August 2013, he was reportedly working on a new album.

==Controversy==
Ranks has been controversial for homophobia, particularly violent attitudes towards homosexuals. The 1990 song &quot;Wicked Inna Bed&quot; includes lyrics about shooting gay men.

In 1992, during an appearance on Channel 4 music show &quot;The Word&quot;, he was asked to give his thoughts on the subject of the hit song, &quot;Boom Bye Bye&quot;, by Buju Banton. Shabba held a copy of a Bible which he carried with him and stated that the &quot;word of God&quot; advocated the &quot;crucifixion of homosexuals&quot;. He also alluded that he advocates the progression of the Jamaican people and freedom of speech but did not conclude that being against homosexuality would be in question of exclusion, according to bible laws. He was condemned for his comments by presenter Mark Lamarr, who said, &quot;That&#x27;s absolute crap and you know it.&quot; Following these comments, Ranks was dropped from a Bobby Brown concert as a performer and faced altercations with his label, Sony Music. Ranks subsequently apologized, after realizing that his comments might advocate &quot;the killing of gays and lesbians and any human being in retrospect&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ranks and his wife, Michelle, have two sons Rexton Jr and Jahwon. He currently resides in New York City.

<text>Erkrath () is a town in the district of Mettmann, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

==Geography==
Erkrath is situated on the river Düssel, directly east of Düsseldorf and west of Wuppertal, close to the famous Neandertal. It has two stations, Erkrath station, which is served by Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn line S 8, and Erkrath Nord station, which is served by S-Bahn line S 28, both at 20-minute intervals.

==History==
In that part of Neandertal, which is located in Erkrath, in the summer of 1856, quarry workers discovered the fossilised remains of what became known as the Neanderthal man or &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot; in Feldhof cave. The name Erkrath was first mentioned in 1148. Erkrath received town rights in 1966. In 1975, the municipality of Hochdahl was incorporated into Erkrath. As well its former borough Unterbach was incorporated into Düsseldorf. Only a part of Unterbach called Unterfeldhaus remained as now a borough of its own with Erkrath. Erkrath today has three local parts: Erkrath, Hochdahl and Unterfeldhaus.

<doc id="1019351" wikidata="Q7225387" url="?curid=1019351" title="Politics of the Empire of Brazil">
<text>Politics of the Empire of Brazil took place in a framework of a quasi-federal parliamentary representative democratic monarchy, whereby the Emperor of Brazil was the head of state and nominally head of government although the Prime Minister, called President of the Council of Ministers, was effectively the &quot;de facto&quot; head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power was exercised by the government. Legislative power was vested in both the government and the two chambers of the General Assembly (or Parliament). The Judiciary was independent of the Executive and the Legislative. There was also a fourth power, the Moderating power, exercised by the emperor. The Empire of Brazil was divided into 20 provinces and the Neutral Municipality, capital of the country.

== State structure ==
=== Monarchy ===
Upon gaining independence from Portugal in 1822, the Brazilian nation as a whole was almost entirely in favor of a monarchical form of government. There were a variety of reasons for this political choice. There was fear among various social groups of the possibility that Brazil would fall into the same political, social, and economic chaos experienced by most of the former Spanish American colonies: territorial dismemberment, coups, dictatorships and the rise of &quot;caudillos&quot;. The perceived necessity was for a political structure that would allow the Brazilian people not merely to enjoy the advantages of liberty, but also that would guarantee the country&#x27;s stability, in conformance with the liberalism of the time. Only a neutral entity, completely independent of parties, groups or opposing ideologies, could achieve this end. And there was &quot;always a powerful ideological element remaining from independence as the result of a great national union over particular interests.&quot; The Brazilian monarchy was &quot;a form of government that assured a Brazil that would include the whole of the old Portuguese dominion, in a climate of order, peace, and freedom.&quot; 

There was also another reason for adoption of the monarchy, or more precisely, its maintenance. The Europeans, as much as the Africans and the Native Americans, came from monarchical societies. To remain under this form of government was a way of maintaining the traditions and identity of the Brazilian people, a people descended from those three distinct ethnic groups. The choice of a member of the House of Braganza came not just from the historical moment, but also from the fact that Prince Pedro descended from the pure male line of the Portuguese kings. The House of Braganza originated with Afonso, 1st Duke of Braganza, an illegitimate son of John I of the House of Aviz who, in turn, was the son of Peter I of the House of Burgundy, which was founded 300 years earlier in 1143 by Afonso Henriques, the first king of Portugal. Thus, the strong popular appeal of the monarchy, and a tradition of more than three hundred years (or seven hundred if Portuguese history is considered), enabled Prince Pedro to take on the role of a symbol of national unity. The monarchical regime maintained on Brazilian soil &quot;was a force of continuity and tradition&quot;.

A third element in the choice of monarchy was the necessity to comply with the powers of the era, all located in Europe. The possibility of European countries seeking to dominate the young nation, strengthened the desire to prevent the adoption of the republican form at all costs and to avoid any territorial dismemberment into small republics, weak and in constant rivalry with one another. Given that other Latin American countries and also Portugal were becoming easy prey to European (mainly British) greed, maintaining the monarchy with a monarch of European origin acted as a deterrent and allowed Brazil to ensure the predominance of its international interests. And in fact, &quot;after the phase of the regency, turbulent but transitory by its very nature, the imperial order dominated from above, assuring internal peace and external prestige.&quot;

For the reasons cited above, Brazil chose a representative constitutional monarchical system. The imperial regime was based on the idea that sovereignty resided in the Nation, not the State, symbolically represented by the emperor. While the Nation wished to experience freedom and prosperity, the State, in turn, wanted &quot;permanence, duration and existence.&quot; In this form, the Constitution expressed in its text that both the Emperor and the General Assembly were representatives of the Brazilian nation. The monarch represented the constant, general interests of the nation as a whole, while the Assembly represented particular, ephemeral, momentary interests. However, the Emperor was not sovereign of the country; the sovereign was the Brazilian Nation, who delegated this role to the Emperor, as they did to the General Assembly.

===Parliamentary system===
A major difference between parliamentarism and presidentialism is that in the first, the Head of State and of the Government are distinct individuals, while in the second, both roles reside in a single individual. Under the Brazilian monarchy, nonetheless, the emperor was head of both the State and the Government. This basic characteristic of presidential republicanism was transplanted by the Brazilian Constitutional Order. The Constitution of 1824 was rather less parliamentary than the draft prepared by the Constituent Assembly. In fact, it was for all purposes a peculiar and unique regime: a presidential monarchy. That did not mean, by any means, that the Brazilian monarch had prerogatives resembling those of a tyrant or dictator. The individual guarantees that guarantee human liberty and dignity were inserted into the articles of the Charter and were respected. The Emperor would not act in areas reserved to the legislative branch and the judiciary, such as to create laws or to judge and sentence. Still, the creation of the Moderating Power () and natural evolution of Brazilian representative system enabled a transition from presidential to the parliamentary model, which &quot;would give the Empire a position of illustrious companion next to the British lion&quot; [the United Kingdom]. It was unnecessary to modify the letter of the law in order to transmute one system of government into another: the Constitution itself in its elasticity (in terms of legal interpretation of the Charter) enabled this.

The first step in the parliamentary institution occurred in 1824, with the award of the first Brazilian constitutional charter, allowing the General Assembly (Parliament) to take a leading role in policy guidance of the nation. The second step was in 1826 when a minority deputy Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos successfully demanded that the ministers of state had to present the government&#x27;s financial accounts before the Chamber of Deputies. The third step, the most important, was taken in 1847 when Francisco de Paula Souza demanded the creation of the office of the President of the Council of Ministers (equivalent to the prime minister, and holding executive power). These steps resulted in the consolidation of Brazilian parliamentarism, in the same manner as the consolidation of British parliamentarism, as it would facilitate the distinction between Executive Power and Moderating Power.

The Brazilian Parliament became increasingly important, as all the great political decisions took place there, providing occasion for memorable debates. By 1881, it was already a custom of the Ministers of State to present government financial accounts to the Parliament, make annual reports on their activities and attend to answer criticism by the Deputies and Senators. These acts allowed great freedom for parliamentary interplay. This did not pass without observation by foreigners. Surprising, Brazil was criticized for its broad freedom of speech and its &quot;exaggerated parliamentarism&quot; as it was called by the French ambassador Amelot, Count of Chaillou. In the view of foreigners, Brazilian parliamentarism was not behind its European equivalents. The Empire was &quot;from its outset a crowned democracy, in which the executive prevailed at first, and the legislative ended up predominating&quot;.

In the Imperial Parliament there were &quot;solid and competitive parties, an active parliament, a free press, open debate&quot;, traditions that the Old Republic did not maintain. Both the emperor and the ministers of state always sought to act with attention to Parliament, making a sincere effort to improve the country&#x27;s political system by adopting characteristics inherent in Parliamentarianism. For example: the definition of the cabinet&#x27;s governmental program was drafted by the President of the Council of Ministers, and was, in turn, presented by the monarch every year at the opening of the Chamber of Deputies. Another example was the emergence of the possibility that Parliament, when deemed necessary, would submit a motion of no confidence against the cabinet of ministers. This provided a mode of defense (used at exceptional moments) of the parliamentary minority against the cabinet formed by the majority, were they to act inappropriately.

===Federalism===

The imperial Constitution of 1824 made Brazil a highly centralized country, aiming to facilitate control by the central government over the provinces and thereby prevent eventual territorial dismemberment. Nonetheless, the local governments had some degree of autonomy, because municipal assemblies elected by the population had their own prerogatives. This framework changed with the approval of the 1834 Additional Act, which created the Provincial Assemblies to legislate on issues related to local administration. The Act also created an &quot;economic and local government&quot; that made possible to cities to &quot;neutralize in a certain way the absolute power exercised over the provinces by their presidents&quot;. A reversal occurred in this area due to the so-called Law of Interpretation of the Additional Act, approved in 1840, which restricted the autonomy gained by the 1834 Act. Historian Maria de Fatima Silva Gouvêa wrote of the view widely held among historians, regarding the non-existence of federalism in the Empire:

 Apart from some few studies published in recent years—in particular the work of Miriam Dohnikoff and Maria Fernanda Martins—very little has been produced on the subject, there remains a strong historiographical perception of the period as being marked by the existence of a monarchic State, centralized, instituted from the will and the dictates of a plantation and slaveocratic elite, over the will of the imperial Brazilian society as a whole.

Nonetheless, even after the revision of 1840, the Brazilian State retained certain characteristics of federalism, despite the fact that these were not foreseen in its founding in 1822. Because federalism was the main change proposed by the republicans and liberals in the 19th century, scholars of the subject give the impression that federalism did not exist under the monarchy. William H. Riker, one of the main theoreticians about federalism, considered that the Brazilian monarchy adopted a federalist model after the 1834 Additional Act. His view is that federalism would consist of a &quot;division of competencies between the general government and the regional governments.&quot; The principal characteristic of federation is the mutual existence of two autonomous levels of government, in this case central and regional. This was reality during the monarchy, which would be considered a &quot;de facto&quot; federation were it not for the fact that the presidents of the provinces (equivalent to the current governors of states) were appointed by the Emperor and the Senators had a lifelong tenure. Prussian officer Max von Versen, who visited Brazil in 1867, wrote that the Emperor &quot;shares the sovereignty with a Senate and a Chamber of Deputies [House of Representatives] that are assemblies elected by universal suffrage. In fact, the Crown does have only the ability to execute decisions of the Legislative. It is so great the administrative autonomy of the provinces, so predominant is the function of the Parliament as it is small the sphere of political attributions of the Emperor&quot;. Mirian Dohnikoff concluded that:

The constitutional division of competencies between provincial governments and the central government, guaranteeing the autonomy of the former, which could not be unilaterally revoked by the central government; the capacity of the provincial governments to make decisions autonomously about matters relative to taxation, the police force, public works, jobs, etc.; the constant negotiation between provinces and the center in parliament to reduce tensions and confrontations between divergent interpretations about the sphere of the competence of each; the attribution of the central government to respond to national unity, provided the tools necessary for both; and its coexistence with autonomous provincial governments, which accounted for strategic regional issues, were federalist factors that prevailed in nineteenth century Brazil. The defeat in the negotiations of reforms in 1832, which resulted in the maintenance of the lifelong character () of membership in the Senate, and the fact of the president of the province being appointed by the central government prevented the full adoption of a federal model. On the other hand, as I have tried to demonstrate, the [centrally appointed] president had limited powers, of a type that did not constitute an obstacle to the exercise of provincial autonomy. The president did not have the power to present legislative projects, and the right to veto laws approved by the Assembly was only one of suspension. It could be exercised for a limited time, only ten days, and returned then to the same Assembly that approved the law, where it could be overruled by two-thirds of the legislators.

Thus, it remained to the monarchic government to abolish the lifelong character of membership in the Senate and to allow the choice of presidents of the provinces by popular vote, to achieve federalism. Such changes would occur in 1889, when the Viscount of Ouro Preto, President of the last Council of Ministers of the monarchy, presented his government proposals to the General Assembly. But, owing to the coup d&#x27;état that installed the republic, these plans never came to fruition.

==Government of the Empire of Brazil==
===Moderating branch===

====Emperor&#x27;s role====

The role of the emperor of Brazil was to represent the nation. He represented that which the nation had &quot;of oneness, of permanence, of stability. He represented the legal order, the unity of all Brazilians, as well as the variations of region, class, party, race, represented the nation in its totality.&quot; The monarch was in reality a type of &quot;minister of a republic&quot;, in the philosophical sense of that last word, from &quot;res publica&quot;, and not a sovereign by divine right. His function as a representative of the nation, of its legitimacy, derived not from being elected, but acclaimed, as had traditionally happened for centuries after the death of the previous monarch in homage to his successor. Acclamation was a popular designation that legitimated the role of the monarchy as representative of the Brazilian people. This in fact occurred at three distinct historic moments during the monarchical era: in 1822, when Pedro I was acclaimed, in 1831 and finally in 1840, when it was the turn of Pedro II be acclaimed in all the provinces. Acclamation was, in a certain way, a type of symbolic vote, equivalent to an informal plebiscite. It was popular acceptance that granted the legitimacy to Brazilian monarchs as representatives of the Nation.

Following the standard dictated by liberalism of the nineteenth century, the Constitution of 1824 granted the monarchy protection under a representative system and protected by the most important, innovative and original item in the constitutional text: the Moderating Power (). This fourth power was personal to the Emperor, acting as a &quot;mechanism to absorb friction between the legislative and executive powers&quot; and his role as the one who would maintain the balance between both powers would allow Pedro II throughout his reign the &quot;worthy position that he exercised with so much pleasure and peace.&quot;
Tobias Barreto has analyzed the Moderating Power and the parliamentary government, explained as the reason for its adoption both the fact that &quot;institutions that are not the daughters of custom, but only the product of theories, do not hold themselves for much longer against reality and they will soon ruin themselves when faced by facts.&quot; It would not matter if there were laws that would follow the customs and traditions of other nations (other than the Brazilians) that would be admirable in theory, but in practice, would become counterproductive to the point of creating cracks that over time would collapse the edifice of the country&#x27;s constitutional order. Thus, thanks to the Moderating Power, Brazil was able to &quot;open a valve through which parliamentary anarchy could escape&quot;, in other words, it would minimize eventual damage caused by disputes between rival political factions.

According to the idea behind the Moderating Power was &quot;that a monarch, by virtue of dynastic continuity, took no part in factions, classes, had no regional links, did not owe his power to economic groups, did not have to fulfill electoral promises, did not need to think of his own future — the future of his family was guaranteed by the preservation of peace and national greatness — he was not subject to the temptation of taking advantage of a brief passage through the government to grant benefits and advantages for himself only at the cost of the nation´s welfare and leaving the onus to his successors&quot; as he knows that his &quot;successor will be his own son, knowing that history, many times, charges grandchildren with the crimes of their grandparents&quot;.

====Emperor&#x27;s prerogatives====

Article 99 of the Constitution of 1824 declared that the “person of the Emperor is inviolable and sacred; he is not subject to any responsibility”. This disposition was not characteristic only of the nineteenth century Brazilian constitutional regime. On the contrary, the lack of responsibility of the monarch continues to exist under present-day parliamentary monarchies. The powers reserved to the Moderating Power were to be exercised only after consulting the Council of State. Most of these powers (which were enumerated in Article 101) were identical to those reserved for monarchs today, such as: to summon the General Assembly (parliament) in the intervals between sessions; to sanction the decrees and resolutions of the General Assembly, for them to take on the force of law; 
extend or postpone the General Assembly and dissolve the Chamber of Deputies (), convoking another immediately to replace the former; freely appointing and firing ministers of state; pardoning and modifying judicial sentences and granting amnesty. 

The dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies should not be confused with shutting down a National Congress (or Parliament). The first refers to a legal measure that exist under Parliamentarism, while the second is a dictatorial act. There was a great care on the part of Brazilian monarchs at the time to exercise their prerogative to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies. For example, in the case of Pedro I, he did not dissolve the Chamber of Deputies or postponed the Parliament during his reign. While Pedro II, not once in his 58 years as Emperor that such dissolution occurred by his own initiative; instead, it was always solicited by the President of the Council of Ministers. There were various dissolutions during the period of his reign, eleven in all, and of these, ten occurred only after the Council of State was consulted on the matter, something that was not obligatory. The power to veto laws was not absolute, merely partial: if two consecutive legislatures presented the same legislation without modifications, the Emperor&#x27;s signature would not be needed to pass it.

Among the other prerogatives of the emperor were: to suspend magistrates for complaints against their persons, but only after carrying through hearings with them, taking all the important information available, and consulting the Council of State (those magistrates effectively lost their jobs only after due process of law that resulted in a condenatory sentence after all possible appeals); approve or suspend resolutions (laws) of provincial councils and name Senators according to a list of the three candidates who had gained the majority of popular vote. The power to approve or suspend resolutions of provincial councils was extraordinary, it was the competence of the General Assembly and could only occur if that body, for some reason, was unable to meet (This prerogative was annulled by the 1834 Additional Act and the subsequent creation of the Provincial Assemblies).

As to the power of nominating Senators, that was not a characteristic peculiar to the Brazilian legal order, but to something common in all countries of that era. In the United Kingdom, the House of Lords was composed of life members and hereditary members and reserved solely to the nobility; similarly, in France, Senators, also with life terms, were named rather than elected; in the United States, a presidential republic, Senators were chosen by the state legislatures (until this was modified by the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913). None of these three countries, considered at that time to be democracies alongside Brazil, there was any popular participation in the selection of Senators. In contrast, in Brazil Senators were supposed to be named from a list of three candidates who had received the most votes from the Brazilian people.

Paulo Bonavides wrote that the Moderating Power &quot;can only be appreciated for its role on the consolidation of national unity and the stability of the political system of the Empire&quot; on “a continent politically flagellated by civil hatreds and pulverized into weak and rival republics.” For Galvão Sousa, the Moderating Power under Pedro II, “created the space for the famous &#x27;dictatorship of honesty.&#x27; It soon became the personal power of the monarch, always exercised with a high public spirit”. The term &quot;dictatorship&quot; () used by the author does not have a pejorative connotation and merely exemplifies what he perceives as the force of morality and justice that Pedro II imposed in his role as constitutional monarch.

===Executive branch===

According article 102 of the Constitution of 1824, &quot;the Emperor is the Head of Executive Power, and exercises it by his Ministers of State&quot;. However, in 1847 the Emperor Pedro II created the office of the President of the Council of Ministers to hold executive power, although the Emperor still possesses executive powers currently common to the Prime Minister of a monarchy. In practice, both exercised the executive function in different aspects. Through this reform, the Emperor would still be responsible for sanctioning or vetoing laws passed by the General Assembly, &quot;convening the new Ordinary General Assembly,&quot; appointing bishops, and providing ecclesiastical benefits, appointing magistrates, and awarding titles and honors. On the other hand, the President of the Council of Ministers was in fact the head of government and responsible for appointing ministers of state and to exercise their function through them, to be responsible for diplomacy, to issue decrees, instructions and regulations and to take care of everything that concerns this, &quot;to provide everything that concerns internal and external security, and to administer the public accounts together with the cabinet and parliament.

The president of the Council owed his position to both his party and to the Emperor, and these could sometimes come into conflict. 19th-century abolitionist leader and historian Joaquim Nabuco said that the &quot;President of the Council in Brazil was no Russian Chancellor, Sovereign&#x27;s creature, nor a British Prime Minister, made only by the trust of the [House of] Commons: the delegation of the Crown was to him as necessary and important as the delegation of the Chamber, and, to exert with safety his functions, he had to dominate the caprice, the oscillations and ambitions of the Parliament, as well as to preserve always unalterable the favor, the good will of the emperor.&quot;

===Legislative branch===
According to the Constitution, Legislative power is vested upon the General Assembly, a two-chamber legislature comprising the Imperial Senate and the Chamber of Deputies which in 1824 was composed of 50 senators and 102 general deputies, as the nation&#x27;s representatives.
#The Senate is composed of lifelong members organized in election. The most voted senators are chosen and appointed by the Emperor on a triple list. Each Province will give so many senators, as many as half of their respective deputies. 
#The Chamber of Deputies is composed by elected members to serve four-year terms.
The General Assembly alone could enact, revoke, interpret and suspend laws under Article 13 of the Constitution. The legislature also held the power of the purse and was required to annually authorize expenditures and taxes. It alone approved and exercised oversight of government loans and debts. Other responsibilities entrusted to the Assembly included setting the size of the military&#x27;s forces, the creation of offices within the government, monitoring the national welfare and ensuring that the government was being run in conformity to the Constitution. This last provision allowed the legislature wide authority to examine and debate government policy and conduct.

According to Article 16 of the Constitution of 1824, &quot;each of the Chamber will have the Treatment of Augusts and Dignified Representatives of the Nation.&quot; Each legislature lasts four years and each annual session four months. The imperial opening session of the Assembly always takes place on May 3. Both the opening and closing ceremonies will happen with the presence of the Emperor in full imperial regalia in the form of the internal regiment and in the presence of all the members of both chambers. The appointment of the respective Presidents, Vice Presidents, and Secretaries of Chambers, verification of the powers of its members, oath, and its internal police, shall be carried out in the form of its Rules of Procedure. The Members of each of the chambers are inviolable for the opinions they give in the exercise of their functions and during their deputation, they can not be arrested by any authority, except by order of their respective chamber or in flagrant crime capital punishment. Senators and deputies may be appointed to the post of Minister of State, or Councilor of State, with the difference that the Senators continue to sit in the Senate, and the Deputy leaves vacant his place of the Chamber, and proceed to New election, in which he could be re-elected and accumulate both functions. They also accumulate the two functions, if they already exercised any of the mentioned positions, when they were elected. One can not be at the same time a Member of both Houses. The exercise of any Employment, with the exception of those of Counselor of State, the Minister of State, shall cease on an interim basis, while the duties of Deputy or Senator shall last.

A Constitutional balance of power existed between the General Assembly and the executive branch under the Emperor. The legislature could not operate alone and the monarch could not force his will upon the Assembly.

===Judicial branch===
The independent Judiciary, and will be composed of judges, and jurors, who will have to log in this way in the civil, as in the crime in the cases, and by the way, that the Codes determine. The jurors pronounce on the fact, and the Judges apply the Law. The Emperor may suspend them for complaints against them, preceding a hearing of the same Judges, necessary information, and hearing the Council of State. All judges and bailiffs are responsible for possible abuses of power, and such as other crimes and illegal practices, can move a popular action against them that may end up disqualifying them from exercising law.

The Article 163 of the Constitution of 1824 says:

The constitutional determination stated that this court should be called the &quot;Supreme Court of Justice&quot; and was regulated by the Imperial Letter of Law of September 18, 1828 and installed on January 9, 1829 in operation in the House of the Senate and later in the Palace of Relation. The Supreme Court of Justice was the national court acting in all instances. All of its members were directly appointed by the Emperor. Each province has also its own Tribunal of Relations to try cases in the lower court.

The judiciary is completely independent even from the Emperor. However, although it can not interfere directly, the Emperor can commute applied penalties, such as the death penalty, which was no longer executed in 1876 by successive commutations of Emperor Pedro II.
=== Provincial and local governments ===

When enacted in 1824, the Imperial Constitution created the &quot;Conselho Geral de Província&quot; (Provincial General Council), the legislature of the provinces. This council was composed of either 21 or 13 elected members, depending on the size of a province&#x27;s population. All &quot;resolutions&quot; (laws) created by the councils required approval by the General Assembly, with no right of appeal. Provincial Councils also had no authority to raise revenues, and their budgets had to be debated and ratified by the General Assembly. Provinces had no autonomy and were entirely subordinate to the national government.

With the 1834 constitutional amendment known as the Additional Act, Provincial General Councils were supplanted by the &quot;Assembleias Legislativas Provinciais&quot; (Provincial Legislative Assemblies). The new Assemblies enjoyed much greater autonomy from the national government. A Provincial Assembly was composed of 36, 28 or 20 elected deputies, the number depending on the size of the province&#x27;s population. The election of provincial deputies followed the same procedure as used to elect general deputies to the national Chamber of Deputies.

The responsibilities of the Provincial Assembly included defining provincial and municipal budgets and levying the taxes necessary to support them; providing primary and secondary schools (higher education was the responsibility of the national government); oversight and control of provincial and municipal expenditures; and providing for law enforcement and maintenance of police forces. The Assemblies also controlled the creation and abolishment of, and salaries for, positions within provincial and municipal civil services. The nomination, suspension and dismissal of civil servants was reserved for the president (governor) of the province, but how and under what circumstances he could exercise these prerogatives was delineated by the Assembly. The expropriation of private property (with due monetary compensation) for provincial or municipal interests was also a right of the Assembly. In effect, the Provincial Assembly could enact any kind of law—with no ratification by Parliament—so long as such local laws did not violate or encroach upon the Constitution. However, provinces were not permitted to legislate in the areas of criminal law, criminal procedure laws, civil rights and obligations, the armed forces, the national budget or matters concerning national interests, such as foreign relations.

The provincial presidents were appointed by the national government and were, in theory, charged with governing the province. In practice, however, their power was intangible, varying from province to province based upon each president&#x27;s relative degree of personal influence and personal character. Since the national government wanted to ensure their loyalty, presidents were, in most cases, sent to a province in which they had no political, familial or other ties. In order to prevent them from developing any strong local interests or support, presidents would be limited to terms of only a few months in office. As the president usually spent a great deal of time away from the province, often traveling to their native province or the imperial capital, the de facto governor was the vice-president, who was chosen by the Provincial Assembly and was usually a local politician. With little power to undermine provincial autonomy, the president was an agent of the central government with little function beyond conveying its interests to the provincial political bosses. Presidents could be used by the national government to influence, or even rig, elections, although to be effective the president had to rely on provincial and local politicians who belonged to his own political party. This interdependency created a complex relationship which was based upon exchanges of favors, private interests, party goals, negotiations, and other political maneuvering.

The câmara municipal (town council) was the governing body in towns and cities and had existed in Brazil since the beginning of the colonial period in the 16th century. The Chamber was composed of vereadores (councilmen), the number of which depended on the size of the town. Unlike the Provincial General Council, the Constitution gave town councils great autonomy. However, when the Provincial Assembly replaced the Provincial General Council in 1834, many of the powers of town councils (including the setting of municipal budgets, oversight of expenditures, creation of jobs, and the nomination of civil servants) were transferred to the provincial government. Additionally, any laws enacted by the town council had to be ratified by the Provincial Assembly—but not by Parliament. While the 1834 Additional Act granted greater autonomy to the provinces from the central government, it transferred the towns&#x27; remaining autonomy to the provincial governments. There was no office of mayor, and towns were governed by a town council and its president (who was the councilman who won the most votes during elections)

==Elections==
===Overview===
According to the Constitution of 1824, one of the most liberal of its time, voting was obligatory and elections occurred in two steps: in first phase, voters chose Electors. The Electors then chose senators (members of the upper house), deputies (members of the lower house), provincial deputies (members of the Provincial Assemblies) and councilmen (members of the town&#x27;s assembly). All the men 25 years of age or older could vote in the first phase with an income of at least Rs 100$000 per year or more, with some exceptions; married men 21 years of age or older could vote, as well. To be an Elector, it was necessary to have an income of at least Rs 200$000 per year. 

The income requirement was much higher in the United Kingdom even after the 1832 reform. The only countries at the time that did not require a certain income to vote were France and Switzerland, where universal suffrage was introduced only in 1848. It is probable that no European country at the time had such liberal legislation as Brazil. The income requirement was low enough that, effectively, any employed male citizen could vote. For comparison, in 1876 the civil employee with the lowest wage at the time, a janitor working in the public sector, earned Rs 600$000 annually.

Most voters in Brazil had a low income. In 1876, for example, in the town of Formiga, in the province of Minas Gerais, the poor were 70% of the electorate and in Irajá, in the province of Rio de Janeiro, they were 87%. Ex-slaves couldn&#x27;t vote, but their children and grandchildren could, as could the illiterate (which few countries allowed). In 1872, 13% of the free Brazilian population voted. For comparison, in 1870 in the UK, electoral participation was 7% of the total population; in Italy, it was 2%; in Portugal, 9%; and in the Netherlands 2.5%. In 1832, the year of the British electoral reform, 3% of the British voted. Further reforms in 1867 and 1884 managed to expand electoral participation in the UK to 15%.

Although electoral fraud was common, it did not pass unobserved by Pedro II, or the politicians and experts of that time, who considered it a great problem to be resolved. Some measures, like the electoral reforms of 1855, 1875 and 1881, had been taken with intention to eliminate, or at least to diminish, fraud.

===Electoral reforms===

The Law of 19 September 1855 created the district vote and incompatibilities (also known as non-eligibility). The first one had as objective to make possible the representation of all the local factions, while the latter had the purpose of reducing the influence of the government (independent of what party was in power) in the result of the elections. Beyond these new features, it was forbidden that public officials campaign in their own districts, as a measure to prevent them from using public resources for their own political benefit. As a consequence, presidents of provinces, as well as provincial secretaries, military, judges and chiefs of police were prohibited from running in the district where they served, although they could still run in a different district. The positive results of the reform were already apparent in the immediate following elections, in 1856: prior to that time, such officials constituted the majority of new members of Parliament. The reduction in their numbers allowed the “real country&quot;(the Brazilian people) to enter “directly into the Parliament&quot;(that is, a true representative democracy), as was desired by Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão.

The next reform occurred in 1875, when a mechanism was introduced that would make possible the representation of minorities (eliminating once and for all the ignominious unanimous assemblies): the system of the third, where the voters chose only 2/3 of the list of voters of the province, and in turn, the voters voted in 2/3 of the number of provincial deputies (provincial members of the house of representatives), thus allowing that the remaining 1/3 was filled by the votes of the opposition.

The last and the most important reform, known as &quot;Saraiva Law&quot; (in homage to the then Prime Minister, José Antônio Saraiva) brought significant changes, because it eliminated the election in two turns, introducing the direct and facultative vote and allowed the votes of ex-slaves, as well as of non-Catholics. Also, it extended the electoral incompatibilities (non-eligibility) of 1855, forbidding campaigning by entrepreneurs of public works and vicars and bishops in their own parishes, and established that elect public officials elected in other districts than their own could not exercise their public positions, receive wages or be promoted while their mandates lasted. The effects of the reform were felt immediately, because while in 1850 something like 48% of the members of the house of representatives were public officers, in the last legislature this percentage fell to only 8%. If, on one hand, the reform diminished corruption and electoral fraud, allowing the Brazilian parliamentary system to work better, it also had negative effects, as the illiterate were no longer allowed to vote. The people&#x27;s participation in elections dropped from 13% of the total population to only 0.8% in 1886. However, in the first legislature after the reform, the conservative opposition had 39% of the seats. In the second, it had 44% while the republicans had 2%. In the third legislature, the liberals were opposition in that moment and had 18% of all seats.

In 1889 about 20% of the Brazilian population could read and write, so depriving the illiterate of the franchise does not explain the reason for the sudden fall of the electorate. Possibly, it occurred because voting was no longer obligatory, which, together with the lack of interest of the Brazilian people in exerting their rights of citizenship, may have resulted in the reduction in the number of voters (which would continue until the middle of the 1940s).

To many Brazilians at that time, the greatest issue about their elections was their belief that the illiterate didn&#x27;t have capacity to vote, on the grounds that the illiterate were unaware of the notion of the meaning of a representative government, of the choice of somebody as its representative and were easily corruptible, usually selling their votes. To Pedro II, the best way to resolve the problem about the electoral fraud was not restricting the right to vote but, instead, improving education in the country. Even so, Brazil was capable of keeping uninterrupted elections from 1822 to 1889, strengthening the electoral process, as well the representative system, a record matched in the Americas only by the United States and Canada.

<doc id="1019358" wikidata="Q1975471" url="?curid=1019358" title="Stefan Drzewiecki">
<text>Stefan Drzewiecki (: ; ; ; 26 July 1844, Kunka (ru), Podolia, Russian Empire (today Kunka (uk), Ukraine) – 23 April 1938, Paris) was a Polish scientist, journalist, engineer, constructor and inventor, known for designing and constructing the world&#x27;s first electric-powered submarine. He worked mainly in France and the Russian Empire.

He built the first submarine in the world with electric battery-powered propulsion in 1884. He also independently developed the blade element theory (BET), a mathematical process used to determine the behavior of propellers.

==Early life==
Drzewiecki was born into Polish aristocratic (szlachta) family of national patriots. His grandfather Józef Drzewiecki served under generals Kościuszko and Dąbrowski. His father Karol Drzewiecki took part in the November Uprising against Russia. Young Stefan was sent by him away from partitioned Poland to complete his education in France.

He graduated in mathematics from the École Centrale Paris and received his engineering diploma. At the age of 19, he returned to Poland to take part in the January Uprising (1863-1864) against Russia. A few years later, he came back to Paris to finish his study.

==Career==

In 1867, Drzewiecki made his first invention, a kilometre counter for horse-drawn carriages. After the fall of the Paris Commune in 1871, he left Paris for Vienna, where he settled at 2 Lindengasse and entirely focused on inventing. After the Vienna World&#x27;s Fair in 1873, he travelled to St. Petersburg at the invitation of Grand Duke Konstantin, where he pursued a fruitful career as a mechanical engineer. His inventions from that period include an instrument which automatically drew on a map the route traveled by the ship at sea.

Drzewiecki distinguished himself mainly in aviation and ship building. Beginning in 1877, during the Russo-Turkish War, he developed several models of propeller-driven submarines that evolved from single-person vessels to a four-man model. He personally took part in the war for which he received the Order of St. George (4th Class).
In 1884, he converted 2 mechanical submarines, installed on each a 1 hp engine with the new, at the time, source of energy - batteries. On tests submarine went under the water against the flow of the Neva River, Russia at a rate of 4 knots. It was the first submarine in the world with electric battery-powered propulsion.

He developed the theory of gliding flight, developed a method for the manufacture of ship and plane propellers (1892), and presented a general theory for screw-propeller thrust (1920). He is known for developing several models of early submarines for the Russian Navy. In 1902, Drzewiecki designed the submarine &quot;Pocztowyj&quot;, which was powered by two combustion engines that operated both underwater and after surfacing. He also devised a torpedo-launching system for ships and submarines that bears his name, the Drzewiecki drop collar. He also made an instrument that drew the precise routes of ships onto a nautical chart.

His work &quot;Theorie générale de l&#x27;hélice&quot; (1920), was honored by the French Academy of Science as fundamental in the development of modern propellers. In it he presented a complete theory about the moving propeller based directly on the general laws of the resistance of fluids.

==Remembrance==
Streets named in honour of Drzewiecki are located in a number of Polish cities including Warsaw, Wrocław, Gdańsk, Poznań, Biała Podlaska, Mielec and Szczecin.

In 1973, Drzewiecki and his submarine were featured on a postage stamp issued by the Polish Post in the PLN 2.70 denomination.

In 1991, a monument commemorating Drzewiecki was unveiled in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa where the inventor stayed for a period of time and tested his submarine in 1878.

In 2020, Drzewiecki was featured in a promotional publication titled &quot;Polacy światu. Znani i nieznani&quot; (Poles to the World. Known and Unknown) published by the Department of Cooperation with the Polish Diaspora and Poles Abroad of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<text>Tuesday Night Music Club is the debut studio album from American singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow, released on August 3, 1993. The first two singles from the album were not particularly successful. However, the album gained attention after the success of the fourth single, &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot;, based on the Wyn Cooper poem &quot;Fun&quot; and co-written by David Baerwald, Bill Bottrell, Sheryl Crow, and Kevin Gilbert. The single eventually reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, propelling the album to number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. It has sold more than 4.5 million copies in the US as of January 2008. On the UK Albums Chart, &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot; reached number eight and is certified 2× platinum.

==History==
The title of the album comes from the name for the ad hoc group of musicians including Crow, the &quot;Tuesday Music Club&quot;, who came together on Tuesdays to work on the album. Many of them share songwriting credits with Crow.

The front cover of the album shows Crow wearing a denim shirt with &quot;a sheepish smile&quot;. The back cover has a neon cafe sign of the &quot;Jenny Rose Cafe&quot;, consisting of the heart-shaped neon light behind the sign &quot;CAFE&quot; and above the other sign &quot;JENNY ROSE&quot;.

The group existed as a casual songwriting collective prior to its association with Crow, but rapidly developed into a vehicle for her debut album after her arrival. (At the time, she was dating Kevin Gilbert, who co-wrote most of the songs for this album with Crow, David Baerwald, David Ricketts, Bill Bottrell, Dan Schwartz and Brian MacLeod.) Her relationship with Gilbert became acrimonious soon after the album release and there were disputes about songwriting credits. In interviews later, Crow claimed to have written them. Both Gilbert and Baerwald castigated Crow publicly in the fallout, although Baerwald later softened his position. A similar tension arose with Bottrell after her second album, on which he collaborated during the early stages.

In February 2008, Bottrell said, &quot;The truth is hard to describe, but it lies between what all the people were shouting. It was all very vague and very complicated. She wrote the majority of the album. The guys and I contributed writing and lyrics, including some personal things. However, the sound was the sound that I developed&quot;. However, this was said while promoting their most current work together and contradicts most previous statements by him, including those in Richard Buskin&#x27;s highly detailed book about the situation. Bottrell in earlier times had said Crow was given the second-largest portion of the publishing splits on the album to motivate her to work hard, as she still had to pay the very large debt from her unreleasable real first record, and publishing was the only way she was likely to earn any money from her new record.

&quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot; sold 7.6 million copies in the US and UK during the 1990s. The album also won Crow three Grammy Awards in 1995: Record of the Year, Best New Artist, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.

Travis Tritt&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;Strong Enough&quot; features a song titled &quot;Strong Enough to Be Your Man&quot; and was written as a reply to Crow&#x27;s original song.

&quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot; was expanded for a 2009 re-release. The 2009 deluxe edition features the original 1993 album, a second CD containing B-sides, rarities and outtakes and a bonus DVD featuring the album&#x27;s six original videos plus a rare alternate version of &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot; directed by Roman Coppola. The DVD also includes a newly produced documentary composed of on-the-road, backstage, soundcheck and live footage from Crow&#x27;s early 1990s tour in support of the set. Four of the previously unreleased recordings on the bonus CD—&quot;Coffee Shop&quot;, &quot;Killer Life&quot;, &quot;Essential Trip of Hereness&quot; and &quot;You Want More&quot;—were recorded in 1994 and intended for Crow&#x27;s follow-up album. The cuts were mixed for this album by original &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot; producer Bill Bottrell. The bonus CD also includes a trio of UK single B-sides—&quot;Reach Around Jerk&quot;, an alternate version of &quot;The Na-Na Song&quot; titled &quot;Volvo Cowgirl 99&quot; and a cover of Eric Carmen&#x27;s &quot;All by Myself&quot;—as well as a cover of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;D&#x27;yer Mak&#x27;er&quot; and the song &quot;On the Outside&quot;, which was released as part of an &quot;X-Files&quot; soundtrack album.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing the album for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, David Rothschild wrote that &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot; &quot;has a loosely-structured intimacy that perfectly compliments the straight-up, personal tone of Crow&#x27;s rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll story-telling and vocals.&quot; &quot;Vox&quot;″s Patrick Humphries called it a &quot;confident and assured&quot; debut &quot;bubbling over with heady music from all sources&quot;, while &quot;Q&quot;″s Ian Cranna found the music &quot;stylish, but not slick&quot; and highlighted the mixture of &quot;irony, imagination and observation&quot; in Crow&#x27;s &quot;charged lyrics&quot;. Dennis Hunt of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; commented that Crow &quot;sings with the seductive quirkiness of Rickie Lee Jones&quot;, a comparison echoed by Jon Pareles in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who added that Crow&#x27;s best songs &quot;are terse and well observed, and her voice makes even the lesser ones sound genuine.&quot;

In a retrospective appraisal, AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot;″s &quot;loose, ramshackle charm&quot; and concluded that &quot;even with the weaker moments, Crow manages to create an identity for herself – a classic rocker at heart but with enough smarts to stay contemporary.&quot; Terry Staunton lauded it as &quot;a stone cold 90s classic&quot; in &quot;Record Collector&quot;, opining that despite the album being collaboratively written, &quot;it&#x27;s Crow&#x27;s distinctive vocals... that caught the ear and led to Grammy recognition.&quot; &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot; was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, and was ranked at number 94 on a 2017 list by NPR of the 150 greatest female albums of all time.

<text>Fogo (; Portuguese for &quot;fire&quot;) is an island in the Sotavento group of Cape Verde in the central Atlantic Ocean. Its population is 35,837 (2015), with an area of 476 km2. It reaches the highest altitude of all the islands in Cape Verde, rising to above sea level at the summit of its active volcano, Pico do Fogo.

==History==
The eastern side of Fogo collapsed into the ocean 73,000 years ago, creating a tsunami 170 meters high which struck the nearby island of Santiago.

Fogo was discovered in 1460 by Genovese captain António de Noli on behalf of Henry the Navigator and the Portuguese Crown. It appeared in a 1598 map as &quot;I. de Fogo&quot;. Fogo was the second island of Cape Verde that was settled by the Portuguese, between 1470 and 1490, making São Filipe the second oldest town of Cape Verde after Cidade Velha.

The Fogo volcano erupted frequently, both from the summit and from flank fissures, notably in 1680, 1725, 1857, 1951, 1995, and 2014–15. The eruption of 1680 covered much of the island in ash, which forced many inhabitants to flee to the nearby island of Brava.

Fogo has been very susceptible to drought and famine. In years with insufficient summer rains, many inhabitants experienced starvation. This occurred several times in the 18th and 19th century, and also between 1941 and 1943, when 31% of the island population perished.

Until January 1992 the island was one single municipality, subdivided into four parishes. The southwestern three parishes joined the new municipality of São Filipe and the northeastern parish Nossa Senhora da Ajuda became the municipality of Mosteiros. The parish of Santa Catarina do Fogo was separated from São Filipe in 2005, and became the Municipality of Santa Catarina do Fogo.

==Geography==
One of the southernmost islands in Cape Verde, Fogo is located between the islands of Santiago to the east and Brava to the west. It is 26.3 km long and 23.9 km wide; its area is 476 km2. Practically the whole island is a stratovolcano that has been periodically active: it last erupted in 2014. The largest volcanic feature is Bordeira, a caldera, which has walls high, and has a breach in its eastern rim. Two small villages, Portela and Bangaeira, exist in the floor of the caldera (Chã das Caldeiras); the residents were evacuated during eruptions.

The island&#x27;s main city is São Filipe, near which are an airport and a port. Fogo is largely an agricultural, fertile island. The north-eastern part receives the most precipitation.

=== Flora and fauna ===

Key bird species of Fogo are Fea&#x27;s petrel, Boyd&#x27;s shearwater and Cape Verde swift. The endemic plants &quot;Echium vulcanorum&quot; (endangered) and &quot;Erysimum caboverdeanum&quot; (critically endangered) are only found on the outer crater rim of the volcano of Fogo.

===Climate===
Being very mountainous, Fogo has quite a number of climates. Along the coast Fogo has a moderate dry tropical climate according to the Köppen–Geiger climate classification system; higher on the slopes (~ A.S.L.) it has a semiarid mild tropical climate (Köppen–Geiger &quot;BSh&quot; with very balanced temperatures year round; above it has a cool highland subtropical steppe climate (Köppen–Geiger &quot;BSkL&quot;). The average annual temperature on the coast is about , decreasing to some on the highest ground.

There can be remarkably cool weather in the interior, with the warmer wet season starting in July and ending in November, with the colder dry season starting in December and ending in May. Drought, the major climate risk of Cape Verdean islands, is much less pronounced on Fogo, due to the mountain&#x27;s ability to gain moisture from clouds. During the mid-nineteenth century, Fogo suffered from severe droughts. Death from starvation was common in the 1830s.

==Population==
In the 1830s, Fogo had an estimated human population of 10,000. In 2015, Fogo had 35,837 inhabitants, making it the fourth most populous island in the Cape Verde archipelago after Santiago, São Vicente and Santo Antão. Since 2015, there are three cities (São Filipe, Mosteiros and Cova Figueira) and two towns (Ponta Verde and Patim) in the island.

The official language of Fogo is Portuguese; yet mostly Fogo Creole is spoken.

==Economy==
The economy of the island is based on agriculture and fishing, with coffee and wine among the main products. In the 1830s, Fogo&#x27;s wine was described as being &quot;very superior.&quot; Due to its volcanic soil Fogo&#x27;s coffee also has a good reputation. The island has experienced a substantial diaspora. Many households live off remittances from emigrants in the U.S. and in European countries (Portugal, France, the Netherlands, Italy). Fogo fosters strong connections to Rhode Island and to Massachusetts (U.S.), where many people with Cape Verdean origin live.

Tourism is steadily becoming popular. The volcano (allowed only accompanied by a local guide) is the island&#x27;s major attraction but many visitors also come to see relatives. The historic city of São Filipe and Chã das Caldeiras in the volcanic crater receive the bulk of visitors. No great tourism facilities exist, but there are small hotels and bed-and-breakfasts and local guides offer hiking tours.

==Administrative divisions==
The island is divided in three municipalities, which are subdivided into civil parishes:
*Mosteiros
**Nossa Senhora da Ajuda
*Santa Catarina do Fogo
**Santa Catarina do Fogo
*São Filipe
**Nossa Senhora da Conceição
**São Lourenço

==Transportation==
The island has a domestic airport, São Filipe Airport, located in the southwest of the island. There is a port at Vale de Cavaleiros near São Filipe, with ferry connections to the islands of Brava (Furna) and Santiago (Praia). There are two first class national roads on Fogo: the Fogo Circular Road (EN1-FG01) and the road linking São Filipe and the island&#x27;s port (EN1-FG02).

==Sports==
The main football teams are Académica do Fogo, Botafogo, Cutelinho, Spartak d&#x27;Aguadinha and Vulcânicos.

<text>Allihies (; ) is a townland in the civil parish of Kilnamanagh, in County Cork, Ireland. The townland of Allihies is located at the western tip of the Beara Peninsula.

==History of copper mining==
From the Bronze Age the area had been a site of copper-mining. In 1812 John Lavallin Puxley (1772–1856) established a company to operate the Berehaven copper mines at Allihies. 
During the following century, between 1812 and 1912, 297,000 tons of ore were recorded as passing through the smelter at Swansea in Wales from the mines at Allihies. Drilling during this period by the Berehaven company took place throughout the townland of Allihies, and the adjacent townlands of Cloan and Kealoge.

Three ruined Cornish engine houses are visible from Allihies. The most visually prominent is the Mountain Mine man engine house, located on the skyline above the village, and installed by the noted Cornish engineers Michael Loam and Son in 1862.

In the late nineteenth century, newly developed sources of copper ore were being worked in Africa, the Americas and Australia. A resulting fall in the worldwide price of copper led in 1884 to the closure of the mining operations at Allihies. The area saw large-scale emigration, with many of the miners finding their way to newly developing mining centres in the United States and Canada. Among these centres is Butte, Montana, where many families (Lowneys, Harringtons and others) trace their ancestry to Allihies and the Beara peninsula.

Can-Erin Mines during the 1950s and 1960s dewatered the Mountain Mine and conducted evaluation drilling, resulting in an assessment that a reopening was not economically viable, given projected operating costs and world copper prices. The company noted, however, that the Mountain Mine &quot;has significant untested resource potential&quot; 

The Mountain Mine engine house has recently (2003) undergone conservation by the Mining Heritage Trust of Ireland. The completed conservation project and some of the underground mine workings were the subject of the TV documentary programme &quot;Townlands&quot; on RTÉ One in 2005.

Daphne du Maurier’s novel &quot;Hungry Hill&quot; is a fictionalized saga of several generations of a mine-owning dynasty and based loosely on the history of the Puxley family.

==Festivals==
The annual Allihies Festival traditionally takes place on 15 August. It usually features horse racing - a practice probably dating from the time of more widespread use of horses and ponies in the copper mining industry. It takes place in a setting between the ocean and the surrounding mountains. The festivities now extend through the week and feature music, bale tossing and other events.

In 2008-9 the village also hosted the Michael Dwyer Festival of Traditional Irish music, which commemorates the life of a Beara musician and composer.

==Presidential visits==
In 2007 the parish was visited by the President of Ireland, Mary McAleese for the opening of the Allihies Copper Mine Museum, commemorating the area&#x27;s mining heritage. The museum is housed in the chapel built by Cornish miners in 1845. The veins of copper at Allihies were discovered in 1812 and worked until 1884 and many Cornish mine captains, miners and craftsmen were employed alongside Irish people.

The village also attracted attention in June 1990 when it was chosen as one of the first places that Mary Robinson visited in her successful campaign for election as President of Ireland.

==Children of Lir legend==
The mythical story &quot;Children of Lir&quot; is well known in Ireland, with several areas claimed as the landing spot of the swans after their 900-year journey on the seas. One version of this oral tradition holds that the children of Lir were buried in Allihies. A site associated with this tradition is located near the village.

<text>Ballaghaderreen () is a town in County Roscommon, Ireland. It was part of County Mayo prior to 1898. It is in the north-west of the county, near the borders with counties Mayo and Sligo, just off the N5 road. The population was 2,387 in the 2022 census.

== History ==
As of 1837, the town was recorded as having 1147 inhabitants in about 200 houses and as &quot;rising in importance&quot; as a post-town, being on the (then) new mail coach road from Ballina to Longford.

As of the mid-19th century, markets were held on Fridays, with seven fairs held throughout the year. A court-house, market house and an infantry barracks to accommodate 94 persons had all been established by that time.

In 1860, Ballaghaderreen Cathedral was dedicated as the cathedral for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Achonry.

In March 2017, Ballaghaderreen became an Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre (EROC) for hundreds of refugees from the Syrian Civil War. In April 2018, the community was honoured with a People of the Year Award for welcoming the refugees into the community.

==Governance==

Ballaghadereen is part of the Barony of Costello and in the parish of Kilcoleman. 

Ballaghaderreen has been part of County Roscommon since 1898 when the town and parish of Ballaghaderreen and Edmondstown were transferred from County Mayo under the Local Government Act 1898. (This has led to some anomalies; for example, the local Gaelic Athletic Association team is affiliated with the Mayo GAA county board.)

==Sports==
The local Gaelic football club is Ballaghaderreen GAA. It is affiliated with the Mayo GAA county board.

Ballaghaderreen FC, the local association football (soccer) club, was founded in 1967.

==Transport==
Ballaghaderreen was previously located on the N5 national primary road linking Longford to Westport. However, the town was bypassed in September 2014 with the re-routing of the N5 to the north of the town.

The nearest railway stations are in Castlerea (21 km) and Boyle (26 km). Ballaghaderreen was previously served by the Ballaghaderreen branch line from Kilfree Junction, with Ballaghaderreen railway station having opened on 2 November 1874 and closed permanently on 4 February 1963. The station house remains standing, in a state of severe dereliction, just off Station Road.

Ballaghaderreen is on the main Dublin-Ballina bus route and there are several buses daily serving this route.Ireland West Airport is 15 km to the west.

<text>Åstorp is a bimunicipal locality and the seat of Åstorp Municipality in Scania County, Sweden with 9,488 inhabitants in 2010. It is also partly located in Ängelholm Municipality.

==Overview==
Åstorp is a railway junction located along the European route E4 close to Helsingborg. Åstorp Station is located 25 minutes by train from Helsingborg and 70 minutes from Kristianstad on the local line Helsingborg-Hässleholm-Kristianstad.

Åstorp grew in importance when the railway from Helsingborg to Hässleholm-Stockholm was completed in 1875. In 1886 a railway to Malmö was completed, and in 1888 Åstorp became a main junction when the Malmö-Gothenburg line was completed. These lines are still in use, although passenger traffic Malmö-Gothenburg is re-routed via Helsingborg-Ängelholm. The Ängelholm-Åstorp-Teckomatorp line is a main route for cargo trains to Malmö. Åstorp is connected to Helsingborg via two routes, one entering Helsingborg from the north and one from the south via Ramlösa.

Åstorp has also been connected with railroads to Landskrona, to Eslöv via Klippan, to Markaryd-Ljungby and to Höganäs-Mölle although traffic is discontinued and most of the tracks have been removed.

<text>Ängelholm is a locality and the seat of Ängelholm Municipality in Skåne, Sweden with 42,131 inhabitants in 2017.

==History==
The city was founded in 1516 as Engelholm by King Christian II of Denmark, who moved the settlement from Luntertun on the coast because it was difficult to defend. As a founder, King Christian II personally identified the boundaries of the new city, granting the city a charter in 1516. At Luntertun there is only a church garden left today.

The town remained small for centuries. Following the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, Ängelholm, together with the rest of Skåne, was assigned by Denmark to Sweden. The town began to grow in the 19th century due to industrialization. It was also a garrison town until 1883 and had a Swedish Air Force base between 1941 and 2009. The older spelling &quot;Engelholm&quot; was retained until 1912, when the city council decided to adopt a more modern spelling in line with the Swedish spelling reform of 1906. The high-performance car manufacturer Koenigsegg Automotive is based on the premises of the decommissioned Scania Wing (F 10).

==Contemporary==
Tourism is an important industry for the city. There is a 6-kilometer long sandy beach right outside the town. The winds in Skälder Bay make the beach a popular place for sailors, wave surfers and wind surfers.

There is also an ice cream manufacturer, Engelholms Glass which produces about 1.2 million litres of ice-cream every year.

A special sight of Ängelholm is the UFO-Memorial Ängelholm.

The city is known for its clay cuckoos — a special kind of ocarina. This is however a dying tradition as there is now only one producer of clay cuckoos, Sofia Nilsson. Ängelholm has the only orchestra of clay cuckoos in the whole world with which performed at the &quot;Allsång på Skansen&quot; in 2007.

Ängelholm is also the home of hockey team Rögle BK that competes in the SHL.

<text>Ystad () is a town and the seat of Ystad Municipality, in Scania County, Sweden. Ystad had 18,350 inhabitants in 2010. The settlement dates from the 11th century and has become a busy ferryport, local administrative centre, and tourist attraction. The detective series &quot;Wallander&quot;, created by Henning Mankell, is set primarily in Ystad.

In 1285, the town&#x27;s name was written &quot;Ystath&quot;. Its original meaning is not fully understood, but the &quot;y&quot; probably is related to an old word for the yew tree, while &quot;stad&quot; means &quot;town&quot; or &quot;place&quot;.

==History ==

After the time of Absalon, Bishop of Roskilde and Archbishop of Lund, peace was brought to the area in the 11th century, fishing families settled at the mouth of the river Vassa as herring fishing became the main source of trade. Ystad was not mentioned in documents until 1244, in a record of King Eric&#x27;s visit to the town with his brother, Abel. A Franciscan monastery, &quot;Gråbrödraklostret&quot;, was founded in 1267, and Ystad joined the Hanseatic League in the 14th century.

The charter of 1599 gave the town the right to export oxen. Ystad, together with all of Scania, was transferred from Denmark to Sweden following the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658.

By 1866 Ystad had a railway connection and it was established as a garrison town in the 1890s. After World War II, ferry services to Świnoujście Poland and to the Danish island of Bornholm were opened.

==Demographics==
In 1658, Ystad&#x27;s population was about 1,600 and, by 1850 it had reached 5,000. The increased importance brought by the railway and the garrison in the 1890s drove the population above 10,000.

==In culture==
In his novel &quot;Inferno&quot; (1897), August Strindberg describes Ystad like so:

The little town to which I now betook myself lies in the extreme south of Sweden, on the seacoast. It is an old pirates&#x27; and smugglers&#x27; haunt, in which exotic traces of all parts of the world have been left by various voyagers.

Ystad is the setting of the Swedish crime drama &quot;Wallander&quot;.

==Infrastructure==

===Economy===
Some of the main industries of the town are trade, handicraft and tourism, derived from being one of the best-preserved medieval towns in the Scania province and its association with the Wallander detective novels. 

===Transport===

The ferry port has services to the Danish island of Bornholm, to Sassnitz in Germany, and to Świnoujście in Poland, the latter forming part of the E65 road route south from Malmö.

Ystad connects the Ystad Line and Österlen Line railways. Passenger traffic runs between Malmö and Simrishamn (operated by Skåne Commuter Rail). Until December 2017, a direct train service linked Ystad to Copenhagen via the Øresund Bridge (operated by Danish State Railways).

===Sports===
The most popular sport in Ystad is handball, with two big clubs. Ystads IF is in Elitserien (the highest Swedish men&#x27;s national league, ) whilst IFK Ystad is situated in Division 1 (the second highest league, ). Several famous handball players have played for these clubs, including Per Carlén.

===Media===
The only newspaper published at present in Ystad is the &quot;Ystads Allehanda&quot;, which also covers the neighbouring municipalities of Skurup, Tomelilla, Simrishamn and Sjöbo. The newspaper was founded in 1873.

===Places of interest===
One of Sweden&#x27;s best preserved medieval monasteries, the Greyfriars Abbey, lies in Ystad. The town also has an additional large medieval church, the Church of the Virgin Mary (&quot;Mariakyrkan&quot;). Both are highly influenced by Gothic Hansa architecture (which can also be seen in churches around the Baltic Sea, for instance in Helsingborg, Malmö, and Rostock) and are among the best examples in Sweden of Brick Gothic. In addition, there are areas of surviving medieval town architecture, like the Latin school (built ) and several townhouses. The city is also included in the European Route of Brick Gothic. 

From the steeple of the Church of the Virgin Mary the Tower Watchman (tornväktaren or lurblåsaren) sounds his horn every 15 minutes from 21:15 to 01:00 to let the people of Ystad know that the town is safe from fire and enemies. The Tower Watchman also says a special line when sounding his horn: &quot;The clock strikes ... (for example twelve). All is quiet from fire and thieves! May God preserve the town!&quot; The tradition has existed since the eighteenth century.

<text>Staffanstorp is a locality and the seat of Staffanstorp Municipality, Skåne County, Sweden with 14,808 inhabitants in 2010. Staffanstorp is the largest Scanian settlement that never acquired town privileges before their abolishment in Sweden in 1971.

==Geography ==

The town is located at the centre of a large triangular fertile plain which reaches approximately 25 kilometres from the Øresund strait inwards in Scania. The base of the triangle follows the coast, approximately 25 kilometres starting in Malmö in the south.

==History==
As a village, it was mentioned in 14th-century sources, but it would remain fairly insignificant in the shadow of more important towns such as Lund, Dalby and Malmö. An inn and the local hundred jail with two cells were located there in the 19th century.

Staffanstorp has been the site for Housing Trade Shows, the first in 1970 with 43 furnished homes and 100.000 paying visitors, and the most recent in 1997 with 25 exhibited homes. In the 1990s, the town centre was recreated, taking inspiration from New Urbanism. The unpopular buildings from the 1960s were covered by new roofs, façades and more stories built in a traditional Scanian pastiche architectural style. A couple of multi-storey buildings were constructed on a lot that had previously been the local stadium, and the road plan was further complicated to make drivers slow down and, if possible, avoid going through the centre.

== Schools ==
Staffanstorp has two &quot;högstadieskola&quot; schools (senior level of compulsory school), Baldersskolan and Hagalidskolan. As of 2023, approximately 3500 students are enrolled in all schools in Staffanstorp.

Baldersskolan (formerly called Centralskolan until 2013) is located in the central part of Staffanstorp. The school houses students between the ages of 6 and 15 or F–9th grade. Baldersskolan also has &quot;matteprofilen&quot; in 7th–9th grade, where students can study matte 1c (high school level math) in 9th grade.

Hagalidskolan also has an MFF academy.

Internationella Engelska Skolan Staffanstorp opened its doors in August 2022. It is an independent school from F-Klass to Year 9. In 2022, 450 students were enrolled in the school.

<text>Sjöbo is a locality and the seat of Sjöbo Municipality in Skåne county, Sweden with 6,724 inhabitants in 2010.

==Overview==
Sjöbo started growing when it became a stop on the railway between Malmö (to the west) and Simrishamn (to the east) in the early 20th century. Today the town of Sjöbo cannot be reached by rail, but a road through central Scania crosses the municipality and town, while another large road from east to west also crosses it.

Sjöbo holds the Guinness World Record for the biggest &quot;rulltårta&quot; ever made. &quot;Spettekaka&quot; (&quot;spit cake&quot;) is a cake made out of flour, sugar and eggs and baked on a type of rotisserie, or &#x27;spit&#x27;.

The town is also associated with many cases of opposition to immigration (see Refugee controversy in Sjöbo). In the 2010 election, the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats received 16% of the vote, the highest of any municipality. and also the highest results in the new elections of 2014 with 30%, 40% in 2018, and 43% in 2022.

<text>Simrishamn is a locality and the seat of Simrishamn Municipality, Skåne County, Sweden with 6,527 inhabitants in 2010. Despite its small population, Simrishamn is, for historical reasons, usually still referred to as a &quot;city&quot;.

Simrishamn is a picturesque coastal town, built around the main street (&quot;Storgatan&quot;), that passes the market square, itself being the centre of the town. The climate of Simrishamn is mild, because it is warmed by the Gulf Stream and the Baltic Sea, and the hardiness zone of Simrishamn is 8a, comparable to Paris, France.

==History==

Simrishamn is first mentioned (as &quot;Symbrishafn&quot;) in 1161 and as a town in 1361. &quot;Simris&quot; has been interpreted as &quot;at the mouth of the slow-flowing (river)&quot; and hamn as &quot;port or harbour&quot;, meaning present-day Tommarpsån. It has been speculated that the name has something to do with the Cimbri, a Germanic tribe, as the name also has been &quot;Cimbrishavn&quot;. In 1658, when Scania under the Treaty of Roskilde was permanently transferred from Denmark to Sweden, the town had a population of about 200 people. The growth was relatively small until about 1810 when it reached 700 inhabitants, growing to 1,365 in 1850 and 1,966 in 1890. The local government reform of 1971 made Simrishamn the seat of Simrishamn Municipality with about 20,000 inhabitants.

==Climate==
The nearest station to Simrishamn is in Skillinge further down the coastline, also on the open sea. Skillinge has a maritime climate with a moderated coastline and a slightly warmer interior during summers. Österlen has a drier climate than elsewhere in Southern Sweden, although it has no active weather station measuring sunshine. Even so, the cool temperatures of the Baltic Sea keeps the immediate coastline on average a couple of degrees cooler during July days than in places further north in the country or the western part of Skåne. This is due to the dominance of water in the surroundings, whereas the Mälar valley around Stockholm is surrounded by more land.

Especially during summer, seasonal lag is strong on the local coastline. This means that August averages the warmest summer nights and that September is a lot warmer than May as the sea water gradually warms. During winter, this maritime proximity of Österlen reverses the climate patterns and leads to average highs above on the coastline and frosts usually being weak even while frequent. Records for Skillinge began in 1995 and as such do not contain likely historical extremes. Simrishamn had an active weather station from 1951 that closed in 1996.

<text>Lund (, ; ) is a city in the province of Scania, southern Sweden. The town had 94,393 inhabitants out of a municipal total of 130,288 . It is the seat of Lund Municipality, Scania County. The Öresund Region, which includes &quot;Lund&quot;, is home to more than 4.2 million people.

Archeologists date the founding of Lund to around 990, when Scania was part of Denmark. From 1103 it was the seat of the Catholic Metropolitan Archdiocese of Lund, and the towering Lund Cathedral, built –1145, still stands at the centre of the town. Denmark ceded the city to Sweden in the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, and its status as part of Sweden was again confirmed in following peace treaties.

Lund University, established in 1666, is one of Scandinavia&#x27;s oldest and largest institutions for education and research. The university and its buildings dominate much of the centre of the city, and have led to Lund becoming a regional centre for high-tech industry.

== History ==

Along with Sigtuna, Lund is the oldest city in present-day Sweden. Lund&#x27;s origins are unclear. Until the 1980s, the city was thought to have been founded around 1020 by either Sweyn I Forkbeard or his son Canute the Great of Denmark. The area was then part of the kingdom of Denmark. However, recent archaeological discoveries suggest that the first settlement dated to , possibly the relocation of settlers at Uppåkra. The Uppåkra settlement dates back to the first century B.C. and its remains are at the present site of the village of Uppåkra. King Sweyn I Forkbeard moved Lund to its present location, a distance of some . The new location of Lund, on a hill and across a ford, gave the new site considerable defensive advantages in comparison with Uppåkra, situated on the highest point of a large plain.

The organisation of the Danish church begun under the rule of Canute the Great. Lund became the see of one of seven dioceses in 1048. In 1104 it became an archbishopric. Lund&#x27;s ecclesiastical province comprised Scandinavia and even Garðar on Greenland. The diocese of nearby Dalby was absorbed in 1066. Lund Cathedral was similarly founded in or shortly after 1103. In 1152, the Norwegian archdiocese of Nidaros was founded as a separate province of the church, independent of Lund. In 1164 Sweden also acquired an archbishop of its own, although he was nominally subordinate to the archbishop of Lund. It is still, as the diocese of Lund, a diocese in the Church of Sweden.
Lund Cathedral School &quot;(Katedralskolan)&quot; was founded in 1085 by the Danish king Canute the Saint. This is the oldest school in Scandinavia and one of the oldest in Northern Europe. Many prominent people were educated there, among them the actor Max von Sydow and several high-ranking politicians.

Lund was ceded to Sweden in 1658 as part of the terms of the Treaty of Roskilde. It was recaptured by Denmark in 1676 during the early phases of the Scanian War. The exceptionally bloody Battle of Lund was fought just north of the city in 1676, and ended in a decisive Swedish victory; Swedish control of Scania was confirmed in the Peace of Lund later that year. Sweden&#x27;s control over Scania, and hence Lund, was again confirmed by another treaty in 1720.

Scandinavia&#x27;s first University, the Academy of Lund was founded in the 1400s. It was suppressed during the Danish Reformation in 1537. The present Lund University was established in 1666.

In 1943, during the Second World War, Lund was accidentally bombed by a British aircraft. No deaths were reported, though some people were injured by glass fragments.

Over the second half of the 20th century the population of Lund more than doubled, driven in large part by the growth of the university and high tech industries. For example, Tetra Pak, the food packaging and processing company, was founded in Lund in 1952. Suburbs were added to the outer edges of the city: Klostergården, Norra Fäladen and Linero in the 1960s, Norra Nöbbelöv in the 1970s, Gunnesbo in the 1980s and Värpinge in the 1990s.

== Geography ==
Lund is located in Sweden&#x27;s largest agricultural district, in the south-west of Scania, less than from the sandy shore of the Öresund Strait. Its location on the south-facing slope of the Romeleåsen horst leads to the city rising from the low-lying Höje River in the south to above mean sea level in the north. From the top of the Sankt Hans Hill it is possible to see Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. The nearest large Swedish city, Malmö, is about to the south-west. Other Swedish cities are more distant: Gothenburg is away, the capital Stockholm is distant, and Umeå lies to the north.

The central part of Lund largely retains its medieval street layout. A few buildings from the Middle Ages remain, including Lund Cathedral, Liberiet, St. Peter&#x27;s Priory, the restaurant Stäket and Krognoshuset. Many of today&#x27;s buildings in the centre were constructed in the late 1800s, including Katedralskolan, the Grand Hotel and the main building and library of Lund University.

=== City squares ===

Lund city contains four main city squares that are connected by a number of roads and passages that represent the main city centre containing numerous restaurants, shops and bars. &quot;Clemenstorget&quot; is a tree-covered city square located alongside the railway and associated station, hosts a small market and is the central terminus of the city&#x27;s tramway. &quot;Bantorget&quot; is a green park-square close to the central station and Lund&#x27;s Grand Hotel is placed there. The city hall is located on the main city square - &quot;Stortorget&quot; which often features concerts and various cultural and political events. &quot;Mårtenstorget&quot; hosts the Lund Market Hall, has many restaurants, food trucks and bars around it and serves as a market square during the daytime. In earlier times the square was used as a cattle market and was known as &quot;Oxtorget&quot;. Smaller city squares in Lund include Domkyrkoplatsen, Petriplatsen, Västra stationstorget, Sockertorget and Knut den Stores Torg.

=== Parks and nature===


Lund&#x27;s most central park is Lundagård, which, along with the adjoining University square, forms the centre of the University. The park is dominated by historic buildings including Lund Cathedral, Lund University Main Building, and Kungshuset. The trees of the park are home to a large colony of rooks.

The much larger main city park (Stadsparken) is located in the south-west corner of the city center. The site was used for the Lund Exhibition in 1907 and subsequently developed into a public park between 1909 and 1911. The park contains planted gardens, a small lake, a children&#x27;s playground and bandstands, as well as the public swimming center Högevallsbadet and the former buildings of Lund Observatory. It also has a menagerie that houses different varieties of birds.

Other significant areas of greenery in the city include the Botanical Garden (Botaniska trädgården) and Sankt Hans Hill in the north of the city. The nature preserve Rinnebäck Gorge (Rinnebäcksravinen), The Källby dams (Källby dammar) and the community park Folkparken are located in the western part of the city. The nature preserve Nöbbelövs Marshland (Nöbbelövs mosse) is located in the northwest of the city.

Popular places for swimming close to the city are the beaches in neighboring Lomma, Bjärred and Malmö and lakes such as the nature preserve Billebjer and the Dalby quarry (Dalby stenbrott) in the eastern countryside of the city.

=== Climate ===
Lund, like the rest of far southern Sweden, has an oceanic climate. The climate is relatively mild compared to other locations at similar latitudes, or even somewhat further south, mainly because of its proximity to the sea. Because of Lund&#x27;s northerly latitude, daylight lasts as long as 17 hours at midsummer, and only around 7 hours in mid-winter.

Summers are warm and pleasant with average high temperatures of and lows of around , but temperatures often exceed and heat waves are common during the summer. Winters are quite chilly, with temperatures steady between . Lund has arguably the mildest climate of the country in average highs. In terms of yearly means and average lows Falsterbo is marginally milder.

Rainfall is light to moderate throughout the year with an average of 169 wet days. Snowfall occurs sparingly, mainly from December to March, but snow cover does not typically remain for a long time, and some winters are virtually free of snow.

== Demographics ==
The population of the city has increased steadily over the last century. Of the inhabitants of the municipality, 18.8% were reported to have been born outside of Sweden in 2014, now approximated to have grown to 28.95%. Lund University students make up a significant part of the city&#x27;s population.

== Governance ==

Lund is governed by Lund Municipality. The municipality is responsible for the city of Lund, nearby settlements including Dalby, Södra Sandby and Veberöd, and the surrounding countryside. It reached its current form in 1974 following the absorption of a number of nearby municipalities. In 2014 the city itself was officially divided into 14 administrative divisions.

The municipality is governed by a municipal assembly () of 65 members, who elect a municipal executive committee () of 13 members. the mayor and chairman of the executive committee () has been Philip Sandberg of the Liberals.

== Education ==

=== Lund University ===

The university dominates much of the centre of Lund. It was founded in 1666 following the transfer of Scania to Sweden under the Treaty of Roskilde and is the second-oldest university in Sweden after Uppsala University. Its traditional centre is in Lundagård park but stretches out towards the north east of the city where the large engineering faculty is located. Today, Lund University is one of northern Europe&#x27;s largest, with eight faculties, 41,000 students and over 2,000 separate courses. It is and has consistently ranked in the world top 100 universities and is a member of the League of European Research Universities as well as the global Universitas 21 network.

=== Other educational institutions ===
Katedralskolan (Lund Cathedral School) founded in 1085, is the oldest school in Scandinavia. Today it is a high gymnasium with about 1,400 students studying in five different programmes.

Östervångskolan is a &quot;specialskola&quot; (special school) for deaf and hard of hearing students, providing education in Swedish and Swedish Sign Language. It accepts students from Skåne and surrounding areas. The school was founded in 1871 as &quot;Skånes Anstalt för Döfstumma i Lund&quot; (Skåne&#x27;s Institute for the Deaf and Mute in Lund) and had its premises on Östervångsvägen until 2016 when it relocated to Tunaskolan. The International School of Lund Katedralskolan (ISLK) later moved to the Östervångsvägen site.

The Royal Swedish Physiographic Society is a learned society based in Lund.

== Culture ==
The culture in Lund is characterised by the university education and research, and the large student population (now a large part being non-Swedes) and student traditions, such as a student theatre group since 1886. A substantial part of the student night-life is located at student fraternities called &#x27;Nations&#x27;.

Lund Cathedral, the former Catholic and the now Lutheran cathedral in Lund, is the seat of the bishop of Lund of the Church of Sweden.
Lund also has a city theatre (though without a professional local ensemble of its own) and a number of other places for concerts and theatres.

=== Literature, theatre and cinema ===
Numerous prominent figures from the literary world lived and worked in Lund, often in association with the university and theatre. Prominent examples include Esias Tegnér, writer, poet and bishop, and August Strindberg, playwright, novelist and poet. A longer list is given below with other notable natives. The Lund novel is a genre in its own right, a bildungsroman in which a young student experiences life in Lund, Copenhagen and sometimes Österlen whilst maturing as an individual.
The Lund novel is exemplified by the work of Fritiof Nilsson Piraten and Frank Heller.

The spex are a form of student theatre particular to Nordic universities, with a strong tradition in Lund. They are parodistic musical plays, often setting well-known music to new lyrics and mixing up the historical and the present in unconventional intrigues. Comedians Hans Alfredson and Anders Jansson started their careers in the Lund spex.

The concluding scenes in Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s classic film &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot; are set in Lund.

The Lund International Architecture Film Festival is held annually in the autumn.

=== Museums ===

Lund hosts the largest open-air museum of Scania, Kulturen. Kulturen is the second oldest dedicated open-air museum in the world. Founded in 1892 by Georg Karlin, it consists of more than 30 buildings, as well as collections exhibiting Scanian art, crafts, local archaeology and history.

Several museums are attached to the university. The Lund University Historical Museum is based in the Lundagård park. Its exhibitions were updated in 2018 and cover the history, archeology and zoology of Scania. There is a separate Lund Cathedral museum.
The Museum of Sketches for Public Art is a unique museum that documents the development of public artworks. The Vattenhallen Science Center, connected to the university&#x27;s engineering faculty, has an interactive presentation of science and research.

=== Lundakarnevalen ===
The Lund carnival has been held every four years since the mid-nineteenth century: traditional accounts say it originated at a wedding in 1849 (the four-year intervals place the party in 2002, 2006, 2010, etc.). Arranged by the students of the university, from the 1950s onwards the event has grown in size and intensity (with some 5,500 volunteers 2010), but it remains an amateur event. Midway between a music and stage fair, a city festival, and an outpouring of satire, parody and general madness. Some students dress up in costumes, often relating to and poking fun at current issues, and parade in wagons. Others perform humorous skits in the evenings. The carnival revues and other stage entertainments have launched a number of well-known entertainers and actors over the years.

===Music===

Lund has long been a regional centre for classical and church music.

== Transport ==
=== Railways ===
Lund is a railway junction and is well served by rail traffic. The main railway station, Lund Central, is Sweden&#x27;s third busiest railway station, with around 37 000 passengers per day . Another, smaller station serves the suburb of Gunnesbo in the north-west of the city. Lund has been on the Southern Main Line, which connects Malmö and Stockholm, since it opened in 1856. The West Coast Line to Gothenburg branches off the Southern Main Line just north of Lund Central station. Thus there are direct services to all of Sweden&#x27;s three largest cities, as well as to Copenhagen and Helsingør via the Öresund Bridge. Rail services to Denmark, and within Scania and neighbouring counties, are mainly provided by the Øresundståg. These trains are operated jointly by Skånetrafiken in Scania and the Danish State Railways in Denmark. Longer distance services, notably to Stockholm, are provided by SJ. Local traffic is served by the Pågatåg electric multiple units, which provide stopping services within Scania.

=== Cycling ===
Lund has been praised for its cycling infrastructure. There are 4,800 bike parking spaces in the town, including a multi-storey facility at the railway station, over of cyclepaths and cycle lanes, and 43% of journeys within the city take place by bicycle. There has been no increase in car usage for the past 10 years.

=== Buses ===
Since 2019, the bus network in Lund has been licensed to the company Vy Buss, overseen by Skånetrafiken.
They operate green-coloured buses which are electric. The busses run on a total of seven bus lines. A survey carried out on behalf of Region Skåne in 2015 found that 11% of Lund residents used the bus network regularly.

=== Tramway ===
The Lund Tramway opened to the public on December 13, 2020. Plans were approved in 2015 to initiate a 6 km (3.7 mi) tram network to provide faster and higher-capacity commuter transport in central Lund. The 15-minute tram ride connects Lund Central Station with the hospital, Lund University (LTH), Ideon Science Park, the new district of Brunnshög, the MAX IV synchrotron light source, and the European Spallation Source. 

Long-term plans to extend this network to the suburban towns of Bjärred (via Öresundsvägen), Dalby, Staffanstorp and Södra Sandby have been shelved.

=== Major roads ===
Lund has been connected to the motorway network since 1953 when the E22 was opened between Lund and Malmö. The E22 was the first motorway in Sweden, and was originally built around the edge of the town; however following the expansion of the suburbs out to the east in the latter half of the 20th century it now passes through the city. The E22 forms the main north-south trunk route through Lund. The largest east-west road is the multi-lane northern ring road which also passes through the city limits. 
There are also other connections to most major roads in the area, for example the E6 via Riksväg 16, and the Länsväg 108 which connects to the E65.

=== Airports ===
Lund is served by Copenhagen Airport, the largest airport in the Nordic countries, which can be reached by frequent direct trains in about 35 minutes. The second airport in the area, Malmö Airport, is located about 26 kilometres (16 miles) away and is mainly used for domestic flights. There also used to be a very small airstrip, Hasslanda Flygfält, to the south of Lund, mainly used for private and charter flights. The airstrip closed in 2008.

== Economy ==
Lund is a regional centre for high tech companies, several of which are based in the north-east of the city. Companies with offices in Lund include Sony Mobile Communications, Ericsson, Arm Holdings, and Microsoft. The Swedish telecommunications company Doro has its head office in Lund. Gambro, one of the key companies in the development of the artificial kidney, was founded in Lund in 1964 and retains a significant presence in the city. Alfa Laval, the international manufacturer of heat exchangers and separators, have a factory in Lund, and Tetra Pak have their headquarters and part of production in town. Network video camera maker Axis Communications was founded in Lund in 1984 and maintains its headquarters in the city as an independently operated subsidiary of Canon. 
Other important industries include pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and publishing and library services.

Skåne University Hospital and Lund University are major employers, with extensive research facilities. In particular, the Lund Institute of Technology has connections with the high tech industry in the city. A science park, &quot;Ideon Science Park&quot;, was founded in 1983 as a collaboration between Lund University, Lund Municipality and Wihlborgs Fastigheter AB. it hosts about 350 companies, employing 2,700 people. Many of these are high tech companies that have ties to the university.

The 2010s have seen the development of two major research facilities in Lund, both in collaboration with the university. MAX IV is the world&#x27;s most brilliant synchrotron light source and a Swedish national facility. It was inaugurated on 21 June 2016. The European Spallation Source (ESS) is a pulsed neutron source under construction on a site just north of MAX IV. ESS is expected to directly employ about 450 people when it is completed in around 2023.

Tetra Pak was founded in Lund in 1951 by Ruben Rausing. Their principal product is packages and equipment for aseptic packaging of food, principally using plastic-coated cardboard. As of January 2015 Tetra Pak employed around 3,500 staff at their headquarters in Lund.
The pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca used to have a large presence in Lund but their offices closed in 2010. The site was re-developed as a research park named Medicon Village. over 1,200 people worked in more than 100 organisations based at Medicon Village.

<text>Lomma () is a locality and the seat of Lomma Municipality, Skåne County, Sweden. In 2020 it had 13,772 inhabitants.

==History==
Lomma was mentioned in a deed of Cnut the Great under the name &quot;Lumaby&quot; in the year 1085. Skåne&#x27;s cultural centre at the time was the plains surrounding Lund and Dalby known as Lundaslätten.
Lomma was a natural port for customs, shipping and trade, owing to its location at the mouth of the river Höje å, which was the main transport link via to Uppåkra, Lund, Heddinge (now named Kyrkheddinge) and Dalby. Lomma had city status at this time, though it subsequently lost it in favour of Malmö. Until the construction of a bridge across the Höje å in 1682, there was a ferry across the river.

By 1682 there was already a brickworks in Lomma, but the settlement grew after Frans Henrik Kockum founded a brickworks -- at that time one of Sweden&#x27;s largest -- in Lomma in 1854. It produced over 2.5 million bricks which led to the expansion of the harbour, since the sea was the natural means for onward transport.

The soil round Lomma, in addition to being suitable for brick-making, could also be used for cement production. Skånska Cement AB was founded in 1871 and, beginning the following year, manufactured Portland cement in Lomma. The lime, a key ingredient in cement, was sourced in part from Saltholm. Brick and mortar production were seasonal work and at most 350 people worked at the cement factory during the summer season. There was additionally an asbestos cement factory, known as &quot;Lomma Eternit&quot;, which closed in 1977 after workers became ill following exposure to asbestos.

==Geography==
Lomma lies on . It is located to the west of Lund and north of Malmö.

==Sports==
The following sports clubs are located in Lomma:

* GIF Nike
* Lobas
* Lomma FBC

== Notable people ==

* Hanna Bennison (born 2002), footballer for the Sweden national team and Everton

* Filip Jörgensen (born 2002), Swedish born Danish professional footballer for Chelsea F.C.

<text>Kävlinge () is a locality and the seat of Kävlinge Municipality, Skåne County, Sweden with 32,341 inhabitants in 2021.

In 1996, a train containing large amounts of ammonia derailed and around 9,000 people had to be evacuated from the area. This was the biggest evacuation operation in Swedish history.

Near Kävlinge is the site of the Hög passage grave, a Bronze Age barrow covering a neolithic burial chamber. Hög means mound from the Old Norse word &quot;haugr&quot; for hill. The finds from the excavations are in the Lund University Historic Museum.

== Battle of Lund ==
Kävlinge is located north of Lund and has a river passing through called Kävlingeån (translated Kävlinge River). The river played an important role at the events leading up to the Battle of Lund, which was a battle in the Scanian War.

<text>Höör (formerly spelled Hör, ) is a locality and the seat of Höör Municipality, Skåne County, Sweden with 7,865 inhabitants in 2010. 

==Name==
The town was previously known as Hørg (in the 12th century), Hørgh (in the 15th century), and later Hør and Hör. The present, unusual spelling with double &quot;ö&quot; was implemented by the Swedish postal service at the beginning of the 20th century. At that time, it was a common practice in Sweden to write (for &quot;here&quot;) in the address of letters to be delivered within the same town. In order to avoid confusion between letters to be delivered locally and those intended for Hör, the postal service changed the town&#x27;s name to Höör.

== Transport ==

Höör railway station is located on the northern side of the town and a five-minute walk into the central square. It is on the line between Kristianstad and Malmö, where there are frequent commuter trains running beyond Sweden to Copenhagen in Denmark.

The following services call at this station (incomplete):

* Regional train (Øresundståg Regional): Karlskrona – Kristianstad – Hässleholm – Höör – Lund – Malmö – Copenhagen Airport (København Lufthavn/Kastrup) – Copenhagen Central (København H) – Østerport – Helsingør
* Regional train (Skånetrafiken Express): Alvesta – Hässleholm – Höör – Eslöv – Lund – Malmö

<text>Hörby () is a locality and the seat of Hörby Municipality, Skåne County, Sweden with 15 631 inhabitants in 2019.

6 km (3.7 mi) south-east of the center of Hörby is at least since 1959 the location of a radio and TV transmitter. Short wave antennas have been dismantled there in 2011.

==Climate==
Hörby has a transitional maritime-continental climate with moderate seasonal swings by Nordic inland standards. The weather station was opened in 1995 and thus cold records are limited, but nearby Stehag recorded in February 1979. With a January mean just below freezing, Hörby is as of 2021, the southernmost station in Sweden to average a meteorological winter under Nordic definitions of means. Its inland and somewhat elevated location means higher levels of precipitation than in many surrounding areas, common to southern Sweden. As such, heavy snowfall sometimes occur during winter and the more frequent cloud cover in summer renders Hörby quite a bit milder than lower areas around Öresund and Österlen during the warm season.

<text>Höganäs () is a locality and the seat of Höganäs Municipality, Scania County, Sweden. Its population was 14,107 in 2010.

Höganäs is nationally known for its ceramics industry, Höganäs Keramik. Höganäs Keramik is part of Iittala Group.

Höganäs has the main office of Höganäs AB, one of the world&#x27;s biggest iron powder manufacturers with subsidiaries around the world. The Höganäs AB company was founded by Count Eric Ruuth in 1797, which makes it one of Sweden&#x27;s oldest companies.

==History==
Höganäs began as a small fishing village in the parish of Väsby, documented in 1488 in the written form &quot;Høyenæss&quot;. In the middle of the 17th century it had 17 homes. Coal was found in the area, and mining started in 1797. In 1798 a railway with wooden rails was built. It was the first of its kind in Sweden and was used to transport coal from the mine to the harbour. The population started to grow and new dwellings were built for the miners. During the 19th century more industries were built using clay for making ceramic products. Höganäs is well known still today for ceramics. The coal mines, however, were closed in the 1960s. In 1936, when Höganäs got the title of a city it had 6,915 inhabitants. Since 1971 it is the seat of Höganäs Municipality, encompassing the Kullaberg peninsula with totally around 24,000 inhabitants.

In 2009, the city began accepting the euro in its shops, restaurants, banks, and other businesses. More than 30 shops accept euros in cash as a part of a PR attempt.

<text>Hässleholm is a locality and the seat of Hässleholm Municipality, Scania County, Sweden with 18,500 inhabitants in 2011.

==Overview==
Hässleholm was gradually developed from 1860 in connection with the construction of the main Stockholm-to-Malmö railway line. There was no settlement on the spot before the arrival of the railway. The station got its name from a manor situated in the vicinity of a planned railway junction. It gained the city title in 1914 and was then classified as one of Sweden&#x27;s smallest cities. During the 20th century, it developed into a military hub. After the end of the Cold War, most of the military establishments were disbanded or moved to other locations.

In 2000, Hässleholm&#x27;s Cultural Center (&quot;kulturhus&quot;) was opened. It features theatres, a library, a visitors center, and restaurants. East of the town center is the hometown park (&quot;hembygdspark&quot;) with a statue called &quot;Snapphanen&quot;, by the sculptor . The statue reminds of the area&#x27;s history as a center for Scanian insurgents during the 17th-century struggles between Sweden and Denmark.

Some of the town&#x27;s most distinctive architecture is located along First Avenue (&quot;Första avenyn&quot;). The Central Train Station is at the west end of the street, in the very heart of the town. Hässleholm&#x27;s church (built in 1914) lies at the east end of the street. Hotell Statt, the main and oldest hotel, is located on the north side, and on the south side is the town&#x27;s oldest building, which now holds stores, offices, and apartments.

The Swedish representative for the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest, Robin Stjernberg, was born in Hässleholm in 1991.

In 2023, Hässleholm businessman Oddvar Lönnerkrantz told news site Frilagt that Sweden Democrat mayor, Hanna Nilsson had tried to hire him to force a local resident to drop his appeal of the city council&#x27;s purchase of a building for an elderly care home. As a result of these accusations, the Moderate Party and Christian Democrats pulled out of Hässleholm&#x27;s coalition government, and called on Nilsson to resign.

<text>Helsingborg (, , ), is a city and the seat of Helsingborg Municipality, Scania (Skåne), Sweden. It is the second-largest city in Scania (after Malmö) and ninth-largest in Sweden, with a population of 151,404 (2024). Helsingborg is the central urban area of northwestern Scania and Sweden&#x27;s closest point to Denmark: the Danish city Helsingør is clearly visible about to the west on the other side of the Øresund. 

Historic Helsingborg, with its many old buildings, is a scenic coastal city. The buildings are a blend of old-style stone-built churches and a 600-year-old medieval fortress (Kärnan) in the city centre, and more modern commercial buildings. The streets vary from wide avenues to small alley-ways. &quot;Kullagatan&quot;, the main pedestrian shopping street in the city, was the first pedestrian shopping street in Sweden.

==History==
Helsingborg is one of the oldest cities of what is now Sweden. It has been the site of permanent settlement officially since 21 May 1085. Helsingborg&#x27;s geographical position at the narrowest part of Øresund made it very important for Denmark, at that time controlling both sides of that strait. From 1429 Eric of Pomerania introduced the Sound Dues, a levy on all trading vessels passing &quot;through&quot; the sound between Helsingør and Helsingborg. This was one of the main sources of income for the Danish Crown. Crossing traffic, like fishermen, were not subject to the tax, which was initially directed against the Hanseatic League.Following the Dano-Swedish War (1657–1658) and the Treaty of Roskilde Denmark had to give up all territory on the southern Scandinavian peninsula, and Helsingborg became part of Sweden. King Charles X Gustav of Sweden landed here on 5 March 1658 to take personal possession of the Scanian lands and was met by a delegation led by the bishop of the Diocese of Lund, Peder Winstrup. At that time the town had a population of barely 1,000 people.

Its situation on a conflict-ridden border caused problems for Helsingborg. Denmark recaptured Scania twice, but could not hold it. The last Danish attempt to regain Scania was in 1710, when 14,000 men landed on the shores near Helsingborg. The Battle of Helsingborg was fought on 10 March just outside the city, which was badly affected. It took a long time to recover; even in 1770 the city had only 1,321 inhabitants and was still growing slowly.

On 20 October 1811, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, Marshal of France and crown prince-elect of Sweden (later King Charles XIV John) took his first step on Swedish soil in Helsingborg on his journey from Paris to Stockholm.

From the middle of the 19th century onwards, Helsingborg was one of the fastest-growing cities of Sweden, increasing its population from 4,000 in 1850 to 20,000 in 1890 and 56,000 in 1930 due to industrialization. From 1892, a train ferry was put in service, connecting Helsingborg with its Danish sister city Helsingør. A tramway network was inaugurated in 1903 and closed down in 1967.

Following the Swedish orthography reform of 1906, the spelling of many place names in Sweden was modernized. In 1912, it was decided to use the form &quot;Hälsingborg&quot;. In preparation for the local government reform in 1971, Hälsingborg city council proposed that the new, enlarged municipality should be spelled &quot;Helsingborg&quot;; this form was adopted by the government of Sweden from 1 January 1971.

In World War II, Helsingborg was among the most important drop-off points for the rescue of Denmark&#x27;s Jewish population during the Holocaust. Adolf Hitler had ordered that all Danish Jews were to be arrested and deported to the concentration camps on Rosh HaShanah, the Jewish New Year which fell on 2 October 1943. When Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz, a German maritime attaché received word of the order on 28 September 1943, he shared it with political and Jewish community leaders. Using the name Elsinore Sewing Club (Danish: Helsingør Syklub) as a cover for messages, the Danish population formed an Underground Railroad of sorts, moving Jews away from the closely watched Copenhagen docks to spots farther away, especially Helsingør, just two miles across the Øresund from Helsingborg. Hundreds of civilians hid their fellow Danish citizens—Jews—in their houses, farm lofts and churches until they could board them onto Danish fishing boats, personal pleasure boats and ferry boats. In the span of three nights, Danes had smuggled over 7200 Jews and 680 non-Jews (gentile family members of Jews or political activists) across the Øresund, to safety in Sweden, with one of the main destinations at Helsingborg.

==Climate==
Helsingborg has an oceanic climate (Cfb) typical of southern Sweden, although its winters are very mild for a location at such a high latitude. Although the temperature differences between seasons are significant, Helsingborg often lacks a meteorological winter with both January and February averaging just above the freezing point in terms of mean temperatures. Summers are warm and comparatively long by Swedish standards, with summer arriving earlier and fall later than virtually all areas of Sweden, aside from other parts of Skåne. Helsingborg &amp; nearby surroundings also have a history with being hit by tornadoes. On 8 August 1947, a High-end F1/T3 Tornado hit the Ramlösa district of Helsingborg, causing moderate damage to a farm. Greenhouses were damaged or destroyed, a stall sustained deroofing, a shed were blown away and a tree were snapped. On 16 August 2007, downtown Helsingborg were impacted by an F1 Tornado, damaging a school and snapping trees. On 22 June 2014, a Waterspout was observed outside Helsingborg. On 27 August 2018, the Eskilsminne district of Helsingborg were hit by an F0 Tornado. Some roofs sustained minor damage.
==Demographics==
113,816 live in the city of Helsingborg as of 2020, up from 104,250 inhabitants in 2015. 149,280 live in the municipality, with the city being by far the most populated one. Helsingborg is the second-largest city in Scania (after Malmö) and ninth-largest in Sweden.

<text>Eslöv (;) is a town and the seat of Eslöv Municipality, Skåne County, Sweden with 19,598 inhabitants as of 2018.

Eslöv is part of the Öresund Region, and the Malmö Metropolitan Area.

==History==

According to a map from 1717, Eslöv village was originally located in the current crossing Västergatan-Remmarlövsvägen.

When the Southern Main Line, already passing through cities such as Stockholm and Malmö, was built through Eslöv the town&#x27;s growth took off. On 4 October 1858 the first trains rolled on the southern main line through Eslöv. On 1 July 1865 the railway from Eslöv to Landskrona and Helsingborg (see Rååbanan) was taken into use and on 1 May 1866 the railway opened to Ystad. Eslöv had become a significant railroad link, and trade to and from the resort increased significantly. In 1897, Eslöv-Hörby railway opened, which was later extended to Kristianstad. In 1898, the railway Eslöv-Röstånga was taken into use, which was later extended to Klippan.

=== Healthcare ===
In 1865, Eslöv gets its first doctor, Walter Ström. In 1870, Eslöv&#x27;s first pharmacy opens. In 1942, a dental clinic and a provisional child care center are established. In 1969, the Tåbelund emergency medical center, &quot;The triple doctor station&quot;, opens and in 1985, the health center Kärråkra is established.

=== Water, gas and electricity ===
In 1884, the first telephone lines were planted in Eslöv and at the end of the year, there were 30 subscribers. In 1905, the water tower at Kvarngatan, the waterworks at Villavägen and the gas plant at Gasverksgatan were ready for use. The gas plant was discontinued in the late 1950s and the buildings were demolished in 1962. In 1968, the new water tower on Fäladen was taken into operation and thus replaced the old water tower.

AB Sydvatten was founded in 1966 by the cities of Malmö, Helsingborg, Lund, Landskrona and Eslöv. Subsequently, the municipalities of Burlöv, Höganäs, Kävlinge, Lomma, Staffanstorp, Svalöv, Svedala and Vellinge have also joined. The Bolmen tunnel began being built in 1975 for it to be put into use in October 1987. The water runs from Lake Bolmen in Småland via an 8 mile long tunnel to Perstorp and then into a 2.5 mile long raw water pipeline to Ringsjöverket in Stehag where it is purified.

In 1909, a treatment plant was built on the peat bog in the south, the current Edelbergsparken. The same year, the City Council appointed a committee with the task of looking more closely at the electricity issue and in 1911 the first transformer station was ready. In the 1920s, the gas lamps in Eslöv were changed to electric lighting. A new treatment plant was ready in Ellinge in 1937 and a new main transformer station was commissioned in 1952.

In 1920, the first fire engine was purchased for Eslöv. In 1925, the fire brigade was replaced by Eslöv&#x27;s first professional fire service. In 1985, district heating was built in Eslöv.

=== Administrative belongings ===
Eslöv was a village in the Sallerup&#x27;s parish which, after the municipal reform in 1862, belonged to Sallerup&#x27;s country municipality.

In 1875, part of the county municipality was broken out and Eslöv&#x27;s &quot;köping&quot; (market town) was formed, where most of the town&#x27;s buildings were included. On 17 August 1894 Västra Sallerup&#x27;s municipal community was established in the county municipality for settlement outside the köping area. Eslöv&#x27;s purchase accounted for 56.36 hectares and was roughly limited by Repslagaregatan, Trulsagatan (current Västerlånggatan), Trehäradsvägen, Köpingskolan (current eastern school) and Köpingsparken (current Badhusparken) In 1909, Eslöv grew by incorporating the area Västra Sallerup&#x27;s municipal community with Eslöv&#x27;s köping. On January 1, 1811, Eslöv received city rights. In 1912 Eslöv&#x27;s city was expanded again by incorporating Ellinge Sjöhus, belonging to Borlunda parish. In 1940, the built-up parts, 150 hectares, were incorporated by western Sallerups county municipality. In 1952, the city&#x27;s area grew from 7 to 30 km2 when the remaining parts, 1,960 hectares, were incorporated from Västra Sallerup&#x27;s county municipality, as well as 193 hectares from Trollenäs land municipality / Socken and 226.5 hectares from Borlunda county municipality after which. In 1967 and 1969, further extensions were made before the municipality of Eslöv in 1971 became a seat.

Eslöv belonged to Västra Sallerups congregation, which in 1952 was converted to the Eslöv parish.

The town belonged to Harjager&#x27;s district court until 1874, thereafter it belonged to in Rönneberg&#x27;s, Onsjö and Harjager&#x27;s district court until 1916 then, until 1948, it belonged to Eslöv&#x27;s district court in Frosta and Eslöv&#x27;s court case. From 1948 to 1971, the town of Frosta and Eslöv&#x27;s court of law was incorporated, which in 1971 was converted to Eslöv&#x27;s court case, which in 2002 went up in Lund&#x27;s court case.

Eslöv Airport (ESME), a local airstrip, was originally used for mail transport, but was also used for military training during World War II. Now it is mostly used by private pilots and parachutists.

== Industry and enterprise ==

=== Banking ===
In 1866, Eslöv&#x27;s Savings Bank was founded mainly thanks to Dr Walter Ström and post-exporter Carl Håkansson. The bank&#x27;s first working day was 27 October that year. Onsjö Härads Sparbank was founded on 18 July 1861 at Trollenäs Castle where activities existed for 25 years. The branch office was opened after a few years in Marieholm, where the head office moved in 1890. A branch office was opened in Eslöv in 1902. Eslöv&#x27;s Savings Bank and Onsjö Härads Sparbank merged under the name Eslöv Onsjö Sparbank which was later merged with Lundabygdens Sparbank and formed Sparbanken Finn.

=== Industrial history ===
Grain trading took place early at the station, which was popularly known as Eslöv&#x27;s börs (stock exchange). In the 1870s, there were, among other things, two breweries, a horse slaughterhouse, six bread bakeries and several bookbinders, lathes, thin-binders and stonemasons in Eslöv. However, only four industrial companies were officially registered in the town; Rencks Yllefabrik, Ljungberg&#x27;s foundry, A. J. Wahlgren&#x27;s tannery and Ättiksfabriken. Together, they employed some forty employees.

=== Grain and wood products ===
In 1865 Carl Engström started a company, named after himself, that grew into one of southern Sweden&#x27;s largest in cereals, seeds, fodder and agricultural machinery. In 1913, the company was converted into a limited liability company.

In 1868, a logger, Nils Johnson, founded the movement that later became AB Nils Johnson &amp; Co. In the beginning, flour and feed products dominated, but later came also a joinery factory, a garden, planing, glassworks and more. When Nils Johnson died in 1907, his son Johannes Johnson took over the company and developed it into one of the more important in the wood products industry. In 1929, the company became a limited company. The company became Moberg &amp; Co and is today known as Optimera.
=== Textile Industry ===
Klädesfabriken, mentioned in the health care protocol for 1878, is Renck&#x27;s wool factory, Eslöv&#x27;s first real industry, which was started in 1869 by the two German immigrants Ferdinand Renck (1821–1886) and Johan Renck (1845–1895; father of Lorentz Renck). There was a charity, spinning mill and a clothing factory where, among other things, Eslöv&#x27;s felt plaids were manufactured. The factory, which was completely destroyed in a fire in 1898, was located at Joel Sallius park in front of Medborgarhuset.
In 1879 Carl Peter Sahlin started a coloring movement in Eslöv. In 1880 he bought the old dairy premises opposite the plantation Trekanten. The movement was expanded with the addition of spinning and weaving. The son Albert Sahlin (1868-1936) then founded Sahlins Konfektion AB, which was especially known for the manufacturing of children&#x27;s clothing. Sahlin&#x27;s clothing, which was located at Malmgatan between Västerlånggatan and Kanalgatan (current HN Furniture), was closed in 1973.

In 1905, Eslövs Yllefabrik was founded by Carl Herrman. In 1898 Herrman, together with his colleague Jöns Hansson from Malmö Yllefabriks AB, founded Marieholms Yllefabriks AB. Eslöv&#x27;s Yllefabrik, which was located on Gasverksgatan opposite the present East School&#x27;s gymnasium, was for a long time the only textile factory in Sweden that had machines for printing colors on the fabric. In 1929, the company was converted into a limited liability company. In 1935, the factory received the country&#x27;s first ring spinning machine. In 1955, the company was taken over by Manufaktur AB in Malmö with the subsidiary Malmö Yllefabriks AB. The factory in Eslöv was closed at year-end 1958/1959. In 1939 Erik Wedberg founded the company, La Reine, with manufacturing in various places in the city. In 1963 a factory was built at Trehäradsvägen just east of the railway. Manufacturing consisted of, among other things, coats and nylon rainwear.

=== Metal ===
The foundry mentioned in the health care protocol for 1878 is Ljungbergska Foundry. In 1872 Nils Håkansson started a forging workshop in Eslöv which he sold in 1878 to manufacturer J Ljungberg and the name changed to Ljungbergska Gjuteriet. In 1889, Lars Åkerman, who was previously a co-owner of Hvilans Mekaniska Verkstad in Kristianstad, bought the company and named it Åkermans Gjuteri and Mekaniska Verkstad. Åkerman died in 1897 and the following year the company was converted to Aktiebolaget Åkermans Gjuteri and Mekaniska Verkstad. During the 1920s, road rollers and graders were manufactured. In 1938, Åkermans moved from central Eslöv, where Medborgarhuset is today, to premises on Bruksgatan in eastern Eslöv. From 1939, Åkermans began producing excavators, the product that made the company internationally known. The first excavator, an Åkerman 300, was delivered to Sjöbo Cementgjuteri. In December 1965 Åkermans was introduced to the stock exchange. On 1 December 1998, Volvo Excavator (formerly Åkermans) announced that it was planning to shut down its production of excavators in Eslöv and thus a successful epoch of Eslöv&#x27;s industrial history in the grave.

== Notability ==

Sweden&#x27;s tallest wooden house, &quot;Lagerhuset&quot;, is located in the city. In 2007, a large-scale renovation of the building took place and it was converted into an apartment complex. The building was originally built as a grain silo for cereal during World War I.

The medicine &quot;Salubrin&quot; was invented in Eslöv. Several other big companies also have their main offices in the town.

The Swedish comedian Johan Glans was born and raised in Eslöv.

Swedish professional golfer Ludvig Åberg was born and raised in Eslöv. 

==Sports==
The following sports clubs are located in Eslöv:
* Eslövs AI – has won national championships in table tennis and wrestling.
* Eslövs BK

The Eslövs Motorstadion existed from 1948 to 1961. It was built by Motorklubben Gnistan and mainly used for motorcycle speedway. It staged a qualifying round of the Speedway World Championship in 1953.

<text>Båstad () is a locality and the seat of Båstad Municipality, Scania County, Sweden, with approximately 5,000 permanent residents. It is however one of Sweden&#x27;s most typical summer resorts. The population is presumably more than twice as large between April and September, and even larger during July. Its municipality follows a similar pattern: some 15,000 permanent residents, but more than 30,000 during July. Some villages within the municipality are almost empty during the winter, but have more than 2,000 &quot;summer guests&quot; during July. Torekov is a good example of this.

Within Sweden, Båstad is well known for tennis. The largest centre court in Sweden is located in the town&#x27;s centre, and can take more than 5,000 attendants. Several top national players, such as Björn Borg, Mats Wilander and Stefan Edberg, have played tennis in Båstad.

==Geography==

The town of Båstad is located in a sheltered bay with the Hallandian ridge stretching behind it. The town borders the shore, whereafter the terrain raises until the dense vegetation of the ridge takes over.

==History==
The first city privileges were granted in the 14th or 15th century, when the area belonged to Denmark. The first certain date is 1513 when it was re-granted. At the time, the name in print was &quot;Botstœdœ&quot;, which would translate to &quot;Boat (landing) place&quot;.

In 1658, the area was conquered by Sweden, and Båstad was given new &quot;special&quot; privileges in 1664, because it was of too insignificant size to receive the full royal charter as one of Sweden&#x27;s cities. The minor privilege allowed the town to be used for commerce, handicraft and hostelry. The minor privilege was in effect until 1858 when it got proper rights as a &quot;merchant town&quot;, or &quot;köping&quot;. It has been the seat of Båstad Municipality since 1971.

Båstad is known for its tennis tournament Swedish Open on the ATP Tour, held each summer since 1948. The tournament boasts the largest number of courts in the country, and has fostered many internationally successful tennis players, such as Magnus Larsson. It attracts some 20,000 visitors and puts the town in a festive mood for a few weeks. Since 2009, the women&#x27;s WTA tournament, previously held in Stockholm, also is played in Båstad as part of the Swedish Open.

The city is also home of the Troentorp Clog, formerly known as Båstad Clogs. Troentorp Clogs have been handcrafted in Båstad since 1907 and continue to be produced with the original wooden design.

The botanist Carl Adolph Agardh was born in Båstad in 1785.

==Sights==

The Church of Båstad or Saint Mary&#x27;s Church is located in central Båstad. It was constructed in the 15th century. It is a Romanesque church, and contains several wall paintings from various centuries; a madonna image; and a Danish altarpiece, among other things.

A few kilometers outside of Båstad there is a large garden called Norrviken Gardens, which was founded by Rudolf Abelin in the 1900. It once had been chosen as the most beautiful park in Sweden, and the second most beautiful in Europe in 2006.
==Notable people==
* Carl Adolph Agardh (1785–1859), botanist
* Mari Andersson (born 1986), former tennis player
* Arne Bjerhammar (1917–2011), geodesist notable for independently describing Moore–Penrose inverse in 1951
* Anders Järryd (born 1961), former tennis player
* Erik Paulsson (born 1942), billionaire businessman
* Anders Silwer (born 1959), former Swedish Air Force officer.

<doc id="1019402" wikidata="Q2528844" url="?curid=1019402" title="Ballincollig">
<text>Ballincollig () is a suburban town within the administrative area of Cork city in Ireland. It is located on the western side of Cork city, beside the River Lee on the R608 road. In 2016 it was the largest town in County Cork, at which time the Ballincollig Electoral Division had a population of 18,621 people. It is located beyond the green belt from the suburbs of Bishopstown and Wilton. Historically home to the Ballincollig Royal Gunpowder Mills which is now a Regional Park, the town has seen much growth in recent years as a satellite of Cork city. In 2024, Ballincollig was named the tidiest town in Ireland. 

==History==
Originally known as Maghmakeer as early as the 14th century, the town eventually came to be known after the Coll (or Cole) family who built Ballincollig Castle during the reign of Edward III, before selling it to the Barrett family in either 1468 or 1469. The castle was taken from Andrew Barrett by rebels in 1641, but they were expelled by English Parliamentary forces under Murrough O&#x27;Brien, Earl Inchiquinn, in 1645. It was garrisoned for James II in 1689, during the Williamite war in Ireland, then remained unoccupied after his defeat, and fell into decay.

The Ballincollig Royal Gunpowder Mills were opened in 1794 by Charles Henry Leslie, a prominent Cork businessman. Eleven years later, the mills were bought by the British, who were preparing for war with Napoleon, and the barracks were built to protect the supply of gunpowder. It was one of the largest gunpowder mills in the British Isles. In 1837, the mill employed several hundred workers, and by 1880, Ballincollig was one of the largest industrial establishments in Cork, with the mill employing many men and boys from the area.

With the closure of the Gunpowder Mills in the early 1900s, Ballincollig became little more than a small village on the road from Cork city to the larger market town of Macroom. The 3rd Royal Munster Fusiliers (Reserve) Battalion were stationed there during the Great War. Other Regiments stationed in the Barracks before it was decommissioned were 1st Field Artillery Regiment and 8th Field Artillery Regiment (FCÁ). The recently decommissioned Murphy Barracks was a major source of employment. In the 1970s, Ballincollig developed as much more of a satellite town, with many housing developments constructed around the old village, and housing people who worked in Cork city or its suburbs. This expansion continued through the late 80s and 90s. Consequently, the town&#x27;s population has risen dramatically, particularly with the westward expansion of the town and Ballincollig grew to be largest town in the county.

In 2019, as part of the boundary expansion of Cork City, Ballincollig was brought within the administrative area of Cork City Council.

==Religion==
Two Catholic churches are located in the town. The modern &#x27;Church of Christ Our Light&#x27; (designed by a local architectural firm) is located on the west side of the town, while the old &#x27;Church of St Mary and St John&#x27; is located near the centre of the town, on Station Road.

The Bible Baptist Church meets in the Westgate Foundation on the west end of town. The church is associated with the Cork Bible Institute and other Gospel ministries.

Other religious groups including Hindus, Sikhs, and Greek Orthodox also have services at various locations in Ballincollig.

==Demographics ==
As of the 2011 census, Ballincollig was 87% Catholic, 7% other religions, 5% no religion, with 1% not stated. Ethnically, the town is 83% white Irish, 10% other white, 3% black, 2% Asian, 1% other, and 1% not stated.

==Amenities==
The amenities located in Ballincollig include a library, a multiplex cinema, playgrounds and shopping centres. Ballincollig Regional Park, a large park which includes the former gunpowder mill site, contains a number structures and canals associated with its former industrial use. The park contains several sports pitches, a playground and a series of marked trails.

Ballincollig is home to several crèches, five primary schools, and two secondary schools. The two secondary schools in Ballincollig are Coláiste Choilm and Ballincollig Community School. Ballincollig Community School is located in West Ballincollig and is next to the &#x27;Church of Christ Our Light&#x27;. Coláiste Choilm is located in East Ballincollig and is near a doctor&#x27;s practice and the town centre of Ballincollig.

==Transport &amp; communications==

===Rail===
The Cork to Macroom rail line served Station House (at the south end of Station Road). Ballincollig railway station was opened on 12 May 1866, closed to passenger traffic on 1 July 1935, closed to goods traffic on 10 March 1947 and finally closed altogether on 1 December 1953.

A number of proposals, such as the &#x27;Project Ireland 2040&#x27; transport plan, include a potential feasibility study into a possible suburban light rail project in the area connecting Ballincollig to Mahon point via UCC and Cork city centre.

===Bus===
Ballincollig is served by a number of Bus Éireann bus routes. These include route 220 (to Carrigaline, via UCC, Cork city centre, and Douglas), route 220X, (similar route via the Lee Fields rather than Bishopstown), and route 233 (Cork city centre to Macroom via Ballincollig).

===Roads===
Ballincollig was situated on the N22 from Cork to Tralee. A bypass around the town was opened in September 2004, which resulted in reduced journey times from Cork to Killarney on the N22 and reduced traffic volumes through the town centre. The N40 starts on the eastern side of the town that continues as the Cork southern bypass. The N40 and N22 both share exit 1.

The former alignment of the N22 is now the R608 road which goes through the town centre.

==Clubs and sport==
Notable sports clubs in the town include: Ballincollig GAA Club and Ballincollig RFC. Mycro Sportsgear, which manufactures equipment for hurling, is based in Ballincollig.

<doc id="1019403" wikidata="Q492528" url="?curid=1019403" title="Brava, Cape Verde">
<text>Brava (Portuguese for &quot;wild&quot; or &quot;brave&quot;) is an island in Cape Verde, and is part of the Sotavento group, in the central Atlantic Ocean. At , it is the smallest inhabited island of the Cape Verde archipelago, but at the same time the greenest. First settled in the early 16th century, its population grew after Mount Fogo on neighbouring Fogo erupted in 1680. For more than a century, its main industry was whaling, but the island economy is now primarily agricultural.

==History==
Brava was discovered in 1462 by the Portuguese explorer Diogo Afonso. There is no evidence of human presence on the Cape Verde islands before the arrival of the Portuguese. Around 1620 the population of Brava started with the arrival of settlers from Madeira and the Azores. Settlement of Brava took a rise in 1680 when it received many refugees from the nearby larger island of Fogo after its volcano erupted and covered the island with ash. Frequent pirate attacks forced the population towards the interior of the island, where the town Nova Sintra was founded around 1700.

Around 1720, the fungus &quot;Roccella tinctoria&quot; was discovered, which was traded as a textile dye. From the end of the 18th century, whaling ships from North America started hunting whales around the Azores and the Cape Verde Islands. They used the harbours of Brava (Fajã de Água and Furna) to stock up on supplies and drinking water. They hired men from Brava as sailors, and several of these men from Brava settled around the Massachusetts whaling port of New Bedford.

==Geography==

The island of Brava is 10.5 km long (north to south) and its width is 9.3 km. Its area is . Practically the whole island is a stratovolcano. It lies in the lee of the enormous Fogo volcano. Volcanic activity on the island has been mainly located along three lines, which all intersect at the crest of ground that forms the highest part of the island. Brava has no documented historical eruptions, but its youthful volcanic morphology and the fact that earthquake swarms still occur indicate the potential for future eruptions; its last eruption was during the Holocene era. 13% of the island area is forested.

North of Brava are several uninhabited islets; the largest ones are Ilhéu de Cima and Ilhéu Grande. Monte Fontainhas is the highest point on the island, reaching 976 metres elevation.

===Climate===
Being highly mountainous this island has a quite diverse climate. Brava island has moderate arid climate (&quot;BWh&quot; according to Köppen–Geiger climate classification system) along the coast and semi-arid mild tropical climate &quot;BSh&quot; with very balanced temperatures year round in the interior. The average annual temperature on the coast is about , decreasing to some in the mountains. There can be remarkably cool weather with warmer wet season starting in June and ending in November with colder dry season starting in December and ending in May.

==Municipality==

Administratively, the island of Brava is covered by one municipality, &quot;Concelho da Brava&quot;. This municipality consists of two &quot;freguesias&quot; (civil parishes): São João Baptista and Nossa Senhora do Monte. The municipal seat is the city Nova Sintra.

===Politics===

Since 2012, the Movement for Democracy (MpD) is the ruling party of the municipality, and its president is Orlando da Luz Vieira Balla. The results of the latest elections, in 2016:

==Sports==
There are several football clubs on Boa Vista, organised in the Brava Regional Football Association.

==Infrastructure==

The Esperadinha Airport, inaugurated in 1992, was closed in 2004 because of persisting strong winds. The village of Furna has a commercial port, the other port is Fajã de Água which is only used for fishing. Ferries to the islands of Fogo and Santiago depart from Furna. On Brava the villages may be reached by &quot;Aluguer&quot; bus. There is no fixed schedule, as the aluguers travel only when there are sufficient passengers. A few taxis are available as well.

==Notable residents==

*Eugénio Tavares, musician; he used the traditional morna and wrote in Cape Verdean Creole. A statue dedicated to Eugénio Tavares is in the main square of Vila Nova Sintra, surrounded by a garden with trees, sunflowers, flowers, grass and other types of plants.

<text>The Motorcycle Diaries () is a posthumously published memoir of the Marxist revolutionary Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara. It traces his early travels, as a 23-year-old medical student, with his friend Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old biochemist. Leaving Buenos Aires, Argentina, in January 1952 on the back of a sputtering single cylinder 1939 Norton 500cc dubbed &quot;La Poderosa&quot; (&quot;The Mighty One&quot;), they desired to explore the South America they only knew from books. During the formative odyssey Guevara is transformed by witnessing the social injustices of exploited mine workers, persecuted communists, ostracized lepers, and the tattered descendants of a once-great Inca civilization. By journey&#x27;s end, they had travelled for a &quot;symbolic nine months&quot; by motorcycle, steamship, raft, horse, bus, and hitchhiking, covering more than across places such as the Andes, the Atacama Desert, and the Amazon River Basin.

The book has been described as a classic coming-of-age story: a voyage of adventure and self-discovery that is both political and personal. Originally marketed by Verso as &quot;&quot;Das Kapital&quot; meets &quot;Easy Rider&quot;&quot;, &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot; has been a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller several times.

== Pre-expedition ==

Ernesto Guevara spent long periods traveling around Latin America during his studies of medicine, beginning in 1948, at the University of Buenos Aires. In January 1950, Guevara attempted his first voyage. He traversed through the northern provinces of Argentina on a bicycle on which he had installed a small engine. He arrived at San Francisco del Chañar, near Córdoba, where his friend Alberto Granado ran the dispensary of the leper-centre. This experience allowed Guevara to have long conversations with the patients about their disease.

This pre-expedition gave Guevara a taste of what would be experienced in his more extensive South American travels. The journey broke new ground for him in activities that would become central to his life: travelling and writing a diary. His own father said that it was preparation for his subsequent long journeys across South America.

Guevara relied upon the hospitality of strangers that he encountered, as he and Granado would throughout their later travels. For example, following a puncture, he flagged down a lorry to take him to his next destination. In another instance, in Loreto, he asked for hospitality from a local police officer when he had nowhere to stay. The trip encouraged Guevara&#x27;s style of traveling that would be seen in the Motorcycle Diaries. By the time he reached Jujuy, he had decided that the best way to get to know and to understand a country was by visiting hospitals and meeting the patients that they housed. He was not interested in the sites for tourists, and preferred meeting the people in custody of the police or the strangers that he met en route with whom he struck up a conversation. Guevara had seen the parallel existence of the poverty and deprivation faced by the native populations. Guevara also noted &#x27;turbulence&#x27; in the region under the Río Grande, but having not actually crossed this river, Guevara, historian Jon Lee Anderson argues, used it as a symbol of the United States, and this was an early glimmer of the notion of neocolonial exploitation that would obsess him in later life. For the young Guevara, the trip had been an education.

It was the success of his Argentinian &quot;raid&quot;, as he put it, that awakened in him a desire to explore the world and prompted the commencing of new travel plans.

Upon completion of his bicycle journey, &quot;El Gráfico&quot;, a sports magazine in Argentina, published a picture of Guevara on his bike. The company that manufactured the engine Ernesto had adapted to his bicycle tried to use it for advertising, claiming it was very strong since Guevara had gone on such a long tour using its power.

While he continued studying, he also worked as a nurse on trading and petroleum ships of the Argentine national shipping-company. This allowed Guevara to travel from the south of Argentina to Brazil, Venezuela and Trinidad.

==Expedition==


In January 1952, Guevara&#x27;s older friend, Alberto Granado, a biochemist, and Guevara, decided to take a year off from their medical studies to embark on a trip they had spoken of making for years: traversing South America on a motorcycle, which has metaphorically been compared to carbureted version of Don Quixote&#x27;s Rocinante. Guevara and the 29-year-old Granado soon set off from Buenos Aires, Argentina, astride a 1939 Norton 500 cc motorcycle they named &quot;La Poderosa II&quot; (&quot;The Mighty II&quot;) with the idea of eventually spending a few weeks volunteering at the San Pablo Leper colony in Peru on the banks of the Amazon River. In total, the journey took Guevara through Argentina, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Panama, and to Miami, before returning home to Buenos Aires.

The trip was carried out in the face of some opposition by Guevara&#x27;s parents, who knew that their son was both a severe asthmatic and a medical student close to completing his studies. However, Granado, himself a doctor, assuaged their concerns by guaranteeing that Guevara would return to finish his degree (which he ultimately did).

The first stop: Miramar, Argentina, a small resort where Guevara&#x27;s girlfriend, Chichina, was spending the summer with her upper-class family. Two days stretched into eight, and upon leaving, Chichina gave Guevara a gold bracelet. The two men crossed into Chile on February 14. At one point they introduced themselves as internationally renowned leprosy experts to a local newspaper, which wrote a glowing story about them. The travelers later used the press clipping as a way to score meals and other favors with locals along the way.

In reference to his experience in Chile, Guevara also writes: &quot;The most important effort that needs to be done is to get rid of the uncomfortable &#x27;Yankee-friend&#x27;. It is especially at this moment an immense task, because of the great amount of dollars they have invested here and the convenience of using economical pressure whenever they believe their interests are being threatened.&quot;

Unable to get a boat to Easter Island as they intended, they headed north, where Guevara&#x27;s political consciousness began to stir as he and Granado moved into mining country. They visited Chuquicamata copper mine, the world&#x27;s largest open-pit mine and the primary source of Chile&#x27;s wealth. While getting a tour of the mine he asked how many men died in its creation. At the time it was run by U.S. mining monopolies of Anaconda and Kennecott and thus was viewed by many as a symbol of &quot;imperialist gringo domination&quot;. A meeting with a homeless communist couple in search of mining work made a particularly strong impression on Guevara, who wrote: &quot;By the light of the single candle ... the contracted features of the worker gave off a mysterious and tragic air ... the couple, frozen stiff in the desert night, hugging one another, were a live representation of the proletariat of any part of the world.&quot;

In reference to the oppression against the Communist party in Chile, which at the time was outlawed, Guevara said: &quot;It&#x27;s a great pity, that they repress people like this. Apart from whether collectivism, the &#x27;communist vermin&#x27;, is a danger to decent life, the communism gnawing at his entrails was no more than a natural longing for something better, a protest against persistent hunger transformed into a love for this strange doctrine, whose essence he could never grasp but whose translation, &#x27;bread for the poor&#x27;, was something he understood and, more importantly, that filled him with hope. Needless to say, workers at Chuquicamata were in a living Hell.&quot;

In Peru, Guevara was impressed by the old Inca civilization, forced to ride in trucks with Indians and animals after &quot;The Mighty One&quot; broke down. As a result, he began to develop a fraternity with the indigenous campesinos. In March 1952 they both arrived at the Peruvian Tacna. After a discussion about the poverty in the region, Guevara referred in his notes to the words of Cuban poet José Marti: &quot;I want to link my destiny to that of the poor of this world&quot;. In May they arrived in Lima, Peru and during this time Guevara met doctor Hugo Pesce, a Peruvian scientist, director of the national leprosy program, and an important local Marxist. They discussed several nights until the early morning and years later Che identified these conversations as being very important for his evolution in attitude towards life and society.

In May, Guevara and Granado left for the leper colony of San Pablo in the Peruvian Amazon Rainforest, arriving there in June. During his stay Guevara complained about the miserable way the people and sick of that region had to live. Guevara also swam once from the side of the Amazon River where the doctors stayed, to the other side of the river where the leper patients lived, a considerable distance of . He describes how there were no clothes, almost no food, and no medication. However, Guevara was moved by his time with the lepers, remarking that

After giving consultations and treating patients for a few weeks, Guevara and Granado left aboard the Mambo-Tango raft (shown) for Leticia, Colombia, via the Amazon River.

On July 6, 1952, while visiting Bogotá, Colombia, he wrote a letter to his mother. In the letter he described the conditions under the right-wing government of Conservative Laureano Gómez as the following: &quot;There is more repression of individual freedom here than in any country we&#x27;ve been to, the police patrol the streets carrying rifles and demand your papers every few minutes&quot;. He also goes on to describe the atmosphere as &quot;tense&quot; and &quot;suffocating&quot;, even hypothesizing that &quot;a revolution may be brewing&quot;. Guevara was correct in his prognostication, as a military coup in 1953 would take place, bringing General Gustavo Rojas to power. However, the civil war the country was experiencing never went away; rather, tensions were brewing and were leading to an escalation in various regions in Colombia which led to the Colombian civil war, known as La Violencia.

Later that month, Guevara arrived in Caracas, Venezuela, and from there decided to return to Buenos Aires to finish his studies in medical science. However, prior to his return, he travelled by cargo plane to Miami, where the airplane&#x27;s technical problems delayed him one month. To survive, he worked as a waiter and washed dishes in a Miami bar.

Although he admitted throughout that as a vagabond traveler he could only see things at surface level, he did attempt to delve beneath the sheen of the places he visited. On one occasion, he went to see a woman dying of tuberculosis, leaving appalled by the failings of the public health system. This experience led him to ruminate the following reflection: &quot;How long this present order, based on the absurd idea of caste, will last is not within my means to answer, but it&#x27;s time that those who govern spent less time publicizing their own virtues and more money, much more money, funding socially useful works.&quot;

Witnessing the widespread endemic poverty, oppression and disenfranchisement throughout Latin America, and influenced by his readings of Marxist literature, Guevara later decided that the only solution for the region&#x27;s structural inequalities was armed revolution. His travels and readings throughout this journey also led him to view Latin America not as a group of separate nations, but as a single entity requiring a continent-wide strategy for liberation from what he viewed as imperialist and neo-colonial domination. His conception of a borderless, united, Hispanic-America, sharing a common &quot;mestizo&quot; bond, was a theme that would prominently recur during his later activities and transformation from Ernesto the traveler into Che Guevara the iconic revolutionary.

==Transformation==
Although it is considered to have been formative, scholars have largely ignored this period of Guevara&#x27;s life. However, historians and biographers now agree that the experience had a profound impact on Guevara, who later became one of the most famous guerrilla leaders in history. &quot;His political and social awakening has very much to do with this face-to-face contact with poverty, exploitation, illness, and suffering&quot;, said Carlos M. Vilas, a history professor at the Universidad Nacional de Lanús in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

In May 2005, Alberto Granado described their journey to the BBC, stating: &quot;The most important thing was to realise that we had a common sensibility for the things that were wrong and unjust.&quot; According to Granado, their time at the leper colony of San Pablo in the Amazon also proved pivotal. Recalling that they shared everything with the sick people and describing Guevara&#x27;s wave on departure as follows: &quot;I got the impression that Che was saying goodbye to institutional medicine and becoming a doctor of the people&quot;. Granado later observed that by the end of their journey, &quot;We were just a pair of vagabonds with knapsacks on our backs, the dust of the road covering us, mere shadows of our old aristocratic egos.&quot;

According to his daughter Aleida Guevara in a 2004 article, throughout the book, we can see how Guevara became aware that what poor people needed was not his scientific knowledge as a doctor, but his strength and persistence to bring social change.

Guevara&#x27;s experience of the South American continent also helped to shape his revolutionary sensibilities. When discussing the plight of the downtrodden Indians of Peru, Granado discussed the formation of an Indian political party to begin a Túpac Amaru Indian Revolution. Guevara allegedly replied, &quot;Revolution without firing a shot? You&#x27;re crazy?&quot;. The journey was also formative in his political beliefs; for example, historian Paulo Drinot notes that the journey stimulated his sentiments of Pan-Americanism that would later shape his revolutionary behaviors.

Scholar Lucía Álvarez De Toledo argues that it was on these motorcycle travels that he &quot;disregarded his social class and his white European racial ancestry&quot; and retained the view of himself as an Argentine, as a member of the United America he had encountered during his travels. Having said this, with the exception of Guatemala, Toledo believed that Guevara showed little concern with the policies of the countries he encountered. In total however, Guevara&#x27;s travels in the 1950s played an important role in determining his view on the world &quot;and his later revolutionary trajectory.&quot;

==Editions==
The book was first published in 1993 as &quot;Notas de viaje&quot; by Casa Editora Abril in Havana, Cuba. The first English edition was brought out by Verso Books in 1995.

A 2003 edition published by Ocean Press and the Che Guevara Studies Center, Havana, included a preface by Guevara&#x27;s daughter Aleida Guevara March and an introduction by Cintio Vitier. There had been rumors of a conspiracy to prohibit its publication in Cuba, but the director of Ocean Press denied this, saying that the book had been legally published in Cuba and pointing out that the Union of Young Communists brought out an edition, with another to be published by the Che Guevara Studies Center. Furthermore, he has given an assurance that its publication has the support of many people, including Fidel Castro.

In 2004, Aleida Guevara explained that her father had not intended his diary to be published, and that it consisted of &quot;a sheaf of typewritten pages&quot;. But already in the 1980s, his family worked on his unpublished manuscripts.

<text>In numerical linear algebra, the Cuthill–McKee algorithm (CM), named after Elizabeth Cuthill and James McKee, is an algorithm to permute a sparse matrix that has a symmetric sparsity pattern into a band matrix form with a small bandwidth. The reverse Cuthill–McKee algorithm (RCM) due to Alan George and Joseph Liu is the same algorithm but with the resulting index numbers reversed. In practice this generally results in less fill-in than the CM ordering when Gaussian elimination is applied.

The Cuthill McKee algorithm is a variant of the standard breadth-first search
algorithm used in graph algorithms. It starts with a peripheral node and then
generates levels formula_1 for formula_2 until all nodes
are exhausted. The set formula_3 is created from set formula_4
by listing all vertices adjacent to all nodes in formula_5. These 
nodes are ordered according to predecessors and degree.

==Algorithm==

Given a symmetric formula_6 matrix we visualize the matrix as the adjacency matrix of a graph. The Cuthill–McKee algorithm is then a relabeling of the vertices of the graph to reduce the bandwidth of the adjacency matrix.

The algorithm produces an ordered &quot;n&quot;-tuple formula_7 of vertices which is the new order of the vertices.

First we choose a peripheral vertex (the vertex with the lowest degree) formula_8 and set formula_9.

Then for formula_10 we iterate the following steps while formula_11

*Construct the adjacency set formula_12 of formula_1 (with formula_1 the &quot;i&quot;-th component of formula_7) and exclude the vertices we already have in formula_7
:formula_17
*Sort formula_12 ascending by minimum predecessor (the already-visited neighbor with the earliest position in R), and as a tiebreak ascending by vertex degree.
*Append formula_12 to the Result set formula_7.

In other words, number the vertices according to a particular level structure (computed by breadth-first search) where the vertices in each level are visited in order of their predecessor&#x27;s numbering from lowest to highest. Where the predecessors are the same, vertices are distinguished by degree (again ordered from lowest to highest).

<doc id="1019407" wikidata="Q604094" url="?curid=1019407" title="Mike Bucci">
<text>Michael Bucci (born June 5, 1972) is an American retired professional wrestler. Bucci is best known for his appearances in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) as Nova, Super Nova, and &quot;Hollywood&quot; Nova and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) as Simon Dean.

==Professional wrestling career==
=== Early career (1992–1995) ===
Bucci was trained in professional wrestling by Mike Sharpe, and debuted in 1992, wrestling on the independent circuit. In late 1993, Bucci made several appearances in the World Wrestling Federation, wrestling in tag team matches against the Steiner Brothers and the Headshrinkers on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling===
====Blue World Order (1996–1998)====
In 1996, Bucci debuted in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) as Super Nova (later shortened to Nova), utilizing a superhero character. He made his ECW debut at Hostile City Showdown against El Puerto Riqueño, with the match ending in a no contest due to outside interference by The Eliminators. He was later paired with Raven, Stevie Richards, and The Blue Meanie as part of the Raven&#x27;s Nest faction. Nova would often pair with Richards and Meanie to imitate rock bands such as KISS and The Jackson 5.

Bucci, along with Richards, asked permission from both Raven and Paul Heyman to parody the New World Order (nWo); it was granted, and Bucci was given credit with the creation of The Blue World Order (bWo) logo. Bucci parodied Hollywood Hogan as Hollywood Nova, Richards became &quot;Big Stevie Cool&quot; (a takeoff on Kevin Nash&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Big Daddy Cool&quot;), and Meanie was &quot;Da Blue Guy&quot;, a takeoff on Scott Hall, &quot;The Bad Guy&quot;. bWo debuted at November to Remember where they helped Richards in defeating David Tyler Morton Jericho. Many other members were added and removed between 1996 and 1998 before the team split in the latter. bWo would become popular with the fans turning into fan favorites and leaving Raven&#x27;s Nest in the process.

Richards left the bWo to return to Raven&#x27;s Nest, and Nova and Meanie continued to team together as a tag team. On the July 17, 1997, episode of &quot;Hardcore TV&quot;, Nova unsuccessfully challenged Taz for the World Television Championship. bWo feuded with the much larger stable Full Blooded Italians throughout 1998, defeating them at Wrestlepalooza. In the fall of the year, bWo entered a rivalry with Danny Doring and Roadkill, defeating them at November to Remember.

====Teaming and feuding with Chris Chetti (1999–2001)====
After Meanie left the company, Bucci changed his gimmick, becoming Super Nova, and adopting a more serious personality. He would start wearing wrestling attires based in the suits of comic book characters like The Flash, Green Lantern and Venom. He formed a tag team with Chris Chetti as the two challenged Dudley Boyz for the World Tag Team Championship on numerous occasions but failed to win the titles. At Living Dangerously, Nova teamed with Spike Dudley to defeat the Dudley Boyz. Nova defeated Rod Price at Cyberslam. Chetti and Nova also simultaneously feuded with Danny Doring and Roadkill, trading wins at Hostile City Showdown and Heat Wave. At Anarchy Rulz, Nova and Chetti fought Simon Diamond and Tony DeVito to a no contest. At November to Remember, Nova lost to Little Guido.
u
The rivalry with Doring and Roadkill continued into 2000 as the team of Nova, Jazz and Kid Kash lost to Doring, Roadkill and Diamond in a six-person tag team match. At Living Dangerously, Chetti and Nova defeated Jado and Gedo in a tag team match. At Cyberslam, Nova and Jazz lost to Dawn Marie and Lance Storm at Cyberslam. At Hardcore Heaven, Chetti and Nova defeated Doring and Roadkill and Da Baldies (Angel and Tony DeVito) in a three-way dance. At Heat Wave, Chetti and Nova defeated Da Baldies. At the night one of Midtown Massacre, Chetti and Nova participated in a tournament for the vacant World Tag Team Championship, losing to Tap Out (Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger) in the opening round. At the night two of the event, Chetti and Nova competed against Danny Doring and Roadkill and Tap Out in a three-way dance, where Chetti turned on Nova by hitting him with a chair causing them to get eliminated and breaking up the team. It marked the beginning of a heated rivalry between the two men, with Nova beating his former partner in a match where the loser was fired at November to Remember.

After Chetti&#x27;s departure, Nova feuded with Hot Commodity (Julio Dinero, E. Z. Money and Chris Hamrick), wrestling Hot Commodity members Julio Dinero at Massacre on 34th Street, E. Z. Money at Holiday Hell and Chris Hamrick at ECW&#x27;s final pay-per-view event Guilty as Charged on January 7, 2001. At the second to last ECW event in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, he was named as Danny Doring&#x27;s substitute tag team partner (filling in for Amish Roadkill) to help defend the World Tag Team Championship against Hot Commodity; Doring and Nova successfully defended the titles. His final match for ECW took place on January 13 where he defeated Tom Marquez.

===Independent circuit and overseas (2001–2002)===
When ECW went out of business, Bucci, as Nova, became more active on the independent scene until 2003. Nova wrestled in various promotions such as California&#x27;s Ultimate Pro Wrestling, and New Jersey&#x27;s Phoenix Championship Wrestling, the latter of which was founded by his brother Don Bucci. During this time, he formed a successful tag team with Frankie Kazarian known as Evolution (not to be confused with the World Wrestling Entertainment stable of the same name). In most of the promotions they competed for, they were successful in becoming tag team champions. He also briefly wrestled in the short-lived Australia-based World Wrestling All-Stars, where he feuded with A.J. Styles amongst other cruiserweights for the promotion&#x27;s International Cruiserweight Championship, which he was unable to win before the company folded. In late 2001, he also worked a number of shows in England.

=== World Wrestling Entertainment (2002–2007)===
In April 2002, Bucci signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and was assigned to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). In his OVW debut, he defeated The Prototype for the OVW Heavyweight Championship. He held the title for several months, retaining it in matches against The Prototype, Christian, Lance Cade, and Chris Kanyon, before he lost it to The Damaja in October. The following year, he formed a tag team with Aaron Stevens, and the duo defeated Tank Toland and Chris Cage to win the OVW Tag Team Championship. In June 2004, Bucci was named the assistant booker of OVW. It was around this time that he was called up to start competing in SmackDown! dark matches and on &quot;Velocity&quot;.
He then began to try out a fitness-expert gimmick using the ring name Simon Dean. The name was inspired by Dean Malenko&#x27;s real name, &quot;Dean Simon&quot;. In August 2004, a series of introductory promos about the &quot;Simon System&quot; (a program of diet, exercise, and supplements) were aired on WWE television. The promos parodied fitness infomercials, with Dean routinely insulting his supposed customers. During this gimmick, he acted as the sponsor of &quot;Raw&quot;, occasionally wrestling after first insulting the fitness of the crowd and the area in which they were located. After making only a minor impact on the Raw brand, he formed a tag team with Maven who supposedly was a user of the &quot;Simon System&quot;. With still only a minor impact made, Bucci was traded to the SmackDown! brand on June 30, 2005.

During a WWE produced ECW pay-per-view, ECW One Night Stand, Bucci returned as Hollywood Nova with Da Blue Guy and Big Stevie Cool as the bWo. During the event, Joey Styles made a reference to his &quot;Simon Dean&quot; character. After Bucci was hit with two chairs, Styles said, &quot;That&#x27;s more painful than having to be Simon Dean on national TV&quot;.

When Bucci moved to SmackDown! as part of the draft lottery, he joined the other members of the bWo and appeared as &quot;Hollywood&quot; Nova for his first appearance on the show. His next appearance for the brand was wrestling on its sister show, &quot;Velocity&quot;, as Simon Dean. The general belief was that the bWo appearance was going to be a one off, meaning Bucci would keep to his &quot;health sponsor&quot; gimmick. It was announced, however, that the bWo would participate in a 6-man tag match at The Great American Bash against The Mexicools (Juventud, Psicosis, and Super Crazy). The announcement of this match occurred on the same edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; that Bucci&#x27;s Simon Dean character had a match with Booker T. At the Great American Bash, the bWo lost to the Mexicools in the six-man tag team match. The appearance of the bWo soon faded as The Blue Meanie wasn&#x27;t staying with the company and Richards began returning to his previous heel gimmick while Bucci continued with the Simon Dean persona.

In late August, Dean began coming to the ring on the Dean Machine (a Segway PT type machine). He would also force feed &quot;Simon System&quot; products to jobbers who wouldn&#x27;t accept his offer to try them after defeating them in squash matches. On the September 1 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he faced Batista whom he claimed to be a user of his products. Dean had his first major WWE pay-per-view appearance at No Mercy, in a loss against Bobby Lashley. After the match, Lashley forced Dean to eat 20 double cheeseburgers, causing him to vomit backstage. Dean had been noted on his later appearances as the &quot;Head of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;&#x27;s welcoming committee&quot;, a position in which he was used as a jobber to debuting wrestlers.

During the January 6, 2006, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Dean came to the ring and challenged any tag team. Paul London and Brian Kendrick answered the challenge, only to be brutally attacked by Gymini (Jake and Jesse), two alleged users of The Simon System. Dean was the third entrant in the 2006 Royal Rumble but was eliminated quickly by match-starters Triple H and Rey Mysterio. Dean began managing Gymini, but the team soon faded off television after Jesse suffered an injury in May 2006 and Dean went back to jobbing to other superstars.

In August 2006, Bucci took over from Tommy Dreamer as a talent development manager in OVW. On August 31, 2007, Bucci parted ways with WWE.

===Return to the independent circuit (2009–2022)===
On April 18, 2009, Bucci, as Hollywood Nova, along with many other ECW alumni appeared at One Pro Wrestling&#x27;s &quot;To The Extreme&quot; weekend event, where he teamed with the Blue Meanie for his first in-ring performances in nearly 3 years. They unsuccessfully challenged Project Ego (Kris Travis and Martin Kirby) for the 1PW Tag Team Championship. Bucci has since wrestled for both 1PW and International Wrestling Cartel.

On June 27, 2009, Bucci, again as Hollywood Nova appeared with many other former ECW talent at the Francine Fournier-run benefit show entitled &quot;Legends of The Arena&quot; at the original ECW Arena in South Philadelphia. He accompanied the Blue Meanie to the ring where they as the Blue World Order defeated the team of Little Guido and Big Sal the Full Blooded Italians. On August 8, 2010, Bucci took part in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling&#x27;s ECW reunion show, Hardcore Justice, where he, as Hollywood Nova, accompanied Stevie Richards to the ring and later attacked Tommy Dreamer during his match with Raven.

Bucci appeared in the &quot;On the Spot Title Shot&quot; Battle Royal for Pro Wrestling Syndicate in March 2015 where he reunited with BWO stablemates Stevie Richards and the Blue Meanie. The three also appeared at Pro Wrestling Syndicate&#x27;s Supercard show on June 6, 2015, as part of Mick Foley&#x27;s 50th Birthday Celebration. On September 4, 2015, Hollywood Nova, Big Stevie Cool, and Da Blue Guy reunited as the Blue World Order for Chikara&#x27;s 2015 King of Trios tournament. They were eliminated from the tournament in their first round match by the Devastation Corporation (Blaster McMassive, Flex Rumblecrunch and Max Smashmaster). During the third night of the tournament, Bucci worked a tag team match under his Simon Dean gimmick.

==Personal life==
He is the twin brother of Phoenix Championship Wrestling promoter and founder Don &quot;Donnie B.&quot; Bucci. After retiring in 2007, Bucci began working as a licensed Mortgage broker throughout the United States.

<text>Växjö () is a city and the seat of Växjö Municipality, Kronoberg County, Sweden. It had 71,282 inhabitants (2020) out of a municipal population of 97,349 (2024). It is the administrative, cultural, and industrial centre of Kronoberg County and the episcopal see of the Diocese of Växjö and the location of Växjö Cathedral. The town is home to Linnaeus University.

== Etymology ==
The city&#x27;s name is believed to be constructed from the words (&quot;road&quot;) and (&quot;lake&quot;), meaning the road over the frozen Växjö Lake that farmers used in the winter to get to the marketplace which later became the city.

== History ==
In contrast to what was believed a century ago, there is no evidence of a special pre-Christian significance of the site. The pagan cultic center of Värend may have been located at Hov, a nearby village.

An episcopal see since the 11thcentury, the city did not get its city charter until 1342, when it was issued by Magnus Eriksson. The cathedral of St Sigfrid dates from about 1300, and has been subsequently restored. Otherwise, during the Middle Ages, Växjö did not have many pious institutions. A Franciscan monastery was established in 1485. A hospital of the Holy Ghost was first mentioned in 1318. In the 14th century Växjö got its first school, Växjö katedralskola. In 1643 it received gymnasium status.

At the beginning of Gustav Eriksson&#x27;s war of liberation, the peasantry joined forces, under the guidance of the union-hostile bishop Ingemar Pedersson, with the mountain men and peasantry of Dalarna, Hälsingland, and Gästrikland, who urged fidelity to their leader Gustav Eriksson. During the Dacke War, a peasant uprising, the city was under the authority of Nils Dacke and his supporters from the summer of 1542 until after New Year 1543.
Several times during the Northern Wars and the Scanian Wars, and thereafter, the city was affected by fire (in 1277, 1516, 1570, 1612, 1658, 1690, 1749, 1753, 1799, 1838 and 1843). After the last fire in 1843, when 1,140 citizens were rendered homeless, Växjö received its current street plan.

===Modern times===
Växjö is the city in which the photograph &quot;A Woman Hitting a Neo-Nazi With Her Handbag&quot; was taken in 1985 by .

In its December 2015 report, Police in Sweden placed the Växjö district Araby in the most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates. 

== Historic buildings ==

Växjö Cathedral is located near the centre of the city.

Immediately north of Växjö is Kronoberg Castle, a ruined fortress constructed in the 15th century. This castle was used as a base by the rebel, Nils Dacke, during the Dacke War. The fortress has thick walls and artillery portals that face north towards lake Helgasjön.

Teleborg Castle is also located near the city. It was built near the Linnaeus University in 1900, it now functions as a hotel and conference facility.

==Amenities==

The Swedish Emigrant Institute was established in 1965, and is housed in the House of Emigrants near Växjö Lake in the heart of the city. It contains archives, a library, a museum, and a research center relating to the emigration period between 1846 and 1930, when 1.3million (or 20%) of the Swedish population emigrated, mainly to the United States. Archives dating to the 17thcentury contain birth and death records, as well as household records, that are available on microfiche.

==Industry==
Industries include GE Power and Aerotech Telub, as well as Volvo Articulated Haulers which is located in Braås , north of Växjö. One of the best-known service providers is Fortnox and Visma. 

Växjö houses Sweden&#x27;s National Glass Museum and claims to be the capital of the &quot;Kingdom of Crystal&quot; as well as of the &quot;Kingdom of Furniture&quot;. Växjö Linnaeus Science Park focuses on supporting entrepreneurs focusing on circular economy, smart city, forestry and digitalization.

==Education==
The city has three municipality-run secondary schools (&quot;gymnasiums&quot;): Teknikum, Katedralskolan, and Kungsmadskolan. Linnaeus University had a student body of 42,000 students (including its Kalmar campus) or 15,000 students (full-time equivalents) .

There are many public and private middle/high schools, such as Kronoberg Skola.

In air transport, the city is served by the nearby Växjö/Kronoberg Airport.

== Environmental policy ==
In 1996 the city adopted a policy for the elimination of the use of fossil fuels by 2030. This decision was taken in reaction to pollution and eutrophication in the lakes that surround the town. Greenhouse gas emissions were cut by 41% from 1993 to 2011, and were reduced by 55% by 2015. The city&#x27;s economy has grown during this time.

Växjö uses a variety of strategies to make progress towards being fossil fuel-free. Waste from the local forest industry is burned to generate power. Half of Växjö&#x27;s electricity and over 90% of the energy used for heating comes from trees. Biogas and renewable energy fuel the city&#x27;s public transportation, and cycling is promoted as an alternative mode of transport. New buildings are constructed using wood and are designed to be energy efficient.

By 2014, Växjö&#x27;s CO2 emissions had dropped to 2.4tonnes per capita, well below the EU average of 7.3tonnes.

=== The Greenest City in Europe ===
Växjö has called itself &quot;The Greenest City in Europe&quot; since 2007. It has its foundation in a long history of commitment to environmental issues, and ambitious goals for a green future. It is a vision shared with the citizens and the local companies.

In 2017 Växjö was awarded the European Green Leaf Award 2018 by the European Commission. The prize is awarded to cities with less than 100 000 inhabitants that show good results and ambitions in terms of environment and are committed to generate green growth.

== Climate ==
Växjö has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;), using temperature data from 1961 to 1990. Temperatures have risen in recent years, and using the -3 Celsius isotherm, it can also be classified as an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) with 2002-2015 temperature data. It is milder, wetter, and cloudier than the rest of the country, with the number of hours of sunshine being associated more with the British Isles than with areas further north in Sweden. Considering its relative distance to all three coasts surrounding South Sweden, the climate is markedly maritime, with winter temperatures being relatively mild for an inland location. When compared with sunnier inland areas further north, Växjö has relatively cool summers.

<text>Ballinhassig () is a village in County Cork, Ireland, situated south of Cork City just off the N71 Bandon road and near the source of the River Owenabue (&quot;Abhainn Bui&quot;, meaning &quot;Yellow River&quot;).

Traditionally an agricultural area, Ballinhassig has seen some growth as a commuter area, being close to Cork city. This growth saw the construction of new houses during the Irish construction boom of the early 21st century.

==History==
There are a number of prehistoric ringforts around Ballinhassig.

Mountjoy, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, camped locally with his army of 4,000 troops on the night before the Battle of Kinsale in 1601.

On 30 June 1845, 11 people (10 men and 1 woman) were reportedly killed by the Royal Irish Constabulary during a riot in the village.
During the War of Independence there were a number of actions in the area, including on 3 February 1921, when the 3rd Cork Brigade of the Irish Republican Army ambushed and killed three British Soldiers on the Tulligbeg side of the village in what was known as the Toureen ambush. Two soldiers of the Essex Regiment died there; Lt Dixon and Pte Charles Reid, Sergeant Thomas Bennet died of wounds the next day. That night, British soldiers retaliated by burning much of the village and homes in the Ballinaboy area, and arresting and imprisoning a number of local citizens.

==Amenities==
There are three primary schools in Ballinhassig (Ballyheada N.S and Goggins Hill N.S and Ballygarvan), several public houses, a number of shops, three churches, a Marian Hall, and a co-op.

A steam rally club is situated in Halfway, 2.5 km from Ballinhassig village, a village so named as it is halfway between Cork and Bandon.

Ballinhassig GAA has a Senior hurling team and was founded in 1886.

The Marian Hall in Ballinhassig is used as a training venue for a local taekwondo club. There is also a soccer club in Ballinhassig called Ballinhassig AFC.

==Transport==
The Gogginshill Tunnel at Ballinhassig, opened in 1851, is now the longest abandoned railway tunnel in the Republic of Ireland. It was a part of the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway. Ballinhassig railway station itself was opened on 1 August 1849, and closed on 1 April 1961.

<text>Cergy-Pontoise () is a new town and an agglomeration community in France, in the Val-d&#x27;Oise and Yvelines departments, northwest of Paris on the river Oise. It owes its name to two of the communes that it covers, Cergy and Pontoise. Its population is 206,654 (2017), in an area of 84.2 km2. Created in the 1970s, it became an agglomeration community in 2004.

==Composition==

, the &quot;communauté d&#x27;agglomération&quot; Cergy-Pontoise consists of thirteen communes:

*Boisemont
*Cergy
*Courdimanche
*Éragny
*Jouy-le-Moutier
*Maurecourt
*Menucourt
*Neuville-sur-Oise
*Osny
*Pontoise
*Puiseux-Pontoise
*Saint-Ouen-l&#x27;Aumône
*Vauréal
Except Maurecourt, which is in the Yvelines department, all communes are part of the Val-d&#x27;Oise department.

==Population==
Since the establishment of the new agglomeration, the population has quadrupled over forty years.

==History==

In the 1960s, faced by the fast development of Paris and its suburbs, it was decided to control and balance it by creating several new cities around Paris.

To the north, the choice was made on the surroundings of Pontoise. The old city was to be integrated in a much larger unit, whose center would be Cergy, at the time not more than a village. From 1965, the establishment of the new city was to be done in several stages:

*April 16, 1969: creation of the publicly owned &quot;Établissement public d&#x27;aménagement&quot; (EPA)
*1971: creation of the Syndicat communautaire d&#x27;aménagement (SCA).
*August 11, 1972: official creation of the new city of Cergy-Pontoise, gathering fifteen communes (the eleven current ones, and Boisemont, Boissy-l&#x27;Aillerie, Méry-sur-Oise and Pierrelaye).
*1983: the law Rocard amended the new cities.
*1984: Syndicat d&#x27;agglomération nouvelle (SAN) replaces the SCA, four communes left the structure (the four mentioned above)
*December 31, 2002: end of the mission and dissolution of the EPA, following the completion of the new city.
*January 1, 2004: transformation of the SAN into a communauté d&#x27;agglomération.
*2004: Boisemont becomes the 12th commune of Cergy-Pontoise.

==Public transport==
Bus services are provided by the Stivo (formerly StAN).

Rail services are provided by both the SNCF and the RATP. Two RER lines begin within the new town.

==Economy==
Subaru France and Bandai France have their head office in Cergy Pontoise.

==Media appearances==
*&quot;L&#x27;enfance d&#x27;une ville&quot;, a 1975 movie by Eric Rohmer
*&quot;I as in Icarus&quot;, a 1979 movie by Henri Verneuil
*&quot;Boyfriends and Girlfriends&quot;, a 1987 movie by Eric Rohmer
*&quot;Water Lilies&quot;, a 2007 movie by Céline Sciamma

==Twinnings==

Cergy-Pontoise is a sister city to the planned cities of
* Columbia, Maryland, United States
* Tres Cantos, Spain
* Erkrath, Germany
* West Lancashire, England (Which includes the planned town of Skelmersdale.)

<doc id="1019424" wikidata="Q2418569" url="?curid=1019424" title="Ballycotton">
<text>Ballycotton () is a coastal village in County Cork, Ireland, situated about east of Cork city. It is a fishing village that sits on a rocky ledge overlooking Ballycotton Bay and has a sandy beach that stretches for about east to Knockadoon Head. The current village is actually a re-settlement of an older village which is now entirely underwater. Ballycotton experiences severe coastal erosion with metres of land crumbling into the sea every few years. It is a site of international research interest on coastal erosion.

==Lifeboat==
The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat station was established in 1858, although medals had been awarded for rescues that took place in 1826 and 1829. The most famous rescue by the Ballycotton lifeboat took place in 1936. An RNLI gold medal was awarded to Coxswain Patrick Sliney, with silver medals to Second Coxswain John Lane Walsh and Motor Mechanic Thomas Sliney, and bronze medals to crew members Michael Coffey Walsh, John Shea Sliney, William Sliney and Thomas Walsh for the service on 11 February when the Daunt Rock lightship broke away from her moorings. The seas were so mountainous that spray was flying over the lantern of the lighthouse high. The lifeboat, was away from the station for 79 hours and at sea for 49 hours; the crew had no food for 25 hours and they only had three hours sleep. The eight crew were rescued after the lifeboat went alongside the vessel more than a dozen times. This was one of the most exhausting and gallant services in the history of the RNLI.

==Lighthouse==

Situated on the steep sloped Ballycotton Island approximately from the village, the Ballycotton lighthouse was commissioned in 1851 when the keeper and his family lived on the island and their children rowed to school, weather permitting. By 1899 the four keepers were housed in the town with keepers rotating duty at the lighthouse. In 1975 the light was converted to electricity and it was automated on 28 March 1992 when the lighthouse keepers were withdrawn.

==Amenities and tourism==
Ballycotton has a number of public houses. There is a pitch and putt course, tennis and squash courts, and beaches nearby. Ballycotton pier and breakwater are used for fishing, with common catches including mackerel, black sole and plaice.

Ballycotton was used as a location for a film called &quot;Divine Rapture&quot; during the summer of 1995. Although the film starred Marlon Brando, Johnny Depp and Debra Winger, the production company went bankrupt after just 2 weeks and the movie was never completed.

First run in 1977, the annual Ballycotton Road Race attracted runners from around Ireland and abroad to its 10-mile circuit of country backroads. After 40 years, in October 2017, it was announced that the 2017 event was to be the last.

The broad area around Ballycotton is home to a number of artists and craftspeople, including woodworkers, painters, photographers, potters, writers and musicians. Robert Ballagh bought a holiday home in one nearby townland, which later became the home and workplace of Rachel Ballagh. Some local artists exhibit at the Stephen Pearce Gallery in Shanagarry. Ballycotton has a 13 km cliff walk which leads westward to Ballytrasna.

Wildlife in the area includes seals and dolphins, and whales are sometimes visible from the cliffs in December and January. The nearby beach at Ballynamona is on a wildlife sanctuary and herons, oystercatchers and sandhoppers. It is also possible to spot peregrine falcons near the rocky inlets at dawn and dusk.

==Ballycotton cross==
In 1875 a local antiquarian, Philip T. Gardner, donated the Ballycotton cross (also known as the Ballycottin cross) to the British Museum. It is a 9th-century jewelled Celtic cross with a centre glass jewel with an inscription of the Bismillah in Kufic script which may be interpreted as &quot;As God wills&quot;, &quot;In the name of Allah&quot; or &quot;We have repented to God&quot;. It is held in the British Museum&#x27;s brooch collection, and the provenance is: &quot;said to have been found in or near Ballycottin Bog&quot;. As an early indicator of possible links between Ireland and early Islam, the cross has been cited in academic papers and histories of Islam&#x27;s presence in Northern Europe in the late Dark Ages, and on speculative history websites and forums.

<text>Borgholm () is a city and the seat of Borgholm Municipality, Kalmar County, Sweden with 4,401 inhabitants in 2020. It is located on the island of Öland in the Baltic Sea, at the Kalmar Strait-side of Öland, north of Färjestaden.

Borgholm is one of Sweden&#x27;s historical towns with a former city status (&quot;stad&quot;). The city is best known for its once-magnificent fortress – Borgholm Castle – which is now in ruins. Borgholm is, despite its small population, for historical reasons normally still referred to as a &quot;city&quot;. Statistics Sweden, however, only counts localities with more than 10,000 inhabitants as cities.

Borgholm is the main city of Öland, but remains one of the smallest cities in Sweden.

==Geography==
The city is situated some north of the Öland Bridge, which connects the island with the city of Kalmar on the mainland.

== Etymology ==
The name Borgholm is documented to be found from the 1280s. The foreland Borg- is considered to refer to the old ancient castle which is believed to have been located on the site of the castle ruins, but according to another interpretation refers to the eye-catching topography of the site. The significance would then be that berg- is the correct interpretation, and support for this can be found in Gotlandic, where borg can mean beach hill or high sand dune, and that berg-meaning has been well spread throughout the East Nordic area.

==History==

During the Viking Age, there was a marketplace in Köpingsvik dating from the 8th century. 

The oldest evidence refers to the medieval castle, which was on the site. The oldest evidence is a letter issued by King Magnus Birgersson at the castle. Borgholm&#x27;s castle was located in Borg parish, whose parish church was located next to the castle, and the oldest preserved parts date from the beginning of the 12th century. Borgholm&#x27;s then castle was destroyed in connection with Sören Norby&#x27;s siege of the castle in 1520 after which Borgholm was transformed into a royal court. 

The city received its charter in 1816 and emerged as a spa-town in the shadow of the ruins of the once mighty Borgholm Castle, which burned down in 1806. So important and magnificent was this castle, that it has become the city arms, and the ruins are the best known attraction in the municipality, perhaps on the entire island of Öland. Slightly further south is Halltorps Estate, a historic royal estate linked to Borgholm Castle. Borg parish was most recently dissolved at the beginning of Gustav Vasa&#x27;s government and merged with Räpplinge. The church was blown up in connection with the Kalmar War. Borgholm, however, continued to function as a fishing village and port for crossings between Öland and the mainland, the port has previously been called Borghamn. 

In 1620, Borgehamn gained rights as a Lidköping under the city of Kalmar. During the fortress construction period under Karl X Gustav&#x27;s government, Borgholm experienced a certain flourishing, but at the time of the issuance of the city privileges for Borgholm, Borgehamn&#x27;s köping had only about 30 inhabitants, within what became the city area there were then only three farms and four cottages. In 1816, the city of Borgholm was formed, the only city on Öland and a small town seen from a national perspective with only 109 inhabitants in 1821. A new port was built in 1855–1857, and in 1864 Borgholm became a health resort, which meant a certain boost for the city. The air on Öland and especially in Borgholm was considered beneficial, and well-to-do guests flocked in from the rest of Sweden, often by boat. There was a connection between Stockholm, via Borgholm to Hamburg. During this time many beautiful villas and even hotels were built. In 1851 there were 545 inhabitants and in 1901 926 inhabitants. 

In 1906 the Borgholm – Böda Railway was opened and in 1910 also the Södra Ölands Järnväg towards Mörbylånga and Ottenby. The railway was closed in 1961. At the turn of the century in 1900, tourism also began to gain momentum, especially after the royal family&#x27;s residence Solliden was completed. Since the Öland Bridge was inaugurated in 1972, the town has increasingly become a commuter town towards Kalmar. 

The city serves as the centre of northern Öland and is one of the most popular summer resorts in Sweden.

Borgholm Castle has its modern counterpart outside Borgholm. The Swedish Royal Family has its official summer residence at Solliden Palace a couple of kilometres outside the city centre. The Crown Princess Victoria&#x27;s birthday is annually celebrated on July 14 at the Borgholm Sports Field.

== Environs ==
There are small reaches of the Stora Alvaret geological formation in the environs of Borgholm, which level exposures of limestone host a variety of rare species of butterflies and wildflowers, some of which are endemic to Öland.

<text>Kalmar (, , ) is a city in the southeast of Sweden, situated by the Baltic Sea. It had 41,388 inhabitants in 2020 and is the seat of Kalmar Municipality. It is also the capital of Kalmar County, which comprises 12 municipalities with a total of 236,399 inhabitants (2015). Kalmar is the third largest urban area in the province and cultural region of Småland.

From the thirteenth to the seventeenth centuries, Kalmar was one of Sweden&#x27;s most important cities. Its name was until the second half of the nineteenth century spelled &quot; Calmar. &quot; Between 1602 and 1913 it was the episcopal see of Kalmar Diocese, with a bishop, and the Kalmar Cathedral from 1702 is an example of classicistic architecture. It became a fortified city, with the Kalmar Castle as the center. After the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, Kalmar&#x27;s importance diminished, until the industry sector was initiated in the 19th century. The city is home to parts of Linnaeus University.

The city plays host to the Live at Heart festival, one of Sweden&#x27;s largest musical showcase events.

Kalmar is adjacent to the main route to the island of Öland over the Öland Bridge.

==History==
The area around Kalmar has been inhabited since ancient times. Excavations have found traces of Stone Age gravefields. However, the oldest evidence for there being a town is from the 11th century. The oldest city seal of Kalmar is from somewhere between 1255 and 1267, making it the oldest known city seal in Scandinavia. 

In the 12th century the first foundations of a castle were established, with the construction of a round tower for guard and lookout. The tower was continuously expanded in the 13th century, and as such, Queen Margaret called an assembly there between the heads of state of Sweden and Norway, and on 13 July 1397, the Kalmar Union treaty was signed, creating a union which would last until 1523. Kalmar&#x27;s strategic location, near the Danish border (at the time the Scanian lands, i.e. the provinces of Blekinge, Halland and Scania, were part of Denmark), and its harbour and trade, also involved it in several feuds. There are two events independently labelled the Kalmar Bloodbath, 1505: the first in 1505, when King John of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden had the mayor and city council of Kalmar executed; the second in 1599 by command of Duke Charles, later to become King Charles IX of Sweden.
In the 1540s, first King Gustav Vasa, and later his sons Erik XIV of Sweden and John III of Sweden would organize a rebuilding of the castle into the magnificent Renaissance castle it is today.

Kalmar became a diocese of the Church of Sweden in 1603, a position it held until 1915. In 1634, Kalmar County was founded, with Kalmar as the natural capital. In 1660, the Kalmar Cathedral was begun by drawings of Nicodemus Tessin the Elder. It would be inaugurated in 1703.

In 1611–1613, it suffered in the Kalmar War, which began with a Danish siege of Kalmar Castle. 1611 is mentioned as the darkest year of Kalmar&#x27;s history, but by no means the only dark year; much blood has been shed in the vicinity of the castle. The last was during the Scanian War in the 1670s, so there have been 22 sieges altogether; however the castle was never taken.

After the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, the strategic importance of Kalmar gradually diminished as the borders of Sweden were redrawn further south. In 1689, the King established his main naval base further south in Karlskrona and Kalmar lost its status as one of Sweden&#x27;s main military outposts.

===Kalmar Cathedral===

The new city of Kalmar was built on Kvarnholmen around the mid-1600s. The transfer from the old town was largely completed by 1658. The new, fortified town was planned following current baroque patterns. Cathedral and town hall face each other across the new main square, Stortorget. 

The cathedral was designed by Nicodemus Tessin the Elder and is one of the foremost examples of baroque classicism in Sweden. Its design reflects the complex interaction between the new style, liturgical considerations, tradition and the fortress-city requirements. The work began in 1660, but it was interrupted on several occasions, including when the Scanian War (1675–1679) raged. Construction resumed, and Kalmar Cathedral stood finished in 1703.

===Today===
In more recent times, Kalmar has been an industrial city with Kalmar Verkstad making steam engines, trains and large machinery, later bought by Bombardier who closed the factory in 2005. A shipyard, , was founded in 1679 and closed 1981. Volvo opened their Kalmar factory for building cars i.e. 264, 740, 760, 960 in 1974, but closed it 1994 and due to further relocation of industry jobs in the 1990s and 2000s around 2000 industrial jobs were lost. Kalmar has a university with over 9,000 students and a research facility for Telia Sonera.

Kalmar has embarked on a comprehensive program to reduce fossil fuel use. A local trucking firm, which employs nearly 450 people, has installed computers that track fuel efficiency and have cut diesel use by 10 percent, paying off the cost of the devices in just a year. The company is now looking to fuel its future fleet with biodiesel.

A large wood pulp plant harnesses the steam and hot water it once released as waste to provide heating, through below-ground pipes, and generates enough electricity to power its own operations and 20,000 homes.

Bicycle lanes are common; for example, the Kalmarsundsleden, and cars line up at Kalmar city&#x27;s public biogas pump. Building codes now require thermal insulation and efficient windows for new construction or retrofits. Street lights use low-energy sodium bulbs, and car dealers promote fuel-efficient and hybrid vehicles.

In 2011 Guldfågeln Arena was initiated. It is the new stadium of the football team of the city, Kalmar FF. The capacity of the stadium is 12,000 people and it is currently one of the newest stadiums in Sweden. The stadium was also built to host concerts and did so in the summer of 2011 when Swedish artists Håkan Hellström and The Ark performed.

==Climate==
Kalmar has an oceanic climate using the -3°C isotherm or a warm-summer humid continental climate using the 0°C isotherm. Summers are warm and winters are fairly cold with temperatures normally hovering around zero. Kalmar is among the hottest Swedish cities, with an all-time record set at . The average summer temperatures however are typical for southern Sweden.

<text>Julia Clifford Lathrop (June 29, 1858 – April 15, 1932) was an American social reformer in the area of education, social policy, and children&#x27;s welfare. As director of the United States Children&#x27;s Bureau from 1912 to 1922, she was the first woman ever to head a United States federal bureau.

==Biography==

Julia Clifford Lathrop was born in Rockford, Illinois. Julia&#x27;s father William Lathrop, a lawyer and personal friend of Abraham Lincoln, helped establish the Republican Party and served in the state legislature (1856–57) and Congress (1877–79). Her mother was a suffragist active in women&#x27;s rights activities in Rockford and a graduate of the first class of Rockford Female Seminary.

Lathrop attended Rockford Female Seminary where she met Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr. After one year, she transferred to Vassar College, developing her own multidisciplinary studies in statistics, institutional history, sociology, and community organization and graduated in 1880. Afterwards, she worked in her father&#x27;s law office first as a secretary and then studying the law for herself.

===Work in Chicago===
In 1890, Lathrop moved to Chicago where she joined Jane Addams, Ellen Gates Starr, Alzina Stevens, Edith Abbott, Grace Abbott, Florence Kelley, Mary McDowell, Alice Hamilton, Sophonisba Breckinridge and other social reformers at Hull House. Lathrop ran a discussion group called the Plato Club in the early days of the House. The women at Hull House actively campaigned to persuade Congress to pass legislation to protect children. During the depression years of the early &#x27;90s Lathrop served as a volunteer investigator of relief applicants, visiting homes to document the needs of the families.

In 1893, Lathrop was appointed as the first ever woman member of the Illinois State Board of Charities, beginning her lifelong work in civil service reform: advocating for the training of professional social workers and standardizing employment procedures. This would lead to opening the labor market for educated women as well as improving social services in Progressive Era cities and towns. Over the next few years she helped introduce reforms such as the appointment of female doctors in state hospitals and the removal of the insane from the state workhouses.

===Director of United States Children&#x27;s Bureau===

Reacting to pressure from Progressive women reformers for the appointment of a woman for the newly created Children&#x27;s Bureau, in 1912, President William Taft appointed Lathrop as the first bureau chief. Over the next nine years Lathrop directed research into child labor, infant mortality, maternal mortality, juvenile delinquency, mothers&#x27; pensions and illegitimacy.

The Children&#x27;s Bureau under Lathrop (1912–21) (known as &quot;America&#x27;s First Official Mother&quot;) and her successors became an administrative unit that not only created child welfare policy but also led its implementation. For reform-minded women, the Bureau&#x27;s focus on maternal and child welfare gave them a role in politics for the first time—something that the suffrage or women&#x27;s rights movements had not offered them. The Bureau expanded its budget and personnel to focus on a scientific approach to motherhood in order to reduce infant and maternal mortality, improve child health and advocate for trained care for children with disabilities. Lathrop modeled the Children&#x27;s Bureau investigations from the work she did while at Hull-House. The Bureau also lobbied to abolish child labor. Scientific language became critical to the reform efforts such as the baby-saving campaigns in towns with large working class and immigrant populations where the middle class maternalists battled contemporary beliefs in the inevitability of high infant mortality rates. &quot;Mother-work in the community&quot; meant that women educated in the latest scientific theories about children&#x27;s health and safety would lead the movement for child welfare reform.

In her first annual report for the agency, Lathrop described the plans for expansion: promotion of birth registration, infant mortality field studies, production of instructional pamphlets and reports, expand the study of child labor laws, explore issues regarding mothers&#x27; pensions, and study the status of &quot;dependent, defective, and delinquent children.&quot; Lathrop wrote in 1914: &quot;Work for infant welfare is coming to be regarded as more than a philanthropy or an expression of good will. It is a profoundly important public concern which tests the public spirit and the democracy of a community.&quot;

Unlike the National Congress of Mothers, Lathrop&#x27;s leadership of the Children&#x27;s Bureau relied on her belief in the New Woman&#x27;s right to freedom for individual development and opportunities, including a college degree of equal merit to men&#x27;s and a decent job. However, Lathrop was careful to insist that motherhood was &quot;the most important calling in the world&quot; and to deny that women should have career ambitions. This way Lathrop could avoid controversy even while she built public support for the new agency.
In 1917, the American Association for Labor Legislation proposed a national health insurance act that included a provision for weekly cash allocations for pregnant women. Lathrop went against the private insurance industry and the American Medical Association to support this proposal, believing that the maternity benefit systems already in place in Germany, England and France left too many women and their babies uninsured. Lathrop argued in an address before the American Public Health Association&#x27;s 1918 meeting in Chicago that U.S. leaders needed to address the reasons for poverty in order to address children&#x27;s health needs—that high infant mortality among the poor and working class in American cities was not just due to ignorance or laziness. Lathrop asked: &quot;Which is the more safe and sane conclusion! That 88 per cent of all these fathers were incorrigibly indolent or below normal mentally, or that sound public economy demands an irreducible minimum living standard to be sustained by a minimum wage and other such expedients as may be developed in a determined effort to give every child a fair chance?&quot;

The attitude of most of the staff in the Children&#x27;s Bureau and other government agencies however, was that women—especially with children—should not work outside of the home even if impoverished. Any connections between children&#x27;s health and such issues as expansion of workers&#x27; insurance, minimum wage or sanitation systems lost credence. The popular strategy remained focused on &quot;Americanizing&quot; immigrant workers and teaching white mothers how to take care of babies. It is important to note that the Bureau chose not to address the horrifyingly high mortality rates among babies in families of color. In the South, much of the public health campaigns were undertaken by African-American, Hispanic or black clubwomen working in their own segregated communities.

In 1921 the Sheppard-Towner Maternity and Infancy Act became the first federally funded social welfare measure in the United States. The law provided federal matching grants to the states for prenatal and child health clinics, visiting nurses for expectant and new mothers, distribution of information on nutrition and hygiene as well as midwife training. Contrary to Lathrop&#x27;s original ideas, the final version of the law did not provide any financial aid or medical care.

The first 30 years of the twentieth century marked a transition between traditional social medicine that included the use of relatives or local midwives and the rise of a modern medical management of childbirth and childrearing by experts outside the family and home. However, as the federal bureaucracy blossomed in the years after World War II, the only agency focused solely on children lost its power and influence.

===Juvenile Justice===
As early as 1898, at the third Annual Illinois Conference on Charities, organized by the philanthropist Lucy Flower and Julia Lathrop, reformers called for a separate system of courts for children. Lathrop&#x27;s experience at the Hull House and as a Charities Board member had given her firsthand knowledge of the conditions for children in county poorhouses and jails. Prior to the reform era, children over the age of seven were imprisoned with adults. Lathrop helped found the country&#x27;s first juvenile court in 1899, and the Chicago Woman&#x27;s Club established the Juvenile Court Committee (electing Lathrop as its first president in 1903) to pay the salaries of fifteen probation officers and run a detention home located at 625 West Adams Street.

By 1904, Julia Lathrop helped organize and then became the president of the Juvenile Psychopathic Institute. The director was psychologist William A. Healy who led scientific studies of the physical and mental health of the children, shifting away from the belief that environment alone was responsible for a child&#x27;s delinquent behavior. Together with members of the National Congress of Mothers, Lathrop worked to organize a juvenile court movement nationally with justice law reformers such as Judge Ben Lindsey (who later chaired the National Conference of Charities and Correction&#x27;s juvenile court subcommittee).

===Later life===
In 1918, President Woodrow Wilson sent Lathrop and Grace Abbott to represent the U.S. at an international conference on child welfare. There Lathrop consulted on the formation of a childcare bureau in the newly formed country of Czechoslovakia. After her retirement from the Children&#x27;s Bureau in 1922, Lathrop became president of the Illinois League of Women Voters. She also helped form the National Committee of Mental Illness. In 1925 Lathrop represented the U.S. in Switzerland at the Child Welfare Committee established by the League of Nations.

==Honours==
===Academic===
There is a residence hall at Rockford University and an elementary school in Rockford named after Lathrop. An intermediate school in Santa Ana, California also bears her name. Although a residence hall at Vassar College is named for Dr. Edward Lathrop, a charter trustee, he was not Julia&#x27;s father. Julia&#x27;s father was William Lathrop, a lawyer and (briefly) a congressman, from Rockford, IL. In 1938, the Chicago Housing Authority opened the Julia C. Lathrop Homes, a public housing project in the North Center neighborhood on Chicago&#x27;s north side.

<text>Nybro (, ) is a city and the seat of Nybro Municipality, Kalmar County, Sweden with 13,583
inhabitants in 2020.

==Overview==

Nybro was founded as a rest area for travellers on the road between Växjö in the west and Kalmar in the east. In the 18th century a new bridge was built where the road crossed a stream and it was hence called &quot;Nybron&quot;, The New Bridge. A small tavern called &quot;Lortkrogen&quot; (literally the Filth Tavern) opened there. The market town was founded in the 19th century, but it rapidly transformed into an industrial town. In 1865 the town became a municipality separately from Madesjö. It was granted city rights in 1932.

Nybro is surrounded by forests and small agricultural enclaves. Kährs is a manufacturer of wooden floors and the largest employer in the city. But the two glassworks factories (Nybro and Pukeberg) are more known, because they also serve as tourist attraction. Nybro calls itself &quot;The city within the Kingdom of Crystal&quot;, the latter being a region with 15 active glassworks including Kosta Boda and Orrefors.

Nybro is also the home of Nybro Vikings IF, a professional ice hockey team currently in the second highest league of Sweden, Hockeyallsvenskan. The club went up from Hockeyettan to Hockeyallsvenskan season 22/23, and had two years in the highest league back in the 60&#x27;s. The ice hockey stadium in Nybro is the fourth oldest in the whole of Sweden.

The coat of arms was created when city rights were given to Nybro in 1932. The background is golden and the coat of arms depicts a red bridge in the lower part and a pair of black crossbows in the upper. The coat of arms of the neighbouring locality Emmaboda also depicts crossbows. The symbol can be traced back to coats of arms of the province of Småland and the hundred of Södra Möre but its origin is unknown. The local folk-hero and insurgent Nils Dacke is however sometimes depicted with the weapon.

<text>Oskarshamn is a coastal city and the seat of Oskarshamn Municipality, Kalmar County, Sweden with 17,258 inhabitants in 2010.

==History==

===Etymology===
Döderhultsvik was the original name before a town charter was granted in 1856. The name was then changed to Oscarshamn (meaning: Oscar&#x27;s port) after the king Oscar I of Sweden. The spelling has later changed to Oskarshamn.

===Struggle for town charter===
The location of Oskarshamn was known as Döderhultsvik since the Medieval age. In 1645, the city of Kalmar, to the south, made a request to the Royal Government on holding commerce in the bay there, which was granted, giving it merchancy rights as a &quot;köping&quot;. There followed 200 years of merchancies in the town, during which it was governed and dependent on Kalmar; while the surrounding towns and municipalities made frequent requests to grant it a charter, consequently turned down each of the attempts made in the years: 1786, 1798, 1800, 1815, 1818, 1823, 1825, 1830 and 1838. In 1843 it got some independence, with a local council, but the council itself was occupied by citizens of Kalmar. In 1854, King Oscar I of Sweden promised to grant it a charter as soon as it had fulfilled certain demands, including building a prison and a council hall, among other things. When they had accomplished the feats, the charter was granted, and the city became one of the Cities of Sweden starting 1856, on May 1. This status has today no legal significance, but Oskarshamn is now the seat of the much larger Oskarshamn Municipality, without being a political entity of its own.

===Recent history===
Industrialisation began with the inauguration of the railway line to Nässjö. From then on, industries as well as the harbour began to expand. The biggest private employer for a long time was the Oskarshamn Shipyard, which at its height had almost 1500 employees. But in the 1970s, the Swedish shipbuilding industry suffered a large financial crisis and many shipyards closed down. In Oskarshamn, the shipyard went through a large downsizing which left many people unemployed.

However, at around the same time, two major industries were established in Oskarshamn. In 1966, Scania AB bought the truck cab factory, which had been building truck cabs since 1948, and started expanding. The Scania factory is today one of the biggest employers in Kalmar county with almost 2000 employees. Liljeholmens Stearinfabriks AB, established in Oskarshamn in 1970, is the world’s largest candle manufacturer, specialized in stearin candles.

The oldest person in Sweden, Astrid Zachrison was born Åby in Fliseryd, just west of Oskarshamn. She died on her 113th birthday.

== Economy ==
The shipyard founded in 1863 is still active, as well as commercial and passenger shipping. Three different ferry lines transport passengers to Gotland, Öland and Blå Jungfrun.

Between 1965-1985, a nuclear power facility was constructed outside Oskarshamn. Three BWR units were built, that today delivers about 10% of Sweden&#x27;s electrical supply. There is also a laboratory for research concerning long-time storage of spent nuclear fuel. The Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory is open to the public to visit.

The two top employers in Oskarshamn are Scania truck manufacturer and the OKG nuclear power plant. Other companies include Liljeholmens candle factory, battery manufacturer SAFT, Elajo, and Bygg Hemma.

==Sights==
In the port of Oskarshamn there are tourist boats which take visitors to the island and national park Blå Jungfrun. There are also boats that cruise the coastal waters closer to Oskarshamn. Within the municipality there is the Oskarshamn archipelago which consists of over 5, 000 islands and small islets.

In the harbor area there are some restaurants, pubs and cafés. There are also viewpoints over the harbour. On the south side of the port there is a 72-metre (236 ft) wooden bench called &quot;Långa Soffan&quot;. It was built in 1867 and it is believed to be the longest of its kind in Europe. From the bench there is a panorama view over the harbor and the quite lively shipping activity going on there. There is a marina for private boats at the innermost of the harbor.

Another panorama-view of Oskarshamn and the sea outside is obtained from the top of the town’s northern water-tower which is open to the public.

The older part of Oskarshamn is preserved fairly well. In one particular part of town there are older wooden houses originating from the 19th century. The area is called Besväret and Fnyket.

Oskarshamns Stadspark is a public park located immediately south of the towns central parts.

Fredriksbergs Herrgård is a manor-house built in 1784 situated just outside the city center of Oskarshamn. It is open for the public to visit and houses a restaurant, café and a small museum.
==Climate==

Oskarshamn has an oceanic climate (Cfb), mild for its latitude, with winter means slightly below freezing and summer days among the warmest in Sweden and Scandinavia. Precipitation is light to moderate, typical of Southeastern Sweden.

==Culture==
Oskarshamn was the home of the famous woodcarver Axel Petersson Döderhultarn. His studio, as well as the Döderhultarn Museum, contains more than 200 of his carvings. There is also a maritime museum in Oskarshamn.

At the release of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; film, Swedish newspaper Sydsvenska Dagbladet concluded that Oskarshamn is the Swedish equivalent to Springfield, the Simpsons&#x27; hometown.

Each summer there is a music festival located to the harbor area. The festival, named &quot;Latitud 57&quot; and connected to the other international Latitude music festivals, is taking place simultaneously as the annual &quot;Oskarshamn Offshore Race&quot; which is a popular competition for powerboats. The world championship in Offshore was held here in 2011.

==Education==
There are four main elementary schools in Oskarshamn, &quot;Norra skolan&quot;, &quot;Vallhallaskolan&quot;, &quot;Rödsleskolan&quot; and &quot;Kristinebergskolan&quot;. There are also two high schools, &quot;Oscarsgymnasiet&quot; (the main high school) and &quot;Elajogymnsiet&quot; (specializing in electricity).

==Transport==
The rail traffic is today limited to a few passenger trains a day to and from Nässjö and freight trains to and from the harbour. There is also a ferry line between the town and Visby on the Swedish island of Gotland. Oskarshamn also has its own airport, situated some to the north of the city centre. The connection with Stockholm-Arlanda was closed down on 17 April 2014. In May 2014 there was a decision by the municipality to close down the airport totally. The nearest other airport is Kalmar Airport, from Oskarshamn. The airport is still used for some general aviation.

==Sports==

IK Oskarshamn is the name of the local ice hockey team. The team has played in the highest hockey-league in Sweden, the Swedish Hockey League, since 2019.

Craftstaden IBK is the name of the floorball team which is playing in the division 1-league. IFK Oskarshamn and Oskarshamns AIK are two of the towns&#x27; soccer teams. The latter plays in the division 1-league.

During 5th to 10 July 2011, Oskarshamn hosted the world championship in offshore powerboat racing.

<text>Västervik is a city and the seat of Västervik Municipality, Kalmar County, Sweden, with 36,747 inhabitants in 2021. Västervik is one of three coastal towns with a notable population size in the province of Småland.

== Climate ==

Västervik has a semi-continental type of the oceanic climate (Cfb) using the -3°C isotherm, and a true humid continental climate (Dfb) using the 0°C isotherm, with vast differences between seasons. The major weather station in the area is in Gladhammar west of Västervik. Differences are likely to be minor, with precipitation normals being available in greater detail for Västervik&#x27;s station. Overnight lows may be the biggest difference, due Västervik&#x27;s coastal position.

== Economy ==

The city still bases much of its industry on its harbour, and on the industries that were established as a result of it in the late 19th century. Västervik has suffered the closure of certain factories, notably Electrolux, with associated job losses. Just outside Västervik, there is the static inverter of HVDC Gotland and Fårhultsmasten, a 335 m tall guyed mast used for FM/TV-transmission, which shares with three other masts the title of Sweden&#x27;s tallest structure. 

==Culture==
Every year since 1966 there is a folk music festival in Västervik, at the ruins of the Stegeholm castle. The area has artistic talent by artists, potters, craft people and painters.

==Sport and recreation==
Being a summer town popular with yachtspeople, campers, daytrippers, and returning former residents, Västervik experiences an annual revival in July.

Västervik offers an outdoor life of climbing, canoeing and sailing or islands to visit and stay at. Björn Ulvaeus, a member of the internationally successful pop group ABBA who grew up in Västervik, is building a complex consisting of hotel, restaurant, and apartments in the bay near Stegeholm castle, which will be a tourist attraction for Västervik.

On the north western outskirts on the Stora Infartsvägen road, there is a speedway stadium known as the Ljungheden, where the Västervik Speedway team compete. 

== Other uses ==
Västervik is also the name of a small village 8 km north of Vaasa, Finland. The name just means &quot;western bay&quot;, so there could be more minor localities by that name.

<text>Värnamo (), historically known as Wernamo, is a town in Jönköping County in the south of Sweden. It is situated on the river Lagan just north of the lake Vidöstern. It is the seat of Värnamo Municipality and has 19,822 inhabitants as of 31 December 2020. The name comes from old Swedish &quot;värn&quot; (sconce) and &quot;mo&quot; (sandy flat land).

==History==

Värnamo traces its history back to a village in the medieval age; the first written mention of it stems from the 13th century. It came into existence as a village to the eastern side of a fordable place over the Lagan, a river that for large parts is difficult to travel by. As there are also smaller streams to the south and west of this location, it was considered something of a safeguard, leading to its name being amalgamated from the two Swedish words &quot;värn&quot;, which means safeguard, and &quot;mo&quot; which is a geographical location reference describing the kind of land on which the town is situated. The word &quot;mo&quot; actually means that the soil consists of fine sand, sometimes making the land surrounding the river bog or barren.

Värnamo came to be the centre of Östbo Härad, an archaic form of judicial district, and thus a seat of trade and commerce. When Värnamo became a &quot;köping&quot; in 1659 it was given formal rights to host markets, falling under the jurisdiction of the city of Jönköping.

The town of Värnamo was insignificant for a long time, but with the Swedish population growth and industrialization in the 19th century it expanded, becoming an independent &quot;köping&quot; in 1859. Dense forests and industrial water power spurned the furniture industry and forges run by water power. The Swedish railroad nets spurred to enhance its industrial life, leading to a population increasing from 1,141 people in 1910 to 3,664 in 1920, and making it significant enough to get the title of a city on November 1, 1920, whereby it became one of the now only historical Cities of Sweden. The chosen city arms depicts the traditional location by the Lagan.

==Geography==

Fourteen percent of the total area in Värnamo Municipality is made up of water. Seventy percent of the land area is covered by forests (of which 90 percent is productive), 7 percent is arable, 3 percent is suitable for grazing and 5 percent is built up. 
==Demographics==

Värnamo is the largest locality in Värnamo Municipality with 57 percent of the total population. It is situated in the Swedish Bible Belt and has a high concentration of free churches.

Värnamo has a significant Bosnian and Balkan population. There are six times more persons born in Bosnia and Herzegovina and three times more in Yugoslavia than the national average. Together they make up five percent of Värnamo Municipality&#x27;s total population and a quarter of the foreign-born population.

==Economy==

3M is the largest private employer with 225 employees and Värnamo Municipality is the largest public employer with 2,774 employees as of November 2020. The largest companies based in Värnamo by number of employees (including outside Värnamo) are Liljedahl Group AB, Bufab AB, Sandahlsbolagen Sweden AB and DS Smith Packaging Sweden AB.

When Finnvedens gymnasium opened in 1969 no students nor any teachers were allowed to participate in the opening ceremony which costed 25,000 SEK (equivalent to US$24,000 in 2020). This was seen as unfair by the student council, who also thought it was too expensive. The student council therefore organized their own, cheaper ceremony outside before the official ceremony. This attracted national news coverage and one of the invitees, Olof Palme, then Minister for Education, who became the Swedish prime minister a month later, spoke to the students.

There is Folk high school in Värnamo called Värnamo Folkhögskola, which has been active since 1876. It is governed by Jönköping County and offers primary, secondary and tertiary education. Among courses offered are youth worker, social educator and courses in textile. It offers boarding and has exchanges with a folk high school in Zambia and one in the UK.

Campus Värnamo offers tertiary level education and is governed by the municipal executive board of Värnamo. It offers technical and engineering courses in 3D computer graphics and printing, polymer engineering and web development as well as courses for paraprofessional educator and preschool teacher. It also runs Teknikcenter (&quot;Technical center&quot;), which organizes technical activities for children and teenagers and educates teachers in technology. Its purpose is to increase interest in technology in the region.

==Media==
There are three newspapers in Värnamo: &quot;Värnamo Nu&quot;, Finnveden nu and &quot;Värnamo nyheter&quot;.

&quot;Värnamo Nu&quot; is an online-only newspaper that was founded in 2010. It is owned by Birgitta and Per Bunnstad, the latter who is the legally responsible publisher.

&quot;Finnveden Nu&quot;, founded 2003, is a free newspaper that is distributed every Friday. An online version is also available.

&quot;Värnamo Nyheter&quot; is an online and print paid newspaper distributed every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. It was founded by Karl Witus Johansson in 1930.

&quot;Finnveden Nu&quot; and &quot;Värnamo Nyheter&quot; are owned by Hall Media which is in turn owned by Bonnier News Local and Amedia.

Sveriges Television broadcasts local TV news and publishes online news articles for Jönköping County, which includes Värnamo. Until 2014, local TV news for Jönköping County was also covered by TV4.

<text>Sävsjö is a locality and the seat of Sävsjö Municipality, Jönköping County, Sweden with 5,122 inhabitants in 2010.

==Geography==
Sävsjö is located on the main line railway between Stockholm and Malmö. The distance to Malmö is about 220 kilometers.

==History==
Sävsjö regards the date 1 October 1864, as the start of its current history, because it was then that the train station Sävsjö was inaugurated. At that time Sävsjö was nothing more than a few houses, but attracted by the railway it began expanding, attracting both industries and inhabitants. The settlement with its then 1.56 square kilometres had 1,481 people in 1917 at which time several small industries had established themselves there, most notably carpenters and other wood industries, and there was also a bank, a pharmacy and a post office.

In 1947 the rural municipalities &quot;Norra Ljunga&quot; and &quot;Vallsjö&quot; in which the settlement was situated were combined and formed the &quot;City of Sävsjö&quot;. Since the local government reform of 1971 Sävsjö is the seat of the much larger Sävsjö Municipality.

==Notable people==
*Eilert Ekwall (1877–1964), Swedish scholar of the English language, born in the hamlet of Vallsjö in present-day Sävsjö
*Jonas Bronck (1600–1643), namesake of the borough The Bronx, New York City, born in the hamlet of Komstad outside of present-day Sävsjö
*Sam Weihagen (born 1950), travel group executive

<text>Nässjö () is a locality and the seat of Nässjö Municipality, Jönköping County, Sweden with 31,782 inhabitants in 2024.

==History==
For many years, Nässjö was a rural village with agriculture as the dominant occupation. The turning point was the construction of the Swedish railway system. The southern main line railway, finished in 1864, passed through Nässjö. Later, other railways were inaugurated, whereby Nässjö, due to its geographical location in the country, became an important junction. A line to Katrineholm was opened in 1874, and that year also the opening of the Oskarshamn line; the one to Halmstad in 1882; to Kalmar in 1914. Today, Nässjö is the only Swedish junction where railways in six different directions meet.

As a result, industries moved to Nässjö, and the population increased. The most important industries were wood industries due to the forest covered Småland province area, at a time when it had become possible to factory manufacture the wooden chair (a.k.a. Windsor chair). Nässjö attempted to get a charter, which was granted in 1914, making it one of the now defunct Cities of Sweden. It is since 1971 instead the seat of the much larger Nässjö Municipality.

Its population continued to increase throughout the 20th century. In the 1940s production of electrical installation equipment began, and the industry Eldon AB was for a long time the largest industry of the town.

The rock band Backyard Babies and metal band Kongh hail from Nässjö. The head of the largest ponzi scheme in the Nordic countries, Winclub/Wincapita, Mr Hannu Kailajärvi was arrested in Nässjö on December 10, 2008, after reportedly having lived there for some time.

==Geography==

== Sport ==
Nässjö Motorstadion is a motorcycle speedway and flat track speedway venue located on the south west edge of the locality on Skogsvallen. The stadium hosts the NK Nässjö speedway team that has competed in the Swedish Speedway Team Championship and won the second division in 1997. The facility has hosted important events, including qualifying rounds of the Speedway World Championship in 1983, 1986 and 1991.

<text>Aneby is a locality and the seat of Aneby Municipality in Jönköping County, Sweden. While the municipality has about 6500 inhabitants, half live in the central town of Aneby. The municipality lies amidst the south Swedish highlands, 45 kilometers from Jönköping and can be found along highway route 34 that stretches from Tranås in the north to Eksjö in the south.

==History==
Though the 1900s brought the most dramatic changes to Aneby, there is evidence that supports there being humans around since the Stone Age. Though one event prior to the events of the early 20th century was also quite important to this once primarily rural society which is the construction of a rail line in (inaugurated 1874) that stretched from Aneby to Nässjö, which is still used to this day. This brought better communications to the city and conspired to its growth. A problem at the time was that most of the land in the area was owned by Johan Axel Schreiber who owned the farm Aneby gård. However, this all changed once Anders Petter Andersson came to town, bought the farm from Schreiber in 1906 and started selling parts of land to people who wanted to settle in the area, as well as creating roads. This caused the society to grow at a significant rate. A total of 120 apartments were constructed from 1906 - the year Andersson started selling land - to 1920. But the city&#x27;s growth did not stop there: every year up until the 1950s at least one new company started up in the area, among them a butcher, car repair shop and brewery 

1966 was the year when Aneby municipality was created due to Bredaryd&#x27;s and Hullaryd&#x27;s municipalities&#x27; fusing into one. A few years later, in 1978, a study concentrating on population growth concluded that the municipality of Aneby would reach 6975 inhabitants in 1990. This turned out to be an underestimate as the municipality grew to 7159 inhabitants that year. This was, however, the turning point for the growth of the municipality as it in 2015 has 6521 people living within its borders 

==Geography==
The landscape is characterized by Rut plateau terrain with intersecting valley routes and altitudes between, some in the form of long rock drumlins. The bottom of the valley is on 200 and the heights on 300 m about sea level or higher. The river of Svartån flows from south to north and forms between Aneby Lake and Lake Ralången the waterfall Stalpet. Moraine soils dominate, but the glacial lake sediments and glacier valleys occurs. Quaternary scientifically interesting formations are beach terraces, sandspit and a series of small transverse ridges, which runs perpendicular to the main esker in Bredestad Valley. Aneby is 70% covered by forests, mainly coniferous forest. Where deciduous forest and pastures occurs the landscape becomes brighter.

The agricultural landscape is characterized by the way of height buildings. The farms lie singly or in tandem on the crest or slope positions, with field closest to the farm and pasture and forest further down the slope. Higher up the frost risk is less and the soil finer than the boulder-strewn soil in the bottom of the valleys.

==Population==
The municipality has had a stable population growth since the mid-1980s. About 60% live in urban areas and 52% in the main town.

==Trade and industry==
Aneby can be counted as agriculture and forestry municipality (7% of the working population is employed in agriculture and forestry). The transport geographically favorable location and the availability raw wood material and labor have favored industrialization. About 33% of the workforce are linked to industrial activity, concentrated in the central town. The previously dominant timber industry in recent years has declined in importance, and the economy is now more diversified and dominated by small and medium enterprises. Among the larger companies include Attends Healthcare AB (dressings and medical supplies), Hags AB (park and play equipment for the outdoor environment), Anebyhus AB (house production) and Fläkt Woods AB (vents), all in the main town. Approximately 1/3 of the workforce is employed in the public sector.

<text>Eksjö is a locality and the seat of Eksjö Municipality in Jönköping County, Sweden, with 9,701 inhabitants in 2010.

==History==
The city of Eksjö most likely appeared sometime in the Middle Ages when it was the centre for the thing, a regional council. It is first mentioned on April 22, 1345, under the name &quot;Ekesiö&quot; in an estate sale court protocol. It was given its charter in 1403 by the King Erik av Pommern.

In the 16th century Eksjö was one of the six Swedish cities in the province of Småland. The others were Jönköping, Kalmar, Västervik, Växjö and Vimmerby.

After the crowning of King Gustav Vasa in 1524, the partisan leader Nils Dacke led a rebellion. Dacke took control of the area and was supported by the locals, also in Eksjö. After Dacke had been killed by the Royal army, his body parts were hung in public places, including in Eksjö, to quench any notions of new uprising.

This may also have contributed to the decision of Gustav Vasa to revoke the city charter of Eksjö in 1544. There are several monuments and folk museums honouring these times around the province and in Eksjö municipality, and in the dense Smålandian forests where Dacke lived.

In August 2015, a fire occurred in Old Eksjö.

===Relocation===
During the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War Rantzau&#x27;s army that had been pillaging Östergötland reached Eksjö after successfully avoiding Swedish enclosure attempts by crossing lake Sommen that had recently frozen. As Rantzau arrived Eksjö was burnt to the ground in 1568 and subsequently rebuilt at a somewhat different location. The construction was led by the Dutchman Arendt de Roy.

==Development==
The city emerged as a centre for the oxen trades but never really prospered and remained a small town until a heath outside the town became the point of assembly for the Småland Regiment. The city continued to be in the centre of military establishments, with the coming of the engineering battalion and the Husars of Småland, in southern Sweden, hence the lack of large industrial establishments.

==Notable People from Eksjö==
*Erik Brännström, ice hockey player for the Ottawa Senators
*Niklas Hjalmarsson, former professional ice hockey defenceman for the Chicago Blackhawks, Stanley Cup champion
*Richard Hansson, Fredrik Lennartsson, and Christopher Wallerstedt of the melodic death metal band Orbit Culture
* Reverend F. M. Johnson of the Swedish Mission Covenant Church in Chicago, Illinois 
* Gunnar Lindstrom, Javelin thrower &amp; agricultural consultant

==Sights==
Like many other Swedish cities, Eksjö was struck by fire in the 19th century, with half of the city burning down in 1856. But the northern part of the original wooden city remained intact, with some buildings dating back to the reconstruction of the city in 1568. 56 buildings are registered historic landmarks. A fire in August 2015 that killed one person destroyed some 17th-century buildings.

<text>Johan Helmich Roman (26 October 1694 – 20 November 1758) was a Swedish Baroque composer. He has been called &quot;the father of Swedish music&quot; or &quot;the Swedish Handel.&quot; He was the leader of the Swedish Royal Orchestra during the first decades of Sweden&#x27;s Age of Liberty.

==Life==
Roman was born in Stockholm into the family of Johan Roman, a member of the Swedish royal chapel. The family name &quot;Roman&quot; may be derived from the Finnish place name Rauma, since Johan&#x27;s ancestors lived in Finland. The composer himself described of being descended from the Finnish nation &quot;(&#x27;härstammar af then finska nationen&#x27;).&quot; The boy probably received his first music lessons from his father. He joined the royal chapel in 1711 as violinist and oboist. Around 1715 the King granted Roman permission to study abroad, and the young composer spent some six years in London. He almost certainly studied under Johann Christoph Pepusch, met Francesco Geminiani, Giovanni Bononcini, and, most importantly, George Frideric Handel, whose music made a lasting impression on Roman.

Roman returned to Sweden in 1721. He was soon appointed deputy master of the royal chapel, and six years later he became Chief Master of the Swedish Royal Orchestra. Roman&#x27;s life during the 1720s was full of organisational activity which led to much improved standards at the chapel, and, in 1731, the first public concerts in Sweden. Roman&#x27;s only work published during his lifetime, a collection of 12 sonatas for flute, violone and harpsichord, appeared in 1727. In 1730 Roman married, but his wife died just four years later. In 1734 the composer left Sweden to visit several European countries—Austria, England, France, Germany, and Italy. He returned to Stockholm in 1737, bringing back a wealth of music by various composers for the royal chapel to perform. In 1738 Roman married again. In 1740 he was elected a member of the newly established Royal Academy of Sciences.

Roman&#x27;s successful career took a turn for the worse in early 1740s. The composer&#x27;s greatest patron, Queen Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden, died in late 1741. In 1742 Roman&#x27;s activity was greatly hindered by health problems. In 1744 Roman composed one of his finest works, &quot;Drottningholmsmusique&quot;: a large orchestral suite for the wedding of the Crown Prince Adolf Frederick of Sweden and Louisa Ulrika of Prussia. Ironically, it was due to Adolf Frederick&#x27;s and Louisa Ulrika&#x27;s efforts that Roman&#x27;s career suffered. The new crown princess had different tastes in music, and her husband set up a very strong competing chapel. Finally, Roman&#x27;s second wife Maria Elisabeth Baumgardt died in 1744, leaving the composer with five children.

In 1745 Roman retired from his post as leader of the royal chapel due to deafness, which had progressed rapidly during the previous years. He settled in the parish of Ryssby, on the estate &quot;Lilla Haraldsmåla&quot;, near the city of Kalmar in south-east Sweden. Apart from a single visit to Stockholm in 1751–52 to direct the funeral and coronation music on the accession of Adolph Frederik, Roman&#x27;s last years were dedicated to translating European theoretical treatises into Swedish, and adaptation of sacred texts into Swedish language. He died at Haraldsmåla in 1758. His work has never been forgotten, for already nine years after his death the Royal Academy of Sciences held a commemorative ceremony, where Roman&#x27;s achievements were documented; copies of Roman&#x27;s works are found in manuscripts from as late as 1810.

==Music==
One of Roman&#x27;s best-known compositions is the &quot;Drottningholm Music&quot;, or &quot;Music for a Royal Wedding&quot;. It consists of a collection of 24 short pieces ranging in length from about one to six minutes. Roman wrote this music for the wedding in August 1744 of the Crown Prince Adolf Frederick of Sweden and his bride Louisa Ulrika of Prussia. Their wedding took place at the palace of Drottningholm (hence the modern title). The festivities lasted four days. The pieces of the &quot;Drottningholm Music&quot; were apparently selected and arranged as befitted the occasion. Roman also kept eight pieces in reserve. These pieces are known as the Suite in D major, sometimes referred to as the Little Drottningholm Music, or Shorter Drottningholm Music. Both are modern terms invented by Swedish conductor and musician .

Other pieces written by Roman include the suite of &quot;Sjukmans Musiquen&quot; and the Italian-inspired cantata &quot;Piante amiche&quot;. In manuscript there remains a Mass, motets, more than 80 psalms, 21 symphonies, 6 overtures, more than 20 violin sonatas, twelve harpsichord sonatas, and various other works.

<text>Pat Jabbar is a producer, musician and founder of the record label Barraka el Farnatshi.

Born in Hamburg, Germany, he grew up in Basel, Switzerland. In 1984 he discovered Arabic music in Israel. One year later, he went to Morocco, where he met many musicians. 

In 1988, the first CD &quot;El Buya&quot; by Aisha Kandisha&#x27;s Jarring Effects was released and published on Barraka El Farnatshi Prod. In 1992, he sent the CD to Bill Laswell, who wanted to work with Pat Jabbar and also helped him establish his record company. The name Jabbar derives from abdeljabbar which was the name given to Pat Jabbar by his Moroccan friends. Most of the CDs published on Barraka El Farnatshi Prod. are produced by Pat Jabbar himself and his collaborators; he also publishes CDs he licensed from other companies, among them works by Hamid Baroudi, Maniacs vs. Sharkiat and Hypnotix. Pat Jabbar also discovered Turkish rappers Makale from Basel and produced some of their music. He worked with French-Arabic chanteuse Sapho (singer), co-producing her album &quot;Digital Sheikha&quot;. Bill Laswell produced tracks for Aisha Kandisha&#x27;s Jarring Effects (the ur-posse from which most of Barraka&#x27;s projects and groups came), Ahlam and Azzddine. His newest group Maghrebika consists of himself and two Algerians now living in Switzerland, namely Abdelkader Belkacem and Abdelaziz Lamari.

The latest project Kasbah Rockers (referring to The Clash song &quot;Rock The Casbah&quot;) started in 2008 and is active until now. Sort of Moroccan artist collective, melting Algerian, Middle Eastern, Turkish and African (Somalia, Senegal, Cameroon) tribal roots with diverse styles of Electronica, as influences of Dub, Trip Hop, Psy Trance and Dance sounds. 

The placements reach from Netflix series such as &quot;The Recruit&quot;, over cult Indie flicks like Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Only Lovers Left Alive&quot;, to blockbusters as &quot;Inception&quot;, &quot;Taken 2&quot; or &quot;Sex &amp; The City 2&quot;.

&quot;Saharizona Ultraviolet&quot; from 2019, a homage to Ennio Morricone &amp; Tarantino, was the debut for a whole collection of singles, featuring diverse guests from the legendary Swiss/Moroccan Barraka label.

The collaborations with Somalian singer Sam J Samatar &amp; Bill Laswell, led to placements in Apple TV series &quot;Little America&quot; and hulu show &quot;The Looming Tower&quot;.
On their debut album from 2008, simply titled Kasbah Rockers with Bill Laswell, Bill Laswell played bass on 11 tracks, grooving along with eclectic artists such as Youssef El Mejjad from Amira Saqati, Maghrebika or Casus.

In 2023, a re-release of the Sheikha songs from Sapho album &quot;Digital Sheikha&quot;, is entitled &quot;The Sheikha Tracks Remastered&quot;.

<text>Buttevant (; ) is a medieval market town in County Cork, Ireland.

The town was incorporated by charter of Edward III in the 14th century. While there are reasons to suggest that the town may occupy the site of an earlier settlement of the Donegans, Carrig Donegan, the origins of the present town are distinctly Norman, and closely connected with the settlement of the Barrys from the 13th century onwards. Here they built their principal stronghold in north Cork.

Buttevant is located on the N20 road between Limerick and Cork and the R522 regional road. The Dublin–Cork railway line passes by the town, but there was a station (now closed) from which at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, newly raised battalions of the Royal Munster Fusiliers and the Royal Dublin Fusiliers who had completed their training at the local military barracks, set out for the Western Front. The town is in a townland and civil parish of the same name. Buttevant is part of the Cork East Dáil constituency.

==Etymology==
The Barry family motto is &quot;Boutez-en-Avant&quot;. &quot;Rotulus Pipae Cloynensis&quot; (1364) makes ten references to &quot;Bothon&quot; in its Latin text. The &quot;Lateran Registers&quot; record the name &quot;tempore&quot; Pope Innocent VIII as &quot;Bottoniam&quot; (7 March 1489) and &quot;Buttumam&quot; (3 June 1492); and &quot;tempore&quot; Pope Alexander VI in various forms: as &quot;Bothaniam&quot; (14 February 1499), &quot;Betomam&quot; (12 March 1499), and &quot;Buttomam&quot; (15 January 1500). Edmund Spenser, in &quot;Colin Clouts Come Home Againe&quot; (1595), gives an early example of the modern name and associates it with &quot;Mullagh&quot;, his name for the river Awbeg:

:&quot;Old father Mole, (Mole hight that mountain grey
:That walls the Northside of Armulla dale)
:He had a daughter fresh as floure of May,
:VVhich gaue that name vnto that pleasant vale;
:Mulla the daughter of oldMole, so hight
:The Nimph, which of that water course has charge,
:That springing out of Mole, doth run downe right
:to Butteuant where spreading forth at large,
:It giueth name vnto that auncient Cittie,
:VVhich Kilnemullah cleped is of old:
:VVhose ragged ruines breed great ruth and pittie,
:To travellers, which it from far behold&quot;

The &quot;Bibliothèque Royale&quot; in Brussels contains the manuscript of Father Donatus Mooney&#x27;s report on the Irish Province of the Franciscans compiled in 1617/1618 in which he notes that the place &quot;is called &#x27;Buttyfanie&#x27; and, in Irish, &#x27;Kilnamullagh&#x27; or &#x27;Killnamallagh&#x27;&quot;. Philip O&#x27;Sullivan Beare in his &quot;Historiae Catholicae Iberniae&quot;, published in Spain in 1620, gives the name &#x27;Killnamollacham&#x27; for the town and translates it into Latin as &#x27;Ecclesia Tumulorum&#x27;. James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde refers to &quot;Buttiphante&quot; in a letter of January 1684 (Carte Manuscripts, Bodleian, 161, f. 47v), while Sir John Percival, progenitor of the Earls of Egmont, recorded in his diary for 16 March 1686 that the troopers &quot;being att Buttevant Fair this day took Will Tirry and his wife and brought them hither and I examined them&quot;.

The Irish denomination for Buttevant has reached such a degree of confusion as to make it almost unidentifiable. The oral tradition of the area consistently gives &quot;Cill na Mullach&quot;, or &#x27;Church of the Hillocks&#x27;, for Buttevant. When the area was still largely Irish speaking, that tradition was recorded by O&#x27;Donovan in the field books of the General Survey of Valuation, Griffith&#x27;s valuation, which was taken in the Barony of Orrery and Kilmore &quot;ante&quot; 1850. Peadar Ua Laoghaire confirms the tradition in his &quot;Mo Scéal Féin&quot;. That notwithstanding, several other names have insistently been assigned to Buttevant by Irish Government officialdom: &quot;Cill na mBeallach&quot;, &quot;Cill na Mollach&quot;, and more recently &quot;Cill na Mallach&quot; by the Placenames Commission, explaining eruditely that it may signify &quot;The Church of the Curse&quot;, for which, the general public can be excused for thinking the commission were referring to nearby &quot;Killmallock&quot;. P.W. Joyce in his &quot;The Origin and History of Irish Names of Places&quot;, published in Dublin in 1871, dismisses as erroneous and an invention of later times, the theory that the Irish name for Buttevant meant the Church of the Curse, and cites the Four Masters noting that a Franciscan Friary was founded at &quot;Cill na Mullach&quot; in 1251.

The name Buttevant is reportedly a corruption of the motto of the de Barry family. On the Barry coat of arms the inscription is &quot;Butez en Avant&quot; - Strike/Kick/Push Forward—or, more colloquially, &quot;Bash your way forward.&quot;

==History==
Henry III of England, by grant of 26 September 1234, conceded a market at Buttevant to David Og de Barry to be held on Sundays, and a fair on the vigil and day of St. Luke the Evangelist (17 October and 18 October), and on six subsequent days. This was done to further the economic prosperity of the borough and connected with a widespread network of such markets and fairs which indicate &quot;an extensive network of commercial traffic and an important part of the infrastructure of the growing agrarian and mercantile economy&quot;. The most important markets and all fairs were associated with the major boroughs and can be used as a gauge of their economic and social significance as also the 1301 quo warranto proceedings in Cork at which John de Barry &quot;claimed the basic baronial jurisdiction of gallows, infangetheof, &quot;vetitia namia&quot; and fines for shedding blood (where &#x27;Englishmen&#x27; were involved) in his manors of Buttevant, Castlelyons, Rathbarry and Lislee&quot;.

The town of Buttevant accumulated a series of such grants over several centuries. Fairs and markets were held at Buttevant for cattle sheep and pigs on 23 January, 30 April, 27 May, 27 August and 21 November. Cattle and sheep fairs were held on 27 March, 14 October, 17 December. Pig markets were held on 11 July. Fairs falling on Saturdays were held on Mondays. Fridays were devoted to egg markets. Horse fairs were held on the Fourth Monday in October. Cahirmee Horse Fair, the only surviving fair, is held on 12 July.

The development of the settlement followed a pattern frequently repeated in the Norman colonies of North Cork and Limerick. The original nucleus of the town consisted of a keep situated on an elevation on the south side of the town. Opposite the keep, on a pre-Norman site, was built the parish church, dedicated to St. Brigit, sister of St. Colman of Cloyne. A mill, another characteristic element of Norman settlements, was located on the river, to the north of the keep. In addition, a hospice for lepers was established about a mile to the North East outside of the town wall. This basic structure was repeated in nearby Castletownroche, where it is still clearly to be seen, in Glanworth, Mallow, and in Kilmallock and Adare.

A further feature of Norman settlements in North Cork was their concomitant religious foundations. Early colonial sites, such as Buttevant and Castletownroche, saw the introduction of the more traditional monastic communities which were housed in foundations outside of the town walls. The Augustinian priories of Bridgetown (&quot;ante&quot; 1216) and Ballybeg (1229) being respectively founded by the Roches and the de Barry contiguous to the settlements of Castletownroche and Buttevant. With the rise of the new mendicant orders, essentially urban in character and mission, the Norman settlements saw the foundation of mendicant houses within the town walls as with the Franciscans in Buttevant (1251), and the Dominicans in Kilmallock (1291) and Glanworth (c. 1300).

The burgage of Buttevant developed to the north of the keep and eventually increased in size to about enclosed by walls for which Murage grants had been made by the crown in 1317. The native inhabitants were excluded from residence within the walled area and confined to a quarter of their own to the north west of the walled town.

A bridge, still extant, was built over the river Awbeg around 1250.

In 1317, the 11th. of Edward II of England, John fitz David de Barry requested and obtained from the exchequer a grant of £105 for the commonality and town of Buttevant for its walling. A further grant was made on 6 August 1375, the 49th. of Edward III, to the provost and commonality of the town together with the customs of its North Gate.

The steeplechase originated in 1752 as a result of a horse race from the steeple of Buttevant Protestant church to that of Doneraile, four miles (6 km) away.

==Ecclesiastical sites==

Ballybeg Priory is a 13th-century Augustinian priory which is located to the south of the town.

Buttevant Franciscan Friary is a Franciscan friary which is situated beside the church on Buttevant&#x27;s Main Street and is near the Awbeg river.

==Events==

The Cahirmee Horse Fair is an annual horse fair held in Buttevant. Originally held outside the town at Cahirmee, it has been held in the town itself since the 1921.

== Buttevant military barracks ==

Buttevant barracks was a 19th-century military barracks. The barracks is listed in the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage.

Buttevant military barracks was built in 1812, when the owner of Buttevant castle, John Anderson gifted 23 acres of land in Buttevant to the British Army for the purpose of the construction of a military barracks. Construction of the barracks took nearly three years to complete. The barracks was divided into three quadrangles and hosted an extensive range of buildings and facilities, including a gymnasium, training field, church, school, stables and a parade ground. At any one time the barracks was home to hundreds of soldiers and could accommodate up to 800 soldiers and staff. The main gateway to the barracks was made from limestone and was constructed in the Neo gothic style. A guardhouse which was placed inside this gateway controlled access into the barracks.

Michael Myers Shoemaker visited Buttevant barracks in 1908 and writes of his visit in his book, &quot;In Wondering in Ireland&quot; (1908). He wrote, &#x27;...these barracks at Buttevant are spacious and as barracks go, very comfortable... The campus or compound, a great green square surrounded by the quarters...often with lawn tennis and cricket going on in its centre and there are always the officers wives and children giving the scene a touch of charm&#x27;. He continues by writing, &#x27;on top of the entrance arch are the offices, on the right of the guardhouse and beyond it a large gymnasium. On either side of the green and running at right angles to the entrance are the officers&#x27; quarters. While a large barracks for the men forms the fourth side of the square. Back of this is another square, surrounded by a large barracks, while the married man have a separate building beyond these and the colonel lives in a retired pleasant house off in one corner&#x27;.

Support required for the everyday running barracks was immense. The barracks provided important commerce for the town and it is estimated that up to the 20th century it is estimated that up to 70% of the towns income came from the barracks. Throughout World War I thousands of men were processed through the barracks before being sent elsewhere. Later, during the Irish War of Independence the barracks was an important staging point for British forces. With the departure of British forces at the end of the Irish War of Independence, the barracks was abandoned. It was later temporarily occupied by both anti-treaty and pro-treaty parties and was eventually burned and destroyed during the Irish Civil War.

Today, evidence of the barracks is all but gone, with only an incomplete perimeter wall and the entrance to the barracks still remaining. The area where the barracks stood is now divided into three sections, one is occupied by Buttevant GAA and the two others are occupied by local businesses.

==Literary history==
Buttevant also has many literary associations: Edmund Spenser, from his manor at Kilcolman, referred to it and the gentle Mullagh (the Awbeg River) in &quot;The Faerie Queen &quot;; Anthony Trollope passed through in his novel &quot;Castle Richmond&quot;; James Joyce played a game of hurling there in his &quot;Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man&quot;; the revered Canon Sheehan of Doneraile mentions Buttevant in several of his novels, not least in &quot;Glenanaar&quot; in the setting of the fatal events of the Fair of Rathclare; and Elizabeth Bowen mentions it in her elegiacal family history &quot;Bowen&#x27;s Court&quot;.

Buttevant was the setting of the &quot;Bunworth Banshee&quot;, a supernatural occurrence documented in Thomas Crofton Croker&#x27;s &quot;Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland (1825–1828)&quot;.

Clotilde Augusta Inez Mary Graves, otherwise Clotilde Graves (1863–1932), the daughter of Major W.H. Graves and Antoinette Dean of Harwich, was born at Buttevant Castle on 3 June 1863. She was cousin of Alfred Perceval Graves, the father of the poet Robert Graves. Convent educated in Lourdes, she converted to Catholicism and had some success in London and New York as a playwright. In 1911, under the pseudonym of Richard Dehan, she published &quot;The Dop Doctor&quot;, which was made into a film in 1915 by Fred Paul.

In the Irish language, Peadar Ó Laoghaire makes unflattering mention of garrisoned Buttevant in &quot;Mo Scéal Féin.&quot; The 18th-century Irish antiquarian, Séamus Ó Conaire, one-time member of the Royal Society of Antiquaries, is buried westward facing outside of the friary portal.

==Transport==

Buttevant and Doneraile railway station opened on 17 March 1849, but finally closed on 7 March 1977.

The station was the site of the Buttevant Rail Disaster on 1 August 1980. At 12:45 a CIÉ express train from Dublin to Cork entered Buttevant station at carrying some 230 Bank Holiday passengers. It careered into a siding and smashed into a stationary ballast train. The carriages immediately behind the engine and goods wagon jack-knifed and were thrown across four sets of rail-line. Two coaches and the dining car were totally demolished by the impact. It resulted in the deaths of 18 people and over 70 people were injured. The scale and impact of the accident meant that CIÉ, and the government, came under pressure to improve safety and modernise the rail fleet. A subsequent review resulted in the elimination of the wooden-bodied coaches that had formed part of the train. On the 25th anniversary of this accident, a commemorative service was held and a plaque in memory of the dead erected at Buttevant station.

==Sport==
Buttevant GAA hosted Munster football championship games on and off until 1962.

<text>Brenda Bennett (born January 24, 1962) is a recording artist from Warwick, Rhode Island and is best known as a member of the American musical groups Vanity 6 and Apollonia 6. Bennett was married to Prince&#x27;s lighting and set-designer/director Roy Bennett, and she had worked as Prince&#x27;s &quot;wardrobe mistress.&quot; Bennett started off as a member of a Columbia Records band called Ken Lyon and Tombstone, which toured with Mott the Hoople and Queen.
==Career==
Vanity 6 was formed by recording artist Prince in 1982. Lead vocalist Vanity left Vanity 6 in 1983 after continuous disagreements with Prince. Group members Bennett and Susan Moonsie were joined by Vanity&#x27;s replacement, vocalist Apollonia, and Prince renamed the group Apollonia 6. In both groups, Prince wanted to give Bennett the image of a bad girl—she smoked and had an attitude. Bennett and group member Susan Moonsie had small parts in the 1984 film &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, which starred Prince. Apollonia co-starred in the film.

Bennett can be heard on lead vocals on the songs &quot;Bite the Beat&quot; on the Vanity 6 album, and on &quot;Some Kind of Lover&quot;, &quot;A Million Miles (I Love You),&quot; and &quot;Blue Limousine&quot; on the Apollonia 6 album. She can also be heard on the background vocals of the song &quot;17 Days&quot; that Prince withdrew from their album. The song became a B-side of his single &quot;When Doves Cry&quot;.

In April 2007, YouTube displayed the Apollonia film &quot;Happy B.Day Mr. Christian&quot;. In this film, Brenda features her solo song &quot;Blue Limousine&quot; from the Apollonia 6 LP. She runs through cars and sings outside a gas station about her missed lover who treats her unkindly, and features Susan and Apollonia in black leather working on cars. Brenda released several music videos on YouTube in 2011. It took her a long time to recover from the death of her brother and mother before she was able to make any music again. In 2013, Bennett released &quot;Guiltier&quot; (written by Charlie Mason, Rob Curti, and Måns Ek) and Jemmima, &quot;Guiltier&quot; is a song about how it feels like to know your loved one is doing the wrong things behind your back.

Bennett appeared on Ken Reid&#x27;s &quot;TV Guidance Counselor&quot; podcast on February 24, 2016.

Bennett lives in Jamestown, Rhode Island and is an inductee of the Rhode Island Music Hall of Fame.

<text>Castletownbere (), or Castletown Berehaven, is a port town in County Cork, Ireland. It is on the Beara Peninsula by Berehaven Harbour.

A regionally important fishing port, the town also serves as a commercial and retail hub for the local hinterland. Located on the Wild Atlantic Way, tourism is also important to the local economy.

The area is the setting for Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s 1943 novel &quot;Hungry Hill&quot; named after the nearby mountain of the same name.

==History and name==

The Irish name of the town () originally referred to a MacCarthy dynasty castle which once stood in the area. This should not be confused with Dunboy Castle – two miles west of the town – which was the seat of the O&#x27;Sullivan Beare family. Donal Cam O&#x27;Sullivan Beare, together with other Gaelic lords and with Spanish aid, rebelled against the English Crown. During the Siege of Dunboy the castle was reduced by the forces of Elizabeth I in 1602. He then retreated with his followers to Leitrim. O&#x27;Sullivan Beare&#x27;s stance was commemorated in 2002, and there is a plaque in Irish and English on the castle ruins commemorating those who died.

In 1796 Theobald Wolfe Tone and his confederates sailed into Berehaven Harbour in French men o&#x27; war. They anchored off Ahabeg – a townland five miles east of Castletownbere – but the gales were so violent that they could not land. Wolfe Tone fulminated that he was so close to Ireland that he could almost have spat onto the shore – he reflected, &quot;England has not had such an escape since the Armada&quot; – perhaps an allusion to the fact that adverse winds frustrated England&#x27;s enemies on both occasions. For his efforts in preparing the local defences against the French, Richard White, a local landlord, was created Earl of Bantry and Viscount Berehaven in 1816.

In the 19th and early 20th century, Castletownbere and the Berehaven Harbour was an important anchorage and naval port for the Royal Navy. In 1885, the harbour was a testing site for the development of the Torpedo ram when the warship HMS &quot;Polyphemus&quot; undertook a simulated attack on a fleet at anchor off the town.

The United States Navy established U.S. Naval Air Station Berehaven Ireland on 29 April 1918 to operate a Lighter-Than-Air (LTA) Kite balloon base during World War I. The base closed shortly after the First Armistice at Compiègne.

At Furious Pier, beside the golf course, on 14 May 1921 two soldiers were wounded and Privates Hunter, McCullen, Edwards and Chalmers – all of the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers – were shot dead by Irish Republican Army men led by Michael Og O&#x27;Sullivan. There was also an engagement between the IRA and Black and Tan members of the Royal Irish Constabulary just outside the town that day but no casualties were sustained.

Only one Castletownbere man was killed in the Irish Civil War; John O&#x27;Dwyer killed at Kealkill, County Cork in 1922 and commemorated on the plaque on Wolfe Tone Square in Bantry. The deep-water harbour was, up to the 19th century, much used by smugglers.

Castletownbere Lifeboat Station was opened by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1997. Poorly-located temporary crew facilities were in use for many years but a new building and moorings were brought into use on 19 May 2013 which significantly reduced the time taken for the lifeboat to put to sea.

==Treaty port==
On 6 December 1921, the Anglo Irish Treaty was concluded. It provided for the establishment of the Irish Free State, which came into existence on 6 December 1922. The Treaty included provisions by which the British would retain sovereignty over three strategically important ports known as the Treaty ports, one of which being described in the Treaty as the &quot;Dockyard Port at Berehaven&quot;.

Accordingly, even after the establishment of the Irish Free State, the Royal Navy continued to maintain its presence at the forts and batteries around Castletownbere and on Bere Island (together known as Berehaven). Berehaven remained under British sovereignty until 29 September 1938 when, pursuant to the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement of 25 April 1938, the territory was ceded to Ireland. &quot;The Times&quot; reported the handover of port as follows:

&quot;The Times&quot;&#x27; choice of headline was misleading, as the British troops at Berehaven were not the last troops to leave the Irish state. The evacuation of Lough Swilly was yet to take place.

The golf course near the town was part of the Royal Naval base until 1938. The tennis court there used to be where huge oil tanks stood. The sentry boxes still exist at the entrance to the golf course and at a jetty on the golf course. A golf course existed to provide diversion for the sailors of the Royal Navy.

Berehaven is the second safest natural harbour in the world.

==Demographics==
The town had a population of 860 in the 2016 census, with 1,483 in the surrounding electoral district, and approximately 4200 in the Beara Peninsula area as a whole.

Tourists add to this number during the summer season to a small degree. Since the 1960s a small number of immigrants to the area from the UK and continental Europe has increased the mix, and since the 2000s, some Poles and Lithuanians have lived in the area. As a fishing port, there is a mix of incoming and outgoing transients. A local Spanish influence is well established and a Spanish consulate building is situated in the town.

==Local economy==

Fishing is the chief economic activity in the town with, as of 2012, 80% of employment in the area associated with the industry. However, fishing only started up in a major way in the 1950s. Ships from the Soviet Union and the former Soviet Union came to Berehaven to purchase and process fish well into the 1990s. Castletownbere is currently one of the 5 main fishing ports on the island of Ireland. It is the largest fishing port in the country. It is also home to the Irish Fisheries training School, under the auspices of &quot;Bord Iascaigh Mhara&quot; (the Irish Fisheries Board).

==Places of interest==

Three miles east of the town lies Waterfall House. It was the official residence of the Royal Naval commodore of the Western Approaches squadron, anchored in Berehaven. Waterfall House was bought in the late 1960s by the Marshall family from England who built and ran the Waterfall Holiday village which included the Wheel Inn bar. Unfortunately the owner was killed in a plane crash in the Welsh mountains while returning to Ireland in the early 1970s and the holiday village was never fully completed. It was run by his wife Silvia until 1977 when Waterfall House and the holiday village were bought by the Van Etten family – supermarket owners from North Holland in the 1970s. The Van Etten family briefly ran the now defunct Wheel Inn whilst residing in Waterfall House. Another Dutch couple, former owner of the elevator company Mohringer Mr. Fonkert in Haarlem has lived there since 1982. It was then bought by the girlfriend of filmmaker Neil Jordan.

Beside Waterfall House lies the Hermitage, built just after the Second World War. It was built on the site of a farmstead – Curryglass House, dating back to about 1800. Erskine Hamilton Childers, President of Ireland and son of Erskine Childers, stayed in the house periodically with the owners his friends, the Bridges-Adams family in the 1970s.

The nearby Puxley Mansion was burnt by the IRA in 1920.

==People==
Notable people from the town include:
* Timothy Harrington (died 1910). Irish National League MP (Parnellite) and sometime Lord Mayor of Dublin. He is commemorated by a statue at the east end of the town.
* Standish James O&#x27;Grady (died 1928), the writer, was also born here where his father was the Church of Ireland clergyman. Castletownbere erected a shrine to O&#x27;Grady near his birthplace, the Glebe House.
* Dr Aidan MacCarthy (1914–1992) a prisoner of the Japanese during World War II and noted author of the book &quot;A Doctor&#x27;s War&quot;. Both his daughters live in the town, one who used to run a restaurant and another who runs MacCarthy&#x27;s Bar on the square (the latter featuring on the cover and in the title of the 1998 book by Pete McCarthy).

==Amenities==
Local religious congregations and buildings include the Church of the Sacred Heart (Catholic) and St Peter&#x27;s Church (Church of Ireland). The Church of the Sacred Heart was built in 1912 on the site of an earlier chapel. There was a full-time Anglican clergyman in the town until shortly after the Second World War. St Peter&#x27;s Church is now owned by the local community development association. The association also contributed to improvements in the community playground.

==Sport==
There is a nine-hole golf course two miles east of the town which was founded in 1989. A Gaelic Athletic Association pitch to the west of the town caters for traditional Gaelic Games and a rowing regatta is contested every August bank holiday weekend.

==In literature==
In &quot;The Commodore&quot; by Patrick O&#x27;Brian, Jack Aubrey&#x27;s squadron chases the French invading squadron to an unnamed place along the coast near here. The flagship is badly damaged in the fray, so Commodore Aubrey is pleased when two Royal Navy ships appear from Bere Haven, having heard the cannon fire. After tending all the wounded ashore, a local friend of Dr Maturin assumes he is there to see his wife, staying with a relative of her first husband, where the two have a joyous reunion, ending the novel on a high note. A local place name is given in the novel as Duniry, presumably a nod to Dunboy or Dursey.

The area is the setting for Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s 1943 novel &quot;Hungry Hill&quot; named after the mountain here, the highest peak in the Caha Mountains. The novel was subsequently made into a film.

<text>Matthew Duncan Ector (February 28, 1822 – October 29, 1879) was an American legislator, a Texas jurist, and a general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War.

==Early life==
Ector was born in Putnam County, Georgia, to Hugh and Dorothy Ector. The family moved to Greenville, Georgia, soon after. He was educated at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, before reading for law in the office of Hiram B. Warner. Ector served a single term in the Georgia state legislature in 1842 before moving to Texas in 1850.

Ector was admitted to the bar in 1851 in Henderson, Texas, and began the practice of law. That same year, he married Letitia Graham, who died in 1859. In 1856, he was elected to the Texas House of Representatives from Rusk County.

In Atlanta in 1864, he wed Sarah P. &quot;Sallie&quot; Chew. One daughter of this marriage, Anne Ector, became the wife of Louisiana Governor Ruffin Pleasant (1916–1920).

==Civil War==
When the Civil War broke out, Ector enlisted as a private in the 3rd Texas Cavalry Regiment of the Confederate army. He was soon elected lieutenant. He served as adjutant to Brigadier General Joseph L. Hogg and saw action in Texas and Arkansas. He was promoted to colonel and given command of the 14th Texas Cavalry Regiment. Then in August 1862, he was promoted again to brigadier general and assigned command of a brigade. He fought at the Battle of Murfreesboro in Tennessee and Chickamauga in Georgia. His men and he were then assigned duty in Mississippi, returning in time for the Atlanta Campaign in the summer of 1864.

At the Battle of Stones River on December 31, 1862, Ector commanded a brigade in John P. McCown&#x27;s division, William J. Hardee corps. The brigade included dismounted cavalry regiments fighting as infantry. These were the 10th Texas, 11th Texas, 14th Texas, and 32nd Texas Cavalry Regiments, and Douglas&#x27;s Texas Battery. Losses were 28 killed, 276 wounded, and 48 missing. At the Battle of Chickamauga on September 19–20, 1863, Ector&#x27;s brigade was part of States Rights Gist&#x27;s division, William H. T. Walker&#x27;s corps. The brigade consisted of Stone&#x27;s Alabama Battalion, Pound&#x27;s Mississippi Battalion, the 29th North Carolina Infantry, 9th Texas Infantry, and the dismounted 10th, 14th, and 32nd Texas Cavalry Regiments. It sustained losses of 59 killed, 239 wounded, and 138 missing.

During the Atlanta Campaign in the summer of 1864, Ector&#x27;s brigade was in Samuel G. French&#x27;s division, Leonidas Polk&#x27;s corps. The brigade comprised Jaques&#x27;s Battalion, the 29th and 39th North Carolina, and 9th Texas Infantry, and the dismounted 10th, 14th, and 32nd Texas Cavalry Regiments. Ector&#x27;s military career essentially ended on July 27, 1864, in fighting near Atlanta, Georgia. He was severely wounded and his left leg was amputated at the knee. The war ended before his recovery was complete, although he did travel to Mobile, Alabama, to assume command of the defenses there late in early 1865.

Three brigades under Randall L. Gibson, James T. Holtzclaw, and Ector fought in the Battle of Spanish Fort on 8 April 1865 near Mobile. The much larger Union army seized part of the defenses, forcing the Confederates to evacuate Spanish Fort with the loss of 93 killed, 395 wounded, 250 missing, and 50 cannons. On May 4, the Confederate army formally surrendered at Citronelle, Alabama.

==Postbellum==
Matthew returned to Texas and moved to Marshall in 1868. After serving in several local judicial roles, he was elected to the Texas Court of Appeals in 1875, serving until his death in Tyler, Texas, in 1879. His remains were returned to the Methodist church in Marshall, and he is buried in the Greenwood Cemetery there.

==Honors==
Ector County, Texas, is named for him.

<text>Castletownshend (, literally &quot;town of the castle&quot;) is a village about south-east of Skibbereen, in County Cork, Ireland. The village developed around a small 17th-century castle built by Richard Townsend, whose descendants still reside there.

==Architecture==
The main street of the town, lined with large homes from the 18th century, runs down a sharply sloped hill leading to Castlehaven Harbour and the castle. The Church of St Barrahane, built in 1826, overlooks the town.

==Demographics==
As of the 2022 census, Castletownshend had a population of 164. Of these, 73.2% were born in Ireland, 17.1% in the United Kingdom, 1.2% in Poland, 4.9% in other EU countries excluding Ireland and Poland, and 3.7% in the rest of the world.

==People==

Castletownsend was the home of Edith Anna Œnone Somerville, one half of the writing duo Somerville and Ross, who together authored the &quot;Irish RM&quot; series of humorous novels on Irish life in the early 1900s. The two met each other for the first time in Castle Townshend in 1886.

Sir Patrick Buckley (1841–1896) was born near the village in the townland of Gortbrack.

<text>Åmål () is a locality and the seat of Åmål Municipality in Västra Götaland County, Sweden with 9,065 inhabitants in 2010. It is situated on the western shore of Vänern.

In 2005 Åmål received second prize in the international competition The International Awards for Liveable Communities (also known as the LivCom Awards). A blues festival has been held annually in Åmål since 1992.

== History ==

Åmål was founded in the 17th century by Queen Christina, and became one of the now defunct Cities of Sweden on April 1, 1643, and the only city in the historical province of Dalsland. Its location close to the borders of the Denmark-Norway alliance made it vulnerable to attack and it accordingly suffered over the ensuing centuries: first in 1645, when it was almost completely demolished, again in 1676 and 1679; and the last time in 1788 when it was conquered by the Danes, who then held it for a short while.

The town suffered devastating fires in 1777, 1809, 1846 and 1901. After the last severe fire in 1901, whereby 1000 people became homeless, and one third of the city was burnt to the ground, it was rebuilt with wider streets and larger houses in a Jugend style of architecture. The area of wooden houses, the so-called Plantaget, south of the river, the Åmålsån, that runs through the town into the lake, was spared by the fire and today forms the &quot;old town&quot; area.

==&quot;Show Me Love&quot; (&quot;Fucking Åmål&quot;)==
The 1998 movie &quot;Fucking Åmål&quot; (known in the English-speaking world as &quot;Show Me Love&quot;), directed by Lukas Moodysson, is set in Åmål. The movie depicts the town as extremely boring and it was largely filmed in the nearby town of Trollhättan. The film created controversy in the town of Åmål. Local politicians campaigned to get the title of the film changed. The local complaints had no effect on the content or release of the film and since the release of the film the town of Åmål has even tried to embrace the publicity generated. In the early 2000s the town founded the pop music festival &quot;Fucking Åmål Festival&quot;.

==Sports==
The following sports clubs are located in Åmål:

* IF Viken 
* IFK Åmål

==Notable people==
* Rut Berglund, (1897 in Åmål – 1984) operatic mezzo-soprano and contralto

<doc id="1019472" wikidata="Q54759" url="?curid=1019472" title="Vänersborg">
<text>Vänersborg () is a locality and the seat of Vänersborg Municipality, Västra Götaland County, Sweden with 23,882 inhabitants (out of a municipal total of 39,904) Until 1997 it was the capital of Älvsborg County, which was dissolved in 1998. Since 1999 Vänersborg has been the seat of the regional parliament of Västra Götaland County. The city is located on the southern shores of lake Vänern, close to where the river Göta älv leaves the lake.

== History ==
A marketplace was established at Brätte at the southern end of Vassbotten (southernmost part of Vänern), south of modern Vänersborg, by the end of the medieval period. The settlement developed with paved streets lined with houses and farms and it was granted town privileges in 1580. The site, however, became unsuitable for trans-shipment of goods due to silting of its harbour and it was difficult to protect. Consequently, in 1644, the town was moved 3½ kilometres north to Huvudnäset, and the new town of Vänersborg was established, despite the reluctance of its inhabitants.

The name &quot;Vänersborg&quot; means &quot;fortress at Vänern&quot;. It comes from the fortlet which was built in 1644 for the new town&#x27;s protection. The coat of arms is also from 1644, depicting a golden ship (a &quot;bojort&quot;) with two Swedish flags.

Around 1800, Vänersborg had a population of 1,500 inhabitants. Vänersborg was the point at which freight was transshipped from lake ships to below the Trollhättan Falls (and vice versa) where ships could continue unhindered to Gothenburg and beyond. In 1778, the King Karl Canal was opened between Vänersborg and Trollhättan, shortening the overland portage and in 1800, the new Trollhätte Canal and its locks allowed shipping to move between Vänern and the sea. The waterway between Vänern and Gothenburg enabled the town&#x27;s importance to grow further.
In 1834, most of the town&#x27;s wooden houses burnt down. It was rebuilt in a grid pattern.

The Torpaskolan (secondary school) was opened in 1965 and replaced in 
2011 by the Nya Torpaskolan. The Arena Vänersborg was opened in 2009.

== Climate ==
Vänersborg has a cold oceanic climate. It also has a relatively wet climate for being in Sweden, having an average precipitation of between 1961 and 1990. In the early part of the 21st century, precipitation further increased. Differences between summers and winters are smaller than in many other inland areas of Sweden, being moderated by its proximity to Kattegat and the lake Vänern. In spite of this, the climate is quite continental considering its classification as marine. The location near the sea and at the shore of a lake influences the climate with frequent rain and wind from the sea, and some potential for lake-effect snow during winters.

== Economy ==
Handicraft, trade, shipping and its former status as the county seat of Älvsborgs County has benefited Vänersborg&#x27;s development. Ever since the 1600s, the city&#x27;s inhabitants consisted of a dynamic mix of administrators, businessmen, artisans and skilled craftsmen. Today the municipality is characterized by more high-tech engineering companies, IT and electronics, education and skilled service. Public administration still plays an important role.

== Education ==
Vänersborg has several schools, including Torpaskolan, Tärnanskolan, Vänerskolan, Birger Sjöberg High School, Frida High School, as well as the independent school Fridaskolan.

==Sports==

The bandy club IFK Vänersborg plays in the highest division Elitserien and Blåsuts BK is usually playing in the second-tier Allsvenskan. Arena Vänersborg is an indoor arenas for bandy. Arena Vänersborg caused a great commotion, due to it exceeding its budget, landing the final cost of the arena at 300 000 000 SEK and counting.

Vänersborg hosted the 2013 Bandy World Championship for men&#x27;s teams. For the second time Group A was a separate event. When the world championship will be held in town again, in 2019, it will be for both divisions.

== Districts ==
Vänersborg is made out of several small and large districts: Onsjö, Mariedal, Blåsut, Vargön, Lilleskog, Korseberg, Torpa, Nordstan, Restad and Öxnered.

== Politics ==
On 22 November 2010, Vänersborg&#x27;s Mayor, Lars-Göran Ljunggren (Social Democrat), resigned following two scandals of Arena Vänersborg, whose costs greatly exceeded the original budget, and the Toppfrys deal, which was investigated by the European Union Economic Commission. Ljunggren had spent 30 years on Vänersborg City Council, and three and a half years as mayor. He was succeeded in 2011 by the Conservative politician Gunnar Lidell. Mayor since the election 2014 is Marie Dahlin, Social Democrat.

<text>Ulricehamn is a locality and the seat of Ulricehamn Municipality, Västra Götaland County, Sweden, with 9,787 inhabitants in 2010.

==History==
Ulricehamn, originally known as &quot;Bogesund&quot;, has been populated at least since the Middle Ages. The town has had city privileges since at least the 15th century. There are still several old buildings from the 17th and 18th century and the picturesque main street &quot;Storgatan&quot; has existed in its present form for centuries. Among other historical structures, there is the city hall, located at the market square, a yellowish rococo building from 1789.

The town is situated on &quot;Ätranstigen&quot; (&quot;The Ätran path&quot;), a trail following the river Ätran, stretching from the Kattegat strait in the west an inwards the country, connecting with other roads leading eventually to the eastern cities Sigtuna and Uppsala. In 1520, the Battle of Bogesund took place on the ice of the lake Åsunden.

In 1741, it was renamed Ulricehamn in honour of Queen Ulrica Eleonora. Following a fire in 1788 it encountered a recession, but several textile industries were established in the 19th century. Together with its first railroad in 1874 the town&#x27;s importance as a center of trade increased.

==Geography==
The town is located on the slopes of a lakeside, where the river Ätran flows into lake Åsunden. The geography is signified by the scenic nature of trees and water, which offers popular activities such as bicycling, inlining and boat trips.

==Climate==
Ulricehamn has a transitional climate between maritime (&quot;Cfb&quot;) and humid continental (&quot;Dfb&quot;) on the Köppen climate classification. The climate in Ulricehamn differs slightly from surrounding areas. Situated on the slopes on the south side of Lake Åsunden it reaches up to 350 m.a.s.l. making the climate considerably colder than low-lying cities on the plains somewhat further north. Annual temperature in altitudes over 300m is further cooler in winter compared to data, since the weather station is located 180 m.a.s.l. During wintertime, Ulricehamn has become something of a skiing centre for the southwestern parts of Sweden. For alpine skiing, there are 7 lifts and 6 slopes; while for cross-country skiing there are some 25 kilometers of prepared courses. The town centre on the lake is less likely to build up a snow cover due to the milder weather.

Being in the interior but also influenced by maritime westerlies, the summers closely resemble coastal locations to its west due to its elevation and more frequent cloud cover. Similar to other parts of southwestern Sweden, a lot of winter precipitation falls as rain due to the low-pressure systems originating over the warm waters of the North Atlantic. The weather station was set up in the 19th century, but closed after 2021.

<text>Uddevalla is a town and the seat of Uddevalla Municipality in Västra Götaland County, Sweden. In 2015, it had a population of 34,781.

It is located at a bay of the south-eastern part of Skagerrak. The beaches of Uddevalla are filled with seashells and Uddevalla has one of the largest shell-banks in the world.

Uddevalla has a port and it once had a large shipyard, the &quot;Uddevallavarvet&quot; (&quot;Uddevalla wharf&quot;), which was the largest employer in Bohuslän during the 1960s. The 1970s recession, that affected the Swedish shipyard industry severely, led to the closing of the wharf in 1985.

== History ==

Uddevalla received its town privileges in 1498, but thought to have been a place of trade long before that. Formerly, Uddevalla belonged to Norway, and its name today comes from the original Norwegian &quot;Oddevald&quot;, which later turned into &quot;Oddevold&quot;. Due to its close location to Sweden and Denmark, it was often besieged. In 1612, it was burnt down by Swedish troops led by Jesper Mattson Krus and in 1644, it was once again burnt down, this time by Swedish commander Harald Stake. In 1658, it was ceded to Sweden at the treaty of Roskilde. The Norwegians recaptured the town a year later, and in 1660, it was once again ceded to Sweden at the peace treaty of Copenhagen. Later, Norway annexed Uddevalla and the nearby fortress on the &quot;Galleberg&quot; repeatedly, the last time in 1788.

In the 18th and 19th century, Uddevalla&#x27;s main source of income was herring fishing. The town was also noted for the great fires that damaged the city on several occasions. The most devastating fire was in 1806, when the whole town burned to the ground. Only four houses were left untouched and 4,000 people became homeless.

During the 19th century, Uddevalla had trouble getting out of its own recession; poverty and alcoholism were widespread among the population. The reasons were mainly the aftermath of the fire in 1806, the decrease in herring fishing and the opening of the Trollhätte Canal.

In 1870–80, Uddevalla began to attract new industries. Much of that development can be attributed to the Scottish businessman William Thorburn, who is said to have been amazed by the town&#x27;s beauty and therefore settled down in Uddevalla with his wife Jessy Macfie in 1822. He founded a number of industries, starting mostly with textile companies. The building of a new railroad, the Bohus Line, also contributed to the town&#x27;s recovering economy. A prominent person in Uddevalla&#x27;s history was Ture Malmgren, newspaper publisher and progressive liberal politician.

During the 1958 FIFA World Cup, Uddevalla was one of twelve Swedish towns to host matches, which were played at the Rimnersvallen stadium.

=== 21st century ===
After the Swedish shipyard crisis during the 1980s, resulting in the closing of the &quot;Uddevallavarvet&quot;, Uddevalla suffered an economic setback. Over the thirty years following that, the town has recovered and the population is once again increasing, slowly but steadily.

== Education ==
All the high schools in Uddevalla are administered as one school, the &quot;Uddevalla Gymnasieskola&quot; (&quot;Uddevalla High School&quot;), which is now the largest high school in Sweden. The school has 4,000 students attending the following branches of the high school:

<text>Susan Moonsie-Mohan (born January 21, 1964) is a Trinidadian-born American singer. She is best known as a member of the 1980s musical groups Vanity 6 and Apollonia 6 that were associated with recording artist Prince.

== Life and career ==
Susan Vashtie Moonsie was born in Trinidad and Tobago on January 21, 1964, the daughter of a conservative school teacher. She grew up in Minneapolis, where she met Prince at a local discotheque when she was sixteen in 1980. In 1981, he formed a girl group that would be called &quot;The Hookers&quot; with Moonsie and her sister Loreen along with Cavallo, Ruffalo &amp; Fargnoli employee Jamie Shoop.

Then in 1982, Moonsie became a member of Vanity 6 along with set designer Roy Bennett&#x27;s wife Brenda Bennett and lead singer Vanity. Moonsie was given a &quot;teenage Lolita&quot; image by Prince for shock value—Susan claimed she was only 16 years old at the time, although she was 18 years old when the group was formed. The group had a hit on the US R&amp;B Chart with their single &quot;Nasty Girl.&quot;

After lead singer Vanity&#x27;s departure in 1983, Moonsie and Bennett were joined by Patricia &quot;Apollonia&quot; Kotero, who replaced Vanity in the group. Prince changed the group&#x27;s name to Apollonia 6 and they appeared in the 1984 film &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, which co-starred Apollonia, and had a minor hit with the song &quot;Sex Shooter&quot; that same year. In the 1980s, Moonsie provided vocals on some of Prince&#x27;s tracks.

Moonsie has lived between the United States (in Florida) and Trinidad and Tobago since 2000. Married with two children, Moonsie purchased Hardy Park Bistro in Fort Lauderdale, Florida with her son, Aaron Mohan, in 2020. She has also worked as a real estate broker.

== Relationship with Prince ==
Moonsie had an on-and-off romantic relationship with Prince from about 1980 to 1985. They became very close during his 1980–81 Dirty Mind Tour and she was his main girlfriend until he met Denise &quot;Vanity&quot; Matthews in 1982. Some have stated that Moonsie chose to end her relationship with him around 1983 after he became infatuated with Vanity, and she became good friends with Vanity. Another story suggests that their relationship continued until 1984 when Prince began a close relationship with Susannah Melvoin (the twin sister of Revolution guitarist Wendy Melvoin).

Prince is believed to have written the song &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; about his relationship with Moonsie. His song &quot;Private Joy&quot; was also reportedly written about her.

Moonsie kept in touch with Prince through the years, up until his death in 2016.

== In pop culture ==
Moonsie is mentioned in the lyrics of the Timex Social Club hit song &quot;Rumors&quot;. &quot;Did you hear that one about Susan, some say she&#x27;s just a tease. In a camisole, she&#x27;s six feet tall. She&#x27;ll knock you to your knees&quot;. This fact was confirmed by Timex Social Club founding member and lyricist Marcus A. Thompson.

<text>Trollhättan () is the 23rd-largest city in Sweden, the seat of Trollhättan Municipality, Västra Götaland County. It is situated by Göta älv, near the lake Vänern, and has a population of approximately 50,000 in the city proper. It is located 75 km (46 mi) north of Sweden&#x27;s second-largest city, Gothenburg.

==History==
Trollhättan was granted city rights (which today have no legal effect) in 1916 at 
which time it had about 15,000 inhabitants, now grown to 59,058.
Trollhättan was founded on the river Göta älv, at the Trollhättan Falls. The site was first mentioned in literature from 1413. Trollhättan had a strategic significance on the road between Västergötland and Norway. It was also of a commercial and political significance for shipping to and from Vänern.

Utilization of the river falls was the first important business activity in the area. From the Middle Ages milling and sawing operations have been conducted where the city center is now located. For centuries, Trollhättan Falls was an obstacle for boats travelling the river, until a lock system was completed in the 19th century. In 1795 the English writer Mary Wollstonecraft visited Trollhattan on her trip through Sweden, Norway and Denmark. She described in one of her letters her observations of the canal under construction, and the falls. It has since been updated several times, and the present locks were finished in 1916. In the late 19th century, hydropower was developed in Trollhättan. The Swedish energy corporation Vattenfall took its name from the falls in Trollhättan. Today the city has two operational hydropower stations, Olidan and Hojum. 
 Trollhättan is also home of King Oscars Bridge, for a long time one of Sweden&#x27;s biggest tourist attractions, owing to its impressive views of the Trollhättan Falls.
On 22 October 2015, a mass stabbing occurred at Kronan School, a high school.

==Name==

The name &quot;Trollhättan&quot; itself was originally used only for the falls area. The name &quot;Trollhättan&quot; is translated as &quot;troll&#x27;s bonnet&quot;. The latter part &quot;hätta&quot; could also mean mountain top. The water that splashed from a large rock at the bottom of the waterfall (before the hydro dam was built) was imagined to look like a troll&#x27;s hat.
Other former names of the site are &quot;Eiðar&quot; and &quot;Stora Edet&quot;; the latter lives on in the name of the south-bordering municipality of Lilla Edet.

==Industry==
The manufacturing company Nydqvist &amp; Holm AB (now NOHAB) was based in the city of Trollhättan dating from 1847. Further industries quickly followed. Dating from the 19th century, Trollhättan formerly housed the headquarters and main production plant of Saab Automobile and subsequently the headquarters and a production plant of National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS). It also has a number of industrial facilities, headed by GKN Aerospace (previously known as Volvo Aero) and its contractual suppliers. As with parallel locations elsewhere in Europe, much of its production has moved from heavy industry to professional services and the creation of intellectual property.

As of 2011, Trollhättan hosts a film production complex known as Trollywood; movies shot there include &quot;Show Me Love&quot; (&quot;Fucking Åmål&quot;), &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;, &quot;Melancholia&quot;, &quot;Dogville&quot; and studio scenes for &quot;Lilya 4-ever&quot;. The movie studio Film i Väst centered here produces about half of the Swedish feature-length films.

==Trollhätte Canal==
During the 17th century, work on a system of locks began and the first lock was completed around 1607 at Lilla Edet. During the 18th century several unsuccessful attempts were made to complete the locks. In 1718 a contract was signed by the government and Christopher Polhem (1661–1751) for construction of a canal between Kattegatt and Lake Vänern and from Vättern to the Baltic Sea. Trollhätte Canal first begun construction in 1718. In 1800, Baltzar von Platen (1766–1829) completed the locks. Larger locks were later built under Nils Ericson (1802–1870). The further construction of the Göta Canal enabled larger boats to pass through Trollhätte Canal.

==Trollhättan Church==
Trollhättan Church (&quot;Trollhättans Kyrka&quot;) belongs to the Trollhättan congregation in the Diocese of Skara. Between 1860 and 1862, the New Trollhätte Canal Company (&quot;Nya Trollhätte Kanalbolag&quot;) built Trollhättan church. It was inauguration in 1862 and was handed over to the congregation as a gift. The church is erected in a neo-Gothic style after drawings by architect Adolf W. Edelsvärd (1824–1919). It consists of a longhouse with a north–south orientation. To the south is the tower with main entrance and to the north is a polygonal cairn. It is located on a cliff in the Göta River in the middle of the canal system.
At the expense of the canal company, a sacristy was built in the north-west in 1896–1897 with a rise to the pulpit, and the same year came glass paintings designed by Folke Zettervall (1862–1955). The window paintings in the choir, which was installed in 1962, are done by artist Ralph Bergholtz (1908-1988). The church was restored in 1983–84 with Jerk Alton as architect.

<text>Tjörn () is the sixth largest island in Sweden, located on the Swedish west coast in the province of Bohuslän.

The area of the island is , and the area of the municipality is . The population, as of 2017, was 15,774 people.

==Geography==

Tjörn is connected in the east to the town of Stenungsund on the mainland by the Tjörn Bridge, and to the island of Orust in the north by the Skåpesund bridge.

The largest town is Skärhamn, and it is also the municipal capital. Other communities, many of which are fishing communities, include Rönnäng, Klädesholmen, and Kyrkesund. The peninsula of Mjörn has large shell banks.
==Climate==
Tjörn has a maritime climate influenced by its location off the coastline. Even so, the proximity to the mainland means that the weather station of Rörastrand more resembles a mainland coastal climate than one of the archipelago.

==Tourism==
During the summer, the population swells from 15,000 to 45,000 as vacationers arrive for yachting and swimming. Skärhamn has a guest harbor to accommodate yachters travelling along the Swedish west coast.

<doc id="1019481" wikidata="Q983889" url="?curid=1019481" title="Tidaholm">
<text>Tidaholm () is a locality and the seat of Tidaholm Municipality in Västergötland Province within Västra Götaland County, Sweden, consisting of 520 square kilometers, or a little more than 200 square miles. It is located on the Tidan River, the only river in Sweden that flows north. Two islands are included within the municipality&#x27;s limits: Vulcanön and Turbinhusön, the former was originally Tidaholm&#x27;s industrial center and the latter historically housed the Turbine. As of 2021, there were 13,000 inhabitants.

==History==
Historically, the city was known as Agnetorp. Tidaholm was detached from Baltak parish as a merchant town (&quot;köping&quot;) in 1895. In 1910, it was established as the city of Tidaholm, and it has served as the seat of the much larger Tidaholm Municipality since 1974. In 1997, its county name changed as well, when Skaraborg County merged with the counties of Gothenburg, Bohus and Älvsborg to form Västra Götaland County.

Up until the early 19th century, Tidaholm was primarily a farming community but, in 1799, an ironworks factory (Tidaholms bruk) was established on the site of the Holmagården forge, which had roots dating back to the Middle Ages, and merged with several other business to manufacture furniture, wagons and agricultural implements. Nearly a century later, one of the bicycle-making Lindström brothers spent time in the United States, studying the early car industry. Once he returned to Sweden, the Tidaholmsbilen (the Tidaholm car) was the result, with most of the parts made at Tidaholms Bruk, especially once local engine production began in 1914. Between 1903 and 1934, the factory produced about 6,000 cars, mainly trucks, buses, fire trucks and other heavy vehicles. Known as &quot;Tidaholmarna,&quot; they were seen as far afield as Oslo and St. Petersburg.

In 1868, the Vulcan match factory (Tändsticksfabrik AB Vulcan), was founded on Vulcan Island, one of Tidaholm&#x27;s islands in the Tidan River. Although it was started with a little over 100 workers, by the early 1900s, it had become the largest manufacturer of matches in the world, and was employing more than 1,000 workers. Nowadays, Vulcan Tidaholm is the only remaining match factory in Sweden, with roughly 200 employees. Although the Lithographic Art Workshop has taken over its former headquarters, it carries on Tidaholm&#x27;s tradition of the lithographic arts that began with the design of intricate matchbox labels.

== Industrial gallery ==
== The islands ==
=== Vulcanön island ===

Both Tidaholm Bruk as well as Vulcan Tidaholm were headquartered on Vulcanön island and, nowadays, Tidaholm Museum is located here. Not surprisingly, the museum focuses on the town&#x27;s industrial history and its two major industries, and it keeps nine Tidaholm Bruk cars on permanent display. Although many buildings were demolished in the area, a lot of historic architecture remains.

=== Turbinhusön island ===
There is an art gallery at the former turbine house (Turbinhusön) open in the summer and close to Hellidens folkhögskola you will find Sweden&#x27;s only Lithographic Museum, as well as cafés and other small shops here.

== Sites ==

* Gamla Torget — Gamla Torget is effectively the city square. Surrounded by many historic 19th century buildings, it functions as a key gathering place for many local events.
* Idrottshistoriska Museet — The Sports Museum documents the history of local sports, celebrating the achievements of local athletes and sports teams.
* Tidaholms Stadsbibliotek — The public library is housed in a renaissance building from the end of the 19th century. It is also a location for temporary exhibitions.

== Greater Tidaholm ==

=== Helliden Castle ===
Hans Henrik Von Essen was both one of the owners of Tidaholm Bruk and a founder of Vulcan Tidaholm. He first built Helliden, a manor house, colloquially known as Helliden Castle, at the edge of the municipality in 1858. Today, it houses a high school and an adult education center.

<text>Strömstad is a locality and the seat of Strömstad Municipality, Västra Götaland County, Sweden with 6,288 inhabitants in 2010. For historical reasons, Strömstad is called a &quot;city&quot; despite its small population.

Strömstad became part of Sweden in 1658, as part of the Treaty of Roskilde, which transferred the Bohuslän province from Norway to Sweden. It achieved town status in 1676. Strömstad became an important sea-bathing and spa destination in the mid-19th century. The close proximity to Norway is evident throughout town, and cars and boats arrive daily from Norway. Despite its small size, Strömstad is a bustling town throughout the year due to its international ferry link to Sandefjord, Norway. This is particularly true for Easter (especially Maundy Thursday) and the months of June and July, when thousands of vacationing Norwegians are visiting Strömstad.

Strömstad claims to have more summer sunshine days than any other town north of the Alps. Strömstad has numerous daily ferries departing and arriving from Sandefjord, Norway. It is also home to a domestic ferry connection to the Koster Islands, a nature preserve which is Sweden&#x27;s westernmost populated islands.

It is home to Sweden&#x27;s largest deepwater harbor.

==History==
Originally, the province Bohuslän, where Strömstad is situated, was Norwegian territory, which was transferred to Sweden according to the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658.

At Strömstad, there was a small fishing village known as &quot;Strömmen&quot;. The town got small privileges as a merchant town (&quot;köping&quot;) shortly thereafter, which seems to have made it expand, because it is documented to have gotten a charter in 1676 by King Charles XI of Sweden, although some documents show it was already considered a city in 1672. As it was the seat for a merchant navy, the coat of arms was designed with such a ship, and has remained that way even after the use of sailing ships was discontinued in the 19th century.

The city was a seat for Sweden&#x27;s warfare against the Dano-Norwegians, and more than once it was conquered and reconquered throughout the centuries. The warlike King Charles XII of Sweden, for instance, used it as his outpost for his campaign against Norway in 1716–1718.

At the time it had a population of 300 inhabitants. But soon the fishing blossomed, and its population increased to 1,100 by 1805. The late 18th century also saw the spa and bathing attract visitors, a position it kept throughout the 19th century. In 1786 Sweden&#x27;s first hot baths were opened in the city. By 1917, its population was 2,949 inhabitants.

==Geography==

The municipality of Strömstad is located in the Bohuslän province of Västra Götaland County in western Sweden. It has an international border to Norway near Svinesund in the north. It has a total area of 472 km2 and is a coastal municipality. Strömstad is the administrative centre of the municipality, while minor towns include Skee, Kebal, and Svinesund. European route E6 traverses the municipality. Strömstad is the home of the Koster Islands. This archipelago consists of two main islands: North Koster (3.9 km2) and South Koster (7.6 km2). The islands are popular tourist destinations and the rural South Koster brags one of western Sweden&#x27;s largest sandy beaches. The nearby Kosterhavet National Park is home to the country&#x27;s largest seal colony. The islands are home to many vacation homes and various hotels. They are Sweden&#x27;s westernmost populated islands.

==Notability==

As the Norwegian alcohol taxes are higher than the Swedish ones, Norwegian shoppers have caused the Swedish alcohol retailing monopoly Systembolaget to open an extra store to cater for demand. When only one shop existed, the Systembolaget shop had the highest sales in Sweden, causing traffic congestion near the shop in the inner city. The Norwegians have been notoriously known for causing havoc on Maundy Thursday as this is a public holiday in Norway but not in Sweden. For Easter 2008 the city council decided to keep Systembolaget closed on Maundy Thursday.

The city is known for its yachting harbor, which can be very crowded in the summer.
From Strömstad is ferry line over to Sandefjord, Norway, at the west side of the Oslofjord and local ferries to the Koster Islands.

Strömstad is the setting for the play &quot;The Creditors&quot; by August Strindberg.

Black Metal band Dissection are from the city.

Author Emelie Flygare Carlén was born in the city in 1807. As a source of life in Bohuslän during the first half of the 19th century, she is invaluable. During the 1840s she was at the peak of her career, and was then Sweden&#x27;s most read novelist and the most well known abroad.

==Economy==
===Tourism===
It was an 18th-century spa resort, and currently sees a large influx of tourists from Norway.

Strömstad has a long tradition as a bathing city; it was home to Sweden&#x27;s first facilities for sea bathing, which was established in 1783. Besides tourism, other industries include fishing and fish processing. About 600 people commute to Norway for work.

The Bohus Line runs from Gothenburg through the industrial city of Uddevalla, before terminating in Strömstad. The city can be reached by train from Gothenburg, and from Smögen by bus. By car, it can be reached by taking Route 174 on European route E6. It is situated 100 km north of Smögen, and 25 km north of Tanumshede.

Strömstad has two daily ferry connections: an international route to Sandefjord, Norway, and a domestic route to the Koster Islands from Norra Hamnen. The Koster Islands are a nature reserve and the westernmost inhabited islands in Sweden. The islands enjoy more sunshine hours than almost anywhere else in Sweden.

==Attractions==

Skara is located by the E20 motorway, about northeast of Gothenburg, in the centre of Västergötland. Across the hills to its east is the somewhat larger town of Skövde, about away.

==Climate==
Skara has a humid continental climate, though it is influenced by maritime moderation in spite of its inland position. Its proximity to Kattegat and lake Vänern contributes to summers being slightly cooler than areas to the north-east, and winter temperatures mostly hover around the freezing point.

==History==
According to local legend, Skara was founded in AD 988, making it one of the oldest cities of Sweden. It was one of only two cities in what was to become Västergötland, the other being Lödöse. Skara was the location for the regional assembly, the &quot;Thing of all Geats&quot;.

With the Christianization of Sweden, around 1000 AD, Skara became the seat for the bishop and a religious centre for the ensuing centuries. There have been bishops of Skara in an unbroken succession to this day.

Many important assemblies were held in Skara in medieval times. Examples include the important Swedish chancellor meeting in 1326. A meeting of Swedish, Danish and Norwegians in 1458, decided upon the later Kalmar Union.

In the ensuing medieval centuries, monasteries and other churches were completed in the town. The first monastery was for the Dominican order, called the monastery of Saint Olaf, opened in 1234; the other was of the Franciscan order, known as Saint Catherine (or &quot;Katarina&quot; in Swedish), recorded in 1259.

The foundations of the Skara Cathedral are believed to stem from around 1050. The current cathedral was inaugurated in 1150, but findings during the last 50 years show it must be at least a century older. Its current appearance, however, stems from renovations in the 1880s by Helgo Zettervall, who also renovated the Cathedral of Uppsala.

===Middle ages===
Medieval artifacts have been found in or near the Skara cathedral. A chalice from bishop Adalvard the Elder, dead in 1064, was found in his grave in the 18th century. For a while the &quot;Adalvardskalken&quot; was used in the Holy Communion.

Some 44 pages of a book containing texts and hymns of 11th-century Catholic rituals, the Skara Missal, is held and exhibited in Skara.

Other ancient objects have been found during excavations of the monasteries and churches.

===Education===
There is a branch of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (&quot;Sveriges Lantbruksuniversitet&quot;) in Skara.
==Culture and attractions==
In the city centre, near the main square, is the imposing Skara Cathedral. Within walking distance from the Cathedral is the Museum of Västergötland and its adjacent open-air museum Fornbyn, featuring several old cottages and other historical buildings from the local area.

In early spring, several thousand cranes gather in and around Lake Hornborga, on their yearly migration from the south of Europe to northern Scandinavia. This is a very popular tourist attraction during a few hectic weeks in March/April.

Within the municipality but outside of the city is Varnhem, home to a medieval Cistercian abbey and the remains of possibly the oldest Christian church in Sweden. Just outside the abbey are the ruins of the Cistercian monastery, built around 1150 A.D.

There are several music and entertainment artists in Skara, giving it a notable spot among the cities. The Skara Sommarland is a popular amusement park with a reputation well known throughout the nation. Most notable is its water park with water chutes, artificial rafts, etc.

The official museum of Västergötland is in Skara. There is also a railway museum called Järnvägs.

<text>Castlemartyr (, formerly anglicised as &quot;Ballymarter&quot; or &quot;Ballymartyr&quot;) is a large village in County Cork, Ireland. It is around east of Cork city, 10 km (6 mi) east of Midleton, 16 km (10 mi) west of Youghal and 6 km (4 mi) from the coast. Approximately 1,600 people live in the village and its hinterland. It is situated on the N25 national primary road and the R632 regional road. The Kiltha River, a tributary of the Womanagh River, flows through the village.

It is home to a number of community and sporting organisations, a 15th-century tower house (Castlemartyr Castle, now a ruin), and an 18th-century country house (Castlemartyr House, now a hotel).

==History==
===Pre-history===
Traces of ancient civilisation, including from the Bronze Age, are to be found in the vicinity of Castlemartyr. This includes a group of tumuli (or barrow mounds), including three examples in the townland of Ballyvorisheen.

There is also evidence of the early inhabitants&#x27; attempts to defend themselves and their livestock against marauders and the threat posed by wild animals. These defences were in the form of ringforts (or &quot;raths&quot;), which were circular earthworks used as dwellings and farmyards. Examples of these structures are to be found in the vicinity of the village.

===Ballyoughtera===
Some of the earliest evidence for the existence of a town or &quot;vill&quot; in the vicinity of Castlemartyr is to be found in the Pipe Roll of Cloyne. This document lists all lands held by the feudal Bishop of Cloyne and the valuations put on those lands.
Ballyoughtera, now the site of a ruin and graveyard, had likely originally been a monastic settlement which under Norman influence and through their settlement became the focal point for a &quot;ville&quot; or feudal village.

There had been two adjoining medieval parishes, Cahirultan and Ballyoughtera and both are known to have been in existence by 1300 at least, when Ballyoughtera was valued at 5 marks and Cahairultan at 3 marks. A reference dated 1364 records that &quot;Richard Kerdyf holds the land of the whole Ville of Martyre&quot;. A ville implied a nearby mill where tenant farmers could grind their corn, and a castle, providing those tenants with protection. In this case the castle was Castlemartyr Castle, which was built (on the site of an earlier fortification) for James FitzGerald, 6th Earl of Desmond after his appointment as Seneschal of Imokilly in 1420.

Castlemartyr was known as &quot;Leperstown&quot; in ancient times because of the Leper House that is said to have existed near Ballyoughtera, itself said by Smith to have become a village of some note during the Middle Ages. Another historian, Lewis, states that Ballyoughtera Church was built in 1549, only to be destroyed during the conflict of 1641–1642. There is evidence to suggest that the Church was already in ruins before 1641 (probably as early as 1615) and that it was built before 1539, with a Chancel being added on later, possibly to cope with an expanding population in and around the village.

===The Fitzgeralds===
In the Norman invasion of Ireland, the FitzGerald dynasty (a Geraldine line) was granted lands in the barony of Imokilly. In 1575, the Cambro-Norman castle that they built, then called the castle of Ballymartyr, was attacked by Sir Henry Sidney, the Lord Deputy, who captured the castle. The Fitzgeralds of Imokilly were known to the local peasantry as the (&quot;Dogs of Blood&quot;) due to the blood-thirsty disposition they displayed.

===Demise of the Fitzgeralds===
During the Desmond Rebellion, the Fitzgeralds fought against the forces of Elizabeth I in the region. The Fitzgeralds, together with the other southern lords of the Hiberno-Norman stock (who had become &quot;more Irish than the Irish themselves&quot;), formed the Geraldine League to oppose the British attempts to force Protestantism on the Catholic populace and to rout the native chiefs and replace them with English landlords.

In 1581, the Earl of Ormond overran Imokilly; at Castlemartyr he captured the aged mother of the seneschal, John FitzEdmund, and hung her from the wall of the castle. FitzEdmund eventually submitted to the Earl, but he did not recover his lands. Instead, the property shared the fate of other properties after the Desmond Rebellion. It was confiscated and included in the grant of land between Lismore and Castlemartyr that were given to Sir Walter Raleigh. FitzEdmund himself was arrested in 1585 and died in Dublin Castle in the following year.

In 1602, Raleigh&#x27;s lands around Castlemartyr were bought by Richard Boyle, the First Earl of Cork and ancestor to the Earls of Shannon.
By the early 17th century the FitzGeralds were a spent force. In the south-east corner of the old church in Ballyoughtera, the stone has a boar crest surrounded by triple incised circles and shallow cross carving which is also encircle. At the northern end of Ballyoughtera church ruin is the grave of another Richard Boyle, 4th Earl of Shannon who died in 1868. This tomb bears the inscription, &quot;A sorrowing wife placed this stone in memory of the best and most affectionate of husbands&quot;.

===Earls of Shannon===
For the next two hundred years the history of Castlemartyr was closely linked with that branch of the Boyle family which have the title Earl of Shannon. In 1676, the town was incorporated with a charter, with its corporation and parliamentary representation in the control of the Boyle family. In 1689 it was a centre of Protestant resistance against the rule of James II, but was swiftly defeated by Irish Army forces under Justin MacCarthy who also put down a larger rising at Bandon.

After Orrery&#x27;s death in 1679, his title was passed on to his oldest son. Orrery&#x27;s second son had four sons of his own, Roger, Henry, Charles and William, and it was this Henry who became a member of the Privy Council of Ireland, Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. He was elevated to the peerage in 1756 as Baron Castlemartyr, Viscount Boyle, Earl of Shannon. It was he who provided the land for the construction of a new church in the village (St. Anne&#x27;s Church of Ireland) when an act of Parliament allowed for the dismantling of Ballyoughtera Church and the re-use of some of the stones on the new church.

It was also Henry Boyle, 1st Earl of Shannon, who was primarily responsible for the construction and expansion of Castlemartyr House. He also set about beautifying the estate between the years 1733 and 1764 and these improvements are mentioned in Smith&#x27;s &quot;History of Cork&quot;. On Henry&#x27;s death in 1764, the estate went to his son, Richard, who like his father attained high political office. Richard carried out further extensions to the mansion house. It was also during this period that Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown landscaped the estate and planted woods. Richard Boyle, 2nd Earl of Shannon received £15,000 in compensation when the borough was disenfranchised under the Acts of Union 1800.

===Famine===
Prior to the Great Famine (1845–1849), baptismal figures in the parish of Imogeela indicate a young and expanding population with an average of 238 baptisms between the years 1836 and 1840. The decline, however, in the years immediately after the Great Famine indicate that, by 1888, baptismal figures dropped to an average of 60 per annum. Almost a quarter of what they once had been. The effects in the parish (including emigration effects) are indicated in the marriage records, with an average of 55 marriages per year prior to 1844. While, in the decade immediately after 1847, the figure had been halved, and by 1888, there were just 2 weddings in the parish of Imogeela.

===War of Independence===
The War of Independence also affected the village. For example, on 9 February 1920, Castlemartyr&#x27;s local Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) barracks was seized by a company from the Irish Republican Army (IRA). At the time, the barracks housed a garrison of eight men, including RIC Sergeants O&#x27;Brien and O&#x27;Sullivan. Earlier that the day, Diarmuid O&#x27;Hurley, the officer commanding the Midleton Company of the IRA, learned that two of the Castlemartyr RIC were on duty at a fair in Midleton. As part of a plan to capture the barracks, O&#x27;Hurley decided to capture these two men as they returned to Castlemartyr later in the evening. About 5pm, after their bikes were blocked by a farm cart pushed through a gateway, the two RIC men were rushed by volunteers with revolvers drawn. The unarmed RIC men were bundled into a nearby farmyard where they were blindfolded and handcuffed. At approximately 7pm an RIC constable was captured by two volunteers as he emerged from the barracks, and held captive outside the town. O&#x27;Hurley, coming from Midleton with several other volunteers, picked up the two RIC prisoners at Churchtown and advanced to Castlemartyr, before knocking at the barrack door. A constable inside, sensing danger, slightly opened the door (which had a chain on the inside), thrust out his revolver and fired. O&#x27;Hurley got his own revolver through the opening also but it failed to fire, so he struck out at his opponent&#x27;s head, injuring him with a blow of his revolver and, at the same time, snapping the chain with a thrust of his foot. O&#x27;Hurley and his men were soon inside, and the remaining RIC men, under Sergeant O&#x27;Sullivan, surrendered. The volunteers removed all military equipment from the barracks without further opposition.

Separately, on the evening of 27 November 1920, Liam Heffernan, from Conna, was shot dead in the village. Heffernan was a member of &quot;B&quot; Company, First Battalion, First Cork Brigade (IRA), and employed as a chauffeur. The car he drove was sometimes used to convey officers of the local IRA Battalion. He and four members of the Fourth Battalion were in a car parked on Castlemartyr Main Street as the Battalion Vice Commandant was transacting some business nearby. Two passing RIC officers recognised Heffernan as he sat waiting in the car and, knowing him to be a member of the IRA, approached the car and began to question the occupants. Almost immediately, gunfire began. Although not confirmed, onlookers claimed that one of the RIC officers had shot at the occupants in the car without warning. On hearing the shots outside, the IRA officer rushed back and got into the car while shooting at the police officers. In the exchange of fire, one police officer was killed and the other was also hit. Though injured, Heffernan managed to start the car and drive it away. He swung the car sharply over the bridge and onto the Mogeely Road, but it had not gone far when it became obvious that Heffernan was dying. One of his companions took over the wheel, and they eventually reached Conna, where the local doctor pronounced Heffernan dead. An inscribed stone monument to his memory was unveiled in Castlemartyr on 23 May 1971, a short distance from the place he was shot.

===Rolling Stones===
While on tour in Ireland in January 1965, The Rolling Stones passed through the village on their way to play the Savoy Theatre in Cork. While Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts took tea at Mrs Farrell&#x27;s eating-house, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Brian Jones had a drink across the street at Barry&#x27;s Bar. The documentary &quot;Charlie Is My Darling&quot; depicts a brief sequence of these events.

==Today==

Located on the N25 road between Cork and Waterford, as of the 2016 census the majority of Castlemartyr&#x27;s 1,900 residents commuted less than 45 minutes to school or work. Employers in the area include the 5-star Castlemartyr Spa &amp; Golf Resort hotel, which (as of early 2018) had approximately 200 staff. Castlemartyr Enterprise Centre is housed in the former 19th century national school.

The population is served by Saint Joseph&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church (built c.1860), and Saint Anne&#x27;s Church of Ireland Church (built c.1731).

There are several pubs in the village, as well as a greengrocers and small supermarket. Local sports clubs include Castlemartyr GAA club (which plays hurling and football in the Imokilly division), and Mogeely Association Football Club (which plays soccer in the West Waterford and East Cork League).

It has been noted that under this definition, all of Götaland would be the country&#x27;s largest island, rendering Orust instead the fifth largest. The largest town on Orust is Henån, the municipal capital, where approximately 1,800 inhabitants live. Other communities, many of which are fishing villages, include Ellös, Edshultshall, Hälleviksstrand, Mollösund, Morlanda, Stocken, Svanesund, Svanvik and Varekil. Orust is home to approximately 15,160 inhabitants in the winter and many more in the summer. Its main industry is the shipyards, the two largest being Najadvarvet and Hallberg-Rassy.

<text>Mariestad () is a locality and the seat of Mariestad Municipality, Västra Götaland County, Sweden. It had 16,611 inhabitants in 2019. Until 1997 it was the capital of the former Skaraborg County and an episcopal see in the Church of Sweden between 1583 and 1646.

==History==

The city was founded in 1583 by Duke Charles, who later became King Charles IX of Sweden. The city is named after his wife Marie of Pfalz. The coat of arms for Mariestad, an ox stepping out of the water, is said to be what Marie of Pfalz saw by the bay of Tidan in Mariestad when she first arrived there.

==Diocese==
Mariestad is one of two Swedish cities with a cathedral without a bishop&#x27;s seat, the other being Kalmar. For political reasons, the diocese of Mariestad was presided over by a superintendent rather than a bishop from 1583 until 1646, when the superintendent was moved to Karlstad and the diocese of Mariestad was absorbed by that of Skara.

== Notable natives ==
* Gustavus Schmidt (1795–1877), American lawyer and lecturer
* Axel Lindahl (1841–1906), photographer
* Dag Wennlund (born 1963), javelin thrower
* Evelyn Mok (born 1987), actress and comedian
* Helena Andersson
* Anni Dewani

==Sports==
The following sports clubs are located in Mariestad:

* IFK Mariestad
* Mariestads BK
* Mariestad BoIS HC
* IBK Lockerud Mariestad
* Mariestads Motorklubb run a motorcycle speedway team called Örnarna at the Grevby Motorstadion.

== Climate ==
Mariestad has a maritime climate influenced by its position on lake Vänern and the relative proximity to the North Atlantic. The town has warmer weather than elsewhere in western Sweden due to the influence of Vänern counterbalancing the low-pressure systems from further west. Mariestad is also shielded behind the archipelago and the peninsula to its west, which makes it warmer than areas further southwest on the lake shore. This leads to sunny summers with average afternoon temperatures being about . Summer nights are very mild by inland standards due to the lake influence. Winters are often mild with infrequent snow cover with the lake being large enough to provide further moderation of cold snaps compared to towns on the east coast like Norrköping and Nyköping on the same latitude. Vänern often remains in a liquid state during winters due to mild temperatures.

<text>Lysekil () is a locality and the seat of Lysekil Municipality in Västra Götaland County, Sweden. It had about 7,600 inhabitants in 2018. Situated on the south tip of Stångenäs peninsula at the mouth of Gullmarn fjord, it has two nature reserves.

Originally a small fishing village, it developed into a town for fishing industries, commercial shipping and trade during the 18th and 19th centuries. Stone industry based on the red Bohus granite from quarries in the town, was also vital to Lysekil up until the 1950s. One of Sweden&#x27;s largest oil refineries, Preemraff Lysekil is situated outside the town.

During the 19th century, Lysekil was established as a prominent spa and bathing resort and tourism still makes up a large part of the town&#x27;s economy.

== History ==
Lysekil is first mentioned in 1570. It was originally an estate belonging to Lyse farm further inland. The population lived mostly on fishing and commercial shipping. The first settlement was on the north side on the tip of Stångenäs peninsula, where a natural, sheltered harbor is formed by a bay in Kornö fjord. The area is known today as North Harbour (&quot;Norra Hamnen&quot;). Before fixed lighthousees were built in the area, the local inhabitants would light false beacon fires, causing ships to run aground. Pillaging wrecks and also killing sailors who defended their stranded ships, was common along the coastline. During the Great Northern War (1700–1721), Lysekil was one of the harbors along the Swedish west coast where privateering became sanctioned by the government through the issuing of letters of marque. Charles XII of Sweden needed ships and men for the navy and one of the ways to get this was to give private ships and captains permission to seize and capture enemy ships and their crews.
When herring fishing peaked after 1750, fishing industries flourished in Lysekil. The main export products were salted herring and train oil made from boiled herring to extract the oil. During the Age of Sail, Lysekil became a center for fishing, shipping and transport. At the mid 1800s, the fishing village had a number of sailing ships. In 1909, 18 large sailing ships and 10 steamboats were registered in Lysekil. The harbor records that same year show 6,832 ships, including 185 foreign, coming and leaving.
During the second part of the 1800s, Lysekil developed into a bathing resort. The first warm water bath house was made from the cabin of a ship and the first real house was built in 1849. In 1859, Carl Curman became resident physician at the resort. He had studied the climate along the west coast and found Lysekil to be best suited for a spa town and through his contacts, the town became a resort favoured by the Stockholm socialite. New bathhouses, hotels and parks were built in 1864–1890 along the south side of the town, now known as the South Harbor (&quot;Södra Hamnen&quot;). Among those were the two Curman Villas built in Dragestil.

During World War II was one of the ports involved in Operation Bridford during which fast ships, called &quot;Blockade runners&quot;, could break through the German Skagerrak mine blockade and ship ball bearings to Kingston upon Hull, England. The same route was later used to bring supplies and ammunition from Britain to the Danish resistance movement.

On 19 August 1961, the only collision between a car and a submarine recorded in history happened in Lysekil.

== Geography ==

Lysekil is situated on the south tip of the Stångenäs peninsula on the Swedish west coast at the mouth of Gullmarn fjord. The town is surrounded on three sides by the sea and a number of islands and islets. The largest islands are Stora and Lilla Skeppsholmen, Skälholmarna, Valboholmen, Humlesäcken, Stångholmen, Släggö, Grötö, and Tova.

Lysekil is surrounded by harbors, piers, boardwalks and quays on all sides facing the sea. The two main harbors are North Harbor and South Harbor. At the North Harbor, the original small wooden cottages and houses from the first settlement, &quot;Gamlestan&quot; (Old Town), have been restored and rebuilt into a picturesque part of the town. Both the north and the south harbors have guest harbors as well as plenty of restaurants and cafés.

=== Nature reserves ===
There are two nature reserves in Lysekil, Stångehuvud and Gullmarn fjord. The red granite cliffs of Stångehuvud were bought for conservation purpose in 1920 by Calla Curman and in 1982, the area was established as a nature reserve. The cliffs make up the southwest end of Stångenäs peninsula. In 1983, Gullmarn fjord was designated as Sweden&#x27;s first marine conservation area.

== Economy ==
Starting out as a small fishing village, Lysekil developed into a place for fishing industry and refined fish products. Large amounts of train oil were also produced and exported to European countries as well as New York to be used in street lamps. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were around 40 factories in Lysekil. In 1893, Arvid Bernhard Öhnberg started the A. B. Öhnberg Canning Company which included the &quot;Ejderns&quot; brand, all now owned by Abba Seafood. They produced a special sort of caviar that is still one of the most popular sandwich spreads in Sweden. Lysekil Caviar, often referred to as creamed smoked roe, differs from normal caviar in that its main ingredients are cod roe, canola oil, sugar, onion, tomato sauce and salt; it is also often seasoned with dill. Kalles Kaviar is the best-known brand.
Granite quarries and stonemasonry were part of Lysekil&#x27;s industries in 1850–1950. The granite was much in demand for buildings and street paving in Britain, Germany, Denmark, Belgium and Argentine. In 1909, there were five quarries in Lysekil.

Tourism became a vital source of income for Lysekil in the 1850s. The town was established as a fashionable bathing resort. In 2018, tourism is still vital for the town&#x27;s economy. It has branched out to include more activities underwater diving, kayaking, sports fishing and seal safaris.

One of the largest oil refinery in Sweden, Preemraff Lysekil, situated a few miles outside the town, is one of the main employers in the area. Plans to build a refinery near Lysekil started in 1945 when the Swedish consumer-owned oil company Oljekonsumenters Riksförbund (OK), was formed. Negotiations for building the refinery were long and hard, and it was not until 1975 that it was inaugurated.

=== 2017 port project proposal ===
In late November 2017, pro-Beijing businessman and Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) member Gao Jingde, on behalf of a consortium led by Hong Kong-listed Sunbase International (Holdings) Ltd of which he is chairman, proposed building Scandinavia&#x27;s largest port at Lysekil.

== Transport ==

In 1910, Lysekil was connected with the rest of the Swedish railway network through the Lysekil Line, a branch railway of the Bohus Line. Passenger transport in the line, ceased in 1983, while some freight use remained. Maintenance in the line continued until 2016 with only a few trains running during summer. On 9 December 2018, all maintenance and traffic on the line will cease as the switch in Smedberg is disconnected.

The public transportation bus network in Lysekil is operated by Västtrafik. The network also includes a ferry, &quot;Elise&quot; (line 847), between Lysekil and Fiskebäckskil on the other side of Gullmarn fjord. &quot;Elise&quot; was preceded by &quot;M/S Carl Wilhelmsson&quot;, locally known as &quot;Calle Wille&quot; Another ferry service across the fjord from Lysekil, is the car ferry operated by Trafikverket Färjerederiet.

<text>Lilla Edet is a locality and the seat of Lilla Edet Municipality in Västra Götaland County, Sweden. It had 4,862 inhabitants in 2010.

Lilla Edet was the smallest of three settlements that were burnt down in Sweden on 25 June 1888. The wooden towns of Sundsvall and Umeå were almost completely destroyed. The triple fire was widely reported and one collection in California raised $5,000 and blankets and tents were sent from New Zealand.

The town Lilla Edet is situated on the eastern side of the Göta älv, a main river on the west coast of Sweden. It became known as a halt there. The area was known locally as Lilla Edet in comparison to Stora Edet, situated north of Lilla Edet and today known as Trollhättan. However, for a long time the official name of Lilla Edet was Bergaström.

== Lock system ==
A canal lock system was built at Lilla Edet as early as 1607, becoming the first of its kind in Sweden.

<text>Lidköping () is a locality and the seat of Lidköping Municipality in Västra Götaland County, Sweden. It had about 
40 000 inhabitants in 2021.

It is situated on the southern shore of Lake Vänern and sometimes refers to itself as &quot;Lidköping vid Vänern&quot;, to distinguish itself from Linköping near Sweden&#x27;s east coast. Attempts have been made to change the official name to &quot;Lidköping vid Vänern&quot; but these attempts have not been successful.

== Geography ==
The town of Lidköping is divided by the Lidan River, flowing through the central city. The eastern side of it is called the old town, and the western side is known as the new town.

The municipality of Lidköping is, together with its eastern neighbor Götene, located on the Läckö-Kinnekulle peninsula. In association with several large local companies, they have a colloquial tourism company known as &quot;Götene-Lidköping Vänern Turist AB&quot;.

== History ==
Lidköping got its charter on July 21, 1446, and thus qualifies as one of the now defunct Cities of Sweden. The city arms are almost as old. The design has varied throughout the centuries, but has always depicted a seated bishop. It is disputed if it depicts an actual bishop, but was in the 20th century decided to be a depiction of the bishop Saint Nicholas.

Around 1650, the city was incorporated into the countship of Jakob De la Gardie. However, in 1655 the crown decided to regain administration of the city. To make up the loss, De la Gardie was then given the right to found a new city on the western side of the river, starting in 1670. In 1672 the foundations were laid, and the new city grew quickly. In 1683, both sides of the city Lidköping were declared unified by the Crown, who also reclaimed possession of them both.

The old town burned down in 1849, and large parts of the new town were also damaged. Following the fire, both towns were rebuilt according to a check pattern.

== Symbol==
Lidköping is working hard to market itself as &quot;Lidköping by Vänern&quot;. In line with this quest, they are developing a profile plan, wherein they have established the use of a symbol depicting its location by Vänern. The symbol is used in all official contexts, and also on the road sign when entering Lidköping.

==Sport==

Villa Lidköping BK has one of the best bandy teams in Sweden. Five times they have reached the finals of Elitserien. Sparbanken Lidköping Arena is the home venue. 
In 2019 they won the gold medal for the first time under the leadership of Johan Sixtensson.

A control cable to the trailroad switches had been incorrectly reconnected after being dug up accidentally. When traffic was finally allowed to pass the station, the Gothenburg bound train was switched over to the opposite track where an outbound train was arriving, after a mistake in communication between the repairer and the traffic leader.
An off-duty trainmaster, reading the paper in one of the locomotives, heard the train driver say &quot;Helvete nu smäller det&quot; (roughly translated: &quot;Hell, now that&#x27;s a crash&quot;).

<text>Kungälv () is a city and the seat of Kungälv Municipality in Västra Götaland County, Sweden. It is also a part of Greater Gothenburg Metropolitan Area. It had 22,768 inhabitants in 2010. In 2021, the main Kungälv - Ytterby - Kareby conurbation had a combined population approaching 30,000.

==History==

According to official Swedish sources the city was founded in 1612, when the city of Konghelle was moved closer to the Bohus Fortress. However, this is disputed because other sources indicate that it was just a strategic relocation of the existing Norwegian city, the capital of Norway at one point under Sigurd I Magnusson, something frequently used for marketing and tourist purposes. For this reason, Kungälv could celebrate its &quot;1000-year anniversary&quot; in 1959.

Sigurd I Magnusson (&quot;Sigurd Jorsalfare&quot;, i.e., Sigurd the Crusader) was the King of Norway (1103–1130) and is the best-known crusader king of Scandinavia. He was also the first European king to join the crusades at a time where Kungälv was Norwegian territory.

Sigurd returned to Norway in 1111, where he made his capital in Konghelle (in the vicinity of Kungälv in present-day Sweden) and built a castle there, where he kept a relic given to him by King Baldwin, a splinter reputed to be from the True Cross. Sigurd died in 1130 and was buried in &quot;Hallvardskirken&quot; (Hallvards church) in Oslo, in present-day Norway.

In the 1120s Pomeranian ships from Stettin (present-day Szczecin, Poland), from the southern coast of the Baltic Sea attacked the Danish coast. On 10 August 1135 Duke Ratibor assaulted the Norwegian towns. Konghelle, was captured and burnt to the ground by the forces of prince Ratibor, assisted by a fleet of 550 ships with cavalry on board (each carrying forty-four men and two horses). They laid the town to ruins, killed a large part of the population, and abducted most of the survivors as thralls to Szczecin. Snorri Sturluson, writing a century later, said that Konghelle never completely recovered.

The former settlement at Konghelle burned down in 1612, and was subsequently moved by Christian IV of Denmark and Norway to the open slope below Bohus Fortress, and rebuilt as Kongelf.

The Bohus Fortress remains the most popular tourist attraction in Kungälv.

<text>Hjo () is a locality and the seat of Hjo Municipality, Västra Götaland County, Sweden. It had 6,094 inhabitants in 2010. The town is located on the west coast of Vättern.

==Etymology==
The place is named after Hjoån &#x27;Hjo river&#x27;. The meaning of the river name &quot;Hjo&quot; is probably &#x27;muddy&#x27;. The way the name is spelled have been changed many times. Some of the previous ways of spelling the name has been Hyo, Hio, Hiyo and Hioo.

==History==
Hjo is known to have had a charter as early as 1413. Hjo is, despite its small population, for historical reasons normally still referred to as a &quot;city&quot;. Statistics Sweden, however, only counts localities with more than 10,000 inhabitants as cities.

Many wooden towns have suffered fires, but Hjo has been relatively spared, apart from when the church and some adjacent houses burnt down in 1794. The city structure is therefore almost exactly the same as in medieval times.

Hjo works together with the cities of Eksjö and Nora to develop wooden towns as tourist attractions, under the joint name &quot;Three wooden towns&quot; (&quot;Tre trästäder&quot;).

In the year 2013, the city celebrated the town&#x27;s 600th anniversary.

== Tourist attractions ==
The steamship S/S &quot;Trafik&quot; is one of the oldest steamships in Sweden. In the summer, it goes on small trips, such as trips to Visingsö, the biggest island in Vättern.

Estrid Ericson, founder of Swedish interior decorating company Svenskt Tenn, grew up in Hjo, where her father ran a hotel.

Guldkroksbadet is a free entry outdoor bath containing 3 pools, the largest one measures 50 by 25 meters. There is also two smaller ones for children. Guldkroksbadet also has a beach where you can swim in the lake.

<text>Härryda () is a locality situated in Härryda Municipality, Västra Götaland County, Sweden. It had 968 inhabitants in 2010. Despite its name it is not the seat of the municipality, which is the much larger Mölnlycke. Härryda is the closest locality from the Göteborg Landvetter Airport, three kilometers (2 miles) from the terminal building. It is located right under the flight path, so there is a high noise level. Many residents work at the airport and are therefore more forgiving against airplane noise.

<doc id="1019508" wikidata="Q1554356" url="?curid=1019508" title="Gullspång">
<text>Gullspång is a locality and one of two seats of the Gullspång Municipality in Västra Götaland County, Sweden. As of 2010 it had 1,167 inhabitants.

==History==

Gullspång provided the name for a new municipality created through the local government reform of 1971, but the administration was placed in the more centrally located Hova, with just some minor offices in Gullspång.

Due to the long lasting rivalry between Gullspång and Hova the municipality avoids the term &quot;centralort&quot; (seat). Instead they are called the municipality&#x27;s two &quot;main localities&quot;.

== Economy ==

A major employer found in Gullspång is Partex Marking Systems, a company that manufactures markers for cables.

In Gullspång, Fortum also has a hydroelectric power plant using the water from the Skagern river to produce electricity. Fortum is quite a large employer in the town of Gullspång.

Vänerhamn AB, which has cargo ports around the entire Vänern, is a port of Otterbäcken. The port transports several million tonnes of freight each year.

== Notable people==
From 1939 to 1954, author Frans G. Bengtsson lived in Ribbingsfors Mansion, just outside Gullspång. There he wrote many of his works and left behind many books, writings, and notes which are now located in a designated area of the municipal library.

*Linda Bengtzing, singer who was born and raised in Gullspång,
*Magnus Karlsson, speedway rider
*Peter Karlsson, speedway rider
*Mikael Max, speedway rider 
*Olof Mellberg, football manager

== Salmon ==

In central Gullspång is a salmon-stair which was built in 2004. It was built to increase the population of the local Gullspång salmon (&quot;Gullspångslax&quot;). The salmon-stair was made possible by the installation of flood gates which filled the dry area with water from the Gullspångsälven river.

<text>Falköping () is a locality and the seat of Falköping Municipality in Västra Götaland County, Sweden. It had 16,350 inhabitants in 2010.

== History ==

The town of Falköping was first spoken of in the Icelandic &quot;Rimbegla&quot; (around 1100 A.D.), and is mentioned in the Westrogothic law. It was also an important site of pilgrimage due to its 12th-century church dedicated to Saint Olaf (&quot;Sankt Olofs kyrka&quot;). The town was heading for a shut-down during the 16th century and was even burnt to the ground by the Danish during the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War. However the town survived and was rebuilt.

Falköping or Falbygden (when meaning the agricultural landscape in which Falköping is located) is widely known for its ancient remains of Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age. The town is located between the two plateaus Mösseberg and Ålleberg. The location has been inhabited since the end of the ice age and cultivated by people for the last 6000 years. The oldest find is a form of megalithic tomb called dolmen, dating back to 3400 B.C. There are also 28 passage graves dating back to 3300 B.C.

Also several cists have been found here, they can be traced back to earlier Stone Age (&quot;Senneolitikum&quot;) 2400–1500 B.C and are believed to be built or inspired by travelers from the countries where this kind of grave was commonly constructed. Falköping is the only town in Europe with this amount of megalithic graves as visible contribution to the town image. 
== Local industry ==

Early industry in Falköping was the Victoria Brewery (sv. &quot;Victoriabryggeriet&quot;) (1856–1953), Haglunds Roller blinds factory (sv. &quot;Haglunds rullgardinsfabrik&quot;) (1885-) and Forss hat factory (sv. &quot;Forss hattfabrik&quot;) (1880–). In the early 20th-century (1900–) several companies were established, such as: Alton gold forgery (1928), Falköping dairy factory (sv. &quot;Falköpings Mejeri&quot;) (1930–), workshop industry Arkivator (sv. &quot;verkstadsindustrin Arkivator&quot;) (1940–) and the sewing factories Svaréns and Ottossons.

&quot;Falköpings Mejeri&quot; (Falköping dairy factory) is a co-operative dairy company which supplies milk to grocery stores in western Sweden. The Falbygdens Ost cheese factory supplies cheese to stores throughout Sweden. A &quot;dry port&quot; (sv. &quot;torrhamn&quot;) has recently been built in connection to the railway, enabling companies in the surrounding area to handle cargo in a more efficient way.

== Geography ==

The town is located where the Western Main Line () between Stockholm and Gothenburg meets the railline from Nässjö via Jönköping to Falköping. As it takes less than a one-hour train journey to reach both Gothenburg and Jönköping respectively, Falköping makes a good location for commuting.

== Notable people ==
* Madelen Janogy (born 1995), footballer
* Jan Karlsson (born 1966), Olympic cyclist

== Sports and leisure ==

Association football

Falköping has several football fields.

Clubs include:
* Falköpings KIK
* IFK Falköping
* Falköpings FK

Motor Sports

The Falköpings Motorklubb hosts car and motorbike racing at the Motorstadion, about 5 km west of the locality. The Club originally ran a motorcycle speedway team known as Falkarna, who raced in the Swedish Speedway Team Championship. The speedway track held the Continental Speedway final round of the 1952 Individual Speedway World Championship.

Walking routes

There is also an long pathway around the core of the town called &quot;Hälsoslingan&quot; (path of health). It is used for running and taking walks together with friends and family.

== The folk tale of The Riders of Ålleberg ==
According to local folklore, whenever the town of Falköping is in danger, the mountain-side of Ålleberg shall fall and reveal a troop of knight-like figures who shall ride out and vanquish the threat. They are known as &quot;Ållebergs Ryttare&quot; (The Riders of Ålleberg).

<text>Alingsås () is a locality and the seat of Alingsås Municipality in Västra Götaland County, Sweden. It had 24,482 inhabitants in 2010.

==Geography==
Geographically the city is situated by the outlet of the small rivulet Säveån into lake Mjörn. Transportation links are provided by the western main line railway (&quot;Västra stambanan&quot;) between Stockholm and Gothenburg, and by motorway through the European route E20. Next to Alingsås you can also find a small village called Sollebrunn.

==History==
Alingsås was founded as inhabitants from the city Nya Lödöse were made homeless as Danish troops burnt it down. Gustavus Adolphus granted Alingsås its Royal Charter in 1619, which makes it older than Västra Götaland&#x27;s largest city Gothenburg (which was granted its charter in 1621).

Among its historical inhabitants is Jonas Alströmer, who was born in Alingsås in 1685. Alströmer is credited for introducing the potato plant to Sweden. He also established a large scale draper&#x27;s industry there, which before long became Sweden&#x27;s largest. However, some too-optimistic calculations, devastating fires and political setbacks finally forced its closure in 1779.

In April 2021, archaeologists announced the discovery of 2,500-year-old Bronze Age ornaments which can be related with a woman of high status. Some of the necklaces, chains and pins, discovered by chance by the cartographer Tomas Karlsson, are very well preserved.

==Historical sites==

In different locations in Alingsås you can find several round craters carved in the rock. These are called Giant&#x27;s Kettles, and can vary a lot in size and depth. The biggest ones are in Brobacka, which is located on the way to Gräfsnäs. The Giant&#x27;s Kettles are common visiting sites for secondary school classes.

Gräfsnäs slottsruin is a castle ruin located by the lake Anten, just outside Alingsås. It was built in 1550 by Count Sten Eriksson Leijonhufvud, who already owned a castle on the other side of the lake, in Loholmen. After Eriksson&#x27;s death, 1568, his wife Ebba Månsson Leijonhufvud took care of the castle, and it would stay in the family until 1724. In 1634 the castle burnt to the ground, but was rebuilt as a magnificent castle in late renaissance style. In 1734 it burned down again, but the owner at that time rebuilt it to match what it had been. In 1834, exactly two hundred years after it had burnt for the first time, the castle was sold to Otto Ulfsparre for 110 000 barrels of schnapps. The day that the papers on the purchase were to be signed, the castle burnt - for the third time, with exactly 100 years between each of the three occasions. The last person to make the castle his permanent home was fisherman Nils Andersson, who paid his rent in fish. After his death, the roof was eventually removed to prevent the partying that the youths in the village were doing in the old castle. In 1911 the castle was restored by Västergötland-Göteborgs Järnvägs AB, and since 1930 it is cared for by Alingsås Municipality.
Alingsås museum was founded in 1928, and contains memorial collections of photographs and the municipal archives, as well as hosting several exhibitions. It has been closed to the public since spring 2010, due to rearrangement with the premises.

==Culture==
Alingsås is known for its cafes, 26 in total (in 2010), and is often called &quot;The Capital of Fika&quot;. Three of the cafes are included in the White Guide.

Karin Boye, a Swedish writer, committed suicide in a forest in the Alingsås city district of Nolby in 1941. The place is now a memorial, and a popular visiting site for schoolclasses, taking the &quot;Karin Boye tour&quot;.

Alingsås has an art gallery, libraries and a museum.

==Yearly events ==
Alingsås has a rich cultural life, and hosts a few different cultural events throughout the year. In October, Lights in Alingsås is held for one month; 6 European lighting designers get to light up selected sections of the city as they please. To help them, they get about 65 international students of architecture, and together they have one week to create the vision of the lightning designers, who act as workshop leaders. The public can then either walk the tour themselves or in guided groups, and it has over the years become very popular internationally. The project is a cooperation between Alingsås Kommun and Professional Lighting Designers&#x27; Association since 2000.

In the summer, a festival is hosted by Alingsås Kommun, called Potatisfestivalen (the Potato Festival). It is a city festival with different activities, such as concerts and performances.

== Education ==
* Alströmergymnasiet - high school

==Sports==
Alingsås has several sports associations. Swimming, figure skating, ice hockey, track and field, orienteering, soccer, handball and floorball are some of the more popular sports. There are two health centres, which host different types of group training as well as providing training machines.

AHK, the handball association of Alingsås, yearly hosts a tournament where teams from all over the country can join and play against each other. It is, according to the city&#x27;s history and nickname, called Potatiscupen (the potato tournament). The teams use the different schools in the area for accommodation.

Alingsås FC United, a women&#x27;s team, is the town&#x27;s most reputable football club. The team currently competes in the Elitettan, the Swedish second tier of women&#x27;s football below the Damallsvenskan.

<text>Charleville ( or &quot;An Ráth&quot;) is a town in County Cork, Ireland. It lies in the Golden Vale, on a tributary of the River Maigue, near the border with County Limerick. Charleville is on the N20 road and is the second-largest town between Limerick and Cork, the largest being Mallow. The Roman Catholic parish of Charleville is within the Diocese of Cloyne. Significant industries in the town include Kerry Co-op and the construction and services sectors.

==Names==
The old name for the place was Rathcogan, later Rathgogan or Rathgoggan, the last () still the name of the civil parish around the town. The name means Cogan&#x27;s &quot;rath&quot; (ringfort), after the family of Miles de Cogan, granted lands there after the 12th-century Norman invasion. The new town begun by Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery in 1661 was named Charleville after Charles II, who had been restored to the throne the previous year.

Later Irish speakers referred to the town as An Ráth &quot;the rath&quot;, a short form of the older Irish name. The name [&quot;Lorc&#x27;s &quot;rath&quot;&quot;] was first attached to Charleville in an 1849 collection of 18th-century Irish-language poems with English translations. The translation of an &quot;aisling&quot; by Conchúbhar Máistir Ó Ríordáin interpreted as denoting the town of Charleville. T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly felt that , like the more common , was a poetic name for Ireland. D. A. Binchy felt the term, also used by Aogán Ó Rathaille, did refer to a specific place, but likely somewhere in Muskerry, not Charleville. After the 1920 local elections, Sinn Féin-dominated councils loyal to the self-proclaimed Irish Republic often sought to replace placenames having British monarchic allusions with older Gaelic names. Although &quot;Rathgoggan&quot; was mooted by Charleville Rural District Council, Risteárd Ó Foghladha [&quot;Fiachra Eilgeach&quot;] advised that &quot;Ráth Luirc&quot; was the old name, and it was changed to Rathluirc in 1920. Ó Foghladh claimed Lorc was an ancient king of Munster; in fact Lóegaire Lorc was a mythical High King of Ireland.

The Placenames Commission was established in the 1940s to systematically determine the authentic Irish names of places, and based on its advice that &quot;An Ráth&quot; was the commonly used name among the last generations of local Irish speakers, this was legally made the Irish name in 1975. Thus the town had the anomalous position that its English-language legal name was an Irish name different from its Irish-language legal name. The name &quot;Charleville&quot; remained in common use. In December 1989, a plebiscite of residents under the Local Government Act 1946 voted on four names: of 2200 electors, 1500 (over 68%) voted for &quot;Charleville&quot;. Official documents before and after 1989 have often used &quot;Rathluirc (Charleville)&quot; or similar formulations. Local sports teams have a &quot;rath&quot; or fort in their crest, reflecting the Irish name.

The town of Charleville, Queensland, Australia may well have been named after the County Cork town.

==History==
Charleville was founded in 1661 by Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery. Roger Boyle had been a supporter of Oliver Cromwell in the English Civil War. When King Charles II was restored in 1660, he had to prove his loyalty to the crown. He did this by naming Charleville after the English king. The villages of Brohill and Rathgoggin, who in their former guise preceded the formation of the town of Charleville in the area, fell under the rule of the following political entities: the Eoghanachta of southern Munster, at some point by the Hiberno-Norman Lordships of Ireland 1169–1541 (although this rule was nominal rather than actual), and subsequently by the Kingdom of Desmond 1118 – 1596. The lands of Broghill and Rathgogan were purchased by 
Roger&#x27;s father Richard Boyle as a part of the Plantation of Munster and Roger subsequently established his residency there after the founding of Charleville. 

During the time of the Penal Laws, practising the Catholic faith was illegal. As a result, the parish of Charleville was amalgamated with the parishes Bruree and Colmanswell, both in the Diocese of Limerick. In 1704, Fr. Daniel Mac Namara of Bruree was registered as the Catholic priest for this very large pastoral area. The fact that Catholics had to attend Mass secretly meant that the old chapel in Holy Cross cemetery was abandoned. The remains of this church – now overgrown with ivy – are still to be seen in the centre of the graveyard. Indeed, like so many other pre-1700 churches, the old church of Holy Cross literally became part of the surrounding graveyard, in that several gravestones, both marked and unmarked, are to be found within the building itself. Upon one such gravestone is a Latin epitaph to none other than Seán Clárach Mac Domhnaill (1691–1754), who was, in his time, the Chief Poet of Munster, as well as a native of Charleville.

William Alcock Tully, commissioner of Crown lands in the Kennedy and Warrego pastoral districts and 2nd Surveyor General of Queensland spent his formative years here. during this time, He surveyed the townsite of Charleville, Queensland which he named after Charleville, County Cork.

<text>Warriors of Heaven and Earth () is a 2003 Chinese action adventure film directed by He Ping. The film&#x27;s notable cinematography captures a wide range of landscapes across China&#x27;s Xinjiang province. It was China&#x27;s official entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, though it did not get nominated.

==Plot==
The film is set in western China in 700 AD during the Tang dynasty, and revolves around two protagonists, the first whom is Lieutenant Li of the Chinese army. Li&#x27;s refusal to kill Göktürk women and child prisoners is classed as a mutiny, leading him to be expelled from the army and to become a fugitive, traveling through the Gobi Desert. Years later, he is saved by the survivors of a caravan which carries a powerful, mystical relic accompanied by a Buddhist monk. Li protects the caravan from Göktürks as well as the overlord of the region, Master An, who is hired by the Göktürk Khan to seize the relic.

The second protagonist, a Japanese emissary, Lai Xi, is ordered by the emperor of China to kill the fugitive, Li. In a twist of fate, Lai Xi discovers that the caravan is on a mission and helps Li to defend it, to ensure that it arrives at the capital safely. They promise to fight each other only after their duty is done, although that battle never comes to pass.

==Cast==
==Soundtrack==

The original score was composed by Indian composer A. R. Rahman. &quot;Warriors of Heaven and Earth: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; was released on CD featuring 14 tracks, which include excerpts from the score and 1 theme song, &quot;Warriors in Peace&quot;, sung by Taiwanese singer Jolin Tsai. Following the film&#x27;s release, the score and soundtrack were released in one album separately, under the title &quot;Between Heaven and Earth&quot;. The album also include the theme song, &quot;Warriors in Peace&quot;, in two languages, which are the Hindi version by Sadhana Sargam and English version by Sunitha Sarathy.

While signing the project, Rahman was working with violinist Joshua Bell on compositions based on poems by the Persian poet Rumi. This project was later cancelled. The score is completely acoustic with symphonic pieces and relatively little electronic sounds have been used. Performers of the score include The Czech Film Orchestra and Chinese soloists in Hong Kong. Other instruments, including the erhu, flute, duduk, dizi, taiko drums are featured.

<text>Clarecastle (&quot;An Clár&quot; or ) is a village just south of Ennis in County Clare, Ireland. From 2008 to 2016 the village saw a significant population increase due to its proximity to Ennis, Shannon and Limerick.

==Name==
The town is named after the Clare Castle, which stands on an island in the narrowest navigable part of the River Fergus. The Irish &quot;Clár&quot;, meaning a wooden board, is often used for a bridge. The name probably originated as &quot;Clár adar da choradh&quot;, which means &quot;the bridge between two weirs&quot;. Another explanation of the name is that the de Clare family gave the castle its name, since they had acquired land in Kilkenny and Thomond that included the castle. In 1590 County Clare was named after the castle, which is in a strategic location.

Clarecastle (Clare Abbey) is a parish in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe. It is also known as Ballyea/Clarecastle. Clare Abbey and Killone Abbey are linked by a footpath, the Pilgrim&#x27;s Road.

==History==
Clarecastle was once home to a port servicing a variety of cargo, used for exports and the delivery of items into the nearby town of Ennis, which could not be reached by navigation of the River Fergus.

==The Port of Clare==
The Port of Clare consisted of the main quay of Clarecastle and an additional berthing frontage downstream towards the estuary. Clare was a busy port during its time, allowing safe navigation and berthing for vessels close to the town of Ennis. The quay structure is approximately 155 metres in length and was completed in 1845 under the supervision of civil engineer Thomas Rhodes, Principal Engineer to the Shannon Commissioners. 

The quay is no longer used for cargo or large vessels, but is suitable for berthing of small craft and recreational use, with an annual community regatta being held in June. Navigation within the quay area for larger vessels is not available at all states of the tide, with the macro-tidal range resulting in almost dry conditions at low water springs. 

During the historical peak of commercial activity at the port, the complicated approaches to Clarecastle from the estuaries of the Shannon and Fergus, arising from issues such as limited depth for navigation exacerbated by the presence of estuarine intertidal mudflats and rhythmites, necessitated the use of maritime pilots and precluded very large vessels from accessing the quay. The sediment transport mechanisms in the estuary and lower Fergus are also influenced by historical land reclamation works. Navigation beyond Clarecastle towards Ennis is precluded by the presence of a barrage (dam) north of the quay, which serves to limit tidal influence upstream as part of a flood control strategy.

==Sports==
The local GAA team is Clarecastle GAA. The club&#x27;s colours are black and white and they are known as the Magpies.

==Notable people==
The composer Gerald Barry was born in Clarecastle in 1952.

Copper was mined in the area from the 14th century, and the name &quot;Åtvidaberg&quot; was originally the name of a &quot;bergslag&quot; (a type of mining community). The earliest known use of the place name is from 1467, as a compound of the words &quot;Åtvid&quot;, which was the name of the parish, and &quot;berg&quot;, literally &quot;mountain&quot;, but in this context referring to a mine.

The town&#x27;s development was to be directed by the noble family Adelswärd. Through investments in the 19th and early 20th century the town developed into a modern industrial town.

In the 1970s the industry was dominated by Facit, making calculators. It was a major sponsor of the football team Åtvidabergs FF, one of Sweden&#x27;s strongest teams in the 1970s. When Facit went bankrupt in the second half of the 1970s, it led to the downfall and degradation of the team.

At the end of the 19th century almost one third of the population of Åtvidaberg Municipality in Sweden emigrated to Ishpeming, Michigan in the United States as copper mines in the Åtvidaberg area closed down.[9] In 1994 this was commemorated by a plaquette at the Mormorsgruvan mine of Åtvidaberg.

<text>Valdemarsvik is a locality, situated alongside the bay of which connects to the Baltic Sea. It is the seat of Valdemarsvik Municipality which is located in Östergötland County, Sweden. The coastal area is a popular summer destination, particularly with Swedish tourists.

==History==

Valdemarsvik is surrounded by water. However, after the end of the last glacial period, it lay beneath the sea level. As a result of post-glacial rebound, the water withdrew as the land rose. The resulting appearance of fertile soil drew settlers in the Bronze Age, around 1500 BC.

The surrounding archipelago has had a bloody history: remains of shipwrecks at the bottom of the sea and Viking Age remnants witness of battles from that time. Industrialization occurred during the 1630s, when Valdemarsvik became a trade port for copper and leather; one of Sweden&#x27;s largest tanneries was located in Valdemarsvik. The town&#x27;s name was first mentioned in 1664.

==Tourism and entertainment==
Sailing to the to swim and fish is a popular summertime activity. Boat excursions and jetski rentals are also available.

Other recreational activities include bicycle rentals, golf, cinemas, canoeing, and horse riding. There are museums in the locality that can be visited. The glass artist, sculptor and painter has a studio, where visitors have the opportunity to be involved in glass blowing and the manufacture of glass. An &quot;October Market&quot;, held every 4 October, is both a market, with a range of goods to be sold, and a fair, featuring acrobats, cotton candy, live music and various amusement rides.

Many of Valdemarsvik&#x27;s restaurants and cafés are open all year round; other are open during the tourist season. Also, each year there is exists a special &quot;food competition&quot;. Dishes are to be made, the ingredients should, as far as possible, be locally produced and which a jury then assesses. The winning dish is then served at most restaurants in the municipality.

<text>Vadstena () is a locality and the seat of Vadstena Municipality, Östergötland County, Sweden, with 5,613 inhabitants in 2010. From 1974 to 1979 Vadstena was administered as part of Motala Municipality.

Despite its small population, Vadstena is, for historical reasons, still referred to as a &quot;city&quot;: though it received its city privileges in 1400), Statistics Sweden only counts as cities Swedish urban localities with more than 10,000 inhabitants.

==History==
Above all, the city of Vadstena is noted for two important facts of Swedish history. It was in Vadstena, year 1350, that Saint Bridget of Sweden founded the first monastery of her Bridgettine Order, and Vadstena Castle is one of Sweden&#x27;s best-preserved castles from the era of Gustav Vasa in the 16th century, when Sweden became Protestant. Today the surviving buildings of the monastery are occupied by a hotel, (Vadstena Klosterhotel), and the castle houses the provincial archives and a museum of 16th and 17th century furniture, portraits and paintings.

Since the 16th century, Vadstena has been the location of a hospital. Earlier in history, it mainly housed mental patients. Today, some of the oldest buildings present the Vadstena Hospital Museum.

The buildings in the city centre date mainly from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. The old town is well preserved and the streets have not changed much over the centuries. The Town Hall is Sweden&#x27;s oldest, dating back to the early 15th century. Notable is the main street (&quot;Storgatan&quot;) where all the shops are gathered, as they would have been during the Middle Ages.

The botanist Erik Acharius died in Vadstena (1819).

==Railway==
Vadstena also preserves elements of more recent history in the museum of the Vadstena-Fågelsta narrow gauge railway (Wadstena Fogelsta Järnväg). This 891 mm (or Swedish three foot) railway was once part of a large network of narrow-gauge railways in Östergötland constructed in the latter part of the 19th century.

<text>Söderköping is a locality and the seat of Söderköping Municipality, Östergötland County, Sweden with 6,992 inhabitants in 2010. Söderköping is, despite its small population, for historical reasons normally still referred to as a &quot;town&quot;. Statistics Sweden, however, only counts localities with more than 10,000 inhabitants as towns. Söderköping is about 15 km southeast of the city of Norrköping.

== History ==

Sigismund III Vasa became king of both Sweden and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in a personal union upon his election to the Swedish throne in 1592 amidst much controversy and religious strife. The Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation were in full swing and at odds everywhere in Europe in the day. Subsequently, in 1593, he signed an agreement to guarantee religious freedom to the Protestant majority of Sweden and to pacify the Protestant concerns overall by all sects and the religion-generated unrest in the country settled down for a time once the agreement was in place, but it came to rise refreshed and stronger in 1594 because of Sigismund&#x27;s actions.

In 1595 the Riksdag of the Estates assembled at Söderköping (consequently sometimes known as the &quot;Riksdag of Söderköping&quot;) and elected Duke Charles IX of Sweden as regent of Sweden in place of his Catholic nephew Sigismund—though it did not formally depose Sigismund—because he had violated his agreement as king-elect and that of 1593 with the Uppsala Synod and had instead championed Catholic Counter-Reformation measures, appointed Catholics to high offices and established catholic schools during this religiously volatile era—all in violation of his agreement with the Synod in 1593. The renewed controversy came to a head in 1594, resulting in the Riksdag setting aside his authority, and the whole history of Sigismund with his claim on the Swedish throne became a succession of trigger events leading to the subsequent seven decades of dynastic warfare known as the Polish–Swedish wars. He was formally deposed by the Riksens ständer at Linköping, 24 February 1600, which declared he had abdicated his throne. The same Riksdag approved the execution of eight of Charles IX&#x27;s opponents in the Swedish nobility as allies of King Sigismund.

In the early middle-ages it was the most important port in Sweden at the confluence of the Storån and Lillån rivers trading mainly with Lubeck, principally in salt, textiles, butter and beer. Silting eventually led to its demise as a trading centre. Söderköping stands at the eastern end of the Göta Canal, a 390-km long canal opened in 1832 to connect Gothenburg to the Baltic Sea by inland waterway.

== Sights ==
Two churches built in the early 13th century are located near the city center, St. Lawrence&#x27;s Church and Drothem Church.

Today Söderköping is visited by foreign tourists taking boat tours of the Göta Kanal and is a popular destination for residents of the area. An ice cream shop on the banks of Göta Kanal, Smultronstället, is a well-known attraction. Many adventurers gather in Söderköping as several climbing routes are right in the city centre and the archipelago is just a few miles away. In autumn every year is &quot;Söderköpings gästabud&quot; arranged, a medieval festival.
