<text>Stac Electronics, originally incorporated as State of the Art Consulting and later shortened to Stac, Inc., was a technology company founded in 1983. It is known primarily for its Lempel–Ziv–Stac lossless compression algorithm and Stacker disk compression utility for compressing data for storage.

==History==
===1983–1994===
The original founders included five Caltech graduate students in Computer Science (Gary Clow, Doug Whiting, John Tanner, Mike Schuster and William Dally), two engineers from the industry (Scott Karns and Robert Monsour) and two board members from the industry (Robert Johnson of Southern California Ventures and Hugh Ness of Scientific Atlanta). The first employee was Bruce Behymer, a Caltech undergraduate in Engineering and Applied Science.

Originally headquartered in Pasadena, California and later in Carlsbad, California, the company received venture capital funding to pursue a business plan as a fabless chip company selling application-specific standard products to the tape drive industry. The plan was to include expansion into the disk drive market, which was much larger than the tape drive market. Following the success of Cirrus in the disk drive market, this was the real basis for venture capitalists&#x27; interest in Stac.

As part of the application engineering to adapt its data compression chips for use in disk drives, the company implemented a DOS driver that transparently compressed data written to a PC hard disk and decompressed the data transparently upon subsequent hard disk reads. In doing so, they discovered that given the relative speed difference between the PC processor and the disk drive access times, it was possible to perform the data compression in software, obviating the need for a data compression chip in every disk drive, as they were planning to produce. This DOS driver was written in x86 assembly language under contract by Paul Houle.

In 1990, the company released Stacker, a disk compression utility. The product was highly successful, due to the relatively small capacities (20 to 80 megabytes) and high prices of contemporary hard drives, at a time when larger software packages such as Microsoft&#x27;s new Windows user interface were becoming popular. On average, Stacker doubled disk capacity, and usually increased disk performance by compressing the data before writing and after reading, compensating for the relative slowness of the drives. Stac sold several million units of Stacker over the product&#x27;s lifetime.

They also released a hardware product called &quot;STAC Coprocessor Card&quot;, which claimed to not only improve the compression of the files, but to decrease the time needed to compress files. Salient Software would license Stac&#x27;s acceleration technology for use in their NuBus &quot;DoubleUp&quot; and PDS &quot;Bullet&quot; cards for the Macintosh, though they would use Salient&#x27;s own DiskDoubler software.

===1994–2002===
At some time prior to 1996, the company relocated its main office from Carlsbad to Carmel Valley, in San Diego, and maintained a programming group in Estonia. After settling the lawsuit with Microsoft, Stac attempted to expand its product portfolio in the utility software segment by adding additional storage and communication titles through internal development and acquisition. The company scrambled to replace the revenues lost after the market for hard drive compression software collapsed with the inclusion of DoubleSpace in MS-DOS and the rapid decline in hard disk cost per megabyte. Using the funds from its IPO (1992) and the settlement with Microsoft, Stac acquired a remote desktop software product called &quot;ReachOut&quot;. It acquired a server image backup product, &quot;Replica&quot;, and internally developed a network backup product for workstations and laptops, and marketed this product first as &quot;Replica NDM&quot; and later as &quot;eSupport Essentials&quot;. Much of the technology pioneered in Stac&#x27;s network backup offering ultimately found its way into today&#x27;s online backup solutions.

Meanwhile, Stac&#x27;s original chip business continued to grow. In order to realize shareholder value, its chip subsidiary called Hifn, was spun off in 1998 in a primary public offering.

Stac then renamed the remaining utility software company to &quot;Previo&quot;, and repositioned itself as a help desk and support organization tool provider. This effort was pursued while the dot-com bubble was bursting, and in 2002 management elected to take the unusual step of selling Stac&#x27;s remaining technology assets (to Altiris) and returning its remaining cash to shareholders before dissolving.

==Controversy==
=== Microsoft lawsuit ===
In 1993, Microsoft released MS-DOS 6.0, which included a disk compression program called DoubleSpace. Microsoft had previously been in discussions with Stac to license its compression technology, and had discussions with Stac engineers and examined Stac&#x27;s code as part of the due diligence process. Stac, in an effort led by attorney Morgan Chu, sued Microsoft for infringement of two of its data compression patents. Meanwhile, Microsoft had filed an injunction against Stac to prevent the company from selling its Stacker 3.1 software for Windows and DOS, attracting claims from Stac representatives that with a licensing deal having been made with rival DOS vendor, Novell, and with Microsoft no longer facing action from the Federal Communications Commission, the company had become emboldened to &quot;dominate the data compression market&quot;. In 1994, a California jury ruled the infringement by Microsoft was not willful, but awarded Stac $120 million in compensatory damages, coming to about $5.50 per copy of MS-DOS 6.0 that had been sold. The jury also agreed with a Microsoft counterclaim that Stac had misappropriated the Microsoft trade secret of a pre-loading feature that was included in Stacker 3.1, and simultaneously awarded Microsoft $13.6 million on the counterclaim.

While Microsoft prepared an appeal, Stac obtained a preliminary injunction from the court stopping the sales of all MS-DOS products that included DoubleSpace; by this time Microsoft had already started shipping an &quot;upgrade&quot; of MS-DOS to its OEM customers that removed DoubleSpace. By the end of 1994, Microsoft and Stac settled all pending litigation by agreeing that Microsoft would make a $39.9 million investment in Stac Electronics, and additionally pay Stac about $43 million in royalties on their patents.

<text>Bernard C. Parks (born December 7, 1943) is an American politician who served as a member of the Los Angeles City Council, representing the 8th district in South Los Angeles from 2003 to 2015. A member of the Democratic Party, Parks served as Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department from August 1997 to May 2002.

==Early life and education==
Parks is a graduate of Daniel Murphy High School and attended Los Angeles City College and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Pepperdine University. He earned a Master&#x27;s Degree in public administration from the University of Southern California.

==Career==
During his tenure, the LAPD was rocked by a corruption and police brutality scandal involving the elite C.R.A.S.H. anti-gang unit of the Rampart Division in the overwhelmingly Latino Pico-Union and Westlake districts. The Police Commission, under Commission President Rick J. Caruso did not recommend Parks for reappointment as police chief. Parks was succeeded as chief by William Bratton.

In 2003, Parks won the seat on the Los Angeles City Council for Council District 8 representing South Los Angeles. He also unsuccessfully ran for the post of mayor in the 2005 elections, coming fourth in the primary. In 2008, Parks unsuccessfully sought to succeed Yvonne Brathwaite Burke on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, losing to Mark Ridley-Thomas in a runoff election. Term limits forced Parks out of the city council office in 2015. Marqueece Harris-Dawson won the District 8 election for the vacant seat, and replaced Parks on 1 July 2015.

<doc id="1023547" wikidata="Q3207748" url="?curid=1023547" title="The Conquest of Granada">
<text>The Conquest of Granada by the Spaniards (1672), by John Dryden, is a two-part tragedy about the Spanish conquest of Granada (1482–1491), and the fall of Muhammad XII of Granada, the last Nasrit ruler of the Emirate of Granada (1230–1492), in southern Iberia. As a stageplay from the period of the English Restoration (1660), &quot;The Conquest of Granada&quot; is an example of the heroic drama genre in which the playwright Dryden was a pioneer writer; the first performance of the play was in 1670 and the first publication of the play was in 1672. 

==Plot==
&quot;The Conquest of Granada by the Spaniards&quot; concerns the Battle of Granada (1482–1491), fought between the Moors and the Spanish, which led to the fall of the Emirate of Granada (1230–1492). The action concerns two factions of Moors, the Abencerrages and the Zegry. The hero of the play is Almanzor, who fights for the Moors, and falls in love with Almahide, who is betrothed to Boabdelin, the King of the Moors. Although Almahide reciprocates Almanzor&#x27;s love, she will not betray her betrothal to King Boabdelin, who is emotionally distressed by jealousy of and military need for Almanzor in fighting the Spaniards during the Reconquista. 

In the course of events, Almanzor and Almahide remain separated until the death of Boabdelin. Additional to the protagonist&#x27;s love story, two other plots involve frustrated love: (i) Abdalla, brother of King Boabdelin, and Abdelmelich, leader of the Abencerrage faction, vie for the love of Lyndaraxa, sister of the Zegry leader; and (ii) Niggr, a young man from the Abencerrage faction, loves Benzayda, who is a Zegry woman. The course of the personal dram reveals that Almanzor is the lost son of the Duke of Arcos, but dutifully fights the Spaniards for the Moors.

==Genre==
The playwright John Dryden wrote &quot;The Conquest of Granada by the Spaniards&quot; in closed couplets of iambic pentameter, and in the &quot;Preface&quot; to the printed edition of the play, Dryden proposed a new genre of drama that celebrated heroic figures and heroic actions in metre and rhyme that emphasised the dignity of heroic action. The innovation is the poetic diction in English metre and vocabulary that corresponded to the verse structure of Latin. The closed iambic couplet is also known as the &quot;heroic couplet&quot;. Concerning the substance of an heroic play, Dryden said that heroic drama must demonstrate the Classical virtues of strength of character and masculine decisiveness.

==Satire==
The fame of the play invited satire of &quot;The Conquest of Granada&quot; by other playwrights. One example is &quot;The Rehearsal&quot;, written by George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. Henry Fielding, in &quot;Tragedy of Tragedies, or the Life and Death of Tom Thumb the Great&quot; (1730) also takes aim at the silliness of some of &quot;The Conquest of Granada.&quot; For example, the lofty aims expressed in the &quot;Preface&quot; to Fielding&#x27;s play seem mismatched to the material.

==Performance==
The original 1670 production of &quot;The Conquest of Granada by the Spaniards&quot; was by the King&#x27;s Company, and featured Edward Kynaston as &quot;Mahomet Boabdelin, last King of Granada&quot;, Charles Hart as Almanzor, and Nell Gwyn as Almahide, Rebecca Marshall as Lyndaraxa, Elizabeth Boutell as Bezayda, and Edward Lydall as Prince Abdalla, William Beeston as Ozmyn, Richard Bell as the Duke of Arcos, and Michael Mohun as Abdemelech, Martin Powell as Gomel, Marmaduke Watson as Hamet, and William Cartwright as Abenamar, Elizabeth James as Isabella and William Wintershall as Selin. Nell Gwyn spoke the Prologue to Part 1 of &quot;The Conquest of Granada&quot;.

<text>Diopside is a monoclinic pyroxene mineral with composition . It forms complete solid solution series with hedenbergite () and augite, and partial solid solutions with orthopyroxene and pigeonite. It forms variably colored, but typically dull green crystals in the monoclinic prismatic class. It has two distinct prismatic cleavages at 87 and 93° typical of the pyroxene series. It has a Mohs hardness of six, a Vickers hardness of 7.7 GPa at a load of 0.98 N, and a specific gravity of 3.25 to 3.55. It is transparent to translucent with indices of refraction of nα=1.663–1.699, nβ=1.671–1.705, and nγ=1.693–1.728. The optic angle is 58° to 63°.

==Formation==

Diopside is found in ultramafic (kimberlite and peridotite) igneous rocks, and diopside-rich augite is common in mafic rocks, such as olivine basalt and andesite. Diopside is also found in a variety of metamorphic rocks, such as in contact metamorphosed skarns developed from high silica dolomites. It is an important mineral in the Earth&#x27;s mantle and is common in peridotite xenoliths erupted in kimberlite and alkali basalt.

==Mineralogy and occurrence==

Diopside is a precursor of chrysotile (white asbestos) by hydrothermal alteration and magmatic differentiation; it can react with hydrous solutions of magnesium and chlorine to yield chrysotile by heating at 600 °C for three days. Some vermiculite deposits, most notably those in Libby, Montana, are contaminated with chrysotile (as well as other forms of asbestos) that formed from diopside.
At relatively high temperatures, there is a miscibility gap between diopside and pigeonite, and at lower temperatures, between diopside and orthopyroxene. The calcium/(calcium+magnesium+iron) ratio in diopside that formed with one of these other two pyroxenes is particularly sensitive to temperature above 900 °C, and compositions of diopside in peridotite xenoliths have been important in reconstructions of temperatures in the Earth&#x27;s mantle.

Chrome diopside () is a common constituent of peridotite xenoliths, and dispersed grains are found near kimberlite pipes, and as such are a prospecting indicator for diamonds. Occurrences are reported in Canada, South Africa, Russia, Brazil, and a wide variety of other locations. In the US, chromian diopside localities are described in the serpentinite belt in northern California, in kimberlite in the Colorado-Wyoming State Line district, in kimberlite in the Iron Mountain district, Wyoming, in lamprophyre at Cedar Mountain in Wyoming, and in numerous anthills and outcrops of the Tertiary Bishop Conglomerate in the Green River Basin of Wyoming. Much chromian diopside from the Green River Basin localities and several of the State Line Kimberlites have been gem in character.

==As a gem==
Gemstone quality diopside is found in two forms: black star diopside and chrome diopside (which includes chromium, giving it a rich green color). At 5.5–6.5 on the Mohs scale, chrome diopside is relatively soft to scratch. Due to the deep green color of the gem, they are sometimes referred to as Siberian emeralds, although they are on a gemological level completely unrelated, emerald being a precious stone and diopside being a semi-precious stone.

Green diopside crystals included within a white feldspar matrix are also sold as gemstones, usually as beads or cabochons. This stone is often marketed as &#x27;green spot jasper&#x27; or green spot stone&#x27;.

&quot;Violane&quot; is a manganese-rich variety of diopside, violet to light blue in color.

==Etymology and history==
Diopside derives its name from the Greek &quot;dis&quot;, &quot;twice&quot;, and &quot;òpsè&quot;, &quot;face&quot; in reference to the two ways of orienting the vertical prism.

Diopside was discovered and first described about 1800, by Brazilian naturalist Jose Bonifacio de Andrada e Silva.

==Potential uses==

Diopside based ceramics and glass-ceramics have potential applications in various technological areas. A diopside based glass-ceramic named &#x27;silceram&#x27; was produced by scientists from Imperial College, UK during the 1980s from blast furnace slag and other waste products. They also produced glass-ceramic is a potential structural material. Similarly, diopside based ceramics and glass-ceramics have potential applications in the field of biomaterials, nuclear waste immobilization and sealing materials in solid oxide fuel cells.

<text>The common echymipera (Echymipera kalubu), or common spiny bandicoot, is a bandicoot. It is long-snouted even by bandicoot standards. The upper parts are a coarse reddish-brown, flecked with spiny buff and black hairs. The tail is short and almost hairless. Length varies between , with the tail accounting for an additional ; the weight is from .

==Names==
The name kalubu, from which the scientific name is derived, is from the Ma&#x27;ya language of the Raja Ampat Islands.

==Distribution==
The common echymipera is native to New Guinea. Its presence in the Admiralty Islands is due to human introduction several thousand years ago, but not before 13,000 B.P. However, unlike Phalangeridae species (cuscus), which have historically been widely introduced and distributed by humans, the Peramelidae (bandicoots) have generally not been spread as much via human introductions.

It is hunted for human consumption in New Guinea. The Common echymipera is a host of the Acanthocephalan intestinal parasite &quot;Australiformis semoni&quot;.

<doc id="1023559" wikidata="Q464719" url="?curid=1023559" title="Ivan Serov">
<text>Ivan Alexandrovich Serov (; 13 August 1905 – 1 July 1990) was a Soviet intelligence officer who served as Chairman of the KGB from March 1954 to December 1958 and Director of the GRU from December 1958 to February 1963. Serov was NKVD Commissar of the Ukrainian SSR from 1939 to 1941 and Deputy Commissar of the NKVD under Lavrentiy Beria from 1941 to 1954. 

Serov was active in organising NKVD activities against anti-Soviet forces during the Soviet Invasion of Poland and World War II, including the Katyn massacre. Serov issued the Serov Instructions and helped organise the mass deportations of people from Poland, Baltic states and the Caucasus. Serov helped establish secret police forces in the Eastern Bloc after the war and played an important role in suppressing the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Serov was removed from power in 1963 after his protégé, GRU Colonel Oleg Penkovsky, was exposed as a mole passing classified documents to both British and American intelligence. In retaliation, Serov was stripped of his position, rank, Communist Party membership and Hero of the Soviet Union award in 1965. He lived in obscurity until his death in 1990.

==Early life and military career==
Ivan Alexandrovich Serov was born on 13 August 1905 in Afimskoe, a village in the Vologda Governorate of the Russian Empire, into a Russian peasant family. In 1923, when he was 18 years old, Serov joined the Red Army shortly after the end of the Russian Civil War. In 1926, he became a member of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and in 1928 graduated from the Artillery Officers&#x27; School of Leningrad. A major step in his career as a Red Army officer was his attendance in the mid-1930s of Higher Academic Courses in the prestigious Frunze Military Academy. He married during these years and had two children: a son, Vladimir, who became an engineering officer in the USSR Air Force followed by a daughter, Svetlana.

===Commissar of Ukraine===
In 1939, Serov joined the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), the main security agency and secret police of the Soviet Union. He was appointed to the high-ranking position of NKVD Commissar of the Ukrainian SSR in 1940. As well as performing his duties in this post, Serov was also responsible for the co-ordination of deportation from the Baltic States and Poland. He was one of the top ranked officials responsible for the Katyn massacre of Polish officer POWs.

In 1956, an article in &quot;Time&quot; magazine accused Serov of being responsible for the death of &quot;hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian peasants&quot; during this period. Serov was also a colleague in Ukraine of Nikita Khrushchev, the local Head of State. 

===Deputy Commissar of the NKVD===
In 1941, Serov was promoted to Deputy Commissar of the NKVD as a whole, becoming one of the primary lieutenants of NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria. In this function, Serov was responsible for the mass deportation of a variety of Caucasian peoples, including the deportation of the Chechens. He issued the so-called Serov Instructions, which detailed procedures for mass deportations from the Baltic States, which was for some time confused with the NKVD Order No. 001223 by historians. He also coordinated the mass expulsion of Crimean Tatars from the Crimean ASSR at the end of World War II. Viktor Suvorov claims that in 1946, Serov had oversight of the execution of Andrey Vlasov and the rest of the command of the Russian Liberation Army, an organisation that had co-operated with the Nazis in World War II.

Serov was one of the senior figures in SMERSH, the wartime counterintelligence department of the Red Army, Soviet Navy and NKVD troops, serving as a deputy to Viktor Abakumov. It was in this function that he founded the Ministry of Public Security, the secret police of the Soviet-backed Polish People&#x27;s Republic until 1956, acting as its main Soviet advisor and organiser. Serov organised the repression of the anti-Soviet Home Army and helped to establish Stalinism in Poland.

In 1945, Serov was transferred to the 2nd Belorussian Front and went to Berlin in May that year. He stayed there until 1947 and helped to organise a security agency that would become the Stasi, the secret police of the German Democratic Republic. Serov was also there to monitor and spy on Marshal Georgy Zhukov (of whom Stalin was personally suspicious) while acting as his political advisor.

==Chairman of the KGB==
After the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953, Serov was one of the few senior members of the political police to survive the wave of demotions and forced retirements of Stalinist officials. Serov, who had Beria&#x27;s trust, betrayed him when he conspired with officers of GRU to avoid his own downfall.

In March 1954, Serov was appointed Chairman of the KGB, making him head of the greater part of the Soviet secret police. Serov organised security for the tours of Nikolai Bulganin and Nikita Khrushchev in the United Kingdom, where he was decried by the British media as &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; and &quot;the Butcher&quot;.

===Hungary===
Serov played a key role in the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 which attempted to overthrow the Soviet-backed Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic. Serov was active in Hungary, sending reports to the Kremlin from Budapest, and escorting visiting Soviet Presidium leaders Anastas Mikoyan and Mikhail Suslov via an armoured personnel carrier into Budapest on 24 October, as there was too much shooting in the streets. Serov organised the deportation of Hungarian revolutionaries, including Nagy, and also tried stopping The Workers&#x27; Council of Budapest from negotiating for the return of deportees and political rights, using Soviet troops to prevent the council from meeting in the city&#x27;s Sports Hall. Serov co-ordinated the abduction of Pál Maléter and the disruption of peace talks between the Red Army and the Hungarian forces.

==Director of the GRU==
In December 1958, Serov was removed from his post as Chairman of the KGB after hints by Khrushchev, who had said that Western visitors could expect that they &quot;wouldn&#x27;t see so many policemen around the place&quot; and that the Soviet police force would undergo a restructuring. Serov was instead appointed as the Director of the GRU, with the official reason being a need to strengthen the agency&#x27;s leadership. Serov was active in the Cuban Missile Crisis, helping the Soviet leadership with American intelligence. 

==Removal from power==
In February 1963, Serov was dismissed as Director of the GRU when it was discovered that Oleg Penkovsky, a GRU colonel and his protégé, was a double agent spying for the British. The affair was an embarrassment and irreparably damaged his reputation. Khrushchev, feeling he could no longer trust Serov, had him appointed to an unimportant position as assistant to the commander of the Turkestan Military District. A month later, he was demoted to major general. In August, he was transferred to the Volga Military District. In November 1964, Serov wrote a letter to the Politburo expressing his dismay at his treatment in the aftermath of the Penkovsky affair. In April 1965, he was stripped of his party membership and dismissed. Serov spent the rest of his life unsuccessfully seeking rehabilitation in the eyes of the public, restoration of his party membership, and the return of his rank of general and Hero of the Soviet Union to him.

==Death==
Serov died in 1990 at the Central Military Clinical Hospital in Krasnogorsk. He was buried at the cemetery in the village of Ilyinskoye in Krasnogorsky District, Moscow Oblast.

==Awards and decorations==
;Soviet Union

*jubilee medals
;Foreign

Serov&#x27;s award of the Gold&#x27;s Cross of the Virtuti Militari was posthumously deprived in 1995 by the decision of the President of Poland Lech Wałęsa.

==Personality==
In MI5 files about Serov, British agents who had met him called him &quot;something of a ladies&#x27; man,&quot; good mannered, carefully dressed and a moderate drinker. He displayed a considerable familiarity with detective fiction such as Sherlock Holmes. His sense of humour was somewhat heavy, and his jokes were broadly sarcastic and, on occasion, strongly anti-Semitic.

According to the MI5 reports, Serov was &quot;a capable organiser with a cunning mind&quot;.

==Significance==
Serov, although generally considered less significant than Beria in modern literature, helped to bring Stalinism to Europe and to Stalinise the Soviet Union. Serov&#x27;s consolidation of Soviet power in Eastern Europe was helped by his organisation of both the Urząd Bezpieczeństwa (Polish Intelligence Service) in Poland and the Stasi in East Germany.

==Cultural references==
Serov makes a brief appearance at the beginning of Ian Fleming&#x27;s 1957 James Bond novel &quot;From Russia, With Love.&quot; Fleming writes that he &quot;was in every respect a bigger man than Beria&quot; and that &quot;he, with Bulganin and Khrushchev, now ruled Russia. One day, he might even stand on the peak, alone.&quot;

Serov also briefly features in the 1950s novel &quot;Berlin&quot; by the German anti-Nazi writer Theodor Plievier, who lived in the USSR throughout the Hitler years. Plievier says Serov was nicknamed &quot;chramoi&quot; (which he translates as &quot;Old Cripple Foot&quot;, , &#x27;lame&#x27;, &#x27;limping&#x27;), a reference to a supposed deformity (presumably a club foot).

<text>Tristan Alexander Farnon is an American webcomic author, creator of comic strip &quot;Leisure Town&quot;, the &quot;Silent Key&quot; podcast and Spigot. He is one of the founding creators of the Microsoft Comic Chat-based webcomic Jerkcity, now known as &quot;Bonequest&quot;.

==&quot;Leisure Town&quot;==
&quot;Leisure Town&quot; features photographs of bendable toy figures digitally superimposed onto separately photographed backgrounds to create each frame. While the &quot;characters&quot; are children&#x27;s toys, the comics explore mature themes. The strip ran from 1997 to 2003 (although in a reduced format from 2001 to 2003); some limited additional content was published in what appears to have been a one-time event in 2005. The strip is still being published on the Internet, but no new content has been published since 2005.

<text>Carlos Franqui (December 4, 1921 – April 16, 2010) was a Cuban writer, poet, journalist, art critic, and political activist. After the Fulgencio Batista coup in 1952, he became involved with the 26th of July Movement which was headed by Fidel Castro. Upon the success of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, he was placed in charge of the rebellion&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Revolución&quot;, which became an official government publication. When he came to have political differences with the regime, he left Cuba with his family. In 1968 he broke with the Cuban government when he signed a letter condemning the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. He became a vocal critic of the Castro government, writing frequently until his death on April 16, 2010.

==Early years==
Born in a cane field, he entered a vocational school, where he joined the Communist Party of Cuba. He gave up the opportunity to enter the University of Havana to become a professional organizer for the party at the age of 20. After successfully organizing the party in several small towns, he left the organization and became an unaffiliated leftist.

He turned to journalism to make a living and became involved in several literary and artistic movements. He developed friendships with Cuban artists, including writer Guillermo Cabrera Infante and painter Wifredo Lam.

==Role in the Cuban revolution==
After the Fulgencio Batista coup in 1952, he became involved with the 26th of July Movement headed by Fidel Castro. He co-edited the underground newspaper &quot;Revolución&quot; in Havana, taking responsibility for public information. One article in particular reported the landing of the &quot;Granma&quot; and confirmed that Castro was safe in the Sierra Maestra. For this he was jailed and tortured by the police. Upon his release, he went into exile first in Mexico and then in Florida, but was soon drafted by Castro into the Sierra Maestra to continue work on &quot;Revolución&quot; and also on Radio Rebelde, the guerilla movement&#x27;s clandestine radio station.

Upon the success of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, he was placed in charge of &quot;Revolución&quot;, which became an official organ of the government. During his tenure as editor, he maintained a degree of independence from the official line and emphasized the arts and literature, launching the literary supplement &quot;Lunes de Revolución&quot;, which was directed by Guillermo Cabrera Infante and featured high quality work by Cuban and international authors. His position allowed him to travel extensively outside of Cuba. During his European travels, he met artists and intellectuals, including Pablo Picasso, Miró, Calder, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Julio Cortázar. A significant number of these artists traveled to Cuba. One of the most memorable visits was that of Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir.

Franqui had frequent disagreements with the government, which eventually led to his resignation from &quot;Revolución&quot; in 1963. The paper was closed a few months later. After his resignation, Franqui dedicated himself to art projects. In 1967 he organized the Salón de Mayo exhibit in Havana, where many of the world&#x27;s leading artists were represented.

==Exile from Cuba==
He continued to have problems with the Cuban government. He was allowed to leave Cuba with his family–an émigré rather than an exile–and settled in Italy where he worked as an unpaid cultural representative of Cuba. In 1968, he officially broke with the Cuban government when he signed a letter condemning the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. Many Cuban exiles shunned Franqui because of the active role he had played in the Cuban revolution.

Now definitively an exile, his literary production increased. Franqui authored several accounts of the Cuban Revolution, including, &quot;El Libro de los Doce&quot; (The Book about the Twelve) and &quot;Diario de la Revolución Cubana&quot; (The Diary of the Cuban Revolution). He collaborated with Joan Miró, Antoni Tàpies, Alexander Calder, and others on graphic arts publications as well as other works about contemporary art, some of which he edited in Italian under pen names. He wrote several books of poetry as well.

He continued to campaign against repression in Cuba and other countries. He was officially branded a traitor by the Cuban government, which accused him of having ties to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. After breaking relations with Cuba the Cuban government began airbrushing Franqui&#x27;s image from photographs that documented the revolution&#x27;s early years. 

Franqui responded with a poem:
&lt;poem&gt;I discover my photographic death.
Do I exist?
I am a little black,
I am a little white,
I am a little shit,
On Fidel&#x27;s vest.&lt;/poem&gt;

In the early 1990s, he moved to Puerto Rico, where he lived in semi-retirement with his art collection from his years in Cuba and Europe. His artwork collection included works from Pablo Picasso, Joan Miro, Andy Warhol, and Frida Kahlo among others. In 1996, he founded &quot;Carta de Cuba&quot;, a quarterly journal featuring work produced in Cuba by independent journalists and writers. He edited the publication until his death on April 16, 2010, in Puerto Rico.

<text>ASCI Red (also known as ASCI Option Red or TFLOPS) was the first computer built under the Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative (ASCI), the supercomputing initiative of the United States government created to help the maintenance of the United States nuclear arsenal after the 1992 moratorium on nuclear testing.

ASCI Red was built by Intel and installed at Sandia National Laboratories in late 1996. The design was based on the Intel Paragon computer. The original goals to deliver a true teraflop machine by the end of 1996 that would be capable of running an ASCI application using all memory and nodes by September 1997 were met.
It was used by the US government from the years of 1997 to 2005 and was the world&#x27;s fastest supercomputer until late 2000. It was the first ASCI machine that the Department of Energy acquired, and also the first supercomputer to score above one teraflops on the LINPACK benchmark, a test that measures a computer&#x27;s calculation speed. Later upgrades to ASCI Red allowed it to perform above two teraflops.

ASCI Red earned a reputation for reliability that some veterans say has never been beaten. Sandia director Bill Camp said that ASCI Red had the best reliability of any supercomputer ever built, and “was supercomputing’s high-water mark in longevity, price, and performance.”
ASCI Red was decommissioned in 2006.

== System structure ==

The ASCI Red supercomputer was a distributed memory MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data) message-passing computer. The design provided high degrees of scalability for I/O, memory, compute nodes, storage capacity, and communications; standard parallel interfaces also made it possible to port parallel applications to the machine. The machine was structured into four partitions: Compute, Service, I/O, and System. Parallel applications executed in the Compute Partition which contained nodes optimized for floating point performance. The compute nodes had only the features required for efficient computation – they were not purposed for general interactive services. The Service Partition provided an integrated, scalable host that supported interactive users (log-in sessions), application development, and system administration. The I/O Partition supported disk I/O, a scalable parallel file system and network services. The System Partition supported initial booting and system Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability (RAS) capabilities.

The Service partition helps integrate all of the different parts of ASCI Red together. It provides a scalable host for users, and it is used for general system administration. The I/O Partition provides a file system and network services, and the Service partition is made up of the log-in screens, tools for application development, and utilities for network connections. The Compute partition contains nodes that are designed for floating point performance. This is where the actual computing takes place. Every one of the compute nodes accommodated two 200 MHz Pentium Pro processors, each with a 16 KB level-1 cache and a 256 KB level-2 cache, which were upgraded later to two 333 MHz Pentium II OverDrive processors, each with a 32 KB level-1 cache and a 512 KB level-2 cache. According to Intel, the ASCI Red Computer is also the first large scale supercomputer to be built entirely of common commercially available components.

All of ASCI Red&#x27;s partitions are interconnected to form one supercomputer, however at the same time none of the nodes support global shared memory. Each of the nodes works in its own memory, and each shares data with the others through &quot;explicit message-passing&quot;.

== Technical specifications ==

The computer itself took up almost of space, and was made up of 104 &quot;cabinets&quot;. Of those cabinets, 76 are computers (processors), 8 are switches, and 20 are disks. It had a total of 1212 GB of RAM, and 9298 separate processors.
The original machine used Intel Pentium Pro processors each clocked at 200 MHz. These were later upgraded to specially packaged Pentium II Xeon processors, each clocked at 333 MHz. Overall, it required 850 kW of power (not including air conditioning). What sets ASCI Option Red aside from all of its predecessors in supercomputing is its high I/O bandwidth. Previous supercomputers had multi-GFLOPS performance, yet their slow I/O speeds would slow down, or bottleneck the systems. Intel&#x27;s TFLOPS PFS is an extremely efficient &quot;Parallel File System&quot; that can sustain transfer speeds of up to 1 GB/s, eliminating bottlenecks.

== First to TFLOPS ==

In December, 1996, three quarters of ASCI Red was measured at a world record 1.06 TFLOPS on MP LINPACK and held the record for fastest supercomputer in the world for several consecutive years, maxing out at 2.38 TFLOPS after a processor and memory upgrade in 1999.
The system used Pentium Pro processors when initially constructed and when it recorded performance above one TFLOPS. In that configuration, when fully built it recorded 1.6 TFLOPS of performance. Upgrades later in 1999, to specially packaged Pentium II Xeon processors, pushed performance to 3.1 TFLOPS.

== Operating system ==

The different partitions of ASCI Red run on different operating systems. For example, users of the computer work in an environment called &quot;Teraflops OS&quot;, an operating system (once called Paragon OS) that was originally developed for the Intel Paragon XP/S Supercomputer. ASCI Red&#x27;s Compute partition runs on an operating system named Cougar. Cougar is a Sandia Labs and University of New Mexico collaboration; it is a lightweight OS based on PUMA and SUNMOS, two systems that were also designed for use on the Paragon supercomputer. It consists of a light weight kernel, the Process Control Thread, and other utilities and libraries. The Linux 2.4 kernel was ported to the system and a custom CNIC driver was written, but the heavy weight OS did not perform as well as the Cougar lightweight kernel on many benchmarks.

<doc id="1023575" wikidata="Q282142" url="?curid=1023575" title="Glioblastoma">
<text>Glioblastoma, previously known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is the most aggressive and most common type of cancer that originates in the brain, and has a very poor prognosis for survival. Initial signs and symptoms of glioblastoma are nonspecific. They may include headaches, personality changes, nausea, and symptoms similar to those of a stroke. Symptoms often worsen rapidly and may progress to unconsciousness.
The cause of most cases of glioblastoma is not known. Uncommon risk factors include genetic disorders, such as neurofibromatosis and Li–Fraumeni syndrome, and previous radiation therapy. Glioblastomas represent 15% of all brain tumors. They are thought to arise from astrocytes. The diagnosis typically is made by a combination of a CT scan, MRI scan, and tissue biopsy.
There is no known method of preventing the cancer. Treatment usually involves surgery, after which chemotherapy and radiation therapy are used. The medication temozolomide is frequently used as part of chemotherapy. High-dose steroids may be used to help reduce swelling and decrease symptoms. Surgical removal (decompression) of the tumor is linked to increased survival, but only by some months.
Despite maximum treatment, the cancer almost always recurs. The typical duration of survival following diagnosis is 10–13 months, with fewer than 5–10% of people surviving longer than five years. Without treatment, survival is typically three months. It is the most common cancer that begins within the brain and the second-most common brain tumor, after meningioma, which is benign in most cases. About 3 in 100,000 people develop the disease per year. The average age at diagnosis is 64, and the disease occurs more commonly in males than females.

Tumors of the central nervous system are the 10th leading cause of death worldwide, with up to 90% being brain tumors. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is derived from astrocytes and accounts for 49% of all malignant central nervous system tumors, making it the most common form of central nervous system cancer. Despite countless efforts to develop new therapies for GBM over the years, the median survival rate of GBM patients worldwide is 8 months; radiation and chemotherapy standard-of-care treatment beginning shortly after diagnosis improve the median survival length to around 14 months and a five-year survival rate of 5–10%. The five-year survival rate for individuals with any form of primary malignant brain tumor is 20%. Even when all detectable traces of the tumor are removed through surgery, most patients with GBM experience recurrence of their cancer.
==Signs and symptoms==
Common symptoms include seizures, headaches, nausea and vomiting, memory loss, changes to personality, mood or concentration, and localized neurological problems. The kinds of symptoms produced depend more on the location of the tumor than on its pathological properties. The tumor can start producing symptoms quickly, but occasionally is an asymptomatic condition until it reaches an enormous size.

==Risk factors==
The cause of most cases is unclear. The best known risk factor is exposure to ionizing radiation, and CT scan radiation is an important cause. About 5% develop from certain hereditary syndromes.

===Genetics===
Uncommon risk factors include genetic disorders such as neurofibromatosis, Li–Fraumeni syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, or Turcot syndrome. Previous radiation therapy is also a risk. For unknown reasons, it occurs more commonly in males.

===Environmental===
Other associations include exposure to smoking, pesticides, and working in petroleum refining or rubber manufacturing.

Glioblastoma has been associated with the viruses SV40, HHV-6, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Infection with an oncogenic CMV may even be necessary for the development of glioblastoma.

===Other===
Research has been done to see if consumption of cured meat is a risk factor. No risk had been confirmed as of 2003. Similarly, exposure to formaldehyde, and residential electromagnetic fields, such as from cell phones and electrical wiring within homes, have been studied as risk factors. As of 2015, they had not been shown to cause GBM.

==Pathogenesis==

The cellular origin of glioblastoma is unknown. Because of the similarities in immunostaining of glial cells and glioblastoma, gliomas such as glioblastoma have long been assumed to originate from glial-type stem cells found in the subventricular zone. More recent studies suggest that astrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, and neural stem cells could all serve as the cell of origin.

GBMs usually form in the cerebral white matter, grow quickly, and can become very large before producing symptoms. Since the function of glial cells in the brain is to support neurons, they have the ability to divide, to enlarge, and to extend cellular projections along neurons and blood vessels. Once cancerous, these cells are predisposed to spread along existing paths in the brain, typically along white-matter tracts, blood vessels and the perivascular space. The tumor may extend into the meninges or ventricular wall, leading to high protein content in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (&gt; 100 mg/dl), as well as an occasional pleocytosis of 10 to 100 cells, mostly lymphocytes. Malignant cells carried in the CSF may spread (rarely) to the spinal cord or cause meningeal gliomatosis. However, metastasis of GBM beyond the central nervous system is extremely unusual. About 50% of GBMs occupy more than one lobe of a hemisphere or are bilateral. Tumors of this type usually arise from the cerebrum and may exhibit the classic infiltration across the corpus callosum, producing a butterfly (bilateral) glioma.

=== Glioblastoma classification ===
Brain tumor classification has been traditionally based on histopathology at macroscopic level, measured in hematoxylin-eosin sections. The World Health Organization published the first standard classification in 1979 and has been doing so since. The 2007 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System was the last classification mainly based on microscopy features. The new 2016 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System was a paradigm shift: some of the tumors were defined also by their genetic composition as well as their cell morphology.

In 2021, the fifth edition of the WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System was released. This update eliminated the classification of secondary glioblastoma and reclassified those tumors as Astrocytoma, IDH mutant, grade 4. Only tumors that are IDH wild type are now classified as glioblastoma.
=== Molecular alterations ===
There are currently three molecular subtypes of glioblastoma that were identified based on gene expression:
* Classical: Around 97% of tumors in this subtype carry extra copies of the epidermal growth factor receptor (&quot;EGFR&quot;) gene, and most have higher than normal expression of &quot;EGFR&quot;, whereas the gene&quot; TP53&quot; (p53), which is often mutated in glioblastoma, is rarely mutated in this subtype. Loss of heterozygosity in chromosome 10 is also frequently seen in the classical subtype alongside chromosome 7 amplification.
* The proneural subtype often has high rates of alterations in &quot;TP53&quot; (p53), and in &quot;PDGFRA&quot; the gene encoding a-type platelet-derived growth factor receptor.
* The mesenchymal subtype is characterized by high rates of mutations or other alterations in &quot;NF1&quot;, the gene encoding neurofibromin 1 and fewer alterations in the &quot;EGFR&quot; gene and less expression of &quot;EGFR&quot; than other types.

Initial analyses of gene expression had revealed a fourth neural subtype. However, further analyses revealed that this subtype is non-tumor specific and is potential contamination caused by the normal cells.

Many other genetic alterations have been described in glioblastoma, and the majority of them are clustered in two pathways, the RB and the PI3K/AKT. 68–78% and 88% of Glioblastomas have alterations in these pathways, respectively.

Another important alteration is methylation of MGMT, a &quot;suicide&quot; DNA repair enzyme. Methylation impairs DNA transcription and expression of the MGMT gene. Since the MGMT enzyme can repair only one DNA alkylation due to its suicide repair mechanism, reserve capacity is low and methylation of the MGMT gene promoter greatly affects DNA-repair capacity. MGMT methylation is associated with an improved response to treatment with DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics, such as temozolomide.

Studies using genome-wide profiling have revealed glioblastomas to have a remarkable genetic variety.

At least three distinct paths in the development of Glioblastomas have been identified with the aid of molecular investigations.

* The first pathway involves the amplification and mutational activation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) genes, leading to the dysregulation of growth factor signaling. Epithelial growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) are all recognized by transmembrane proteins called RTKs. Additionally, they can function as receptors for hormones, cytokines, and other signaling pathways.
* The second method involves activating the intracellular signaling system known as phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR, which is crucial for controlling cell survival.
* The third pathway is defined by p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor pathway inactivation.

===Cancer stem cells===
Glioblastoma cells with properties similar to progenitor cells (glioblastoma cancer stem cells) have been found in glioblastomas. Their presence, coupled with the glioblastoma&#x27;s diffuse nature results in difficulty in removing them completely by surgery, and is therefore believed to be the possible cause behind resistance to conventional treatments, and the high recurrence rate. Glioblastoma cancer stem cells share some resemblance with neural progenitor cells, both expressing the surface receptor CD133. CD44 can also be used as a cancer stem cell marker in a subset of glioblastoma tumour cells. Glioblastoma cancer stem cells appear to exhibit enhanced resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy mediated, at least in part, by up-regulation of the DNA damage response.

===Metabolism===
The &quot;IDH1&quot; gene encodes for the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and is not mutated in glioblastoma. As such, these tumors behave more aggressively compared to IDH1-mutated astrocytomas.

===Ion channels===
Furthermore, GBM exhibits numerous alterations in genes that encode for ion channels, including upregulation of gBK potassium channels and ClC-3 chloride channels. By upregulating these ion channels, glioblastoma tumor cells are hypothesized to facilitate increased ion movement over the cell membrane, thereby increasing H2O movement through osmosis, which aids glioblastoma cells in changing cellular volume very rapidly. This is helpful in their extremely aggressive invasive behavior because quick adaptations in cellular volume can facilitate movement through the sinuous extracellular matrix of the brain.

=== MicroRNA ===
As of 2012, RNA interference, usually microRNA, was under investigation in tissue culture, pathology specimens, and preclinical animal models of glioblastoma. Additionally, experimental observations suggest that microRNA-451 is a key regulator of LKB1/AMPK signaling in cultured glioma cells and that miRNA clustering controls epigenetic pathways in the disease.

=== Tumor vasculature ===
GBM is characterized by abnormal vessels that present disrupted morphology and functionality. The high permeability and poor perfusion of the vasculature result in a disorganized blood flow within the tumor and can lead to increased hypoxia, which in turn facilitates cancer progression by promoting processes such as immunosuppression.

==Diagnosis==

When viewed with MRI, glioblastomas often appear as ring-enhancing lesions. The appearance is not specific, however, as other lesions such as abscess, metastasis, tumefactive multiple sclerosis, and other entities may have a similar appearance. Definitive diagnosis of a suspected GBM on CT or MRI requires a stereotactic biopsy or a craniotomy with tumor resection and pathologic confirmation. Because the tumor grade is based upon the most malignant portion of the tumor, biopsy or subtotal tumor resection can result in undergrading of the lesion. Imaging of tumor blood flow using perfusion MRI and measuring tumor metabolite concentration with MR spectroscopy may add diagnostic value to standard MRI in select cases by showing increased relative cerebral blood volume and increased choline peak, respectively, but pathology remains the gold standard for diagnosis and molecular characterization.

Distinguishing glioblastoma from high-grade astrocytoma is important. These tumors occur spontaneously (&quot;de novo&quot;) and have not progressed from a lower-grade glioma, as in high-grade astrocytomas Glioblastomas have a worse prognosis and different tumor biology, and may have a different response to therapy, which makes this a critical evaluation to determine patient prognosis and therapy. Astrocytomas carry a mutation in &quot;IDH1&quot; or &quot;IDH2&quot;, whereas this mutation is not present in glioblastoma. Thus, &quot;IDH1&quot; and &quot;IDH2&quot; mutations are a useful tool to distinguish glioblastomas from astrocytomas, since histopathologically they are similar and the distinction without molecular biomarkers is unreliable. IDH-wildtype glioblastomas usually have lower &quot;OLIG2&quot; expression compared with IDH-mutant lower grade astrocytomas. In patients aged over 55 years with a histologically typical glioblastoma, without a pre-existing lower grade glioma, with a non-midline tumor location and with retained nuclear ATRX expression, immunohistochemical negativity for IDH1 R132H suffices for the classification as IDH-wild-type glioblastoma. In all other instances of diffuse gliomas, a lack of IDH1 R132H immunopositivity should be followed by IDH1 and IDH2 DNA sequencing to detect or exclude the presence of non-canonical mutations. IDH-wild-type diffuse astrocytic gliomas without microvascular proliferation or necrosis should be tested for EGFR amplification, TERT promoter mutation and a +7/–10 cytogenetic signature as molecular characteristics of IDH-wild-type glioblastomas.

==Prevention==
There are no known methods to prevent glioblastoma. It is the case for most gliomas, unlike for some other forms of cancer, that they happen without previous warning and there are no known ways to prevent them.

==Treatment==

Treating glioblastoma is difficult due to several complicating factors:
* The tumor cells are resistant to conventional therapies.
* The brain is susceptible to damage from conventional therapy.
* The brain has a limited capacity to repair itself.
* Many drugs cannot cross the blood–brain barrier to act on the tumor.

Treatment of primary brain tumors consists of palliative (symptomatic) care and therapies intended to improve survival.

===Symptomatic therapy===
Supportive treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and improving the patient&#x27;s neurologic function. The primary supportive agents are anticonvulsants and corticosteroids.
* Historically, around 90% of patients with glioblastoma underwent anticonvulsant treatment, although only an estimated 40% of patients required this treatment. Neurosurgeons have recommended that anticonvulsants not be administered prophylactically, and should wait until a seizure occurs before prescribing this medication. Those receiving phenytoin concurrent with radiation may have serious skin reactions such as erythema multiforme and Stevens–Johnson syndrome.
* Corticosteroids, usually dexamethasone, can reduce peritumoral edema (through rearrangement of the blood–brain barrier), diminishing mass effect and lowering intracranial pressure, with a decrease in headache or drowsiness.

===Surgery===

Surgery is the first stage of treatment of glioblastoma. An average GBM tumor contains 1011 cells, which is on average reduced to 109 cells after surgery (a reduction of 99%). Benefits of surgery include resection for a pathological diagnosis, alleviation of symptoms related to mass effect, and potentially removing disease before secondary resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy occurs.

The greater the extent of tumor removal, the better. In retrospective analyses, removal of 98% or more of the tumor has been associated with a significantly longer healthier time than if less than 98% of the tumor is removed. The chances of near-complete initial removal of the tumor may be increased if the surgery is guided by a fluorescent dye known as 5-aminolevulinic acid. GBM cells are widely infiltrative through the brain at diagnosis, and despite a &quot;total resection&quot; of all obvious tumor, most people with GBM later develop recurrent tumors either near the original site or at more distant locations within the brain. Other modalities, typically radiation and chemotherapy, are used after surgery in an effort to suppress and slow recurrent disease through damaging the DNA of rapidly proliferative GBM cells.

Between 60-85% of glioblastoma patients report cancer-related cognitive impairments following surgery, which refers to problems with executive functioning, verbal fluency, attention, and speed of processing. These symptoms may be managed with cognitive behavioral therapy, physical exercise, yoga and meditation.

===Radiotherapy===

Subsequent to surgery, radiotherapy becomes the mainstay of treatment for people with glioblastoma. It is typically performed along with giving temozolomide. A pivotal clinical trial carried out in the early 1970s showed that among 303 GBM patients randomized to radiation or best medical therapy, those who received radiation had a median survival more than double those who did not. Subsequent clinical research has attempted to build on the backbone of surgery followed by radiation. Whole-brain radiotherapy does not improve when compared to the more precise and targeted three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. A total radiation dose of 60–65 Gy has been found to be optimal for treatment.

GBM tumors are well known to contain zones of tissue exhibiting hypoxia, which are highly resistant to radiotherapy. Various approaches to chemotherapy radiosensitizers have been pursued, with limited success . , newer research approaches included preclinical and clinical investigations into the use of an oxygen diffusion-enhancing compound such as trans sodium crocetinate as radiosensitizers, and a clinical trial was underway. Boron neutron capture therapy has been tested as an alternative treatment for glioblastoma, but is not in common use.

===Chemotherapy===
Most studies show no benefit from the addition of chemotherapy. However, a large clinical trial of 575 participants randomized to standard radiation versus radiation plus temozolomide chemotherapy showed that the group receiving temozolomide survived a median of 14.6 months as opposed to 12.1 months for the group receiving radiation alone. This treatment regimen is now standard for most cases of glioblastoma where the person is not enrolled in a clinical trial. Temozolomide seems to work by sensitizing the tumor cells to radiation, and appears more effective for tumors with &quot;MGMT&quot; promoter methylation. High doses of temozolomide in high-grade gliomas yield low toxicity, but the results are comparable to the standard doses. Antiangiogenic therapy with medications such as bevacizumab control symptoms, but do not appear to affect overall survival in those with glioblastoma. A 2018 systematic review found that the overall benefit of anti-angiogenic therapies was unclear. In elderly people with newly diagnosed glioblastoma who are reasonably fit, concurrent and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy gives the best overall survival but is associated with a greater risk of haematological adverse events than radiotherapy alone.

===Immunotherapy===
Phase 3 clinical trials of immunotherapy treatments for glioblastoma have largely failed.

===Other procedures===
Alternating electric field therapy is an FDA-approved therapy for newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma. In 2015, initial results from a phase-III randomized clinical trial of alternating electric field therapy plus temozolomide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma reported a three-month improvement in progression-free survival, and a five-month improvement in overall survival compared to temozolomide therapy alone, representing the first large trial in a decade to show a survival improvement in this setting. Despite these results, the efficacy of this approach remains controversial among medical experts. However, increasing understanding of the mechanistic basis through which alternating electric field therapy exerts anti-cancer effects and results from ongoing phase-III clinical trials in extracranial cancers may help facilitate increased clinical acceptance to treat glioblastoma in the future.

Often for those who hear about the diagnosis Glioblastoma they go to a dark place right away as the disease is unfortunately terminal. It is overlooked how despite the terminal outcome there are still treatments to help improve activities of daily living. Despite this, it has been shown that with exercise and physical rehabilitation, this can greatly improve the quality of life for an individual with glioblastoma. 

==Prognosis==
The most common length of survival following diagnosis is 10 to 13 months (although recent research points to a median survival rate of 15 months), with fewer than 1–3% of people surviving longer than five years. In the United States between 2012 and 2016 five-year survival was 6.8%. Without treatment, survival is typically three months. Complete cures are extremely rare, but have been reported.

Increasing age (&gt; 60 years) carries a worse prognostic risk. Death is usually due to widespread tumor infiltration with cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure.

A good initial Karnofsky performance score (KPS) and MGMT methylation are associated with longer survival. A DNA test can be conducted on glioblastomas to determine whether or not the promoter of the &quot;MGMT&quot; gene is methylated. Patients with a methylated MGMT promoter have longer survival than those with an unmethylated MGMT promoter, due in part to increased sensitivity to temozolomide.

Long-term benefits have also been associated with those patients who receive surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy. However, much remains unknown about why some patients survive longer with glioblastoma. Age under 50 is linked to longer survival in GBM, as is 98%+ resection and use of temozolomide chemotherapy and better KPSs. A recent study confirms that younger age is associated with a much better prognosis, with a small fraction of patients under 40 years of age achieving a population-based cure. Cure is thought to occur when a person&#x27;s risk of death returns to that of the normal population, and in GBM, this is thought to occur after 10 years.

UCLA Neuro-oncology publishes real-time survival data for patients with this diagnosis.

According to a 2003 study, GBM prognosis can be divided into three subgroups dependent on KPS, the age of the patient, and treatment.

==Epidemiology==
About three per 100,000 people develop the disease a year, although regional frequency may be much higher. The frequency in England doubled between 1995 and 2015.

It is the second-most common central nervous system tumor after meningioma. It occurs more commonly in males than females. Although the median age at diagnosis is 64, in 2014, the broad category of brain cancers was second only to leukemia in people in the United States under 20 years of age.

==History==
The term &quot;glioblastoma multiforme&quot; was introduced in 1926 by Percival Bailey and Harvey Cushing, based on the idea that the tumor originates from primitive precursors of glial cells (glioblasts), and the highly variable appearance due to the presence of necrosis, hemorrhage, and cysts (multiform).

==Research==

===Gene therapy===
Gene therapy has been explored as a method to treat glioblastoma, and while animal models and early-phase clinical trials have been successful, as of 2017, all gene-therapy drugs that had been tested in phase-III clinical trials for glioblastoma had failed. Scientists have developed the core–shell nanostructured LPLNP-PPT (long persistent luminescence nanoparticles. PPT refers to polyetherimide, PEG and trans-activator of transcription, and TRAIL is the human tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-induced ligand) for effective gene delivery and tracking, with positive results. This is a TRAIL ligand that has been encoded to induce apoptosis of cancer cells, more specifically glioblastomas. Although this study was still in clinical trials in 2017, it has shown diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities, and will open great interest for clinical applications in stem-cell-based therapy.

Other gene therapy approaches have also been explored in the context of glioblastoma, including suicide gene therapy. Suicide gene therapy is a two-step approach that includes the delivery of a foreign enzyme-gene to the cancer cells followed by activation with a pro-drug causing toxicities in the cancer-cells, which induces cell death. This approach has succeeded in animal models and small clinical studies but has not shown survival benefit in larger clinical studies. Using new, more efficient delivery vectors and suicide gene-prodrug systems could improve the clinical benefit from these types of therapies.

===Oncolytic virotherapy===
Oncolytic virotherapy is an emerging novel treatment that is under investigation both at preclinical and clinical stages. Several viruses including herpes simplex virus, adenovirus, poliovirus, and reovirus are currently being tested in phases I and II of clinical trials for glioblastoma therapy and have shown to improve overall survival.

===Intranasal drug delivery===
Direct nose-to-brain drug delivery is being explored as a means to achieve higher, and hopefully more effective, drug concentrations in the brain. A clinical phase-I/II study with glioblastoma patients in Brazil investigated the natural compound perillyl alcohol for intranasal delivery as an aerosol. The results were encouraging and, as of 2016, a similar trial has been initiated in the United States.

<text>Daniel Negreanu (; born July 26, 1974) is a Canadian professional poker player who has won seven World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelets and two World Poker Tour (WPT) championship titles. In 2014, independent poker ranking service Global Poker Index recognized Negreanu as the best poker player of the previous decade.

As of 2024, he is the seventh-biggest live tournament poker winner of all time. He was named the WSOP Player of the Year in 2004 and 2013, making him the only player to receive the accolade more than once. He was also the 2004–2005 WPT Player of the Year. He is the first player to make a final table at each of the three WSOP bracelet-awarding locations (Las Vegas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific), and the first to win a bracelet at each. In 2014, he was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Negreanu was born in Toronto, Ontario, in 1974, seven years after his parents, Annie and Constantin, emigrated from Romania. He can speak Romanian fluently. The Negreanus had hoped to start a new life in the United States but ended up settling in Toronto where Constantin worked as an electrician and sold confectionery. Daniel is five years younger than his brother Mike. At an early age, Negreanu was ambitious, stating in a 2009 interview &quot;From the age of four, I thought I&#x27;d be rich. I told my mom I&#x27;d build a house out of Popsicle sticks and move to California.&quot;

He attended Pineway Public School in North York, where the principal complained to his mother about Daniel&#x27;s &quot;poor manners or behavior&quot; and threatened to expel him for &quot;ignoring the school rules.&quot; While nursing dreams of a career as a professional snooker player, the then 15-year-old learned to play poker. At the age of 16, he was spending time in pool halls, hustling, betting on sports, and playing cards.

When he was several credits short of graduation, he dropped out of high school and began his life as a rounder playing at local charity casinos, usually at Casino Country and Fundtime Games and looking for illegal games around the city. While in Toronto, he met and began dating Evelyn Ng, who would also become a well-known professional poker player. After building a bankroll, he left for Las Vegas at the age of 22 to pursue his dream of becoming a professional poker player. However, &quot;The Strip&quot; got the better of him and he was forced to move back home to Toronto to rebuild his bankroll.

==Poker career==
Negreanu is an accomplished tournament and cash game player. He has seven World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelets and two World Poker Tour (WPT) championships. He has also reached multiple WSOP and WPT final tables and won various other tournament titles. Negreanu was named the 2004 &quot;Card Player&quot; Player of the Year and the WSOP Player of the Year. He was also named the 2004-05 WPT Player of the Year. In 2006, Negreanu was named &quot;Favorite Poker Player&quot; at &quot;Card Player&quot; Magazine&#x27;s Player of the Year Awards Gala. In 2013, he captured two WSOP bracelets and another WSOP Player of the Year award, becoming the only player to win the award twice. In November 2014, Negreanu was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in Las Vegas.

Negreanu has regularly played the &quot;Big Game&quot; in Bobby&#x27;s Room, in the Bellagio casino, Las Vegas, where the limits are $400–$800 or greater and the games are mixed. He is a self-professed action junkie who claims to always seek new challenges and set high goals for himself. Unlike many players, he is outspoken about his results and regularly posts updates in the Full Contact Poker forums. Some of Negreanu&#x27;s success is attributed to his ability to read opponents. When asked about this, Negreanu explained that the most important skill he employs is observing what hands his opponents play and how capable they are of playing them.

====World Series of Poker====
Negreanu&#x27;s first cash at the WSOP was also his first WSOP bracelet. Negreanu won $169,460 in the $2,000 Pot Limit Hold&#x27;em event in the 1998 World Series of Poker, becoming the youngest WSOP bracelet winner in history — a record he held until 2004 (Scott Fischman). Negreanu has since captured another six bracelets, including the $50,000 Poker Players Championship in 2024. He has 36 career WSOP final table appearances, including two apiece at the WSOP Europe and at the WSOP Asia-Pacific, and 103 money finishes.

In addition to his 7 bracelets, he also won a WSOP Circuit ring in 2006. After winning the tournament, he explained his strategy and provided some insights into his play: &quot;I had a strategy designed for each individual player and pretty much followed it at the final table. The key to winning for me is that I stayed out of marginal situations. I don&#x27;t want to get into a race with 6-6 against A-K and hope to stay alive. I think what I am best at is playing after the flop, and I wanted to get as many situations as I could where I was up against (an opponent) and could take them on after the flop. My goal is to see the most flops I can. I like to set traps. I let (opponents) get involved, and then trap them. If I get them drawing dead (which happened twice at the final table in big pots) - that&#x27;s always the plan.&quot;

====Other notable tournaments====
Negreanu&#x27;s first major successes on the tournament poker scene came in 1997 with three tournament wins, including two events at the World Poker Finals at Foxwoods Resort Casino, earning $55,064.

In November 2008, Negreanu won the fourth-annual British Columbia Poker Championships main event, topping a field of 690 players (a personal high for Daniel), and earning $371,910 CAD (US$299,951).

In 2014, he was the runner-up in The Big One for One Drop which paid him $8,288,001. The runner-up finish marked the highest live cash for Negreanu. The event was held at the WSOP but was not eligible for a WSOP bracelet.

Negreanu won $1 million as the winner of the 2016 Shark Cage tournament organized by PokerStars.net.

As of 2024, his total live tournament winnings exceed $52,400,000. His 252 cashes at the WSOP account for over $22,100,000 of those winnings.

In October 2022, he won $3,312,000 in the $300,000 buy-in Super High Roller Bowl VII.

====Cash games====
In addition to Negreanu&#x27;s regular appearances in the big game at Bobby&#x27;s Room, he played in all seven seasons of the television show &quot;High Stakes Poker&quot;. He also played in two seasons of &quot;PokerStars Big Game&quot;.

===Online poker and sponsorship===
In December 2005, Negreanu became the professional spokesperson for an online poker site called Poker Mountain. He played at this cardroom under the screen name &quot;KidPoker&quot;. In June 2005 he announced his decision to terminate that relationship due to software issues that were problematic enough to cause a shutdown of the site. In 2006, he used Full Contact Poker to launch a competition to select a protégé, whom Daniel would attempt to mold into a world-class live tournament poker player. He agreed to pay the protégé&#x27;s entry fee into four $10,000 buy-in events. Daniel&#x27;s first protégé was Brian Fidler. In 2007, Daniel ran a second protégé promotion, which was won by Anthony Mak.

In June 2007, Negreanu signed with PokerStars, joining Chris Moneymaker and many other professional poker players as a member of Team PokerStars. His Full Contact Poker site has since returned to being a forum and informational site. After &quot;Black Friday&quot; (the 2011 US government crackdown on online poker), Negreanu moved back to Canada in order to continue playing online poker on PokerStars. On May 23, 2019, after nearly 12 years as a member of Team PokerStars, Negreanu announced he and PokerStars were parting ways.

Negreanu is a brand ambassador and spokesperson for GGPoker since 2019.

===Heads-up challenge===
On July 29, 2020, after a years-long feud with fellow poker pro Doug Polk, Negreanu publicly accepted a challenge to a high-stakes grudge match. They played 25,000 hands of No-Limit Texas Hold&#x27;em at $200/$400 stakes. The duel ended on 4 February 2021 with Polk winning approximately $1,200,000 over 25,000 hands.

===High Stakes Duel===
In 2021, Daniel Negreanu challenged Phil Hellmuth to a heads-up match after Phil Hellmuth was critical of Daniel&#x27;s plays in his heads-up match against Doug Polk. The two played three rounds in High Stakes Duel 2, which aired on PokerGO, with the buy-in doubling from the initial $50,000 to $200,000 by the third round. Phil Hellmuth beat Negreanu in all three rounds, winning a total of $350,000. As per the rules, he was allowed to cash out his winnings after winning three rounds, although Negreanu wanted to continue playing.

In 2023, it was announced that Negreanu would take on Eric Persson in High Stakes Duel 4 in May. Negreanu defeated Persson in Round 1 to win the $100,000 prize pool. Round 2 was scheduled for August, with Negreanu facing Doug Polk. Negreanu defeated Polk and took home the championship belt and $200,000.

===Poker Masters===
In September 2021, Daniel Negreanu had some success in PokerGo&#x27;s Poker Masters tournaments. He placed 3rd in Poker Masters 2, a $10,000 buy-in event, and won $103,200. He placed 1st in Poker Masters 5, another $10,000 buy-in event, winning $178,200. In the tenth event, a $25,000 buy-in tournament, he placed 3rd for $152,000.

===Other poker activities===
Upon opening, the Wynn Las Vegas resort recruited him as their &quot;Poker Ambassador&quot; to play for any stake in their poker room. The arrangement lasted until October 2005, when he opted out because it was restricting his ability to play for high stakes outside the Wynn.

Negreanu has played poker on various TV shows such as &quot;Late Night Poker&quot;, &quot;Poker After Dark&quot;, and &quot;High Stakes Poker&quot;, as well as serving as a commentator and stand-in host on &quot;Ultimate Poker Challenge&quot;. He also appeared in the third season of &quot;Poker Superstars Invitational Tournament&quot;. In January 2007, Negreanu appeared in the Fox Reality original series &quot;Rob and Amber: Against the Odds&quot;, in which he mentored reality television personality Rob Mariano in his bid to become a professional poker player.

In May 2008, Negreanu&#x27;s book &quot;Power Hold&#x27;em Strategy&quot; was released. The book resembles the Doyle Brunson book &quot;Super/System&quot; in that it has contributions from several other poker players, including Evelyn Ng, Erick Lindgren, Paul Wasicka, Todd Brunson, and David Williams. Negreanu&#x27;s section presents and explains the strategy of small ball poker. Negreanu is also featured in the 2006 poker video game &quot;Stacked with Daniel Negreanu&quot;, providing tips and hints as to how to play effectively. He has written over 100 articles for &quot;CardPlayer Magazine&quot; and contributed to Doyle Brunson&#x27;s revised book, &quot;Super System II&quot;. He has tutored on the web as part of Poker School Online and also personally given lessons to celebrities such as Tobey Maguire and Shannon Elizabeth. In addition to his poker books, Negreanu has created a 38-section Master Class teaching poker theory and play through video.

==Other ventures==
Negreanu made a cameo appearance as a poker player playing against the mutant Gambit in the film &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;. He also played a poker player in &quot;The Grand&quot;, and he appeared as himself in the film &quot;Lucky You&quot;. On season two of &quot;Sports Science&quot;, he tried to fool a lie detector. He also appeared in Katy Perry&#x27;s music video for &quot;Waking Up in Vegas&quot; as a poker player. In 2013, he appeared on an episode of the CBC Television program &quot;Mr. D&quot;, again playing himself. He also appeared in a TV series dedicated to poker called &quot;Tilt&quot; in 2005. Daniel was a major advocate of the move to bring the National Hockey League to Las Vegas, along with Malaysian billionaire and fellow poker player Richard Yong.

Negreanu is also a fan of &quot;Hearthstone&quot;. After picking up the game in 2015, he began streaming it alongside poker on Twitch and was invited to a showmatch during the &quot;Hearthstone&quot; World Championship at BlizzCon 2015 in Anaheim, California, against former &quot;StarCraft: Brood War&quot; pro and fellow WSOP and WPT champion Bertrand &quot;ElkY&quot; Grospellier, which he won 3–1.

In September 2015, Negreanu posed for a PETA vegan campaign. In January 2021 Chess.com announced that he would play in the third edition of the PogChamps chess tournament. In 2018, Negreanu was promoted and credited as an associate producer for a documentary about veganism in sports, &quot;The Game Changers&quot;.

==Personal life==
In August 2005, Negreanu married Lori Lin Weber. They separated in November 2007 and later divorced. In May 2019, he married Amanda Leatherman. In 2024, Negreanu and his wife Amanda, started their own Podcast called &quot;The Mania Podcast&quot;.

Negreanu has a blog at Full Contact Poker where he posts his thoughts and feelings about life, politics and poker. He became a vegetarian in 2000 and has been vegan since 2006, claiming it makes him a better player. After many years living in the United States, he received his green card on July 15, 2009.

On October 1, 2020, Negreanu was one of 12 individuals named in a $330 million defamation lawsuit brought by poker professional Mike Postle. Others named in the suit include Phil Galfond, ESPN and Negreanu&#x27;s heads-up challenge opponent Doug Polk. In April 2021, the lawsuit was dropped.

<text>Brian O&#x27;Dea (born September 1, 1948) is a Canadian businessman, author, television personality, and former drug smuggler. He is best-known for a large marijuana smuggling enterprise he masterminded in the mid-1980s. Set up to move marijuana in bulk from Southeast Asia to the Pacific Northwest and California, between 1986 and 1988, O&#x27;Dea&#x27;s organization successfully smuggled 76 tons of marijuana worth about $300 million into Washington, transported it to California, and distributed it throughout the United States.

After suffering a cocaine-induced heart attack in 1988, O&#x27;Dea quit smuggling and using illegal drugs and became a substance abuse counselor. A long U.S. federal investigation of his marijuana smuggling operation resulted in O&#x27;Dea&#x27;s arrest in 1990. 

O&#x27;Dea pleaded guilty in 1991 and received a ten year sentence. After beginning his prison term in California, in 1992 he was transferred to a prison in Canada. Released on parole in 1993, O&#x27;Dea later built a career as a television commentator, narrator, and producer, in addition to authoring a memoir.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Dea was born in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland on 1 September 1948, one of five children born to John R. O&#x27;Dea and Madeleine &quot;Maddy&quot; Connolly. His family was prominent in Newfoundland business and politics; his uncle Fabian O&#x27;Dea served as lieutenant governor of Newfoundland in the 1960s. O&#x27;Dea&#x27;s father was president of Newfoundland Brewery and founded Atlantic Brewing Company. He also served in Newfoundland&#x27;s provincial assembly and as president of the St. John&#x27;s metro board.

O&#x27;Dea attended the parochial schools of St. John&#x27;s including Winterton School and Saint Bonaventure&#x27;s College. According to his memoir, as an eleven year old at Saint Bonaventure&#x27;s he was sexually molested by a member of the Christian Brothers who was serving on the faculty. In the fall of 1965, O&#x27;Dea began attendance at Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John&#x27;s. While in college, O&#x27;Dea worked as the host of a CJON (now CJYQ) radio call in show that dealt with current events, and sold advertising for the college radio station and newspaper, CHMR and &quot;The Muse&quot;. In addition, O&#x27;Dea also began dealing in marijuana, traveling to Toronto to buy the drug from suppliers, then returning to St. John&#x27;s to resell it at a profit. His drug business expanded to include the sale and production of MDA, a precursor to MDMA (ecstasy).

==Drug dealer==
After leaving the university without graduating, O&#x27;Dea continued to deal drugs and became an importer of marijuana to Canada from the United Kingdom. In 1972, he was arrested for possession of hashish, marijuana, and cocaine with intent to distribute. He was convicted and sentenced to nineteen months in prison. He served twelve months before being released.

After leaving prison, O&#x27;Dea traveled to Colombia to re-establish a connection with an acquaintance he had met in Montreal before going to prison. He used this relationship to establish himself as a cocaine smuggler, and developed a regular routine of picking up shipments in Colombia and carrying them into Canada, where he broke down the packages into smaller amounts for individual resale.

Following the success of his smuggling trips, O&#x27;Dea renewed the acquaintance of several individuals living in Toronto whom he had known in Newfoundland. The group agreed to have O&#x27;Dea establish a presence in Jamaica, where he could use his Colombian contacts to bring in cocaine. Other members of the organization would be responsible for transporting the cocaine from Jamaica to Canada and selling it. The relationship soon soured, and O&#x27;Dea developed new Jamaican contacts that enabled him to continue smuggling.

In 1975, O&#x27;Dea and a Chicago-based partner agreed to smuggle marijuana from Colombia by boat to the United States. When this venture proved unsuccessful, O&#x27;Dea and his partner in Chicago made an arrangement with smugglers based in Florida and Georgia to move the marijuana from Colombia by air and purchased a Douglas DC-6 transport plane for the purpose. This venture failed when mechanical failure caused O&#x27;Dea and the pilot to ditch the plane, resulting in the loss of both plane and cargo.

==Move to California==
Having lost most of his money in the unsuccessful attempt to smuggle marijuana by airplane, in 1976, O&#x27;Dea re-established contact with a Los Angeles-based attorney he had met in Jamaica. He moved to California, where he became a courier for a group of individuals who moved money for wealthy clients. O&#x27;Dea&#x27;s function was to circulate among the banks of Los Angeles exchanging cash for cashier&#x27;s checks made payable to overseas companies. He would then return the checks to his employers, who would deposit them in foreign banks. He also re-established himself as a cocaine smuggler, using a small network of couriers to carry the drugs from Colombia to one of the Caribbean islands, including Saint Martin, Guadeloupe, and Martinique. O&#x27;Dea would then repackage the shipments for transport to Los Angeles and resale.

In the late 1970s, O&#x27;Dea met Bill and Chris Shaffer, wealthy brothers who had interests in both legal and illegal businesses. O&#x27;Dea began to work for Bill Shaffer, including distributing marijuana. In addition, O&#x27;Dea operated for Shaffer a crew of couriers who helped move money to overseas banks using the same method of exchanging cash for cashier&#x27;s checks that O&#x27;Dea had used when working as a courier.

==Entrepreneur==
O&#x27;Dea was periodically involved in legitimate business ventures, several of which proved successful. While living in California in the late 1970s and early 1980s, his wife and he had an antique store. His wife was a hairdresser, and O&#x27;Dea recognized the potential of Tri, the brand of haircare products she used when she cut his hair. He established a business relationship with Tri&#x27;s sales manager, John Paul DeJoria, which led to O&#x27;Dea becoming the product&#x27;s Canadian distributor. When DeJoria was fired, O&#x27;Dea loaned him $15,000 to help start the Paul Mitchell hair products line.

O&#x27;Dea declined DeJoria&#x27;s offer to join him in the Paul Mitchell venture because he felt obligated to honor his agreement with the makers of Tri. He successfully retailed Tri in Vancouver, and planned to expand into more cities, but abandoned the venture when Canadian authorities who suspected him of involvement in illegal drugs accused him of avoiding customs duties. To avoid a prison term, he pleaded guilty and paid a $25,000 fine, and his business was closed.

O&#x27;Dea developed a cocaine addiction and spent time in a rehabilitation clinic. After his release, he resolved to stay sober and leave the drug business. With two acquaintances, he developed a plan to market as jewelry agatized dinosaur bones found in Utah. The Shaffers agreed to finance the enterprise, and it was this business O&#x27;Dea was promoting when he became involved in the large-scale marijuana smuggling venture for which he is best known.

==Southeast Asia connection==
In 1986, a Canadian involved in selling illegal drugs who was also acquainted with O&#x27;Dea told O&#x27;Dea about the opportunity to import tons of marijuana from Southeast Asia. Lured by the possibility of large profits, the Shaffers agreed to finance the operation, and O&#x27;Dea agreed to manage it. Using a commercial vessel, they transported shiploads of marijuana from Vietnam and Thailand to the coast of Alaska. Crews working for O&#x27;Dea transferred the marijuana to their commercial fishing boats and repackaged it in fish boxes. They then sailed to their home port in Anacortes, Washington, where the fish boxes containing marijuana were moved to trucks owned by a company O&#x27;Dea controlled. The trucks transported the cargo to California for distribution and sale throughout the United States.

Between 1986 and 1988, O&#x27;Dea&#x27;s Pacific Northwest enterprise successfully smuggled 76 tons of marijuana worth about $300 million. The individual who brought O&#x27;Dea into the arrangement drew attention to himself through ostentatious behavior including cocaine-fueled parties, so O&#x27;Dea removed him from the operation while promising to pay him after the marijuana was sold. This individual became an informant, and during their final shipment, O&#x27;Dea&#x27;s crew succeeded in transporting the marijuana despite being under surveillance by the Drug Enforcement Administration.

==Arrest and imprisonment==
O&#x27;Dea had relapsed into occasional drug use following his first attempt at rehabilitation. After the transport of the Pacific Northwest venture&#x27;s last marijuana shipment, he fell into constant cocaine use. Following a heart attack brought on by a cocaine overdose, in 1988 he quit drugs and became a volunteer drug and alcohol addiction counselor.

While volunteering as a counselor, O&#x27;Dea became friendly with psychologist Dave Richo and made use of his entrepreneurial skills to sell Richo&#x27;s book &quot;Letting the Light Through&quot; by making calls on bookstores throughout Southern California. Later, he began to record and sell copies of lectures Richo presented to adult learning students at Santa Barbara City College.

The DEA had continued investigating O&#x27;Dea&#x27;s Pacific Northwest operation, and in 1990 he was arrested. He pleaded guilty in 1991 and was sentenced to ten years in prison. He served a year at Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island, and in 1992 was transferred to the Springhill Penitentiary in Canada.

==Later career==
In 1993, O&#x27;Dea was paroled and he became a venture capitalist in Toronto. He attracted media attention in 2001 when he published an advertisement in the &quot;National Post&quot; through which he attempted to obtain employment by highlighting aspects of his drug smuggling endeavors, including his personnel and logistics management skills. He also began to appear on television as a commentator for U.S. and Canadian news programs, frequently providing his views on marijuana legalization, prison reform, and other topics.

As he attempted to establish himself in a post-prison career, O&#x27;Dea also began volunteering to give speeches about his life in the drug business. He appeared at schools and parent groups throughout Canada to deliver a presentation called &quot;The Consequences of Choice&quot; in which he used his experiences to dissuade others from following the same path. His efforts resulted in public recognition for his community service from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

O&#x27;Dea went on to become a television and film producer. His credits include the show &quot;Creepy Canada&quot;, which aired on the OLN and Destination America networks. In 2003, O&#x27;Dea&#x27;s drug smuggling enterprise was featured on the television series &quot;Masterminds&quot; in an episode titled &quot;A Smuggler Supreme&quot;.

In 2006, O&#x27;Dea published a memoir, &quot;HIGH: Confessions of a Pot Smuggler&quot;. &quot;HIGH&quot; was well-received, and was the winner of the 2007 Arthur Ellis Award for Best True Crime Book.

O&#x27;Dea narrated the 2009 documentary &quot;Hangman&#x27;s Graveyard&quot;. In 2012, he appeared as Kevin O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s advisor on the CBC Television Reality TV Show &quot;Redemption Inc.&quot; O&#x27;Dea told his story of smuggling drugs, getting caught, and changing his life in the September 27, 2012 &quot;Trust Me&quot; segment of the &quot;Snap Judgment&quot; radio show.

With U.S. states and Canadian provinces legalizing recreational marijuana beginning in 2012, in recent years celebrities and business people desiring to market marijuana under their brand names, including Ghostface Killah and Kurupt have turned to O&#x27;Dea to broker arrangements between them, suppliers, and retailers. In 2018, O&#x27;Dea was reported to be living in Montecito, California, where he continued to work as a broker for legal marijuana entrepreneurs and his neighbors included Oprah Winfrey and Jeff Bridges. In January 2018, O&#x27;Dea and his family narrowly escaped a mudslide that inundated his hometown. His house was spared, but those of several neighbors sustained significant damage.

In July 2021, O&#x27;Dea was a guest on the &quot;Crime &amp; Entertainment&quot; podcast, during which he discussed his smuggling career and subsequent efforts to promote prison reform and reform of drug laws. In March 2022, he was a guest on the &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; podcast hosted by author and diversity consultant Stephen Dorsey. During their discussion, O&#x27;Dea continued his advocacy of criminal justice reform and marijuana legalization. In the summer of 2022, O&#x27;Dea obtained financing for a film about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and traveled to Ukraine with photographer and videographer Frank Vilaca to document events in the war zone.

==Family==
In 1972, O&#x27;Dea married Eleanor &quot;Ellie&quot; Miller. They divorced in 1973, during his first prison term. While living in California in 1977, he married Suzi Foreman, with whom he had two children, daughter Cherokee and son Cheyenne. They divorced in 1988, and in 1993 O&#x27;Dea married Susannah Lewis, whom he met while living in California. They are the parents of a son, Rufus.

<doc id="1023589" wikidata="Q934881" url="?curid=1023589" title="Jack Ketch">
<text>John Ketch (died November 1686), generally known as Jack Ketch, was an infamous English executioner employed by King Charles II. He became famous through the way he performed his duties during the tumults of the 1680s, when he was often mentioned in broadsheet accounts that circulated throughout the Kingdom of England. He is thought to have been appointed in 1663.

He executed the death sentences against William Russell, Lord Russell, in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields on 21 July 1683, and James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, on 15 July 1685, after the Monmouth Rebellion. Ketch&#x27;s notoriety stems from &quot;barbarity at the execution of Lord Russell, the Duke of Monmouth, and other political offenders&quot;.

Because of his botched executions, the name &quot;Jack Ketch&quot; is used as a proverbial name for death, Satan and executioners.

== Appointment ==
Ketch took office in 1663, succeeding the late Edward Dun, to whom he had been apprenticed. He is first mentioned in the Proceedings of the Old Bailey for 14 January 1676, although no printed notice of the new hangman occurred until 2 December 1678, when a broadside appeared called &quot;The Plotters Ballad, being Jack Ketch&#x27;s incomparable Receipt for the Cure of Traytorous Recusants and Wholesome Physick for a Popish Contagion.&quot;

In 1679, there appears from another pamphlet purporting to be written by Ketch himself, and entitled &quot;The Man of Destiny&#x27;s Hard Fortune&quot;, that the hangman was confined for a time in the Marshalsea prison, &quot;whereby his hopeful harvest was like to have been blasted.&quot;

A short entry in the autobiography of Anthony à Wood for 31 August 1681 describes how Stephen College was hanged in the Castle Yard, Oxford, &quot;and when he had hanged about half an hour, was cut down by Catch or Ketch, and quartered under the gallows, his entrails were burnt in a fire made by the gallows&quot;.

== Lord Russell&#x27;s execution ==

On that occasion, Ketch wielded the instrument of death either with such sadistically nuanced skill or with such lack of simple dexterity – nobody could tell which – that the victim suffered horrifically under blow after blow, each excruciating but not in itself lethal. Even among the bloodthirsty throngs that habitually attended English beheadings, the gory and agonizing display had created such outrage that Ketch felt moved to write and publish a pamphlet titled &quot;Apologie&quot;, in which he excused his performance with the claim that Lord Russell had failed to &quot;dispose himself as was most suitable&quot; and that he was therefore distracted while taking aim on his neck.
Ketch was paid by Russell beforehand, as it was customary for those sentenced to death by beheading (which in those days was &quot;reserved for ... aristocrats&quot;) &quot;to tip the public executioner in advance. It was hoped this would encourage him to do a swift and efficient job, hopefully despatching the victim in one clean blow.&quot; In spite of this, Ketch allegedly &quot;did such a bad job that, after the axe hit the side of Russell&#x27;s head, Russell looked up at him and said, &#x27;You dog, did I give you ten guineas to use me so inhumanely?&#x27;&quot; However, in the pamphlet purportedly authored by him, Ketch &quot;repudiated the charge&quot; that Russell had paid him twenty guineas the night before the execution (although he stated it was &quot;true I receav&#x27;d 10. Guenies&quot; from him on the scaffold), that Russell had insulted him, or that he had struck Russell&#x27;s shoulder rather than his head. Although biographer Sidney Lee believed that the pamphlet was &quot;probably written by Ketch himself&quot;, author Stephen Wade describes the provenance of &quot;The Apology of John Ketch Esq.&quot; as &quot;questionable&quot;, since we have &quot;no accurate notion of who wrote&quot; it. He argues that &quot;it may well have been what we would now call a &#x27;ghost writer&#x27; out to make a few groats by fabricating a biography of a notorious public figure.&quot;

== James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth&#x27;s execution ==
He [the duke] would not make use of a cap or other circumstance, but lying down, bid the fellow to do his office better than to the late Lord Russell, and gave him gold; but the wretch made five chops before he had his head off; which so incensed the people, that had he not been guarded and got away, they would have torn him to pieces.

== Later life and death ==
In January 1686, Ketch was committed to Bridewell Prison for &quot;affronting&quot; a sheriff. His assistant, Paskah Rose, formerly a butcher, took his place. However, on 28 May, following his conviction for robbery, Rose himself was hanged at Tyburn, and Ketch was reinstated. Ketch died in November 1686. Ketch&#x27;s &quot;wife is reported to have said, “That any bungler might put a man to death, but that her husband only knew how to make a Gentleman die sweetly.”&quot;

== Fiction ==
In 1836, a fictitious autobiography of Ketch, with illustrations from designs by Meadows entitled &quot;The autobiography of Jack Ketch&quot;, was published. Another book entitled &quot;Life of Jack Ketch with Cuts of his own Execution&quot; was furnished by Tom Hood for the Duke of Devonshire&#x27;s library at Chatsworth.

Jack Ketch is one of the characters in Giovanni Piccini (d. 1835) &quot;The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Punch and Judy&quot; as dictated to John Payne Collier, in 1828. He is mentioned in the Charles Dickens novels &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, &quot;Dombey and Son&quot;, &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; and &quot;David Copperfield&quot; and in the C. M. Kornbluth science fiction story &quot;The Marching Morons&quot; (1951). More recently, Jack Ketch plays a role in Neal Stephenson&#x27;s 2003 and 2004 volumes &quot;Quicksilver&quot; and &quot;The System of the World&quot;, the first and last volumes, respectively, in his &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot; series (though the last volume is set in 1714, well after the death of the historical Jack Ketch.) Ketch makes a brief appearance in issue #10 of Bill Willingham&#x27;s comic book series &quot;Fables&quot; and in the first book of Ben Aaronovitch Rivers of London series.

He is mentioned briefly in the 1951 movie of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; with Alistair Sim, when Mr. Jorkin warns the directors of the Amalgamated Mercantile Society to watch out for Scrooge and Marley, as &quot;They&#x27;d skin Jack Ketch alive and he&#x27;d never know they&#x27;d done it.&quot;

The long-running radio program Suspense aired an episode titled &quot;Jack Ketch&quot; starring British actor Charles Laughton on September 22, 1952.

<text>Gary Lockwood (born John Gary Yurosek; February 21, 1937) is an American actor. Lockwood is best known for his roles as astronaut Frank Poole in the film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968), and as Lieutenant Commander Gary Mitchell in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; second pilot episode &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; (1966). He starred in the only American film by French New Wave director Jacques Demy, &quot;Model Shop&quot;. He played numerous guest television roles from the early 1960s into the mid 1990s, and played the title role in &quot;The Lieutenant&quot; (1963–1964).

==Early life==
Lockwood was born in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California as John Gary Yurosek of partial Polish descent. His uncle, Mike Yurosek, is credited with creating baby-cut carrots. He was a one-year letterman for legendary Coach Red Sanders in 1956 and is listed as Gary Yurosek in official UCLA Athletics records.

==Career==
Lockwood was a film stuntman, and a stand-in for Anthony Perkins prior to his acting début in 1959 in an uncredited bit role in &quot;Warlock&quot;.

Lockwood&#x27;s two series came early in his career, and each lasted only a single season. ABC&#x27;s Hawaii-set &quot;Follow the Sun&quot; (1961–62) cast him in support of Brett Halsey and Barry Coe, who played adventurous magazine writers based in Honolulu. Lockwood was Eric Jason, who did the legwork for their articles. He appeared in a supporting role in the film &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot; (1961) and in ABC&#x27;s TV series &quot;Bus Stop&quot; (1961). The 26-week series, which starred Marilyn Maxwell as the owner of a diner in fictitious Sunrise, Colorado, aired a half-hour after &quot;Follow the Sun&quot;.

In his film debut, he appeared with Tuesday Weld in &quot;Wild in the Country&quot; (1961), starring Elvis Presley. Thereafter, Lockwood starred with Jeff Bridges in the acclaimed &quot;My Daddy Can Beat Your Daddy&quot; episode of &quot;The Lloyd Bridges Show&quot;. In 1959, he had an uncredited role as a police officer in the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; episode &quot;The Case of the Romantic Rogue&quot;. His first lead role came in 1961&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Sword&quot;, written and directed by Bert I. Gordon. In 1962, Lockwood again appeared on &quot;Perry Mason&quot; in the lead role in &quot;The Case of the Playboy Pugilist&quot;. In 1963, Lockwood co-starred with Elvis Presley in the musical-comedy film &quot;It Happened at the World&#x27;s Fair&quot;.

In 1963 and 1964, Lockwood starred as a young U.S. Marine second lieutenant named William T. (&quot;Bill&quot;) Rice in the NBC series &quot;The Lieutenant&quot;. This drama, about the peacetime Marines, was produced by the creators of &quot;Star Trek&quot; (Gene Roddenberry) and &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (Norman Felton). The series co-starred Robert Vaughn as Lieutenant Rice&#x27;s immediate superior, Captain Raymond Rambridge. Despite moderately good reviews, &quot;The Lieutenant&quot; Saturday night time slot, opposite CBS&#x27; popular &quot;Jackie Gleason&#x27;s American Scene Magazine&quot;, hastened its cancellation after 29 episodes.

In 1964, Lockwood guest-starred as Major Gus Denver in the first season of &quot;12 O&#x27;Clock High&quot;, in episode 9, &quot;Appointment at Liege&quot;, and again in 1965 in episode 29, &quot;V For Vendetta&quot;. He also guest-starred as Lt. Josh McGraw in season 2, episode 4, &quot;The Idolator&quot; of &quot;12 O&#x27;Clock High&quot;. Shortly afterward, Lockwood starred in another NBC television series &quot;The Kraft Mystery Theater&quot; (also known as &quot;Crisis&quot;) in an episode titled &quot;Connery&#x27;s Hands&quot;. He was cast opposite Sally Kellerman, with whom he would soon appear again as Helmsman Gary Mitchell in the second &quot;Star Trek&quot; pilot, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; (1965), in which their characters develop malign super powers.

In 1966, he starred as murderous bank robbing cowboy “Jim Stark” in a rare two-part episode of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; called “The Raid” (S11E19), along with John Anderson, Michael Conrad, Jim Davis, and Richard Jaeckel.

He may be best known on the big screen for his co-starring role in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) as Dr. Frank Poole. Lockwood was the lead in &quot;Model Shop&quot; (1969), the American debut by French writer-director Jacques Demy. He starred with Elke Sommer in the crime drama &quot;They Came to Rob Las Vegas&quot; (1968) and with Jacqueline Bisset in the pro- women&#x27;s lib comedy &quot;Stand Up and Be Counted&quot; (1972).

Lockwood co-starred with Stefanie Powers (then his wife) in an episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Love, American Style&quot; as a newlywed who gets his mouth stuck around a doorknob. In 1983, he guest-starred in the series &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; (&quot;Emily by Hart&quot;) with Robert Wagner and Powers, by then his ex-wife. Between 1959 and 2004, Lockwood gained roles in some 40 theatrical features and made-for-TV movies and 80 TV guest appearances, including the CBS 1975 family drama &quot;Three for the Road&quot; and &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; starring Buddy Ebsen, in which he appeared many times as a villain.

==Personal life==
Lockwood has been married twice. His first marriage was in 1966 to actress Stefanie Powers. The couple divorced in 1972. In 1982, Lockwood married actress and businesswoman Denise DuBarry, with whom he has a daughter, Samantha DuBarry-Lockwood (b. 1982).

<text>Naila is a town in the Hof district of Bavaria, Germany. It lies in the Franconian Forest. Naila is from the larger city of Hof, on both banks of the Selbitz river.
==History==
The earliest documentation of Naila was recorded on 9 January 1343. The first settlements in the area around Naila probably happened between the 12th and 14th century. The name Naila first appeared as &quot;Neulins&quot; (and variations thereof), has its origins most likely in the meaning &quot;Small new settlement&quot;. In 1454, Naila was awarded a coat of arms by its overlord, Margrave John.

After a brief episode under Prussian reign (1792–1810), Naila was included into the newly-established Kingdom of Bavaria. In 1818, it was awarded town privileges and in 1886, a railroad station was opened in Naila. After World War II, the Iron Curtain, just north of Naila, cut off a large part of the market for the local industries. 

The town was the seat of the then district of Naila until this was merged into Hof district in 1972, and had to give up their number-plate code NAI in favour of HO. The villages of Marxgrün, Lippertsgrün and Marlesreuth were incorporated to Naila in 1978.

In 1979, Naila was the landing site of the Strelzyk and Wetzel families&#x27; famous homemade hot-air balloon escape from East Germany.

<doc id="1023605" wikidata="Q3107364" url="?curid=1023605" title="'Tis the Fifteenth Season">
<text>&quot;Tis the Fifteenth Season&quot; is the seventh episode of the fifteenth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and the seventh Christmas-themed episode overall. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 14, 2003. The episode was written by Michael Price and directed by Steven Dean Moore.

In this episode, Homer feels guilty after spending most of the family&#x27;s Christmas present money for himself, so he vows to be more charitable. The episode received mixed reviews.

==Plot==
At the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, the employees of Sector 7G have a Secret Santa. Homer receives a DVD player and the first season of &quot;Magnum P.I.&quot; from Carl, but Homer himself, at the very last moment, gets Lenny a wrap of Certs from the vending machine, much to everybody&#x27;s chagrin. Instead of a Christmas bonus, Mr. Burns gives Homer a Joe DiMaggio baseball card. He sells it to Comic Book Guy and earns a small fortune, then takes the family Christmas shopping at upmarket shops. Homer promises to buy a large Christmas tree, but instead spends most of the money on a talking astrolabe for himself, meaning that the only Christmas tree Homer can buy with the leftover money is a cheap, dry, twig-like tree that catches fire if rubbed; after hearing the astrolabe talk, the family are disappointed by his selfish behavior. That night, after being made to sleep on the couch by Marge, Homer watches &quot;Mr. McGrew&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; and after imagining seeing his name in the show, realizes that he must change his ways.

Now more charitable, Homer apologizes for his mistakes, donates his old clothes to the homeless shelter, gives Marge the last porkchop at dinner, and builds a public skating rink in his backyard, as well as giving Lenny a decent Christmas present to make up for the Secret Santa: a cube made of photographs of Lenny and his friends. At church, Ned Flanders becomes jealous of Homer&#x27;s position as the new nicest person in town and sets out to buy gifts for everyone to regain the title. Meanwhile, Lisa tells Homer about her Buddhist beliefs that people would be happier without material goods. For his next good deed, on Christmas Eve night, Homer sneaks into the citizens&#x27; houses and steals their presents. In the morning, an angry mob confronts Homer and Flanders. Flanders calms them by reciting a Bible verse, while Homer shows a Christmas star, which actually is a distress flare fired by Hans Moleman, before he and Ned give everyone back their presents and everybody sings &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot;. The episode ends with Snake stealing Homer&#x27;s astrolabe and running away.

==Production==
The episode was written by Michael Price, who has cited &quot;Homer&#x27;s summation of what Christmas means&quot; as his favorite contribution to the show. He has said that the speech &quot;pretty much stayed that way through all drafts of the episode.&quot;

==Cultural references==
&quot;Mr. McGrew&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;, the Christmas special that Homer watches, is a parody of &quot;Mr. Magoo&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot;. The montage in which Homer takes all the presents from Springfield strongly references the &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot; television special. In fact, a parody of the song &quot;You&#x27;re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch&quot;, sung by Dan Castallaneta, can be heard during the montage.

==Reception==
===Viewing figures===
The episode was watched by 11.28 million viewers, which was the 28th most-watched show that week.

===Critical response===
On November 2, 2004, the episode was released in the United States on a DVD collection titled &quot;The Simpsons Christmas 2&quot;, along with the twelfth season episodes &quot;Homer vs. Dignity&quot; and &quot;Skinner&#x27;s Sense of Snow&quot; and the fourteenth season episode &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s My Ranch?&quot;. While reviewing the DVD, Brian James of &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote that Tis the Fifteenth Season&quot; is &quot;hardly a masterpiece, but it does feature a talking astrolabe and the phrase &#x27;double-bacon genius-burger,&#x27; two elements that deserve a spot in Simpson Valhalla. It&#x27;s a shame that such entries don&#x27;t come as fast and furious as they did a decade ago, but that &quot;The Simpsons&quot; does offer a few belly laughs now and then, rather than being a complete embarrassment this late in the game is a bigger accomplishment than anyone gives it credit for. It&#x27;s still just a cartoon, and still a pretty good one.&quot;

Kyle Ryan of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; praised the episode for &quot;strik[ing] a nice balance between sharp satire and real heart.&quot;

Colin Jacobson of &quot;DVD Movie Guide&quot; said that Flanders was acting out of character and that there were too many holiday show references. He felt the episode was &quot;fairly uninspired.&quot;

On &quot;Four Finger Discount&quot;, Guy Davis and Brendan Dando thought it was a &quot;perfectly acceptable Christmas special.&quot; They thought Flanders&#x27; jealousy reminded them of the fifth season episode &quot;Homer Loves Flanders&quot;, but felt Homer&#x27;s gift to himself was more thoughtless than selfish since he is the family&#x27;s sole provider.

===Themes and analysis===
Wind Goodfriend wrote that Homer learning making sacrifices is an example of an investment couples make where the individuals give something up for the good of their relationship.

<doc id="1023607" wikidata="Q832532" url="?curid=1023607" title="George Lillo">
<text>George Lillo (3 February 1691 – 4 September 1739) was an English playwright and tragedian. He was also a jeweller in London. He produced his first stage work, &quot;Silvia, or The Country Burial&quot;, in 1730, and a year later his most famous play, &quot;The London Merchant&quot;. He wrote at least six more plays before his death in 1739, including &quot;The Christian Hero&quot; (1735), &quot;Fatal Curiosity&quot; (1737) and &quot;Marina&quot; (1738).

==Life==
George Lillo was born in Moorfields, or Moorgate, in the City of London. He became a partner in his father&#x27;s goldsmith&#x27;s and jewellery business.

===Early stage works===
Lillo wrote at least eight plays between 1730 and his death in 1739. His first work in the theatre was the ballad opera &quot;Sylvia, or The Country Burial&quot; in 1730. He wrote it in order to reproduce the success of John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, but Lillo&#x27;s play received mixed reviews and only showed for three nights at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, in November 1730, and for a one-night revival at Covent Garden in March 1738, reduced to two acts.
The following year, Lillo wrote his most famous play, &quot;The London Merchant, or The History of George Barnwell&quot; (1731), which is considered one of the most popular and frequently produced plays of the 18th century. In October 1731 it was presented by royal command in the presence of George II and Queen Caroline. It was in the genre that came to be called melodrama. In &quot;The London Merchant,&quot; the subject is an apprentice who is seduced by Sarah Millwood, a &quot;lady of pleasure,&quot; and then struggles to atone for his indiscretion throughout the remainder of the play, with little success. Lillo shows how &quot;evil breeds evil,&quot; and Barnwell&#x27;s initial dalliance eventually leads him to rob his master and murder his uncle in an attempt to secure the money needed to save Millwood&#x27;s ostensibly endangered reputation. Her seduction, however, is simply a ruse to exploit his naïveté, so her reputation is never actually in danger. Lillo redefined the subject of dramatic tragedy and demonstrated that middle and lower class citizens were worthy of tragic downfalls. The 17th century ballad about a murder in Shropshire was the historical foundation for the play. Lillo dedicates the play to Sir John Eyles, a prominent member of the merchant class in London, in a letter before the text and plot begins. Lillo&#x27;s domestic tragedy reflects a turning of the theatre away from the court and toward the town. Dickens introduced &quot;the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell&quot; into his novel &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. It was dismissed as a &quot;nauseous sermon&quot; by Charles Lamb, though much admired by Lillo&#x27;s contemporaries Samuel Richardson and Colley Cibber, who acted in the original production of the play.

Lillo revived the genre of play referred to as domestic tragedy (or bourgeois tragedy). Even though the Jacobean stage had flirted with merchant and artisan plays in the past (with, for example, Thomas Dekker and Thomas Heywood), &quot;The London Merchant&quot; was a significant change in theatre, and in tragedy in particular. Instead of dealing with heroes from classical literature or the Bible, presented with spectacle and grand stage effects, his subjects concerned everyday people, such as his audience, the theater-going middle classes, and his tragedies were conducted on the intimate scale of households, rather than kingdoms.

Lillo was concerned that plays be morally correct and in keeping with Christian values. In 1734 he produced a patriotic masque, &quot;Britannia and Batavia,&quot; for the royal wedding of Anne, the Princess Royal, to William IV of Orange-Nassau. His next play was &quot;The Christian Hero&quot; (1735), a retelling of the story of Skanderbeg.

===Later years===
Later in the decade, Lillo wrote &quot;Fatal Curiosity&quot; (1737) and &quot;Marina&quot; (1738). He based &quot;Marina&quot; on the play &quot;Pericles&quot; by William Shakespeare. His last play, &quot;Elmerick, or Justice Triumphant,&quot; was performed posthumously in 1740. Lillo adapted the anonymous Elizabethan play &quot;Arden of Feversham&quot;, which was posthumously performed, first in 1759. It was based on the life of Alice Arden.

In his own day, his later plays, other than &quot;Merchant&quot;, were only moderate successes, and after his death old style tragedies and comedies continued to dominate the stage. All of Lillo&#x27;s plays were produced in London, and only three of them produced any profit.

Lillo died at age 48, in 1739, in Rotherhithe, London.

<doc id="1023613" wikidata="Q2610772" url="?curid=1023613" title="American Dreams">
<text>American Dreams is an American drama television series that ran on NBC for three seasons and 61 episodes, from September 29, 2002, to March 30, 2005. The show tells the story of the Pryor family of Philadelphia during the mid-1960s, with many plotlines around teenager Meg Pryor (Brittany Snow), who dances on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. The show often featured contemporary musicians performing as popular musicians of the 1960s. Season one takes place in 1963–64, season two in 1964–65 and season three in 1965–66.

The series was created by Jonathan Prince and developed by Josh Goldstein and Prince; the latter was also one of the executive producers with Dick Clark. It debuted on September 29, 2002, and initially aired on Sundays at 8:00 pm Eastern Time but moved to the same time on Wednesdays from March 9, 2005, to the third-season finale (March 30, 2005). The show was known as &quot;Our Generation&quot; when it debuted in Australia but was changed back to &quot;American Dreams&quot; when it returned for the second season.

The theme song &quot;Generation&quot; was written and performed by Emerson Hart, lead singer of the band Tonic. The song earned Hart an ASCAP award for Best Theme Song of Television in 2003. The show was the 2003 TV Land Awards &quot;Future Classic&quot; winner.

==Series overview==
In 1963 Philadelphia, the Pryors are a close Irish American Catholic family. World War II veteran John &quot;Jack&quot; Pryor owns a television and radio store. He and his homemaker wife Helen have four children: High school senior and football player John &quot;JJ&quot; Pryor, Jr., younger sisters Meg and Patty, and younger brother Will, who is lame from polio. Jack employs Henry Walker, whose son Sam is among the few African-American students at East Catholic High School. Meg and her best friend, Roxanne, pass the audition to dance on camera for Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, filmed in the city, while JJ hopes to win a football scholarship to play for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. The show depicts historical events, such as the assassination of John F. Kennedy, 1964 Philadelphia race riot, and American involvement in—and opposition to—the Vietnam War.

It is important to note that the rest of history plays out exactly like real life. The main difference is that &quot;American Bandstand&quot; did not move to Los Angeles in early 1964 but instead stayed in Philadelphia contrary to the real life events of the show.

===Season 1 (2002–03)===
===Season 2 (2003–04)===
===Season 3 (2004–05)===
==Synopsis==

===Season 1===
In the pilot episode, set in November 1963, Meg and Roxanne win the opportunity to join the dancers on the TV show &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, filmed in Philadelphia. Passing note is made of the John F. Kennedy assassination and funeral. &quot;Bandstand&quot; immediately becomes the principal creative pillar of &quot;American Dreams&quot;, with each episode featuring recreated versions of several musical acts that originally appeared on the real &quot;Bandstand&quot;, often rendered by modern singers.

JJ Pryor, a running back for the East Catholic Fighting Crusaders football team, tries and fails to earn a full athletic scholarship to play at the University of Notre Dame, so he later applies for and is accepted to Lehigh University. A nagging ankle injury curtails his football career, so he enlists in the United States Marine Corps to pay for school. Meanwhile, JJ&#x27;s on-again, off-again girlfriend Beth chooses to attend the University of Pennsylvania in order to be near JJ.

In the early part of the season, Meg develops a crush on a &quot;Bandstand&quot; dancer, and they go on a couple of public appearance dates. While never becoming romantic, they remained good friends. Meg later developed a romance with Luke Foley, a record store clerk and fellow East Catholic student.

Sam Walker wins a track athletic scholarship to East Catholic. Sam&#x27;s father Henry states that there are only three other black male students at East Catholic; some in the majority-white student body resent Sam&#x27;s presence, especially Tommy DeFelice, who is later expelled after falsely confessing to JJ&#x27;s crime of breaking Beth&#x27;s current boyfriend&#x27;s windshield. Sam and Meg develop a friendship, even creating a record-swapping club while meeting at the Vinyl Crocodile record store.

In the season finale on May 18, 2003, Meg and Sam are caught in the summer 1964 race riot in Philadelphia.

===Season 2===
Meg and Sam survive the riots unharmed, but the branch of Jack&#x27;s store under Henry&#x27;s management is destroyed. Gwen dies from cancer. JJ excels at boot camp and arrives in Vietnam. While on leave, he and Beth are reunited in Hawaii; they break up, but Beth soon learns she is pregnant with JJ&#x27;s child, and she moves in with the Pryors.

Helen discovers that there might be a possible surgical treatment for Will&#x27;s paralysis, and the early part of the season deals with Will&#x27;s medical treatment. By the end of the season, Will&#x27;s leg braces have been removed and he is able to walk normally.

Roxanne exchanges promise rings with boyfriend Lenny, and goes on tour with him before returning home. Later on, she dates Meg&#x27;s ex-boyfriend, Luke. Meg dates a college boy, Drew, despite JJ and her father&#x27;s strong dislike for him, but breaks it off when he ends up cheating on her.

Sam wins a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania. Jack decides to run for the City Council. In the season finale on April 4, 2004, Sam&#x27;s cousin Nathan is drafted and opts to go to jail rather than serve in Vietnam. Also in that episode, JJ is caught in a fierce firefight, while Meg and Sam are arrested at a campus rally protesting the Vietnam war.

===Season 3===
The arrests widen the communications gap between parents and children, and inspire Meg to lead additional protests. A strict new headmaster also fires Meg up. An injured JJ wakes up in an American military hospital, and learns of his forthcoming child; Beth refuses to accept JJ&#x27;s offer of marriage. Roxanne, estranged from her mother, moves in with the Pryors. JJ gets recruited for special, somewhat mysterious duty for the US government. Jack wins an upset victory for the City Council.

As Thanksgiving nears closer, JJ is captured by the Viet Cong. He and his sergeant escape, but are presumed missing in action (the sergeant is later found buried in a shallow grave). The Pryors learn of JJ&#x27;s &quot;Missing In Action&quot; status just before Thanksgiving.

Luke Foley returns to Philadelphia, and Roxanne, who moves out on her remarrying mother, moves in with him in a loft above the Vinyl Crocodile record store.

On a commercial-free special episode that aired November 21, 2004, JJ returns home. At episode&#x27;s end he glares harshly at his mother. In the next original episode, JJ becomes a Marine recruiter and suffers from post-traumatic flashbacks. He proposes to Beth. Helen becomes involved with a Catholic peace group.

As the show enters 1966, JJ marries Beth in a ceremony held at the Pryors&#x27; catholic church. Jack Pryor, newly elected to the Philadelphia City Council, is forced to take a bribe, with the money going to help JJ repay some gambling debts. Eventually Jack votes to elect a local activist in his district, Reverend Davis, to the Police Review Board essentially voting against the council. For this act of disloyalty, several members of the police force beat up JJ after a traffic stop. Pete soon finds the culprits who attacked JJ and roughs them up, but Jack decides to resign from the council.

Chris and Meg&#x27;s relationship becomes more intimate, but Meg is troubled by reports that Chris helped set fire to a recruitment center. Despite this, Meg and Chris eventually have sex—with Chris revealing afterward that he did indeed lie to Meg about the recruitment center. Meg and Chris eventually break up, and Chris leaves Philadelphia.

Meg and Sam consider the possibility of a romantic relationship, but JJ and Nathan discourage the idea. Meanwhile, Jack and Pete&#x27;s older brother Ted gets into a serious car accident, putting him on a respirator. After much soul searching, the Pryors decide to disconnect the machine. After returning home from a Rolling Stones concert, Meg finds her ex-boyfriend Chris standing in front of her home. He&#x27;s just been drafted.

In the season/series finale, Meg and Chris both leave Philadelphia on Chris&#x27; motorcycle, with plans for them to live in Berkeley, California and campaign against the war. JJ Pryor applies for and receives a job in aeronautics, assisting in space suit design for future NASA missions to the Moon.

==Ratings==
Seasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of &quot;American Dreams&quot; on NBC.
==Cancellation==
On May 16, 2005, NBC announced their fall schedule for the 2005–06 season. Confirming months of speculation (and an unofficial confirmation article on May 1 by Reuters), &quot;American Dreams&quot; was formally canceled, due to low ratings.

Never a strong performer in its Sunday 8pm timeslot, the show&#x27;s third-season ratings dropped 33% from its first season and 13% from its second season. In the third season, the show was regularly beaten in the Sunday night ratings by ABC&#x27;s &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; and CBS&#x27;s &quot;Cold Case&quot;. On February 2, 2005, NBC reduced the number of third-season episodes of &quot;American Dreams&quot; from 19 to 17. The network also moved the program away from its original Sunday night timeslot to Wednesday nights, airing before &quot;The West Wing&quot;. This put the show up against CBS&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Lost&quot;, and &quot;American Dreams&quot; could not compete against these popular programs.

As the third season wound down, actors on the show filmed pilots for new shows to possibly air in the 2005–06 television season. Fans of &quot;American Dreams&quot; organized a campaign to save the show, sending over 5000 supportive e-mails to NBC after the season finale and several thousand postcards to the network as well. On May 4, 2005, fans flew an aerial banner over NBC&#x27;s Burbank studios in support of the show, even as the show&#x27;s sets were being dismantled at Sunset-Gower Studios, where it was filmed.

It had been reported that &quot;American Dreams&quot; may have been canceled as early as December 2004. Jonathan Prince mentioned in a &quot;Miami Herald&quot; article that he was able to get four additional episodes made by having companies such as Kraft and Nabisco pay for additional episodes in exchange for product placement (Campbell&#x27;s Soups and Ford also participated in product placement episodes).

==Series epilogue==
&quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; reported on April 12, 2005, that in late February, NBC ordered two endings filmed for the season finale. The un-aired ending was reported to be a 12-minute segment set on July 20, 1969 (the day Apollo 11 landed on the Moon), with Meg returning home to face her family after a three-year absence.

NBC opted not to air the 12-minute epilogue when the third-season finale aired on March 30, 2005, a month and a half before the official cancellation of the series. &quot;TV Guide&quot; reported on July 26, 2005, that this epilogue was likely to air in a rerun of the third-season finale in August or September, but the airing never materialized. NBC was unable to attract sponsorship for the segment, which reportedly contained many rock-and-roll oldies, resulting in expensive music licensing fees for the network.

During the second annual ATX Television Festival on June 9, 2013, the cast and crew of the show were reunited, and creator Jonathan Prince unveiled for the first time to both the cast and audience, a rough cut of the never-before-seen epilogue.

In the epilogue, a long-haired Meg is seen on a bus (with a caption reading &quot;Three Years Later&quot;). After a couple of fellow hippie travelers inquire about the purpose of her trip, Meg reveals that she&#x27;s planning to attend Woodstock with Sam (who had just graduated from college), and has traveled upstate early in order to meet up with him. Meg also reveals that she still lives in Berkeley, and hasn&#x27;t been back home since she left with Chris three years prior. Meg is also planning on staying in New York with Roxanne, who is now married to Luke and has a baby boy named Dustin. Meg later reveals that Patty has graduated from high school and is now attending college at Harvard&#x27;s sister school, Radcliffe. Throughout her time on the bus (and her conversation with the hippies), Meg reflects on her experiences with her family and friends.

After the hippies leave, Meg is seen pensively staring out of the bus window. The next moment, Meg is standing outside of her former home in Philadelphia, having taken a detour from heading to New York. She runs into her nephew Trip (who is now much older), who tells her that he knows who she is (based on family photos). When asked, she tells him that she came because she wanted to see her family. Trip tells her that everyone is inside, watching the first crewed Moon landing (placing the epilogue on July 20, 1969, the day Apollo 11 landed on the Moon). Tripp reveals that JJ now has a job building space suits for astronauts. Suddenly, Jack (Meg&#x27;s father) comes out and calls for Trip to come in, when he sees Meg. Trip goes inside, and Helen (Meg&#x27;s mother) comes outside calling for Jack, but stops when she sees Meg.

An awkward silence passes among the three, until Jack invites Meg inside for leftovers. Jack enters the house as Meg walks up and grabs Helen in a hug, while Jack looks on from inside. Once everyone goes inside, the scene pans out, with Neil Armstrong&#x27;s famous moon landing address providing a voiceover until the screen goes black.

==Fourth season plotlines==
In interviews, Jonathan Prince revealed that if &quot;American Dreams&quot; had been renewed for a fourth season, the following plotlines would have been included.
* The fourth season would have picked up in January 1967.
* Meg would have returned to Philadelphia six episodes into the season after JJ goes to California with intentions to take her home.
* Roxanne would have taken a job as the hairdresser for &quot;American Bandstand&quot;.
* Jack would become angry after discovering that Helen had been using her job as a travel agent to help young men dodge the draft and flee to Canada.
* There would be tension in JJ and Beth&#x27;s marriage, after Beth reluctantly agreed to JJ&#x27;s wishes to postpone going back to college.
* Henry would remarry and accept a new, deaf stepson into his home.
* JJ would continue working for the company designing spacesuits for the crewed mission to the moon.
* The Apollo 1 fire would somehow figure into the fourth season plotline.
* Patty would serve as the Team Manager for the East Catholic football team.

==Special guests==
During the show&#x27;s run, several contact artists recreated performances of artists from the 1960s. These recreations were often performed on the &quot;American Bandstand&quot; stage, although several performances took place at a performing area adjacent to the Vinyl Crocodile record store. In the second and third seasons, several of the recreations took place at The Lair, a coffee house/student union facility on the University of Pennsylvania campus.

==Accuracy==

Despite its popularity as a family drama, &quot;American Dreams&quot; was heavily criticized for its various levels of historical inaccuracy. Several historic events were restaged earlier or later in the show&#x27;s timeline to fit a plotline, and some of the music and pop culture references do not match up with either historic fact or the show&#x27;s current timeline. Several arguments between the show&#x27;s loyal fanbase can be traced to whether the show should be viewed as a chronologically accurate representation of life in 1960s Philadelphia, or is instead an idealized combination of mnemonic images and pop culture references from points throughout the 1960s, much as the film &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot; was for the 1980s.

Some examples of these disputes include:
* A running plotline is the appearance of Meg and Roxanne as dancers on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, which still tapes a daily after-school show in Philadelphia; where in real life the show moved to Los Angeles in February 1964 and was only broadcast once a week, on Saturday afternoons (in real life, the studio used for &quot;Bandstand&quot; was later appropriated by the stations of public broadcasting operation WHYY after WFIL&#x27;s donation of them shortly after moving to their new City Avenue studios).
* In the pilot episode, Jack makes a reference to Ara Parseghian and Notre Dame. The pilot was set in November 1963 while Parseghian was hired by Notre Dame in December.
* In the first year, JJ Pryor Jr supposedly attended Lehigh University on a football scholarship in 1963 but joined the Marines when injured to pay for college. Lehigh doesn&#x27;t have athletic scholarships but gives financial grants in aid instead. Thus he would have still had financial aid even if injured.
* The Philadelphia 1964 race riot depicted in the first-season finale started at night, not in the daytime, as depicted in the show. Television footage of the riots shown on the episode actually came from the Watts riots of 1965 Los Angeles.
* During the show&#x27;s first season, the music of several artists, such as the Kinks, Dusty Springfield and Manfred Mann, are heard and referenced in 1963, months before the Beatles&#x27; appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; (February 1964) that triggered the musical British Invasion.
* When the Beatles appear on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, the scene is set up so that the first song the Beatles play is &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, which was the Beatles&#x27; first American hit, but was not the first song played on &quot;Ed Sullivan&quot; (that honor goes to &quot;All My Loving&quot;).
* In one episode in the show&#x27;s third season, set in late November 1965, the East Coast Blackout and the Leonid meteor shower were both &quot;rescheduled&quot; so that they would fall on the same day that Beth Mason gave birth to JJ Pryor&#x27;s son.
* In a first-season episode, Meg and Roxanne gush over meeting the group Jay and the Americans, and Roxanne is especially enamored with &quot;Carl, the drummer&quot; (the group neither had a member named Carl, nor a drummer, in real life). Also in real life, there were two lead singers known as &quot;Jay&quot; – Jay Traynor, who sang on their hit &quot;She Cried&quot;, and Jay Black, who replaced Traynor for the group&#x27;s other hits — yet on the episode, it is assumed that there was only one &quot;Jay&quot; who sang all the hits without interruption.
* In the show&#x27;s first season, set in November 1963, Meg Pryor and Luke Foley argue over the merits of Bob Dylan, and Luke hands Meg a 45 of Dylan singing &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man.&quot; In fact, Dylan did not write or perform the song until 1964, and he never released it on a commercial 45 (it appeared on his &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; album released in early 1965), although the Byrds&#x27; rendition of it was a hit single. Note that before Luke hands meg the Dylan record, he specifically says that it is &quot;an advanced copy of the record that won&#x27;t be released until next year.&quot;
* References are made in the show&#x27;s second season to I Dream of Jeannie, which was still a year away from premiering. On top of that, &quot;the big band theme song&quot; heard, is the one introduced at the beginning of the show&#x27;s second season (which was a re-creation of the original theme). It was performed &amp; produced by LA guitarist Rick Fleishman, and it also featured LA session drummer Paul Goldberg. (It&#x27;s the one most viewers were familiar with in 1966).
* The Monkees perform on the &quot;Bandstand&quot; stage in January 1966, despite their television series not even premiering until September 1966, or the four actors playing the Monkees even performing a live concert until a year later.
* In an episode set in January/February 1965, Nancy Sinatra (Jennifer Love Hewitt) appears on American Bandstand to sing &quot;These Boots are Made for Walking&quot; despite the fact the song was not released until 1966.
* While working at the space suit company, JJ Pryor meets Gus Grissom, and they discuss the Apollo 1 mission. Grissom later says, &quot;Get me back to Cape Canaveral.&quot; In reality, the Apollo 1 mission was not designated by that number or name until after the accident that claimed the lives of Grissom and two other astronauts (at the time the mission was known as Apollo/Saturn 204), and the reference to Cape Canaveral would have been wrong, as the area where the space center was located had been renamed &quot;Cape Kennedy&quot; during the 1960s. While the town was officially renamed back to Cape Canaveral in 1973, the space center was (and still is) known as the Kennedy Space Center, and at least three years had passed since the town was renamed from Cape Canaveral to Cape Kennedy; so although it is not impossible that in a casual conversation Grissom would have used the traditional name, it is still unlikely that this would happen.
* Artists such as Blake Shelton, John Ondrasik and Joss Stone are allowed to perform their current pop hits, which in real time would have been 40 years away from ever existing.
* Neither The Who nor Ricky Nelson ever performed on the &quot;Bandstand&quot; stage in real life (Nelson&#x27;s father Ozzie refused to allow his performing son to appear on anybody else&#x27;s TV series, even if such appearance might help increase record sales); but that didn&#x27;t stop the producers from staging performances by those artists in this series.
* The Who is shown performing on Bandstand in the show&#x27;s third season, set in 1965–1966. However The Who&#x27;s first performance in the United States wasn&#x27;t until the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967.
* In an episode that is supposedly taking place in the spring of 1965, two customers at the TV store, played by &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; actors John Aniston and Frances Reid, were watching an episode of &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; on a TV (Frances was watching herself on an early episode). &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; did not premiere until November 8, 1965.
* In an episode purporting to take place in the summer of 1966, a character on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; is asked to rate the Rolling Stones&#x27; song &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot;, despite the song being over a year old.
* In a late third-season episode, Meg, Roxanne and Luke sit outside Connie Mack Stadium with lawn chairs, listening for free to the Rolling Stones, who are playing a live concert at the stadium. Luke makes a reference that he heard a Bob Dylan concert at Connie Mack Stadium for free this way. Bob Dylan did not play Connie Mack Stadium as an outdoor venue in 1966 or earlier.
* In another third-season episode that takes place in June 1966, the Mamas and the Papas appear on American Bandstand to perform &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot;. However, the Mamas and Papas actual appearance on the show was in February 1966, they did not appear again in June of that year.
* Characters are depicted as listening to Cream&#x27;s &quot;I Feel Free&quot; and The Spencer Davis Group&#x27;s &quot;Gimme Some Lovin&#x27;&quot; as early as the summer of 1965, despite neither song being released until late in 1966, after the timeline of the series had ended.
* Another is Nathan Walker, Henry&#x27;s nephew and Chris Pierce, Meg&#x27;s boyfriend both say they were drafted to Vietnam in 1965 and 1966, however the first Vietnam Draft wasn&#x27;t held until December 1, 1969. It was a big deal at the time and it was watched live on TV. *The draft existed since W.W.2 you are talking about the lottery where each day of the year was assigned a number on ping pong balls and picked at random. so they could have been drafted to go to Vietnam any time in the 60&#x27;s
* JJ Pryor enlists in the Marines and goes to Vietnam in 1964, however President Johnson did not order the first deployment of Marines (the 9th Marine Expeditionary Brigade) until March 8, 1965.

==Home media==
The first season of &quot;American Dreams&quot; was released on DVD in September 2004. As of January no formal release dates have been announced for the remaining two seasons. Prince has promised that the series epilogue will appear in the third-season DVD release. However, it is widely believed that the huge number of licensed songs on the series make future DVD releases cost prohibitive, although Prince said that was not the case.

On January 26, 2009, it was reported that Prince and other producers from the show were negotiating to get the final two seasons released on DVD, along with including the unaired epilogue.
 No recent news was made until June 21, 2010, where it was reported that the producers &quot;are closer than ever to debuting a boxed set of all three seasons of &quot;American Dreams&quot; on DVD&quot;. However, negotiations seem to have stalled, with negotiations continuing as of early 2013.

At the second annual ATX Television Festival on June 9, 2013, Prince spoke out on the hold-up on the home media release of seasons 2 and 3, admitting that because of costly music licensing issues, it was unlikely that NBC would find it cost-effective to make those licensing deals unless fans campaigned to prove that the DVDs would sell, suggesting a Kickstarter campaign to gauge interest.

There are music alterations in the Season 1 DVD release in order to keep music licensing costs down. Prince has noted that the first season retains about &quot;80% of the original music&quot;, keeping music he deemed critical to particular scenes, as well as performances of guest stars and music for the Bandstand dancers while replacing some background songs with &quot;cheaper needle-drops&quot; from the 1960s. Prince said he doubted even hard-core fans would notice the difference.

==Soundtrack==
On May 6, 2003, Hip-O Records released &quot;American Dreams — Original Soundtrack 1963–1964&quot;, with original and new recordings featured in the show&#x27;s first season.
==Broadcasts==

&quot;American Dreams&quot; was shown for three years on NBC from 2002 to 2005. The first two seasons were shown in the United Kingdom (on the Hallmark Channel and Trouble), in Denmark (TV2), in Brazil (Sony Entertainment Television) and in Poland (TV Puls).

<doc id="1023616" wikidata="Q5589693" url="?curid=1023616" title="Governor of Nuevo León">
<text>The Mexican state of Nuevo León has been governed by more than a hundred individuals in its history, who have had various titles and degrees of responsibility depending on the prevailing political regime of the time.

Under the current regime, executive power rests in a governor, who is directly elected by the citizens, using a secret ballot, to a six-year term with no possibility of reelection. The position is open only to a Mexican citizen by birth, at least 30 years old with at least five years of residency in Nuevo León.

The governor&#x27;s term begins on October 4 and finishes six years later on October 3. Elections occur 3 years before/after presidential elections.

<doc id="1023623" wikidata="Q44376" url="?curid=1023623" title="Invincible (Michael Jackson album)">
<text>Invincible is the tenth and final studio album by the American singer Michael Jackson, released on October 30, 2001, by Epic Records. It was Jackson&#x27;s last album before his death in 2009. It features appearances from Carlos Santana, the Notorious B.I.G., Fats, and Slash. It incorporates R&amp;B, pop and soul, and similarly to Jackson&#x27;s previous material, the album explores themes such as love, romance, isolation, media criticism, and social issues. 

The album&#x27;s creation was expensive and laborious, featuring the work of ten record producers and over 100 musicians. Jackson started the multi-genre production in 1997 and did not finish until eight weeks before the album&#x27;s release. It was reported that it cost $30 million to record; as of July 2024, it remains the most expensive album ever made. Jackson refused to tour to support it, adding to the growing rift between him and Sony Music Entertainment. In July 2002, following Sony&#x27;s decision to abruptly end promotion for the album, Jackson alleged that the CEO of Sony Music, Tommy Mottola, was a &quot;devil&quot; and a racist who used his African American artists only for personal gain.

&quot;Invincible&quot; debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart and also reached number one in thirteen other countries worldwide. It was certified double platinum in the US in January 2002. The lead single, &quot;You Rock My World&quot;, reached number ten on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was nominated for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 2002 Grammy Awards. &quot;Cry&quot; was also released as a single, and &quot;Speechless&quot; and &quot;Butterflies&quot; were released as promotional singles.

&quot;Invincible&quot; received mixed reviews and became Jackson&#x27;s most critically derided album. Retrospective reviews have been more positive, and it has been credited as featuring early examples of dubstep. Sales of &quot;Invincible&quot; are estimated at 8 and 10 million copies, according to different sources. In 2009, it was voted by online readers of &quot;Billboard&quot; as the best album of the 2000s decade.

==Production==
Prior to the release of &quot;Invincible&quot;, Jackson had not released any new material since the remix album &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix&quot; in 1997; his last studio album was &quot;&quot; (1995). &quot;Invincible&quot; was therefore viewed as Jackson&#x27;s &quot;career comeback&quot;.

Jackson began recording new material in October 1997, and finished with &quot;You Are My Life&quot; being recorded only eight weeks before the album&#x27;s release in October 2001 – the most extensive recording of Jackson&#x27;s career. The tracks with Rodney Jerkins were recorded at the Hit Factory in Miami, Florida. Jackson had shown interest in including a rapper on at least one song, and had said that he did not want a &quot;known rapper&quot;. Jackson&#x27;s spokesperson suggested a New Jersey rapper named Fats; after Jackson heard the finished product of the song, the two agreed to record another song together for the album.

Rodney Jerkins stated that Jackson was looking to record material in a different musical direction than his previous work, describing the new direction as &quot;edgier&quot;. Jackson received credit for both writing and producing a majority of the songs on &quot;Invincible&quot;. Aside from Jackson, the album features productions by Jerkins, Teddy Riley, Andre Harris, Andraeo &quot;Fanatic&quot; Heard, Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds, R. Kelly and Dr. Freeze Bill Gray and writing credits from Kelly, Fred Jerkins III, LaShawn Daniels, Nora Payne and Robert Smith. The album is the third collaboration between Jackson and Riley, the other two being &quot;Dangerous&quot; and &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix&quot;. &quot;Invincible&quot; is Jackson&#x27;s tenth and final studio album to have been recorded and released during his lifetime. It reportedly cost $30 million to make the album, making it the most expensive album ever made.

&quot;Invincible&quot; was dedicated to the fifteen-year-old Afro-Norwegian boy Benjamin &quot;Benny&quot; Hermansen who was stabbed to death by a group of neo-Nazis in Oslo, Norway, in January 2001. The reason for this tribute was partly due to the fact that another Oslo youth, Omer Bhatti, Jackson&#x27;s friend, was also a good friend of Hermansen. The dedication in the album reads, &quot;Michael Jackson gives &#x27;special thanks&#x27;: This album is dedicated to Benjamin &#x27;Benny&#x27; Hermansen. May we continue to remember not to judge a man by the color of his skin, but the content of his character. Benjamin ... we love you ... may you rest in peace.&quot; The album is also dedicated to Nicholette Sottile and Jackson&#x27;s parents, Joseph and Katherine Jackson.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Invincible&quot; is an R&amp;B, pop and soul record. The album&#x27;s full length lasts over 77 minutes and contains 16 songs – fourteen of which were written (or co-written) by Jackson. It was noted that the album shifts between aggressive songs and ballads. &quot;Invincible&quot; opens with &quot;Unbreakable&quot;; the last line in the first verse recites the lyrics, &quot;With all that I&#x27;ve been through/I&#x27;m still around&quot;. In a 2002 interview with the magazine &quot;Vibe&quot;, Jackson commented on his inspiration for writing &quot;Speechless&quot;, saying:

&quot;Privacy&quot;, a reflection on Jackson&#x27;s own personal experiences, is about media invasions and tabloid inaccuracies. &quot;The Lost Children&quot; is about imperiled children. Jackson sings in a third person in &quot;Whatever Happens&quot;. The song&#x27;s lyrics, described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine as having a &quot;jagged intensity&quot;, narrate the story of two people involved in an unnamed threatening situation. &quot;Invincible&quot; features four ballads: &quot;You Are My Life&quot;, &quot;Butterflies&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Walk Away&quot; and &quot;Cry&quot;. &quot;Cry&quot;, similar to Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot;, is about healing the world together. The lyrics to &quot;Butterflies&quot; and &quot;Break of Dawn&quot; were viewed as &quot;glaringly banal&quot; and it was implied that they could have been written by anyone. &quot;Threatened&quot; was viewed as being a storyteller. The song was viewed as a &quot;Thriller redux&quot;. The song &quot;You Are My Life&quot; is about Jackson&#x27;s two children at the time, Prince and Paris. The song features Jackson singing, &quot;You are the sun, you make me shine, more like the stars.&quot;

==Singles==
The album spawned two official singles (&quot;You Rock My World&quot; and &quot;Cry&quot;) and three promotional singles (&quot;Speechless&quot;, &quot;Butterflies&quot; and &quot;Unbreakable&quot;), although all were given limited releases. &quot;You Rock My World&quot; was only released to radio airplay in the United States, consequently only peaking at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Internationally, where it was released as a commercial single, it reached number one in France, number two in Norway, Finland, Denmark, Belgium, and the United Kingdom, number three in Italy, number four in Australia, and five in Sweden and Switzerland. The second single, &quot;Cry&quot;, was not released in the United States. It was only moderately successful, with the song&#x27;s most successful territories being Spain, Denmark, France, and Belgium, charting at number six, sixteen, thirty and thirty-one.

&quot;Butterflies&quot; was only released in the United States to radio airplay. It reached number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and at number two for five weeks on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles Chart. &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; also charted at the bottom of the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Charts, at number 72 due to radio airplay without an official release; the song did not chart internationally. &quot;Unbreakable&quot; was originally supposed to be released as a single, but it was ultimately cancelled, being issued as a promotional single only. Despite that, the song managed to chart inside the Romanian Top 100 chart, peaking at number 62. It was later included on &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot; box set in 2004.

== Promotion ==
It was reported that the album had a budget of twenty five million dollars set aside for promotion. Despite this, however, due to the conflicts between Jackson and his record label, little was done to promote the album. Unlike with Jackson&#x27;s post-&quot;Thriller&quot; studio albums, there was no world tour to promote the album; a tour was planned, but cancelled due to conflicts between Jackson and Sony, and the September 11 attacks (the latter of which had also motivated many other artists to cancel their then-upcoming concerts in late 2001 and early 2002.) There was, however, a special 30th Anniversary Celebration at Madison Square Garden in early September 2001 to mark Jackson&#x27;s 30th year as a solo artist. Jackson performed &quot;You Rock My World&quot; and marked his first appearance onstage alongside his brothers since the Jacksons&#x27; Victory Tour in 1984. The show also featured performances by Britney Spears, Mýa, Usher, Whitney Houston, Tamia, Backstreet Boys, &#x27;N Sync, 98 Degrees, and Slash, among other artists. The show aired on CBS in November 2001 as a two-hour television special and was watched by 45 million viewers according to Nielsen.

The album&#x27;s promotion was met with trouble due to internal conflicts with Sony Music Entertainment and Jackson due to his part of ownership with the company and the contract to a deal with Sony that was originally signed back in 1991. The issue stemmed back during the production of &quot;Invincible&quot; when Jackson learned that the rights to the masters of his past releases, which were to revert to him in the early 2000s, would not revert to him until much later in the decade. When Jackson consulted the lawyer who worked with him in making the deal back in 1991, he learned that the same lawyer was also working for Sony, revealing a conflict of interest of which Jackson was never aware. Not wanting to sign away his ownership in Sony Music Entertainment, Jackson elected to leave the company shortly after the album&#x27;s release. After the announcement, Sony halted promotion on the album, cancelling single releases, including a 9/11 charity single that was intended to be released before &quot;Invincible&quot;.

In July 2002, following Sony&#x27;s decision to abruptly end promotion for the album, Jackson alleged that the CEO of Sony Music, Tommy Mottola, was a &quot;devil&quot; and a racist who used his African American artists only for personal gain. He accused Sony and the record industry of racism, deliberately not promoting or actively working against promotion of his album. Sony disputed claims that they had failed to promote &quot;Invincible&quot; with sufficient energy, maintaining that Jackson refused to tour in the United States.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Invincible&quot; received mixed reviews from professional critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received a mixed score of 51 based on 19 reviews. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, felt that &quot;Invincible&quot; is Jackson&#x27;s &quot;first album since &quot;Off the Wall&quot; that offers virtually no new twists&quot; and stated that the album &quot;feels like an anthology of his less-than-greatest hits&quot;.

James Hunter of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critiqued that the album&#x27;s later ballads made the record too long. Hunter also commented that Jackson and Riley made &quot;Whatever Happens&quot; &quot;something really handsome and smart&quot;, allowing listeners &quot;to concentrate on the track&#x27;s momentous rhythms&quot; such as &quot;Santana&#x27;s passionate interjections and Lubbock&#x27;s wonderfully arranged symphonic sweeps&quot;. Mark Beaumont of &quot;NME&quot; called it &quot;a relevant and rejuvenated comeback album made overlong&quot;, while &quot;Blender&quot; also found it &quot;long-winded&quot;.

Reviewing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau said that despite being overlooked, Jackson&#x27;s &quot;skills seem undiminished [and...] he&#x27;s doing new stuff with them--his funk is steelier and his ballads are airier, both to disquieting effect.&quot; He described the album&#x27;s first three tracks as being the &quot;Rodney Jerkins of the year&quot;. Nikki Tranter of &quot;PopMatters&quot; said that it is both innovative and meaningful because exceptional songs such as &quot;The Lost Children&quot; and &quot;Whatever Happens&quot; more than make up for overly sentimental songs like &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; and &quot;You Are My Life&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; magazine said that it is an aurally interesting, albeit inconsistent, album.

In a negative review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jon Pareles suggested that the album is somewhat impersonal and humorless, as Jackson rehashes ideas from his past songs and is &quot;so busy trying to dazzle listeners that he forgets to have any fun.&quot; In a retrospective review for &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Pareles said that &quot;Invincible&quot; showed Jackson had lost his suave quality to &quot;grim calculation&quot;.

&quot;Invincible&quot; received one Grammy Award nomination at the 2002 ceremony. The album&#x27;s song &quot;You Rock My World&quot; was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Performance – Male, but lost to James Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Lonely Tonight&quot;. Due to the album&#x27;s release in October 2001, it was not eligible for any other nomination from the 2002 Grammy Awards.

=== Retrospective reviews ===
In retrospective reviews, &quot;Invincible&quot; has gained more positive reviews and the track &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; has been cited as an early development of dubstep. Jackson later admitted to have been very proud of &quot;Invincible&quot;:&quot;It is tough because you’re competing against yourself. &quot;Invincible&quot; is just as good or better than &quot;Thriller&quot;, in my true, humble opinion. It has more to offer.&quot;

Producer Rodney Jerkins also give his thoughts about the album: &quot;There&#x27;s stuff we didn&#x27;t put on the album that I wish was on the album. My first batch [of beats] is what I really wanted him to do. I was trying to really go vintage, old school Mike. And that&#x27;s what a lot of my first stuff was, that I was presenting to him. He kept &#x27;Rock My World&#x27;. But he wanted to go more futuristic. So I would find myself at like junkyards, and we&#x27;d be out hitting stuff, to create our sound.
I think &quot;Invincible&quot; needs to be re-released. Because something happened at the record company [Sony] that caused them not to promote it no more after we put our heart and soul in it. He had about five singles on the album. But it came down to who can stop who [&quot;sic&quot;]. And he was caught up in that mess.&quot;

AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented that it has a &quot;spark&quot; and &quot;sound[s] better than anything Jackson has done since &quot;Dangerous&quot;.&quot; Erlewine noted that while the album had good material it was &quot;not enough to make &quot;Invincible&quot; the comeback Jackson needed – he really would have had to have an album that sounded free instead of constrained for that to work – but it does offer a reminder that he can really craft good pop.&quot; Writing for &quot;PopDose&quot;, Mike Heyliger wrote &quot;&quot;Invincible&quot; isn&#x27;t the piece of shit most claim it to be. A leaner structure to the album and more sympathetic production would have resulted in a classic. But when measured against the radio junk that passes for pop-R&amp;B these days, &quot;Invincible&quot; is stronger than ever.&quot; In December 2009, readers of &quot;Billboard&quot; voted &quot;Invincible&quot; the best album of the 2000s.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Invincible&quot; was Jackson&#x27;s first studio album since &quot;HIStory&quot; six years earlier. It debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with first-week sales of 363,000 units. It was Jackson&#x27;s fifth &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 number-one, and his fourth solo album to chart at number one in its first week; however, it sold less than &quot;HIStory&quot; in its opening week, which sold 391,000 units. In its second week, the album slipped to number 3 selling 202,000 copies with a 45% drop. &quot;Invincible&quot; also charted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B/Hip Hop Albums Chart for four weeks. After eight weeks of release, in December 2001, &quot;Invincible&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for the sales of five hundred thousand units. In the same month, the album was certified platinum for the sale of one million units. On January 25, 2002, it was certified two times platinum for the sales of two million units. In the United States, it was the 45th best-selling album of 2001 selling over 1.56 million units. As of 2009, Invincible had sold 2.4 million copies in the United States.

&quot;Invincible&quot; left the Billboard 200 in June 2002 after charting there for 28 weeks. Shortly after the release of the album, in a poll conducted by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, &quot;an overwhelming majority&quot; of people—79% of 5,195 voters—were not surprised by &quot;Invincible&quot; entering the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number one. &quot;Billboard&quot; also reported that 44% agreed with the statement, proclaiming that Jackson was &quot;still the King of Pop&quot;. Another 35% said they were not surprised by the album&#x27;s ranking, but doubted &quot;Invincible&quot; would hold on for a second week at the top of the chart. Only 12% of people who responded to the poll said they were surprised by the album&#x27;s charting debut because of Jackson&#x27;s career over the past six years and another 9% were taken aback by the album&#x27;s success, in light of the negativity that preceded the album&#x27;s release.

&quot;Invincible&quot; reached number one in 14 countries worldwide, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. It also charted within the top ten in several countries, including Austria, Japan, Italy, New Zealand, and Spain.

&quot;Invincible&quot; was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry, for the sales of over 300,000 units in the United Kingdom. The album was certified platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) for the sales of 40,000 units in Switzerland. The IFPI also certified the album gold in Austria for the sales of 15,000 units. Australian Recording Industry Association certified &quot;Invincible&quot; two times platinum for the sales of 140,000 units in Australia. &quot;Invincible&quot; was the eleventh best-selling album of 2001 according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry with 5.4 million copies. According to different sources the album sold 8 million, or even 10 million copies worldwide.

Following Jackson&#x27;s death on June 25, 2009, his music experienced a surge in popularity. &quot;Invincible&quot; charted at number twelve on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Digital Albums Chart on July 11, 2009. Having not charted on the chart prior to its peak position, the album was listed as the ninth biggest jump on that chart that week. It also charted within the top ten, peaking at number nine, on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Catalog Albums Chart on the issue date of July 18. On the week of July 19, 2009, &quot;Invincible&quot; charted at number eighteen in Italy. &quot;Invincible&quot; peaked at number sixty-four on the European Albums Chart on the charts issue date of July 25. The album also charted at number twenty-nine in Mexico on July, and eighty-four on the Swiss Albums Chart on July 19, 2009.

<doc id="1023624" wikidata="Q898244" url="?curid=1023624" title="Volumetric flask">
<text>A volumetric flask (measuring flask or graduated flask) is a piece of laboratory apparatus, a type of laboratory flask, calibrated to contain a precise volume at a certain temperature. Volumetric flasks are used for precise dilutions and preparation of standard solutions. These flasks are usually pear-shaped, with a flat bottom, and made of glass or plastic. The flask&#x27;s mouth is either furnished with a plastic snap/screw cap or fitted with a joint to accommodate a PTFE or glass stopper. The neck of volumetric flasks is elongated and narrow with an etched ring graduation marking. The marking indicates the volume of liquid contained when filled up to that point. The marking is typically calibrated &quot;to contain&quot; (marked &quot;TC&quot; or &quot;IN&quot;) at 20 °C and indicated correspondingly on a label. The flask&#x27;s label also indicates the nominal volume, tolerance, precision class, relevant manufacturing standard and the manufacturer&#x27;s logo. Volumetric flasks are of various sizes, containing from a fraction of a milliliter to hundreds of liters of liquid.

==Classes==

Calibration and toleration standards for volumetric flasks are defined in the following standard specifications and practices: ASTM E288, E542, E694, ISO 1042, and GOST 1770-74. According to these specifications, volumetric flasks come in two different classes. The higher standard flasks (Class A, Class 1, USP or equivalent depending on the country) are made with a more accurately placed graduation mark, and have a unique serial number for traceability. Where this is not required, a lower standard (Class B or equivalent) is used for qualitative or educational work.

==Modifications==

Volumetric flasks are generally colourless but may be amber-coloured for the handling of light-sensitive compounds such as silver nitrate or vitamin A.

A modification of the volumetric flask exists for dealing with large quantities of solids that are to be transferred into a volumetric vessel for dissolution. Such a flask has a wide mouth and is known as a &quot;Kohlrausch volumetric flask&quot;. This kind of volumetric flask is commonly used in analysis of the sugar content in sugar beets.

While conventional volumetric flasks have a single mark, industrial volumetric tests in analytical chemistry and food chemistry may employ specialized volumetric flasks with multiple marks to combine several accurately measured volumes.

A highly specialized kind of the volumetric flask is the &quot;Le Chatelier flask&quot; for use with the volumetric procedure in specific gravity determination.

<doc id="1023633" wikidata="Q1111707" url="?curid=1023633" title="Vsevolod Merkulov">
<text>Vsevolod Nikolayevich (Boris) Merkulov (; – 23 December 1953) was the head of NKGB from February to July 1941, and again from April 1943 to March 1946. He was a leading member of what was later derisively described as the &quot;Beria gang&quot;.

==Early life==
Merkulov was born in 1895 in Zagatala in present-day Azerbaijan. His Russian father and Georgian mother were both minor members of the nobility. His father, an army captain, was convicted of embezzlement around the year 1900, and died in 1908. In 1913, Vsevolod Merkulov graduated from the Tiflis Gymnasium with a gold medal and became a student at Saint Petersburg University, Department of Physics and Mathematics, but did not graduate. In 1916, he was drafted into the Russian Army. In 1918, he left the army and moved to Tiflis (Tbilisi), where for a time he was unemployed, then worked as a teacher. From September 1921, after the Red Army invasion of Georgia, he was enlisted in Cheka, and its successor, the GPU.

Merkulov first met Lavrentiy Beria in 1923, when Beria was 24 and had been made deputy chairman of the Georgian GPU. He owed his subsequent promotions to Beria&#x27;s patronage. He joined the Communist Party in 1925. From 1925 to 1931, he was Head of Secret Operations Directorate and Deputy Head of he GPU of Adzharistan. In 1931, he was made head of the Secret Political Department of the Transcaucasian GPU, but soon afterwards transferred to party work, when Beria was First Secretary of the Transcaucasian communist party. He wrote a pamphlet about Beria, entitled &quot;The Faithful Son of the Leninist–Stalinist Party&quot;. He was head of the Industry and Transport section of the Georgian CP Central Committee in 1936–38.
== Transfer to Moscow ==
Merkulov was transferred to Moscow in August 1938, shortly after Beria had been chosen by Stalin to take over control of the NKVD from Nikolai Yezhov. When Beria took over as head of the Main Directorate of State Security (GUGB) on 29 September 1938, he chose Merkulov as his deputy. In 1939, he was elected a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union

Merkulov interrogated Yefim Yevdokimov, an associate of Yezhov who had been under arrest for five months but had refused to cooperate. On 13 April 1939, Yevdokimov broke down and &#x27;confessed&#x27; to being part of the &#x27;Yezhov conspiracy&#x27;. At his trial, he said that he had confessed because he could not stand the pain of being beaten on his heels.

In February 1941, the NKVD was divided in two, and Merkulov was appointed Chairman of the NKGB. On 21 July 1941, his department was merged again with the NKVD, with Merkulov was Deputy People&#x27;s Commissar, under Beria. On 20 July 1943, two departments were separated again, and Merkulov was again head of the NKGB.

== War time ==
In September 1939, following the pact between the USSR and Nazi Germany, Merkulov was sent to Ukraine to supervise the incorporation of territory seized from Poland. On 28 September, he reported to Beria that 1,923 people had been arrested, most of whom were accused of being Ukrainian nationalists. When almost 22,000 Polish officers were executed in the famous Katyn massacre in spring 1940, Merkulov headed the &#x27;troika&#x27; who signed off the death sentences. Before it began, he visited the Belorussian soviet republic (Belarus) on 5 March, to check on progress in rounding up Poles trapped in the western part of the republic recently seized from Poland.

In May 1941, Merkulov was in charge of the pacification of the Baltic states, which were being forcibly incorporated in the USSR. On 17 June, he sent a reporting saying that he had had 14,467 people arrested in the three republics, and another 25,711 (mostly families of those arrested) evicted from their homes. It was calculated that in the short period before the German invasion, four percent of Estonia&#x27;s population, and 2 per cent of the populations of Latvia and Lithuania were deported.

=== The German invasion ===
In his role as head of foreign intelligence, Merkulov travelled with Molotov to Berlin in November 1940, to have breakfast with Hitler. He received warnings from well-placed agents that the Germans were planning to invade, but refused to believe them, telling one of his agents: &quot;You are greatly exaggerating.&quot; On 25 May 1941, he informed Stalin that Germany had 160–200 divisions concentrated on the Soviet border, but added that war was &quot;unlikely&quot; because &quot;Hitler cannot risk war with the USSR for fear of violating the unity of the Nazi Party.&quot;

After the German invasion, Merkulov was in charge of purging the Red Army of officers suspected of disloyalty, including Grigory Shtern who was hit with an electric cable that ripped out his right eye, in Merkulov&#x27;s office. Merkulov made the officer who struck the blow, Lev Shvartsman apologise – for causing blood to spill on the carpet. He also beat the arrested Red Army officers Kirill Meretskov and Boris Vannikov with a rubber truncheon, though when charged with this offence 12 years later, he claimed that the beatings did not amount to &#x27;torture&#x27;. On Stalin&#x27;s orders, he also kidnapped and killed the wife of Marshal Kulik.

=== Espionage ===
He was involved with a plan to build up a network of spies inside the Manhattan Project. The NKVD&#x27;s first success was the recruitment of Klaus Fuchs. The project was given the codename &quot;Enormoz&quot;. In November 1944, Pavel Fitin reported: Despite participation by a large number of scientific organization and workers on the problem of Enormoz in the U.S., mainly known to us by agent data, their cultivation develops poorly. Therefore, the major part of data on the U.S. comes from the station in England. On the basis of information from London station, Moscow Center more than once sent to the New York station a work orientation and sent a ready agent, too [Klaus Fuchs].

Another important source was John Cairncross. Fitin reported to Merkulov: Valuable information on Enormoz is coming from the London station. The first materials on Enormoz were received in late 1941 from our source List [John Cairncross], containing valuable and absolutely secret documents both on the substance of the Enormoz problem and on measures by the British government to organize and develop work on the problem of atomic energy in our country. In connection with American and Canadian work on Enormoz, materials describing the state and progress of work in three countries—England, the U.S., and Canada—are all coming from the London station.

During the war, Merkulov wrote a patriotic play &quot;Engineer Sergeyev&quot;, using the pseudonym Vsevolod Rokk.

== Post war ==
The author Nikolai Tolstoy, in his &quot;Victims of Yalta&quot; (1977), recounts Merkulov speaking to the imprisoned Cossack general Pyotr Krasnov in the Lubyanka in 1945. (The report is the testimony of the general&#x27;s son, Nikolai Krasnov, who was also present and later released from the Gulag under Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s 1955 amnesty.)
Sooner or later there will be a clash between the Communist Bear and the Western Bulldog. There will be no mercy for our sugar-coated, honey-dripping, wheedling, grovelling allies! We&#x27;ll blow them to blazes with all their kings, with all their traditions, lords, castles, heralds, Orders of the Bath and Garter, and their white wigs. When the Bear&#x27;s paw strikes, no-one will remain to nurse the hope that their gold can rule the world. Our healthy, socially strong young idea, the idea of Lenin and Stalin, will be the victor! ... When we roar they sit tight on their tails! I am told that there were Tsars who watered their horses in the Oder. Well, the time will come when we will water Soviet horses in the Thames!
== Dismissal, arrest and execution ==
On 4 May 1946, Merkulov was removed from his post as head of what was now the renamed Ministry of State Security. This was a setback for Beria, who lost control of the police apparatus to a younger rival, Viktor Abakumov, while Merkulov was unemployed for over a year. On 25 April 1947, he was appointed head of the main directorate for Soviet property abroad. On 27 October 1950, he was appointed Minister of State Control, replacing Lev Mekhlis.

In July 1953, after Beria was arrested, Merkulov was summoned by Nikita Khrushchev, the new head of the communist party, and ordered to write a report on his links with Beria. He wrote a long letter denouncing Beria as an ambitious schemer, but claiming that despite having known him for 30 years, Merkulov had only now realised that he was a criminal. Khrushchev wrote later: &quot;I admit that I held him in high regard and considered him a good party member. He was unquestionably a cultured person&quot; – but considered his report to be &quot;absolutely worthless. It was more like a piece of fiction ... To my deep regret, since I had trusted him, Merkulov turned out to be deeply implicated in some of Beria&#x27;s crimes.&quot;

Merkulov was tried in secret, with Beria and six others, in December 1953. &quot;Pravda&quot; reported on 14 December that he had been found guilty of &quot;many years of joint criminal activity&quot; with Beria, &quot;fulfilling many of Beria&#x27;s criminal missions&quot;, treason, terrorism, and &quot;participating in a counter-revolutionary, treacherous, conspiratorial group&quot;, for which he was sentenced to death, and shot.

<text>A pilot boat is a type of boat used to transport maritime pilots between land and the inbound or outbound ships that they are piloting. Pilot boats were once sailing boats that had to be fast because the first pilot to reach the incoming ship got the business. Today, pilot boats are scheduled by telephoning the ship agents/representatives prior to arrival.

==History==
Pilots and the work functions of the maritime pilot go back to Ancient Greece and Roman times, when incoming ships&#x27; captains employed locally experienced harbour captains, mainly local fishermen, to bring their vessels safely into port. Eventually, in light of the need to regulate the act of pilotage and ensure pilots had adequate insurance, the harbours themselves licensed pilots for each harbour.

Although licensed by the harbour to operate within their jurisdiction, pilots were generally self-employed, meaning that they had to have quick transport to get them from the port to the incoming ships. As pilots were often still dual-employed, they used their own fishing boats to reach the incoming vessels. But fishing boats were heavy working boats, and filled with fishing equipment, and so a new type of boat was required.

Early boats were developed from single masted cutters and twin masted yawls, and latterly into the specialist pilot cutter. These were effectively light-weight and over-powered single-masted boats with large, steeply angled keels, making them deep draft under power and shallow draft in lighter sail.

If legend is to be believed, the first official Bristol Channel pilot was barge master George James Ray, appointed by the Corporation of Bristol in May 1497 to pilot John Cabot&#x27;s &quot;Matthew&quot; from Bristol harbour to the open sea beyond the Bristol channel. In 1837 Pilot George Ray guided Brunel&#x27;s &quot;SS Great Western,&quot; and in 1844 William Ray piloted the larger &quot;SS Great Britain&quot; on her maiden voyage.

==Use by country==
===United States===
In 1840, there were only eight New York pilot boats. They were the &quot;Phantom,&quot; No. 1; &quot;Washington,&quot; No. 2; &quot;New York,&quot; No. 3; &quot;Jacob Bell,&quot; No. 4; &quot;Blossom,&quot; No. 5; &quot;T. H. Smith,&quot; No. 6; &quot;John E. Davidson,&quot; No. 7; and the &quot;Virginia,&quot; No. 8.

In 1860 there were twenty-one New York pilot boats and four under the New Jersey dispensation.

In the spring of 1896, the New York and New Jersey pilots discarded pilot-boats and moved them to the Erie Basin in Brooklyn. They were for sale because of the change from wood and sail to steel and steam pilot boats.

===Great Britain===
In Great Britain, pilot boats were rigged as schooners in Fleetwood, Swansea and Liverpool. In Liverpool, the &quot;Pioneer,&quot; No. 6 was built in 1852 and was 53-tons. The clipper &quot;George Holt,&quot; No. 10 was built in 1892.

===India===
The Bengal Pilot Service was established by the British East India Company to control piloting. The pilot boats were responsible for guiding East Indiaman, and other vessels, up and down the Hooghly River between Calcutta and the sea.

==Some historic pilot boats still sailing==

* Eighteen Bristol Channel Pilot Cutters are believed to survive worldwide
* German pilot schooner, &quot;Elbe, No. 5&quot; was launched in 1883 and had a long history as pilot boat, as private yacht named &quot;Wander Bird&quot; and later as home to hippies in San Francisco, before returning to Germany and being restored as a traditional sailing boat
* German pilot schooner &quot;Cuxhaven&quot; was launched in 1901 and survived as a sailing boat, renamed &quot;Atalanta&quot; and still active as a traditional sail training ship
* US motorboat USS &quot;California&quot; was completed in 1910 and served in World War I on harbor patrol duty
* US two-masted gaff-rigged schooner &quot;Adventuress&quot; launched in 1913, saw service as a pilot boat, and during World War II served with the United States Coast Guard
* US two-masted gaff-rigged schooner &quot;Zodiac&quot; was built as a racing sailboat in 1924 and named &quot;California&quot; after being acquired by the San Francisco Bar Pilots Association for use as a pilot boat
* US schooner &quot;Roseway&quot;, built in 1925, owned by the Boston Pilot Association for thirty years until 1973, now a registered U.S. National Historic Landmark operating in Boston and St. Croix, USVI by World Ocean School, Camden, Maine
* US pilot-boat &quot;Moses H. Grinnell&quot; was built in 1850 and designed by George Steers. It was owned by George W. Blunt. In 1863, the &quot;Grinnell&quot; was hit by the steamer &quot;Union&quot; on the outer Middle Ground. The &quot;Grinnell&quot; was named after Moses H. Grinnell, a successful New York merchant and shipper.

The &quot;Zodiac&quot; and &quot;Adventuress&quot; are both listed with the National Register of Historic Places and are now cruising in Washington state after restorations.

==Modern pilot boats==
Modern pilot boats can be from 7 metres to over 25 metres () in length, built to withstand heavy seas and bumping against 100,000 ton tanker and cruise ships. They are high-powered and hence both very quick and durable purpose-built boats. They are normally painted a highly visible colour such as orange, red or yellow.

In terms of design, monohull hullforms are most commonly used, though examples of catamarans, SWATHs and Wave Piercing Hulls also exist. Although some pilot boats are still constructed from steel, the need to travel quickly means lighter weight materials such as aluminium, fibreglass and composites are now commonly used. In some instances, such as the Berkeley Class vessels produced in Australia, a combination of materials is used.

== Gallery ==
==Signalling==
Pilots identified pilot boats with a large number on the mainsail and by flying a large pilot flag, bisected vertically into two colours, usually white and blue, which added to the boat&#x27;s visibility. In distress, they would fire rockets and blue-lights at night. A brass signal gun was carried to be used when there was fog and sometimes on fair days.

Pilot boats are specially marked to indicate their function. During the day they fly the &quot;H&quot; flag and normally the word PILOT (or PILOTS) is written in clearly visible, large, letters on the sides.

At night they have special navigation lights: in addition to the &quot;normal&quot; navigation lights, a pilot boat has a white round light at top and below that a red round light, while a fishing vessel has the red light at top and the white light below.

To remember this, some people use the mnemonic &quot;white cap, red nose&quot; to reflect the idea that pilots consumed a lot of alcohol while waiting for ships, thus the white captain&#x27;s cap with a red nose below it.

Pilot boats often also use bright colours, like flashy yellow, to make them clearly visible and distinctive in even the worst conditions. This last mainly applies to the so-called pilot tenders: the vessels that go to the ships to bring the pilot on board of arriving ships or pick them up from departing ships. Depending on the local situation the tenders might be launched directly from a nearby harbour or they are coming from the central (large) pilot station: a pilot boat located at a pre-defined location at sea near a pilotage area. In earlier days nearly all pilots came from a &quot;pilot station&quot; at sea, but with the modern very fast tenders it is often more practical not to have a permanently manned pilot station at sea, but transfer the pilots directly to/from shore.

<text>Stuckey&#x27;s is a convenience store in the Southeast, Southwest, and Midwestern United States. It is known for its pecan log rolls and kitschy souvenirs . Additionally, Stuckey&#x27;s sells candy, apparel, souvenirs, and other products online. 

Stuckey&#x27;s Corporation is headquartered in Eastman, Georgia, and in 2021, purchased a pecan processing and candy making plant in Wrens, Georgia. The current CEO of Stuckey&#x27;s is Stephanie Stuckey, granddaughter of the brand&#x27;s founder W.S. Stuckey Sr.

==History==
===Early days===
In the 1930s, with a Model A Ford coupe borrowed from a friend and $35 borrowed from his grandmother, W.S. Stuckey Sr., drove around the Eastman, Georgia countryside buying pecans from local farmers and selling them to pecan processors. Stuckey made over $4,500 his first year in the pecan business.

By 1937, Stuckey was selling over $150,000 worth of pecans a year that he bought himself and sold to local processors. That same year, he opened a roadside stand along Highway 23 in Eastman selling pecans, sugar cane juice, syrup, homemade quilts, and “all you can drink for five-cents” cherry cider.

Business increased after Stuckey&#x27;s wife Ethel began making pecan pralines, after she came up with a recipe for pecan log rolls and added a secret ingredient, (maraschino cherries), to the mix. Business improved enough that Stuckey built his own store in Eastman, opening another store in Unadilla, Georgia soon after. Another soon followed in Hilliard, Florida with each Stuckey’s making their own candy on site.

Stuckey’s franchise expansion was slowed by World War II when Stuckey was forced to close his Unadilla branch. During the war, Stuckey managed to stay afloat after buying a candy making factory in Jacksonville, Florida and securing government contracts making candy for the troops.

After the war ended, Stuckey&#x27;s business once again began to grow as it opened a number of new franchises. The company then constructed its own candy factory in Eastman to supply an eventual 350-plus Stuckey&#x27;s stores located throughout the continental US. As the post-war baby boom flourished and families undertook more long-distance auto travel, Stuckey&#x27;s continued to grow along major highways.

===Downfall, then rise===
In the early 1960s, with over 368 stores across the country now filled with candy, novelty toys, and kitschy souvenirs, the franchise seemed to become something bigger than one man alone could handle. As a result, Stuckey sold his franchise to Pet, Inc., maker of &quot;Pet Milk&quot;. 

W.S. Stuckey Sr. died in 1977, the same year that Illinois Central Industries, a Chicago conglomerate, bought Pet Milk Co., and they began to close Stuckey’s stores across the country. By the end of the decade, only 75 original Stuckey’s stores remained.

In 1984, W.S. “Billy” Stuckey, Jr., son of the founder, repurchased Stuckey’s and began to turn the company around. Billy had a new idea for the company – Stuckey’s Express, a store-within-a-store concept that resulted in over 165 licensed Stuckey’s Express stores in 17 states.

Stuckey’s “comeback” really began taking off, however, after W.S. Stuckey Sr.’s granddaughter, Ethel “Stephanie” Stuckey took her life’s savings, bought the company from her father and became its CEO in November 2019.

In August 2020, Stuckey’s acquired Front Porch Pecans, a pecan snack company that sells to domestic and foreign markets, including grocery channels in the Southeast U.S. With this merger, Stuckey’s gained management support and co-owner, R.G. Lamar, who was named as new President to run Stuckey’s with Stephanie.

In January 2021, Stephanie and R.G. acquired Atwell Pecans, The Orchards Gourmet, and Thames corporations to add candy making, pecan processing, and fundraising businesses to the company’s portfolio. In this same year, Ted Wright invested in the company becoming the third co-owner. Ted is also the CEO of a word of mouth marketing and growth strategy company called &quot;Fizz&quot; and focuses on the marketing of all things Stuckey&#x27;s. 

Today, Stuckey’s has 65 licensed locations, a distribution center based in Eastman, a pecan and candy plant to make their own Stuckey’s products, an active online business, and some 200 retailers that sell Stuckey’s pecan snacks and candies in over 5,000 outlets.

<text>Peter Fortunate Vallone Sr. (born December 13, 1934) is an American politician.

== Background ==

His father, Judge Charles J. Vallone (1901–1967) of the Queens County Civil Court, encouraged young Peter to broaden his horizons beyond the limited social interactions with other ethnic and religious groups that were discouraged in the pre-Vatican II era. His mother, Leah Palmigiano Vallone, was a teacher and a Democratic State Committeewoman. With his wife, Tena, he has three children (Peter Jr., Paul, and Perry) and eight grandchildren.

== Education ==

He attended Fordham University, where he received his BSS (1956) and his LLB (1959).

==Political career==
A former Democratic New York City Councilman who represented Astoria, Queens, from 1974 to 2001, he was the second most powerful official in New York City&#x27;s government after the mayor, when he became the city&#x27;s first Speaker of the City Council in 1986. He held that position until Gifford Miller took over in 2002.

Vallone drafted changes to the City Charter in 1989 that he claimed allowed the Council more say on the budget.

He was an unsuccessful candidate for governor in 1998 as the Democratic nominee receiving in total 1,570,317 votes or 33.16% of the electorate. Vallone was also notably the first ever candidate endorsed by the Working Families Party, with the party receiving 51,325 votes for Vallone via fusion voting. Vallone also ran for mayor in 2001, placing third in the Democratic primary.

==Later career==
Vallone currently teaches political science at Baruch College and his autobiography, &quot;Learning to Govern: My Life in New York Politics, From Hell Gate to City Hall&quot;, described his years in government. He practices law in Astoria with his son, Peter Vallone Jr., who succeeded him in the City Council in 2002. After he retired from politics, Peter Vallone Sr. founded a lobbying firm with a partner, Constantinople and Vallone 

In 2005, Vallone endorsed Republican Michael Bloomberg for Mayor of New York City. In 2009, he endorsed a former rival in the mayoral race, Mark Green, who attempted to win back the job of Public Advocate.

<text>Bulgaria is a country in south-eastern Europe situated in the north-eastern part of the Balkan Peninsula. The country has a great variety of topographical features and diverse landscape ranging from the Alpine snow-capped peaks in Rila, Pirin and the Balkan Mountains to the mild and sunny Black Sea coast; from the typically continental Danubian Plain in the north to the strong Mediterranean climatic influence in the valleys of Macedonia and the lowlands in the southernmost parts of Thrace. The diverse morphological, climatic and hydrological conditions of Bulgaria favour the formation of a large number of geological features.

<text>SPAR, originally &quot;DESPAR&quot;, styled as &quot;DE SPAR&quot; (), is a Dutch multinational franchise that provides branding, supplies and support services for independently owned and operated food retail stores. It was founded in the Netherlands in 1932, by Adriaan van Well. 

Its headquarters are in Amsterdam. The company operates a partnership programme and has a presence in most European countries, as well as throughout Asia, Africa and Oceania.

In fiscal year 2022, SPAR earned €43.5 billion in global sales, which represented a 5.6 percent increase over the previous year.

By 2024, the group had 13,900 stores in 48 countries.

==Etymology==
The name was originally DESPAR, an acronym of the Dutch phrase , which was used by Van Well to describe the brand. The acronym was chosen to resonate with the verb , which (related to English &quot;&quot;) means &quot;save [money]&quot; in Dutch and some other languages, among them German and Scandinavian languages (with variants such as or ). is Dutch for &quot;spruce tree&quot;, after which the logo was chosen. As the organisation expanded across Europe, the name was abbreviated by dropping the &quot;DE&quot; prefix.

There are some international naming variants:
* In Hungary, 17 stores owned by SPAR located at Orlen (former Lukoil) filling stations operate under the name &quot;DESPAR&quot;. However, there are also many SPAR and INTERSPAR locations.
* In Italy, the name is still &quot;DESPAR&quot;, though in keeping with the international branding, the &quot;SPAR&quot; section of the logo is highlighted, and the larger shops are still called EuroSPAR and InterSPAR.
* In Austria, &quot;DESPAR&quot; is SPAR&#x27;s Italian food product range. There are also &quot;EUROSPAR&quot; and &quot;INTERSPAR&quot; locations within Austria.
* In Croatia, &quot;SPAR&quot; and &quot;INTERSPAR&quot; locations run concurrently.
*In Arabia, the Latin letters &quot;SPAR&quot; are displayed next to the Arabic ().
*In Iran, it is called ().
*In China, it is known as (, &quot;Siba supermarket&quot;).
*In Ireland, Northern Ireland, Russia and Switzerland both the SPAR and EUROSPAR names are used, with EUROSPAR being used mostly for larger supermarket sized stores and SPAR for smaller convenience stores.
*In Slovenia both SPAR and INTERSPAR are used, with INTERSPAR being used for a larger supermarket sized stores and SPAR for smaller convenience stores

==History==
=== 20th century ===
Spar was founded in 1932 in Zegwaart, Netherlands. In 1953, an International Spar office opened in Amsterdam to manage international expansion. Spar shops can be found in Europe, Australia, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Israel, Nigeria, South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mozambique, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, Cameroon, China, and India. Spar opened in Vanuatu on 1 December 2009, ending Au Bon Marché&#x27;s grocery monopoly.

A Spar shop may be owned independently, by a franchise, or be part of a chain, depending on the model applied in any given country. The owners of the parent company vary from country to country and may include the shop owners themselves. The name and the current logo was most recently revised in 1968 by Raymond Loewy and has since remained unchanged.

In the United Kingdom, Spar was founded in 1959 and may be a supermarket or a convenience shop. In 1997, Spar was introduced to most United Kingdom military bases by the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes (Naafi), where it sells a variety of civilian and military products. In Ireland and Northern Ireland, the Spar brand is known for neighbourhood shops and also the subformat Eurospar acting as mini-supermarkets.

Since 1996, the company has been a major sponsor of the European Athletic Association and its events.

Spar stores in the Netherlands are members of Superunie, an inventory purchasing organisation for a number of otherwise unaffiliated supermarket brands.

In 1988, SPAR South Africa became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tiger Brands, a holding company with a large diversified portfolio. It was unbundled and listed as a separate company in 2004.

=== 21st century ===

In 2015, Ahold acquired all 35 hypermarkets and 14 supermarkets from Spar Czechia for more than 5.2 billion Czech koruna. and converted them into Albert super- and hypermarkets. However, it had to divest itself of some shops in order not to have a monopoly.

The first SPAR shop in Oman was inaugurated in January 2015, in Muscat. Spar Oman had plans to open more shops over time as part of its expansion plans in Oman. Spar opened its first store in Qatar in 2017, with the second store opening in 2018. A further two stores were planned to open in 2018, but it got cancelled.

==Shop types==
In most, but not all countries, SPAR operates shops of different types and sub-brands: SPAR Express, SPAR Neighbourhood, EuroSPAR and InterSPAR.
=== EuroSPAR/SuperSPAR ===
The EuroSPAR name is used in Europe and SuperSPAR in South Africa. These are mid-sized supermarkets, designed to fit in a niche between convenience shops and traditional supermarkets.

=== InterSPAR ===
These are hypermarkets and compete directly against major international chains such as Carrefour, and Tesco.

=== KwikSPAR ===

KwikSPAR, only found in South Africa, is a smaller quick stop shop for convenience, larger than the conventional SPAR Express and smaller than the normal SPAR. These stores tend to have extended trading hours, some operating as 24-hour convenience stores.

=== HOT SPAR ===
HOT SPAR was a brand of convenience stores licensed to franchisees in Japan.

=== SPAR Express ===
This is the smallest type of shop. They are designed for small sites and filling station forecourts, airports and train stations.

=== SPAR Drive-Thru ===
There was a drive-through SPAR on the Cliftonville Road in Belfast, Northern Ireland. This has now been converted to a Centra shop, and retained the drive-through for a while afterwards, but now no longer has one.

=== SPAR Gourmet ===
The Austrian Spar Group has around 50 supermarkets branded SPAR Gourmet, mainly in and around Vienna. They are smaller supermarkets that specialize in foods, with a reduced range of other household goods. They originate from the acquisition of retail units from the Julius Meinl coffee and tea chain in 2000.

<doc id="1023716" wikidata="Q1432054" url="?curid=1023716" title="Monbetsu Airport">
<text>or , is a third class airport located southeast of Monbetsu, a city on the Sea of Okhotsk in Hokkaidō, Japan. The airport is 15 minutes from the city center and accessible by bus from the Monbetsu Bus Terminal.

==History==

MBE is the newest airport in Hokkaidō: it opened in November 1999. The airport was originally used for general aviation flights. Flights were transferred from the original Monbetsu Airport, which was located further from the city. Air Nippon inaugurated daily service to New Chitose Airport outside Sapporo that year, and added flights to Tokyo International Airport in 2000. The Sapporo service was moved to Okadama Airport in 2001 and discontinued entirely in 2003. For a short period between July and November 2011, Hokkaido Air System offered one daily service to Okadama Airport.

In fiscal year 2008, Monbetsu Airport recorded an operating loss of 273 million yen on total revenues (chiefly landing fees received from ANA) of only 26 million yen, making its operating losses the highest among the six airports operated by the Hokkaido government. In 2011, the Hokkaido government announced that landing fees would be waived for international charter flights using the airport in an attempt to lure more overseas tourists to the region.

In the winter of 2013, ANA again started services to Sapporo, flying a daily 737-700 flight to New Chitose Airport.

==Airlines and destinations==

The airport has a two-story, 1,993 m2 terminal building which is open daily from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

<doc id="1023719" wikidata="Q31645" url="?curid=1023719" title="Multisport race">
<text>A multisport competition is a family of athletic competitions in which athletes race in a continuous series of stages or &quot;legs&quot;, and rapidly switch from one athletic discipline to another in order to achieve the best overall time. Most multisport events are endurance races, consisting of aerobic activities such as cycling, running, kayaking and cross-country skiing.

Familiar events from the Olympic Games such as the pentathlon, heptathlon, octathlon, decathlon, and modern pentathlon are not usually considered to fall in this category, because their individual components are not held back-to-back.

==Standard multisport events==
The world of multisport competitions has grown from the older and more traditional triathlon and duathlon competitions, and today includes a large number of variations. There is quite a bit of variation in the naming of these events; the more common and most standardized names are listed here.

Adventure racing includes races which comprise a number of different stages of different types. In many adventure races, the competitors do not know some or all of the stages before the race, and must handle unexpected challenges. A team normally consists of 4 people, with at least 1 female. All team members must stay together at all times.

== Related events ==
Biathlon, which consists of alternating stages of cross-country skiing and shooting, is often confused with duathlon because of the similarity in names. Some consider biathlon to be a form of multisport event, while others exclude it from the category because the athlete&#x27;s score includes shooting accuracy in addition to total race time.

Coast to Coast is a multisport race held in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. Starting at Kumara Beach on the Tasman Sea and finishing at Sumner Beach on the Pacific Ocean, the race involves a 3 km run, a 55 km cycle, a 33 km mountain run, a 15 km cycle, a 67 km kayak, and a 70 km cycle.

There are also three military multisports, mainly participated in by militaries at the World Military Games and world championships: aeronautical pentathlon, military pentathlon, and naval pentathlon.

Cabot Head is so named in honor of the explorer John Cabot, although Cabot never explored the Great Lakes. The name of the area was bestowed by John Graves Simcoe (1752-1806).

Cabot Head Lighthouse sits 80 feet above the waterline of Georgian Bay. Originally built in 1896, the lighthouse is located on the eastern shore of Wingfield Basin Provincial Nature Reserve, marking a popular inlet for pleasure craft during harsh weather In 1968 the original tower and range light were demolished and replaced with an automated light. Over the next 15 years, The Friends of Cabot Head Lighthouse Organization restored the lighthouse. Today it serves as a museum, and tourists are encouraged to explore the paths throughout the surrounding Nature Reserve.

<text>[[Operation Downfall]] was the proposed Allied plan for the invasion of the [[Japanese archipelago|Japanese home islands]] near the end of World War II. 

The operation had two parts, Operation &quot;Olympic&quot;, intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, Kyūshū, and Operation &quot;Coronet&quot;, the planned invasion of the Kantō Plain, near Tokyo, on the main Japanese island of Honshu. &quot;Olympic&quot; was scheduled for November 1945, to be followed by &quot;Coronet&quot; in early 1946. 

If Downfall had taken place, it would have been the largest amphibious operation in history, surpassing D-Day. The planned operation was canceled when Japan surrendered following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Soviet declaration of war, and the invasion of Manchuria.

<text>Charles Vance Millar (June 28, 1854 – October 31, 1926) was a Canadian lawyer and financier. He was the president and part-owner of the Toronto brewery of O&#x27;Keefe Brewery. He also owned racehorses, including the 1915 King&#x27;s Plate–winning horse Tartarean. However, he is now best known for his unusual will which touched off the Great Stork Derby.

==Early years==
Charles Millar was born in Aylmer, Canada West, the only child of farmers Simon and Sarah Millar. Millar attended the University of Toronto and graduated with an average of 98% in all his subjects. He chose to study law, passed the bar examination at Osgoode Hall in 1884 and opened up his own law office in Toronto.

==Business career==
===The BC Express Company and the Millar Addition===
In 1897, Millar purchased the BC Express Company from Stephen Tingley and took over the government mail delivery contracts for the Cariboo region in British Columbia.

When it was announced that the construction of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway would go through Fort George (later named Prince George) Millar expanded the company&#x27;s services to Fort George and built two sternwheelers, the &quot;BX&quot; and the &quot;BC Express&quot;. Millar also foresaw that Fort George would become a major centre in Northern British Columbia and he made arrangements to purchase the First Nations reserve at Fort George. However, the railway was already planning to purchase the property and they convinced the Department of Indian Affairs to cancel their negotiations with Millar. When Millar took the railway to court, the railway agreed to sell him of the property, which became known as the Millar Addition.

===Horse racing===
Millar owned racehorses, including the 1915 King&#x27;s Plate-winning horse Tartarean. At the time of his death, he owned seven horses, including Troutlet, which went on to win the 1927 King&#x27;s Plate, under different ownership. By then the executors of his Millar estate had sold his horses including Troutlet. In the 1910s, Millar had planned to build a racetrack in Kingston, Jamaica, where he holidayed, but abandoned the idea. In 1912, he had made arrangements with the builder of the Belmont Park racetrack, C. W. Leavitt to design the track. Millar was an investor in Kenilworth Park Racetrack, built just outside Windsor, Ontario, in 1916.

==Death==
Millar died in his law office in the Crown Life Building at Yonge and Colborne Streets on October 31, 1926, of a stroke. He was discussing a case with Charles Kemp, a law associate, when he collapsed. Millar died before a doctor could arrive. Millar was buried in the family plot in Aylmer. He had not married and had no descendants and his parents had both predeceased him. His funeral was held at his home on 75 Scarborough Road in the Beaches district of Toronto, attended by many other members of the legal profession. When his executors filed his will for probate, Millar&#x27;s estate was estimated to be worth .

His death coincided with the disappearance of several books of accounting of O&#x27;Keefe Brewery. At the time the government of Canada contended that O&#x27;Keefe was $175,000 in arrears on sales taxes. The claim had been made to O&#x27;Keefe earlier in October 1926. The Royal Customs Commission held an inquiry in March 1937 and evidence was given that Millar had sent for the books to be delivered to his office. However, a search of his office, home and the company did not turn up the books, according to his associate Charles Kemp. O&#x27;Keefe was suspended from brewing &quot;strong beer&quot; during the dispute, until it provided the books to the commission. O&#x27;Keefe offered a reward for the return of the books and continued with its other activities. In May 1927, O&#x27;Keefe appealed for a reinstatement of its licence. F. H. Phippen, the president of the company testified that Millar, the president of O&#x27;Keefe in October 1926, did not want to give up the books to the commission and proposed an injunction. Phippen was in favour of giving up the books to the commission. Phippen described Millar as &quot;a lawyer and an honourable man&quot;, and that he had only thought that Millar had put them away for safekeeping.

==Character==
Though highly successful in the law and in his investments, Millar was known for his love of jokes and pranks which played on people&#x27;s greed. One favourite was to leave money on a sidewalk and watch from a hiding place as passers-by furtively pocketed it. As a law student, Millar was jilted once by a girl of a prominent family and never had a serious relationship again. Millar was known to sleep on the veranda outside his house in all weather, to &quot;keep himself hard&quot;. In life, he was never known to have given to any charity. The only club Millar was a member of was the Royal Canadian Yacht Club.

Abe Orpen, when informed about his mention in Millar&#x27;s will, discussed his working relationship with Millar over many transactions. According to Orpen, the two always made verbal agreements, never on paper. Orpen distrusted Millar, who would always look for some loophole in a contract, though never broke his word.

==Will==
Millar&#x27;s final prank was his will, which says in part:

The will had several unusual bequests: 
*Three men who were known to despise each other (T. P. Galt, KC; J. D. Montgomery and James Haverson, KC) were granted joint lifetime tenancy in Millar&#x27;s vacation home in Jamaica, on condition that they live in the property together.
*To each practicing Protestant minister in Toronto, and every Orange Lodge in Toronto, a share of O&#x27;Keefe Brewery stock, a Catholic business, if they participated in its management and drew on its dividends.
* Two anti-horse-racing advocates (Hon. William Raney, Reverend Samuel Chown) and a man who detested the Ontario Jockey Club (Abe Orpen) were to receive a share of Ontario Jockey Club stock, provided they are shareholders in three years. Raney&#x27;s and Chown&#x27;s share were eventually given to charity and Orpen accepted his share.
* Each duly ordained Christian minister in Walkerville, Sandwich, and Windsor, &quot;except Spracklin, who shot a hotelkeeper&quot; was to receive a share of the Kenilworth Park Racetrack, located just outside Windsor, Ontario.

The home in Kingston, Jamaica, had already been sold by Millar. It was not in his estate when it was submitted for probate.

The bequest to the Protestant ministers of O&#x27;Keefe stock was a problem to resolve. The corporate structure of O&#x27;Keefe was such that Millar&#x27;s share of the company was not in shares, but in a share of a holding company that controlled O&#x27;Keefe. He only had one actual share in the O&#x27;Keefe Brewery Ltd. The 99 ministers and the 103 Orange Lodges who accepted the bequest, did so upon the sale of O&#x27;Keefe in 1928 for $1.35 million, in an agreement with the executors. The legatees each received $56.38.

In October 1928, five pastors in Windsor claimed the bequest of the Kenilworth shares. The value of the shares was hard to judge, as the stock did not trade publicly. One estimation was that they were worth less than one cent each. The racetrack would close within a decade.

== The Great Stork Derby ==

The tenth and final clause of his will was the largest. It required that the balance of Millar&#x27;s estate was to be converted to cash ten years after his death and given to the Toronto woman who gave birth to the most children in that time. In the event of a tie, the bequest would be divided equally. The resulting contest became known as the Great Stork Derby.

The Supreme Court of Canada validated the will; Millar had prepared it with care. The will survived ten years of litigation, including attempts by Millar&#x27;s distant relatives to have it declared invalid, and the Derby continued uninterrupted. Because of Millar&#x27;s long-term investments, particularly one of land adjacent to the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel that turned a $2 investment into over $100,000, his estate increased drastically during the ten years, and was worth $568,106 when it was finally liquidated. Its value was enhanced as it accumulated during a deflationary economic period.

Most of this prize was shared by four Toronto women who each had nine children, receiving $110,000 each, although three of the four had to pay back to the City of Toronto relief money they had collected. The estate also paid $12,500 each to two women with dubious claims to a share in the prize so as to end litigation.

The contest inspired a Canadian made-for-television movie, &quot;The Stork Derby&quot;, which starred Megan Follows.

It was speculated that Millar prepared this clause in his will to outrage the moral sense of Canadians and lead to reforms such as ending prohibitions against birth control.

<doc id="1023732" wikidata="Q369110" url="?curid=1023732" title="M230 chain gun">
<text>The M230 Cannon is a 30 mm (30×113 mm), single-barrel electrically-driven autocannon, using external electrical power (as opposed to recoil or expanding gas generated by the firing cartridge) to cycle the weapon between shots. It was designed and manufactured originally by Hughes Helicopters in Culver City, California. , it is produced by Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems.

==Development==
In 1972, Hughes Helicopters began a company-funded research effort to design a machine gun to fire the U.S. Army&#x27;s M50 round. By April 1973, the program had fired test rounds of more powerful WECOM linked ammunition, from a prototype (A model). In January 1975, a model C was added, a linkless version for the proposed Advanced Attack Helicopter YAH-64; the helicopter was eventually adopted as the AH-64 Apache, with the model C as standard armament. The linked ammunition version was intended for use on the AH-1S Cobra as the M230E1, but was later dropped.

==Design==
===Apache and DAP mounts===
The M230 Chain Gun is used on the MH-60L Direct Action Penetrator. It is also the Area Weapon System on the Boeing AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, mounted on the chin turret. It uses a electric motor to fire linkless ammunition at a rate of 625±25 rounds per minute. The air-cooled gun&#x27;s practical rate of fire is about 300 rounds per minute with a 10-minute cooling period. The gun has a positive cook-off safety for open bolt clearing, and double ram prevention. Spent casings are ejected overboard through the bottom of the gun.

The mount on the AH-64 uses secondary hydraulics to move the gun. The elevation is provided via a single hydraulic actuator on the gun&#x27;s centerline just forward of the pivot point. The gun is spring-loaded to return to its centerline stowed position with the barrel angled up about 11 degrees if hydraulic power is lost. This allows the gun, which is mounted below the copilot station, to collapse into a space between the pilots&#x27; stations in a hard landing.

The Apache can carry up to 1,200 rounds for the gun in a device known as the 12-PAK, designed and manufactured by Meggitt Defense Systems, Inc. However, U.S. Army Apaches can carry only 300 because they also have a special internal fuel tank, the Robertson IAFS (known as the &quot;Robby Tank&quot; to the crews). Ammunition is loaded into the Apache by armament personnel using specialized ground support equipment: an aircraft-mounted motorized loader and special ammunition handling tray.

The M230 can fire the 30×113mm rounds used in the ADEN cannon and DEFA cannon, although U.S. Apaches use Lightweight rounds made with a lighter alloy than brass (ADEN) or steel (DEFA) cases. The M230 rounds cannot be fired by weapons designed for the ADEN or DEFA rounds. The Lightweight 30 mm rounds come in three varieties: the M788 rounds, which have a blue band near the nose, the M789 with a yellow stripe atop a black band, and the M799 with a red stripe atop a yellow band. The M799 HEI round is not used by the U.S. Army because of the danger of a round exploding in the gun barrel. 

The M789 is the U.S. Apache&#x27;s main tactical round, a High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) ammunition cartridge. Each round contains of explosive charge sealed in a shaped-charge liner. The liner collapses into an armor-piercing jet of metal that can penetrate of rolled homogeneous armour at 500m. The shell is also designed to fragment upon impact, killing unprotected, standing people up to about away under optimum conditions.

==Variants==

===M230LF and MAWS===
The M230LF, offered by Orbital ATK, is a more capable version of the Apache autocannon. Features include an anti-hangfire system, a delinking feeder that exploits linked ammunition, and an extended-length barrel, which results in greater muzzle velocity and hitting power from the same M789 HEDP and NATO standard ADEN/DEFA projectiles. The rate of fire is reduced to 200 rounds/minute and overall length decreased to . The chain gun can be installed in an enclosed turret on patrol boats and ground vehicles.

The MAWS (Modular Advanced Weapon System) lightweight gun system, developed in partnership with the U.S. Navy, utilizes a remotely operated M230LF in an open mount. It is controlled by a Remote Operator&#x27;s Console (ROC)—with either dual grips or a joystick—from a touch panel display and extended day color TV.
In February 2015, Oshkosh Defense and ATK conducted a firing demonstration of the M230LF on an Oshkosh M-ATV MRAP to demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of a medium caliber weapon system for light tactical vehicles. The live fire demonstration showcased improved accuracy in mobile engagements and improved lethality on the M-ATV using the gun, mounted on the Electro Optic Systems (EOS) R400S-Mk2, a 3-axis stabilized remote weapon station (RWS) weighing less than . The addition of the M230LF stabilized on the RWS provides mobile precise lethality, usually reserved for heavier combat vehicles, with increased off-road mobility and MRAP levels of protection, along with optional Stinger missiles. Oshkosh has also fitted the M230LF to the L-ATV to fulfil the U.S. Army&#x27;s light reconnaissance vehicle (LRV) role.

Australian company Electro Optic Systems also utilises the M230LF for its &quot;Slinger&quot; defensive system. The system is planned for usage against drones by using a radar and a variety of sensors to track and destroy targets with a single shot. All together it weighs less than 400 kg (880 lb) and can be mounted on a flatbed truck, allowing for a more cost effective way of destroying drones compared to missile based systems. On October 2, 2023 it was confirmed that EOS would send an undisclosed number of Slingers to Ukraine to combat the growing drone threat.

In October 2024, unveiled the M230LF dual-feed chain gun. The cannon has a dual-feed mechanism to allow operators to select between XM1211 proximity fuzed rounds to neutralize UAS and XM1198 HEDP rounds for anti-armor engagements. This enables a single gun to target both threats and eliminates the need for mixed ammunition belts in a single feed.

===In SHORAD-use===
====Stryker A1 M-SHORAD====

On 28 February 2018, the US Army announced that Stryker vehicles would be modified with sensors and weapons to fulfill an interim Maneuver-Short-Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) requirement. This is in response to a capability gap identified in Europe against Russian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). 
In June 2018, the Army chose Leonardo DRS to supply the mission equipment package, which partnered with Moog Inc. to integrate the Reconfigurable Integrated-weapons Platform (RIwP) onto the vehicle. The system can be fitted with a Stinger pod and Longbow Hellfire missile rails and comes equipped with a 30 mm M230LF chain gun and the 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun, as well as non-kinetic defeat capabilities and a Rada onboard multimission hemispheric radar. The Army chose DRS because of the flexibility of the reconfigurable turret to allow for growth opportunities and alternate weapon options, it posed less intrusion to the existing vehicle platform, as they have a desire to keep the Stryker as common across the fleet as possible, and it provided increased protection as the crew can reload ammunition under armor. All 144 M-SHORAD systems are planned to be delivered by 2022. The turret can mount one four-shot Stinger pod or two Hellfire missiles on either side, and reloading of the M230LF and Stingers can be done through roof hatches giving partial protection. The system can act in a secondary anti-vehicle role, as the 30 mm cannon is larger than the 25 mm gun mounted on the M2 Bradley and the Hellfire has greater range than TOW missiles typically used by ground vehicles.

====MADIS====
In September 2020, the US Marines contracted Kongsberg to qualify the XM914 RWS on the JLTV, equipped with an XM914E1 30 mm cannon, 7.62 mm coaxial machinegun, and Stinger missiles to fulfill an air defense role. The Marine Air Defense Integrated System (MADIS) fills the gap left by the retirement of the AN/TWQ-1 Avenger by the USMC in the mid-2000s. It consists of two JLTVs, one with the turret fitted with a 30 mm cannon, 4-round Stinger pod, and an optical sensor and the other with an RPS-42 360-degree radar, 7.62 mm M134 minigun, and EO/IR sensors; both have the Modi II dismounted electronic countermeasures system and shoulder-fired Stingers. The indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract was signed in October 2021.

====Agnostic Gun Truck====
On 4 April 2023, the United States included &quot;counter-Unmanned Aerial System 30 mm gun trucks&quot; as part of Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative funds during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Northrop Grumman Agnostic Gun Truck consists of an M230LF mounted on a civilian pickup truck. Three battery sets each including three gun trucks and one Mobile Acquisition, Cueing and Effector (M-ACE) system will be delivered; M-ACE incorporates a mast-mounted 3D radar that can detect a drone out to as well as tracking and identification cameras. The radar cues the guns onto a target, which fires M1211 High Explosive Proximity Self Destruct rounds capable of engaging UAS up to Class 2. The AGT was meant to be delivered within 30 to 90 days of the contract award, however by early August delays in the procurement process had prevented the full complement of trucks from being built. They were to be sent &quot;very shortly&quot; by October 2023.

<doc id="1023750" wikidata="Q7872103" url="?curid=1023750" title="USS Nantucket (1862)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Nantucket&quot; was a coastal monitor in the United States Navy.

&quot;Nantucket&quot; was launched 6 December 1862 by Atlantic Iron Works, Boston, Massachusetts; and commissioned 26 February 1863, Commander Donald McNeil Fairfax in command.

Assigned to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, &quot;Nantucket&quot; participated in the attack on Confederate forts in Charleston Harbor 7 April 1863. Struck 51 times during the valiant but unsuccessful assault on the vital Southern port, the single-turreted monitor was repaired at Port Royal but returned to Charleston to support Army operations on Morris Island, engaging Fort Wagner 16, 17, 18, and 24 July. She captured British steamer &quot;Jupiter&quot; at sea 15 September. She again challenged the Charleston Harbor forts 14 May 1864 and thereafter remained on blockade duty through the end of the American Civil War.

Decommissioned at Philadelphia Navy Yard 24 June 1865, she remained in ordinary there for a decade. Renamed Medusa 15 June 1869, she resumed the name &quot;Nantucket&quot; 10 August 1869. Transferred to Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, in 1875, &quot;Nantucket&quot; twice briefly recommissioned 29 July to 12 December 1882 and 16 June to 6 October 1884, and operated along the northern east coast. She lay in ordinary at New York until turned over to the North Carolina Naval Militia in 1895. During the Spanish–American War, &quot;Nantucket&quot; was stationed at Port Royal, South Carolina.

After being condemned as unfit for further service, &quot;Nantucket&quot; was sold at auction in Washington, D.C., on 14 November 1900. A total of five bids were received for the vessel, with the winning bid of $13,111 lodged by Thomas Butler &amp; Co. of Boston. The auction is said to have attracted considerable public interest, due to the vessel&#x27;s historic nature.

<doc id="1023754" wikidata="Q5586001" url="?curid=1023754" title="Gordon Wilson (British Columbia politician)">
<text>Gordon Wilson (born 2 January 1949) is a former provincial politician in British Columbia, Canada. He served as leader of the Liberal Party of BC from 1987–1993, leader and founder of the Progressive Democratic Alliance from 1993–1999, before joining the NDP where he served in the provincial cabinet. He also ran as a candidate in the 2000 BC New Democratic Party leadership race. During the 2013 British Columbia provincial election, Wilson endorsed Liberal Premier Christy Clark for re-election over the NDP&#x27;s Adrian Dix.

==Background==
Wilson was born in Vancouver, spent his early years in Kenya and returned to British Columbia in the 1970s. He has a BSc from the State University of New York at New Paltz, and a master&#x27;s degree from the University of British Columbia in resource economics.

He raised two children with his wife Elizabeth in the Middlepoint area of BC&#x27;s Sunshine Coast, dabbling in pig farming before teaching resource economics and economic geography at Capilano College (North Vancouver), where he also served as president of the faculty association.

==Political career==
After an unsuccessful campaign to be elected to the BC Legislature in the 1986 provincial election, in 1987, Wilson took over as leader of the BC Liberal Party, which had not elected a member in over a decade. He was defeated in a 1989 provincial byelection. In the 1991 general election, Wilson&#x27;s profile skyrocketed after his highly successful performance in the campaign&#x27;s televised leaders debate. During a nasty squabble between BC Socred leader and Premier Rita Johnston and BC NDP leader Mike Harcourt, Wilson famously said, &quot;Here&#x27;s a classic example of why nothing ever gets done in the province of British Columbia.&quot; It would become the campaign&#x27;s most successful sound bite.

As a consequence, he led the Liberal Party to win 17 seats, its highest total since 1949. He was largely helped by moderate Socreds crossing over to vote Liberal. The Liberals vaulted from no seats to the Official Opposition in the legislature, relegating the ruling Social Credit Party to a distant third with seven seats. Wilson won his own seat in Powell River-Sunshine Coast.

In 1993, Wilson&#x27;s leadership of the Liberals was challenged after it came to light that he was having an extramarital affair with fellow Liberal MLA Judi Tyabji, whom he had recently named as the party&#x27;s House Leader.
In a Liberal Party leadership review that had been called soon afterward, Wilson was defeated by Vancouver mayor Gordon Campbell. Within weeks, he and Tyabji left the Liberal caucus and formed a new party, the Progressive Democratic Alliance (PDA).

In the 1996 provincial election, Wilson retained his seat, while Tyabji, whom he later married, lost hers.

In 1999, Wilson shocked many in his party when he disbanded it and crossed the floor to join the governing NDP. As part of the deal, he joined Premier Glen Clark&#x27;s cabinet as Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Responsible for BC Ferries. He was later appointed Minister of Finance and Corporate Relations after the resignation of Joy MacPhail, and then Minister of Education. He later served as Minister of Employment and Investment and as Minister of Forests.

He ran for the NDP&#x27;s party leadership at a convention in February 2000, but pulled out of the race shortly before the voting began. He threw his support to candidate Corky Evans, who in turn lost to Ujjal Dosanjh. In the 2001 provincial election, he lost his seat to BC Liberal candidate Harold Long, previously a Social Credit MLA whom Wilson had defeated in 1991 when running for the BC Liberals.

After endorsing the BC Liberals in the 2013 provincial election, Premier Christy Clark appointed Wilson to a position titled LNG – Buy BC Advocate to promote for the development of an LNG industry in the province. The position was ended by the newly inaugurated NDP/Green government on 1 August 2017, a position for which he had been paid $150,000 per annum since 2013. In response to the public comments made following the termination Wilson launched a libel lawsuit, seeking $5 million in damages, against Premier John Horgan and Minister Bruce Ralston who implied he had not sufficiently provided report or briefing of his work, as well as federal Member of Parliament Rachel Blaney who questioned the value of the work relative to the salary in a Facebook post. Wilson later expanded the lawsuit to also name the CBC, radio station CKNW, and newspapers The Globe and Mail, The Vancouver Sun and Times Colonist who had all reported on the termination and subsequent comments. In June 2019, the case judge dismissed the portions claimed to have been lost acting as a future consultant or advocate for government or LNG-related organizations but permitted the case to be further considered to examine loss of income from the LNG – Buy BC Advocate position and costs of counselling.

==Other work==
He has written &quot;A Civilized Revolution&quot; (1994) about his views on politics and public policy, and wrote, directed and produced &quot;Serving Thyme,&quot; a television comedy based on the west coast. After leaving politics, Wilson settled back in Powell River, and became chairman of the board of a software company. He is chairman of Blackberry Coast Capital Inc.

<doc id="1023762" wikidata="Q15059" url="?curid=1023762" title="2000 Australian Grand Prix">
<text>The 2000 Australian Grand Prix (officially known as the 2000 Qantas Australian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 12 March 2000 at the Albert Park Circuit in Albert Park, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia before a crowd of 124,300. It was the first race of the 2000 Formula One World Championship. The 58-lap race was won by Michael Schumacher for the Ferrari team after starting from third position. Schumacher&#x27;s new teammate for the 2000 season, Rubens Barrichello finished second in the other Ferrari, with Ralf Schumacher third for BMW-Williams.

Mika Häkkinen started on pole position in a McLaren, with teammate David Coulthard alongside him, but both retired with pneumatic valve failures. Three drivers made their Grand Prix debut: future world champion Jenson Button in a BMW-Williams, Nick Heidfeld in a Prost and Gastón Mazzacane in a Minardi. Mazzacane and Button retired from their debut race, and Heidfeld finished ninth, two laps behind. This race was also mark the debutant team Jaguar Racing, which were previously known as Stewart Grand Prix.

== Background ==
Heading into the first race of the 2000 Formula One World Championship, many were tipping Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher and World Drivers&#x27; Champion, McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen as the main contenders to win the 2000 World Drivers&#x27; Championship. Schumacher was favourite to win the Championship according to the bookmakers and by some former Formula One drivers, including Schumacher&#x27;s teammate from the 1999 season, and new Jaguar driver Eddie Irvine. The last Drivers&#x27; Champion for Ferrari, Jody Scheckter, who did so in the 1979 season, also tipped Schumacher to win the Championship.

Out of the 11 teams and 22 drivers on the starting grid, three drivers made their debut. Nick Heidfeld joined the Prost team alongside Jean Alesi. The two replaced Prost&#x27;s 1999 season line-up of Olivier Panis, who moved to McLaren as test driver and Jarno Trulli, who moved to Jordan alongside Heinz-Harald Frentzen following Damon Hill&#x27;s retirement. At the Minardi team, Gastón Mazzacane replaced Luca Badoer, who opted to continue as Ferrari test driver, a role he began in 1997. The third rookie driver in the 2000 driver line-up was Jenson Button, who replaced Alessandro Zanardi at Williams. Button, at the time, became the youngest British driver ever to start a Formula One race. Many observers and fellow drivers alike had differing opinions of Williams&#x27; choice to take Button on. Sauber driver Mika Salo stated that because of Button&#x27;s inexperience, he could &quot;hurt himself or somebody else&quot;.

==Practice==
There were four practice sessions held before the Sunday race, two one-hour sessions on Friday and two 45-minute sessions on Saturday. In the first practice session, held on a slippery track surface, Häkkinen set the fastest lap of 1 minute and 32.768 seconds, followed by Michael Schumacher, Rubens Barrichello, David Coulthard, Jacques Villeneuve, Ralf Schumacher, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Jos Verstappen, Eddie Irvine and Alexander Wurz. During the session, Ricardo Zonta and Heidfeld spun into a gravel trap beside the circuit, Johnny Herbert&#x27;s car had a possible engine failure that cut out its ignition system, and Michael Schumacher&#x27;s driving was curtailed due to the on-board television camera mounted atop of his Ferrari melting a wiring loom. Although he removed the left-rear wheel of his car in an sideways accident at the fast sweeping turn 14 midway through the second practice session because he missed the braking point, Michael Schumacher recorded the day&#x27;s fastest lap of 1 minute and 32.130 seconds. Coulthard was second and Barrichello third. The rest of the top ten were Häkkinen, Villeneuve, Pedro Diniz, Frentzen, Wurz, Zonta and Irvine.

In the third practice session, Michael Schumacher continued to run strongly with the fastest time of 1 minute and 30.439 seconds. Coulthard was 0.519 seconds behind in second place and Frentzen placed third. Fourth went to Barrichello and Trulli was fifth. Ralf Schumacher, Villeneuve, Herbert, Giancarlo Fisichella and Irvine followed in the top ten positions. Häkkinen&#x27;s engine failed mid-way through his first lap, necessitating two teams of McLaren mechanics to spend 42 minutes dismantling both his and teammate&#x27;s Coulthard&#x27;s rear of their cars to change their engines and gearboxes to enable driving in the second practice session later that day. Michael Schumacher paced the final practice session with a lap of 1 minute and 30.390 seconds, ahead of Coulthard, Frentzen, Barrichello, Ralf Schumacher, Trulli, Pedro de la Rosa, Verstappen, Villeneuve and Herbert. On his fourth lap, Button crashed into the turn ten right-hand side barrier at after clipping a kerb, removing the rear wheels from his Williams and heavily damaging its bodywork. The session was halted for ten minutes as track marshals extricated his car from the circuit.

==Qualifying==
Saturday&#x27;s afternoon qualifying session lasted for an hour. Each driver was limited to twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers&#x27; fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap to qualify for the race. Mika Häkkinen took pole position by three-tenths from teammate David Coulthard, after the pair locked out a McLaren front row to start the season. Michael Schumacher was disappointed with third after a spin by Coulthard had caused a red flag forcing him to abandon his final attempt. Coulthard said that it &quot;was not the intention&quot; for him to disrupt Schumacher on his final flying lap. The top three qualifying places were identical to what they had been in the previous two years. Schumacher&#x27;s new Ferrari teammate, Rubens Barrichello, qualified fourth, with the Jordans of Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Jarno Trulli behind him on the third row. Eddie Irvine qualified seventh for Jaguar, with Jacques Villeneuve, Giancarlo Fisichella and Mika Salo completing the top ten. Ralf Schumacher was eleventh for the Williams-BMW, with rookie teammate Jenson Button qualifying 21st for his first race, setting a lap time 1.6 seconds slower. Behind Button was another rookie, Gastón Mazzacane, and in front was Jaguar&#x27;s Johnny Herbert. Button later described his qualifying session by saying &quot;It can&#x27;t get worse than this&quot;.

===Qualifying classification===
== Warm-up ==
In Sunday morning&#x27;s half an hour warm-up session, Barrichello paced the field with a time of 1 minute and 31.225 seconds. He was 1.573 seconds faster than Button in second place who had a small oil leak and fire in the pit lane. The two McLarens were third and fourth, with Häkkinen ahead of Coulthard. Verstappen was fifth and Fisichella sixth. Jean Alesi, Michael Schumacher, de la Rosa and Salo completed the top ten going into the race.

== Race ==
The race began before a total of 124,300 people at 14:00 local time. 21 of the 22 cars started on the grid, with Prost driver Alesi the only car to start from the pit lane. Häkkinen converted his pole position from qualifying to lead into the first corner at the start of the race. Coulthard and Schumacher remained in second and third place respectively, but Barrichello was overtaken by Frentzen into turn one, dropping him down to fifth place. Trulli rounded out the top six places at the end of lap 1. At the back of the field, Button gained six positions, moving from 21st to 15th position. This was partially due to a collision between Minardi driver Marc Gené and rookie Heidfeld, which left Gené last in the order as he had to pit for repairs.

Jaguar driver Johnny Herbert was the first person to retire, retiring with clutch problems on lap 2. By lap 4, the two McLarens of Häkkinen and Coulthard, along with Schumacher, were already pulling away from Frentzen&#x27;s Jordan, who was five seconds behind Schumacher. On lap 7, the front suspension on the Arrows car of Pedro de la Rosa failed, sending him into a tyre barrier. Herbert&#x27;s teammate, Irvine spun trying to avoid the Arrows car. Irvine could not get the Jaguar going again as it suffered an engine failure. Both retired from the race. The safety car was deployed to slow the other cars down so the marshals could clear up the wreckage.

When the green flag was given at the end of lap 10, Coulthard slowed dramatically and came in for a pit stop with engine problems. Coulthard returned to the track, but the problem continued and forced his retirement on lap 11. Schumacher was now promoted to second, with Frentzen in third place. Barrichello was in fourth place, with Trulli fifth. Behind the top five, BAR driver Jacques Villeneuve was in sixth place, heading a queue of cars down to 12th place Button. Häkkinen retired on lap 18, with the same problem as his teammate; a double retirement almost identical to the 1999 race. With Häkkinen&#x27;s retirement, Schumacher led by 16.5 seconds from Frentzen in second. Schumacher made his one and only pit stop on lap 29, giving Frentzen the lead. Schumacher rejoined the track in third, just in front of Trulli. Barrichello was the next driver of the front running cars to pit on lap 33, but the Ferrari team switched him to a two stop strategy so that he could move ahead of Frentzen.

Trulli retired his Jordan car on lap 36 with gearbox problems. The retirements and pit stops moved Button up the order, putting the Williams driver in third place before his pit stop on lap 36. Frentzen also made a pit stop on lap 36, but the Jordan mechanics experienced problems while refuelling the car, costing Frentzen over ten seconds in the stop. Frentzen rejoined the track in sixth, however retired three laps later with gearbox problems. Barrichello took the lead on lap 45, overtaking teammate Schumacher before making his second pit stop. Barrichello rejoined the track second.

The retirements of the McLaren and Jordan team cars elevated Ralf Schumacher, Button&#x27;s Williams teammate, into third position. Villeneuve was fourth, Giancarlo Fisichella was fifth in the Benetton, with Button sixth. With 11 laps remaining Button retired from the race with an engine failure. Ricardo Zonta, in a BAR, was promoted to sixth, but was overtaken by Salo with a few laps remaining. Schumacher won the race after 58 laps in a time 1:34:01.987, twelve seconds ahead of second placed Barrichello, who completed a Ferrari one-two finish. Ralf Schumacher was classified third, with Villeneuve close behind in fourth, giving BAR their first ever points in Formula One. Fisichella finished fifth, with Salo initially classified as sixth in the Sauber. However, a few hours after the race, Salo was disqualified from the race for a bodywork infringement, promoting Zonta into sixth position.

<doc id="1023763" wikidata="Q1173370" url="?curid=1023763" title="Dave Ulliott">
<text>David A. &quot;Devilfish&quot; Ulliott (1 April 1954 – 6 April 2015) was an English professional gambler and poker player, known for his connections to Hull&#x27;s organised crime scene. In 2017, he was posthumously inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame.

==Early years==
Ulliott was born in 1954 in Kingston upon Hull, England. He left school at 15 years old and was introduced to gambling at an early age, frequently visiting bookmakers with his father and placing bets on horse racing with his colleagues. His early exposure to gambling marked the beginning of a lifelong involvement in the world of betting and poker.

==Criminal activities==
Ulliott became part of a safe-cracking team after being told that all parties involved, including shop owners and local authorities, were complicit in the operation. Their targets included tobacconists, off-licenses, and garages. On one occasion, after losing over £5,000 (&quot;$6,500 USD&quot;) at a bookmaker&#x27;s, Ulliott stole a safe and transported it home in a pram. However, one of the team members was apprehended and informed the police of Ulliott&#x27;s involvement. He evaded capture for one week before being arrested.

Following his arrest, Ulliott was held in a cell at Kingston upon Hull Police Station for three weeks before being transferred to Leeds Prison. There he spent 23 hours a day in isolation during the first two months of his nine-month sentence.

Shortly after his release, Ulliott was again arrested in connection with an armed robbery at an off-license, though he was released three days later without charge. Afterward, he found employment at a timber yard but resumed his involvement with the safe-cracking team while also working as a bouncer and gambling.

At the age of 28, Ulliott was arrested after a fight outside a nightclub and was sentenced to 18 months in prison, serving time in both Leeds and Durham facilities. Most of his sentence was spent in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day. During this time, he befriended a fellow inmate named John, with whom he planned a bank robbery after their release. However, on the day of the planned heist, John was arrested by the regional crime squad, and Ulliott was advised by John&#x27;s wife to abandon the criminal path and &quot;go straight.&quot;

==Poker career==
Ulliott was introduced to gambling by his parents, who played poker with him during his childhood. At 16, he learned how to play three-card brag after frequenting Hull&#x27;s Fifty-One Club casino. By the time of his second marriage, Ulliott had begun organising poker games in the back of his pawn shop.

In late 1990, he met Gary Whitaker, a café manager from Wakefield, at Napoleon&#x27;s Casino in Leeds. The two became close, travelling together to poker games six nights a week. Whitaker often placed bets for Ulliott after he was banned from all William Hill betting shops. Additionally, Whitaker became Ulliott&#x27;s driver and held a 10% stake in his poker action.

When Ulliott first travelled to London, he found the competition much tougher, forcing him to adjust his playing style. He credited this experience with greatly improving his poker skills. In private poker games, Ulliott sometimes brought a gun to ensure he could leave with his winnings, even firing it into the air on one occasion to scare off opponents who planned to rob him.

=== Poker Success and the Origin of &quot;Devilfish&quot; ===
Ulliott first gained recognition in poker tournaments in 1993, gradually honing his skills in tournament play. His breakthrough came in 1996 when he won £100,000 over a two-week period at The Vic in London, which encouraged him and his friend, Gary Whitaker, to travel to Las Vegas, Nevada, for the first time.

Taking £10,000 with him, Ulliott maintained an even bankroll until he entered the $500 Pot Limit Omaha event at the 1997 Four Queens Poker Classic. During the heads-up match against Men Nguyen, a large group of Vietnamese-American supporters cheered for Nguyen, calling him &quot;The Master.&quot; In response, Whitaker coined the nickname &quot;Devilfish&quot; for Ulliott, cheering, &quot;Go on the Devilfish&quot;.

The nickname had been suggested earlier that year by Stephen Au-Yeung, who hosted a poker game Ulliott attended in Birmingham. Au-Yeung also sold Ulliott the domain name DevilFishPoker.com in 2005.

In the tournament, Ulliott reduced Nguyen&#x27;s stack to a single chip. Despite Nguyen&#x27;s protests, the tournament director insisted on taking the scheduled one-hour break. Ulliott famously told Nguyen, &quot;We&#x27;re taking the break, and in all fairness to you, I think you should go upstairs and think about your tactics.&quot; Ulliott eventually won the event, and the following day&#x27;s headline read, &quot;Devilfish Devours the Master&quot;. Despite the fame the nickname brought, Ulliott later downplayed the tournament&#x27;s significance, claiming it only mattered because of his new moniker. Before that nickname, Ulliott was known as &quot;Dave the Clock&quot; because he once used a grandfather clock as a buy-in for a local poker game where a furniture dealer was presented.

=== 1997 World Series of Poker (WSOP) ===
Ulliott arrived at the 1997 World Series of Poker (WSOP) with $200,000, but lost it all in cash games and tournament buy-ins. He borrowed over $70,000 more, but lost that as well, damaging several relationships along the way. However, he managed to gather enough money to enter the $2,000 Pot Limit Texas Hold&#x27;em event, where he eventually faced fellow Englishman Chris Truby in heads-up play.

In the final hand, Ulliott moved all-in with an open-ended straight draw and a flush draw, while Truby held the top set. Ulliott completed his straight on the river, securing the victory and earning $180,310, along with his first and only WSOP bracelet. Whitaker, his close friend, and driver, leapt over the barricade to join in the celebrations. While press reports suggested Ulliott got lucky, in reality, he was a 54.5% favourite to win the hand when the money went into the pot. After the victory, Ulliott had his bracelet engraved with his newly famous nickname, &quot;Devilfish.&quot;

Following his tournament win, Ulliott enjoyed a successful streak in cash games, netting between $10,000 and $20,000 daily for a two-week period. During this stretch, and upon the advice of his friend Mansour Matloubi, he played a high-stakes heads-up Pot Limit Omaha match against Lyle Berman, winning $168,000. By the end of his trip, Ulliott had amassed $742,000 in winnings, which he carried in duty-free bags along with Whitaker. Upon their return to their casino in Leeds, they were met with applause from their regular poker opponents.

===Late Night Poker===
In 1999, Ulliott was one of 40 players to appear in the first series of the &quot;Late Night Poker&quot; television series, the first poker show to use hole cam technology. He won his qualifying heat against a field that included Charalambos &quot;Bambos&quot; Xanthos and future Hendon Mobster Ross Boatman to advance to the Grand Final. Ulliott lead the final from the first hand (where his flush beat Surinder Sunar&#x27;s pocket queens). During the event, he made four of a kind against Joe Beevers, eliminated Liam Flood and slow-played three aces against Dave Welch.This prompted commentator Nic Szeremeta to say, &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen a hand played so well.&quot; Ulliott went on to win the heads-up confrontation against Peter Evans, and the £40,000 first prize.

Ulliott&#x27;s victory was watched by over 1,500,000 people and his character at the table was part of the reason for the renewal of the series, which went on to run for five more series, with Ulliott appearing in them all. Ulliott also made the final table in the second series.

===World Poker Tour===
In January 2003, Ulliott won his biggest tournament cash prize in the World Poker Tour (WPT) first season Jack Binion World Poker Open. Ulliott outlasted a field of 160 players, entering the final table with a 2:1 chip lead over his nearest rival, and taking first place and $589,175 after eliminating Phil Ivey. Ulliott eliminated four of his five opponents at the final table, in a performance that commentator Mike Sexton has referred to as &quot;still the most dominating performance in WPT history.&quot; In the second season, Ulliott was also invited to the WPT Bad Boys of Poker Invitational, and finished on the television bubble of the Aruba Poker Classic.

In December 2007, Ulliott came in 3rd place in the sixth season of the WPT Doyle Brunson Classic Championship Event earning $674,500.

===Other events===
Ulliott came close to winning a second WSOP bracelet on numerous occasions, finishing second in events at the 1998 WSOP and 2000 WSOP, and second at two more events at the 2001 WSOP. In two of these events, he was eliminated while holding aces.

Ulliott represented his country in the Poker Nations Cup, the PartyPoker.com Football &amp; Poker Legends Cup and the Intercontinental Poker Championship as well as the inaugural British Poker Open, which had a strong American field in contention.

At the PartyPoker Premier League, he embarked on a rivalry with Phil Hellmuth, including one six-man game where Ulliott called Hellmuth&#x27;s all-in bluff with A♠-8♠ against Hellmuth&#x27;s 7♥-5♥, making him a better than 60% favourite. Hellmuth flopped the nut straight. Later in the same game, Hellmuth&#x27;s pocket nines beat Ulliott&#x27;s aces.

Ulliott&#x27;s total lifetime tournament winnings exceeded $6,200,000, putting him 11th on England&#x27;s all-time money list, according to available records. His 33 cashes at the WSOP account for $1,708,075 of those winnings.

==Personal life==
Ulliott was married three times. He had two children with his first wife Susan; four children with Amanda (Mandy) Ashby; one child with his common-law wife Diana and one child with his third wife. He lived in Kingston upon Hull, close to his childhood home.

=== Autobiography ===
In spring 2010, Penguin Books announced the publication of Ulliott&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Devilfish: The Life &amp; Times of a Poker Legend&quot;, in September 2010. It was launched at Poker in the Park – Europe&#x27;s largest free poker festival, held in London&#x27;s Leicester Square – with a book signing session and talk by Ulliott.

The book was favourably reviewed by journalist and poker player Victoria Coren in &quot;The Observer&quot;, who said, &quot;I was nervous to review it, in case it was bad. Dave Ulliott is a friend of mine. And he has a gun. But I needn&#x27;t have worried. The book is, like the man, fast, funny, scary, smart, cocky, colourful, and I adore them both.&quot; She recounted her first meeting with Ulliott:
In the winter of 1999, on the sixth floor of a Cardiff hotel, I walked into a lift to find it already occupied by an elderly couple and a tall, sinister-looking fellow in a black leather trench coat and red sunglasses. &quot;The Devilfish!&quot; I breathed. &quot;Can I hold your bracelet?&quot; Without a word, the shady gentleman slipped a heavy gold bracelet off his wrist and jingled it into my hand. The elderly couple must have thought we were both insane. 

==Death==
Ulliott was diagnosed with colon cancer in February 2015, and died of the disease on 6 April 2015 at the age of 61.

==Legacy and reputation==
Despite the dominance of &quot;Texas Hold&#x27;em&quot; throughout televised poker, Ulliott had a reputation as a strong pot limit Omaha player, with over 40 finishes in the money in tournaments of that type. Once, in an Omaha cash game at The Vic in 1997, he successfully read that Jon Shoreman had a straight flush and laid down a four of a kind. Ulliott was also considered the best five-card stud player in Northern England. However, Ulliott indicated that his real preference was for four card Omaha.

In the UK, Ulliott was particularly famous, even being mentioned in &quot;EastEnders&quot;. He also appeared on the front cover of the inaugural edition of &quot;PokerPlayer magazine&quot;, and was voted No. 9 on their Top 10 Poker Legends List.
Ulliott was associated with the online poker site Devilfish Poker. After being eliminated in third place for $120,000 in the Full Tilt Poker invitational event at the 2005 Monte Carlo Millions, Ulliott stood up, flashing a &quot;www.devilfishpoker.com&quot; sign that was strapped to his back inside his jacket. The event was being broadcast live on Fox Sports Net (FSN), which has a policy against advertising .com websites, and Ulliott was banned from appearing in any forthcoming FSN productions.

Ulliott later responded that he only paid the entry money so he could advertise his site; it was originally agreed that he would be able to promote the site, so he decided to advertise his site through the publicity stunt regardless. Despite supporting online poker sites, Ulliott indicated that many online players do not know what they are doing when playing, which makes them harder to play against.

Ulliott became the subject of some controversy when he claimed that female poker players would never be as good as male players. He cited Lucy Rokach as a rare example of a strong female player, but still maintained that female players would never be aggressive enough to compete with their male counterparts.

Ulliott claimed that his gambling wins led to him being banned by all the British bookmakers. He also claimed that Joe Beevers placed bets on his behalf for a period of time, during which time he managed to back all six winners at Ascot one year, including one at 14/1 and one at 20/1.

In his later years, Ulliott attempted to change his image, no longer wearing slicked-back hair or sunglasses at the poker table. This was a result of attending a party in Las Vegas, where he felt everyone looked the same as him.

<text>Norman Lawrence Crosby (September 15, 1927 – November 7, 2020) was an American comedian born in Boston, Massachusetts. He was often referred to as &quot;The Master of Malaprop&quot;.

==Career==
Crosby went solo as a stand-up comedian, adopting a friendly, blue collar, guy-next-door persona in the 1950s. Crosby refined his standup monologues by interpolating malapropisms. He first appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; in December 1964. In late-1968, he co-starred on &quot;The Beautiful Phyllis Diller Show&quot;, an NBC twelve-week series.

In 1974, he co-hosted a Canadian variety television series, &quot;Everything Goes&quot;. From 1974 through 1984 he was on over half a dozen Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts including one of George Burns and two separate ones of Redd Foxx. From 1978 through 1981, he hosted a nationally syndicated series, &quot;The Comedy Shop&quot;, in which a mix of up-and-coming stand-up comics and vaudeville legends presented their material.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Crosby became a commercial pitchman for Anheuser-Busch Natural Light beer. During this time, he also appeared as a celebrity guest on a number of game shows, including &quot;Celebrity Bowling&quot;, &quot;Liar&#x27;s Club&quot;, &quot;Tattletales&quot;, and &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;.

From 1983 until the program&#x27;s dissociation from Jerry Lewis in 2010, Crosby co-hosted and contributed to the annual Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon.

He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6560 Hollywood Boulevard.

He appeared in two films with Adam Sandler – &quot;Eight Crazy Nights&quot; (2002) and &quot;Grown Ups 2&quot; (2013)

==Personal life and death==
Crosby was born to a Jewish family and was raised in Dorchester, Boston, the son of Ann (née Lansky) and John Crosby.

During World War II, he served aboard a Coast Guard submarine chaser in the North Atlantic. He suffered permanent damage of his hearing from a concussion he received from the depth charges that exploded while he was on anti-submarine patrol. He did not notice hearing problems until long after he had returned home and wore a hearing aid onstage.

In 1966, Crosby married Joan Crane Foley. They had two children. He became a Freemason in 1956, and served as Master of at least one lodge and participated in many charitable activities. He was a member of Ionic Composite Lodge #520 in Los Angeles, California.

On November 7, 2020, Crosby died of heart failure at his home in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 93.

<text>St. Andrew Bay, colloquially called &quot;St. Andrews Bay&quot;, is a bay located in Bay County in the panhandle of Florida. It is a 69,000-acre estuary located in northwest Florida. It is relatively deep, and of relatively high salinity due to the low freshwater inflow provided by only a few spring-fed creeks (the most significant being Econfina Creek, fed by Wiliford and Pitts Springs). The bay is named for Saint Andrew. Panama City, the county seat of Bay County, is located on the bay. The Atlanta &amp; St. Andrews Bay Railway, which ran from Panama City to Dothan, Alabama (and still exists as a smaller short line), was also named for the bay.

==History==
St. Andrew Bay was the location of a large number of saltworks critical for the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Edward Crissey, in command of the steamboat USS &quot;Bloomer&quot;, which he had been instrumental in stealing from her berth near Geneva, Alabama, helped destroy numerous salt works, doing great damage to the Confederate war effort. The shallow draft of the steamboat allowed her to go up inlets where other, deeper draft vessels had been unable to travel.

==Wildlife==
Wild dolphin are commonly seen in the waters of St. Andrew Bay; they are easily spotted when the waters are smooth in the mornings. In shallower waters, St. Andrew Bay is known for vast schools of mullet, redfish and speckled trout. Occasionally a manatee is spotted in the bay as well.

<doc id="1023779" wikidata="Q453311" url="?curid=1023779" title="Scylax of Caryanda">
<text>Scylax of Caryanda () was a Greek explorer and writer during the late 6th and early 5th centuries BCE of the Achaemenid Empire. His own writings are lost, though occasionally cited or quoted by later Greek and Roman authors. The periplus sometimes called the &quot;Periplus of Scylax&quot; is not, in fact, by him; that so-called &quot;Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax&quot; was written in about the early 330s BCE by an unknown author working in the ambit of the post-Platonic Academy and/or the Aristotelian Peripatos (Lyceum) at Athens.

==Exploration==

Scylax was from Caryanda, a small city on an island close to Iasos in Asia Minor. He was probably an ethnic Carian, who might have been familiar with Greek and used it for his writings. Not much is known about Scylax, except for the few fragments of information relayed by later Greek writers. Herodotus calls him a sea-captain from Ionia. He is said to have sailed down the Indus River at the behest of the Achaemenid emperor Darius I (522–486 BCE) and then around the Arabian peninsula to reach Suez. In the narrative of Herodotus:

Several questions have been raised about this narrative. The city of Caspatyrus and the country of Pactyica have not been traced to any real locations. Assuming that it is somewhere in the vicinity of Gandhara, which was under the control of the Achaemenid emperor, it is unclear how Scylax was able to assemble a fleet of vessels in this land-locked country. More importantly, the Indus does not flow east, but rather in a south-westerly direction. Due to these reasons, some commentators doubted if Scylax&#x27;s journey ever took place.

Scholars have constructed various explanations for these questions. David Bivar has noted that &#x27;Caspatyrus&#x27; was written as &#x27;Caspapyrus&#x27; by the later Greek writer Hekataios, and both the names seem to have been misspellings of &#x27;Paskapyrus&#x27;, a known Greek spelling of the name of Peshawar. Scylax is presumed to have started by sailing east along the Kabul River and turned south after its confluence with the Indus River near Attock. The idea that the Indus itself flowed east must have been a misunderstanding by Herodotus or his source.

Scholars state that Scylax&#x27;s expedition was not merely for exploration, but rather for reconnaissance for future conquest by Darius. According to Matthew R. Christ and Grant Parker, &quot;Herodotus presents geographical curiosity as a feature of foreign kings, particularly when they plan conquest&quot;. Olmstead characterised it as a &quot;spying&quot; expedition. It lasted thirty months. Soon afterwards, Darius seems to have added to his empire the lands explored by Scylax as a new province called &quot;Hinduš&quot;. It was referred to as &quot;India&quot; by the Greek writers. The extent of the province is not precisely known, though Herodotus&#x27;s description of it as lying to the west of the desert (Thar desert) limits it to essentially Sindh (middle and lower Indus basin).

Darius also commissioned the completion of the canal connecting the Nile with the Red Sea, stating in an inscription:
Afterwards, oceanic communication between India and Persia as well as Egypt and Mediterranean were established and maintained for some time.

==Works==
Scylax wrote an account of his travels, perhaps entitled &quot;Periplus&quot; (Circumnavigation) and said to have been dedicated to Darius. The work has disappeared except for seven quotations by later writers. The surviving quotations indicate it was not merely a logbook, but contained accounts of people, landscape, the natural conditions and perhaps also political affairs. Scholar Klaus Karttunen believes that it might have been written in Greek, in which case it would have been among the first works to be written in Greek prose. Hekataios was influenced by the work and Herodotus knew about it, though he may not have actually seen it himself.

The surviving quotations appear fabulous. One talks about Troglodytes (cave-dwellers), another about Monophthalmic (one-eyed people), yet another about Henotiktontes (people that produce only one offspring). According to Tzetzes, Scylax claimed that all these things were true and not made up. Scholar R. D. Milns states that Scylax would have reported the stories he heard from the natives, which he would have accepted in good faith.

Scylax&#x27;s &quot;Periplus&quot; provided the West with its first account of the easterly people and served as a model for later Greek writers. More lastingly, it gave India its name. The people of the Indus region were referred to as &quot;Hiduš&quot; or &quot;Hindush&quot; in Persian (due to sound change of &quot;*s&quot; &gt; &quot;h&quot; from Proto-Iranian &quot;Sindhu&quot;). If Scylax wrote in the Ionic dialect of Greek, which did not pronounce initial &quot;h&quot; sounds, he would have transformed it to &quot;Indos&quot; (plural: &quot;Indoi&quot;). Their land was characterised as &quot;Indike&quot; (the adjectival form, meaning &quot;Indian&quot;). Herodotus uses these terms as equivalent to the Persian terms &quot;Hiduš&quot; and &quot;Hindush&quot;, even though he also generalised them to all the people living east of Persia, leading to considerable ambiguities.

Scylax was famous in the ancient world. He is mentioned by Strabo as an &quot;ancient writer.&quot; According to the &quot;Suda&quot;, he also wrote (perhaps &quot;in the decades around 480 BC&quot;) a life of his contemporary, Heraclides of Mylasa (τὰ κατὰ Ἡρακλείδην τὸν Μυλασσῶν βασιλέα), who is mentioned in Herodotus 5.121.

==In popular culture==
In the historical fiction novel &quot;Creation&quot; by Gore Vidal Scylax of Caryanda appears as a character who is on such familiar terms with King Darius I of Persia that they engage in humorous banter about extending Persian rule to India.

<text>Stephen Champlin (17 November 1789 – 20 February 1870) was an officer in the United States Navy during the War of 1812.

Born in Kingston, Rhode Island, Champlin entered the Navy as a sailing master 22 May 1812. He commanded the schooner in her capture of the British during the Battle of Lake Erie, and later in the War of 1812 was wounded when his ship was taken on Lake Huron. Retired in 1855, Captain Champlin was later promoted to Commodore on the retired list, and died in Buffalo, New York and is buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery (Buffalo).

Two ships have been named for him, as was Champlin, Minnesota

<text>Apichatpong Weerasethakul (; ; , born 16 July 1970) is a Thai independent film director, screenwriter, film producer and Professor at Tama Art University in Tokyo. Working outside the strict confines of the Thai film studio system, Apichatpong has directed several features and dozens of short films. Friends and fans sometimes refer to him as &quot;Joe&quot; (a nickname that he, like many with similarly long Thai names, has adopted out of convenience).

His feature films include &quot;Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives&quot;, winner of the 2010 Cannes Film Festival Palme d&#x27;Or; &quot;Tropical Malady&quot;, which won the Jury Prize at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival; &quot;Blissfully Yours&quot;, which won the top prize in the &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; program at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival; &quot;Syndromes and a Century&quot;, which premiered at the 63rd Venice International Film Festival and was the first Thai film to be entered in competition there; and &quot;Cemetery of Splendour&quot;, which premiered in the &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; section of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival to critical acclaim. Apichatpong has received numerous additional accolades, including the 2016 Principal Prince Claus Award and the eighth edition of the Artes Mundi Prize. His first English-language film was &quot;Memoria&quot;, a 2021 international collaboration set in Colombia. 

Themes reflected in his films include dreams, nature, sexuality (including his own homosexuality), and Western perceptions of Thailand and Asia, and his films display a preference for unconventional narrative structures and for working with non-actors. 

Apichatpong has also widely exhibited in galleries, including FACT in Liverpool, and the BFI Gallery in London, the contemporary art space within BFI Southbank.

== Early life and education ==
Apichatpong was born in Bangkok, Thailand, to a Thai Chinese family. Both his parents had been physicians who worked at a hospital in Khon Kaen, while his grandparents came from Canton. Apichatpong never learned to speak Chinese as his father, who was also a member of the House of Representatives, died when he was young.

Apichatpong grew up in a traditional Buddhist family, exposed to rituals that incorporate animism and Hinduism, spiritual practices retained in the surrealist tones of his works today. Among the filmmaker&#x27;s early influences are the Dada movement and Joseph Cornell&#x27;s &quot;boxes&quot;.

Apichatpong attended Khon Kaen University and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in architecture in 1994. He made his first short film, &quot;Bullet&quot;, in 1993. He attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and received a Master of Fine Arts in filmmaking in 1997.

==Career==

Apichatpong&#x27;s feature-length debut, &quot;Dokfa nai meuman&quot; (&quot;Mysterious Object at Noon&quot;) is a documentary and was conceptually based upon the &quot;exquisite corpse&quot; game invented by surrealists. He co-founded the production company, Kick the Machine, in 1999, and uses the company as a vehicle for his own works, alongside Thai experimental films and video. The list of other founders includes Gridthiya Gaweewong and Suaraya Weerasethakul and the company co-organised the Bangkok Experimental Film Festival in 1999, 2001, 2005 and 2008.

===&quot;Blissfully Yours&quot;, &quot;Tropical Malady&quot;===

Apichatpong&#x27;s 2002 film &quot;Sud Sanaeha&quot; (&quot;Blissfully Yours&quot;) was his debut narrative feature film and was awarded the Un Certain Regard prize at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, though it was censored in his native Thailand. His 2004 &quot;Sud Pralad&quot; (&quot;Tropical Malady&quot;) won a Jury Prize from the same festival.

Between &quot;Blissfully Yours&quot; and &quot;Tropical Malady&quot;, Apichatpong co-directed &quot;The Adventure of Iron Pussy&quot; with artist Michael Shaowanasai, who starred as the main character, a transvestite secret agent, while pop singer Krissada Terrence, better known as Noi from the Thai band Pru, portrayed the male lead. The low-budget, digital movie was a spoof of Thai films of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the musicals and action films of Mitr Chaibancha and Petchara Chaowarat. &quot;The Adventure of Iron Pussy&quot; was screened at the Berlin Film Festival in 2004. When asked about the film in May 2013, Apichatpong said: &quot;I have had enough of Iron Pussy for now. I was having a good time making it but I was not inspired.&quot;

Along with his features, Apichatpong is also known for his short films, videoworks and installations. For the 2005 Jeonju International Film Festival, he was commissioned to contribute to the &quot;Three Digital Short Films&quot; project, alongside two other Asian directors. His film was called &quot;Worldly Desires&quot;, while Japanese filmmaker Shinya Tsukamoto made &quot;Vital, Bullet Ballet&quot; and Song Il-gon from South Korea created &quot;Magician(s)&quot;.

In 2005 Apichatpong served as the consultant on the &quot;Tsunami Digital Short Films&quot;, a series of 13 films commissioned by the Thailand Culture Ministry&#x27;s Office of Contemporary Art and Culture as a memorial tribute to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the resulting tsunami that struck Thailand. His contribution was the film &quot;Ghost of Asia&quot;.

The Thai Office of Contemporary Art and Culture also honoured Apichatpong with its 2005 Silpathorn Award for filmmaking. The annual award is given to living contemporary artists in various disciplines.

===&quot;Syndromes&quot; and censorship===
In 2006, Apichatpong released a feature film, &quot;Syndromes and a Century&quot;, that was commissioned by Peter Sellars for the New Crowned Hope Festival in Vienna to celebrate the 250th anniversary of Mozart&#x27;s birth. It premiered at the 63rd Venice Film Festival and screened at numerous film events, such as the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival.

The film&#x27;s Thai release, originally slated for 19 April 2007, was indefinitely delayed after the Thai Censorship Board demanded the removal of four scenes. Apichatpong refused to recut the film and said he would withdraw the film from domestic circulation. He explained his reasons for doing so in an article in the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot;:

Two of the &quot;sensitive&quot; scenes involve doctors engaging in &quot;inappropriate&quot; conduct (kissing and drinking liquor) in a hospital; the others depict a Buddhist monk playing a guitar and two monks playing with a remote-control flying saucer. The censors refused to return the print unless the requested cuts were made. In 2007 the film was shown twice in privately arranged screenings at the Alliance française in Bangkok.

The censorship of the film came about as a motion picture ratings system was being considered by the junta-appointed National Legislative Assembly. A replacement for the 1930 film act, the ratings law contained a restrictive ratings structure and retained the government&#x27;s powers to censor and ban films it deemed would &quot;undermine or disrupt social order and moral decency, or that might impact national security or the pride of the nation&quot;. The ratings board would comprise mainly bureaucrats in the Ministry of Culture, as well as members of the Royal Thai Police.

To oppose the draft law, Apichatpong and other directors formed the Free Thai Cinema Movement. Apichatpong was quoted as saying: &quot;We disagree with the right of the state to ban films ... There already are other laws that cover potential wrongdoings by filmmakers.&quot; Ladda Tangsupachai, director of the Ministry of Culture&#x27;s Cultural Surveillance Department, said the ratings law was needed because moviegoers in Thailand are &quot;uneducated&quot;. She further explained, &quot;They&#x27;re not intellectuals, that&#x27;s why we need ratings ... Nobody goes to see films by Apichatpong. Thai people want to see comedy. We like a laugh.&quot;

The filmmakers sought a self-regulation approach, with the founding of an independent body run by film professionals. Apichatpong had written in a commentary earlier in the year:
Free from state influence, this agency would be responsible for monitoring and assigning ratings, and it would bear direct responsibilities towards the audience, who in turn would monitor the performance of the agency. This way, the film industry will be liberated from the state&#x27;s shackles and begin to have a dialogue with the public.

A protest against the draft ratings law was held outside the Parliament building in Bangkok, at which Apichatpong and fellow Thai directors Wisit Sasanatieng and Pen-Ek Ratanaruang held banners that read: &quot;No Freedom. No Democracy. No Peace&quot; The ratings law, with the &quot;cut-and-ban&quot; categories left intact, was passed on 20 December 2007.

===&quot;Tomyam Pladib&quot;===
Apichatpong presented the &quot;Apichatpong On Video Works&quot; session as part of the &quot;Tomyam Pladib&quot; art exhibition that featured both Thai and Japanese artists who produced works regarding the coexistence of traditional and modern cultures. The filmmaker&#x27;s presentation consisted of three short films: &quot;Ghost Of Asia&quot;, &quot;0116643225059&quot; and &quot;The Anthem&quot;. Apichatpong also answered questions from the audience to conclude the presentation.

The first English-language book on Apichatpong was published in March 2009. James Quandt is the editor and author of the analytical career overview that introduces the book. Other contributors include the cultural and political theorist Benedict Anderson, filmmaker Mark Cousins, art curator Karen Newman, critics Tony Rayns and Kong Rithdee, and actress Tilda Swinton.

===&quot;Primitive&quot;, &quot;Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives&quot; and &quot;Memoria&quot;===
&quot;Primitive&quot;, Apichatpong&#x27;s first solo exhibition—composed of a two-channel video installation, seven single-channel videos, and two giclée prints—was first shown at Haus der Kunst in February 2009. In September 2009, the exhibition was shown in Liverpool, United Kingdom (UK) at FACT (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology). The work was commissioned by Haus der Kunst, of Munich, Germany, with FACT and Animate Projects, and was produced by Illuminations Films, London and Kick the Machine. Curator Karen Newman wrote in the introduction for the exhibition: &quot;His works are also vehicles that take us between different worlds, asking questions about the future and revealing a much bigger story than at first appears.&quot; Primitive was shot in the border town, Nabua, where the Mekong River divides Thailand and Laos. In 2011 the New Museum presented the American debut of &quot;Primitive&quot;

In 2010, Apichatpong&#x27;s feature film, &quot;Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives&quot;, won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival. The film was also selected as the Thai entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 83rd Academy Awards but it did not make the final shortlist.

In 2012, Apichatpong&#x27;s film &quot;Mekong Hotel&quot; was screened in the Special Screenings section at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival.

In March 2013, Apichatpong and fellow Kick The Machine artist Chai Siri received the &quot;Sharjah Biennial Prize&quot; at the 2013 Sharjah Biennial 11 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), alongside five other artists, including Magdi Mostafa and Fumito Urabe. Apichatpong was also awarded Japan&#x27;s &quot;Fukuoka Art and Culture Prize&quot; in June, alongside Indian visual artist Nalini Malani, worth 3,000,000 yen (US$30,530).

In March 2014, it was announced that Apichatpong will feature among 32 directors from four continents, including Vincent Gallo and Gaspar Noé, to direct &quot;Short Plays&quot;, a soccer-themed omnibus production shot around the world. Apichatpong&#x27;s short is set in his home town, features 22 shots of its lake, almost the only recognizable feature from his childhood, which are arranged like players in a soccer game.

Apichatpong&#x27;s latest film, &quot;Memoria&quot;, a collaboration with Tilda Swinton, produced by Diana Bustamante and shot in Colombia in 2019, had its premiere in the 2021 Cannes Film Festival. It received the Jury Prize (ex aequo), alongside Nadav Lapid&#x27;s &quot;Ahed&#x27;s Knee&quot;. Apichatpong also directed a segment of &quot;The Year of the Everlasting Storm&quot;, an anthology film.

===Upcoming projects===

It was reported in October 2024 that Weerasethakul is preparing a new feature film set in Sri Lanka, with production expected to begin in 2026. The film is likely to be inspired by Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s &quot;The Fountains of Paradise&quot; (1979) as well as an article written by a Thai woman who went to Sri Lanka on a religious pilgrimage.

==Personal views==
In a May 2013 interview for the &quot;Encounter Thailand&quot; journal, Apichatpong stated that all of his films are personal in nature and he does not consider himself a cultural ambassador for Thailand. In relation to the concept of &quot;queer&quot;, he explained: &quot;For me, the word queer means anything’s possible.&quot;

In December 2023, alongside 50 other filmmakers, Apichatpong signed an open letter published in &quot;Libération&quot; demanding a ceasefire and an end to the killing of civilians amid the 2023 Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, and for a humanitarian corridor into Gaza to be established for humanitarian aid, and the release of hostages.

<text>Helen Gallagher (July 19, 1926 – November 24, 2024) was an American actress, dancer, and singer. She received three Daytime Emmy Awards, two Tony Awards, a Donaldson Award, and a Drama Desk Award. 

Gallagher&#x27;s work on the New York stages spanned seven decades, with her big break coming in the role of Nancy in the 1947 musical &quot;High Button Shoes&quot;. Gallagher won her first Tony Award and a Donaldson Award for her role as Gladys Bumps in the 1952 revival of &quot;Pal Joey&quot;, and earned her first leading role on the Broadway stage in 1953, starring in &quot;Hazel Flagg&quot;. Two more noteworthy stage roles for Gallagher included her run as Nickie in &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;, which began in January 1966, and earned Gallagher a Tony Award nomination; and then, a year and a half later, Gallagher replaced Gwen Verdon in the lead role of Charity. Gallagher won her second Tony Award as well as a Drama Desk Award for her role as Lucille Early in the 1971 revival of the 1920s musical classic &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;. 

Gallagher also portrayed Irish matriarch Maeve Ryan on the ABC soap opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;. She played Maeve for the show&#x27;s duration, from July 1975 to January 1989, and was recognized with three Daytime Emmy Awards. Gallagher last acted on the New York stages in 2000 and worked as an acting instructor at Herbert Berghof Studio in New York City.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Born in Brooklyn, New York, on July 19, 1926, Gallagher was raised in Scarsdale, New York, and the Bronx. Her parents separated and she was raised by an aunt. She suffered from asthma.

===Stage===
Gallagher was known for decades as a Broadway performer. She appeared in &quot;Make a Wish&quot;, &quot;Hazel Flagg&quot;, &quot;Portofino&quot;, &quot;High Button Shoes&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; (for which she received a 1967 Tony Award nomination for Featured Actress in a Musical), eventually assuming the title role, and closing the original Broadway run. She also appeared in &quot;Cry for Us All&quot;.

In 1952, she won a Tony Award and a Donaldson Award for her work in the revival of &quot;Pal Joey&quot;. In 1971, she won her second Tony for her role in the revival of the musical &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;. Her song-and-dance number with Bobby Van from that show, &quot;You Can Dance with Any Girl&quot;, was a popular number from the 1971 revival, and was performed by both Gallagher and Van on the 1971 and 1972 Tony Awards telecasts. She later took on the role of Sue Smith in the Paper Mill Playhouse revival of the show, playing the role Keeler played a quarter century earlier.

Her first starring role on Broadway came in 1953 as title character in &quot;Hazel Flagg&quot;, based on the 1937 Carole Lombard movie &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot;. The role earned her a feature-photo shoot for &quot;Life&quot;. Gallagher appeared in the 1977 movie &quot;Roseland&quot; opposite Christopher Walken. An aficionada of Rodgers and Hammerstein, she appeared on a special tribute to Richard Rodgers on &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot;.
===Television===
In 1949 Gallagher was co-host of &quot;Manhattan Showcase&quot;, a 15-minute talent-discovery program on CBS television.

Despite extensive work on Broadway, Gallagher is perhaps best known to many Americans unfamiliar with her theater repertoire as the Irish matriarch Maeve Ryan on the ABC soap opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;, a role she played for the show&#x27;s entire duration, from 1975 to 1989. She was nominated for five Daytime Emmy Awards for her work on the serial, winning in 1976, 1977, and 1988. 

At the time she was cast in &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;, Gallagher taught singing in her home three times a week. Michael Hawkins, who played the first Frank Ryan, was one of her students.

As the show progressed into the 1980s, the show&#x27;s ratings — never at blockbuster levels — took a steep slide. ABC executives cancelled &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; in 1989. Creator and head writer Claire Labine scripted the end of the final episode with Maeve at the family bar, singing &quot;Danny Boy&quot;. Almost immediately after the cancellation of &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;, Gallagher had a two-day guest stint on &quot;Another World&quot;, and has appeared in &quot;All My Children&quot; as a strict nurse and on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; as a sex therapist. She also continued to act in various off-Broadway and professional theater productions.

===Personal life===
In 1956, Gallagher married Frank Wise, who she met when he was a stagehand for &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;. They divorced in 1972. Her friend Patti Specht served as the executor of her will at the time of her death.

===Later life and death===
In 1984, Gallagher starred in the title role of &quot;Tallulah&quot;, a musical stage biography of actress Tallulah Bankhead. In 1990s, she guest-starred on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and &quot;The Cosby Mysteries&quot;. In 1997, she starred in the independent LGBT-themed drama film &quot;Neptune’s Rocking Horse&quot;.

She was a faculty member at Herbert Berghof Studio in New York City.

Gallagher died in New York City on November 24, 2024, at the age of 98.

<doc id="1023800" wikidata="Q17088723" url="?curid=1023800" title="Lyndon LaRouche U.S. presidential campaigns">
<text>Lyndon LaRouche&#x27;s United States presidential campaigns were a controversial staple of American politics between 1976 and 2004. LaRouche ran for president on eight consecutive occasions, a record for any candidate, and tied Harold Stassen&#x27;s record as a perennial candidate. LaRouche ran for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States seven times, beginning in 1980.

==Campaigns==

===1976===
In 1971 LaRouche founded the U.S. Labor Party as a vehicle for electoral politics. In 1976 he ran for President of the United States as the U.S. Labor Party candidate, polling 40,043 votes (0.05%). According to LaRouche supporters, the major accomplishment of the campaign was the broadcast of a paid half-hour television address, which gave LaRouche the opportunity to air his views before a national audience. This was to become a regular feature of later campaigns during the 1980s and 1990s.

His platform included a reference to Vice President Nelson Rockefeller: &quot;Impeach Rocky to prevent imminent nuclear war&quot;.

===1980===

Since the autumn of 1979, LaRouche resigned from the U.S. Labor Party and founded the National Democratic Policy Committee (NDPC), a political action committee whose name drew complaints from the Democratic National Committee, who saw these efforts as infiltration.

LaRouche budgeted $150,000 for the first primary state, New Hampshire. That included air time on TV stations in overlapping markets such as Maine and Vermont, along with 1,928 radio advertisements on New Hampshire radio. LaRouche reportedly spent $4,000 on a half-hour broadcast on WBZ, and a total of $24,200 on all TV spots in the state.

The Democratic National Committee asserted that LaRouche is not a Democrat, but the U.S. electoral system made it impossible for the party to prevent LaRouche followers entering Democratic primaries. LaRouche himself polled negligible vote totals, but continued to promote himself as a serious political candidate, a claim which was sometimes accepted by elements of the media and some political figures.

In the end, LaRouche got 177,784 (0.91%) votes in the primaries.

===1984===
LaRouche&#x27;s 1984 campaign was his most successful, garnering over 76,000 votes. Independent Democrats for LaRouche, a committee formed for the 1984 election, was found guilty in 1988 of soliciting loans in violation of Minnesota securities law, and was ordered to stop selling unregistered Securities.

===1988===
In 1988 LaRouche and running mate Debra Hanania Freeman received 25,082 votes, or 0.03% of the vote.

===1992===

In 1992, LaRouche became the third person in U.S. history (after Joseph Smith and Eugene Debs) to run for president from a prison cell. Classical violinist Norbert Brainin performed a benefit concert on his behalf in Washington, D.C.; the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reviewer praised his musicianship while condemning his political message. LaRouche&#x27;s running mate, who did the active campaigning, was the American Civil Rights Movement leader, Reverend James Bevel.

===1996===
Prior to the primaries the Chair of the Democratic National Committee, Don Fowler, ruled that LaRouche &quot;is not to be considered a qualified candidate for nomination of the Democratic Party for President&quot; on account of LaRouche&#x27;s &quot;expressed political beliefs, including beliefs which are explicitly racist and anti-Semitic, and otherwise utterly contrary to the fundamental beliefs ... of the Democratic Party and ... on his past activities including exploitation of and defrauding contributors and voters.&quot; In subsequent primaries LaRouche received enough votes in Louisiana and Virginia to get one delegate from each state. When the state parties refused to award the delegates LaRouche sued in federal court, claiming a violation of the Voting Rights Act. After losing in the district court the case was appealed to the First District Court of Appeals, which sustained the lower court.

In 1999, however, a court ruled that the Democratic National Committee had the right to keep LaRouche from electing delegates to the Democratic National Convention, based on a party requirement that a Democratic nominee must be a registered voter. LaRouche, as a convicted felon, was not eligible to be a registered voter in the state of Virginia, where he lived. &quot;(see United States v. LaRouche)&quot;

===2000===
A routine FEC audit of the 2000 &quot;LaRouche&#x27;s Committee for a New Bretton Woods&quot; campaign found that vendors whose sole client was Lyndon LaRouche had added unqualified &quot;mark-up charges&quot; to the bill submitted for matching funds. The vendors were American System Publications, Inc., Eastern States Distributors, Inc., EIR News Services, Inc., Hamilton Systems Distributors, Inc., Mid-West Circulation Corp., Southeast Literature Sales, Inc., and Southwest Literature Distributors, Inc. They had overbilled by $241,519 and the campaign was ordered to repay $222,034. The FEC decision was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

LaRouche qualified to win six delegates in the Arkansas Democratic primary. A minimum of 15% vote was required and LaRouche took 22%. However, the Democratic Party refused to grant him delegates because he was ineligible to vote.

===2004===
He waged a campaign, begun in October 2002, to have Dick Cheney dumped from the Republican ticket.

Again, LaRouche gained negligible electoral support. However, according to Federal Election Commission statistics, LaRouche had more individual contributors to his 2004 presidential campaign than any other candidate, until the final quarter of the primary season, when John Kerry surpassed him. As of the April 15 filing, LaRouche had 7834 individual contributions, of those who have given cumulatively, $200 or more, as compared to 6257 for John Kerry, 5582 for John Edwards, 4090 for Howard Dean, and 2744 for Dick Gephardt.

He ran even though his home state of Virginia is one of a handful of states which still has lifetime denial of the vote to felons, which can be overturned only on appeal to the governor. (Neither the Constitution nor federal statute law requires presidents to be registered voters.) The Democratic Party did not consider his candidacy to be legitimate and ruled him ineligible to win delegates. He gained negligible electoral support. He was endorsed by two Democratic state representatives, Erik Fleming of Mississippi and Harold James of Pennsylvania, though Fleming later called the endorsement &quot;the worst mistake of all.&quot; LaRouche was not one of the major candidates invited to the primary-season debates, although he did participate in some alternative forums for minor candidates.

LaRouche was present in Boston during the 2004 Democratic National Convention but did not attend the convention itself. His followers sang songs insulting Democratic nominee John Kerry. Later in the campaign his followers heckled Kerry and disrupted his rallies.

He held a media conference in which he declared his support for John Kerry and pledged to mobilize his organization to help defeat George W. Bush in the November presidential election.

===2016===
On October 17, 2016, LaRouchePAC advised readers to write in Lyndon LaRouche and Alexander Hamilton in the 2016 Presidential elections. In the article &quot;What We Need in 2016: — Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s Principles, LaRouche&#x27;s Four Laws&quot;, the PAC wrote &quot;American citizens should write in LaRouche&#x27;s name at the presidential ballot box to stand for the re-adoption of Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s economic principles, as LaRouche has reclarified them. &quot;I&#x27;m writing in LaRouche and Alexander Hamilton, let&#x27;s get the nation to elect the right principles&quot; will cut through the dread with which Americans are questioning each other about the approach of Election Day.&quot;

This exhortation was disseminated by PAC members through social media. No verifiable statistics have been assembled concerning vote totals.

The LaRouche campaign alleged that the FEC had launched investigations to harass the campaign, producing a &quot;chilling effect on the free association rights of the campaign&#x27;s contributors,&quot; and that the FEC had gone beyond the prescribed scope of its investigations.

In 2004, the FEC dismissed a complaint filed by LaRouche associate Barbara M. Boyd against LaRouche Watch, an online forum, and Red Letter Press, a publishing house affiliated with the Freedom Socialist Party. The Commission found &quot;no reason to believe&quot; that the forum was a political action committee, or that it was subsidized by Red Letter Press, as alleged by Boyd.

<doc id="1023801" wikidata="Q917385" url="?curid=1023801" title="Lake Benmore">
<text>Lake Benmore is New Zealand&#x27;s largest artificial lake. Located in the South Island of New Zealand and part of the Waitaki River, it was created in the 1960s by construction of Benmore Dam.

== Characteristics ==
The lake has an area of about 75 km² and a maximum depth of 90 meters. The lake consists of two arms: the Haldon arm, fed mainly by the Tekapo, Pukaki and Twizel rivers, and the Ōhau Canal; and the Ahuriri Arm, fed mainly by the Ahuriri River. Immediately downstream is Lake Aviemore.

As of 2023, Land Air Water Aotearoa described the water quality as &quot;very good&quot;, with a trophic level index of 1.8. It also described the quality of ecological conditions as &quot;high&quot;, with a lake submerged plant indicators score of 72.0%.

The lake is split between the Mackenzie, Waimate, and Waitaki districts, within the southern portion of the Canterbury Region.

== Construction ==
The lake is the reservoir of Benmore Dam, New Zealand&#x27;s largest earth dam, which was created as part of the Waitaki hydroelectricity power scheme. Construction of Benmore Dam was approved in 1957 and the lake was filled in December 1964.

After the lake was created the incidence of seismic shocks increased by a factor of three to six times.

== Uses ==
Besides being a reservoir for Benmore Dam, the lake is a fishing spot; in 2009 it was the second most-fished lake in New Zealand, with fish such as brown trout, rainbow trout, chinook salmon, and sockeye salmon. Fish in the lake include salmon that have escaped from salmon farms on nearby hydro canals. The lake is also used for swimming and camping and there are walks in the area.

<doc id="1023819" wikidata="Q3360794" url="?curid=1023819" title="Caelus">
<text>Caelus or Coelus (; ) was a primordial god of the sky in Roman mythology and theology, iconography, and literature (compare &quot;caelum&quot;, the Latin word for &quot;sky&quot; or &quot;heaven&quot;, hence English &quot;celestial&quot;). The deity&#x27;s name usually appears in masculine grammatical form when he is conceived of as a male generative force.

==Identity==
The name of Caelus indicates that he was the Roman counterpart of the Greek god Uranus (Οὐρανός, &quot;Ouranos&quot;), who was of major importance in the theogonies of the Greeks, and the Jewish god Yahweh. Varro couples him with Terra (Earth) as &quot;pater et mater&quot; (father and mother), and says that they are &quot;great deities&quot; (&quot;dei magni&quot;) in the theology of the mysteries at Samothrace. Although Caelus is not known to have had a cult at Rome, not all scholars consider him a Greek import given a Latin name; he has been associated with Summanus, the god of nocturnal thunder, as &quot;purely Roman.&quot;

Caelus begins to appear regularly in Augustan art and in connection with the cult of Mithras during the Imperial era. Vitruvius includes him among celestial gods whose temple-buildings &quot;(aedes)&quot; should be built open to the sky. As a sky god, he became identified with Jupiter, as indicated by an inscription that reads &quot;Optimus Maximus Caelus Aeternus Iup&lt;pi&gt;ter&quot;.

==Genealogy==
According to Cicero and Hyginus, Caelus was the son of Aether and Dies (&quot;Day&quot; or &quot;Daylight&quot;). Caelus and Dies were in this tradition the parents of Mercury. With Trivia, Caelus was the father of the distinctively Roman god Janus, as well as of Saturn and Ops. Caelus was also the father of one of the three Jupiters, the fathers of the other two being Aether and Saturn instead. In one tradition, Caelus was the father with Tellus of the Muses, though this was probably a mere translation of &quot;Ouranos&quot; from a Greek source.

==Myth and allegory==
Caelus substituted for Uranus in Latin versions of the myth of Saturn (Cronus) castrating his heavenly father, from whose severed genitals, cast upon the sea, the goddess Venus (Aphrodite) was born. In his work &quot;On the Nature of the Gods&quot;, Cicero presents a Stoic allegory of the myth in which the castration signifies &quot;that the highest heavenly aether, that seed-fire which generates all things, did not require the equivalent of human genitals to proceed in its generative work.&quot; For Macrobius, the severing marks off Chaos from fixed and measured Time (Saturn) as determined by the revolving Heavens (Caelum). The &quot;semina rerum&quot; (&quot;seeds&quot; of things that exist physically) come from Caelum and are the elements which create the world.

The divine spatial abstraction &quot;Caelum&quot; is a for Olympus as a metaphorical heavenly abode of the divine, both identified with and distinguished from the mountain in ancient Greece named as the home of the gods. Varro says that the Greeks call Caelum (or Caelus) &quot;Olympus.&quot; As a representation of space, Caelum is one of the components of the &quot;mundus&quot;, the &quot;world&quot; or &quot;cosmos&quot;, along with &quot;terra&quot; (earth), &quot;mare&quot; (sea), and &quot;aer&quot; (air). In his work on the cosmological systems of antiquity, the Dutch Renaissance humanist Gerardus Vossius deals extensively with Caelus and his duality as both a god and a place that the other gods inhabit.

The ante-Nicene Christian writer Lactantius routinely uses the Latin Caelus, Saturn, and Jupiter to refer to the three divine hypostases of the Neoplatonic school of Plotinus: the First God (Caelus), Intellect (Saturn), and Soul, son of the Intelligible (Jupiter).

==In art==
It is generally, though not universally, agreed that Caelus is depicted on the cuirass of the &quot;Augustus of Prima Porta&quot;, at the very top above the four horses of the Sun god&#x27;s &quot;quadriga&quot;. He is a mature, bearded man who holds a cloak over his head so that it billows in the form of an arch, a conventional sign of deity &quot;(velificatio)&quot; that &quot;recalls the vault of the firmament.&quot; He is balanced and paired with the personification of Earth at the bottom of the cuirass. (These two figures have also been identified as Saturn and the Magna Mater, to represent the new Saturnian &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Augustan ideology.) On an altar of the Lares now held by the Vatican, Caelus in his chariot appears along with Apollo-Sol above the figure of Augustus.

==Nocturnus and the &quot;templum&quot;==
As &quot;Caelus Nocturnus&quot;, he was the god of the night-time, starry sky. In a passage from Plautus, Nocturnus is regarded as the opposite of Sol, the Sun god. Nocturnus appears in several inscriptions found in Dalmatia and Italy, in the company of other deities who are found also in the cosmological schema of Martianus Capella, based on the Etruscan tradition. In the Etruscan discipline of divination, Caelus Nocturnus was placed in the sunless north opposite to Sol to represent the polar extremities of the axis (see &quot;cardo&quot;). This alignment was fundamental to the drawing of a &quot;templum&quot; (sacred space) for the practice of augury. 

==Mithraic syncretism==
The name &quot;Caelus&quot; occurs in dedicatory inscriptions in connection to the cult of Mithras. The Mithraic Caelus is sometimes depicted allegorically as an eagle bending over the sphere of heaven marked with symbols of the planets or the zodiac. In a Mithraic context he is associated with Cautes and can appear as &quot;Caelus Aeternus&quot; (&quot;Eternal Sky&quot;). A form of Ahura-Mazda is invoked in Latin as &quot;Caelus Aeternus Iupiter&quot;. The walls of some mithrea feature allegorical depictions of the cosmos with Oceanus and Caelus. The mithraeum of Dieburg represents the tripartite world with Caelus, Oceanus, and Tellus below Phaeton-Heliodromus.

==Jewish syncretism==
Some Roman writers used Caelus or Caelum as a way to express the monotheistic god of Judaism (Yahweh). Juvenal identifies the Jewish God with Caelus as the highest heaven &quot;(summum caelum)&quot;, saying that Jews worship the &quot;numen&quot; of Caelus; Petronius uses similar language. Florus has a passage describing the Holy of Holies in the Temple of Jerusalem as housing a &quot;sky&quot; &quot;(caelum)&quot; under a golden vine. A golden vine, perhaps the one mentioned, was sent by the Hasmonean king Aristobulus to Pompeius Magnus after his defeat of Jerusalem, and was later displayed in the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus.

<text>Waitaki District is a territorial authority district that is located in the Canterbury and Otago regions of the South Island of New Zealand. It straddles the traditional border between the two regions, the Waitaki River, and its seat is Oamaru.

==History==
Waitaki District is made up of the former Waitaki County, Waihemo County and Oamaru Borough, which were amalgamated in 1989. It is governed by the Waitaki District Council.

==Name==
During the colonial period, the area was also known as &quot;Molesworth&quot;. However, the Māori name &quot;Waitaki&quot; eventually prevailed.

==Geography==
It has a land area of , of which or 59.02% is in the Canterbury Region and or 40.98% in the Otago Region. It is the only district in the South Island that lies in two regions.

A major reason for this split was the governance of the Waitaki River, which forms a political boundary between Canterbury and Otago. With major hydro schemes on this river, it was decided to place the entire catchment in one administrative region, thus forming the split. Some people who fall into the Canterbury Region of Waitaki District still regard themselves as part of Otago, and attempts have been made in the past to change the boundary. The district, which is agricultural by nature, comprises the wide alluvial fan of the river, and runs inland along the banks of the river, forming a roughly triangular region.

===Urban areas and settlements===
Oamaru, the district seat, is the only town in the Waitaki district with a population over 1,000. It is home to people, % of the district&#x27;s population.

==Economy==
A relatively sparsely settled area, the District has a large number of farms. However, in recent times (late 2000s), numerous proposals for new farming operations have locals fearing that the agriculture will be transformed from often family-held farms to large agribusiness operations, causing local ecological damage and siphoning off capital overseas.

<doc id="1023825" wikidata="Q835385" url="?curid=1023825" title="Washington State Route 16">
<text>State Route 16 (SR 16) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Washington, connecting Pierce and Kitsap counties. The highway, signed as east–west, begins at an interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5) in Tacoma and travels through the city as a freeway towards the Tacoma Narrows. SR 16 crosses the narrows onto the Kitsap Peninsula on the partially tolled Tacoma Narrows Bridge and continues through Gig Harbor and Port Orchard before the freeway ends in Gorst. The designation ends at an intersection with SR 3 southwest of the beginning of its freeway through Bremerton and Poulsbo. SR 16 is designated as a Strategic Highway Network (STRAHNET) corridor within the National Highway System as the main thoroughfare connecting Tacoma to Naval Base Kitsap and a part of the Highways of Statewide Significance program.

SR 16 was created during the 1964 state highway renumbering as the successor to Primary State Highway 14 (PSH 14). PSH 14, which had itself been the successor to State Road 14, traveled northeast from Shelton to Gorst and south to Gig Harbor. PSH 14 was extended over the Tacoma Narrows in 1939 on the unfinished Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which would later collapse months after opening in 1940, into Tacoma over Secondary State Highway 14C (SSH 14C). SR 16 has been expanded into a freeway in stages beginning with the original Nalley Valley Viaduct in Tacoma in 1971, and ending with the opening of an interchange near Port Orchard in 2009. Later improvements to the corridor include the installation of high-occupancy vehicle lanes that connect to I-5 and the rest of the freeway network in Pierce County, which were completed in 2019.

==Route description==
SR 16 begins as an elevated freeway at an interchange with I-5 in Tacoma southwest of downtown. The interchange includes direct ramps for a set of high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) and collector–distributor lanes as it travels over South Tacoma Way and a railroad that carries Sound Transit&#x27;s Sounder commuter train. SR 16 intersects Sprague Avenue at an interchange and turns west, passing a golf course and Cheney Stadium. A parallel pedestrian and cycling path, the Scott Pierson Trail, runs along the north side of the freeway. At a partial interchange with Center Street near Fircrest, SR 16 turns northwest and travels around the Tacoma Community College campus to an interchange with North Pearl Street (SR 163), which provides access to Ruston and the Vashon Island ferry.

SR 16 continues west past a partial cloverleaf interchange with Jackson Avenue and towards the Tacoma Narrows on the twin-suspension Tacoma Narrows Bridges. The westbound span and the tolled eastbound span combine to carry six lanes of SR 16 onto the Kitsap Peninsula. The eastbound span is tolled via electronic toll collection through the &quot;Good to Go&quot; program on the Kitsap Peninsula side of the bridge. Tolls for two axle vehicles and motorcycles are set at $4.50 for Good to Go accounts, $5.50 collected at the toll plaza, and $6.50 for Pay by Mail, with prices increasing for each additional axle by $2.25 for Good to Go accounts, $2.75 for toll plaza users, and $3.25 for Pay by Mail users.

SR 16 continues onto the Kitsap Peninsula and intersects 24th Street in a partial diamond interchange east of the Tacoma Narrows Airport as it passes the toll plaza for the eastbound Tacoma Narrows Bridge. The freeway travels northwest through Gig Harbor past interchanges with Olympic Drive and Wollochet Drive near Gig Harbor High School before it reaches Henderson Bay. SR 16 continues through an interchange with Burnham Drive and past the Washington Corrections Center for Women and St. Anthony Hospital towards Purdy, intersecting the southern terminus of SR 302. The freeway bypasses Purdy and Peninsula High School to the east before intersecting SR 302 Spur and entering Kitsap County. SR 16 passes the community of Burley and intersects its main access highway, Burley-Olalla Road, in an interchange before entering the city of Port Orchard. The freeway ends after serving as the western terminus of SR 160 and SR 166 on the west side of the city. The four-lane highway continues west along the Sinclair Inlet into Gorst, intersecting its spur route and ending at an intersection with SR 3.

Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2012, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 16 was west of its interchange with Union Avenue in downtown Tacoma, serving 112,000 vehicles, while the least busiest section is after the SR 160 interchange west of Port Orchard, serving 32,000 vehicles. SR 16 is designated as a Strategic Highway Network corridor, connecting Naval Base Kitsap to the state highway system along with SR 3, within the National Highway System that classifies it as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. WSDOT designates the entire route of SR 16 as a Highway of Statewide Significance, which includes highways that connect major communities in the state of Washington.

==History==
The present route of SR 16 roughly follows the route of several state highways signed during the 20th century, the first of which was State Road 14. State Road 14 traveled north from Shelton to Gorst and south into Gig Harbor as the primary connector between the Olympic and Kitsap peninsulas. Its construction had been proposed by Pierce County in the 1910s to connect Gig Harbor to the Navy Yard Highway, which was under construction at the time. State Road 14 was re-designated in 1937 as PSH 14 and included a secondary highway named SSH 14C that traveled from Gig Harbor to the Tacoma Narrows, site of an under-construction suspension bridge to open in 1940. PSH 14 was extended southeast over SSH 14C and the unfinished Tacoma Narrows Bridge into the city of Tacoma as part of a transfer of bridge ownership to the state of Washington in 1939. After the collapse of the original bridge on November 7, 1940, PSH 14 was truncated to Gig Harbor and traffic was redirected to a ferry landing in Manchester. The second Tacoma Narrows Bridge was opened on October 14, 1950, and PSH 14 was extended the following year to an intersection with U.S. Route 99 (US 99) in Downtown Tacoma.

PSH 14 was replaced by SR 16 under the sign route system created during the 1964 state highway renumbering, traveling from US 99 in Tacoma to SR 3 in Gorst. WSDOT began converting the SR 16 corridor to a controlled-access freeway with the construction of the Nalley Valley Viaduct in 1969, designed with tetrapod columns at a cost of $3.67 million. The viaduct opened on October 29, 1971, and connected SR 16 to I-5 in Tacoma, part of a new freeway replacing Bantz Boulevard between I-5 and the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. A bypass of Purdy on the Pierce–Kitsap county line was opened in November 1978 and the former route of SR 16 was divided between SR 302 and its spur route. The remainder of SR 16 in Port Orchard was upgraded to a freeway during the 1980s; however, at-grade intersections remained at Mullenix Road until 1993 and Burley-Olalla Road until 2009. Two at-grade intersection remain to access businesses and a cemetery from the westbound lanes north of the Wollochet Drive interchange.

WSDOT began installation of high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) on SR 16 as part of a Pierce County HOV system, which was constructed from 2000 to 2022 across several freeways. Beginning in the early 2000s, frontage roads and the Scott Pierson Trail were built along the freeway and sound walls were erected near residential areas in Tacoma. From Tacoma to Gig Harbor, WSDOT began installing exit numbers to interchanges with SR 16 that correspond to its milepost. The Nalley Valley Viaduct was replaced by a new westbound structure in 2011, carrying all four lanes of SR 16 towards I-5 in Tacoma, while the original viaduct was closed and demolished. The eastbound Nalley Valley Viaduct began construction in November 2011 and was completed by WSDOT in January 2014. The third viaduct, carrying HOV lanes, began construction in 2017 and was completed in November 2019.

On February 23, 2016, a section of SR 16 from the Kitsap–Pierce county line to Gorst was dedicated as the Tony Radulescu Memorial Highway, in honor of a Washington State Patrol trooper who was killed on that stretch of highway four years earlier.

The northern terminus of SR 16 in Gorst is a major traffic bottleneck and forms a gap between the two main freeways on the Kitsap Peninsula. A proposal to rebuild the intersection into a grade-separated interchange was considered in 2019 but did not move forward in a legislative session. A rebuilt interchange, estimated to cost around $500 million, has been sought to improve access to Bremerton National Airport and local military installations.

===Tacoma Narrows Bridge===

The Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which carries SR 16 across the Tacoma Narrows between Tacoma and the Kitsap Peninsula, was first proposed by locals during the late 19th century—the earliest being local rancher John G. Shindler while traveling through the Narrows by steamboat in 1888. The Northern Pacific Railway planned to build a trestle bridge over the Narrows to connect its western terminus in Tacoma to the proposed Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Port Orchard. The Washington State Legislature, after extensive lobbying by local auto groups and businesses, authorized the construction of a road bridge over the Narrows in February 1929. The Washington Toll Bridge Authority was created in March 1937 to construct and maintain toll bridges throughout the state, beginning with the Tacoma Narrows Bridge from Tacoma to Gig Harbor and the Lake Washington Floating Bridge from Seattle to Mercer Island.

The bridge, designed by American suspension bridge engineer Leon Moisseiff, began construction on November 23, 1938, by the Pacific-General-Columbia Company, a partnership between three companies that received a $2.88 million grant from the Public Works Administration and a $3.52 million loan from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, to be repaid through tolls. The Tacoma Narrows Bridge opened on July 1, 1940, and included ceremonies attended by an estimated 10,000 people, including Governor of Washington Clarence D. Martin. The bridge, christened the name &quot;Galloping Gertie&quot; by its construction workers, cost $6.4 million to build and became the third longest suspension span in the world after its completion. The following day, the art deco MV &quot;Kalakala&quot; was chosen to make the commemorative final ferry crossing of the Tacoma Narrows. The original toll for the bridge cost 55 cents per car, 15 cents per extra passenger, and 15 cents for pedestrians. The bridge, which was prone to movement during windstorms, collapsed at approximately 11:00 am on November 7, 1940, because of winds in excess of . The only fatality during the collapse was a dog trapped in a car belonging to local reporter Leonard Coatsworth of Tacoma.

A second, Tacoma Narrows Bridge was constructed between 1948 and 1951, officially opening to traffic on October 14, 1950. The bridge was designed to let wind pass through the structure with perforated girders and open grating in the deck. Traffic on the four-lane bridge began increasing from 6,000 vehicles in 1960 to nearly 67,000 vehicles by 1990, according to WSDOT AADT data. The increased traffic prompted the Washington State Legislature to approve the construction of a tolled eastbound bridge in 1999, to be finished during the early 2000s. The eastbound bridge was constructed between 2002 and 2007, opening on July 15, 2007, during ceremonies attended by 60,000 people, including Governor Christine Gregoire. The newer eastbound bridge provided the debut for the Good to Go RFID pass from WSDOT, which allows frequent users to bypass the toll booths by way of a prepaid transponder placed on the inside of the windshield and reducing the toll.
==Special routes==

===Spur route===
SR 16 has a spur route located in Gorst that travels west from SR 16 to southbound SR 3. The spur route was added to the state highway system in 1988 after SR 16 was re-aligned to avoid traffic signals in Gorst. WSDOT included the road in its annual AADT survey in 2012 and calculated that between 4,100 and 8,600 vehicles used the spur route.
===Alternate route===
SR 16 AR is an unsigned alternate route serving traffic passing through the eastbound toll plaza (rather than using electronic toll collection) approaching the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in Pierce County. The route was added to the state highway system in 2007 after the completion of the eastbound Tacoma Narrows Bridge on July 15. WSDOT included the road in its annual AADT survey in 2012 and calculated that 9,100 vehicles used the alternate route.

<text>L. John Doerr (born June 29, 1951) is an American investor and venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins in Menlo Park, California. In February 2009, Doerr was appointed a member of the President&#x27;s Economic Recovery Advisory Board to provide the President and his administration with advice and counsel in trying to fix America&#x27;s economic downturn. &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Doerr as the 40th richest person in tech in 2017, and as of August 1, 2023, as the 146th richest person in the world, with a net worth of US$11.9 billion. Doerr is the author of &quot;Measure What Matters,&quot; a book about goal-setting, and &quot;Speed &amp; Scale: An Action Plan for Solving Our Climate Crisis Now&quot;.

In 2022, John and his wife Ann collaborated with Stanford University to launch its first new school in about 70 years: Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability.

==Early life==
Doerr was born in St. Louis, Missouri. One of five siblings, Doerr graduated from Chaminade College Preparatory School in St. Louis. Doerr obtained a B.S. and an M.E.E. degree in electrical engineering from Rice University and an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1976.

==Career==
Doerr joined Intel Corporation in 1974 just as the firm was developing the 8080 8-bit microprocessor. He eventually became one of Intel&#x27;s most successful salespeople. He also holds several patents for memory devices. In 1980, Doerr was offered a job with Kleiner Perkins. Intel president Andrew Grove told him, &quot;John, venture capital, that&#x27;s not a real job. It&#x27;s like being a real estate agent.&quot;

He joined Kleiner Perkins that year, and since then has directed the distribution of venture capital funding to technology companies including Compaq, Netscape, Symantec, Sun Microsystems, drugstore.com, Amazon.com, Intuit, Macromedia, and Google.

Doerr has backed entrepreneurs, including Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt of Google; Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com; and Scott Cook and Bill Campbell of Intuit.

===Venture funding===
Doerr co-founded and serves on the board of the New Schools Venture Fund, an education reform and charter public schools fund, and TechNet, a policy network of high-tech CEOs advocating education and litigation reform, and policies for the innovation economy. Doerr co-chaired California&#x27;s Proposition 39 which lowered the threshold to approved school bonds, and Proposition 71 which created $3 billion in funding for California research into stem cell therapies. He serves on the board of Bono&#x27;s ONE campaign to fight global poverty, particularly disease in Africa. His success in venture capital has garnered national attention; he has been listed on &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s exclusive &quot;Midas List&quot; and is widely regarded as one of the top technology venture capitalists in the world.

Doerr advocates innovation in clean energy technologies to combat climate change and has written and testified on the topic. In a 2007 TED conference, he cited his daughter&#x27;s remark, &quot;your generation created this problem, you better fix it&quot;, as a call to fight global warming.

In 2008, he announced with Steve Jobs the Kleiner Perkins $100 million iFund, declaring the iPhone &quot;more important than the personal computer&quot; because &quot;it knows who you are&quot; and &quot;where you are.&quot; In April 2010, he along with other iFund members announced an increase in iFund&#x27;s value by another $100 million, making iFund the world&#x27;s biggest investment pool in the cell phone application industry.

He currently serves on the boards of Google, Watershed, Amyris Biotech, Tradesy, ASAPP, and Zynga. Doerr led Kleiner Perkins&#x27;s $150 million investment in Twitter in 2012.

In 2013, he invested in DreamBox, which has been acquired by Charter School Growth Fund. He had also funded the initial investments in Bloom Energy Inc. Doerr is a major backer of the education company Remind.

In 2016, Doerr stepped down from his role leading Kleiner Perkins, ceding leadership to Ted Schlein.

Doerr mentored Ellen Pao when she first joined Kleiner Perkins. Before changing his mind in 2012, he was known for challenging those who gave her negative performance reviews.

Doerr serves on the board of the Obama Foundation and ONE.org.

==Economic Recovery Advisory Board==
In February 2009, Doerr was appointed as a member of the USA Economic Recovery Advisory Board by President Barack Obama to provide the President and his administration with advice and counsel in fixing America&#x27;s economic downturn.

==Personal life==
Doerr is married to Ann Howland Doerr. They live in Woodside, California, with their two children.

In August 2010, they signed the Giving Pledge, a campaign set up by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and Warren Buffett to get ultra-high-net-worth individuals to donate their fortunes to charitable causes within their lifetime.

In 1997, Doerr was named a Distinguished Alumnus of Rice University for his accomplishments in business. In 2009, Doerr was named a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences. In 2010, Doerr was inducted into the California Hall of Fame. In 2019, Doerr received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

He is also member of the Global Advisory Board of Khan Academy.

On May 4, 2022, Stanford University announced Ann and John Doerr&#x27;s donation of $1.1 billion to establish the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. The gift is the second largest to an academic institution—the first being Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s $1.8 billion gift to Johns Hopkins University. It is the largest gift to Stanford in the university&#x27;s history.

==Politics==
Doerr is a supporter of the Democratic Party and has hosted fundraisers for the party on several occasions. Along with Mark Zuckerberg and Reid Hoffman, John Doerr was a co-founder of FWD.us, a lobbying group focused on immigration reform, improvements in education, and scientific research.

<text>The tankini is a bathing suit combining a tank top, mostly made of spandex-and-cotton or Lycra-and-nylon, and a bikini bottom introduced in the late 1990s. This type of swimwear is considered by some to provide the coverage of a one-piece suit with the convenience of a two-piece suit, as the entire suit need not be removed in order to use a toilet. Tankinis come in a variety of styles, colors, and shapes, and some include features such as integrated push-up bras. It is particularly popular as children&#x27;s beachwear, and is considered an athletic outfit fit for a triathlon. According to Katherine Betts, &quot;Vogue&#x27;s&quot; fashion-news director, this amphibious sportswear for sand or sea lets users go rafting, play volleyball, and swim without worrying about losing their tops.

A tank top consists of a sleeveless shirt with low neck and adjustable shoulder straps that vary in width and style. It is named after &quot;tank suits&quot;, the one-piece bathing costumes of the 1920s that were worn in &#x27;tanks&#x27; or swimming pools. The upper garment is worn either by men or women, having a greater variety of models available for women. In men it is usually used as underwear.

==Etymology==
According to author William Safire, &quot;The most recent evolution of the &quot;-kini&quot; family is the tankini, a cropped tank top supported by spaghetti-like strings.&quot; The tankini is distinguished from the classic bikini by the difference in tops, the top of the tankini essentially being a tank top. The tankini top extends downward to somewhere between just above the navel and the top of the hips. The word is a portmanteau of the &#x27;tank&#x27; of &#x27;tank top&#x27; and the -kini suffix of &#x27;bikini&#x27;. This go-between nature of the tankini has, in turn, given its name to things ranging from a lemonade-based martini (&quot;Tankini Martini&quot;) to server architecture (&quot;Tankini HipThread&quot;). The &quot;Language Report&quot;, compiled by lexicographer Susie Dent and published by the Oxford University Press (OUP) in 2003, considers lexicographic inventions like bandeaukini and camkini, two variants of the tankini, important to observe.

==History==

Tankini and the concept of mix-and-match swimwear were the two major innovations in that genre in the late 1990s. Designer Anne Cole, the US swimwear mogul, was the originator of this style. She was the woman behind the California swimwear label bearing her name, an offshoot of her family&#x27;s swimsuit company. Called by some the first major innovation in women&#x27;s swimsuits for decades, Cole&#x27;s two-piece, which blended the &#x27;freedom&#x27; of a bikini with the coverage of a one-piece bathing suit, soon captured nearly a third of the swimwear market. Her tankini, first devised by Cole for herself as a young girl, came out in 1998. Aimed at &quot;closing a gap in the swimwear market, the popularity of tankini largely came from Cole&#x27;s tapping into women&#x27;s anxieties about swimwear.&quot; In the six seasons following its introduction, tankinis diversified in style and range, variations being offered by designers like Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan, Nautica, and Calvin Klein. In 2005, a controversy broke out when Buddhists complained about swimwear manufacturer Ondade Mar and lingerie company Victoria&#x27;s Secret marketing tankinis with Buddhist iconography. In the same year, Nike&#x27;s breast cancer awareness swimwear collection featured four different cuts of tankini.

==Usage==
Tankinis are suggested as an option for women who have gone through mastectomy, i.e. removal of one or both breasts by surgery, women who have modest bust sizes, and long torsos. For women who do not have &#x27;washboard abs&#x27;, Betts commented, &quot;If you don&#x27;t feel comfortable wearing a bikini, the tankini&#x27;s an option that&#x27;s sort of in between.&quot; In &quot;Think &amp; Date Like a Man&quot;, fashion writer April Masini suggests the tankini is the most flattering choice of beachwear, with the right amount of coverage along with the feeling of a two-piece suit. A not-too-close-fitting tankini, ensembled with a sarong, has been suggested for gymnophobia or the fear of nudity. Tankinis, sometimes divided in the front exposing the navel, exist for pregnant women.

==Variants==

Gucci&#x27;s crystal-studded tankini, on the May 1998 covers of both &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; was as expensive as US$2,425, while bargain tankinis were available at less than US$10. Variations of the tankini, made mostly of spandex-and-cotton or Lycra-and-nylon, have been added by designers and retailers, chiefly Cole of California and Mervyns in the US, to maximize the tankini sales. Fashion guides also suggest tankini-style wedding dresses for brides of certain body types, such as women who are athletic and have long legs.

===Camkini===
A camkini is a tankini with the spaghetti straps of a camisole top, over a bikini bottom. Ebony Fashion Fair&#x27;s traveling fashion show in 2000 presented camikinis as one of the top trends that year. Point Sol, a fashion house, offers higher-waist bottoms and a sports camisole as a more sports-oriented swimsuit style for volleyball and in-line skating.

<text>Tom Bender (September 24, 1941 – March 4, 2020) was one of the American founders of the green architecture and sustainability movements.

==Life==
Thomas Guernsey Bender was born in 1941 in Fostoria, Ohio. He began to make his mark in the early 1970s as an educator, architect, historian of non-Western architecture, author, and strategic planner. He has since been visible also in the emerging field of sustainable economics.

His research, writing, and architectural design since the 1970s was to development of the relatively new field of solar and ecological architectural design. Bender was an associate professor of architecture in the University of Minnesota, and the Project Ouroboros he co-directed there with Dennis Holloway in the early 1970s was one of the first demonstrations of &quot;resource-self-reliant houses.&quot;

Like Amory Lovins and some other modern analysts, Bender demonstrated the feasibility and benefit of major reduction of energy usage (often through the decrease of on-site energy wastage) rather than a massive increase of centralized energy-production facilities in a society.

Tom Bender moved to Oregon in 1974 to serve as an energy researcher for Governor Tom McCall during the early 1970s energy crisis. Cosmic Economics, which he co-authored, showed the hazards of dependence on fossil fuels, the role of peak oil in global warming, and the benefits of extraction taxes for fossil fuels and minerals.

The term &quot;sustainability&quot; which he coined in his 1975 essay, Sharing Smaller Pies, has become core to current progressive cultural perspectives. During that decade, Bender was also the co-editor of &quot;&quot;. As a theorist and practitioner of the &quot;green&quot; approach to planning and design, he has been a popular essayist since that time.

These principles have received interest from governments of Austria, the Netherlands, and Norway, as well as endorsement by the European Union, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, and UNEP.

In local application demonstrating these concepts, he has been a co-founder of Fire Mountain School, the Lower Nehalem Community Trust, NeahCasa, and the local community center.[3][4] He lived on Neahkahnie Mountain, on the Oregon coast and designed many residencies and public buildings in the surrounding communities. Many of his writings are available on his website.

Bender died on March 4, 2020, in the home he and his partner constructed on Neahkahnie Mountain, near Manzanita Oregon.

<text>Giacomo Gates (born September 14, 1950) is an American jazz vocalist.

==Career==
Gates was born and raised in Connecticut. His father was a classical violinist. He made his public debut as a vocalist at the age of six. Soon after, he picked up guitar. In his youth he listened to jazz stations broadcasting from New York City, learned about jazz from disc jockeys, and played along on guitar. When he was ten, he bought his first jazz album, &quot;Time Out&quot; by Dave Brubeck. Between radio and his record collection, he listened to many of the biggest names in jazz. He took a particular interest in vocalists, such as Perry Como, Bing Crosby, Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra. As he got older, he admired Mose Allison, Cab Calloway, Betty Carter, Babs Gonzales, Al Hibbler, Eddie Jefferson, Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross, Carmen McRae, Mark Murphy, Anita O&#x27;Day, Louis Prima, Martha Raye, Keely Smith, Sarah Vaughan, and Joe Williams.

After graduating from high school, he went to college but dropped out after a year. He found work on a road crew as a laborer, then drove dump trucks and heavier vehicles like bulldozers. Gates moved to Alaska to work on the Alaska Pipeline, intending to stay only a year but remaining for twelve. While performing at a jazz festival in Fairbanks, he was approached by Sarah Vaughan, who encouraged him to leave Alaska and pursue a singing career. In 1990, at the age of forty, he moved back to Connecticut. Five years later, he released his first album, &quot;Blue Skies&quot; (DMP, 1995).

Gates interprets jazz standards, practices vocalese, and is active in jazz education. He has taught at Wesleyan University, the Hartford Conservatory of Music, and New Haven&#x27;s Neighborhood Music School. In his singing he tries to copy the sounds of instruments, such as flutes, trombones, and drums.

<doc id="1023857" wikidata="Q7233294" url="?curid=1023857" title="Positive set theory">
<text>In mathematical logic, positive set theory is the name for a class of alternative set theories in which the axiom of comprehension holds for at least the positive formulas formula_1 (the smallest class of formulas containing atomic membership and equality formulas and closed under conjunction, disjunction, existential and universal quantification).

Typically, the motivation for these theories is topological: the sets are the classes which are closed under a certain topology. The closure conditions for the various constructions allowed in building positive formulas are readily motivated (and one can further justify the use of universal quantifiers bounded in sets to get generalized positive comprehension): the justification of the existential quantifier seems to require that the topology be compact.

== Axioms ==

The set theory formula_2 of Olivier Esser consists of the following axioms:

=== Extensionality ===

formula_3

=== Positive comprehension ===

formula_4

where formula_1 is a &quot;positive formula&quot;. A positive formula uses only the logical constants formula_6 but not formula_7.

=== Closure ===

formula_8

where formula_1 is a formula. That is, for every formula formula_1, the intersection of all sets which contain every formula_11 such that formula_12 exists. This is called the closure of formula_13 and is written in any of the various ways that topological closures can be presented. This can be put more briefly if class language is allowed (any condition on sets defining a class as in NBG): for any class &quot;C&quot; there is a set which is the intersection of all sets which contain &quot;C&quot; as a subclass. This is a reasonable principle if the sets are understood as closed classes in a topology.

=== Infinity ===

The von Neumann ordinal formula_14 exists. This is not an axiom of infinity in the usual sense; if Infinity does not hold, the closure of formula_14 exists and has itself as its sole additional member (it is certainly infinite); the point of this axiom is that formula_14 contains no additional elements at all, which boosts the theory from the strength of second order arithmetic to the strength of Morse–Kelley set theory with the proper class ordinal a weakly compact cardinal.

== Interesting properties ==

* The universal set is a proper set in this theory.
* The sets of this theory are the collections of sets which are closed under a certain topology on the classes.
* The theory can interpret ZFC (by restricting oneself to the class of well-founded sets, which is not itself a set). It in fact interprets a stronger theory (Morse–Kelley set theory with the proper class ordinal a weakly compact cardinal).

<doc id="1023862" wikidata="Q48053" url="?curid=1023862" title="Kirill Moskalenko">
<text>Kirill Semyonovich Moskalenko (; , romanized: &quot;Kyrylo Semenovych Moskalenko&quot;; 11 May 1902 – 17 June 1985) was a Marshal of the Soviet Union. A member of the Soviet Army who fought in both the Russian Civil War and World War II, he later served as Commander in Chief of Strategic Missile Forces.

==Early life==
Moskalenko was born in the village of Grishino, Bakhmutsky Uyezd, Yekaterinoslav Governorate, Russian Empire (now in Pokrovsk Raion, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine), into a family of Ukrainian peasants. He graduated from a four-year primary rural school and two classes of the school of the ministerial school. From 1917 to 1919 he studied at an agricultural school in Bakhmut, where poet Volodymyr Sosiura studied at the same time according to his recollections. He was forced to interrupt his studies due to the outbreak of the Russian Civil War.

==Military career==
===Russian Civil War===
He returned to his native village, where he worked in the rural revolutionary committee. When the province of his village was seized by the troops of the Volunteer Army of General Anton Denikin, he hid because of the threat of execution. After the occupation of the village by the troops of the Red Army in August 1920, he joined their ranks.

Moskalenko fought in the civil war while serving as the member of the First Cavalry Army. He fought against the troops of General Pyotr Wrangel and Ataman Nestor Makhno.

===Post civil war===
He studied at the Luhansk Artillery School and at the 2nd Kharkov Artillery School. In May 1921, he was transferred to the artillery department of the Kharkov School of Red Officers, from which he graduated in 1922. Later, he graduated from the advanced training courses for the command personnel at the Red Army Artillery Academy in Leningrad and the faculty of advanced training for the higher command personnel of the Felix Dzerzhinsky Military Academy in Moscow Oblast. During his studies in Kharkov, as part of the school, he participated in battles against gangs in the Don and Donbas regions.

From 1922 to 1932 he served in the 6th Cavalry Division and First Cavalry Army, and platoon commander of the Cavalry Artillery Division. During his service in Armavir, he participated in battles against political banditry in the North Caucasus.

In September 1923, together with a military unit, he was transferred to Bryansk. From 1924, he served as a battery commander. He later served as commander of a training battery, artillery battalion, and chief of staff of an artillery regiment from 1928.

From 1932, he served as chief of staff and commander of a special cavalry division of the Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army near Chita. From 1934, he served commander of a cavalry regiment. Moskalenko commanded the 23rd Tank Brigade in Primorsky Krai from 1935. From 1936 he served in the 45th Mechanized Corps within the Kiev Military District.

===World War II===

During the Soviet-Finnish War, he was the commander of artillery for the 51st Rifle Division and was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. He successively chief of artillery of the 35th Rifle Corps and the 2nd Mechanized Corps in Chișinău and Tiraspol respectively.

When Operation Barbarossa began in June 1941, Moskalenko was the commander of an anti-tank brigade which was stationed in Lutsk. Between June 1941, and March 1942, Moskalenko first held command of the 1st Anti-Tank Brigade, 15th Rifle Corps, 6th Army, and later of the 6th Cavalry Corps. During this time, he took part in the defensive battles in Lutsk, Volodymyr-Volynskyi, Rovno, Torchyn, Novohrad-Volynskyi and Malyn. Moskalenko participated in the Kiev Strategic Defensive Operation and fought in battles near Teterev, Pripyat, Dnieper and Desna. During a month of continuous fighting, being in the direction of the main attack of the enemy Army Group South, the brigade destroyed more than 300 enemy tanks. For military successes, courage and bravery, he was awarded the Order of Lenin on 23 July 1941.

In December 1941, he was appointed deputy commander of the 6th Army of the Southwestern Front and acting commander of the army. The 6th Army under the command Moskalenko took part in the Barvenkovo-Lozovaya offensive and the liberation of the cities of Izium and Lozova. On 12 February 1942, he was appointed as commander of the 6th Cavalry Corps and from March to July 1942, he served as commander of the 38th Army. He was the commander of the newly reformed 38th Army from March to July 1942.
During the Battle of Stalingrad, he commanded the 1st Tank Army during which he participated in battles on the distant approaches to Stalingrad from July to August 1942. In August 1942, he was appointed commander of the 1st Guards Army until October 1942. At the very beginning of the defensive period of the Battle of Stalingrad, the 1st Tank Army attacked the enemy almost continuously for twelve days in a row and held back their advance. According to Moskalenko, at Kalach-on-Don, his army stopped the advance of German General Friedrich Paulus&#x27;s 6th Army to Stalingrad and almost won a month to organize defense in depth and pull up reserves. He was then appointed commander of the 1st Tank Army from July to August 1942 and the 1st Guards Army from August to October 1942 before finally receiving command of the 40th Army, which was separate from the Voronezh Front, a position he held until October 1943.

Moskalenko led his troops during the winter counteroffensive and during the Battle of Kursk. He participated in the Ostrogozhsk–Rossosh offensive, third battle of Kharkov and the battle of the Dnieper. Moskalenko was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union for heroism and courage when crossing the Dnieper and securing a bridgehead on its western bank.

From October 1943 until the end of the war, Moskalenko was the commander of the 38th Army. He led his troops as they helped drive the Germans from Ukraine, Poland, and Czechoslovakia.

===Post-World War II===

After the war, Moskalenko commanded the 38th Army, which was transferred to the Carpathian Military District. From August 1948, he served as commander of the Air Defense Forces of the Moscow Region. He served in various capacities in the Moscow Military District, before being appointed its Commanding General in 1953.

On 26 June 1953 the CPSU Secretary Khrushchev along with Marshals Georgy Zhukov and Kirill Moskalenko secretly arrested First Deputy Prime Minister of the USSR Beria during a joint CPSU Presidium and Cabinet meeting. While Zhukov could not carry a gun into the Kremlin, Moskalenko sneaked into the Kremlin with a gun to arrest Beria. During the next six months, he and Rudenko investigated the &quot;Beria Case&quot;. In December 1953 the Soviet Supreme Court found Beria guilty after a five-day proceeding. On December 23, Beria was shot. Another version states that Beria was shot by machine gun during the military assault on his residential compound in Moscow.

As a result of this operation, on 11 March 1955, Moskalenko, along with five other commanders, was given the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union. Moskalenko remained in the Moscow Military District until 1960, when he was made Commander-in-Chief of the Strategic Rocket Forces. Moskalenko owed his very rapid promotion to having served with Khrushchev during the war. In his memoirs, Khrushchev said:

Khrushchev also claimed to have been shocked by the virulence with which Moskalenko denounced Marshal Zhukov in 1957, when Khrushchev had decided to sack Zhukov, but even so, he remained in office until April 1962, when he was dismissed without any reason being given, and was made an Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense, an honorary post of no significance. The French journalist Michel Tatu, who was based in Moscow at the time, surmised that his fall was related to the Cuban Missile Crisis:

For his services in the development and strengthening of the Armed Forces of the USSR, he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union for the second time on 1978. From December 1983, he was part of the Group of Inspectors General of the USSR Ministry of Defense. 

Moskalenko died on 17 June 1985 in Moscow, at the age of 83. He is buried in Novodevichy Cemetery.

<text>The British Empire Range is a mountain range on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut, Canada. The range is one of the most northern ranges in the world and the Arctic Cordillera, surpassed only by the Challenger Mountains which lies immediately to the northwest and the United States Range slightly further east. The highest mountain in the range is Barbeau Peak.

The range was named by Gordon Noel Humphreys during the &quot;Oxford University Ellesmere Land Expedition&quot;. Edward Shackleton, also a member of the party, claimed, in 1937, that Humphreys had done so because he was &quot;a great imperialist&quot;.

Peaks of the range include:

<text>Gerald Hatten Buss (January 27, 1933 – February 18, 2013) was an American businessman, investor, chemist, and philanthropist. He was the majority owner of the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA), winning 10 league championships that were highlighted by the team&#x27;s Showtime era during the 1980s. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor. Buss owned other professional sports franchises in Southern California.

==Early life and business career==
Born in Salt Lake City, Buss and his three younger siblings were raised by their divorced mother, Jessie, who worked as a waitress. His father, Lydus, was an accountant who went on to teach statistics at Berkeley, who abandoned Buss after his first birthday and never returned. When he was nine years old, Buss moved with his mother to Los Angeles; three years later when she remarried, they then moved to Kemmerer, Wyoming and lived in a six-room home with his half-brother Mickey, his half-sister Susan, and stepbrother Jim. One of Buss&#x27; boyhood jobs was working for his stepfather, Cecil Brown, who owned a plumbing business. Other jobs in Buss&#x27; high school days included carrying bags at the Kemmerer Hotel (paid $2 per day), setting pins at the bowling alley, working on the Union Pacific Railroad, selling stamps, and shining shoes.

Buss earned a scholarship to the University of Wyoming, graduating with a BS degree in two and a half years in 1953. He then returned to Los Angeles and attended the University of Southern California (USC), where he earned an MS and PhD in physical chemistry in 1957 at the age of 24. Upon completion of his PhD, Buss moved to Boston and worked for Arthur D. Little. Buss started as a chemist for the Bureau of Mines (now the Mine Safety and Health Administration); he then briefly worked in the aerospace industry for McDonnell Douglas and was on the faculty of USC&#x27;s chemistry department.

Buss originally invested in real estate to provide supplementary income so he could continue teaching. His first investment was $1,000 in a 14-unit West Los Angeles apartment building in 1959. Finding great success in the real estate business, he, along with longtime business partner, Frank Mariani, formed real estate investment company Mariani-Buss Associates. In 1979, Buss purchased Pickfair, the Beverly Hills estate once owned by Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks; he sold it in 1987. Buss claimed his company owned—across Arizona, California and Nevada—roughly 700 properties by 1979.

In 1974, Buss produced a movie named &quot;Black Eye&quot; starring former gridiron star Fred &quot;the Hammer&quot; Williamson.

Buss was an owner of the Phoenix location of the Playboy Club.

===Sports team ownership===
Buss became an owner of the Los Angeles Strings in World Team Tennis. In 1979, he purchased the Los Angeles Lakers of the NBA, the Los Angeles Kings of the NHL, The Forum, and a 13,000-acre ranch in the Sierra Nevada from Jack Kent Cooke for $67.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Buss later sold his controlling interest in the Kings to Bruce McNall in 1988. He then reached a major advertising agreement with Great Western Bank for the naming rights to The Forum, resulting in the official name of the building being changed to the Great Western Forum.

Later, when the WNBA was formed in 1996, Buss took charge of operating that league&#x27;s Los Angeles franchise, the Los Angeles Sparks. Eventually, all three teams moved into a more modern arena in downtown Los Angeles, the Staples Center, which opened in 1999. As part of the deal to move the Lakers into Staples Center, Buss sold the Great Western Forum (which was later reverted to its original name).

The Lakers were very successful under Buss&#x27; ownership, winning 10 NBA championships with such players as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, James Worthy, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, Kobe Bryant, and Pau Gasol, and with coaches Paul Westhead, Pat Riley and Phil Jackson. He inspired the Lakers&#x27; Showtime era with his vision that basketball games must be entertaining. The Sparks also experienced their share of success, winning two WNBA championships with such players as Lisa Leslie, Tamecka Dixon and DeLisha Milton-Jones.

In 2002, when the WNBA was restructured to give its teams individual owners, Buss took ownership of the Sparks. He sold the team in 2006. Buss also owned the Los Angeles Lazers of the Major Indoor Soccer League. The Lazers also played in The Forum. The team folded in 1989 and the league folded three years later.

His contributions to basketball were recognized by his induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010. Buss received the Golden Plate Award from the American Academy of Achievement in 1983.

==Poker player==
Buss was a high-stakes cash game poker player for many years, but later in life was more active in tournament games. His best finishes included third in the 1991 World Series of Poker seven-card stud event and second place in the 2003 World Poker Tour Freeroll invitational. He also appeared in the GSN series &quot;High Stakes Poker&quot; and the NBC late-night series &quot;Poker After Dark&quot;.

==Jerry Buss&#x27;s entourage==

Beginning in the early 1980s, Jerry Buss was notoriously seen in and around Los Angeles at charitable events with his ever-present entourage of close friends who were infamously dubbed in the press as &quot;The Seven Dwarfs&quot;. Jerry&#x27;s inner circle entourage included John Rockwell, Ron and David Wilder, Miguel A. Nunez, Lance Davis, Mark Fulton, and Brian J. Sadler. This close-knit group of friends would often bid on charitable auction items that would help the causes of the events they attended. The Dwarfs were gifted championship rings when the Lakers won titles and were granted carte blanche access to all Laker home games and events at the Fabulous Forum / Great Western Forum / Staples Center. Professionally, The Dwarfs were outstanding contributors who held positions as special assistant, financial advisor, investment banker, ADPAC marketing executive. The Dwarfs were regular fixtures in and among the Showtime Lakers throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and until Jerry&#x27;s death in 2013.

== Philanthropy ==
In January 2008, Buss donated $7.5 million to USC&#x27;s Department of Chemistry to fund two endowed chairs and an endowed scholarship fund for chemistry graduate students; the two chairs were to be named after his mentors at USC, Professors Sidney Benson and David Dows. Buss was an inaugural member of the USC College Board of Councilors.

His philanthropy also extended to people associated with the Lakers. When former Lakers player Walt Hazzard, then an adviser to the team, suffered a catastrophic stroke in 1996, Buss kept Hazzard on the payroll and told Hazzard&#x27;s son that his father would remain a Lakers employee for as long as Buss owned the team. When Hazzard died in 2011, he was still a Lakers employee.

==Personal life==
Buss has seven known children. His marriage to the former JoAnn Mueller ended in divorce in 1972 after having five children: Lee (born 1953), Johnny (born 1956), Jim (born 1959), Jeanie (born 1961) and Janie (born 1963). Their oldest child, Lee, was put up for adoption shortly after birth. Buss allegedly married his second wife, Veronica Hoff, in 1972 while still married to his first wife, JoAnn. During his time as Lakers owner, Buss was widely known as a playboy and had a string of young girlfriends. Buss dated Debbie Zafrani, a Playboy bunny and the younger sister of the wife of Lakers player Kurt Rambis.

Buss had two more children with a girlfriend, Karen Demel: Joey (born 1985) and Jesse (born 1988). At the time of his death in 2013, six out of seven of his children worked in the Lakers organization.

In 1990, Buss reached a settlement out of court in a palimony suit filed by Puppi Buss, who said that she had an on-and-off relationship with Buss for 15 years, and also alleged that he fathered her son; details of the settlement were not revealed.

On May 29, 2007, Buss was issued a citation for driving under the influence after two California Highway Patrol officers saw him driving his gold Mercedes-Benz on the wrong side of the road in the coastal community of Carlsbad in northern San Diego County, with a 23-year-old woman passenger. After failing a field sobriety test, Buss was taken into custody, given a blood test, and booked on suspicion of driving while intoxicated with a blood-alcohol level over 0.08.

==Death==
In 2012, Buss was in a hospital for months with an undisclosed intestinal problem. Through his 80th birthday on January 27, 2013, he had not attended a Lakers game during the 2012–13 season due to health concerns. On February 14, 2013, four days before his death, it was revealed that Buss had been battling cancer since 2012.

After being hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center with an undisclosed form of cancer, he died of kidney failure on February 18, 2013, aged 80. On February 21, hundreds of friends, colleagues, and family members gathered to pay tribute to Buss in a televised memorial service at the Nokia Theatre L.A. Live, across from the Lakers&#x27; home court, Staples Center. Buss was buried on February 22 at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills in a private ceremony with family and close friends.

NBA commissioner David Stern said of Buss &quot;The NBA has lost a visionary owner whose influence on our league is incalculable and will be felt for decades to come&quot;. Lakers guard Kobe Bryant said &quot;His impact is felt worldwide,&quot; and called Buss &quot;the greatest owner in sports ever&quot;.

Buss&#x27;s 66% controlling ownership of the Lakers passed to his six children via a trust, with each child receiving an equal vote (11% for each child). His succession plan had daughter Jeanie assume his previous title as the Lakers&#x27; governor as well as its team representative at NBA Board of Governors meetings.

The 2013 World Series of Poker paid tribute to Buss before the $2,500 Seven Card Stud event.

<doc id="1023875" wikidata="Q7719048" url="?curid=1023875" title="The Bolitho novels">
<text>The &quot;Bolitho&quot; novels are a series of nautical war novels written by British author Douglas Reeman (using the pseudonym Alexander Kent). They focus on the military careers of the fictional Richard Bolitho and Adam Bolitho in the Royal Navy, from the time of the American Revolution past the Napoleonic Era.

==Richard Bolitho==

Richard Bolitho is a fictional Royal Navy officer who is the main character in Reeman&#x27;s novels. Bolitho was born in 1756 in Falmouth, Cornwall, in Great Britain, the second son of a prestigious naval family. He joined the navy in 1768 and served in the wars against France and the United States. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1774, captain in 1782, and admiral in 1812. He died in action against the French in 1815. He played a significant role in driving the Americans back to Brooklyn Heights in 1776, helping to secure a decisive British victory in the largest battle of the entire American Revolution.

The name Bolitho is a common Cornish surname, but Reeman says that he borrowed the name Richard Bolitho from a real person, &quot;a distinguished old chap&quot; he had met in the Channel Islands when he sailed his boat there. Reeman also states that the real Richard Bolitho was the brother of the Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall.

Among his fellow officers, Bolitho is known for his tactical ingenuity, his daring, and his disregard of both convention and political expediency. He rises to high rank—despite the opposition of less competent men—because of his ability to win crucial victories against seemingly impossible odds. Among the men of the fleet, Bolitho is known as a demanding but scrupulously fair and humane captain. The men sometimes refer to him, though never to his face, as &quot;Equality Dick&quot;. His reputation as a paragon of decency in a brutal world creates a fierce sense of loyalty among those who serve under him.

Officers and men who serve under Bolitho frequently choose, when given the chance, to do so again. Ships in the squadrons he commands as a senior officer are frequently commanded by men who had served as his lieutenants when he was a captain. His most lasting relationships are with Thomas Herrick—a fellow officer and his oldest friend—and John Allday, a former Cornish shepherd who became Bolitho&#x27;s coxswain and &quot;de facto&quot; bodyguard.

Bolitho had a number of romances. One of the first was Viola Raymond, the wife of an English diplomat. She died while Bolitho and a small number of his crew were stranded in a boat in the tropics, but it was her courage and sacrifice that rallied the crew. Bolitho married twice. His first wife, Cheney Seton, died in a carriage accident whilst carrying their unborn child. His relationship with the second, Belinda, the mother of his child Elizabeth, deteriorated when it became clear that she was nothing like the person he thought he married and was a very selfish individual. Estranged from her and his daughter, he carried on an increasingly public affair with Lady Catherine Somervell, who was his wife in all but name until his death.

Douglas Reeman uses some real locations as settings for his stories. The fictitious Bolitho ancestral home near Falmouth, Cornwall was inspired by a house which Reeman saw and photographed in the 1960s at Philleigh near the King Harry Ferry in Cornwall. In reality, the house is not near Falmouth at all, so Reeman &quot;relocated&quot; it for his novels. However, the Church of King Charles the Martyr, which is mentioned in the books, really does exist in Falmouth.

Reeman&#x27;s own Royal Navy career and lifelong interest in sailing informed his seafaring novels. He saw active service with the Royal Navy during the Second World War, serving in the North Sea, Arctic, Atlantic and Mediterranean campaigns. Starting as a midshipman on destroyers, he later transferred to motor torpedo boats, where he was twice mentioned in dispatches.

==Adam Bolitho==
Adam Bolitho is a fictional Royal Navy officer who is another main character in Reeman&#x27;s novels, succeeding the previous main character, Richard Bolitho.

In &quot;Enemy in Sight&quot;, Richard Bolitho is joined by his nephew Adam Pascoe, who is later renamed Adam Bolitho when he becomes Richard&#x27;s heir. Adam, the only son of Richard&#x27;s disgraced older brother Hugh, was born in 1780 in Penzance, Cornwall, shortly after his father joined the revolution in America. Having been sent to Richard at the age of 14 by his dying mother, he joined the Royal Navy, rising through the ranks to establish himself as a daring and resourceful frigate captain, as his uncle had once done.

Adam&#x27;s role in the series steadily increases as Richard ages and achieves high rank. After Richard&#x27;s death, he becomes the principal character in the series.

==Books in the series==
Several omnibus editions have also been released which collect multiple books from the series into one volume:

<doc id="1023885" wikidata="Q2286134" url="?curid=1023885" title="Silk Stockings">
<text>Silk Stockings is a musical with a book by George S. Kaufman, Leueen MacGrath, and Abe Burrows and music and lyrics by Cole Porter. The musical is loosely based on the Melchior Lengyel story &quot;Ninotchka&quot; and the 1939 film adaptation it inspired. It ran on Broadway in 1955. This was the last musical that Porter wrote for the stage.

==Production history==
===Background===
During the &quot;severely troubled tryout&quot; George S. Kaufman and his wife Leueen MacGrath were replaced by Abe Burrows. (According to Cecil Michener Smith and Glenn Litton, Kaufman became angry and quit.) Burrows re-wrote most of the book. The producer Cy Feuer took over the direction from Kaufman. The three leads had not performed in a Broadway musical comedy: Hildegard Knef was a German film and stage actress, Don Ameche never had sung on stage, and Gretchen Wyler was making her Broadway debut. &quot;All three triumphed.&quot;

===Productions===
Following tryouts in Philadelphia, Boston, and Detroit, the production opened Broadway on February 24, 1955 at the Imperial Theatre and closed on April 14, 1956 after 478 performances.

Directed by Cy Feuer and choreographed by Eugene Loring, the cast included Hildegard Knef (Ninotchka), Don Ameche (Steve Canfield), Gretchen Wyler (Janice Dayton), George Tobias, David Opatoshu, Julie Newmar, and Onna White. Jan Sherwood replaced Knef as Ninotchka and portrayed the role for the show&#x27;s first national tour. Scenic and lighting designs were by Jo Mielziner and costumes were by Lucinda Ballard. The tour played the Curran Theatre in San Francisco, California starting in April 1956, as well as Los Angeles.

The score &quot;played a large part in keeping &quot;Silk Stockings&quot; running on Broadway for 478 performances and in helping to recoup the immense production expenses for the show (brought in at a cost of $370,000, &quot;Silk Stockings&quot; was considered one of Broadway&#x27;s most expensive musicals for its time)...The big hit...was clearly &#x27;All of You&#x27;.&quot;

An original cast recording was released by RCA Victor.

The Lost Musicals staged reading of the musical was held in September 2005 in New York City.

Hildegard Knef (original German spelling) gave a vivid backstage account of the casting, rehearsals, tryouts and Broadway opening of &quot;Silk Stockings&quot; in her autobiography &quot;The Gift Horse: Report on a Life&quot; (McGraw Hill, 1971) pages 281 through 342.

==Synopsis==
The musical involves special envoy Nina Yaschenko, who is dispatched from the Soviet Union to rescue three foolish commissars from the pleasures of Paris. Romanced by theatrical agent Steven Canfield, she eventually comes to recognize the virtues of capitalist indulgence. Other characters include Peter Boroff, Russia&#x27;s greatest composer, who is being wooed by Janice Dayton, America&#x27;s swimming sweetheart, to write the score for her first non-aquatic picture, a musical adaptation of &quot;War and Peace&quot;.

<doc id="1023906" wikidata="Q422870" url="?curid=1023906" title="Phytoalexin">
<text>Phytoalexins are antimicrobial substances, some of which are antioxidative as well. They are defined not by their having any particular chemical structure or character, but by the fact that they are defensively synthesized &quot;de novo&quot; by plants that produce the compounds rapidly at sites of pathogen infection. In general phytoalexins are broad spectrum inhibitors; they are chemically diverse, and different chemical classes of compounds are characteristic of particular plant taxa. Phytoalexins tend to fall into several chemical classes, including terpenoids, glycosteroids, and alkaloids; however, the term applies to any phytochemicals that are induced by microbial infection.

==Function==
Phytoalexins are produced in plants to act as toxins to the attacking organism. They may puncture the cell wall, delay maturation, disrupt metabolism or prevent reproduction of the pathogen in question. Their importance in plant defense is indicated by an increase in susceptibility of plant tissue to infection when phytoalexin biosynthesis is inhibited. Mutants incapable of phytoalexin production exhibit more extensive pathogen colonization as compared to wild types. As such, host-specific pathogens capable of degrading phytoalexins are more virulent than those unable to do so.

When a plant cell recognizes particles from damaged cells or particles from the pathogen, the plant launches a two-pronged resistance: a general short-term response and a delayed long-term specific response.

As part of the induced resistance, the short-term response, the plant deploys reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide to kill invading cells. In pathogen interactions, the common short-term response is the hypersensitive response, in which cells surrounding the site of infection are signaled to undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in order to prevent the spread of the pathogen to the rest of the plant.

Long-term resistance, or systemic acquired resistance (SAR), involves communication of the damaged tissue with the rest of the plant using plant hormones such as jasmonic acid, ethylene, abscisic acid, or salicylic acid. The reception of the signal leads to global changes within the plant, which induce expression of genes that protect from further pathogen intrusion, including enzymes involved in the production of phytoalexins. Often, if jasmonates or ethylene (both gaseous hormones) are released from the wounded tissue, neighboring plants also manufacture phytoalexins in response. For herbivores, common vectors for plant diseases, these and other wound response aromatics seem to act as a warning that the plant is no longer edible. Also, in accordance with the old adage, &quot;an enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot;, the aromatics may alert natural enemies of the plant invaders to the presence thereof.

==Recent research==

Allixin (3-hydroxy-5-methoxy-6-methyl-2-pentyl-4&quot;H&quot;-pyran-4-one), a non-sulfur-containing compound having a γ-pyrone skeletal structure, was the first compound isolated from garlic as a phytoalexin, a product induced in plants by continuous stress. This compound has been shown to have unique biological properties, such as anti-oxidative effects, anti-microbial effects, anti-tumor promoting effects, inhibition of aflatoxin B2 DNA binding, and neurotrophic effects. Allixin showed an anti-tumor promoting effect in vivo, inhibiting skin tumor formation by TPA in DMBA initiated mice. Herein, allixin and/or its analogs may be expected to be useful compounds for cancer prevention or chemotherapy agents for other diseases.

==Role of natural phenols in the plant defense against fungal pathogens==
Polyphenols, especially isoflavonoids and related substances, play a role in the plant defense against fungal and other microbial pathogens.

In &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; grape, &quot;trans&quot;-resveratrol is a phytoalexin produced against the growth of fungal pathogens such as &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; and delta-viniferin is another grapevine phytoalexin produced following fungal infection by &quot;Plasmopara viticola&quot;. Pinosylvin is a pre-infectious stilbenoid toxin (i.e. synthesized prior to infection), contrary to phytoalexins which are synthesized during infection. It is present in the heartwood of &quot;Pinaceae&quot;. It is a fungitoxin protecting the wood from fungal infection.

Sakuranetin is a flavanone, a type of flavonoid. It can be found in &quot;Polymnia fruticosa&quot; and rice, where it acts as a phytoalexin against spore germination of &quot;Pyricularia oryzae&quot;. In &quot;Sorghum&quot;, the &quot;SbF3&#x27;H2&quot; gene, encoding a flavonoid 3&#x27;-hydroxylase, seems to be expressed in pathogen-specific 3-deoxyanthocyanidin phytoalexin synthesis, for example in &quot;Sorghum-Colletotrichum&quot; interactions.

6-Methoxymellein is a dihydroisocoumarin and a phytoalexin induced in carrot slices by UV-C, that allows resistance to &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot; and other microorganisms.

Danielone is a phytoalexin found in the papaya fruit. This compound showed high antifungal activity against &quot;Colletotrichum gloesporioides&quot;, a pathogenic fungus of papaya.

Stilbenes are produced in &quot;Eucalyptus sideroxylon&quot; in case of pathogen attacks. Such compounds can be implied in the hypersensitive response of plants. High levels of polyphenols in some woods can explain their natural preservation against rot.

Avenanthramides are phytoalexins produced by &quot;Avena sativa&quot; in its response to &quot;Puccinia coronata&quot; var. &quot;avenae&quot; f. sp. &quot;avenae&quot;, the oat crown rust. (Avenanthramides were formerly called avenalumins.)

<doc id="1023907" wikidata="Q933530" url="?curid=1023907" title="One-shot (comics)">
<text>In comics, a one-shot is a work composed of a single standalone issue or chapter, contrasting a limited series or ongoing series, which are composed of multiple issues or chapters. One-shots date back to the early 19th century, published in newspapers, and today may be in the form of single published comic books, parts of comic magazines/anthologies or published online in websites. In the marketing industry, some one-shots are used as promotion tools that tie in with existing productions, films, video games or television shows.

==Overview==
In the Japanese manga industry, one-shots are called , a term which implies that the comic is presented in its entirety without any continuation. One-shot manga are often written for contests, and sometimes later developed into a full-length series, much like a television pilot. Many popular manga series began as one-shots, such as &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;, &quot;Naruto&quot;, &quot;Bleach&quot;, &quot;One Piece&quot;, &quot;Berserk&quot;, &quot;Kinnikuman, Attack on Titan&quot; and &quot;Death Note&quot;. &quot;Rising Stars of Manga&quot; was an annual competition for original English-language one-shot manga, many of which have gone on to become full-length manga series. Some noted manga authors, such as Akira Toriyama and Rumiko Takahashi, have worked on numerous one-shot stories in addition to their serialized works. 

In the United States, one-shots are usually labeled with a &quot;#1&quot; despite there being no following issues, and are sometimes subtitled as &quot;specials&quot;. On occasion, a character or concept will appear in a series of one-shots, in cases where the subject matter is not financially lucrative enough to merit an ongoing or limited series, but still popular enough to be published on a regular basis, often annually or quarterly. A current example of a series of one-shots would be Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Franklin Richards: Son of a Genius&quot; publications. This type of one-shot is not to be confused with a comic book annual, which is typically a companion publication to an established ongoing series.

The term has also been borrowed into the Franco-Belgian comics industry, with basically the same meaning, although there it mostly refers to comic albums.

==One-shot manga==
The comic art histories of different countries and regions are following divergent paths. Japanese early comic art or manga took its rise from the 12th century and developed from &quot;Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga&quot; (&quot;Animal-person Caricatures&quot;), went so far as to &quot;ukiyo-e&quot; (&quot;floating world&quot;) in the 17th century. Western-style humour comics and caricatures had been introduced into Japan in the late 19th century and impacted on the styles of comic art. On the other hand, the significant development of modern era Japanese comic art was arising in the aftermath of World War II and further developed into diversified genres. Nowadays, almost a quarter of all printed materials in Japan are in forms of manga, while the audiences are from all ages.

Most modern era one-shot manga (&quot;yomikiri 読み切り&quot;) have independent settings, characters, and storylines, rather than sharing them with existing works. In Japan and other Asian countries, some one-shot manga are more like takeoff boards to determine the popularity among the audience. The format of a one-shot manga could be changed if it has a broad market prospect, so that: 
# a one-shot manga could become a serialized continuing manga after adapting;
# a one-shot manga could develop into a series of one-shot manga or serial manga, which are sharing the same world set and character design, but in different story lines; and
# side stories could derive from the original one-shot manga, such as a prequel, a sequel, and an antagonist or supporting role&#x27;s side story.

==One-shot Western comics==
The prototype comic works in Western countries were pamphlets, giveaways, or Sunday newspaper comic sections in the 19th century. These were then developed and published as comic magazines which were distributed with the newspapers sales on newsstands. On the other hand, graphic books in America were also viewed as developing from pamphlets that sold on newsstands. Comics were not highly regarded in the early market, for example, during the Depression comics were used to increase the sales of newspapers and some other products in the United States. Most of the comics were one-shot comics before the rise of long continuities in newspaper strips. After some early developments, weekly comic magazines became the major way of dissemination in European comic markets. Influenced by the chaos of social revolutions and changings in the 20th century, Western alternative comic art was quickly developed as well as 1970s and 1980s&#x27; America. Also, America has stirred up a spree of superhero comics since 1930s, and this comic form is still dominating the comic market.

===The 19th and early 20th century===

In this period, comic strips and magazines were the major reading formats that had been leading the markets. Divergent genres such as humour, caricature, and horror were dominant forms of comics in that time. In the very beginning, magazines were divided from the comic supplements of newspapers within a decade of their first appearance in America. On the other side of the coin, in Europe, magazine format was developed as a comic supplement of newspapers along European features and never lost the identification. It is worth mentioning that comic art is developing more rapidly during social revolutions, while comic strips were very topical and aimed at all ages.

===Modern era one-shot comics===

Since the 1930s, a specific form of comic, the superhero comic, has been causing a feeding frenzy in America and further impacted on other countries&#x27; comic markets. It dominated the publishing industry on comic art, and most of the published comic books were contained one-shot stories rather than serialized stories. A single popular protagonist always centered all the highlights in a superhero comic story. This best-selling model is still the majority of American comic market. Around the late 1960s- mid-1970s, due to the dislocations of social developments, alternative comic art traditions were developing under the era. This alternative underground comix movement used the medium as a method for radical changes.

In more recent years, European albums are still the dominant comic format in their own markets, while superhero comic books dominate the American market rather than continued stories. Several large comic book publishers, Entertainments and animation production companies were established such as DC Comics and Marvel Comics. On another note, Japanese comics are increasing in popularity as Japanese-style anthologies are published in America in recent decades.

<text>DOSAAF (), full name &quot;Volunteer Society for the Assistance to the Army, Aviation, and Navy&quot; (), was a paramilitary sport organization in the Soviet Union, concerned mainly with weapons, automobiles and aviation. The society was established in 1927 as OSOAVIAKhIM and from 1951 to 1991 carried the name of DOSAAF.

The society was preserved in some post-Soviet Republics, e.g. Russia and Belarus, although these may use a different name. In Russia it was reformed in December 1991 as the Russian Defense Sports-Technical Organization (ROSTO; ). In December 2009, ROSTO was renamed DOSAAF of Russia. For Belarus, see DOSAAF (Belarus).

The stated goal of the society was &quot;patriotic upbringing of the population and preparation of it to the defense of the Motherland&quot;. Among the means to achieve this was the development of paramilitary sports. Initially, an important goal was financial support of the Soviet Armed Forces. At the same time, ordinary sports were supported within the framework of DOSAAF facilities such as sports halls, stadiums, swimming pools, gymnasiums and others.

== History ==

=== OSOAVIAKhIM ===
The precursor of DOSAAF was the OSOAVIAKhIM (; full name: , &#x27;Union of Societies of Assistance to Defense and Aviation-Chemical Construction of the USSR&#x27;) created on 27 January 1927 by merging the &quot;Society of Assistance to Defense&quot; (), &quot;Society of Friends of the Air Force&quot; () and &quot;Society of Friends of Chemical Defense and the Chemical Industry&quot; ().

The goal of the society was preparation of reserves for armed forces. It soon became a powerful paramilitary with its own airfields, radio clubs, parachuting towers, and firing ranges. It became prestigious and romantic among Soviet youth to earn badges such as &quot;Voroshilov sharpshooter&quot; (), &quot;Voroshilov horse rider&quot; () and &quot;Distinguished Parachute Jumper&quot;.

OSOAVIAKhIM supported a number of professional research and development programs for airplanes, glider, airships and stratospheric balloons, some of which were later taken over by the Soviet Air Forces. In 1934, the organisation carried out the record-setting mission of the high-altitude balloon &quot;Osoaviakhim-1&quot;. Also in the 1930s, Sergey Korolev&#x27;s rocket research organization, GIRD, and Oleg Antonov&#x27;s glider project, among other efforts, were part of the OSOAVIAKhIM.

=== Post-World War II ===
In March 1948, OSOAVIAKhIM was reorganized into three separate societies: &quot;The Voluntary Society of Assistance to the Army&quot; (), &quot;The Voluntary Society of Assistance to the Air Force&quot; () and &quot;The Voluntary Society of Assistance to the Navy&quot; (). On 20 August 1951 they were re-merged as a single society, DOSAAF.

<doc id="1023920" wikidata="Q6955505" url="?curid=1023920" title="NTSC-J">
<text>NTSC-J or &quot;System J&quot; is the informal designation for the analogue television standard used in Japan. The system is based on the US NTSC (NTSC-M) standard with minor differences. While NTSC-M is an official CCIR and FCC standard, NTSC-J or &quot;System J&quot; are a colloquial indicators. 

The system was introduced by NHK and NTV, with regular color broadcasts starting on September 10, 1960.

NTSC-J was replaced by digital broadcasts in 44 of the country&#x27;s 47 prefectures on 24 July 2011. Analogue broadcasting ended on 31 March 2012 in the three prefectures devastated by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami (Iwate, Miyagi, Fukushima) and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.

The term NTSC-J is also incorrectly and informally used to distinguish regions in console video games, which use televisions (see Marketing definition below).

== Technical definition ==
Japan implemented the NTSC standard with slight differences. The black and blanking levels of the NTSC-J signal are identical to each other (both at 0 IRE, similar to the PAL video standard), while in American NTSC the black level is slightly higher (7.5 IRE) than blanking level - because of the way this appears in the waveform, the higher black level is also called pedestal. This small difference doesn&#x27;t cause any incompatibility problems, but needs to be compensated by a slight change of the TV brightness setting in order to achieve proper images.

YIQ color encoding in NTSC-J uses slightly different equations and ranges from regular NTSC. formula_1 has a range of 0 to +-334 (+-309 on NTSC-M), and formula_2 has a range of 0 to +-293 (+-271 on NTSC-M).

YCbCr equations for NTSC-J are formula_3, while on NTSC-M we have formula_4.

NTSC-J also uses a white reference (color temperature) of 9300K instead of the usual NTSC-US standard of 6500K.

The over-the-air RF frequencies used in Japan do not match those of the US NTSC standard. On VHF the frequency spacing for each channel is 6 MHz as in North America, South America, Caribbean, South Korea, Taiwan, Burma (Myanmar) the Philippines, except between channels 7 and 8 (which overlap). Channels 1 through 3 are reallocated for the expansion of the Japanese FM band. On UHF frequency spacing for each channel in Japan is the same, but the channel numbers are 1 lower than on the other areas mentioned - for example, channel 13 in Japan is on the same frequency as channel 14. For more information see Television channel frequencies. Channels 13-62 are used for analog and digital TV broadcasting.

The encoding of the stereo subcarrier also differs between NTSC-M/MTS and Japanese EIAJ MTS broadcasts.

== Marketing definition ==
The term NTSC-J was informally used to distinguish regions in console video games, which use televisions. NTSC-J is used as the name of the video gaming region of Japan (hence the &quot;J&quot;), South East Asia (some countries only), Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Philippines and South Korea (now NTSC-K) (formerly part of SE Asia with Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, etc.).

Most games designated as part of this region will not run on hardware designated as part of the NTSC-U, PAL (or PAL-E, &quot;E&quot; stands for Europe) or NTSC-C (for China) mostly due to the regional differences of the PAL (SECAM was also used in the early 1990s) and NTSC standards. Many older video game systems do not allow games from different regions to be played (accomplished by various forms of regional lockout); however more modern consoles either leave protection to the discretion of publishers, such as Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox 360, or discontinue its use entirely, like Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 3 (with a few exceptions).

China received its own designation due to fears of an influx of illegal copies flooding out of China, which is notorious for its rampant copyright infringements. There is also concern of copyright protection through regional lockout built into the video game systems and games themselves, as the same product can be edited by different publishers from one continent to another.

<text>KZEL-FM (96.1 MHz) is a commercial radio station in Eugene, Oregon, in the United States. The station airs a classic rock music format.

It has applied for a U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) construction permit to move to a taller tower (HAAT 451.9 meters) at the same site and increase the vertically polarized ERP to 100,000 watts.

==History==
KZEL-FM, along with short-lived KZEL-AM, was founded and funded in 1967 by Eugene lumberman George &quot;Tirebiter&quot; Zellner. When he purchased the stations, their call letters were KWFS. Zellner changed the call letters to KZEL, for the FM and AM bands. KZEL-AM was briefly affiliated with the CBS network, and carried Frank Gifford&#x27;s sports updates from CBS, along with broadcasts of Churchill High School sports and Eugene Bombers pro football. Zellner sold the station to Jay and Barbara West in 1971.

The Wests led KZEL for most of the 1970s as a free-format station. Its studios were located in Glenwood, near Springfield. Disc jockeys included John Napier, Gary &quot;The Wasted Potato&quot; Palmatier, Stan &quot;Harry &#x27;Til 6&quot; Garrett, Michael Waggoner, Sleepy John (Cuthbertson), JET, Tom Krumm, Chris Kovarik, Magic Mike, and Peyton Mays. Additionally, KZEL carried &quot;Daybreak&quot; in the morning and &quot;News &amp; Information&quot; in the afternoon. News anchors included Melinda Coates, Rosemary Reed, Cal Turlock (real name Phillip Johnson) and Bryce Zabel.

In the 1970s the News department was headed by Matt McCormick , aided by Tim Helfrich , and Josh Marquis, all destined to become practicing lawyers.

KZEL-FM belongs to Cumulus Media, a nationwide owner of radio stations. In 2006, the program director, Mark Raney, locked himself in the station&#x27;s control room for 10 days to protest the management&#x27;s decision to abandon KZEL&#x27;s classic rock format and replace it with country music. Raney, with support from his listeners, persuaded the station&#x27;s management to retain the rock format.

KZEL-FM then evolved from a classic rock format into an adult album alternative music format, adding newer artists and music to the playlist. Weekday personalities on the station still include Mark Raney and John Frederick in the morning, Emma at mid-day, and C.Y.D. in the afternoon. In December 2018, Mark Raney retired after 41 years in the radio industry.

On June 1, 2018 KZEL returned to classic rock.

==Translators==
KZEL-FM programming is also carried on a series of broadcast translator stations to extend or improve the coverage area of the station.

<text>Mount Whisler is a mountain of the British Empire Range on Canada&#x27;s Ellesmere Island. It is the second highest peak of the British Empire Range, of Ellesmere Island, and of the Arctic Cordillera. It is located about northeast of Barbeau Peak (), the highest peak in the Cordillera. The Henrietta Nesmith Glacier completely surrounds Mount Whisler.

The United States Army Signal Corps first mapped Mount Whisler in 1882 during their Lady Franklin Bay Expedition. It was named for Private William Whisler, a member of the party.

<text>Squash and stretch is the phrase used to describe &quot;by far the most important&quot; of the 12 basic principles of animation, described in the book &quot;The Illusion of Life&quot; by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston.

==Basis==

The principle is based on observation that only stiff objects remain inert during motion, while objects that are not stiff, although retaining overall volume, tend to change shape in an extent that depends on inertia and elasticity of the different parts of the moving object. To illustrate the principle, a half-filled flour sack dropped on the floor, or stretched out by its corners, was shown to be retaining its overall volume as determined by the object&#x27;s Poisson&#x27;s ratio.

Examples of the elasticity of the human body in motion were found in photographs the animators found in newspaper sports pages. Using these poses as reference the animators were able to start &quot;observing (the motion) in a new way&quot;. Author Walt Stanchfield said: &quot;A simple shape plus squash and stretch are all the anatomy you need for cartoon characters&quot;.

==Application==
The ball that would change shape, compressing (&quot;squash&quot;) as it hit the ground, then extending (stretch) as it bounced up again, was the simplest example that was part of the preparatory training for Disney animators.

During the 1930s, the squash and stretch were exaggerated by Disney animators, making it ever more extreme, but they had to maintain the overall volume of an object so that it did not appear to change volume as well as shape.

<doc id="1023955" wikidata="Q1754057" url="?curid=1023955" title="Angel's Egg">
<text>is a Japanese art film original video animation (OVA) written and directed by Mamoru Oshii. Released by Tokuma Shoten on 15 December 1985, the film was a collaboration between artist Yoshitaka Amano and Oshii. The film stars two nameless characters, a young girl who protects an egg, who bonds with a boy who has a dream about a bird. It was the first original project by Oshii and carries themes found in his other works.

It features very little spoken dialogue and a story that is strongly allegorical which has led to many viewers being confused about the film&#x27;s supposed meaning. The film uses Biblical allusions and has been described as a cult classic.

== Plot ==
The setting of the film takes place in a primordial land, filled with trees, a seashore, a mysterious mechanical sun, various ruins of buildings and two nameless characters. One of these is a young girl who scavenges a desolate city while protecting a large egg, which she believes will hatch into an angel. The other is a boy who disembarks from a tank.

The girl encounters the boy, who questions her about what the egg contains and suggests breaking it. At first horrified by his suggestion, the girl tries to run away. She eventually lets him follow her, leading to their brief bonding. The boy still wishes to break the egg to see what is inside. He recounts the story of Noah&#x27;s Ark, but a version in which the raven was never released, the dove was only released once, and after that did not return, leading the ark to continue sailing. He ponders the world and existence, and theorizes that the bird never existed. The girl tells the boy that the bird did exist, and brings him to a fossil of an angel.

Later, the boy smashes the girl&#x27;s egg while she sleeps. This prompts her to chase after him and ultimately fall into a body of water, where her final breath is transformed at the surface of the water into a large number of eggs. The boy observes the girl, now a stone statue, sitting on a throne among the other stone statues of people on the mechanical sun. Afterwards, the world shown in the film is revealed to be on top of a shape that looks like the hull of an overturned ship.

== Production ==
&quot;Angel&#x27;s Egg&quot; repurposes ideas that Oshii developed for a cancelled &quot;Lupin the Third&quot; film. Both concepts feature the theme of questioning existence (Lupin&#x27;s existence in the cancelled film, and the bird from Noah&#x27;s ark in Angel&#x27;s Egg), and involve the fossil of an angel Oshii himself said that Angel&#x27;s Egg was another attempt at the idea and anime critic has said that Angel&#x27;s Egg (and the first Patlabor movie) would not have existed if Oshii had made the Lupin film. Oshii has also stated that the entire angel fossil concept used in Angel&#x27;s Egg was directly taken from Lupin, and compares the relationship between the boy and girl to that in The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams.

Many of the themes and elements in Angel&#x27;s Egg were originally from Oshii&#x27;s cancelled Lupin the 3rd film. However, only the angel fossil remains unchanged from its planned appearance.

The film is a collaboration between Amano and Oshii. Oshii originally intended on making a comedy film, with film starting with the girl with the egg first getting off a flying ark in front of a Japanese convenience store, but changed his mind and decided to make it a pure fantasy film after seeing Amano&#x27;s art. Oshii said that he wanted to remove a narrative as much as possible, and keep the film simple, using animation as an expression to draw out a story, and fill it with symbolic expressions and metaphors &quot;like Jung&#x27;s archetypes and collective unconscious&quot;.

Angel&#x27;s Egg touches on themes that are common in Oshii&#x27;s films, including references to the Christian Bible, the symbolism of dreams, as well as the intersection of dreams and reality. Some of these themes appear in his other works, such as 1984&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot;. The New York Japan Society says the film is &quot;An allegorical fantasy enriched by symbolism and biblical allusion.&quot;

Although some publications have indicated that the film is built on director Oshii&#x27;s supposed loss of faith in Christianity, Oshii himself has stated otherwise in saying that he was not a Christian, but that he thought quotes from the Bible were cool and had a friend who was Christian. The misconception that Oshii was a man of faith has its origins in an interview that was likely mistranslated, in which Oshii is reported to say, &quot;I planned to enter a seminary at one point, but didn&#x27;t.&quot; Which is then followed up by the interviewer asking, &quot;Are you a Christian, or do you just like the Bible for its philosophy?&quot; To which Oshii replies, &quot;For its philosophy.&quot; In the same Animerica interview Oshii also said, &quot;I&#x27;m not a Christian, but I&#x27;ve been reading the Bible since my student days&quot;.

In a 1996 interview with the magazine &quot;Animerica&quot;, Oshii stated that he made the film because it had elements that intrigued him, such as &quot;Ruins; I like ruins; I like museums; I like fish; I like birds; I like water... and I like girls.&quot; He also stated that ruins appear to him in his dreams.

Oshii said in a 1985 interview with Animage that the contents of the egg are supposed to represent dreams and hopes, something that may or may not exist, and that while the girl believed in what was in it, by breaking the egg, the boy showed that what she believed in did not exist. Regarding the bird the boy talks about, though the girl shows the boy an angel fossil in order to convince him that the bird does exist, Oshii has stated that the angel is not the bird. Oshii also said that the ending was one with salvation for the girl, but he did not want it to be shown in a straightforward way, and made it hard to understand.

The angel fossil was later reused alongside other elements from Oshii&#x27;s cancelled Lupin film in &quot;009 RE:CYBORG&quot;, which Oshii was initially supposed to direct and participated in the script for, and was eventually directed by Kenji Kamiyama, a student of Oshii. Kamiyama describes this version of the angel fossil as indication of a god, but not of any particular religion. The angel fossil was also used in the tenth episode of Lupin the 3rd Part 6 which Oshii wrote the script for &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Bird&quot; In this episode Fujiko Mine is hired by the archangel Michael to steal the angel fossil, which is actually that of the fallen angel Lucifer, on behalf of his master.

Nezu worked with Oshii once again in &quot;Patlabor 2: The Movie&quot; and Mako Hyōdō played a supporting role in &quot;The Sky Crawlers&quot;.

== Style ==
The film has elements that are not typical for anime film productions of that era. It uses a limited color palette making it almost monochrome. The film has very little dialogue. The film is unusual because it contains only 400 cuts when the typical animation has three times that amount. 

== Production and release ==
The documentation for the project was written in one night by Toshio Suzuki (producer) but Oshii was displeased with it and did not use it. However, the title of the film, , was from Suzuki, where Oshii&#x27;s original title was .

Oshii began writing the script with the main theme of a dream seen by a girl, continuing from &quot;Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer&quot;, but thinking that a script alone would not be enough to get the project approved, invited Amano to make image boards for the proposal. He also showed the image boards to the animators to get ideas from them. There was no definitive script, but rather a collection of ideas noted down like &quot;annunciation&quot; &quot;ark&quot; &quot;setting sun&quot; &quot;a boy holding a cross riding a tank&quot; which were immediately turned into storyboards, and then fitted together, which Oshii says had the intention of making a film without clear drama, made out of visual expressions, like one by Andrei Tarkovsky.

Amano had initially been slated to work on Oshii&#x27;s cancelled Lupin film, which anime critic Ryota Fujitsu says makes it obvious that Angel&#x27;s Egg was inherited from Lupin. While Amano was originally invited to work on character designs, Oshii liked his art enough that he ended up in the role of art direction, also designing image boards, and other things such as posters.

== Release ==
&quot;Angel&#x27;s Egg&quot; was released in the direct-to-video format on 15 December 1985 by Tokuma Shoten. It was additionally given a limited theatrical release that same year. Although &quot;Angel&#x27;s Egg&quot; was highly acclaimed by critics and people in the animation industry in Japan on release, it also resulted in Oshii being labeled as a director who made films hard to understand, which resulted in him being hired far less frequently for years up until he got involved with &quot;Patlabor&quot;. Speaking at an animation film festival in 1997 through a translator, Oshii explained the film did not do well financially upon release and was an obstacle to him getting work again for years. 

The 71-minute OVA would later be used as the skeleton for the 1987 live-action independent film &quot;In the Aftermath&quot; directed by Carl Colpaert. Colpaert&#x27;s movie occasionally intercuts with footage from Oshii&#x27;s &quot;Angel&#x27;s Egg&quot; with dubbed over dialogue, which does not appear in Oshii&#x27;s film.

The film was released on Blu-ray disc in 2013 in Japan. &quot;Angel&#x27;s Egg&quot; was screened at Japan Society on 14 October 2022 and later on 10 September 2023 with Amano in attendance. On 29 May 2024, GKIDS announced that they had acquired the North American distribution rights to the film, with the licensor planning to give the film a 4K restoration which will be supervised by Oshii as well as screening the film nationwide in theaters.

== Reception ==

=== Japanese reception ===

The film has gained more critical acclaim from critics and industry professionals in later years, with people such as Shoji Kawamori, Ryu Mitsuse, Hideo Osabe, Takashi Murakami, and director heaping praise on it.

Yoshikazu Yasuhiko said that the reason the film feels like something new is because it is not merely a montage of disjointed scenes, but a complete world depicted within 80 minutes. He also compares the art in the film to the modernism in &quot;Belladonna of Sadness&quot;, being beautiful but also dangerous.

Haruhiko Mikimoto expressed appreciation for the art direction, particularly having characters with color in front of monotone backgrounds, the use of silhouettes in the backgrounds, and the use of barely visible objects in the dark in backgrounds. He also said that Angel&#x27;s Egg brought out the best merit of an OVA, which is letting the creator make what they want to make, and that he felt the quality of the film meant it would not be out of place in a movie theater.

Shoji Kokami had high praise for the film, saying that it is a &quot;two-dimensional poem of images given form&quot; that &quot;should be valued as a pinnacle of the media of animation.&quot;

Anime critic and producer also had high praise for the film, saying the apocalyptic setting, religious aspects, and lack of life in it both appeals to and bewilders fans of science fiction. He also contrasted the film with &quot;Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer&quot; and &quot;Dallos&quot;, saying that while they were about giving meaning to a fictional world, it makes an abnormal world to give the characters meaning.

Hayao Miyazaki was more critical of the film, and recounts that Toru Horikoshi, who was a producer for Nippon TV at the time, fell asleep watching the film, and that while Michihiko Suwa of Yomiuri TV approved it for a TV broadcast, he said that he did not understand the film. Miyazaki himself said regarding the film that he &quot;appreciates the effort, but it is not something others would understand&quot; and of Oshii &quot;he goes on a one-way journey without thinking of how to get back&quot;.

Oshii recounts that his mother said upon watching the film that nobody would watch his films anymore.

=== Western reception ===

Western critics found the film confusing, citing its allegory, symbolism, and ending, as the reasons. Brian Ruh stated that it was &quot;one of the most beautiful and lyric films in the animated medium.&quot; Some western critics say that the film is difficult to understand, with visuals and narrative that is both cryptic, convoluted, and allegorical. Jason Thompson writing in Viz Media&#x27;s online magazine &quot;J-pop&quot; compared the film&#x27;s style to &quot;Night on the Galactic Railroad&quot; while noting that the meaning of the film may be elusive, stating &quot;&quot;Angel&#x27;s Egg&quot; stands as an evocation of a mood and world which is powerful in spite of -- perhaps because of -- not being consciously understood.&quot; Kara Dennison of &quot;Otaku USA&quot; said &quot;Mamoru Oshii&#x27;s 1985 collaboration with Yoshitaka Amano is one of the most beautiful anime committed to film.&quot; 

&quot;Anime News Network&quot; writer Lynzee Loveridge compared the film&#x27;s tone and style to Eiichi Yamamoto&#x27;s &quot;Belladonna of Sadness&quot; and René Laloux&#x27;s film &quot;Fantastic Planet&quot; and said &quot;There is little else like in the animation medium and fans of thoughtful, experimental works can only hope that more legitimate exposure may lead to broader availability.&quot;

Helen McCarthy called it &quot;an early masterpiece of symbolic film-making&quot;, stating that &quot;its surreal beauty and slow pace created a Zen-like atmosphere, unlike any other anime&quot;. In his book &quot;Horror and Science Fiction Film IV&quot;, Donald C Willis described the film as &quot;a haunting, poetic melancholic science-fantasy film, and–for non-Japanese-speaking viewers at least–a very cryptic one.&quot; Willis also included the film in his list of most memorable films from 1987 to 1997. In an article in &quot;Senses of Cinema&quot; on Oshii, Richard Suchenski stated that the film was Oshii&#x27;s &quot;purest distillation of both Oshii&#x27;s visual mythology and his formal style&quot;. The review noted that &quot;&quot;Patlabor 2&quot; is more sophisticated, &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; is more important, and &quot;Avalon&quot; is more mythically complex but the low-tech, hand-drawn &quot;Angel&#x27;s Egg&quot; remains Oshii&#x27;s most personal film.&quot;

<doc id="1023967" wikidata="Q941167" url="?curid=1023967" title="Tsáchila">
<text>The Tsachila, also called the Colorados (meaning “the red-colored ones”), are an indigenous people of the Ecuadorian province of Santo Domingo de los Tsáchilas, partly named after them. Their native language is Tsafiki, a member of the Barbacoan linguistic family, and translates to mean &quot;true word&quot;.

== Population ==

According to the 1997 census, their population had reached 2,640 inhabitants. These are grouped into eight communities: Cóngoma Grante (St. John), Los Naranjos, El Búho de los Colorados, El Poste, Peripa, Chigüpe, Otongo Mapalí, and Filomena Aguavil (Tahuaza). These communities are located in the rural canton of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas.

== Geography ==
The Tsachila people are located near the base of the Andes Mountains. The province has a surface area of 3,857 km², an altitude of 625 m, and is located 120 km from the Pacific Ocean. The province shares a border to the north and east with Pichincha, to the west with Manabí, to the south with Los Ríos, and the southeast with Cotopaxi. Ecuador’s northwestern zone is the zone that receives the most rainfall in the country. It has a great hydrological wealth where five important basins and micro-basins are located: The east and northeast, the middle and lower course of Toachi, belongs to the White River basin; to the south, the sub-basin of Borbón which belongs to the Guayas river great basin, and is joined with the Babis (Nino Torres). In the southeast, the Peripa river sub-basin; to the northeast. The sub-basin of Quinindé, along with the White River sub-basin; the northeast belongs to the Esmeralda River basin. The city is located at the end of the Toachi river basin which is located to the east side of the city. Bombolí hill is the highest elevation.

== Legend of the origin of their ornamentation ==

Men of this ethnic group are easily distinguishable for an elaborate head decoration that they style by shaving the temporal areas of their heads and shaping the remaining hair into a helmet-like feature with a mixture of grease and annatto sap/seeds which is achiote. 
This tradition is believed to have been a palliative measure from a time when the Tsachila&#x27;s were exposed to the ravages of smallpox. 
A Tsáchila shaman asked a spirit to guide them to a cure by ceremony and prayer. They were guided to an achiote bush. They covered themselves completely with the red juices of the seed-pods and after a few days the mortality in the group was drastically reduced. They are forever grateful to this plant for the protection that it offered to the entire community from smallpox. The shape of their hair style is fashioned to look like the seed pods.

== Present day way of life ==
They speak the Tsafiki or Tsáchila language of the Barbacoan language family.
Men wear horizontally striped cobalt blue/black and white skirts, and the women wear brightly colored horizontally striped skirts.

The Spaniards called them &quot;Colorado&quot; (meaning colored red) because they used to cover their entire bodies in the red juices of the achiote seeds, for prevention against Smallpox, but the Spaniards thought red was indeed their true skin color.

Amy Gende (1998- ) is a member of the Tsáchila and she represents Province of Santo Domingo de los Tsáchilas at the National Assembly from 2023 to 2025.

==Historical notes==

The largest city of the canton is &quot;Santo Domingo de los Colorados&quot; and was named after these ethnic groups. Most Ecuadorians consider the shamans of the Tsachila&#x27;s holders of secrets of the rain forest and of healing powers that would heal whenever the western medicine had failed. For the most part, this country legend was generated by the fame of Abraham Calazacom a tribal chief of the Tsachila&#x27;s that led his tribe in the fifties and sixties.
Their economic activity is limited to harvesting of native tropical products for traditional medicine, especially the Tagua or Corozo nuts that are used to manufacture hand-crafts in many communities of Ecuador. They also cultivate tropical fruits, including different varieties of the genus Musa (bananas), Pineapples, Papayas, Oranges, etc, as well as farming Cocoa plants.

<doc id="1023973" wikidata="Q1397976" url="?curid=1023973" title="Fatburger">
<text>Fatburger North America Inc. (doing business as Fatburger) is an American fast casual restaurant chain owned by FAT Brands. Its tagline is &quot;The Last Great Hamburger Stand&quot;. While it is a fast-food restaurant, the food is cooked and made to order. Some Fatburger restaurants have liquor licenses as well as &quot;fat bars&quot;. Its franchise headquarters are located in Beverly Hills, California. In addition to the United States, the chain operates in 19 other countries. The Fatburger menu is centered primarily on hamburgers, offering various sizes and numbers of patties, along with add-ons such as cheese, bacon and eggs.

==History==

Fatburger was founded by Lovie Yancey (1912–2008) in the neighborhood of Exposition Park in Los Angeles, California, in 1947. It was originally named &quot;Mr. Fatburger&quot; (on behalf of Yancey&#x27;s boyfriend), until Yancey removed the &quot;Mr.&quot; in 1952. At that time, she bought out her start-up partners and retained sole ownership of the Fatburger brand until 1990, keeping and operating the original store on Western Avenue along with the La Cienega Boulevard store (La Cienega/San Vicente).

Fatburger remained a mostly California-based chain until the late 1990s, when it began an expansion in North America. On August 15, 2003, Fog Cutter Capital Group completed a $7 million investment and financing package for the company. Fatburger operates or franchises over 150 Fatburger restaurants worldwide with over 300 more planned for future development. For several months in 2006, the company was barred from selling additional franchises in California, due to chairperson Wiederhorn&#x27;s felony convictions.

In 1992, Fatburger gained national attention after being referenced in the hit song &quot;It Was a Good Day&quot; by rapper and actor Ice Cube. It was also referenced by The Notorious B.I.G. in the song &quot;Going Back to Cali&quot;.

In 2008, Fatburger opened its first restaurant in a sports stadium, the Arizona Diamondbacks&#x27; Chase Field. Fatburger also opened its first location in Dubai, U.A.E., (today there are eight). There are also Fatburger eateries in Beijing, PR China.

In January 2013, Fatburger opened its first branch in Karachi, Pakistan. Owing to the success of the burgers and positive response in Pakistan, Fatburger opened its biggest flagship outlet globally in June 2013 in Lahore. In July 2015, a branch in Lahore was shut down by authorities due to health and food safety reasons.

==Locations==
Fatburger has locations in five western states in the United States and Canada, and new locations in China, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Fiji, Indonesia, Iraq (including Iraqi Kurdistan), India, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Tunisia, Macau, Pakistan, Oman, Panama, Singapore, Philippines, Qatar, and Japan. In some locations, menu changes were made to conform to local customs. It will expand into Texas, in cities like Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio. In 2019, it was announced the first Texas location would be created in North Richland Hills.

==Partnerships==
Former professional basketball player Magic Johnson, through Johnson Development Corporation, was one of the owners of the parent company. Former talk show host Montel Williams co-owns several Fatburger restaurants in Colorado. Bay Area musician E-40 also had a stake in the company as a franchise owner, by opening the first San Francisco Bay Area Fatburger restaurant in Pleasant Hill, which is now closed. Actor and musician Queen Latifah also at one point partnered with Fatburger.

In 2007, rapper Kanye West&#x27;s restaurant company, KW Foods LLC, struck a deal to open up to 10 Fatburger restaurants in Chicago. Ultimately, in 2009, only two locations actually opened. In February 2011, West shut down the Fatburger located in Orland Park. R&amp;B musician Pharrell, in partnership with Fatburger, opened several Fatburger restaurants in China in 2007 and 2008.

==In popular culture==
Fatburger has been featured and/or seen in TV series and movies:

*&quot;Sanford and Son&quot; frequently mentioned Fatburger in conversation.
*In the 2001 film &quot;Rat Race&quot;, the Pear family were sitting inside a Fatburger. Later, Randy Pear buys sleeping pills and puts them in his family&#x27;s milkshakes.
*In the 2016 film &quot;Get a Job&quot;, Hank Diller is at his desk with food from Fatburger.
*On season 1 episode entitled &quot;Tickets for a Queue&quot; of the Apple TV+ series &quot;Trying&quot;, Jason and Erica are having a meal at Fatburger.

<doc id="1023974" wikidata="Q968698" url="?curid=1023974" title="Thomas Tomkins">
<text>Thomas Tomkins (1572 – 9 June 1656) was a Welsh-born composer of the late Tudor and early Stuart period. In addition to being one of the prominent members of the English Madrigal School, he was a skilled composer of keyboard and consort music, and the last member of the English virginalist school.

==Life==
Tomkins was born in St David&#x27;s in Pembrokeshire in 1572. His father, also Thomas, who had moved there in 1565 from the family home of Lostwithiel in Cornwall, was a vicar choral of St David&#x27;s Cathedral and organist there. Three of Thomas junior&#x27;s half-brothers, John, Giles and Robert, also became eminent musicians, but none quite attained the fame of Thomas. By 1594, but possibly as early as 1586, Thomas and his family had moved to Gloucester, where his father was employed as a minor canon at the cathedral. Thomas almost certainly studied under William Byrd for a time, for one of his songs bears the inscription: &quot;To my ancient, and much reverenced Master, William Byrd&quot;, and it may have been at this period of his career, since Byrd leased property at Longney, near Gloucester. Although documentary proof is lacking, it is also possible that Byrd was instrumental in finding young Thomas a place as chorister in the Chapel Royal. In any case, all former Chapel Royal choristers were required to be found a place at university, and in 1607 Tomkins was admitted to the degree of B.Mus. as a member of Magdalen College, Oxford.
But already in 1596 he had been appointed Organist at Worcester Cathedral. The next year, he married Alice Patrick, a widow nine years his senior, whose husband Nathaniel, who died in 1595, had been Tomkins&#x27; predecessor at Worcester. Thomas&#x27;s only son, Nathaniel, was born in Worcester in 1599, where he was to spend the rest of his life and become a respected musician.

Tomkins was acquainted with Thomas Morley, also a pupil of Byrd&#x27;s, for his signed copy of Morley&#x27;s publication &quot;Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke&quot; (1597) has been preserved, together with Tomkins&#x27; many annotations; and in 1601 Morley included one of Tomkins&#x27; madrigals in his important collection &quot;The Triumphs of Oriana&quot;.

In 1612, Tomkins oversaw the construction in Worcester cathedral of a magnificent new organ by Thomas Dallam, the foremost organ-builder of the day. He continued writing verse anthems, and his collection of 28 madrigals, the &quot;Songs of 3, 4, 5 and 6 parts&quot; was finally published in 1622 with a dedicatory poem by his half-brother John Tomkins (circa 1587–1638), now organist of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge (later of St Paul&#x27;s and of the Chapel Royal), with whom Thomas maintained an intimate and loving relationship.

Probably by about 1603, Thomas was appointed a Gentleman Extraordinary of the Chapel Royal. This was an honorary post, but in 1621 he became a Gentleman Ordinary and organist under his friend and senior organist, Orlando Gibbons. The duties connected with this post included regular journeys between Worcester and London, which Tomkins performed until about 1639.

On James I&#x27;s death in March 1625 Tomkins, with other Gentlemen of the Chapel Royal, was required to attend to both the music for James&#x27;s funeral and that for the coronation of Charles I. These monumental tasks proved too much for Gibbons, who died of a stroke in Canterbury, where Charles was supposed to meet his future bride, Henrietta Maria of France, placing an even greater strain on Tomkins. Because of plague, the coronation was luckily postponed until February 1626, giving Tomkins time to compose most of the eight anthems sung at the ceremony.

In 1628, Tomkins was named &quot;Composer of [the King&#x27;s] Music in ordinary&quot; at an annual salary of £40, succeeding Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger who died in March that year. But this prestigious post, the highest honour available to an English musician, was quickly revoked on the grounds that it had been promised to Ferrabosco&#x27;s son. This shabby treatment was to be only the first of a series of adversities that overtook the composer for the last fourteen years of his life. He continued, however, to perform his dual duties at Worcester and London until 1639.

Tomkins&#x27; devoted wife Alice died in 1642, the year civil war broke out. Worcester was one of the first casualties: the cathedral was desecrated, and Tomkins&#x27; organ badly damaged by the Parliamentarians. The following year, Tomkins&#x27; house near the cathedral suffered a direct hit by cannon shot, making it uninhabitable for a long period, and destroying most of his household goods and probably a number of his musical manuscripts. About this time Tomkins married his second wife Martha Browne, widow of a Worcester Cathedral lay clerk.

Further conflict and a siege in 1646 caused untold damage to the city. With the choir disbanded and the cathedral closed, Tomkins turned his genius to the composition of some of his finest keyboard and consort music; in 1647, he wrote a belated &quot;tombeau&quot; or tribute to Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, and a further one to the memory of William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, both of them beheaded in the 1640s, and both admired by Tomkins. Charles I was executed in 1649, and a few days later Tomkins, always a royalist, composed his superb &quot;Sad Pavan: for these distracted times&quot;. His second wife Martha died around 1653, and deprived of his living, Tomkins, now 81, was in serious financial difficulties. In 1654, his son Nathaniel married Isabella Folliott, a wealthy widow, and Thomas went to live with them in Martin Hussingtree, some four miles from Worcester. He expressed his gratitude by composing his &quot;Galliard, The Lady Folliot&#x27;s&quot; in her honour. Two years later he died and was buried in the churchyard of the Church of St Michael and All Angels in Martin Hussingtree on 9 June 1656.

==Works==
Tomkins wrote and published madrigals—amongst which &quot;The Fauns and Satyrs Tripping&quot;, included in Morley&#x27;s &quot;The Triumphs of Oriana&quot; (1601); &quot;Songs of 3,4,5 and 6 parts&quot; (1622); 76 pieces of keyboard (organ, virginal, harpsichord) music, consort music, anthems, and liturgical music. Stylistically he was extremely conservative, even anachronistic: he seems to have completely ignored the rising Baroque practice around him, with its Italian-inspired idioms, and he also avoided writing in most of the popular forms of the time, such as the lute song, or ayre. His polyphonic language, even in the fourth decade of the 17th century, was frankly that of the Renaissance. Some of his madrigals are extremely expressive, with text-painting and chromaticism worthy of Italian madrigalists such as Marenzio or Luzzaschi.

He was also a prolific composer of both full and verse anthems, writing more than almost any other English composer of the 17th century—surpassed (putatively) only by William Child—and several of his works for the church were contemporaneously copied for use elsewhere. The survival of his music was ensured by the posthumous publication, overseen by his son Nathaniel, of &quot;Musica Deo Sacra et Ecclesiae Anglicanae; or Music dedicated to the Honor and Service of God, and to the Use of Cathedral and other Churches of England&quot; (William Godbid, London: 1668); &quot;Musica Deo Sacra&quot; contains five services, five psalm tunes, the Preces and two proper psalms, and ninety-four anthems, and was published as a five-volume set—one volume each for Medius; Contratenor; Tenor; Bassus, and the Pars Organica.

<text>Elmer Albert Batters (November 24, 1919 – June 25, 1997) was a pioneer fetish photographer who specialized in capturing artful images of women with an emphasis on stockings, legs, and feet, placing him ahead of his time in popularizing foot fetishism imagery as erotic entertainment.

==Early life==
Batters was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He enlisted in the United States Navy on December 27, 1941, from Los Angeles, California. He served on the USS Sperry (AS-12) from May 1942 until September 1942 and the USS Silversides (SS-236) from September 1942 to April 1943. He also served on the USS Sunfish (SS-281) from April 1943 until April 1944, and became a Yeoman 1st Class.

==Career==
Batters started out publishing his photographs himself. In 1956, he founded and published &quot;Man&#x27;s Favorite Pastime&quot;, which was the first leg-art magazine. Since the early 1960s, his work was featured in magazines such as &quot;Sheer Delight&quot;, &quot;Black Silk Stockings&quot;, &quot;Leg-O-Rama&quot;, &quot;Nylon Doubletake&quot;, and &quot;Tip Top&quot;, to name but a few. He paved the way for such critically acclaimed modern foot-fetish photographers as Ed Fox and Johnny Jaan.

One of Batters&#x27; favorite fetish models was a Rubenesque woman named Caruschka. Little is known about the model&#x27;s life, but Batters was smitten with her, as were his fans. Several photo shoots featured the chubby, attractive Caruschka on a garden swing displaying her petite feet in classic foot-fetish &quot;Andalusian-fan&quot; poses, as well as exhibiting a set of fine high arches and well-formed calves.

&quot;When I say Caruschka was my favorite model,&quot; Batters once wrote, &quot;I don&#x27;t just mean me. No girl in the history of my leg-art business has attracted so many admirers as she. Kinda hard to believe these days; I know she is a little heavier than the fashion. Caruschka has charisma, though; she still shines through. She also has a beautiful set of full shapely legs, firm and thrusting tits, and delicate, high-arch feet. But are these things what make us love a woman? I think not. I think love or even sexual attraction comes from the sparkle in a girl&#x27;s eyes, the lift of her eyebrow, and the way her lips curl into that provocative smirk that hooks a man&#x27;s soul like a hapless mackerel. This is Caruscha&#x27;s strength. Her face seduces me even now--these 25 years later as it has seduced thousands of you. Go ahead and give in to her. Even back in the unliberated (years) when these photos taken, Caruschka was a girl who loved to have men masturbate over her. Yeah, she was a tease but isn&#x27;t every woman worth a damn?&quot;

As a foot-fetish pioneer starting in the 1950s, Batters helped make this formerly closeted field of sexual interest more acceptable. Near the end of his life, Batters was rediscovered by German publisher Benedikt Taschen, who produced three books of his work, including &quot;From the Tip of the Toes to the Top of the Hose&quot; and &quot;Legs That Dance to Elmer&#x27;s Tune&quot;. Taschen became acquainted with Batters&#x27; work in &quot;Leg Show&quot; magazine, where editor Dian Hanson introduced a new generation of fetishists to his photos during the 1980s and 1990s. Today, original photographic prints by Batters fetch up to $1,500 among fetish-art collectors.

Batters&#x27; military career is mentioned briefly in the out-of-print nonfiction book &quot;The Lonely Sky&quot; by test pilot William Bridgeman. This book tells the story of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s experimental Skyrocket supersonic plane program of the 1950s.

Taschen has published several books featuring the work of Elmer Batters.

<text>Quiet Storm Records is a Hawaii-based record label specializing in Hawaiian music.

==History==
The label was formed by John and Debra Iervolino in 1992. John Iervolino serves as president. The company has won a Na Hoku Hanohano Award. In 2001, Quiet Storm was not only the top independent Hawaiian label, but outpaced the major labels in the Hawaiian genre. In 2003, Quiet Storm&#x27;s sales surpassed the $1 million level, although its position within the Hawaiian music market had declined to 4th. The company has seen strong sales in Japan. Aside from music recording and production, the company has also set up a distribution division that includes music, books, and DVDs produced by other entities. A declining market for CDs, and accounts-receivable defaults are among the challenges faced by Quiet Storm.

==Output==
The label has become known for its compilation CDs, which intermingle artists which are only locally known with recordings, leased from major labels, of well-known artists. They have also found success with their own signed artists, including EA.

<text>The autokinetic effect (also referred to as autokinesis and the autokinetic illusion) is a phenomenon of visual perception in which a stationary, small point of light in an otherwise dark or featureless environment appears to move. It was first recorded in 1799 by Alexander von Humboldt who observed illusory movement of a star in a dark sky, although he believed the movement was real. It is presumed to occur because motion perception is always relative to some reference point, and in darkness or in a featureless environment there is no reference point, so the position of the single point is undefined. The direction of the movements does not appear to be correlated with involuntary eye movements, but may be determined by errors between eye position and that specified by efference copy of the movement signals sent to the extraocular muscles. Richard Gregory suggested that, with lack of peripheral information, eye movements which correct movements due to muscle fatigue are wrongly interpreted as movement of the perceived light.

The amplitude of the movements is also undefined. Individual observers set their own frames of reference to judge amplitude (and possibly direction). Because the phenomenon is labile, it has been used to show the effects of social influence or suggestion on judgements. For example, if an observer who would otherwise say the light is moving one foot overhears another observer say the light is moving one yard, then the first observer will report that the light moved one yard. Discovery of the influence of suggestion on the autokinetic effect is often attributed to Sherif (1935), but it was recorded by Adams (1912), if not others.

Alexander von Humboldt observed the phenomenon in 1799 while looking at stars with the naked eye, but thought it was a real movement of the stars. Thus, he named them &quot;Sternschwanken&quot;, meaning &quot;swinging stars&quot;. It was not until 1857 that G. Schweitzer showed that it was a subjective phenomenon: several observers all simultaneously viewing the same star reported different directions of the movement.

Many sightings of UFOs have been attributed to the autokinetic effect when looking at stars or planets.

The US Navy started studying autokinesis in 1945 in an attempt to explain vertigo experiences reported by pilots, but this &quot;kinetic illusion&quot; is now categorized as a vestibular-induced illusion: see vestibular system.

==In literature==
An evocative passage appears in H. G. Wells&#x27; novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. Although Wells ascribes the apparent &quot;swimming&quot; of the planet to telescope vibration and eye fatigue, it is likely that the autokinetic effect is also being described:
==In aviation==
The effect is well known as an illusion affecting pilots who fly at night. It is particularly dangerous for pilots flying in formation or rejoining a refueling tanker at night. Steps that can be taken to prevent or overcome the phenomenon include:
*Shifting your gaze frequently to avoid prolonged fixation on light sources.
*Attempting to view a target with a reference to stationary structures or landmarks.
*Making eye, head, and body movements to eliminate the illusion.
*Monitoring the flight instruments to prevent or resolve any perceptual conflict.

==In combat==
In his book documenting the opening stages of the second Gulf War from his position embedded with the 1st Marine Reconnaissance Battalion, Evan Wright documents an incident during which, at night in the Iraqi desert, the Marines observed the lights of a town approximately 40 kilometers away. These lights appeared to be moving and were suspected of belonging to a large combat force moving out to attack the marines. An airstrike was called in on the estimated position of the lights—estimated to be around 15 kilometers away—which resulted in no enemy assets being destroyed. It was later suggested by Major Shoup of the battalion that this misidentification was a result of autokinesis. In the HBO mini-series based on the book, this information was imparted to the viewer by the character of Sergeant Brad Colbert, who had correctly deduced that it was a town in both versions.

Night fighter and night bomber crews during the Second World War reported encounters with mysterious aerial phenomena, nicknamed foo fighters, which may have been caused by autokinesis or a similar effect.

==Autostasis==
The opposite effect of autokinesis is autostasis. It is when a moving bright light in a dark sky appears stationary.

<text>William Darcy McKeough (January 31, 1933 – November 29, 2023) was a Canadian politician in Ontario. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1963 to 1978 who represented the ridings of Kent West and Chatham—Kent. He was a cabinet minister in the governments of John Robarts and Bill Davis. Due to McKeough&#x27;s senior position in cabinet as Treasurer, Minister of Economics and Intergovernmental Affairs and Minister of Municipal Affairs, he was often referred to as the &#x27;Duke of Kent&#x27;.

After he retired from politics in 1978, McKeough spent a further career in business administering his companies McKeough Investments and McKeough Supply. He also spent time as a member of the board of Hydro One and was CEO of Union Gas.

==Background==
Born in Chatham, Ontario and educated at Ridley College in St. Catharines, Canada. After which received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Western Ontario in 1954.

==Politics==
From 1960 to 1961 and 1962 to 1963, McKeough was a member of the Chatham City Council.

In the 1963 provincial election, McKeough ran as the Progressive Conservative candidate in the southwestern Ontario riding of Kent West. He defeated Liberal candidate G.R. Newkirk by 1,739 votes. In 1967, he ran in the new riding of Chatham—Kent and defeated Liberal Tom Henry by 1,291 votes. He was re-elected in 1971, 1975 and 1977.

In 1966, McKeough was appointed to cabinet as a Minister without portfolio by Premier John Robarts. In 1967 he was promoted to Minister of Municipal Affairs after the previous minister, Wilf Spooner was defeated in the 1967 election. Among other things, he introduced legislation to create the city of Thunder Bay in Northern Ontario by an amalgamation of existing municipalities.

In 1971, McKeough entered the leadership race to replace Robarts who retired in December 1970. He was viewed as a compromise candidate between front runner Bill Davis and contender Allan Lawrence. He placed third in the contest which was won by Davis. After McKeough dropped out he endorsed Davis which was seen as a key move in Davis&#x27;s narrow victory. In return, Davis appointed McKeough to the senior cabinet post of Treasurer of Ontario and Minister of Economics.

In September 1972, McKeough resigned from cabinet when it was revealed in a story by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that he was involved in a conflict of interest when, as Minister of Municipal Affairs, his ministry had approved a housing development in which he was financially involved. In his resignation announcement, McKeough claimed he had done nothing wrong but felt that he could no longer continue in his position when his credibility would be continually questioned.

In 1973, McKeough was returned to cabinet as Minister of Energy. In January 1975, he was restored to the posts of Treasurer and Minister of Economics and Intergovernmental Affairs. In August 1978 he retired from politics.

==Later life and death==
After leaving political office in 1978, McKeough returned to the private sector and has had a number of positions, particularly in the energy sector. In 1994, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada for his &quot;successful business ventures and fund-raising efforts on behalf of educational, medical, research and cultural institutions&quot;.

McKeough died from complications of pneumonia on November 29, 2023, at the age of 90.
