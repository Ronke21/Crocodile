<text>Xabier Alonso Olano (, ; born 25 November 1981) is a Spanish professional football manager and former player from Tolosa, Spain, who is currently the head coach of Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen. He is regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation and is known for his exceptional passing range. Alonso is also considered to be one of the best young managers in the world.

Alonso began his career at Real Sociedad, the main team of his home province Gipuzkoa. After a brief loan period at Eibar, he was appointed as team captain of Real Sociedad and finished runner-up in La Liga in 2002–03 season. He moved to Liverpool in 2004 for £10.5 million and won the UEFA Champions League in his first season, scoring in the Final. He later won the FA Cup and the FA Community Shield. Alonso moved to Real Madrid in 2009 in a deal worth £30 million and won La Liga, two Copas del Rey, and another Champions League. He joined German club Bayern Munich in 2015 and won three Bundesliga titles, including a domestic double in his second season, and retired in 2017.

He made his international debut for Spain in April 2003 and went onto win Euro 2008, the 2010 World Cup, and Euro 2012. He also represented Spain at Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup. On 23 June 2012, Alonso won his 100th cap for Spain in the quarter-final of Euro 2012 against France, where he scored both goals in a victory. Alonso retired from international football after the 2014 World Cup. His 114 appearances make him the eighth-most capped player in Spain&#x27;s history.

Alonso coached Real Madrid&#x27;s U14 team before being appointed as manager of Real Sociedad B in 2019, where he won promotion to the Segunda División in his second season. Alonso was named head coach of Bayer Leverkusen in 2022 and completed an unprecedented unbeaten domestic double in 2024, winning the club&#x27;s first Bundesliga title and first DFB Pokal since 1993.

==Early years==
Alonso was born in the small town of Tolosa, Gipuzkoa, Basque Country, into a family known for its footballing prowess. His father, Periko Alonso, won La Liga twice in successive seasons with Real Sociedad and a third time after he joined Barcelona. He also featured in the national team, winning 21 caps over the course of his career.

Alonso lived in the city of Barcelona for the first six years of his life and moved to San Sebastián (Donostia) thereafter. It was here that his passion for football began as he whiled away his childhood playing at Playa de la Concha (Shell Beach). On the Basque sands, Alonso befriended a fellow resident of Calle Matia, Mikel Arteta, and the two would battle each other in exhibitions of technical ability. He was immersed in football and his father would often bring him and his older brother, Mikel, to Sabadell&#x27;s training ground to practise together. Alonso was influenced by his father&#x27;s playing, taking more pleasure in passing the ball well than shooting at goal. At an early age, he decided to play as a defensive midfielder, a role which helped him learn how to distribute the ball well. This talent would later prove to be an integral part of his club and international career.

Alonso and Arteta were ambitious and dreamed of playing alongside each other for Real Sociedad when they were older. Though they attended different schools, the two young players joined forces at the local youth side Antiguoko, playing games at the weekend. Their performances attracted the attention of scouts from top Spanish sides and the young &quot;Donostiarras&quot; separated ways, ending nine years of friendly rivalry, as Alonso went to Real Sociedad and Arteta moved to Catalan giants Barcelona. Alonso&#x27;s move to Real Sociedad, however, was not a companionless one, as his older brother Mikel, who had also become an adept player, joined the club together with him.

==Club career==
===Real Sociedad===
Alonso quickly progressed through the youth ranks and the reserve team at Real Sociedad (winning the regionalised fourth tier in his single season with the latter) and impressed enough to earn a first team debut at the age of 18. He made his first senior appearance against Logroñés in December 1999 in a Copa del Rey match. Alonso failed to make another appearance in the season but the following year brought more opportunities. At the beginning of the 2000–01 season, Javier Clemente sent him to Segunda División team Eibar to gain experience. Alonso&#x27;s father particularly felt the move to the smaller club improved him as a player. A quick turnover of managers, however, including a two-month period with Periko Alonso in charge, left Real Sociedad in a dire situation. By January 2001, Real Sociedad were bottom of the league and its new manager, John Toshack, turned to the prodigious Alonso in the hope of reversing the team&#x27;s fortunes. In a surprise move, the Welsh manager made the 20-year-old the team captain, a position traditionally held by more senior players. By the end of the season, Sociedad had climbed out of the relegation zone and finished in 14th place. Toshack lauded Alonso, noting that the impression he had on the team was exceptional, especially for a player from the youth team.

Under the tutelage of John Toshack, Alonso&#x27;s captaincy marked a resurgence of form for Real Sociedad. Toshack recognised Alonso&#x27;s potential and invested much time in his young captain, creating a training method designed to improve his touch and control specifically for him. The team cemented its mid-table position in the 2001–02, finishing in 13th place. Alonso appeared consistently in La Liga with 30 appearances over the course of the season and also scored his first league goal, finishing with a season total of three. Real Sociedad&#x27;s management changed again in the summer of 2002 with the arrival of Raynald Denoueix, but Alonso kept his place in the first team on the strength of his past performances.

The 2002–03 season was the club&#x27;s best league performance since the 1981–82 season, in which they won the league. The Basque team finished second, two points behind Real Madrid, setting a club record for their highest ever points total, and qualifying for the UEFA Champions League for the first time. Alonso received much praise for his role in the team&#x27;s success and was given the Best Spanish Player award by Spanish sports magazine &quot;Don Balón&quot;. In addition, Alonso significantly contributed to the team&#x27;s goal tally, scoring 12 goals in all competitions. His performances earned Alonso national repute and Iñaki Sáez, the coach of the Spain national team, called him up for the Spain national football team. Alonso made his international debut in April 2003 in a 4–0 friendly win over Ecuador. Sáez raved over Alonso, saying, &quot;He has a fantastic range of accurate passing [and] sees football with an extraordinary clarity.&quot;

The 2003–04 season comprised mixed results for Alonso and his San Sebastián club. Alonso revelled in the opportunity to perform in Europe, appearing in all the team&#x27;s games, and Real Sociedad qualified for the knockout phase of the Champions League. The team struggled under the pressure of the extra matches, however, and were promptly knocked out of the tournament by Lyon and finished 15th in La Liga. The combination of Alonso&#x27;s outstanding performances and the team&#x27;s poor league finish made a move away from Anoeta Stadium inevitable. Despite interest from La Liga champions Real Madrid, Alonso remained committed to Real Sociedad. Madrid failed to meet the £13 million price tag that José Luis Astiazarán, the Real Sociedad president, had placed on Alonso and the deal reached a stalemate. Alonso had other concerns and focused on international duty with Spain at UEFA Euro 2004. Despite the fact that Alonso&#x27;s appearance at the tournament was brief, he caught the attention of retired footballer Jan Mølby, who was impressed with his precise passing abilities.

The summer transfer window at Real Sociedad saw the arrival of Alonso&#x27;s childhood friend Mikel Arteta. Arteta was ecstatic at the prospect of partnering Alonso in midfield, but his excitement was short-lived. Alonso was not picked for Real Sociedad&#x27;s pre-season friendlies, signalling that an offer by Liverpool was being treated seriously. The Basque side announced on 20 August 2004 that they had made a deal worth £10.7 million with Liverpool and Alonso had agreed terms with the Merseyside team. Alonso did not lament the fact that a move to Real Madrid had not materialised. Instead, he concentrated on integrating with the new Spanish contingent at Liverpool under the guidance of former Valencia manager Rafael Benítez.

===Liverpool===
====2004–05: Champions League victory====
Alonso arrived at Liverpool along with Luis García from Barcelona, marking the beginning of a new era at Anfield. New Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez sought to revolutionise the club and completely overhauled the squad, impressing his own management style and tactics upon the team. The technical Spaniards were Benítez&#x27;s first signings and he remarked that their emphasis of skill over strength offered the team something different. Alonso made his Premier League debut against Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium on 29 August 2004. Liverpool lost the fixture 1–0 but Alonso was already receiving praise for his passing skills from the press. A Premier League tie away against Fulham displayed more of Alonso&#x27;s talents. Liverpool were losing 2–0 at half-time and Benítez brought on Alonso as a substitute after the break. He revived a deflated Liverpool and the game finished 2–4 to the Merseyside team. Furthermore, Alonso scored his first goal for the team from a free kick to bring Liverpool ahead of the opposition.

Alonso continued to provide important goals for the club, scoring his first goal at Anfield against Arsenal in a 2–1 victory. Alonso was elated at the achievement and felt he was settling in well in England. The Arsenal game marked the return of Steven Gerrard from injury but Alonso&#x27;s midfield partnership with the team captain came to a halt when Alonso suffered his first setback at Liverpool. Alonso&#x27;s ankle was broken following a tackle from Frank Lampard in Liverpool&#x27;s 0–1 home defeat against Chelsea on New Year&#x27;s Day 2005 and the Spaniard was ruled out of action for three months.

Alonso made his return to the first team in the second leg of the Champions League quarter-final against Juventus. Alonso was not at full fitness but, as Steven Gerrard was injured, he played for the full 90 minutes and Liverpool held the score at 0–0 in Italy, defeating the eventual Italian champions on aggregate. Kevin McCarra of &quot;The Guardian&quot; paid testament to Alonso&#x27;s skill and dedication to the game, saying, &quot;This marvellously accomplished footballer testified in the Stadio delle Alpi that technique can overcome a serious physical disadvantage.&quot; In the next round against Chelsea, Alonso received a yellow card in a tense and scrappy 0–0 draw at Stamford Bridge, making him suspended for the following fixture. Alonso was distraught that he would miss the game and vehemently contested the referee&#x27;s decision to no avail. Gerrard returned from injury for the second leg, however, and the captain steered his team to a 1–0 win with the help of a Luis García goal, qualifying for the final against Milan.

Liverpool&#x27;s fifth-place finish in the Premiership left much to be desired but debut season glory still awaited Alonso in the form of the Champions League final. The team fell three goals behind Milan but completed a dramatic second-half comeback. Liverpool, trailing 3–2, were awarded a penalty and it was decided that Alonso would take the spot kick. While Dida, Milan&#x27;s acclaimed Brazilian goalkeeper, managed to save the penalty Alonso fired the rebound into the roof of the net, bringing the score to 3–3. Extra time passed without a goal from either team and Liverpool won 3–2 in the penalty shootout. Alonso was praised for his pivotal influence on the team&#x27;s comeback and manager Benítez reinforced his importance to the team. Alonso was ecstatic with the win, commenting, &quot;This is the best moment in my professional career.&quot; The epic night was also recalled to be the &#x27;Miracle of Istanbul&#x27;.

====2005–06: FA Cup winner====
Alonso was ever-present in the first team in the 2005–06 season, largely avoiding injuries that had marred his first season at the club. The summer transfer window brought Peter Crouch to Liverpool and the striker&#x27;s height sparked accusations that the team would change to long ball tactics. Crouch denied this, highlighting that Alonso&#x27;s passing ability, alongside Gerrard, would define Liverpool&#x27;s style of play. Alonso faced more competition for his place in the form of new arrival Mohamed Sissoko. However, Steven Gerrard&#x27;s injuries and Rafael Benítez&#x27;s favouring of a 4–5–1 formation ensured Alonso&#x27;s place in the team. Alonso appeared in all of Liverpool&#x27;s games in the Champions League but the dominance shown in the previous season had gone as the team lost to Benfica in the knockout stage.

On 7 January 2006, in an FA Cup third-round tie against Luton Town, Alonso assisted Liverpool to a 5–3 comeback victory after being down 3–1 early in the second half. Alonso scored two impressive goals from distance: one from 45 yards, and the other 65 yards from goal; behind the half-way line. Consequently, Alonso&#x27;s goals marked a stroke of luck for a Liverpool fan who won £25,000 from a £200 bet on Alonso scoring from within his own half. Alonso suffered an ankle injury in a 1–3 away victory over Portsmouth, putting his participation in the FA Cup final in doubt. However, he recovered sufficiently to start the game against West Ham United and Gerrard scored Liverpool&#x27;s third goal from Alonso&#x27;s free kick, pulling the team ahead of the opposition. Alonso, still affected by the injury, could not manage the entire 90 minutes and was substituted in the second half. Liverpool won on penalties without his help but Alonso still earned his first FA Cup winners&#x27; medal.

====2006–2009====
On 20 September 2006, Alonso scored what the BBC described as &quot;an outrageous strike&quot; from his own half in a 2–0 Premiership win against Newcastle United. Andy Hunter of &quot;The Independent&quot; described it as &quot;one of the most audacious goals in Anfield&#x27;s rich 115-year history&quot;. Alonso rebutted claims that his 70-yard goal was all down to luck and stated that he took long range shots as part of his training routine. Despite the similarity of the goals struck from inside his own half, Alonso was in no doubt which was his best. He said, &quot;I think this was better. The Luton goal bounced a few times, this one went quite straight. The Luton one was left-footed – it was different – but I am quite happy to score the goal.&quot; It was his first goal for Liverpool since the goal against Luton, making distinct history as the only outfield player in modern professional football history to score two consecutive goals from inside his own half of the pitch.

On 8 June 2007, Alonso signed a five-year contract, stating, &quot;I knew there was interest from other clubs but it was always my idea to stay here. I have been here for three seasons now and have such special feelings for the club and the supporters. I understand what Liverpool means to so many people. It is such a special club and I just didn&#x27;t want to leave.&quot; The 2007–08 season started well for the Spaniard: Gerrard&#x27;s absence led to Alonso playing in a more advanced position and he scored twice in a 6–0 rout against Premier League newcomers Derby County. The bright beginning was short-lived, however, as a minor injury sustained in a game against Portsmouth became aggravated in training. The metatarsal injury forced him out of training for six weeks but his return to the first team was rushed and his injury recurred in his first game back. Alonso&#x27;s determination and passion proved to be his downfall, and he later reflected, &quot;I had been feeling a bit tired around that time because it was only my first game back and the match was very fast. But as a player you don&#x27;t want to come off, particularly when the team is winning and I stayed on.&quot;

Alonso returned from injury at December 2007, but over the following months he increasingly faced competition for a place in midfield from Javier Mascherano and Lucas. His role in Liverpool&#x27;s five-man midfield role was assured, however, as Rafael Benítez regarded him as &quot;a top class player&quot;, stating that Alonso had the ability to change games and break down the opposition&#x27;s defence. Alonso made his 100th league appearance for Liverpool on 12 January 2008 against Middlesbrough.

The 2008 summer transfer window suggested a move away from Merseyside, as Liverpool pursued England international Gareth Barry to replace Alonso. By the start of the 2008–09 season, neither Alonso or Barry had moved club but the drawn-out transfer saga had left the Spaniard feeling unsettled at Liverpool and unsure of his position in the team. However, the club&#x27;s fans did much to restore his spirits, supporting him on and off the pitch, and Alonso responded to this, saying:

:&quot;[The fans] couldn&#x27;t have done more to show me how they felt... If I went out for lunch or a coffee, there was always someone who would come over and say, &#x27;We&#x27;d love you to stay&#x27;. I&#x27;m just glad that, in the end, nothing came of it [the transfer] because it wasn&#x27;t something I ever asked for.&quot;

Despite the events of the summer, Alonso made a confident start to the season and both his peers and the press praised his strength of character, citing his influence as a factor in the team&#x27;s strong opening to the season. Alonso&#x27;s importance to the team was further underlined when he scored the only goal, through a deflection, in a 0–1 victory against Chelsea, making Liverpool the first away team to win at Stamford Bridge in over four years. Statistical analysis reflected Alonso&#x27;s good form: on 11 December, figures from Opta Sports revealed that he was the first Premier League player to complete 1,000 successful passes in the season. His last goal for Liverpool came in their 1–3 away win at Hull City on 25 April, striking after his free kick deflected off the Hull wall.

===Real Madrid===
====2009–10 season====
Alonso completed his £30 million move to Real Madrid on 5 August 2009. It has been suggested that he never wanted to leave the Anfield club, with his contract existing until at least 2012, and that his departure was due to differences with Benítez. Former teammate Steven Gerrard said he was &quot;devastated&quot; by Alonso&#x27;s decision, and cited his departure as one of the reasons behind Liverpool&#x27;s poor run of form at the start of the following season.

Alonso was given the number 22 jersey in Madrid and played in a holding midfield position. He scored his first goal for his new team on 21 February 2010, a penalty against Villarreal in a 6–2 win. Unless he was injured or suspended, Manuel Pellegrini started Alonso in every match of the Champions League and in La Liga in his first season at Real Madrid. In La Liga, he helped the club finish with a club-record 96 points, three points behind winners Barcelona. It was the third time in Alonso&#x27;s career that he helped his team set a new club record in terms of points gathered, while finishing in second position (he achieved the same feat with Real Sociedad in 2002–03 and with Liverpool in 2008–09). During his first season at Real Madrid, Alonso scored three goals and was considered one of the club&#x27;s &quot;most consistent&quot; players. Readers of &quot;Marca&quot; made him part of its &quot;La Liga&quot; team of the season, as their choice defensive midfielder; the only other Real Madrid player featured was Cristiano Ronaldo. Alonso received the same accolade from ESPN Soccernet. He was also a nominee in the LFP Awards, awards given out by the Liga de Fútbol Profesional, the Spanish Football league. Alonso was nominated in the Best Midfielder category, alongside Xavi and Javi Martínez. Several members of the Spanish press, as well as a number of Real Madrid supporters, gave Alonso a new nickname during the season: &quot;La Barba Roja&quot; (&quot;The Red Beard&quot;).

====2010–14====
Alonso&#x27;s second season at Real Madrid started with the arrival of a new manager, José Mourinho. He was given the number 14 jersey after the departure of vice-captain Guti. He did not score any goals that whole season but helped Real Madrid win the Copa del Rey.

Alonso began his third season at Madrid by scoring the second goal in a 2–2 draw against Barcelona in the 2011 Supercopa de España at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. On 21 September 2011, he played his 100th official game for Real Madrid in the 0–0 draw against Racing de Santander. Alonso claimed the first league title of his career.

On 8 January 2014, Alonso signed a contract extension with Real Madrid, which would have kept him at the club until 2016. On 29 April 2014, Real Madrid defeated Bayern Munich 4–0 in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final to qualify for the final on a 5–0 aggregate win. Alonso received a yellow card after a sliding tackle on Bastian Schweinsteiger in the first half; as he already had two before the match, this ruled him out of the final. He claimed his second Champions League winners medal as Real defeated Atlético Madrid 4–1 in extra time.

===Bayern Munich===
On 29 August 2014, Alonso moved to Bayern Munich on a two-year deal for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut the following day, starting in a 1–1 draw at Schalke 04. On 27 September 2014, in the match against 1. FC Köln, Alonso broke the record for most passes completed in a Bundesliga game, with 196. He scored his first goal for the club on 18 October 2014, a free kick in a 6–0 win over Werder Bremen.

In his 100th Champions League appearance, on 17 February 2015, Alonso was sent-off for a second bookable offence in a 0–0 draw against Shakhtar Donetsk. On 28 April, he was one of four Bayern players, all FIFA World Cup winners, to miss in a 2–0 penalty shootout defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the DFB-Pokal semi-final. He was also the only player to miss as the club lost the shootout at the end of the 2015 DFL-Supercup away to VfL Wolfsburg, his attempt being saved by goalkeeper Koen Casteels.

Alonso signed a new contract with Bayern on 18 December 2015, keeping him at the club until 2017. On 9 March 2017, Alonso confirmed via Twitter his retirement from the game at the end of the 2016–17 season. He and Bayern captain Philipp Lahm played their final professional game on 20 May, in a 4–1 victory at home to Freiburg in which he assisted the opening goal for Arjen Robben. He was substituted off in the 82nd minute for Franck Ribéry.

==International career==
===Euro 2004===
Alonso was first called up for the Spain national football team by manager Iñaki Sáez for a friendly against Ecuador on 30 April 2003, aged 21. He started in the 4–0 win at the Vicente Calderón Stadium.

Sáez named Alonso in the UEFA Euro 2004 squad in Portugal. He was a substitute in the win over Russia, and started the defeat to the hosts, in a group stage exit.

===2006 World Cup===
Alonso was named in the Spanish squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and he scored Spain&#x27;s first goal of the tournament, his first international goal, against Ukraine on 14 June 2006. After Spain won all their games of the group phase, they were beaten by the eventual finalists France in the first knockout stage of the tournament.

===Euro 2008===
Liverpool&#x27;s 2007–08 season finished trophyless but the opportunity to win honours awaited Alonso in the form of the Euro 2008 tournament. Alonso featured mainly as a substitute but, with key players resting, he captained Spain in the final group game against Greece, earning the man of the match award. Despite a strong performance, he could not attain a starting position in the team, highlighting Spain&#x27;s strength in depth. Spain went on to win the tournament and he featured in four of their six matches. Speaking to Spanish journalist Guillem Balagué, he said that Spain&#x27;s victory was deserved and the players&#x27; teamwork had been crucial to the team&#x27;s undefeated run in the tournament. The Basque was ecstatic at the achievement, declaring, &quot;Right now, we&#x27;re all just living the moment. It&#x27;s incredible and we&#x27;re all walking around in a dream. It&#x27;s fantastic.&quot; Alonso scored twice in a 3–0 win in a friendly against Denmark on 20 August.

===2009 Confederations Cup===
At the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup in South Africa, Spain were eliminated in the semi-finals by the United States. In the third-place play-off against the hosts, the game went to extra time after finishing 2–2; Alonso scored a free kick in the 107th minute to win the game.

===2010 World Cup===
Alonso started every game for Spain during the 2010 tournament, playing alongside Sergio Busquets and Xavi in midfield and helping his side to lift their first World Cup trophy. In the 28th minute of the final against the Netherlands, he received a &quot;Kung fu-style&quot; kick to the chest from Dutch midfielder Nigel de Jong, the foul was controversial since it appeared to be a foul worthy of a straight red, but was only ruled out to be a yellow card given by referee Howard Webb. This left Alonso in pain and in fear of a broken rib. Despite this pain, he continued playing on for another hour.

===Euro 2012===
On 23 June 2012, Alonso played his 100th match for Spain in the quarter-finals against France in which he scored both goals in a 2–0 victory. The first goal came after he headed a cross from the left flank delivered by Jordi Alba, while the second one came from a penalty kick given after Pedro was fouled by Anthony Réveillère in the dying seconds of the match. Alonso&#x27;s penalty in the semi-final shoot-out against Portugal was saved by Rui Patrício in which Spain went on to win 4–2 after a 0–0 draw in the game itself. Spain went on to beat Gianluigi Buffon and Italy 4–0 in the finals; this was Alonso&#x27;s third major title win with Spain.

===2014 World Cup===
Spain were again amongst the favourites for cup victory in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, but were eliminated in the first round. Alonso scored a penalty in the 27th minute of their first match against the Netherlands, though he was substituted in the 62nd minute with Spain down 2–1 before losing 5–1. Spain then lost 2–0 to Chile, in which Alonso received a yellow card in the first half and was substituted at half-time with the score already at 2–0. Spain were then eliminated from the tournament but did win their final match 3–0 against Australia and finished third in the group; Alonso played 83 minutes in the match.

Alonso retired from international football on 27 August 2014.

===Basque Country===
Alonso made his debut for the Basque Country national team in a friendly against Ghana on 29 December 2001 and received regular call ups since, while – due to his busy club schedule – not always being able to appear. Most recently, Alonso appeared for Basque on 29 December 2012 in a 6–1 victory over Bolivia.

==Style of play==
A consistent and hardworking midfielder, Alonso is regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation, and was effective both creatively and defensively.

With good technique, excellent vision, and varied passing range, he excelled in the centre in a deep-lying playmaking role, where he utilized his accurate long passing ability to create goal scoring chances for teammates; he also utilized a powerful and accurate shot from distance, and he was an effective set-piece and penalty kick taker. Due to his height, positioning, and physical characteristics, Alonso was also effective in the air, often contributing with headed goals from set pieces when he advanced into more offensive positions.

In addition to his creative attributes, he was also capable of excelling as a defensive midfielder due to his strength and powerful physique, combined with his tenacity, tactical intelligence, aggressive tackling and his ability to read the game. He was at times criticised, however, for occasionally committing rash challenges and for his tendency to lose his composure and pick up unnecessary cards for particularly hard fouls.

Regarding Alonso&#x27;s playing style, Jonathan Wilson noted in a 2013 article for &quot;The Guardian&quot; that he was an example of a more creative interpreter of the holding midfield role, who, &quot;although capable of making tackles, focused on keeping the ball moving, occasionally raking long passes out to the flanks to change the angle of attack like an old-style regista.&quot; His role has also been likened to that of a &quot;metodista&quot; (&quot;centre-half,&quot; in Italian football jargon), due to his ability to dictate play in midfield as well as assist his team defensively.

Since retiring, Steven Gerrard has claimed that he believes Alonso was the best midfielder he has ever played alongside. Moreover, in 2017, his former Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola, to whom he has occasionally been compared due to their similar role and playing style, described Alonso as one of the best midfielders he had ever seen in his life.

==Coaching and managerial career==

=== Early years ===
==== Real Madrid U14 ====
In 2018, whilst completing his UEFA Elite coaching course alongside former international teammates Raúl, Xavi, Víctor Valdés, and Joan Capdevila, Alonso returned to Real Madrid where he assumed a role coaching the Real Madrid U14s.

===Real Sociedad B===
Alonso was appointed manager of Segunda División B club Real Sociedad B on 1 June 2019, and began the role on 9 July. On his debut on 24 August, he drew 1–1 at home to Burgos.

In Alonso&#x27;s second season at &quot;Sanse&quot;, the club won promotion to the Segunda División, following a play-off win against Algeciras on 22 May 2021. The win signified Real Sociedad B&#x27;s first season back in the Segunda División since 1961–62. That March, despite being heavily linked to the soon-to-be vacant manager role at Borussia Mönchengladbach, Alonso signed a one-year extension with the club.

In his first game in the second tier on 14 August 2021, Alonso won 1–0 at home against Leganés through a Jon Karrikaburu goal. On 25 May 2022, Real Sociedad announced that Alonso would leave &quot;Sanse&quot; at the end of the season, with the side already relegated from the second level.

===Bayer Leverkusen===

==== 2022–23: Rise from the relegation zone ====
On 5 October 2022, Alonso was appointed as the new head coach of Bayer Leverkusen until June 2024. He replaced Gerardo Seoane with the team second from bottom after eight Bundesliga games, having their worst start to a season since 1979. He debuted three days later with a 4–0 home win over Schalke 04. In Leverkusen&#x27;s first European semifinal in 21 years, he was eliminated by his former Real Madrid manager José Mourinho&#x27;s Roma via a single first-leg goal. At the end of the season, Bayer Leverkusen finished in sixth place and qualified for next season&#x27;s Europa League. In May 2023, Alonso confirmed that he would remain for a second season, amidst interest from Tottenham Hotspur.

==== 2023–24: Historic domestic double and unbeaten run ====
On 4 August, Alonso signed a new contract until 2026. During the summer transfer window, he signed players including Switzerland captain Granit Xhaka, Jonas Hofmann, Alejandro Grimaldo and Matej Kovar. Alonso set his team up in a 3–4–3 formation with an emphasis on passing and counter-attack, while also only conceding five goals from open play in their first 11 Bundesliga fixtures. In the 2023–24 UEFA Europa League group stage, the team won all six games, with 19 goals scored. Leverkusen set a new record for unbeaten games, surpassing Bayern Munich&#x27;s 32 in February 2024.

Alonso was linked to become the new manager of former clubs Bayern Munich, Liverpool and Real Madrid. However, on 29 March 2024, he reaffirmed his commitment to complete his contract. On 14 April, Alonso led Leverkusen to a 5–0 win over Werder Bremen to clinch their first Bundesliga title and first German championship in history, with five games remaining. On 9 May, he guided his team to achieve a new European record of 49 competitive matches without defeat in all competitions, following a 2–2 draw against Roma in the Europa League semi-final second leg, breaking Benfica&#x27;s record of 48 games unbeaten between 1963 and 1965. The streak was further extended to 51 matches without defeat with two additional Bundesliga wins, making for a full unbeaten Bundesliga season, before bringing it to an end with a 3–0 loss to Atalanta in the 2024 UEFA Europa League final. Leverkusen obtained 40 points more than the previous season, like Stuttgart, a Bundesliga record. Club records were broken as well, namely 28 wins, 90 points, 89 goals scored, 24 goals conceded, 10 games won in a row, and 16 clean sheets in a season. Alonso&#x27;s Bayer Leverkusen also claimed the 2023–24 DFB-Pokal on 25 May, defeating 1. FC Kaiserslautern 1–0 in the final to complete a domestic double.

==Personal life==
Alonso was regarded as a quiet and friendly person by his teammates at Liverpool. He is married to Nagore Aranburu and the couple have three children—one son (born 2008) and two daughters (born 2010 and 2013). In March 2008, instead of travelling with the team, Alonso stayed in Merseyside to be at his wife&#x27;s side while she gave birth, saying, &quot;It was a little frustrating to miss the match against Inter but I have to be with my family at times like these.&quot; His decision to place his family ahead of a Champions League tie caused friction with manager Rafael Benítez.

Alonso and Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta were neighbours on the same street while growing up in San Sebastián, going on to live near each other in Liverpool while Arteta was an Everton player. Alonso convinced Arteta to transfer to Everton after he told him how happy he was living in Liverpool. Alonso also helped persuade former Real Sociedad teammate Juan Ugarte to make a move to Wales by joining Wrexham in 2004.

Alonso&#x27;s brother Mikel played for Spanish club Real Unión. He previously spent a season on loan at Bolton Wanderers in the 2007–08 season with an option for a permanent deal. However, the team opted not to extend the loan deal and he returned to Spain to train with Alonso&#x27;s former club, Real Sociedad. Alonso also has another brother involved in football, Jon, who works as a referee.

Alonso is a Meath Gaelic football supporter. His interest in the Irish sport stems from the age of 15 when he stayed with a family in the Irish town of Kells, County Meath to learn English, and played the sport in his spare time.

Even while playing at Real Madrid, Alonso has declared himself a Liverpool supporter and returns to watch games at Anfield when his schedule allows. He was quoted in &quot;The Times Online&quot; in 2011 as saying, &quot;I am still a Liverpool fan and will be forever, absolutely&quot; and that he will raise his Liverpool-born son as a Red supporter.

<text>Royal Air Force Wittering or more simply RAF Wittering is a Royal Air Force station within the unitary authority area of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire and the unitary authority area of North Northamptonshire. Although Stamford in Lincolnshire is the nearest town, the runways of RAF Wittering cross the boundary between Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire.

==History==

===First World War===
Wittering&#x27;s use as a military airfield dates back to 5 May 1916 when it began as RFC Stamford. The aerodrome was initially created for A Flight of No. 38 (Home Defence) Squadron. In common with other Home Defence squadrons at the time it was used for training during the day and for air defence at night. From the flight&#x27;s operational declaration in December 1916 until it deployed to France in November 1917, its BE2cs, RE7s, and FE2bs were involved in anti-Zeppelin patrols.

The station&#x27;s training role expanded when it became the Royal Flying Corps&#x27;s No.1 Training Depot Station in 1917. The neighbouring airfield, RFC Easton on the Hill, also dates back to 1916 and it became No. 5 Training Depot Station in 1917. Following the formation of the Royal Air Force, Easton on the Hill became RAF Collyweston on 1 April 1918. Stamford was retitled RAF Wittering on 10 April 1918.

=== Interwar period ===

==== Flying Training ====
RAF Wittering officially reopened in 1924 following an Air Defence Review in 1923. A significant amount of development took place to re-open the station including four new accommodation blocks for airmen, a corporals and airmen&#x27;s institute, a Senior Non-Commissioned Officers&#x27; Mess, the Officers&#x27; Mess, and a new guardroom. The station retained two aircraft hangars from 1917 and an aircraft repair shed. The Central Flying School was at Wittering from 1926 until 1935 being replaced by No. 11 Flying Training School until 1938.

==== Preparation for War – Fighter Command ====
In April 1938, the station became a Fighter Command station within No 12 Group. This conversion required another expansion with more land being purchased to the south and east of the station which closed the Stamford to Oundle road. Further airmen&#x27;s accommodation, airmen&#x27;s mess, technical accommodation and station headquarters were constructed as was a sector control room to control fighter squadrons and anti-aircraft gun batteries within 12 Group&#x27;s &#x27;K&#x27; Sector. The airfield was enhanced with the construction of three new Type C (1934 variant) hangars.

=== Second World War ===
During the Second World War, the station was very active during the Battle of Britain and the Blitz in 1940–41 in No. 12 Group (controlled from RAF Watnall in Nottingham) as it was the main fighter station for a lot of the southern East Midlands, and fighters from the station would often patrol as far as Birmingham. During the Battle of Britain many squadrons were rotated through Wittering to spells in the south of England with No. 11 Group that was bearing the brunt of the battle. With many of the Luftwaffe raids during the Blitz taking part at night, Wittering-based squadrons were instrumental in the development of night combat techniques. These included the use of the Turbinlite aircraft which replaced the nose with a powerful searchlight insulated in the nose of Havocs and Bostons. In April 1943 No. 141 Squadron were moved in, operating de Havilland Mosquitoes. 1943 also saw the station host 2 USAAF squadrons, albeit temporarily: 63 Fighter Squadron USAAF with its P47s operated from Wittering between January and March before moving to RAF Horsham St Faith; 55 Fighter Squadron operated its P38s and P51s from Wittering between August and March 1944 before moving to nearby RAF Kingscliffe.

Emergency landing ground K3 was renamed as Collyweston Landing Ground in 1940 with the construction of some blister hangars, a perimeter track and some dispersals, although the next main fighter station further north was RAF Coleby Grange. Embry in &quot;Mission Completed&quot; states that in 1940 (the station&#x27;s official history indicates that this was actually in 1941), while used by 25 squadron, equipped with Beaufighter night fighters, the runway was extended from 1,400 yards to 3 miles long to reduce landing accidents at night and in bad weather.

The Station&#x27;s innovative role continued and developed throughout the war. It became the home of both fighter and gunnery research and development units working with new equipment and techniques. In addition, No. 1426 (Captured Enemy Aircraft) Flight (colloquially known as the RAFwaffe) was based at Collyweston Landing Ground with its wide range of captured Luftwaffe aircraft both evaluating their performance and touring allied bases. In January 1945, the captured enemy aircraft were removed.

During the war, the airfield was bombed five times, with seventeen people being killed on 14 March 1941. Aircraft from the station downed 151 Luftwaffe aeroplanes and 89 V-1 flying bombs. Hugh Jenkins, Baron Jenkins of Putney served at the station, as did Andrew Humphrey (later Chief of the Defence Staff from 1976 to 1977, who flew Supermarine Spitfires with 266 Squadron).

===Post-war use===
==== Bomber Command ====
Immediately after the war RAF Wittering, once again, transferred back to Fighter Command in 1946 providing a home to a variety of squadrons operating Spitfires, Mosquitos and Hornets. In 1948, the Station transferred back to Training Command for 2 years before Maintenance Command took responsibility to undertake some significant redevelopment between 1950 and 1952 as the Cold War saw RAF Wittering become a vital part of the United Kingdom&#x27;s strategic nuclear deterrent under the control of Bomber Command in 1953.

The current airfield was created by the merging of RAF Wittering and nearby Collyweston Relief Landing Ground, by the construction of a 1.7-mile runway between them in 1941. Conversion to a Bomber airfield saw the construction of a new concrete runway (slightly to the south of the 1941 runway), taxiways and dispersals (with further H-dispersals and QRA dispersals being added later) that still form the majority of the Station&#x27;s aircraft operating surfaces. A wide-span Gaydon hangar for the Canberra B2 bombers was constructed along with a new control tower, avionics building and nuclear storage and maintenance facilities.

In its new guise as a bomber station, RAF Wittering initially operated Avro Lincolns from 1953 although these were replaced by English Electric Canberras later that year. The first British operational atomic bomb, the Blue Danube, was deployed to RAF Wittering in November 1953. The first V-bombers (the Vickers Valiant, the Handley Page Victor and the Avro Vulcan) were delivered in July 1955. In 1957–58 tests were carried out on the first British hydrogen bomb. This was fitted into the existing Blue Danube casing, and four Valiant bombers flew out of Wittering to Christmas Island in the Pacific, one of them dropping the first device on 15 May 1957 on Operation Grapple.

Until January 1969 two squadrons (100 and 139) of Victor B.2 bombers equipped with Blue Steel stand-off missiles were part of the QRA (Quick Reaction Alert) force of the RAF. Two nuclear armed aircraft were permanently on 15 minutes readiness to take off. They were parked within of the westerly runway threshold. In times of higher tension, four bombers could be stationed beside the runway on the ORP (Operational Readiness Platform). If the aircraft were manned they could all be airborne within 30 seconds, a feat often demonstrated at V force stations across the country. Since the incoming missile warning from the RAF Fylingdales BMEWS array was only four minutes before impact this ensured if the country came under attack, the bombers would be scrambled and able to retaliate.

In 1968, the base became part of Strike Command. From October 1972 until August 1976, there were two squadrons flying the Hawker Hunter No. 45 Squadron initially and then 58 Squadron as well.

====Harriers====
From 1968 the station was known as the Home of the Harrier: the first Harriers arrived for No. 1(Fighter) Squadron in August 1969.

In May 1971, four aircraft from 1(F) Sqn operated from HMS Ark Royal, the first time the Harrier had operated from an aircraft carrier, under Wing Commander (later Sir) Kenneth Hayr, later killed at the Biggin Hill airshow on 2 June 2001.

In 1982, six Harrier GR3 aircraft were taken down to the Falklands on SS Atlantic Conveyor, and survived the Exocet attack, later to board HMS Hermes in May 1982. In June 1982, 12 GR3 aircraft were flown from Wittering, via RAF Ascension Island and mid-air refuelling with Victor tankers, on an 8,000-mile journey to the Falklands in 17 hours, which set an RAF record. The Harriers were from 1(F) Sqn. On 27 May 1982, Sqn Ldr (later Gp Capt) Bob Iveson was hit by anti-aircraft fire from GADA 601&#x27;s 35mm cannon, and he ejected seconds before his aircraft exploded in mid-air near Goose Green. He evaded capture for two and a half days before being rescued by helicopter.

The Queen visited the station in June 1982 as part of the RAF Regiment&#x27;s 40th anniversary celebrations.

During January 1992, a new station museum opened in the original station church, which was built in 1944.

It was announced in December 2009 that RAF Wittering was to become the sole operational base for the Harriers of Joint Force Harrier after the announcement that RAF Cottesmore was to close. However, as a result of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, the Harrier fleet was withdrawn in December 2010.

In March 2019, the Ministry of Defence indicated that RAF Wittering, alongside RAF Waddington and RAF Leeming, was being considered as the future home of the RAF Aerobatic Team the Red Arrows. In May 2020 however it was confirmed that the team would move to Waddington.

==Role and operations==
In 2016 the Ministry of Defence confirmed that the Station would be one of the RAF&#x27;s &#x27;well found centres of specialisation for&#x27; &#x27;Support Enablers&#x27; along with RAF Leeming.

=== Command ===
The station is part of No 2 Group. The station commander of RAF Wittering is currently Wing Commander Jeremy Case who assumed command from Group Captain Jo Lincoln on 10 June 2021. The station&#x27;s honorary air commodore is Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Edinburgh.

=== Royal Air Force Engineering and Logistics Support Enablers ===
The station is the home of the RAF Support Force (the Royal Air Force&#x27;s engineering and logistic Air Combat Service Support Units (ACSSUs)).

=== Flying Training ===
Previously the home of No 1 Training Depot Station (at Stamford aerodrome) and No 5 Training Depot Station (at Easton on the Hill aerodrome) of the Royal Flying Corps during World War 1 and then the Royal Air Force&#x27;s Central Flying School and No. 11 Flying Training School between the World Wars. RAF Wittering&#x27;s return to flying training was marked on 4 February 2015 with the arrival of Cambridge University Air Squadron and the University of London Air Squadron. RAF Wittering is also the birthplace of the Royal Air Force Gliding &amp; Soaring Association&#x27;s Four Counties Gliding Club.

=== Royal Engineers ===
In November 2011 the Ministry of Defence announced that 44 Service personnel from HQ 12 (Air Support) Engineer Group, part of the Royal Engineers, would move from Waterbeach Barracks to RAF Wittering in 2012–13.

<text>Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat (; ; Italian: &quot;San Giovanni Capo Ferrato&quot;) is a commune in the Alpes-Maritimes department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region in Southeastern France. In 2012, Cap Ferrat was named the second most expensive residential location in the world after Monaco.

Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat is located on a peninsula next to Beaulieu-sur-Mer and Villefranche-sur-Mer and extends out to Cap Ferrat. Its tranquility and warm climate make it a favourite holiday destination among the European aristocracy and international rich who visit the French Riviera.

==History==
Saint Jean Cap Ferrat was known to the ancient Greeks as Anao. The site of present-day Cap Ferrat was first settled by Celto-Ligurian tribes, then by the Lombards at the end of the 6th century. Sant Ospizio (or Saint Hospice), a hermit friar, is said to have inhabited a tower on the Eastern part of the peninsula.

===Middle Ages===
Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat had once been known as Cap-Saint-Sospir after a sixth-century monk who had lived in the area. In the 8th century, the history of Saint Jean Cap Ferrat changed when the Saracens occupied the site and used it as a base for pirating until the 11th century.

By 1388, the territory of Saint Jean Cap Ferrat with the entire County of Nice was given by treaty to the Dukes of Savoy (see also History of Villefranche-sur-Mer).

The history of Saint Jean Cap Ferrat tells that Duke Emmanuel Philibert of Savoy built a fort at Saint-Hospice in 1561 in an effort to secure the coastline from invaders. The fort was destroyed in 1706 by the Duke of Berwick when Nice was occupied by the French armies of King Louis XIV.

===Renaissance===
During the 18th century, the history of Saint Jean Cap Ferrat changed when the area - officially part of the Kingdom of Sardinia - was occupied off and on by the French. It was returned to the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1814 after Napoleon&#x27;s abdication.

In 1860, the County of Nice was finally ceded by treaty to France and the peninsula became a magnet for kings and wealthy visitors, a new era in the history of Saint Jean Cap Ferrat. The small fishing village of Saint Jean developed and by 1904 was established as a self-standing commune with the rest of the peninsula, separated from nearby Villefranche-sur-Mer.

===Belle Époque era of economic prosperity===
At the beginning of the 20th century, King Léopold II of Belgium owned an estate on Cap Ferrat and built several houses and an artificial lake. The main residence is the Villa des Cèdres, which has been owned by Marnier-Lapostolle (the founder of Grand Marnier) since 1924 and is now in part a botanical garden called the Jardin botanique Les Cèdres.

In 1905, Béatrice Ephrussi de Rothschild chose Cap Ferrat to build a Tuscan-style palazzo, now known as Villa Ephrussi de Rothschild museum. This very scenic location can be rented under special conditions to host galas and events in the lush park and gardens.

Today Saint-Jean Cap-Ferrat has probably some of the most expensive real estate in the world, and continues to attract the rich. Current residents include theatrical composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.

Some of its Italianate and belle époque estates have hosted a plethora of heads of state, aristocrats, and personalities: King Leopold II of Belgium, Baroness de Rothschild, Charlie Chaplin, Rainier III, David Niven, Somerset Maugham, Jean Cocteau, Lady Kenmare and Roderick Cameron, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, Pierre and São Schlumberger, Hubert de Givenchy, Rachel Lambert Mellon, Mary Wells Lawrence, Isadora Duncan, Winston Churchill, French prime ministers Maurice Rouvier and Raymond Barre. Major Berkeley Levett, an English aristocrat and witness in the infamous Royal Baccarat Scandal, lived there with his brewery heiress wife, the former Sibell Bass.

==Population==
==Climate==

Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat has a mild Mediterranean climate. Average temperatures range from in January to in the summer. There is very little rainfall in the summer. Although occasionally the Mistral winds arrive, it is more sheltered by the mountains than for example St. Tropez, so the winds are not as strong.

===Winter===
The temperatures drop below for only three months of the year (December to February), and winters on the French Riviera are balmy in comparison to the cold and gloomy weather that predominates the northern European countries.

==Townscape==

Nicknamed as one of the pearls on the French Riviera, this quiet fishing village is renowned in the whole world for its peninsula of lush vegetation and rocky beaches, close to other popular resorts such as Èze, the Principality of Monaco and Cannes.

===Beaches===
Paloma beach
southeast of the port, on the north side small peninsula (St Hospice). Being on a northeast-facing shore and at the base of some tall cliffs. The location is about a 5–10 minutes walk from the port.

Passable beach
is on the northwest side of the main peninsula, past the Office de Tourisme and past the zoo (parc zoologique). It&#x27;s west-facing, with a view across the Rade de Villefranche.

Cro de Peï Pin
is the biggest beach, located just north of the port at the Anse Lilong (the bay between the main peninsula and the smaller Ste Hospice peninsula), facing eastward into the Baie des Fourmis and the Tete de Chene. There&#x27;s a public parking lot alongside the beach.

===Le Zoo Parc du Cap-Ferrat===
The Zoo du Cap-Ferrat, which closed down in 2011, had an impressive collection of fauna and flora. There were over 300 varieties of plants, including succulents and cacti. There were also eucalyptus trees that were over 100 years old. A variety of animals also resided in the zoo.

===St Hospice===
There is a very large bronze statue of the Madonna and Child, the early-19th century chapel, and a military cemetery for the 1914-18 war.

===Le Phare===
A highlight of St-Jean-Cap-Ferrat is the lighthouse, built in 1862 by decision of Napoleon III who wanted to equip the French littoral with a semaphoric chain. The goal was to ensure a monitoring of navigation, transmit messages to the ships, organize help in the event of maritime disasters, and take part in the first maritime meteorological observations.

===Port de Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat===
This is a small marina with 560 berths. It is very well-sheltered and quiet, located on the French Riviera.

===Grand-Hôtel du Cap-Ferrat===
Built in 1908, this stately white palace has hosted many worldwide personalities since it was erected, such as Paul Deschanel, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, Queen Victoria&#x27;s daughter, who remained a guest for many seasons and was often visited by her brother the Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, who lived for twenty years on Cap Ferrat.

==Culture==

During the Belle Époque the Cap-Ferrat was already the vacation resort of the world elite: the great names of the era came there during winter to enjoy its climate and quality of life. In his song &quot;I Went to a Marvellous Party,&quot; Noël Coward included the lyric &quot;Living in error/With Maud at Cap Ferrat/Which couldn&#x27;t be right.&quot;

===Musée Île-de-France===
The Villa Ephrussi de Rothschild (or Musée Île-de-France) is an Italian-style villa built between 1905 and 1912 on the request of Baronness Béatrice Ephrussi de Rothschild. It contains a large art collection and fine furnishing. The villa grounds have an extensive set of seven gardens designed in different styles: French Traditional, Florentine, Spanish, Exotic, Lapidary, Japanese, and Provençal. The villa is located at the northern end (entrance) of the peninsula.

===Les Azuriales Opera Festival===
The Les Azuriales Opera Festival, founded in 1997, takes place each year in August in Villa Ephrussi de Rothschild.

===Local cuisine===
With its coastal location, cuisine in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat is based around seafood. Dishes include &quot;escalope de mérou au citron&quot;, which is sea bass steaks in lime; salmon tournedos with truffles; cod and vegetables in garlic sauce; and skate with capers. Meat dishes include estouffade de sanglier (wild boar) and fillet de beef rossini cooked with foie gras.

==Economy==
One of Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat&#x27;s main sources of income is tourism. The main attractions of Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat are its pleasant climate, history and its circuit of yachts, which attract thousands of tourists every year. Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat also has a small port of fish.

Another Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat&#x27;s source of income is the hotel industry and the real estate sector, which is dynamic in the region. In 2012 Cap Ferrat was named as the second most expensive residential location in the world after Monaco.

==Transportation==

Train. The Nice-Ventimiglia train along the coast stops at Villefranche-sur-Mer and Beaulieu-sur-Mer. There are buses to the Cap-Ferrat from Nice&#x27;s central bus station.

<text>Jetsun Milarepa (, 1028/40–1111/23) was a Tibetan siddha, who was famously known as a murderer when he was a young man, before turning to Buddhism and becoming a highly accomplished Buddhist disciple. He is generally considered one of Tibet&#x27;s most famous yogis and spiritual poets, whose teachings are known among several schools of Tibetan Buddhism. He was a student of Marpa Lotsawa, and a major figure in the history of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. He is also famous for the feat of climbing Mount Kailash.

==Biography — &quot;The Life of Milarepa&quot;==


Milarepa&#x27;s life-story is famous in Tibetan culture, and retold many times. The best-known biography, &quot;The Life of Milarepa&quot;, written by Tsangnyön Heruka (1452–1507) in the fifteenth century and drawing from older biographies, is still very popular. Most of the present-day stories on Milarepa come from this single source, with oral lineage predominating as well as relics including his bearskin coat. While &quot;very little [is known] about him as a historical person at all,&quot; Milarepa is venerated by all Tibetan schools &quot;as an exemplar of religious dedication and mastery.&quot; His life story established the lineage of the Kagyu sect and its key figures.

==Early life==
According to &quot;The Life of Milarepa&quot;, Milarepa was born in western Tibet to a prosperous family. When his father died, his family was deprived of their wealth by his aunt and uncle. At his mother&#x27;s request, Milarepa left home and studied sorcery to take revenge, killing many people. 

==Training and realisation==
Later he felt sorrow about his deeds, and became a student of Marpa the Translator. Before Marpa would teach Milarepa, he had him undergo abuse and trials, such as letting him build and then demolish three towers in turn. Milarepa was asked to build one final multi-story tower by Marpa at Lhodrag, which still stands. Eventually, Marpa accepted him, explaining that the trials were a means to purify Milarepa&#x27;s negative karma. Marpa transmitted Tantric initiations and instructions to Milarepa, including &quot;tummo&quot; (&quot;yogic heat&quot;), the &quot;aural transmissions&quot; (), and &quot;mahamudra&quot;. Marpa told Milarepa to practice solitary meditation in caves and mountain retreats. 

According to the biography, after many years of practice, Milarepa came to &quot;a deep experiential realization about the true nature of reality.&quot; In some other sources, it is said that Milarepa and Marpa both came to India to seek one most important thing for ultimate realisation from Marpa&#x27;s guru, but even he didn&#x27;t know about it. Later on he tried for many years and finally attained enlightenment. Thereafter he lived as a fully realized yogi, and eventually forgave his aunt, who caused his family&#x27;s misfortune.

According to Lopez, &quot;The Life of Milarepa&quot; represents &quot;Buddhism as it was understood and practiced in Tibet in the fifteenth century, projected back in time.&quot; It contains &quot;many of the key terms and doctrines of Buddhism.&quot; Tsangnyön Heruka did his best to establish a lineage of teachers that connects the Kagyu tradition with the Indian &quot;siddha&quot; tradition, portraying Marpa as a student of Naropa, though Naropa had already died when Marpa went to India.

==Tibetan Buddha==
Lopez notes that Tsangnyön Heruka used stylistic elements from the biography of Gautama Buddha to portray Milarepa effectively as a Tibetan Buddha, &quot;born and enlightened in Tibet, without going to India or receiving the direct instructions of an Indian master.&quot; The life story of Milarepa portrays &quot;the rapid method of the Tantric path,&quot; in which liberation is gained in one lifetime. It describes how Milarepa practiced the generation stage and completion stage, to achieve &quot;mahamudra&quot;, &quot;spontaneous realization of the most profound nature of mind.&quot; Yet, in his instructions to his Tibetan audiences, Milarepa refers to the basic Buddhist teachings of &quot;impermanence, the sufferings of &quot;saṃsāra&quot;, the certainty of death and the uncertainty of its arrival, the frightful rebirth that is the direct result of our benighted deeds.&quot; But, his own life also is an example that even a murderer can transform into a Buddha. Lopez further notes that &quot;The Life of Milarepa&quot; portrays two parallel worlds, a profane world and a sacred world, which are ultimately one, showing that the world itself is sacred.

==Students==
Gampopa was Milarepa’s most renowned student. Four of Gampopa’s students founded the four major branches of the Kagyu lineage: Barom Kagyu, Karma Kagyu, Phagdru Kagyu, and Tshalpa Kagyu. Another of Milarepa’s students, the yogi Rechungpa, brought several important transmissions into the Karma Kagyu lineage. Along with Gampopa, Rechungpa was a teacher of the 1st Karmapa Dusum Khyenpa (1110-1193). Upon meeting Dusum Khyenpa, Gampopa told his students, “He is pretending to be a disciple of mine in order to hold my lineage for future sentient beings, but in actuality, he has already accomplished the goal of the path.”

==&quot;The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa&quot;==
The acclaimed spiritual poetry of Milarepa is known of as &quot;The Hundred Thousand Songs.&quot;
Previous biographies of Milarepa were enlarged with religious poetry and song cycles, which doubled the volume of biographical information. Collected for publication in English translation by the Oriental Studies Foundation in 1962, in 1999 these songs were re-published in a separate volume entitled &quot;The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa&quot; translated and annotated by Garma C.C. Chang, then in 2017 a new translation by Christopher Stagg of the Nitartha Translation Network, both published by Shambhala. These summarize the various song cycles in chapter eleven of &quot;The Life of Milarepa&quot;.

==Historical context==
Milarepa lived during the so-called second dissemination of Buddhism in Tibet (10th–12th century), when Buddhism was re-introduced. Three pivotal figures in this Tibetan Renaissance were Rinchen Zangpo (958–1055), who translated sutras, tantras and commentaries; Atiśa (982–1054), whose student Dromtön founded the Kadam school of Tibetan Buddhism; and Marpa the Translator, the teacher of Milarepa, and himself regarded as student of Naropa. Marpa introduced tantric texts and oral instructions from the Bengali siddha tradition into Tibet, and Marpa&#x27;s purported connection with Naropa established the lineage of the Kagyu school, thereby reaching back to the Buddha himself.

<text>Doswell is an unincorporated community in Hanover County in the Central Region of the U.S. state of Virginia. Originally called Hanover Junction, it was located on the Virginia Central Railroad (later, part of the C&amp;O) at a crossing of the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad, a north–south route. Both railroads are now owned by CSX Transportation, although the former Virginia Central line is leased to a short-line carrier, Buckingham Branch Railroad. The area near the Doswell train station is a popular train-watching site for railfans.

The name was changed to Doswell in the early 1890s in honor of Major Thomas Doswell (1823—90). The first Doswell in the area was James Doswell, a captain in the American Revolution. 

Formerly consisting primarily of farmland, Doswell currently has many residents who commute to jobs in Richmond.

==Attractions==

Kings Dominion, a major amusement park owned by Six Flags, and Meadow Event Park, home of the Virginia State Fair, are located in the vicinity of Doswell. There are also several historic sites in the area, such as Church Quarter and Sharp&#x27;s Oakland which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="1009239" wikidata="Q257876" url="?curid=1009239" title="Mostly Autumn">
<text>Mostly Autumn are an English rock band. The group formed in 1995 and have built their reputation through constant touring, never signing to a major label. They produce music heavily influenced by 1970s progressive rock. According to the BBC, Mostly Autumn &quot;fuse the music of Genesis and Pink Floyd with Celtic themes, hard rock and strong, emotional melodies&quot;. They have also been compared with other progressive bands from the same era such as Renaissance, Jethro Tull and Camel, blended with traditional folk music. Later albums also include more contemporary influences.

==History==
Mostly Autumn was formed in the mid-1990s. The original line-up included several members of One Stoned Snowman, a Pink Floyd/1970s tribute band. The band&#x27;s founding line-up consisted of band leader Bryan Josh (vocals and guitars), Heidi Widdop (vocals), Iain Jennings (keyboards), Liam Davison (guitars), Alun Hughes (bass and occasional keyboards), Bob Faulds (violin), Kev Gibbons (whistles), and Chris Walton (drums). Mostly Autumn&#x27;s first live shows were supported by One Stoned Snowman or vice versa; One Stoned Snowman&#x27;s final concert was a farewell show in December 1995 and was indeed supported by Mostly Autumn. Mostly Autumn&#x27;s original rhythm section of Alun Hughes and Chris Walton left the band during 1996 to concentrate on other musical projects and family commitments respectively. They were replaced by bassist Stuart Carver and drummer Allan Scott. Shortly after, Widdop was replaced on vocals by Heather Findlay.

This line-up recorded &quot;For All We Shared...&quot; in 1998. More line-up changes ensued. By 1999, when the band recorded its second album, &quot;The Spirit of Autumn Past&quot;, Gibbons and Scott had been replaced by Angela Goldthorpe and Rob McNeil respectively.

In 2000 (as a three piece – Josh, Findlay, and Goldthorpe) they achieved a support slot for Blackmore&#x27;s Night on their &quot;Under a Violet Moon&quot; tour, bringing them to a wider audience. On the cover artwork for the following Blackmore&#x27;s Night album &quot;Fires at Midnight&quot; (2001), Heather Findlay provided the illustration for the song &quot;Hanging Tree&quot;.

On Mostly Autumn&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Last Bright Light&quot; (2001), Rob McNeil, in turn, was replaced by Jonathan Blackmore. Andy Smith replaced Stuart Carver on the bass guitar. Shortly before the band&#x27;s &#x27;V Shows&#x27; tour in 2004, Iain&#x27;s brother Andrew Jennings took over on drums and percussion. By this time, the band had been praised by Rick Wright of Pink Floyd. Olivia Sparnenn joined the band in 2005 to provide backing vocals. Ben Matthews of Thunder stood in on keyboards for Mostly Autumn&#x27;s headline gig at the Baja Prog Festival in Mexico in March 2006. Chris Johnson was then recruited as a permanent replacement, with Angela (now under her married name Gordon) also taking a more prominent role on keyboards.

At the beginning of 2007, both guitarist Liam Davison and drummer Andrew Jennings left the band; Davison to concentrate on his solo album and Jennings to devote his time to his other projects. The guitar parts were shared out amongst the rest of the group. Ex-Karnataka drummer Gavin Griffiths stood in on drums for most of the 2007 live shows; Andrew Jennings temporarily rejoined the group at the end of 2007, until Henry Bourne took over in 2008. Gavin Griffiths returned for the first shows of 2009 in Manchester and London. After Chris Johnson and Angela Gordon left in 2007, Iain Jennings and Liam Davison returned to the group on keyboards and guitar respectively. Anne-Marie Helder (who had played support slots in the past and stood in for Angela during her pregnancy) took over the role of flute, keyboards and backing vocals. A new studio album entitled &quot;Glass Shadows&quot; was released in early 2008 and an accompanying tour took place in spring and early summer. A 100-minute DVD, &#x27;The Making of Glass Shadows&#x27;, accompanied the special pre-order version of the album.

During October 2008, Mostly Autumn performed two gigs with an alternative, semi-acoustic line-up in support of the Bad Shepherds. The line-up consisted of Bryan Josh (guitar and vocals), Olivia Sparnenn (lead vocals), Andy Smith (bass), Anne-Marie Helder (keyboards and flute) and Robbie Baxter (drums). This tour was truncated after the Bad Shepherds cancelled many dates.

Mostly Autumn have their own independent record label and choose to finance each album release itself. The group typically prints a limited edition of each album and sells those to cover their recording costs. A retail version of the album is then made available via retail outlets, distributors, the group&#x27;s concerts and through their website.

Up to and including &quot;Heart Full of Sky&quot; (2006), Mostly Autumn&#x27;s albums have started with the last few seconds of the previous album&#x27;s final song. This tradition was dropped with the release of &quot;Glass Shadows&quot; (2008).

At the beginning of 2010, Heather Findlay announced her intention to leave the band to focus on solo work and on her family. She performed her last gig with the band at Leamington Spa Assembly on 2 April 2010. This was filmed, and released as a 2-disc DVD under the name &quot;That Night in Leamington&quot;, which also included a 30-minute interview with Josh and Findlay. After her departure, Olivia Sparnenn stepped into the lead role, and the band&#x27;s next album &quot;Go Well Diamond Heart&quot; was released in 2010.

Bryan Josh and Olivia Sparnenn were married on 21 June 2013.

From mid-2013 onwards, Helder and Griffiths were absent from the band&#x27;s touring line-up due to other commitments; their positions being temporarily filled by keyboardist Hannah Hird and drummer Alex Cromarty. In March 2014, it was revealed by Bryan Josh on the band&#x27;s official website that Griffiths had decided to leave the band and that Cromarty was now his official replacement. With this line-up the band then recorded their eleventh album, &quot;Dressed in Voices&quot;. In May 2014, shortly prior to the release of &quot;Dressed in Voices&quot;, Josh announced that founding member Liam Davison had left the band and had been replaced by returning member Chris Johnson, and this new line-up recorded the live album &quot;Box of Tears&quot;.

In the autumn of 2014, Josh and Sparnenn – as &quot;Mostly Autumn Acoustic&quot; – supported Steve Hackett on the UK leg of his &quot;Genesis Extended&quot; tour.

In mid-2015, former Mostly Autumn flautist and keyboardist Angela Gordon replaced Hannah Hird in the band&#x27;s touring line-up; whilst no official statement was made at the time, the band have now acknowledged that Gordon had officially replaced Helder in the band&#x27;s line-up, and with this new line-up the band recorded its next album, &quot;Sight of Day&quot;.

On 5 November 2017, the band announced that founding guitarist Liam Davison had died.

==Side-projects==
Founding members Bryan Josh, Liam Davison, Heidi Widdop, Alun Hughes, Bob Faulds and Chris Walton played in the Pink Floyd/1970s tribute band One Stoned Snowman. They disbanded at the end of 1995, largely due to the popularity of Mostly Autumn.

Liam Davison and Alun Hughes played with the hard rock band Life Support from their founding in 1994 until leaving at the same time during 1996. Life Support split up in 1999.

Heather Findlay contributed to Arjen Lucassen&#x27;s &#x27;Ayreon&#x27; project on &quot;The Human Equation&quot; album in 2004, singing the part of &quot;Love&quot;.

Iain Jennings left the band at the beginning of 2006 to pursue his own musical ambitions and formed his own band, Breathing Space, as well as contributing to projects by other artists and even becoming a Music Technology teacher at Huntington School, York, a local Comprehensive. He recruited then-Mostly Autumn backing vocalist Olivia Sparnenn to sing lead vocals and the pair, along with various other musicians recorded three albums. Despite his return to the Mostly Autumn fold in 2008, Iain remained a member and core songwriter in Breathing Space. In April 2010, Sparnenn took over lead vocals in Mostly Autumn so decided to stop working with Breathing Space. Breathing Space continued for a short while with original Mostly Autumn vocalist Heidi Widdop, before splitting up.

During 2005 Heather Findlay and Angela Gordon formed an acoustic side project called Odin Dragonfly (an anagram of their surnames), making live appearances both as a support act and as headliners. In August 2007 they released their first album, &quot;Offerings&quot;, which was followed by &quot;Sirens&quot; in 2022.

Both Anne-Marie Helder and Gavin Griffiths are members of Panic Room, and were previously members of Karnataka.

Following a one off project in 2019 involving Iain Jennings and York rock band Godson (which includes founding Mostly Autumn bassist Alun Hughes), Iain became a full member of Godson in August 2020. They subsequently changed their name to The Tower Radio and are working on their eponymous first album. This has been delayed by COVID-19 restrictions and is now planned for release in 2022.

<text>Jyoti Basu (born Jyotirindra Basu; 8 July 1914 – 17 January 2010) was an Indian Marxist theorist, communist activist, and politician. He was one of the most prominent leaders of Communist movement in India. He served as the 6th and longest serving Chief Minister of West Bengal from 1977 to 2000. He was one of the founding members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). He was the member of Politburo of the party since its formation in 1964 till 2008. He was also the member of West Bengal Legislative Assembly 11 times. In his political career, spanning over seven decades, he was noted to have been the India&#x27;s longest serving chief minister in an elected democracy, at the time of his resignation. He declined the post of Prime Minister after the 1996 Indian general election after the CPM refused to let him head a multi-party coalition as would not be able to implement Marxist programs and relinquished the prime ministership to Deve Gowda.

==Early life and education==
Jyotirindra Basu was born on 8 July 1914 to an upper middle class Bengali Kulin Kayastha family at 43/1 Harrison Road, Calcutta, British India. His father, Nishikanta Basu was a doctor whose hometown was the village of Barudi in Dhaka District of the Bengal Presidency while his mother Hemlata Basu was a housewife. He grew up in an Indian style joint family and was the youngest of three siblings. He had an affectionate nickname called Gana. One of his elder uncles, Nilinkanta Basu was a judge in the High Court. His family also retained ancestral lands in Barudi where Jyoti Basu is described to have spent part of his childhood. The Barudi home of Basu was later turned into a library after his death, reportedly on his wishes.

Basu&#x27;s schooling began in 1920 at Loreto School Kindergarten in Dharmatala, Calcutta. His father shortened his name from Jyotirindra to Jyoti during the time of admission. However, three years later he was shifted to the St. Xaviers School, Calcutta. He completed his intermediate education from St. Xaviers in 1932. Subsequently, he took an undergraduate course in English from the Hindu College, Calcutta (later renamed to Presidency College). Following his graduation in 1935, he acquired admission in the University College, London (UCL) to study Law and became a barrister at Middle Temple on 26 January 1940. He had already left for India by the time he acquired his barristerial qualification which he received in absentia.

During his stay in London, he became involved in political discourse and activism for the first time. Besides his general curriculum at UCL, he would attend various lectures on political organisation, constitutional law, international law and anthropology at the London School of Economics (LSE). Due to which, he is also credited as an alumnus of LSE. He had reportedly attended the lectures of the political theorist and economist, Harold Laski and was influenced by his anti-fascism. By 1937, Basu was an active member of several anti-imperialist Indian students unions such as the India League and the Federation of Indian Students, and had become acquainted with young Indian communists such as Bhupesh Gupta and Snehangshu Acharya.

In 1938, he had also become a founding member of the London Majlis and subsequently its first secretary. Apart from raising public opinion for the cause of Indian independence, one of the primary functions of the Majlis was to arrange receptions for Indian leaders who were visiting England at the time. Through the Majlis, Basu came into contact with various Indian independence movement leaders such as Subhas Chandra Bose, Jawaharlal Nehru, Krishna Menon and Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit.

==Before 1947 and independence movement==
On returning to Calcutta, India in early 1940, Basu enrolled as a barrister at the Calcutta High Court, and married Basanti Ghosh. However, in the same year, he also inducted himself as an activist affiliated with the Communist Party of India (CPI). His entry into the communist movement at the time had reportedly been in opposition to the wishes of his relatively well off family. Following the Meerut conspiracy in 1929, the Communist Party had also been made illegal by British authorities, as a result Basu was initially involved in providing liaison and safe houses for underground Communist leaders in the Independence movement. However soon afterwards, he also became involved in organising railway workers, planning strikes and is described to have preferred direct action over ballot box in the initial years.

In 1941, Basu was appointed the party secretary of the Bengal Assam Railway (now Bangladesh Railway and Northeast Frontier Railway) and tasked with organising a workers union. By May 1943, he had become the representative of the Calcutta Port Engineering Workers&#x27; Union in the All India Trade Union Congress, while the Bengal Assam Railway Workers Union under him increased its membership to over 4,000 with union members present in Dacca, Calcutta, Kanchrapara, Mymensingh, Rangpur and Assam.

In the following Bengal famine of 1943, the members of the Communist Party including Basu were involved in famine relief work. The party also organised &quot;People&#x27;s Food Committees&quot; which would attempt to force hoarders into releasing their stocks for distribution; Basu participated in the organisation of such committees in Calcutta and Midnapore. According to Basu&#x27;s testimony, they only had a small organisation at the time and did the best they could while the famine took the lives of over 3 million people. Basu was elected to the Bengal provincial committee of the Communist Party in the same year. He would later participate in the Tebhaga movement between 1945 and 1947 that sought to end the food crisis in Bengal, in a supportive capacity as a railway unionist.

By 1944, Basu had started leading the trade union activities of the Communist Party. He was again delegated to organise labourers working for the East Indian Railway Company (now Eastern Railway and East Central Railway) in order to further the interests of the Indian workers and is described to have been instrumental in the formation of the Bengal Nagpur Railway (now South Eastern Railway, East Coast Railway and South East Central Railway) Workers&#x27; Union of which he became the general secretary. With the merger of the Bengal Nagpur Railway Workers&#x27; Union and the Bengal Delhi Railroad Workers&#x27; Union in the same year, Basu was elected the general secretary of the new combined union. He would also be elected as the secretary of the All India Railwaymen&#x27;s Federation.

In 1946, Basu was appointed by the Communist Party to contest as the candidate for the Railway Employees&#x27; constituency in the Bengal Legislative Assembly. He subsequently defeated Humayun Kabir of the Indian National Congress and was elected to the assembly. He is noted to have given a &quot;soul stirring speech&quot; on the presiding food crisis in the Bengal Assembly; according to him the only means of solving the issue was to completely dismantle the Zamindari system and the Permanent Settlement agreement, and to drive out the British with haste. Basu had also organised a continuous railway strike in support of the 1946 Royal Indian Navy ratings revolt, and later secured the release of various political prisoners on 24 July 1946.

== Communist Party of India (1947–1964) ==

=== Interim government in West Bengal (1947–1952) ===
Following the partition of India, Basu remained as the member of the now divided West Bengal Legislative Assembly. Prafulla Chandra Ghosh of the conservative Indian National Congress became the first Chief Minister of West Bengal. The Congress however faced civil unrest from the onset; hartals, civil disobedience and demonstrations had soon become the order of the day in the face of a Congress government that was seen as unresponsive to the social and economic distress that was widespread in the state at the time.

The new assembly therefore instituted the West Bengal Special Powers Act 1947 modelled on the Defence of India Act 1915; the act gave unchecked power to the bureaucracy and the police to suppress public agitations allowing law enforcement to detain individuals for up to 6 months without trial on reasonable grounds, which was justified on the grounds of maintaining the law and order situation. The bill was inordinately criticised and opposed by Basu who declared that &quot;it seeks to perpetuate (the undemocratic rule)&quot;. In 1948, the government sought to extend the act through the West Bengal Security Ordinance which would remove the restriction of &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; for imprisonment. According to Basu, the new ordinance had made it clear that the Congress intended to establish a police state in West Bengal. By this time, the state of West Bengal had already been declared as a &quot;problem province&quot; by the Congress administration and Bidhan Chandra Roy replaced as the new chief minister.

During the presentation of the ordinance as a bill in the assembly, Basu attempted to oppose it on a clause by clause basis but in vain due to the dominance of the Congress in the assembly, only the two communist legislators Ratanlal Brahmin and Basu along with independent members opposed the bill. Basu argued that while the Congress spoke of &quot;Kisan Raj&quot; (), it had made no progress in abolishing the Zamindari system and had instead developed vested interests with the &quot;Zamindars&quot; () themselves which resulted in the persistence of poor socioeconomic conditions and the employment of repressive tactics against agitations.

In the following period the Communist Party was made illegal by the government on allegations of trying to incite on open rebellion and Basu repeatedly arrested as a result; on 24 March 1948, he was imprisoned for a period of three months and released on the orders of the Calcutta High Court. In December 1948, he married a second time, but soon went into hiding and kept changing residences due to an ongoing crackdown on communist leaders. For a period at the time, he had reportedly lived alongside Indrajit Gupta, who would later become the Home Minister of India. In 1949, Basu had remained as the vice-president of the All India Railwaymen&#x27;s Federation. In the same year, the federation had held a strike ballot which displayed overwhelming support for a railway strike on 9 March in demand of better wages and working conditions in the Indian Railways. The strike notice was however withdraw by the socialist leadership of the federation to whom the government had shown a reconciliatory attitude but the communist members under the leadership of Basu insisted on proceeding with the strike which resulted in disciplinary action being taken against the communists. Subsequently, the government also decided to crack down on the communist leadership by arresting 118 leaders involved in the railway sector in West Bengal including Basu. In the aftermath, the strike was a failure as the administration mobilised troops and police force to prevent any disruption from communist influenced union members.

After the adoption of the Constitution of India in 1950, the ban on the Communist Party was lifted on the orders of the Calcutta High Court. In September 1951, Congress attempted to renew the Security Act with the introduction of the West Bengal Security (Amendment) Bill of 1951 which raised criticism in the assembly on the lines of creating an environment of fear and intimidation on the eve of the first elections to the assembly which were to be held in December. Although the bill was passed once again despite Basu&#x27;s persistent opposition, this time he had garnered the support of a number of Gandhian Congress members including from the former chief minister and architect of the bill, P. C. Ghosh, all of whom had resigned from the party and formed their own Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party by the time of voting. In same year, the Bengali daily organ &quot;Swadhinata&quot; of the Communist Party was resumed and Basu appointed as the president of its editorial board. The legislative assembly elections for 1951 were also held by the Election Commission in March 1952 instead.

=== First Assembly and agitations (1952–1957) ===
In the West Bengal State Assembly election of 1952, Basu was elected as the representative of the Baranagar constituency and the Communist Party emerged as the second-largest party in the assembly. Following which Basu was unanimously elected as the legislative party leader of the CPI in West Bengal. In the following year, he was also elected as the secretary of the state committee of the CPI. The ensuing period in West Bengal was marked with the rise of a number of anti-establishment mass movements, in which Basu is described to have played a key role.

Even after the Independence of India, the Calcutta Tramways Company had remained a British-owned company which operated in partnership with the Government of West Bengal. On 25 June 1953, the company announced a fare hike for second class passengers that was to be implemented from 1 July onwards, which was supported by the West Bengal Government. In response to the move, the &quot;Tram and Bus Fare Enhancement Resistance Committee&quot; was formed in which Basu was inducted as the representative of the Communist Party. The Calcutta Tramway Union announced their support for the committee and published statistical data through the &quot;Swadhinata&quot; which displayed that the company was privy to &quot;swelling profits&quot; concluding the fare hike to be &quot;absolutely uncalled for&quot;. From the day of implementation of the new fares, the city underwent a series of agitations which began with disobedience to pay the new prices and caused severe losses for the company, culminating into police deployment and arrests of hundreds of disobedient passengers.

Basu was arrested on 4 July alongside Ganesh Ghosh and Subodh Banerjee who were also involved in the agitations, he was bailed out the following day. On 7 July, during a large picketing of the company headquarters at Mango Lane in Calcutta, five Resistance Committee leaders including Basu met with A.C.T Blease who was the agent of the company in India and presenting him with the demands of unilateral withdrawal of the fare hike. On the evening of the same day, 500 citizens including Basu were arrested under the Preventive Detention Act which had been earlier implemented through the Security Act. Over the course of the month the movement faced progressively increased police action and subsequently heightened civil unrest spreading all across West Bengal with general strikes, mass demonstrations, tramway boycotts to hunger strikes from imprisoned agitators and even violent confrontations between the police and agitators on the streets. In the end, the five committee leaders including Basu were released on 26 July, the fare hike scrapped by the Chief Minister Bidhan Chandra Roy on 31 July and the remaining imprisoned agitators released by 2 August.

In January 1954, the Communist party held its third congress in Madurai and Basu was elected as the new Central Committee member during the congress. In February, Basu became involved in the 1954 teachers&#x27; agitation in West Bengal. The All Bengal Teachers Association (ABTA) had been called for implementing the recommendations of the Secondary Board for raising the allowances of secondary school teachers. The association was joined in by various labour unions and opposition parties in support of their demand. The government as a result decided to crack down on the leaders of the agitation but Basu escaped custody and took refuge in the West Bengal Legislature. The police force who were trying to arrest him through the Preventive Detention Act were reluctant to enter the assembly to arrest a legislator. In Basu&#x27;s testimony, he states that it was easier for him support the agitation from inside the assembly by projecting the police action on the movement without getting arrested.

During the presentation of the recommendation of the States Reorganisation Commission in 1956, a proposal for the merger of Bihar and West Bengal into a single state called Purva Pradesh was floated which was supported by the Indian National Congress. The Communist Party having maintained the stance of supporting linguistic reorganisation of states in India since 1920, was vehemently opposed to the proposal of the merger. The announcement of the proposal caused widespread protests in West Bengal led by students, workers and even peasantry, the Central Committee of the Communist Party held a meeting between 28 January to 4 February protesting the move. Basu and Yogendra Sharma, the secretaries of the state committees of the Communist Party in West Bengal and Bihar respectively issued a joint press statement calling the merger proposal to be &quot;antidemocratic and reactionary&quot;.

Basu is noted to have opposed the proposal from both within and outside the assembly, he presided over the mass meeting at Wellington Square in opposition to the proposal and severely criticised the governor&#x27;s position in support of the proposal. According to his testimony, the proposal was akin to a conspiracy to annihilate the basic identity of Bengal. Basu presented the idea of the proposal as a poll issue for the by-elections of the year, supporting the candidacy of Mohit Mitra who the Central Committee&#x27;s secretary for linguistic reorganisation and declared that the results should reflect the people&#x27;s mandate. In the subsequent by-elections, Mohit Mitra won from the Calcutta North East constituency and Lal Behari Das won from the Khejuri constituency, defeating their Congress counterparts by a margin of over 20,000 in both constituencies which caused the Chief Minister Bidhan Chandra Roy to scrap the merger proposal.

=== Beginning of the food movements (1957–1962) ===
In the West Bengal Legislative Assembly election of 1957, Basu was re-elected as the representative of the Baranagar constituency and the Communist Party returned as the second largest party with an increased representation. As a result, Basu formally became the Leader of Opposition in the assembly. This platform enabled the Communist Party under the leadership of Basu in West Bengal to exacerbate agitations against the prevalent food crisis in West Bengal by acting as the principal opposition on the floor of the assembly, increasing public awareness and providing a united front for agitators to rally around.

Since the beginning of the British Raj, the region of Bengal had suffered from severe food shortages culminating into large-scale famines at times. Following independence of India, the Public Distribution System (PDS) was established and two land reforms were enacted in 1953 and 1955 in West Bengal. However, the implementation of these initiatives and reforms was rife with problems and the agricultural sector had remained in despondency while food shortages continued to afflict a largely impoverished population. The food crisis and general poverty had led to multiple outbursts of public agitations throughout the 1950s which peaked near the end of 1959. The leaders of the Communist Party adopted the twin strategy of organising anti-government mass movements by forming issue based committees to draw public support from beyond party lines and pressurise the government into providing relief measures while also badgering on about food scarcity on the floor of the legislative assembly to draw and retain public and media attention on the issue, Basu played a significant role in the latter with frequent moves for adjournment motions and participation in heated debates.

By the end of 1958, the Communist Party initiated the formation of the Price Increase and Famine Resistance Committee (PIFRC) in collaboration with the other primarily leftist members of the opposition. Basu became one of the formative leaders of the committee. Food insecurity in West Bengal had reached a critical stage at the time and its persistence was largely blamed on the Food Ministry and the Indian National Congress wherein the Communist Party had continuously asserted that the Congress party had been reduced to the representative party of hoarders, landlords and jotedars and that there would be no solution without direct action and sustained public pressure. Initially the committee principally engaged itself in laying down demands for price control, redistribution of state lands and organising agitations with that in retrospect.

On 10 February 1959, Basu and other leaders of the PIFRC met with the Chief Minister, Bidhan Chandra Roy who gave them verbal assurances that ration shops will be restocked offering amenable prices but the assurances weren&#x27;t followed through. On 26 April, Union Food Minister, Ajit Prasad Jain declared that the food situation in West Bengal was &quot;easy, smooth and comfortable&quot;. This caused widespread public outrage and led to the intensification of the Food movement of 1959 between May–June as the situation was further aggravated by hoarders attempting to save up stocks in illegal go-downs and warehouses. The persistent refusal of the Government of West Bengal to consider the demands presented also provoked the PIFRC into augmenting the demands to include enactment of ceilings on private land holdings and confiscation without compensation of excessive lands owned by &quot;Zamindars&quot; (trans: Landlords); these were presented in parallel with general strikes and organised direct action endorsed and supported by the committee to locate and force the sale of hidden stocks of rice.

On 25 June, the PIFRC and over 100 trade unions called a statewide &quot;hartal&quot; (general strike) to protest against the &quot;anti–food&quot; policies of the government. The agitators held an open mass meeting near the Chief Minister&#x27;s residence where Basu was present among the speakers alongside Siddhartha Shankar Ray, Tridib Chaudhuri and Bankim Mukherjee, who demanded that the government should meet the conditions presented by the PIFRC or resign, otherwise they would organise a mass civil disobedience movement. On 9 July, the &quot;Swadhinata&quot; gave a clarion call through an editorial which stated that &quot;People of West Bengal know quite well that the Congress Government and its food policy are responsible for their destitute condition. They also know that only by hitting hard, time and again, they could be forced to do at least something...&quot; Earlier on 6 July, the PIFRC had issued a press release stating intent to begin the civil disobedience movement by taking preparations to organise volunteers; Basu was among the list of signatories that included Niranjan Sengupta and Nihar Mukherjee. The committee further set the date of 20 August for the beginning of the civil disobedience movement.

In August, the police arrested 35 prominent leaders of the committee including 7 members of legislative assembly through the usage of the Preventive Detention Act and the West Bengal Security Act. The movement however continued with civil disobedience, continuous general strikes and mass demonstrations while Basu was also able to evade arrest. On 31 August 1959, a massive demonstration cum general strike was held in the city of Calcutta which brought the city and its surrounding districts to a standstill and ended with lathi charges and instances of police violence on protesters. This caused an outburst of students protests against police atrocities and led to instances of police firing on student protesters. Over the course of the following days between 2–5 September, civil unrest with large scale participation from students of schools, colleges and universities erupted across the city accompanied by violent encounters with the police, vandalism and mass shootings by the police; in the end around 46–80 civilians were killed. The opposition leaders including Basu accused the government of having turned &quot;authoritarian and ruthless&quot; and reasoned that there was no space for the continuation of a democratic mass movement. In light of the violence, the PIFRC formally withdrew the agitation by 26 September and the committee was disbanded.

In the aftermath and over the course of the following years, Basu condemned the &quot;police barbarism&quot; against the agitators, engaging in fiery criticisms against the government and even brought a motion of no confidence, although it was defeated due to a lack of requisite members. The series of events had also heightened public resentment against the Congress government across West Bengal, especially in Calcutta and would set the foundation for latter political activism in the following decade. The food movement would also go on in the form of a number of localised spontaneous agitations over the following years till the next large scale flare up in 1966.

== Communist Party of India (Marxist) (1964 afterwards) ==
=== Split from the Communist Party of India (1962–1966) ===
In the West Bengal Legislative Assembly election of 1962, Basu was once again re-elected as the representative of the Baranagar constituency and the Communist Party increased its vote share from 17.81% to 24.96%. In the following period the Communist Party underwent a vertical split with a section of the party including Basu going on to form the Communist Party of India (Marxist). There were several ongoing ideological conflicts between sections within the Communist Party about the nature of the Indian State and the characterisation and method of interaction with the Indian National Congress, about the approach towards the ongoing debate between the Soviet Union and China and with regards to the handling of the border disputes between India and China. These debates were further exacerbated by the food movement in West Bengal and brought to the forefront by the rising border tensions between India and China. The Communist Party had also become the second largest party in the Lok Sabha following the 1962 Indian general election with nearly 10% vote share which is described to have brought prominence to the internal divisions of the party.

The party was broadly divided into two sections namely the National Front (referred to as the &quot;rightist section&quot;) and the Democratic Front (referred to as the &quot;leftist section&quot;). Basu belonging to the latter advocated for radical change to supplant the domination of big landlords, capitalists and monopolists in the Indian polity and opposed any conditional support for Nehruvian policies while denouncing the &quot;revisionist position&quot; taken by the former to support Jawaharlal Nehru on certain issues. The militant food movement in West Bengal also emboldened the leftist anti-Congress section to overwhelm the rightist section which sought tactical cooperation with the Indian National Congress. On the other hand, with the flare-up of the Sino-Indian War, the leftist section of the Communist Party was portrayed as &quot;pro–china&quot; by their opponents from both within and outside the party. Before the outbreak of the war, the section had taken the stance that dialogue and diplomatic partnership with the Chinese would resolve the disputes, however Basu himself was more sceptical and advocated for the adoption of a twin strategy of maintaining the border outposts inside Tibet and then engaging in talks using the outposts as a form of leverage ahead of any commencement on a new treaty.

The leftist section continued to oppose the Chinese stand on the India-China frontier but was also opposed to providing unconditional support to the Nehru government because of its &quot;class character&quot; contrary to the rightist section which had declared outright support for the central government. This stance of the leftist section came as dissatisfactory to the Nehru government which had imposed a state of national emergency and introduced the Defence of India Ordinance, 1962, and henceforth utilised them to imprison various opposition leaders and activists as well as Chinese Indian citizens. Basu was imprisoned among other major communist leaders such as the former chief minister of Kerala, E. M. S. Namboodiripad, the organisational specialist Promode Dasgupta, the founding leader of Communist Party of India (Marxist), Hare Krishna Konar, the Indian revolutionary freedom fighter, Benoy Choudhury, the Telangana revolutionaries, Puchalapalli Sundarayya and Makineni Basavapunnaiah as well as some members of the rightist section such as the trade unionist A. B. Bardhan. Basu reportedly received the news of his father&#x27;s death during this time in prison. Although, the war ended in November 1962, the detainees were only released in December 1963 after an order from the Supreme Court of India.

On 11 April 1964, in a landmark incident, 32 members from the &quot;Leftist faction&quot; in the CPI national council including Basu walked out of a meeting in Delhi with the stated intent of forming the &quot;real communist party&quot;. The section organised their conference in Tenali, Andhra Pradesh which concluded with a resolution to form a new party and in the seventh congress held between 31 October to 7 November in Calcutta, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was formally founded. Basu was elected to the first politburo of the new party being one of the nine founding members commonly referred to as the &quot;Navaratnas&quot; (trans: nine gems). On 27 June 1965, Basu also became the founding editor of the English language organ of the new party called &quot;People&#x27;s Democracy&quot;.

=== Coalition Governments in West Bengal (1966–1972) ===
Between February–March 1966, a second and more spontaneous food movement flared up across West Bengal. As a result of price rise of essential commodities, the new chief minister, Prafulla Chandra Sen had suggested that people should shift from their staple of rice–potatoes to wheat–green bananas and subsequently agitations had broken out in the area of Swarupnagar, leading to police firing and death of two participating teenagers on 16 February. Consequently, widespread spontaneous protests broke out over the following months and across the state of West Bengal with more frequent instances of vandalism and violent encounters between the agitators and police than in the previous agitations. This movement while having less organised backing from the opposition parties is described to have been impactful in its political ramifications in the subsequent years; among others, leading to the Indian National Congress losing its absolute majority for the first time and Basu becoming the deputy chief minister of West Bengal in the following year. Civil unrest also peaked during the ensuing period which led to a succession of unstable governments, the establishment of armed political cadres, Naxalbari uprising and widespread spontaneous agitations against prevailing conditions of extreme poverty.

In the West Bengal Legislative Assembly election of 1967, fourteen opposition parties contested through two pre-poll political alliances; the CPI-M led United Left Front and the CPI and Bangla Congress (splinter of the Congress party formed in 1966) led People&#x27;s United Left Front. The CPI-M became the second largest party outstripping its former party, the CPI. Following the election, the two alliances joined forces to form the United Front government in West Bengal. During the negotiations between the two alliances, Basu was denied the position of chief minister due to opposition to the idea from the CPI and Bangla Congress, all of whom eventually settled for Ajoy Mukherjee of the Bangla Congress as the consensus candidate for the position while Basu became the deputy chief minister and in-charge of the finance department. The government however collapsed within a year when the food minister, P. C. Ghosh resigned from the government after facing persistent agitations led by the CPI-M (both part of the same government) against his policy of seeking voluntary measures from landlords and middlemen which were ineffective in resolving the food crisis.

For the mid-term West Bengal Legislative Assembly election of 1969, the United Front Committee was formed consisting of all the coalition partners of the previous government which agreed upon a pre-poll alliance to contest the election together under a 32-point programme. Under terms of the agreement, if the alliance were to attain a majority then Mukherjee would become the chief minister while Basu would become the deputy chief minister. In addition during the negotiations Basu was able to secure the portfolios of fisheries, food, excise, labour, civil defence and education for the CPI-M as well as the department of general administration and police from the home ministry forsaking the finance ministry which he had previously held. In the election, the United Front won an overwhelming victory with 214 out of 280 seats and as a consequence, the CPI-M stood as the first party other than the Congress party to become the largest party in the assembly.

In the subsequent second United Front cabinet, Basu became both the deputy chief minister and in-charge of general administration and police. Under Basu, the police were instructed to not intervene in any labour disputes against striking workers. The first six months of the second United Front government as a result experienced a record of 551 strikes and 73 union lockdowns across the state with a participation of approximately 570,000 workers. The labour department headed by Krishnapada Ghosh of the CPIM is also noted to have coordinated with the department of general administration to enable the registration of new trade unions and legalisation of &quot;gheraos&quot; (trans: picketing) as a method of protest. The labour militancy combined with the state policy of non intervention drove an exponential rise in daily wages ranging between a 100–200% increase in the unorganised sector and 100–300% increase in the organised sector. Previously in light of the appalling conditions of agrarian poverty and rural discontent, a radical section of the CPI-M had also split due to the party&#x27;s involvement in parliamentary politics and subsequently launched a peasant&#x27;s uprising. Eventually this section known as the Naxalites formed the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) in 1969 under the leadership of Charu Mazumdar calling for the annihilation of the class of &quot;joteodars&quot; (wealthy landlords) and an armed revolution to overthrow the Indian state. Although the previous United Front government had tolerated initial landgrabs by the Naxalites, the police department under Basu launched a campaign of state repression on the movement which continued under succeeding governments. According to Basu, &quot;(The Naxalites), forgetting everything else that the country stood for, followed the China model with disastrous consequences which had no relation to Marxist philosophy.&quot;

In August 1969, Basu was also faced with a protest from the police department itself after the death of a policeman in a clash with the Socialist Unity Centre, one of the member parties of the United Front. The agitation was notably defused by him in person, who permitted a group of dissident police personnel to enter his office in the assembly house during a demonstration and negotiated with them, reprehending them for disorderly behaviour while taking into consideration the grievances raised. The second United Front government however too fell within a short period of time, on this occasion the chief minister Ajoy Mukherjee resigned in March 1970 after facing an aggravated and dysfunctional government where smaller member parties were in confrontation with the CPI-M, the largest among them on various issues. There was also an assassination attempt on Basu on 31 March while he was on a party visit to Patna which resulted in the death of one accompanying party worker; the identity of the assailant has remained unknown til date. The government continued to be operational until the dissolution of the assembly by presidential proclamation on 30 July.

In the following West Bengal Legislative Assembly election of 1971, the parties contested alone but CPI-M remained as the single largest party while increasing its number of seats from 80 to 113. Both the former chief minister Ajoy Mukherjee of the Bangla Congress and the former deputy chief minister Basu of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) contested from the Barangar constituency which ended with Basu winning with a vote share of 57.3% and Ajoy Mukherjee emerging as runners up with a vote share of 42.7%. However, Mukherjee who led the Bangla Congress was able to regain his former position through a post-poll coalition called the Democratic Coalition which notably included Indira Gandhi&#x27;s Congress and was supported by the CPI and Congress (Organisation). The CPI-M stood as the sole opposition party and Basu once again became the leader of opposition. Within 2 weeks of the formation of the new government, Basu issued a no confidence motion which stood at exactly 141 in support of the government out of 141 required. Despite surviving the initial motion, the new government too fell within 3 months when the assembly was dissolved on the recommendation of the chief minister.

=== Boycott of Assembly &amp; Emergency rule (1972–1977) ===
In the West Bengal Legislative Assembly election of 1972, Congress (R) won an overwhelming majority and Siddhartha Shankar Ray who was previously in the Bangla Congress and later appointed as a specialised union cabinet ministry called West Bengal Affairs Minister became the new chief minister of the state. The CPI-M was only able to secure 14 seats and Basu for the first time lost his seat in the Baranagar constituency to his former associate Shiba Pada Bhattacharjee, who had remained in the CPI after the split in the party. Before the election, the Communist Party of India allied with Congress (R) while a section of the Bangla Congress had also merged with the Congress. The opposing alliance was led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) which included the previous members of the United Left Front alongside the Biplobi Bangla Congress, a splinter of the Bangla Congress.

The election was marred widespread instances of violence against opposition parties, electoral discrepancies, irregularities in process and consequent allegations of rigging from both Congress (O) and the CPI-M, the press in Calcutta at the time reported that the rigging had occurred in around 50 constituencies. According to the socialist essayist Madhu Limaye, the &quot;black art of booth rigging&quot; was perfected by the Congress in the 1972 election where whole constituencies had been rigged. It was also noted that several constituencies which were known as left wing strongholds had produced massive victory margins in favour of Congress (R) whereas the CPI-M increased its vote share in constituencies which were Congress strongholds; the explanation provided by the CPI-M was that violence and rigging methods were mostly employed at unfavorable constituencies and that elections had been rigged in 87–172 other constituencies. One of the discrepancies pointed at by the CPI-M was that the constituency of Baranagar which had recorded a very high voter turnout despite being subject to section 144 and violent clashes throughout the day which had resulted in the death of one its workers. Basu refused to accept the results and declared that the new assembly was an &quot;assembly of frauds&quot;. He also published an open editorial to the &quot;world press&quot; regarding terming the incidents of violence to be &quot;semi-fascist terror&quot;. The CPI-M boycotted the assembly for the remaining term of the seventh assembly taking the stance that a &quot;massive rigging&quot; had occurred.

In 1975, the Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi imposed a national emergency on the premise of internal disturbances suspending elections, legitimising rule by decree and curbing civil liberties. The proposition for the declaration of the emergency and the formal draft of the ordinance were both notably corroborated to have been forwarded by Siddhartha Shankar Ray. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) emerged as one of the primary opposition to the emergency rule of Indira Gandhi. The following period witnessed a succession of authoritarian measures and political repression, which was particularly severe in West Bengal. The members of the CPI-M&#x27;s labour union became the first subject to political repression and mass arrests while the rest of the members of the CPI-M went underground.

With the initiation of the Jayaprakash Narayan (JP)&#x27;s movement, the CPI-M began providing support to it and went on to participate in discussions for the creation of a united front under the umbrella of the Janata Party. Several of the leaders of the CPI-M were also influenced by JP with Basu noted to be one of his prominent admirers having worked under him in the All India Railwaymen&#x27;s Federation during the 1940s. The involvement of the Hindutva movement however complicated matters, according to JP the formal inclusion of the Marxists who had undergone a splintering and whose organisation was localised in a particular region would have been detrimental to the movement as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh members would switch sides if they joined. JP and Basu eventually agreed that the CPI-M would not formally join the Janata Party as it would weaken the movement. After the revocation of the emergency, the CPI-M joined an electoral alliance with the Janata Party in the 1977 Indian general election which resulted in an overwhelming victory for the Janata Alliance.

== Chief Minister of West Bengal (1977–2000) ==
For the 1977 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, negotiations between the Janata Party and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) broke down. This led to a three sided contest between the Indian National Congress, the Janata Party and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) led Left Front coalition. The results of the election was a surprising sweep for the Left Front winning 230 seats out of 290 with the CPI-M winning an absolute majority on its own, Basu became the chief minister of West Bengal for the next 23 years until his retirement in 2000. Jyoti Basu was also repeatedly elected as the representative of the Satgachhia constituency from 1977 to 2001.

=== First term (1977–1982) ===
In the first term of the coming to power, the Left Front government under Basu initiated a number of agrarian and institutional reforms which resulted in reduction of poverty rates, an exponential rise in agricultural production and decrease in political polarisation. It also enabled the large scale adoption of technological advancements which had earlier been brought in through the Green Revolution in India in the 1960s. The agricultural growth jumped from an annual average of 0.6% between 1970–1980 to over 7% between 1980–1990 and the state was described as an agricultural success story of the 1980s. During this period, the state of West Bengal moved from being a food importer to a food exporter and became the largest producer of rice outstripping the states of Andhra Pradesh and Punjab which had previously held the status. The Human Development Index was also noted to have improved at a much faster rate than in other states, growing from being the lowest in the country in 1975 to above the national average in 1990.

Between 1977 and 1980, Basu oversaw the identification of nearly 1 million acres of ceiling surplus land and its subsequent redistribution. The number of landless rural households decreased by 35% during this period.

The Basu government began the process of &quot;democratic decentralisation&quot; in West Bengal by amending and implementing the provisions of the Panchayat Act. On 4 June 1978, local body elections were resumed after 14 years and the first direct elections were held to elect 56,000 representatives from 15 zila parishads, 324 panchayat samitis and 3,242 gram panchayats in West Bengal. By 1993, the number of representatives was expanded to over 71,000 representatives while Basu was credited to have been successful in the introduction of grassroots democracy and self governing units in West Bengal which substantially improved bureaucratic transparency, irrigation work, rural infrastructure and political participation and as a result standards of living. The successful implementation of panchayat raj in the state is also noted to have played an integral part in the identification and redistribution of ceiling surplus land, and played a significant part in the rise of agricultural growth through the 1980s.

Among the more prominent measures initiated by the new government was that of Operation Barga. Introduced in 1978, it was a comprehensive and radical measure for land reforms which was further formalised through two legislation in 1979 and 1980. The operation sought to actively identify and record &quot;bargardars&quot; (trans: sharecroppers) by present occupational status without any reliance on ancestral records, producing official documentation for enforcement of the rights of &quot;bargardars&quot; to crop share from landlords and priority rights to lands in cases of both voluntary sale of land and forced sale of ceiling surplus lands. The number of recorded &quot;bargardars&quot; increased from 0.4 to 1.2 million by 1982, and resulted in the coverage of 50%+ output share concessions towards &quot;bargardars&quot; to increase from 10% to over 50% among registered &quot;bargardars&quot; and over 33% for unregistered &quot;bargardars&quot;. The implementation of the operation is noted to have improved the social status and security of tenancy of &quot;bargadars&quot; as well as decreased economic inequality. In addition it accounted for approximately 36% of agricultural growth during the period as a consequence of greater production incentives due to a lack of eviction threat and increased output stake. The operation is also credited to have created a cushion against farmers&#x27; suicides in West Bengal by improving the economic stability of farmers.

The Left Front government also identified 247,000 acres of readily reclaimable lands mostly in the Sundarban area (Ganges Delta) for the resettlement of 136,000 agriculturist refugees from East Pakistan. Under the tenure of Bidhan Chandra Roy, many of the refugees had been relocated to refugee camps in Dandakaranya and the Left Front government had taken up their cause for resettlement in West Bengal. Initially Basu and the Left Front government approved voluntary resettlement in the identified lands by the refugees from the Dandakaranya camps to the extent of actively encouraging them to do so, however the implementation of the resettlement process turned lackluster and was bottle-necked with revised priorities for environmental protection in the Sundarbans. In a significant development between 1978 and 1979, a large group of these impoverished refugees who had returned to Bengal seeking resettlement from Dandakaranya had illegally occupied land on the remote island of Marichjhanpi and refused eviction. In January 1979, following an economic blockade, the government conducted a forcible eviction leading to the death of several refugees in the consequent abuse by police personnel. The incident led to sharp criticism of the government and raised controversy in the media, the opposition as well as from within members of the Left Front coalition. The demand for a formal investigation into the eviction was however denied by the government with Basu convinced that it was greatly exaggerated by the media; in the end the official figure put the deaths at 2 but the lack of an investigation led to various other estimates to circulate on the killing years afterwards.

In 1981, a new amendment was introduced to the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1951 (previously amended in 1953, 1967 and 1970) which sought to plug loopholes in the former legislation; the amendment introduced ceilings on non-agricultural lands such as fisheries and orchards which previously had none and enacted provisions for lands held by trusts to be included in the individual ceiling calculations of its beneficiaries. It also derecognised and redefined lands owned by all religious institutions as &quot;raiyats&quot; (trans: land tenure) with a maximum of 7 standard hectares irrespective of any number of declared branches or centers of any such institution.

=== Second term (1982–1987) ===
The reforms initiated by the Basu government in its first term were continued into its second term, Operation Barga was officially completed in 1986. Basu&#x27;s front won 174 seats in 1982 West Bengal Elections defeating the Congress (Indira) - Congress (Socialist) coalition He was one of the most powerful personality of the Left front after becoming the Chief Minister of West Bengal and was known to be the Chief artist of the Communist politics not only in West Bengal, but also in the whole India. Ahead of the 1982 assembly elections, the Left Front had gained three new members; the Communist Party of India (CPI), the West Bengal Socialist Party (WBSP) and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP). In the wake of the 1980 Gorkhaland movement, a poll boycott campaign took place in the Darjeeling hills with the slogan &quot;No State, No Vote&quot;. Organizations calling for a poll boycott included the Pranta Parishad and the Gorkha National Liberation Front of Subhash Ghisingh. Voter participation in Darjeeling stood at 59.40%, compared to the statewide 76.96%. CPI(M) emerged as the sole party of relevance in the hills to oppose a separate Gorkhaland state. CPI(M) won three out of the four assembly seats in the Nepali-dominated areas, the fourth going to an All India Gorkha League candidate (contesting as an independent). Some of the older, smaller Left Front constituents were uncomfortable with the expansion of the alliance, claiming that CPI(M) was diluting it politically. There were also disagreements on distribution of ministerial portfolios after the expansion of the alliance. Though due to his irresponsibility in rehabilitiating 1971 Bangladeshi refugees and refusal to address the rise of anti-Bengali sentiments in Assam and other Northeaster states like Meghalaya (see Beh Dkhar movement) and Tripura (see Mandai massacre) saw his popularity decrease.

In the second term as the Chief Minister of state he gained popularity for his work for the landless peasants and providing them land and also among intelligentsia. The rise of Mamata Banerjee in the 1980s was under the Second Chief Ministership of him and was known to have a good allies with her. And he continued to make a second Chief ministership like the first one by giving the theory of Communism and working in the Land Reforms Act and also to complete the demand of the Gorkhas, especially in Darjeeling and near by regions. Whilst an accord had been struck between Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Gorkha National Liberation Front leader Subhash Ghisingh ahead of the polls, violence escalated in the Darjeeling hills. In the run-up to the polls, several policemen were killed in the area which made Basu a great chances being a choice of people of Darjeeling.

In 1986, Finance Minister Ashok Mitra resigned from the Cabinet, citing differences with Basu, which was a big blow to his government.

=== Third term (1987–1991) ===
In 1987 West Bengal Election in West Bengal, Basu held the office for the third time as the Chief ministers of West Bengal after the win of CPM and their allies. The election was mainly a clash between the Left Front led by Chief Minister Jyoti Basu and the Indian National Congress(I) led by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to make a win in the state. The governing Left Front denied tickets to 62 sitting legislators. In many cases CPI(M), the dominant force in the Left Front, was seeking to rejuvenate the legislature and fielded 35 student leaders as new candidates. The star campaigner was himself Chief Minister Jyoti Basu who had pledged to visit all constituencies where CPI(M) had fielded candidates. During the campaign Basu claimed that the Delhi government discriminated against West Bengal in allocation of resources. Basu&#x27;s party made the third win by securing a complete majority for third time in Bengal&#x27;s history, and the Left front secured 187 in the election and defeating Indian National Congress and made his mark to Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi.

After being sworn in as the Chief Minister Basu continued his work in the major work for which he was elected was that to change the Land Reform and he is said to be one of the best administrators in the history of West Bengal for the work. And he made a main focus on the Students and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was given the main charge for the enhancement of DYFI, the student wing of the CPI(M). Earlier also he gave a notable number of tickets to student leaders and also worked for the Gurkhas who also voted him for his opposition to the Indian National Congress. In 1989, Basu led Left government in a controversial decision, halting the teaching of English language for Primary schools. The controversial decision received protests from intellectuals. The move was later termed as another &quot;historic blunder&quot;.

In the 1990s when the government of VP Singh cleared the ways of Mandal Commission there was Mandal Commission protests of 1990 in West Bengal and also the silence of Basu triggered him at that time as there was a big problem as the CPI (M) was popular among both the classes of the society and CPI (M) supported the verdict.

=== Fourth term (1991–1996) ===
Even after the controversy of Mandal Commission and its protests in 1990 Basu managed to be sworn as the Chief Minister of West Bengal for the 4th time consecutively, setting a record. The term of the assembly elected in 1987 lasted until February 1992, but the West Bengal government asked the Election Commission of India to arrange the election at an earlier date. On 28 November 1991, Basu superseded Bidhan Chandra Roy&#x27;s 14 - year tenure to become the longest serving Chief Minister of West Bengal, a record which he has held ever since at 23 years, 144 days.

Jyoti Basu&#x27;s fourth term was hit with two major resignations - that of Information and Culture Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya in 1993 over the issue of corruption and that of Land Minister Benoy Choudhury in 1995 over the same issue.

=== Fifth term (1996–2000) ===
In 1996 he was elected as Chief Minister for an unprecedented fifth times consecutively in the 1996 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election. Basu seemed all set to be the consensus leader of the United Front for the post of Prime Minister of India but the CPI(M)&#x27;s highest decision making body refused to endorse Basu&#x27;s prime-ministerial ambitions. This was Basu&#x27;s last tenure as the Chief Minister of West Bengal. Basu resigned in the year 2000 leaving a legacy as the longest serving Chief Minister of any Indian state, until Pawan Kumar Chamling surpassed his record in 2018.

Shortly after coming to power, it came to light that in its previous term, the state government had illegally leased out around 160 &quot;waqf&quot; properties in the state to private real-estate developers and land contractors without following the due process. Basu denied all allegations and questioned the veracity of the report. The next year, the Basu government was hit with the &#x27;Treasury Scam&#x27; in which it was revealed in response to a PIL filed in the Calcutta High Court by Mamata Banerjee that throughout Basu&#x27;s 4th term, the state government run treasuries in the districts had siphoned off a total of Rs 55,000 crore of public money to personal ledger accounts (meant for payment of excise duty) held by CPI(M) partymen and another amount of Rs 2,500 crore sent by the Central government for rural development had been diverted into these accounts in the run-up to the 1998 elections of the state panchayats. However, the government steadfastedly refused any investigation into this, and denied any wrongdoing on its part. On the very same year, it was revealed that Basu had used the Chief Minister&#x27;s discretionary powers to illegally allot real estate in multiple locations of Salt Lake locality of East Kolkata at extremely cheap prices to various people, including his own brother-in-law and three cabinet ministers (Fisheries Minister Kiranmoy Nanda, Co-operatives Minister Bhakti Bhushan Mandal and Minority Affairs Minister Mohammed Amin).

Basu was personally shocked at the victory of state Bharatiya Janata Party (whom he would derisively call &#x27;a party of barbaric and uncivilized people&#x27;) president Tapan Sikdar from Dumdum constituency in the 1998 general elections, defeating 3 time CPI(M) MP Nirmal Kanti Chatterjee. The rise of BJP in the state forced Basu&#x27;s government to address the issue of illegal infiltration of Bangladeshi Muslims into the state.

Basu once proposed to make Bengali compulsory for any government job exams under sate government, but this faced criticisms from Atal Bihari Vajpayee lead National Democratic Alliance at the centre, who called it unconstitutional and a harm to the linguistic minority groups of West Bengal. Railway Minister of that time and West Bengal Trinamool Congress chief, Mamata Banerjee, initially did not support the proposal. Under his period, Bengali was introduced as a court language in the Calcutta High Court

==Proposal for Prime-ministership==
Jyoti Basu was proposed for the post of prime minister four times.

In 1990, following the arrest of Lal Krishna Advani, BJP declined support to the National Front Government led by V. P. Singh. During the political crisis, INC chief Rajiv Gandhi sent proposal to Jyoti Basu to be the Prime Minister of India. But CPI(M) declined it.

After 7 months, INC declined support to the Chandrasekhar Singh Government. Again Rajiv Gandhi sent a proposal to Jyoti Basu, which was declined for second time.

In the Indian general election in 1996, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee emerged as the largest party, with 161 of 543 seats but the government fell 13 days later, due to unavailability of majority at the parliament. The Indian National Congress (INC), with a substantial 140 seats, declined to head the government. 
Consequently, along with Janata Dal as the head, the left parties (i.e. CPI(M), CPI) and other smaller parties like Samajwadi Party, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Asom Gana Parishad, Tamil Maanila Congress, and Telugu Desam Party formed the United Front, which was supported by INC from outside. About the selection of Prime Minister from United Front, Vishwanath Pratap Singh from Janata Dal rejected the proposal of being Prime Minister. He suggested that Basu should be made the Prime Minister of the United Front government. RJD&#x27;s chief Lalu Prasad Yadav also supported the proposal. The CPI also supported the proposal. The proposal was taken to CPI(M) by former CPI(M) General Secretary Harkishan Singh Surjeet. The Polit Bureau of CPI(M) met in a meeting. But having no conclusion due to differences, it forwarded the issue to the Central Committee after a voting. Through a meeting in Central Committee on May 14, CPI(M) declined the offer saying the party was still not in a position to dictate its policies and would not be able to get them implemented by a coalition government. They also stated that it would involve joining hands with &quot;bourgeois&quot; outfits like the Congress. Sitaram Yechury was among the leaders who were against Basu being the Prime Minister. When Surjeet conveyed this to United Front leaders, V. P. Singh again suggested that the CPI(M) should reconsider the decision. From Tamil Nadu House, Surjeet called Prakash Karat to tell leaders to stay back for an emergency meeting. But the Central Committee again turned down that offer. After Basu, the names of late G. K. Moopanar and DMK chief M. Karunanidhi came over but Basu suggested H. D. Deve Gowda for the top post citing his experience as a minister first and Chief Minister of Karnataka and Janata Dal accepted the offer and he was elected as the Prime Minister of India. H.D Deve Gowda personally wrote a letter to Jyoti Basu to be the prime minister which Basu declined again due to party choices.
In 1999, the BJP Government by Atal Bihari Vajpayee fell down. Leaders of third front including Mulayam Singh Yadav and others again suggested Jyoti Basu. This time CPI(M) eventually agreed to the proposal. But INC declined.

Later when asked about the decision of the CPI(M), Jyoti Basu stated that as a &quot;historic blunder&quot;. In the words of Basu, &quot;yes, I still think that it was a historic blunder because such an opportunity does not come. History does not give such an opportunity.&quot; Noted Congress politician Arjun Singh was also upset due to the CPI(M)&#x27;s decision. The CPI said that Jyoti Basu as Prime Minister was &#x27;worth-trying&#x27;.

== Later life ==
=== Post–resignation (2000–2010) ===
Even after stepping down from the government, Jyoti Basu personally campaigned for the CPI(M) candidate Amitava Nandy for the Dumdum seat against the incumbent BJP MP (now Union Minister of Telecom and Fertilisers) Tapan Sikdar during the 2004 general elections and was said to have been personally satisfied on hearing about Sikdar&#x27;s defeat in the election.

The 18th congress of CPI(M), held in Delhi in 2005, re-elected Basu to its Politburo, although he had requested acceptance for his retirement. On 13 September 2006, his request for retirement due to age was turned down by the CPI(M), the general secretary Prakash Karat stated that the party wanted that Basu should continue till at least the 2008 congress. In the 19th congress held in early April 2008, Basu was eventually dis-included from the Politburo, although his membership in the Central Committee was not revoked. He was also granted the designation of Special Invitee to the Politburo, a form of emeritus status within the CPI(M).

==Death==
On 1 January 2010, Basu was admitted to AMRI hospital (Bidhannagar, Kolkata) after he was diagnosed with pneumonia. On 16 January 2010, it was reported that he was suffering from multiple organ failure and that his health condition had become extremely critical. Seventeen days after being taken ill, he died on 17 January 2010 at 11:47 am IST. Biman Bose announced with tears, &quot;Jyoti Babu has left us.&quot;

The death was followed by public mourning on an unprecedented scale. Draped in the national flag, Basu&#x27;s body was escorted through the streets of Calcutta on a gun carriage. However, the time schedule went awry in his last moments as lakhs of people thronged the streets of central Kolkata to pay their last respects. Police and volunteers wore a helpless look as a sea of people poured in from every possible corner of the city. The Army escorted the cortege from the State Assembly to the Maidan through Red Road. At Moharkunja Park, arrangements for the state funeral had been made. The army buglers performed the last post as twenty one Gurkha troops fired a 21 volley rifle salute. A day of Mourning was declared nationwide and President Pratibha Patil along with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed their condolences.

Bring a communist, Basu had pledged to donate his body and eyes for medical research on 4 April 2003 at a function organised by Ganadarpan and Susrut Eye Foundation in Kolkata and not to be burned at a crematorium according to Hindu funerary customs. His eyes are donated to Susrut Eye Foundation. He is survived by his son Chandan, daughter-in-law Rakhi, grand daughters Payel (Mallika Basu), Doyel (Bithika Basu) and Koyel (Juthika Basu), offspring of his first daughter-in-law Dolly (separated with son Chandan in 1998), and grand son Subhojyoti, offspring of daughter-in-law Rakhi. Basu&#x27;s body was kept at &#x27;Peace Haven&#x27; for those who wanted to pay their respects. His body was handed over to SSKM Hospital, Kolkata for research on 19 January 2010 around 16:50 pm IST after a guard of honour at the nearby Moharkunja park (formerly, Citizens&#x27; park). The hospital authority is considering preserving his brain.

=== Reactions and tributes on his death ===
Basu&#x27;s death was reacted with grief across the country and in international. Many famous personalities bade their gratitude and condolences in social media and attended his funeral. Some of their statements are listed below:

**Former Home Minister and Finance Minister of India, P. Chidambaram stated that &quot;He was a colossus who straddled India&#x27;s political scene for many decades.

**Former Deputy Prime Minister of India and founder of Bharatiya Janata Party, L. K. Advani commented &quot;He was a stalwart... a great leader. He held the CPM fort in West Bengal for a long time.

Still, going by his greatness, I respect him and pay my tributes.&quot;
**Former Chief Minister of Delhi, Sheila Dikshit said &quot;Something seems to have snapped, an era. He was a very dignified leader.

**Former External Affairs Minister of India, and Chief Minister of Delhi, Sushma Swaraj: &#x27;He was a leader of stature and experience.

== Personal life ==
Jyoti Basu married twice. His first wife Basanti died within two years of their marriage in 1942. In 1948, he married Basanti&#x27;s sister Kamala Basu, who died on 1 October 2003. Together, they had only one son, Subhabrata (also known as Chandan), who was born in 1952. Unlike his father, Chandan has no association with either politics or communism, and is a businessman. Chandan has been hounded by allegations levied by the both Congress and Trinamool Congress of being a beneficiary of nepotism, which he has denied repeatedly.

In 1988, RSP leader Jatindra Chandra Chakraborty was forced to step down from his position as PWD Minister by CPI(M) following him raising allegations of nepotism against Jyoti Basu in what became known as the &#x27;Bengal Lamp Scam&#x27; (in which he revealed financial irregularities on the part of Chief Minister Basu assigning a consignment of streetlights to a Jadavpur based loss-making firm called &#x27;Bengal Lamp&#x27; where his son Chandan was employed at that time).

Although being an atheist and a staunch communist, Basu never interfered with the religious freedom of his second wife Kamala, who was described by her son Chandan to be a deeply religious woman.

After joining the CPI, Basu was disinherited by his father from their residence at 55A, Hindusthan Park in Gariahat locality of South Kolkata, so he lived in the houses of his friends. After becoming chief minister, Basu lived in a guest house owned by the state government in Bidhannagar.

==Recognition==

An admirer of Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin and Karl Marx, Jyoti Basu is regarded as one of the most successful politicians in India. His reign of 23 years in West Bengal as the Chief Minister was counted as the longest serving chief minister in India until this record was broken by Pawan Kumar Chamling in 2018.

In 2010, Rajarhat New Town was named after Jyoti Basu as &quot;Jyoti Basu Nagar&quot; in the presence of then chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

The Government of Bangladesh created the 201-member &quot;Comrade Jyoti Basu Nagarik Sangsad&quot; in the name of Basu, featuring Chief Justice of Bangladesh Supreme Court Muhammad Habibur Rahman as Convener.

A research institute has been named after Jyoti Basu named &quot;Jyoti Basu Centre of Social Studies and Research&quot; in Newtown, West Bengal.

==Legacy==

Jyoti Basu has been praised for

* implementing land reforms which led to a huge boost in agricultural productivity of the state
* democratisation of panchayati raj institutions of the state
* maintaining communal harmony in midst of the &quot;Ram-mandir&quot; agitation and Mandal Commission agitation
* establishing the Haldia Industrial Belt, Salt Lake Electronics Complex and Bakreshwar Thermal Power Station
* maintaining political stability in the state in midst of Naxalite-Maoist insurgency

Following the end of 34-years of unbroken Communist rule in West Bengal which he had initiated in 1977, a year and a half after his death, despite of him drafting various important social reforms, many criticized him for his controversial practices during being in power as the CM of West Bengal, listed below are some allegations which are inflicted against him:-

* causing massive deindustrialisation of the state due to his unwavering support to incessant &quot;gherao&quot;s and &quot;bandhs&quot; of Communist labour unions in the name of protecting labour rights
* initiating brain drain by abolishing English education at primary level in schools run by the state government in the name of anti-imperialism and opposing application of computers over unsubstantiated fears of increasing unemployment
* fostering favouritism by meting out preferential treatment of loyal party cadres over competent non-Communist people
* creation of a &quot;party-society&quot; by asserting dominance of conservative party ideologues in every sphere of life, most notably in bureaucratic appointments and universities
* legitimisation of political violence through his semi-Stalinist style of ruling 
* authorisation of police brutalities against dissidents as seen in Marichjhapi massacre and 1993 Kolkata firing 
* refusal to condemn or even take action against CPI(M) cadres committing acts of terror like the Sainbari murder, Bijon Setu massacre, 1990 Bantala rape case, 1991 Kandua hand-chopping and Nanoor massacre

Critics state that Jyoti Basu&#x27;s legacy consists of:

* loadshedding (which became rampant throughout the state since his tenure as deputy CM under Ajoy Mukherjee in 1967 and continued to plague the state throughout Communist rule)
* floods (caused due to lack of development in rural areas fostered by the culture of favouritism towards fellow partymen)
* Nandan (the only major contribution of Basu&#x27;s government to the city of Kolkata which saw massive deindustrialisation and political violence under his rule)
* the corporate empire of his son Chandan only

==In popular culture==
Centre of Indian Trade Unions along with Haldia Regional Committee released an album on Jyoti Basu in 2000.

In 2005, Gautam Ghosh made a documentary film named &quot;Jyoti Basur Sange&#x27; (trans. &quot;A journey with Jyoti Basu&quot;), which was screened at Nandan on 31 April 2005 and at another auditorium in Memari. The film tracks Basu&#x27;s childhood days in Bangladesh, student life in London and political career in Calcutta. The writer Goutam Ghose trailed Jyoti Basu for eight years, from 1997 to 2004, across campaigns and countries for making the documentary.
In 2006, a CD collection was released, based on interviews with Basu, named &quot;Antaranga Jyoti Basu&quot;.

<doc id="1009249" wikidata="Q7894504" url="?curid=1009249" title="University Air Squadron">
<text>University Air Squadrons (UAS), are Royal Air Force training units under the command of No. 6 Flying Training School RAF. That offers training and flight training to university students, with the goal of attracting students into a career as an RAF officer after university. Primarily its goal is achieved through delivery of this training as well as force development, adventure training and leadership development to its members. These provide a taste of life in the service and to give experience to their members in preparation for taking up a career as an officer in one of the RAF&#x27;s many branches. Members are under no obligation to continue service after university and may resign at any time.

Members of the UAS are attested personnel of the RAF Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR) and are paid for their service. Upon joining students hold the rank of Officer Cadet (OF-D). Some go on to obtain commissions in the RAF Volunteer Reserve while still studying for their degree, Others may choose to seek a commission in the Regular or Reserve forces of the RAF after their degree, while some others choose to stop training with the RAF after leaving university. 

On the run-up to World War II the squadrons were an important source of pilots for the RAF during the Battle of Britain. Officer Cadets, who were already members of the RAFVR, were called up for active service in the middle of studying for their degrees.

Many UAS squadrons are parents to Air Experience Flights (AEF) which provide an experience of flying to Air Cadets.

==Training and selection==
To apply for the UAS a person must be enrolled on an undergraduate course at a British University, and express an interest to their local UAS squadron at their freshers fayre, following this a prospective candidate will then submit an application. From there selection interviews take place to pick candidates who will move forward to join the UAS. Candidates must also pass a RAF entry fitness test and medical. After completing the selection process successfully candidates are formally attested and mustered at the rank of Officer Cadet, and their training can commence.

Members are expected to attend training nights, usually on a weekly basis, as well as attending several annual training camps. The flying syllabus of 56 sorties follows Elementary Flying Training (EFT). The flying training is supplemented with ground training and adventure training, both in the UK and abroad.

=== Flying Training ===
Most UAS training is a cut-down version of EFT and focuses on training the student to various levels of solo standard. 

Successful completion of the Core Syllabus qualifies the student pilot for the award of the Preliminary Flying Badge (PFB), or &#x27;Budgie Wings&#x27; as they are sometimes called. However, each student is expected to reach solo standard before the end of their second year on the squadron. This has become one of the criteria for granting a student member a third year of membership.

For those Officer Cadets who finish the Core syllabus with time remaining on the squadron, an advanced syllabus has recently been introduced consisting of Aerobatics, Formation Flying and Low Level Navigation. There is no specific time requirement as with the core syllabus, as progress in the advanced phase is made at a rate by which the student pilot is able to achieve the desired results.

=== Ground Training ===
Beyond flying, UASs follow a loose Ground Training syllabus. Although squadrons generally do not follow the syllabus as a training plan, the majority of subjects are covered at some point through the students&#x27; academic year. These can include attending Adventure Training expeditions, both overseas and within the UK, learning drill, undertaking a fieldcraft exercise such as the recent &#x27;STRIKE&#x27; exercises run from RAFC Cranwell, understanding the principles of air power and developing leadership skills. Air Power Force Development Experiences are also undertaken to encourage an understanding of air power in both a historical and contemporary context.

As the UAS continues to move beyond its former role of providing Elementary Flying Training to RAF Direct Entry students and UAS Students, more and more ground training opportunities are becoming available, making the UASs more suitable for Officer Cadets pursuing careers in the military other than as aircrew. However, the emphasis and priority remain on flying as the core function of each UAS. In 2003 it was estimated that 60% of pilots recruited into the Royal Air Force came through the UAS system.

In addition to a two-week period of continuous training in the summer, UAS Officer Cadets are typically required to participate in one training night a week during the university terms. This usually entails a guest speaker presenting on an aspect of the RAF or the military to develop service knowledge. Most squadrons also offer camps at Easter, Christmas, and September for Officer Cadets to undertake intensive periods of sport, flying and adventure training.

A limited number of week-long Summer Vacation Attachments (SVA) at another RAF base are offered to cadet, where they are seconded to an active regular RAF unit to learn more about their role.

=== Adventurous Personal Development Training (APDT) ===
In accordance with the ground training syllabus, there are opportunities for Officer Cadets to participate in APDT.

There are frequent squadron expeditions in areas within the UK and overseas in Europe as well as Peru, Canada and Mongolia. Expeditions can include all manner of adventurous training, such as mountain biking, parachuting, alpine sports, rock climbing, abseiling, white water rafting, coasteering, gorge walking and canoeing.

=== Sports ===
In accordance with the ground training syllabus, there are many opportunities for Officer Cadets to participate in inter-UAS sports competitions.

The UASs hold annual sporting competitions such as;

*Superteams - mixed events whereby squadron&#x27;s compete in a test of physical strength and courage.
*Swimming
*Football - The Broadgate Cup (named after the Town Headquarters location of East Midlands Universities Air Squadron)
*Hockey - The Balti &amp; Korma Cup
*Volleyball
*Netball
*Cross-country running

<text>The &quot;Stand By Your Ad&quot; provision (SBYA) of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA, also known as the McCain–Feingold Act), enacted in 2002, requires candidates in the United States for federal political office, as well as interest groups and political parties supporting or opposing a candidate, to include in political advertisements on television and radio &quot;a statement by the candidate that identifies the candidate and states that the candidate has approved the communication&quot;. The provision was intended to force political candidates running any campaign for office in the United States to associate themselves with their television and radio advertising, thereby discouraging them from making controversial claims or attack ads.

In American politics, &quot;I approve this message&quot; (sometimes in the past tense, also with &quot;authorize&quot; in place of &quot;approve&quot; or with &quot;ad&quot; instead of &quot;message&quot;) is a phrase said by candidates for federal office to comply with this provision.

The DISCLOSE Act, proposed by Democrats in a response to the Supreme Court decision in &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot; (which held that corporations and labor unions have a constitutional right to spend unlimited sums of money on advocacy ads), would have required the heads of non-campaign organizations funding political advertisements (such as &quot;super PACs&quot; or corporations) to appear on-camera and follow the &quot;stand by your ad&quot; requirement. Although the bill passed the House of Representatives, it failed in the Senate and did not become law.

==Purpose and origins==

Attack ads that criticize an opponent&#x27;s political platform quickly rose to popularity in United States since the 1960s. In more recent times these ads became increasingly ad hominem attacks, some of them appearing to be anonymous, that discouraged voters. Proponents of the Stand By Your Ad provision, such as Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) who sponsored the provision in the BCRA, advocate that by forcing candidates to associate themselves with their attacks in the ads, voters would be more inclined to punish them for using such a strategy, thus discouraging candidates from campaigning in such a manner.

The earliest roots of the provision can be traced to the 1996 Senate election in Minnesota, where a grassroots movement known as &quot;Minnesota Compact&quot; attempted to combat negative campaigning that was rampant in the state, though what was proposed remained voluntary.

In 1999, the &quot;Stand By Your Ad&quot; provision was brought up again, this time in the 1999 North Carolina General Assembly. The &quot;Campaign Reform Act&quot; S.881 was ratified and signed into state law on July 21, 1999. This required candidates and their campaign committees to

Following the perceived success of the &quot;Stand By Your Ad&quot; provision in North Carolina state law in reducing negative campaigning, similar measures were introduced into other state legislatures. Two years later, a bill was introduced in Congress to extend this provision to federal law. It was eventually absorbed into the BCRA, which addressed the issue of financing of political campaigns, that was signed into law by George W. Bush on March 27, 2002.

==Implementation==
Under Section 311 of the BCRA, Section 318 the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 441d) was amended to include the &quot;Stand By Your Ad&quot; provision. Representative David Price of North Carolina proposed the amendment, modeling after the North Carolina law. Price stated that &quot;The American people are sick of the relentlessly negative tone of campaigns, particularly in presidential races. &quot;Stand by your ad&quot; isn&#x27;t just about restoring civility to campaigns. It&#x27;s also about restoring people&#x27;s faith in our political process.&quot;

The most prominent effect was on television ads, which now required candidates to include in any campaign ad the candidate or the candidate&#x27;s campaign runs

The phrase can be said at any point during the ad, but is typically inserted at the beginning or the end. The provision also covers radio advertising, in which the voice of the candidate approving the communication is required.

If the advertisement is not in English, the phrase is given in the same language; in the 2004 presidential election for example, George W. Bush&#x27;s Spanish-language advertisements ended with the message &quot;Soy George W. Bush y aprobé este mensaje&quot;.

Failure to comply may result in penalties from the Federal Election Commission, but more importantly, loss of the &quot;lowest rate&quot; status for political ads, for the entire duration of the campaign. However, this rule is enforced at the discretion of the station manager, and often only through legal action by the opposing candidate. For example, in the 2008 Minnesota senate election, challenger Al Franken accused Senator Norm Coleman of omitting 1.1 seconds of the required visual of the candidate, a mistake that could potentially double the advertising rates and costs millions to Coleman&#x27;s campaign. Including Coleman at the same duration of campaigning, Republicans in four Senate state races were subject to investigation by the Federal Election Commission and Federal Communications Commission for allegedly short-changing on &quot;Stand By Your Ad&quot; disclaimer.

==Online advertising==
The &quot;Stand By Your Ad&quot; requirements do not cover any form of advertising over the Internet. Campaigns now regard the Internet a medium that is as important as television, radio and print advertising, or perhaps even more important due to its cost-effectiveness and rate of propagation.

Candidates have been known to take the mudslinging online, hoping that it would create sufficient controversy that media outlets would afford the coverage it needed without associating themselves to the attack. During the 2004 presidential election for instance, George W. Bush&#x27;s campaign produced a web video with the conclusion &quot;Kerry (D-MA)Brought to you by the special interests&quot; and sent it out to six million supporters via email. Another known tactic is for any campaign or person to upload an exclusive online attack ad, known or anonymously, on a video-sharing website such as YouTube without taking any credit for it. This was highlighted by the media after an anonymous editor uploaded a parody 1984 ad depicting Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY) as &quot;Big Brother&quot; during the 2008 Democratic primaries, which garnered over five million views online.

Wyden has since proposed to extend the requirement to political advertising on the Internet. The sequel &quot;Stand By Your Internet Ad Act&quot; was introduced into the United States Congress on April 12, 2005, but has received little momentum since. This bipartisan effort by Senators Wyden (D-Oregon) and Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) would apply the existing rules to include additional electioneering strategies like print ads and internet ads, in an effort to deter candidates from inflammatory campaign communications.

In March 2023, a final rule was put in place by the FEC that provided more clarity around the concept of public communications, in an effort to better apply regulatory standards upon online and digital political ads which have largely been unaddressed; in so doing, the FEC&#x27;s attention on internet advertisements has brought about a new definition: &quot;communications placed for a fee on another person&#x27;s website, digital device, application, or advertising platform,” that can withstand technological advances to come.

==Reception==
Howard Dean, who ran for the 2004 Democratic nomination, took some unwarranted attacks from people who were not aware of the act, who thought he was being self-important or obvious in the phrasing. While opponents of the provision at its time of introduction lodged challenges in court that it would violate the First Amendment, others believed that the law merely stiffened disclaimer guidelines and had no effect on limiting free speech. One example is the &quot;McConnell v. FEC&quot; decision, which upheld the Stand By Your Ad provision as being constitutional, yet dissenting concerns remain about the threat posed to anonymity due to the regulatory mandate that calls for TV and radio ads to publicly disclose their sponsors.

Campaigns have lamented that the seconds used for the candidates to approve the communication results in less time for them to communicate their message, increasing their costs of campaigning. One media adviser mentioned that the requirement reduced the number of positive spots that the producer can have. Other candidates, however, regard it as an opportunity to affirm or encapsulate the theme of their message: &quot;I&#x27;m Tom Kean, Jr. Together, we can break the back of corruption. That&#x27;s why I approved this message.&quot;

A study by Brigham Young University, however, revealed that advertisements where the candidate has approved the communication had a more positive impact in comparison to those that did not, regardless of whether they knew the candidates well. It also concluded that the provision made viewers have more confidence that the political campaigns were run in a truthful and fair manner.

== Use outside campaign advertising ==
Although rarely noted by pundits during the course of congressional debate, the provision became one of the most recognized—and joked about—changes in the content of television ads.

Several politicians have made references to the phrase in aspects of their campaign outside radio or television advertising. In the 2006 elections, Senator Joseph Lieberman declared &quot;I approve this election&quot; in his acceptance speech, following his victory as a third-party candidate (Connecticut for Lieberman). Just before the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton made news by announcing that &quot;she did not approve this message&quot; in reference to the John McCain campaign using clips of her attacking Barack Obama during the Democratic primaries.

<text>Nafis Sadik (18 August 1929 – 14 August 2022) was a Pakistani physician, Special Adviser to the UN Secretary General with additional responsibilities as Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Asia, and former executive director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) from 1987 to 2000. She retired from the post in December 2000.

==Early life and education==
Nafis Sadik was born on 18 August 1929 in Jaunpur, British India as the daughter of Iffat Ara and Muhammad Shoaib, former Finance Minister of Pakistan. 
She studied medicine at and graduated with a Doctor of Medicine degree from Dow Medical College in Karachi, Pakistan. 

After graduating, she went to the USA to complete an internship in gynaecology and obstetrics at City Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland and finished her further education at the Johns Hopkins University.

==Career ==
She returned to Pakistan in 1954 with her husband, to become a civilian doctor in army hospitals. She worked until 1963 in women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s wards in Pakistan Armed Forces hospitals. In 1964, Sadik was appointed head of the Health Section of the Government’s Planning Commission.

Sadik joined the Pakistan Central Family Planning Council in 1966 as Director of Planning and Training, the Government agency charged with carrying out the national family planning programme. She was appointed Deputy Director-General in 1968 and Director-General in 1970.

=== United Nations ===
Sadik joined the UN Population Fund in 1971. Shortly after the sudden death of the UNFPA Executive Director, Rafael Salas, UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar appointed her to succeed him, in 1987, thus becoming the first woman to head one of the United Nations&#x27; major voluntarily-funded programmes.

Sadik consistently called attention to the importance of addressing the needs of women, and of involving women directly in making and carrying out development policy. This was particularly important for population policies and programmes in the Third World and developing countries, where her strategy for providing females with education and the tools to control their own fertility has influenced the global birthrate.

In June 1990, the Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed Sadik Secretary-General of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), 1994.

=== Other activities ===
Sadik&#x27;s contribution to improving the health of women and children in the global community brought her many international awards and honors.

She was a member of the Board of Governors of the Foundation for Human Development, and a member of the South Asian Commission on the Asian Challenge. Sadik was the President of the Society for International Development (SID) for the period 1994–1997. Nafis Sadik also was a member of Association of Physicians of Pakistani Descent of North America.

After her retirement from the United Nations Population Fund, she served on several boards of directors and advisory panels of non-profit organizations and research institutions in the area of population control including on the Advisor Board for the German Foundation for World Population. Sadik was an Emeritus Member of Population Action International.

== Personal life, death and legacy==
Sadik married Azhar Sadik, a Pakistani army officer died earlier in 2011. Nafis Sadik died of congestive heart failure on 14 August 2022 in the United States, at the age of 92. Sadik&#x27;s husband and a daughter predeceased her. She was survived by three daughters - Ambereen Dar, Wafa Hasan andGhazala Abediand a son, Omar Sadik.

A major newspaper of Pakistan wrote in her obituary:
&quot;Dr Nafis Sadik of Pakistan, a guiding force to the world in maternal and child health as well as family planning, passed away in New York on Sunday&quot;.

<text>The Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade is an annual parade in New York City presented by the American-based department store chain Macy&#x27;s. The Parade first took place in 1924, tying it for the second-oldest Thanksgiving parade in the United States with America&#x27;s Thanksgiving Parade in Detroit (with both parades being four years younger than Philadelphia&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade). The three-hour parade is held in Manhattan, ending outside Macy&#x27;s Herald Square, and takes place from 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Thanksgiving Day, and has been televised nationally on NBC since 1953.

==History==
===1920s: Early history===
In 1924, store employees marched to Macy&#x27;s Herald Square, the flagship store on 34th Street, dressed in vibrant costumes. There were floats, professional bands and live animals borrowed from the Central Park Zoo. At the end of that first parade, Santa Claus was welcomed into Herald Square. At this first parade, Santa was enthroned on the Macy&#x27;s balcony at the 34th Street store entrance, where he was then crowned &quot;King of the Kiddies&quot;. With an audience of over 250,000 people, the parade was such a success that Macy&#x27;s declared it would become an annual event, despite media reports only barely covering the first parade.

The Macy&#x27;s parade was enough of a success to push Ragamuffin Day, the typical children&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day activity from 1870 into the 1920s, into obscurity. Ragamuffin Day featured children going around and performing a primitive version of trick-or-treating, a practice that by the 1920s had come to annoy most adults. The public backlash against such begging in the 1930s (when most Americans were struggling in the midst of the Great Depression) led to promotion of alternatives, including Macy&#x27;s parade. While ragamuffin parades that competed with Macy&#x27;s would continue into the 1930s, the competition from Macy&#x27;s would overwhelm the practice, and the last ragamuffin parade in New York City would take place in 1956.

Tony Sarg loved to work with marionettes from an early age. After moving to London to start his own marionette business, Sarg moved to New York City to perform with his puppets on the street. Macy&#x27;s heard about Sarg&#x27;s talents and asked him to design a window display of a parade for the store.

===1930s–1980s: Growth===
Through the 1930s, the parade continued to grow, with crowds of over one million people lining the parade route in 1933. The first Mickey Mouse balloon entered the parade in 1934. The annual festivities were broadcast on local radio stations in New York City from 1932 to 1941 and resumed in 1945, running through 1951.

The parade was suspended from 1942 to 1944 as a result of World War II because rubber and helium were needed for the war effort. The parade resumed in 1945 and became known nationwide shortly afterwards, having been prominently featured in the 1947 film &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;, which included footage of the 1946 festivities. The event had its first broadcast on network television in 1948 (see ). From 1984 to 2019, the balloons were made by Raven Industries of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, through its Raven Aerostar division.

Marching bands had been part of the parade since the beginning; it was not until 1958 when the first celebrity performances were added, as the Benny Goodman sextet joined the parade. Technical and logistical difficulties marred many of the early attempts to perform live music on moving stages, and in 1964, the parade began transitioning to lip sync.

Since 1985, the parade has traditionally been led by the New York City Police Department Highway Patrol. In 2019, the cast of Sesame Street led the parade in honor of the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

=== 1990s–2000s: Safety changes ===
During the 1993 parade, strong gusts of wind pushed the Sonic the Hedgehog balloon into a lamppost at Columbus Circle. The lamppost damaged the balloon and the top of the post broke off while inside the balloon, dragging it down, injuring a child and an off-duty police officer in the process.

During the 1997 parade, very high winds pushed the Cat in the Hat balloon into a lamppost. The falling debris struck a parade-goer, fracturing her skull and leaving her in a coma for 24 days. The winds also caused trouble for the other balloons. The Barney the Dinosaur balloon veered out of control and was eventually stomped and stabbed by the NYPD. The Pink Panther balloon collapsed onto the ground and was stabbed by an NYPD inspector. Mayor Rudy Giuliani formed a task force in response, and numerous safety regulations were implemented the next year, including size restrictions that eliminated larger balloons such as the Cat in the Hat and the Pink Panther, the removal of lamppost arms on the parade route, and both physical training and lessons in balloon physics for handlers.

During the 2005 parade, the M&amp;M&#x27;s balloon collided with a streetlight in Times Square; parts of the light fell on two sisters, who suffered minor injuries. New safety measures were incorporated in 2006 to prevent accidents and balloon-related injuries. One measure taken was the installation of wind measurement devices to alert parade organizers to any unsafe conditions that could cause the balloons to behave erratically. In addition, parade officials implemented a measure to keep the balloons closer to the ground during windy conditions. New York City law prohibits Macy&#x27;s from flying the full-size balloons if sustained winds exceed or wind gusts exceed ; New York&#x27;s tall buildings and mostly uniform grid plan can amplify wind velocity on city streets. This law, imposed in 1997, has never been activated, despite several close calls; the only time the parade balloons were ever grounded was in 1971. Each balloon has a risk profile to determine handling in windy conditions; taller, upright balloons are rotated to appear horizontal and face downward in such situations (as was the case in 2019, when a grounding was narrowly averted). The remaining floats and performances will continue as scheduled should the balloons be grounded.

=== 2010s–2020s ===
The 2018 parade was the coldest to date, with the temperature at 19 °F (-7.2 °C) during the event. The warmest was in 1933 at 69 °F (20.5 °C). The 2006 parade was the wettest with 1.72&quot; (49 mm) of rain. Actresses Caitlin Kinnunen and Isabelle McCalla&#x27;s kiss during &quot;The Prom&quot;&#x27;s performance at the 2018 parade received significant media attention for being the first broadcast of a same-sex kiss in the parade&#x27;s history.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, the 2020 parade was downsized and closed to the public—being filmed as a broadcast-only event in the Herald Square area. There were 88% fewer participants, and social distancing was enforced. The event did not include college and high school marching bands (with the affected bands having been reinvited for 2021), nor any participant under 18 years of age. Balloons were tethered to a &quot;specially rigged anchor vehicle framework of five specialty vehicles&quot; rather than carried by handlers. Mayor of New York City Bill de Blasio stated that it will &quot;[not be] a live parade, but something that will really give us that warmth and that great feeling we have on Thanksgiving day.&quot; In 2021, the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade returned to its traditional in-person procession with 6,500 participants marching.

The NBC broadcast of the 2022 parade marked the first time that the broadcast was hosted entirely by women, as Al Roker was unable to host that year due to blood clots in his legs and lungs.

In 2023, the parade started half an hour earlier, at 8:30 am, making it the first parade to begin earlier for almost a century. Around 10am, pro-Palestinian protesters disrupted the parade in three locations. Some of the protesters wearing white jumpsuits covered in fake blood, glued themselves to the parade route at Sixth Avenue near 45th street.

On February 25, 2025, it was announced that NBC had renewed their rights with Macy&#x27;s to air the parade for the next decade, taking the parade through 2035. The deal also includes rights to the Macy&#x27;s 4th of July Fireworks concert special and a new event, which will be announced at a later date.

==Balloons ==

The balloons were introduced in 1927, replacing live zoo animals that were featured in the first parade. In 1928, Macy&#x27;s switched from inflating the balloons with air to helium, making them float. Sarg&#x27;s large animal-shaped balloons were produced by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio from the 1920s through 1980. 

In 1928, Sarg released the five balloons, set to leak slowly over the course of a week and then descend, with a reward of $100 () for whoever found them; the reward amount fell to $50 the next year. In 1931, aviation pioneer Clarence Chamberlin spotted a dragon balloon midair, decapitated it with a wingtip, and brought the remnants back to land, where he claimed a $25 award. The practice of releasing the balloons ended in 1932, after a novice pilot attempting the same feat nearly crashed her plane.

The balloons in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade have had several varieties. The oldest is the novelty balloon class, consisting of smaller balloons ranging widely in size and handled by between one and thirty people (the smallest balloons are shaped like human heads and fit on the heads of the handlers). The larger and more popular class is the character balloons, primarily consisting of licensed pop-culture characters; each of these (16 in 2019) is handled by exactly 90 people. Since 2005, the &quot;Blue Sky Gallery&quot; has transformed the works of contemporary artists into full-size balloons; a new balloon was featured each year until 2012, and more intermittently since then.

==Performers and acts==
In addition to the well-known balloons and floats, the parade also features live music and other performances. College and high school marching bands from across the country participate in the parade. The television broadcasts feature performances by established and up-and-coming singers and bands. The Rangerettes, from Kilgore, Texas, the world’s first precision drill team, known for their precision dance routines, are also a highlight of the event. The Rockettes of Radio City Music Hall are a classic performance (having performed annually since 1957 as the last pre-parade act to perform, followed by a commercial break), as are cheerleaders and dancers chosen by the National Cheerleaders Association from various high schools across the country. The parade always concludes with the arrival of Santa Claus to ring in the Christmas and holiday season (except for the 1932 parade, when Santa led the parade). Since 2017 until 2023, the Macy&#x27;s Singing Christmas Tree choir precedes Santa Claus as the final performer of the parade, except 2022 and 2023 when they performed second-to-last.

On the NBC telecast from in front of the flagship Macy&#x27;s store on Broadway and 34th Street, the marching bands perform live music. Most &quot;live&quot; performances by musicals and individual artists lip-sync to the studio, soundtrack or cast recordings of their songs, due to the technical difficulties of attempting to sing into a wireless microphone while in a moving vehicle (performers themselves typically perform on the floats with the exceptions being the Santa&#x27;s Sleigh float and the Tom Turkey float); the NBC-flagged microphones used by performers on floats are almost always non-functioning props. Although rare, recent parade broadcasts have featured at least one live performance with no use of recorded vocals.

Every year, cast members from some Broadway shows (usually shows that debuted that year) perform either in the parade or immediately preceding the parade in front of Macy&#x27;s and before The Rockettes&#x27; performance (since NBC broadcasts the parade&#x27;s start, the performances are shown during the wait for the parade itself). The 2007 parade was notable as it took place during a strike by the I.A.T.S.E. (a stagehands&#x27; union)&quot;. Legally Blonde&quot;, the one performing musical affected by the strike, performed in show logo shirts, with makeshift props and no sets. The other three shows that year performed in theaters that were not affected by the strike.

For the 10th anniversary of the September 11th attacks in 2011, the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Parade invited family members from Tuesday&#x27;s Children (a nonprofit organization that benefits families directly impacted by terrorism) to cut the ribbon at the start of the parade with NBC&#x27;s Al Roker and led the parade with Amy Kule, the Parade&#x27;s executive producer.

Performers who are not part of Broadway shows or marching bands traditionally perform on floats. The cost to book the performers is covered by the floats&#x27; sponsors, who must also pay an entry fee to Macy&#x27;s to participate in the parade. Since 2014, the entry fee and performer fee has hovered between $200,000 and $250,000.

==Television coverage==

===Official broadcasts===
More than 44 million people typically watch the parade on television on an annual basis; in 2024, it was the most-watched television special of the year, outdrawing all of the major awards ceremonies, New Year events and Christmas specials. It was first televised locally in New York City in 1939 as an experimental broadcast on NBC&#x27;s W2XBS (now WNBC). No television stations broadcast the parade in 1940 or 1941, but local broadcasts resumed when the parade returned in 1945 after the wartime suspension. The parade began its network television appearances on CBS in 1948, the year that major, regular television network programming began. NBC has been the official broadcaster of the event since 1953. As of 2024, NBC pays Macy&#x27;s $20 million per year for the license to be the parade&#x27;s official broadcaster; the parade earns a substantial profit for the network, with ad buys averaging $900,000 per 30-second commercial in 2023—a fee comparable to &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot;—bringing in a gross revenue of $52 million. In November 2024, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that during negotiations to extend their broadcast contract for the parade and the Macy&#x27;s Fourth of July Fireworks Spectacular for ten additional years, NBC offered to pay Macy&#x27;s an increased license fee of $60 million to continue carrying the parade telecast.

At first, the telecasts were only an hour long. The telecast then expanded to two hours in 1961, reduced to 90 minutes in 1962, reverted to two hours in 1965, and expanded to all three hours of the parade in 1969. The event began to be broadcast in color in 1960. NBC airs the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade live in the Eastern Time Zone as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as the network uses broadcast feeds from that time zone (which due to time differences starts at 10:00 a.m. AST), but tape delays the telecast elsewhere in the continental U.S. and territories from the Central Time Zone westward to allow the program to air in the same 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. timeslot across its owned-and-operated and affiliated stations (except for Guam, which airs it the day after Thanksgiving at 8:30 a.m. local time, as the territory is located west of the International Date Line and therefore a day ahead from the rest of the United States). With the launch of Peacock in 2020 and branded extensions such as a virtual reality broadcast sponsored by Verizon however, it is now possible to watch the parade live across the United States without any tape delay through Peacock, or another international streaming provider with rights to NBC&#x27;s programming.

Following the morning program&#x27;s expansion to three hours in 2000 (it eventually expanded to four hours in 2007), NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; aired as an abbreviated two-hour broadcast on Thanksgiving morning, pre-empting the last two talk-focused hours of the show for the day to accommodate parade coverage. Starting with the parade&#x27;s 2023 edition, when coverage was extended a half-hour earlier (to 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time from its longtime 10:00 start), the Thanksgiving edition of &quot;Today&quot; was reduced to only 90 minutes (similar to the network&#x27;s 2017 decision to cut the program&#x27;s Saturday broadcasts to that same length to accommodate live telecasts of Premier League soccer matches held during the mid-morning to midday hours in the U.S.). Starting with the 2009 edition, NBC has aired a same-day, three-hour afternoon rebroadcast of the parade following the National Dog Show (replacing the annual broadcast of &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;, which NBC had lost the broadcast television rights to that year).

From 1963 to 1972, NBC&#x27;s coverage was hosted by Lorne Greene (who was then appearing on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Bonanza&quot;) and Betty White. David Hartman and Karen Grassle hosted the parade in 1974, with Ed McMahon serving as a location correspondent (McMahon would later become one of the main hosts from 1977 to 1981). Since 1982, NBC has appointed at least one of the hosts of &quot;Today&quot; to emcee the television broadcast, starting with Bryant Gumbel, who hosted the parade until 1984. From 1987 to 1997, NBC&#x27;s coverage was hosted by longtime &quot;Today&quot; weather anchor Willard Scott. During that period, their co-hosts included Mary Hart, Sandy Duncan, and &quot;Today&quot; colleagues Deborah Norville and Katie Couric. In recent years, NBC&#x27;s coverage has been hosted by &quot;Today&quot; anchors Matt Lauer (from 1998 to 2017), Meredith Vieira (from 2006 to 2010), Ann Curry (2011), Savannah Guthrie (since 2012) and Hoda Kotb (since 2018) as well as &quot;Today&quot; weather anchor Al Roker who usually joins the producers of the parade or the CEO of Macy&#x27;s and special guests in the ribbon cutting ceremony. In 2022, Dylan Dreyer filled in for Roker, who was recovering due to health complications involving blood clots, while Kotb hosted the ribbon cutting ceremony segment when the parade reached Herald Square, rather than when it usually takes place in the Upper West Side.

From 1972 until 1993, the television broadcast was produced and directed by Dick Schneider; from 1994 to 2023, it was executive produced by Brad Lachman (who has otherwise been known for producing reality and clip compilation television series) and produced by Bill Bracken (a longtime collaborator of Lachman&#x27;s, who continued as senior producer after the latter&#x27;s departure). Silent House Group (a Burbank-production firm founded by Baz Halpin, who executive produced the telecast with fellow company executives Mark Bracco and Linda Gierahn) assumed production responsibilities from Lachman for the 2024 telecast. Gary Halvorson (whose directorial work has centered primarily on sitcoms as well as selected television specials) directed the telecast from 1994 to 2018, succeeded by Ron de Moraes from 2019 to 2021. Announcements during the telecast were first provided by Bill McCord, then followed in succession by Bill Wendell, Lynda Lopez (the telecast&#x27;s only female announcer), and longtime &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and NBC staff announcer Don Pardo; from circa 2000 to 2010, announcer duties were helmed by Joel Godard (who also served as the announcer for &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; for much of that period), and then were assumed by &quot;Today&quot; announcer Les Marshak with the 2011 telecast. Milton DeLugg served as the telecast&#x27;s music director until his death in 2015.

Though the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade airs on nearly all of NBC&#x27;s stations, it has often been preempted in the Detroit market due to WDIV-TV&#x27;s coverage of the locally based &quot;America&#x27;s Thanksgiving Parade&quot;, which the station has aired from 1964 to 1984 and (following a nine-year run on ABC affiliate WXYZ-TV) since 1995. While WDIV did carry the later tape-delayed broadcast from 2009 to 2019, local carriage of the live Macy&#x27;s parade broadcast has been mostly sporadic (it aired locally on WADL from 2009 to 2016), even after the station began over-the-air digital telecasts, granting it the ability to televise the NBC telecast on a subchannel; as such, Detroit-area viewers often have to rely on nearby NBC affiliates out of Flint (WEYI), Lansing (WILX) and Toledo (WNWO) to watch the parade.

Since 2003, the parade has been broadcast in Spanish on NBC sister network Telemundo; María Celeste Arrarás, anchor of the network&#x27;s tabloid newsmagazine &quot;Al Rojo Vivo&quot;, hosted the Spanish simulcast of the parade from 2003 to 2006. Since 2021, the Telemundo simulcast has been hosted primarily by Carlos Adian (co-host of daytime entertainment/lifestyle talk show &quot;En Casa con Telemundo&quot;); Adian was joined by former Miss Universe Andrea Meza as co-host starting with the 2022 edition. The parade won nine Emmy Awards for outstanding achievements in special event coverage since 1979. Since 2020, the parade also provided audio description via a second audio program channel.

From 2016 to 2019, Verizon produced a 360-degree virtual reality live telecast of the parade, with minimal commentary, made available through YouTube. The 2019 edition, produced in cooperation with NBC, had more extensive production, adding hosts Terry Crews, Lilly Singh and Ross Matthews, also adding &quot;virtual balloons&quot; generated through viewers&#x27; votes. Verizon&#x27;s simulcast of the 2020 event ran in a traditional flat, single-perspective format, and was the very first to be broadcast internationally, not just in the United States, through Verizon&#x27;s and Macy&#x27;s YouTube and Twitter handles. Verizon did not simulcast the 2021 event in either format.

The first live international broadcast of the parade occurred in 2020, when Philippine cable television channel TAP TV became the first foreign-based broadcaster to air the parade&#x27;s live telecast. Before that, the broadcasts were delayed and aired on Black Friday on what is now CNN Philippines until 2013. In addition, delayed broadcasts are aired to United States military installations overseas through American Forces Network hours following the original U.S. broadcast.

===Unofficial broadcasts===
Although the parade committee can endorse an official broadcaster, the parade takes place on public streets, and therefore Macy&#x27;s can only limit exclusivity of coverage of the event to directly within the area in front of the Herald Square store, and cannot restrict coverage through exclusive rights like sporting and other events that take place inside restricted-access venues.

CBS (which has a studio in Times Square) carried unofficial coverage as &quot;The Thanksgiving Day Parade on CBS&quot;. The rerouting of the parade starting from 2012 (see below) moved the parade out of the view of CBS&#x27;s cameras and thus made it significantly more difficult for the network to cover the parade. However, the route now passes along the west side of the network&#x27;s Black Rock headquarters building along Sixth Avenue (with the hosts stationed on a temporary tower platform at the Sixth/W. 53rd St. corner of the building), and CBS nevertheless continued to cover the parade as before.

CBS&#x27;s unofficial coverage aired live in most time zones, allowing viewers to see the parade as much as two hours before the official NBC coverage aired in their area before Peacock nulled this advantage; until 2023, CBS broadcast the parade on delay on the West Coast, immediately after the Detroit Lions Thanksgiving game in the years when CBS would carry the Lions&#x27; traditional Thanksgiving game or at 9:00 a.m. local time in the years when they carried the Dallas Cowboys Thanksgiving game.

CBS&#x27;s coverage was originally part of the &quot;All-American Thanksgiving Day Parade&quot;, a broadcast that included footage from multiple parades across North America, including parades at Detroit, Philadelphia and Disneyland (the latter was later replaced by Opryland USA in 1997 and after that Miami Beach), and taped footage of the Toronto Santa Claus Parade (taped usually the second or third weekend of November) and the Aloha Floral Parade in Honolulu (which usually took place in September). Beginning in 2004, however, CBS has focused exclusively on the Macy&#x27;s parade, but avoids using the Macy&#x27;s name due to the lack of an official license. To compensate for the fact that the Broadway and music performances can only appear on NBC, CBS adds their own pre-recorded performances (also including Broadway shows, although different from the ones that are part of the official parade and recorded off-site) to fill out the special. With the lack of a live parade for 2020, CBS aired &quot;The CBS Thanksgiving Day Celebration&quot;—which was hosted by Kevin Frazier and Keltie Knight of &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, and featured highlights and new performances.

For the 1997 parade, MTV guest reporters, Beavis and Butt-head, with host Kurt Loder, provided their usual style of commentary on aspects of the parade, and of their take on Thanksgiving in general. The special, titled &quot;Beavis and Butt-head Do Thanksgiving&quot;, included a balloon of Beavis and Butt-head spectating from their couch. The balloon was not participating in the parade, but stationed on top of a building alongside the parade route.

CBS did not carry parade coverage in 2024, as the network has been cutting expenses under its current Paramount Global ownership as part of its proposed merger with Skydance Media, which included the defection of its longtime specials &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot; and &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; to NBC, whose parent company owns the rights to both programs.

Radio coverage of the parade is provided by Audacy&#x27;s WINS (1010 AM) in New York City; it is one of the few times throughout the year in which WINS breaks away from its all-news radio format.

==Parade route==
The Parade has always taken place in Manhattan. The parade originally started from 145th Street in Harlem and ended at Macy&#x27;s flagship in Herald Square (at the intersection of Broadway, Sixth Avenue, and 34th Street), making a route.

In the 1930s, the balloons were inflated around 110th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, near the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. The parade proceeded south on Amsterdam Avenue to 106th Street and turned east. At Columbus Avenue, the balloons had to be lowered to go under the Ninth Avenue El. Past the El tracks, the parade proceeded east on 106th Street to Central Park West and turned south to terminate at Macy&#x27;s flagship.

A new route was established for the 2009 parade. From 77th Street and Central Park West, the route went south along Central Park to Columbus Circle, then east along Central Park South. The parade would then make a right turn at 7th Avenue and go south to Times Square. At 42nd Street, the parade turned left and went east, then at 6th Avenue turned right again at Bryant Park. Heading south on 6th Avenue, the parade turned right at 34th Street (at Herald Square) and proceeded west to the terminating point at 7th Avenue where the floats are taken down. The 2009 route change eliminated Broadway completely, where the parade has traveled down for decades. The City of New York said that the new route would provide more space for the parade, and more viewing space for spectators. Another reason for implementing the route change is the city&#x27;s subsequent transformation of Broadway into a pedestrian-only zone at Times Square.

Another new route was introduced with the 2012 parade. This change is similar to the 2009 route, but eliminated Times Square altogether, instead going east from Columbus Circle along Central Park South, then south on Sixth Avenue to Herald Square.

Balloon teams race through Columbus Circle due to higher winds in this flat area, making it a less desirable observation site. New York City officials preview the parade route and try to eliminate as many potential obstacles as possible, including rotating overhead traffic signals out of the way. Viewing is restricted from 38th Street through the end of the parade route, as this area is used for the NBC telecast.

==Similar parades==
Other American cities also have parades held on Thanksgiving, none of which are run by Macy&#x27;s. The nation&#x27;s oldest Thanksgiving parade (the Gimbels parade, which has had many sponsors over the years, and is now known as the 6abc Dunkin&#x27; Donuts Thanksgiving Day Parade) was first held in Philadelphia in 1920. Other cities with parades on the holiday include the McDonald&#x27;s Thanksgiving Parade in Chicago, Illinois and parades in Plymouth, Massachusetts; Seattle, Washington; Houston, Texas; Detroit, Michigan; and Fountain Hills, Arizona. There is also a second Thanksgiving balloon parade within the New York metropolitan area, the UBS balloon parade in Stamford, Connecticut, located away; that parade is held the Sunday before Thanksgiving, so as not to compete with the parade in New York City. It usually does not duplicate any balloon characters. The Celebrate the Season Parade, held the last Saturday in November in Pittsburgh, was sponsored by Macy&#x27;s from 2006 to 2013 after Macy&#x27;s bought the Kaufmann&#x27;s store chain that had sponsored that parade prior to 2006.

===Universal&#x27;s Holiday Parade Featuring Macy&#x27;s===
Since 2002, Macy&#x27;s Studios has partnered with the Universal Orlando Resort (owned by NBC parent NBCUniversal) to bring balloons and floats from New York City to the theme park in Florida every holiday season in an event known as the Macy&#x27;s Holiday Parade. The parade is performed daily and includes the iconic Santa Claus float. Performers from the Orlando area are cast as various clowns, and the park used to invite guests to be &quot;balloon handlers&quot; for the parade. In 2017, the Macy&#x27;s Holiday Parade was renamed to Universal&#x27;s Holiday Parade Featuring Macy&#x27;s. In 2020, as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the parade could not be run. Instead, a walkthrough experience known as Universal&#x27;s Holiday Experience Featuring Macy&#x27;s Balloons took place throughout the holiday season, displaying various floats and balloons that would normally be seen in the parade.

==In popular culture==
* The 1947 film &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;, begins with the parade, as do most of its remakes. The film portrays the real Santa Claus being hired to work at Macy&#x27;s after its own Santa impersonator gets drunk during the parade. NBC, in its telecasts, often showed the original 1947 film on Thanksgiving afternoon, following its coverage of the parade and the National Dog Show.
* The 1984 film &quot;Broadway Danny Rose&quot; features a sequence in which Danny (Woody Allen) and Tina (Mia Farrow) are chased into a warehouse containing Parade materials and helium gas supplies; near the end of the film Tina is at the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Parade itself.
* The parade is featured in the 1987 children&#x27;s book &quot;We&#x27;re Back! A Dinosaur&#x27;s Story&quot; and its animated film adaptation where Rex mistakenly befriends a dinosaur balloon.
* In the 1994 &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Mom and Pop Store&quot;, Elaine wins a spot on the parade route for her boss, Mr. Pitt, to hold the Woody Woodpecker balloon.
* In 1994 the first Thanksgiving-themed episode of &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;The One Where Underdog Gets Away&quot;, centered on the accidental release of the (unused at the time) &quot;Underdog&quot; balloon.
* In 2008, a Coca-Cola CGI ad aired in the United States during Super Bowl XLII. The commercial&#x27;s plot centered around Underdog and fictional Stewie Griffin balloons chasing a Coke bottle-shaped balloon through New York City. The spot ended with a Charlie Brown balloon holding the Coke balloon. The advertisement won a Silver Lion Award at the annual Lions International Advertising Festival in Cannes, France, that year, and the clip of the commercial with the Griffin balloon was featured in a Macy&#x27;s commercial in October 2008 (along with clips from &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;, &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and other media where Macy&#x27;s was mentioned). The commercial was also referenced in a 2011 episode of &quot;Family Guy.&quot; Stewie, one of its main characters, is seen watching the parade only to see the balloon of himself in the parade.
* In the 2011 film &quot;Tower Heist&quot;, the climax of the film takes place during the parade, using archival footage from the 2010 parade.
* In the 2016 reboot of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, the Ghostbusters fight a haunted balloon parade including several Macy&#x27;s balloons from the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s.

<text>Gerald Anthony Bucciarelli (July 31, 1951 – May 28, 2004) was an American actor.

==Life and career==
Anthony was born Gerald Anthony Bucciarelli, the son of Italian immigrants had roles and appearances on many shows such as &quot;Another World&quot; and &quot;L.A. Law&quot;.

He may be best-remembered for his role as Marco Dane on the ABC soap opera, &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, a role he played from 1977–86, and from 1989–90, and on fellow ABC serial &quot;General Hospital&quot; in 1992.

Marco arrived in Llanview as a low-life pimp and pornographer who was only supposed to last for 8 days, but Anthony&#x27;s offbeat look as well as his impassioned performances and electric chemistry with co-star Judith Light (Karen Wolek) made him such a fan favorite that only a few months after producers killed off Marco in 1978 they revealed the real victim was Marco&#x27;s heretofore unknown brother, Mario Corelli. Anthony was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for the role in 1982, and won for Marco on &quot;General Hospital&quot; in 1993.

During his absences from daytime, Anthony had many guest-starring roles on television and a recurring role as kind-hearted Father Pete Terranova on &quot;Wiseguy&quot; from 1988–89. Anthony also directed an independent film, &quot;Twisted&quot;, and episodes of &quot;All My Children&quot;.

He continued to appear sporadically in primetime; in early 2003, he played a bit part on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;; when asked why he had not returned to daytime sooner, he said &quot;no one asked me.&quot;

==Marriage==
Anthony was married to his &quot;One Life to Live&quot; co-star Brynn Thayer from 1981 to 1983.

==Death==
Anthony died by suicide on May 28, 2004, at age 52 in Butler, New Jersey.

<doc id="1009272" wikidata="Q5189819" url="?curid=1009272" title="Cruciform">
<text>Cruciform is a term for physical manifestations resembling a common cross or Christian cross. The label can be extended to architectural shapes, biology, art, and design.

== Cruciform architectural plan ==

Christian churches are commonly described as having a cruciform architecture. In Early Christian, Byzantine and other Eastern Orthodox forms of church architecture this is likely to mean a tetraconch plan, a Greek cross, with arms of equal length or, later, a cross-in-square plan.

In the Western churches, a cruciform architecture usually, though not exclusively, means a church built with the layout developed in Gothic architecture. This layout comprises:

*An east end, containing an altar and often with an elaborate, decorated window, through which light will shine in the early part of the day.
*A west end, which sometimes contains a baptismal font, being a large decorated bowl, in which water can be firstly, blessed (dedicated to the use and purposes of God) and then used for baptism.
*North and south transepts, being &quot;arms&quot; of the cross and often containing rooms for gathering, small side chapels, or in many cases other necessities such as an organ and toilets.
*The crossing, which in later designs often was under a tower or dome.

In churches that are not oriented with the altar at the geographical east end, it is usual to refer to the altar end as &quot;liturgical east&quot; and so forth.

Methodist tabernacles also have a cruciform shape.

== Cruciform DNA ==
DNA can undergo transitions to form a cruciform shape, including a structure called a Holliday junction. This structure is important for the critical biological processes of DNA recombination and repair mutations that occur in the cell.

== Cruciform joint ==

A cruciform joint is a specific joint in which four spaces are created by the welding of three plates of metal at right angles.

== Cruciform manuscript ==
A cruciform manuscript was a form of Anglo-Saxon / Insular manuscript written with the words in a block shaped like a cross.

== Cruciform melody ==

In music, a melody of four pitches where a straight line drawn between the outer pair bisects a straight line drawn between the inner pair, thus forming a cross. In its simplest form, the cruciform melody is a changing tone, where the melody ascends or descends by step, skips below or above the first pitch, then returns to the first pitch by step. Often representative of the Christian cross, such melodies are cruciform in their retrogrades or inversions. Johann Sebastian Bach, whose last name may be represented in tones through a musical cryptogram known as the BACH motif that is a cruciform melody, employed the device extensively. The subject of the fugue in c-sharp minor from &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; Book I is cruciform. See also: Cross motif.

== Cruciform tail ==
Some airplanes use a &quot;cruciform&quot; tail design, wherein the horizontal stabilizer is positioned midway up the vertical stabilizer, forming a cruciform shape when viewed from the front or rear. Some examples are the F-9 Cougar, the F-10 Skyknight and the Sud Aviation Caravelle.

The cruciform tail gives the benefit of clearing the aerodynamics of the tail away from the wake of the engine, while not requiring the same amount of strengthening of the vertical tail section in comparison with a T-tail design.

== Cruciform sword ==

The plain sword used by knights, distinctive due to the flat bar used as a guard. The overall shape of the sword when held point down is that of a cross.

It was very popular due to the protection it offered to the hand and certain attacks that rely on the cross to trap the blade of the enemy. See Sword.

== Cruciform web design ==
Cruciform web designs use a cross-shaped web page that expands to fill the width and height of the web browser window. There are a number of different approaches to implementing them.

== Cruciform product design==
In addition to common cross-shaped products, such as key chains and magnets, certain designers have gone so far as to create cruciform devices and accessories. For example, the mass-produced cruciform MP3 player &quot;Saint B&quot;, or the &quot;iBelieve&quot;, an accessory that converts the original iPod Shuffle into a cross shape designed by Scott Wilson in 2005. The cruciform MP3 players often come preloaded with audio files of the New Testament, but are mainly purchased for users to proudly display their faith.

<text>Derwent House is a historic building in Matlock in Derbyshire, England, originally the home of the important Knowles family in the 17th century. The original estate included several buildings surrounding what is now known as Derwent House, including one which is believed to be one of the oldest buildings in Matlock, dating from circa 1670, predated only by the bridge over the River Derwent.

Hall Leys Park is built on land bequeathed by the Knowles family to the parish of Matlock in 1898. Derwent House has been run as a guest house since the mid-20th century. On 26 October 1972 it became a Grade II listed building.

<text>An actinometer is an instrument that can measure the heating power of radiation. Actinometers are used in meteorology to measure solar radiation as pyranometers, pyrheliometers and net radiometers.

An actinometer is a chemical system or physical device which determines the number of
photons in a beam integrally or per unit time. This name is commonly
applied to devices used in the ultraviolet and visible wavelength ranges.
For example, solutions of iron(III) oxalate can be used as a chemical
actinometer, while bolometers, thermopiles, and photodiodes are physical
devices giving a reading that can be correlated to the number of photons
detected.

==History==

Swiss physicist Horace-Bénédict de Saussure invented an early version in the late 18th century. His design used a blackened thermometer enclosed in a glass sphere to measure solar radiation, which he referred to as a &quot;heliothermometer.&quot; This instrument is considered one of the first tools to systematically measure solar intensity.

John Herschel further developed actinometers in the 19th century, including a design involving photochemical reactions to measure sunlight intensity, which was a significant step forward. Herschel&#x27;s actinometer involved observing the rate of a chemical reaction under sunlight, which allowed for more precise quantification of solar energy. Herschel&#x27;s version was influential and helped standardize measurements of solar energy. Herschel introduced the term &quot;actinometer&quot;, the first of many uses of the prefix &quot;actin&quot; for scientific instruments, effects, and processes.

The actinograph is a related device for estimating the actinic power of lighting for photography.

== Chemical actinometry ==

Chemical actinometry involves measuring radiant flux via the yield from a chemical reaction. This process requires a chemical with a known quantum yield and easily analyzed reaction products.

=== Choosing an actinometer ===

Potassium ferrioxalate is commonly used, as it is simple to use and sensitive over a wide range of relevant wavelengths (254 nm to 500 nm). Other actinometers include malachite green Leucocyanidins, vanadium(V)–iron(III) oxalate and monochloroacetic acid, however all of these actinometers undergo dark reactions, that is, they react in the absence of light. This is undesirable since it will have to be corrected for. Organic actinometers like butyrophenone or piperylene are analysed by gas chromatography. Other actinometers are more specific in terms of the range of wavelengths at which quantum yields have been determined. Reinecke&#x27;s salt K[Cr(NH3)2(NCS)4] reacts in the near-UV region although it is thermally unstable. Uranyl oxalate has been used historically but is very toxic and cumbersome to analyze.

Recent investigations into nitrate photolysis
have used 2-nitrobenzaldehyde and benzoic acid as a radical scavenger for hydroxyl radicals produced in the photolysis of hydrogen peroxide and sodium nitrate. However, they originally used ferrioxalate actinometry to calibrate the quantum yields for the hydrogen peroxide photolysis. Radical scavengers proved a viable method of measuring production of hydroxyl radical.

===Chemical actinometry in the visible range===

Meso-diphenylhelianthrene can be used for chemical actinometry in the visible range (400–700 nm). This chemical measures in the 475–610 nm range, but measurements in wider spectral ranges can be done with this chemical if the emission spectrum of the light source is known.

<doc id="1009289" wikidata="Q929202" url="?curid=1009289" title="Firewalking">
<text>Firewalking is the act of walking barefoot over a bed of hot embers or stones. It has been practiced by many people and cultures in many parts of the world, with the earliest known reference dating from Iron Age India . It is often used as a rite of passage, as a test of strength and courage, and in religion as a test of faith.
Modern physics has explained the phenomenon, concluding that the foot does not touch the hot surface long enough to burn and that embers are poor conductors of heat.

==History==
Walking on fire has existed for several thousand years, with records dating back to 1200 BCE. Cultures across the globe use firewalking for rites of healing, initiation, and faith.

Firewalking is also practiced by:
* The Sawau clan on the island of Beqa, to the south of Viti Levu in the Fijian Islands. The phenomenon was examined in 1902 when it was already a tourist attraction, with a &quot;Probable Explanation of the Mystery&quot; arrived at.
* San Pedro Manrique, a village of Soria, Central Spain
* Eastern Orthodox Christians in parts of Greece (see Anastenaria) and Bulgaria (see nestinarstvo), during some popular religious feasts.
* Tribes throughout Polynesia, documented in scientific journals (with pictures and chants) between 1893 and 1953.
* The Pà Thẻn people of Vietnam celebrate the Fire Dancing (or Fire Jumping) Festival, which includes walking, jumping, and dancing over fire and burning embers.

==Persistence and functions==
Social theorists have long argued that the performance of intensely arousing collective events such as firewalking persists because it serves some basic socialising function, such as social cohesion, team building, and so on. Émile Durkheim attributed this effect to the theorized notion of collective effervescence, whereby collective arousal results in a feeling of togetherness and assimilation. A scientific study conducted during a fire-walking ritual at the village of San Pedro Manrique, Spain, showed synchronized heart rate rhythms between performers of the firewalk and non-performing spectators. Notably, levels of synchronicity also depended on social proximity. This research suggests that there is a physiological foundation for collective religious rituals, through the alignment of emotional states, which strengthens group dynamics and forges a common identity amongst participants.

==Physics==

Per the second law of thermodynamics, when two bodies of different temperatures meet, the hotter body will cool off, and the cooler body will heat up, until they are separated or until they meet at a temperature in between. What that temperature is, and how quickly it is reached, depends on the thermodynamic properties of the two bodies. The important properties are temperature, density, specific heat capacity, and thermal conductivity.

The square root of the product of thermal conductivity, density, and specific heat capacity is called thermal effusivity, and determines how much heat energy the body absorbs or releases in a certain amount of time per unit area when its surface is at a certain temperature. Since the heat taken in by the cooler body must be the same as the heat given by the hotter one, the surface temperature must lie closer to the temperature of the body with the greater thermal effusivity. The bodies in question here are human feet (which mainly consist of water) and burning coals.

Due to these properties, David Willey, professor of physics at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, points out that firewalking is explainable in terms of basic physics and is neither supernatural nor paranormal. Willey notes that most fire-walks occur on coals that measure about , but he once recorded someone walking on coals.

Additionally, Jearl Walker has postulated that walking over hot coals with wet feet may insulate the feet due to the Leidenfrost effect.

===Factors that prevent burning===
* Water has a very high specific heat capacity (4.184 J g−1 K−1), whereas embers have a very low one. Therefore, the foot&#x27;s temperature tends to change less than the coal&#x27;s.
* Water also has a high thermal conductivity, and on top of that, the rich blood flow in the foot will carry away the heat and spread it. On the other hand, embers have a poor thermal conductivity, so the hotter body consists only of the parts of the embers which are close to the foot.
* When the embers cool down, their temperature sinks below the flash point, so they stop burning, and no new heat is generated.
* Firewalkers do not spend very much time on the embers, and they keep moving.

===Risks when firewalking===
* People have burned their feet when they remained in the fire for too long, enabling the thermal conductivity of the embers to catch up.
* One is more likely to be burned when running through the embers since running pushes one&#x27;s feet deeper into the embers, resulting in the top of the feet being burnt.
* Foreign objects in the embers may result in burns. Metal is especially dangerous since it has a high thermal conductivity.
* Embers which have not burned long enough can burn feet more quickly. Embers contain water, which increases their heat capacity as well as their thermal conductivity. The water must be evaporated already when the firewalk starts.
* Wet feet can cause embers to cling to them, increasing the exposure time.
A myth that persists is that safe firewalking requires the aid of a supernatural force, strong faith, or an individual&#x27;s ability to focus on &quot;mind over matter&quot;.

Since the 20th century, this practice is often used in corporate and team-building seminars and self-help workshops as a confidence-building exercise.

<text>E. Balanandan (16 June 1924 – 19 January 2009) was an Indian politician and a trade union leader from the Kerala State of India. He had been a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)&#x27;s (CPI(M)) politburo since 1978. Born in Sakthikulangara, Kollam district, he was the son of Kunjiraman Channar and Unnikaali Easwari. His wife Sarojini Balanandan was a former CPI(M) State Committee member.

Balanandan initiated his political career in the Indian National Congress, but he later joined the Communist Party of India in 1943, and then the CPI(M) in 1964. 
When CITU was formed in 1970 he became the first Secretary of the Kerala State Committee and later he was elected as the Treasurer of the all India CITU. He became the all India President of the CITU in 1990 and continued in this position till 2002.

<text>A pyranometer () is a type of actinometer used for measuring solar irradiance on a planar surface and it is designed to measure the solar radiation flux density (W/m2) from the hemisphere above within a wavelength range 0.3 μm to 3 μm.

A typical pyranometer does not require any power to operate. However, recent technical development includes use of electronics in pyranometers, which do require (low) external power (see heat flux sensor).

== Explanation ==

The solar radiation spectrum that reaches Earth&#x27;s surface extends its wavelength approximately from 300 nm to 2800 nm.
Depending on the type of pyranometer used, irradiance measurements with different degrees of spectral sensitivity will be obtained.

To make a measurement of irradiance, it is required by definition that the response to &quot;beam&quot; radiation varies with the cosine of the angle of incidence. This ensures a full response when the solar radiation hits the sensor perpendicularly (normal to the surface, sun at zenith, 0° angle of incidence), zero response when the sun is at the horizon (90° angle of incidence, 90° zenith angle), and 0.5 at a 60° angle of incidence. It follows that a pyranometer should have a so-called &quot;directional response&quot; or &quot;cosine response&quot; that is as close as possible to the ideal cosine characteristic.

== Types ==
Following the definitions noted in the ISO 9060, three types of pyranometer can be recognized and grouped in two different technologies: thermopile technology and silicon semiconductor technology.

The light sensitivity, known as &#x27;spectral response&#x27;, depends on the type of pyranometer. The figure here above shows the spectral responses of the three types of pyranometer in relation to the solar radiation spectrum. The solar radiation spectrum represents the spectrum of sunlight that reaches the Earth&#x27;s surface at sea level, at midday with A.M. (air mass) = 1.5.
The latitude and altitude influence this spectrum. The spectrum is influenced also by aerosol and pollution.

=== Thermopile pyranometers ===
A thermopile pyranometer (also called thermo-electric pyranometer) is a sensor based on thermopiles designed to measure the broad band of the solar radiation flux density from a 180° field of view angle. A thermopile pyranometer thus usually measures from 300 to 2800 nm with a largely flat spectral sensitivity (see the spectral response graph) The first generation of thermopile pyranometers had the active part of the sensor equally divided in black and white sectors. Irradiation was calculated from the differential measure between the temperature of the black sectors, exposed to the sun, and the temperature of the white sectors, sectors not exposed to the sun or better said in the shades.

In all thermopile technology, irradiation is proportional to the difference between the temperature of the sun exposed area and the temperature of the shadow area.

==== Design ====

In order to attain the proper directional and spectral characteristics, a thermopile pyranometer is constructed with the following main components:
* A thermopile sensor with a black coating. It absorbs all solar radiation, has a flat spectrum covering the 300 to 50,000 nanometer range, and has a near-perfect cosine response.
* A glass dome. It limits the spectral response from 300 to 2,800 nanometers (cutting off the part above 2,800 nm), while preserving the 180° field of view. It also shields the thermopile sensor from convection. Many, but not all, first-class and secondary standard pyranometers (see ISO 9060 classification of thermopile pyranometers) include a second glass dome as an additional &quot;radiation shield&quot;, resulting in a better thermal equilibrium between the sensor and inner dome, compared to some single dome models by the same manufacturer. The effect of having a second dome, in these cases, is a strong reduction of instrument offsets. Class A, single dome models, with low zero-offset (+/- 1 W/m2) are available.

In the modern thermopile pyranometers the active (hot) junctions of the thermopile are located beneath the black coating surface and are heated by the radiation absorbed from the black coating. The passive (cold) junctions of the thermopile are fully protected from solar radiation and in thermal contact with the pyranometer housing, which serves as a heat-sink. This prevents any alteration from yellowing or decay when measuring the temperature in the shade, thus impairing the measure of the solar irradiance.

The thermopile generates a small voltage in proportion to the temperature difference between the black coating surface and the instrument housing. This is of the order of 10 μV (microvolts) per W/m2, so on a sunny day the output will be around 10 mV (millivolts). Each pyranometer has a unique sensitivity, unless otherwise equipped with electronics for signal calibration.

==== Usage ====
Thermopile pyranometers are frequently used in meteorology, climatology, climate change research, building engineering physics, photovoltaic systems, and monitoring of photovoltaic power stations.

The solar energy industry, in a 2017 standard, IEC 61724-1:2017, has defined the type and number of pyranometers that should be used depending on the size and category of solar power plant. That norm advises to install thermopile pyranometers horizontally (GHI, Global Horizontal Irradiation), and to install photovoltaic pyranometers in the plane of PV modules (POA, Plane Of Array) to enhance accuracy in Performance Ratio calculation.

To use the data measured by a pyranometer (horizontal or in-plane), quality assessment (QA) of the raw measured data is necessary. This is because the pyranometer measurements typically suffer from environment-induced errors but also handling and neglect errors, such as:

* Pollution of the glass dome (e.g. deposition of atmospheric dust, bird droppings, snowfall), which reduces the measured irradiance
* Issues with positioning, resulting in measurements in a different plane (i.e. not horizontal or in-plane with PV modules) than expected 
* Data logger errors resulting in e.g. static values, oscillations, or data capped to a certain value
* Reflections and shading from the surrounding objects resulting in inaccurate measurements (i.e. not corresponding to solar irradiance)
* Calibration issues of the instrument, leading to measurement errors, offset, or drift over time
* Dew, snow, or frost on the glass dome on lower-end pyranometers not equipped with heating units

Each of the above issues appears as a specific pattern in the measured time series. Thanks to this, the issues can be identified, the erroneous records flagged, and excluded from the dataset. The methods employed for data QA can be either manual, relying on an expert to identify the patterns, or automated, where an algorithm does the job. As many of the patterns are complex, not easily described, and require a particular context, manual QA is very common. A specialist software with suitable tools is required to perform the QA.

After the QA procedure, the remaining ‘clean’ dataset reflects the solar irradiance at the measurement site to within the uncertainty of measurement of the instrument. The ‘clean’ measured dataset can be optionally enhanced with data from a satellite-based solar irradiance model. This data is available globally for a much longer time period (typically decades into the past) than the data measured by the pyranometer. The satellite model data can be correlated (or site adapted) to the pyranometer-measured data to produce a dataset with a long time period of data accurate for the specific site, with a defined uncertainty. Such data can be used to perform bankable solar resource studies or produce Solar potential maps. 

For monitoring of operational PV power plants, pyranometers play an essential role in verifying the solar irradiance available at any given time or over a certain time period. Due to weather variability, redundancy, and the spatial scale of contemporary solar plants (above 100MWp), multiple pyranometers are installed to provide accurate solar irradiation for each section of the PV power plant. IEC 61724-1:2017 international standard for example calls for at least 4 Class A thermopile pyranometers to be installed at 100MWp PV power plant at all times.

Solar measurements that were QA’d could be used to derive Key Performance Indicators (KPI) such as Performance ratio* - metrics used in asset health monitoring or various contractual scenarios relating to energy produced (billing) or asset management (i.e. O&amp;M). In these calculations, the measured sum of in-plane irradiation over a certain period is used as the determinant to which normalized produced PV electricity is compared to. Due to the difficulty of obtaining reliable in-plane measurements, especially in operational power plants, Energy Performance Index is increasingly being used instead of the older Performance ratio metric.

=== Photovoltaic pyranometer – silicon photodiode ===
Also known as a photoelectric pyranometer in the ISO 9060, a photodiode-based pyranometer can detect the portion of the solar spectrum between 400 nm and 1100 nm. The photodiode converts the aforementioned solar spectrum frequencies into current at high speed, thanks to the photoelectric effect. The conversion is influenced by the temperature with a raise in current produced by the raise in temperature (about 0,1% • °C)

==== Design ====

A photodiode-based pyranometer is composed by a housing dome, a photodiode, and a diffuser or optical filters. The photodiode has a small surface area and acts as a sensor. The current generated by the photodiode is proportional to irradiance; an output circuit, such as a transimpedance amplifier, generates a voltage directly proportional to the photocurrent. The output is usually on the order of millivolts, the same order of magnitude as thermopile-type pyranometers.

==== Usage ====
Photodiode-based pyranometers are implemented where the quantity of irradiation of the visible solar spectrum, or of certain portions such as UV, IR or PAR (photosynthetically active radiation), needs to be calculated. This is done by using diodes with specific spectral responses.
Photodiode-based pyranometers are the core of luxmeters used in photography, cinema and lighting technique. Sometimes they are also installed close to modules of photovoltaic systems.

=== Photovoltaic pyranometer – photovoltaic cell ===
Built around the 2000s concurrently with the spread of photovoltaic systems, the photovoltaic pyranometer is an evolution of the photodiode pyranometer. It answered the need for a single reference photovoltaic cell when measuring the power of cell and photovoltaic modules. Specifically, each cell and module is tested through flash tests by their respective manufacturers, and thermopile pyranometers do not possess the adequate speed of response nor the same spectral response of a cell. This would create obvious mismatch when measuring power, which would need to be quantified. In the technical documents, this pyranometer is also known as &quot;reference cell&quot;.

The active part of the sensor is composed of a photovoltaic cell working in near short-circuit condition. As such, the generated current is directly proportionate to the solar radiation hitting the cell in a range between 350 nm and 1150 nm. When invested by a luminous radiation in the mentioned range, it produces current as a consequence of the photovoltaic effect. Its sensitivity is not flat, but it is same as that of Silicon photovoltaic cell. See the Spectral Response graph.

==== Design ====
A photovoltaic pyranometer is essentially assembled with the following parts:
* A metallic container with a fixing staff
* A small photovoltaic cell
* Signal conditioning electronics
Silicon sensors such as the photodiode and the photovoltaic cell vary the output in function of temperature. In the more recent models, the electronics compensate the signal with the temperature, therefore removing the influence of temperature out of the values of solar irradiance. Inside several models, the case houses a board for the amplification and conditioning of the signal.

==== Usage ====

Photovoltaic pyranometers are used in solar simulators and alongside photovoltaic systems for the calculation of photovoltaic module effective power and system performance. Because the spectral response of a photovoltaic pyranometer is similar to that of a photovoltaic module, it may also be used for preliminary diagnosis of malfunction in photovoltaic systems.

Reference PV Cell or Solar Irradiance Sensor may have external inputs ensuring the connection of Module Temperature Sensor, Ambient Temperature Sensor and Wind speed sensor with only one Modbus RTU output connected directly to the Datalogger. These data are suitable for monitoring the Solar PV Plants.

== Standardization and calibration ==
Both thermopile-type and photovoltaic pyranometers are manufactured according to standards.

=== Thermopile pyranometers ===

Thermopile pyranometers follow the ISO 9060 standard, which is also adopted by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). This standard discriminates three classes.

The latest version of ISO 9060, from 2018 uses the following classification: Class A for best performing, followed by Class B and Class C, while the older ISO 9060 standard from 1990 used ambiguous terms as &quot;secondary standard&quot;, &quot;first class&quot; and &quot;second class&quot;.,

Differences in classes are due to a certain number of properties in the sensors: response time, thermal offsets, temperature dependence, directional error, non-stability, non-linearity, spectral selectivity and tilt response. These are all defined in ISO 9060. For a sensor to be classified in a certain category, it needs to fulfill all the minimum requirements for these properties.

‘Fast response’ and ‘spectrally flat’ are two sub-classifications, included in ISO 9060:2018. They help to further distinguish and categorise sensors. To gain the ‘fast response’ classification, the response time for 95% of readings must be less than 0.5 seconds; while ‘spectrally flat’ can apply to sensors with a spectral selectivity of less than 3% in the 0,35 to 1,5 μm spectral range. While most Class A pyranometers are ‘spectrally flat’, sensors in the ‘fast response’ sub-classification are much rarer. Most Class A pyranometers have a response time of 5 seconds or more.

The calibration is typically done having the World Radiometric Reference (WRR) as an absolute reference. It is maintained by PMOD in Davos, Switzerland. In addition to the World Radiometric Reference, there are private laboratories such as ISO-Cal North America who have acquired accreditation for these unique calibrations. For the Class A pyranometer, calibration is done following ASTM G167, ISO 9847 or ISO 9846. Class B and class C pyranometers are usually calibrated according to ASTM E824 and ISO 9847.

=== Photovoltaic pyranometer ===
Photovoltaic pyranometers are standardized and calibrated under IEC 60904-4 for primary reference samples and under IEC 60904-2 for secondary reference samples and the instruments intended for sale.

In both standards, their respective traceability chain starts with the primary standard known as the group of cavity radiometer by the World Radiometric Reference (WRR).

== Signal conditioning ==
The natural output value of these pyranometers does not usually exceed tens of millivolt (mV). It is considered a &quot;weak&quot; signal, and as such, rather vulnerable to electromagnetic interferences, especially where the cable runs across decametrical distances or lies in photovoltaic systems. Thus, these sensors are frequently equipped with signal conditioning electronics, giving an output of 4-20 mA or 0-1 V.

Another solution implies greater immunities to noises, like Modbus over RS-485, suitable for ambiances with electromagnetic interferences typical of medium-large scale photovoltaic power stations, or SDI-12 output, where sensors are part of a low power weather station. The equipped electronics often concur to easy integration in the system&#x27;s SCADA.

Additional information can also be stored in the electronics of the sensor, like calibration history, serial number.

<doc id="1009301" wikidata="Q626235" url="?curid=1009301" title="Harvey Milk High School">
<text>Harvey Milk High School (HMHS) is a public high school in the East Village of Lower Manhattan in New York City designed for, though not limited to, gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender young people, as well as those questioning their sexuality and gender identity. It is named after San Francisco, California, supervisor Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man to be elected to a public office in the United States.

==History==

=== Founding ===
The school was founded in 1985 by the Hetrick-Martin Institute (HMI), which was then known as the Institute for the Protection of Lesbian and Gay Youth. The small program of a little over a dozen students was originally located in the Washington Square United Methodist Church and was run in collaboration with the New York City Board of Education. HMHS was created as an alternative education program for youth who find it difficult or impossible to attend their home schools due to threats, violence, or harassment.

In 2003, HMHS became a fully accredited public school administered by the New York City Department of Education, separate from HMI. The school and the non-profit still share space in the same building, with HMI providing a majority of the school&#x27;s arts and culture programming.

=== Expansion and Controversy ===
HMHS came to national attention in 2002, when the Board of Education authorized a $3.2 million capital expansion of the school as one of its last acts prior to becoming a mayoral agency.

The capital provided by the Board of Education allowed for the renovation of the school building. Enrollment jumped from 50 to 100 students. In 2003 William Salzman, the principal of the school, said it would be &quot;academically challenging&quot;. Michael Long, chairman of the Conservative Party of New York State, was critical, and asked: &quot;Is there a different way to teach homosexuals? Is there gay math? This is wrong... There’s no reason these children should be treated separately.&quot;

Supporters contend that this school is a pragmatic solution, providing an alternative path to a diploma for students who are unable to succeed in a mainstream high school due to intolerance. Not all arguments against the school are divided along partisan lines. Independent mayor Michael Bloomberg supported the renovation of the school while Democratic N.Y. State Senator Rubén Díaz opposed it.

In 2004, the HMHS underwent a 17,000 square foot (1,600 m²) expansion and an increase to eight classrooms and 110 students.

== Support from Hedwig and the Angry Inch ==
In 2015, the producers of the Broadway musical &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; donated over $600,000 from ticket sales to HMI, making it its biggest donation from an organization. Prior to this the musical production has contributed portions of their CD sales of &quot;Wig In A Box: Songs From and Inspired by &quot;Hedwig and The Angry Inch&quot;&quot; starting in 2003, followed by their film entitled &quot;Follow My Voice,&quot; a documentary of Harvey Milk High School and the making of the CD album in 2006.

<doc id="1009303" wikidata="Q28839480" url="?curid=1009303" title="Girdle">
<text>A belt without a buckle, especially if a cord or rope, is called a girdle in various contexts, especially historical ones, where girdles were a very common part of everyday clothing from antiquity until perhaps the 15th century, especially for women. Most girdles were practical pieces of costume to hold other pieces in place, but some were loose and essentially for decoration. Among the elite these might include precious metals and jewels. 

Today, girdles are part of Christian liturgical vestments, and the word is used in other contexts, such as American sports (for what is really a kind of underwear). 

The girdle as an undergarment or abbreviated corset around the waist is a different, essentially 20th-century, concept, but from around 1895 there was a fashion for &quot;girdles&quot; as a separate section of a fashionable dress, worn just above the waist on top of the main dress. It was typically up to about eight inches high, and often terminated in a &quot;V&quot; shape. It might be the same colour as the main dress or not. It differs from the earlier Swiss waist of the mid-19th century by not having lacing or boning. 

==History==

The men among the Greeks and Romans wore the girdle upon the loins, and it served them to confine the tunic, and hold the purse, instead of pockets, which were unknown; girls and women wore it under the bosom. The &quot;Strophium&quot;, &quot;Taenia&quot;, or &quot;Mitra&quot; occurs in many figures. In the small bronze Pallas of the Villa Albani, and in figures on the Hamilton Vases, are three &quot;cordons&quot; with a knot, detached from two ends of the girdle, which is fixed under the bosom. This girdle forms under the breast a knot of ribbon, sometimes in the form of a rose, as occur on the two handsomest daughters of Niobe. Upon the youngest the ends of the girdle pass over the shoulders, and upon the back, as they do upon four Caryatides found at Monte Portio. This part of the dress the ancients called, at least in the time of Isidore, &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;. 

The girdle was omitted by both sexes in mourning. Often when the tunic was very long, and would otherwise be entangled by the feet, it was drawn over the girdle in such a way as to conceal the latter entirely underneath its folds. It is not uncommon to see two girdles of different widths worn together, one very high up, the other very low down, so as to form between the two in the tunic, a puckered interval; but this fashion was mostly applied to short tunics. The tunic of the Greek males was almost always confined by a girdle.

Among the Anglo-Saxons, it was used by both sexes; by the men to confine their tunic, and support the sword. Some were richly embroidered, and of white leather. A leather strap was chiefly worn by monks. Metal girdles were manufactured by girdlers.

==Vestment and iconography==

===Christian usage===
As a Christian liturgical vestment, the girdle is a long, rope-like cord tied around the waist over the alb or cassock. &quot;The Parson&#x27;s Handbook&quot; describes the girdle as being made &quot;generally of white linen rope, and may have a tassel at each end. About 12 ft. 6 in. long is a very convenient size if it is used double, one end being then turned into a noose and the tasselled ends slipped through. The girdle, however, may be coloured.&quot; They are used to close a cassock in Christian denominations, including the Anglican Communion, Catholic Church, Methodist Church and Lutheran Church.

Christian monastics would often hang religious texts, such as the Bible or Breviary, from their girdles and these became known as girdle books. In addition, they would often knot the ends of the girdle thrice, in order to represent the &quot;vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.&quot; As such, within the Christian Church, the girdle, in some contexts, represents chastity and within the Hebrew Bible, &quot;Proverbs 31 provides biblical reference to the ancient practice of girdle making by virtuous chaste women&quot;. In the New Testament, &quot;Christ referred to the girdle as a symbol of preparation and readiness for service ()&quot;:

Saint Paul, in also references the term, stating &quot;Stand therefore, first fastening round you the girdle of truth and putting on the breastplate of uprightness&quot;, further buttressing the concept of the girdle as a symbol of readiness. Many Christian clergy, such as Anglican priests and Methodist ministers, use the following prayer when wearing the girdle:

By the 8th century AD, the girdle became established as a liturgical vestment &quot;in the strict sense of the word.&quot; In 800 AD, the girdle began to be worn by Christian deacons in the Eastern Church.

Although the general word &quot;cincture&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for the girdle, liturgical manuals distinguish between the two, as the &quot;girdle is a long cord or rope while the cincture is a wide sash. Generally an alb is closed with a girdle, an Anglican-style double-breasted cassock is closed with a cincture, and a Roman cassock is closed with either one.&quot;

In the medieval and early modern period there are also accounts of girdles being used as a mnemonic. These would be tied or decorated with bead so that, like a rosary, each notch would remind the wearer of a particular psalm or book. The girdle, in the 8th or 9th century, was said to resemble an ancient Levitical Jewish vestment, and in that era, was not visible. 

The girdle, for men, symbolizes preparation and readiness to serve, and for women, represents chastity and protection; it was also worn by laypersons in the Middle Ages, as attested in literature. For example, the hagiographical account of Saint George and the Dragon mentions the evildoer being tamed with the sign of the cross and a girdle handed to Saint George by a virgin.

===In Judaism===
A gartel is a belt worn by Jewish males, predominantly (but not exclusively) Hasidim, during prayer. &quot;Gartel&quot; is Yiddish for &quot;belt&quot; and is cognate with the English word &quot;girdle&quot;. Gartels are generally very modest in appearance. Most are black, but some gartels are white. Hasidic custom requires that there be a physical divide between the heart and the genitalia during any mention of God&#x27;s name. It is commonly explained that separating the upper and lower parts of the body manifests a control of the animal instincts of the person by the distinctly human intellect.

===Indian religions===
In the Vajrayana iconography of the &quot;Hevajra Tantra&quot;, the &#x27;girdle&#x27; (Tib.: ske rags), one of the &#x27;Five Bone Ornaments&#x27; (aṣṭhiamudrā) symbolizes Amoghasiddhi and the &#x27;accomplishing pristine awareness&#x27; (Kṛty-anuṣṭhāna-jñāna), one of the &#x27;Five Wisdoms&#x27; (pañca-jñāna). The iconography of the girdle (or bone apron and belt ) in Vajrayana iconography developed from one of the items of vestment adorning the Mahasiddha of the charnel grounds.

Beer (1999: p. 318) describes the bone girdle as the &#x27;netted bone apron and belt&#x27; as vesture of the Dakinis and Heruka of the Cham Dance and Gar Dance of Tibetan Buddhism sacred ritual dance performances:

==Girdles in literature and mythology==

Girdles are often portrayed as magical, giving power and strength if worn by men, and protection if worn by women. Several scriptures in the Bible make use of the girdle as a symbol for readiness and preparation.

In Greek mythology, both men and women were described as wearing girdles. Hephaestus gifted his wife Aphrodite with a girdle that made the wearer irresistible to others, which Hera used to seduce Zeus in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. For his ninth labor, Heracles was sent to obtain the girdle of Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons. In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Leucothea gives Odysseus a girdle-like &quot;veil&quot; that allows him to swim for three days straight. 

The Babylonian goddess Ishtar wore a girdle, which, when it was removed, rendered the universe barren. The Norse god Thor&#x27;s girdle Megingjörð doubled his strength.Later, for women, the girdle became a sign of virginity, and was often considered to have magical properties. Monsters and all types of evil are recorded as being subdued by girdles in literature, a famous one being the dragon slain by Saint George. Marriage ceremonies continued this tradition of girdles symbolizing virginity by having the husband take the wife&#x27;s girdle, and prostitutes were forbidden to wear them by law in historic France. Often in literature, women are portrayed as safe from sexual or other attack when wearing a girdle, but suddenly vulnerable if it is missing or stolen.

Non-clothing uses in literature include Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Girdle of Melian&quot;, a magical, protective &quot;wall&quot; surrounding an elven kingdom.

==Sports==
In American football, what is called a girdle is worn under the football player&#x27;s pants to keep the hip, thigh, and tailbone pads in place, making the process of putting on the tight football pants easier. Older girdles resembled chaps, in that they covered only the front of the leg with pads, that snapped on. Modern girdles are essentially a tight pair of compression shorts with pockets for the pads. The girdle was also used in the Mesoamerican ballgame and is used in hockey (National Hockey League).

Some designs are made specifically for use in the sport of ringette.

<doc id="1009305" wikidata="Q764835" url="?curid=1009305" title="Vampire Princess Miyu">
<text>is a Japanese horror manga series by Narumi Kakinouchi and Toshiki Hirano, as well as an anime adaptation by the same creators. The anime was originally adapted as a 4-episode original video animation (OVA) series released in 1988 and licensed by AnimEigo, and later as a 26-episode television series released in 1997 and licensed by Tokyopop and later Maiden Japan.

==Plot==
The series follows Miyu and her Western Shinma companion Larva. The daughter of a human and a Shinma, Miyu was born a vampire and awakened as the Guardian, tasked with hunting down stray Shinma and send them back to the darkness. Before she turns 15, she longs to return to the darkness herself, but not until she has banished the Shinma from Earth and learned who she truly is, as this information has been withheld from her since her awakening.

Most locations in the series are evocative of traditional Japan.

==Characters==
===Main===
: Miyu (OVAs) (Japanese), Pamela Weidner-Houle (English, AnimEigo dub), Annemarie Zola (English, Manga Entertainment dub)
: Miyu (anime) (Japanese), Kimberly J. Brown (English, ep 1–7), Dorothy Elias-Fahn (English, ep 8–26)
: A girl who appears to be around 13 or 15 years old, but is actually much older because she is a vampire. Her origins and personality differ between adaptations: in the OVAs, she is the child of a human father and a vampire mother in post–World War II Japan, while in the anime she is the child of a human mother and a Shinma father, who was the previous Guardian, in pre-World War II Empire of Japan. In the OVAs, Miyu is childish, manipulative, and playful, while in the anime she is more reserved. In both adaptations, Miyu becomes the Guardian, also known as the Watcher, after losing her parents. She has the power to teleport, levitate, open dimensional portals, and attack with fire. Although she is a vampire and must drink blood to survive, Miyu is unharmed by sunlight, holy water, or crucifixes, and her reflection is visible, which may be because she is a dhampir. She chooses her victims carefully since she seemingly cannot take blood from others unless they give it to her willingly. As such, she usually chooses those who have suffered loss and offers them to be with their loved ones in their dreams in exchange for their blood, putting them into an endless state of sleep. Miyu is protective of Larva and is implied to have feelings for him. In the anime, when she disguises herself as a human, she goes by the name .
: Larva (OVAs) 
: Larva (anime) 
: A Western Shinma. In the OVAs, he arrives to kill Miyu and prevent her vampire blood from awakening. However, after he accidentally triggers it and she drinks his blood after he lowers his guard, his face and voice are sealed behind a mask as punishment for his failure. In the anime, Larva confronts Miyu after she becomes the Guardian, but she drinks his blood after he defeats her. In both cases, Larva starts out as an unwilling ally, but later pledges to be by Miyu&#x27;s side because he can sense her sorrow, such as during their blood-bond, and is implied to have feelings for her. Larva can use his nails to attack and, in the anime, also wields a scythe. In the anime and manga, he is able to access Miyu&#x27;s flame powers, but rarely does so, which he states is because it reminds him of his greatest defeat. Unlike in the OVAs, in the anime and manga, Larva can speak and remove his mask. His name is derived from the lemures of Roman mythology, who are also known as larvae; his mask may come from the fact that larvae is Latin for mask.
: Shinmas are demons from another dimension called the darkness who possess the powers of shapeshifting and flight and take advantage of human souls for their own gain, luring them with illusions of their dreams or desires. After escaping into the human world after being sealed in the darkness for thousands of years, it is the job of a Guardian vampire, such as Miyu, to return them to the darkness. While it is implied that they feed on human emotions, there are some instances of Shinma feeding directly on humans, such as Ga-Ryu, who drinks blood, and Koh-Waku, who devours them. Not all Shinma are inherently evil, however. Some use their abilities to interfere with humans for their own purposes, while others help humans by targeting others. Shinma can come from several countries, including Japan and China and their western sides. The kanji for Shinma literally means &quot;god-demon&quot;.

===OVA series characters===
: 
: A cynical, stubborn and knowledgeable spiritualist who meets Miyu during a job in Kyoto. Their paths cross throughout the series as Himiko searches for her, initially convinced that she is a monster with no redeeming qualities, but later changing her mind after learning more about her and Larva. At the end of the fourth OVA, Himiko is shocked to remember that she met Miyu when she was a child. It is implied that she has vampiric traits that have yet to manifest, as she was the first human to exchange blood with Miyu after she became the Guardian.
: 
: Appearing in Episode 1, &quot;Unearthly Kyoto&quot;, he is a boy from Kyoto whom Himiko befriends. His girlfriend, Ryouko, was murdered by a &quot;vampire&quot;, which he did not know was actually a Shinma, and blames himself for being unable to protect her. Because of his grief, he later accepts Miyu&#x27;s offer to exchange their bloods, which Himiko witnesses. At the end of the episode, he is in a catatonic state; Miyu, disguised as a schoolgirl, tells a group of girls not to worry about him since he is happy now.
: Appearing in Episode 1, &quot;Unearthly Kyoto&quot;, she is the only daughter of a rich and traditional family who has been in a coma for 60 days. Her parents call Himiko, believing her to be possessed, which Himiko confirms, but is unable to exorcise the demon and is attacked by a Shinma, but Miyu saves her. Himiko later learns that after Aiko and her parents were injured in a car accident, they donated their blood, which is implied to be hh blood, to save her life, after which she fell into a deep depression and blamed herself for their deaths. The &quot;parents&quot; that called Himiko were either ghosts or Shinmas, so she tries to exorcise Aiko again, and it is revealed that she made a deal with the Shinma that attacked Himiko, letting it roam in exchange for it recreating her former life, including her parents. Before Miyu banishes the Shinma, she tries to bite Aiko like she did to Miyahito, but Himiko interferes and Aiko passes away after the Shinma is banished.
: 
: Appearing in Episode 2, &quot;A Banquet of Marionettes&quot;, she is a Shinma of the second tier who places the essences of her victims into life-size dolls and hides them in a school&#x27;s warehouse so she can drain their life over time. She fell in love with a student of the school, Kei Yuzuki, who Miyu is also interested in. Kei, who has grown tired of his mundane life, wishes to be with Ranka even after finding out that she was using him. Since he voluntarily gave himself to Ranka and she fell in love with him, Miyu is forced to banish them both after she transforms him into a creature like her at his request. In the manga, Ranka is portrayed as an ally of Miyu.
: 
: Appearing in Episode 3, &quot;Fragile Armor&quot;, he is an old friend of Larva who seeks to release him from Miyu. He uses magic as well as a human who became a Shinma, with his soul trapped inside of a samurai armor. Miyu, believing that Lemures has targeted her to become the leader of the Shinma, confronts him with the help of Himiko, but he seals Larva inside a wall. However, Larva breaks Lemures&#x27; spell after his puppet Shinma captures and injures Miyu. Instead of banishing Lemures into darkness, Miyu kills him with fire as punishment for kidnapping and harming Larva.

Lemures also becomes a recurring antagonist in the manga.

===TV series characters===

==Cast==
==Media==
===Manga===
====Original series====
Spread out over ten volumes, this series storywise falls somewhere between the OAV and the television series. In this version, Ranka is the helpful second tier Shinma, but Reiha is largely the same. Most volumes include several stand alone stories regarding Miyu hunting and locating stray Shinma. However, there are several chapters in various volumes relating to the western Shinma. In this version it is Lemures who was Larva&#x27;s companion previous to him coming to Japan. There is also Carlua, who is the daughter of Larva&#x27;s adoptive uncle, Pazusu. Carlua is deeply in love with Larva (as is Lemures) but both fail in their attempts to &quot;rescue&quot; him from Miyu. These result in Lemures being banished to the darkness until after the events of New Vampire Miyu and Carlua being repelled, and her little sister Lilith being incinerated by Miyu. Additionally, there is a human girl named Yuma Koizumi who is introduced in volume 4 who becomes a return antagonist. As a school girl, Yuma was loved and marked by a Shinma named Tsubaki. Tsubaki belongs to a clan of Shinma called &quot;Muma&quot;. When he starts to be hunted, Tsubaki is surprisingly accepting, although sad; at the fact he will be parted from Yuma. However, when Miyu returns him to the dark, Yuma vows vengeance. With the help of Tsubaki&#x27;s companions, Yuma attempts to kill Miyu, knowing Miyu would have difficulty attacking a human foe. The attack ultimately does not succeed and Yuma is left to her misery as Miyu refuses to feed from her (partially out of spite, and out of respect to Tsubaki). In volume 10, it is discovered the Yuma spent the rest of her life pursuing Miyu and her mystery, but is never able to kill her. In the end, Miyu visits Yuma on her death bed, finally drinking her blood.

The manga was licensed for a US release by Studio Ironcat, however, the company went out of business before the series was completed.

====&quot;New Vampire Princess Miyu&quot;====
: titled 新・吸血姫美夕 (&quot;Shin Vanpaia Miyu&quot;) with &quot;Shin&quot; meaning &quot;new&quot;

This series is encompassed in five volumes and covers the actual events that Miyu is given a glimpse of at the end of volume 10 of the original series. It takes place in between the first two volumes of the original series. The Western Shinma, led by Pazusu, and supported by Carlua (his daughter), Lemunia (Lemures&#x27; younger brother), and a powerful young Shinma called Cait Sith. The Western Shinma succeed in kidnapping Larva, purging Miyu&#x27;s blood from him, and sealing his memory of his time with her. This results in a showdown where Larva kills Miyu, although he is not entirely certain why he feels bothered by this. In actuality, Miyu is not quite dead as her spirit survives through her blood that was passed from Yui&#x27;s mom into Yui in utero (see &quot;Vampire Princess Yui&quot; below). Yui is then drawn to Miyu&#x27;s realm to help her be reborn. In the meantime, it&#x27;s discovered that the &quot;rescue mission&quot; was all a ploy by Cait Sith to reach Japan and retrieve a short sword in which his mother&#x27;s spirit is sealed. It is revealed not only was his mother sealed by the Watcher before Miyu, Cait Sith (both are members of a nearly extinct clan called the Quarl) was actually responsible for putting the idea of challenging the Eastern Shinma into Lemures&#x27; and Larva&#x27;s heads originally. As Cait Sith succeeds in resurrecting the queen (though not without a catch and mortally wounding Pazusu), the race is on to get Yui safely to the spot of Miyu&#x27;s rebirth. With the help of the second tier Eastern Shinma and Lemunia, she succeeds and Miyu is brought back to life. After unsealing Larva&#x27;s memories and reestablishing the blood bond, Miyu and the remaining Western Shinma join forces to defeat the Quarl and destroy the Queen. Afterward, Pazusu asks Larva to kill him so he doesn&#x27;t die of his wounds and Carlua makes one last attempt to wrest Larva away from Miyu by threatening to kill him. Miyu calls her bluff and Carlua retreats, thanks to the newly freed Lemures. He explains as they leave that during Miyu&#x27;s time being dead, many stray Shinma (including himself) took advantage of her absence to escape the Darkness once more. The series ends with Miyu and Larva heading off to start rounding these escapees up again.

This series was also licensed by Studio Ironcat for an English-language release, but the company actually completed the series before going out of business.

====&quot;Vampire Princess Yui&quot;====
Yui is the daughter of human and a Shi (another type of demon, also described as anti-Shinma in some English translations). She is also part vampire as Miyu&#x27;s blood runs in her veins, as Miyu fed on her mother while pregnant with Yui. Miyu describes Yui as both her sister, her daughter, and herself. Yui has long dark hair, and looks to be about twelve or thirteen years old. Like Miyu, Yui has a tragic past and friends she had to abandon upon her awakening. Yui has the additional issue of being both hunted and supported by rival factions of Shi, who do not approve of her existence. Also like Miyu, Yui has a blood bonded protector, a younger Shinma named Nagi. Yui&#x27;s personality is much more shy and timid than Miyu&#x27;s, and she is still largely naive about the world at large. Nagi is very hot headed, but is a faithful companion, allowing Yui to feed on him as she refuses to feed on humans. Yui&#x27;s weapon of choice are cherry blossoms, which she can bend to her will in a variety of ways. She passes this power to Miyu upon giving up her own blood for Miyu&#x27;s rebirth.

Another series licensed by Studio Ironcat for an English-language release. Despite publishing the series in full in monthly comic installments, the company only released one collected volume before going out of business.

====&quot;Vampire Yui: Kanonshou&quot;====
The sequel to &quot;Vampire Princess Yui&quot;. A mysterious girl arrives at the door of a church covered in blood, crying out the name &quot;Nagi&quot; before collapsing. The church&#x27;s priest takes in the silent, amnesiac girl, and gently cares for her. Soon, the girl starts to have strange dreams about her past, dreams that name her as the Vampire Princess Yui.

Yui is happy living quietly in the mountain church, surrounded by sakura trees, but this peace cannot last for long. Word from the nearby villagers of vampire attacks in the area confirm that, whether she likes it or not, her past is going to catch up with her!

Another series licensed by Studio Ironcat for an English-language release. Of the eight collected volumes, only one was published before the company went out of business.

====&quot;Vampire Yui: Saishuushou&quot;====
This series is the sequel to &quot;Vampire Yui: Kanonshou&quot;, serving as the &quot;final chapter&quot; of Yui&#x27;s story. The series had two collected volumes that were released in June 2018.

====&quot;Vampire Miyu: Saku&quot;====
This series is about Miyu transferring to a certain middle school. It is described as &quot;one of the earliest stories in the series, and it depicts the encounter and fateful bond between the protagonist Miyu and the vampire Lara,&quot; so it may be a prequel to the original manga. But it is more likely to be a separate continuity.

===Anime===
AnimEigo originally released the OVA series on two VHS tapes in 1992 with separate editions containing English audio and English subtitles, each containing a sheet of liner notes related to the series. The liner notes were eventually redone for the DVD release and included in Volume 1. The Volume 2 DVD contains a card with a humorously worded message stating that the complete liner notes are available in the first volume, and that if some form of insert were not included in the second, consumers would undoubtedly start complaining. In the UK, the series was licensed by Manga UK, who produced an alternate English dub for VHS in the UK (this dub was also shown on the British Sci-Fi Channel). However, AnimEigo&#x27;s dub was used for the UK DVD release.

Tokyopop originally released the TV series to VHS and DVD in 2001–2002. The first DVD volume of their release is notable for only retaining the opening for episode 1 and end credits for episode 3. This practice, which was fairly common in the VHS era of anime releases, apparently received a significant amount of criticism as the remaining five DVDs were released with all episodes featuring the opening and ending credit sequences.

Tokyopop&#x27;s license later expired, and the series was re-licensed by Maiden Japan in 2013, which re-released the series in one box set.

==Reception==
Critical reception of the &quot;Vampire Princess Miyu&quot; OVA series has been generally positive. Anime News Network praised the OVA series for its &quot;dark, surreal tour of the occult&quot;, while it criticizes the dub, saying &quot;the casting was off-center&quot;. Overall, the English dub was given a C− and the subtitled version was given an A−. Raphael See of THEM Anime Reviews gave the OVA series a rating of 4 out of 5 stars, praising the animation, art, action scenes, story, and soundtrack but criticized the backgrounds, saying that they were &quot;a bit on the sketchy side.&quot;

Critical reception of the &quot;Miyu&quot; TV series has also been generally positive. Jeremy A. Beard of THEM Anime Reviews gave the series a rating of 3 out of 5 stars, praising the characters, atmosphere, soundtrack, character and Shinma designs, and the story, but criticized the show for having too much unnecessary filler, stating that &quot;I think that if &quot;Vampire Princess Miyu&quot; was only 13 episodes long, it would have been a better experience overall. The main plot episodes are the most enjoyable and it would not have seriously harmed the show to cut out a lot of the more extraneous Shinma hunts.&quot; Another reviewer from THEM Anime Reviews, Carlos Ross, also gave the &quot;Miyu&quot; TV series a rating of 3 out of 5 stars, praising the story, soundtrack, and voice actors, but noted that the animation was a step down from the OVA series, and criticized the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;-style &quot;Monster-of-the-Day&quot; formula of the series. Overall, Ross concludes that &quot;this is no &quot;Goosebumps&quot; story, folks. This can be really creepy, and it&#x27;s definitely not for the under-twelves.&quot; Cody J. Riebe of &quot;PopMatters&quot; gave the TV series a positive review, praising the story, soundtrack, atmosphere, and animation, with his only criticisms being the series&#x27; first episode and the poor localization by Tokyopop. Riebe also notes that the series never gained any traction in Western regions, stating that &quot;the real tragedy of Vampire Princess Miyu is that one of the more interesting series of the ’90s is out of print and largely reduced to a horror anime footnote.&quot;

Erica Friedman from Okazu in her review of the spin-off manga &quot;Vampire Princess&quot; noted that this part of the series is close enough to the fact that it could be interpreted as yuri, and the relationship between the two main characters as a kind of sexual seduction, also pointing at obvious homoerotism of the image of vampirism in the work. At the same time, reviewing the anime adaptation of the original series, she described the end of the series as &quot;Volume 6 of Vampire Princess Miyu answers a lot of questions. But it answers those questions in the bizarrest and least logical way, for which I give it a lot of credit&quot;, while noting absence of any romantic resolution or even confirmed affection in the work.

<doc id="1009312" wikidata="Q4046157" url="?curid=1009312" title="PCI configuration space">
<text>PCI configuration space is the underlying way that the Conventional PCI, PCI-X and PCI Express perform auto configuration of the cards inserted into their bus.

== Overview ==
PCI devices have a set of registers referred to as &quot;configuration space&quot; and PCI Express introduces &quot;extended configuration space&quot; for devices. Configuration space registers are mapped to memory locations. Device drivers and diagnostic software must have access to the configuration space, and operating systems typically use APIs to allow access to device configuration space. When the operating system does not have access methods defined or APIs for memory mapped configuration space requests, the driver or diagnostic software has the burden to access the configuration space in a manner that is compatible with the operating system&#x27;s underlying access rules. In all systems, device drivers are encouraged to use APIs provided by the operating system to access the configuration space of the device.

== Technical information ==

One of the major improvements the PCI Local Bus had over other I/O architectures was its configuration mechanism. In addition to the normal memory-mapped and I/O port spaces, each device function on the bus has a &quot;configuration space&quot;, which is 256 bytes long, addressable by knowing the eight-bit PCI bus, five-bit device, and three-bit function numbers for the device (commonly referred to as the &quot;BDF&quot; or &quot;B/D/F&quot;, as abbreviated from &quot;bus/device/function&quot;). This allows up to 256 buses, each with up to 32 devices, each supporting eight functions. A single PCI expansion card can respond as a device and must implement at least function number zero. The first 64 bytes of configuration space are standardized; the remainder are available for vendor-defined purposes. Some high-end computers support more than one PCI domain (or PCI segment); each PCI segment supports up to 256 buses. A PCI segment may be referred to a &quot;PCI root bridge&quot;.

In order to allow more parts of configuration space to be standardized without conflicting with existing uses, there can be a list of &quot;capabilities&quot; defined within the remaining 192 bytes of PCI configuration space. Each capability has one byte that describes which capability it is, and one byte to point to the next capability. The number of additional bytes depends on the capability ID. If capabilities are being used, a bit in the &quot;Status&quot; register is set, and a pointer to the first in a linked list of capabilities is provided in the &quot;Cap. pointer&quot; register defined in the Standardized Registers.

PCI-X 2.0 and PCI Express introduced an extended configuration space, up to 4096 bytes. The only standardized part of extended configuration space is the first four bytes at which are the start of an extended capability list. Extended capabilities are very much like normal capabilities except that they can refer to any byte in the extended configuration space (by using 12 bits instead of eight), have a four-bit version number and a 16-bit capability ID. Extended capability IDs overlap with normal capability IDs, but there is no chance of confusion as they are in separate lists.

== Standardized registers ==
The &quot;Device ID (DID)&quot; and &quot;Vendor ID (VID)&quot; registers identify the device (such as an IC), and are commonly called the &quot;PCI ID&quot;. The 16-bit vendor ID is allocated by the PCI-SIG. The 16-bit device ID is then assigned by the vendor. There is an inactive project to collect all known Vendor and Device IDs. (See the external links below.)

The &quot;Status&quot; register is used to report which features are supported and whether certain kinds of errors have occurred. The &quot;Command&quot; register contains a bitmask of features that can be individually enabled and disabled. The &quot;Header Type&quot; register values determine the different layouts of remaining 48 bytes (64-16) of the header, depending on the function of the device. That is, Type 1 headers for Root Complex, switches, and bridges. Then Type 0 for endpoints. The &quot;Cache Line Size&quot; register must be programmed before the device is told it can use the memory-write-and-invalidate transaction. This should normally match the CPU&#x27;s cache line size, but the correct setting is system dependent. This register does not apply to PCI Express.

The &quot;Subsystem ID (SSID)&quot; and the &quot;Subsystem Vendor ID (SVID)&quot; differentiate specific model (such as an add-in card). While the Vendor ID is that of the chipset manufacturer, the Subsystem Vendor ID is that of the card manufacturer. The Subsystem ID is assigned by the subsystem vendor, the Device ID is assigned by the chipset manufacturer. As an example, in the case of wireless network cards, the chip manufacturer might be Intel or Broadcom or Atheros, and the card manufacturer might be Netgear or Hewlett-Packard. Generally, the Vendor ID–Device ID combination designates which driver the host should load in order to handle the device, as all cards with the same VID:DID combination can be handled by the same driver. The Subsystem Vendor ID–Subsystem ID combination identifies the card, which is the kind of information the driver may use to apply a minor card-specific change in its operation.

== Bus enumeration ==
To address a PCI device, it must be enabled by being mapped into the system&#x27;s I/O port address space or memory-mapped address space. The system&#x27;s firmware (e.g. BIOS) or the operating system program the &quot;Base Address Registers&quot; (commonly called BARs) to inform the device of its resources configuration by writing configuration commands to the PCI controller. Because all PCI devices are in an &quot;inactive&quot; state upon system reset, they will have no addresses assigned to them by which the operating system or device drivers can communicate with them. Either the BIOS or the operating system geographically addresses the PCI devices (for example, the first PCI slot, the second PCI slot, the third PCI slot, or the integrated PCI devices, etc., on the motherboard) through the PCI controller using the per slot or per device IDSEL (Initialization Device Select) signals.

When the computer is powered on, the PCI bus(es) and device(s) must be &quot;enumerated&quot; by BIOS or operating system. Bus enumeration is performed by attempting to access the PCI configuration space registers for each buses, devices and functions. Note that device number, different from VID and DID, is merely a device&#x27;s sequential number on that bus. Moreover, after a new bridge is detected, a new bus number is defined, and device enumeration restarts at device number zero.

If no response is received from the device&#x27;s function #0, the bus master performs an abort and returns an all-bits-on value ( in hexadecimal), which is an invalid VID/DID value, thus the BIOS or operating system can tell that the specified combination bus/device_number/function (B/D/F) is not present. So, when a read to a function ID of zero for a given bus/device causes the master (initiator) to abort, it must then be presumed that no working device exists on that bus because devices are required to implement function number zero. In this case, reads to the remaining functions numbers (1–7) are not necessary as they also will not exist.

When a read to a specified B/D/F combination for the vendor ID register succeeds, the system firmware or operating system knows that it exists; it writes all ones to its BARs and reads back the device&#x27;s requested memory size in an encoded form. The design implies that all address space sizes are a power of two and are naturally aligned.

At this point, the BIOS or operating system will program the memory-mapped addresses and I/O port addresses into the device&#x27;s BAR configuration registers. These addresses stay valid as long as the system remains turned on. Upon power-off, these settings are lost and the procedure is repeated next time the system is powered back on. The BIOS or operating system will also program some other registers of the PCI configuration space for each PCI device, e.g. interrupt request. Since this entire process is fully automated, the user is spared the task of configuring any newly added hardware manually by changing DIP switches on the cards themselves. This automatic device discovery and address space assignment is how plug and play is implemented.

If a PCI-to-PCI bridge is found, the system must assign the secondary PCI bus beyond the bridge a bus number other than zero, and then enumerate the devices on that secondary bus. If more PCI bridges are found, the discovery continues recursively until all possible domain/bus/device combinations are scanned.

Each non-bridge PCI device function can implement up to 6 BARs, each of which can respond to different addresses in I/O port and memory-mapped address space. Each BAR describes a region that is between 16 bytes and 2 gigabytes in size, located below the 4 gigabyte address space limit. If a platform supports the &quot;Above 4G&quot; option in system firmware, 64 bit BARs can be used. Resizable BAR (also known as &quot;Re-Size BAR&quot;, AMD &quot;Smart Access Memory&quot; (SAM), or ASRock &quot;Clever Access Memory&quot; (CAM)) is a capability which a PCIe device can use to negotiate a larger BAR size. Classically, BARs were limited to a size of 256MB, but modern graphics cards have framebuffers much larger than that. This mismatch led to inefficiencies when the CPU accessed the framebuffer. Resizable BAR lets a CPU access the whole framebuffer at once, thus improving performance.

A PCI device may also have an &quot;option ROM&quot;.

== Hardware implementation ==
When performing a &quot;Configuration Space&quot; access, a PCI device does not decode the address to determine if it should respond, but instead looks at the &quot;Initialization Device Select&quot; signal (IDSEL). There is a system-wide unique activation method for each IDSEL signal. The PCI device is required to decode only the lowest order 11 bits of the address space (AD[10] to AD[0]) address/data signals, and can ignore decoding the 21 high order A/D signals (AD[31] to AD[11]) because a &quot;Configuration Space&quot; access implementation has each slot&#x27;s IDSEL pin connected to a different high order address/data line AD[11] through AD[31]. The IDSEL signal is a different pin for each PCI device/adapter/slot.

To configure the card in slot &quot;n&quot;, the PCI bus bridge performs a configuration-space access cycle with the PCI device&#x27;s register to be addressed on lines AD[7:2] (AD[1:0] are always zero since registers are double words (32-bits)), and the PCI function number specified on bits AD[10:8], with all higher-order bits zeros except for AD[&quot;n&quot;+11] being used as the IDSEL signal on a given slot/device.

To reduce electrically loading down the timing critical (and thus electrically loading sensitive) AD[] bus, the IDSEL signal on the PCI slot connector is usually connected to its assigned AD[&quot;n&quot;+11] pin through a resistor. This causes the PCI&#x27;s IDSEL signal to reach its active condition more slowly than other PCI bus signals (due to the RC time constant of both the resistor and the IDSEL pin&#x27;s input capacitance). Thus &quot;Configuration Space&quot; accesses are performed more slowly to allow time for the IDSEL signal to reach a valid level.

The scanning on the bus is performed on the Intel platform by accessing two defined standardized ports. These ports are the &quot;Configuration Space Address&quot; () I/O port and &quot;Configuration Space Data&quot; () I/O port. The value written to the &quot;Configuration Space Address&quot; I/O port is created by combining B/D/F values and the registers address value into a 32-bit word.

==Software implementation==
Configuration reads and writes can be initiated from the CPU in two ways: one legacy method via I/O addresses and , and another called memory-mapped configuration.

The legacy method was present in the original PCI, and it is called Configuration Access Mechanism (CAM). It allows for 256 bytes of a device&#x27;s address space to be reached indirectly via two 32-bit registers called PCI CONFIG_ADDRESS and PCI CONFIG_DATA. These registers are at addresses and in the x86 I/O address space. For example, a software driver (firmware, OS kernel or kernel driver) can use these registers to configure a PCI device by writing the address of the device&#x27;s register into CONFIG_ADDRESS, and by putting the data that is supposed to be written to the device into CONFIG_DATA. Since this process requires a write to a register in order to write the device&#x27;s register, it is referred to as &quot;indirection&quot;.

The format of CONFIG_ADDRESS is the following:
0x80000000 | bus « 16 | device « 11 | function « 8 | offset
As explained previously, addressing a device via Bus, Device, and Function (BDF) is also referred to as &quot;addressing a device geographically.&quot; See codice_1 in the Linux kernel code for an example of code that uses geographical addressing.

When extended configuration space is used on some AMD CPUs, the extra bits 11:8 of the offset are written to bits 27:24 of the CONFIG_ADDRESS register:
0x80000000 | (offset &amp; 0xf00) « 16 | bus « 16 | device « 11 | function « 8 | (offset &amp; 0xff)
The second method was created for PCI Express. It is called Enhanced Configuration Access Mechanism (ECAM). It extends device&#x27;s configuration space to 4 KB, with the bottom 256 bytes overlapping the original (legacy) configuration space in PCI. The section of the addressable space is &quot;stolen&quot; so that the accesses from the CPU don&#x27;t go to memory but rather reach a given device in the PCI Express fabric. During system initialization, BIOS determines the base address for this &quot;stolen&quot; address region and communicates it to the root complex and to the operating system.

Each device has its own 4 KB space and each device&#x27;s info is accessible through a simple array codice_2 so that 256 MB of physical contiguous space is &quot;stolen&quot; for this use (256 buses × 32 devices × 8 functions × 4 KB = 256 MB). The base physical address of this array is not specified. For example, on modern x86 systems the ACPI tables contain the necessary information.

<text>A lurcher is a crossbred dog resulting from mating a greyhound or other sighthound with a dog of another type such as a herding dog or a terrier. The lurcher is not a &quot;breed,&quot; but is a generic descriptor of a group of varying dogs. It was for hundreds of years strongly associated with poaching; in modern times, it is kept as a hunting dog or companion dog.

== History ==
&quot;Lurcher&quot; is an old English term for a crossbred dog; specifically, the result of mating a sighthound with a dog of another type, typically a working breed. The term was first used with this meaning in 1668; it is considered to be derived from the verb &quot;lurch&quot;, apparently a variant form of &quot;lurk&quot;, meaning &quot;lurk&quot; or &quot;steal&quot;. The tendency to &quot;wrench&quot; and &quot;cut&quot; rather than &quot;course&quot; was considered to be unfair and a violation of &quot;The Law of the Leash.&quot;

In England from 1389, the right to keep a dog of any kind used in hunting was limited by law to those &quot;qualified&quot; by possessing lands, holdings, or income worth more than ten pounds per annum; in other words, royalty, nobility, the gentry, and the wealthy.
This law, though repeatedly modified, remained in force until 1831. As a result, hunters and poachers bred sighthounds with breeds that could disguise their sighthound bloodline, often under thick rough coats, whilst adding other abilities including intelligence, stamina or turning speed. The dog chosen for this could be an available farm dog, often a collie or terrier. 

In the nineteenth century, the word was used to describe some rough-haired regional greyhounds, which were banned from competition by coursing clubs such as Swaffham and Newmarket, due to the perception that they cut &quot;turns&quot; to kill instead of working the hare to gain points.

== Description ==
A lurcher is a cross, generally between a sighthound and a working dog breed. Generally, the aim of the cross is to produce a sighthound with more intelligence, a canny animal suitable for poaching rabbits, hares, and game birds. Over time, poachers and hunters discovered that the crossing of certain breeds with sighthounds produced a dog better suited to this purpose, given the lurcher&#x27;s combination of speed and intelligence. In more recent times, the crossing of different sighthound breeds with each other (e.g. A greyhound with a saluki) has become more common. These dogs were traditionally called longdogs but these days &quot;lurcher&quot; is applied to them as well.

== Use ==

Lurchers were traditionally bred in England to assist poachers in hunting rabbits and hares. Around the world they are kept as sporting dogs and family pets, or to compete in sports such as lure coursing and dog racing. In the United States they may compete in lure coursing events through the AKC and the UKC. Cross-breeds are not registered and formally recognized by any major kennel club. In North America, the Canadian Kennel Club can deprive individual members of their club rights if they have been proven of crossbreeding any breed as in creating lurchers; in the US lurchers can be registered with the North American Lurcher and Longdog Association.

<doc id="1009315" wikidata="Q2629948" url="?curid=1009315" title="Fanfare for the Common Man">
<text>Fanfare for the Common Man is a musical work by the American composer Aaron Copland. It was written in 1942 for the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra under conductor Eugene Goossens and was inspired in part by a speech made earlier that year by then American Vice President Henry A. Wallace, in which Wallace proclaimed the dawning of the &quot;Century of the Common Man&quot;.

Several alternative versions have been made and fragments of the work have appeared in many subsequent US and British cultural productions, such as in the musical scores of movies.

==Instrumentation==
This fanfare is written for the following instruments:
* four French horns (in F)
* three trumpets (in B)
* three trombones
* tuba
* timpani
* bass drum
* tam-tam

==Fanfare==

Copland, in his autobiography, wrote of the request: &quot;Eugene Goossens, conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, had written to me at the end of August about an idea he wanted to put into action for the 1942–43 concert season. During World War I he had asked British composers for a fanfare to begin each orchestral concert. It had been so successful that he thought to repeat the procedure in World War II with American composers&quot;. A total of 10 fanfares were written at Goossens&#x27; behest, but Copland&#x27;s is the only one which remains in the standard repertoire.

It was written in response to the US entry into World War II and was inspired in part by a famous 1942 speech
where vice president Henry A. Wallace proclaimed the dawning of the &quot;Century of the Common Man&quot;.

Goossens had suggested titles such as &quot;Fanfare for Soldiers&quot;, or sailors or airmen, and he wrote that is my idea to make these fanfares stirring and significant contributions to the war effort...&quot; Copland considered several titles including &quot;Fanfare for a Solemn Ceremony&quot; and &quot;Fanfare for Four Freedoms&quot;; to Goossens&#x27; surprise, however, Copland titled the piece &quot;Fanfare for the Common Man&quot;. Goossens wrote, &quot;Its title is as original as its music, and I think it is so telling that it deserves a special occasion for its performance. If it is agreeable to you, we will premiere it 12 March 1943 at income tax time&quot;. Copland&#x27;s reply was &quot;I [am] all for honoring the common man at income tax time&quot;.

Copland later used the fanfare as the main theme of the fourth movement of his Third Symphony (composed between 1944 and 1946).

==In television and other media==
The theme song for the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine television series that was in syndication during 1993-1999 has much in common with the Fanfare for the Common Man song. 

The Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL have used the Fanfare song as part of a pre-game video introduction of the team before it takes to the ice since moving into the United Center in 1994.

Several feature films employ the piece for dramatic effect. John Williams&#x27; main themes for the 1978 &quot;Superman&quot; film are partially based on the fanfare and his original score for &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; draws heavily on its soundworld (though Copland&#x27;s piece is not actually heard in either movie). In &quot;The Patriot&quot;, which Williams scored, the music of the final scene before the credits may be a nod to Copland&#x27;s work. The fanfare functioned as Jimmy King&#x27;s theme in &quot;Ready to Rumble&quot;. The Bollywood film &quot;Parinda&quot; prominently features the piece as background score, including in a haunting opening depicting shots of Bombay.

The first three notes of the piece are coincidentally the same as the sound made by the motors of the MR-73 class of cars on the Montreal Metro as they leave the station and accelerate.

Seven Network in Australia used &quot;Fanfare&quot; to accompany their &quot;7 Sport&quot; opener throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Additionally, Chris Conroy&#x27;s World of Boats and Chris Conroy&#x27;s Leisureworld both used a rock version of &quot;Fanfare&quot; for their opening credits.

On September 21, 2012, &quot;Fanfare&quot; was played at Los Angeles International Airport as the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; touched down after its final flight.

It featured in BBC Television&#x27;s children&#x27;s television programme, &quot;Melody&quot;, as the second piece to inspire Melody&#x27;s imagination. She imagined a family of elephants enjoying a mud bath.

On May 15, 2014, it was played by the New York Philharmonic at the dedication of the 9/11 Museum in lower Manhattan.

In February 2025, &quot;Fanfare for the Common Man&quot; featured as theme music for the 65th Italian Song Festival.

On September 26, 2015, it was played at Independence Hall in Philadelphia as Pope Francis came outside to make a speech on religious freedom, which he delivered from the lectern used by Abraham Lincoln to deliver the Gettysburg Address.

On October 4, 2017 it was played during the penultimate episode - S04E09 &quot;Search&quot; - of the AMC series &quot;Halt and Catch Fire&quot; as John Bosworth emerged from an appointment with his physician. 

On October 31, 2019, it was played on the roof of Radio24syv&#x27;s headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark, at midnight, when the station stopped broadcasting. The station was closed after eight years, because it controversially failed to get its broadcast license and funding renewed, after a long and windy political process.

The New York Philharmonic&#x27;s version of the work was traditionally played on New Year&#x27;s Eve when the ball was raised at Times Square.

Professional Darts Player Phil &quot;The Power&quot; Taylor used the opening trumpet salutes as part of his walk-up music during his career. The music would then shift to &quot;The Power&quot; by Snap! as the Walkup continued.

==Alternative versions==
Copland&#x27;s fanfare was performed by British prog-rock band Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer on their 1977 album &quot;Works Volume 1&quot;. The track became one of the band&#x27;s biggest hits when an edited version was released as a single that year. It peaked at No. 2 in the UK. Keith Emerson had long been an admirer of Copland&#x27;s Americana style, previously using Copland&#x27;s &quot;Hoedown&quot; on the band&#x27;s &quot;Trilogy&quot; album in 1972.

On their debut album in 1971, rock band Styx recorded a 13-minute, four part song called &quot;Movement for the Common Man&quot;, including Fanfare as the third of its four parts.

Vincent Montana Junior recorded a version for his 1978 album &quot;I Love Music&quot;.

In the 1990s, &quot;Fanfare&quot; began to be used to welcome the winner of the Aintree Grand National Steeplechase from the racecourse to the winner&#x27;s enclosure as the timing of the piece roughly matched the time it took the winner to make the journey. When the enclosure was moved in 2010, &quot;Fanfare&quot; was used instead to announce the procession of competitors from the paddock to the course before the race.

Mannheim Steamroller also has a version on its &quot;American Spirit&quot; album. On August 28, 2010, it was played at the beginning of Glenn Beck&#x27;s Restoring Honor rally.

On January 12, 2011, the piece opened &quot;Together We Thrive: Tucson and America&quot;, the memorial service for the victims of the 2011 Tucson shooting.

<doc id="1009319" wikidata="Q1459851" url="?curid=1009319" title="Hallermann–Streiff syndrome">
<text>Hallermann–Streiff syndrome is a congenital disorder that affects growth, cranial development, hair-growth, and dental development. There are fewer than 200 people with the syndrome worldwide. One notable organization that is supporting people with Hallermann–Streiff syndrome is the Germany-based &quot;Schattenkinder e.V&quot;.

==Presentation==
Patients with this syndrome are shorter than the average person and may not develop hair in many places, including in the facial, leg and pubic areas. Patients also have eye problems including reduced eye size, bilateral cataracts and glaucoma. The syndrome can be associated with sleep apnea. The physical characteristics of the syndrome can result in difficult intubation by medical professionals. Intelligence is usually normal.

==Cause==
The genetic cause of Hallermann–Streiff syndrome has not been conclusively determined. It is most likely due to a &quot;de novo&quot; mutation, and it may be associated with the &quot;GJA1&quot; gene.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is based on the physical characteristics and symptoms. There is no established clinical genetic testing for Hallermann–Streiff syndrome, however some laboratories offer research genetic testing for the condition.

==Treatment==
There is no cure for Hallermann–Streiff syndrome. Treatments center around the particular symptoms in each individual. Early measures are based around ensuring proper breathing and intake of nutrients and may include a tracheostomy. Early surgery for cataracts may be recommended, however some studies have suggested that spontaneous resolution of cataracts occurs in up to 50% of untreated patients. Regular visits to an ophthalmologist to monitor and deal with other eye problems, some of which may require surgery, are strongly recommended.

Management of the condition may also include surgical reconstruction of certain craniofacial malformations (particularly in the mandibular and nasal region) at an appropriate age. Additionally, management for certain heart defects, such as medication or surgery, may be needed.

==History==
It is named after German ophthalmologist Wilhelm Hallermann (1909–2005) and Italian–Swiss ophthalmologist Enrico Bernardo Streiff (1908–1988), who first described the syndrome in 1948 and 1950 respectively.

<doc id="1009349" wikidata="Q7745826" url="?curid=1009349" title="The Last Hurrah">
<text>The Last Hurrah is a 1956 novel written by Edwin O&#x27;Connor. It is considered the most popular of O’Connor&#x27;s works, partly because of a 1958 movie adaptation starring Spencer Tracy. The novel was immediately a bestseller in the United States for 20 weeks, and was also on lists for bestseller of that year. &quot;The Last Hurrah&quot; won the 1955 Atlantic Prize Novel award, and was highlighted by the Book-of-the-Month Club and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. &quot;The Last Hurrah&quot; received very positive critical reviews, including an &quot;ecstatic&quot; one from the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The plot of &quot;The Last Hurrah&quot; focuses on a mayoral election in an unnamed East Coast city. Veteran Irish, Democratic Party politician Frank Skeffington is running for yet another term as mayor. As a former governor, he is usually called by the honorific title &quot;Governor.&quot; While the city is never named, it is frequently assumed to be Boston. Skeffington is assumed to represent Boston Mayor and Massachusetts Governor James Michael Curley. The story is told in the third person, either by a narrator or by Adam Caulfield, the mayor&#x27;s nephew. Skeffington is a veteran and adept &quot;machine&quot; politician, and probably corrupt as well. The novel portrays him as a flawed great man with many achievements to his credit.

At the beginning of the book, Skeffington is 72 and has been giving signs that he might consider retiring from public life at the end of his current term. He surprises many by announcing what he had always intended to do: run for another term as mayor. The main body of the novel gives a detailed and insightful view of urban politics, tracking Skeffington and his nephew through rounds of campaign appearances and events, thereby showcasing a dying brand of politics and painting a broad picture of political life in general. His opponent, Kevin McCluskey, is a neophyte candidate with a handsome face and good manners, a good World War II record but no political experience, and no real abilities for politics or governing. However, McCluskey gets support from a new campaign medium: television advertising. Surprisingly, McClusky defeats Skeffington on election day.

One of Adam&#x27;s friends explains that the election was &quot;a last hurrah&quot; for the kind of old-style machine politics that Skeffington had mastered. Developments in American public life, including the consequences of the New Deal, have so changed the face of city politics that Skeffington no longer can survive in the new age with younger voters. Also, prophetically, for the first time, television ads win the day.

Immediately after his defeat, Skeffington suffers a massive heart attack and another soon afterward. When he dies, he leaves behind a city in mourning for a pivotal figure in its history but no longer with room for either him or his kind.

== Characters ==
*Frank Skeffington is the mayor of an unnamed city as well as that state&#x27;s former governor. It is commonly accepted that the character of Skeffington is based on James Michael Curley, Mayor of Boston 1914-1918, 1922–1926, 1930–1934 and 1946–1950, and Governor of Massachusetts 1935-1937. At the end of his fourth term as Mayor in 1949, aged 74, Curley ran for re-election but was defeated by John Hynes.
*Frank Skeffington, Jr. is the son of the mayor. He is a disappointment to his father because he has no ambition and seems to be interested only in dancing and socializing.
*Adam Caulfield is Frank Skeffington&#x27;s nephew and a cartoonist for a local newspaper, where he draws a comic strip that he created, &quot;Little Simp.&quot; He is 33 years old.
*Maeve Caulfield is the wife of Adam Caulfield; she is 22. Her views of Frank Skeffington evolve in the course of the book; but they begin as dislike and suspicion of him, due to her upbringing.
*Roger Sugrue, Maeve&#x27;s father, is a bitter critic of Frank Skeffington. His views have shaped his daughter&#x27;s views.
*Amos Force is the publisher of the leading newspaper and a member of the city&#x27;s Protestant old- money elite. For personal, political, and family reasons, as well as anti-Irish bigotry, Force loathes Skeffington and is committed to seeing him lose his latest campaign for Mayor.
*Sam Weinberg, one of Skeffington&#x27;s inner circle, is Jewish and a shrewd political observer. He is worried about Skeffington&#x27;s chances for re-election.
*John Gorman, another of Skeffington&#x27;s advisers, is a senior ward boss and a master politician. He is torn between his faith in Skeffington and his cold-eyed political realism.
*Ditto Boland is an obsequious but not very bright supporter of Skeffington. Like many of Skeffington&#x27;s acolytes, he does his best to mimic his hero&#x27;s dress, manner of speaking, and personality. He has so few views of his own that he has won the nickname &quot;Ditto&quot; from Skeffington, a nickname that he accepts with pride because his hero has conferred it. Nobody remembers his real first name any longer, and even he seems not to use it. The character is likely based on John (Up-Up) Kelly, an advance man for Curley who earned his nickname by entering rallies ahead of Curley yelling &quot;Up, up, everybody up for the Governor.&quot;
*The Cardinal is a cardinal in the Roman Catholic Church. He and Skeffington grew up together on the same slum street but he has become a bitter opponent of Skeffington, believing that he has disgraced his religion, his fellow Irish, and his office.
*Kevin McCluskey is Skeffington&#x27;s political opponent, a young and handsome veteran of World War II with virtually no political experience.

== Major themes ==
===Relation to Curley===
The similarities between Skeffington and Boston Mayor James Michael Curley are many. Skeffington&#x27;s age and background, his worship of his dead wife, his layabout son, his antagonistic relations with the members of his city&#x27;s Protestant upper class, as well as his eventual defeat by a much younger candidate are all features of Curley&#x27;s life and the conclusion they are one and the same seems obvious. Author Edwin O&#x27;Connor, however, always denied this. The city of the novel is never named; but it is certainly implied that it is supposed to represent Boston (O&#x27;Connor also lived for a period in Boston).

When a Boston newspaper asked Curley to review the novel he refused and said, &quot;The matter is in the hands of my attorneys.&quot; When he saw that the roguish Skeffington charmed readers the former mayor began praising the novel, however, including in person to O&#x27;Connor. In a lecture at the University of New Hampshire on the book, Curley treated &quot;The Last Hurrah&quot; as a &quot;de facto&quot; biography of himself and discussed things that he believed the novel had unfairly omitted.

===Changing politics===
&quot;The Last Hurrah&quot; tells the story of the end of an era of American politics characterized by the &quot;big-city politician&quot; as exemplified by Frank Skeffington. In the novel, Skeffington lost because of the changing times during which the national government began to aid people in a way that only locals had before. The New Deal and its constituent laws implemented systems whereby the national government would &quot;dispense money, jobs, health care, and housing.&quot; Franklin D. Roosevelt, initiator of the New Deal, &quot;[substituted] government social welfare programs for the corrupt ward heeler&#x27;s ill-gotten private dole and power source.&quot;
 This shift meant a new standard of accountability by which mayoral candidates would be measured.

Some scholars disagree with the above assertions, arguing that several city mayors have benefited from the aid that New Deal agencies gave to their constituents. They may also cite that Roosevelt himself endeavored to strengthen ties to local politics before the Hatch Act stopped him.

Another major theme, perhaps the most important one in hindsight, is the role of outrageous television ads. The McCluskey ad that helps him win shows his family in a provocative pose that &quot;wins the grandmothers.&quot; &quot;The Last Hurrah&quot; was the first major novel to depict the development in political campaigns.

==Influence==
Along with &quot;&quot; (1880), &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; (1946), and &quot;Advise and Consent&quot; (1959), &quot;The Last Hurrah&quot; is among the more successful novels about American politics.

The title &#x27;&quot;The Last Hurrah&quot; drew on a common phrase in the English lexicon to mean a swan song or, in politics, the last campaign of a politician.

The success of the novel and Tracy&#x27;s portrayal of the Curley proxy &quot;Skeffington&quot; in the film adaptation as rambunctious but heroic improved the public image the ex-mayor, who was no longer in office by 1956. In addition to giving him new publicity, Curley sued the film&#x27;s producers and won $46,000. He is now looked upon by some with nostalgia, partly because of the book and the film.

==Adaptations==

John Ford directed the adaptation. The cast included many fellow Irish-Americans and members of Ford&#x27;s informal &quot;stock company&quot;, including Spencer Tracy, Pat O&#x27;Brien, James Gleason, Frank McHugh, Wallace Ford, and Willis Bouchey. Columbia Pictures bought the rights to make this movie from O&#x27;Connor for $150,000.

===Other===
In addition to the 1958 movie, there was a made-for-TV 1977 version, starring Carroll O&#x27;Connor produced for the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; series of specials, with Terry Becker as executive producer. There was a 1999 staging for the Huntington Theatre Company in Boston by Eric Simonson. In addition, a two-act musical was written and produced at Northwestern University.

<doc id="1009369" wikidata="Q3285658" url="?curid=1009369" title="Boccia">
<text>Boccia ( ) is a precision ball sport, similar to bocce, and related to bowls and pétanque. The name &quot;boccia&quot; is derived from the Latin word for &quot;boss&quot; – &quot;&quot;. The sport is contested at local, national and international levels, by athletes with severe physical disabilities. It was originally designed to be played by people with cerebral palsy but now includes athletes with other severe disabilities affecting motor skills. In 1984, it became a Paralympic sport and as of 2020, 75 boccia national organizations have joined one or more of the international organizations. Boccia is governed by the Boccia International Sports Federation (BISFed) and is one of two Paralympic sports (along with goalball) that have no counterpart in the Olympic program, although it is a Paralympic variant of bocce (boules).

==About the game==
Boccia can be played by individuals, pairs, or teams of three. Until 2024, all events were mixed gender. The aim of the game is to throw leather balls — coloured red or blue (which side uses which is determined by a coin toss) as close as they can to a white target ball, or jack. The jack is thrown first, then the first two regular balls are played (first, the player who threw the jack then the opposing side), after which the side furthest away from the jack goes next in an attempt to either get closer to the jack or knock the opposition&#x27;s ball out of the way. In this fashion, each round, or end, will continue until one side has played all their balls, at which point, the opposing side will play their remaining balls. The balls can be moved with hands, feet, or, if the competitor&#x27;s disability is severe, with an assistive device such as a ramp. At the end of each end, the referee measures the distance of the balls closest to the jack, and awards points accordingly — one point for each ball that is closer to the jack than the opponent&#x27;s closest ball. The team/player with the highest number of points at the end of play is the winner. If both teams have the same number of points after all ends have been played, one additional end is played to determine a winner.

The number of ends and balls in each end depends on the side makeup. Individual competition consists of four ends and six balls per player per end, whilst paired competition is four ends and six balls per pair per end (three per player). Team competition is six ends, and six balls per team per end (two per player).

In pair and team events, a reserve player is allowed. Between ends a reserve can be substituted for a player during a game, but only one substitution per game is permitted.

Boccia is played on a court measuring with of empty, in-bounds, playable space around it. The surface of the court is flat and smooth—typically a converted wooden basketball and/or volleyball court but sometimes a hard turf surface flooring. The throwing area is divided into six rectangular throwing boxes in which the athletes must stay completely within during play. On the court is a V-shaped line over which the jack must cross for the throw to be valid. At the end of the court is the ‘dead ball container’ in which balls are put if they are thrown outside the time limit, out of the area of play or if the athlete violates a rule during his or her throw. A cross marks the position where the jack must be placed if it touches or crosses the boundary line or in the case of a tie-break. The balls themselves are made of leather and are slightly larger than a tennis ball, weighing approximately and measuring around in circumference (about diameter). They are available in different grades of softness and hardness and are selected purposefully to execute desired strategies within a match.

==Classification==
To be eligible to compete in boccia at national or international level, athletes must have a disability and be in a wheelchair, as a result of cerebral palsy, or another neurological condition that has similar effects, such as muscular dystrophy or traumatic brain injury. Players are examined to determine the extent of their disability and then assigned to a sport class, designed to allow them to compete against other athletes with a similar level of physical function. As of 2022 there was a split between male and female categories which created 4 more classifications and changed the team and pair events into mixed gender pairs and teams needing at least 1 female athlete.

Boccia players are assigned to one of eight sport classes, depending on their gender (M denotes male events, F denotes female events) and functional ability:

* &lt;section begin=BC1def /&gt;BC1M/F – Players in this class throw the ball with the hand or foot. They may compete with an assistant who stays outside the competitor&#x27;s playing box, to stabilize or adjust their playing chair and give the ball to the player when requested.&lt;section end=BC1def /&gt;
* &lt;section begin=BC2def /&gt;BC2M/F – Players in this class throw the ball with the hand. They are not eligible for assistance.&lt;section end=BC2def /&gt;
* &lt;section begin=BC3def /&gt;BC3M/F – Players in this class have very severe locomotor dysfunction in all four extremities. Players in this class have no sustained grasp or release action and although they may have arm movement, they have insufficient range of movement to propel a boccia ball onto the court. They may use an assistive device such as a ramp to deliver the ball. They may compete using an assistant; assistants must keep their back to the court and their eyes averted from play.&lt;section end=BC3def /&gt;
* &lt;section begin=BC4def /&gt;BC4M/F – Players in this class have severe locomotor dysfunction of all four extremities as well as poor trunk control. They can demonstrate sufficient dexterity to throw the ball onto the court. Players are not eligible for assistance.&lt;section end=BC4def /&gt;

==Competition==
Boccia can be played on a recreational and/or competitive basis. Competitions are organized locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally. The international competition calendar is based on the Summer Paralympic Games quadrennial, with international regional championships in the first year, world championships in the second year, world cup in the third year, and the Paralympic games in the fourth year.

There are approximately 554 internationally ranked boccia players.

179 athletes from 24 countries and regions attended the 2007 Boccia World Cup (May 9–19, 2007 in Vancouver, BC, Canada) for their last opportunity for classification and achieve international ranking for the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing.

88 athletes from 19 countries competed at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing held 7 to 17 September. Brazil and Korea were ranked first equal over all, both countries finishing with two gold medals and one bronze medal each.

Athletes from 36 countries attended the 2010 Boccia World Championships, and 28 countries participated in the team competition. The balance of power in recent years has shifted from European dominance to a more worldwide competitiveness with Brazil leading the BC4s and Korea the BC3s. The dominant force of the Mixed Team has only recently changed hands from GB to Korea but the former power houses Spain and Portugal can never be ruled out.

116 Athletes from 25 countries competed in the 2020 Summer Paralympics. The medal table was dominated by European and Asian countries with Slovakia, Thailand and Japan making up the top 3 in the medal table. The hosts had a largely successful event by claiming 3 medals in total with a gold medal for Hidetaka Sugimura in the BC2 Classification. Slovakia dominated the BC4 individual and pairs tournament with athletes Samuel Andrejčík who won gold in the individual event and Michaela Balcová who joined him to win gold in the pairs event. David Smith OBE added to his impressive medal tally to win his third gold medal by retaining the individual paralympic BC1 title. In the BC3 class Adam Peška claimed gold in his debut appearance at the Paralympics.

<text>The KW-37, code named JASON, was an encryption system developed In the 1950s by the U.S. National Security Agency to protect fleet broadcasts of the U.S. Navy. Naval doctrine calls for warships at sea to maintain radio silence to the maximum extent possible to prevent ships from being located by potential adversaries using radio direction finding. To allow ships to receive messages and orders, the navy broadcast a continuous stream of information, originally in Morse code and later using radioteletype. Messages were included in this stream as needed and could be for individual ships, battle groups or the fleet as a whole. Each ship&#x27;s radio room would monitor the broadcast and decode and forward those messages directed at her to the appropriate officer. 
The KW-37 was designed to automate this process. It consisted of two major components, the KWR-37 receive unit and the KWT-37 transmit unit. Each ship had a complement of KWR-37 receivers (usually at least two) that decrypted the fleet broadcast and fed the output to teleprinter machines. KWT-37&#x27;s were typically located at shore facilities, where high power transmitters were located. 

The KWR-37 weighed 100 pounds (45 kg) and contained some 500 subminiature vacuum tubes, whose leads were soldered to printed circuit boards. Each flip-flop in the KW-37 required three tubes, placing an upper bound on the total number of stages in any shift registers used at 166. Squeezing so much logic in such a small and rugged package was quite a feat in the 1950s. 

Each KWT-37 filled an entire relay rack with five stacked modules. A precision time reference occupied the bottom, three key generators (stream cyphers in civilian parlance) occupied the middle and an alarm panel occupied the top position. The outputs of the three key generators were combined in a voting circuit. If one of the units&#x27; output did not match the other two, an alarm was sounded and the output from the two units that did agree continued to be used.

Each KWR-37 and each key generator in the KWT-37 had a common fill device (CFD) for loading keys (or as NSA calls them cryptovariables). The CFDs were similar to that first used in the KW-26, accepting punched cards in Remington Rand format. The key was changed every day at 0000 hours GMT. The receivers were synchronized to the transmitter at that time. If a receiver ever got out of sync, say due to a power failure, an operator had to set the current hour and minute on dials on the front panel. The KWR-37 would then &quot;fast forward&quot; through its key stream sequence until synchronization was re-established.

Large numbers of fleet broadcast key cards had to be produced and distributed to every navy ship and many shore installations on a monthly basis, so many people had access to them. While the key cards were strictly accounted for, they were easy to copy. This proved to be a fatal weakness.

KWR-37s fell into North Korean hands when the USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; was captured in 1968. New keying material was issued to ships throughout the world to limit the ongoing damage. In 1985 it was revealed that the Walker spy ring had been selling key lists and cards to the Soviet Union for decades. KW-37 systems were taken out of service by the early 1990s.

The received input to the KW(R)-37 was in the form of a multiple broadcast (multicast) signal, consisting of many channels condensed into one tone pack which was deciphered at one stage by the KW(R)-37 and then the output was sent to several KG-14&#x27;s which further deciphered the then split signals into each channel of the fleet broadcast. The KG-14 also received its timing signal from the KW(R)-37; if the 37 was out of sync, all the 14&#x27;s were fall out of sync as well. Each KG-14 could process one channel of the tone pack; most fleet units had six KG-14&#x27;s, larger units even more.

==Experiences operating the KWR-37==

Typically, fleet units utilizing the KWR-37 units were outfitted with two devices for redundancy. Should one unit fail, the other one would already be online and patches via a high level, 60-milliamp patch panel would quickly be changed around so that the current offline unit could be changed over to online status at a moment&#x27;s notice, to ensure that there was no interruption of message traffic. Later in their life, when KWR-37 units were aged and worn, sometimes the circuit cards inside had to be reseated with a rubber mallet which helped ensure the cards were seated properly. Other problems with the KWR-37&#x27;s were related to the startup times. Fleet radiomen, and those stationed in the shore transmitting stations, had to listen to an HF signal for coordinated universal time. Radiomen called this broadcast the &quot;time tick,&quot; which gave them a sharp tone, signalling them to press the restart button so that the unit could then start up for &quot;new day&quot; or otherwise known as &quot;HJ&#x27;s&quot; by the radiomen. This took place after the new day&#x27;s crypto keylist card was properly inserted into the &quot;crib&quot; or the card reader by securing it onto pins and then firmly closing the card access door and then locking it with a key. Once the unit(s) were restarted, the key was placed back in the safe using two-person integrity (TPI) which was stringently enforced following the Walker spy investigation. In the early nineties when the KWR-37 units were retired from the navy and replaced by the more reliable and modern KWR-46&#x27;s, fleet Radiomen breathed a sigh of relief because the KWR-37 units were often unreliable and would occasionally fall out of synchronization timing, resulting in a loss of broadcast messages from the various fleet channels.

<text>The Historical Society of Washington, D.C., also called the DC History Center, is an educational foundation dedicated to preserving and displaying the history of Washington, D.C. The society provides lectures, exhibits, classes, and community events. It runs a museum, library, and publishes the journal &quot;Washington History&quot;. It had been named The Columbia Historical Society from its founding in 1894 until 1988.

The society&#x27;s home is the Carnegie Library of Washington D.C., a Beaux-Arts building in the center of Mount Vernon Square in Washington. It was built in 1902 to be District of Columbia Public Library, one of the many Carnegie libraries. The building is open to the public from Monday through Sunday 10am to 5pm. Visitors can tour the exhibits and use the society&#x27;s Kiplinger Research Library, which has books, maps, photographs, and other materials relevant to the history of the city.

==&quot;Washington History&quot;==
The society publishes a peer-reviewed academic journal &quot;Washington History&quot;, generally twice a year. The editorial board includes George Derek Musgrove, Chris Myers Asch, and Jane Freundel Levey.

The journal&#x27;s predecessor was the original &quot;Records of the Columbia Historical Society&quot;, which was published from 1894 to 1989. In the society&#x27;s early years, membership dues went largely to support the publication of the &quot;Records&quot;. These hard-bound volumes appeared every year until 1922, and thereafter every two or three years.

==History==
The Columbia Historical Society was founded in 1894 by a group of 36 men and women, with the following mission: &quot;Its objects shall be the collection, preservation, and diffusion of knowledge respecting the history and topography of the District of Columbia and national history and biography.&quot; The organization had as its goal &quot;collecting the scattered and rapidly disappearing records of events and individuals prominent in the history of the city and District.&quot; The main role of the early society was to serve as a forum for members to present historical research, which was then published in the &quot;Records of the Columbia Historical Society&quot;. The organization also amassed library and manuscript collections.

By 1899, the new organization had 108 members. Of these, 95 were men, and 101 were residents of Northwest Washington. Although African Americans constituted one-third of the then-racially segregated city&#x27;s population, the membership of the Columbia Historical Society was all white.

The growth of the collections presented difficulties. For more than 50 years, the society used rented and donated rooms to house its offices and library. Volunteers served as librarians and curators. In the late 1940s, a bill to finance reassembly of Francis Scott Key&#x27;s home and give it to the society was passed by Congress, but President Harry Truman vetoed it for budgetary reasons. A professional appointed in 1947 promulgated a collecting policy and created the first catalog.

In 1954, the District of Columbia Public Library, which had been storing the society&#x27;s collections, threatened to evict them because of its own space problems. The society&#x27;s board of trustees appealed to the membership for a home. In 1955, Amelia Keyser Heurich, widow of prominent Washington brewer Christian Heurich, donated the family&#x27;s four-story mansion near Dupont Circle, which became the society&#x27;s headquarters. The society took possession of the mansion the following year after Mrs. Heurich died.

The society hired its first director in 1959, although the office of the board of trustees&#x27; president, Ulysses S. Grant III, who served from 1952 to 1968, still performed most of the society&#x27;s work. For many years the house chairman lived on the third floor and rented offices in the building to other historical and patriotic organizations. Space was available for a library in the mansion, which housed the book, manuscript, photograph and other collections.

In 1975, a real estate transaction produced a significant endowment, which was used to hire the first full-time, professional historian as executive director, Perry Fisher. Fisher used the interest in the nation&#x27;s past stimulated by the U.S. Bicentennial to increase the society&#x27;s programs and membership.

In 1989, the society was renamed the Historical Society of Washington, D.C. and relaunched its magazine &quot;Records&quot; as the journal &quot;Washington History&quot;.

In 1998, Monica Scott Beckham, vice president of the society&#x27;s board of trustees, went before a subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations to seek federal funding for a City Museum of Washington, D.C. Congress appropriated $2 million in 1999 &quot;provided that the District of Columbia shall lease the Carnegie Library at Mount Vernon Square to the Society ... for 99 years at $1 per year&quot;. On July 14, 1999, District Mayor Anthony A. Williams announced the creation of the City Museum of Washington, D.C. in the Carnegie Library. The City Museum opened in May 2003, but closed in November 2004 because of a lack of funding and interest.

In 2006, the society and the National Music Center entered into an agreement that permitted the Music Center to occupy a substantial portion of the Carnegie Library for three years.

The Carnegie Library houses the society&#x27;s research library, rotating exhibits, and offices. Ninety percent of the society&#x27;s historic collections, which include artworks, documents, maps, objects, and over 100,000 photographs, are stored on-site. A permanent exhibition, &quot;Window to Washington&quot;, now traces the development of the District&#x27;s built environment and serves as an introduction to the society&#x27;s collections. The society also provides research workshops to students and community groups, including D.C. Public Charter Schools and universities.

In 2017, the Historical Society moved to a temporary location to facilitate renovation of the Carnegie Library Building. The renovated building reopened on May 11, 2019. The Historical Society now shares space in the building with an Apple Store.

<text>The Dire Wraiths are a fictional extraterrestrial species appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics and IDW Publishing. The Dire Wraiths are the main opponents of Rom the Spaceknight.

==Publication history==
The Dire Wraiths first appeared in &quot;Rom&quot; #1 (1979) and were created by Bill Mantlo and Al Milgrom. Parker Brothers created the term Dire Wraiths to promote the original ROM toy, but Marvel developed all of the backstory and art behind them. Hasbro has since taken over ownership and trademarked the name. IDW Publishing developed a new appearance and backstory distinct from what had been previously created by Marvel, who still owns those aspects.

==Fictional species biography==
===Marvel Universe===
The Dire Wraiths are an evolutionary offshoot of the Skrulls from the Andromeda Galaxy. Like the Skrulls, the Wraiths are shapeshifters, able to take the forms of other creatures. The Wraiths were originally depicted as amorphous, cloudy, vaguely humanoid-shaped beings, but was eventually revealed that it was a transitional form used for shapeshifting and that their true form is entirely different. The Dire Wraiths are Skrullian Deviants engineered by the starfaring Celestials. The Wraiths have both reptilian and mammal-like traits. The females lay eggs and lactate.

In-universe, most characters consider Wraiths to be sexually dimorphic, but it is stated within the comics that all Wraiths actually have the same form, but the males are so ashamed of their true form that they use their shapeshifting abilities to constantly appear in their transitory forms. The basic transitory form is stocky and troll-like in appearance, with red or brown skin, but otherwise roughly human-like in size and shape. The true form has an obese, reddish body with large, pupil-less eyes, small beaks, &#x27;hands&#x27; that resemble small pincers and tentacles; clawed feet, and thick tails. They also have long, drill-like tongues, that they use to suck out the brains of their victims, allowing them to gain their memories. All Wraiths can copy the appearance of other beings without consuming their brains or killing them.

Wraiths turned into dust when killed (or banished to Limbo).

====In-universe origins====
At some point in their history, female Dire Wraiths began to study evil magic. This caused a rift with their parent race, the Skrulls, and they were driven out of the Andromeda Galaxy. They settled on the planet Wraithworld.

====The Dark Nebula====
Two hundred years before the events of the main comic strip, the Dire Wraiths launched an offensive on Galador and the galaxy in which it was located. However, upon arriving at Galador they found out that hundreds of young Galadorians had been transformed into cyborg warriors called Spaceknights, who repelled the attack. The Dire Wraiths returned to Wraithworld, only to have Rom, the greatest of the Spaceknights, follow them there, intent on wiping them from the universe. Realizing that other Spaceknights would soon follow, the Wraiths decided to abandon Wraithworld, and scattered across the universe.

====Wraiths on Earth====
Several decades prior to Rom&#x27;s arrival on Earth, a large group of Wraiths landed near a small town in West Virginia. The Wraiths infiltrated the town in human form, and later, began to infiltrate governments and other important organizations across the world. Because Dire Wraith magic was fueled by the black sun of Wraithworld in the Dark Nebula, their ability to perform magic on Earth was severely crippled. Consequently, the male-dominated technology faction of the Wraiths was in control.

Later, Rom landed near Clairton, having detected a Wraith infestation, and with the help of some of the locals, eventually succeeded in banishing all the Wraiths there. Then he proceeded to travel around the world, looking for the rest, eventually leaving the protection of Clairton to the human superhero, the Torpedo.

Eventually, the female-dominated faction of magically-oriented Wraiths, blaming the technology faction for failing to defeat Rom, launched a coup and then proceeded to attack the Earth openly. Their first act was to kill the entire population of Clairton while Rom was away. Later, they then openly attacked S.H.I.E.L.D. at their headquarters, the Helicarrier. This proved a major blunder in that the personnel were able to repel the attack and all doubt by the authorities as to the existence and threat of the alien species was removed.

Soon afterwards, the Wraiths launched a plan to help them conquer Earth once and for all; they cast a spell on Earth&#x27;s Sun, allowing them to use its energies to draw Wraithworld into Earth&#x27;s Solar System. This greatly increased their magical powers. Emboldened, the Wraiths made a mass attack on New York City, where they clashed with dozens of the city&#x27;s superheroes. However, thanks to Rom, who used a special satellite to boost the power of his Neutralizer, Wraithworld in its entirety was banished into Limbo, causing all Wraiths in this galaxy to lose their powers, including, apparently, their shapeshifting abilities. Subsequently, Rom banishes all the defeated Wraiths into Limbo.

The Wraith Queen, Volx, later made appearances in issues of &quot;New Warriors&quot; and &quot;Nova&quot; (vol. 2). It was later confirmed that this is the same Wraith queen introduced in &quot;Rom&quot; #48.

====Return of the Wraiths====
A salvaged Dire Wraith ship is used as a Moscow headquarters for the Russian superheroes of the Winter Guard. Fantasma was revealed to have been a Dire Wraith Queen in &quot;Darkstar &amp; the Winter Guard&quot; #2.

In the 2011 &quot;Annihilators&quot; miniseries, a team of Skrulls try to bring back Wraithworld and its population, intending to empower them and use them as a weapon to reform the Skrull Empire. The Wraith&#x27;s Queen Volx and the Galadorians both are manipulated into setting this up, and the Annihilators find that Wraithworld has to be brought back to reality to balance out the unleashed Dark Sun. The Silver Surfer discovers that Volx has actually been driven insane by an empathic link to Wraithworld in Limbo. When the Annihilators arrive there, the team is horrified to find out that after generations in Limbo, the surviving Dire Wraiths are a disease-ridden, half-starved people in constant anguish and most of them are suicidal.

The Dire Wraiths later appear as a member of the Universal Inhumans alongside the Badoon, Centaurians, and the Kymellians.

===Standalone comic series===

The Dire Wraiths received their own comic book series, which has received mixed reviews. While the characterization of the comic was praised, its cartoonish art style was heavily criticized.

==Dire Wraith characters==
The following lists some of the more notable Dire Wraith characters:
* Avoe – queen of the Dire Wraiths and member of the Universal Inhumans.
* Doctor Dredd – rare male Dire Wraith warlock.
* Hooud – a size-shifting Dire Wraith who is a member of the Universal Inhumans&#x27; Light Brigade. He operates under the alias of Creeping Death.
* Hybrid / Jimmy Marks – first hybrid offspring of a human and Dire Wraith.
* Kattan-Tu – Dire Wraith orphan who was raised by the Sarkans, a childless human couple, that named him Jimmy.
* Voorr – a Dire Wraith who is a member of the Universal Inhumans&#x27; Light Brigade. He operates under the alias of Sun. Voorr can fly and project force fields.

==Reception==
The Dire Wraiths have been criticized as being &quot;evil for evil&#x27;s sake&quot; and as having a thin motivation for their actions.

<doc id="1009410" wikidata="Q7315484" url="?curid=1009410" title="Geographical segregation">
<text>Geographical segregation exists whenever the proportions of population rates of two or more populations are not throughout a defined space. Populations can be considered any plant or animal species, human genders, followers of a certain religion, people of different nationalities, ethnic groups, etc.

In social geography segregation of ethnic groups, social classes and genders is often measured by the calculation of indices such as the index of dissimilarity. Different dimensions of segregation (or its contrary) are recognized: exposure, evenness, clustering, concentration, centralization, etc. More recent studies also highlight new local indices of segregation. 

Geographical segregation is most often measured with individuals&#x27; place of residence, but increasing geographical data availability makes it now possible to compute segregation indexes using individuals&#x27; activity space, in whole or in part.

==Human geographical segregation==

Segregation, as a broad concept, has appeared in all parts of the world where people exist—in different contexts and times it takes on different forms, shaped by the physical and human environments. The spatial concentration of population groups is not a new phenomenon. Since societies began to form there have been segregated inhabitants. Either segregated purposefully by force, or gradually over time, segregation was based on socio-economic, religious, educational, linguistic or ethnic grounds. Some groups choose to be segregated to strengthen social identity.

==Types==

===Legal segregation===
Segregation can be caused by legal frameworks, such as in the extreme example of apartheid in South Africa, and even Jewish ghettoization in Germany in the 20th century. Segregation can also happen slowly, stimulated by increased land and housing prices in certain neighborhoods, resulting in segregation of rich and poor in many urban cities. Segregation can also be assigned arbitrarily. This can occur on a global scale, such as is seen in the Partition of India, instances in Ireland, and many other situations. Geographical boundaries were often put in place without much consideration for native peoples and natural geographic terrain and cultural limits that had long been in place.

In the United States, segregation was enforced through the law. Notably, the racial segregation between white and black racial populations in the American South during the late 1800s into the first half of the 20th century. These laws consisted of separating people of color from white people in public places, including movie theaters, restaurants, schools, shopping centers, etc. The legislations were commonly referred to as Jim Crow laws. Although these laws were abolished in the mid 1960’s the impacts are still present in American communities today. Represented through the significant gap in homeownership, income status, and education levels in communities of color versus majority white.  

In apartheid South Africa, segregation was very much a legal concept. Enforced by the government, black and South-Africans of color were discriminated against, and forced to comply with apartheid. Some of the legislation passed dealt with physical segregation in schools, land tenure, geographic segregation and state repression. These were very clearly legislative, but also in the case of most white South Africans, a social construct as well.

Segregation can also be encouraged, using geographical boundaries, while not explicitly enforced. Public housing projects, especially in the United States, have been criticized for this. Putting cheap housing in poor black neighborhoods encouraged local African-Americans to stay in the area, keeping other richer areas white by not building public housing there. Current day, many communities within the United States are still segregated, due to the ongoing racial inequalities still present and self-segregation.

===Social segregation and gentrification ===
Segregation can also be caused by social factors that become evident as they happen, but are not necessarily government sanctioned. This could be things like informal ghettos, or simply rich neighborhoods. In terms of land capital, over time in a given area, humans will settle down and buy or take land. Some privileged people will acquire better land (that is, more arable, proximate to potential capital, more pleasing views). Demand for these nicer habitats drives up prices, and areas deemed “better” based solely on geography become inherently exclusionary in their population makeup.

West Point Grey, an area of Vancouver Canada, is in part rich because of the views offered of Downtown Vancouver, the Gulf Islands, and its location near the water and University of British Columbia. Wealthy people had the resources to pay for advantages, and subsequently drove up prices. Examples of this can be seen all over the world. Geographical segregation is not always defined by the sightline of places. It also occurs around certain structures, or simply in areas that are specifically developed with an income bracket in mind.

These social factors are commonly attributed to the impacts of gentrification. Gentrification is the process in which the makeup of a community is changed. These changes include racial identity, economic status, and level of education. Generally, gentrification occurs in communities that are low-income and a majority-minority population. It begins when affluent families, usually of white racial identity, move into these lower-income neighborhoods and invest their money into the community. These improvements to the community consist of reconstructing public transit, the businesses within downtown areas, and the houses in neighborhoods. This raises the overall investment value of the area, which increases the living costs. Which in turn, causes the original low-income residents to be displaced, due to the unaffordability. It can also create physical health issues for the original residents. As they are segregated in areas typically near factors or construction zones, exposing them to toxins. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has issued that gentrification is a public health issue. 

Another segregation term, the ghetto, has been used in many different contexts over time, generally meaning any physical part of a city predominantly occupied by any particular group of people. It implies that the group may be looked down upon and segregated purposefully. This does not mean that all ghettos are built up communities and buildings specifically for a segregation purpose, although many are. In the case of the United States, segregation of the African-American community was to a degree due to white flight out of the cities, rather than forcing African-Americans to live in the downtown cores.

===Gated communities===
Gated communities could be seen as a combination of both legal frameworks and social conventions regarding segregation. A gated community today is a controlled neighborhood, inhabited by people with common interests, such as safety, or class separation, but not necessarily of the same ethnicity or religion—it is distinct from an international community (in most cases). Gated communities are very controversial, as they can be seen as encouraging distinction and separation, and therefore superiority from those who do not live with the gates community.

===Self-segregation===
Self segregation is almost as common an occurrence as involuntary segregation is. Often, immigrants coming to a new and foreign country will band together for mutual benefit, and to keep a sense of community in the new country. These can be called ethnic enclaves and can be formed by any community or people group. Some well-known groups are Chinatowns, Little Italys and &quot;barrios&quot;. These localized phenomena also come in the form of ethnoburbs, which are essentially the same concept as an ethnic enclave, but specifically located in suburbs, rather than the traditional downtowns, where Chinatowns and Little Italys are usually based.

<doc id="1009417" wikidata="Q377374" url="?curid=1009417" title="Malmö Redhawks">
<text>The Malmö Redhawks (colloquially referred to simply as Malmö or by past abbreviation MIF) are a Swedish professional ice hockey team based in Malmö which plays in the SHL, with Malmö Arena as the venue for home games. 

The history of the team dates back to 1944 as the ice hockey division of the now exclusively football club Malmö FF. In 1972 the team divested from Malmö FF, marking the start of the hockey association initially known as Malmö IF. The team name was changed to MIF Redhawks in 2001 and then to the present name IF Malmö Redhawks in 2004. Officially the team goes by the name &quot;Ishockeyföreningen Malmö Redhawks&quot; (&quot;Ice Hockey Association Malmö Redhawks&quot;). The current CEO is Patrik Sylvegård who represented the team during his senior playing career.

== History ==
The team was inaugurated on 28 February 1972 as Malmö Ishockeyförening (&quot;Malmö Ice Hockey Association&quot;, or MIF) when the ice hockey division of Malmö FF was transitioned into an independent association. The early history of the team was spent in the lower divisions of Swedish hockey. Relegation to Division 2 in 1984 became the spark to a series of events including the departure of Nils Yngvesson who had been chairman of the association since its creation in 1972. The team only played one season in Division 2 before being promoted back to Division 1, where Malmö IF made what it referred to as &quot;the biggest investment in Swedish sports history.&quot;

The team&#x27;s campaign to reach the top league failed that season, but in the 1989–90 season, the team finished first in both their autumn Division 1 group, as well as the Allsvenskan in the spring, and then won the Allsvenskan final 3–0 in games against MoDo to secure promotion to Elitserien (today called the SHL) for the first time. They would remain in the top flight for 15 seasons, a period that would bring two name changes (to MIF Redhawks in 1996 and to IF Malmö Redhawks in 2003), as well as two Swedish Championship titles, in 1992 and 1994, and the 1992–93 European championship.

=== Mid 2000&#x27;s downturn ===
At the end of the 2004–05 season, the Redhawks participated in the qualification series to stay in Elitserien, where they did not manage to secure one of the spots for staying up, and were relegated. Thus, as of the 2005–06 season, they played in the HockeyAllsvenskan, the second division hockey league in Sweden; at the end of the season, the top four teams played the qualification series with the bottom two teams of Elitserien. Malmö won the qualification round and played in Elitserien during the 2006–07 season.

In 2007, the Malmö Redhawks participated in a qualification series (Kvalserien) consisting of the top four teams of HockeyAllsvenskan and the bottom two teams from Elitserien, having finished 12th in the 2006–07 Elitserien season. Malmö were considered favourites alongside the second team from Elitserien, Skellefteå AIK, but failed to re-qualify for Elitserien, falling two points behind Södertälje SK. In 2008 the team once again managed to reach Kvalserien, and had a golden opportunity to advance to Elitserien, leading the series for a majority of rounds. The Redhawks, however, lost in overtime of the final round while their arch rivals, Rögle BK, claimed the Elitserien spot with a margin of two points by scoring twice in the last minute of play. The Redhawks only managed to get 2 points in the 2008 Kvalserien last four rounds, despite having gotten 15 points after the first six games.

=== New arena and financial issues ===

During the 2008–09 season, the Redhawks moved to the newly inaugurated Malmö Arena, a state-of-the-art sports and entertainment venue, located in Hyllie in the southern parts of Malmö.

On 29 January 2009, while still playing in HockeyAllsvenskan, the team released all its contracted players due to financial debt and in order to avoid bankruptcy. The players were made free to find and sign with other teams. By then the Redhawks were ranked 10th in the league with only one month of games remaining to play, instead of the top three or seven required for Kvalserien and possible Elitserien qualification. The team finished 8th and thus missed the playoffs, although the team was just one point short from reaching the playoffs.

===Failures to reach Kvalserien and started efforts===
Malmö finished fifth in HockeyAllsvenskan in the 2009–10 season and thus reached the playoffs, which was an improvement over last season. The Redhawks started the playoffs by knocking out Bofors IK in two straight games, and the Redhawks were now set to face Almtuna IS for a series that would decide which team would be HockeyAllsvenskan&#x27;s fourth one in Kvalserien. The Redhawks beat Almtuna 2–1 at home in the first game, but lost the two following games (which the Redhawks played on away ice) and thus were eliminated from the playoffs. In the 2010–11 season, things went worse as the Redhawks failed to reach the playoffs, finishing 8th and four points short from a playoff spot.

On 28 January 2011, during the 2010–11 season, the Redhawks announced that they had agreed to a 3-year 70-million SEK ($10.6 million USD) deal with investor Hugo Stenbeck. The intention with the deal was to get Malmö Redhawks back to Elitserien.

Malmö&#x27;s efforts to reach Elitserien started immediately prior to the 2011–12 season. Several players from higher divisions, including Hannu Toivonen, Daniel Josefsson, J. D. Forrest, Jean-Luc Grand-Pierre and Linus Klasen, joined the team. When Linus Klasen joined the team on 17 May 2011, he was immediately appointed the team&#x27;s captain. Linus Klasen&#x27;s three-year contract included an annual salary of 4 million SEK (US$0.6 million), which made Klasen the best paid ice hockey player in Sweden at that time.

The season started well with a top-three spot in the league after a couple of months, but after falling down to sixth place with 47 points, at that time 10 points away from the third Kvalserien spot, Redhawks then-head coach Leif Strömberg was fired on 10 December 2011. He was replaced by the team&#x27;s then-assistant coach Ulf Taavola. Patrik Sylvegård was acquired as the team&#x27;s new assistant coach. After continuing to struggle throughout January, the Malmö Redhawks improved in February, and managed a seventh-place finish in the league, which was enough for a playoff spot. In the Playoff round, Malmö finished second due to inferior goal difference than Rögle BK, and did not qualify the 2012 Kvalserien.

=== Reconstruction ===
In early 2012, Malmö Redhawks stated that the financial situation needed to be reviewed, after Hugo Stenbeck had withdrawn from the organisation. They filed for economic reconstruction on 11 April 2012. The filing was granted the following day. The team re-negotiated the most expensive player contracts in order to reduce the total squad salary from 30 million SEK to 18 million.

On 17 May 2012 it was announced that Malmö Redhawks and Hugo Stenbeck had agreed that Stenbeck would help buy out Linus Klasen and Hannu Toivonen due to their expensive contracts.

After the 2011–12 season, Patrik Sylvegård was appointed CEO and sports director, and Redhawks profile Mats Lusth was acquired as the new assistant coach. A Sports Committee was also created, which includes people with strong connection to Malmö Redhawks. Ulf Taavola continued as head coach like the previous season when he took over Leif Strömberg. Malmö Redhawks had to sign a lot of new players. The players who remained from last season were Pontus Sjögren, Emil Carnestad, Stefan Lassen, Alexander Ribbenstrand, Robin Alvarez, Lukas Eriksson, Magnus Häggström, Tomas Kollar and Roger Olsson.

The Malmö Redhawks started the 2012–13 season in poor fashion and after 17 games played, the team had only taken 21 points, which was far from even a playoff spot towards Kvalserien. Eventually, the team began a massive boost, which went through the month of November without a single loss after regulation time, and took a total of 24 out of 27 points that month. As a result of the great effort in November, the Redhawks were located in fifth place in the league by early December. In January, the team began a losing streak and lost eight games in a row. The team finished in ninth place, which was the worst placing the team had since the large investments during the late 1980s. In Malmö, the season was over on March 2, when the regular season was finished. Having won the 2013–14 HockeyAllsvenskan the year after they fell just short of qualifying for the first tier with a 4th place finish and 15 points in the 2014 Kvalserien.

=== SHL comeback ===
This was Malmö&#x27;s eighth consecutive season in HockeyAllsvenskan, which is the second-highest league in Sweden. In the regular-season from 11 September 2014 to 26 February 2015 Malmö finished in third place which meant they qualified for 2015 Slutsspelsserien against Leksands IF. Coming into game seven it was tied 3-3 and the game was played on Leksand&#x27;s arena Tegera Arena, after a hard-fought game Malmö Redhawks won 4-2 with one goal being with empty net. Winning against Leksands IF meant that Malmö now played in SHL.

Since the comeback to the top flight, the team has managed to reach the semi-final in 2017 and 2018, and an additional quarter final in 2019.

<text>The Talysh people (, ) or Talyshis, Talyshes, Talyshs, Talishis, Talishes, Talishs, Talesh are an Iranian ethnic group, with the majority residing in Azerbaijan and a minority in Iran. They are the indigenous people of the Talish, a region on the western shore of the Caspian Sea shared between Azerbaijan and Iran. The main city of the Talysh people and their homeland is Lankaran, the majority of the population of which is ethnically Talysh. They speak the Talysh language, one of the Northwestern Iranian languages. The majority of Talyshis are Shiite Muslims.

The Talysh people are famous for their longevity and centenarianism.

== Origins ==
The Talyshis have traditionally inhabited the Talish district in the southwestern part of the Caspian Sea, which is usually considered to extend more than 150 km. Today, the northern part of Talish is located in the Republic of Azerbaijan, encompassing the districts of Lankaran, Astara, Lerik, Masally, and Yardimli. Within these five districts there are over 350 Talysh villages and towns. The southern part of Talish encompasses the western part of the Gilan province of Iran, extending to the village of Kapurchal. The most important center of the Talysh people and their ethnic homeland is the city of Lankaran, the majority of the population of which is ethnically Talysh.

It is challenging to determine the Talyshis origin because so little is known about them prior to the modern era. Like other ethnonyms, the name &quot;Tāliš&quot; cannot be established with certainty. It appears in early Arabic sources as &quot;al-Țaylasān&quot;. According to Al-Tabari (died 923); &quot;In the mountains surrounding Azarbaijan there used to live such peoples as the Gels and the al-Taylasan, who did not obey the Arabs and mastered their freedom and independence&quot;. In Persian, they are called &quot;Țālišān&quot; and &quot;Țavāliš&quot;, both plural versions of &quot;Tāliš&quot;. The native transliteration of &quot;Tāliš&quot; first appears in the 16th-century, in the Armenian version of the Alexander Romance; &quot;And he related that he is a refugee from the Caspian gates, near the country of Talish, in the province of Gilan.&quot;

Local Talysh experts commonly claim that the Talyshis are descended from the Cadusii, an ancient tribe which inhabited the district. According to Garnik Asatrian and Habib Borjian; &quot;this is one of the rare cases when a folk self-identification with an ancient people can be, at least tentatively, substantiated with historical and linguistic backgrounds.&quot; The Iranologist Richard N. Frye believed that the Talyshis are possibly descended from the Cadusii.

== History ==
===Early modern period===
====In Safavid Iran====
Talish has traditionally been associated with either Gilan or Mughan, especially with Ardabil, the center of the latter, which appears to have shared a similar linguistic and ethnic bond with Talish prior to the Turkicization of Iranian Azerbaijan. This connection was still apparent during the time of the early Safavids, who were descended from Safi-ad-Din Ardabili (died 1334), a disciple of Zahed Gilani (died 1301), who was of probable Talysh descent. Two out of the four Sufi teachers of the first Safavid monarch Shah Ismail I () carried the epithet &quot;Talishi&quot;. Other figures with the same epithet served as governmental officials under the Safavids and their successors. Several Talysh chieftains were one of the first supporters of the Safavids, who gave them the governorship of Astara, which was part of the province of Azerbaijan. The governor of Astara was also known as the &quot;hakem&quot; (governor) of Talish, which indicates that Astara was the capital of the district. From 1539 and onwards the governorship of Astara was held hereditarily by the family of Bayandor Khan Talesh.

Talish was composed of various fiefs which would sometimes be granted to other emirs than the governor of Talish. For instance, Mohammad Khan Torkman was given control over a number of fiefs in Talish and Mughan in 1586. Later in 1684, Safiqoli Khan was one of the officers in control of Lankaran, and Hoseyn was another. Meanwhile, the unnamed governor of Talish lived in Ardabil. The Safavid &quot;shahs&quot; (kings) of Iran attempted to control local Talysh chiefs by subordinating them to obedient officials. Nevertheless, despite their centralization strategy, the Safavid administration was unable to terminate the local autonomy in the South Caucasus. Officially, the local chiefs were not hereditary lords, but officials whose rank were acknowledged by a royal &quot;farman&quot; (edict) which in reality was an acceptance of their local autonomy. The familial succession of the chiefs gave rise to dynasties that dominated local affairs and sought to consolidate their influence whenever the national government weakened.

During the decline of Safavid rule in the early 18th-century, Talysh leaders attempted to establish autonomous principalities. During the Russian invasion of Iran, the people of Talish volunteered to fight for the Safavid monarch Tahmasp II (). The latter was unable to provide them with military or material support; all he could do was give them an ineffective permit that allowed them to collect the taxes of Rasht. In 1723, Russians and Ottomans agreed to divide northern and western Iran between themselves. While the Caspian provinces were under Russian control, one of the local leaders Mir-Abbas Beg, who claimed to be a &quot;seyyed&quot; (descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad), worked together with the Russian commander Mikhail Matyushkin. By the end of 1735, the reconquest of northern and western Iran was completed, being led by the Iranian military leader Nader. It was also during this period that he set his sights on the throne, as he believed his campaigns had stabilised the country and brought him enough fame. On 8 March 1736, he was crowned the new &quot;shah&quot; of Iran, marking the start of the Afsharid dynasty.

====In Afsharid and Zand Iran====

Mir-Abbas Beg kept up his relations with the Russians even after they pulled out of Iran. In order to demonstrate his loyalty to Nader Shah, he sent his son Jamal al-Din as a hostage to his court. Due to his dark complexion, Jamal al-Din earned the nickname Qara (&quot;the Black&quot;) Beg. He rose to important posts in Nader Shah&#x27;s army and was assigned the task of putting down Kalb Hoseyn Beg&#x27;s uprising in southern Talish in 1744. The murder of Nader Shah in 1747 led to the fragment of his empire; in the same fashion as the other rulers in the Southern Caucasus, Jamal al-Din (who had succeeded his father) established himself as a semi-independent ruler, marking the start of the Talysh Khanate, which used Lankaran as its capital. A khanate was a type of administrative unit governed by a hereditary or appointed ruler subject to Iranian rule. The title of the ruler was either &quot;beglarbegi&quot; or khan, which was identical to the Ottoman rank of pasha. The khanates were still seen as Iranian dependencies even when the shahs in mainland Iran lacked the power to enforce their rule in the area.

Jamal al-Din preserved his fathers correspondence with Russia, sending a letter to its empress Catherine II () that pledged his allegiance to her and offered the Russian troops access to his domains. The Zand ruler of Iran, Karim Khan Zand () was informed of this by Zohrab Beg, one of the grandees of Talish. As a result, Jamal al-Din was sent to a prison in Shiraz, the Zand capital. Karim Khan soon reversed his decision after he had discovered that Zohrab Beg had made an agreement with his rival Hedayat-Allah Khan, who ruled Gilan. Jamal al-Din was thus reinstated in Talish as its governor, being given the title of khan. After destroying Zohrab&#x27;s army and seizing control of Uluf and Dashtvand, Jamal al-Din now directed his attention towards Astara. He captured and killed its ruler Shoja al-Din, but failed to establish his rule in Astara, as the city was given to Shoja al-Din&#x27;s son by Karim Khan in an attempt to restrict Jamal al-Din&#x27;s authority. The latter, however, was able to conquer a number of towns in Talish and gain control over most of the region.

After having made peace with Hedayat-Allah Khan in 1767, Karim Khan confirmed the latter as the ruler of Gilan. The following year, Hedayat-Allah Khan launched an attack into Talish, where he defeated and captured Jamal al-Din, imprisoning him in Rasht. He then installed Jamal al-Din&#x27;s son Mir-Askar Beg as the governor of Talish. In 1772, Jamal al-Din broke out of prison and went back to Talish. In 1784, the Talysh Khanate was attacked by Fath Ali Khan of Quba, the most dominant khan in the Caucasus. He made Jamal al-Din his vassal and also had him imprisoned in Baku. Due to pressure from Russia, however, Jamal al-Din was soon released. In 1786, Jamal al-Din died and was succeeded by his son Mir-Mostafa Khan.

==== In Qajar Iran ====
Following the death of Fath-Ali Khan in 1789, Mir-Mostafa was able to rule more autonomously. However, a new threat soon emerged. Since the death of Karim Khan in 1779, Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar of the Qajar dynasty was attempting to reestablish the Iranian empire under his own rule. He issued threatening letters to the khans who had established connections with Russia in an effort to reestablish Iranian dominance over the border districts. In 1791, Agha Mohammad Khan plundered Talish, but did not succeed in subjugating it.

Agha Mohammad Khan was prepared to reinstate Iranian rule in the southeastern Caucasus by the summer of 1795. His 60,000 soldiers, which was primarily made up of cavalry, advanced into the area in the summer of that year. The first few months were spent by Agha Mohammad Khan winning the Muslim rulers&#x27; compliance. Mir-Mostafa and two other khans (Ibrahim Khalil Khan of Karabakh and Mohammad Khan Qajar of Erivan) entered into correspondence with the Russians, who gave them hope that they could defeat the Iranian forces. Heraclius also contacted the Russians, asking them for assistance against the impending invasion. Agha Mohammad Khan first directed his attention towards Talish; 10,000 soldiers led by Mostafa Khan Qajar was sent to Talish, which quickly submitted.

=== Modern period ===
==== In the Russian Empire ====
Russia more or less openly pursued a policy to free their newly conquered land from Iran&#x27;s influence. By doing this, the Russian government helped to create and spread a new Turkic identity that, in contrast to the previous one, was founded on secular principles, particularly the shared language. As a result, many Iranian-speaking residents of the future Azerbaijan Republic at the time either started hiding their Iranian ancestry or underwent progressive assimilation.

In the 19th century, there was a migration of Talyshis towards the north of modern Republic of Azerbaijan in search of work in the oil industry and fisheries. As a result, several Talysh-speaking settlements have been continued to exist since that time on the Absheron Peninsula, in particular in Baku, as well as a significant Talysh community in Sumgait.

==== In the Soviet Union ====

Talish was an economically important region for the Soviet Union, as it supplied a wide variety of products, including fruits, vegetables, tea, grains and meat. The military base in Lankaran, located near the border with Iran, was among the largest in the Caucasus.

In the early Soviet period, there were Talysh high schools, a newspaper called &quot;Red Talysh&quot;, and several Talysh language books published, but by end of the 1930s these schools were closed and the Talysh identity was not acknowledged in official statistics, with the Talysh being classified as &quot;Azerbaijani&quot;.

Talyshis with their identity and language experienced strong suppression in Soviet Azerbaijan. Like many other peoples of the republic, such as Tats and Kurds, the Talysh were subjected to forced assimilation by the Azerbaijani authorities.

The 1939 census stated that Talysh people constituted the fifth largest national community in Azerbaijan SSR, following Azeris, Russians, Armenians, and Lezgins, numbering 87,510 people. However, the Talysh population of the republic, according to the 1959 census, was only 85 individuals. The official explanation of the authorities for the almost complete disappearance of thousands of the Talyshes in this census was that &quot;Talyshes voluntarily and en masse self-identified as Azeri to census workers&quot;. In her book, Krista Goff shows through documentary evidence that the Central Statistical Administration in Moscow had plans to include a Talysh nationality category in the 1959 census, but this category was excluded during the process of collecting and reporting the census in Azerbaijan itself.

The leadership of the Azerbaijan SSR used the manipulated census data in Soviet ethnography, creating a narrative about the &quot;voluntary and complete assimilation&quot; of the Talysh people, and that it occurred &quot;naturally over time rather than from artificial manipulations of minority communities and identifications&quot;. Subsequently, there followed the production of a large amount of encyclopedic, ethnographic, linguistic, historical-geographical and other material that developed and reproduced narratives designed to justify the national &quot;erasure&quot; of the Talysh and strengthen the official myth of their &quot;voluntary assimilation.&quot; Soviet ethnographers emphasized their common features in culture and life with the Azerbaijanis and presented the &quot;assimilation&quot; of the Iranian-speaking Talysh by the Turkic-speaking Azerbaijanis as an &quot;impressive achievement&quot; of the Soviet state, &quot;ethnohistorical progress.&quot; So, for example, the Great Soviet Encyclopedia began to say that &quot;in the USSR, the Talysh almost merged with the Azerbaijanis, who are very close in material and spiritual culture, and therefore were not identified in the 1970 census&quot;. According to researchers, &quot;erasing&quot; the Talysh from censuses, like some other peoples, was one of the main ways to increase the &quot;titular&quot; Azerbaijani majority in the republic and homogenize it.

This assimilation policy put great social, political and economic pressure on the Talysh and on their daily life, encouraging them to &quot;merge&quot; with the titular Azerbaijani nation. For example, Talysh could not register as representatives of Talysh nationality in official documents, and parents could not enroll their children in schools teaching in the Talysh language. Some Talysh petitioned the authorities for their rights to be identified as Talysh in government documents, but all these requests were rejected by the authorities until 1989. Others, finding no other way out, accepted Azerbaijani identification in order to avoid discrimination in everyday life, for example, when applying for a job. Krista Goff also cites stories of Talysh who admitted that due to the stigmatization of their nationality, the lack of schools, books and other resources for the Talysh of Azerbaijan, as well as the lack of any preferences for being Talysh, they preferred the Azerbaijani self-identification and the Azerbaijani language, even fearing that their children could face discrimination if they speak Azerbaijani with a Talysh accent. Representatives of the Talysh people often internalized these assimilation narratives about themselves that were told to them and which they found in encyclopedias, articles and other printed material.

From 1960 to 1989, Talysh were not included in censuses as a separate ethnic group because they were considered part of the Azeris (Azerbaijani Turks).

In her book, Krista Goff provides interviews with some Talyshes: &quot;During these censuses [from 1959 to 1979] no one asked us about our nationality or self-identification. The census workers sat in the regional or village office and filled in the national composition of the population ahead of time based on orders from above. Then they asked us to fill in the other lines.&quot; Respondents also shared with Goff stories about how census takers recorded them as &quot;Azerbaijanis&quot; when they presented themselves as Talysh, and denied the very existence of Talysh nationality; In addition, when collecting information for the census, workers avoided the categories of native language and nationality. During the preparation of materials for the 1970 population census, some ethnographers and cartographers in Moscow expressed doubts about the census data, claiming that the Azerbaijani census authorities artificially assimilated the Talysh in order to &quot;portray their region as more ethnically
homogeneous&quot; and Azeris to be &quot;more consolidated&quot;, than in reality.

According to Goff, in order to justify the assimilation policy regarding non-titular minorities, Azerbaijani officials and scholars increasingly began to talk from the 1950s about the &quot;purportedly ancient, local origins of the Azeri nation,&quot; writing minorities, including the Talysh, into its history. Thus, emphasizing that the Talysh and other peoples of the Azerbaijan SSR &quot;descended from the same ancient population&quot; as the Azerbaijanis (Azerbaijani Turks), they tried to pass off &quot;the formation of the Azeri-defined Soviet Azerbaijani people&quot; as a &quot;natural, centuries-long process rather than the result of forced assimilation, as some minorities claimed.&quot;

It was only in 1989 that Talysh ethnicity was returned to the census, immediately counting 21,169 Talysh.

==== In the Republic of Azerbaijan ====
Historical repression of identity and the inability to practice their culture and language has led the Talysh to an internalized self-repression. This makes it difficult to gauge support for any type of Talysh movement. According to Hema Kotecha, many Talysh fear being associated with the separatist Talysh-Mughan Autonomous Republic, with Russia, or with Armenia if they acknowledge or attempt to talk about their beliefs in the public sphere. The fear of the police is another factor to this silence, although support for secular democracy and shared Azerbaijani-Talysh feelings towards Nagorno-Karabakh contribute as well.

The Talysh people have historically had a high birth rate, and during the 2000s, were the ethnic group experiencing the highest growth rate in Azerbaijan.

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty voiced their concerns about the arrest of Novruzali Mamedov, Chairman of the Talysh Cultural Centre and editor-in-chief of the &quot;Tolyshi Sado&quot; newspaper. According to a U.S. government interview with Khilal Mamedov, a Talysh rights activist, Mr. Mamedov: &quot;Accused the Azerbaijani leadership of Turkic nationalism and of seeking to suppress non-Turkic minorities…. He said the Azerbaijani leadership seeks to minimize contacts between the Talysh communities in Azerbaijan and Iran and to run Azerbaijan into a monoethnic state.&quot;

The National Talysh Movement (NTM) was formally created in 2007 by Talysh leaders exiled in the Netherlands. The members of the organization include those who were in support of the Talysh-Mughan Autonomous Republic such as Alikram Hummatov, the self-proclaimed president of Talysh-Mughan. The movement favors an autonomous region within Azerbaijan. It also demands the promotion of democratic, cultural, and linguistic rights of all minorities within Azerbaijan.

According to some sources, the Azerbaijani government has also implemented a policy of forceful integration of all minorities, including Talysh, Tat, and Lezgins.

Currently, the Talysh community in Azerbaijan is oppressed by poverty, unemployment and lack of basic infrastructure such as electricity.

Talysh have also settled in other parts of Republic of Azerbaijan. Pockets of Talysh can be found south of the Kura River in the Bilasuvar, Neftchala, and Jalilabad districts. Large numbers of Talysh have also moved to the urban surroundings of the capital, Baku. In particular, the cities of Bina and Sumqayıt have seen an influx of Talysh.

== Language ==

The Talysh language is a Northwestern Iranian language, being part of Tatic language family. Despite the absence of older Talysh texts, it is considered to be descended from Old Azeri, the indigenous Iranian language of Iranian Azerbaijan.

Talysh has three major dialects, Southern Talyshi (Masali, Masulei, Shandermani and others), Central Talyshi (Asalemi, Hashtpari and others) and Northern Talyshi (spoken in four closely linked dialect sections of Lerik, Masally, Lankaran, Astara in Azerbaijan Republic and in the dialects of Astara, Sayyadlar, Vizane, as well as Anbaran and neighbouring villages in Iran). A transitional stage of these dialects also exist, such as in Jow Kandan-e Bozorg, where a transition between Northern to Central Talyshi is spoken. Linguist Donald Stilo argues that Northern and Southern Talyshi should be regarded as individual languages in the same manner as the Kurdish languages, due to the low intelligibility between the two.

== Literature ==
The Old Azeri quatrains of Safi-ad-din Ardabili are considered to be a variant of Talysh. There are two other collections of poetry from the Middle Ages, which are typically regarded as Gilaki, though also occasionally as Talysh; the quatrains by the 13th-century writer Sayyed Sharif al-Din, also known as Sharafshah of Dula or Dulab (i.e. Talishdula[b]); and the poems of Qasim-i Anvar, who lived in the 14th and 15th centuries.

== Culture and religion ==

The Safavids&#x27; campaign of Shi&#x27;ite proselytism in Talish remained unfinished because of the district&#x27;s mountainous, remote location. Because of this, a substantial number of the Talyshis in Iran and the Azerbaijan Republic are adherents of Sunni Islam. The majority of the Talyshis in the Iranian portion of Talish are Sunnis and adherents of the Naqshbandi order. On the other hand, the majority of Talyshis in the Azerbaijani portion of Talish are Shi&#x27;ites, with the exception of around twenty-four mountain villages.

Despite the fact that the Talyshis in both Iran and Azerbaijan have a distinctive Iranian identity, its importance in Azerbaijan is considerably bigger. Their identity in Azerbaijan is built on the conflict between Iranians and Turks. They have developed a strong sense of self-identity as a result of consistently receiving unfaithful treatment on behalf of Azerbaijan. One of the main drivers of the growing Iranian identity of the Talyshis in Azerbaijan was the rise of the Pan-Turkist ideology in the country after the Soviet era. The Talyshi identity in Azerbaijan has grown significantly during the past few decades. Even after the Talysh-Mughan Autonomous Republic was abolished, Talyshis in Azerbaijan and Russia&#x27;s diaspora firmly believe in the possibility of an independent Talysh state.

Meanwhile, among the Talyshis of Iran, the search for Iranian forebears among the South Caspian indigenous peoples is an essential sign of their Iranianness.

== Demographics ==

The topic of the Talyshis&#x27; population size is among the most difficult areas of research. For various reasons, precise statistics for the Talyshi population in Iran and the Azerbaijan Republic are unavailable. This is demonstrated in the official data on the Talyshis and other ethnic minorities in the Azerbaijan Republic. According to the census conducted by the Russian Empire in 1894, there were 88,499 Talyshis in the area that corresponds to the southwestern part of the later Azerbaijan Republic. However, the number of Talyshis became downplayed during the Soviet era due to the &quot;title nations enlargement&quot; plan.

Data from the Soviet census conducted in 1926 state that there were 77,300 Talyshis residing in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic at that time. According to the 1937 Soviet census, the Talysh population had increased to 99,200. However, the Soviet census in 1939 claims that the Talysh population had decreased to 87,500. The Soviet census in 1959 claims that the Talysh population had decreased even more, now numbering eighty five. The Talyshis are not included in any Soviet population census from 1970 and 1979. However, during the &quot;Glasnost&quot; era of the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the Talyshis reappear abruptly again in the amount of 21,200 in the 1989 census of the Azerbaijan Soviet Republic, the final census of the Soviet era.

According to the official 1999 census of the Republic of Azerbaijan the number of Talysh people in the Republic of Azerbaijan was 76,000.

Talysh nationalists have always asserted that the number of Talysh in Azerbaijan is substantially higher than the official statistics. According to unofficial statistics, between 200,000 and 300,000 Talysh citizens live in Azerbaijan. Some claim that the population of the Talysh inhabiting the southern regions of Azerbaijan is 600,000. The number of Talysh speakers in 2003 was estimated to be at least 400,000 in the Republic of Azerbaijan.

According to Swedish scholar on Eurasia Svante E. Cornell Azerbaijani government denies Lezgins claim that the number of Lezgins is many times higher than official numbers, but in private many Azeris acknowledge the fact that Lezgins – for that matter Talysh or the Kurdish population of Azerbaijan is far higher than the official figure.

Obtaining accurate statistics is difficult, due to the unavailability of reliable sources, intermarriage, and the decline of the Talysh language.

The Talysh are the ethnic group experiencing the highest growth rate in modern Azerbaijan.

== Genetics ==
With regards to their NRY-Y-DNA haplogroups, the Talysh show salient Near-Eastern affinities, with haplogroup J2, associated with the advent and diffusion of agriculture in the neolithic Near East, found in over 25% of the sample. Another patriline, haplogroup R1, is also seen to range from 1/4 to up to 1/2, while R1a1, a marker associated with Eastern Indo-European, which includes Indo-Iranian peoples of Central/South Eurasia, only reaches to under 5%, along with haplogroup G.

<text>José Casimiro Rondeau Pereyra (March 4, 1773 – November 18, 1844) was a general and politician in Argentina and Uruguay in the early 19th century.

==Life and Politics==
He was born in Buenos Aires but soon after his birth, the family moved to Montevideo, where he grew up and went to school. At the age of twenty, he joined the armed forces in Buenos Aires, but later transferred to a regiment in Montevideo. During the British invasion of 1806, he was captured and sent to England. After the defeat of the British troops, he was released and went to Spain, where he fought in the Napoleonic Wars. When he returned to Montevideo in August 1810, he joined the independentist forces and was nominated military leader of the independentist armies of the &quot;Banda Oriental&quot;, later Uruguay. His military successes in the various battles for Montevideo (including the Siege of Montevideo (1812–14)) won him the post of the military leader of the campaign in Peru, replacing José de San Martín, who had to resign for health reasons.

In 1815, the Constituting General Assembly of the provinces of La Plata elected Rondeau their Supreme Director, but due to his absence, he never served as director. Ignacio Álvarez Thomas was named acting Supreme Director in his place. After two defeats against the Spanish royalist troops in Peru at Venta y Media and Sipe-Sipe, he was relieved from his command in 1816. He returned to Buenos Aires, where he became governor for a brief stint from June 5 to July 30, 1818. In 1819 he became Pueyrredón&#x27;s successor as Supreme Director (serving this time), but had to resign the following year after the Battle of Cepeda.

Subsequently, Rondeau retreated to Montevideo and tried to keep out of the internal wars between competing generals of the independentists. Nevertheless, he led several military campaigns against the Indians and in the independence wars against Brazil. In 1828, after the Treaty of Montevideo, he was elected as the governor of the newly founded Eastern Republic of Uruguay. Rondeau occupied this post from December 22, 1828 until April 17, 1830, when he was forced to abdicate by his opponent Juan Antonio Lavalleja, who held the majority in the still young parliament. Lavalleja was named governor &quot;ad interim&quot;.

Rondeau still served as general in the army, though. In the civil war of Uruguay from 1836 between the &quot;Blancos&quot; (&quot;White&quot;) and the &quot;Colorados&quot; (&quot;Red&quot;), he fought on the side of the latter and served as their war minister. He was killed in 1844 during the Great Siege of Montevideo.

<text>Prunus padus, known as bird cherry, hackberry (unrelated to the genus &quot;Celtis&quot;), hagberry, or Mayday tree, is a flowering plant in the rose family. It is a species of cherry, a deciduous small tree or large shrub up to tall. It is the type species of the subgenus &quot;Padus&quot;, which have flowers in racemes. It is native to northern Europe and northern and northeast Asia and is grown as an ornamental in North America.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Prunus padus&quot; is native to Morocco and temperate Eurasia from the British Isles to Japan. Its distribution includes all Western and Central Europe north of the Pyrenees and the Alps and south of the treeline with small pockets also found in Iberia and Northern Italy and even parts of North Africa. It also inhabits all of Eastern Europe north of the Balkan Mountains and the Steppe, as well as in the Caucasus. In Asia it is found throughout the forests of Siberia, Mongolia, the Russian Far East, Korea, Hokkaido, and parts of China with pockets in the Himalayas It is an invasive species in Alaska, prompting efforts at eradication.

==Description==
The fruit is astringent due to its tannin content.

There are two varieties:
* European bird cherry &quot;Prunus padus&quot; var. &quot;padus&quot;, Europe and western Asia.
* Asian bird cherry &quot;Prunus padus&quot; var. &quot;commutata&quot;, eastern Asia.

== Ecology ==


The flowers are hermaphroditic and pollinated by bees and flies. The fruit is readily eaten by birds, which do not perceive astringency as unpleasant.

In Eurasia, the bird-cherry ermine moth (&quot;Yponomeuta evonymella&quot;) uses bird-cherry as its host plant, and the larvae can eat single trees leafless.

In North America the tree is often attacked by the black knot fungus.

==Poison==
The glycosides prulaurasin and amygdalin, which can be poisonous to some mammals, are present in some parts of &quot;P. padus&quot;, including the leaves, stems and fruits.

== Uses ==
The fruit of this tree is seldom used in western Europe, but, long ago, may possibly have been used as a food far to the east.

In Russia the fruit of the tree is still used for culinary purposes. The dried berries are milled into a flour of variable fineness that forms the principal ingredient of bird-cherry cake. The flour is brown, and so is the cake, even though there is no chocolate in it. Both flour and cake are sold in local stores and bakeries. In a more conventional method of preparation, fresh bird cherries may also be minced and cooked to make jam.

The variety commutata is sold as an ornamental tree in North America under the common name Mayday. It is valued for its hardiness and spring display of fragrant, white flowers. The common name Mayday tree refers to the May Day festival, being unrelated to the distress signal mayday. The name for the tree was in use prior to the adoption of &quot;mayday&quot; (the phonetic equivalent of the French &quot;m&#x27;aider&quot; – from &quot;venez m&#x27;aider&quot;, &quot;come [and] help me&quot;) as an international distress signal.

==History==
According to Herodotus (writing some 2500 years ago) a strange race called the Argippaeans, all bald from birth, who lived in an area identifiable possibly as the foothills of the Urals, would pick the bean-sized fruits of a tree called &quot;pontic&quot; and squeeze from them a drinkable black juice, making afterwards, from the residue of the pressing, a type of cake. This juice and the &quot;cakes&quot; produced in its manufacture were, according to Herodotus (who derived his account from the reports of Scythian traders), the main sustenance of the &quot;bald people&quot;. Furthermore, according to A. D. Godley (translator of an edition of the works of Herodotus published in the early 1920s) it was said that the Cossacks not only made a similar juice from &quot;Prunus padus&quot;, but also called it by a name similar to the one (&quot;aschu&quot;) by which the bald Argippeans called theirs. As might well be expected of so cherry-loving a race, the Argippeans – a just and kindly people – took good care of their trees, protecting them from the harsh winters of their homeland – seemingly by incorporating them (as a central pole symbolising the axis mundi) into the yurt-like felt tents in which they lived:They dwell each man under a tree, covering it in winter with a white felt cloth, but using no felt in summer. These people are wronged by no man, for they are said to be sacred; nor have they any weapon of war. These are they who judge in the quarrels between their neighbours; moreover, whatever banished man has taken refuge with them is wronged by none.— Herodotus, Ἱστορίαι (&quot;The Histories&quot;) Book IV, Chapter 23

== Culture ==
In Finland and Sweden, the blooming of bird cherry (Finnish &quot;tuomi&quot;, Swedish &quot;hägg&quot;) signifies the start of the summer for many people. In southern Finland, this normally takes place during the two last weeks of May or very early June.

Ukrainian song &quot;Cheremshyna&quot; refers to a blooming of bird cherry.

A taboo on the use of the wood of the hackberry (or hagberry) was reported by natives of Advie, in northeast Scotland, who believed it to be a &quot;witches&#x27; tree&quot;.

The tree was used medicinally during the Middle Ages, during which period it was also believed that the bark of the tree, placed at the door, would ward off plague.

The Mayday tree is abundant as an introduced species in Anchorage, Alaska, having been planted in great numbers by landscapers and homeowners. It displaces native trees and is harmful to moose and to young salmon.

<doc id="1009435" wikidata="Q2328257" url="?curid=1009435" title="Arena (Duran Duran album)">
<text>Arena is a live album by the English pop rock band Duran Duran, released on 12 November 1984 by Parlophone. In 2004, the album was reissued on CD in remastered form with two bonus tracks.

&quot;Arena&quot; was Duran Duran&#x27;s first live album, released at the peak of their commercial success in late 1984. It included one new song, the studio recorded &quot;The Wild Boys&quot;, which as a single was a worldwide hit, reaching no. 2 in both the UK and the US.

&quot;Arena&quot; was released together with a number of corresponding releases, including the conceptual concert film &quot;Arena (An Absurd Notion)&quot;, a documentary tour book and a board game. An edited version of the film with just the live performances, &quot;As the Lights Go Down&quot;, was also released. &quot;Arena&quot; marked the last album release featuring the complete original five-piece line-up of the band.

==Critical reception==

Upon its release, &quot;Smash Hits&quot; reviewer Dave Rimmer criticised the album for its lack of &quot;any kind of live feeling&quot;, but still gave it a 7 out 10 rating for its &quot;competent&quot; content.

<doc id="1009437" wikidata="Q7958180" url="?curid=1009437" title="WYTS">
<text>WYTS (1230 AM) is a commercial black-oriented news radio station licensed to Columbus, Ohio. Owned by iHeartMedia, the station serves the Columbus metro area. Besides a standard analog transmission, the station is available online via iHeartRadio. The WYTS studios are located along in Downtown Columbus, while the station transmitter resides southwest of the city&#x27;s downtown area.

WYTS is the sixth-oldest continuously running radio station in the state of Ohio, and is best known for its Top 40 format in the 1960s and 1970s under the heritage WCOL calls. In the time period between 1998 and today, the station has undergone five different format changes with as many different call signs.

==History==
===Early years===
====WMAN / WSEN====
WYTS was first licensed, as WMAN, to the Broad Street Baptist Church in downtown Columbus on October 5, 1922. The original call letters were randomly assigned from a sequential roster of available call signs. Studios and transmitter were located within the church, and its initial schedule was only a few hours of church services each Sunday. Church member W. E. Heskett became the license holder of WMAN in conjunction with the church in December 1924, and had purchased the station outright by 1927. Hours of operation expanded gradually beyond Sunday services, and WMAN&#x27;s studios were relocated to the Seneca Hotel.

Heskett leased airtime on WMAN to the Columbus Broadcasting Corporation in late 1929, with a buyout following months later. In order to distance the station from its original religious image, its call sign was changed to WSEN on September 9, 1930, reflecting the Seneca Hotel. By 1932, the station operated on a daily basis from 8:00 a.m. until midnight.

====WCOL====
The station became WCOL on September 11, 1934, upon its sale to &quot;The Columbus Dispatch Publishing Company&quot;, headed by Edgar and Robert F. Wolfe, whose family also owned WBNS (AM) and WBNS-FM Radio. WCOL and WBNS shared studios and offices, with WCOL eventually affiliating with both the NBC Red and Blue networks by 1937 (retaining the Blue affiliation in 1943). In 1941, implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement moved WCOL to 1230 kHz, where it has remained ever since.

The August 1941 adoption of the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s &quot;duopoly&quot; rule restricted licensees from operating more than one radio station in a given market. WCOL was spun off by the Wolfe family to a partnership headed by several members of The Pixleys Incorporated, headed by family members Lloyd Pixley, Martha Pixley and Grace Pixley. Lloyd was the son of former WBAV operator Milton Pixley (today known as WTVN), and became president of WCOL with the sale. The station soon received both a new transmitter, and an FM sister station at 92.3 MHz, which also took the WCOL calls.

The Pixleys sold WCOL AM and FM to Air Trails, Inc. in January 1952. Air Trails, and its successor Great Trails Broadcasting would be the primary owners of WCOL for over 52 years. Operating power for the station was increased to 1,000 watts during the daytime by July 1960, along with broadcasting 24-hours a day. By then an independent station, it changed its format to Top-40 that July 1, dubbing itself &quot;The New WCOL&quot;.
WCOL was best known to Columbus area residents throughout the 1960s during this era, and was the primary Top-40 format station in the Columbus market when its jingle &quot;twelve thirty the new W-C-O-L&quot; was part of the local audio landscape. It held this distinction from 1960 to the early 1970s, until the rise in popularity of FM broadcasting and competition from WNCI.

WCOL, in its Top-40 heyday was heralded as the station which &quot;premiered&quot; the hits. Bryan McIntyre gained national award recognition for his uncanny ability to pick hit music, in advance of other radio markets. The WCOL calls were also used in tribute as the backdrop for the 1996 Tom Hanks movie &quot;That Thing You Do.&quot;

Air Trails was renamed Great Trails Broadcasting in 1969 after a corporate reorganization, but still retaining much of the management and personnel. Great Trails also would own regional stations WING in Dayton, WIZE in Springfield, WGTZ (née WJAI) in Eaton, and WKLO (now WKJK) and WKLO-FM (now WDJX-FM) in Louisville during this time. WCOL-FM would also see changes, splitting away from the AM station to highlight a progressive rock format before becoming &quot;92X&quot; WXGT (for &quot;X-Great Trails&quot;) where the top 40 format was moved to.

As the 1970s faded, the station changed format to a more adult-contemporary focus. WCOL was still successful in this format until a series of management and airstaff changeovers followed in the early 1980s, including a brief switch to middle of the road-styled adult standards and the brief return of Columbus broadcast legend Spook Beckman. The station began broadcasting at 1,000 watts 24-hours a day, along with a format change to news/talk. After that format failed to show in the ratings, WCOL flipped back to &quot;Top-40 Oldies&quot; with the WXGT calls dropped reverting to WCOL-FM.

By 1991, WCOL-AM was simulcasting WCOL-FM&#x27;s oldies programming, with the AM station soon breaking off to play 1950s oldies. In short order, WCOL went back to a news/talk format, only this time assuming a mostly-syndicated lineup.

===Later years===
The station and WCOL-FM were sold to Nationwide Communications in 1994, the parent company of WNCI.

WCOL became WFII on March 24, 1997, airing a syndicated conservative talk radio format as &quot;1230 FYI,&quot; though this time it was oriented at younger listeners. WTVN owner Jacor Communications acquired WFII, WCOL and WNCI in August 1998, and ultimately merged with Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) that next year.

WFII was not a ratings success, and in 2001 the station became WZNW, airing a sports talk format as &quot;1230 The Zone&quot;. However, WZNW was never able to compete effectively against the other full-time sports station in Columbus, WBNS, which held the rights to the Ohio State Buckeyes.

WCOL returned to 1230 in 2003, playing pre-British Invasion pop/rock as &quot;Real Oldies 1230&quot;. WCOL traded in on its heritage as a Top 40 station, and the &quot;Real Oldies&quot; format played much of the same music. They even used some of their vintage PAMS and TM jingles from that era. Despite some positive &quot;buzz&quot; from long-time radio listeners, many of whom remembered WCOL from its Top 40 heyday, the format failed to capture a significant audience in the market. The station, mostly automated using voice-tracking, lacked the live personalities which made the original WCOL great.

At noon on September 7, 2004, WCOL became WTPG, as &quot;Progressive Talk AM 1230.&quot; WTPG carried programming mostly from the Air America Radio network, as well as syndicated hosts Ed Schulz, Springer on the Radio (via a 21-hour delay in morning drive) and Stephanie Miller. WTPG saw mild ratings improvements, although (as was the case with WFII, WZNW and WCOL) ranked well behind counter-programmed sister station WTVN.

On December 23, 2006, the Columbus Dispatch reported that WTPG would change again that January 8 over to a conservative-based talk format, under the WYTS calls. Bruce Collins, the local program director for WTVN and WYTS, said: &quot;Whether it&#x27;s politics or sports, financial information or general advice, central Ohio listeners will have the opportunity to talk about it on &#x27;Talk 1230.&#x27;&quot;

Shortly after the station announced the pending format change, a small group of people formed Ohio Majority Radio, an eventually unsuccessful grassroots attempt to save the progressive radio format on 1230 AM. Competing station WVKO (1580 AM) eventually changed formats, and picked up much of the former WTPG schedule for a brief time before switching to a religious format.

On January 26, 2009, WYTS dropped the conservative talk format and became the Columbus affiliate for Fox Sports Radio. WYTS will carry the full FSR schedule (with the exception of 9 a.m. – noon, when a replay of the &quot;Steve Czaban Show&quot; will air instead of &quot;The Dan Patrick Show&quot;, which aired on WTDA) and will hold on to &quot;The Jim Rome Show&quot;. After WTDA dropped its talk format and Patrick&#x27;s show in late December 2009, WYTS picked Patrick&#x27;s show live.

On February 21, 2017, WYTS and W287CP flipped to Urban AC as &quot;Vibe 105.3&quot;. The change comes as the sports format was made irrelevant due to sister station WXZX flipping to a similar format the previous November. Michael Eiland, assistant program director and middayer of sister WODC, will host mornings on Vibe. The remainder of the day will feature Premium Choice hosts including WVAZ afternoon host Joe Soto in middays and WSOL-FM midday host Jo-Jo in afternoons.

On March 28, 2017, just over a month after the flip to &quot;Vibe&quot;, WYTS and W287CP rebranded as &quot;Kiss 105.3&quot;. The change was likely due to a conflict with similarly branded &quot;Vibe Radio HD&quot; on WCVO-HD2.

On November 29, 2017, WYTS flipped to a classic hip-hop format. The change occurred as former similarly formatted WBMO flipped to a simulcast of WCKX the day prior.

On October 2, 2020, WYTS flipped to all-news, joining iHeart&#x27;s &quot;Black Information Network&quot;. The classic hip hop format continues on the 105.3 translator, relayed by WZCB&#x27;s HD2 sub-channel.

<doc id="1009444" wikidata="Q1754529" url="?curid=1009444" title="Main Street Electrical Parade">
<text>The Main Street Electrical Parade is a nighttime parade, created by Robert Jani and project director Ron Miziker. It features floats and live performers covered in over 600,000 electronically controlled LED lights, and uses a synchronized soundtrack triggered by radio control along key areas of the parade route.

The original parade at Disneyland in California ran from 1972 to 1996, and again in limited engagements in 2017, 2019, and 2022. The neighboring Disney California Adventure park hosted the parade between 2001 and 2010. Another version, at the Magic Kingdom in Florida&#x27;s Walt Disney World Resort, ran from 1977 to 1991, 1999 to 2001, and 2010 to 2016.

The parade has also spun off several other versions that ran or continue to run at Disney parks around the world. An updated version has run at Tokyo Disneyland as Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade: DreamLights since 2001. In 2014, Hong Kong Disneyland premiered a spiritual successor to the Main Street Electrical Parade, the &quot;Paint the Night Parade&quot;. An extended version of &quot;Paint the Night&quot; premiered at Disneyland on May 22, 2015, as part of the park&#x27;s 60th anniversary celebration, and moved to Disney California Adventure on April 12, 2018. Paint the Night is set to return to Disneyland Park on May 16, 2025 for Disneyland&#x27;s 70th anniversary celebration.

The original Disneyland version of the parade ran at Walt Disney World&#x27;s Magic Kingdom as &quot;Disney&#x27;s Main Street Electrical Parade&quot; from June 5, 2010, to October 9, 2016, when it closed in preparation for a limited-time run at Disneyland. The Disneyland run started on January 19, 2017, and was planned to run through June 18, 2017, but due to popular demand, Disney extended the parade&#x27;s run to August 20, 2017.

On June 28, 2019, Disneyland officially announced that the parade would once again return to Disneyland Park for another limited engagement run, which began on August 2, 2019, and ran through September 30, 2019.

On October 26, 2021, the Disney Parks&#x27; TikTok account released a video teasing the parade&#x27;s return to Disneyland again. On November 20, 2021, it was announced at Destination D23 that the parade will return in spring 2022. Disney confirmed on February 22, 2022, that the parade would return on April 22, 2022, as well as revealing a reimagined To Honor America finale float that is more inclusive. The parade&#x27;s 50th anniversary run began on April 20, 2022, during a soft opening that was live streamed on the Disney Parks Blog and had its &quot;final performance of the season&quot; on September 1, 2022.

A spin-off of the parade performed at Disneyland Paris from January 8, 2024 to January 9, 2025 called the Disney Electrical Sky Parade, which honored the Disneyland Paris version of the parade using drones, water effects, projections, and pyrotechnics on drones.

==History==
===Inspiration===
The predecessor to the 1972 Disneyland Main Street Electrical Parade was the Electrical Water Pageant, a show consisting of fourteen 25-foot-tall (7.6 m) screens decorated with electrical lights and presented on Walt Disney World&#x27;s Seven Seas Lagoon from 1971 to the present. Not long after the Electrical Water Pageant debuted, Card Walker commissioned the development of what became the Main Street Electrical Parade to provide Disneyland with a similar nighttime visual spectacle. The parade&#x27;s design used nickel–cadmium batteries, which the Disney movie studio had recently started using, and Italian-made miniature bulbs that Disneyland staff had seen in light displays along Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. Disney arranged for the parade&#x27;s original floats to be constructed by Silvestri, the Chicago-based company responsible for those holiday displays.

Two months to deadline, Disney discovered the float contractor was far behind schedule and decided to finish the floats themselves in a backstage area at Disneyland. Disney brought on welders, electricians and other temporary workers to assemble the floats and hand-tint and install 500,000 bulbs. The engineers who helped create the parade also created the first automated parade show-control program. This allowed the long parade route to contain multiple radio-activated &quot;trigger zones&quot;. Using radio-activated triggers as each float entered a zone, the audience would hear float-specific music through the park&#x27;s audio system. Each zone was between long, and the zoned system meant that every person watching the parade would experience the same show, no matter where they stood along the parade route.

===Early years===
The first rehearsal was a &quot;disaster&quot;; a float crashed into a building on Main Street, U.S.A., and some performers&#x27; costumes emitted sparks. Despite these obstacles, the parade successfully debuted on schedule on June 17, 1972. The original parade floats featured the Blue Fairy, a large drum pulled by the Casey Jr. Engine, Cinderella, a Chinese dragon, and a circus calliope. Until 1977, some of the floats, such as the elephant train and the American flag finale, were flat screens on manually-pushed rolling platforms similar to the Electrical Water Pageant.

The Main Street Electrical Parade had counterparts of the same name and layout at Magic Kingdom in the Walt Disney World Resort, which ran from June 11, 1977, to September 14, 1991. It was replaced by a similar parade called &quot;SpectroMagic&quot;, which ran from October 1, 1991, to May 20, 1999, reopened on April 2, 2001, and ended on June 4, 2010. On April 12, 1992, the version from Magic Kingdom went to Disneyland Park at Disneyland Paris and ran there until March 23, 2003. It was then replaced by Fantillusion, a nighttime parade from Tokyo Disneyland that had earlier replaced the Tokyo version of the Main Street Electrical Parade, which ran from March 9, 1985, to June 21, 1995.

On June 14, 1997, a presentation of the Electrical Parade called the &quot;Hercules Electrical Parade&quot;, ran on Broadway, Manhattan, New York City for the opening of Disney&#x27;s New Amsterdam Theater and the film &quot;Hercules&quot;. Disney arranged for the lights to be all turned off on about eight blocks of Broadway up to the theater. All businesses complied, with the exception of Disney rival Warner Brothers. It was led by a custom Hercules title unit made for this one time only use. It was shown on national television on a one-hour promotional program featuring the music and making of Hercules.

===Later years===
The Main Street Electrical Parade closed at Disneyland on November 25, 1996, after a 24-year run. Light bulbs certified as having been part of the show were sold to collectors. The show&#x27;s replacement, the Light Magic parade, opened in 1997 to disappointing results. Disney quickly cancelled Light Magic but held off in bringing back the popular Main Street Electrical Parade. However, the parade was refurbished and appeared at Magic Kingdom on May 21, 1999, for a limited engagement, just in time for Walt Disney World Millennium Celebration. The parade ended its run at Magic Kingdom on April 1, 2001, and SpectroMagic was brought back the following day.

Back in Japan, the Tokyo version of the show would return as Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade - DreamLights on June 1, 2001, with much larger floats, more than 1 million lights, and a new G-major and orchestral version of Baroque Hoedown arranged by Gregory Smith, replacing the classic A-minor version of the song. This version of the parade gets updated with new units regularly and still performs at Tokyo Disneyland today, aside from a hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Main Street Electrical Parade floats were then sent back to California for the parade&#x27;s return to Disneyland. These plans changed after Anaheim management saw the poor attendance figures for the spring break season at Disney California Adventure and feared that the park would fail to attract large crowds during the crucial summer season unless they had a big draw. So Disney announced that the popular Main Street Electrical Parade would be coming to Disney California Adventure Park on July 2, 2001, in honor of the park&#x27;s first summer. The name of the show was changed from the Main Street Electrical Parade to Disney&#x27;s Electrical Parade, as Disney California Adventure has no Main Street. All of the 1996 parade floats returned, except for the Snow White diamond mine float and the Pinocchio unit, as they were sent to Disneyland Paris in 1997.

During the 2008 &quot;Walt Disney World Christmas Day Parade&quot; special, Disney announced a new Tinker Bell float would join the parade to replace the Blue Fairy as the parade&#x27;s leader. This would also mark the first new float in 20 years to be added to the parade. It was also announced in early 2009 that the Snow White diamond mine float and Pinocchio unit would be returning to the California version as well. The parade then held its final performance in its original form on January 5, 2009, and closed for six months as it underwent a massive refurbishment. The parade then returned on June 12, 2009 with the Tinker Bell, Snow White Diamond mine, and Pinocchio units joining the show. The parade also saw an update to the lights, as they were all replaced with LEDs, and the introduction of the G-major version of Baroque Hoedown that was first used in DreamLights in 2001 at Tokyo Disneyland, but less orchestral. This update was done for Disneyland&#x27;s &quot;Summer Nightastic!&quot; 2009 promotional package.

Disney&#x27;s Electrical Parade then ended is run at Disney California Adventure on April 18, 2010, and was sent to Magic Kingdom as part of the Walt Disney World 2010 promotional package &quot;Summer Nightastic!&quot; The parade was not modified from its Disney California Adventure run, with the drum still saying &quot;Disney&#x27;s Electrical Parade&quot;, but the name of the parade itself was changed back to The Main Street Electrical Parade. The parade returned to Magic Kingdom on June 5, 2010. While it was initially announced that the parade would run through August 14, 2010, Disney later announced in July 2010 that the parade would stay in Florida for the time being, and that it was on an &quot;open-ended&quot; run. 

Six years later, the parade would finally end its run at Magic Kingdom on October 9, 2016, in preparation for a limited-time return to Disneyland Park in California, which was scheduled to run from January 20 to June 18, 2017, before being extended to August 20, 2017. A special ticketed premiere event, costing , occurred on January 19, 2017. Disneyland restored the drum float to once again read &quot;Main Street Electrical Parade&quot; as well as &quot;Disneyland Presents&quot;. Tinker Bell&#x27;s float, added in 2009, was moved back to the Peter Pan unit and was altered for the 2017 run, making Casey Junior the new leader of the parade. On February 24, 2017, the pixie dust swooshes added to the floats in 2009 were removed, except on Tinker Bell&#x27;s float, since Tinker Bell was no longer the parade&#x27;s leader. On June 28, 2019, Disney announced that the Main Street Electrical Parade would return to Disneyland for a third run on August 2, 2019, and would run through September 30, 2019.
On July 22, 2019, to advertise the parade&#x27;s new run, the official Disneyland Resort YouTube channel posted a slightly edited version of a commercial from two years prior. The parade ran at Disneyland from August 2 through September 30 for its 2019 seasonal run. On September 28, 2020, one of the spinning snails of the Alice In Wonderland unit made a special live appearance for &quot;Tyra Banks&quot;&#x27; opening entrance for the 2020 Disney Night of &quot;Dancing With The Stars&quot;.

===50th anniversary and beyond===
One year later, on October 26, 2021, the Disney Parks TikTok released a video teasing the parade&#x27;s return to Disneyland again, which was confirmed by Disney Parks chairman Josh D&#x27;Amaro at Destination D23 on November 20, 2021. A return date for the parade was later announced on February 22, 2022 to be April 22, 2022, and that it would be another limited return engagement in honor of the parade&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Disney also revealed that the &quot;To Honor America&quot; finale had been redesigned to be more inclusive and now features dolls from &quot;it&#x27;s a small world&quot; that represent movies such as: &quot;Brave&quot;, &quot;Hercules&quot;, &quot;Mulan&quot;, &quot;Coco&quot;, &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;, &quot;Moana&quot;, &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;Raya and the Last Dragon&quot;, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, and &quot;Encanto&quot;, as well as the return of the Blue Fairy. The parade soft opened on April 20, 2022, and finished its 50th anniversary limited time run on September 1, 2022. On July 14, 2022, when Disney announced the parade&#x27;s end date, the Disneyland website updated the parade&#x27;s info to include “leaving for the season after September 1”, suggesting the parade will likely return again in the future.
===Disney Electrical Sky Parade===
On October 7, 2023, Disneyland Paris announced that a new show called the Disney Electrical Sky Parade would premiere at Disneyland Paris as part of the Disney Symphony of Colours celebration in 2024. The Disney Electrical Sky Parade premiered at Disneyland Paris on January 8, 2024 and was created as a direct tribute to Disneyland Paris&#x27; Main Street Electrical Parade. The show used 500 drones, water effects, projections, and pyrotechnics on drones to recreate every unit from the iconic parade in the sky, including the Disneyland version&#x27;s new &quot;it&#x27;s a small world&quot; finale from 2022. The show was originally scheduled to end its run on September 30, 2024, but was extended to January 6, 2025. However, it was then extended again by a few days, with the show&#x27;s final performance held on January 9, 2025. 

From October 2 to November 3, 2024, the show was updated for the Halloween season, with the &quot;it&#x27;s a small world&quot; finale replaced by a Halloween finale. The Halloween finale pays tribute to Disney villains, including Dr. Facilier from The Princess and the Frog, Mother Gothel from Tangled, Ursula from The Little Mermaid, The Evil Queen from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and Jafar from Aladdin. The finale ends with a tribute to the Disneyland Paris attraction Phantom Manor, including an electronic version of Grim Grinning Ghosts.

From November 9, 2024 to January 6, 2025, the show was updated again, this time for Christmas, with the &quot;it&#x27;s a small world&quot; finale replaced by a Christmas finale.

==Units==

=== US versions ===
Over the years and numerous iterations of the parade, the roster of floats has changed. The version of the parade that has appeared in Disneyland, the Magic Kingdom, and Disneyland Paris has maintained a continuous set of units. These include The Casey Jr. train from &quot;Dumbo&quot; carrying Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse and Goofy and subsequent floats based on &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot; and a patriotic American float titled &quot;To Honor America&quot;. Previous units included the Blue Fairy from &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, a circus float connected to &quot;Dumbo&quot;, an &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World&quot; unit (returned in 2022) and a promotional float for &quot;Return to Oz&quot; in 1985, but it was destroyed by a fire. In 2022, Disney revealed that the &quot;To Honor America&quot; finale had been redesigned to be more inclusive and now features dolls as seen from the returning &quot;it&#x27;s a small world&quot; that represent movies such as &quot;Brave&quot;, &quot;Hercules&quot;, &quot;Mulan&quot;, &quot;Coco&quot;, &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;, &quot;Moana&quot;, &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;Raya and the Last Dragon&quot;, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot; and &quot;Encanto&quot;, as well as the return of the Blue Fairy. The new float also features color changing lights, and the end portion of the unit being removed from the rest of the unit to create a new singular float.

=== DreamLights ===
&quot;Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade: DreamLights&quot; features a number of floats featured in the western incarnation, though they are upgraded or alternate models. As of the 2023 renewal, the new floats are &quot;Blue Fairy&quot;, &quot;Knights of Light&quot;, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Dreamlights Train&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas, &quot;Disney Fairies&quot;, &quot;&quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&#x27;&quot;, &quot;&quot;Zootopia&quot;, &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot;, &quot;Brother Bear&quot;, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, &quot;&quot;Hercules&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;101 Dalmatians&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;The Lion King&quot;&quot;, &quot;The Muppets&quot;, &quot;&quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;&quot;, &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, &quot;Brave&quot;, &quot;Inside Out&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;, &quot;Toy Story&quot;, &quot;Ratatouille&quot;&quot;, &quot;Up&quot;, &quot;Coco&quot;, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;, &quot;Cars&quot;&quot;, WALL-E, &quot;Onward&quot;, &quot;&quot;Aladdin&quot;&quot;, &quot;Tangled&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;&quot;, &quot;Mulan&quot;, &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;, &quot;Moana&quot;, &quot;&quot;Pocahontas&quot;, &quot;&quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World (see below)&quot;.

Like the current finale in the US versions, the finale here features movies such as: Pinocchio, &quot;Brave&quot;, The Three Caballeros, Encanto, The Three Little Pigs &quot;Raya and the Last Dragon&quot;, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, etc.

==Versions==

There were 4 versions of the parade.

=== Original Disneyland version ===
The original Disneyland parade was built in 1972. This version ran at Disneyland Park (in Anaheim) from June 17, 1972, until 1974. It was replaced by America on Parade for two years.

=== Redesigned Disneyland version ===
In 1977, the floats were redesigned and updated by designer Bob Jani, based on his original 1972 designs, and built by Troy Barrett. The updated version premiered at Disneyland on June 11, 1977. It then continued with one more major break during 1982–1985 until November 25, 1996. It then ran through Times Square in New York as the &quot;Hercules Electrical Parade&quot; for one night only on June 14, 1997. 
After this, both Pinocchio floats and the Seven Dwarfs Diamond Mine float were sent to Paris. The parade then went on hiatus for two years before being moved to Magic Kingdom (in Orlando), where it lasted from May 21, 1999, until April 1, 2001. After that, it moved to the struggling Disney&#x27;s California Adventure Park (in Anaheim), where it ran from July 2, 2001, until April 18, 2010. In 2009, the parade&#x27;s soundtrack was updated to match Tokyo&#x27;s, while the Dumbo&#x27;s Circus unit was removed from the parade and the Blue Fairy was replaced with a new TinkerBell float. When it ended there, it moved back to the Magic Kingdom (in Orlando), where it lasted from June 5, 2010, until October 9, 2016 
It then left Magic Kingdom (in Orlando) to move back to its home park, Disneyland (in Anaheim), where it ran from January 19, 2017 until August 20 of the same year. Disney later announced on June 28, 2019, that it would return to Disneyland for a third run which began on August 2, 2019, and ended on September 30, 2019. One year later, one of the spinning snails from the Alice in Wonderland unit made a live TV appearance on Dancing with the Stars on September 28, 2020, confirming the parade was on another hiatus. 

A year later on October 26, 2021, the Disney Parks TikTok released a video teasing the parade&#x27;s return yet again, with the same snail being loaded onto a truck bound for Disneyland. The parade returned again for its 50th anniversary on April 20, 2022, and ran until September 1, 2022. Also for its 2022 return, Disney revealed that the &quot;To Honor America&quot; finale float had been redesigned to be more inclusive and now featured dolls from &quot;it&#x27;s a small world&quot; that represent movies such as &quot;Brave&quot;, &quot;Hercules&quot;, &quot;Mulan&quot;, &quot;Coco&quot;, &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;, &quot;Moana&quot;, &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;Raya and the Last Dragon&quot;, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, and &quot;Encanto&quot;, as well as the return of the Blue Fairy. The new float also features color changing lights, and the end portion of the unit being removed from the rest of the unit to create a new singular float. The opening logo unit also saw an update to the parade&#x27;s logo similar to the text used at DCA and the 2010–2016 run at Walt Disney World, as well as a 50th anniversary logo for the 2022 return. A new inclusive opening fanfare that honor&#x27;s the parade&#x27;s legacy and Walt Disney&#x27;s dedication of Disneyland in 1955 was also introduced for the 2022 return.

=== Walt Disney World and Disneyland Paris version ===
The Walt Disney World version was built in 1977 and premiered in Magic Kingdom (in Orlando) on June 11, 1977. It was a clone of the one that was running in Anaheim, with slightly wider floats due to Magic Kingdom&#x27;s wider parade route. 
It ran there until September 14, 1991, but actually had one last performance on September 30, 1991, during a private media event. It was then moved across the Atlantic to Disneyland Park (Paris). The Swans from Tokyo Disneyland was added in 1997, whilst the Snow White and the Pinocchio units from Disneyland were added in 1998. It lasted from April 12, 1992, up until March 23, 2003, where it was sent to Hong Kong Disneyland, but never appeared there. The Snow White and the Pinocchio units were sent back to Disneyland in 2009.

A spin-off tribute of the parade called the Disney Electrical Sky Parade was announced on October 7, 2023 and premiered on January 8, 2024 as part of the Disney Symphony of Colours celebration. This new show recreates the iconic parade in the sky by using hundreds of drones, water effects, projections, and pyrotechnics on drones to recreate every unit from the parade in the sky, including the redesigned Disneyland version&#x27;s new &quot;it&#x27;s a small world&quot; finale from 2022. A Halloween version of the show ran from October 2 to November 3, 2024, followed by a Christmas version that ran from November 9, 2024 to January 6, 2025. The show was originally scheduled to end its run on September 30, 2024, but was extended and ended its run on January 9, 2025.

=== Tokyo Disneyland/DreamLights version ===
The Tokyo Disneyland version was built in 1985. It premiered on March 9, 1985, and closed on June 21, 1995. When it closed, it was refurbished into &quot;Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade: &quot;DreamLights&quot;&quot;. DreamLights premiered at Tokyo Disneyland on June 17, 2001.

In 1997, the Swan Lake Unit was sent to Disneyland Paris.

This version of the parade went on an unscheduled hiatus from February 28, 2020, to October 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The parade returned on November 1, 2021, with physical dancers removed and some characters omitted due to Japan&#x27;s physical distancing guidelines, as well as a new inclusive opening fanfare.

In 2023, all physical dancers and characters that were removed returned and the new floats as part of the Disney 100 Years Of Wonder and the 40th Dream-Go-Round celebrations.

==Music==
The Main Street Electrical Parade&#x27;s underlying theme song is entitled &quot;Baroque Hoedown.&quot; The original version was created in 1967 by early synthesizer pioneers Jean-Jacques Perrey and Gershon Kingsley and appeared first on the album Kaleidoscopic Vibrations: Electronic Pop Music from Way Out. Originally, the parade&#x27;s soundtrack had the same themes as the current recording, but was a different arrangement by Jim Christensen and Paul Beaver. In 1977, it was updated and arranged by electronic music artist Don Dorsey and Jack Wagner at Jack Wagner Studio, which was used until January 5, 2009, in Disney&#x27;s Electrical Parade.

When the parade returned to Disney California Adventure on June 12, 2009, it began using the updated, orchestrated DreamLights soundtrack from Tokyo, but with changes made as certain floats in the California parade are not included in the Tokyo parade. The soundtrack for the current version, the 2009 version of Disney&#x27;s Electrical Parade, The Main Street Electrical Parade (the last run ending in 2016 at Magic Kingdom), and the 2017, 2019 and 2022 runs of the Main Street Electrical Parade at Disneyland, as well as Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade DreamLights version were arranged, programmed and performed by Gregory Smith. Smith also arranged the music for Disneyland&#x27;s &quot;Remember... Dreams Come True&quot; show (which also contains a snippet of the original Don Dorsey arrangement, which then concludes in a grand orchestral finale arranged by Smith) as well as &quot;&quot; fireworks shows.

The soundtrack to the parade has been released numerous times:
*&quot;Main Street Electrical Parade&quot; (1973 soundtrack) (Disneyland Park, Disneyland Resort)
*&quot;Main Street Electrical Parade&quot; (1977 soundtrack) (Disneyland and Magic Kingdom)
*&quot;The Music of Disney: A Legacy in Song&quot; (1992) (Disneyland Park, Disneyland Resort)
*&quot;Fantasmic!: Good Clashes with Evil in a Nighttime Spectacular&quot; (1992) (Disneyland Park, Disneyland Resort)
*&quot;Classic Disney Volume II: 60 Years of Musical Magic&quot; (1995) (Disneyland Park, Disneyland Resort)
*&quot;The Main Street Electrical Parade&quot; (1999 CD) (Magic Kingdom, Walt Disney World)
*&quot;Les Parades En Musique&quot; (2000 CD) (Disneyland Park, Disneyland Resort Paris)
*&quot;Disney&#x27;s Electrical Parade&quot; (2001 CD)
*&quot;Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade Dreamlights&quot; (2001 CD)
*&quot;Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade Dreamlights&quot; - Show Mix Edition (2001)
*&quot;Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade Dreamlights&quot; (2011 Renewal Version)
*&quot;A Musical History of Disneyland&quot; (Disneyland Park, Disneyland Resort)
*&quot;Walt Disney Records The Legacy Collection: Disneyland&quot; (2015)
*&quot;Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade Dreamlights ~2017 Renewal Version~&quot; (2017)
*&quot;Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade Dreamlights ~2023 Renewal Version~&quot; (2023)
Dorsey used 11 synthesizers to create the soundtrack: Moog Model III, Minimoog, Steiner-Parker Synthacon, Oberheim Eight Voice, Sequential Circuits Prophet-5, Fender Rhodes Piano, New England Digital Synclavier II, Bode 7702 Vocoder, Roland MKS-80 Super Jupiter, Yamaha DX7 and Yamaha TX7.

Starting in 1979, Wagner provides the synthesized vocoder voice for the intro and outro to the parade. Bill Rogers provided the synthesized vocoder announcement for the Disneyland version of the parade beginning in 2022. When the parade went to Disney California Adventure Park in 2001, the original Jack Wagner announcements for the Disneyland version of the parade were used as the basis for the announcements at the new park. Since the park does not have a Main Street (at that time), the announcements had to be updated with minor changes. These included the insertion of the words &quot;Disney&quot; and &quot;Disney&#x27;s&quot; to reflect that the show&#x27;s name had changed to Disney&#x27;s Electrical Parade. When the soundtrack was updated, the announcements were pitch-corrected, but were still based on the original Jack Wagner announcements from Disneyland.

While the original soundtrack is played solely on synthesizers, the Tokyo Disneyland version uses an orchestra with adult and youth choirs in addition to harmonies and synthesizers. This version also includes Character voices in both English and Japanese. This version was also orchestrated, programmed, conducted and performed by Gregory Smith. During the Christmas season at Tokyo Disneyland, the Electrical Parade gets a new soundtrack; it is mostly the same soundtrack with added Christmas songs, mixed in with the theme music. For Tokyo Disneyland&#x27;s 30th anniversary, a show stop was added to the parade, it includes a 2-minute Christmas melody; fireworks from Cinderella Castle are synced during the show stop as well. The showstop is only performed once a year as part of a private event for Disney/JCB Card holders. The last time this version did a holiday overlay was in 2019–2020. During the 2021 reopening, they opted out on the holiday overlay due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It&#x27;s unknown if they would do the overlay again. In 2023, the Holiday Overlay returned, to its full glory.

The 2009 version of Disney&#x27;s Electrical Parade at Disney&#x27;s California Adventure, its 2010 run at Magic Kingdom and its 2017, 2019 and 2022 runs at Disneyland utilize much of the soundtrack created for DreamLights, with new loops created for the Cinderella, Pinocchio, To Honor America (2009–2019), and &quot;it&#x27;s a small world&quot; units. However, the new soundtrack retains a more electronic sound than that of Tokyo&#x27;s in that many of the orchestral parts of the DreamLights soundtrack have been replaced by synthesizers in this version. Whereas the Magic Kingdom used a newly recorded vocoder introduction for its 2010 version of the parade, the original 1977 Jack Wagner introduction was pitch-corrected to match the updated soundtrack and integrated into Disneyland&#x27;s 2017 and 2019 versions of the parade. A new inclusive introduction that was both non-vocoded and vocoded was integrated in 2022 for its 50th anniversary at Disneyland by Bill Rogers. The vocoded part of the 2022 intro is expected to be the new, permanent introduction of the parade should it ever return following its 50th anniversary run.

The soundtrack for the Disneyland Paris “Disney Electrical Sky Parade” &quot;(credited by show director, Mabrouk Reguigui)&quot; was produced, arranged, and scored by American music producer and Disney composer, Rick McKee. This soundtrack tributes the original Paris version with a fresh overlay of modern production and classic scoring. The score also features themes from Aladdin, Brave, The Princess and the Frog, Coco, Moana, Mulan, Encanto, Raya and the Last Dragon, Hercules, and Toy Story. Various themes from the classic films were added as well—notably, McKee’s inclusion of “Candle on the Water” during the Pete’s Dragon drone unit.

<text>The European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) is a former European space research organisation. It was first developed in order to establish a satellite launch vehicle for Europe. The three-stage rocket developed was named Europa, after the mythical Greek goddess. Overall, there were 10 launches that occurred under ELDO&#x27;s funding. The organisation consisted of Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. Australia was an associate member of the organisation.

Initially, the launch site was in Woomera, Australia, but was later moved to the French site Kourou, in French Guiana. The programme was created to replace the Blue Streak Missile Programme after its cancellation in 1960. In 1974, after an unsuccessful satellite launch, the programme was merged with the European Space Research Organisation to form the European Space Agency.

==Origins==
After the failure to launch Britain&#x27;s Blue Streak Missile, Britain wished to use its finished space launch parts in order to cut losses. In 1961, Britain and France announced that they would be working together on a launcher that would be capable of sending a one-ton satellite into space. This cooperation was later drafted into the Convention of the European Launcher Development Organisation, which Italy, Belgium, West Germany, the Netherlands and Australia would join. Australia provided a sparsely populated site for missile launcher testing and development at Woomera, South Australia. The original intent of this organisation was to develop a space programme exclusively for Europe, excluding the UN or any outside country.
==History==
The initial plans for the rocket were proposed in 1962. The rocket created was called the &quot;ELDO-A&quot;, later renamed &quot;Europa-1&quot;. It measured in length and weighed more than 110 tons. &quot;Europa-1&quot; was planned to put a payload of – into a circular orbit above earth. The three stages consisted of the Blue Streak stage, the French Coralie stage, and the German stage. The first stage, the Blue Streak stage, was to fire for 160 seconds after launch. The second stage, the French Coralie stage, fired for the following 103 seconds. The third and final stage, the German stage, fired for an extra 361 seconds to launch the rocket into Earth&#x27;s lower orbit. The first stage was a development of Blue Streak and was built in Stevenage, Hertfordshire U.K.

In June 1964, the first stage, F1, had its first launch at Woomera, South Australia. By the middle of 1966, ELDO decided to change &quot;Europa-1&quot; from a three-stage launcher into a four-stage launcher that was capable of placing a satellite into geostationary transfer orbit. Following this decision, in 1969, many unsuccessful launches of Europa-1 and the resignation of Britain and Italy prompted a reconsideration of ideas. In 1970, ELDO was forced to cancel the Europa-1 programme.

By late 1970, the plans for &quot;Europa-2&quot; were created. &quot;Europa-2&quot; was a similarly designed rocket with an extra stage added in. The funding for &quot;Europa-2&quot; was supplied 90% by France and Germany. On November 5, 1971, &quot;Europa-2&quot; was launched for the first time, but unsuccessfully. The failure of the rocket led to the consideration of a &quot;Europa-3&quot; rocket design. However, &quot;Europa-3&quot; was never created and the lack of funding prompted the merging of the European Launcher Development Organisation and the European Space Research Organisation to form the European Space Agency.

===Australian downrange tracker===

The Gove Down Range Guidance and Telemetry Station was built at Gulkula on the Gove Peninsula in the Northern Territory of Australia in the 1960s, to track the downrange path of rockets launched from the RAAF Woomera Range Complex in South Australia, with its state-of-the-art technology operated by mainly Belgian scientists. The satellite tracker was moved back up to the Gove Peninsula in September 2020 by the local historical society, after spending years in storage at Woomera.

==Launches==

Overall, the European Launcher Development Organisation planned eleven launches, only ten of which actually occurred. Of the nine actual launches, four were successful. Four other launches were unsuccessful and there was one launch that was terminated. The first launch, F-1, occurred on 5 June 1964 which tested only the first stage of the launch and was successful. Both F-2 and F-3, which occurred on 20 October 1964 and 22 March 1965 on their respective dates tested only the first stage once again and were both successful. The fourth launch, F-4, occurred on 24 May 1966. This launch tested only the first stage of the rocket with a dummy stage 2 and 3. This flight was terminated 136 seconds into flight. The fifth launch, F-5, took place on 13 November 1966. This launch aimed to complete the same task as F-4 and was successful. The sixth launch, F-6/1, took place on 4 August 1967. This launch had an active first and second stage with a dummy third stage and satellite. On this launch, the second stage did not ignite and was unsuccessful. The seventh launch, F-6/2, took place on 5 December 1967. It aimed to do the same objective as F-6/1, but the first and second stages did not separate. The eighth launch, F-7, took place on 30 November 1968. On this launch, all three stages were active and a satellite was fitted. After the second stage ignited, the third stage exploded. The ninth launch, F-8, occurred on 3 July 1969 and aimed to do the same thing as F-7, but ended the same way. The tenth launch, F-9, occurred on 12 June 1970 and had all stages active with a satellite fitted. In this launch, all stages were successful, yet the satellite failed to orbit. After this launch, ELDO began losing funds and members and was eventually phased into the ESRO to create the ESA.

After F-10 was cancelled, it was decided that Woomera launch site was not suitable for putting satellites into geosynchronous orbit. In 1966, it was decided to move to the French site of Kourou in South America. France planned to launch F-11, on which &quot;Europa-2&quot; launched off into the sky. However, thanks to the static discharge from the fairings travelling down to the third stage sequencer and inertial navigation computer, they cause it to hang and malfunction; signalling the range safety officer to destroy it. The launch of F12 was postponed whilst a project review was carried out, which led to the decision to abandon the Europa design.

<text>Ellen Muth (; born March 6, 1981) is a retired American actress best known for her role as Georgia &quot;George&quot; Lass in Showtime&#x27;s series &quot;Dead Like Me&quot; (2003–2004 series, 2009 film).

==Early life==
Muth was born in Milford, Connecticut, to Eric (a military veteran) and Rachel Muth.

As of 2004, Muth was a member of Intertel and Mensa, high-IQ societies. She attended the Skip Barber Racing School and the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute.

==Career==
After a brief stint as a model with Ford Models and Rascal&#x27;s Agency, Muth pursued a career in acting, studying at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute in New York City, and getting her first professional experience doing commercials in 1993. Her first major role was in the 1995 film &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot;. She followed that with a role in the eighth-season premiere of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;.

Muth&#x27;s appearance as the daughter in the 1999 film &quot;The Young Girl and the Monsoon&quot; earned praise from Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; for her range in portraying a character &quot;who one minute can be as clinging as a baby and the next delights in cruelly demolishing the nearest grownup with laser-like sarcasm&quot; and her chemistry &quot;whenever Constance (who narrates the film) is on the screen with her father Hank (Terry Kinney)&quot;.

Her 2000 work included appearances in episodes of &quot;The Beat&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, as well as a role in The American Collection adaptation of &quot;Cora Unashamed&quot;, a short story by Langston Hughes from his 1934 collection &quot;The Ways of White Folks&quot;. Muth also had a guest role in &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask&quot;, the original unaired pilot episode of the 2000 Fox show that eventually aired as &quot;Normal, Ohio&quot;. The show&#x27;s revamp eliminated her role. That year, Muth played the lead in the Lifetime Original Movie &quot;The Truth About Jane&quot; about a high school girl&#x27;s struggle with her sexuality and acceptance.

Muth starred in the 2003–04 Showtime television series &quot;Dead Like Me&quot; in the role of Georgia &quot;George&quot; Lass, the protagonist and one of a team of grim reapers.

Muth&#x27;s next roles were lower in profile. She appeared in &quot;Jack &#x27;n&#x27; Jill&quot;, a 2007 MFA thesis film. She voiced the character of Addie Vost in the first animated short of &quot;Tofu the Vegan Zombie&quot; and a character in the audio dramatization &quot;Anne Manx in the Empress Blair Project&quot;. In September 2008 she joined three other actors at the Theatre Artist Workshop in Norwalk, Connecticut, in a reading of &quot;Fleece the Flock&quot;, an original musical comedy in development and directed by Joel Vig.

After some delay, &quot;Dead Like Me: Life After Death&quot;, a film directed by Stephen Herek based on &quot;Dead Like Me&quot; and featuring many members of the show&#x27;s cast, including Muth, was released direct-to-video in March 2009.

In 2012, Muth returned to the big screen in the romantic comedy &quot;Margarine Wars&quot; alongside Robert Loggia and Doris Roberts. The film debuted in Los Angeles on March 29, 2012.

In 2013, Muth made a guest appearance in two episodes of the first season of the TV series &quot;Hannibal&quot;, produced by Bryan Fuller, the creator of &quot;Dead Like Me&quot;.

In a 2015 interview, Muth confirmed that she had &quot;hit the pause button on the acting&quot; part of her life.

==Awards and nominations==
Muth shared a best supporting actress award at the 1995 Tokyo International Film Festival for her screen debut in &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot;. In 1999 she won the American Film Institute (AFI) Best Actress Award for &quot;The Young Girl and the Monsoon&quot;.

In 2004, Muth&#x27;s work on &quot;Dead Like Me&quot; received two nominations: for a Saturn Award in the Best Actress in a Television Series category and for a Satellite Award in the category of Best Performance by an Actress in a Drama series.

==Filmography==

===Television===
==Personal life==
Muth has withdrawn from public life since her 2013 appearances on &quot;Hannibal&quot;, instead concentrating on a coffee business she launched and a cat-breeding business as of the early 2020s. Saying she eventually wanted &quot;to settle down and have a family of my own&quot;, Muth told a relaxed-lifestyle website in December 2015 that she had &quot;hit the pause button on the acting for now.&quot;

<doc id="1009473" wikidata="Q1339598" url="?curid=1009473" title="Peavey Electronics">
<text>Peavey Electronics Corporation is a privately-owned American company which designs, develops, manufactures, and markets professional audio equipment. Headquartered in Meridian, Mississippi, Peavey is one of the largest audio equipment manufacturers in the world.

==History==
Hartley Peavey &quot;dreamed of becoming a rock star,&quot; having built his first amplifier in 1957. He founded Peavey Electronics in 1965.
Peavey Electronics once owned approximately of warehouse space across North America, Europe and Asia. However, the vast majority of their products have been manufactured overseas since 2004. 

In 2014, Peavey closed its U.K. distribution and manufacturing operations, citing the fact that the lower cost and advanced techniques of Chinese manufacturing had rendered it unsustainable. That same year, Peavey closed its A Street plant in Meridian, Mississippi, and laid off nearly 100 employees. In 2019, Peavey laid off another 30 employees at its U.S. office/warehouse.

==Products==
Peavey Electronics owns eight brands: MediaMatrix, Architectural Acoustics, PVDJ, Crest Audio, Composite Acoustic, Sanctuary Series, Budda Amplification, and Trace Elliot. The company still holds 180 patents, and at one time its product range boasted more than 2000 designs. Although Peavey Electronics produces a wide variety of equipment, a few designs stand out as a result of their popularity or use by prominent professionals.

===5150, 6505, 6534+ series guitar amplifiers===
The 5150 series of amplifier speaker cabinets were the result of a collaboration with Eddie Van Halen. The 5150 series was preceded by the VTM-60/VTM-120 amps, among the first &quot;non-hot rodded&quot; amps. The 5150 has gained popularity with modern hard rock, hardcore punk and metal bands and guitarists due to its large amount of distortion. Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains used this amplifier before he worked with Friedman Amplification on a signature amp. While touring with Van Halen, Cantrell asked Eddie Van Halen, &quot;if I could buy [one] off him at the end of the tour with them, and when I got home there were three full stacks and two guitars waiting for me.&quot; In 2004, Peavey and Eddie Van Halen parted ways, with Eddie taking the 5150 brand name with him. This resulted in the renaming of the amplifier as the &#x27;Peavey 6505&#x27;, with slightly updated styling but original circuitry. The 5150 II, which contains an extra preamp tube for more headroom and gain on the Rhythm channel, is the old equivalent to the new 6505+. In 2010, Peavey released a new amplifier for the 6505 line, the 6534+. It is much like the 6505+, but the 6534 has EL34 power tubes instead of the 6L6 power tubes on the standard 6505 amplifiers.

===Bandit series guitar amplifiers===
The Bandit amp series are solid-state combo guitar amplifiers. The Bandit amplifiers were introduced in 1980. The earliest model Bandits had a power rating of 50 watts RMS into an 8 ohm speaker. The power rating has gradually increased over time, and current model Bandits are rated at 80 watts RMS into 8 ohms, and 100 watts RMS into 4 ohms. In the mid-1990s, the Bandit was used to introduce Peavey&#x27;s proprietary TransTube circuitry, a solid-state technology aimed at emulating the sound of tube amplifiers. In 2023, &quot;Guitar Player&quot; listed it as their favorite solid state amplifier under $500, and praised its &quot;heroic reliability&quot;.

====Bandit models====

===Classic series guitar amplifiers===

Peavey&#x27;s line of guitar amplifiers made specifically for blues, jazz, and classic rock players. The original Classic series amplifiers were introduced in the 1970s (and were originally called the Peavey &#x27;Vintage&#x27; series which the first releases used 6C10 tubes in the pre-amp, NOT solid State. 6C10 amps have a Presence knob, not a Master. Vintage Series changed to a solid state pre-amp &amp; a Master Volume (which is the easy way to tell if the amp has 6C10 pre-amp or not without removing the back panel to access the chassis), the solid state preamps and 6L6GC power tubes. The Original 2–12 Vintage is 100 watts, whereas the 6–10 and the 1–15 are only 50 watts The original Classic was a 50 watt amp and two 12-inch speakers and a spring reverb, with two preamps for &quot;clean&quot; and &quot;distortion&quot; channels. They could be used separately, or by plugging the instrument into the &quot;parallel&quot; connection, which fed both preamps, allowing selection of one from the other using a foot switch. The instrument could also be plugged into the &quot;series&quot; connection, running first through the &quot;clean&quot; channel and feeding that into the &quot;distortion&quot; channel, providing a means of over driving the distortion preamp, creating a much more versatile method of producing distortion. The current line of &quot;Classic&quot; series amplifiers consist of three variations of the &quot;Classic&quot; model, the Classic 30 with a single 12-inch speaker and the Classic 50 with two twelve-inch speakers or four ten-inch speakers. There are two variations of the &quot;Delta Blues&quot; model, the Delta Blues with one fifteen-inch speaker or two ten-inch speakers. They use 12AX7 preamp tubes, EL84 power tubes, and have spring reverb tanks. From 1994 to 1997, a 15 watts amp with a 10 inches speaker was also produced, the Peavey Classic 20.

===CS series power amplifiers===
The CS series amplifiers (mainly the CS800) are some of the most used amplifiers in the world, and among Peavey&#x27;s best selling products.

===JSX series guitar amplifiers===
The JSX series was designed for Joe Satriani. Satriani was looking for an amplifier that was customized to his style, had every feature he required, and would work in both live and studio applications. This amplifier was reissued as the Peavey XXX II when Joe Satriani&#x27;s endorsement ended, since the original XXX platform was used as starting point for the design of the JSX series.

===Radial Pro Series of drum kits===
The Radial Pro Series were Peavey&#x27;s high end drum line. In production from 1994 until 2002, it consisted of the RBS-1 prototypes, radial pro 1000, 750/751, and 500/501 models. The flagship 1000 model consisted of a radial bridge that took all the mounting stresses, and a 3-ply thin maple shell to enhance the resonance. The 750/751 series had composite bridges and stained 4-ply thin maple shells. The 500/501 series had composite bridges and wrapped 5-ply North American thin hickory shells.

===Triple XXX/3120 series guitar amplifiers===
The basis for the JSX series, the XXX series provides a tonal range from what some call &quot;glassy&quot; cleans, to &quot;full body&quot; hi-gain tones using its 3 channel interface. The 3120 series came later but was the same amp as the first edition XXX. Originally, the Peavey XXX was set to become recording artist George Lynch&#x27;s signature model but the deal never finalized.

===ValveKing series guitar amplifiers===
The ValveKing included the Royal 8, Micro Head, VK20 Combo, 112 Combo, 212 Combo, 100 Head and matching speaker cabinets. The first generation ValveKing&#x27;s were available approximately 2005–2013, then there was a second generation with a different look and some new features which eventually was discontinued around 2018.

===Vypyr series guitar amplifiers===
The Vypyr series of amps are modeling amplifiers. They generate different amplifier sounds based on digital models of various popular amplifiers. The models include Fender twin and deluxe, Mesa/Boogie Rectifier, Diezel Boutique, Krank Krankenstein, Vox AC30—and a large collection of Peavey amps like the 6505, XXX, and JSX. In addition to these amp models, these amps feature 11 editable pre-amp effects (All But Vypyr 15), 11 editable rack effects, on-board looper (Vypyr 30, 60, 75, 100, 120), MIDI input (Vypyr 30, 60, 75, 100, 120), and USB 2.0 connectivity (Vypyr 60, 75, 100, 120). The battery powered &quot;Nano Vypyr&quot; was introduced in 2012 as a competitor against other small portable modeling amps like the Roland Micro Cube and Fender Mini-Mustang. The Vypyr 60 and Vypyr 120 amps as well as the Vypyr 120 head feature 12AX7 and 6L6GC tubes. In 2013, an enhanced line of Vypyr amps was released. Called the &quot;Vypyr VIP&quot; series (short for &quot;variable instrument input&quot;), the VIP 1, VIP 2, and VIP 3 retain all the programmed models of the original Vypyrs, but also possess the ability to serve as acoustic guitar amps, as well as bass guitar amps. They are also programmable by way of computer software link.

===TNT series bass amplifiers===
The TNT Series bass amplifier first entered the market in the late 1970s as a 45-watt combo with one 15-inch speaker. The high-power TNT bass amplifier series was introduced as a 150–200 watt bass combo primarily equipped with a Scorpion or Black Widow 15-inch woofer. The TNT series was recently updated to 600 watts, under the title Peavey Tour TNT 115. It is currently the most powerful bass combo sold by Peavey.

===400BH Series Bass Amplifiers===
The 400 BH power amp module was used in a range of bass amps during the early 1980s, commencing with the MKIII Bass Head in 1979.

The MKIV Bass Amp head unit, introduced in 1981, offers a range of functions. It is air cooled, features protection circuitry, and is capable of around 300/350 watts RMS safely into 2 ohms. The 2 ohm load rating is very stable (this amp actually operates at less than 2 ohms), enabling the use of multiple mix and match speaker systems to improve acoustic efficiency and sound stage options. In contrast, typical modern musical instrument amps are usually limited to 4 ohms speaker systems. Circuit board layout is conservative, easy to access, repair or modify. Dynamics and reliability are excellent. Its only weak point is that the preamp and power amp modules are installed in the chipboard cabinet with lack of electromagnetic shielding, resulting in a need to physically separate the amp head from bass pickups and speakers.

===Windsor series guitar amplifiers===
Introduced as a low-cost clone of the vaunted Marshall JCM800 2203 Master Volume. The internal design is essentially identical to the vintage Marshall, with the exception of using a plate-fed tone stack instead of the Marshall-trademarked cathode-follower-based circuitry.

===Wolfgang and HP2 series electric guitars===
These were a result of a collaboration with Eddie Van Halen to produce his &quot;ideal&quot; guitar. The design was relatively successful, but did not gain the reputation or popularity of similarly priced guitars such as the Fender Stratocaster or the Gibson Les Paul. The Peavey Wolfgang was discontinued in 2004. Peavey re-introduced the Wolfgang as the HP2 during the 2017 Summer NAMM Show.

The VT series was also popular in the late 1970s to early 1980s. Gary Rossington from Lynyrd Skynyrd played the Mace-VT. There was the Deuce-VT, the Mace&#x27;s little brother, and a Classic VT. The Mace and Deuce were the same amp but the Mace had six 6l6gc output tubes and the other only 4. Hence the Mace was 160 watts and the Deuce 120 watts

==Controversy==
In February 2015, the company was featured on an episode of the CBS television show &quot;Undercover Boss&quot;. Chief Operating Officer Courtland Gray made visits to a company store and manufacturing plant in disguise, with the founder communicating to him through a hidden earpiece. Before the episode aired, the creator of &quot;Undercover Boss&quot; issued an unprecedented statement indicating something &quot;unfortunate happened after filming&quot;. Peavey Electronics, citing global competitive pressures, partially closed down the same plant featured in the episode. The employees at the manufacturing plant featured in the episode felt betrayed by the move. The company said these moves were necessary to remain competitive against rivals who were already manufacturing in lower-cost locations.

==Legal cases==
In 2009, Peavey Electronics Corp. filed two lawsuits against various companies under the Behringer/Music Group umbrella for patent infringement, federal and common law trademark infringement, false designation of origin, trademark dilution, and unfair competition.

In 2011, Music Group filed suit in the US District Court against Peavey Electronics Corporation for &quot;false advertising, false patent marking and unfair competition&quot;. In making these allegations, the Music Group cited an ongoing investigation of its own initiation that assessed Peavey products with regard to US patent laws and FCC regulations.

In April 2014, Peavey Electronics Corporation was fined (equivalent to $ in ) by the FCC for violating digital device laws by not including required labeling and marketing statements in their owner&#x27;s manuals. 

On December 10, 2020, Christian Sanchez filed a complaint in New York Federal court against Peavey Electronics Corporation. Plaintiff Christian Sanchez alleges that their site is not accessible per the WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2.1 accessibility standard(s).

<text>Abigail Loraine Hensel and Brittany Lee Hensel (born March 7, 1990) are American conjoined twins. They are dicephalic parapagus twins (having two heads joined to one torso), and are highly symmetric for conjoined twins. Each has a heart, stomach, spine, pair of lungs, and spinal cord. Each twin controls one arm and one leg. When they were infants, learning to crawl, walk, and clap required cooperation. They can eat and write separately and simultaneously. Activities such as running, swimming, hair-brushing, playing piano or volleyball, riding a bicycle, or driving a car require coordination.

The twins&#x27; lives have been covered in the popular media, including &quot;Life&quot; magazine and &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. They were interviewed on The Learning Channel in December 2006, discussing their daily lives and future plans. They starred in their own reality television series, &quot;Abby &amp; Brittany&quot;, on TLC in 2012.

Since 2013, the two have been teachers in Minnesota.

==Background==
The twins were born in Carver County, Minnesota, to Patty, a registered nurse, and Mike Hensel, a carpenter and landscaper. They have a younger brother and sister. They were raised in New Germany, Minnesota, attended Mayer Lutheran High School in Mayer, Minnesota, and graduated from Bethel University in St. Paul in 2012.

==Physiology and coordination==
The twins have a single body with separate heads and necks, a chest that is wider than average, two arms, and two legs. At birth, they had a rudimentary arm between the bases of their necks attached to a shoulder blade at the back. It was removed, leaving the shoulder blade.

Abby&#x27;s head tilts laterally outward about 5 degrees to the right, while Brittany&#x27;s tilts laterally at about 15 degrees to the left, causing her to appear shorter even when seated. Brittany&#x27;s leg is nearly two inches shorter than Abby&#x27;s, and Brittany tends to stand and walk on tip-toe which has made her calf muscle significantly larger than Abby&#x27;s. The continued growth of Abby&#x27;s spine was surgically halted after Brittany prematurely stopped growing. At age 12, they underwent surgery at Gillette Children&#x27;s Specialty Healthcare to correct scoliosis and to expand their chest cavity to prevent breathing trouble.

Each twin manages one side of their conjoined body. The sense of touch of each is restricted to her body half; this shades off at the midsagittal plane, so that there is a small amount of overlap at the midline. Stomach aches, however, are felt only by the twin on the opposite side. They cooperatively use their limbs when both hands or both legs are required. By coordinating their efforts, they walk, run, swim, play volleyball and the piano, and ride a bicycle normally. Together, they can type on a computer keyboard and drive a car. As teenagers the twins passed their driver&#x27;s license exams separately because, although driving requires coordination between them, state law required that they each be licensed. Abby controls the devices on the right side of the driver&#x27;s seat; Brittany, those on the left. Together they control the steering wheel. Abby, at , is taller and longer of leg than Brittany, who is and their disparate heights cause difficulty in some activities, for example balancing a Segway, as shown in their 2012 reality series.

===Organ distribution===
The twins have individual organs in the upper part of their body, while most of those at and below the navel are shared, the exception being the spinal cord.

*2 heads
*2 spines merging at the coccyx and joined at the thorax by sections of ribs. Surgery corrected scoliosis.
*2 completely separate spinal cords
*2 arms (originally 3, but the rudimentary central arm was removed, leaving the central shoulder blade in place)
*1 broad ribcage with 2 highly fused sternums and traces of bridging ribs. Surgery expanded the pleural cavities.
*2 breasts
*2 hearts in a shared circulatory system (nutrition, respiration, and medicine taken by either affects both)
*4 lungs with the medial lungs moderately fused, not involving Brittany&#x27;s upper right lobe; three pleural cavities
*1 diaphragm with well coordinated involuntary breathing, slight central defect
*2 stomachs
*2 gallbladders
*1 liver, enlarged and elongated right lobe
*Y-shaped small intestine, with slightly spastic double peristalsis at the juncture
*1 large intestine (one colon, rectum, and anus)
*3 kidneys: 2 left, 1 right
*1 bladder
*1 set of reproductive organs
*2 separate half-sacrums, which converge distally
*1 slightly broad pelvis
*2 legs

===Separation surgery declined===
Upon their birth, the twins&#x27; parents decided not to attempt surgical separation after hearing from doctors that it was unlikely that both would survive the operation. As the twins grew and learned to walk and develop other skills, their parents confirmed their decision against separation, arguing that the quality of life for the surviving twin or twins living separately would be less than their quality of life as conjoined people.

==Adulthood==
Dicephalic parapagus twins rarely survive into adulthood. The Hensel sisters did and both graduated from high school in 2008 and began college at Bethel University in Arden Hills, Minnesota, majoring in education. They had considered pursuing different concentrations within that major, but the volume of extra coursework was prohibitive. They each graduated with Bachelor of Arts degrees in 2012.

Some of the twins&#x27; clothes are altered by a seamstress so that they have two separate necklines, in order to emphasize their individuality. They usually have separate meals, but sometimes share a single meal for the sake of convenience. For tasks such as responding to email, they type and respond as one, anticipating each other&#x27;s feelings with little verbal communication between them. Their choice of grammatical person is to use &quot;I&quot; when they agree, and to use their names when their responses differ.

They dislike being stared at or photographed by strangers while going about their private lives. In interviews for the Discovery Channel in 2006 at the age of 16, they said that they hoped to date, get married, and have children. They also stated that they hoped that by providing some information about themselves, they would be able to lead otherwise fairly typical social lives.

The two became teachers in 2013, and as of 2024 they continue to teach fifth grade at Sunnyside Elementary in New Brighton, Minnesota. In 2021, Abby married Josh Bowling.

==Media appearances==
The twins appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; on April 8 and 29, 1996. During the same month, they were featured on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; under the caption &quot;One Body, Two Souls&quot;, and their daily lifestyle was described in the article, &quot;The Hensels&#x27; Summer&quot;. &quot;Life&quot; followed up with another story in September 1998. In 2002, they appeared in &quot;Joined for Life&quot;, a TV documentary by Advanced Medical Productions, distributed on the Discovery Health Channel and a 2003 follow-up, &quot;Joined at Birth&quot;.

In 2003, an updated story of them at age 11 (filmed in 2001) was published in &quot;Time&quot; and again in &quot;Life&quot;. ABC TV also did a documentary called &quot;Joined for Life&quot;. A UK television special in 2005 was part of the series &quot;Extraordinary People&quot;. In 2006, Advanced Medical made another documentary, &quot;Joined for Life: Abby &amp; Brittany turn 16&quot;, that discusses their adolescence, school, social life, and activities such as getting their driver&#x27;s licenses.

The twins starred in the TLC reality TV show &quot;Abby &amp; Brittany&quot; that was shown in the US from August to October 2012. It was shown by the BBC in the UK in April and May 2013 and covers the period from their finishing college to starting a part-time teaching job.

<text>Terry&#x27;s Chocolate Orange is a chocolate product with orange flavour created by Terry&#x27;s in 1932 at Terry&#x27;s Chocolate Works in York, England. The brand has changed ownership several times, and production was moved to Poland in 2005. Since 2018, the Terry&#x27;s Chocolate Orange has been produced in Strasbourg, France, by Carambar &amp; Co.

==Development==

Chemist Joseph Terry joined a York sweets company in 1823, where he developed new lines of chocolate, candied peel, and marmalade. In 1830 he became sole owner of the business and following his death it was eventually passed to his sons, including Joseph Jr. who managed the company. In 1895 it became Joseph Terry and Sons Ltd., with directors including Joseph Jr. and his own son Thomas.
The company opened the Art Deco-style factory known as Terry&#x27;s Chocolate Works in 1926, and began launching new products. These included the Dessert Chocolate Apple (1926), Terry&#x27;s All Gold (1931) and the Chocolate Orange (1932).

At the onset of World War II, confectionery production was immediately halted. The factory was taken over by F. Hills and Sons of Manchester as a shadow factory to manufacture and repair aircraft propeller blades. With the factory handed back to the company post-war, production was difficult due to continued rationing in the United Kingdom, and limited imports of raw cocoa. In 1954, production of the chocolate apple was phased out in favour of increased production of the chocolate orange. In 1979, Terry&#x27;s launched the Chocolate Lemon, but it was withdrawn three years later.
In the North American market, where it has had a variety of importers over the years, it was briefly sold as a Tobler (maker of the Toblerone) product.

Chocolate oranges appeared on the South Korean market in the GS25 chain of convenience stores in 2017.

2005 saw the closure of the Terry&#x27;s factory in York, and Chocolate Orange manufacturing was moved to continental Europe by then-owner Kraft Foods. Following the 2016 sale of the brand by Mondelez (one of two successor companies to Kraft Foods Inc., the other being Kraft Foods Group Inc.) to investment company Eurazeo, manufacture was consolidated in 2018 in Strasbourg, France, as a product of Carambar &amp; Co.
 The company says that global sales of Terry&#x27;s Chocolate Oranges doubled from 2019 to 2022, including a tripling of sales in the United States, for a total of 44 million Oranges annually, in countries including the UK, Ireland, the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.

==Structure==

The Terry&#x27;s Chocolate Orange comprises an orange-shaped ball of chocolate mixed with orange oil, divided into 20 segments, similar to a real orange, and wrapped in orange-skin patterned foil. When packaged, the segments are stuck together firmly in the centre; therefore, prior to unwrapping, the ball is traditionally tapped severely on a hard surface to cause the segments to separate from each other (dubbed &quot;Tap and Unwrap&quot; or &quot;Whack and Unwrap&quot;).

===Spin-offs===
There have been a number of spin-off products, currently including:
*Chocolate Orange bar: a bar of six segments, initially produced with smooth vertical segments (similar to a Toblerone bar), then, later, with textured segments that mimic those of the traditional orange shape.
*Chocolate Orange minis: a bag of small segments
*Chocolate Orange White Eggs: egg-shaped white chocolate versions of Chocolate Orange that are available at Easter
*Segsations: individual segments of chocolate in different flavours, including: milk chocolate, puffed rice, honeycomb, cornflake and a &quot;double seg&quot; of layered milk and dark chocolate, all flavoured with orange oil.
*Segsations Mini Eggs: individual foil-wrapped eggs of chocolate in same flavours as Segsations that are available at Easter
*Chocolate Orange – Egg &amp; Spoon: a milk chocolate egg filled with an orange fondant filling (similar to Cadbury&#x27;s Creme Egg)
*Chocolate Mint: A mint-flavoured version of the Chocolate Orange.

== Advertising ==
The Chocolate Orange product is known for its unusual marketing, which is usually at its heaviest around Christmas. At one time it was estimated that the Chocolate Orange was found in a tenth of British Christmas stockings. Actress Dawn French has fronted numerous campaigns for the brand, often in a posed scene of defending and hiding &quot;her&quot; Chocolate Orange from others. Famous marketing phrases include:
*Tap it and unwrap it (since replaced with &quot;whack and unwrap&quot;)
*It&#x27;s not Terry&#x27;s, it&#x27;s mine
*Don&#x27;t tap it... Whack it!
French was dropped from advertising in 2007 due to a corporate rebrand.

More recent advertisements (after the rebranding) do not feature French and contain the new slogan &quot;Round but not round for long&quot; (some include the &quot;Countdown&quot; timer music). The newest advertising campaign in the United Kingdom features various situations in which people are trying to break the segments of their Terry&#x27;s Chocolate Orange apart with the slogan &quot;Smash it to pieces, love it to bits&quot;.

A new advert in 2020, featuring voiceover by Brian Blessed, explains how the Chocolate Orange is a catalyst for &quot;British Unsquaredness&quot;, along with a new slogan, &quot;Deliciously Unsquare&quot;.

In 2023, Terry&#x27;s launched a stop-motion animated advertising campaign centred around a group of eccentric characters called the &quot;Board of Unsquare&quot;, to promote the Chocolate Mint, and later, the Chocolate Milk ball.

== Changes to product weight in 2016 ==
On 29 May 2016, the UK product size was reduced from 175g to 157g (or 147g in Canada) by changing the moulded shape of each segment to leave an air gap between each piece. Despite this, the price doubled in some retail outlets.

<text>Six Characters in Search of an Author ( ) is an Italian play by Luigi Pirandello, written and first performed in 1921. An absurdist metatheatric play about the relationship among authors, their characters, and theatre practitioners, it premiered at the Teatro Valle in Rome to a mixed reception, with shouts from the audience of &quot;&quot;Manicomio&quot;!&quot; (&quot;Madhouse!&quot;) and &quot;&quot;Incommensurabile&quot;!&quot; (&quot;Off the scale!&quot;), a reaction to the play&#x27;s illogical progression. Reception improved at subsequent performances, especially after Pirandello provided for the play&#x27;s third edition, published in 1925, a foreword clarifying its structure and ideas.

The play was given in an English translation in the West End of London in February 1922, and had its American premiere in October of that year at the Princess Theatre, New York.

*The Father
*The Mother

*The Boy

*Madame Pace
*The Manager/Director
*Leading Lady
*Leading Man

==Synopsis==
An acting company prepares to rehearse the play &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; by Luigi Pirandello. As the rehearsal is about to begin, they are unexpectedly interrupted by the arrival of six strange people. The Director of the play, furious at the interruption, demands an explanation. The Father explains that they are unfinished characters in search of an author to finish their story. The Director initially believes them to be mad, but as they begin to argue among themselves and reveal details of their story, he begins to listen. The Father and The Mother had one child together (The Son), but they have separated and Mother has had three children by another man – The Stepdaughter, The Boy and The Child (a girl). The Father attempted to buy sex from The Stepdaughter, claiming he did not recognize her after so many years, but The Stepdaughter is convinced he knew who she was the entire time. The Mother walked in on The Father and The Stepdaughter shortly after The Father&#x27;s proposal and informs The Stepdaughter that he is her ex-husband; they both express their disgust and outrage. While The Director is not an author, he agrees to stage their story despite disbelief among the jeering actors.

After a 20-minute break, The Characters and The Company return to the stage to perform some of the story so far. They begin to perform the scene between The Stepdaughter and The Father in Madame Pace&#x27;s shop, which the Director decides to call Scene I. The Characters are very particular about the setting, wanting everything to be as realistic as possible. The Director asks The Actors to observe the scene because he intends for them to perform it later. This sparks the first argument between The Director and The Characters over the acting of the play because The Characters had assumed that they would be performing it, seeing as they are The Characters already. The Director continues the play, but The Stepdaughter has more problems with the accuracy of the setting, saying she doesn&#x27;t recognize the scene. Just as The Director is about to begin the scene once more, he realizes that Madame Pace is not with them. The Actors watch in disbelief as The Father lures her to the stage by hanging their coats and hats on racks, and Madame Pace follows, &quot;attracted by the very articles of her trade&quot;.
The scene begins between Madame Pace and The Stepdaughter, with Madame Pace exhorting The Stepdaughter, telling her she must work as a prostitute to save The Mother&#x27;s job. The Mother protests at having to watch the scene, but she is restrained. After The Father and The Stepdaughter act half of the scene, The Director stops them so that The Actors may perform what they have just done. The Characters break into laughter as The Actors try to imitate them. The Actors continue but The Stepdaughter cannot contain her laughter as The Actors use the wrong tones of voice and gestures. The Father begins another argument with The Director over the realism of The Actors compared to The Characters themselves. The Director allows The Characters to perform the rest of the scene and decides to have the rehearsals later.

This time, The Stepdaughter explains the rest of the scene during an argument with The Director over the truth on stage. The scene culminates in an embrace between The Father and The Stepdaughter, which is realistically interrupted by the distressed Mother. The line between reality and acting is blurred as the scene closes with The Director pleased with the first act.

The final act of the play begins in the garden. It is revealed that there was much arguing among the family members as The Father sent for The Mother, The Stepdaughter, The Child, The Boy, and The Son to come back and stay with him. The Son reveals that he hates the family for sending him away and does not consider The Stepdaughter or the others a part of his family. The scene ends with The Child drowning in a fountain, The Boy committing suicide with a revolver, and The Stepdaughter running out of the theater, leaving The Son, The Mother, and The Father on stage. The play ends with The Director confused over whether it was real or not, concluding that in either case he lost a whole day over it.

==Productions==

<text>Mr. 3000 is a 2004 American sports comedy film directed by Charles Stone III. It stars Bernie Mac and Angela Bassett. The film&#x27;s plot surrounds a retired Major League Baseball player who makes a comeback at age 47 in order to attain 3,000 hits. &quot;Mr. 3000&quot; received mixed reviews from critics and was a box-office flop, grossing $21 million worldwide against a $30 million budget.

==Plot==
Stan Ross is the conceited star player of the Milwaukee Brewers baseball team. After recording his 3,000th hit, Ross immediately retires, leaving the team without one of its star players in the middle of the 1995 playoff race, showing every bit of disregard for his teammates&#x27; feelings that his decision will cost them the championship. During the next nine years, Ross uses his nickname as a business tool, owning several profitable properties under the name &quot;Mr. 3000&quot; that make him increasingly wealthy.

In 2004, the Brewers retire Ross&#x27; number to boost attendance for their now-struggling team. Although many fans do come to the ceremony, other players, including teammates and fellow stars Robin Yount, Cecil Cooper, and Paul Molitor, stay away. Only his best friend Anthony “Boca” Carter and a middle relief pitcher from his early days in the majors named Bill “Big Horse” Berelli attend, and the ex-pitcher chastises Ross for his arrogant attitude.

Ross learns that due to a clerical error (caused by a three-hit game suspended due to curfew being double counted), he retired with 2,997 hits instead of 3,000. The error also partially contributes to Ross not being voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame and makes his &quot;Mr. 3000&quot; marketing gimmick inaccurate. Ross seeks to return to the game at the age of 47 to get three more hits and salvage his legacy and reputation.

A top Brewers executive, citing the large attendance at Ross&#x27; number retirement ceremony and the fact that the Brewers are out of playoff contention, agrees to bring Ross back during the September roster expansion. The team&#x27;s younger players by contrast see him as a disgrace, and team superstar Rex &quot;T-Rex&quot; Pennebaker, who is pompous and arrogant like Ross, claims he is unneeded and too old to play. Longtime team manager Gus Panas refuses to so much as speak a word to Ross, and the local sportswriters take every opportunity to criticize him.

Despite his predictions to the contrary Ross struggles to regain his baseball form and winds up going hitless in his first 27 at-bats. His comeback is covered by television sportscaster Maureen &quot;Mo&quot; Simmons, who resumes a former romantic relationship with Ross. He gets two hits, including a home run, to increase his career total to 2,999.

Ross becomes a mentor to the younger players and urges Pennebaker to learn from his own mistakes and be a team player, so that Pennebaker will not end up like him – all alone. This inspires the Brewers to a late-season comeback and a respectable finish. Ross attempts to become serious with Simmons and make her a permanent part of his life, but she is reluctant to believe he is a changed man, particularly after he skips a team practice to go on national television with Jay Leno and soak in all the attention he is receiving.

In his last at-bat of the season, with a chance to finally claim his 3,000th hit, Ross has a vision of his earlier years when he was still in his prime and beloved by the team. It inspires him to sacrifice his last chance with a bunt instead so that the Brewers can win the game and finish third in their division. Although Ross never reaches the &quot;3,000&quot; milestone, his newfound generosity and attitude gets him inducted into the Hall of Fame. He renames his businesses &quot;Mr. 2,999&quot; and is last seen driving an ice cream truck with the slogan &quot;2,999 possible combinations!&quot;.

==Production==
Portions of the film were filmed at Marquette University High School, as well as Miller Park, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and at Zephyr Field in New Orleans, Louisiana.

John Travolta was initially offered the chance to play Stan Ross, but Travolta turned it down because he was busy doing promotional work for Qantas.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Mr. 3000&quot; garnered mixed reviews from critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert praised Bernie Mac for delivering a &quot;funny and kind of touching performance&quot; that&#x27;s believable, Bassett for infusing a &quot;convincing emotional spirit&quot; into her character and the film overall for sidestepping its sports comedy formula, saying &quot;to my surprise, it finds a variation.&quot; Anita Gates of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave praise to Stone III for directing a film that mixes &quot;laughter and meaning&quot; thanks to the &quot;bull&#x27;s eye-casting&quot; of his supporting players and Mac for crafting a multi-layered character, concluding that, &quot;[I]f there was any question about how well [Bernie] Mac&#x27;s charm, demonstrated in stand-up comedy and on his Fox sitcom, would play on the big screen, the news is good: no problem.&quot; Kevin Thomas from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised Mac for giving &quot;range and resonance&quot; to his title character and the filmmakers for being able to &quot;reconfigure[d] a sports movie plot to bring to it depth as well as laughter, and, better yet, made it unpredictable.&quot; He concluded that, &quot;&quot;Mr. 3000&quot; is good-looking and smooth, with a great soundtrack that communicates just how intoxicating the roar of the crowd can be to an athlete. But it&#x27;s more than the expected gleaming Hollywood production. The movie&#x27;s images of Stan grappling with his destiny all alone are at once easy to identify with and hard to shake off.&quot; Scott Tobias of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; said, &quot;Sputtering along on Mac&#x27;s sleepy improvisations, &quot;Mr. 3000&quot; volleys between the dumb, frat-house wackiness of &quot;Major League&quot; and the &quot;Wonder Bat&quot; schmaltz of &quot;The Natural&quot;, chasing the gags with a lame baseball-as-life message about playing for the right reasons.&quot; Marrit Ingman of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; said it pales in comparison to Stone III&#x27;s debut effort &quot;Drumline&quot;, in terms of that film&#x27;s &quot;amiability and no-nonsense moral center&quot;, and replacing it with numerous sports montages, &quot;lowbrow gags&quot; and &quot;lazy, shorthanded characterizations.&quot;

===Box office===
The film took over $8 million at the box office on its opening weekend. In all, it took $21,811,169 in the US and Canada, and a further $28,190 when it was released in Spain, for a global total of $21,839,377.

<doc id="1009520" wikidata="Q3438074" url="?curid=1009520" title="Rod Bruinooge">
<text>Rod E. Bruinooge (born May 6, 1973) is an Indigenous Canadian politician, businessman, and filmmaker. He was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Winnipeg South in the 2006 federal election, and was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and the Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians from 2006 until the fall of 2008.

Bruinooge is a member of the Conservative Party of Canada, and is an Indigenous Canadian of Métis descent. He retired from parliament at the 2015 federal election. Bruinooge became CEO of Eventride in May 2016. Bruinooge was later appointed the first Indigenous Film Commissioner for Manitoba in 2021. Later, Bruinooge was appointed the Chief Executive Officer of the Manitoba Research Network in 2024.

==Early life and career==
Bruinooge&#x27;s father originated from Wemeldinge, Netherlands. After moving to Canada, he married an Indigenous woman. Bruinooge himself was born in Thompson, Manitoba, and holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of Manitoba. He attended the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada&#x27;s 1993 leadership convention as a youth delegate, supporting Kim Campbell. Bruinooge became chief executive and president of Abject Modernity Internet Creations Ltd. in the late 1990s, and worked as a consultant.

Bruinooge has served as a director of the River View Health Centre and the Manitoba Children&#x27;s Museum, and has done organizational work for the Winnipeg Aboriginal Film and Video Festival and the North American Indigenous Games.

==&quot;The Stone&quot;==

Bruinooge developed an internet game/mystery entitled &quot;The Stone&quot; in 1995, and launched it as a consumer product in 1997. The game was strongly influenced by the Publius Enigma, a conceptual mystery involving hidden messages in the cover art of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Division Bell&quot; (1994). &quot;The Stone&quot; was profiled by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine in 1999 and has been featured in other international journals including USA Today and Entertainment weekly.

In February 1999, Bruinooge held a launch event at Time Square in New York City, where 999 copies of The Stone were handed out to guests. Significant media coverage of the launch occurred including CNN and other New York based news stations.

The Stone was completed in 2007 and Bruinooge was active in its final deployment.

==Film and television==

In September 2004, Bruinooge and co-director Scott Jaworski released a film entitled &quot;Stoners&quot;, covering the activities of an internet gaming community that emerged around &quot;The Stone&quot;. The film features several tracks from &quot;The Division Bell&quot; in its soundtrack, used with Pink Floyd&#x27;s permission.

Bruinooge started the Winnipeg International Film Festival in 2005, and was its executive director until February 2006. The festival including a screening of &quot;Stoners&quot; during its first year. Some in Winnipeg&#x27;s arts community believed it was inappropriate for Bruinooge to screen his own film, although it was screened out of competition.

In 2020 Bruinooge appeared in an episode of CBC&#x27;s Burden of Truth alongside Kristin Kreuk as a First Nation relative of recurring character Cody Chartrand (season 3, episode 4). Rod Bruinooge is a member of the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists union, (ACTRA) since 2019.

Bruinooge was appointed Interim-CEO for the provincial crown agency Manitoba Film and Music in 2021 and became Canada&#x27;s first Indigenous Film Commissioner at that time. During his career as Film Commissioner Bruinooge led a delegation of film industry and government officials on a mission to Los Angeles on the maiden voyage of Winnipeg&#x27;s first direct flight.

==Politician==

=== Candidate ===
Bruinooge was a frequent candidate for public office before his election in 2006. He first sought the provincial Progressive Conservative nomination for Riel in 2002, but withdrew when it became clear that the nomination date would be in flux for some time.

He later campaigned as the Conservative candidate for Winnipeg South in the 2004 federal election. One of his more creative campaign advertisements was a self-directed, fifteen-second promotional film entitled &quot;Big Tobacco&quot;, which compared Paul Martin&#x27;s efforts at government renewal to misleading tobacco advertising. The spot ran as a preview for Shrek 2 in some Winnipeg theatres.

Bruinooge was one of only three aboriginal candidates to run for the Conservative Party in the 2004 election. The Conservative Party has sometimes been depicted as hostile to aboriginal interests, and at one point in the campaign Bruinooge and party leader Stephen Harper were the targets of a protest by aboriginal activists, including David Chartrand of the Manitoba Métis Federation. Bruinooge finished second in the election against Liberal incumbent Reg Alcock.

Bruinooge sought the Conservative nomination for Winnipeg South for a second time in the spring of 2005, but lost to rival candidate Hugh McFadyen by a narrow margin. A few months later, he was defeated by McFadyen a second time in a contest for the provincial Progressive Conservative nomination in Fort Whyte. Once again, McFadyen won by a very narrow margin.

McFadyen resigned his federal nomination when he chose to run provincially, and Bruinooge was chosen as the Conservative candidate in his place. His candidacy was endorsed on January 18, 2006 by Vote Marriage Canada, a group which opposes same-sex marriage. Although Bruinooge is a member of the Manitoba Métis Federation, that organization endorsed Reg Alcock.

Bruinooge defeated Alcock by 111 votes on election day, in what most political observers described as a significant upset. Bruinooge was aided by a national trend toward his party, as well as by Alcock&#x27;s decision to spend most of his time canvassing with Liberal candidates in other ridings.

=== Parliamentarian ===
The Conservatives won a minority government in the 2006 election. In early February 2006, Bruinooge was appointed parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and the Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians. He was the only Aboriginal member of the Government benches until Rob Clarke was elected on the byelections of March 17, 2008. In January 2007, he represented his government in signing a deal with Siemens that was designed to increase aboriginal employment.
During his tenure as Parliamentary Secretary Bruinooge was tasked with managing the enabling legislation for both the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada through the House of Commons and Committee. On June 11, 2008 during Canada&#x27;s official apology to the victims of Residential Schools, Bruinooge had the honour of being part of the official delegation walking into the House of Commons with the four Indigenous leaders and the Prime Minister.

At the Assembly of First Nations General Assembly in Nova Scotia in July 2007, Bruinooge described the Paul Martin government&#x27;s Kelowna Accord on aboriginal investment as nothing more than an &quot;expensive press release&quot;. This statement was strongly criticized by Assembly of First Nations leader Phil Fontaine. In the same month, Bruinooge vocally supported the Harper government&#x27;s efforts to place Canada&#x27;s Indian Act under the provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Some native groups have argued that the Human Rights Act&#x27;s focus on individual rights will undermine the communal rights of aboriginal communities.

Bruinooge was then tasked with managing the legislation providing First Nation reserves with access to the Canadian Human Rights Act. Though this Act started controversially, in the end Bruinooge was able to successfully negotiate with opposition parties and First Nation leaders to pass Bill C-21. First Nations child welfare advocate, Cindy Blackstock, then filed a claim on behalf of First Nations children to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal which only became valid after the passing of C-21. On April 3, 2023, after nearly 2 decades of effort, Blackstock would settle with the federal government for 23 Billion dollars on behalf on First Nations children impacted by the child welfare system, all due to her initial claim.

In January 2008, Bruinooge said that the Harper government was considering adapting provincial funding models in British Columbia and Alberta to address education and child-welfare programs in Manitoba.

In the minutes after it was announced that the Order of Canada was being presented to abortion provider and pro-choice advocate Henry Morgentaler on Canada Day 2008, Rod Bruinooge called the award &quot;Reprehensible&quot;.

He was re-elected over Liberal candidate John Loewen in the 2008 federal election. Immediately after the election, Bruinooge turned down an offer to become Parliamentary Secretary for INAC, citing a desire to focus his attention on the riding and spend more time with his family.

In December 2008, Rod Bruinooge was elected Chair of the Parliamentary Pro Life Caucus and was reported by the Canadian Press as stating that unborn children had less legal value in Canada than a human kidney.

In February 2009, Bruinooge founded the Conservative Post-Secondary Education Caucus to which he was elected chair. In April 2013, Bruinooge led a Post-Secondary Education Caucus Delegation to Washington D.C., to meet with American leaders in Post-Secondary Education, including a visit to Georgetown University. Bruinooge is also vice-chair of the Canada-U.S. Interparliamentary Group and the Canada-Holland Friendship Group. He is also a member of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage.

In May 2011, Bruinooge wrote an op-ed that ran nationally celebrating the renewal of Winnipeg in conjunction with the return of the Winnipeg Jets. Bruinooge argued that Winnipeg was North America&#x27;s best kept secret with new attractions such as the Canadian Museum for Human Rights and updated infrastructure like the Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport.

In May 2011 Bruinooge defeated his Liberal opponent in the spring election with a plurality over 50%. In the fall of 2011 there was some speculation that Bruinooge would seek the leadership of the Progressive Conservative party of Manitoba. On January 4, 2012 the Winnipeg Free Press reported that Bruinooge would remain in Ottawa and not seek the leadership.

Bruinooge held a consultation in Winnipeg with industry and business leaders from across Manitoba to discuss a renewal of the government&#x27;s Global Commerce Strategy.

Bruinooge announced his plans to not seek re-election in January 2015.

<text>Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE or Explorer 71) is a NASA Explorer program satellite and space exploration mission to study matter comprising energetic particles from the solar wind, the interplanetary medium, and other sources.

Real-time data from ACE are used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) to improve forecasts and warnings of solar storms. The ACE robotic spacecraft was launched on 25 August 1997, and entered a Lissajous orbit close to the Lagrange point (which lies between the Sun and the Earth at a distance of some from the latter) on 12 December 1997. The spacecraft is currently operating at that orbit. Because ACE is in a non-Keplerian orbit, and has regular station-keeping maneuvers, the orbital parameters in the adjacent information box are only approximate.

, the spacecraft is still in generally good condition. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center managed the development and integration of the ACE spacecraft.

== History ==
The Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) was proposed in 1986 as part of the Explorer Concept Study Program. ACE is designed to make coordinated measurements of the elemental and isotopic composition of accelerated nuclei from H (Hydrogen) to Zn (Zinc) spanning six decades in energy per nucleon, from solar wind to galactic cosmic ray energies, with sensitivity and with charge and mass resolution much better than heretofore possible. Following a Phase-A definition study, ACE was selected for development in 1989, and began construction in 1994. On 25 August 1997, ACE was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station by a Delta II launch vehicle. The August 1997 launch was originally scheduled back in 1993.

== Science objectives ==
ACE observations allow the investigation of a wide range of fundamental problems in the following four major areas:

=== Elemental and isotopic composition of matter ===
A major objective is the accurate and comprehensive determination of the elemental and isotopic composition of the various samples of &quot;source material&quot; from which nuclei are accelerated. These observations have been used to:
* Generate a set of solar isotopic abundances based on a direct sampling of solar material;
* Determine the coronal elemental and isotopic composition with greatly improved accuracy;
* Establish the pattern of isotopic differences between galactic cosmic ray and Solar System matter;
* Measure the elemental and isotopic abundances of interstellar and interplanetary &quot;pick–up ions&quot;;
* Determine the isotopic composition of the &quot;anomalous cosmic ray component&quot;, which represents a sample of the local interstellar medium.

=== Origin of the elements and subsequent evolutionary processing ===
Isotopic &quot;anomalies&quot; in meteorites indicate that the Solar System was not homogeneous when formed. Similarly, the Galaxy is neither uniform in space nor constant in time due to continuous stellar nucleosynthesis.

ACE measurements have been used to:
* Search for differences between the isotopic composition of solar and meteoritic material;
* Determine the contributions of solar wind and solar energetic particles to lunar and meteoritic material, and to planetary atmospheres and magnetospheres;
* Determine the dominant nucleosynthetic processes that contribute to cosmic ray source material;
* Determine whether cosmic rays are a sample of freshly synthesized material (e.g., from Supernova) or of the contemporary interstellar medium;
* Search for isotopic patterns in solar and galactic material as a test of galactic evolution models.

=== Formation of the solar corona and acceleration of the solar wind ===
Solar energetic particles, solar wind, and spectroscopic observations show that the elemental composition of the solar corona is differentiated from that of the photosphere, although the processes by which this occurs, and by which the solar wind is subsequently accelerated, are poorly understood. The detailed composition and charge–state data provided by ACE are used to:
* Isolate the dominant coronal formation processes by comparing a broad range of coronal and photospheric abundances;
* Study plasma conditions at the source of solar wind and solar energetic particles by measuring and comparing the charge states of these two populations;
* Study solar wind acceleration processes and any charge or mass-dependent fractionation in various types of solar wind flows.

=== Particle acceleration and transport in nature ===
Particle acceleration is ubiquitous in nature and understanding its nature is one of the fundamental problems of space plasma astrophysics. The unique data set obtained by ACE measurements has been used to:
* Make direct measurements of charge and/or mass-dependent fractionation during solar energetic particle and interplanetary acceleration events;
* Constrain solar flare, coronal shock, and interplanetary shock acceleration models with charge, mass, and spectral data spanning up to five decades in energy;
* Test theoretical models for 3He–rich solar flares and solar γ–ray events.

== Instruments ==
=== Cosmic-Ray Isotope Spectrometer (CRIS) ===
The Cosmic-Ray Isotope Spectrometer covers the highest range of the Advanced Composition Explorer&#x27;s energy coverage, from 50 to 500 MeV/nucleon, with an isotopic resolution for elements from Z ≈ 2 to 30. The nuclei detected in this energy interval are predominantly cosmic rays originating in our Galaxy. This sample of galactic matter investigates the nucleosynthesis of the parent material, as well as fractionation, acceleration, and transport processes that these particles undergo in the Galaxy and in the interplanetary medium. Charge and mass identification with CRIS is based on multiple measurements of dE/dx and total energy in stacks of silicon detectors, and trajectory measurements in a scintillating optical fiber trajectory (SOFT) hodoscope. The instrument has a geometrical factor of -sr for isotope measurements.

=== Electron, Proton, and Alpha-particle Monitor (EPAM) ===
The Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor (EPAM) instrument on the ACE spacecraft is designed to measure a broad range of energetic particles over nearly the full unit-sphere at high time resolution. Such measurements of ions and electrons in the range of a few tens of keV to several MeV are essential to understand the dynamics of solar flares, co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs), interplanetary shock acceleration, and upstream terrestrial events. The large dynamic range of EPAM extends from about 50 keV to 5 MeV for ions, and 40 keV to about 350 keV for electrons. To complement its electron and ion measurements, EPAM is also equipped with a Composition Aperture (CA) which unambiguously identifies ion species reported as species group rates and/or individual pulse-height events. The instrument achieves its large spatial coverage through five telescopes oriented at various angles to the spacecraft spin axis. The low-energy particle measurements, obtained as time resolutions between 1.5 and 24 seconds, and the ability of the instrument to observe particle anisotropies in three dimensions make EPAM an excellent resource to provide the interplanetary context for studies using other instruments on the ACE spacecraft.

=== Magnetometer (MAG) ===
The magnetic field experiment on ACE provides continuous measurements of the local magnetic field in the interplanetary medium. These measurements are essential in the interpretation of simultaneous ACE observations of energetic and thermal particle distributions. The experiment consists of a pair of twin, boom-mounted, triaxial flux gate sensors which are located 165 inches (419 cm) from the center of the spacecraft on opposing solar panels. The two triaxial sensors provide a balanced, fully redundant vector instrument and permit some enhanced assessment of the spacecraft&#x27;s magnetic field.

=== Real-Time Solar Wind (RTSW) ===
The Real-Time Solar Wind (RTSW) system is continuously monitoring the solar wind and producing warnings of impending major geomagnetic activity, up to one hour in advance. Warnings and alerts issued by NOAA allow those with systems sensitive to such activity to take preventative action. The RTSW system gathers solar wind and energetic particle data at high time resolution from four ACE instruments (MAG, SWEPAM, EPAM, and SIS), packs the data into a low-rate bit stream, and broadcasts the data continuously. NASA sends real-time data to NOAA each day when downloading science data. With a combination of dedicated ground stations (CRL in Japan and RAL in Great Britain) and time on existing ground tracking networks (NASA DSN and the USAF&#x27;s AFSCN), the RTSW system can receive data 24 hours per day throughout the year. The raw data are immediately sent from the ground station to the Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado, processed, and then delivered to its Space Weather Operations Center where they are used in daily operations; the data are also delivered to the CRL Regional Warning Center at Hiraiso Station, Japan, to the USAF 55th Space Weather Squadron, and placed on the World Wide Web. The data are downloaded, processed and dispersed within 5 minutes from the time they leave ACE. The RTSW system also uses the low-energy energetic particles to warn of approaching interplanetary shocks and to help monitor the flux of high-energy particles that can produce radiation damage in satellite systems.

=== Solar Energetic Particle Ionic Charge Analyzer (SEPICA) ===
The Solar Energetic Particle Ionic Charge Analyzer (SEPICA) was the instrument on the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) that determined the ionic charge states of solar and interplanetary energetic particles in the energy range from ≈0.2 MeV nucl-1 to ≈5 MeV charge-1. The charge state of energetic ions contains key information to unravel source temperatures, acceleration, fractionation, and transport processes for these particle populations. SEPICA had the ability to resolve individual charge states with a substantially larger geometric factor than its predecessor ULEZEQ on ISEE-1 and ISEE-3, on which SEPICA was based. To achieve these two requirements at the same time, SEPICA was composed of one high-charge resolution sensor section and two low-charge resolution, but large geometric factor sections.

As of 2008, this instrument is no longer functioning due to failed gas valves.

=== Solar Isotope Spectrometer (SIS) ===
The Solar Isotope Spectrometer (SIS) provides high-resolution measurements of the isotopic composition of energetic nuclei from He to Zn (Z=2 to 30) over the energy range from ~10 to ~100 MeV/nucleon. During large solar events, SIS measures the isotopic abundances of solar energetic particles to determine directly the composition of the solar corona and to study particle acceleration processes. During solar quiet times, SIS measures the isotopes of low-energy cosmic rays from the Galaxy and isotopes of the anomalous cosmic ray component, which originates in the nearby interstellar medium. SIS has two telescopes composed of silicon solid-state detectors that provide measurements of the nuclear charge, mass, and kinetic energy of incident nuclei. Within each telescope, particle trajectories are measured with a pair of two-dimensional silicon strip detectors instrumented with custom very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) electronics to provide both position and energy-loss measurements. SIS was specially designed to achieve excellent mass resolution under the extreme, high flux conditions encountered in large solar particle events. It provides a geometry factor of 40 cm2 sr, significantly greater than earlier solar particle isotope spectrometers.

=== Solar Wind Electron, Proton and Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM) ===
The Solar Wind Electron Proton Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM) experiment provides the bulk solar wind observations for the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE). These observations provide the context for elemental and isotopic composition measurements made on ACE as well as allowing the direct examination of numerous solar wind phenomena such as coronal mass ejection, interplanetary shocks, and solar wind fine structure, with advanced, 3-D plasma instrumentation. They also provide an ideal data set for both heliospheric and magnetospheric multi-spacecraft studies where they can be used in conjunction with other, simultaneous observations from spacecraft such as Ulysses. The SWEPAM observations are made simultaneously with independent electron (SWEPAM-e) and ion (SWEPAM-i) instruments. In order to save costs for the ACE project, SWEPAM-e and SWEPAM-i are the recycled flight spares from the joint NASA/ESA Ulysses mission. Both instruments had selective refurbishment, modification, and modernization required to meet the ACE mission and spacecraft requirements. Both incorporate electrostatic analyzers whose fan-shaped fields of view sweep out all pertinent look directions as the spacecraft spins.

=== Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS) and Solar Wind Ion Mass Spectrometer (SWIMS) ===
The Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS) and the Solar Wind Ions Mass Spectrometer (SWIMS) on ACE are instruments optimized for measurements of the chemical and isotopic composition of solar and interstellar matter. SWICS determined uniquely the chemical and ionic-charge composition of the solar wind, the thermal and mean speeds of all major solar wind ions from H through Fe at all solar wind speeds above 300 km/s−1 (protons) and 170 km/s−1 (Fe+16), and resolved H and He isotopes of both solar and interstellar sources. SWICS also measured the distribution functions of both the interstellar cloud and dust cloud pickup ions up to energies of 100 keV/e−1. SWIMS measures the chemical, isotopic and charge state composition of the solar wind for every element between He and Ni. Each of the two instruments are time-of-flight mass spectrometers and use electrostatic analysis followed by the time-of-flight and, as required, an energy measurement.

On 23 August 2011, the SWICS time-of-flight electronics experienced an age- and radiation-induced hardware anomaly that increased the level of background in the composition data. To mitigate the effects of this background, the model for identifying ions in the data was adjusted to take advantage of only the ion energy-per-charge as measured by the electrostatic analyzer, and the ion energy as measured by solid-state detectors. This has allowed SWICS to continue to deliver a subset of the data products that were provided to the public prior to the hardware anomaly, including ion charge state ratios of oxygen and carbon, and measurements of solar wind iron. The measurements of proton density, speed, and thermal speed by SWICS were not affected by this anomaly and continue to the present day.

=== Ultra-Low-Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) ===
The Ultra-Low-Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) on the ACE spacecraft is an ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometer that measures particle composition and energy spectra of elements He–Ni with energies from ~45 keV/nucleon to a few MeV/nucleon. ULEIS investigates particles accelerated in solar energetic particle events, interplanetary shocks, and at the solar wind termination shock. By determining energy spectra, mass composition, and temporal variations in conjunction with other ACE instruments, ULEIS greatly improves our knowledge of solar abundances, as well as other reservoirs such as the local interstellar medium. ULEIS combines the high sensitivity required to measure low particle fluxes, along with the capability to operate in the largest solar particle or interplanetary shock events. In addition to detailed information for individual ions, ULEIS features a wide range of count rates for different ions and energies that allows accurate determination of particle fluxes and anisotropies over short (few minutes) time scales.

== Science results ==
=== The spectra of particles observed by ACE ===
Figure 1 shows the particle fluence (total flux over a given period of time) of oxygen at ACE for a time period just after solar minimum, the part of the 11-year solar cycle when solar activity is lowest. The lowest-energy particles come from the slow and fast solar wind, with speeds from about 300 to about 800 km/s. Like the solar wind distribution of all ions, that of oxygen has a suprathermal tail of higher-energy particles; that is, in the frame of the bulk solar wind, the plasma has an energy distribution that is approximately a thermal distribution but has a notable excess above about 5 keV, as shown in Figure 1. The ACE team has made contributions to understanding the origins of these tails and their role in injecting particles into additional acceleration processes.

At energies higher than those of the solar wind particles, ACE observes particles from regions known as corotating interaction regions (CIRs). CIRs form because the solar wind is not uniform. Due to solar rotation, high-speed streams collide with preceding slow solar wind, creating shock waves at roughly 2–5 astronomical units (AU, the distance between Earth and the Sun) and forming CIRs. Particles accelerated by these shocks are commonly observed at 1 AU below energies of about 10 MeV per nucleon. ACE measurements confirm that CIRs include a significant fraction of singly charged helium formed when interstellar neutral helium is ionized.

At yet higher energies, the major contribution to the measured flux of particles is due to solar energetic particles (SEPs) associated with interplanetary (IP) shocks driven by fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares. Enriched abundances of helium-3 and helium ions show that the suprathermal tails are the main seed population for these SEPs. IP shocks traveling at speeds up to about accelerate particles from the suprathermal tail to 100 MeV per nucleon and more. IP shocks are particularly important because they can continue to accelerate particles as they pass over ACE and thus allow shock acceleration processes to be studied in situ.

Other high-energy particles observed by ACE are anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs) that originate with neutral interstellar atoms that are ionized in the inner heliosphere to make &quot;pickup&quot; ions and are later accelerated to energies greater than 10 MeV per nucleon in the outer heliosphere. ACE also observes pickup ions directly; they are easily identified because they are singlely charged. Finally, the highest-energy particles observed by ACE are the galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), thought to be accelerated by shock waves from supernova explosions in our galaxy.

=== Other findings from ACE ===
Shortly after launch, the SEP sensors on ACE detected solar events that had unexpected characteristics. Unlike most large, shock-accelerated SEP events, these were highly enriched in iron and helium-3, as are the much smaller, flare-associated impulsive SEP events. Within the first year of operations, ACE found many of these &quot;hybrid&quot; events, which led to substantial discussion within the community as to what conditions could generate them.

One remarkable recent discovery in heliospheric physics has been the ubiquitous presence of suprathermal particles with common spectral shape. This shape unexpectedly occurs in the quiet solar wind; in disturbed conditions downstream from shocks, including CIRs; and elsewhere in the heliosphere. These observations have led Fisk and Gloeckler to suggest a novel mechanism for the particles&#x27; acceleration.

Another discovery has been that the current solar cycle, as measured by sunspots, CMEs, and SEPs, has been much less magnetically active than the previous cycle. McComas et al. have shown that the dynamic pressures of the solar wind measured by the Ulysses satellite over all latitudes and by ACE in the ecliptic plane are correlated and were declining in time for about 2 decades. They concluded that the Sun had been undergoing a global change that affected the overall heliosphere. Simultaneously, GCR intensities were increasing and in 2009 were the highest recorded during the past 50 years. GCRs have more difficulty reaching Earth when the Sun is more magnetically active, so the high GCR intensity in 2009 is consistent with a globally reduced dynamic pressure of the solar wind.

ACE also measures abundances of cosmic ray nickel-59 and cobalt-59 isotopes; these measurements indicate that a time longer than the half-life of nickel-59 with bound electrons (7.6 × 104 years) elapsed between the time nickel-59 was created in a supernova explosion and the time cosmic rays were accelerated. Such long delays indicate that cosmic rays come from the acceleration of old stellar or interstellar material rather than from fresh supernova ejecta. ACE also measures an iron-58/iron-56 ratio that is enriched over the same ratio in solar system material. These and other findings have led to a theory of the origin of cosmic rays in galactic superbubbles, formed in regions where many supernovae explode within a few million years. Recent observations of a cocoon of freshly accelerated cosmic rays in the Cygnus superbubble by the Fermi gamma-ray observatory support this theory.

== Follow-on space weather observatory ==
On 11 February 2015, the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR)—with several similar instruments including a newer and more sensitive instrument to detect Earth-bound coronal mass ejections—successfully launched by NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The spacecraft arrived at L1 by 8 June 2015, just over 100 days after launch. Along with ACE, both will provide space weather data as long as ACE can continue to function.

<text>The Milwaukee Rampage is a former professional American soccer team, that was located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which played in the A-League.

==History==
Founded in 1993 by Milwaukee area businessmen Dan Doucette and Jim Hock, the Rampage played its first game on June 24, 1993, against Siarka Tarnobrzeg. Head coach Boro Sucevic fielded a team which included Tony Sanneh, Brian McBride, Kris Kelderman, Joey Kirk and Steve Provan. The Rampage played another six exhibition games that summer before playing in its first full season a year later. The team entered the 1994 United States Interregional Soccer League where it fell to the Minnesota Thunder in the Midwest Division final. This set up a rivalry between the two teams which continued until the Rampage&#x27;s departure in 2002. In 1995, the USISL split into an upper and lower league. The Rampage joined the higher, professional league. That year, Milwaukee again fell to the Thunder in the Midwest Division final. In 1996, the USISL added a third league, the 1996 USISL Select League. In 1996, the Select League, along with the competing A-League, both received Division 2 status from FIFA. This led to a merger between the two leagues to form the 1997 A-League under the umbrella of the USISL. Milwaukee joined this combined league. Head Coach Bob Gansler led the team to Milwaukee&#x27;s first professional sports championship since the 1971 Milwaukee Bucks. The Rampage defeated the Carolina Dynamo in a shootout. The team won the championship once more in 2002 under Head Coach Boro Sucevic before the franchise folded later that year. The Milwaukee Rampage still exists as a professional soccer club and non-profit in Milwaukee.

==General managers==
