<text>Charles Jerome Daly (July 20, 1930 – May 9, 2009) was an American basketball head coach. He led the Detroit Pistons to two consecutive National Basketball Association (NBA) championships in 1989 and 1990—during the team&#x27;s &quot;Bad Boys&quot; era—and the 1992 United States men&#x27;s Olympic basketball team (&quot;The Dream Team&quot;) to the gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics.

Daly is a two-time Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, being inducted in 1994 for his individual coaching career, and in 2010 was posthumously inducted as the head coach of the &quot;Dream Team&quot;. The Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award is named after him.

==Early life==
Born in Kane, Pennsylvania, to Earl and Geraldine Daly on July 20, 1930, Daly attended Kane Area High School. He matriculated at St. Bonaventure University for one year before transferring to Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 1952. After serving two years in the military, he began his basketball coaching career in 1955 at Punxsutawney Area High School in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.

==College career==
After compiling a 111–70 record in eight seasons at Punxsutawney High School, Daly moved on to the college level in 1963 as an assistant coach under Vic Bubas at Duke University. During his six seasons at Duke, the Blue Devils won the Atlantic Coast Conference championship and advanced to the Final Four, both in 1964 and 1966. Daly then replaced Bob Cousy as head coach at Boston College in 1969. The Eagles recorded an 11–13 record in Daly&#x27;s first year at the school, and improved to 15–11 in 1971.

Daly became the head coach at the University of Pennsylvania in 1971, succeeding Dick Harter. Penn won 20 or more games and captured the Ivy League title in each of its first four seasons with Daly at the helm. The most successful campaign was his first in 1972, when the Quakers recorded a 25–3 record overall (13–1 in their conference), and advanced to the NCAA East Regional Final, eventually losing to North Carolina. An additional significant success for Daly was in 1979, when all five starters on Pennsylvania&#x27;s Final Four team had initially been recruited by Daly. His overall record after six seasons at Penn was 125–38 (74–10 within the Ivy League).

==NBA and national team career==
In 1978, Daly joined the NBA&#x27;s Philadelphia 76ers as an assistant coach. During the 1981 season, the Cleveland Cavaliers hired him as the third head coach that season, but he was fired with a 9–32 record before the season ended. He then returned to the 76ers as a broadcaster until he was hired in 1983 by the Detroit Pistons. The Pistons, a franchise that had not recorded back-to-back winning seasons since the mid-1950s, made the NBA playoffs each year Daly was head coach (1983–1992), and reached the NBA finals three times, winning two consecutive NBA championships in 1989 and 1990. While serving as the Pistons coach, Daly was also a color commentator for TBS&#x27;s NBA Playoff coverage.
Daly was named head coach of the U.S. Dream Team that won the gold medal at the 1992 Olympics, before moving his NBA career onto the New Jersey Nets for the 1992–93 season. Daly stayed with the Nets for two seasons, before resigning over frustration over the immaturity of some of the players on his team.

Daly again took up a role as color commentator for TNT&#x27;s NBA coverage during the mid-1990s. Daly rejected an offer to coach the New York Knicks over the summer of 1995 after deciding he was not ready for the NBA coaching grind. He would return to coaching with the Orlando Magic at the beginning of the 1997–98 season. Daly stayed two seasons with the Magic and then retired permanently.

==Death==
Daly was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in March 2009 and died on May 9, 2009, at the age of 78. He is buried at Riverside Memorial Park in Tequesta, Florida.

<text>William Shepherd Benson (25 September 1855 – 20 May 1932) was an admiral in the United States Navy and the first chief of naval operations (CNO), holding the post throughout World War I.

==Early life and career==
William was born on a cotton plantation in Bibb County, Georgia, son of Richard Aaron Benson and Catherine Elizabeth (Brewer) Benson. Benson graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1877. His early years of sea duty included a cruise around the world in during the 1880s. He was also active in coast survey and hydrographic duties, was an instructor at the Naval Academy, commanded the cruiser , and served as a flag aide, in addition to other assignments. In 1906, Benson attended the Naval War College.

==Senior assignments==
In 1909, Benson was promoted to captain and became chief of staff of the United States Pacific Fleet. In 1911, Benson became the first commanding officer of the battleship . He was commandant of the Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1913–15.

===Chief of Naval Operations===
In May 1915, Benson was promoted to the rank of rear admiral and became the Navy&#x27;s first CNO, functionally replacing Rear Admiral Bradley A. Fiske, the last aide for naval operations.

Benson was heavily involved in defining the functions of the new CNO position and strengthening the navy during a period marked by internal Navy Department tensions, US interventions in the Caribbean and Central America, and World War I. Promoted to the rank of admiral in 1916, his responsibilities greatly expanded when the United States entered World War I in April 1917. Over the next year and a half, he oversaw a huge expansion of the navy, the extension of its operations to European waters, and the transportation of the United States Army&#x27;s American Expeditionary Forces to France. After the November 1918 armistice, he was an active participant in the lengthy peace negotiations held in France.

===Aviation===
In World War I, the Navy explored aviation, both land- and carrier-based, but the navy nearly abolished aviation in 1919, when Benson could not &quot;conceive of any use the fleet will ever have for aviation,&quot; and he secretly tried to abolish the Navy&#x27;s Aviation Division. Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt, though, reversed the decision because he believed naval aviation might someday be &quot;the principal factor&quot; at sea with missions to bomb enemy warships, scout enemy fleets, map mine fields, and escort convoys. Grudgingly allowing it a minor mission, the navy slowly built up its aviation arm. Naval aviation later proved to be the decisive advantage for the United States Navy that ensured victory during World War II and the duration of the Cold War, and it remains today as the centerpiece of the combat striking arms of the United States Navy.

==Retirement==
Benson retired from the naval service in September 1919. Over the next decade, he was active in the leadership of the United States Shipping Board. He served as the first president of the Army Navy Country Club in Arlington, Virginia, from 1925 to 1932.

Benson died on 20 May 1932, of a cerebral haemorrhage, in Washington, DC. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery, Section 3, Lot 1873-B.

Benson&#x27;s mother, Catherine Brewer Benson, was the first woman to receive a degree from Georgia Female College (now Wesleyan College). His son, Commodore Howard H. J. Benson, also a career navy officer, received the Navy Cross and Legion of Merit.

==Namesakes==

The one-block-long street named Benson Street in Charleston, South Carolina was named in his honor.

<text>Almonte ( ; ) is a former mill town in Lanark County, in the eastern portion of Ontario, Canada. Formerly a separate municipality, Almonte is a ward of the town of Mississippi Mills, which was created on January 1, 1998, by the merging of Almonte with Ramsay and Pakenham townships. Almonte is south-west of downtown Ottawa. Its population as recorded in the 2016 Canadian Census was 5,039.

==History==

===European settlement===
Almonte&#x27;s first European-bred settler was David Shepherd, who in 1818 was given by the Crown to build and operate a mill. The site became known as Shepherd&#x27;s Falls. That name was never official, however, and Shepherd sold his patent after his mill burned down. The patent&#x27;s buyer, Daniel Shipman, rebuilt the mill and the settlement became known as Shipman&#x27;s Mills by about 1821.

Most of Shipman&#x27;s Mills&#x27; early settlers were Scottish and later Irish. A textile town almost from the start, by 1850 it was the home of seven busy woollen mills. It was one of the leading centres in Canada West for the manufacture of woollen cloth. The construction of a railway line to Brockville stimulated the economic growth of Almonte. During this time of rapid expansion, the town changed its name from Shipman&#x27;s Mills to Ramsayville, and then to Waterford.

In 1869, Almonte was a village with a population of 2,000 on the Mississippi River in the Township of Ramsay, County of Lanark. It was a station of the Brockville and Ottawa Railway. By the 1870 the town had thirty stores and forty other businesses. Almonte was incorporated as a village in 1871, and was incorporated as a town in 1880.

On 10 September 1909 the town suffered a major fire, which destroyed several buildings on the main street and caused $75,000 worth of damage.

===Origin of the name Almonte===
When, in 1855, the newly created Canadian post office pointed out there was already a Waterford in Canada West, the town needed another name change.

Relations between the United States and Great Britain had been antagonistic since the Revolutionary War and later the War of 1812. Border wars between Mexico and the United States in the 1830s increased this antagonism. Mexican general Juan Almonte had fought honourably in these latter wars, and by 1853 he had become Mexico&#x27;s ambassador to the United States.

In the ensuing climate of Canadian mistrust of US territorial ambitions, General Almonte&#x27;s name would have been well known to Waterford&#x27;s citizens. Though there is no decisive evidence as to the final motive for the name change, it appears likely that Waterford saw Almonte as a &quot;principled David fighting a Goliath interested in swallowing up all North America.&quot;

The proposed name change was accepted by the Combined Counties of Lanark and Renfrew in June 1855, although the post office did not record the new name until 1859. Whenever the name may have been formally accepted, it led to Almonte being the only community in Ontario, and likely Canada, to be named for a Mexican general.

=== Almonte train wreck, 1942 ===

Almonte was the site of one of the worst rail disasters in Canadian history. On December 27, 1942, a troop train rear-ended a passenger train standing in the local railway station. Thirty-nine people were killed and more than 150 were injured. A local genealogy page provides photos and a contemporary newspaper report of the wreck.
===Present day===

After the last textile mill closed in the early 1980s, Almonte no longer had a dominant industry. It has since turned its attention towards tourism. It offers museums and several historical spots, such as the home of James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, and the Mississippi Valley Textile Museum.

Almonte retains much of its 19th-century architecture. The former Almonte post office, designed in 1889 by Thomas Fuller (the architect of the Parliament Buildings), and the Rosamond Woollen Mill, the largest 19th-century textile mill in Canada, are both designated as National Historic Sites of Canada.

Almonte has a skate park and a splash pad which are open to the public, beside the arena.
April 4, 2023, Almonte was named the best small town in the Ottawa area as determined by local radio station CHEZ 106.1, &quot;Biggs &amp; Barr Show&#x27;s March Madness of Small Towns.&quot; A celebratory event is planned for Saturday, April 29th in downtown Almonte where a trophy will be presented to the Mayor of Mississippi Mills.

==Movie locations==
Movies have been filmed partially or entirely in Almonte in recent years, including several Christmas movies. The &quot;New York Times&quot; said of the town that &quot;with its mix of 19th-century historic buildings and a ’50s diner, Almonte in Ontario has been the go-to location for holiday movies set in Vermont, Alaska and even Milwaukee.&quot;

Almonte featured in a 2022 episode of &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot;, though the episode was not actually filmed in Almonte.

==Events and attractions==

===Festivals===
Almonte is home to several festivals and events, including the North Lanark Highland Games, Naismith 3-on-3 Basketball Festival, Almonte Celtfest and Busfusion.

====North Lanark Highland Games====
The North Lanark Highland Games have been held annually in Almonte since 1982.

The Games feature traditional Highland sports and entertainment, and bring in about 6,000 visitors each summer.

====Almonte Celtfest====

The Almonte Celtfest has been held annually in Almonte&#x27;s Gemmill Park since 1997. The festival&#x27;s goal is to &quot;celebrate and promote the Celtic heritage of the Ottawa Valley through music and dance.&quot;

==== Puppets Up! ====
The popular Puppets Up! festival, which shut down in 2017 after a 12-year run, was revived in August 2022. Noreen Young is the festival&#x27;s creative director.

<doc id="1042036" wikidata="Q6189900" url="?curid=1042036" title="Jewish Naturalisation Act 1753">
<text>The Jewish Naturalisation Act 1753 was an Act of Parliament (26 Geo. 2. c. 26) which allowed Jews resident in Britain to become naturalised by application to Parliament. It received royal assent on 7 July 1753 but was repealed in 1754 (27 Geo. 2. c. 1) due to widespread opposition to its provisions.

==History==
During the Jacobite rising of 1745, the Jews had shown particular loyalty to the government. Their chief financier, Sampson Gideon, had strengthened the stock market, and several of the younger members had volunteered in the corps raised to defend London. Possibly as a reward, Henry Pelham in 1753 brought in the Jew Bill of 1753, which allowed Jews to become naturalised by application to Parliament. It passed the Lords without much opposition, but on being brought down to the House of Commons, the Tories made protest against what they deemed an &quot;abandonment of Christianity.&quot; The Whigs, however, persisted in carrying out at least one part of their general policy of religious toleration, and the bill was passed and received royal assent (26 Geo. 2. c. 26). The public reacted with an enormous outburst of antisemitism, and the Bill was repealed in the next sitting of Parliament, in 1754.

Horace Walpole, a contemporary observer, said that the Act removed &quot;such absurd distinctions, as stigmatized and shackled a body of the most loyal, commercial and wealthy subjects of the kingdom&quot;; the affair demonstrated that &quot;the age, enlightened as it is called, was still enslaved to the grossest and most vulgar prejudices&quot;. The political economist Josiah Tucker defended the Act in &quot;A Letter to A Friend Concerning Naturalizations&quot; (1753), where he pointed to the economic benefits of granting naturalisation to Jewish people:

As to the Bill itself, it only empowers &quot;rich&quot; Foreigners to &quot;purchase Lands&quot;, and to carry on a free and &quot;extensive Commerce&quot;, by importing all Sorts of Merchandise and &quot;Raw Materials&quot;, allowed by Law to be imported, for the Employment of our own People, and then Exporting the Surplus of the Produce, Labour, and Manufactures of our own Country, upon &quot;cheaper&quot; and &quot;better&quot; Terms than is done at present. This is all the Hurt that such a Bill &quot;can&quot; do.

==German Jews==
While the Sephardim chiefly congregated in London as the centre of international commerce, Jews immigrating from Germany and Poland settled for the most part in the seaports of the south and west, such as Falmouth, Plymouth, Liverpool, Bristol, etc., as pawnbrokers and small dealers. From these centres it became their custom to send out hawkers every Monday with packs to the neighbouring villages, whereby connections were made with some of the inland towns, where they began to settle, such as Canterbury, Chatham, Cambridge, Manchester, and Birmingham. Traders of this type, while not of such prominence as the larger merchants of the capital, came in closer contact with ordinary English people and may have helped to allay some of the prejudice which had been manifested so strongly in 1753.

<text>Trondenes Church () is the northernmost medieval stone church of Norway and the world&#x27;s northernmost surviving medieval building. It is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Harstad Municipality in Troms county, Norway. It is located on the northern edge of the town of Harstad. It is the main church for the Trondenes parish which is part of the Trondenes prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland. The white, stone church was built in a long church style around the year 1435 using plans drawn up by an unknown architect. The church seats about 300 people.

Though frequently referred to as a 13th-century church, dating based on dendrochronology places its completion shortly after 1434. Compared to the other ten north Norwegian medieval stone churches, Trondenes Church is well preserved, the exterior condition still close to the original state. The nave is long and the chancel is , making it one of the largest medieval churches of rural Norway. In the late Medieval period, Trondenes served as the main church centre of Northern Norway.

The church is best known for its rich decorations, including three gothic triptychs, one of which was earlier attributed to the German Hanseatic artist Bernt Notke, although modern art historians now doubt the attribution. The baroque pulpit is equipped with an hourglass to allow the minister to time long sermons. The organ dates from the late 18th century. In the choir section, one can see remnants of medieval frescoes.

==History==
The present church is presumably the third church on the site, the first stave church was likely built on the site during the 11th century, followed by another building in the 12th century. The second church was fortified with stone walls and ramparts, remnants of which can still be seen around the church today. The present stone church was built around the year 1435. The church bells once hung from a turret but, as the turret has long since been demolished, the bells now ring from a small tower in the graveyard.

In 1814, this church served as an election church (). Together with more than 300 other parish churches across Norway, it was a polling station for elections to the 1814 Norwegian Constituent Assembly which wrote the Constitution of Norway. This was Norway&#x27;s first national elections. Each church parish was a constituency that elected people called &quot;electors&quot; who later met together in each county to elect the representatives for the assembly that was to meet at Eidsvoll Manor later that year.

<text>Julia Alvarez (born March 27, 1950) is an American New Formalist poet, novelist, and essayist. She rose to prominence with the novels &quot;How the García Girls Lost Their Accents&quot; (1991), &quot;In the Time of the Butterflies&quot; (1994), and &quot;Yo!&quot; (1997). Her publications as a poet include &quot;Homecoming&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Woman I Kept to Myself&quot; (2004), and as an essayist the autobiographical compilation &quot;Something to Declare&quot; (1998). She has achieved critical and commercial success on an international scale and many literary critics regard her to be one of the most significant contemporary Latina writers.

Julia Alvarez has also written several books for younger readers. Her first picture book for children was &quot;The Secret Footprints&quot; published in 2002. Alvarez has gone on to write several other books for young readers, including the &quot;Tía Lola&quot; book series.

Born in New York, she spent the first ten years of her childhood in the Dominican Republic, until her father&#x27;s involvement in a political rebellion forced her family to flee the country. Many of Alvarez&#x27;s works are influenced by her experiences as a Dominican-American, and focus heavily on issues of immigration, assimilation, and identity. She is known for works that examine cultural expectations of women both in the Dominican Republic and the United States, and for rigorous investigations of cultural stereotypes. In recent years, Alvarez has expanded her subject matter with works such as &quot;&#x27;In the Name of Salomé&quot; (2000)&#x27;, a novel with Cuban rather than solely Dominican characters and fictionalized versions of historical figures.

In addition to her successful writing career, Alvarez is the current writer-in-residence at Middlebury College.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Julia Alvarez was born in 1950 in New York City. When she was three months old, her family moved back to the Dominican Republic, where they lived for the next ten years. She attended the Carol Morgan School. She grew up with her extended family in sufficient comfort to enjoy the services of maids. Critic Silvio Sirias believes that Dominicans value a talent for story-telling; Alvarez developed this talent early and was &quot;often called upon to entertain guests&quot;. In 1960, the family was forced to flee to the United States after her father participated in a failed plot to overthrow the island&#x27;s military dictator, Rafael Trujillo, circumstances which would later be revisited in her writing: her novel &quot;How the García Girls Lost Their Accents&quot;, for example, portrays a family that is forced to leave the Dominican Republic in similar circumstances, and in her poem, &quot;Exile&quot;, she describes &quot;the night we fled the country&quot; and calls the experience a &quot;loss much larger than I understood&quot;.

Alvarez&#x27;s transition from the Dominican Republic to the United States was difficult; Sirias comments that she &quot;lost almost everything: a homeland, a language, family connections, a way of understanding, and a warmth&quot;. She experienced alienation, homesickness, and prejudice in her new surroundings. In &quot;How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents&quot;, a character asserts that trying to raise &quot;consciousness [in the Dominican Republic]... would be like trying for cathedral ceilings in a tunnel&quot;.

As one of the few Latin American students in her Catholic school, Alvarez faced discrimination because of her heritage. This caused her to turn inward and led to her fascination with literature, which she called &quot;a portable homeland&quot;. She was encouraged by many of her teachers to pursue writing, and from a young age, was certain that this was what she wanted to do with her life. At the age of 13, her parents sent her to Abbot Academy, a boarding school, because the local schools were not considered sufficient. As a result, her relationship with her parents suffered, and was further strained when every summer she returned to the Dominican Republic to &quot;reinforce their identities not only as Dominicans but also as proper young lady&quot;. These intermittent exchanges between countries informed her cultural understanding, the basis of many of her works.

After graduating from Abbot Academy in 1967, she attended Connecticut College from 1967 to 1969 (where she won the Benjamin T. Marshall Poetry Prize) and then transferred to Middlebury College, where she obtained her Bachelor of Arts degree, &quot;summa cum laude&quot; and Phi Beta Kappa (1971). She then received a master&#x27;s degree from Syracuse University (1975).

===Career===
After acquiring a master&#x27;s degree in 1975, Alvarez took a position as a writer-in-residence for the Kentucky Arts Commission. She traveled throughout the state visiting elementary schools, high schools, colleges and communities, conducting writing workshops and giving readings. She attributes these years with providing her a deeper understanding of America and helping her realize her passion for teaching. After her work in Kentucky, she extended her educational endeavors to California, Delaware, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C., and Illinois.

Alvarez was a Visiting Assistant Professor of English for the University of Vermont, in Burlington, Vermont, for a two-year appointment in creative writing, 1981–83. She taught fiction and poetry workshops, introductory and advanced (for upperclassmen and graduate students) as well as a course on fiction (lecture format, 45 students).

In addition to writing, Alvarez holds the position of writer-in-residence at Middlebury College, where she teaches creative writing on a part-time basis. Alvarez currently resides in the Champlain Valley in Vermont. She has served as a panelist, consultant, and editor, as a judge for literary awards such as the PEN/Newman&#x27;s Own First Amendment Award and the Casa de las Américas Prize, and also gives readings and lectures across the country. She and her partner, Bill Eichner, an ophthalmologist, created Alta Gracia, a farm-literacy center dedicated to the promotion of environmental sustainability and literacy and education worldwide. Alvarez and her husband purchased the farm in 1996 with the intent to promote cooperative and independent coffee-farming in the Dominican Republic. Alvarez is part of Border of Lights, an activist group that encourages positive relations between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

==Literary writing==

Alvarez is regarded as one of the most critically and commercially successful Latina writers of her time. Her published works include five novels, a book of essays, three collections of poetry, four children&#x27;s books, and two works of adolescent fiction.

Among her first published works were collections of poetry; &quot;The Homecoming&quot;, published in 1984, was expanded and republished in 1996. Poetry was Alvarez&#x27;s first form of creative writing and she explains that her love for poetry has to do with the fact that &quot;a poem is very intimate, heart-to-heart&quot;.

Alvarez&#x27;s poetry celebrates and questions nature and the rituals of family life, (including domestic chores) a theme in her well known poem &quot;Dusting.&quot; Nuances of asphyxiated family life such as &quot;exile&quot;, &quot;assimilation&quot;, &quot;identity&quot;, and &quot;social class&quot; 
ebb and flow passionately through her poems.

Alvarez found inspiration for her work from a small painting from 1894 by Pierre Bonnard called &quot;The Circus Rider&quot;. Her poems, critic Elizabeth Coonrod Martínez suggests, give voice to the immigrant struggle.

&quot;How the García Girls Lost Their Accents&quot;, Alvarez&#x27;s first novel, was published in 1991, and was soon widely acclaimed. It is the first major novel written in English by a Dominican author. A largely personal novel, the book details themes of cultural hybridization and the struggles of a post-colonial Dominican Republic. Alvarez illuminates the integration of the Latina immigrant into the U.S. mainstream and shows that identity can be deeply affected by gender, ethnic, and class differences. She uses her own experiences to illustrate deep cultural contrasts between the Caribbean and the United States. So personal was the material in the novel, that for months after it was published, her mother refused to speak with her; her sisters were also not pleased with the book. The book has sold over 250,000 copies, and was cited as an American Library Association Notable Book.

Released in 1994, her second novel, &quot;In the Time of the Butterflies&quot;, has a historical premise and elaborates on the death of the Mirabal sisters during the time of the Trujillo dictatorship in the Dominican Republic. In 1960, their bodies were found at the bottom of a cliff on the north coast of the island, and it is said they were a part of a revolutionary movement to overthrow the oppressive regime of the country at the time. These legendary figures are referred to as &quot;Las Mariposas&quot;, or &quot;The Butterflies&quot;. This story portrays women as strong characters who have the power to alter the course of history, demonstrating Alvarez&#x27;s affinity for strong female protagonists and anti-colonial movements. As Alvarez has explained:

: &quot;I hope that through this fictionalized story I will bring acquaintance of these famous sisters to English speaking readers. November 25, the day of their murders is observed in many Latin American countries as the International Day Against Violence Toward Women. Obviously, these sisters, who fought one tyrant, have served as models for women fighting against injustices of all kinds.&quot;

In 1997, Alvarez published &quot;Yo!&quot;, a sequel to &quot;How the García Girls Lost Their Accents&quot;, which focuses solely on the character of Yolanda. Drawing from her own experiences, Alvarez portrays the success of a writer who uses her family as the inspiration for her work. &quot;Yo!&quot; could be considered Alvarez&#x27;s musings and criticism of her own literary success. Alvarez&#x27;s opinions on the hybridization of culture are often conveyed through the use of Spanish-English malapropisms, or &quot;Spanglish&quot;; such expressions are especially prominent in &quot;How the García Girls Lost Their Accents&quot;. Alvarez describes the language of the character of Laura as &quot;a mishmash of mixed-up idioms and sayings&quot;.

In 2001, Julia Alvarez published her first children&#x27;s picture book, “The Secret Footprints”. This book was written by Alvarez, and illustrated by Fabian Negrin. The book was about the Ciguapas, which are part of a Dominican legend. The Ciguapas are a fictional people that have dark skin, black eyes, with long, shiny hair that flows down the length their bodies. They have backward feet, so that when they walk their footprints point backward. The main character is named Guapa, and she is described as being bold, and has a fascination with humans to the point that it threatens the secrecy of the Ciguapas. The book features themes such as community, curiosity, difference, gender roles, and folklore.

Alvarez has also published young adult fiction, notably &quot;Return to Sender&quot; (2009) about the friendship that forms between the middle school age son of a Vermont Dairy farmer, and the same-age daughter of the undocumented Mexican dairy worker hired by the boy&#x27;s family. The children&#x27;s lives offer many parallels, as both children lose a grandparent, and have one parent injured (Tyler&#x27;s) or missing (Mari&#x27;s), but other aspects of their lives are lived in sharp contrast according to their legal status. The book argues for a shared humanity that transcends borders and nationality, but does not shy from difficult issues like dangerous border crossing, criminal coyotes who exploit the vulnerable, and forced deportation. A similar young adult work that examines difficult political circumstances and children&#x27;s experience of them is &quot;Before We Were Free&quot; (2003), told from the perspective of a young girl in the Dominican Republic in the months before and just after the assassination of dictator Rafael Trujillo. This novel addresses Dominican history in an accessible, riveting plot, describing aspects of the situation in 1961 little covered in most histories in English. Again, Alvarez uses the friendship between an American boy and Latina young girl as part of the story, but makes the relationship much less central in this earlier work.

&quot;In the Name of Salomé&quot; (2000) is a historical novel based on the lives of Salomé Ureña and of Camila Henríquez Ureña, both Dominican writers and respectively mother and daughter, to illustrate how they devoted their lives to political causes. The novel takes place in several locations, including the Dominican Republic before a backdrop of political turbulence, Communist Cuba in the 1960s, and several university campuses across the United States, containing themes of empowerment and activism. As the protagonists of this novel are both women, Alvarez illustrates how these women, &quot;came together in their mutual love of [their homeland] and in their faith in the ability of women to forge a conscience for Out Americas.&quot; This book has been widely acclaimed for its careful historical research and captivating story, and was described by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; as &quot;one of the most politically moving novels of the past half century.&quot;

In 2020, Alvarez published her first adult novel in 14 years, &quot;Afterlife.&quot; Alvarez was 70-years-old when &quot;Afterlife&quot; was published; having made her name on poignant coming-of-age stories, Alvarez shifted her focus towards &quot;the disorienting transition into old age.&quot; The main protagonist is grounded in both American and Dominican cultures, reflecting Alvarez&#x27;s own background. Alvarez freely incorporates Spanish words and phrases into the story without the use of italics, quotations, or translations.

==Influence on Latino literature==
Alvarez is regarded as one of the most critically and commercially successful Latina writers of her time. As Elizabeth Coonrod Martínez observes, Alvarez is part of a movement of Latina writers that also includes Sandra Cisneros and Cristina García, all of whom weave together themes of the experience of straddling the borders and cultures of Latin America and the United States. Coonrod Martínez suggests that a subsequent generation of Dominican-American writers, such as Angie Cruz, Loida Maritza Pérez, Nelly Rosario, and Junot Díaz, have been inspired by Alvarez&#x27;s success. Alvarez has admitted that:

: &quot;..the bad part of being a &#x27;Latina Writer&#x27; is that people want to make me into a spokesperson. There is no spokesperson! There are many realities, different shades and classes&quot;.

&quot;How the García Girls Lost Their Accents&quot; is the first novel by a Dominican-American woman to receive widespread acclaim and attention in the United States. The book portrays ethnic identity as problematic on several levels. Alvarez challenges commonly held assumptions of multiculturalism as strictly positive. She views much of immigrant identity as greatly affected by ethnic, gendered, and class conflict. According to critic Ellen McCracken:

: &quot;Transgression and incestuous overtones may not be the usual fare of the mainstream’s desirable multicultural commodity, but Alvarez’s deployment of such narrative tactics foregrounds the centrality of the struggle against abuse of patriarchal power in this Dominican American’s early contribution to the new Latina narrative of the 1990s.&quot;

Regarding the women&#x27;s movement in writing, Alvarez explains:

: &quot;...definitely, still, there is a glass ceiling in terms of female novelists. If we have a female character, she might be engaging in something monumental but she’s also changing the diapers and doing the cooking, still doing things which get it called a woman’s novel. You know, a man’s novel is universal; a woman’s novel is for women.&quot;

Alvarez claims that her aim is not simply to write for women, but to also deal with universal themes that illustrate a more general interconnectedness. She explains:

: &quot;What I try to do with my writing is to move out into those other selves, other worlds. To become more and more of us.&quot;

As an illustration of this point, Alvarez writes in English about issues in the Dominican Republic, using a combination of both English and Spanish. Alvarez feels empowered by the notion of populations and cultures around the world mixing, and because of this, identifies as a &quot;Citizen of the World&quot;.

==Grants and honors==
Alvarez has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Ingram Merrill Foundation. Some of her poetry manuscripts now have a permanent home in the New York Public Library, where her work was featured in an exhibit, &quot;The Hand of the Poet: Original Manuscripts by 100 Masters, From John Donne to Julia Alvarez.&quot; She received the Lamont Prize from the Academy of American Poets in 1974, first prize in narrative from the Third Woman Press Award in 1986, and an award from the General Electric Foundation in 1986. In 2009, she received the Fitzgerald Award for Achievement in American Literature.

&quot;How the García Girls Lost Their Accents&quot; was the winner of the 1991 PEN Oakland/Josephine Miles Literary Award for works that present a multicultural viewpoint. &quot;Yo!&quot; was selected as a notable book by the American Library Association in 1998. &quot;Before We Were Free&quot; won the Belpre Medal in 2004, and &quot;Return to Sender&quot; won the Belpre Medal in 2010. She also received the 2002 Hispanic Heritage Award in Literature.

<text>Neutron scattering, the irregular dispersal of free neutrons by matter, can refer to either the naturally occurring physical process itself or to the man-made experimental techniques that use the natural process for investigating materials. The natural/physical phenomenon is of elemental importance in nuclear engineering and the nuclear sciences. Regarding the experimental technique, understanding and manipulating neutron scattering is fundamental to the applications used in crystallography, physics, physical chemistry, biophysics, and materials research.

Neutron scattering is practiced at research reactors and spallation neutron sources that provide neutron radiation of varying intensities. Neutron diffraction (elastic scattering) techniques are used for analyzing structures; where inelastic neutron scattering is used in studying atomic vibrations and other excitations.

== Scattering of fast neutrons ==
&quot;Fast neutrons&quot; (see neutron temperature) have a kinetic energy above 1 MeV. They can be scattered by condensed matter—nuclei having kinetic energies far below 1 eV—as a valid experimental approximation of an elastic collision with a particle at rest. With each collision, the fast neutron transfers a significant part of its kinetic energy to the scattering nucleus (condensed matter), the more so the lighter the nucleus. And with each collision, the &quot;fast&quot; neutron is slowed until it reaches thermal equilibrium with the material in which it is scattered.

Neutron moderators are used to produce thermal neutrons, which have kinetic energies below 1 eV (T &lt; 500K). Thermal neutrons are used to maintain a nuclear chain reaction in a nuclear reactor, and as a research tool in neutron scattering experiments and other applications of neutron science (see below). The remainder of this article concentrates on the scattering of thermal neutrons.

== Neutron-matter interaction ==
Because neutrons are electrically neutral, they penetrate more deeply into matter than electrically charged particles of comparable kinetic energy, and thus are valuable as probes of bulk properties.

Neutrons interact with atomic nuclei and with magnetic fields from unpaired electrons, causing pronounced interference and energy transfer effects in neutron scattering experiments. Unlike an x-ray photon with a similar wavelength, which interacts with the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus, neutrons interact primarily with the nucleus itself, as described by Fermi&#x27;s pseudopotential. Neutron scattering and absorption cross sections vary widely from isotope to isotope.

Neutron scattering can be incoherent or coherent, also depending on isotope. Among all isotopes, hydrogen has the highest scattering cross section. Important elements like carbon and oxygen are quite visible in neutron scattering—this is in marked contrast to X-ray scattering where cross sections systematically increase with atomic number. Thus neutrons can be used to analyze materials with low atomic numbers, including proteins and surfactants. This can be done at synchrotron sources but very high intensities are needed, which may cause the structures to change. The nucleus provides a very short range, as isotropic potential varies randomly from isotope to isotope, which makes it possible to tune the (scattering) contrast to suit the experiment.

Scattering almost always presents both elastic and inelastic components. The fraction of elastic scattering is determined by the Debye-Waller factor or the Mössbauer-Lamb factor. Depending on the research question, most measurements concentrate on either elastic or inelastic scattering.

Achieving a precise velocity, i.e. a precise energy and de Broglie wavelength, of a neutron beam is important. Such single-energy beams are termed &#x27;monochromatic&#x27;, and monochromaticity is achieved either with a crystal monochromator or with a time of flight (TOF) spectrometer. In the time-of-flight technique, neutrons are sent through a sequence of two rotating slits such that only neutrons of a particular velocity are selected. Spallation sources have been developed that can create a rapid pulse of neutrons. The pulse contains neutrons of many different velocities or de Broglie wavelengths, but separate velocities of the scattered neutrons can be determined &quot;afterwards&quot; by measuring the time of flight of the neutrons between the sample and neutron detector.

=== Magnetic scattering ===

The neutron has a net electric charge of zero, but has a significant magnetic moment, although only about 0.1% of that of the electron. Nevertheless, it is large enough to scatter from local magnetic fields inside condensed matter, providing a weakly interacting and hence penetrating probe of ordered magnetic structures and electron spin fluctuations.

==Inelastic neutron scattering==
Inelastic neutron scattering is an experimental technique commonly used in condensed matter research to study atomic and molecular motion as well as magnetic and crystal field excitations. It distinguishes itself from other neutron scattering techniques by resolving the change in kinetic energy that occurs when the collision between neutrons and the sample is an inelastic one. Results are generally communicated as the dynamic structure factor (also called inelastic scattering law) formula_1, sometimes also as the dynamic susceptibility formula_2 where the scattering vector formula_3 is the difference between incoming and outgoing wave vector, and &quot;formula_4&quot; is the energy change experienced by the sample (negative that of the scattered neutron). When results are plotted as function of formula_5, they can often be interpreted in the same way as spectra obtained by conventional spectroscopic techniques; insofar as inelastic neutron scattering can be seen as a special spectroscopy.

Inelastic scattering experiments normally require a monochromatization of the incident or outgoing beam and an energy analysis of the scattered neutrons. This can be done either through time-of-flight techniques (neutron time-of-flight scattering) or through Bragg reflection from single crystals (neutron triple-axis spectroscopy, neutron backscattering). Monochromatization is not needed in echo techniques (neutron spin echo, neutron resonance spin echo), which use the quantum mechanical phase of the neutrons in addition to their amplitudes.

== History ==
The first neutron diffraction experiments were performed in the 1930s. However it was not until around 1945, with the advent of nuclear reactors, that high neutron fluxes became possible, leading to the possibility of in-depth structure investigations. The first neutron-scattering instruments were installed in beam tubes at multi-purpose research reactors. In the 1960s, high-flux reactors were built that were optimized for beam-tube experiments. The development culminated in the high-flux reactor of the Institut Laue-Langevin (in operation since 1972) that achieved the highest neutron flux to this date. Besides a few high-flux sources, there were some twenty medium-flux reactor sources at universities and other research institutes. Starting in the 1980s, many of these medium-flux sources were shut down, and research concentrated at a few world-leading high-flux sources.

== Facilities ==
Today, most neutron scattering experiments are performed by research scientists who apply for beamtime at neutron sources through a formal proposal procedure. Because of the low count rates involved in neutron scattering experiments, relatively long periods of beam time (on the order of days) are usually required for usable data sets. Proposals are assessed for feasibility and scientific interest.

<doc id="1042058" wikidata="Q466896" url="?curid=1042058" title="Walter B. Gibson">
<text>Walter Brown Gibson (September 12, 1897 – December 6, 1985) was an American writer and professional magician, best known for his work on the pulp fiction character The Shadow. Gibson, under the pen-name Maxwell Grant, wrote &quot;more than 300 novel-length&quot; Shadow stories, writing up to &quot;10,000 words a day&quot; to satisfy public demand during the character&#x27;s golden age in the 1930s and 1940s. He authored several novels in the Biff Brewster juvenile series of the 1960s. He was married to Litzka R. Gibson, also a writer, and the couple lived in New York state.

==Early life==
Walter Brown Gibson was born on September 12, 1897, in the Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Alfred Cornelius Gibson (1849–1931) and May Morrell Whidden Gibson (1863–1941).

Gibson was graduated from Colgate University in 1920 where he was a brother of Delta Kappa Epsilon, and began working &quot;for newspapers in his native Philadelphia as a reporter and crossword-puzzle writer,&quot; specifically for &quot;The North American&quot;, and later &quot;The Evening Ledger&quot;. In 1923–1924, he provided illustrated single-page articles for &quot;Science and Invention&quot; magazine describing various tricks and puzzles. In 1927, he founded and edited the pulp magazine &quot;Tales of Magic and Mystery&quot;, which ran for five issues, ending in April 1928. In 1928 Gibson was asked by Macfadden Publications to edit &quot;True Strange Stories&quot;; he did, for a time, identified as Walter Scofield, commuting back and forth to New York. In 1931, after submitting some crime stories for &quot;Detective Story Magazine&quot;, he was asked by publishers Street &amp; Smith to produce the first print adventure of The Shadow, who at that stage was merely a voice, the mysterious narrator of the Street &amp; Smith-sponsored &quot;Detective Stories&quot; radio drama. It was Gibson who created all the mythos and characterization of The Shadow, including his alter ego of wealthy playboy Lamont Cranston.

==The Shadow==

The popularity of the radio show&#x27;s narrator inspired the show&#x27;s sponsors (Street &amp; Smith) to translate the character into print, and Gibson was duly asked to produce 75,000 words for the first quarterly issue of &quot;The Shadow&quot; pulp magazine. This first Shadow story was published on April 1, 1931, just nine months after the character&#x27;s appearance on the airwaves. Six months later, The Shadow was headlining a new radio show, and his pulp adventures—written by Gibson under the house pseudonym Maxwell Grant—were going from strength to strength; launched as a quarterly publication, &quot;within months, the magazine was on a twice-monthly schedule,&quot; causing Gibson to produce the equivalent of 24 novels per year. Described as a &quot;compulsive writer,&quot; Gibson is estimated to have written, at his peak output, 1,680,000 words a year and at least 283 of the 336 Shadow novels. Gibson ultimately contributed more than 15,000,000 words towards Shadow publications.

As the Shadow character spun off into a daily syndicated comic strip, monthly comic books, movies and parlor games, Gibson went with him, scripting many of those comic book stories and the syndicated newspaper daily, as well as serving as consultant on the very popular Sunday night radio show.

Gibson is recognized as the creator of much of The Shadow&#x27;s mythos, although his tales often conflict with the better-known radio show version. For example, Gibson&#x27;s Shadow is, in reality, Kent Allard, a former World War I aviator, who sometimes posed as playboy Lamont Cranston. On the radio show, The Shadow was Cranston, a &quot;wealthy young man about town.&quot; Similarly, Shadow companion Margo Lane arose not from the pulp novels but from the radio program; she was added to offer a contrasting female voice to the show&#x27;s audience. In 1941 Gibson grudgingly added Margo Lane to the pulp stories, and even hinted at her having a power of invisibility.

==Magic, non-fiction, and other works==
Gibson wrote more than a hundred books on magic, psychic phenomena, true crime, mysteries, rope knots, yoga, hypnotism, and games. He served as a ghost writer for books on magic and spiritualism by Harry Houdini, Howard Thurston, Harry Blackstone, Sr., and Joseph Dunninger. Gibson wrote the comic books and radio drama &quot;Blackstone, the Magic Detective.&quot; starring a fictionalized version of Harry Blackstone. Gibson introduced the &quot;Chinese linking rings&quot; trick in America, and invented the &quot;Nickels to Dimes&quot; trick that is still sold in magic stores to this day. He &quot;wrote extensively on Houdini and his escape tricks and sleight-of-hand,&quot; and became involved after Houdini&#x27;s death with Houdini seances. Houdini was known as much for his investigations into – and exposure of – false mediums, and after his death, his wife Bess held seances for ten years in an attempt to contact the deceased magician. She then passed this role on to Gibson, who for many years helped preside over the Houdini Seances in the 1970s and 1980s at New York&#x27;s Magic Towne House with such well-known magicians as Milbourne Christopher, Dorothy Dietrich, Bobby Baxter, and Dick Brooks. Before Gibson died, he passed on the responsibility of doing the Houdini Seances to Dorothy Dietrich of the Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

Under the pen name Andy Adams, Gibson is credited with writing at least five of the twelve novels in the Biff Brewster juvenile adventure and mystery series for adolescent boys: &quot;Brazilian Gold Mine Mystery&quot;, &quot;Mystery of the Mexican Treasure&quot;, &quot;Mystery of the Ambush in India&quot;, &quot;Egyptian Scarab Mystery&quot;, and &quot;Mystery of the Alpine Pass&quot;.

In the 1920s, Gibson wrote two books on numerology for the publisher George Sully &amp; Co. With his wife Litzka R. Gibson (née Gonser), he co-wrote &quot;The Complete Illustrated Book of the Psychic Sciences&quot; (Doubleday, 1966), a 404-page book which explains how to practice many popular forms of divination and fortune-telling, including astrology, tasseography, graphology, and numerology. Litzka wrote her own books on topics as diverse as palmistry, dancing, and personal hygiene, sometimes under the pen-name Leona Lehman.

Gibson wrote a Batman prose story which appeared in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #500 (March 1981) and was drawn by Thomas Yeates.

Gibson also ghosted the novelization of the Preston Sturges screenplay &quot;The Sin of Harold Diddlebock&quot; under the by-line of popular humorist Harry Hershfield. Hershfield had been commissioned to write the novel, but stalled out in the first chapter. Gibson was engaged to write it in his stead, and the adaptive prose is actually his, from start to finish.

==Appearances and tributes in fiction==
He is a featured character in the Paul Malmont novel &quot;The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril&quot;, which was published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 2006, and in the sequel &quot;The Astounding, the Amazing, and the Unknown&quot; (Simon &amp; Schuster 2011). In addition, Gibson is the protagonist, along with actor Orson Welles, in a historical mystery by Max Allan Collins, &quot;The War of the Worlds Murder&quot;, published by Berkley Books in 2005.

In the Dynamite Entertainment miniseries &quot;The Shadow: Year One&quot; by Matt Wagner, a reporter appears on more than one occasion throughout the story&#x27;s progress, investigating most of the appearances of The Shadow and its connection with Lamont Cranston (Allard, who had in fact changed his identity with Cranston&#x27;s). At the end of the story we are shown that the reporter is called Maxwell Grant. Although it is not an appearance of Gibson as such, it is indeed a reference and tribute to his work in the novels when Grant talks of trying to document part of the adventures of The Shadow.

While not appearing directly, in P. N. Elrod&#x27;s &quot;Bloodlist&quot;, Jack Fleming mentions that he knows the author of the &quot;Shadow Magazine&quot;, and when he comes across a mobster guard reading &quot;Terror Island&quot; thinks to himself that he&#x27;ll &quot;have to write to Walter and tell him about his mobster fan.&quot;

<text>The 1870 Manitoba general election held on December 27, 1870, resulted in a victory for Lieutenant Governor Adams George Archibald&#x27;s governing coalition. Archibald had previously been appointed as the province&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor by George-Étienne Cartier, and promoted a model of &quot;consensus government,&quot; which included members of the province&#x27;s different ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups.

The only organized opposition in the province was the Canadian Party of John Christian Schultz, which demanded swifter retribution against the leaders of Louis Riel&#x27;s Red River Rebellion. Archibald&#x27;s coalition won 17 seats, Schultz&#x27;s party only 5. There were also two Independent MLAs: Thomas Bunn (who seems to have tacitly supported Archibald) and George Klyne (who does not appear to have played a major role in parliament). Edward Hay subsequently became Leader of the Opposition.

Formal party politics had not yet arrived in Manitoba, although some candidates were associated with the Liberal and Conservative parties at the national level.

The government was dominated by the Lieutenant Governors (Archibald and his successor, Alexander Morris) until July 1874, when Joseph Dubuc&#x27;s francophone bloc joined forces with the Opposition members to bring down the government. Marc-Amable Girard then served as Premier from July to November 1874, at which time he was replaced by Robert A. Davis.

<doc id="1042070" wikidata="Q2569914" url="?curid=1042070" title="Frosty the Snowman">
<text>&quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot; is a song written by Walter &quot;Jack&quot; Rollins and Steve Nelson, and first recorded by Gene Autry and the Cass County Boys in 1950 and later recorded by Jimmy Durante in that year. It was written after the success of Autry&#x27;s recording of &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; the previous year. Rollins and Nelson shopped the new song to Autry, who recorded &quot;Frosty&quot; in search of another seasonal hit. Like &quot;Rudolph&quot;, &quot;Frosty&quot; was subsequently adapted to other media including a popular television special.

== Song ==
The song&#x27;s lyrics describe the adventures of Frosty, a snowman who comes to life after a group of children place a magical silk hat on his head. Frosty laughs and plays with the children until the hot sun threatens to melt him. After leading them through the village streets and running afoul of a traffic policeman, Frosty says goodbye to the children, reassuring them, &quot;I&#x27;ll be back again someday.&quot;

It is generally regarded as a Christmas song, although Christmas itself is never mentioned in the lyrics. The action supposedly takes place in White Plains, New York, or Armonk, New York; Armonk has a parade dedicated to Frosty annually.

=== Covers ===
The song was quickly covered by many artists including Jimmy Durante, Nat King Cole and Guy Lombardo. The versions by Nat King Cole and Guy Lombardo also reached the American charts. A Phil Spector-produced 1963 cover by The Ronettes is a popular version, featuring in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;The Greatest Rock &amp; Roll Christmas Songs&quot;.

The song has been covered as an instrumental by the Canadian Brass, with founder Charles Daellenbach taking on the persona of Frosty, and repeatedly calling &quot;One more time!&quot; (&quot;You know what happens when Frosty gets &#x27;hot&#x27;&quot;), and then starting to collapse (&quot;I think he&#x27;s melting&quot; -- &quot;You &quot;know&quot; what happens when Frosty gets hot&quot;). It was also covered by the Hampton String Quartet on their inaugural album, &quot;What if Mozart Wrote &#x27;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot;&#x27;. It was also recorded by American Brass.

The song has also been covered (with lyrics) by the band Cocteau Twins; the cover was released on their 1993 EP &quot;Snow&quot;. It was also covered by the Jackson 5 and appears on the &quot;Jackson 5 Christmas Album&quot;.

The song was covered and released as the first single of Tarja Turunen&#x27;s third Christmas album and ninth studio album, &quot;Dark Christmas&quot;.

== Book ==
In 1950, Little Golden Books published &quot;Frosty the Snow Man&quot; as a children&#x27;s book, adapted by Annie North Bedford and illustrated by Corinne Malvern.

== 1950 short film ==
In 1950, the UPA studio brought &quot;Frosty&quot; to life in a three-minute animated short which appears regularly on WGN-TV. This production included a bouncy, jazzy &quot;a cappella&quot; version of the song and a limited animation style reminiscent of UPA&#x27;s &quot;Gerald McBoing-Boing&quot;. The short, filmed entirely in black-and-white, has been a perennial WGN-TV Christmas classic, and was broadcast on December 24 and 25, 1955, and every year since, as part of a WGN-TV children&#x27;s programming retrospective, along with their two other short Christmas classics, &quot;Suzy Snowflake&quot; and &quot;Hardrock, Coco and Joe&quot;. The short had previously been telecast annually on WGN&#x27;s &quot;The Bozo Show&quot;, &quot;Ray Rayner and His Friends&quot;, and &quot;Garfield Goose&quot;, along with its two other companion cartoons. The three cartoons are also a tradition on WJAC-TV in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, which not only broadcasts the cartoons on their station, but also makes them available on their website.

== Adaptations ==
In 1969, Rankin/Bass Productions produced a 25-minute television special, &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot;, featuring the animation of Japanese studio Mushi Production, and the voices of comedians Jimmy Durante as the narrator (who also sings a version of the song), Billy De Wolfe as Professor Hinkle and Jackie Vernon as Frosty. Paul Frees and June Foray both also voice characters including Karen and Santa Claus in this animated special produced and directed by Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass and designed by &quot;Mad&quot; artist Paul Coker. This was a story based on the discovery of Frosty the Snowman.

Three sequels followed: 
* &quot;Frosty&#x27;s Winter Wonderland&quot; (1976), based upon the song &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot;
* &quot;Rudolph and Frosty&#x27;s Christmas in July&quot; (1979)
* &quot;The Legend of Frosty the Snowman&quot; (2005) Bill Fagerbakke took over as Frosty&#x27;s voice after Vernon&#x27;s death.

&quot;Frosty Returns&quot; (1992) is a sequel to the original song, set in a separate fictional universe from the other specials, with John Goodman as the voice of Frosty defending the value of snow against Mr. Twitchell (Brian Doyle-Murray), the maker of a snow-removal spray. 

On July 1, 2020, a live-action film adaptation of Frosty the Snowman was announced to be in development at Warner Bros. and Stampede Ventures, with Jason Momoa voicing the titular snowman, Jon Berg and Greg Silverman producing alongside Geoff Johns, Roy Lee and Momoa, and David Berenbaum writing the screenplay. Following Ray Fisher&#x27;s accusation of mistreatment on the set of &quot;Justice League&quot;, Momoa defended Fisher and claimed that the &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot; movie announcement was made without his permission and accused Warner Bros. of releasing the story in order to distract from Fisher&#x27;s comments.

<text>Blue Lake is a large geothermal pond located about south of Wendover, Utah at . The lake is deep, approximately in size and at an elevation of above sea level. It is located on the Utah Test and Training Range, which is controlled by the United States Air Force, but the lake and its immediate surroundings are publicly accessible wetlands that are managed by the United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The BLM permits public access and use but does not permit the erection of permanent structures.

==Scuba diving==
Blue Lake is a popular spot for area divers. Since its water is warm year-round and reasonably clear, the lake is heavily used on the weekends for dive training, with programs such as the University of Utah Scuba Program. Other nearby high-mountain lakes are clear but cold even in early fall; and lower, warmer lakes tend to be murky. Blue Lake&#x27;s constant high-volume flow of clear springwater provides underwater visibility of up to at (rare) times, and year-round bottom temperatures of approximately . Surface temperatures vary from the high 60s (~20 °C) in winter to the high 70s (~25 °C) in summer.

The lake supports warm-water fish, mostly bass, tilapia, sunfish and bluegill. In addition, divers have placed objects on the bottom, such as large metal sculptures of marine animals, boats, a chair and TV set, to add interest. The bubbling thermal spring on the lake floor is also an interesting site for exploration.

Late fall or early spring provides the best overall diving conditions, since the water is clear (the summer algal bloom is absent), daytime air temperatures are somewhat mild, and the summer&#x27;s insects are absent. The algal bloom can reduce underwater visibility to a meter or less. However, it is not severe enough to damage the other marine life. During the winter, the lake&#x27;s water is also clear, but area temperatures make diving unpleasant.

The Utah DWR allows fishing in the lake; bass (6 fish limit), bluegill (50 fish limit), and tilapia (no limit, mandatory keep and kill). The tilapia criteria reflect the fact that this species was introduced to Blue Lake illegally, and it competes with the native game fish for habitat.

<doc id="1042080" wikidata="Q2555492" url="?curid=1042080" title="Ultra-Humanite">
<text>Ultra-Humanite (Gerard Shugel) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. He first appeared as a recurring adversary of Superman, and was among the first villains faced by him. He was designed to be the polar opposite of Superman; while Superman is a hero with superhuman strength, Ultra-Humanite is a criminal mastermind who has a crippled body but a highly advanced intellect. The Ultra-Humanite served as Superman&#x27;s nemesis until Alexei Luthor and his Silver Age counterpart Lex Luthor were introduced in the comics. The origins of the super-criminal known as the Ultra-Humanite are shrouded in mystery. Even he claims not to remember his true name or appearance and attributes his vast intellect and mental prowess to scientific experiments of an unknown nature.

In other media, Ultra-Humanite has appeared in &quot;Justice League&quot;, voiced by Ian Buchanan, as well as the third and final season of The CW network television series &quot;Stargirl&quot;.

==Publication history==
Ultra-Humanite first appeared in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #13 (June 1939) and was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.

==Fictional character history==
===Golden Age===

Ultra-Humanite is described as a fiendish &quot;mad scientist&quot;, and is paralyzed from the waist down and in need of a wheelchair. His &quot;great goal&quot; is the &quot;domination of the Earth&quot;. Portrayed as nearly bald in two texts and as completely bald in two others, he is a &quot;mental giant&quot; and the &quot;head of a vast ring of evil enterprises&quot; whose &quot;fiery eyes burn with terrible hatred and sinister intelligence&quot;. His real name is never given, but he has been known as the Ultra-Humanite (Ultra, for short) ever since &quot;a scientific experiment resulted in [his] possessing the most agile and learned brain on Earth!&quot;

&quot;--Unfortunately for mankind&quot;, proclaims the villain, &quot;I prefer to use this great intellect for crime. My goal? DOMINATION OF THE WORLD!!&quot;

Superman sets out to smash the so-called Cab Protective League, an underworld organization headed by a racketeer named Jackie Reynolds, which is attempting to seize control of the city&#x27;s lucrative taxi trade. Reynolds&#x27; union, financed by the Ultra-Humanite, intimidates other cab drivers through violence and threats against passengers. Apprehended by Superman, Reynolds is convicted and sentenced to Sing Sing penitentiary. Reynolds escapes by using a cigarette that emits &quot;a mysterious gas&quot; that renders his guards unconscious. Superman tracks Reynolds to his secluded cabin hideout and is about to take him into custody when his attention is called to a second figure in the cabin, a &quot;paralyzed cripple&quot; whose &quot;fiery eyes... burn with a terrible hatred and sinister intelligence&quot;: the Ultra-Humanite.

Ultra deals Superman electricity sufficient &quot;to kill five hundred men&quot;, and Superman lapses into unconsciousness. With Superman now helpless, Reynolds and the Ultra-Humanite attempt to kill him with a buzz saw, but Superman&#x27;s invulnerable skin obliterated the saw into tiny pieces. Reynolds is killed by one of the flying pieces. Ultra&#x27;s henchmen set fire to the cabin and leave Superman behind to perish. The Ultra-Humanite is carried outside to a waiting aircraft. Superman regains consciousness and deliberately crashes into the plane. The Man of Steel is unable to find the Ultra-Humanite&#x27;s body.

After scores of subway riders are injured in the collapse of a subway tunnel, Superman discovers that Star, Inc., the firm that built the tunnel, defrauded the city by using substandard materials. Superman pursues some of the criminals who lead him to the Ultra-Humanite. As Superman barges headlong into the shed, the villain freezes him inside a block of crystal. Superman is able to break out and stop the villain&#x27;s plans.

The Ultra-Humanite tries to extort millions of dollars from a cruise line, but again is foiled by Superman even though Ultra uses a hologram of himself to escape capture.

A mysterious epidemic sweeps through the city, killing hundreds. A young scientist, Professor Henry Travers, concocts an antidote. Ultra kidnaps Travers, but he is rescued by Superman. Ultra&#x27;s henchmen fire an unknown ray and knock out Superman. Ultra tries hypnotizing him by placing a helmet on his head, but Superman fakes being controlled, and when he is taken to spread the plague with a henchman, he destroys the &quot;fantastic airship of Ultra&#x27;s creation&quot; that was spreading &quot;cargo of Purple Death&quot;. Superman returns to Ultra&#x27;s stronghold where the villain tries to blast him, but Superman places the Ultra-Humanite in front of the gun, killing him.

In the next issue, Superman learns that Ultra&#x27;s assistant temporarily revived him &quot;via adrenalin&quot;. Ultra orders his henchmen to kidnap actress Dolores Winters and transplant his brain into her body. As Dolores, the Ultra-Humanite announces her retirement from acting, and throws a retirement party on her yacht, &quot;The Sea-Serpent&quot;. When the party is in full swing, she moves the yacht out to sea, and holds the guests at gunpoint. Ultra announces via ship&#x27;s radio that she is holding the celebrities captive for $5 million. Dolores places helmets on the heads of the captives, wired to a control board where she can electrocute them. Despite receiving the ransom money, she still decides to kill the captives. Superman throws a huge stalagmite into the switchboard, breaking the electrical connection, and tries to capture Dolores. She waves a lighted torch in front of the captives and Superman, seeing the mad look in her eyes, realizes she is Ultra. After Superman extinguishes the torch, Dolores dives into the water and escapes.

Soon after, the Ultra-Humanite reads of the discovery of an atomic weapon created by physicist Terry Curtis. As Dolores, the villain seduces and kidnaps the scientist. After extended torture, Curtis agrees to help the Ultra-Humanite build an atomic arsenal. The Ultra-Humanite tells the city she wants $2 million or she will destroy every building and life in the city. As a demonstration, she promises to destroy the Wentworth Tower that afternoon. When an airship attacks the Tower, Superman holds the Tower up long enough to let the spectators escape. Superman destroys the disintegrator and follows the plane to the criminal lair, which is a city inside a volcano, and defeats the robot guards. Inside, the villain threatens to destroy Metropolis if Superman moves closer. In exchange for the release of Curtis, the Ultra-Humanite sends Superman to steal crown jewels, expecting him to be destroyed by the guards as she alerts them. Superman is able to battle past the guards and get the jewels. When Superman returns with the jewels, the Ultra-Humanite sends diamond drills at Superman, but Superman breaks past them. Curtis stops Ultra from pulling the lever that will destroy the city. Superman then disintegrates the photoelectric cell connections. Confronted again with her ultimate foe, the Ultra-Humanite dives to her apparent doom in the volcano&#x27;s crater.

The Ultra-Humanite made his last &quot;Superman&quot; appearance in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #21 (1940), where he apparently dies, and made no further comic book appearances for several decades. He was subsequently replaced as Superman&#x27;s archvillan by Lex Luthor who would be introduced in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #23 (1940).

===Silver Age and the Multiverse===
With the introduction of DC&#x27;s multiverse system, the continuity of Golden Age Superman stories and the Ultra-Humanite were retroactively placed on Earth-Two, the Earth of DC&#x27;s Golden Age characters. The Ultra-Humanite was reintroduced during the Silver Age as a recurring villain in the &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Superman&quot; feature in the &quot;Superman Family&quot; anthology comic. The feature consists of stories about the early years of the marriage between the Earth-Two Superman and Lois Lane. These stories feature a number of Golden Age Superman villains of which the Ultra-Humanite is the most prominent.

In the annual JLA/JSA teamup in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #195-197 (1981), the Ultra-Humanite transfers his consciousness to an albino gorilla body and becomes a major super-villain on Earth-Two. In one instance, he recruited Brain Wave, Monocle, Rag Doll, Psycho-Pirate, Mist, and four villains from Earth-1 (Plant Master, Signalman, Cheetah, and Killer Frost) into a new Secret Society of Super Villains. Afterwards, the Ultra-Humanite regularly appears in DC Comics titles, opposing the All-Star Squadron in the 1940s, and the Justice Society of America and Infinity, Inc. in the decades since World War II.

===Post-Crisis===
After the 1985-86 limited series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Superman&#x27;s history was rewritten in &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; miniseries, and the Earth-Two Superman was removed from continuity. The Ultra-Humanite was excluded from Superman&#x27;s reboot, and his post-&quot;Crisis&quot; history remained tied to the 1940s and to the Justice Society of America and All-Star Squadron. Previous appearances of the Ultra-Humanite fighting Golden Age Superman in the 1940s in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #13-21 and in &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; were re-told for the sake of continuity (a technique known as retconning) to show him having fought other 1940s heroes.

The Ultra-Humanite&#x27;s most ambitious scheme occurs in the 2002 &quot;Stealing Thunder&quot; story arc from &quot;JSA&quot; #32-37 where, having taken over the body of an aged Johnny Thunder, he deceives Jakeem Thunder into handing over his magical pen. With Thunderbolt&#x27;s power, the Ultra-Humanite restores his body&#x27;s youth, and then proceeds to take over the world. Under his rule, Earth is transformed into essentially a single mind, with nearly every metahuman becoming an extension of him. A few heroes manage to escape the control of the Ultra-Humanite: Jakeem Thunder, Captain Marvel, Hourman, the third Crimson Avenger, Power Girl, Sand, and the second Icicle. Wildcat and Hector Hall are also freed—Wildcat as an apparent side effect of his &#x27;nine lives&#x27;, and Hall so that he could summon the garb of Doctor Fate and thus provide the Ultra-Humanite with access to Nabu&#x27;s power—but both are held captive by the Ultra-Humanite. After the reserve JSA are able to temporarily short out the Thunderbolt (thanks to advice from the time-displaced original Hourman), the Ultra-Humanite is seemingly killed by the Crimson Avenger (although the Icicle nearly beats her to it) as revenge for the death of the first Crimson Avenger, who died earlier in an explosion triggered by the Ultra-Humanite.

===One Year Later===

After the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, history was altered to bring Dolores Winters (now called Delores Winters) back to life via the reveal that her brain was placed in a new body after Ultra-Humanite stole her body for his own use.

The Ultra-Humanite&#x27;s secret origin is revised, shedding more light on his past life as genius youth Gerard Shugel (a name derived from Superman creators Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel). He was born with both an intellect that surpassed the world&#x27;s greatest minds and a degenerative disease that was slowly eating away at him. He used his intellect to find ways to keep the disease at bay, while trying to find a way to transplant his brain into a healthy body.

Working with a reckless and young Satanna, a fellow college researcher, they worked together at their brain/transplant and animal hybridization technologies. Forced to relocate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and beset by rebel forces and the military, Satanna transplanted the brain of Gerard into the altered body of an albino gorilla. They shared an intimate relationship for a while, then parted ways for a long time, paving the way for their separate adventures as chronicled pre-&quot;OYL&quot;.

In the 2006-07 &quot;Lightning Saga&quot; crossover between Justice Society of America and Justice League of America, the untold story of how Ultra-Humanite transitioned from Delores Winter&#x27;s body to his albino ape form was revealed: Per Degaton, the villainous time traveler, and a young version of Despero rescued the Delores Winters-version of Ultra-Humanite from a hospital in the year 1948. It is revealed that the Ultra-Humanite was stricken with terminal cancer and in exchange for his loyalty, Per Degaton agreed to provide a new body for the villain, in the form of a rare albino ape from the secret civilization known as Gorilla City. Christening themselves the &quot;Time Stealers&quot;, they align themselves with Mister Mind, Rex Hunter, the mysterious Black Beetle, and the villainous father of Booster Gold in an attempt to manipulate time for their own selfish goals. Their conspiracy ultimately unravels at the hands of Booster Gold and Blue Beetle Ted Kord. In the end, Ultra-Humanite and Despero were sent back into the past after their group was defeated, while other members were returned to their previous places in time.

Ultra-Humanite is said to still be alive and well, having stolen a copy of Steve Dayton&#x27;s Mento helmet.

Later, Ultra-Humanite is seen aiding the Reach in their plans to conquer Earth; he is defeated by Blue Beetle and Guy Gardner. Ultra appears in the first arc of &quot;Power Girl&quot; (vol. 2), using an anti-gravity mechanism to raise New York City into the air, holding the city hostage in exchange for being able to transfer his mind into Power Girl&#x27;s body. The attempt fails, and Power Girl accidentally scars his whole body with acid burns, maiming his form permanently.

Satanna returns to New York, attempting to aid her former lover, stealing the body of the current Terra, Atlee, for Gerard&#x27;s use. After a lengthy fight, Power Girl is able to retrieve Terra&#x27;s brain (now in the crippled simian form of the Ultra-Humanite) and bring both of them to Strata, Atlee&#x27;s advanced underground birth society. She does this to get her friend restored to her proper body. Strata&#x27;s scientists agree to clone a new, fully human body for Gerard Shugel, resembling a healthy version of his twenty-year-old human self, cured from his degenerative disease. Power Girl attempts to hire him as a scientist for her Starr Labs, and Gerard plays along by showing a fake desire of reformation.

===2010s onward===
When DC rebooted its continuity with &quot;The New 52&quot; in 2011, Ultra-Humanite was reintroduced in the pages of &quot;Action Comics&quot; with a wildly different concept: a fear-feeding alien in the Phantom Zone who manages to get out and feed on the fear of Superman when he is a child. Young Clark is too strong for him, so he retreats to the Phantom Zone. During the &quot;&quot; storyline, a portal opens in Smallville allowing the Ultra-Humanite to escape. Superman is able to defeat him by filling him up with too many emotions.

Later, DC discarded most of its New 52 changes, with an initiative called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;. All of Superman&#x27;s villains and history were restored to pre-New 52 basics in a storyline called &quot;Superman Reborn&quot;. The original Ultra-Humanite subsequently appeared again, depicted as an evil genius who placed his brain into an albino gorilla. He is a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains.

In &quot;Superman and the Authority&quot;, Ultra-Humanite&#x27;s canonical status as Superman&#x27;s first villain returns as Brainiac supplies him with a method of Brain cloning that allows him to be in multiple places at once. Superman is forced to leave Earth with the Authority while the Ultra-Humanite, unconcerned with implications of Clark&#x27;s journey, prepares to continue his villainous career as the arch-nemesis of Jon Kent.

==Powers and abilities==
The Ultra-Humanite possesses a super-genius intelligence, thus making him twice as smart as Luthor. He has the medical knowledge necessary to surgically transfer his brain into another body without transplant rejection, even when using variously different species. His most frequently revisited form is that of a mutated albino gorilla with immense physical attributes and psychic powers. He invented numerous advanced weapons, vehicles, and other arcane technology.

In the New 52, Ultra-Humanite is portrayed as an alien who feeds on a person&#x27;s emotions. To help him do this, he can send out small tentacled creatures that overshadows his victim, as well as draining the fears out of him or her.

==Other versions==
===Tangent: Superman&#x27;s Reign===
An alternate Ultra-Humanite appears in issues three and four of the &quot;Tangent: Superman&#x27;s Reign&quot; series. This version is a living weapon created by the Soviets that went out of control. He is allegedly destroyed in battle by the Tangent version of Superman, but is later revealed that he was preserved and reprogrammed to fight for the Tangent&#x27;s Superman&#x27;s cause. He is finally destroyed by the combined efforts of the Tangent Batman and New Earth Superman.

===Legends of the DC Universe===
The first three issues of &quot;Legends of the DC Universe&quot; feature the post-Crisis Superman. Superman is early in his career and battles a scientist named Morgan Wilde who, angered by the death of his wife, swears revenge on Luthor and gains the ability to transfer his &quot;life essence&quot; (called &quot;Under-Light&quot;) as the U.L.T.R.A. Humanite.

===The Golden Age===
In the Elseworlds miniseries &quot;The Golden Age&quot;, the Ultra-Humanite places his brain into the body of Tex Thomson, known as the Americommando. He also arranges to place the brain of his ally Adolf Hitler into the body of Danny Dunbar, while simultaneously arranging to give Hitler (as Dunbar) super-powers.

===Superman &amp; Batman: Generations===
The Ultra-Humanite is the principal villain in the John Byrne limited series &quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations&quot;. He first appears in the 1939 story, but is believed to be killed when his escape rocket explodes. Decades later, it is revealed that the Humanite had his brain placed in the body of his lackey Lex Luthor and posed as Luthor for the intervening time. He then attempts to swap bodies with a then-powerless Superman, but is killed when Superman, attempting to escape, throws a metal spear into Humanite&#x27;s computer, causing it to electrocute the villain.

===Earth 2===
A different Ultra-Humanite appears as the main villain of the &quot;One Nation&quot; arc of &quot;Earth 2: Society&quot; #12-16, where he is a survivor of the destroyed Earth 2 and uses the lost children of the old Earth as his personal soldiers, one of whom is John Grayson, the son of the Earth 2 Dick Grayson, aka Batman III. He is killed by Hawkgirl with the Amazonion Casket, the object he was going to use as part of his plan to take over Earth 2.

==In other media==
===Television===

* Ultra-Humanite in his albino gorilla body appears in &quot;Justice League&quot;, voiced by Ian Buchanan. This version is a cultured and intellectual criminal with a deep love for classical music and violent hatred for most modern art. Additionally, he is more benevolent than his comics counterpart, helping heroes for his own reasons across his appearances, with one seeing him joining Lex Luthor&#x27;s Injustice Gang before eventually betraying him.
* Ultra-Humanite in his albino &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; body appears in the &quot;&quot; short &quot;The Creature Commandos in The War That Time Forgot!&quot;, voiced by Jeff Bennett. This version is a brain in a small mobile robotic jar capable of possessing anything. While assisting the Axis Powers during World War II with mind-controlled dinosaurs from Dinosaur Island, he captured Batman, but is thwarted by the Creature Commandos, forced to retreat, and cornered by other dinosaurs.
* Ultra-Humanite in his albino gorilla body appears in &quot;Young Justice&quot;, with vocal effects provided by Dee Bradley Baker in the first season and by Greg Weisman in the third season. This version mentored Dr. Helga Jace. First appearing in the episode &quot;Revelation&quot; as a member of the Injustice League, the Light uses the group to throw the Justice League and the Team off their trail. As of the episode &quot;Home Fires&quot;, Ultra-Humanite has replaced the Brain as a leading member of the Light and acquired a speaker for his harness. 
* Ultra-Humanite in his albino gorilla body appears in the third season of &quot;Stargirl&quot;, voiced by an uncredited actor. This version is an enemy of the original Justice Society of America (JSA) and an associate of Dragon King. In the present, Ultra-Humanite forms an alliance with Icicle and Dragon King before transplanting his brain into the body of Starman (portrayed by Joel McHale) to manipulate Stargirl and her JSA while Dragon King transplanted his brain into Ultra-Humanite&#x27;s body for him to &quot;defeat&quot; as Starman alongside Icicle&#x27;s son before intending to run for president as a mouthpiece for Icicle to spread his ideals. However, the JSA defeat the villains, with S.T.R.I.P.E. leaving Ultra-Humanite brain-damaged.

<doc id="1042082" wikidata="Q4167622" url="?curid=1042082" title="Dragon (Dragonriders of Pern)">
<text>The Dragons of Pern are a fictional race created by Anne McCaffrey as an integral part of the science fiction world depicted in her Dragonriders of Pern novels.

In creating the Pern setting, McCaffrey set out to subvert the clichés associated with dragons in European folklore and in modern fantasy fiction. Pernese dragons are similar to traditional European dragons in the fact that they can breathe fire and resemble great lizards or dinosaurs with wings, but the resemblance ends there. Unlike most dragons in previous Western literature, Pernese dragons are entirely friendly to humanity. Furthermore, they are not magical at all. Instead, they are a heavily genetically modified species based on one of Pern&#x27;s native life-forms, the fire-lizard.

== History ==
In Dragonsdawn, the race was intentionally engineered to fight Thread, a deadly mycorrhizoid spore that devours all organic matter that it touches, after it first caught the human colonists on Pern unawares with devastating results. Geneticist Kitti Ping Yung designed the dragons by manipulating the genetic code of the indigenous fire-lizards that had been acquired as pets by the colonists. The dragons were named after their resemblance to European dragons from the legends of old Earth. Later genetic manipulation by Ping&#x27;s granddaughter, Wind Blossom, also resulted in the watch-whers, ungainly, nocturnal creatures who bore a slight resemblance to dragons. The later novels, set during the Third Pass, have shown the watch-whers are more useful than commonly thought in the novels set in the First Pass. On Pern, time is measured in &quot;Turns&quot;, or years, and &quot;Passes&quot;, which are about fifty Turns long, and occur when a planet named the &quot;Red Star&quot; is close enough to Pern for Thread to traverse space between the Red Star and Pern. Thread only falls during Passes. Periods between Passes, when the Red Star&#x27;s orbit takes it away from Pern, are referred to as &quot;Intervals&quot;; usually lasting about two hundred Turns. In the novels, &quot;Long Intervals&quot;, of about four hundred and fifty Turns, have occurred twice. These Long Intervals have led the inhabitants of Pern to believe that Thread will never return.

== Physiology ==
Dragons are described as carnivorous, oviparous, warm-blooded creatures. Like all of Pern&#x27;s native large fauna, they have six limbs – four feet and two wings. Their blood, referred to as ichor, is copper-based and green in color. Their head and general body type is described by McCaffrey as being similar in shape to those of horses. On their heads they have small headknobs, similar to those of giraffes, and no visible ears. They have multifaceted eyes that change color depending on the dragon&#x27;s mood. Unlike the dragons of Terran legend, they have a smooth hide rather than scales; the texture of their skin is described as being reminiscent of suede with a spicy, sweet scent when clean. They are described as having forked tail ends with a defecation opening between the forks; however, most artistic renderings depict their tails as having spade-shaped tips. The dragons usually get from one place to another by utilizing a teleportation process known as &quot;going &quot;between&quot;&quot;.

Kitti Ping designed the dragons to gradually increase in size with every generation until they reached pre-programmed final dimensions. The dragons of the first Hatchings were not much bigger than horses. By the Sixth Pass (1500 years later) they had reached their programmed size and remained at that size until a single isolated dragon population suffered severe inbreeding, resulting in much larger beasts. In the Ninth Pass, in which most of the novels have been set, the largest Pernese dragon on record, Ramoth, hatched. According to the novel &quot;All the Weyrs of Pern&quot;, these dragons were roughly three times the size of the largest first-generation dragons. Ramoth&#x27;s great size is often attributed to mutation and the genetic isolation of Benden Weyr for over 400 years (or Turns). Ramoth, at full length, was forty-five meters long. However, The Dragon Lover&#x27;s Guide to Pern is erroneous on this point and Anne has said herself on multiple occasions that her dragons are measured in feet not meters. Ramoth is intended by the author to be 45 feet long. As referenced in this quote from the 1979 Documentary series &quot;Time Out of Mind - Episode 4: Anne McCaffrey&quot; available on YouTube. &quot;...well you&#x27;d want to catch a parasite that just burrowed and fed on any living thing, before it hit the ground and there was your rationale for dragons. But you couldn&#x27;t have small dragons you&#x27;d have to have big ones so I decided 35-40ft that seems an economical size.&quot; In &quot;All the Weyrs of Pern&quot;, AIVAS, an artificial intelligence still in operation after all this time, notes that all of the primary Benden dragons, Ramoth, Mnementh and Canth, are notably larger than Kitti Ping&#x27;s specified end-size of the dragon species. Newly hatched dragons are the size of very large dogs or small ponies, and reach their full size after eighteen months. Because young dragons grow so fast, their riders must regularly apply oil to their hides to prevent the skin from cracking or drying out.

Dragons, like their fire-lizard ancestors, can breathe fire by chewing a phosphine-bearing rock, called &quot;firestone&quot; in the novels, which reacts with an acid in a special &quot;second stomach&quot; organ. This forms a volatile gas that can be exhaled at will and ignites upon contact with air. The flame is used to burn Thread from the sky before it reaches the ground. However, the chewed firestone must be expelled from the body after it is used up, for the dragons cannot digest it.

== Psychic abilities ==
Despite their relatively low intelligence, fire-lizards communicate through a form of weak telepathy. They also imprint on the first individual who feeds them after they hatch, creating a telepathic bond with them; the Pernese call this phenomenon &quot;Impression&quot;. In creating dragons, Kitti Ping intensified the creatures&#x27; telepathy, greatly increased their intelligence, and gave them a strong instinctive drive to Impress to a human. Upon hatching, each dragonet chooses one of the humans present (usually) and Impresses to that person; from that moment on, the pair are in a constant state of telepathic contact for as long as they both live. Dragons also use telepathy to communicate with each other and with fire-lizards. They are capable of speaking telepathically to humans besides their own riders, but not all of them will do so except under unusual circumstances.

Dragons and fire-lizards can also teleport. They do this by briefly entering a hyperspace dimension known as &quot;between&quot;. Both humans and dragons experience &quot;between&quot; as an extremely cold, sensory-deprived, black void. After spending no more than eight seconds in &quot;between&quot;, the dragon or fire-lizard can re-emerge anywhere on Pern, along with any passengers or cargo they carried. This ability is explained as having evolved in fire-lizards as a defense against Thread; not only does it allow them to quickly escape from Threadfall, but the intense cold of &quot;between&quot; kills any Thread that has already burrowed into them. If a dragon attempts to teleport without a clear mental image of the place where they intend to reappear, they may simply fail to emerge from &quot;between&quot; and thus, be gone forever.

Going &quot;between&quot; allows dragons to travel through time as well as space, as long as they have a clear picture of what a particular place looked like (or will look like) at the desired time. However, the practice is highly dangerous to both dragon and rider and is severely restricted. Existing in two places at once for extended periods of time, or in close proximity, causes severe weakness and psychological disturbance for humans but not for dragons, the effects of which are discussed in several novels. In addition, while teleporting through space always takes the same amount of time, when a dragon travels through time, the amount of time they spend in &quot;between&quot; increases depending on how far away in time the destination is. Thus, traveling to remote times poses severe dangers from hypothermia and oxygen deprivation. In the first Pern novel, Dragonflight, Lessa passes out after having travelled back more than four hundred Turns.

&quot;The Dragonlover&#x27;s Guide to Pern&quot; states that dragons defecate while &quot;between&quot;. This idea originated with a statement by Anne McCaffrey herself, in answer to a fan&#x27;s question about the subject at a con. However, McCaffrey may have been joking when she first said this. As the idea has never been referenced in any of the Pern novels (in fact, defecation was mentioned only a few times in all of the books ever written in the Pern series), it cannot be considered definitively canonical. &quot;The Skies of Pern&quot; references the use of dragon dung as a repellent against the large felines inhabiting the southern continent.

Dragons are also capable of telekinesis, though this ability is unknown and used in an unconscious manner (to augment flight) until it is discovered as a conscious ability by the green dragon Zaranth and her rider Tai in the Thirty-first Turn of the Ninth Pass. It is speculated that the undersized wings were intentionally created in the dragons by Kitti Ping to reduce the surface area of a dragon that is exposed to possible Thread injury, and that the telekinetic abilities were intended to make up for the loss of wingsail. It is said in many books that a dragon can carry whatever it thinks it can carry. This is likely an extension of the telekinesis, mentally &quot;lifting&quot; the extra load. This is the most likely explanation for the great loads that dragons sometimes carry during emergencies.

== Psychology ==
Unlike their fire-lizard ancestors, dragons are fully sentient. They can communicate fluently in human language (although only telepathically), and have personalities and opinions distinct from those of their riders. However, their intelligence does seem to be somewhat lower than that of the average human. In particular, their long-term memory is severely limited.

Dragons&#x27; telepathic communication is usually limited to contact with their rider and with other dragons, however a dragon sometimes communicates well with a person with whom their rider has close emotional ties. They do understand spoken human language and occasionally reply telepathically to people whom they choose to speak.

As a safeguard against the possible damage that could be caused by such powerful creatures, Ping engineered dragons to be profoundly psychologically dependent on their riders. Any dragonet that fails to Impress to a human shortly after hatching will die. If a dragon&#x27;s rider dies, the dragon immediately suicides by going &quot;between&quot; without a destination. The only exception is when the rider of a queen dragon dies while the queen is gravid; the dragon waits just long enough to lay her eggs and see them hatch before disappearing &quot;between&quot;. (Humans who lose their dragons typically commit suicide as well. However, some do survive, although the experience leaves profound psychological trauma.)

Ping also designed the dragons to be fairly calm in temperament. They never fight one another, unless two queens come into estrus at the same time. They are also not dangerous to humans except shortly after hatching, when it is common for confused and frightened dragonets to maul or even kill humans hoping to Impress.

When a dragon hatches, they announce their names to their new riders upon Impression. Pernese dragons&#x27; names always end in -th. A watch-wher&#x27;s name will end in &quot;sk&quot;.

== Colors ==
On canon Pern, barring rare mutations, female dragons and fire-lizards are always either green or gold in color, while males are blue, brown or bronze.

* Gold dragons, also called queens, are the largest dragons (40–45 feet or meters long) and the only fertile females. Gold dragons are by far the rarest dragons on Pern, at just less than one percent of the population. They are dominant over all other colors; any non-gold dragon will invariably obey a queen&#x27;s orders, even against the wishes of its own rider. Queens are incapable of digesting firestone and producing flame (see below); however, they do fight Thread – they fly in the lowest wing, with their riders armed with specially-designed flamethrowers to flame any Thread missed by the wings flying above. An egg that is going to hatch a gold dragon is notable: It is gold-colored and larger than other eggs. A gold dragon will always Impress a heterosexual female and are believed by most Weyrfolk to prefer young women who were not raised in the Weyr.
* Bronze dragons are the largest males (35–45 feet or meters long), although they are generally significantly smaller than the queens. Bronzes account for about five percent of all dragons. They are almost always the ones to mate with queens, as the smaller colors generally lack the stamina to chase and catch the gold dragons when they rise to mate. Due to the 5-1 bronze/gold ratio and the infrequency of gold mating flights, they often mate with greens (the losers of a gold flight almost always seek a green for their needs), but their size often puts them at a disadvantage in chasing the agile, smaller females. The senior bronze of a Weyr is determined through which bronze wins the mating flight of the senior gold. In canon Pern, the rider of a bronze dragon is always a heterosexual male.
* Brown dragons are the next largest color (30–40 feet or meters long). About fifteen percent of all dragons are brown. They may occasionally mate with queens, although this is rare, and becomes even more rare as the dragons increase in size; by Ramoth&#x27;s time in the Ninth Pass it is unheard of. All brown riders in the Pern novels are men; most are heterosexual, but bisexual or &quot;masculine&quot; homosexual brown riders are not rare.
* Blue dragons are the smallest males (24–30 feet or meters long) and make up about a third (thirty percent) of all dragons on Pern. They are nearly as agile as greens, but unlike the greens, they often have enough stamina to last for an entire Threadfall. They mate only with greens, as they are simply too small to keep up with a massive queen over a long mating flight. There are few prominent blue dragons or blue riders in the books. Some assume the position of teaching the new riders after their Impression. Canon blue riders are typically homosexual or bisexual, though some are heterosexual. In interviews, McCaffrey stated that homosexual women may be able to Impress a blue dragon. In the later books written with her son, Todd McCaffrey, blue Tazith is ridden by Xhinna, the first female weyrleader and the first female rider of a blue dragon.
* Green dragons are the smallest normal color (20–24 feet or meters long), and make up about half of all dragons on Pern (fifty percent). They are female, but unlike the queens, they are infertile—due to the chronic use of firestone—and can produce flame. They are extremely valuable in Threadfall because of their agility, but they lack the stamina to last an entire Fall and generally fly in two or three shifts. Originally, greens Impressed only girls; however, after various natural disasters and plagues decimated Pern&#x27;s population, women were needed to help repopulate the planet. Since going &quot;between&quot; during pregnancy can induce miscarriage and because removing pregnant riders from the Wings reduced the effectiveness of the Wings, it became impractical to present large numbers of women as candidates for Impression. Thus, green dragons began Impressing homosexual boys; by the time of the end of the Second Pass, female green riders were becoming rare. By the time of Moreta in the Sixth Pass, female green riders were entirely forgotten, although greens gradually begin Impressing to women again in the Ninth Pass. Females of any sexual orientation may Impress green.
* There is only one white dragon mentioned anywhere in the Pern novels: Ruth, whose rider is Lord Jaxom of Ruatha Hold. He is not an albino, as his hide contains very faint patches of all the normal dragon colors. Ruth&#x27;s egg would not have hatched if Jaxom had not forced it open and released the dragonet from a thick membrane sac; thus, it seems likely that white coloration in dragons is normally a lethal mutation. Although his parents are the largest queen, Ramoth, and largest bronze, Mnementh, in the history of Pern, Ruth is smaller than even a normal green dragon in his time; he is only slightly larger than the largest dragons of the first generation. While his exact length is never specifically mentioned in the books, it does state that he stands higher than a runnerbeast (horse) at the shoulder, extrapolations suggest that he might be 18 feet or meters long. He is male or neuter (undetermined), and assumed sterile, with no urge to mate. Ruth also has the unusual ability to intuitively orient himself in time.

The larger a color is, the less common it is. For instance, there are more blues than browns, and there are more browns than bronzes. Half the dragon population is female, with green dragons being roughly fifty percent of the population and golds being one percent or slightly less.

Riding a larger color of dragon confers higher social status in Pern&#x27;s extremely hierarchical society, color rankings following the dragons&#x27; own strict instinctual hierarchical organization based on fire-lizard structures. Perhaps as a result of this, it is commonly believed that the larger colors are more intelligent, although recent novels imply that this may not be true.

The Pernese believe that chewing firestone makes female dragons sterile; they therefore refuse to allow queens to use it. Greens, on the other hand, are so common that if they produced offspring it would quickly lead to overpopulation. They always chew firestone, and because of their numbers and agility they are vital to any Thread-fighting force. However, &quot;Dragonsdawn&quot; suggests that Kitti Ping—possibly motivated by old-fashioned ideas about gender roles—deliberately engineered greens to be infertile and gold dragons to be incapable of producing flame in order to protect the gold dragons, the only reproductively fertile females, from the dangers of Thread fighting.

== Mating and reproduction ==

=== Mating ===
Both gold and green dragons experience a periodic mating urge. During a Pass a gold dragon will rise roughly once per Turn, and more often at the beginning of a Pass, yet less often towards the end of a Pass. During an Interval a gold dragon may rise to mate only once every four or five Turns. Greens will rise to mate three or four times a Turn, whether this increases or decreases depending on whether or not it is a Pass is unknown. Greens will mate with any male, usually blues or browns. As they are smaller and have less stamina, a green mating flight is much shorter than a gold one.

When a female comes into estrus, interested males compete to catch her in a mating flight. Usually, the female chooses the male who impresses her the most with his skill in the flight, although inexperienced females may be caught before making their choice. The pair actually mate in midair; thus, the higher they get during the flight, the longer their mating can last. The Pernese commonly believe that longer matings result in larger clutches. For this reason, queen riders are strongly encouraged to restrain their dragons from eating heavily just before a flight, instructing them to drink blood instead for a quick burst of energy.

=== Effects on rider sexuality ===
Due to the intense psychic bond between rider and dragon, dragonriders are overcome by the powerful emotions and sensations associated with mating flights. The riders of the mating pair engage in sex themselves, to varying degrees unaware of what they are doing. This contributes to a much looser attitude toward sexuality in general among dragonriders than in the rest of Pernese society.

For much of Pern&#x27;s history, all green riders were male. During these periods, all green mating flights resulted in homosexual intercourse between the riders of the dragons involved. This homosexual intercourse is accepted in the Weyr as being separate from the rider&#x27;s sexual orientation unless the rider has shown otherwise. Mating flight sex between two riders, one of whom is not the other&#x27;s chosen partner (known as a weyrmate) is not considered to be &quot;cheating&quot;. It is understood within the Weyr that sex during mating flights is not optional for the rider. Anne McCaffrey stated that &quot;The dragon decides, the rider complies.&quot; Dragons do not usually consider the orientation of their riders when considering what female they wish to chase, or, for a female dragon, what male dragon might catch her. A primary example of this behavior is between Weyrleader T&#x27;gellan, Weyrwoman Talina, and green rider Mirrim. T&#x27;gellan and Mirrim are weyrmates, but T&#x27;gellan&#x27;s bronze dragon must mate with Weyrwoman Talina&#x27;s gold dragon at least yearly in order for T&#x27;gellan to maintain his position as Weyrleader. Mirrim, known to be an extremely acerbic and temperamental rider, shows no jealousy or other problem with her weyrmate&#x27;s regular sexual contact with Talina.

=== Effects on non-rider sexuality ===
Both green and gold dragons broadcast their sexual feelings on a wide band during mating flights. Weyrfolk tend to become somewhat inured to this and therefore can hold their sexual reactions until an appropriate place and time. However, flights are usually not over the Weyr itself and sometimes the flight path of the mating flight brings the mating dragons over Holds or Farmholds where the average people occasionally find themselves engaged in unexpected activities. This is especially common among young teens working out in the fields who react to the sudden, unexpected and overwhelming urges with potentially embarrassing results.

Riders of the losing dragons usually seek sexual relief after the intense flight; if they do not have a chosen partner they may seek the comfort of any willing and available partner of their sexual orientation. The weyrfolk tend to happily accommodate these riders, especially if they have been affected by the flight&#x27;s sexual urgency. This is one of the major reasons for the Weyr&#x27;s reputation for being sexually very open.

== Fandom considerations ==
Anne McCaffrey has stated in a number of documents and interviews that dragonets use pheromones to determine the sexual orientation of the humans to whom they Impress. According to these statements, greens Impress only to women or to &quot;effeminate&quot; homosexual men. Blues Impress primarily to homosexual or bisexual men with &quot;masculine&quot; temperaments, or possibly to masculine or lesbian women; browns similarly Impress primarily to heterosexual men, but sometimes to bisexual men. Bronzes and golds Impress exclusively to heterosexual men and heterosexual women, respectively.

However, these ideas have never been made explicit in the books (although it is clear, at least, that most male green and blue riders are homosexual). Many members of online Pern fandom find McCaffrey&#x27;s ideas about sexuality highly questionable for a number of reasons, both scientific and ethical. (Most infamously, she claimed in an interview that science has proven that being the receptive partner in anal sex triggers a hormonal change that will make a previously heterosexual man become homosexual and effeminate. Thus, she argues, even if a male green rider were originally heterosexual, he would not stay that way.) In later interviews McCaffrey claims that green dragons merely pick up on psychological clues from homosexual boys before they themselves know that they are homosexual. &quot;A green Hatchling is unlikely to be impressed (pun intended) by a heterosexual boy.&quot; - Anne McCaffrey 1998 on The Kitchen Table BB.

Pern-based roleplaying games thus sometimes ignore McCaffrey&#x27;s restrictions on who can Impress to a given color of dragon. MUDs and fanzine-based clubs often ignore everything except the basic rule that only women Impress gold and only men Impress bronze; PBEM games are more likely to accept the restrictions on sexual orientation. Most clubs post their policy on canon strictness. While some accept more liberal thoughts on color/gender/sexual orientation matches, many are very strict on this issue.

For the purposes of roleplaying games, McCaffrey has also officially allowed females (masculine lesbians) to ride browns or blues, though she insists that this could never happen on &quot;her&quot; (canon) Pern.

Also in fandom, if a rider has strong objections to sex with someone involved in a mating flight or the writer has objections to writing a homosexual encounter or object to their character being involved in a sexual encounter with a person other than their &quot;significant other,&quot; they may sequester themselves with a more acceptable partner during the flight. This idea is called &quot;Stand-Ins&quot; and based on a concept McCaffrey introduced in Dragonseye/Red Star Rising, in which a female green rider objects to the idea of a specific bronze rider winning her green&#x27;s mating flight. However, this concept is not seen in other books and clearly does not exist in the Ninth Pass, as several problems arise regarding green and gold riders who object to the random nature of mating flights and end up raped by the male winner of the flight (most notably in Skies of Pern).

== Significance ==
As the primary line of defense against the Thread, dragons are a requirement for the survival and prosperity of humans and other land life on Pern. However, the great beasts require a good deal of maintenance, to the degree of requiring a large part of Pernese infrastructure—especially cattle farming—to be centered around their upkeep. This has been known to cause resentment among those doing the supporting, especially in times when Thread is not falling.

== Significant Pernese Dragons ==
* Ramoth (gold), ridden by Ninth Pass Benden Weyrwoman Lessa. Ramoth is the largest dragon in Pern&#x27;s history, and together with Lessa rediscovers the lost knowledge that dragons are capable of time travel. She is described as having a beautiful mental voice in the short story &quot;The Girl Who Heard Dragons&quot;.
* Mnementh (bronze), ridden by Ninth Pass Benden Weyrleader F&#x27;lar. Although significantly smaller than Ramoth, Mnementh is the largest bronze in the history of Pern. He is described as having a deep, rich mental voice.
* Canth (brown), ridden by F&#x27;nor of Benden Weyr (F&#x27;lar&#x27;s half-brother) during the Ninth Pass. He and F&#x27;nor make the first known attempt by the Pernese to teleport to the surface of another planet. Canth is also unusually large for his color – large enough to rival a small bronze in size – and is the first brown in centuries to attempt participation in a queen&#x27;s mating flight.
* Ruth (white), ridden by Lord Jaxom of Ruatha Hold, during the Ninth Pass. Ruth is the only known white dragon in Pern&#x27;s history, and the only dragon to be ridden by a reigning Lord Holder. He has a much higher intelligence compared to that of many other dragons, and always knows &quot;when&quot; as well as &quot;where&quot; he is in time and space.
* Orlith (gold), ridden by Sixth Pass Fort Weyrwoman Moreta, who is one of the most famous dragonriders of Pernese history. Moreta&#x27;s deeds are celebrated in the well-known song &quot;The Ballad of Moreta&#x27;s Ride.&quot;
* Faranth (gold), ridden by First Pass Fort Weyrwoman Sorka Hanrahan; Faranth is not the first queen to hatch, mate or lay eggs (she was actually one of the last of her clutch) but she is the first Senior Gold, ridden by the first Weyrwoman. By later Passes, her status is confused with being the first gold in existence. Although Pern has no real religious beliefs, Faranth comes to occupy ambiguous status in later Pernese culture; &quot;by the egg of Faranth&quot; is a common oath.
* Path (green), ridden by Mirrim of Benden Weyr during the Ninth Pass. Path is the first green in several centuries to Impress to a female rider, picking Mirrim when she was not a Candidate.
* Zaranth (green), ridden by Tai of Monaco Bay after the ending of the Ninth Pass. Zaranth is the first Pernese dragon to consciously use telekinesis and communicate this ability to other dragons.
* Golanth (bronze), ridden by F&#x27;lessan, son of Lessa and F&#x27;lar at the end of the Ninth Pass. F&#x27;lessan and Golanth are the first to create a Weyrhold -specifically Honshū Weyrhold- where dragons and their riders can live in smaller groups once Thread no longer falls on Pern, without relying on tithes.

<text>Concepción () is a city and district in northern Paraguay and capital of the Concepción Department. It lies next to the Paraguay River.

Founded by a Spanish Governor, named Agustín Fernado de Pinedo, the town prospered in the early years of the 20th century, as a centre for the north of the country, exploiting the new wealth of the Gran Chaco, and a river port. The town was also a centre for the Paraguayan Civil War of 1947. The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Concepción en Paraguay.

==Transportation==
Route 5 &quot;Gral. Bernardino Caballero&quot; connects the city with Pedro Juan Caballero and Asunción.

==Climate==
Concepción has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: &quot;Aw&quot;) with abundant annual precipitation, although possessing a highly prominent summer peak. Summers are very hot, rainy, and often oppressively humid. Severe thunderstorms are very common in the summer and have the capability to dump copious amounts of rainfall in a short period of time, along with destructively high winds and occasional hail. Winter is much drier and considerably cooler, with near drought-like conditions often prevailing. Concepción is also located in very close proximity to the Tropic of Capricorn, with the latitudinal line lying just south of the city.
==Consular representation==
Brazil has a Vice-consulate in Concepción.

<text>Madhouse is a 1990 American black comedy film starring Kirstie Alley and John Larroquette. Written and directed by Tom Ropelewski, it was produced by Leslie Dixon and released by Orion Pictures.

== Plot ==
Stockbroker Mark Bannister and his TV reporter/anchorwoman wife Jessie are a yuppie couple with an idyllic California life. It is interrupted when Mark&#x27;s cousin Fred, and his pregnant wife Bernice fly in from New Jersey. The first days are chaotic thanks to Bernice&#x27;s cat Scruffy. Mark gives them $300 to spend in the city, but his alone time with Jessie is interrupted when her gold-digger sister Claudia arrives after a fight with her rich Middle Eastern husband Kaddir, whom she divorces after he cancels her credit cards. Fred and Bernice&#x27;s visit, meant to last only five days, is extended when Bernice falls on the way to the car. She is instructed by her doctor, Dr. Penix, to stay put until the baby is born.

At a bar, Mark motivates Fred to quit being Bernice&#x27;s pet. However, Fred takes the message too far and leaves &quot;to find himself.&quot; Meanwhile, Mark&#x27;s next door neighbor and carpenter Dale builds a machine to keep Bernice comfortable in bed all day. Bernice constantly insists on being waited on hand and foot and demands funerals and burials for Scruffy, who dies multiple times but comes back each time. Claudia&#x27;s son Jonathan also comes to live with them. Jessie tries getting Dale to seduce Claudia. However, Mark and Jessie inadvertently burn down Dale&#x27;s villa. Since it cannot be rebuilt for three months, Dale and his two teens, delinquent son C.K. and phone-obsessed daughter Katy, move in, and Mark and Jessie are forced to take them in to avoid an arson lawsuit. Meanwhile, Mark helps Jonathan get a job as a mailroom clerk at his office.

Days later, chaos persists, and Mark and Jessie are essentially forced out of their own home. When Mark fails to show up for work, his friend and colleague Wes finds the couple outside living like hippies. Wes motivates Mark to resist a little longer; he is on the verge of closing a deal for his boss, Bob Grindle. At work, Mark gets a box from Bogota containing cocaine—sent to him but requested by Jonathan. Grindle tells Mark to sell a set of stocks due to a scandal, but Mark forgets to before leaving work with the cocaine. Fred returns, having grown a mustache and acquiring a baby elephant. Police arrive at the house and find Scruffy ODing on cocaine; they destroy the Bannister house during the drug bust, which Jessie&#x27;s TV station televises. Seeing it, the overstressed Jessie bursts into a mental breakdown on live TV. Pushed to their limit and facing ruin and imminent charges, Mark and Jessie decide to abandon the house to their guests and leave town to start new lives.

The next day, returning to salvage what they can, Mark and Jessie hear a recording from Dr. Penix stating that Bernice was actually never pregnant, and their last shred of sanity dissolves. Enraged, Jessie catapults Bernice from her bed to the backyard and forces her to confess to knowing of this. She then ruins Claudia&#x27;s expensive clothes to force her out, while Mark terrorizes Dale with an electric saw until he and his kids leave. Lastly, Jessie puts fireworks in Jonathan&#x27;s cocaine bag, which explodes as he tries to flee in Dale&#x27;s (loaner) Lotus. Mark and Jessie then threaten to torch their own house to keep their visitors away for good. The police arrive and apologize, stating that their only evidence—Scruffy—disappeared, and that they will pay for all damages incurred. Grindle arrives and, believing Mark meant to keep the stocks, declares that he amassed a small fortune when the scandal was found to be false. He offers Mark some of the profit and a promotion. Claudia takes the opportunity to seduce Grindle, and Dale flirts with one of the officers, much to C.K&#x27;s chagrin. Scruffy returns from the police-station evidence room, but is determined to stay with Mark and Jessie. Bernice and Fred depart, with Fred taking more control than before. Jessie and Mark are about to get cozy, but first Mark smashes their ever-malfunctioning toilet with a sledgehammer.

Jessie&#x27;s furious on-air outburst earns her her own TV show, and she and Mark move into a three-bedroom house in Malibu and live happily ever after, until their parents came to visit.

<text>Pedro Juan Caballero () is a Paraguayan city in the Amambay Department of which it is the capital. The city lies on the border with the Brazilian city of Ponta Porã in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul and is known as a centre for cheap electronic and consumer goods, and also as a centre for drug smuggling. This city is the highest city in Paraguay at 670 m (2201 ft) above sea level and is named after Pedro Juan Caballero.

==History==

Pedro Juan Caballero originated around a small lake. The city based its economy initially on the processing of yerba mate (it is located in the south end of the herds of Tacurupyta, that, after the War of the Triple Alliance, were almost totally passed into the hands of Brazil) and the forest exploitation. On December 1, 1899, a police station was built, near the Punta Porá Lagoon, a date that is considered to be that of the creation of the city. Some scholars, however, consider that the correct date of foundation is August 30, 1901. In 1899, merchant Don Jorge Casaccia, owner of large tracts of land, plantations and an import-export company founded at the end of the War of the Triple Alliance, a large shareholder of &quot;La Industrial Paraguaya&quot; and the &quot;Mercantile Bank&quot;, ceded to the government a land for the settlement of the population, according to SA Cardona.

The first house was built in 1894, owned by Don Jose Tapia Ortiz, although it actually settled in a place called &quot;Portera&quot;, a year after the foundation of Ponta Porã. But as early as 1893, Don Pablino Ramirez had settled with his wagons and footpaths on the shores of Lake Punta Porá, making it difficult to known for sure who was the first &quot;official&quot; Pedrojuanino. Pedro Juan Caballero was founded on December 1, 1900. On December 13, 1901, the first peace court was created, with José Ramón Giménez as the first judge. On December 29, 1905, the Junta Económico Administrativa was created to carry out activities very similar to those of the present communes and municipalities.

<text>Humaitá is a town and district on the Paraguay River in southern Paraguay. During the Paraguayan War, it served as the main Paraguayan stronghold from 1866 until its fall in August 1868. Up to 24,000 troops were housed there at one point. It served as the de facto residence of the Paraguayan government until March 1868.

Being 275km south of Asunción, Hamuaitá has a great historical and cultural heritage, with portions of the old fortifications—including some large earthworks—still visible. It also possesses the remains of a Jesuit church dating from the 18th century.

== Toponymy ==

Humaitá comes from the Guaraní words &quot; (meaning ancient) and &quot; (meaning stone).

== Geography ==
The predominant geography in the zone is a sheet of low areas, of whitish land, without prominent waviness. Due to the proximity of the Paraguay River, the increase of the waves overwhelms the whole bordering zone, therefore the geopolitical importance that the city had in the past.

=== Climate ===
The climate is subtropical, with temperatures reaching -2 °C in winter and 40 °C in the summer.

== History ==


The remains of the old fortress of Humaitá are located on the left side of the Paraguay River, approximately 430 km to the south of Asunción.
During the Paraguayan War (1864–1870) this fortress was important because it controlled river access to the capital, Asunción.

The defenses of Humaitá were begun by Carlos Antonio López (1790–1862). The ruins of the church and possibly the town museum are the only remains of the installation.

== Economy ==

The inhabitants fish, raise cattle, and practice small-scale agriculture.

Local crafts include vases, gauntlets, pictures in burlap, and articles made from vegetable sponges. Carpets, tapestries, tablecloths, and crocheted apparel are also produced.

== Transportation ==
Humaitá may be reached via Route 1 from Asunción, after reaching San Ignacio, take the detour to Pilar. Humaitá also may be reached through the new Villeta–Alberdi–Pilar Route 

One may also take the bus from Asunción to Pilar and transfer to an interurban bus that serves Humaitá.

== Patrimony ==

The city has a rich historical patrimony. Humaitá was more involved than any other city in the Paraguayan War. The Paraguayan army used this city to contain the invasion by the Alliance. By the end of the war, the city had been wrecked by the invading troops.

The &quot;Cuartel de López&quot;, a museum in Francisco Solano López&#x27;s former barracks, has three rooms where bullets, cannons, stirrups, spurs, swords, and other battlefield relics are displayed.

== Tourism ==

Many tourists visit Humaitá. Students from all over Paraguay come to view the vestiges of the Paraguayan War, as do Uruguayan, Brazilian, Paraguayan and Argentine military men and civilians from throughout America and Europe.

* Ruins of Humaitá. Only a few vestiges survived bombardment by enemy cannons during the war. One of these was San Carlos Borromeo&#x27;s church. Carlos Antonio López ordered its construction. It was inaugurated on January 1, 1861. At the time, it was considered one of the most beautiful in the Americas.
* Itapunta
* Curupayty
* Estero Bellaco

Hotels in the city include the Municipal Hotel, with Italianate architecture, constructed at the end of the 19th century. Many historians believe that Stroessner stayed there during the 1947 revolution.

== Fishing ==

Due to its location on the Paraguay River, Humaitá is also a popular place to fish. Fish such as Mandi&#x27;i, catfish, piranha, armado, duck, dorado, surubí, and pacú provide the main income of fishermen. Milanese surubí is a popular dish in local restaurants.

<text>Manuel Piñeiro Losada (14 March 1933 - 11 March 1998), also known as Commander Barbarroja (&quot;es: &quot;red beard&quot;&quot;) was a Cuban political and military figure, a leader of the Cuban Revolution, and, between 1961 and 1964, the first head of the Dirección General de Inteligencia of Cuba. Under Piñeiro, the DGI supported armed struggles in Latin America, helping radical leftist guerrilla groups in the region. Between 1964 and 1968, Piñeiro acted as the Deputy Minister of the Interior of Cuba, during this time he was in charge of the state security apparatus. A Soviet reorganization of the DGI forced Piñeiro out of his position, and he was placed in charge of the DGI&#x27;s Latin American affairs division.

==Biography==
Manuel Piñeiro Losada was born on 14 March 1933 in Matanzas, Cuba. His family, who had immigrated to Cuba from the Spanish region of Galicia, was relatively prosperous—his father was a Bacardi executive. After participating in the student protests against the 10 March 1952 &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; which brought dictator Fulgencio Batista to power, Piñeiro&#x27;s family sent him to study business management at Columbia University in New York. There, he met his first wife, Lorna Burdsall, whom he married in 1955. While studying in the United States, Piñeiro began to oppose the social, racial, and political discrimination he saw there and felt the need to return to Cuba. He returned in 1955 and became a founder of the 26th of July Movement.

Soon after returning to Cuba, Piñiero was arrested by Batista&#x27;s security agencies because of his underground political activities. After his release, he continued his clandestine activities in Havana. He discovered that he was under police surveillance, and decided that it was better to leave for the Eastern Sierra Maestra mountain range and join the guerrillas headed by Fidel Castro. After the Cuban Revolution, Piñiero was appointed Deputy Minister of the Interior and the head of the &quot;Technical Viceministerio&quot;, the body that would be later responsible for gathering intelligence and developing strategies to expand communism in Latin America. In 1997, Piñeiro announced his retirement, resigning from all active government positions. He began to write and edit books about his experience in the Cuban Revolution.

Piñeiro died in a car accident on March 11, 1998. He was on his way home after receiving a tribute commemorating the creation of the Eastern Front.

==Role in the Cuban Revolution==
In March 1958, he was recognized for his merits and was personally chosen by Fidel Castro to be the officer tasked with integrating the recently created Eastern Front II &quot;Frank País&quot;, under the command of Fidel&#x27;s younger brother, Raúl.

During that time, he held several meetings with members of the Batistas&#x27; Cuban Army.
Subsequently, he was appointed Chief of Personnel and Inspection, a position that included responsibilities for the Intelligence Service and the recently created &quot;Policía Rebelde&quot;, which was a predecessor of Castro&#x27;s Revolutionary Police.

During the battle for Santiago de Cuba, he was promoted to &quot;Commander of the Cuban Revolution&quot;. After the triumph of the Revolution, he was appointed &quot;Chief of the Military Plaza&quot; in Santiago de Cuba, the second largest city in the country.

It is at this time that his face is caught by photographic cameras for the first time, showing his red beard and revealing the reason of the nickname given to him by the rebel troops.

He was then transferred to Havana, where he served various functions in the creation of the intelligence agencies and security of the new Castro regime. During the Bay of Pigs Invasion, Piñeiro was deputy to Ramiro Valdés Menéndez, head of G-2 (Seguridad del Estado, or state security).

On June 6, 1961, he was appointed Deputy Minister of the Interior and head of the so-called Technical Viceministerio, the body that would be later responsible for gathering intelligence and developing strategies to expand communism in Latin America.

In 1965, he was appointed to the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party, a post he held until 1997.

That same year in Havana, he received the visit of Markus Wolf, director of the East German secret police (the Stasi). Wolf, whose real identity would only be known to the Western intelligence services in 1979, had gone to Cuba to advise the socialist government how to set up the new General Intelligence Directorate on the island.

In early 1975, Piñeiro was head of the &quot;Américas Department&quot; of the Cuban Communist Party&#x27;s Central Committee.

In 1997, he resigned all his active government positions and started to write and edit books dedicated to a retrospective analysis of the Cuban Revolution.

<text>Filadelfia () is the capital of Boquerón Department in the Gran Chaco of western Paraguay. It is the centre of the Fernheim Colony. The city lies about northwest of the capital Asunción. With a population of about 20,000, it is the largest town in the 400 kilometer (250 mile) radius, and accounts for almost a third of the departmental population.

==History==
Filadelfia was founded in 1930 by Russian Mennonites who fled from the Soviet Union. Filadelfia lay near the front of the Chaco War, but was little affected. It became divided in the Second World War, with some of the original German colonists supporting Germany and later being expelled. 

Filadelfia has developed into an important cattle herding settlement.

== Infrastructure ==
Today the town is home to a museum, a library, a radio station and a hospital. The museum displays objects from the town&#x27;s Mennonite past, like Russian overcoats, and the local wildlife, such as stuffed armadillos, anteaters, and toads. The colony&#x27;s villages lie around Filadelfia, as do several native reserves, home to much of the area&#x27;s native population, from the Chulupí, Lengua, Toba-Pilaga, Ayoreo and Sanapaná groups. A modern supermarket is located in the centre of the town, which is the last place to get groceries before heading further out into the Chaco. Most of the town&#x27;s potable water supply is drawn from underground cisterns, being replenished by intermittent rainfall; the underground water is too salty to drink. A small commemorative park known as Parque Trebol lies about to the east of town. It now serves as a place for visitors to camp for the night.

==Transportation==
The newly asphalted highway, PY09, from Asunción continues past Filadelfia for another and runs out at the military checkpoint Mariscal Estigarribia. From this point onwards, the road to the border town fort General Eugenio A. Garay with Bolivia is almost impassable.

==Notable people==
*A distinguished Russian Mennonite writer and historian living in Filadelfia was Peter P. Klassen.
*Former Canadian Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews was born in Filadelfia in 1952.

<text>Maxwell Grant was a pen name used by the authors of &quot;The Shadow&quot; pulp magazine stories from the 1930s to 1960s.

Street &amp; Smith, the publishers of &quot;The Shadow&quot;, hired author Walter B. Gibson to create and write the series based on popular interest in the character who was first used as a radio narrator. However, Gibson was asked to use a pen name. The pen name was used primarily so numerous authors could write the stories without confusing readers. Another factor was how Gibson, also a nonfiction writer, wanted to use a pen name for his fiction. He adopted the pen name Maxwell Grant, taking the name from two stage magic dealers he knew: Maxwell Holden and U.F. Grant.

Gibson wrote the vast majority of &quot;Shadow&quot; stories, usually two short novels per month for &quot;The Shadow&quot; magazine. Four authors besides Gibson have used the Maxwell Grant pen name: Theodore Tinsley, who wrote 27 Shadow stories between 1936 and 1943; Lester Dent, who wrote one story, &quot;The Golden Vulture&quot;, in 1938; Bruce Elliott, who wrote 15 Shadow stories between 1946 and 1948; and Dennis Lynds, who wrote nine Shadow paperback novels between 1964 and 1967.

The comic book series &quot;The Shadow: Year One&quot;, published by Dynamite Entertainment, features a character by the name of &quot;Maxwell Grant&quot;. The character is a journalist, who uncovers the identity of the Shadow. However, rather than exposing him, Grant offers to chronicle his adventures.

<text>Lycoming College is a private liberal arts college in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1812, Lycoming College is affiliated with the United Methodist Church but operates as an independent institution. Through its history, it has been an academy, seminary, junior college, and four-year college. 

==History==
Lycoming College traces its roots to 1812 and the founding of the &quot;Williamsport Academy for the Education of Youth in English and other languages, in the useful arts, science and literature&quot;. Eight spirited citizens secured the charter for the school and founded the academy to improve the educational opportunities of the community. Attendance was by subscription, although a state grant ensured that a number of underprivileged children would be taught free of charge. The academy was for boys but accepted girls in the 1830s. It was one of the early academics in Pennsylvania which placed it on the frontier of academy-based education in the state.

By 1847, Williamsport had a public school system in place. Benjamin H. Crever, a Methodist preacher based in Milton, heard the academy was for sale. Upon his recommendation, the Baltimore Conference purchased the school, which opened in the fall of 1848 as the Williamsport Dickinson Seminary, a preparatory school for Dickinson College, another Methodist school.

Rev. Crever is considered to be the founder of Lycoming College, as he was the one to transition the high school into its collegiate beginnings. After turning the Williamsport Academy into an institution of higher learning, Crever moved on to serve as a chaplain in the Civil War and founded a total of four schools. Only Lycoming College remains as his educational legacy.

In 1921, John W. Long became the ninth president of the school. A pastor at St. Paul&#x27;s Methodist Church in State College and founder of the Wesley Foundation at Pennsylvania State College, now Penn State University, he had pastoral experience and working with students. He became president of three institutions without moving. He transformed Williamsport Dickinson Seminary into Williamsport Dickinson Seminary and Junior College in 1929. It was the first private junior college in the state and another frontier in higher education in America.

In 1947, the school became Lycoming College, a four-year school. The college adopted the name &quot;Lycoming&quot; in 1948, a Native American word for a nearby stream which means &quot;sandy stream&quot; and the name of the county. These changes came with substantial support from the college&#x27;s board of trustees and the local community. In 1949, the college conferred its first baccalaureate degrees.

James E. Douthat became the 14th president in 1989. Under his leadership, the college&#x27;s enrollment grew by 27 percent and its endowment and other funds under management increased from $17 million to more than $185 million. Since his arrival, the campus had been involved in a strategic planning process to continually evaluate student needs and adapt the College&#x27;s programs to those needs. Under his leadership, the college saw the establishment and implementation of a new faculty governance structure, a major capital campaign to build the endowment, improved facilities, and the adoption of a revised curriculum for the college that responds to changing skill set needs.

Kent C. Trachte became Lycoming&#x27;s 15th president in 2013. He has continued many of the important themes of his predecessor, including working closely with the board of trustees and the faculty. He launched a new long-range planning effort, many of its goals achieved. The college is now into another long-range planning era. He presided over the completion of the Lynn Science Center, generated interest in and led the construction of the Krapf Gateway Center as the new entrance of the campus, and the construction of a new music practice building opened in November 2022.

He has led the college in a new campus-community project to revitalize the Old Town section of Williamsport and he has led the college in a major effort to open its doors to students more representative of a diverse American society.

== Rankings ==
Lycoming was ranked 107th among &quot;National Liberal Arts Colleges&quot; in 2024 U.S. News &amp; World Report, and 29th in Social Mobility. It is listed as a &quot;Best College&quot; in &quot;The Princeton Review&#x27;s&quot; Best 387 Colleges for 2021 and 61st by Washington Monthly in 2020.

==Academics==
Lycoming College confers both Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in more than 43 major fields of study offered and more than 66 minors.

===Interdisciplinary program===

With the Lycoming College interdisciplinary program, students have the opportunity to design their own programs of study. By combining courses from more than one department, students become active participants in creating their own majors with support from faculty advisor(s) and a panel of faculty members from each of the sponsoring departments.

===Special academic programs===

The Lycoming Scholars Program is a special program designed to meet the needs and aspirations of highly motivated students of superior intellectual ability. Lycoming Scholars participate in special, semester-long, interdisciplinary seminars on topics chosen by the faculty and students on the Scholars Council.

Pre-professional programs including pre-law, pre-med, pre-vet, and pre-ministry provide students with advisors who ensure students take the right courses to prepare for graduate school and success in these professions.

Lycoming&#x27;s MBA 4-1 agreement with the Saunders College Business at Rochester Institute of Technology allows students to opt out of some graduate-level courses, saving on tuition costs and completing their MBA in one calendar year.

An engineering 3-2 partnership with the prestigious Watson School of Engineering at Binghamton University allows students to spend their first three years building foundational knowledge at Lycoming and a final two years completing an electrical or industrial engineering degree at Binghamton.

==Campus==

Lycoming College rests on a 42-acre campus in north central Pennsylvania. Most buildings have been constructed since 1950 in a pre-Georgian style, and many have been refurbished since. The most recently constructed buildings include the Lynn Science Center (2015), adjacently connected to the Heim Science Center and holding the Detwiler Planetarium, and the Krapf Gateway Center (2019) which houses the Office of Admissions, Office of Alumni and Advancement, the Center for Enhanced Academic Experiences, and the Outdoor Leadership and Education program.
Lycoming&#x27;s academic facilities include Wendle Hall, the Academic Center, Fine Arts Building, Communications Building, Heim Science Center, Clarke Chapel, Mary Lindsay Welch Honors Hall, and the Lynn Science Center.

Unique facilities include the Detwiler Planetarium, Mary L. Welch Theatre, Snowden Library, the Sylk Digital Arts Laboratory, an electronic music studio, a radio station, and a greenhouse.

Athletic facilities include Lamade Gymnasium, the Keiper Recreation Center, and an outdoor intramural field. The 12-acre Shangraw Athletic Complex lies a few blocks north of the main campus with football and softball fields as well as the UPMC Field for soccer and lacrosse.

The Lycoming College Art Gallery is located at 25 West Fourth Street in downtown Williamsport. Additionally, the Lycoming Biology Field Station Inc., a nonprofit corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Lycoming College, sits on 116 acres of land just 15 minutes from campus, which is frequently used by the biology department and the Clean Water Institute.

==Athletics==
Today, Lycoming fields men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams in basketball, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, and tennis, men&#x27;s teams in baseball, football, golf, and wrestling, and women&#x27;s teams in field hockey, softball, and volleyball. Lycoming was a member in the Middle Atlantic Conferences, with the baseball, basketball, field hockey, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, golf, softball, and volleyball teams competing in the MAC Freedom, but the athletic department accepted an invitation to move 18 of its 19 sports to the Landmark Conference, starting in 2023-24. 

The Warriors have won 43 Middle Atlantic Conference titles, with football and wrestling winning 15 each, men&#x27;s basketball six, men&#x27;s soccer three, women&#x27;s swimming and volleyball two, and men&#x27;s tennis and softball one.

Lycoming College celebrated its 125th year of varsity athletics in 2015, as a baseball team was first formed at Dickinson Seminary in 1890. In 1952, Lycoming, recently becoming an established four-year college, was invited to join the Middle Atlantic Conference.

The football team had a period where it was one of the most competitive in Division III football, as College Football Hall of Fame head coach Frank Girardi won 257 games from 1972 to 2007, which still ranks 16th all-time in NCAA history. He led the Warriors to the national title game in 1990 and 1997 and the semifinals in 1996.

==Residential living ==
Lycoming College is a residential campus that requires students to live in campus housing, with a few exceptions including local students who are able to commute from home. The college offers numerous housing options, including eight residence halls: Skeath, Asbury, East, Wesley, Rich, Williams, Crever, and Forest, as well as the Douthat Commons student apartments and several College-owned apartments. They can also choose to live in several different College-owned apartment buildings adjacent to campus.

Dining options include Wertz Dining Hall open seven days a week for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Café 1812 and the Gateway Café offer breakfast and lunch five days a week, and Jack&#x27;s Corner offers a late night bite to eat. The college serves its own Warrior Coffee through Lycoming&#x27;s Warrior Coffee Project, an interdisciplinary program that collaborates with people of the El Naranjito region in the Dominican Republic. The academic buildings with computer labs and printers are open to students 24/7.

Students at Lycoming enjoy the long-established on-campus traditions the college offers. This includes Thanksgiving dinner served family-style by faculty and staff and a Late Night Breakfast served by faculty and staff during finals week.

== École de Physique des Houches ==
The village is home to a famous physics summer school (the École de Physique des Houches), founded by Cécile DeWitt-Morette. It has been attended by two dozen Nobel prize laureates, either as teachers or as students before they received their prizes. Additionally, the Les Houches Accords, which are important in high energy physics, were written here.

==Coupeau and La Flatière==
Opposite Les Houches (across the River Arve, but forming part of the commune) is the small village of Coupeau. A circuitous road climbs high through the village and leads for some three miles all the way up to the foot of its own mountain, l&#x27;Aiguillette, at the foot of which lies another small village, La Flatière, well known across the valley for its panoramic views, and a little Christian hermitage. From here many paths wander through the mountains. One scenic path leads to an old sheepfold, called Chailloux.
Coupeau has sun all year round, whereas Les Houches for the most part, remains in the shade in the winter. At the heart of the village of Coupeau is the Merlet animal park, which draws many visitors each year. Here visitors can see llamas as well as local types of deer, rams, and marmots. Below the animal park, a four-storey high statue of Jesus Christ overlooks the valley, its right arm outstretched as if greeting newcomers entering the valley below.

<doc id="1042138" wikidata="Q3041883" url="?curid=1042138" title="Dwight Duncan">
<text>Dwight Duncan (born 3 January 1959) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2013 who represented ridings of Windsor—Walkerville, Windsor—St. Clair and Windsor—Tecumseh. He was a senior member in the government of Dalton McGuinty who served in several cabinet roles including Deputy Premier and Minister of Finance.

==Background==
Duncan was born in Windsor, and attended high school at Assumption College School. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics from McGill University and a Master of Business Administration from the University of Windsor. He has been a member of the Liberal Party since the early 1970s, and skipped class in 1972 to attend a rally for his political hero, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.

Duncan&#x27;s first full-time job after graduating from university was in the office of federal Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) Herb Gray. He later worked for provincial Labour Minister Bill Wrye between 1985 and 1987. Duncan was Administrator of Brentwood Recovery Centre, Canada&#x27;s largest alcohol and drug rehabilitation centre, between 1987 and 1995. He also served on Windsor City Council from 1988 until 1994, when he chose not to seek re-election in order to prepare for his first provincial campaign.

==Opposition member==

Duncan was first elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1995 provincial election, defeating New Democratic Party incumbent Wayne Lessard by 380 votes in Windsor—Walkerville. The Progressive Conservative Party won a majority government in this election, and Duncan became a member of the official opposition. Between 1995 and 1999, he served as his party&#x27;s critic for Labour, Privatization, Housing, Transportation, and the Workers Compensation Board.

Duncan became a candidate for the Ontario Liberal Party leadership following the resignation of Lyn McLeod in 1996. His campaign plan combined a cautious fiscal strategy with plans for increased investment in health and education, and his leading supporters included Sean Conway, Tim Murphy and Mike Colle. He finished third on the first and second ballots at the party&#x27;s 1996 leadership convention, but was eliminated after falling to fourth place behind Dalton McGuinty on the third. Duncan then endorsed Gerard Kennedy, who lost to McGuinty on the fifth ballot.

Duncan&#x27;s 1995 opponent, Wayne Lessard, won a by-election for a different Windsor constituency in 1997. For the 1999 provincial election, redistribution forced the two MPPs to face one other a second time in Windsor—St. Clair. Duncan was again successful, defeating Lessard by over 4,000 votes. The Progressive Conservatives won a second majority government, and Duncan became opposition House Leader on 25 June 1999. He also served as Liberal Party critic for Municipal Affairs and the Management Board of Cabinet over the next four years.

==Cabinet minister==

The Liberals won a majority government in the 2003 provincial election. Duncan was appointed Minister of Energy and Government House Leader on 23 October 2003.

===Minister of Energy (first time)===

One of Duncan&#x27;s primary responsibilities as Energy Minister was managing Ontario Power Generation, which was in an extremely troubled state when the Liberals assumed power in 2003. A damning report into systemic mismanagement at OPG was issued shortly after the new government assumed power, and several high-level executives were forced to submit their resignations. Duncan appointed a new interim board led by former federal Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Jake Epp to lead the organization&#x27;s renewal.

Duncan subsequently announced plans for a comprehensive audit of OPG, when its budgetary shortfall was found to be $850 million. Reports in early 2004 indicated that Tory advisers with close ties to Mike Harris and Ernie Eves had received untendered contracts worth $5.6 million in 1999, when the Progressive Conservatives were still in government. The OPG&#x27;s situation improved under its new management, and it was able to post a $42 million profit in 2005.

Duncan issued a strategic report from the Electricity Conservation and Supply Task Force in January 2004. The report called for Ontario to emphasize energy conservation, while also ensuring &quot;reliability, diversity and affordability&quot;, and consumer protection. Two months later, Duncan brought forward a conservation plan highlighted by the use of &quot;smart&quot; electricity meters to discourage overuse during peak hours. The government plans to have smart meters installed throughout the province by 2010.

In April 2004, Duncan announced the creation of a new body called the Ontario Power Authority to purchase energy for the province and plan its long-term energy strategy. Duncan argued that the body would &quot;depoliticize&quot; energy debates in Ontario. Most energy companies supported this decision, while a number of environmental groups criticized it. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; raised concerns over the authority&#x27;s expanding budget in late 2006, but Duncan argued that its expenses are necessary to create a planning regime for the future.

Hydro rates increased twice during Duncan&#x27;s first tenure as Energy Minister. The Liberal Party had campaigned on a pledge to keep energy rates frozen until 2006, but reconsidered their options after discovering a $5.6 billion deficit left by the previous government. Homeowners and small business owners were paying 4.3 cents per kilowatt hour of hydro energy in 2003, even though the market rate was close to six cents. Premier McGuinty described this situation as &quot;completely unsustainable&quot; in light of the deficit, and Duncan announced that the rate would increase to 4.7 cents per kilowatt on 1 April 2004. In an effort to promote conservation, usage above 750 kilowatt hours was priced at 5.5 cents. Rates were increased a second time in March 2005, to 5 cents and 5.8 cents beyond 750 kilowatt hours. In making the change, Duncan acknowledged that his party had erred in its initial support for a freeze.

Duncan was also forced to revise his government&#x27;s plans to shut down all of Ontario&#x27;s coal-burning generators by 2007. In 2004, he acknowledged that &quot;one or two&quot; generators would be required as backup in the event of a failure elsewhere in the system. In June 2005, Duncan announced that the Nanticoke coal plant would remain open past 2007. He later announced that the Lambton station would remain open as well. A 2006 government report recommended keeping some plants open until 2014. In November 2006, the McGuinty government asked the provincial power authority to create a new timetable for plant closure. Duncan has said that Ontario will reduce its coal consumption in the coming years, even if plants remain open.

In April 2005, Duncan granted approval for four private companies to create new energy projects to replace the coal plants. The firms are expected to generate 1,675 megawatts of electricity.

In a speech to the Canadian Club on 2 May 2005, Duncan announced that it was time for an &quot;open and public debate&quot; on the future of nuclear power. He instructed the Ontario Power Authority to begin developing a long term electricity plan – referred to as an Integrated Power System Plan – so that the government could &quot;move forward judiciously when it comes to nuclear energy in Ontario.&quot;

Shortly after assuming office, he cancelled the previous government&#x27;s plans to privatize the Nuclear Inspection Services Division of Ontario Power Generation.

In July 2004, based on a recommendation of the OPG Review Committee, which Duncan appointed to review the cost over-runs and delays plaguing the restart of the four reactors at the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station, Duncan announced the government would proceed with the restart of reactor one at the Pickering station. Although smaller, the restart project still underwent cost over-runs and delays. As a result, the McGuinty government announced that it would not proceed with the restart of the two remaining Pickering A reactors and permanently mothballed them.

In 2005, Duncan concluded a deal with Bruce Power to provide the province with nuclear energy at a cost above the market rate. In 2007, the provincial Auditor-General later criticized this deal as too costly. Duncan has maintained that it was a good policy decision, and argued that much of the financial risk had been transferred to the private sector.

Duncan also promoted green energy initiatives such as the Deep lake water cooling project, wherein water from Lake Ontario is used to provide energy to buildings in Toronto. In 2005, he called for Ontario companies to bid for the right to produce an additional 1,000 megawatts of electricity from renewable sources. The province plans to have 10% of its energy come from renewable sources by 2010.

Duncan has proposed a national power grid to provide Canada with more autonomy in determining its energy policies. He outlined his support for the policy in a speech before power company executives in Toronto in February 2007, arguing that the grid would significantly reduce Canada&#x27;s rate of greenhouse gas emissions. Premier Gary Doer is also a prominent supporter of this plan.

====Government House Leader====

Shortly after the 2003 election, Duncan was required to enter into discussions on the legislative status of the New Democratic Party. The NDP won seven seats in the election, one fewer than the number required for official party status in the legislature. Recognized parties receive $2 million in government funding and have guaranteed speaking time. The NDP requested that the rules be changed, arguing that they should receive official status to reflect the 15% popular vote they received. Duncan and McGuinty initially refused to consider this possibility. Duncan offered to provide the NDP with $420,000 and some guaranteed speaking time, but NDP leader Howard Hampton rejected this as &quot;nothing short of a bribe&quot; After an extended filibustering campaign by the New Democrats, a compromise was reached wherein the NDP received $775,000 and was permitted to take part in Question Period. The NDP later regained full party status after winning an eighth seat in a by-election.

===Minister of Finance===

Ontario Finance Minister Greg Sorbara unexpectedly resigned from office on 11 October 2005, after he was named on a Royal Canadian Mounted Police warrant issued in an investigation of his former real estate development firm. Later in the same day, Duncan was appointed to replace Sorbara as Minister of Finance and Chair of the Management Board of Cabinet.

Duncan&#x27;s first budget was introduced on 23 March 2006. It focused on infrastructure spending, and particularly new spending on public transit projects in the Greater Toronto Area including extension of the Yonge-University-Spadina subway line, and roads and bridges in other parts of the province. Health spending increased by $1.9 billion, and Ontario&#x27;s universities were given $290 million more in operating revenue. The budget deficit was $2.4 billion, consistent with the previous year&#x27;s projection. There were no new taxes or tax increases. One month later, the federal government announced that it would provide Ontario with a further $1 billion for public transit spending in Toronto.

===Minister of Energy (second time)===

Greg Sorbara&#x27;s returned to cabinet as Minister of Finance on 23 May 2006, after a judge ruled that there was no cause for including his name on the RCMP search warrant. Duncan was reassigned as Energy Minister.

Duncan announced his government&#x27;s long-term strategic energy plan in June 2006, calling for an increased investment in nuclear power and the construction of two new reactors in the next ten years. The government will also promote a series of wind energy and conservation projects, including a plan to build dozens of windmills by 2025. The total cost is estimated at $46 billion over roughly twenty years. In November 2006, Duncan opened Canada&#x27;s largest wind farm near Sault Ste. Marie.

In July 2006, Duncan directed the Ontario Power Authority to provide $400 million over three years to assist local electricity distribution utilities in conservation and demand-side management projects. Toronto Hydro responded almost immediately by promising a fee reduction for consumers who cut their electricity usage by 10%. The project was successful, and Duncan announced in November 2006 that Toronto Hydro&#x27;s conservation measures would be expanded across the province.

The financial situation at Ontario Power Generation has improved significantly since 2003. Its profits for 2005 were $366 million, and its credit rating was upgraded. In July 2006, Duncan described OPG&#x27;s turnaround as &quot;[o]ne of the untold stories of the last two years&quot;. He also indicates that his government has added 3,000 megawatts of power to the provincial grid.

In October 2006, the Ontario Energy Board reduced the price of energy from 5.8 cents to 5.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, and from 6.7 cents to 6.4 above the 1,000 kilowatt-hour threshold. There was a further reduction to 5.3% and 6.2% in April 2007.

As in October 2006, the Ontario Power Authority signed contracts with seven high-efficiency co-generation projects across Ontario, with combined capacity of 414 megawatts. All of the plants are expected to come online by May 2010.

In November 2006, Duncan announced that the governments of Ontario and Quebec had agreed to join their power grids, to reduce Ontario&#x27;s dependence on American power when demand exceeds capacity. The arrangement will see Ontario receive an additional 1,250 megawatts by 2010. Duncan is also attempting to finalize a deal with Manitoba, which has an abundance of hydroelectric power.

Tom Parkinson, the chair of Ontario Hydro One, resigned in December 2006 after accusations of lavish overspending. The following month, Duncan established a four-member panel to recommend a new system of compensation for energy executives. He said that the review would help reduce bureaucratic waste. Critics have argued that the panel is too expensive, and unnecessary.

In February 2007, Duncan said that Ontario is on target for meeting its Kyoto Protocol targets and that the province has achieved a 29% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions from its coal plants since 2003. Opposition parties have argued that these reduced figures reflect a decline in the manufacturing sector, a charge that Duncan has rejected. In April, Duncan said that the province would not spend $1.6 billion to clean up the existing coal plants, arguing that the proposal was too expensive, would do nothing to benefit the environment, and was unnecessary given that the government still plans to phase out the coal plants by 2014.

Also in April 2007, Duncan announced that Ontario would ban the sale of inefficient incandescent light bulbs by 2012. The decision makes Ontario the first jurisdiction in Canada, and one of the first in the world, to take this step. In the same month, Duncan announced that a California company would construct the largest solar farm in Ontario, near Sarnia.

===Retirement from provincial politics===

Despite media speculation pegging him as the frontrunner in the 2013 Liberal leadership election, Duncan decided not to run to succeed Dalton McGuinty as Liberal leader and Premier and announced that he will leave politics entirely. He resigned from the legislature effective 14 February 2013 in order to accept a job as a Senior Strategic Advisor at McMillan LLP, a Bay Street law firm.

On 1 January 2016, Duncan was appointed to be the interim chair of the Board of the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority (Gordie Howe International Bridge). On 14 December 2016, he was appointed to a five-year term as the Board&#x27;s permanent chair.

==Federal politics==

Duncan supported Paul Martin&#x27;s bid to succeed Jean Chrétien as leader of the Liberal Party of Canada during the 1990s and early 2000s. He acted as Ontario co-chair of Michael Ignatieff&#x27;s bid to become leader of the federal party in 2006. Duncan supported Justin Trudeau&#x27;s candidacy for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada, and in December 2012 he announced he was considering running in the 42nd Canadian federal election, currently scheduled for October 2015. In the end Duncan did not run.

<text>Backcountry skiing (US), also called off-piste (Europe), alpine touring, freeriding or out-of-area, is skiing in the backcountry on unmarked or unpatrolled areas either inside or outside a ski resort&#x27;s boundaries. This contrasts with alpine skiing, which is typically done on groomed trails benefiting from a ski patrol. Unlike ski touring, backcountry skiing can – and often does – include the use of ski lifts including snowcats and helicopters. Recent improvements in equipment have increased the popularity of the sport. As the sport does confront the individual practicing it with the dangers of natural, unprepared alpine terrain like avalanches, it is generally recommended to carry standard safety equipment and to learn beforehand how to behave safely under such conditions.

==Terminology==

The terms &quot;backcountry&quot; and &quot;off-piste&quot; refer to where the skiing is being done, while terms like ski touring, ski mountaineering, telemark, freeriding, and extreme skiing describe what type of skiing is being done. Terms for backcountry skiing exist according to how the terrain is accessed, and how close it is to services. Backcountry can include the following:
* Frontcountry: off-trail within ski area boundaries where ski lifts and emergency services are close at hand.
* Slackcountry: terrain outside of the ski area boundary that is accessed from a lift without having to use skins or bootpack. Usually this also includes area with access back to the lift as well. For purists, this could also include where people use a car as a shuttle.
* Sidecountry: terrain outside marked ski area boundaries yet accessible via ski lift. Typically sidecountry requires the skier to hike, skin, or climb within ski area boundaries to reach or return from the sidecountry area, or both.
* Backcountry: skiing in remote areas not within ski area boundaries.

== Gear ==
There are two commonly referred to types of gear for backcountry skiing: equipment and education. Traveling on snow in the backcountry requires additional technical and safety equipment to efficiently and safely tour outside of monitored or patrolled areas. Gear choices for skiers and snowboarders depend on a variety of elements including type of skiing or snowboarding that a user will be engaging in, primary terrain and snow conditions, expense, skill level and personal skiing style, and safety concerns.

=== Skis or Snowboard ===

Alpine skiers, telemark skiers, and snowboarders all access the backcountry. The type of skis or snowboards that perform well in the backcountry are lightweight and optimized for long-distance uphill traveling. Snowboarders often use splitboards that separate down the middle of the board and allow a rider to hike uphill using skins. If not using a splitboard, snowboarders usually require snowshoes to hike in snow and winter conditions. While nearly any ski will technically suffice for backcountry skiing, a lightweight model is often preferred to reduce the amount of effort it takes to hike uphill. Since a significant portion of touring in the backcountry consists of uphill hiking, increasing comfort in these scenarios makes a tour more enjoyable. Narrower skis are lighter than fat skis, but many skiers prefer lightweight, fatter models that may be heavier but do not sacrifice performance in deep snow, which is a common desire for skiing off-piste. This tradeoff is common in backcountry skis, but manufacturers attempt to narrow this gap each year.

The bindings play a significant role when touring in the backcountry. Ideally, bindings are lightweight and should have a free-pivot touring mode (of particular note for telemark bindings).

=== Skins ===
Ski skins allow skis to travel uphill. A narrow strip of nylon or mohair fabric designed to mimic sealskin and allow skis to slide forward, uphill, but not backwards, downhill. Synthetic skins typically grip better while mohair skins made from Angora Goat hair slide better. Commonly, skins are attached to skis or a splitboard with a loop on the toe of the ski, a reusable adhesive on the base of the skin to stick to the base of the skis, and a clip on the tail. They are usually a few millimeters narrower than the skis to allow the ski edges to still grip the snow. Most skiers purchase skins to closely match the width of their ski and then cut them to a more precise fit, but there are some ski-specific skins that are usually designed to reduce weight as much as possible by optimizing ski and skin elements to fit together perfectly.

=== Bindings ===
Bindings for backcountry skiing are slightly different from alpine skiing in order to accommodate uphill skinning maneuvers. Telemark bindings that leave the heel free to flex off the ski developed in the 1970s contributed to the growth in popularity of skiing in the backcountry. Modern alpine touring, or &quot;A.T.&quot; bindings come in two distinct styles: tech and frame bindings. Tech bindings utilize a pin technology that lock into specialized touring ski boots. Frame bindings are compatible with any alpine ski boot. Tech bindings are lighter in weight and the boots are designed for a high degree of comfort. Frame bindings are designed for more aggressive skiing and are more often used in both the front, side, and backcountry.

=== Boots ===
Backcountry skiing boots are different from alpine skiing boots primarily in that they have a &quot;walk mode&quot; and a &quot;ski mode.&quot; The walk mode allows for ankle flexion while the ski mode locks the cuff of the boot into place for a ski descent. Tech binding compatible boots are also designed with additional features useful in hiking and mountaineering pursuits including a rockered sole and rubber lugs that aid in bootpacking and climbing.

=== Poles ===
Poles for backcountry skiing do not differ substantially from alpine skiing. There are adjustable poles that can be lengthened and shortened for flatter traverses and steeper uphills, respectively, but they are not crucial.

=== Avalanche beacon ===
A beacon is an essential item for anyone planning on skiing in the backcountry. An avalanche beacon is a battery powered radio transceiver that is used for emergency location. Skiers activate the beacon at the outset of a ski tour. If an avalanche occurs, skiers that have remained safe switch their beacons to &quot;receive&quot; signals from buried victims to begin emergency search and rescue procedures. A beacon is a useless piece of gear without the knowledge to use it properly and ability to conduct an emergency search and rescue. Skiers will practice with members of a touring group to refresh skills and build confidence in the life saving capabilities of their skiing partners. An avalanche beacon is not considered a preventive measure to mitigate avalanche risk, but rather a tool to reduce the amount of time buried should one be caught in an avalanche.

=== Probe ===
An avalanche probe is used in conjunction with a beacon and shovel to physically locate a buried victim. Avalanche probes are collapsible poles about in length that are used to probe the snow for buried avalanche victims. In an avalanche, a beacon will indicate the location of a victim to within a meter or two, and the probe will pinpoint the victim&#x27;s location. Strong skills and enough practice with both a beacon and probe allow backcountry skiers to more efficiently find victims, thereby increasing their chances at survival.

=== Shovel ===
A small, often collapsible snow shovel is used to dig out a victim in the event of an avalanche or other burial event. Avalanche shovels are also used to dig snow pits and perform stability tests to analyze the history of the snowpack, and they can also be useful for building jumps and other freestyle features in the backcountry. While avalanche shovels can vary in size and length, the one feature they all have in common is a metal blade. This is because when snow debris from an avalanche sets, it hardens into a firm pack resembling concrete and will shatter plastic blades.

=== Miscellaneous gear ===
In addition to the equipment listed above, other pieces of essential gear include the ten essentials, a helmet and goggles, gloves, extra layers for variable weather conditions that can be life-threatening in the backcountry, an ice axe for steeper mountaineering-style tours, ski crampons for steep and icy ascents that skins fail on, a Voile ski strap, duct tape (which can be used for a variety of reasons including gear failures and emergency first aid), and a pack large and comfortable enough to carry all the equipment.

=== Avalanche education ===
Education in how to safely travel in avalanche terrain and how to rescue ski partners in the event of an avalanche or other emergency is widely considered a vital piece of gear. The type and quality of equipment is of limited relevance in the backcountry without knowledge of how to effectively use it. Most regions with popular backcountry skiing areas have training organizations that run courses on how to mitigate avalanche risk in the backcountry. In the United States, the American Institute for Avalanche Research and Education runs avalanche safety courses through a network of over 100 providers in 13 states. In Canada, Avalanche Canada provides similar safety courses.

==Safety==

Backcountry and off-piste skiing can be hazardous due to avalanches, exhaustion, weather, cliffs, rock falls, and tree wells, as well as the remote and isolated location of many of the best backcountry skiing spots. Avalanches result in about one fatality per month in the United States. Many backcountry skiers carry avalanche transceivers, shovels, and probes to perform avalanche rescues. In recent years training courses on how to use these tools and how to assess the risk of avalanches have become commonplace in North America.

In Europe and Canada off-piste skiing is generally permitted at ski resorts. In the United States off-piste skiing may or may not be; regulations vary by ski area. Many ski resorts prohibit it outright and some simply post warning signs that skiers are leaving the patrolled ski area boundaries.

<doc id="1042154" wikidata="Q2575681" url="?curid=1042154" title="Nissan Fairlady Z (S30)">
<text>The Nissan S30, sold in Japan as the Nissan Fairlady Z but badged as the Datsun 240Z, 260Z, and 280Z for export, are 2-seat sports cars and 2+2 GT cars produced by Nissan from 1969 until 1978. The S30 was conceived of by Yutaka Katayama, the President of Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A., and designed by a team led by Yoshihiko Matsuo, the head of Nissan&#x27;s Sports Car Styling Studio. It is the first car in Nissan&#x27;s Z series of sports cars.

The S30 had four-wheel independent suspension and a powerful straight-six engine with an overhead camshaft, features identified with far more expensive premium European sports cars and coupés such as the Jaguar E-Type and BMW 2800 CS, but absent from similarly priced sports cars such as the Alfa Romeo Spider, MGB and Opel GT, which had smaller four-cylinder engines and rear live axles. The S30&#x27;s styling, engineering, relatively low price, and impressive performance resonated with the public, received a positive response from both buyers and the motoring press, and immediately generated long waiting lists. 

As a halo car, the S30 broadened the acceptance of Japanese carmakers beyond their image as producers of practical and reliable but prosaic and unfashionable economy cars. Datsun&#x27;s growing dealer network—compared to limited production imported sports cars manufactured by Jaguar, BMW, Porsche, Alfa Romeo, and Fiat—ensured both easy purchase and ready maintenance.

The S30 was initially sold alongside the smaller four-cylinder Datsun Sports, which was dropped from production in 1970. The S30 240Z is unrelated to the later 240SX, sold as the Silvia in Japan.


==Fairlady Z==
The Fairlady Z was introduced in late 1969 as a 1970 model, with the L20 2.0-liter straight-six SOHC engine, rear-wheel drive, and a stylish and sleek coupe body. In Japanese specs the engine, based on the Datsun 510&#x27;s four-cylinder, produced JIS and came with a four- or a five-speed manual transmission. For 1973, power of the carburetted engine dropped to to meet stricter regulations. In Japan, the Fairlady was exclusive to Nissan Japanese dealerships called &quot;Nissan Store&quot;. Japanese buyers could also get the L24-engined Fairlady 240Z model (HS30), although the larger engine placed it in a considerably higher tax category. The Japanese-spec 2.4-liter engine produces a claimed JIS at 5,600 rpm but was discontinued in 1973 as sales had dropped considerably as a result of the fuel crisis, and so until the August 1978 introduction of the Fairlady 280Z only two-liter Fairladys were available in the home market.

When export models changed over to the larger 2.6-liter 260Z in 1974, only 2-liter models remained available to Japanese buyers. A Fairlady 260Z had been planned for release, but the impact of the oil crisis stopped the model, although the 260Z was available in Okinawa (which drove on the right side of the road until 1978). The Fairlady Z received all the changes as applied to the export models, including the addition of a long-wheelbase 2+2 model. Introduced in January 1974, this received the GS30 chassis code. In 1975 the L20 engine gained fuel injection to meet new emissions standards (A-S30, A-GS30) and once again provided . At the end of July 1976 the car received the NAPS system, including an EGR system, to meet the stricter yet emissions standards in effect for this year, bringing with it a change in model codes to S31 (C-S31/C-GS31). At the same time, the more luxurious Fairlady Z-T model was introduced - this was strictly an equipment level and did not include a T-bar roof, which was first seen on the succeeding generation Fairlady.

===Fairlady ZG===
The Japan-only HS30-H Nissan Fairlady 240ZG was released in Japan in October 1971 to homologate the 240Z for Group 4 racing. Differences between the Fairlady ZG and an export-market Datsun 240Z include an extended fiberglass &quot;aero-dyna&quot; nose, wider over-fenders riveted to the body, a rear spoiler, acrylic glass headlight covers and fender-mounted rear-view mirrors. The ZG&#x27;s better aerodynamics allowed it to reach a top speed of , five more than the regular Fairlady 240Z (automatics&#x27; top speeds were 5 km/h lower).

The Fairlady ZG was available in three colors: Grand Prix Red, Grand Prix White, and Grand Prix Maroon. The &quot;G&quot; in Fairlady ZG stands for &quot;Grande.&quot; Although the ZG was not sold in the US and was never sold outside Japan, in order for it to be eligible for competition in the US, Nissan sold the nose kit as a dealer&#x27;s option which is known as the &quot;G-nose&quot;. With the nose added, these 240Zs are often referred to as 240ZGs outside of Japan.

===Fairlady Z432===
Packaging the S20 engine (originally designed by the former Prince engineers) from the Skyline GT-R created a faster Fairlady. &quot;Z432&quot; referred to 4 valves per cylinder, 3 Mikuni carburetors, and 2 camshafts. The model code is PS30. Approximately 420 were built. Some Z432s were used by the police in Japan.

===Fairlady Z432R===
A Japan-only model Fairlady Z equipped with the twin cam 2.0 L inline six-cylinder &quot;S20&quot; engine shared with the KPGC10 Skyline GT-R was released in the Japanese domestic market (JDM) for homologation purposes (to enable its use as a rally car). The Z432R were all painted orange with black aluminum wheels and a low luster black hood. The Z432R had lighter front guards, doors, and hood, as well as further engine enhancements over the Z432.

In January 2020 a 1970 Z432R sold at auction in Japan for a record , about US$.

==240Z==
The 1970 240Z was introduced to the American market by Yutaka Katayama, president of Nissan Motors USA operations, widely known as &quot;Mister K&quot;. The early cars from 1969 to mid-1971 had some subtle differences compared to late-71 to 1973 cars. The most visible difference is: these early cars had a chrome &quot;240Z&quot; badge on the sail pillar, and two horizontal vents in the rear hatch below the glass molding providing flow through ventilation. In mid-1971, there were production changes, including exterior and interior colors, was restyling of the sail pillar emblems were with just the letter &quot;Z&quot; placed in a circular vented emblem, and the vents were eliminated from the hatch panel of the car, due to complaints of exhaust being circulated into the car. Design changes for the US model 240Z occurred throughout production but were not always reflected in the JDM Fairlady if they were specific to federal requirements, including interior modifications for the 1972 model year and a change in the location of the bumper over-riders, as well as the addition of some emission control devices and the adoption of a new style of emissions reducing carburetors for the 1973 model year. 

The 1970 models were introduced in October 1969, and received the L24 2.4-liter engine with a manual choke and a four-speed manual. A less common three-speed automatic transmission was optional from 1971 onward, and had a &quot;Nissan full automatic&quot; badge. Most export markets received the car as the &quot;240Z&quot;, with slightly differing specifications depending on the various market needs.

In 2004, &quot;Sports Car International&quot; named this car number two on their list of Top Sports Cars of the 1970s.

===World Rally Championship - round victories===
In 1973, a 240Z, in the hands of Shekhar Mehta, won the 21st East African Safari Rally.


==260Z==
The 260Z was available in the United States for the 1974 model year only, but were sold in most other countries until the 1978 introduction of the 280ZX (aside from Japan, where this model was never regularly available, except for in Okinawa).

The engine was enlarged to 2.6 L by lengthening its stroke, bringing with it the new model code RS30. In the US, federal emissions regulations forced a reduction in ignition timing and compression ratio, resulting in a lower power output of SAE net for the 260Z despite the additional displacement, whereas in other countries the power output increased to . There was also a 1974 model sold through the second half of 1974 in the US that had the full 165 hp with the addition of the larger 5 mph safety bumpers, that would become the standard for the 280Z.

A four-speed or 5 speed (non-US) manual remained standard equipment, with a three-speed automatic transmission optional.

A 2+2 model built on a longer wheelbase was introduced, with larger opening quarter panel windows and a slightly notched roofline. The 2+2 looked largely identical inside (aside from the rear seat and its associated seat belt reels), but did receive a carpeted transmission tunnel rather than the quilted vinyl material used on the two-seater. The rear side windows on the 2+2 were push-out units, to add ventilation for rear seat occupants.


The 260Z claimed a few updates and improvements over the 240Z. The climate controls were more sensibly laid out and easier to work, and those cars with air conditioning now had the A/C system integrated into the main climate control panel. There was also additional stiffness in the chassis due to a redesign of the chassis rails which were larger and extended further back than previous models. A rear sway bar was added as well. The 260Z debuted a redesigned dashboard and console, as well as new seat trim, and door panels for the interior. The tail lights were updated, moving the back up lights from the main tail light housing to the back panel.

Early 1974 US 260Z models had bumpers that resembled those of the earlier 240Z, though increased slightly in size, pushed away from the body somewhat, and wearing black rubber bumper guards rather that the previous chrome bumper guards with rubber strips. These early cars still had the front turn signals located below the bumpers. Late 1974 U.S. 260Z models (often referred to as 1974.5 models) carried the heavier bumpers that would remain on the 1975-76 model years of the 280Z so as to be in compliance with United States bumper legislation in 1973. These late cars had the front turn signals relocated to the outer edges of the front grill, above the bumper.

==280Z==


Nissan released the Datsun 280Z model for the North American market in the 1975 model year. In a further effort to keep the S30 models sporting in the face of increasingly stringent U.S. emission and safety requirements, engine size was again increased, this time to 2.8 liters. The L26 engine was bored out to create the L28, and a Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection system was added. Canadian versions were uniquely equipped without the anti-smog components mandatory in the States. The model code is HS30, the same as for the original 240Z.

The 1975 and 1976 models continued to be fitted with the U.S. federally-required impact absorbing bumpers that had been introduced for the mid-1974 model year of the 260Z. These bumpers were smooth surfaced, and blended into smooth black rubber extensions as they met the body of the car. The 1977 and 1978 models received bumpers with recessed channels added that blended into corrugated- or accordion-style black rubber extension trim. Also new for the 1977 model year, 280Zs no longer received the full-size spare tire, and instead had a &quot;space saver&quot; spare and a larger fuel tank. This resulted in a raised rear deck area made of fiberboard, reducing cargo space. In late 1976 and for most 1977–78 models, an optional five-speed manual transmission was available alongside the four-speed manual and the three-speed automatic options. It included a &quot;5-speed&quot; emblem on the left bottom edge of the rear hatch. For 1977 there was also an update from the charcoal painted hubcap style (with a chrome &quot;Z&quot; floating in the amber center emblems) to a hubcap that resembled an alloy wheel, bearing a center cap with a chrome &quot;Z&quot; floating in a black circle.

In 1977 and 1978 respectively, Datsun offered two special edition models. The &quot;Zap&quot; edition was offered in 1977 as a &quot;special decor package&quot;. Zap cars were finished in &quot;sunshine yellow&quot; paint, and sported black stripes down the center and sides, with yellow, red, and orange chevrons at the front ends of the stripes. An estimated 1,000 &quot;Zap Z&quot; cars were offered in 1977. The &quot;Zap Z&quot; model was also used as the pace car in the 1977 Long Beach Grand Prix. The Black Pearl edition (produced in 1978) came with black pearlescent paint and a &quot;special appearance package&quot; (SAP), which consisted of dual racing mirrors, rear window louvers, and unique red and silver striping. It has been estimated that each United States dealer was allocated one Black Pearl edition to sell, though due to high demand some dealers reportedly received additional allocation. It is estimated 750 to 1,500 of these cars were ultimately produced, however the exact number remains unknown.

Both the two-seater and 2+2 280Z coupes remained available throughout the 1975–1978 model year run. The S30 series was replaced for 1979 by the Nissan S130.

==Racing==
The Z was very successful in SCCA racing in the 1970s: Bob Sharp Racing out of Wilton, Connecticut with Sharp, Elliot Forbes-Robinson and later Paul Newman driving; and Brock Racing Enterprises (BRE) in the western US with John Morton driving a #46 240Z to the SCCA C Production national title in 1970 and 1971. Other drivers, such as Clearwater, Florida (and later Maryland) racer Don Kearney had much success with the Z-car between 1970 and 1978. The Z and Datsun 510 are credited as catalyst for the US Japanese import performance parts industry. Nissan also supported and was associated with Bob Bondurant&#x27;s race driving school from its inception.

In 2013 Nissan claimed its 97th SCCA national championship victory with Greg Ira at the wheel of his orange #2 RevTech 240Z. On his way to his championship Ira set several road course records in SCCA&#x27;s E Production class, beginning in 2006, including:

*Daytona International Speedway, Florida
*Heartland Park, Kansas
*Homestead-Miami Speedway, Florida
*Palm Beach International Raceway, Florida
*Road America, Wisconsin
*Sebring International Raceway, Florida
*Virginia International Raceway, Virginia

Ira was awarded SCCA&#x27;s prestigious Kimberly Cup in 2008. Previous Kimberly Cup recipients include Bob Holbert, Roger Penske, Mark Donohue, and Peter Revson.

On September 27, 2015, Greg Ira won his second (and Nissan&#x27;s 98th) SCCA National Championship, in his EP2 Revtech/Ztrix.com 240Z, at Daytona International Speedway.

==Relaunch attempts==
From 1997 to 2002 Nissan did not offer the Z-car line outside of Japan, where the Fairlady Z (Z32) remained available until 2000. In 1998, Nissan launched a program to bring back the Z-car line by first purchasing original 240Zs, then restoring them to factory specifications, and finally selling them to dealerships for $24,000. This was an effort to keep Z-car interest alive. Nissan over-estimated the market for the cars and low demand (and the high price) meant that less than fifty cars were re-manufactured and sold. Furthermore, in 1999, a concept car was shown to the public in a plan to return to the fundamentals that made the 240Z a market success. As of 2022, the Z-car is simply sold as the Z. Its design stems from multiple Z&#x27;s that came before it.

<text>Winona Grace MacInnis (née Woodsworth; July 25, 1905 – July 10, 1991) was a socialist Canadian politician. She was the first woman from British Columbia elected to the House of Commons of Canada, as well as the first wife of a former Canadian Member of Parliament to be elected to the House of Commons in her own right, rather than by directly succeeding her husband in a by-election following his death.

The daughter of Co-operative Commonwealth Federation founding leader J. S. Woodsworth and the wife of long serving CCF MP Angus MacInnis, Grace MacInnis championed issues such as family planning, affordable housing, abortion rights and women&#x27;s equality. She was a founding member of the CCF and served as an MLA in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 1941 to 1945, on the executive of the national CCF, and in the Canadian House of Commons as a Member of Parliament representing the CCF&#x27;s successor, the New Democratic Party from 1965 until her retirement in 1974.

MacInnis represented the British Columbia riding of Vancouver Kingsway. She was the only woman MP elected in the 1968 election.

In 1974, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada &quot;in recognition of a lifetime of service to Canada as teacher, author and parliamentarian&quot;. In 1979, she was a recipient of the Governor General&#x27;s Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case. In 1990, she was awarded the Order of British Columbia.

==Personal life==
MacInnis was born on July 25, 1905, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. She was the eldest among six children of J. S. Woodsworth, the first leader of Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF, later the New Democratic Party), and Lucy Lillian Staples Woodsworth. Their lives and enthusiasm about politics highly influenced MacInnis&#x27; ideals as a politician, and a feminist. Her father was a minister of a comfortable Methodist parish. Her mother, Lucy, was a teacher and a loving mother to her children, also was known as a liberated thinker who taught her children about birth control, which was illegal at that time. The family had discussion frequently, which encouraged the children to express their thoughts freely. In the year of 1953, she published biography of her father: &quot;J.S. Woodsworth- A Man to Remember&quot;.

After attending the University of Manitoba and the Sorbonne, she became a teacher, but soon left her career to serve as an assistant to her father in 1931, and later acted as secretary of the CCF party. She married Angus MacInnis in January 1932 who spent 27 years as a CCF member of Vancouver-Kingsway in the House of Commons until his retirement in 1957 due to his failing health, which also confined MacInnis&#x27; activities as well. In 1941, she was elected to the British Columbia legislature as one of two members for the riding of Vancouver-Burrard and remained until her defeat in 1945. She was also defeated in the 1956 provincial election in the Vancouver Point-Grey riding. In the year of 1960, she suffered from rheumatoid arthritis which confined her activities completely. It took about 4 years for her to be quiescent. In 1964, her husband Angus MacInnis died. She rested and resumed her activities in NDP, and was elected as a Party Member of Vancouver-Kingsway in 1965. She held senior positions in both CCF Party and its successor, the NDP, and was president of the British Columbia Party for two terms, both on constituency and provincial levels. She received unanimous support from her party, and continued her activities for 35 years. MacInnis died on July 10, 1991.

==Career==
During her career, MacInnis debated issues in the House of Commons concerning housing and abortion. In 1967, she was responsible for bringing the issue of housing to the government&#x27;s attention, arguing that it was the main problem in Canada. This exchange led to the increase in interest rates of NHA loans from 7 1/4 % to 8 1/4%, which was advantageous, however, qualifying for the loans still remained difficult. She explained that Canadians couldn&#x27;t qualify unless their income was at least $8,000 a year(the equivalent of $62,101.69 in 2020 dollars) and for those who could afford it, it was costly to carry a loan for an extended period. At the same meeting, MacInnis addressed abortion and how it is necessary for the option to be available for women if the child has a possibility of being born unhealthy, their physical or mental health was imperilled or the pregnancy was caused by rape. Her precautionary measures for abortion rights were that two registered physicians had to prescribe it for any of the previous reasons and she emphasized that anyone could apply. One of her reasons why these rights would be helpful was because they would reduce the amount of wrongly performed illegal abortions.

One problem that MacInnis recognized during her time in Parliament was that men don&#x27;t usually engage in issues involving women. MacInnis advocated for those on lower incomes, in hopes of creating more opportunities for those who aren&#x27;t able to create their own. She highlighted the importance of the ability for women to not have to choose between work and having children, and considered the need for more childcare centres so this could be made possible. In addition, she pressed for advancements towards training and education in order for all classes of women to qualify for better jobs.

==Legacy==
MacInnis&#x27; papers (1.6 m) are held by the special collections division of the library of the University of British Columbia. They include the diaries, correspondence and speeches of her husband. The university also holds Angus Maclnnis Memorial Collection, the Angus Maclnnis Papers, and the Lillie d&#x27;Easum Collection, which include material by or about MacInnis. There is also a Grace MacInnis fonds (4.6 m) at Library and Archives Canada. Archival reference number is R5492.

<doc id="1042162" wikidata="Q2305906" url="?curid=1042162" title="Strahd von Zarovich">
<text>[[Count]] Strahd von Zarovich is a fictional character originally appearing as the feature villain in the highly popular &quot;Advanced Dungeons and Dragons&quot; adventure module I6: &quot;Ravenloft&quot;. Later, this character and his world would be explored in follow-up modules, novels, and the &quot;Ravenloft&quot; campaign setting. Within this setting, Strahd is the first and best-known of Ravenloft&#x27;s darklords. He is a powerful ancient vampire. He is also a master necromancer, a skilled warrior, and the unquestioned ruler of the domain of Barovia.

== Creative origins ==
In 1978, Tracy and Laura Hickman wrote adventures that would eventually be published as the &quot;Dungeon &amp; Dragons&quot; modules &quot;Pharaoh&quot; and &quot;Ravenloft&quot;. Strahd was created by the Hickmans &quot;after Tracy returned home from a disappointing session of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. Back in First Edition, the game was less of a storytelling game. It mostly involved charting randomized dungeons on graph paper and fighting whatever creatures were inside for their gold and experience points. In one of those random rooms was a vampire, which immediately stood out to Tracy. It didn&#x27;t make sense to him why a creature like a vampire was just sitting around in a random dungeon with oozes, goblins, and zombies. So he and his wife set out to create a vampire villain with fleshed-out motivations and history&quot;. When the Hickmans began work on &quot;Ravenloft&quot;, they felt the vampire archetype had become overused, trite, and mundane, and decided to create a frightening version of the creature for the module. They play-tested it with a group of players every Halloween for five years on their own game system with the adventure titled &quot;Vampyr&quot;. However, the Hickmans kept being asked about their &quot;Ravenloft game&quot;, and so the &quot;Ravenloft&quot; name stuck. The duo eventually caught the attention of D&amp;D&#x27;s original publishers. They were hired to adapt it into the First Edition of &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and was released as Module I6: &quot;Ravenloft&quot; in 1983 by TSR.

When creating Strahd, the Hickmans&#x27; vampire research started with an image of Bela Lugosi from 1931 before they explored older stories such as Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; (1897), John William Polidori&#x27;s &quot;The Vampyre&quot; (1819), and Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1818). &quot;What the Hickmans found was that the romantic vampire of the earliest years of the genre was not just a spouse beater but a spouse killer, the archetype of abuse in the worst kind of destructive codependency&quot;. In 2016, Tracy Hickman said, &quot;Strahd came directly from the roots of vampire lore. The origins of the modern vampire spring from feminine cautionary tales warning women away from the &#x27;bluebeard&#x27; archetype. It was essential to understand this in order to properly construct him&quot;.

== Publication history ==

=== 1st edition ===
The adventure module I6: &quot;Ravenloft&quot; (1983) introduced Strahd von Zarovich, and centers upon the efforts of the player characters to help a young Barovian woman, Ireena Kolyana, escape the dreadful fate of so many others on whom &quot;the devil Strahd&quot; has cast his eye over the generations. The setting includes not only castle Ravenloft itself, but also the nearby village of Barovia, and a camp of gypsies led by Madame Eva, who had formed a kind of alliance with the vampire. Through the course of the adventure, players have the opportunity to learn Strahd&#x27;s backstory and discover that Ireena is herself the reincarnation of Tatyana. Strahd himself is noted as being the first truly well-developed villain to appear in the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; game system, being fully capable of changing the course of events to suit his own evil ends.

The immediate popularity of &quot;Ravenloft&quot; proved sufficient to warrant a sequel, I10: &quot;Ravenloft II: The House on Gryphon Hill&quot; (1986), again casting Strahd von Zarovich in the central, villainous role. Set in the quiet, seaside town of Mordentshire, players of this adventure are confronted by &quot;two&quot; Strahds—the same monstrous vampire from &quot;Ravenloft&quot; (now referred to as the Creature), and a very human counterpart, known as the Alchemist. Shannon Appelcline, author of &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons&quot;, highlighted the confusing continuity of Strahd&#x27;s return in this module and that the second module suggests &quot;the original &#x27;Ravenloft&#x27; could be a dream. Or maybe this one is. Or maybe they&#x27;re alternate realities. Combining them into one chronology doesn&#x27;t seem possible&quot;. Additionally, &quot;the original &#x27;Ravenloft&#x27; has been the favored background for Strahd in more recent appearances&quot;.

The plot of &quot;Ravenloft II&quot; requires the players to discover the true nature of the vampiric threat afflicting Mordentshire, and then to discover the secret identity of the Creature and destroy him. Nothing of note is added to original nature or history of Strahd von Zarovich in the course of the adventure, though a number of characters of lesser importance, including the lich Azalin make their first appearance in this publication as well.

=== 2nd edition ===

Though &quot;Ravenloft II&quot; did not enjoy the wide acclaim of the original, the phenomenon of &quot;Ravenloft&quot; proved sufficient for TSR, Inc. to place it and Strahd von Zarovich at the heart of a new product series released in 1990, &quot;&quot; — an entire campaign setting based on the Gothic horror theme of &quot;Ravenloft&quot;. After being featured in the &quot;Ravenloft&quot; setting, Strahd became one of the most popular villains appearing in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Game designer Rick Swan commented on Strahd: &quot;A high-level necromancer of incomparable cunning, Strahd holds his own with Count Dracula as one of horror&#x27;s most memorable bloodsuckers.&quot; The designers of &quot;Ravenloft: Realm of Terror&quot; decided to focus on campaign atmosphere which resulted in the Ravenloft setting becoming the &quot;demiplane of dread&quot;. This demiplane now &quot;included &quot;many&quot; horrific lands, including the lands of Barovia and Mordent from the two &#x27;Ravenloft&#x27; modules. Strahd&#x27;s backstory from the original &#x27;Ravenloft&#x27; was even incorporated into the story of how Ravenloft, the demiplane of dread, came to be&quot;.

In 1991, Strahd was a main character in two novels: &quot;Vampire of the Mists&quot; and &quot;Knight of the Black Rose&quot;. His official &quot;autobiography&quot; has been presented in two novels by P. N. Elrod: &quot;I, Strahd: Memoirs of a Vampire&quot; (1993) and &quot;I, Strahd, the War Against Azalin&quot; (1998). There are many similarities between the character of Strahd von Zarovich and that of fellow fictional vampire Barnabas Collins from the American 1960&#x27;s-1970&#x27;s soap opera Dark Shadows, as P.N. Elrod mentions on her personal Livejournal blog.

Strahd appeared in multiple adventure modules set in the new campaign setting and received &quot;special attention in the final adventures of the Grand Conjunction sequence — RQ3: &quot;From the Shadows&quot; (1992) and RM1: &quot;Roots of Evil&quot; (1993)&quot;. &quot;Roots of Evil&quot; added additional details to Strahd&#x27;s background; such as, the introduction of the arcanaloth Inajira with whom Strahd &quot;made a pact in far-gone times&quot;. The tenth Ravenloft adventure, &quot;RM4: House of Strahd&quot; (1993), was a revamp of the original &quot;Ravenloft&quot; module with the following changes: it was updated to the AD&amp;D 2e ruleset, Barovia lore was brought in line with the lore of the campaign setting, and Strahd was given a power boost &quot;to reflect his status as a Dark Lord&quot;.

In 1994, Strahd returned in the second edition &quot;Ravenloft Campaign Setting&quot; boxed set which was a revision of the &quot;Ravenloft: Realm of Terror&quot; (1990) boxed set. Strahd was a main character in the DreamForge Intertainment video game &quot;&quot; (1994). Strahd also appears in the PlayStation game &quot;Iron &amp; Blood: Warriors of Ravenloft&quot; (1996) and can be unlocked as a playable character via a secret code.

=== 3rd and 3.5 edition ===
In 2001, White Wolf published the 3rd edition &quot;Ravenloft Campaign Setting&quot; which included a detailed timeline of Strahd&#x27;s history. &quot;Dragon&quot; #315 (January 2004) featured a 3rd edition stat block for Strahd. &quot;Expedition to Castle Ravenloft&quot; (2006) was released after the Ravenloft publishing license reverted to Wizards of the Coast. This 3.5 edition update of the original &quot;Ravenloft&quot; module featured Strahd &quot;front and center in the first chapter&quot;.

=== 4th edition ===
In 2010, Strahd made his board game debut in &quot;Castle Ravenloft Board Game&quot;. While a 4th edition update to the Ravenloft setting was announced at Gen Con 2010, the product was never released. Strahd&#x27;s appearances were limited to official magazine articles, such as, &quot;Dungeon&quot; #207 &quot;Fair Barovia&quot; (October 2012) and &quot;Dragon&quot; #416 &quot;History Check: Strahd and Van Richten&quot; (October 2012).

=== 5th edition ===

Strahd returned as the featured villain in the 2016 adventure module &quot;Curse of Strahd&quot; for &quot;D&amp;D&quot; fifth edition. On Strahd&#x27;s role as the module&#x27;s villain, Chris Perkins said, &quot;in Gothic horror fiction, the villain&#x27;s torment is often self-inflicted; the villain becomes, ironically, a victim of their own monstrous nature and horrible acts. [...] He is a malignant narcissist trapped by his malignant narcissism – forever alone, forever feared and unable to change. He must be destroyed because salvation is beyond him. [...] In horror fiction, the villain is framed as inhumanity personified, often serving as a cautionary tale: once you lose your humanity, you can never get it back. Other fantasy villains aren&#x27;t usually burdened with that kind of terrifying reality&quot;.

On the module&#x27;s development process, Perkins said, &quot;the Hickmans envisioned Strahd differently than he&#x27;s depicted in the original &quot;Ravenloft&quot; adventure. Their image didn&#x27;t match the Bela Legosi vampire quite so much. Tracy found an old daguerreotype [an early type of photograph captured on a silvered copper plate] that captured the look of Strahd in his mind, and we used that image as a reference to create a new look for the vampire&quot;. One of Tracy Hickman&#x27;s objectives when working on &quot;Curse of Strahd&quot; &quot;was to bring vampire folklore back to its roots&quot;. Tracy Hickman said, &quot;Vampires have strayed from their original role in cautionary tales, which warned women about monsters and thereby empowered them. Strahd is a classic abusive monster who is, at his root, selfish. The tale is timeless and has nothing to do with some of the recent and harmful versions of glittering romance that vampires have appeared in&quot;.

Strahd is included in the Barovia section of &quot;Van Richten&#x27;s Guide to Ravenloft&quot; (2021), a campaign setting book which is focused on the various Domains of Dread. However, his stat block from &quot;Curse of Strahd&quot; (2016) is not reprinted in this book.

==Fictional character biography==
A man of noble birth, Strahd spent much of his life serving causes of goodness and law, most notably as a warrior and leader of armies. Years of such service took their toll upon him however, and by the time he reached middle age, Strahd came to believe he had squandered his life and his youth. With this dark mood upon him, he came to conquer the region known as Barovia, and assumed lordship there, taking as his residence the pre-existing castle known as Ravenloft. From this position of power and security, he called for members of his family &quot;long unseated from their ancestral thrones&quot; to join him, including a younger brother named Sergei.

Some time after this reunion, the Count himself fell in love with a young Barovian woman, Tatyana, though she rejected his affections in favor of the younger Sergei. Filled with despair and jealousy, and brooding a growing hatred for Sergei, Strahd sought magical means to restore his youth. In a moment of desperate frustration, he &quot;made a pact with death - a pact of blood.&quot; On the day of Sergei and Tatyana&#x27;s wedding, Strahd murdered his brother and confessed his love to Tatyana, but overcome with grief, she fled from him, hurling herself to her death from the balcony of Castle Ravenloft. Strahd himself was shot down by the arrows of the castle guard. Even so, he did not die, but went on to rule the land of Barovia as a vampire. Immediately afterward, the Mists of Ravenloft drew Strahd to the Demiplane of Dread.

Strahd&#x27;s backstory was further refined for such that he unwittingly became a vampire as a result of a pact between himself and an unknown entity (Strahd claims it to be Death).

Strahd has ruled his domain for the longest of any darklord, and as such his knowledge of the workings of Ravenloft are without equal. When Strahd chooses to close the borders of his lands, poisonous mists arise and suffocate anyone attempting to pass through them. There are only two ways to avoid the poisonous fog: immunity to poison (magic does not help, but creatures that are innately immune to poison, like elementals, constructs, and undead, have nothing to fear), or by ceasing the attempt to escape. In addition, the Vistani know a secret antidote which renders the drinker immune to the closed border. This fog permanently rings the village of Barovia as well.

Strahd&#x27;s curse is that although he is absolute lord and master of Barovia, to the point where he can enter private homes unbidden because he owns them, once every generation he will meet a woman whom he believes is Tatyana reincarnated. He always tries to woo her, but the scene of his damnation is replayed, and the woman inevitably dies. Strahd is perhaps the most difficult of all darklords to face. His mastery of necromancy is so great he has produced a kind of &quot;super-zombie&quot;, one that is capable of seeing invisible, regenerating like a troll and whose appendages continue to fight on when severed. Strahd has had to battle at least two darklords who had entered his domain in the past; Azalin Rex the lich, and Lord Soth the death knight.

When Lord Soth was in Barovia, Strahd realized that Soth&#x27;s power as truly a match for his the moment Soth arrived in Castle Ravenloft. Armies of Strahd&#x27;s servants fell before Lord Soth, and the havoc and damage caused by Soth caused even Strahd to waver. To be rid of Lord Soth from Barovia, Strahd had to give that which Soth had searched for, the traitorous retainer Caradoc, for fear of Lord Soth causing more damage to his beloved land. When the Ravenloft campaign setting was developed, the events of &quot;Ravenloft II&quot; were retconned so that Strahd was present and disguised as a human alchemist, and did not die at the module&#x27;s conclusion.

==Reception==
Strahd was named as one of the greatest villains in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; history in the final issue of &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine. Strahd appeared on the 2018 &quot;Screen Rant&quot; top list at #15 on &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The 15 Most Powerful Villains, Ranked&quot;, and Scott Baird highlighted that &quot;The fact that he is a vampire means that there are numerous methods by which Strahd can be defeated, which is to say nothing of the powerful anti-zombie abilities that are available to certain Dungeons &amp; Dragons classes.&quot; Strahd was also #8 on &quot;Game Rant&quot;&#x27;s 2020 &quot;10 Must-Have NPCs In Dungeons &amp; Dragons Lore To Make Your Campaigns Awesome&quot; list — the article states that &quot;DMs planning on introducing &quot;Curse of Strahd&quot; or modifying it into their campaign may reveal Count Strahd as a villainous NPC. He may even be incorporated as a Warlock Patron, with the Warlock&#x27;s story arc eclipsing in their arrival in Barovia. An alluring and attractive villain, Count Strahd can easily become a favorite villain with his cunning, unpredictable, and chilling nature.&quot;

Henry Glasheen, for &quot;SLUG Magazine&quot;, highlighted that &quot;up until the release of &quot;Ravenloft&quot;, almost every adventure module was just a shoestring of dungeon traps and monster encounters meant to test the valor and endurance of the player characters. [...] The Hickmans were sick of the seemingly random nature of these campaigns, and longed for a rich, complex villain—the kind that you could find in a book but rarely, if ever, in a campaign. So, they invented Count Strahd von Zarovich. To this day, he&#x27;s one of the best-written and most interesting villains of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. He toys with the players, tempting them with the possibility of immortality and dark power. Yet, he also suffers the sting of his own twisted ambitions, a fatal hubris that drives him and sustains him. He&#x27;s a complex and entirely likeable villain, and that&#x27;s what makes him so dangerous&quot;.

Ari David, for &quot;CBR&quot;, wrote: &quot;Out of all of the great evils in the many worlds comprising the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; multiverse, Count Strahd von Zarovich eternally remains one of the most feared. [...] Strahd is more than a shallow Dracula knock-off. Beneath his sinister cat-and-mouse games lies the broken heart of a once-great warrior. His fall into villainy was fueled by pride, jealousy, and love. Despite this, he is a prisoner bound to his domain, doomed to repeat a cycle of violence. His popularity with &quot;D&amp;D&quot; fans remains strong in large part due to his humanizing backstory. He&#x27;s a somewhat unique figure amongst a rogue&#x27;s gallery of evil dragon gods, devil princes, and zombie wizards&quot;.

On Strahd&#x27;s portrayal in &quot;Vampire of the Mists&quot; (1991), Rob Bricken, for &quot;Io9&quot;, wrote: &quot;&quot;Mists&quot; is primarily about Jander and Strahd and their uneasy camaraderie, since Jander doesn&#x27;t really have anywhere else in Barovia to go, yet Strahd is also immensely evil on occasion. [...] There&#x27;s something genuinely compelling about Strahd, possibly because he is, again, a Dracula. He&#x27;s got the driverless carriage and castle doors that open on his own. His castle is completely decrepit other than his library and study, because he&#x27;s classy like that. [...] He delights in Jander&#x27;s company, but he also delights in performing horrific acts of cruelty in front of Jander, because Strahd knows the gold elf hates it. He&#x27;s quick to anger, but quick to calm down again. [...] He&#x27;s technically a complex character, it&#x27;s just that the complexities themselves aren&#x27;t complex&quot;.

On Strahd&#x27;s portrayal in &quot;Curse of Strahd&quot; (2016), Rory Bristol, for GeekDad, wrote: &quot;Strahd is a centuries-old vampire with many of the classic traits of the horror genre. With powerful regenerative abilities, the ability to shape-change into bat or cloud of mist, and a trio of legendary abilities, Strahd is the nightmare you&#x27;ve been looking for. His obsession for power, victory, and domination have made him a cruel master with a Lawful Evil disposition. But his passion for his one true love has kept his heart seeking her reincarnation at every turn. He is not afraid of the party, as it was his will that they journey to his realm, for his own sinister purposes&quot;.

On Strahd&#x27;s portrayal in &quot;Dungeons and Dragons: Shadows of the Vampire&quot; (November 2016), Gavin Sheehan, for &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot;, wrote: &quot;&quot;Shadows Of The Vampire&quot; is probably our favorite of the bunch as it introduces you to one of the longest-running villains in the game, Strahd von Zarovich from the Ravenloft adventures. If you haven&#x27;t caught on to the title yet, Strahd is the vampire of all vampires in this world, and with him comes the usual array of horror, darkness, bloodshed, and standing guard in the middle of the night so you don&#x27;t join his army of darkness. If you&#x27;re into horror or just the ever-present danger that comes with certain kinds of storytelling, this is the one for you&quot;.

<doc id="1042164" wikidata="Q728368" url="?curid=1042164" title="Glossary of mathematical jargon">
<text>The language of mathematics has a wide vocabulary of specialist and technical terms. It also has a certain amount of jargon: commonly used phrases which are part of the culture of mathematics, rather than of the subject. Jargon often appears in lectures, and sometimes in print, as informal shorthand for rigorous arguments or precise ideas. Much of this uses common English words, but with a specific non-obvious meaning when used in a mathematical sense.

Some phrases, like &quot;in general&quot;, appear below in more than one section.

==Philosophy of mathematics==
; abstract nonsense:A tongue-in-cheek reference to category theory, using which one can employ arguments that establish a (possibly concrete) result without reference to any specifics of the present problem. For that reason, it is also known as &quot;general abstract nonsense&quot; or &quot;generalized abstract nonsense&quot;.
; canonical:A reference to a standard or choice-free presentation of some mathematical object (e.g., canonical map, canonical form, or canonical ordering). The same term can also be used more informally to refer to something &quot;standard&quot; or &quot;classic&quot;. For example, one might say that Euclid&#x27;s proof is the &quot;canonical proof&quot; of the infinitude of primes.

; deep:A result is called &quot;deep&quot; if its proof requires concepts and methods that are advanced beyond the concepts needed to formulate the result. For example, the prime number theorem — originally proved using techniques of complex analysis — was once thought to be a deep result until elementary proofs were found. On the other hand, the fact that π is irrational is usually known to be a deep result, because it requires a considerable development of real analysis before the proof can be established — even though the claim itself can be stated in terms of simple number theory and geometry.
; elegant:An aesthetic term referring to the ability of an idea to provide insight into mathematics, whether by unifying disparate fields, introducing a new perspective on a single field, or by providing a technique of proof which is either particularly simple, or which captures the intuition or imagination as to why the result it proves is true. In some occasions, the term &quot;beautiful&quot; can also be used to the same effect, though Gian-Carlo Rota distinguished between &quot;elegance of presentation&quot; and &quot;beauty of concept&quot;, saying that for example, some topics could be written about elegantly although the mathematical content is not beautiful, and some theorems or proofs are beautiful but may be written about inelegantly.

; elementary:A proof or a result is called &quot;elementary&quot; if it only involves basic concepts and methods in the field, and is to be contrasted with deep results which require more development within or outside the field. The concept of &quot;elementary proof&quot; is used specifically in number theory, where it usually refers to a proof that does not resort to methods from complex analysis.
; folklore :A result is called &quot;folklore&quot; if it is non-obvious and non-published, yet generally known to the specialists within a field. In many scenarios, it is unclear as to who first obtained the result, though if the result is significant, it may eventually find its way into the textbooks, whereupon it ceases to be folklore.

; natural:Similar to &quot;canonical&quot; but more specific, and which makes reference to a description (almost exclusively in the context of transformations) which holds independently of any choices. Though long used informally, this term has found a formal definition in category theory.
; pathological:An object behaves pathologically (or, somewhat more broadly used, in a &quot;degenerated&quot; way) if it either fails to conform to the generic behavior of such objects, fails to satisfy certain context-dependent regularity properties, or simply disobeys mathematical intuition. In many occasions, these can be and often are contradictory requirements, while in other occasions, the term is more deliberately used to refer to an object artificially constructed as a counterexample to these properties. A simple example is that from the definition of a triangle having angles which sum to π radians, a single straight line conforms to this definition pathologically.
:Note for that latter quote that as the differentiable functions are meagre in the space of continuous functions, as Banach found out in 1931, differentiable functions are colloquially speaking a rare exception among the continuous ones. Thus it can hardly be defended any-more to call non-differentiable continuous functions pathological.
; rigor (rigour):The act of establishing a mathematical result using indisputable logic, rather than informal descriptive argument. Rigor is a cornerstone quality of mathematics, and can play an important role in preventing mathematics from degenerating into fallacies.
; well-behaved:An object is well-behaved (in contrast with being &quot;Pathological&quot;) if it satisfies certain prevailing regularity properties, or if it conforms to mathematical intuition (even though intuition can often suggest opposite behaviors as well). In some occasions (e.g., analysis), the term &quot;smooth&quot;&quot;&quot; can also be used to the same effect.

==Descriptive informalities==
Although ultimately every mathematical argument must meet a high standard of precision, mathematicians use descriptive but informal statements to discuss recurring themes or concepts with unwieldy formal statements. Note that many of the terms are completely rigorous in context.
; almost all: A shorthand term for &quot;all except for a set of measure zero&quot;, when there is a measure to speak of. For example, &quot;almost all real numbers are transcendental&quot; because the algebraic real numbers form a countable subset of the real numbers with measure zero. One can also speak of &quot;almost all&quot; integers having a property to mean &quot;all except finitely many&quot;, despite the integers not admitting a measure for which this agrees with the previous usage. For example, &quot;almost all prime numbers are odd&quot;. There is a more complicated meaning for integers as well, discussed in the main article. Finally, this term is sometimes used synonymously with &quot;generic&quot;, below.
; arbitrarily large: Notions which arise mostly in the context of limits, referring to the recurrence of a phenomenon as the limit is approached. A statement such as that predicate &quot;P&quot; is satisfied by arbitrarily large values, can be expressed in more formal notation by . See also &quot;frequently&quot;. The statement that quantity &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) depending on &quot;x&quot; &quot;can be made&quot; arbitrarily large, corresponds to .
; arbitrary: A shorthand for the universal quantifier. An arbitrary choice is one which is made unrestrictedly, or alternatively, a statement holds of an arbitrary element of a set if it holds of any element of that set. Also much in general-language use among mathematicians: &quot;Of course, this problem can be arbitrarily complicated&quot;.
; eventually:In the context of limits, this is shorthand meaning &quot;for sufficiently large arguments&quot;; the relevant argument(s) are implicit in the context. As an example, the function log(log(&quot;x&quot;)) &quot;eventually&quot; becomes larger than 100&quot;; in this context, &quot;eventually&quot; means &quot;for sufficiently large &quot;x&quot;.&quot;
; factor through: A term in category theory referring to composition of morphisms. If for three objects &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; a map formula_1 can be written as a composition formula_2 with formula_3 and formula_4, then &quot;f&quot; is said to &quot;factor through&quot; any (and all) of formula_5, formula_6, and formula_7.
; finite: When said of the value of a variable assuming values from the non-negative extended reals formula_8 the meaning is usually &quot;not infinite&quot;. For example, if the variance of a random variable is said to be finite, this implies it is a non-negative real number, possibly zero. In some contexts though, for example in &quot;a small but finite amplitude&quot;, zero and infinitesimals are meant to be excluded. When said of the value of a variable assuming values from the extended natural numbers formula_9 the meaning is simply &quot;not infinite&quot;. When said of a set or a mathematical whose main component is a set, it means that the cardinality of the set is less than formula_10.
; frequently: In the context of limits, this is shorthand for &quot;arbitrarily large arguments&quot; and its relatives; as with &quot;eventually&quot;, the intended variant is implicit. As an example, the sequence formula_11 is frequently in the interval (1/2, 3/2), because there are arbitrarily large &quot;n&quot; for which the value of the sequence is in the interval. 
; formal, formally: Qualifies anything that is sufficiently precise to be translated straightforwardly in a formal system. For example. a formal proof, a formal definition.
; generic: This term has similar connotations as &quot;almost all&quot; but is used particularly for concepts outside the purview of measure theory. A property holds &quot;generically&quot; on a set if the set satisfies some (context-dependent) notion of density, or perhaps if its complement satisfies some (context-dependent) notion of smallness. For example, a property which holds on a dense Gδ (intersection of countably many open sets) is said to hold generically. In algebraic geometry, one says that a property of points on an algebraic variety that holds on a dense Zariski open set is true generically; however, it is usually not said that a property which holds merely on a dense set (which is not Zariski open) is generic in this situation.
; in general: In a descriptive context, this phrase introduces a simple characterization of a broad class of , with an eye towards identifying a unifying principle. This term introduces an &quot;elegant&quot; description which holds for &quot;arbitrary&quot; objects. Exceptions to this description may be mentioned explicitly, as &quot;pathological&quot; cases.

; left-hand side, right-hand side (LHS, RHS): Most often, these refer simply to the left-hand or the right-hand side of an equation; for example, formula_12 has formula_13 on the LHS and formula_14 on the RHS. Occasionally, these are used in the sense of lvalue and rvalue: an RHS is primitive, and an LHS is derivative.
; nice: A mathematical is colloquially called &quot;nice&quot; or &quot;sufficiently nice&quot; if it satisfies hypotheses or properties, sometimes unspecified or even unknown, that are especially desirable in a given context. It is an informal antonym for pathological. For example, one might conjecture that a differential operator ought to satisfy a certain boundedness condition &quot;for nice test functions,&quot; or one might state that some interesting topological invariant should be computable &quot;for nice spaces &quot;X&quot;.&quot;
; : Anything that can be assigned to a variable and for which equality with another object can be considered. The term was coined when variables began to be used for sets and mathematical structures.
; onto: A function (which in mathematics is generally defined as mapping the elements of one set &quot;A&quot; to elements of another &quot;B&quot;) is called &quot;&quot;A&quot; onto &quot;B&quot; (instead of &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; or &quot;A&quot; into &quot;B&quot;) only if it is surjective; it may even be said that &quot;f&quot; is onto&quot; (i. e. surjective). Not translatable (without circumlocutions) to some languages other than English.
; proper: If, for some notion of substructure, are substructures of themselves (that is, the relationship is reflexive), then the qualification &quot;proper&quot; requires the objects to be different. For example, a &quot;proper&quot; subset of a set &quot;S&quot; is a subset of &quot;S&quot; that is different from &quot;S&quot;, and a &quot;proper&quot; divisor of a number &quot;n&quot; is a divisor of &quot;n&quot; that is different from &quot;n&quot;. This overloaded word is also non-jargon for a proper morphism.
; regular : A function is called &quot;regular&quot; if it satisfies satisfactory continuity and differentiability properties, which are often context-dependent. These properties might include possessing a specified number of derivatives, with the function and its derivatives exhibiting some &quot;nice&quot; property (see &quot;nice&quot; above), such as Hölder continuity. Informally, this term is sometimes used synonymously with &quot;smooth&quot;, below. These imprecise uses of the word &quot;regular&quot; are not to be confused with the notion of a regular topological space, which is rigorously defined.
; resp.: (Respectively) A convention to shorten parallel expositions. &quot;&quot;A&quot; (resp. &quot;B&quot;) [has some relationship to] &quot;X&quot; (resp. &quot;Y&quot;)&quot; means that &quot;A&quot; [has some relationship to] &quot;X&quot; and also that &quot;B&quot; [has (the same) relationship to] &quot;Y&quot;. For example, squares (resp. triangles) have 4 sides (resp. 3 sides); or compact (resp. Lindelöf) spaces are ones where every open cover has a finite (resp. countable) open subcover.
; sharp: Often, a mathematical theorem will establish constraints on the behavior of some ; for example, a function will be shown to have an upper or lower bound. The constraint is &quot;sharp&quot; (sometimes &quot;optimal&quot;) if it cannot be made more restrictive without failing in some cases. For example, for arbitrary non-negative real numbers &quot;x&quot;, the exponential function &quot;ex&quot;, where &quot;e&quot; = 2.7182818..., gives an upper bound on the values of the quadratic function &quot;x&quot;2. This is not sharp; the gap between the functions is everywhere at least 1. Among the exponential functions of the form α&quot;x&quot;, setting α = &quot;e&quot;2/&quot;e&quot; = 2.0870652... results in a sharp upper bound; the slightly smaller choice α = 2 fails to produce an upper bound, since then α3 = 8 &lt; 32. In applied fields the word &quot;tight&quot; is often used with the same meaning. 
; smooth: &quot;Smoothness&quot; is a concept which mathematics has endowed with many meanings, from simple differentiability to infinite differentiability to analyticity, and still others which are more complicated. Each such usage attempts to invoke the physically intuitive notion of smoothness.
; strong, stronger: A theorem is said to be &quot;strong&quot; if it deduces restrictive results from general hypotheses. One celebrated example is Donaldson&#x27;s theorem, which puts tight restraints on what would otherwise appear to be a large class of manifolds. This (informal) usage reflects the opinion of the mathematical community: not only should such a theorem be strong in the descriptive sense (below) but it should also be definitive in its area. A theorem, result, or condition is further called &quot;stronger&quot; than another one if a proof of the second can be easily obtained from the first but not conversely. An example is the sequence of theorems: Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, Euler&#x27;s theorem, Lagrange&#x27;s theorem, each of which is stronger than the last; another is that a sharp upper bound (see &quot;sharp&quot; above) is a stronger result than a non-sharp one. Finally, the adjective &quot;strong&quot; or the adverb &quot;strongly&quot; may be added to a mathematical notion to indicate a related stronger notion; for example, a strong antichain is an antichain satisfying certain additional conditions, and likewise a strongly regular graph is a regular graph meeting stronger conditions. When used in this way, the stronger notion (such as &quot;strong antichain&quot;) is a technical term with a precisely defined meaning; the nature of the extra conditions cannot be derived from the definition of the weaker notion (such as &quot;antichain&quot;).
; sufficiently large, suitably small, sufficiently close: In the context of limits, these terms refer to some (unspecified, even unknown) point at which a phenomenon prevails as the limit is approached. A statement such as that predicate &quot;P&quot; holds for sufficiently large values, can be expressed in more formal notation by ∃&quot;x&quot; : ∀&quot;y&quot; ≥ &quot;x&quot; : &quot;P&quot;(&quot;y&quot;). See also &quot;eventually&quot;.
; upstairs, downstairs: A descriptive term referring to notation in which two are written one above the other; the upper one is &quot;upstairs&quot; and the lower, &quot;downstairs&quot;. For example, in a fiber bundle, the total space is often said to be &quot;upstairs&quot;, with the base space &quot;downstairs&quot;. In a fraction, the numerator is occasionally referred to as &quot;upstairs&quot; and the denominator &quot;downstairs&quot;, as in &quot;bringing a term upstairs&quot;.
; up to, modulo, mod out by: An extension to mathematical discourse of the notions of modular arithmetic. A statement is true &quot;up to&quot; a condition if the establishment of that condition is the only impediment to the truth of the statement. Also used when working with members of equivalence classes, especially in category theory, where the equivalence relation is (categorical) isomorphism; for example, &quot;The tensor product in a weak monoidal category is associative and unital up to a natural isomorphism.&quot;
; vanish: To assume the value 0. For example, &quot;The function sin(&quot;x&quot;) vanishes for those values of &quot;x&quot; that are integer multiples of π.&quot; This can also apply to limits: see Vanish at infinity.
; weak, weaker: The converse of strong.
; well-defined: Accurately and precisely described or specified. For example, sometimes a definition relies on a choice of some ; the result of the definition must then be independent of this choice.

==Proof terminology==
The formal language of proof draws repeatedly from a small pool of ideas, many of which are invoked through various lexical shorthands in practice.
; aliter: An obsolescent term which is used to announce to the reader an alternative method, or proof of a result. In a proof, it therefore flags a piece of reasoning that is superfluous from a logical point of view, but has some other interest.
; by way of contradiction (BWOC), or &quot;for, if not, ...&quot;: The rhetorical prelude to a proof by contradiction, preceding the negation of the statement to be proved.
; if and only if (iff): An abbreviation for logical equivalence of statements.
; in general: In the context of proofs, this phrase is often seen in induction arguments when passing from the base case to the induction step, and similarly, in the definition of sequences whose first few terms are exhibited as examples of the formula giving every term of the sequence.
; necessary and sufficient: A minor variant on &quot;if and only if&quot;; &quot;&quot;A&quot; is &quot;necessary&quot; (&quot;sufficient&quot;) for &quot;B&quot; means &quot;A&quot; if (only if) &quot;B&quot;&quot;. For example, &quot;For a field &quot;K&quot; to be algebraically closed it is necessary and sufficient that it have no finite field extensions&quot; means &quot;&quot;K&quot; is algebraically closed if and only if it has no finite extensions&quot;. Often used in lists, as in &quot;The following conditions are necessary and sufficient for a field to be algebraically closed...&quot;.
; need to show (NTS), required to prove (RTP), wish to show, want to show (WTS): Proofs sometimes proceed by enumerating several conditions whose satisfaction will together imply the desired theorem; thus, one &quot;needs to show&quot; just these statements.
; one and only one: A statement of the existence and uniqueness of an ; the object exists, and furthermore, no other such object exists.
; Q.E.D.: (&quot;Quod erat demonstrandum&quot;): A Latin abbreviation, meaning &quot;which was to be demonstrated&quot;, historically placed at the end of proofs, but less common currently, having been supplanted by the Halmos end-of-proof mark, a square sign ∎.
; sufficiently nice: A condition on in the scope of the discussion, to be specified later, that will guarantee that some stated property holds for them. When working out a theorem, the use of this expression in the statement of the theorem indicates that the conditions involved may be not yet known to the speaker, and that the intent is to collect the conditions that will be found to be needed in order for the proof of the theorem to go through.
; the following are equivalent (TFAE): Often several equivalent conditions (especially for a definition, such as normal subgroup) are equally useful in practice; one introduces a theorem stating an equivalence of more than two statements with TFAE.
; transport of structure: It is often the case that two are shown to be equivalent in some way, and that one of them is endowed with additional structure. Using the equivalence, we may define such a structure on the second object as well, via &quot;transport of structure&quot;. For example, any two vector spaces of the same dimension are isomorphic; if one of them is given an inner product and if we fix a particular isomorphism, then we may define an inner product on the other space by &quot;factoring through&quot; the isomorphism.

; without (any) loss of generality (WLOG, WOLOG, WALOG), we may assume (WMA): Sometimes a proposition can be more easily proved with additional assumptions on the objects it concerns. If the proposition as stated follows from this modified one with a simple and minimal explanation (for example, if the remaining special cases are identical but for notation), then the modified assumptions are introduced with this phrase and the altered proposition is proved.

==Proof techniques==
Mathematicians have several phrases to describe proofs or proof techniques. These are often used as hints for filling in tedious details.

; angle chasing: Used to describe a geometrical proof that involves finding relationships between the various angles in a diagram.
; back-of-the-envelope calculation: An informal computation omitting much rigor without sacrificing correctness. Often this computation is &quot;proof of concept&quot; and treats only an accessible special case.
; brute force: Rather than finding underlying principles or patterns, this is a method where one would evaluate as many cases as needed to sufficiently prove or provide convincing evidence that the thing in question is true. Sometimes this involves evaluating every possible case (where it is also known as proof by exhaustion).
; by example: A &quot;proof by example&quot; is an argument whereby a statement is not proved but instead illustrated by an example. If done well, the specific example would easily generalize to a general proof.
; by inspection: A rhetorical shortcut made by authors who invite the reader to verify, at a glance, the correctness of a proposed expression or deduction. If an expression can be evaluated by straightforward application of simple techniques and without recourse to extended calculation or general theory, then it can be evaluated &quot;by inspection&quot;. It is also applied to solving equations; for example to find roots of a quadratic equation by inspection is to &#x27;notice&#x27; them, or mentally check them. &#x27;By inspection&#x27; can play a kind of &quot;&quot; role: the answer or solution simply clicks into place.
; by intimidation: Style of proof where claims believed by the author to be easily verifiable are labelled as &#x27;obvious&#x27; or &#x27;trivial&#x27;, which often results in the reader being confused.
; clearly, can be easily shown: A term which shortcuts around calculation the mathematician perceives to be tedious or routine, accessible to any member of the audience with the necessary expertise in the field; Laplace used &quot;obvious&quot; (French: &quot;évident&quot;).
; complete intuition : commonly reserved for jokes (puns on complete induction).
; diagram chasing: Given a commutative diagram of objects and morphisms between them, if one wishes to prove some property of the morphisms (such as injectivity) which can be stated in terms of elements, then the proof can proceed by tracing the path of elements of various objects around the diagram as successive morphisms are applied to it. That is, one &quot;chases&quot; elements around the diagram, or does a &quot;diagram chase&quot;.
; handwaving: A non-technique of proof mostly employed in lectures, where formal argument is not strictly necessary. It proceeds by omission of details or even significant ingredients, and is merely a plausibility argument.
; in general: In a context not requiring rigor, this phrase often appears as a labor-saving device when the technical details of a complete argument would outweigh the conceptual benefits. The author gives a proof in a simple enough case that the computations are reasonable, and then indicates that &quot;in general&quot; the proof is similar.
; index battle: For proofs involving objects with multiple indices which can be solved by going to the bottom (if anyone wishes to take up the effort). Similar to diagram chasing.
; morally true: Used to indicate that the speaker believes a statement &quot;should&quot; be true, given their mathematical experience, even though a proof has not yet been put forward. As a variation, the statement may in fact be false, but instead provide a slogan for or illustration of a correct principle. Hasse&#x27;s local-global principle is a particularly influential example of this.
; obviously: See &quot;clearly&quot;.
; the proof is left as an exercise to the reader: Usually applied to a claim within a larger proof when the proof of that claim can be produced routinely by any member of the audience with the necessary expertise, but is not so simple as to be &quot;obvious&quot;.
; trivial: Similar to &quot;clearly&quot;. A concept is trivial if it holds by definition, is an immediate corollary to a known statement, or is a simple special case of a more general concept.

<text>The Brazilian Air Force (, FAB) is the air branch of the Brazilian Armed Forces and one of the three national uniformed services. The FAB was formed when the Brazilian Army and Navy air branches were merged into a single military force initially called &quot;National Air Forces&quot; in 1941. Both air branches transferred their equipment, installations and personnel to the new force.

According to Flight International (Flightglobal.com) and the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the Brazilian Air Force has an active strength of 80,937 military personnel and operates around 578 aircraft. The Brazilian Air Force is the largest air force in the Southern Hemisphere.

==History==
===Contestado Campaign===

The Contestado War was the first conflict in which Brazilian military aviation was employed. On September 19, 1914, taking advantage of a special train driving troops, three aircraft were boarded: a Morane-Saulnier biplane, a Morane-Saulnier monoplane and a Blitzer SIT biplane. The train continued from Rio de Janeiro passing through São Paulo where it would reach the São Paulo – Rio Grande railway to the station of União da Vitória.

Along the way, sparks shot through the locomotive, hitting a gallon of gasoline in one of the wagons carrying the dismantled aircraft. The fire spread, much like the planes. After the crash, only the Morane-Saulnier remained in flying condition.

In the conflict zone, he coordinated the construction of runways and hangars to be used in União da Vitória, Canoinhas and Rio Negro. Then, two Morane-Saulnier and special ammunition were brought from Rio de Janeiro, as well as a mechanic.

The first aerial activity occurred only on January 4, 1915, when a training flight followed the course of the Iguaçú River to the Timbo River. The first official mission took place on January 19 and the duration of the flight was just over an hour.

The following week, on February 25, 1915, a Morane-Saulnier had an accident. During a test flight in the vicinity of the field, the engine stopped and aircraft crashed with total loss, pilot survived.

March 1, 1915 was the scheduled date for a heavy attack on the rebels. The mission was to fly over the Valley of Santa Maria, to launch bombs on the rebels&#x27; stronghold, and to observe and direct the shots of the artillery and the advance of the infantry. Two Morane-Saulnier aircraft took off, but the attack was canceled due to adverse weather conditions, for the aircraft piloted by then lieutenant-aviator Ricardo Kirk suffered a crash, of which he was killed.

Ricardo Kirk was the first Brazilian Military Aviator. In 1891 he entered the Military Academy and was commissioned an ensign in November, 1893 and to first-lieutenant in March, 1898 and posthumously to captain in 1915.

===Air actions of the Constitutionalist Revolution===

Although the two sides in struggle had few airplanes during the Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932, aviation made a big impact during the conflict. The federal government had approximately 58 aircraft divided between the Navy and the Army.

On the other hand, the Paulistas had only two Potez 25 and two Waco planes, in addition to a small number of tourist planes. At the end of July, the rebel government obtained another plane, brought by Lieutenant Artur Mota Lima, who defected from Campo dos Afonsos, Rio de Janeiro. The &quot;reds&quot;, as the federal government planes were known, not only acted on the lines of combat, but also were used to bombard several cities of São Paulo, among them Campinas, where they caused great damage. They also served as a propaganda weapon, dropping leaflets on enemy cities and into rebel concentration camps.

For the use of aerial means, General Góis Monteiro had in his Staff of two advisers, Captains Vasco Alves Secco and Carlos Pfaltzgraff Brazil.

Major Eduardo Gomes, commander of the Joint Aviation Group, who since the outbreak of hostilities had coordinated the employment of his unit and the reinforcements of the Military Aviation School, was designated, on September 16, Commander of the Air Units of the Army Detachment of the East.

On September 6, Major Ajalmar Vieira Mascarenhas was appointed Commander of the Air Units of the Detachment of the Southern Army.

The Navy&#x27;s aircraft were under the direct operational control of the naval authorities, operating in support of the surface ships deployed near the port of Santos, to effect a naval blockade and also in support of the Naval Flotilla of Mato Grosso, based in Ladário. They also participated in operations with Military Aviation in the Paraíba Valley and on the southern front, in escort and observation missions.

The Air Force of São Paulo was under the overall command of Major Ivo Borges, Commander of the Aviation Units of the Constitutionalist Aviation, and Major Lysias A. Rodrigues, Commander of the Constitutionalist Aviation Group.

===Establishment===

The establishment of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Air Force in April 1918, and the creation of the Italian Air Force (Regia Aeronautica) and the French Air Force during the 1920s drove the idea of uniting Brazilian air power under the same organization. Together with these events the Brazilian strategists were also influenced by the theories of Giulio Douhet, Billy Mitchell and Hugh Montague Trenchard.

The first public manifest to create an integrated military air service came up in 1928 when an army Major called Lysias Rodrigues wrote an article called &quot;An urgent need: The Ministry of the Air&quot; (). Two years later the French Military Mission, working for the Brazilian Army, made the first steps to organize a national air arm. The idea got more support when a group of Brazilian airmen came from Italy in 1934 and explained the advantages of having a military aviation unified. Also, the Spanish Revolution and the first movements of World War II at the end of the thirties showed the importance of Air power for military strategies.

One of the main supporters of the plan to create an independent air arm was the then-president Getúlio Vargas. He organized a study group early in 1940 and the whole structure of the Ministry of Aeronautics () was established the end of that year. This new governmental agency was responsible for the all aspects of the civil and military aviation including infrastructure, regulation and organization.

Formally, the Ministry of Aeronautics was founded on January 20, 1941, and so its military branch called &quot;National Air Forces&quot;, changed to &quot;Brazilian Air Force&quot; () on May, 22. The Army () and Navy () air branches were extinguished and all personnel, aircraft, installations and other related equipment were transferred to FAB.

===World War II===

The Brazilian Air force made important contributions to the Allied war effort in World War II, especially as part of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force on the Italian front.

From mid-1942 until the end of the war, the FAB also patrolled the Atlantic. On 31 July 1943 it claimed the German submarine U-199, which was located on the surface, off Rio de Janeiro, at . Two Brazilian aircraft, a PBY Catalina and a Lockheed Hudson, and an American PBM Mariner attacked the U-boat. The Catalina, named , was captained by 2nd Lt. Alberto M. Torres, and hit &quot;U-199&quot; with depth charges, sinking her. Forty-nine of the crew were killed, although twelve Germans managed to escape, including the captain. This was possible due to the Catalina&#x27;s crew, who threw a lifeboat to the survivors.
&quot;1st Fighter Group&quot;, which saw action in Italy, was formed on December 18, 1943. Its commanding officer was Aviation Lt.Col. Nero Moura.

The group had 350 men, including 43 pilots. The group was divided into four flights: Red (&quot;A&quot;), Yellow (&quot;B&quot;), Blue (&quot;C&quot;), and Green (&quot;D&quot;). The CO of the group and some officers were not attached to any specific flight. Unlike the BEF&#x27;s Army component, the 1º GAVCA had personnel who were experienced Brazilian Air Force pilots. One of them was Alberto M. Torres, who had piloted a PBY Catalina that had sunk U-199, operating off the Brazilian coast.

The group trained for combat in Panama, where 2º Ten.-Av. (Aviation Second Lieutenant) Dante Isidoro Gastaldoni was killed in a training accident. On May 11, 1944, the group was declared operational and became active in the air defense of the Panama Canal Zone. On June 22, the 1º GAVCA traveled to the US to convert to the Republic P-47D Thunderbolt.

On September 19, 1944, the 1º GAVCA left for Italy, arriving at Livorno on October 6. It became part of the 350th Fighter Group of the USAAF, which in turn was part of the 62nd Fighter Wing, XXII Tactical Air Command, of the 12th Air Force.

The Brazilian pilots initially flew from 31 October 1944, as individual elements of flights attached to 350th FG squadrons, at first in affiliation flights and progressively taking part in more dangerous missions. Less than two weeks later, on November 11, the group started its own operations flying from its base at Tarquinia, using its tactical callsign &quot;Jambock&quot;. Brazilian Air Force stars replaced the white U.S. star in the roundel on the FAB Thunderbolts. The 1oGAVCA started its fighting career as a fighter-bomber unit, its missions being armed reconnaissance and interdiction, in support of the US Fifth Army, to which the FEB was attached.
On April 16, 1945, the U.S. Fifth Army started its offensive along the Po Valley. By then, the strength of the Group had fallen to 25 pilots, some having been killed and others shot down and captured. Some others had been relieved from operations on medical grounds due to combat fatigue. The Group disbanded the Yellow flight and distributed the surviving pilots among the other flights. Each pilot flew on average two missions a day.

On 22 April 1945, the three remaining flights took off at 5-minute intervals, starting at 8:30 AM, to destroy bridges, barges, and motorized vehicles in the San Benedetto region. At 10:00 AM, a flight took off for an armed reconnaissance mission south of Mantua. They destroyed more than 80 tanks, trucks, and vehicles. By the end of the day, the group had flown 44 individual missions and destroyed hundreds of vehicles and barges. On this day the group flew the most sorties of the war; consequently, Brazil commemorates April 22 Brazilian Fighter Arm Day.

In all, the 1oGAVCA flew a total of 445 missions, 2,550 individual sorties, and 5,465 combat flight hours, from 11 November 1944 to 6 May 1945. The XXII Tactical Air Command acknowledged the efficiency of the Group by noting that although it flew only 5% of the total of missions carried out by all squadrons under its control, it accomplished a much higher percentage of the total destruction wrought:
* 85% of the ammunition depots
* 36% of the fuel depots
* 28% of the bridges (19% damaged)
* 15% of motor vehicles (13% damaged)
* 10% of horse-drawn vehicles (10% damaged)

===Post World War II===

After the war, the FAB began flying the British Gloster Meteor jet fighter. The jets were purchased from the British for 15,000 tons of crude cotton, as Brazil had no foreign currency reserves to spare. The jet was operated by the FAB until the mid-1960s, when it was replaced by the F-80C and TF-33A, which were later replaced by the MB-326, Mirage III and Northrop F-5 jets.

During events involving the Lobster War, between 1961 and 1964, the Brazilian Air Force played an important role in monitoring and patrolling the large area of litigation with France, making its B-17 squadrons available for observation and photo-reconnaissance of French vessels close to Brazilian coast, in addition to using its most modern anti-submarine warfare means, such as the S-2 Tracker and P-2V Neptune.

Having been given authority over all national military aircraft since 1941, from her commissioning in 1961 to 1999 the Brazilian Air Force flew the S-2 Trackers of the aircraft carrier &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; while from 1965 naval aviation flew its own helicopters. Now naval aviation is also authorized to fly its own fixed wing carrier based aircraft.

===Cold War===
During the Cold War, the then Brazilian military government was aligned with the United States and NATO. This meant that the Northrop F-5 could be bought cheaply from the United States, which called this jet the &quot;Freedom Fighter&quot;. Many other countries, such as Mexico, also benefited from this policy. But Brazil did not buy the F-5A Freedom Fighter, instead buying the F-5 Tiger II years later.

In the middle of the Cold War, between 1970 and 1974, the Brazilian Air Force used its attack aircraft to bomb camps of internal Maoist guerrilla groups in the regions of the Vale do Ribeira and in the Araguaia River, attacking targets inside the jungles, using North American T-6 attack planes and Douglas B-26 Invader bombers armed with napalm.

In 1977 the Brazilian Air Force conducted Operation Saucer regarding alleged UFO sightings in the city of Colares, Pará State. The objects observed in the military records received the nickname of luminous bodies and were associated with phenomena reported by residents and authorities, reported by the local press, which reported alleged attacks on the civilian population. The operation was terminated after 4 months, and other related missions were carried out during 1978 by the National Intelligence Service. The Operation&#x27;s documentary collection comprises hundreds of pages of documents, such as reports, photographic images and footage.

On April 9, 1982, the Brazilian Air Force showed its ability to guarantee Brazilian sovereignty. In the midst of the Falklands War, on a rainy Good Friday night, the radar system detected a lyushin II-62M, registration number CU-T1225, Soviet-made and belonging to Cubana, a Cuban state company about 300 km away from Brasilia. Two F-103E Mirage III fighters from the 1st Air Defense Group (1st GDA), based at Anápolis Air Base, took off at around 9:00 pm to carry out the mission to protect Brazilian airspace. Under the guidance of the ground control, the two F-103Es positioned themselves next to the Cuban invader. It was then that, from the Military Operations Center, Major José Orlando Bellon said on the radio, in English: &quot;You were intercepted. There are two combat aircraft at your side. The order is to land in Brasilia immediately &quot;. Under the surveillance of Brazilian fighters, they made a landing at Brasilia International Airport at 10:12 pm.

On June 3, 1982, two F-5E Tiger II fighters from the 1st Fighter Aviation Group, based at the Santa Cruz Air Force Base - Rio de Janeiro, intercepted an Avro Vulcan Royal Air Force that had technical problems when returning from a mission during the Falklands War in the South Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. The aircraft was temporarily detained in Brazil.

On May 19, 1986, a series of radar and visual contacts with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) took place across the Brazilian states of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Goiás, the Santa Cruz Air Force Base was put on alert due to the presence of several unidentified radar plots around São José dos Campos. Around half an hour later, Anápolis Air Force Base reports the detection of radar echoes at radial 270 of its VOR, prompting the air base to also be put on alert. During the events of that night, 2 Northrop F-5 and 3 Dassault Mirage III fighters were activated in an attempt to intercept dozens of UFOs over the four Brazilian states. The Minister of the Air Force, Brigadier Lt. of the Air Octávio Júlio Moreira Lima granted a press conference on the 23rd of May along with the fighter pilots, confirming the events of the 19th and stating, &quot;It&#x27;s not about believing or not [in aliens]. We can only give out technical information . There are several hypotheses. Technically, I&#x27;d tell you gentlemen that we have no explanation.&quot;

The Embraer (, Brazilian Aeronautic Co.) company has its origins as an enterprise directly managed and sponsored by the FAB. Working with Italian corporations, it developed the new AMX attack aircraft (known locally as the A-1) which makes up the backbone of the FAB&#x27;s attack force. The successful Tucano T-27 trainer and the new A-29 light attack aircraft are also Embraer types used extensively by the FAB.

During Operation Traira, in February 1991, six AT-27 Tucanos were used for close air support against a group of 40 rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which had seized a Brazilian military detachment.

===Post Cold War===

In October, 2002, the Brazilian Air Force used its A-1 AMX fighter bombers to destroy clandestine airstrips used by the narcotics traffickers in the interior of the Amazon rainforest near the border with Suriname. The operation also had support from the Brazilian Army and Brazilian Federal Police with many drug dealers being arrested as a result. The AMX Bomber/Fighter was the primary plane used.

On November 21, 2008, F-5E Tiger II fighter jets from the 1st Fighter Aviation Group based at the Santa Cruz Air Force Base intercepted a civilian cargo Douglas DC-8 from a private company in Ghana as it entered the Brazilian airspace, off the coast of Cabo Frio, littoral of Rio de Janeiro. The aircraft was escorted by the Brazilian F-5s to the Galeão Air Force Base.

On 3 June 2009, two Brazilian Air Force A-29 Super Tucanos, guided by an Embraer R-99, intercepted a Cessna U206G engaged in drug trafficking activities. Inbound from Bolivia, the Cessna was intercepted in the region of Alta Floresta d&#x27;Oeste, and after exhausting all procedures, one of the Super Tucanos fired a warning shot from its 12.7 mm machine guns, after which the aircraft followed the Super Tucanos to Cacoal airport.

In 2010, the FAB worked on the Search &amp; Rescue mission of Air France Flight 447.
The Brazilian Air Force has started a search and rescue from the Brazilian archipelago of Fernando de Noronha, sending eight planes to search a stretch bounded by the coastal cities of Recife, Natal and the archipelago of Fernando de Noronha.

On March 12, 2012, during the Operation Agata 4, the Brazilian Air Force used two A-29 Super Tucano to destroy a clandestine runway used by drug traffickers within the Amazon rainforest.

In 2011–2013, Operation Agatha marks the start of a new decade of the twenty-first century with the consolidation of the Amazon Surveillance System (SIVAM), an intricate network of radars, meteorological sensors, digital satellite communications, and advanced air-traffic-control software, among other technological advances available to Brazilian Military personnel. The Brazilian Air Force (FAB), which deployed new tactics and methods of fighting using RQ-450 remote-controlled aircraft. Operating in conjunction with sophisticated E-99 Guardian planes, they will locate objectives for A-29 Super Tucano fighters flying in darkness. Northrop F-5EM fighters, responsible for providing air superiority.
In July 2016, Defense Aerospace Brazilian command displays participation of Brazilian Air Force at the Olympic Games Rio 2016, there will be over 15,000 military and 80 aircraft involved in the Olympics. To defense missions and aerial patrol 32 fighters (Northrop F-5M and A-29 Super Tucano), for aerial warning missions 2 radar aircraft (Embraer R-99), surveillance missions 3 Unmanned aircraft (Hermes 450 and Hermes 900), for maritime patrol missions 1 (P-3 Orion), for logistical support missions (Boeing C-767, C-130 and C-295), 15 helicopters (Mil Mi-35, UH-60 Black Hawk and EC-725).

Between 2004 and 2017, the FAB worked on the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) supporting the United Nations force (a joint Brazilian, Uruguayan, Chilean and Argentine force) deployed there.

In November 2017, while searching for the missing Argentine Submarine ARA San Juan, the Brazilian Air Force sent a C-295M search and rescue aircraft and a P-3AM Orion anti-submarine warfare aircraft to assist in the international search effort.

In January 2021, in the middle of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Brazilian city of Manaus, located in the interior of the amazon rainforest, was left with an overburdened medical service needing medical supplies and transferring patients, a major operation was set up by Brazilian air force, mobilizing all its available transport aviation, aircraft C-130, KC-390, C-97 Brasilia, C-95M Bandeirantes, CASA C-105 and C-99 were deployed for the largest aeromedical evacuation operation in Brazilian aviation military history.

In October 2023, during the Israel-Hamas war, the Brazilian Air Force together with the Brazilian government mounted its largest repatriation operation of nationals in a conflict zone in history, employing 6 aircraft (2 Airbus A330 MRTT, 2 Embraer C-390 Millennium and 2 Embraer Lineage 1000) to rescue more than 2,700 people from the conflict zone between Hamas and Israel.

===Future of the Air Force===

The Air Force has a large number of active and planned projects, under the modernization plans of the Brazilian Armed Forces, defined in the &quot;National Defense White Paper&quot;.

==Inventory==
===Aircraft===

===Developments===

In the early 2000s, with renewed economic stability, the FAB underwent an extensive renewal of its inventory through several acquisition programs, the most ambitious of which was the acquisition of 36 new front-line interceptor aircraft to replace its aging Mirage III. Known in the late 1990s as the F-X Project, the program was postponed during the presidential mandate of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who in the end of 2002 left the decision for his successor Luís Inácio ‘Lula’ da Silva, who postponed it again in 2003 and 2004. It was cancelled in 2005.

On July 15, 2005, one agreement was set with the French government for the transfer of twelve Dassault Mirage 2000s (ten &quot;C&quot; and two &quot;B&quot; versions) second-hand ex-Armée de L&#x27;Air. Known as F-2000s in Brazil, the first two aircraft arrived at Anápolis Air Base on September 4, 2006.

In 2007, Brazilian Air Force&#x27;s Institute for Advanced Studies started the 14-X development, a hypersonic scramjet demonstrator envisaged to fly at 30 km of altitude at 3 km/s, corresponding to Mach number 10. In March 2012 a Mach 7 variation has been suggested, named as 14-X S.

On 2006, the F-X Project was restarted under a new name: &quot;F-X2 Project&quot;, and with a bigger budget. The competitors for acquisition were the Eurofighter Typhoon, Sukhoi Su-35, Gripen NG, Dassault Rafale, Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and, although information on Lockheed Martin&#x27;s F-35 Lightning II was requested, Lockheed Martin presented an F-16 Fighting Falcon variant (designated F-16BR). In October 2008, FAB released a shortlist of 3 aircraft: Saab Gripen NG, Dassault Rafale and Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. In February 2009, the three companies provided their final bids. In September 2009, following a surprise French visit to Brazil, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Nicolas Sarkozy, from France, made a new military cooperation agreement. Lula, on an interview at TV5 Monde, said French Rafale was a step forward, as technology transfer would be effective.

On September 7, 2009, Brazilian Independence Day, it was announced Brazil would negotiate 36 Dassault Rafale. But the Defence Minister did not confirm the final decision.

On January 5, 2010, after lobbying by Air Force Officers and Commanders, it was reported that the final evaluation report by the Brazilian Air Force placed the Saab Gripen NG ahead of the other contenders. The decisive factor was apparently the overall cost of the new fighters, both in terms of unit cost, and operating and maintenance costs, and the personal preference of the test pilots. Rafale was reported not to be even the second choice. It was announced in February 2011 that the decision would be further delayed due to budget cuts. And that July the decision was put off for yet another six-month extension.

However, in 2013, yet another six-month delay was announced. In early June 2013, after a visit from US Vice President Joe Biden with Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff; Biden assured President Rousseff that the US Congress would approve technology transfer for Boeing&#x27;s F-18s. In a move apparently following the NSA spying scandal, Russia has also offered Brazil a stake in the development of the Sukhoi PAK-FA 5th generation jet fighter with complete stealth technology transfer.

Saab won the competition on 18 December 2013. The change away from the American jet was due to the 2013 Global surveillance disclosure, according to Reuters reporting; other sources agree with the official rationale that the decision was due to cost and technological transfer. As of January 2014, Brazil is in negotiations with Saab to lease current model Gripens while they wait four years for the next generation jets on order to be developed and built.

On July 28, 2015, the Brazilian government met with a Swedish trading commission to revisit the contract and request a low of 2.58% in interest rates to 1.98% per annum, generating a savings of 1 billion dollars in 25 years. Sweden rejected the application and signing the contract is seriously threatened with limit until October 2015. On July 29, 2015, the Brazilian government confirmed that it had reached an agreement with Sweden to finance the purchase of a batch of 36 Gripen NG.

In September 2015 Brazil finalized the US$4.68 billion purchase of 36 Saab Gripen E fighters to be delivered between 2019 and 2024. An assembly line is being established in Brazil to build 15 of the aircraft with engineers and technicians from Brazil traveling to Sweden to begin training. Saab officials have said they believe this is just an initial order, with potential for additional sales to other Latin American countries.

===Helicopter aerial refueling===

In November 2020 the Brazilian Air Force (FAB), through a technical and multidisciplinary team coordinated by the Department of Aerospace Science and Technology, concluded, on October 30, in Rio de Janeiro, the last phase of the inflight refueling tests campaign between the H-36 Caracal helicopter and the KC-130 Hercules aircraft.

The flights took place in a restricted area under military control, on the coast of Rio de Janeiro, where the refueling aircraft KC-130 Hercules of the Squadron Gordo ( &quot;fat&quot;, 1st / 1st GT) and H-36 Caracal helicopters from squadrons Falcão ( &quot;Falcon&quot; 1st / 8th GAV) and Puma (3rd / 8th GAV) met to perform the REVO procedure.

The Campaign aimed to complete the tasks foreseen in the certification process, including the unprecedented steps of transferring fuel from the KC-130 to the H-36 and the simultaneous refueling of two helicopters.

As a result, Brazil becomes the first country in South America with the ability to refuel helicopters in flight, a historic landmark for Brazilian Air Force and Brazil.

===Datalink===

The Link-BR2 is a datalink developed by the Air Force and the Brazilian defence company AEL Sistemas, this technology allow the exchange of data such radar information, videos and images with other units of the three branches anytime and anywhere, using an advanced encrypted protocol with a high degree of security.

==Structure==

The Brazilian Air Force is the aerospace branch of the Brazilian armed forces and is managed by the &quot;Aeronautics Command&quot; (). The COMAER was created in 1999 and is assigned as service branch of the Armed Forces as part of the Ministry of Defense ().

The COMAER is the department of the Air Force, the successor of the former Ministry of Aeronautics, when it was absorbed into the Ministry of Defence. The department is led by the &quot;Aeronautics Commander&quot; (). The Commander is the most senior Air Force rank (), is appointed by the President, and reports directly to the Minister of Defense. The COMAER includes the Air Force Staff (&quot;Estado-Maior da Aeronáutica&quot; (&quot;EMAER&quot;)). The COMAER is in charge of seven major organization bodies, which comprise the FAB.

Readiness Command (&quot;Comando de Preparo&quot; (&quot;COMPREP&quot;)) is the successor of the former General Command of Air Operations (). It is headquartered in Brasília, DF and commands most of the air force&#x27;s flying units, responsible for their operational training and readiness.

Aerospace Operations Command (&quot;Comando de Operações Aeroespaciais&quot; (&quot;COMAE&quot;)) succeeded the Brazilian Aerospace Defence Command (&quot;Comando de Defesa Aeroespacial Brasileiro&quot; (&quot;COMDABRA&quot;)), also headquartered in Brasília, DF. It is responsible for the constant surveillance and security of the country&#x27;s aerospace and takes over operational command of the COMPREP&#x27;s units.

General Command for Support (&quot;Comando-Geral de Apoio&quot; (&quot;COMGAP&quot;)) is in charge of aircraft and infrastructure maintenance and logistics. It is headquartered in São Paulo, SP.

General Command for Personnel (&quot;Comando-Geral de Pessoal&quot; (&quot;COMGEP&quot;)) is in charge of personnel development, training, medicine and documentation. HQ is in Brasília, DF.

Aerospace Control Department (&quot;Departamento de Controle do Espaço Aéreo&quot; (&quot;DECEA&quot;)) is in charge of air defence, air traffic control (both civil and military), control and communications, meteorology, cartography and enforcement of civil air traffic regulations. HQ is at Rio de Janeiro - Santos Dumont IAP, RJ.

Science and Aerospace Technology Department (&quot;Departamento de Ciência e Tecnologia Aeroespacial&quot; (&quot;DCTA&quot;)) is in charge of technology development, project management and industry relations with the private sector. HQ is at São José dos Campos IAP, SP.

Economy, Finance and Administration Secretariate (&quot;Secretaria de Economia, Finanças e Administração da Aeronáutica&quot; (&quot;SEFA&quot;)) is headquartered in Brasília, DF.

There are also seven &quot;Regional Air Commands&quot; (). The four former operational air forces were specialised into advanced flying training (I. Air Force), maritime patrol and helicopters (II. Air Force), combat aviation (III. Air Force) and air transport (V. Air Force). The seven regional air force commands were specialised into land-based operational support, air force infrastructure maintenance and support to the civilian population. Each region had a single air transport squadron as its only flying unit. Beginning 2016, the Air Force&#x27;s flying operations were merged into the Air Force Readiness Command (AFRC), which was organized into 12 wings and the 1st Air Defense Brigade. The four air forces were disbanded and their flying squadrons were re-assigned to the air bases, which in turn were subordinated to the air force regions, giving them operational tasks.

===Air units organization===

At unit levels, &quot;Groups&quot; () usually consist of one to sixteen consecutively numbered &quot;Squadrons&quot; (), each with varying numbers of aircraft, usually from six to 12. Smaller formations are known as &quot;Flights&quot; (). According to its tasks, a group has one of the following designations:
* Air Defense Group: : Air defense fighters. (Fighter Jets)
* Transport Group: : Transport, Flight refueling
* Aviation Group: : Fighter, attack, reconnaissance, SAR, rotary wing
* Fighter Aviation Group: : Fighter, attack planes
* Troop Transport Group: : Transports, troop carrying, parachutist drop
* Special Flight Inspection Group: : Calibration
* Special Test Flights Group: : Test flights
* Special Transport Group: : VIP transport
Common used designations for squadrons are:
* Air Transport Squadron: 
* Air Training Squadron: 
* Demonstration flying team: (also called )

The Military Units of the Brazilian Air Force are:
=== Airspace Control Department ===

Air Traffic Control in Brazil is militarised and under the Air Force. This is a legacy from the time when each of the three armed serviced was under its own government ministry and the corresponding &quot;Ministério da Aeronáutica&quot; (&quot;MAER&quot;) was in charge of both the FAB and civil aviation. The Airspace Control Department (&quot;Departamento de Controle do Espaço Aéreo&quot; (DECEA)) was established in 1942 and due to the civil-military character of the former Ministry of Aeronautics it developed into a heterogenous service tasked with air force communications, operations command and control, civil air traffic control, aerial navigation systems calibration and meteorology, even including a disciplinary council for violations of airspace directives.

===Brazilian Air Force Infantry===

The Air Force Security Groups, which replaced the Air Force Infantry Battalions in 2018–21, are composed of Air Force Police Companies, Air Force Base Defense Squadrons, Firefighting Companies and Quick Reaction Companies, in addition, they are organized into:

* Group HQ and HQ Squadron
* Supply and Logistics Squadron
* Enlisted Training Section
* Mobilization and National Service Squadron
* Training Squadron
* Guard of Honor Squadron

The Esquadrão Aeroterrestre de Salvamento, known as Para-SAR, although it is operationally subordinated to the Readiness Command&#x27;s 5th Wing, and its subordinate flights, are also part of the Air Force Infantry.

Destined to the protection of the air force bases and other terrestrial installation, the air defense forces also manned by the Air Force Infantry. At FAB, there are three groups, each stationed in the air bases in Canoas, Manaus and Anápolis.

The Fire Fighting Service, whether be in the Air Force Command or in air bases, is responsible for maintaining the safety of the various military airfields, shared or not, as well as the buildings of interest of this command. Follows international standards of protection to the flight, having like the Central Organ of its management, the Direction of Aeronautical Engineering. The military and civilians belonging to this sector are properly qualified professionals and have the need to be continuously alert for the prompt attendance of aeronautical emergencies, which according to ICAO rules have only 3 minutes to attend an aeronautical emergency that occurs in the area Of the aerodrome.

Formed in 1941 with the formation of the Air Force the Air Force Infantry is organized on a regional basis with units stationed in air bases all over Brazil.

===Airborne Rescue Squadron (PARA-SAR)===

The Esquadrão Aeroterrestre de Salvamento (EAS) (English: Airborne Rescue Squadron), known by its nickname Para-SAR, is a Brazilian Air Force airborne search and rescue squadron, based in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The unit has seven SAR teams located in seven states. Each Para-SAR detachment is made up of SAR qualified military parachutists. Members of this unit can be distinguished by their maroon berets and orange baseball caps.

The Brazilian Air Force has a long history of parachute training. In 1943, at the former Alfonsos Field School of Aeronautics and with the support of the Air Force, cadet gymnastics instructor Achile Garcia Charles Astor first introduced civil parachute training in Brazil.

Seeing the usefulness of having a parachuting unit, the Electronics and Flight Protection Administration conducted studies to see how such a unit could be created under the auspices of the air force. The results of that study gave rise to the Para-SAR.

In 1946, the Brazilian Army formed its parachute school, the now-named General Penha Brazil Parachutist&#x27;s Instruction Center. It graduated its first class of Brazilian Air Force students in 1959.

<text>Lady Shiva (real name Sandra Woosan or more recently Sandra Wu-San) is a character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was co-created by Dennis O&#x27;Neil and Ric Estrada, and first appeared in &quot;Richard Dragon, Kung Fu Fighter&quot; #5. Over time, she has become more closely associated with Batman and related characters, both as an enemy and an ally. She is a Chinese/Japanese martial arts grandmaster and one of the most skilled combatants in the DC Universe. She is an assassin-for-hire who specializes in killing her targets with her bare hands, and is the mother of Cassandra Cain, aka Batgirl.

==Fictional character biography==

===Becoming Lady Shiva===

====Pre-Crisis====
Shiva is first introduced as an antagonist to martial artist Richard Dragon, believing him to be a spy responsible for the murder of her sister, Carolyn. In reality, Carolyn&#x27;s murder was orchestrated by Guano Cravat, a corrupt businessman whose criminal ambitions had been foiled by Dragon. Cravat convinced Woosan that Dragon killed Carolyn, deliberately pitting her against Dragon in an act of revenge.

To avenge her twin sister, Woosan becomes a master combatant. During the course of her training, she discovers that she is a , rapidly mastering several martial arts and eventually dubbing herself &quot;Lady&quot; Shiva.

When Shiva tracks Dragon down and lures him to Cravat&#x27;s hideout, Dragon reveals Cravat&#x27;s deception. The Swiss, Carolyn&#x27;s real murderer and Cravat&#x27;s underling, had already died in battle with Dragon, rendering Shiva&#x27;s vendetta moot.

Afterward, she briefly takes up crimefighting with Dragon and fellow martial artist Ben Turner, to allay her feelings of purposelessness, saying &quot;I tolerate Dragon because danger seems to cling to him like flies to honey... and without danger my life is empty!&quot; Dragon, in hopes that she might follow his example and use her skills for good, coaxes her to explore the spiritual side of martial arts, to no apparent success. When the three eventually part ways, Shiva begins a wandering existence, training herself further, and eventually parlaying her skills into a career as a master assassin.

====Post-Crisis====
Shiva is born in a shanty town, in an unknown country, and raised to be a warrior and protector of the village. Eventually, Shiva flees the village with her sister. Years later, when the heroine Black Canary visits the village to experience Shiva&#x27;s training, a village child named Sin is held hostage by the villagers, with the promise that if Canary fails to become the warrior-protector of the village, Sin is to take her place, suggesting that Shiva&#x27;s sister was once used in a similar manner. Speaking about her childhood, Sin says that Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s League of Assassins ran the village where she and Shiva were born and raised.

The sisters moved to Detroit, Michigan, using the names Sandra and Carolyn Wu-San. There, they devoted their time to practicing the martial arts. Because of the girls&#x27; young ages, talent, and unique bond as sisters, their practice evolved into a secret, perfected language that only they could share. Out of love for her sister, Sandra held back in her spars with Carolyn. The assassin David Cain saw this restraint in Sandra one day when he visited Detroit to see the siblings perform. Considering Sandra a kindred spirit, Cain murdered Carolyn to remove the obstruction that blunted Sandra&#x27;s true potential.

Discovering that David Cain had murdered her sister, Sandra hunted him down, only to be lured into an ambush by Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s League of Assassins, of which Cain was a member. In the heat of a losing battle, Sandra realized how Carolyn had held her back, and how much undeveloped potential she had. Cain spared her life, and in exchange, Sandra agreed to bear Cain a child, and leave it for him to raise. The child, Cassandra Cain, was to be Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s &quot;One Who is All&quot;, a perfected bodyguard, whose only form of communication was literacy in body language, and whose sole instinct was for hand-to-hand combat. With Carolyn gone, Cassandra and Sandra were the only two humans known to share this gift. The day of Cassandra&#x27;s birth, Sandra set out to become reborn as the Lady Shiva: creator and destroyer.

===Professional assassin===
====Meeting the Question====
During her time with Richard Dragon, Shiva becomes addicted to combat and life-or-death situations. Already a very accomplished martial artist, Shiva hires herself out as a mercenary both to recapture the thrill and to finance further training. Her considerable skills allow her to ask a high price for her services, and she soon becomes highly sought after.

Shiva is eventually hired by Reverend Hatch, the corrupt adjunct to the mayor of Hub City, to fight troublesome masked crimefighter the Question. She defeats him with ease, but rather than have Shiva kill him, Hatch instead has his men beat the Question further, shoot him in the head with an air gun, and dump him into the river. Seeing &quot;a passion for combat&quot; in the hero, Shiva rescues a near-death Question, and brings him to Richard Dragon&#x27;s mountain hideaway, to give him a chance to fulfill his potential. In his civilian identity as Victor Sage, the Question enters Dragon&#x27;s tutelage, training in combat and undergoing a spiritual awakening.

On leaving Dragon, Sage meets Shiva, who orders him to fight her. She ends the fight after only a few moves, and confirms her own suspicions of a &quot;warrior&#x27;s passion&quot; in him, because he was willing to fight her even after his previous, crushing defeat. However, influenced by Dragon&#x27;s philosophy, Sage proposes that he was simply &quot;curious&quot; what would happen if they fought again. Shiva leaves without telling Sage why she saved him, and Sage readopts the identity of the Question, returning to Hub City.

====Shiva and the O-Sensei====
Shiva eventually travels to Manchuria to visit with her godfather, O-Sensei, former instructor of Richard Dragon and Bronze Tiger. After living over 150 years, he has finally decided to die. He intends to keep a promise to his wife, and be buried alongside her, but his wife&#x27;s family had hidden her remains to punish him for abandoning her. O-Sensei has Shiva select three warriors to aid him in the search for her remains: the Question, Green Arrow, and Batman. Reluctant to acknowledge O-Sensei&#x27;s death wish, Shiva expresses her ambivalence both verbally and physically, unnecessarily applying deadly force in battles with O-Sensei&#x27;s assailants.

Shiva and O-Sensei then travel to Hub City, meeting with the Question, who, in turn, brokered Shiva&#x27;s first meeting with Batman. Compelled to test his skill, Shiva immediately fights the vigilante only to be stopped by O-Sensei. They do, however, convince Batman to aid them.

In their search for Green Arrow, Shiva encounters slave traders, killing all except one, who successfully cuts her; she rewards him with a kiss on the forehead. After locating Green Arrow, she meets Black Canary for the first time, and spars with the hero. Although Canary does not know it at the time, the two had both studied under Sensei Otomo, though non-concurrently.

After recruiting Green Arrow, Shiva returns to Hub City, and saves the Question from an attack by former employees of the now-dead Reverend Hatch. Shiva kills the men, who had been after a fortune in embezzled funds stored in Hatch&#x27;s abandoned home, and sets fire to the money. Later, she nurses the Question&#x27;s elderly friend Tot back to health. While the Question puzzles over her inscrutable and violent nature, she confesses that O-Sensei was &quot;the one man I am certain I would not harm if he kissed me&quot;.

When Batman discovers that the remains of O-Sensei&#x27;s wife had been moved to a small island, Shiva, O-Sensei, Green Arrow, and the Question set out for the island, only to be caught in a storm. O-Sensei is lost overboard, but the group discovers that his wife&#x27;s remains had likewise been mislaid, years earlier, while in transport, leaving O-Sensei&#x27;s promise fulfilled.

====Toward Sodom and Gomorrah====
When Hub City falls victim to rapid, systemic urban decay, Shiva returns to offer her services to one of the ruling gangs, but instead kills the members for sending &quot;unskilled&quot; men to kill her. On meeting the Question, she is dismayed to find that staying in Hub City has atrophied his fighting skills. Nevertheless, she repeatedly saves both him and his lover, Mayor Myra Fermin, from assassins.

She vanishes sometime later, only to reappear stepping out of a helicopter meant to rescue the Question and his companions, who have decided to flee the city. Shiva explains that though the Question and his friends wished to leave, it is now a fit place for her to go toward. The Question and Shiva have a final exchange before he leaves.

====After Hub City====
Shiva continues to work as a mercenary for money, challenge, and perfection of her skills. Eventually, she crosses paths with the League of Assassins, and its leader, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, and begins an on-and-off association with them. Though she has kept close ties with the League, she sometimes works against their interests, as seen during &quot;&quot;.

While training prospective assassins, mercenaries, and terrorists in war-torn country, she is approached by Jason Todd, the second Robin, and his guardian Batman, acting on evidence that she had associated with Todd&#x27;s father, and speculating that she might be his mother.

Eager to finally face Batman uninterrupted, Shiva knocks Robin unconscious and challenges the Dark Knight. Initially underestimating Shiva, Batman soon learns that her skills are such that she could kill him, and begins to fight in earnest. It takes intervention from Robin to knock Shiva unconscious and subdue her for interrogation. When asked if she was Jason&#x27;s mother, Shiva laughs, sarcastically claiming to have littered dozens of babies across the globe. When Batman doses her with sodium pentothal, Shiva claims to have no children, confirming that Jason is not her son. Batman leaves her in the desert, reasoning that she would soon free herself from her bonds. Shiva warns him that they would meet again, to which Batman simply replies &quot;Too bad&quot;.

Later, Shiva begins to track down those who referred to themselves as Shihan, &quot;Master&quot;, or any other title proclaiming mastery of a martial arts form. She would learn what she could from them and, depending on their skill and personal whim, kill them when they were of no further use to her.

===Teaching a Little Bird===
In further pursuit of her art, Shiva tracks the defeats of martial arts masters to discover new techniques. In this way, she develops an interest in the defeat of Koroshi, master of the art of empty-handed fighting. Gaining no information from Koroshi himself, she begins to search for King Snake, the man rumored to have defeated him. During her search, she meets Tim Drake, who is fighting King Snake&#x27;s criminal organization, the Ghost Dragons, as part of his training to become the third Robin.

Shiva sees potential in Drake, and takes him on as a student for a few weeks. As a bonus, she offers to train him in one weapon, and he chooses the bo staff. Shiva derisively mentions that it is not a lethal weapon, and Drake explains that was the reason he had chosen it. At the end of his training, he defeats Shiva in a sparring match with the bo by using a whistle to distract her, and she gives him a collapsible bo staff.

Eventually, they discover that the Ghost Dragons are creating a virulent plague. Robin, Shiva, and ally Clyde Rawlins attempt to stop them from releasing it, but the Dragons escape with a few canisters. After tracking them to Hong Kong, they eventually defeat King Snake, though Rawlins dies in the attempt and Shiva mostly witnesses the proceedings. While King Snake hangs precariously on the ledge of a building, Shiva orders Robin to kill him to signify his &quot;graduation&quot; and become her &quot;weapon&quot;. Robin refuses and leaves. Shiva then throws King Snake off the ledge herself, though he survives the fall.

===Getting involved with Gotham===

After Bane breaks Batman&#x27;s back, Batman seeks training from Shiva to help him regain his skills and fighting spirit (see &quot;&quot;). Though she deems him unworthy of her efforts, she devises a training regimen, out of respect for what he had been before his injuries. As part of this training, Shiva kills the Armless Master, a sensei notable for training Catwoman, while wearing a tengu mask, making sure that his death was both witnessed and relayed to his best students. Shiva then makes Batman wear the mask while performing training missions. He is then ambushed by the master&#x27;s students, who mistake him for the &quot;Tengu Mask warrior&quot;. He defeats all of them in turn, but Shiva attempts to complete Batman&#x27;s training by manipulating him into killing an opponent using her fatal Leopard Blow. Batman simply feigns using the maneuver on an assailant to trick her into believing he used lethal force. Shiva later discovers the truth, but does not seek vengeance.

Later, she helps Batman fight Ra&#x27;s al Ghul and his League of Assassins, including Bane, when Ghul attempts to release a deadly virus called Ebola Gulf A that would have killed half the world&#x27;s population (see &quot;&quot;). The trail leads Batman to Calcutta, India. Since their knowledge of the city is limited, Oracle contacts Shiva, who agrees to help Batman. Together they defeat Ghul&#x27;s men and prevent the virus from being released.

Shiva later travels to an army base in Transbelvia to fight a young political rebel and martial artist named Dava Sbörsc, who specializes in undefeatable &quot;single-blow techniques&quot; and wishes to learn Shiva&#x27;s Leopard Blow. Instead, Dava&#x27;s friend, her former pupil Tim Drake, in his identity as Robin, jumps into the fray in her place. Granted superspeed by a drug Dava gave him, and unused to its effects, Robin unwittingly uses lethal force, killing Shiva in battle. He quickly administers CPR, both reviving Shiva and dosing her with the drug. Thus enhanced, she kills attacking soldiers while Robin and Dava make their escape, vanishing immediately after.

During the &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; story arc, Shiva fights in the Brotherhood of the Monkey Fist&#x27;s martial arts tournament under the alias &quot;Paper Monkey&quot;. In a final, close battle, she fights and defeats Connor Hawke, the Green Arrow. As repayment for saving her life, Robin asks her to spare Connor. She relents, warning Robin that this use of her favor means she would challenge and kill him when he grew older.

Over the years, Shiva amasses groups of followers who worship her as an incarnation of Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction. She pays them little attention, occasionally using them as lackeys or killing them when it suits her whims. Some of her followers have even created temples to honor her victories, one of which is in Gotham, which she later destroys.

===Shiva and Batgirl===
At age 8, Shiva&#x27;s daughter Cassandra flees from David Cain, horrified after killing a man with her bare hands on her first assassination. She then wanders the world as a mute, and, seeking redemption, finds herself in Gotham City during the events of No Man&#x27;s Land. Seeing promise in Cassandra, Batman and former Batgirl, Barbara Gordon, give Cassandra their blessings to take up the mantle of Batgirl.

Eventually, Batgirl&#x27;s skills attract Shiva&#x27;s attention. Without telling her of their relationship, Shiva challenges Batgirl to a battle to the death. To Shiva&#x27;s disappointment, she defeats Batgirl soundly. Batgirl&#x27;s body language fluency is newly impaired by a telepath&#x27;s forcible inculcation of the ability to speak. Wanting to fight Batgirl at her peak, Shiva spares her life, and promises to retrain her on the condition that they have a rematch in one year. The secret to being undefeatable, Shiva explains, is to not fear death, even to seek it. Under Shiva&#x27;s care, Batgirl soon regains her abilities.

Shiva reappears to fight Batgirl at the Forum of The Twelve Caesars, and kills her in combat. Realizing that Batgirl had not given her all, Shiva revives her. Batgirl admits to harboring a death wish ever since Cain first forced her to kill; her ability to perfectly read the agony of her victim had deeply traumatized her. Having overcome her death wish, Batgirl fights Shiva again, shattering her sword. In the midst of battle, Batgirl accuses Shiva of having a death wish herself, really only traveling and fighting in search of her own death. Batgirl thus defeats Shiva.

===A new Sensei===
In Gail Simone&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Birds of Prey&quot;&quot; series, during a joint hunt with Black Canary for the murderer of a shared, beloved sensei, a sensei Shiva so respected that she has vowed to never use anything he taught her in a fight where her goal was the death of her opponent, Shiva is beaten and kidnapped by supervillain Cheshire. Cheshire ties up, gags and locks Shiva in the trunk of a car wired with explosives, so as to use a charred corpse in a plan to fake her death and flee the country after murdering a senator. Shiva is saved when Catwoman discovers her. After Cheshire confesses to murdering their sensei, Black Canary punches her out of a helicopter (using Ted Grant&#x27;s Haymaker) to prevent Shiva from killing her in a vengeful rage. Shiva subsequently offers to share her knowledge with Black Canary, who takes her offer under consideration.

Cassandra begins to suspect that Shiva is her mother, but cannot provoke Cain into an admission. She embarks on a search for Shiva, eventually finding her as the new sensei of the League of Assassins under the leadership of Nyssa Raatko, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s eldest daughter. In battle, Cassandra sacrifices her life to save former League member Tigris from an attack by her own unsuccessful experimental predecessor, Mad Dog. Shiva decides to resurrect Cassandra in a Lazarus Pit to reveal the truth of her heritage, and fight her once more.

On reviving her, Shiva admits that the reason she agreed to give birth was that she hoped her child would be the one to kill her. In an evenly matched battle, Cassandra breaks Shiva&#x27;s neck, paralyzing her. She appears ready to place Shiva in the Lazarus Pit, but Shiva pleads with her not to do so. In response, Cassandra impales Shiva on a hook hanging over the pit, apparently killing her. Although Cassandra&#x27;s intent regarding this action is left ambiguous, whether to kill her or let her fall into the pit and be revived, it has been confirmed that Shiva is alive in &quot;One Year Later&quot;. Cassandra then abandons the identity of Batgirl and returns to her life as a wanderer.

During the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; storyline, Shiva later appears as a member of Alexander Luthor Jr.&#x27;s Secret Society of Super Villains.

===&quot;One Year Later&quot;===

In the 2006 &quot;One Year Later&quot; storyline, having switched places with Black Canary to allow them both to experience each other&#x27;s life experiences, Shiva joins Oracle&#x27;s covert team of female operatives known as the Birds of Prey (with Canary hoping that spending time with them would soften Shiva), using the name &quot;Jade Canary&quot;. Shiva remains unchanged, however. Oracle semiseriously refers to Shiva as a sociopath, and refuses to call Shiva by the Jade Canary title, even though Shiva (as part of the deal with Canary) has taken to wearing Black Canary&#x27;s boots and trademark fishnet stockings (though she hates wearing them).

Shiva continues to perform solo work, and visits Robin to assist him (much to Robin&#x27;s chagrin) in discovering the truth behind Batgirl&#x27;s recent disappearance and recent upheaval within the League of Assassins. She refuses to allow herself or Oracle&#x27;s team to be involved, and instead trusts her former pupil to handle the situation. It appears that she holds no ill-will towards Cassandra as she informs Tim that she hopes that her daughter is well.

During a recent mission, Oracle&#x27;s team confronts the villain Prometheus, whose helmet allows him to copy the skills of 30 of the world&#x27;s greatest martial artists, including Shiva herself. This had allowed him a victory against Batman in the past. Shiva believes that his files on her would be out of date, and that she would be able to defeat her &quot;old self&quot;. She seems unconcerned about the skills of the other 29 fighters, and apparently decides to attack Prometheus head-on. Prometheus, however, has more up-to-date files than Shiva suspected, and in three seconds knocks her to the ground. After this defeat, Shiva vanishes, leaving a message for Black Canary: &quot;Tell the Canary, I release her&quot;.

Stripped of her chance to mold Black Canary in her own image, and stripped of Sin, the young girl who was next in line as her successor, Shiva is last seen talking to Bethany Thorne, daughter of the Crime Doctor. It appears that she is yet again hoping to train a new heir in the art of her lethal form of martial arts.

Still, although Shiva is no longer an active member of the Birds of Prey, she continues to be protective of her former teammates. Such is the case when the Birds of Prey are being threatened by Spy Smasher, who attempts to steal control away from Oracle. After a mission in Russia, Oracle and Spy Smasher fight against one another for control of the team. Although Oracle is unable to use her legs, she is victorious, although Spy Smasher attempts to go back on their deal. Unfortunately, she is confronted outside by every single living Birds of Prey Agent Oracle has ever recruited, who warn her against ever going after Oracle again; Lady Shiva is among them. When Barbara later asks the others who called Shiva, no one responds.

===&quot;Blackest Night&quot;===
During the events of the &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Shiva tracks down Renee Montoya, the new Question, and tells her she intends to test her in battle. The two women begin their duel, only to be interrupted when Victor Sage, now a reanimated Black Lantern, arrives on the scene and attacks them. Using his new supernatural abilities, Sage effortlessly defeats Shiva and tries to kill her by tearing out her heart. However, Shiva realizes that the Black Lanterns feed on human emotion, and cuts herself off from all feeling through the use of meditation, rendering her invisible to Sage. After the others on the scene do the same, Victor angrily departs.

===&quot;Brightest Day&quot;===
During the events of the &quot;Brightest Day&quot; crossover, a new martial artist known as the White Canary comes to Gotham and sets a plan into motion to ruin Black Canary&#x27;s life by framing her for the murder of a European terrorist. When Black Canary first encounters the White Canary, she muses that the villain may be Shiva in disguise. but later White Canary pits Black Canary against Lady Shiva in an honor bound match to the death after breaking Black Canary&#x27;s wrist, thereby making sure she would be killed. Both parties accept because White Canary dangles the life of Sin, Black Canary&#x27;s adopted daughter, as her bait. However, Huntress challenges Shiva instead and even manages to knock her down, to everyone&#x27;s surprise, even after receiving many blows. The death match is stopped when Black Canary rescues Sin herself and points out a technicality, they need not continue the battle to the death immediately and can pick it up at any time in the future.

===The New 52===
In The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Lady Shiva appears in &quot;Nightwing&quot; (vol. 3) #0. While initially meant only to provide information, Dick Grayson enters the field against orders when Batman is wounded. He fights her in his debut as Robin with a costume composed of spare Bat costume parts. Lady Shiva easily defeats him but praises his fighting skills and tells him he has too much potential to stay in Batman&#x27;s shadow. Before leaving, Shiva tells Dick Grayson to come find her once he&#x27;s ready to unlock his full potential. 

In issue #13, she returns to Gotham City several years later to kill another target and Dick Grayson, now Nightwing, sets out to stop her. He&#x27;s surprised to see that she remembers him from their first encounter and even more so when she praises his progress since their last meeting. She repeats that he&#x27;s squandering his natural talent by not learning from her. Shiva completes her mission by throwing an axe at the S.E.C building door (to intimidate into initiating lockdown) but quickly realises that Nightwing was already injured before their fight. To Dick Grayson&#x27;s surprise she says that him fighting at a disadvantage shows more than he knows and that he has too much skill to kill without a concrete reason. It is later revealed that Penguin hired her AND told Nightwing about her mission in the hopes that either he&#x27;d be saved from paying Shiva&#x27;s high fees, or that she would kill Nightwing.

She is later revealed to be a League of Assassins member who taught Red Hood along with Bronze Tiger. She fights alongside Bronze Tiger, Cheshire, December Graystone, Rictus, and Red Hood as the Untitled infiltrated the League of Assassin&#x27;s secret city.

Instead of her traditional black coat, the New 52 version of Shiva has appeared in a teal kabuki-like garb and mask, and is shown to be a master of weapons and martial arts, going to battle with throwing knives, swords, and usually a pair of kusarigama. In full gear she appears to have an extremely long, auburn braid with blades embedded in the hair that can be used offensively, but this is merely a wig connected to her mask. With the hooded mask off, her hair is shown to be black, and while it appears cropped in one issue, it is medium length in following issues. The character December Greystone is extremely similar in appearance to Lady Shiva&#x27;s pre-New 52 look, but is a male and spell caster. 
In all of her appearances so far, she has soundly defeated nearly every opponent, including Batman, Nightwing, and Arsenal. But when she engages Red Hood, her own arrogance gets the better of her, as he is able to defeat her with a simple chop to the neck that she taught him long ago, as a way of balancing their sparring lessons because she believed he could never actually beat her without using &quot;shortcuts&quot;.

===DC Rebirth===

In &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, Shiva appears in the flesh at the end of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #950, observing Cassandra Cain from a rooftop. Batman later finds out from both Shiva herself and Ra&#x27;s that she has separated from him &amp; the League of Assassins, believing him to be too complacent with the wealthy and aiming for peace rather than destruction. She had taken Ra&#x27;s&#x27; secret League of Shadows with her, and was responsible for multiple attacks across the city and attacks on the anti-League military squad, the Colony. After a duel with her daughter Cassandra, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul appears and kills Shiva with the intent of later resurrecting her for questioning.

==Powers and abilities==
Lady Shiva has no superpowers, but she is regarded as one of the best assassins and martial artists on the planet. She is known to have mastered numerous martial arts, including kung fu, judo, jujutsu, wing chun, capoeira, savate, karate, aikido, kobudō, taekwondo and eskrima. She is able to read people&#x27;s movements through their body language, predicting their movements beforehand. She taught this trick to her daughter Cassandra Cain. She is able to hold her own against multiple opponents. She is commonly seen as the world&#x27;s foremost martial artist, as powerful as Richard Dragon and Batman. Batman, who is also considered to be one of the greatest martial artists, stated that &quot;she may well be the best fighter alive&quot;.

Although she is willing to kill, and on one occasion attempted to manipulate Batman into a position where he would have to kill to make a worthy opponent in the future, Shiva has shown a certain sense of honor, helping to train the third Robin in combat while working with him during an investigation, and assisting Batman in regaining his skills after he was injured by Bane and lost his fighting instinct even after his back was healed. She has also been noted as having some respect for her old teachers; when she and Black Canary learned that they had each studied under Sensei Otomo, Shiva noted that, out of respect for Otomo&#x27;s preference not to kill his opponents, she never uses the skills he taught her in fights where her goal is the death of her enemies.

<text>Ballenstedt is a town in the Harz district, in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt.

==Geography==
It is situated at the northern rim of the Harz mountain range, about 10 km (6 mi) southeast of Quedlinburg. The municipal area comprises the villages of Asmusstedt, Badeborn, Opperode, Radisleben, and Rieder. Ballenstedt is a stop on the scenic Romanesque Road.

==History==

The Saxon count Esico of Ballenstedt (c. 1000–1059/60) was mentioned in a 1030 entry in the medieval chronicles of the Annalista Saxo and in a 1036 deed issued by Emperor Conrad II. He was a son of one Count Adalbert, who held the office of a &quot;Vogt&quot; of Nienburg Abbey, and Hidda, a daughter of Margrave Odo I of the Saxon Ostmark. Esico, whose sister Uta married Margrave Eckard II of Meissen is considered the progenitor of the House of Ascania. He had a collegiate church erected in Ballenstedt, dedicated to Saints Pancras and Abundius, in the presence of Emperor Henry III in 1046.

Ballenstedt church was mentioned in a charter of 1073 by Henry IV in which the emperor confirmed to the church the possession of 21 &quot;mansi&quot; previously granted by his father Henry III. In 1123 Otto the Rich together with his son Albert the Bear, who would become the first ruler of Brandenburg, established a Benedictine monastery at the site. Albert and was buried at the crypt of the abbey church in 1070; a monument for him is located in the town&#x27;s park. Albert&#x27;s grandson Henry I became the first Prince of Anhalt in 1218.

In 1512 the citizens of Ballenstedt were vested with brewing rights by the Ascanian prince Wolfgang of Anhalt-Köthen. After Wolfgang met with Martin Luther at the 1521 Diet of Worms, he became one of the first Protestant rulers in the Holy Roman Empire. Ballenstedt Abbey was stormed and plundered during the German Peasants&#x27; War, whereafter Prince Wolfgang had the monastery secularised in 1525. He chose Ballenstedt as a residence and granted it town privileges in 1543. It received city walls in 1551; a town hall was first mentioned in 1582. As the Anhalt princes supported King Christian IV of Denmark during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Ballenstedt was raided and plundered by Imperial troops under Albrecht von Wallenstein in 1626.
After the war, the town and the former monastery were rebuilt as a Baroque summer residence by the Ascanian princes of Anhalt-Bernburg. In 1765 the enlightened prince Frederick Albert completely moved his residence from Bernburg to Ballenstedt Castle and induced a time of prosperity, including the erection of a castle theatre in 1788, the oldest theatre in Saxony-Anhalt and the domain of composers like Albert Lortzing and Franz Liszt.

A part of the re-unified Duchy of Anhalt from 1863 on, Ballenstedt became known as a residential town for the well-to-do retired like Princess Friederike of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, who died at Ballenstedt Castle in 1902, or the painter and author Wilhelm von Kügelgen, whose house is now a museum.

==Politics==
Seats in the municipal assembly () as of 2004 elections:
*Christian Democratic Union: 8 (41.2%)
*The Left: 4 (18.2%)
*Free Voters: 3 (12.6%)
*Free Democratic Party: 3 (12.5%)
*Social Democratic Party of Germany: 1 (7.5%)
*Independent: 1 (5.4%)

The coat of arms is derived from the insignia of the Counts of Ballenstedt, which is also the origin of the coat of arms of Saxony. It was first manifested in 1560 after Ballenstedt received town rights.

<text>Red pudding is a meat dish served mainly at chip shops in some areas of Scotland. Red pudding is associated with the east of Scotland, particularly Fife, but has become less common in recent years. Its main ingredients are beef, pork, pork rind or bacon, suet, rusk, wheat flour, spices, salt, beef fat and colouring.

The mixture is formed into a sausage shape of roughly eight inches in length, similar to black and white pudding and the chip shop variant of haggis. The pudding is usually cooked by being coated in a batter, deep fried, and served hot. Bought on its own, it is known as a &quot;single red&quot;; when accompanied by chips, it is known as a &quot;red pudding supper&quot;.

<doc id="1042179" wikidata="Q323890" url="?curid=1042179" title="Amiga (record label)">
<text>Amiga is a popular music record label in Germany. Once an organ of the East German state-owned music publisher VEB Deutsche Schallplatten, Amiga became a label of the Bertelsmann Music Group in 1994.

In 1947, actor and singer Ernst Busch got permission from the Soviet Military Administration in Germany to create a music publishing house, which was named Lied der Zeit GmbH (&quot;Song of the Times&quot;). This publishing company included the label Amiga. The label continued issues its singles in the 10&quot; 78 RPM format until 1960, and it began issuing singles in the 7&quot; 45 RPM format in 1957.

In the 1950s, Lied der Zeit became VEB Deutsche Schallplatten (&quot;German Records&quot;), a state-owned company with a monopoly on record production. VEB Deutsche Schallplatten had a number of labels, each with a different purview; Amiga releases included folk, jazz, pop, rock, Schlager music, chanson, and children&#x27;s music.

After the dissolution of the German Democratic Republic, most of the former East German public state enterprises were dismantled or sold to private investors. The Amiga label and catalog were acquired by Bertelsmann Music Group in 1994, which in turn was dissolved into Sony Music Entertainment in 2008.

Amiga&#x27;s catalog consists of 2,200 albums and about 5,000 singles, with a total of 30,000 titles.

<text>The Korean Educational Development Institute (KEDI) works for the South Korean Ministry of Education and Human Resource Development.
It conducts research in the field of educational goals and methods, creating policy solutions.

The KEDI was founded in 1972, and has since played a principal role in Korea&#x27;s emergence as an educationally advanced nation. Research and development projects conducted by KEDI assisted in the laying of the educational foundation during Korea&#x27;s national restoration period (1970s to 1990s). Through its diverse research efforts, KEDI provided guidelines as well as lent initiative to the quantitative and qualitative expansion of school education in Korea.

<doc id="1042191" wikidata="Q4999330" url="?curid=1042191" title="Burma Campaign UK">
<text>Burma Campaign UK (BCUK; ) founded in 1991 is a London-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) that aims to achieve the restoration of basic human rights and democracy in Burma (also known as Myanmar). BCUK campaigns on behalf of the Burmese pro-democracy movement and is the largest campaigning organisation for Burma in Europe. 

It does this by:
* Raising public awareness of issues in Burma
* Increasing international pressure on the UK government, the European Union, the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the United Nations to take action in any way.
* Helping to co-ordinate and build Burma campaign groups elsewhere, creating a global movement for democracy in Burma
* Providing support and training to Burmese exile organisations and individuals, empowering those who have fled the regime to educate others and raise awareness of the suffering in Burma

It has two directors, Anna Roberts and Mark Farmaner. Patrons include Glenys Kinnock, Baroness Helena Kennedy, Maureen Lipman, Roger Lyons, Clive James, Sinéad Cusack and Lord Steel. The organisation is funded by public donations. Burma Campaign UK receives no government funding.

==Reaction to the 2007 protests==
Following the 2007 Burmese anti-government protests Burma Campaign UK worked closely with international Burma Groups to help co-ordinate the Global Day of Action for Burma on 6 October 2007 through the &quot;Support The Monks&#x27; Protest In Burma&quot; group on Facebook.com, when thousands of people demonstrated in over 25 countries across five continents.

==Achievements==
By working with other groups around the world Burma Campaign UK has:
* Persuaded the United Nations Security Council to place Burma on its permanent agenda 
* Successfully lobbied the European Union to increase targeted sanctions against Burma 
* Encouraged more than 100 companies to end their involvement in Burma, including: DHL, Swiss Re, Aon Corporation, Rolls-Royce, British American Tobacco, and Premier Oil

==Campaigns==
* Free Aung San Suu Kyi:
This is linked with another aim of BCUK to free all political prisoners. BCUK set up a petition to be sent to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to make the release of political prisoners in Burma his personal priority.
* Crises in eastern Burma:
The government&#x27;s repression of individuals and communities residing in eastern Burma has been deemed as ethnic cleansing by BCUK. BCUK also highlights the issues of forced labour in the region and displacement, as 66,000 people have been forced to leave their homes during the past 12 months. Rape is used as a weapon against women and disease is most densely concentrated on Burma&#x27;s borders, as the regime blocks aid from these communities. Information from numerous sources including the Karen Women&#x27;s Organisation and Karen Human Rights Group can be found on the BCUK website. BCUK is also pushing for a UN arms embargo against the regime.
* United Nation&#x27;s Security Council:
Following a report published in 2005 by Václav Havel and Desmond Tutu that showed that Burma fits the criteria for United Nations Security Council (UNSC) intervention. BCUK calls on UNSC members to pass a resolution requiring the regime to work with the United Nations in restoring democracy to Burma, and to release Aung San Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners.
* Aid to Burma:
Burma is one of the most impoverished nations on the planet. The militant regime spends half of its budget on the military and less than $1 per person, per year on education and health care. BCUK is urging the Department For International Development (DFID) to take a more active role in alleviating the immediate suffering and to support the democratic movement.
* Economic sanctions:
BCUK has campaigned for targeted sanctions against the regime for many years. These sanctions are designed to pressure the regime to enter into dialogue with the democracy movement. In 2007 they claimed victory as the European Union imposed new sanctions against the regime. BCUK is now calling for targeted financial sanctions to be imposed against Burma by both the UK and EU. BCUK revealed that in 2008 the number of companies with links to Burma had actually increased.
* Insurance campaign:
Insurance companies from all over the world, including ones from countries with economic sanctions against the regime, help to insure foreign companies in Burma that provide vital income to the regime. Money made from these foreign companies will not go to the starving people, it will be used to fund the military machine that oppresses the people. BCUK advocates, among other aims, that the EU issue a ban on the provision of insurance services from member states to companies inside Burma. Due to pressure from BCUK certain companies have been forced to respond.
* Total Oil:
The French oil company Total began constructing the Yadana gas project in 1992 in partnership with Unocal and the state-owned Myanmar Oil. This joint venture earns the military regime hundreds of millions of dollars every year. BCUK launched an international campaign against the oil company supported by 41 organisations in 18 countries. In September 2007 the French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner stated that he favoured TOTAL pulling out of the country.

==Celebrity support==
Burma Campaign UK supporters include Damien Rice, Annie Lennox, Maxi Jazz, Emma Thompson, Anna Friel, Tony Robinson, Maureen Lipman, Jay Kay, Joanna Lumley, Esther Rantzen, Kabir Bedi, Sir Ian McKellen and Gillian Anderson.

Local industries include fishing, furniture making and tourism. In 2020 it absorbed the former of Monteciccardo, now a of Pesaro. Its of Fiorenzuola di Focara is one of (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;).

==History==
The city was established as &quot;Pisaurum&quot; by the Romans in 184 BC as a colony in the territory of the Picentes, the people who lived along the northeast coast during the Iron Age. In 1737, fourteen ancient votive stones were unearthed in a local farm field, each bearing the inscription of a Roman god; these were written in a pre-Etruscan script, indicating a much earlier occupation of the area than the 184 BC Picentes colony.

A settlement of the Picentes tribe has been found at Novilara. The northern Picentes were invaded in the 4th century BC by the Gallic Senones, earlier by the Etruscans, and when the Romans reached the area the population was an ethnic mixture. The Roman separated and expelled the Gauls from the country.

Under the Roman administration Pesaro, a hub across the Via Flaminia, became an important centre of trading and craftmanship. After the fall of the Western Empire, Pesaro was occupied by the Ostrogoths, and destroyed by Vitigis (539) in the course of the Gothic War. Hastily rebuilt five years later after the Byzantine reconquest, it formed the so-called Pentapolis, part of the Exarchate of Ravenna. After the Lombard and Frankish conquests of that city, Pesaro became part of the Papal States.

During the Renaissance it was ruled successively by the houses of Montefeltro (1285–1445), Sforza (1445–1512) and Della Rovere (1513–1631). Under the last family, who selected it as capital of their duchy, Pesaro saw its most flourishing age, with the construction of numerous public and private palaces, and the erection of a new line of walls (the Mura Roveresche). In 1475, a legendary wedding took place in Pesaro, when Costanzo Sforza and Camilla d&#x27;Aragona married.

On 11 September 1860 Piedmontese troops entered the city, and after the their win over the Papal States at the Battle of Castelfidardo 8 days later, Pesaro was subsequently annexed to the new Kingdom of Italy along with the entire Marche (and Umbria) regions.

Pesaro was significantly damaged in the 1916 Rimini earthquakes. Its historic centre was abandoned after the 16 August earthquake, leaving 14,000 displaced people crowded into 2,000 tents. Many villages in its hinterland also suffered collapsed buildings.

<text>Galaxy Press (formerly Author Services) represents the literary, theatrical and musical works of the late Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, and publishes Hubbard&#x27;s fiction works and the anthologies of the Writers of the Future contest.

== History ==

During the Church of Scientology&#x27;s &quot;corporate sort out&quot; project in the early 1980s, Bridge Publications, Inc. (later renamed to Bridge Publications Incorporated) and Author Services, Inc. (ASI) were both incorporated. Bridge Publications was to be the publisher of the Scientology works as a non-profit corporation, and Author Services was to be the publisher of Hubbard&#x27;s fiction works as a for-profit corporation. ASI was incorporated in the state of California on October 13, 1981, and was wholly owned by the Church of Spiritual Technology by 1993. In 2015, ASI was merged into Galaxy Press, LLC, which was then renamed to Galaxy Press, Inc. 

== Activities ==

Since its incorporation in 1981, ASI managed L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s personal, business and literary affairs. After Hubbard&#x27;s death in 1986, ASI continued to represent his literary and musical works worldwide. Nineteen of Hubbard&#x27;s books have been on &quot;The New York Times&quot; best sellers list, and his works have been translated into 72 languages.

ASI has administered the Writers and Illustrators of the Future contest. The contest had been established and sponsored by Hubbard in 1983.

In 2005, ASI received a verification certificate from Guinness World Records on behalf of Hubbard for being the &quot;most translated author&quot; in the world (since surpassed in 2014 by Paulo Coelho.)

While ASI presents Hubbard&#x27;s fiction and secular works under the Galaxy Press label, his Scientology-related writings are represented by Bridge Publications (New Era Publications outside North America).

The 200-seat Author Services (ASI) Theater reopened in October 2008 after a three-year hiatus to resume its live presentations of L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s original series of pulp fiction classic tales penned during the 1930s and 1940s and recently adapted into multi-cast audio performances.

In 2008, they announced they would be releasing eighty volumes containing the works Hubbard wrote for pulp magazines, at the rate of four titles every four or five months. The release was scheduled to be accompanied by a $1.9 million marketing campaign, including commercials on programs popular with middle school children.

<text>The Selke Valley Railway (&quot;Selketalbahn&quot;), &quot;Gernrode-Harzgerode Railway&quot; (&quot;Gernroder-Harzgeroder Eisenbahn&quot;) and the &quot;Anhalt Harz Railway&quot; (&quot;Anhaltische Harzbahn&quot;) were different names for the metre gauge railway in the Lower Harz, Germany, originally owned by the Gernrode-Harzgerode Railway Company (&quot;Gernrode-Harzgeroder Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft&quot;, GHE).

It is now only known as the &quot;Selke Valley Railway&quot;. This has included the Quedlinburg–Gernrode line since 2006. It continues through Alexisbad to Hasselfelde and includes the Alexisbad–Harzgerode branch and the Stiege–Eisfelder Talmühle connecting line. All of them are now owned by the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways &quot;(Harzer Schmalspurbahnen&quot;). The line follows the Selke river between Mägdesprung and Albrechtshaus.

==History==
=== Opening and early years ===
The Gernrode–Mägdesprung railway was opened by the Gernrode-Harzgerode Railway Company (&quot;Gernrode-Harzgeroder Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft&quot;, GHE) after a construction period of 316 days on 7 August 1887. The Selke Valley Railway is the oldest narrow gauge railway in the Harz Mountains. Because of the terrain conditions and for cost reasons, &quot;Localbahn-Bau und Betriebs-Gesellschaft Wilhelm Hostmann &amp; Co.&quot; from Hanover was awarded the contract to build the 1000 mm gauge railway. Services were initially hauled by three powerful steam locomotives called &quot;Gernerode&quot;, &quot;Harzgerode&quot; and &quot;Selke&quot;. The line was extended in stages to Hasselfelde by 1892. After the opening of the Stiege–Eisfelder Talmühle railway by the Nordhausen-Wernigerode Railway Company (&quot;Nordhausen-Wernigeroder Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft&quot;, NWE) on 15 July 1905, a connection existed to the Harz Railway (&quot;Harzquerbahn&quot;). Because of the increased demand for both passenger and freight traffic, three more steam locomotives had been put into service by the turn of the century, the &quot;Güntersberge&quot;, the &quot;Alexisbad&quot; and the &quot;Hasselfelde&quot;.

=== Developments after the Second World War ===

In the spring of 1946, the Eisfelder Talmühle–Hasselfelde and Herzogschacht–Lindenberg sections of the Selke Valley Railway were dismantled and almost all the rolling stock and track material was sent as reparations to the former Soviet Union. The operational management between Efelder Talmühle and Hasselfelde was transferred to the NWE from 15 April 1946.

Because of its importance for the transport of fluorite, reconstruction began in the autumn of 1946 between Gernrode and Lindenberg (now Straßberg), which dragged on because of lack of material until 1950. The Lindenberg–Stiege section was not initially rebuilt. The GHE was nationalised in 1946 and it was absorbed by Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR) on 1 April 1949.

In 1983, the reconstruction of the Straßberg–Stiege section was approved, especially to ensure the supply of lignite from Nordhausen to the new cogeneration plant of Silberhütte. Scheduled passenger services between Hasselfelde and Gernrode were resumed on 3 June 1984. Since then, the three Harz narrow gauge lines (Selke Valley Railway, Harz Railway and Brocken Railway—Brockenbahn) have again been connected as one network, now 140 kilometres-long. On 1 February 1993, the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways (&quot;Harzer Schmalspurbahnen GmbH&quot;, HSB) took over the Harz Railway, the Brocken Railway and the Selke Valley Railway from DR.

=== The extension to Quedlinburg ===

Rail traffic on the standard gauge Quedlinburg–Gernrode–Ballenstedt–Frose railway ended in Gernrode after a signal box fire in Ballenstedt. Deutsche Bahn saw itself as no longer able to operate the line economically and the Gernrode–Frose section was closed. The Harz Narrow Gauge Railways took over the Quedlinburg–Gernrode section and began the conversion of the around 8.5 kilometres-long section of the Selke Valley Railway to Quedlinburg to metre gauge on 18 April 2005. The railway supervisory authority of Saxony-Anhalt approved operations over the line on 17 February 2006 and it was opened on 4 March with festivities and special trains. Since various remaining works had to be carried out, only a few special trains operated until the start of scheduled passenger traffic on 26 June 2006. The 2017 timetable shows six pairs of trains a day between Gernrode and Quedlinburg, two of which are hauled by locomotives.

== Route ==


From Quedlinburg, the Selke Valley Railway runs for a few kilometres parallel with the standard gauge line to Thale until the newly-laid narrow gauge track turns to the south. This is followed by the stations of Quedlinburg-Quarmbeck and Bad Suderode (both reopened in 2006), before Gernrode station is reached. Now the old route of the Magdeburg–Halberstadt Railway Company branched off towards Frose and the line continues along the original Selke Valley Railway. The line runs past the halt (&quot;Haltepunkt&quot;) of Osterteich, next to the artificial pond of the same name, and through the Ostergrund. Past the &quot;Heiliger Teich&quot; (&quot;holy pond&quot;, an artificial pond, which was built on the site of a pond that was believed in the Middle Ages to have health-giving properties) the line climbs through Sternhaus-Haferfeld station and continues to Sternhaus-Ramberg station. Like the previous one, this is located in the middle of a forest. After Sternhaus-Ramberg station, the line descends into the valley of the Selke. This section is the steepest in the entire network of Harz narrow gauge railways. The narrow valley of the Selke is reached by Mägdesprung station. The line now follows the course of the river to Alexisbad. The numerous rock cuttings that the railway must pass through demonstrate the difficulty of engineering the line. After passing the small halt of Drahtzug, the line reaches the village of Alexisbad. Alexisbad station, which is also the starting point of the branch to Harzgerode, lies at the end of the small town. Subsequently, the branch line climbs out of the narrow valley of the Selke onto the plateau of Harzgerode. The first section of the Selke Valley Railway ended at Harzgerode station.

From Alexisbad station, which is known for its simultaneous departures of two steam locomotives, the second line of the Selke Valley Railway continues through the Selke Valley towards Stiege, firstly to Silberhütte. Passing small factories, the line continues its journey via Straßberg, which has a halt as well as its main station, and continues to Güntersberge. After Güntersberge, the railway continues to climb, passing through Friedrichshöhe and Albrechtshaus stations to Stiege station. Since 1905, the connection to the Harz Railway has branched off here. This short line, the second section of the GHE, ends in Hasselfelde, also on a high plateau.

The connecting line to the Harz Railway runs from Stiege station up to the highest point at 523 metres above sea level near the halt of Birkenmoor and then downhill through the Bere valley. In the Bere valley, which is surrounded by high ranges, the railway crosses two side valleys on two large bridges, before reaching the Harz Railway and Eisfelder Talmühle station.

== Rail operations ==
=== Passenger services ===

The route is used daily by steam trains and railcars. According to the summer and winter timetable, there are five daily services in both directions over the whole route, some with changes in Alexisbad and Stiege, as well as on the side branches to Harzgerode and Hasselfelde (2016/2017 timetable). Other trains run between Quedlinburg or Gernrode and Alexisbad. The number of pairs of trains operated by steam trains or diesel railcars is approximately the same in the summer timetable, with railcars predominating in the winter half-year. Although the Selke Valley Railway has some importance for regional traffic on the Quedlinburg–Gernrode section, the passengers on the other sections of the line are mostly tourists, people on excursions and hikers.

Since April 2010, steam trains have also run regularly on the connecting line (Stiege–Eisfelder Talmühle); before 1996 it was exclusively served by diesel multiple units. Depending on the timetable, there may be simultaneous departures from Eisfelder Talmühle, Stiege and Alexisbad.

=== Freight ===

Today, scheduled freight trains operate on the Selke Valley Railway only on the short section from the &quot;Hartsteinwerk Unterberg&quot; to Eisfelder Talmühle station: the Hartsteinwerk Unterberg regularly transports standard gauge gravel wagons on Rollbocks to the transfer yard in Nordhausen (Harz Railway). There are two converted diesel locomotives of class 199.8 available and equipment for transporting standard gauge freight cars.

=== Rolling stock ===

In Gernrode and Nordhausen Nord are the locomotive depots for the Selke Valley Railway. The diesel railcars of the Selke Valley Railway are based in Nordhausen Nord. Both locomotives and motor coaches are serviced and the steam locomotives are fueled and cleaned.

The rolling stock of the Selke Valley Railway, like all HSB rolling stock, are maintained in Wernigerode-Westerntor. This is the location of the HSB&#x27;s central rolling stock depot, where all examinations and repair work are performed on all rolling stock. For the main examinations, however, the locomotives are taken to special maintenance facilities.

== Peculiarities ==

Compared to the Harz Railway and the Brocken Railway, the Selke Valley Railway has some special features:

* The stretch out of the northern edge of the Harz is a very varied landscape up to the high levels of the middle Harz mountains.
* While on the Wernigerode–Brocken railway in normal traffic steam locomotives of DR classes 99.23–24 are used in particular, one-of-a-kind steam engines are used on the Selke Valley Railway (99 6101 and 6102, 99 6001 and 99 5906).
*The Selke Valley Railway traverses a slope of 1:25 (4%), which is the steepest track used in the Harz mountains. The Brocken Railway traverses more elevation but does so at a shallower gradient of 1:30 (3.333%).
*Stiege Station has the smallest terminal loop of any public railway. This is a balloon loop which was constructed specifically to allow heavy trains to the power station at Silberhutte from Nordhausen to continue in the direction of Silberhutte without reversing.

<doc id="1042203" wikidata="Q5368994" url="?curid=1042203" title="Jewish emancipation in the United Kingdom">
<text>Jewish emancipation in the United Kingdom was the culmination in the 19th century of efforts over several hundred years to loosen the legal restrictions set in place on England&#x27;s Jewish population. Between 1833 and 1890 Parliament passed a series of laws that placed male Jews in the United Kingdom on an equal legal footing with the kingdom&#x27;s other emancipated males.

==Background==
When in 1829 the Roman Catholics of the United Kingdom were freed from all their civil disabilities, the hopes of the Jews rose high; and the first step toward a similar alleviation in their case was taken in 1830 when William Huskisson presented a petition signed by 2,000 merchants and others of Liverpool. This was immediately followed by a bill presented by Robert Grant in 1830 which was destined to engage the British legislature in one form or another for the next thirty years. Thomas Macaulay, later a well-known and influential historian, was elected to Parliament in 1830 and – among other issues he took up – distinguished himself by attacking the exclusion of Jews.

At first the bill failed to get through the House of Commons. Against the opposition of Sir Robert Inglis, the first reading was passed by 115 to 97 votes. But the second reading, on 17 May, notwithstanding a sizable petition in its favour from 14,000 citizens of London, was rejected by 265 to 228 votes. The next year, 1833, however, it passed its third reading in the Commons on 22 July by a majority of 189 to 52, and was read for the first time in the Lords. On the second reading in the Lords on 1 August it was rejected by 104 to 54, with the Duke of Wellington speaking and voting against the Bill, though the Duke of Sussex, a constant friend to the Jews, presented a petition in its favour signed by 1,000 distinguished citizens of Westminster. The same thing happened in 1834, the bill being lost in the House of Lords by a majority of 92 votes. The whole force of the Tory Party and the personal antagonism of King William IV was against the bill. In the following year it was deemed inadvisable to make the annual appeal to Parliament, as the battle for religious liberty was going on in another part of the field; but by the passing of the Sheriffs&#x27; Declaration Act to hold the ancient and important office of sheriff. In the following year the Jew Bill was introduced late in the session, and succeeded in passing its first reading in the Lords on 19 August but was then dropped owing to the lateness of the session.

==Membership of Parliament==
Sir Sampson Gideon, who had a Jewish father and Christian mother, was a baronet, member of parliament and Irish peer in the eighteenth century. The economist and financier David Ricardo was born into a family of Sephardic Jews but converted to Unitarianism aged 21 and was a member of parliament from 1819 to 1823. Benjamin Disraeli, who was born Jewish and baptized aged 12 into the Church of England, was a member of parliament from 1837, served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1852, 1858–1859 and 1867–1868 Conservative governments. He went on to become, in 1868 and again in 1874, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He was elevated to the House of Lords in 1876. His willingness to take Christian oaths meant there were no barriers to his political career; for Jews who had not converted to Christianity the oath remained the key obstacle. The oath of office included the words &quot;and I make this Declaration upon the true Faith of a Christian&quot;.

For a time the advocates of Jewish emancipation seemed to have lost heart. The chief supporters of the bill were Robert Grant in the Commons and Lord Holland in the Lords, dying in 1838 and 1840 respectively. During the four years following Holland&#x27;s death, the political activity of the English Jews was concentrated on the attempt to obtain admission to municipal office. A bill to that effect got as far as a first reading in the Lords by one vote, in 1841, but was lost on a second reading. It was not until 31 July 1845 that the bill was carried. On 18 August 1846, the Religious Opinions Relief Act removed some of minor disabilities that affected British Jews and dissenters from the Established Church; the only state office that still remained closed to Jews was Parliament.

The success with which British Jews had induced Parliament to admit them to the shrievalty and to municipal offices had been because Jews had been actual candidates, and had been elected to those offices before any parliamentary relief was asked. It was now decided to adopt the same policy in regard to a seat in Parliament itself.

A Jewish candidate, Lionel de Rothschild, was elected as one of the four members of Parliament for the City of London in 1847 but could not take his seat without taking a Christian oath of office, and the bill that was introduced on 16 December that year was intended to carry out the wishes of a definite English constituency. This passed its third reading in the Commons on 4 May 1848, by a majority of 62 votes, but was rejected in the Lords by 163 non-contents to 128 contents. The same thing happened in 1849 when Lionel de Rothschild was again elected, but in the following year the struggle took on another and more dramatic form.

David Salomons, who had successfully fought the battle for the shrievalty and the aldermanic chair, had been elected member for Greenwich and insisted on taking his seat, refusing to withdraw on being ordered to do so by the speaker, and adding to his offence by voting in the division on the motion for adjournment which was made to still the uproar caused by his bold course of action. The prime minister, Lord John Russell, moved that Salomons be ordered to withdraw, and on that motion Salomons spoke in a dignified and forcible manner, and won the sympathy of the House, which nevertheless passed the Prime Minister&#x27;s motion. The matter was then referred to the law courts, which decided that Salomons had no right to vote without having taken the oath of abjuration in the form appointed by Parliament, and fined him £500 for each vote he had recorded in the Commons. The government then brought in another bill in 1853, which was also rejected by the Lords. In 1855, Salomons was elected Lord Mayor of London.

In the following two years, bills were introduced by the government to modify the parliamentary oath, but they failed to obtain the assent of the Lords. In 1858 when the Oath Bill reached the Lords they eliminated the clause relating to Jews; but when the bill was referred again to the Commons, the lower house refused to accept it as amended, and appointed a committee to formulate its reasons, upon which committee, as if to show the absurdity of the situation, the member for the City of London, Lionel de Rothschild, was appointed to serve, something which he could legally do, even though he had not taken his seat. A conference was appointed between the two houses, and ultimately a compromise was reached with the passage of the Jews Relief Act 1858 by which either house might admit Jews by resolution, allowing them to omit the words &quot;on the true faith of a Christian&quot;.

As a consequence, on Monday, 26 July 1858, Lionel de Rothschild took the oath with covered head, substituting &quot;so help me, Jehovah&quot; for the ordinary form of oath, and thereupon took his seat as the first Jewish member of Parliament; David Salomons was re-elected for Greenwich in a by-election and took his seat in early 1859. Two years later a more general form of oath for all members of Parliament was introduced, which freed the Jews from all cause of exclusion.

==Reforms and political freedoms==
The Reform Act 1867 granted every adult male householder the right to vote. In 1871, in the wake of the case of Numa Edward Hartog, the Universities Tests Act removed the difficulties in the way of a Jew becoming a scholar or a fellow in an English university. In 1885, Sir Nathaniel de Rothschild was raised to the upper house as Lord Rothschild, the first Jewish Lord. In 1876 Disraeli was made Earl of Beaconsfield. They were followed within a few years by Henry de Worms as Lord Pirbright and Sydney Stern as Lord Wandsworth. In 1890 all restrictions for every position in the British Empire were removed being thrown open to every British citizen without distinction of creed, except for that of monarch and the offices of Lord High Chancellor and of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

For some time after their admission to Parliament, the Jewish MPs belonged to the party that had given them that privilege, the Liberal Party, and Sir George Jessel acted as solicitor-general in William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s first ministry. But from the time of the Conservative reaction in 1874 Jewish voters and candidates showed an increasing tendency toward the Conservatives. The influence of Benjamin Disraeli may have had some effect on this change, but it was in the main due to the altered politics of the middle and commercial classes, to which the Jews chiefly belonged. Baron Henry de Worms acted as under Secretary of State in one of Lord Salisbury&#x27;s ministries, while Sir Julian Goldsmid, a Liberal Unionist after the Home Rule policy of Gladstone was declared, made a marked impression as Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons.

Altogether the struggle had lasted for sixty years; nearly all that was contended for had been gained in half that period, but complete equality was not granted to Roman Catholics and Jews until 1890. The many political friendships made during the process had facilitated social intercourse.

==Communal organisations and disunity==
The pause which occurred between 1840 and 1847 in the emancipation struggle was due in large measure to a schism, which at the time seemed unfortunate, which had split the Jewish community in two and which prevented the members acting in unison for the defence of their rights. The Reform movement had reached England in a mild form under the influence of the Goldsmid family, which had been touched by the Mendelssohnian movement. In 1841 a Reform congregation was established in London, and was practically excommunicated by both the Spanish haham and the German chief rabbi. The effect of these differences was to delay common action as regards emancipation and other affairs; and it was not until 1859 that the charity organisation was put on a firm footing by the creation of the Jewish Board of Guardians. Ten years later the congregations were brought under one rule by the formation of the United Synagogue (1870), in the charter of which an attempt was made to give the Chief Rabbi autocratic powers over the doctrines to be taught in the Jewish communities throughout the British Empire. But Parliament, which had recently disestablished the Irish Church, did not feel disposed to establish the Jewish Synagogue, and the clause was stricken out. The chief rabbi&#x27;s salary is paid partly out of contributions from the provincial synagogues, and this gives him a certain amount of authority over all the Jews of the empire with the exception of the 3,000 or more Sephardim, who have a separate haham, and of the dwindling band of Reformers, who number about 2,000, scattered in London, Manchester, and Bradford. In 1871 the Anglo-Jewish Association was established to take the place, so far as regards the British empire, of the Alliance Israélite, which had been weakened by the Franco-German war. The Jews of England felt that they should be organised to take their proper part in Jewish affairs in general. For many years they, together with the French Jews, were the only members of the religion who were unhampered by disabilities; and this enabled them to act more freely in cases where the whole body of Israel was concerned.

==Fighting blood libels==
As early as 1840, when the blood accusation was revived with regard to the Damascus affair, and Jewish matters were for the first time treated on an international basis, the Jews of England took by far the most prominent position in the general protest of the European Jewries against the charge. Not only was the Board of Deputies at London the sole Jewish body in Europe to hold public meetings, but owing to their influence a meeting of protest was held by eminent Christians at the Mansion House, London (3 July 1840), which formed a precedent for subsequent distinguished gatherings. Sir Moses Montefiore, after aiding the Damascus Jews by obtaining, in an interview with the Sultan at Constantinople, a firman repudiating the blood accusation, visited Russia in 1846 to intercede for his coreligionists there. In 1860 he went to Rome in connection with the Mortara affair; and in 1863 he led a mission to Morocco on behalf of Jews of that country. Action was likewise taken by the chief English Jews in behalf of the unfortunate Hebrews of the Danubian principalities. Francis Goldsmid made an interpellation in the House of Commons with regard to the Jews of Serbia (29 March 1867), and started a debate in that assembly (19 April 1872) on the subject of the persecutions of the Jews in Romania. As a consequence a Romanian committee was formed, which watched the activities of the illiberal government of that country.

==Pogroms in Russia==
When in 1881 the outburst of violence in Russia brought the position of the Russian Jews prominently before the world, it was their coreligionists in England who took the lead in organising measures for their relief. Articles in &quot;The Times&quot; of 11 and 13 January 1882, drew the attention of the whole world to the extent of the persecutions, and a meeting of the most prominent citizens of London was held at the Mansion House on 1 February 1882 (see Mansion House Meeting). As a consequence a fund was raised amounting to more than £108,000, and a complete scheme of distributing in the United States the Russian refugees from Brody was organised by the committee of the Mansion House Fund. Similarly, when a revival of the persecutions took place in 1891, another meeting was held at the Guildhall, and a further sum of over £100,000 was collected and devoted to facilitating the westward movement of the Russian exodus. An attempt was made this time to obtain access directly to the czar by the delivery of a petition from the lord mayor and citizens of London; but this was contemptuously rejected, and the Russo-Jewish committee which carried out the work of the Mansion House Fund was obliged to confine its activity to measures outside Russia. When Maurice de Hirsch formed his elaborate scheme for the amelioration of the condition of the persecuted Jews, headquarters were established by him in London, though the administration was practically directed from Paris. The immigrants being excluded from most of the cities of the Continent, the burden of receiving most of the Russian refugees moving westward fell on England, as well as America.

===Result of the Russian exodus===
The advent of such a large number of Jews, unprovided with capital, and often without a definite occupation, brought with it difficulties. It was only natural that the newcomers should arouse a certain amount of prejudice by their foreign habits, by the economic pressure they brought to bear upon certain trades, especially on that of clothing, and by their overcrowding in certain localities. While the Continent had seen the rise of strong anti-Semitic feeling, England had been comparatively free from any exhibition of this kind. During Lord Beaconsfield&#x27;s ministry, a few murmurs had been heard from the more advanced Liberals against the &quot;Semitic&quot; tendencies of the prime minister and his brethren in the race, but as a rule social had followed political emancipation almost automatically. The Russian influx threatened to disturb this natural process, and soon after 1891 protests began to be heard against the alien immigrants. Bills were even introduced into Parliament to check their entry into England. Nothing came of these protests, however, till the year 1902, when the question had reached such a point that it was deemed desirable to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the whole subject. The commission heard evidence both from those favouring and from those opposed to restricted immigration. Reports were made to the House of Commons that the arrival, in the East End of London, of Eastern European Jews, had brought smallpox and scarlet fever. The evidence, however, does not appear to have supported these accusations.

On graduation, in 1992, Kepcher secured a position as sales and marketing director of a golf club outside New York City. Her primary responsibility was to prepare the property for bank auction, where it was eventually sold to Donald Trump. Kepcher&#x27;s ideas on how best to use the property impressed him, and he hired her as director of sales and marketing in 1994.

===Trump: 1992–2006===
After four years in this capacity, she was named general manager. Her effective management skills convinced Trump of her ability to lead and he later named her the chief operating officer of Trump National Golf Club Westchester in Briarcliff Manor, New York, and subsequently the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, overseeing over 250 employees at each location.

In 2004, she wrote a business book, &quot;Carolyn 101: Business Lessons From the Apprentice&#x27;s Straight Shooter&quot; () based on her business experience. The book went to No. 2 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller List.

On August 31, 2006, Kepcher&#x27;s employment at the Trump Organization ended. According to sources who spoke to the &quot;New York Post&quot;, Trump felt that Kepcher&#x27;s newfound celebrity status had kept her too busy with speaking engagements and endorsements to focus on her responsibilities for the Trump Organization. Kepcher was replaced on &quot;The Apprentice&quot; by Ivanka Trump, beginning with Season 6.

===Post-Trump===
Kepcher became co-founder and CEO of Carolyn &amp; Co., a company created for the purpose of &quot;providing a broad array of services and assistance to career women.&quot;

On November 28, 2006, Kepcher was hired by Microsoft to star in a new reality show, &quot;Ultimate Challenge&quot;, to find the next best small-business venture. She was to be one of three judges. The contest winner would get $100,000 in seed money, a storefront or other business space in Manhattan rent-free for a year, and software to help get their business started. The pilot show was never completed.

In January 2007, Kepcher provided management skills to the nonprofit world through an affiliation with Graham-Pelton Consulting, Inc., a national leader in fundraising and nonprofit management. Since 2007, she has been a career advice columnist with the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;.

In 2010, Kepcher was the recipient of the prestigious Toastmasters International Golden Gavel award for Excellence in Communications and Leadership. Kepcher was also the winner of the Stevie Award for Women in Business in the category of &quot;Women Helping Women&quot;.

Kepcher is also one of the few non-cast members of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on NBC to recite the show&#x27;s opening line &quot;Live from New York, it&#x27;s Saturday Night!&quot;

Kepcher served on the board of the Back9Network, and on the Advisory board to the 2009 U.S. Women&#x27;s Open at Saucon Valley Country Club. She served as vice president and general manager of the Aspetuck Valley Country Club.

<text>Another Sunny Day was an indie pop solo project of Harvey Williams, signed to Sarah Records. Williams later recorded two albums under his own name.

==History==
The band was a solo project for Harvey Williams (born in Newlyn, Cornwall), started while studying at Plymouth Polytechnic in 1986. Williams graduated and then pursued a career in music. Williams signed a deal with Sarah Records and the first Another Sunny Day release was the &quot;Anorak City&quot; flexi-disc in April 1988, which came with the &quot;Are You Scared To Get Happy?&quot; fanzine, and was named &#x27;Single of the Week&#x27; by &quot;NME&quot;. The debut single proper was &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with a Girl Who Doesn&#x27;t Know I Exist&quot;, released two months later, which was again named &#x27;Single of the Week&#x27;. Williams relocated to London in early 1989. The next release was in May 1989 – the &quot;What&#x27;s Happened?&quot; single, followed later that year by &quot;You Should All Be Murdered&quot; and a limited 7-inch single on Bob Stanley&#x27;s Caff label, with a cover version of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark&#x27;s &quot;Genetic Engineering&quot;. While Williams recorded alone, he was joined by friends including Bobby Wratten, Michael Hiscock and Matthew Drummond for live shows. A couple more singles preceded the only Another Sunny Day album, &quot;London Weekend&quot;. Williams then joined Blueboy, before recording under his own name, releasing one album on Sarah and one on Shinkansen Records, and later went on to collaborate on several records by other groups including The Field Mice (for whom he became a permanent member) and The Hit Parade. Harvey Williams was working at the BBC in 2002, while also a member of Trembling Blue Stars.

Cherry Red Records re-issued the &quot;London Weekend&quot; album in August 2009; This release included six additional tracks: &quot;Genetic Engineering&quot;, &quot;Kilburn Towers&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s OK If You Don&#x27;t Love Me&quot;, &quot;The Boy From St Ives&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m In Love With a Girl Who Doesn&#x27;t Know I Exist&quot; (four-track version), &quot;Things Will Be Nice&quot; (four-track version).

<doc id="1042209" wikidata="Q951834" url="?curid=1042209" title="Who Are You">
<text>Who Are You is the eighth studio album by the English rock band the Who, released on 18 August 1978 by Polydor Records in the United Kingdom and on 21 August 1978 by MCA Records in the United States. Although the album received mixed reviews from critics, it was a commercial success, peaking at number 2 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and number 6 on the UK Albums Chart.

&quot;Who Are You&quot; was the Who&#x27;s final studio album to feature Keith Moon as their drummer. He tragically died three weeks after it was released. The uncannily coincidental nature of the text &quot;Not to Be Taken Away&quot; that was stencilled on Moon&#x27;s chair on the album cover was noted by some critics.

== Overview ==
&quot;Who Are You&quot; incorporates elements of progressive rock and, according to biographer Tony Fletcher, it was produced in such a way as to appeal to commercial rock radio at the time. 

The album showcased some of Pete Townshend&#x27;s most complicated arrangements, with multiple layers of synthesizer and strings. Many of the songs also revisited themes from Townshend&#x27;s never realized &quot;Lifehouse&quot; project, featuring lyrics about songwriting and music as a metaphor for life, as indicated by titles like &quot;Guitar and Pen&quot;, &quot;New Song&quot;, &quot;Music Must Change&quot;, and &quot;Sister Disco&quot;. The latter two, along with &quot;Who Are You&quot;, ultimately appeared on the 2000 box set &quot;Lifehouse Chronicles&quot;, Townshend&#x27;s later actualization of the project. Several of the song&#x27;s lyrics also reflect Townshend&#x27;s uncertainty about the Who&#x27;s continued relevance in the wake of punk rock, and his dissatisfaction with the music industry.

There was a three-year hiatus between &quot;Who Are You&quot; and the Who&#x27;s previous studio album, &quot;The Who by Numbers&quot; (1975). The band was drifting apart during this period, for band members were working on various solo projects, and Keith Moon and Townshend were driving deeper into drug and alcohol abuse. The initial sessions at Ramport Studios, produced by Glyn Johns and Jon Astley, were lackadaisical; Jon Astley recalled that &quot;no one wanted to work&quot;, and the members looked forward more to drinking and reminiscing at six in the evening. Astley felt that he and Johns pushed Moon too hard to play a simpler style, while Johns believed that Moon had &quot;lost confidence in his ability&quot; and would deliberately go out of his way to resist his suggestions.

Moon&#x27;s health was especially an object of concern, for his drumming skills had noticeably deteriorated and his performances for most of the sessions were substandard. He was unable to play in time on the track &quot;Music Must Change&quot;, so the drums were removed completely from the track, and replaced with the sound of footsteps and a few cymbal crashes. Bassist John Entwistle remarked that Moon &quot;couldn&#x27;t think of anything to play&quot;. Townshend writes in his memoir &quot;Who I Am&quot; that he offered to remove &quot;Music Must Change&quot; from the album due to Moon&#x27;s struggles, and that Moon retorted, &quot;I am still the best... Keith Moon-type drummer in the world!&quot;.

On another occasion, Astley recalled, &quot;I was doing a drum track, and he hadn&#x27;t learned the song. I actually had to stand up and conduct. He said, &#x27;Can you give me a cue when you get to the middle part?&#x27; [...] He hadn&#x27;t done his homework.&quot; Entwistle similarly described Moon as &quot;really out of condition&quot;, and &quot;disgusted with himself&quot; as a result. Townshend wrote, &quot;Musically his drumming was getting so uneven that recording was almost impossible, so much so that work on the &quot;Who Are You&quot; album had ground to a halt.&quot;

The recording was further delayed when lead singer Roger Daltrey underwent throat surgery, and when during a lengthy Christmas break, Townshend sliced his hand in a window during an argument with his parents. Former Zombies and Argent member Rod Argent was also called in to replace session keyboardist John &quot;Rabbit&quot; Bundrick after Bundrick suffered a broken arm falling out of a taxi at the studio door in March 1978. Townshend attributed Bundrick&#x27;s broken arm to drunkenly throwing himself out to avoid paying the fare.

When the sessions resumed in March, they were moved to RAK Studios, which caused further delays due to the equipment malfunctioning, including the wiping of a backing track. Astley stated that the RAK equipment made the existing material sound different when played back, necessitating further delays as he attempted to fix the audio problems. In one incident, Daltrey punched Johns in the face due to an argument over a rough mix, rendering him unconscious. The argument was fueled by Ted Astley adding a string arrangement to &quot;Had Enough&quot;, which Daltrey derided as &quot;slushy&quot;. After one long and frustrating day, Townshend planned to fire Moon from the band unless he cleaned up his act. The plan drove Moon to attempt to kick his alcohol habit and work more enthusiastically. Due to a prior commitment to produce Joan Armatrading&#x27;s studio album &quot;To the Limit&quot;, Johns had to leave in April, with Astley remaining as sole producer. Under Astley&#x27;s command, the sessions returned to Ramport, with all of the drums except for &quot;Who Are You&quot; recorded in the last two weeks of production. &quot;Who Are You&quot; was released on 18 August 1978.

Moon died on 7 September 1978, just under a month after the album&#x27;s release; on the cover, he is shown sitting in a chair labelled &quot;Not to be taken away&quot;. Photographer Terry O&#x27;Neil had insisted Moon sit with the back of the chair facing the camera so as to hide his distended stomach, a result of his alcoholism.

==Reception==

The album was a commercial success, going 2× platinum in the US and Canada, gold in UK, and peaking at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The soundtrack to &quot;Grease&quot; prevented &quot;Who Are You&quot; from achieving number 1 status in the US. The success of &quot;Who Are You&quot; generated excitement at the prospect of a new Who tour for the album. The songs on the album were later performed on tour in 1979, when the Who were joined by new drummer Kenney Jones and keyboardist John Bundrick.

Reviewing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau said: &quot;Every time I concentrate I get off on some new detail in Daltrey&#x27;s singing or Townshend&#x27;s lyrics or Entwistle&#x27;s bass parts—though not in Moon&#x27;s drumming, and I still don&#x27;t relate to the synthesizer. But I never learn anything new, and this is not my idea of fun rock and roll. It ought to be one or the other, if not both.&quot;

==Live performances==
Across the band&#x27;s entire career, only four of the songs on the album (&quot;Sister Disco&quot;, &quot;Music Must Change&quot;, &quot;Trick of the Light&quot; and &quot;Who Are You&quot;) have been played live.

&quot;Who Are You&quot; was the first of the album&#x27;s songs to be performed live; this was at a concert in the band&#x27;s 1976 tour at the Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, Ontario, albeit in a very raw and abbreviated version extremely different from the finished product. Another early and abbreviated live performance with Moon can be found in &quot;The Who at Kilburn: 1977&quot;, a film of two live performances as a two-disc DVD set released in 2008. It was also played as part of the encore for the Who&#x27;s 2012 Quadrophenia and More tour.

On the Who&#x27;s 1979 tour, only four songs were played live: &quot;Sister Disco&quot;, &quot;Music Must Change&quot;, &quot;Trick of the Light&quot;, and &quot;Who Are You&quot;. On that tour, &quot;Sister Disco&quot; was played quite close to the studio version, but with the country-style acoustic guitar outro replaced by a more bluesy, electric one. The country-style outro returned in 1989 with Townshend on acoustic guitar, and in 2008–09, when he could switch his Fender from &#x27;electric mode&#x27; to &#x27;acoustic mode&#x27;. Townshend actually stated in an interview that this was one of his least favourite songs to perform live (the other being &quot;Dreaming from the Waist&quot;), as Daltrey encouraged Townshend to share a microphone whilst harmonizing on the final vocal tag, evoking a camaraderie Townshend stated didn&#x27;t really exist. It was played in the tours of 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1989, 2008 and 2009.

&quot;Music Must Change&quot; was often given an extended workout live, with performances usually ranging from seven to nine minutes. It was played in the 1979, 1980 and 1981 tours; it was rehearsed for the 2002 tour, but Entwistle died before the start of that tour and the band were not able to perform the song.

&quot;Trick of the Light&quot; was performed occasionally on The Who&#x27;s 1979 tour, with Entwistle on eight-string bass and Townshend playing one of the Alembic basses Entwistle used on the 1975–1976 tours. It made its return to the setlist in 1989, with Townshend on electric guitar for the two Toronto dates in June, and on acoustic guitar for the rest of the tour.

The Who have not been known to play &quot;New Song&quot;, &quot;Had Enough&quot;, &quot;905&quot;, &quot;Guitar and Pen&quot;, and &quot;Love Is Coming Down&quot;. However, the John Entwistle Band used to play the Entwistle-penned songs.

==Re-releases==
In 1985, MCA Records released the album on CD. There were no extra tracks on this CD, as it only contained songs from the original LP.

In 1996, the album was reissued on CD. This re-release was remixed and remastered by Jon Astley and Andy Macpherson; some of the elements from the original mixes were eliminated or changed, including an alternate guitar track on &quot;Music Must Change&quot;, while other elements were restored, such as &quot;Trick of the Light&quot; being restored to its full length of 4:45. This remaster included five bonus tracks: outtakes &quot;Empty Glass&quot; and &quot;No Road Romance&quot;, and alternate mixes for &quot;Guitar and Pen&quot;, &quot;Love Is Coming Down&quot;, and &quot;Who Are You&quot;.

On 24 December 2011, Universal Japan reissued the original analogue mixes of the album on limited, numbered edition SHM-CD, remastered by Jon Astley. The bonus tracks from the 1996 album were also included using vintage mixes where possible; however, the full band version of &quot;No Road Romance&quot; was included instead of Townshend&#x27;s demo from the 1996 issue. The album was reissued in a miniature replica of the vinyl album for CD. In 2014, the album was released in its original mixes on HDtracks and iTunes, along with the rest of the Who&#x27;s catalog.

<text>Angus MacInnis (September 2, 1884 – March 3, 1964) was a Canadian socialist politician and parliamentarian.

MacInnis, a trade unionist who had first served for five years as a Vancouver Alderman, was then elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1930 election as an Independent Labour Member of Parliament. He joined the Ginger Group of socialist MPs led by J.S. Woodsworth. He helped form the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in 1932 and thereafter sat as a CCF MP.

MacInnis retained his status as an MP through five subsequent elections until his retirement in 1957, but sat in three different ridings. From 1930 to 1935 he represented Vancouver South. From 1935 to 1953, he was elected three times in Vancouver East. He finished his political career as MP from Vancouver Kingsway. He was an outspoken advocate of civil liberties and spoke against the discrimination against Japanese Canadians that was widespread in British Columbia in the 1930s and 1940s, and was an early advocate of extending the right to vote to Japanese Canadians, a right that was not won until 1949.

In 1943, he and his wife Grace MacInnis published &quot;Oriental Canadians—Outcasts or Citizens?&quot; which, while a call for humane treatment of Japanese-Canadians, acquiesced to the prevailing mood at the time that favoured &quot;evacuating&quot; Japanese Canadians from the Pacific coast of British Columbia for reasons of wartime security.

When F. R. Scott stepped-down as the National Chairman, just before the CCF&#x27;s biennial convention in Vancouver in July 1950, there was a rift between the farmer and labour wings. Percy Wright a Saskatchewan farmer and Member of Parliament, represented the farmer-wing, while MacInnis, represented the labour-wing. Wright defeated MacInnis in the election to be the CCF&#x27;s National Chairman.

<text>The Bruttians (alternative spelling, Brettii) () were an ancient Italic people. They inhabited the southern extremity of Italy, from the frontiers of Lucania to the Sicilian Straits and the promontory of Leucopetra. This roughly corresponds to the modern region of Calabria.

Occupying originally the mountains and hills of modern Calabria, they were the southernmost branch of the Osco-Umbrian Italic tribes, and were ultimately descended from the Samnites through the process of &quot;ver sacrum&quot;.

They are remembered as pillagers and conquerors of the ancient Greek &quot;poleis&quot; in Magna Graecia and brave rebels of the Romans.

The Museo dei Brettii e degli Enotri in Cosenza contains much recent data on the Bruttii.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Bruttii&quot; must have been ancient since Diodorus speaks of the Bruttians as having expelled the remainder of the Sybarites, who had settled Sybaris on the Traeis in 446/445 BC after the destruction of their own city.

The first archaeological evidence for the existence of &quot;Bruttii&quot; is an inscription &quot;Bruties esum&quot; (I am of Brutius) on pottery in southern Campania from the mid 6th century BC.

The name is Indo-European. It is similar to Illyrian ethnonym Brentii from *brentos (deer). A close variant is attested in the name of the Bruttii in ancient Greek () and the name of the community on its coinage (&quot;ΒΡΕΤΤΙΩΝ&quot;, &quot;of the Brettioi&quot;). Polybius, in more than one passage, calls it , likely corresponding to the natives&#x27; name for their land, &quot;Brettiōn&quot;.

After 356 BC when the Bruttii became independent, the name of the Bruttii became synonyms with &quot;rebels&quot; and &quot;fugitive slaves&quot; for the Lucanians and the ancient sources of the period.

==Geography==

The land of the Bruttii covered almost the entire current province of Cosenza, except the northernmost part which was the southern part of historical Lucania, from which it was separated by a line drawn from the river Laus near the Tyrrhenian Sea to the Crathis near the Gulf of Tarentum. On the west it was washed by the Tyrrhenian Sea, and on the south and east by that known in ancient times as the Sicilian Sea, including under that appellation the Gulf of Tarentum. Their territory corresponds approximately to modern Calabria, which was named as such only during Byzantine times.

Livy uses the term &quot;Bruttii provincia&quot;.

It was included by Augustus in the Third Region (Regio III), together with Lucania; and the two provinces appear to have continued united for most administrative purposes until the fall of the Roman Empire, and were governed conjointly by a magistrate termed a Corrector. The &quot;Liber Coloniarum&quot; however treats the Provincia Bruttiorum as distinct from that of Lucania.

The term &quot;Bruttium&quot; has no evidence in ancient and late ancient times, and only the &quot;land of the Bruttii&quot; or Brittii is attested. This name remained unchanged even after the fall of the Western Roman Empire until from 650 AD the northern area under the direct control of the Lombards is indicated as Bruttium or Brettia in Byzantine documents.

==History==
===Origins===

The land occupied by the Bruttii was inhabited in the earliest times by the Oenotrians, a native Italic tribe whose name refers to winemaking, of which the Conii and Morgetes appear to have been subordinate divisions. It was while the Oenotrians were still masters of the land that the first Greek trading outposts were founded; and the beauty of the climate and country, as well as the rapid prosperity attained by these first settlements, proved so attractive that within a few years many Greek colonies appeared.

The geographer Stephanus of Byzantium who lived in the 6th century AD, citing Antiochus of Syracuse but above all Aristophanes, points out that the Brettii were already mentioned in the 5th century BC in particular referring to the &quot;bruttia pix&quot; (Sila pitch) from the forests of the Sila region. The main wealth of Bruttium came from its forests especially in the conifers of the Sila mountains which provided shelter for grazing cattle and were a source of timber and pitch, used for waterproofing in shipbuilding or for terracotta containers, for sealing the lids of &quot;dolia (vessels)&quot; for food products, and also used in medicine or cosmetics.

In the course of the 4th century a great change took place; the Lucanians (an Oscan people), who had been gradually extending their conquests towards the south, and had already made themselves masters of the northern parts of Oenotria, now pressed forwards into the Bruttian peninsula, and established their dominion over the interior of that country and many of the Greek outposts. This probably took place after their great victory over the Thurii, near Laüs, in 390 BC.

The rise of the Bruttii is dated by ancient authors to approximately 356 BC at the time of the expedition of Dion from Athens against Dionysius the Younger of Syracuse. The wars of the latter as well as of his father with the Greek cities in southern Italy and the state of confusion and weakness to which these were reduced in consequence, probably contributed in a great degree to pave the way for the rise of the Bruttian power.

The Bruttii are represented by some ancient authors as a congregation of rebellious natives; Justin describes them as headed by 500 youths of Lucanian origin who joined the shepherds living in the forests together with other predecessor Italic tribes from the area, not just the Oenotrians, but also the Ausones, Mamertines and Sicels. These groups are described as mostly fugitive slaves by Diodorus and as &quot;experts in affairs of war&quot;. In these stories because of their social conditions the name of the Bruttii acquired the meaning of &quot;rebels&quot; or &quot;fugitive slaves&quot;.

The Bruttii spoke a variant of Oscan and Illyrian settlement in older periods provided considerable Illyrian elements.

A recent proposal is that the majority of the Brettii descended from indigenous populations of protohistoric tradition, of whom we have inscriptions in the Achaean alphabet and in the Paleo-Italic language across almost the entire territory of present-day Calabria. The Brettii, therefore, would not be slaves or descendants of the Lucanians but rather Italics from an ethnic substratum of the Oenotri starting at least from the 5th BC.

===Development===

The progress of the Bruttii after their first appearance in history was rapid. Expansionist aims began, and the Bruttians managed important successes both in the south and north of their territory until they impacted the east and west with the cities of Magna Graecia. They quickly became numerous and powerful enough to defy the Lucanians, and maintained their independence in the mountain districts of the interior. Their independence seems to have been readily acknowledged by the Lucanians.

The Bruttian tribes formed themselves into numerous small villages a few kilometres from each other, interspersed with fortified urban nuclei, in which they gathered the higher social classes (warriors, magistrates and priests) to make decisions for the management and defense of neighbouring villages. Money was minted, and the social fabric began to take shape with the consolidation of social classes, the most important being the warriors.

They coalesced into a league, the &quot;Confoederatio Bruttiorum&quot;, the culmination of the expansion, culture and economy of the Bruttii, and made Consentia (present-day Cosenza) their capital. The other main cities were Pandosia, Aufugum (present-day Montalto Uffugo), Argentanum, Clampetia, Bergae, Besidiae (present-day Bisignano) and Ocriculum.

In the phase preceding the Roman occupation of the region in the Hellenistic age, archaeology has identified around sixty indigenous centres in Calabria, of which fifteen are fortified.

===Wars with Greek cities===

Less than 30 years after their first revolt, they united with the Lucanians as allies against their Greek neighbours and attacked and occupied the Greek cities of Hipponium, Terina, and Thurii. The latter applied for assistance to Alexander, king of Epirus, who crossed over into Italy with an army, and carried on the war for several successive campaigns, during which he reduced Heraclea, Consentia, and Terina; but finally perished in a battle against the combined forces of the Lucanians and Bruttii, near Pandosia, 326 BC.

They next had to contend against the arms of Agathocles of Syracuse, who ravaged their coasts with his fleets, took the city of Hipponium, which he converted into a strong fortress and naval station, and compelled the Bruttians to conclude a disadvantageous peace. But they soon broke this treaty; and recovered possession of Hipponium. This appears to have been the period when the Bruttian nation had reached its highest pitch of power and prosperity; it was not long before they had to contend with a more formidable adversary, and as early as 282 BC they joined the Lucanians and Samnites against the growing power of Rome.

===Pyrrhic War===

A few years later they are mentioned as sending auxiliaries to the army of Pyrrhus, but after his defeat and his expulsion from Italy in 275 BC they had to bear the full brunt of the war. After repeated campaigns and successive triumphs of the Roman generals, Gaius Fabricius Luscinus and Lucius Papirius, the Bruttii were finally reduced to submission, and compelled to purchase peace by the surrender of one-half of the great forest of Sila, so valuable for its pitch and timber.

The Brettian settlement system seems to have dissolved probably following the defeat of Pyrrhus. The cities of Bruttium were called allies but forbidden to make alliances on their own and to mint coins. The only advantage granted by Rome was that of preserving the traditional laws, magistracies and customs: it was a formal autonomy, because the Roman garrisons installed in the fortified citadels ensured that everything was carried out according to Roman interests.

In the decades preceding the 2nd Punic war, the cities and agricultural landscapes of the Bruttii show a picture of general impoverishment, a consequence of the destruction of the Pyrrhic war and the political and social upheavals affecting the cities of Magna Graecia.

===Second Punic War===

The Brutti had never completely submitted and, having reorganised, took advantage of Hannibal &#x27;s invasion in 218 BC to become his allies during the Second Punic War after the Battle of Cannae. They reconquered Consentia and tried to regain their independence.

Rhegium (modern Reggio Calabria) remained firm, and was able to defy the Carthaginians throughout the war. In 215 BC, Hanno, the lieutenant of Hannibal, after his defeat at Grumentum by Tiberius Gracchus, threw himself into Bruttium, where he was soon joined by a body of fresh troops from Carthage under Bomilcar; and from this time he made this region his stronghold, from whence he repeatedly issued to oppose the Roman generals in Lucania and Samnium, while he constantly fell back upon it as a place of safety when defeated or hard pressed by the enemy. The physical character of the country rendered it necessarily a military position of the greatest strength: and after the defeat and death of Hasdrubal Hannibal himself put forces into some Bruttian territory, where he continued to maintain his ground against the Roman generals. In the last phases of the war in 204-2 BC many cities of the Bruttii surrendered to the consul Gnaeus Servilius Caepio after the conquest of Clampetia in 204 by P. Sempronius.

For four years Hannibal retained his positions in this province and made his headquarters for the most part in the neighbourhood of Crotona, but the name of Castra Hannibalis retained by a small town on the Gulf of Squillace, points to his having occupied this also as a permanent station. Meanwhile, the Romans, though avoiding any decisive engagement, were continually gaining ground on him by the successive reduction of towns and fortresses, so that very few of these remained in the hands of the Carthaginian general when he was finally recalled from Italy.

===Romanisation===
From Hannibal&#x27;s departure towards Africa, measures adopted by the Romans under Caepio to punish them completed their romanisation and the ravages of so many successive campaigns inflicted a severe blow upon the prosperity of Bruttium. They were deprived of the right to bear arms, and &quot;en masse&quot; became slaves or employed in inferior roles as attendants of the magistrates instead of servants and not able to serve as Roman legionaries. Rome took away the office of city-state from Consentia, dissolved the Confederation and confiscated almost all the territory, transforming it into &quot;ager publicus&quot;, and the system of hill fortifications was abandoned or destroyed.

But it was some time before they were altogether crushed: for several years after the end of the Second Punic War one of the praetors was annually sent with an army to watch over the Bruttians; and it was evidently with the view of more fully securing their subjection that three colonies of Roman veteran soldiers and their families were established in their territory, two of Roman citizens at Tempsa and Crotona, and a third with Latin rights at Hipponium, to which the name of Vibo Valentia was now given. A fourth was at the same time settled at Thurii on their immediate frontier. Among the settlers at the latter were some ancestors of the first Roman Emperor, Augustus.

In the last quarter of the 2nd century BC the Via Popilia was opened which took on the role of backbone, not only military and political but also economic, of Romanisation and added to the existing Ionian and Tyrrhenian coastal routes which perhaps were restored and improved.

So complete was the romanisation of the region that the Bruttians were later not mentioned, with a few exceptions. First, their country again became the theatre of war during the revolt of Spartacus, who after his first defeats by Crassus, took refuge in the southernmost portion of Bruttium (called by Plutarch the Rhegian peninsula), in which the Roman general sought to confine him by drawing lines of intrenchment across the isthmus from sea to sea. The insurgent leader however forced his way through, and again carried the war into the heart of Lucania.

During the Civil Wars the coasts of Bruttium were repeatedly laid waste by the fleets of Sextus Pompeius, and witnessed several conflicts between the latter and those of Octavian, who had established the headquarters both of his army and navy at Vibo. Strabo speaks of the whole province as reduced in his time to a state of complete decay.

===Late Empire===

The traditional view was that southern Italy including Bruttii was insignificant economically and declined further in the last centuries of the empire (see Crisis of the Third Century) as elsewhere.

Between the 2nd and 3rd centuries many smaller villa-farms, which had lower productivity and could not compete with the larger ones (especially &quot;latifundia&quot;), often failed and were forced to sell them to the wealthy or more successful land owners who were able to invest in land and multiply their productivity and wealth. These were then able to expand their luxurious villas with greater opulence and monumental style. In Bruttii for these reasons, more than 60% of the villas from the Republican and early imperial period disappeared in this period, and this effect continued in the 4-5th centuries in particular the coastal areas of the region.

However, the wealth of the Roman Villa Palazzi di Casignana in the 4th century, one of many examples in the region that have been discovered in the last 20 years, shows that the area enjoyed a long period of relative tranquility and security during the 3rd and also over the next century. Indeed, the territory experienced an economic boom and significant growth in the rural population, with the numerous villas, farms, villages, churches and rural dioceses identified by surface reconnaissance and aerial photography. Nearby there were similar luxurious villas at Marina di Gioiosa Ionica (1st c. BC- 4th c. AD), Naniglio in Gioiosa Ionica, Ardore (3rd-4th c.) and at Quote San Francesco (5th- 6th c.).

The fortunate central position of this area in the Mediterranean and the good land and sea network were decisive factors for the investment by the rich Roman senatorial aristocracy and local notables in the 4th and 5th centuries, and for the holding of the imperial property which was significant in this area. Southern Italy was one of the last enclaves, between the 5th and 6th centuries, of great estates and of economic development linked to agriculture, livestock farming, craftsmanship and trade, while elsewhere in Italy the system was crumbling. The coastal area, however, was abandoned in the 5th century due probably to Arab incursions which led to development of centres in the safest hills in the interior, such as Gerace.

<text>The Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA; , ACEI) is the organization that manages the .ca country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Canada. Its offices are located at 979 Bank Street in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. CIRA sets the policies and agendas that support Canada&#x27;s internet community and Canada&#x27;s involvement in international internet governance. It is a member-driven organization with membership open to all that hold a .ca domain. As of March 2023, there were more than 3.3 million active .ca domains.

== History ==
=== Inception ===

In May 1987, the Information Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California, delegated the ccTLD .ca to the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The university was named the sponsoring delegation for .ca. John Demco, the university&#x27;s computing facilities manager for the Department of Computer Science, would be its administrator and technical contact. For ten years, under his leadership, a group of volunteers managed the .ca domain.

In 1997, the Canadian internet community, part of an evolving and rapidly expanding internet, wanted changes with the administration of the .ca domain. After its annual conference, it formed the Canadian Domain Names Consultation Committee. After public consultations, the committee&#x27;s recommendation was to form a private-sector, not-for-profit corporation to administer the .ca domain in Canada.

On 30 December 1998, the Canadian Internet Registration Authority was incorporated, and in an 11 March 1999 letter, the Government of Canada officially recognized CIRA as the authority to manage the .ca domain for Canada. On 9 May 2000, CIRA, the University of British Columbia, and the Government of Canada entered into an umbrella agreement that stated: &quot;the .ca domain space should be developed as a key public resource for social and economic development for all Canadians&quot;.

On 10 October 2000, Industry Canada sent a letter to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) formally designating CIRA as the Government of Canada&#x27;s designee for the .ca domain. On 30 November 2000, CIRA sent ICANN a letter requesting a redelegation of the ccTLD .ca domain, effective 1 December 2000. ICANN agreed, and on that day, the ccTLD .ca was redelegated to CIRA, effectively transitioning all .ca domains from UBC to CIRA. By 30 November 2000, it had registered approximately 120,000 .ca domain names.

In March 2001, CIRA initiated the process to elect its first board of directors. In May 2001, it opened its offices in Ottawa, Ontario and in June 2001, it held a public election for its initial twelve directors. Its first annual general meeting was held 1 December 2001 in Toronto, Ontario.

=== Milestones ===
In April 2008, CIRA announced that it had surpassed 1 million registered .ca domains. It announced in October 2009, that it would initiate testing for securing the .ca domain space using DNSSEC.

In 2010, CIRA stopped accepting new registrations for third-level domains like &quot;example.on.ca&quot;, which prior to CIRA&#x27;s inception, were imposed on registrants wanting a second-level domain like &quot;example.ca&quot;&quot;,&quot; but who could not meet the domain name registry&#x27;s (UBC) standing requirements. Also in 2010, it announced it had reached 1.5 million registered .ca domains, and it launched a national consultation called the Canadian Internet Forum, designed to engage Canadians on internet governance and policy.

In 2012, CIRA announced it had already reached 2 million .ca registered domains. That year it launched Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs). In 2014, CIRA started a Community Investment Program, and in 2015, launched the Internet Performance Test initiative.

== Additional activities ==
=== Security ===
In September 2012, CIRA held a DNSSEC key signing ceremony, and published its first signed .ca zone file in January 2013. In 2014, it launched its D-Zone DNS firewall and introduced Anycast DNS. A year after its launch, D-Zone was protecting 800,000 users from malware, ransomware and other cyber-attacks in schools, hospitals, municipalities and small businesses across Canada. In June 2016 it announced delivering a white-label Anycast version of D-Zone. In June 2018, CIRA announced a partnership with the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, safeguarding K-12 schools by incorporating data from its Project Arachnid into its D-Zone platform.

=== CIRA Registry Platform ===
In July 2016, CIRA announced it would be offering its back-end registry service called FURY, to gTLDs and ccTLDs around the world. Its first gTLD customer was .kiwi in October 2016. The first ccTLD would be .sx which went live on FURY in November 2017. In 2019, its second and largest ccTLD .ca was added to the platform, and later it added gTLD .mls. In November 2020 .ie completed the process of migrating it&#x27;s backend registration platform to a customised version called Titan.

== Controversy ==
In March 2006, Clyde Beattie, former chair of the CIRA board of directors and Bernard Turcotte, former president and CEO of CIRA sent an open letter to ICANN expressing concerns on ICANN&#x27;s &quot;accountability&quot;, &quot;transparency&quot;, and &quot;fair processes&quot;.

CIRA has itself invited concerns and controversy by changing the make-up of its board of directors, and by removing the reference to &quot;registration&quot; from a clause in its letters patent, allowing it to now go beyond its original mandate by venturing into more lucrative commercial endeavours.

In 2014, Mark Jeftovic, a former CIRA director, and co-founder of easyDNS Technologies Inc, an accredited ICANN domain name registrar, and CIRA certified, sent an open letter to Canada&#x27;s industry minister, the Honorable James Moore. In his letter, he expressed his concerns about CIRA entering the business of managed DNS, while having a monopoly to operate the ccTLD .ca registry. He proposed the registry be opened to a competitive bidding process, in order to operate it under a fixed three to five-year term.

== Governance ==
The CIRA board is composed of twelve elected directors and currently, three non-voting board advisors. The board members are elected annually by CIRA members through an online process.

<doc id="1042218" wikidata="Q783193" url="?curid=1042218" title="Avianca Flight 052">
<text>Avianca Flight 052 was a regularly scheduled flight from Bogotá, Colombia, to New York City, United States, via Medellín, Colombia, that crashed on January 25, 1990, at 21:34 (UTC−05:00). The Boeing 707 flying this route ran out of fuel after a failed attempt to land at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), causing the aircraft to crash onto a hillside in the small village of Cove Neck, New York, on the north shore of Long Island. Eight of the nine crew members and 65 of the 149 passengers on board were killed. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the crash occurred due to the flight crew failing to properly declare a fuel emergency, failure to use an airline operational control dispatch system, inadequate traffic flow management by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the lack of standardized understandable terminology for pilots and controllers for minimum and emergency fuel states.

The flight left Medellín with more than enough fuel for the journey and progressed toward JFK normally. While en route, the flight was placed in three holding patterns. Due to the air traffic controllers giving ultimately untrue delay estimations, the flight became critically low on fuel. This dire situation was not recognized as an emergency by the controllers because of the failure of the pilots to use the word &quot;emergency&quot;. The flight attempted to make a landing at JFK, but bad weather, coupled with poor communication and inadequate management of the aircraft, forced it to abort and attempt a go-around. The flight ran out of fuel before it was able to make a second landing attempt. The airplane crashed about from JFK.

Hundreds of emergency personnel responded to the crash site and helped save victims. Many of those who survived were severely injured and required months or years to physically recover. NTSB investigators looked at various factors that contributed to the crash. The failures of the flight crew were cited as the probable cause of the crash, but the weather, air traffic controller performances, and FAA traffic management were also cited as contributing to the events that led to the accident. This conclusion was controversial, with disagreement between investigators, passengers, and Avianca as to who was ultimately responsible. Eventually, the U.S. government joined with Avianca and settled to pay for the damages to the victims and their families. The crash has been portrayed in a variety of media.

==Background==
The aircraft involved was a Boeing 707-321B (registration HK-2016). The aircraft was manufactured in June 1967, and was purchased by Avianca from Pan Am in 1977. By the time of the crash, the aircraft was 22 years old and had over 61,000 flight hours. The 707 was equipped with four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D-3B engines modified with a hush kit to reduce noise pollution. Avianca personnel reported that they factored in a 5% fuel overburn into the performance calculations due to the hush kit, along with an additional 5% overburn due to the age of the aircraft. Additionally, maintenance crews had noted recurring issues with the aircraft&#x27;s autopilot, including the altitude hold function. These same issues were reported on the aircraft&#x27;s penultimate flight, but maintenance was unable to fix the autopilot, and it was disabled as a result.

The flight was staffed by a crew of nine, including six flight attendants and three flight crewmen. The flight crew in the cockpit consisted of 51-year-old Captain Laureano Caviedes Hoyos, 28-year-old first officer Mauricio Klotz and 45-year-old flight engineer Matias Moyano. At the time of the crash, Captain Caviedes had been employed with Avianca for over 27 years and had logged over 16,000 hours of flight time, including over 1,500 in the 707. Caviedes had 478 hours of night flying experience in the 707 (and 2,435 hours of night flying experience in total) and had no record of any prior accidents. Co-pilot Klotz had been employed with Avianca for three years and had 1,837 hours of flight time, with 408 hours at night. Klotz had transitioned to the 707 the previous October and had logged 64 flight hours in the airframe, including 13 at night. Flight engineer Moyano had been employed with Avianca for over 23 years and had over 10,000 hours of flight time, including over 3,000 hours in the 707 and over 1,000 hours of night flying in the same airframe (and 2,986 hours of night flying regardless of airframe).

All three flight crew members had previous experience in landing at JFK.

==Accident==
Avianca Flight 052 was a regularly scheduled international passenger flight from El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá, Colombia, to JFK in Queens, New York, with an intermediate stop at José María Córdova International Airport near Medellín, Colombia.

===Departure and flight===
Flight 052 departed Bogotá at 13:10 Eastern Standard Time, five minutes ahead of schedule, on January 25, 1990. The flight landed at Medellín at 14:04 and prepared to fly the leg to JFK. At Medellín, the aircraft landed with of fuel. The flight plan filed for the journey to JFK called for of fuel required for the trip to JFK, for reserve fuel, for alternate fuel, for holding fuel, and of taxi fuel totaling minimum of block fuel. The dispatcher at Medellín ordered a total fuel load of , including of &quot;top off&quot; fuel to raise the aircraft weight to the maximum allowable for the planned departure runway. At Medellín, the captain and dispatcher decided to use another runway and requested an additional of fuel.

The flight departed Medellín at 15:08, bound for JFK. The flight first entered U.S. airspace of Miami Air Route Traffic Control Center at 17:28, flying at , and proceeded northward, climbing to . The flight was cleared to fly Atlantic route 7 to the DIXON navigational aid and jet airway 174 to Norfolk, Virginia. Flight 052 entered its first holding pattern over Norfolk at 19:04 and remained circling until 19:23. From there, Flight 052 continued on to the BOTON intersection near Atlantic City, New Jersey, where it was placed in a second holding pattern from 19:43 to 20:12. The flight proceeded to the CAMRN intersection where it entered its third holding pattern from 20:18 to 20:47. Flight 052 entered the CAMRN holding pattern at , having been cleared to descend prior to arrival at the intersection, and the flight descended further to while in the CAMRN holding pattern. At 20:44:09, while still holding at CAMRN, the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZNY) advised Flight 052 that there was an &quot;indefinite hold&quot; and to continue holding at CAMRN. At 20:44:43, the ZNY controller told the flight to &quot;expect further clearance&quot; at 21:05. The flight had previously been given two delay estimates that had passed.

At that point, First Officer Klotz radioed the controller, saying, &quot;ah well I think we need priority we&#x27;re passing [unintelligible]&quot;. The controller inquired as to how long the flight could hold, as well as what their alternative airport was. Klotz replied at 20:46:03 that they could hold for five more minutes. The controller once again inquired as to their alternative airport and Klotz replied at 20:46:24, &quot;It was Boston, but we can&#x27;t do it now we, we, don&#x27;t, we run out of fuel now.&quot; A handoff controller listening in on the conversation called the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (NY TRACON) at 20:46:24 and advised the TRACON controller that Avianca Flight 052 could only hold for five more minutes. The handoff controller asked whether NY TRACON could take the flight or whether to send Avianca to its alternative airport. The NY TRACON controller replied, &quot;Slow him to one eight zero knots and I&#x27;ll take him.&quot; The handoff controller later testified that he had not heard Flight 052 say that they could no longer reach their alternative airport. At 20:46:47, the NY ARTCC radar controller cleared the flight to proceed to JFK at and to slow to . Flight 052 departed the CAMRN holding pattern at 20:47.

===Landing attempt===

At 20:47:27, the NY TRACON feeder controller told the flight crew to &quot;expect an ILS two two left&quot; &quot;altimeter two niner six niner proceed direct Deer Park&quot;. At 20:54:40, the feeder controller directed Flight 052 to make a 360° turn. At 20:56:16, the controller gave the flight a wind shear advisory of an &quot;increase of 10 knots at 1500 feet and then an increase of 10 knots at 500 feet&quot;. The flight crew acknowledged the advisory. At 21:00, JFK was experiencing light drizzle and fog with mile visibility, an indefinite ceiling with obscured, and a wind of at 190°.

At 21:03:07, Flight 052 contacted the NY TRACON final controller, who cleared them to descend progressively to . At 21:03:46, the flight crew discussed the go-around procedures. At 21:09:29, flight engineer Moyano stated that the controllers &quot;already know that we are in [a] bad condition&quot;. The captain said, &quot;No they are descending us&quot;, and the second officer added, &quot;They are giving us priority&quot;. At 21:11:07, the NY TRACON final vector controller informed the flight that they were 15 miles from the outer marker and instructed them to maintain an altitude of &quot;until established on the localizer&quot;. The flight crew began preparing for an instrument landing approach, extending flaps and discussing the appropriate airspeed. The final controller instructed the flight crew to contact the JFK tower controllers and signed off. Klotz acknowledged the transmission.

At 21:15:19, Klotz contacted the tower controllers and informed that Flight 052 was &quot;established two two left&quot;. One minute later, the captain asked if he should lower the landing gear, but the first officer replied, &quot;No I think it&#x27;s too early now.&quot; At 21:17:30, JFK tower asked Flight 052 to increase their airspeed by 10 knots to . At 21:18:11, the flight was from the outer marker. Twenty-one seconds later, the first officer remarked &quot;glideslope alive&quot;. At 21:19:09, the captain requested the landing gear be deployed. Almost a minute later, the JFK tower cleared the flight to land on runway 22L. The captain asked the first officer to confirm that the flight was cleared to land. At 21:20:28, the first officer began informing the captain that the aircraft was below the glideslope. At 21:22:07, Flight 052 descended to . The aircraft began descending beyond the angle of the glideslope, then began climbing above it, followed by a steeper descent. At 21:22:57, the first officer commented, &quot;This is the wind shear.&quot; The first officer warned the captain about the sink rate and noted an altitude of at 21:23:10. As he warned the captain, the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) began 11 &quot;whoop, whoop, pull up&quot; audible warnings. At 21:23:13, the captain called for lights, followed by questions as to where the runway was a few seconds later. The GPWS began four &quot;glideslope&quot; audible warnings a few seconds later, alerting the flight crew that the aircraft was below the glideslope. In response to the captain&#x27;s inquiries, the first officer replied that he did not see the runway. At 21:23:23, the flight began climbing again, having come within of crashing 2 miles short of the runway. The landing gear was raised, and the first officer announced that the flight was executing a missed approach.

===Crash===

The JFK tower controller asked the flight to climb to and make a left turn. At 21:24:06, the captain asked the first officer to &quot;tell them we are in [an] emergency&quot;. The first officer told the JFK tower controller that &quot;we&#x27;ll try once again[;] we&#x27;re running out of fuel&quot;, to which the controller replied, &quot;okay&quot;. A few seconds later, the captain again told the first officer to &quot;advise him we are [in an] emergency&quot; and asked if he did so. The first officer replied, &quot;Yes sir, I already advised him.&quot; The JFK controller directed the flight to contact the NY TRACON approach controller once more at 21:24:39. The TRACON controller asked the flight to climb once more to . The captain asked the first officer again to &quot;advise him we don&#x27;t have fuel&quot;. The first officer replied, &quot;Climb and maintain three thousand and ah we&#x27;re running out of fuel sir.&quot; The captain once again asked whether the first officer had advised the controller of their emergency, and the first officer replied, &quot;Yes sir. I already advise him[;] hundred and eighty on the heading[;] we are going to maintain 3000 feet and he&#x27;s going to get us back.&quot;

A minute later, the controller instructed the flight to turn to the northeast and asked the flight crew if they had enough fuel to be directed from the airport. First Officer Klotz replied, &quot;I guess so thank you very much.&quot; At 21:29:11, Klotz asked the controller if he &quot;can give us a final now...?&quot; The controller said, &quot;affirmative sir[;] turn left heading zero four zero&quot;. At 21:30:12, the controller cleared another aircraft for landing. Klotz briefly thought the clearance was directed at Avianca and began to tell Captain Caviedes to change course before the controller corrected him. The controller then asked Avianca to climb to . Klotz replied, &quot;negative sir we just running out of fuel we okay three thousand now okay&quot;. The controller continued to direct the flight northward, away from the airport. At 21:31:01, the controller said, &quot;Okay and you&#x27;re number two for the approach[;] I just have to give you enough room so you make it without ah having to come out again.&quot;
At 21:32:38, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) recorded a temporary interruption in power. A second later, Flight Engineer Moyano exclaimed, &quot;Flame out[;] flame out on engine number four.&quot; The CVR recorded another interruption in power one second after that, and Moyano said, &quot;Flame out on engine number three[;] essential on number two or number one.&quot; The captain acknowledged. At 21:32:49, Klotz radioed the controller, informing him that the flight had &quot;just ah lost two engines[,] and ... we need priority please&quot;. The controller instructed the flight to fly southwest to intercept the localizer. Klotz acknowledged this. The flight crew selected the ILS. At 21:33:04, the controller informed the flight that they were from the outer marker and cleared them for an ILS approach on runway 22L. Klotz acknowledged. That was the final radio transmission from Flight 052. Caviedes asked if the ILS had been selected. Klotz replied, &quot;It is ready on two&quot; at 21:33:23. One second later, the CVR stopped recording. At 21:34:00, the controller tried to radio the flight, asking, &quot;You have enough fuel to make it to the airport?&quot; There was no response.

The NTSB report estimates that around this time, the flight crashed. The aircraft descended without power, clipped several trees and posts, and crashed onto a hill with a 24° slope in Cove Neck, New York. The fuselage partially fragmented into three distinct pieces. The cockpit and forward cabin separated from the rest of the airframe and were hurled over the crest of the hill, coming to a stop from the rest of the wreckage. The rest of the fuselage stopped within after impact. The main fuselage came to rest on the upslope of the hill, facing south, with the forward end extending over the crest of the hill. The right side of the forward end of the fuselage fractured a residential wooden deck.

==Recovery==
===First response===
Residents of Cove Neck immediately called emergency services. Jeff Race, a paramedic and member of New York City&#x27;s Emergency Medical Service, who lived half a mile from the crash site, was the first rescuer on site. He reported that most passengers were still strapped in their seats and the survivors were crying out for help. Survivors later commented that it took about half an hour for rescue teams to arrive. Initial reports to emergency services reported that a much larger Boeing 747 had crashed. Fire Chief Thomas Reardon of Oyster Bay Fire Company No. 1 was in charge of the initial effort to remove people from the wreckage. In his first call to the Nassau County Fire Commission dispatch, he requested all the help available. Thirty-seven fire and ambulance companies, as well as more than 700 Nassau County police officers arrived to help. Other companies that were not called showed up voluntarily to assist. The swell of support created major problems for extricating survivors.

The crash was only accessible to vehicles via a single residential street. With the surge of rescue personnel who converged on the area, the roads leading to the site soon became choked with traffic. Emergency vehicle drivers abandoned their vehicles contrary to established policy in the course of the rescue efforts. This prevented other vehicles from being able to access the crash area. The road was so impassable, many rescue workers left their vehicles miles away and made it to the scene on foot. Fog also grounded rescue helicopters for two hours. As a result, many critically injured survivors were not evacuated until 23:30. Eventually, four helicopters from the New York City Police Aviation Unit evacuated 21 people from the crash site. Also, major problems occurred with communication by rescuers. Radio frequencies became overloaded, and authorities on site were unable to make command decisions in some cases. The head of surgery of the Nassau County Medical Center was present at the scene, but unable to direct patients to the best locations because many rescuers were radioing the center itself to get advice on where they should send the survivors. Medical professionals on site reported that some hospitals received the most up-to-date information by watching the news coverage. Three of the passengers found alive died of their injuries.

Rescue workers set up two triage areas on the lawn of John and Kay McEnroe, the parents of professional tennis player John McEnroe, at 13 Tennis Court Road. A morgue and command post were also set up on their property, which was from the crash site. At least six bodies were found outside the fuselage. Firefighters and medics erected ladders next to the airframe wreckage and led passengers down on stretchers and to the triage sites. At these sites, doctors tagged the critically injured patients for immediate evacuation. At least 30 bodies were gathered on the makeshift morgue at the McEnroe property by 03:00 the following morning. Passenger Astrid Lopez was initially believed to be dead due to her severe injuries, and officials placed her body in the morgue. A rescuer soon heard her moans, and she was sent to a hospital. Some medical responders were turned away from the scene by police to help ease the congestion. By 03:30, all the survivors had been evacuated to hospitals. At least one emergency responder was hospitalized as a result of the rescue efforts. Throughout the evacuation, priests were on site, offering encouragement, assisting medical personnel, and performing last rites. Many local New York residents showed up at hospitals with food or blankets, or to volunteer as Spanish interpreters. The New York Blood Center reported collecting 2,000 units of blood, almost triple their goal.

===Casualties===

Of the 158 people on board, 73 died as a result of the crash. The lead flight attendant was the only crew member to survive, while the remaining flight attendants and all three flight crew members died. Of the surviving passengers, 72 adults and children over three years old sustained serious injuries, while two sustained minor injuries. Of the 11 infants, two sustained minor injuries, eight were seriously injured, and one died. The surviving flight attendant testified that no communication was made from the cockpit as to the unfolding situation, thus no warning came in the end to assume brace positions. The NTSB report held that, had passengers been warned ahead of time to brace for impact, the severity of some injuries might have been avoided.

The most common serious injuries were multiple lower leg fractures and dislocations, spinal fractures, hip fractures, head injuries, and multiple lacerations and contusions. The NTSB investigators found severe damage on the floor of the cabin, leading many of the passengers&#x27; seats to fracture where their legs met the floor track. This fracturing permitted many of the seats to come loose during the impact and aggravated the passengers&#x27; injuries. The report posits that the passengers&#x27; legs hit the lower seat frames in front of them. At the same time, the seats collapsed and twisted downward and to the left, likely causing hip and spinal fractures. As the impact progressed, the seats, now separated, flung passengers forward into each other and into other wreckage, causing head injuries and lacerations. Passengers holding onto infants reported being unable to either prevent their children from being ejected from their grasp in the impact or locate their children in the darkness afterward. The NTSB held that, had the children been in FAA-approved child seats, many injuries might have been mitigated. Rescuers remarked that one rescued baby was found smiling. The NTSB was unable to accurately chart where individual passengers were seated because Avianca only assigned seats to a few passengers, and many who were assigned reported moving after takeoff.

The cockpit was severely damaged in the impact. It struck an oak tree, which penetrated the area occupied by Klotz and Moyano. All the seats occupied by the flight crew were found outside the cockpit. Neither of the pilots&#x27; seats had shoulder straps as were required by United States domestic passenger flights. At least one flight crew member was airlifted to Nassau County Medical Center. The NTSB report states that all of the flight crew &quot;died from blunt-force head and upper torso trauma.&quot; Five flight attendants also died from blunt-force trauma to the limbs, abdomen, chest, and head.

==Investigation==

The NTSB commenced an investigation, which began shortly after the crash, and concluded with the issuance of its final report on April 30, 1991. Because it involved a Colombian airline, Colombia&#x27;s Departamento Administrativo de Aeronáutica Civil (DAAC) also conducted an investigation into the accident.

A survey of the wreckage revealed that the tail was mostly intact, and all control surfaces were connected to the pilots&#x27; controls. Both wings had been severely damaged on impact and fractured into several pieces. The flaps and slats were found in their extended positions, with the flaps set at 14°. As with the tail, all wing control surfaces were found to have been connected to the pilots&#x27; controls. No evidence was found of any control surface failure prior to the crash. Investigators realized that none of the four engines had been under power at the time of impact. As the first responders worked to rescue the passengers, investigators recovered the flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) from the wreckage, and brought them to the NTSB laboratory in Washington, DC. The FDR was an older oscillographic foil model. In 1989, the FAA began requiring domestic carriers to change to digital FDRs to minimize the errors that foil models produced. This requirement did not apply to international carriers. The Avianca FDR foil was found to have been taped down at some point prior to the flight, and thus was inoperative. The NTSB recommended in the Avianca report that the FAA take an &quot;active role in ensuring upgraded international standards&quot; for flight recorders. The CVR and ATC recordings became vital sources of evidence for the crash. The investigators also looked at meteorological factors that led to flight problems.

The NTSB investigators found that the weather data which the flight crew received in Medellín were 9–10 hours old. Additionally, the alternate airport on the flight plan, Logan International Airport in Boston, was forecast to be below the minimum for safe landing. The NTSB also stated that the flight crew should have been more aware of these problems and cited these deficiencies as evidence of inadequacies in the dispatch of the airplane. The NTSB also found no evidence that the flight crew ever requested weather information en route or communicated with Avianca dispatchers about their fuel status and intents as other flights did. Flight 052 did not make contact with FAA flight service stations or flight watch en route, and the NTSB was unable to determine why. The flight did not express any concern to ATC about their fuel situation during the first two holding patterns that the flight made. The first indication of worry came at 20:09 when the flight crew inquired about delays at Boston. The NTSB posited that the flight crew might have become confused about the &quot;expect further clearance&quot; (EFC) times they were given. This confusion may have been the reason that the flight continued to hold, burning up its reserve fuel to the point where it could no longer divert to Boston.

Investigators also cited the flight engineer for failing to calculate the &quot;minimum approach/landing fuel quantity.&quot; The report references the 360° turn that the flight was ordered to make at 20:54 as evidence that the crew should have known that they were being treated routinely and &quot;not&quot; given any emergency priority. Instead, the CVR revealed that the flight crew was convinced that they were being given priority. Additionally, the NTSB criticized the first officer for failing to use the word &quot;emergency&quot; as the captain had insisted he do. Compounded with the apparent inability of the captain to hear or understand the radio communications, the NTSB called the situation a &quot;total breakdown in communications by the flight crew.&quot; Summarizing, the investigators cited &quot;the flight crew&#x27;s failure to notify ATC of their fuel situation while holding at CAMRN in order to ensure arrival at the approach fix with an adequate approach minimum fuel level and a breakdown in communications between the flight crew and ATC, and among the flight crewmembers&quot; as the two main factors that led to the crash.

Investigators asserted that the performances by the traffic controllers were proper and that the misunderstandings that were made were reasonable. None of the controllers involved considered the word &quot;priority&quot; or the assertions by the flight crew that they were running out of fuel to be indicative of an emergency. The report provided various examples of the flight crew failing to convey the danger of their situation, even moments before the engines flamed out. Although the investigators felt that the communications from the ATC personnel were &quot;proper,&quot; the NTSB voiced concern over the controllers &quot;not&quot; placing significance on the word &quot;priority.&quot; At a public hearing, it was revealed by an unrelated pilot that the emphasis on the word &quot;priority&quot; by the Avianca crew might have come from training and bulletins from Boeing that used the word in relation to fuel emergencies. Avianca also used the word &quot;priority&quot; in its publications on low-fuel status procedures. ATC controllers testified that &quot;Mayday&quot;, &quot;pan-pan&quot;, and &quot;emergency&quot; were the three phrases that they would respond to immediately. The report also stated that &quot;priority&quot; was defined in the ATC Handbook as &quot;precedence, established by order of urgency or importance.&quot; As a result of this linguistic confusion, the NTSB recommended that the FAA work with the International Civil Aviation Organization to develop a standard glossary of clearly defined terms, as well as notify foreign carriers that they must be knowledgeable of ATC rules and procedures.

The NTSB also cited the captain&#x27;s inability to land on his first attempt as contributing to the crash. The investigation revealed that wind shear was a significant factor in the failed approach, but that other factors probably contributed. The report cited recurring maintenance problems with the airplane&#x27;s autopilot as a possible factor. If the pilots had been forced to fly manually from Medellín, investigators believed this might have added to exhaustion and stress in the cockpit. For evidence, the NTSB pointed to nine instances where the captain asked the copilot to repeat the ATC instructions or to confirm the aircraft configuration. This stress, investigators asserted, would have degraded the flight crew&#x27;s performance on final approach. Investigators also looked at the traffic management by the Central Flow Control Facility (CFCF). The CFCF, in communication with NY TRACON, established an airport acceptance rate of 28 aircraft landings per hour that morning. Later, a CFCF supervisor contacted NY TRACON and requested a higher rate of 33 landings per hour. This acceptance rate, investigators concluded, was based on inaccurate weather conditions. The report concluded that these traffic-management problems contributed to the conditions that led to the accident but did not lead directly to the accident.

===Controversy===
The probable cause of the crash was determined by the NTSB to be &quot;the failure of the flight crew to adequately manage the airplane&#x27;s fuel load, and their failure to communicate an emergency fuel situation to air traffic control before fuel exhaustion occurred.&quot; However, two NTSB members filed dissenting opinions in the report. Jim Burnett voted against the adoption of the report because he felt it did not adequately address the failures of the air traffic controllers or the FAA&#x27;s role in allowing more traffic than JFK could handle. Christopher Hart filed a partial dissent because he disagreed with the report&#x27;s findings of a lack of standardized terminology. In his dissent, he wrote that &quot;we do have standardized understandable terminology ... that
would have adequately communicated the existence of a dangerous situation, and the problem was that the pilots failed to use this terminology with the controllers&quot;.

Colombia&#x27;s DAAC investigators also disagreed with some of the NTSB&#x27;s findings. In a comment on a draft of the NTSB&#x27;s report, the DAAC recommended that the NTSB place some responsibility on the controllers for their &quot;inadequate handling&quot; of the Avianca flight. The DAAC also recommended that the NTSB encourage modifying the EFC system, and that FAA regulations should require an &quot;active flight-following system&quot; to assist flight crews in evaluating weather and traffic delays.

==Aftermath==
Two male passengers were arrested at North Shore Hospital after a nurse informed police that 46-year-old Antonio Zuluaga had swallowed containers filled with cocaine. Zuluaga, who had a fractured spine, broken ribs, and a dislocated hip, was the second passenger to be found in possession of cocaine packages, after doctors operating on Jose Figueroa on the day after the crash to stop internal bleeding had also discovered packets of cocaine. Zuluaga and Figueroa pleaded guilty to second-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance. Figueroa was sentenced to seven years to life in prison, and Zuluaga was sentenced to six years to life.

Many crash survivors suffered long recoveries from the physical and psychological traumas they endured. A month after the crash, an orderly caravan of around 1,000 vehicles drove to JFK while some demonstrators laid wreaths in the international terminal lobby to protest the handling of the flight. Some survivors sued the FAA, accusing the agency of failing to ensure the flight&#x27;s safety. In July 1990, Avianca offered $75,000 to each crash survivor or the relatives of those killed. The U.S. government eventually joined Avianca and reached a settlement estimated at over $200 million in damages to the victims.

The same summer, Avianca flights declared two notable fuel emergencies. The first happened in June, when a flight declared a &quot;minimum fuel situation&quot; and landed with only 10 minutes&#x27; worth of fuel left. The second happened in August, when Avianca Flight 020 declared it had &quot;only 15 minutes of fuel left&quot;. Confusion arose as to what the pilot meant, but controllers declared an emergency pre-emptively and cleared the plane to land immediately. The flight was later found to have had over two hours&#x27; worth of fuel remaining.

As of 2025, Avianca has not retired the flight number. Avianca Flight 052 is now a flight from Lima to Bogotá. However, Avianca has changed the numbers for the now non-stop flights from El Dorado to JFK, designated as Avianca Flight AV210, AV244 and Flight AV020 respectively while the airline continues to operate the Medellin to JFK nonstop sector as AV042 and AV144. All of these flights were now operated by the Airbus A320 and the 707 has since been retired.

==In popular culture==
* The events of Flight 052 were featured in &quot;Missing over New York&quot;, a season-two (2005) episode of the Canadian TV series &quot;Mayday&quot; (called &quot;Air Emergency&quot; and &quot;Air Disasters&quot; in the U.S. and &quot;Air Crash Investigation&quot; in the UK and elsewhere around the world). The dramatization was broadcast with the title &quot;Deadly Delay&quot; in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Asia. The flight was also included in a &quot;Mayday&quot; season-eight (2009) &quot;Science of Disaster&quot; special titled &quot;System Breakdown&quot;, which looked at the role of air traffic controllers in aviation disasters.
* Avianca Flight 052 was featured on the MSNBC network&#x27;s &quot;Why Planes Crash&quot; series, in an episode titled &quot;Human Error&quot;.
* The impact of cultural differences between the Colombian pilots and American air traffic controllers was discussed in Malcolm Gladwell&#x27;s book &quot;Outliers&quot;.
* Stock footage of the plane wreckage was used in the 2004 film &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;.
* Survivor Nestor Zarate wrote a book about the flight, titled &quot;20 minutos antes... 20 años después (20 Minutes Before... 20 Years Later)&quot;.

<text>Thomas Howard Stix (July 12, 1924 – April 16, 2001) was an American physicist. Stix performed seminal work in plasma physics and wrote the first mathematical treatment of the field in 1962&#x27;s &quot;The Theory of Plasma Waves&quot;.

==History==
Born in St. Louis, Missouri, on July 12, 1924, Stix grew up near Washington University. The Stix family owned Rice-Stix Inc., a dry goods firm that was among the city&#x27;s largest businesses at the turn of the 20th century. It continued operations until the 1950s. His family home on Forsyth Boulevard was eventually donated to Washington University and is now the Stix International House.

Stix graduated from John Burroughs School and served in the U.S. Army as a radio expert in the Pacific theater during and after World War II. After the war, he obtained his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Caltech in 1948 and his doctorate from Princeton in 1953.

He worked for Project Matterhorn, a secret U.S. study of nuclear fusion, and developed the Stix coil to contain gases that were heated to solar temperatures with electromagnetic waves. Stix&#x27;s invention of the coil jump-started a period of intellectual productivity that revolutionized plasma heating research and whose influence is still felt in the field. Stix&#x27;s 1975 paper “Fast Wave Heating of a Two-Component Plasma” remains one of the most cited papers ever published by the journal &quot;Nuclear Fusion&quot;.

Stix taught astrophysics at Princeton and did much of his research at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (see Model C stellarator). In 1978, Stix was appointed associate director for academic affairs at PPPL. He pioneered and for many years served as director of Princeton&#x27;s Program in Plasma Physics, the first graduate-level program of its kind. In 1991, Princeton awarded its inaugural &quot;University Award for Distinguished Teaching” to Stix for his contributions as a teacher and educator.

Stix and his wife, Hazel Sherwin, were married for 51 years and together had two children, Susan Stix Fisher of New York City and Dr. Michael Sherwin Stix of Lexington, Massachusetts. They lived their last decades in Princeton.

Stix died on April 16, 2001, of leukemia.

==Honors and awards==
In 1962, Stix was elected chair of the Division of Plasma Physics of the American Physical Society. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1969, leading to the first of his three sabbaticals at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.

In 1980, the American Physical Society awarded Stix its highest honor in the plasma physics field, the James Clerk Maxwell Prize for Plasma Physics, for his pioneering role in developing and formalizing the theory of wave propagation and wave heating in plasmas.

In 1999, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award by Fusion Power Associates.

==Legacy==
Stix&#x27;s 1962 book, &quot;The Theory of Plasma Waves&quot;, has been translated into Japanese, Russian, and other languages. It received a paperback reprint in 2012 and still sells and is taught at universities around the world.

His obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that Stix&#x27;s &quot;elegant mastery of the literally infinite complexities of waves in electrified gases helped create a new field of science.&quot;

In 2013, the American Physical Society created the Thomas H. Stix Award, presented annually to a plasma physics researcher with outstanding contributions early in their career.

<text>Even As We Speak is an Australian indie band from Sydney. Formed in the mid-1980s, founding members Matthew Love (guitar, banjo, vocals) and Mary Wyer (vocals, guitar) were later joined by Rob Irwin (bass) Anita Rayner (drums, banjo, mandolin), Paul Clarke (guitar, vocals) and Julian Knowles (keyboards, guitar, production).

==History==
After a series of vinyl releases on Australian independent labels including Phantom Records, and success on the Australian indie scene, they came to the attention of BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel who started to play the band&#x27;s Phantom Records single &#x27;Goes So Slow&#x27; on his show. This brought them to the attention of UK audiences and began a relationship with UK indie label Sarah Records. The band released several singles and an album on Sarah Records, three of which reached the Top 5 of the Melody Maker and &quot;New Musical Express&quot; UK independent music charts in 1992 and 1993.

Between 1992 and 1993, the group recorded three sessions for John Peel and one session for Mark Goodier for BBC Radio 1. They were among the few Australian bands to record Peel Sessions – others were The Birthday Party, The Triffids, The Go-Betweens and Laughing Clowns. These sessions were released as the album &#x27;Yellow Food: The Peel Sessions&#x27; in June 2014. A session was also recorded for Radio France.

Wyer formed a pop rock band, Her Name in Lights, which issued their debut album, &quot;Into the Light Again&quot;, in October 2004. Egg Records of Glasgow has compiled Even As We Speak&#x27;s five Australian vinyl singles into a 17-song CD, &quot;A Three Minute Song is One Minute Too Long&quot; (2007).

In 2016, the band reformed (minus Paul Clarke) to play NYC Popfest and added some further shows to mark the release of &#x27;Yellow Food: The Peel Sessions&#x27;, a compilation album of the complete sessions recorded for the BBC between 1992 and 1993. This led to the band recording and releasing a 5 track EP of new material, &quot;The Black Forest&quot; , on 10-inch vinyl and CD through Emotional Response Records in the US in September 2017.

In 2018, a 25-year re-issue of the Sarah Records LP &quot;Feral Pop Frenzy&quot; was released on Emotional Response and also as a Rough Trade coloured vinyl exclusive in the UK and USA. The band toured the UK in July 2018 headlining a bill with a classic Sarah Records lineup of Secret Shine, Boyracer and Action Painting!, finishing with a headline slot on the Loco Stage at the Indietracks festival.

The full-length album &quot;Adelphi&quot; was released 24 July 2020 on Shelflife Records.

<doc id="1042227" wikidata="Q4119235" url="?curid=1042227" title="Breast engorgement">
<text>Breast engorgement occurs in the mammary glands due to expansion and pressure exerted by the synthesis and storage of breast milk. It is also a main factor in altering the ability of the infant to latch-on. Engorgement changes the shape and curvature of the nipple region by making the breast inflexible, flat, hard, and swollen. The nipples on an engorged breast are flat or inverted. Sometimes it may lead to striae on nipples, mainly a preceding symptom of septation mastitis.

Engorgement usually happens when the breasts switch from colostrum to mature milk (often referred to as when the milk &quot;comes in&quot;). However, engorgement can also happen later if lactating women miss several nursings and not enough milk is expressed from the breasts. It can be exacerbated by insufficient breastfeeding and/or blocked milk ducts. When engorged the breasts may swell, throb, and cause mild to extreme pain.

Engorgement may lead to mastitis (inflammation of the breast) and untreated engorgement puts pressure on the milk ducts, often causing a plugged duct. The woman will often feel a lump in one part of the breast, and the skin in that area may be red and/or warm. If it continues unchecked, the plugged duct can become a breast infection, at which point she may have a fever or flu-like symptoms.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Symptoms include the breasts being swollen and oedematous, and the skin appearing shiny and diffusely red. Usually the whole of both breasts are affected, and they are painful. The woman may have a fever that usually subsides in 24 hours. The nipples may become stretched tight and flat which makes it difficult for the baby to attach and remove the milk. The milk does not flow well.

A fever may occur in 15 percent, but is typically less than 39 degrees C and lasts for less than one day.

== Causes ==

Failure to remove breast milk, especially in the first few days after delivery when the milk comes in and fills the breast, and at the same time blood flow to the breasts increases, causing congestion. The common reasons why milk is not removed adequately are delayed initiation of breastfeeding, infrequent feeds, poor attachment, ineffective suckling, a sudden change in breastfeeding routine, suddenly stopping breastfeeding, or if a baby suddenly starts breastfeeding less than usual.

== Treatment ==

The mother must remove the breast milk. If the baby can attach well and suckle, then she should breastfeed as frequently as the baby is willing. If the baby is not able to attach and suckle effectively, she should express her milk by hand or with a pump a few times until the breasts are softer, so that the baby can attach better, and then get them to breastfeed frequently.
She can apply warm compresses to the breast or take a warm shower before expressing, which helps the milk to flow. She can use cold compresses after feeding or expressing, which helps to reduce the oedema.
Engorgement occurs less often in baby-friendly hospitals which practise the Ten Steps and which help mothers to start breastfeeding soon after delivery.

Regular breastfeeding can and should be continued. Medical methods of treating engorged breasts are proteolytic enzymes such as serrapeptase, protease, and subcutaneous oxytocin. Cabbage leaves are often cited as a possible treatment but studies have found they provide &quot;no overall benefit&quot; on breast engorgement. Evidence from published clinical trials on the effectiveness of treatment options is of weak quality and is not strong enough to justify a clinical recommendation.

<doc id="1042228" wikidata="Q5609424" url="?curid=1042228" title="Grinder's Stand">
<text>Grinder&#x27;s Stand was a stand, or inn, located on the Natchez Trace. A replica can be visited today at the Meriwether Lewis Park, located on the Natchez Trace Parkway in Lewis County, Tennessee, south of Nashville, southwest of Columbia, and east of Hohenwald, Tennessee. This is where Meriwether Lewis died, by suicide (as suspected by his friend and colleague, Thomas Jefferson) or homicide (as suspected by his family).

==History==
The tavern is believed to have been established in 1807 and was originally known as &quot;Indian Line Stand&quot;. The Chickasaw had ceded the land to Tennessee in 1805. Its proprietors were Robert Evans Griner and Priscilla Knight Griner. The establishment is properly &quot;Griner&#x27;s Stand&quot;, given the proprietors. Soon after it opened, people began calling it &quot;Grinder&#x27;s Stand&quot;, and it stuck.

The original stand consisted of two rough log cabins adjoined at right angles, with a dogtrot between them. Both rooms had doors facing the Natchez Trace; one room also had a door facing the detached kitchen behind the stand. A barn and stable were located on the property, although the original placements of these two buildings have not been determined.

According to tradition, Robert Griner sold whiskey to the Indians, whose lands came within a few feet of the cabin. The proper use of the stand was to provide food and lodging to travelers passing through the Natchez Trace.

In October 1809, Meriwether Lewis was fatally shot here in a disputed manner.

In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps built a replica cabin less than 20 feet from the remains of the original stand.

<text>Secret Shine are a British indie band formed in the early 1990s, who were signed to Sarah Records. Their early releases with Sarah and A Turntable Friend followed a pop style, before the band went in a more shoegaze direction with the 1992 release &quot;Untouched&quot;, triggering comparisons with Slowdive and My Bloody Valentine.

==Career==
===1990 to 1996===
The group originally formed under the name Amelia&#x27;s Dream. After sending a three-song demo to Sarah Records, Scott Purnell and Jamie Gingell recorded their first single for the label, &quot;After Years&quot;. After recruiting three more members (Nick Dyte, Dean Purnell, and Paul Vowles) they recorded &quot;Unbearable&quot;, a single for the German label A Turntable Friend. The addition of Dean Tyler to the lineup was followed by the single &quot;Ephemeral&quot; on Sarah. Later, Purnell and Gingell recorded some demos that became the &quot;Untouched&quot; album.

In 1993 the album was recorded and released, along with the single &quot;Loveblind&quot;. The addition of vocalist Kathryn Smith saw the band enter the Indie charts and become part of the emerging shoegaze scene. At that point, the band took a hiatus as Purnell and Gingell returned to complete their final year of university, but the band subsequently reformed and recorded the &quot;Greater than God&quot; EP.

After the recording of the &quot;Each to the Other&quot; flexidisc, Dean Tyler left the band, followed by Nick Dyte. Tim Morris joined on drums, the rest of the lineup being Jamie Gingell (vocals and bass), Scott Purnell (guitars), Dean Purnell (guitars), and Kathryn Smith (vocals). The next single, &quot;Wasted Away&quot;, was released on Spoiler Records as Sarah had recently folded. After playing a gig in Oxford in early 1996, the band decided to stop, though they never officially split.

===2004 to Present===
In 2004, a retrospective collection called &quot;After Years&quot; was released by the Tonevendor label, containing all their Sarah material (apart from the first single, and including the &quot;Untouched&quot; album), which became a catalyst for the band reforming. Around this time, Tim Morris died, and the band reformed to record an acoustic eight-track tribute record, &quot;Morris&quot;.

Another album, &quot;All of The Stars&quot;, was released on 8 April 2008, followed by &quot;The Beginning and the End&quot; on 5 January 2011.

In October 2014 Secret Shine signed with shoegaze and dream pop record label Saint Marie Records. The next full-length album, &quot;There Is Only Now&quot;, was released on 17 March 2017.

On 25 June 2020, the band self-released a new single &quot;Ember&quot;. In an interview around that time the band said that this was intended to be the first of five single releases during 2020-2021 that would form the basis of a new album in 2021, to mark the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary. Another single, &quot;Empyrean&quot;, was released on 26 September 2021.
