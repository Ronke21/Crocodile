<text>Sergey Fyodorovich Akhromeyev (; May 5, 1923 – August 24, 1991) was a Soviet military figure, Hero of the Soviet Union (1982) and Marshal of the Soviet Union (1983).

When he was the first deputy chief of staff of the Soviet Army, he formulated a military plan to invade Afghanistan. He later served as Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet Armed Forces from 1984 to 1988 and as chief military adviser to General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev. A member of the State Committee on the State of Emergency during the 1991 Soviet coup d&#x27;état attempt, Akhromeyev died by suicide after the failure of the coup.

==Early life==
Sergey Akhromeyev was born on 5 May in 1923 in Vindrey, a village in the Tambov Governorate of the Russian SFSR (now Mordovia), in a family of Russian ethnicity. His father fell under dispossession and died in the late 1940s in Central Asia. His mother, after divorcing her husband in 1928, left with her children to Moscow, where she worked at the plant in Krasny Bogatyr.

==Career==
===World War II===

In 1940, he graduated from the 1st Special Naval School in Moscow and in the same year began military service, enrolling in the M.V. Frunze Higher Naval School. He took additional training at the naval base of the Baltic Fleet in Liepāja, in recently Soviet-occupied Latvia. Akhromeyev was a Naval Infantry junior officer on the Eastern Front, serving with distinction during the Siege of Leningrad, and was wounded and suffered frostbite. He continued his studies at the M.V. Frunze Higher Naval School.

Enrolled in August 1942 as a cadet in the courses of lieutenants at the 2nd Astrakhan Infantry School, which he graduated in the same year. From May to August 1942 he was a cadet with the Black Sea Fleet, serving as part of the gunnery unit on the ship. He then served as commander of a rifle platoon of the 197th Army Reserve Regiment of the 28th Army, and since 1943 as an adjutant senior rifle battalion of the same regiment on the 4th Ukrainian Front.

At one point he was ordered to guard and hold a road on which the German Army would be trying to advance. Despite a bloody battle, he was able to accomplish the task. Relating the story during a meal with Secretary of State George Shultz and Ambassador Ken Adelman in Reykjavík during the Reagan Administration, Akhromeyev told Shultz that his accomplishment was not only a great sign of his patriotism, as Shultz suggested, but also was because had he abandoned the road, Stalin would have had him shot. He was decorated for his participation in the defense of Leningrad.

From July 1944, he was commander of a motorized battalion of machine gunners of the 14th Self-Propelled Artillery Brigade of the Reserve of the High Command in the Kharkov and Moscow Military Districts. On 1945, he graduated from the Higher Officers&#x27; School of Self-Propelled Artillery of the Armored and Mechanized Forces of the Red Army.

Akhromeyev recalled his war experiences:
&quot;A total of 18 months, I have never been in a house, even when the temperature is as low as minus 50 degrees celsius. I have been sleeping outside in two winters, and I have never had a warm day. Always fighting, always starving. Moreover, there are so many dead. 8 out of 10 boys of my age are dead. Of my 32 middle school classmates, only one of my classmates and I survived.&quot;

When the war ended in 1945, he was the commander of a tank battalion.

===Post-war service===

After the war, from June 1945 to September 1945, he was deputy commander of the SU-76 Self-Propelled Artillery Battalion. From September 1945 to February 1947, he commanded a tank battalion of the 14th Separate Tank Regiment of the training center. From February 1947, commander of the ISU-122 battalion of the 14th Heavy Tank-Self-Propelled Regiment of the 31st Guards Mechanized Division in the Baku Military District in Azerbaijan SSR.

In 1952 he graduated from the IV Stalin Military Academy of Armored and Mechanized Forces of the Soviet Army. From July 1952, he was the chief of staff of the 190th Tank-Self-Propelled Regiment in the 39th Army of the Primorsky Military District. In August 1955, he commanded tank regiments in the Far Eastern Military District. From December 1957 to December 1960, he served as deputy commander, chief of staff, and commander of the 36th Tank Division in the Belarusian Military District. From April 1964, he served as commander of a training tank division.

From October 1968 to May 1972, he served as commander of the 7th Tank Army in the Belarusian Military District. From May 1972 to March 1974, Akhromeyev served as Chief of Staff and First Deputy Commander of the Far Eastern Military District. In 1973,he graduated from the Higher Academic Courses at the Voroshilov Military Academy of the General Staff of the USSR Armed Forces.

From March 1974 to February 1979, he was the Chief of the Main Operations Directorate (GOU) of the General Staff of the USSR Armed Forces and Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the USSR Armed Forces.

===Soviet-Afghan War===

In 1979, while serving as the First Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the USSR, Akhromeyev formulated a comprehensive plan to invade Afghanistan. This plan was successful, and the Hafizullah Amin regime in Afghanistan immediately fell. Akhromeyev believed that after the occupation of Afghanistan, the Soviet Army should advance on victory and occupy the western part of Pakistan in one go, so that the Soviet Union could obtain the outlet of the Indian Ocean, in order to eradicate the logistics base of the Afghan Mujahaddin.

The young Soviet generals advocated for the invasion of Afghanistan.. Marshals Vasily Chuikov, Kirill Moskalenko and others held this view. During his time as deputy chief of staff, he almost gave up all rest time and devoted himself to work.

===Chief of the General Staff and retirement===

In 1980, he was awarded the Lenin Prize for his research into the use of automated systems in the Armed Forces. Akhromeyev was promoted to Marshal of the Soviet Union in 1983, the only person to have obtained this position without having previously served as chief of the General Staff. Between 1984 and 1989, he served as Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet Armed Forces. In that capacity, Akhromeyev was heavily involved in the talks which brought an end to the Cold War. He grew increasingly dissatisfied with Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s approach to reforming the military, in particular, his insistence on dismantling the newest and most accurate ballistic missile in the Soviet Army — the SS-23 Spider - under the tenets of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and resigned from that position.

Following his retirement from the armed forces, he served as the Deputy of the Council of the Union of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR from the Moldavian SSR on 1984. From December 1988, he served as an advisor to the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. During the Chernobyl Disaster of 1986, Akhromeyev was involved in the organization and deployment of troops to the location of the catastrophe. The Armed Forces personnel carried out radiation monitoring, decontamination of the terrain, sheltering contaminated wastes and participated in the burial of the emergency block. He later presented a report on the conduct of the troops during the disaster.
From May 1989, he served as an advisor to the chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Mikhail Gorbachev. In March 1989, he was elected People&#x27;s Deputy of the USSR from the Bălți Territorial District No. 697 of Moldavian SSR. Akhromeyev served as the member of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Committee of the USSR Armed Forces on Defense and Security. During the meetings at the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies and the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, he repeatedly spoke as well as in the press with articles about the &quot;danger of a quick conquest of the USSR by NATO&quot;.

From December 1988, he served as the Inspector General of the Group of Inspectors General of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union. In March 1990, he was made advisor to the President of the USSR on military affairs. He resigned from all positions in 1991. On November 14, in an interview with the conservative Soviet magazine, he stated that in case of internal division within the USSR, there is a possibility that the military will be dispatched to prevent the country&#x27;s disintegration. He stated:

&quot;I openly state my position. I support the socialist way of life. If someone attempts to split the country or change its social system by force or other unconstitutional acts, the president and the Soviets can decide to use force to ensure the protection of our motherland. Unify and maintain its constitutional social system.&quot;

His comments attracted attention. On June 19, 1991, at a press conference commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Great Patriotic War, Akhromeyev observed that the situation of the Soviet Union in 1991 was similar to that of 1941. He believed that the country was heading for its destruction, going so far as to say that &quot;which was defended by Soviet soldiers and civilians at the expense of millions of people, is about to collapse&quot;.

According to Russian political writer Roy Medvedev:
&quot;Marshal Akhromeyev was a worthy military leader and was highly respected in the army and in the party. The Marshal was discouraged by the behavior of the President of the USSR, who stopped giving his adviser and assistant any assignments and constantly postponed the decision a number of important military problems that Akhromeyev considered urgent. In the end, Akhromeyev submitted his resignation letter back in June 1991, but Gorbachev was also slow to resolve this issue.&quot;

==Involvement in the August Coup and death==

During the August Coup of 1991, Akhromeyev returned from Sochi, where he was on vacation with his wife Tamara Vasilievna and grandchildren, and met with the Vice President of the Soviet Union Gennady Yanaev, to offer his assistance to the coup leaders. On August 20, he worked in the Kremlin and in the building of the Ministry of Defense. Akhromeyev prepared a plan of measures to be taken in connection with the introduction of the state of emergency. On the night of August 20–21, he spent the night in his office in the Kremlin. From his office, he called his daughters and wife in Sochi.
On August 20, Akhromeyev and Grigory Baklanov gathered a working group and organized the collection of information and analysis of the situation. On August 21, according to Akhromeyev, two reports prepared by this group were considered at a meeting of the Emergency Committee. In addition, Akhromeev prepared a draft text for Yanayev for his planned report at the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet. However, Yanayev did not like the text prepared by Akhromeev. On August 22, he sent a personal letter to Gorbachev, where he declared his support of the coup and urged Gorbachev to take action to prevent the dissolution of USSR. On August 23, he attended a meeting of the USSR Supreme Soviet Committee for Defense and State Security. He was, among others author of the planned assault on the White House. The defeat of the coup heralded the imminent end of his political career.

After its failure, Akhromeyev died by suicide. Shortly after his death, there was speculation that the suicide and suicide note were fake and that he was in fact murdered. Among other things, there was speculation as to why he did not shoot himself with his service weapon. There have also been rumors that he has been murdered to prevent him from revealing the partnership of others in a coup attempt. Army general Valentin Varennikov expressed doubts about the suicides of Akhromeyev and Boris Pugo. In addition to personal messages to his family, he left a note explaining that he could not continue living when the institutions to which he had devoted his life were disintegrating.

Akhromeyev was buried at the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery in Moscow. Shortly after his burial, his grave was vandalized and his corpse stripped of the decorations in the uniform, in which it had been buried. The culprits were never found, and it is uncertain whether it was an act of pure desecration or if the grave-robbers hoped to sell the stolen uniform or its adornments for profit. The decorations were never recovered. As a result, a few days later a second funeral and reburial was conducted for him in the same cemetery. His tombstone is engraved with the coat of arms of the USSR and the words; &#x27;communist&#x27;, &#x27;patriot&#x27; and &#x27;soldier&#x27;. Admiral William Crowe, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and later the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom knew Marshal Akhromeyev and once called him a communist, a patriot, and a friend in that order.

According to Marshal Dmitry Yazov:
&quot;But as for Akhromeyev, everything is literally in the case. And all the notes, and this ribbon on which he hanged himself. And a note about the first time the ribbon broke.. I&#x27;m sure that Akhromeyev laid hands on himself. I knew Sergey Fyodorovich well. He could not come to terms with what happened to his country&quot;.

==Legacy==
Akhromeyev&#x27;s memoirs were released posthumously in 1992. In 2015, Russian authorities unveiled a memorial plaque honoring him on the wall of House number#11, Building#4 on Mosfilmovskaya Street in Moscow, where Akhromeyev lived from 1978 to 1991.

==Personal life==
Akhromeyev was married to Tamara Vasilievna Akhromeyeva. They had two daughters, Tatiana and Natalia.

<doc id="1025518" wikidata="Q3748275" url="?curid=1025518" title="Formica rufa species group">
<text>The &quot;Formica rufa&quot; group is a subgeneric group within the genus &quot;Formica&quot;, first proposed by William Morton Wheeler. This group contains the mound-building species of &quot;Formica&quot; commonly termed &quot;wood ants&quot; or &quot;thatch-mound ants&quot;, which build prominent nests consisting of a mound of grass, litter, or conifer needles. The species &quot;Formica rufa&quot; or the red wood ant is the type species of this subgroup.
This particular group can inhabit open deciduous woodlands, dense pine forests, and even moorland. Workers vary in size, the largest reaching about long. They can produce formic acid in their abdomens and eject it in the air when threatened. The only function of males is to mate in flight with queens. Species previously attributed to the &quot;Microgyna&quot; group were transferred to the &quot; F. rufa&quot; group by the Wheelers in 1986.

==Colonies==
The genetic relationships in &quot;F. rufa&quot; group colonies can be complex. Colonies can be polygynous (having multiple queens) and these are often polydomous (having multiple nests per colony). Queens may be singly or multiply mated, and in polygynous colonies, may or may not be related. Colonies are rarely, if ever, independently formed. They either bud off from existing colonies, or are formed by temporary social parasitism of colonies of &quot;F. fusca&quot; or other closely related species. A wood ant queen ousts the existing queen, lays eggs, and the &quot;F. fusca&quot; workers raise her offspring until the nest is taken over. Some species in the &quot;F. rufa&quot; group sometimes form enormous &quot;supercolonies&quot; consisting of hundreds or thousands of nests. The largest documented example is an &quot;F. yessensis&quot; colony in Japan covering containing an estimated 306 million workers and 1 million queens.

<text>The Countryside Commission (formally the Countryside Commission for England and Wales, then the Countryside Commission for England) was a statutory body in England and Wales, and later in England only. Its forerunner, the National Parks Commission, was established in 1949 by the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 to co-ordinate government activity in relation to National Parks.

This body became the Countryside Commission for England and Wales in 1968, when its duties were expanded to cover the countryside as a whole in England and Wales (a separate Countryside Commission for Scotland covered Scotland).

In 1991 the Welsh part of the organisation was split off and amalgamated with the equivalent part of the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC) to become the Countryside Council for Wales. The rest of the organisation became the Countryside Commission for England – for the moment it remained separate from English Nature, as the English part of the NCC became.

The Countryside Commission ceased to exist in 1999 when it was merged with the Rural Development Commission to form the Countryside Agency. This has in turn evolved into Natural England, partly by eventual merger with English Nature.

== List of chairmen of the Countryside Commission ==

* The Baroness Wootton of Abinger
* Sir John Cripps (1970–1977)
* The Lord Winstanley (1978–1980)
* Sir Derek Barber (1981–1991)
* Sir John Johnson (1991–?)
* Richard Simmonds (1996?–?)

<doc id="1025523" wikidata="Q3304326" url="?curid=1025523" title="Mega Man Network Transmission">
<text>is a 2003 action-platform video game developed by Arika and published by Capcom for the GameCube video game console. The game was first released in Japan on March 6, 2003, and in North America and PAL regions the following June as Arika&#x27;s only GameCube game. &quot;Network Transmission&quot; is part of the &quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot; series, which originated on the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld and takes place in an alternate timeline to the main &quot;Mega Man&quot; series.

Taking place one month after the events of the first &quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot; game, the plot follows the protagonist Lan Hikari and his online avatar MegaMan.EXE in their fight against the &quot;WWW (World Three)&quot; organization and its attempt to unleash and spread the infectious &quot;Zero Virus&quot; into cyberspace. The player controls MegaMan through a set of levels that require actions such as jumping, sliding, and shooting, as well as the use of special &quot;Battle Chips&quot; that grant the player various combat and movement abilities. &quot;Network Transmission&quot; combines action and platforming gameplay elements from older &quot;Mega Man&quot; games with the strategy and role-playing elements as defined by the &quot;Battle Network&quot; series.

The development team&#x27;s intent was to meld these attributes into a home console title that would appeal to the young gamer audience that they found with the GBA series. Critical reception for &quot;Network Transmission&quot; has been mostly average reviews. Although it received some positive remarks for its Battle Chip gameplay, many critics have complained that the game features a high or unbalanced difficulty level. The game&#x27;s sound and its combination of 2D and 3D cel-shaded graphics have been met with varied opinions.

==Plot==
The storyline of &quot;Mega Man Network Transmission&quot; takes place during the first decade of the 21st century (&quot;200X&quot;), one month after the original &quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot;. Following the defeat of the &quot;Life Virus&quot;, the ultimate weapon of Dr. Wily and the &quot;WWW (World Three)&quot; organization, Lan Hikari and his network navigator (NetNavi) MegaMan.EXE return to a life of ease. However, no sooner does Lan begin to relax when he hears of a mysterious and destructive computer virus called the &quot;Zero Virus&quot; that infects Navis and causes mayhem via his personal information terminal (PET) e-mail. Lan has other qualms to deal with however, receiving an e-mail detailing fellow NetNavi Roll.EXE being trapped in the internet. MegaMan goes to save her, finding an infected FireMan.EXE as the cause of trouble. Defeating him, the duo talk to FireMan&#x27;s operator, Mr. Match, and learn of the vaccine being distributed to amend the Zero Virus is actually doing just the opposite, having caused FireMan to go berserk.

Confirming this with Lan&#x27;s father, Dr. Yuichiro Hikari, the two set out to search for the cure of the problem, finding many situations of pragmatic Navis infected and causing mayhem. Stopping all of them and returning them to their respective operators, the two eventually discover more clues leading to the remnants of the WWW. It is revealed that a powerful Navi called StarMan.EXE has been distributing the virus. After defeating StarMan, MegaMan and Lan engage in a climactic battle against the powerful super virus Zero himself. However, at the conclusion of the battle, just as the finishing blow is about to be delivered to Zero, the heroes discover he is not evil. Lan&#x27;s father then transforms him into a full-fledged Navi. However, their happiness is short-lived as a former member of the WWW simply named &quot;Professor&quot; reveals this was all part of his scheme to revive the dreaded Life Virus. Analyzing clues, MegaMan and Lan engage and defeat the second Life Virus and use Zero&#x27;s observation powers to eventually bring the Professor to justice. There is dialogue at the end of the game between ShadowMan.EXE and his operator Mr. Dark, leading the plot into the next chronological installment, &quot;Mega Man Battle Network 2&quot;.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Mega Man Network Transmission&quot; incorporates aspects of action and platforming games similar to other &quot;Mega Man&quot; series, while retaining the strategy and role-playing elements of the &quot;Battle Network&quot; series. The player takes control of the protagonist Lan within the game&#x27;s real world and his NetNavi MegaMan.EXE within its internet. Unlike previous games in this series, Lan is restricted from moving location to location. Instead, the player uses a map screen with points of interest to travel to different levels. Levels are opened up as the player progresses through the game, with a slight emphasis on linear progression, although MegaMan can move off-path at times. Levels typically end in a boss battle with another NetNavi. Combat takes place in real-time, with MegaMan given the ability to jump, slide, fire his default arm cannon, and dodge enemy attacks on a two-dimensional plane.

Special abilities called &quot;Battle Chips&quot; are provided through a &quot;Custom Bar&quot; that slowly fills at the top of the screen. When the bar is full, the player can select up to five Battle Chips, which are provided from a folder of player-selected chips. Ten random chips are available when the bar is full; a total of twenty can be used for each level excursion. Battle Chips are used for dealing large amounts of damage to enemies, protecting and restoring the player&#x27;s health, summoning other Navi&#x27;s to MegaMan&#x27;s aid, and for some platforming abilities. Certain chips can even be combined to be more effective. Although Battle Chips are limited in quantity, they can be picked up from deleted enemies or can be purchased at shops when not exploring the internet. As in previous &quot;Battle Network&quot; games, items that upgrade MegaMan&#x27;s maximum health, firing power, and other attributes can also be accessed.

==Development==
&quot;Mega Man Network Transmission&quot; was developed by Arika, who had previously worked on the &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot; series, a 3D polygon rendition of publisher Capcom&#x27;s traditionally 2D fighting series. Producer Keiji Inafune revealed in an interview with &quot;Dengeki&quot; that after a string of PlayStation releases, the team chose to focus their development efforts of the &quot;Mega Man&quot; franchise for Nintendo consoles with the &quot;Battle Network&quot; series. They felt that children who played the GBA handheld were beginning to show interest in the GameCube, and that the character was more suitable to a console related to the Nintendo Family Computer, where the franchise originated. Inafune stated that the developer wanted to &quot;preserve the core of &quot;Rockman&quot;&quot; by transcending the traditional action elements (i.e. running and jumping) for the current gaming hardware from the perspective of the role-playing series.

&quot;Network Transmission&quot; uses a cel-shaded animation style to match the &quot;MegaMan NT Warrior&quot; anime series that was airing in Japan during the game&#x27;s development. Inafune explained that the team opted for an anime style with &quot;eye-catching effects&quot; in place of a more realistic look because he felt it the former would be more enjoyable. Yuji Ishihara, the primary character artist for the &quot;Battle Network&quot; series, used many of his previous character designs for &quot;Network Transmission&quot;. One new contribution was updating his illustration for the revived Life Virus by giving it two fists per arm, among other details. &quot;I thought it would be both an effective look,&quot; Ishihara elaborated, &quot;as well as make for a reasonably mobile character for a polygon-based action game.&quot; The musical score for &quot;Network Transmission&quot; was co-composed by Shinji Hosoe, Ayako Saso, and Yousuke Yasui. Hosoe&#x27;s company Super Sweep Records has recently been given the rights to produce the soundtrack, and it was released as a part of Megaman&#x27;s 25th Anniversary on November 2, 2012.

&quot;Network Transmission&quot; was announced and on display for the first time at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2002. The game was showcased at the &quot;Mega Man&quot; series 15th anniversary celebration event at the Makuhari Messe in Chiba Prefecture that December. A playable version made appearances in January 2003 at the World Hobby Fair in Osaka and at the Capcom Gamer&#x27;s Day event in Las Vegas. Finally, the game was on display at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles during the summer between its Japanese and North American releases.

&quot;Mega Man Network Transmission&quot; is the only Arika game released for the GameCube as the company did not develop further games for that console.

==Reception==

Media Create sales data for Japan shows that &quot;Mega Man Network Transmission&quot; sold 23,147 copies during its first week on sale, 9,041 copies during its second week, 7,859 copies during its third week, and 4,679 copies during its fifth week. A total of 79,360 copies were sold in the country by the end of 2003. A bargain-priced version of the game was released in Japan on March 18, 2004. According to NPD Group, &quot;Network Transmission&quot; sold 30,224 copies in North America, making it the eighth best-selling GameCube game in the region for the month of June 2003.

&quot;Mega Man Network Transmission&quot; has been met with mixed critical reception. The game currently holds scores of 67% on GameRankings and 65 out of 100 on Metacritic. A point of contention for many critics was the game&#x27;s difficulty level. Skyler Miller of G4 summarized, &quot;&quot;Network Transmission&quot; is painfully difficult not because of any genuine challenge, but because of its cheap enemies, frustrating weapons setup, and unnecessary complications. For example, you can only save after beating a boss, which is common in the &quot;Mega Man&quot; series. It&#x27;s tedious to have to wade your way through the relatively straightforward levels time and time again only to meet instant death against a boss.&quot; GameSpy&#x27;s Benjamin Turner felt that the difficulty level was unbalanced rather than too steep, and that once a player gains a foothold on the gameplay and collects enough Battle Chips and power-ups, the challenge subsides. Reviewers for Eurogamer, IGN, and GameSpot all similarly agreed that the greatest difficulty is presented toward the game&#x27;s start, particularly with its first few boss battles.

Opinions on the visuals and audio in &quot;Network Transmission&quot; have been decidedly split. Turner found the music perfectly fitting, but stated, &quot;You may also be disappointed that the graphics don&#x27;t quite push the GameCube. They&#x27;re generally okay, and even pretty a few times, but overall the visuals are a bit spartan.&quot; Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot described the backgrounds and animation as appropriate, that the Japanese voice acting matched the characters, and that the music was upbeat. However, he found the art style lacking in personality, the weapon effects and summons &quot;understated&quot;, and the sound effects &quot;underdeveloped&quot;. IGN&#x27;s Matt Casamassina was conversely impressed by the art style, backgrounds, and frame rate, but disliked the graphics as a whole, proclaiming, &quot;It&#x27;s a brand new product, but it looks like it could have been released on PlayStation 1, or perhaps even on Super Nintendo.&quot; Miller found the game&#x27;s use of cel-shading useless and the titular protagonist &quot;the weakest link of all, looking undefined, vague, and more than a little awkward&quot;.

The game&#x27;s integration of Battle Chips into the side-scroller genre was admired by some reviewers. Casamassina was entertained by discovering and capitalizing on which chips are useful against which enemies. Turner was impressed by the random shuffling of chips in one&#x27;s inventory and the instances of forced improvisation on the player&#x27;s part. Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer expressed satisfaction with having the needed chips at the right times, but admitted frustration with having to disarm oneself to organize them. He asserted, &quot;Even glancing at what you might move to the top of the list involves sending the blue bomber&#x27;s current chips back to the &#x27;Folder&#x27;, leaving you with a choice between edging forward with the paltry chargeable beam weapon and standing around waiting for your Custom bar to fill up again.&quot;

<doc id="1025524" wikidata="Q2528585" url="?curid=1025524" title="Four Color">
<text>Four Color, also known as Four Color Comics and Dell Four Color, is an American comic book anthology series published by Dell Comics between 1939 and 1962. The title is a reference to the four basic colors used when printing comic books (cyan, magenta, yellow and black at the time). The first 25 issues (1939–1942) are known as &quot;series 1&quot;. In mid-1942, the numbering started over again, and &quot;series 2&quot; began. After the first hundred issues of the second series, Dell stopped putting the &quot;Four Color Comics&quot; designation on the books, but they continued the numbering system for twenty years.

More than 1,000 issues were published, usually with multiple titles released every month. An exact accounting of the actual number of unique issues produced is difficult because occasional issue numbers were skipped and a number of reprint issues were also included. Nonetheless, the &quot;Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide&quot; lists well over 1,000 individual issues, ending with #1354. Comics historian Alberto Becattini cites 1332 issues. It currently holds the record for most issues produced of an American comic book title; its nearest rival, DC&#x27;s &quot;Action Comics&quot;, reached the 1,000-issue milestone in 2018.

&quot;Four Color&quot; published many of the first licensed Disney comics; about 20 percent of the &quot;Four Color&quot; issues were devoted to Disney characters.

==History==
Unlike most comic book series of the day, which were either devoted to one character, or were anthologies with collections of stories starring the cartoon characters of a particular studio, &quot;Four Color&quot; instead devoted each individual issue to different characters. One issue might feature a popular cartoon character, while the next might be an adaptation of a popular movie or TV series. Thus the phrase &quot;one shot&quot; which was used in the publisher&#x27;s code in the first interior page of the first story. For example, issue 223 (1949) was denoted DDOS 223 which translates as Donald Duck One-Shot #223. Most &quot;Four Color&quot; titles featured licensed properties; relatively few original characters were created for the line. The first &quot;Four Color&quot; comic featured comic strip and movie serial hero Dick Tracy; the last (issue number 1,354, series 2, dated April–June 1962) was based upon the TV series &quot;Calvin and the Colonel&quot;.

Comics historian Gary Brown wrote, &quot;In the &quot;Four Color Series&quot;, you get a good sense of what America was like in the 1950s. Admittedly, it might be a white, middle-class version of the country, but the series hit on every fad, every icon, and every popular piece of culture that America embraced during this time span. Dell comics released anywhere from one to a half dozen &quot;Four Color&quot; titles a month, touching on topics such as the Old West, animation characters, newspaper comic strips, radio programs, TV programs, movies, and even pop music. For the most part, the series reflected what entertained America in the 1950s — and not just kids, but adults, as well.&quot;

Many of the early &quot;Four Color&quot; issues were reprints of newspaper comic strips; the first series included &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;, &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;, &quot;Donald Duck&quot; and &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;, among others. The only two issues from the first series that published comic book stories were based on new Walt Disney films. Issue #13 featured an adaptation of &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot;, and a &quot;Dumbo&quot; adaptation was the focus of issue #17.

The comic strip reprints continued well into the 1942 second series. Of the first ten issues, eight are strip reprints, including &quot;Little Joe&quot;, &quot;Harold Teen&quot;, &quot;Alley Oop&quot; and &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;. The first two original stories in the second series are issue #5, &quot;Raggedy Ann and Andy&quot;, and issue #9, &quot;Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold&quot;. The series continued strip reprints of &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; until issue #163 (Sept 1947), &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; until issue #206 (Dec 1948) and &quot;Harold Teen&quot; until issue #209 (Jan 1949).

But the focus of the series moved to original comic book stories, and soon the primary purpose behind &quot;Four Color&quot; was as a try-out showcase for potential new Dell Comics series. For example, Tarzan and Little Lulu in early 1948 launched their own titles (starting with no. 1) after proving themselves via a number of &quot;Four Color&quot; try-out issues. However, during the 1940s, the transition was not always so prompt, as a number of prominent funny animal characters starred in 20–30 issues of &quot;Four Color&quot; (these include Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Porky Pig). Comic book historian Michael Barrier notes that by the early 1950s, Dell seemed to be giving more emphasis to subscription sales (promoted via premium giveaways as part of the Dell Comics Club), which necessitated stable series instead of one-shots.

At one point in 1951, some issues of &quot;Four Color&quot; were double-numbered, reflecting the issuances for particular characters; thus issues 318 and 328, featuring Donald Duck, carried the notation &quot;nos. 1–2&quot; on the cover underneath the &quot;Four Color&quot; series number. Indeed, beginning in the early 1950s, it became more prevalent than previously for &quot;Four Color&quot; titles, if they proved popular enough, to become ongoing, independent series. In some cases, the issue numbering of these spin-offs took into account any previous &quot;Four Color&quot; issues (albeit sometimes miscounting the one-shots; &quot;Donald Duck&quot; started with #26 despite the publication of twenty-nine &quot;Four Color issues&quot; with the character preceding it).

Only issues published between c.1940 and 1946 actually carried the title &quot;Four Color Comics&quot; on the cover.

&quot;Four Color&quot; ended its run around the same time Dell&#x27;s partnership with Western Publishing came to an end. Western subsequently formed a competing company, Gold Key Comics, and took over a number of licenses previously held by Dell. This included numerous titles featured under the &quot;Four Color&quot; banner that were then continued as ongoing series under Gold Key; this included most of the Disney and Hanna-Barbera properties.

<text>Telefon Tel Aviv is an American electronic music act formed in 1999 by musicians Charles Cooper and Joshua Eustis. Since Cooper&#x27;s accidental death in 2009, Telefon Tel Aviv has continued with Eustis as the sole official member.

==History==
Telefon Tel Aviv was formed in 1999 by Charles Cooper and Joshua Eustis, with their first album &quot;Fahrenheit Fair Enough,&quot; released in the fall of 2001 to positive reviews. In 2002, the group released an EP on the Hefty Records Immediate Action label. In 2004, the duo released their second full-length album, &quot;Map of What Is Effortless&quot;, and a compilation album of remixes titled &quot;Remixes Compiled&quot; in 2007. The group released its third full-length album in January 2009 on the BPitch Control label. Influenced by English electronic band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), &quot;Immolate Yourself&quot; peaked at #17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Electronic Albums chart. In 2016, their debut was re-released with eight bonus tracks.

Since 2011, Eustis has been working on new music. In March 2012, Eustis mentioned on his Twitter account that he was &quot;trying&quot; to work on new Telefon Tel Aviv material. In February 2013, Eustis was announced as a member of the touring lineup of Nine Inch Nails. He was originally slated to tour with band throughout 2013 and 2014. However, on December 5, 2013, it was revealed by Trent Reznor that Eustis was no longer part of the Nine Inch Nails touring line-up, citing only Alessandro Cortini, Ilan Rubin, Robin Finck, and himself as band members during an IAmA on Reddit. Eustis also confirmed this on the official Telefon Tel Aviv website.

===Death of Charles Cooper===
On January 22, 2009, Eustis announced on the group&#x27;s MySpace blog that Charles Cooper had died. The information also appeared on the band&#x27;s website: &quot;Charles Wesley Cooper III / April 12, 1977 - January 22, 2009&quot;. Two CBS2 Chicago articles about Cooper&#x27;s death specify that he went missing on January 21 before being found dead.

On January 30, 2009, Eustis posted on the group&#x27;s MySpace blog that all tour plans have been cancelled and the future of the band is uncertain.

On March 22, 2009, Eustis posted on the group&#x27;s MySpace blog that he will perform on stage with a close friend of the group, Fredo Nogueira.

On July 22, 2009, Eustis posted on the group&#x27;s MySpace in order to clarify some rumours about Cooper&#x27;s death, stating that three autopsy reports ruled it was not a suicide but possibly an accidental mix of sleeping pills and alcohol.

===Sons Of Magdalene and Future===
On December 9, 2013, Josh Eustis posted on the official Telefon Tel Aviv website that he was going back into the studio full-time, as he was no longer a touring member of Nine Inch Nails and presumably Puscifer as well. In the same post, Eustis stated that he has been sitting on a 95% finished full-length album under the moniker of Sons Of Magdalene, a name previously used for an EP released in 2008. Additionally, the post confirmed that after the record was finished, he would be working on Telefon Tel Aviv full-time. The debut album from the Sons of Magdelene moniker, &quot;Move to Pain&quot;, was released June 24 2014.

==Production==

In interviews, Cooper and Eustis have stated that they use the following software: Digidesign Pro Tools, Native Instruments Reaktor/Electronic Instruments 2 XT, Ableton Live and Max/MSP

Additionally, the band has contributed samples to the Native Instruments &quot;Synthetic Drums 2&quot; sample library.

For the album &quot;Immolate Yourself&quot; the band drastically changed their production style, reverting to analog tape and analog synthesizers, claiming this method to &quot;sound more real&quot;.

<doc id="1025529" wikidata="Q4364365" url="?curid=1025529" title="Plum Island (Massachusetts)">
<text>Plum Island is a barrier island located off the northeastern coast of Massachusetts, north of Cape Ann, United States. It is approximately in length. The island is named for the wild beach plum shrubs that grow on its dunes, but is also famous for the purple sands at high tide, which derive their color from tiny crystals of pink pyrope garnet. It is located in parts of four municipalities in Essex County. From north to south they are the city of Newburyport, and the towns of Newbury, Rowley, and Ipswich.

==History==
===Captain John Smith===
Plum Island appears as an unnamed island as early as Captain John Smith&#x27;s map of New England. Various scholars have speculated on the nature of the earlier accounts of European explorers in the New World, with particular focus on the latter&#x27;s surveys of the coastlines of Massachusetts, but Smith&#x27;s account identifies Plum Island. He describes a harbor at &quot;Angoam&quot; (elsewhere &quot;Aggawom&quot;, the Anglicised Native American name for the native village that preceded Ipswich, Massachusetts, and was destroyed by smallpox) as having &quot;many sands&quot; at its entrance. Before it was an island:

On the east is an Ile two or three leagues in length; the one halfe, plain morish grass fit for pasture, with many faire high groves of mulberry trees gardens; and there is also Oaks, Pines and other woods to make this place an excellent habitation, being a good and safe harbor.

&quot;Morish&quot; is now &quot;marsh&quot;, and the high gardens of &quot;mulberry&quot; trees may be beach plum, which prefers the crowns of the dunes, although today can be seen on only a few. The map shows an imaginary English town (the insertion of Charles I of England) of the then-future &quot;South Hampton&quot;, about where Newbury is. The Hampton suggestions were later put to use, but farther north.

===The Mason grant===
A grant in 1621 by the Plymouth Council for New England, acting under a charter from James I of England (not then reigning) to colonize New England, deeded the land between the &quot;Naumkeag&quot; and Merrimack rivers to Captain John Mason. The island was to be named the Isle of Mason. Mason, then governor of Newfoundland, never acted on the grant. It was later included in a similar grant to the Massachusetts Bay Colony; nevertheless, in 1681 the heirs of John Mason petitioned the General Court of Massachusetts for possession of the grant, now colonized by several communities. After a trial before justices appointed for the purpose, the General Court decided it could not honor the claim, as no one then knew the location of the Naumkeag River, and in any case Mason&#x27;s grant had been included in another. It did assess a nominal quit-rent fee of a few shillings on land-holders undeniably within the tract; that is, as far south as Ipswich.

===Division of the island===
Ipswich, Massachusetts, was incorporated as Ipswich in 1634 by settlers of the previous year from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In 1635 another group from England passed through Ipswich to settle and incorporate Newbury, Massachusetts. In 1639 a third group from England was granted the remaining land between Newbury and Ipswich and incorporated Rowley, Massachusetts. There is no official record of the use of Plum Island until then, although Smith&#x27;s glowing report had included the marsh grass, an enticing feature for herdsmen. A document of January 2, 1639, survives, however, by which Robert Wallis and Thomas Manning of Ipswich agree to maintain a common herd of 48 hogs on Plum Island starting on April 10 and running to the end of the harvest. One of them was always to be present. Reaction of the other communities was immediate. Newbury filed a petition with the General Court of Massachusetts for ownership of the entire island. The petition was denied on March 13 with the proviso that Ipswich, Rowley and Newbury were allowed use of the island, which became a pasture for hogs, cattle and horses.

In March 1649 Newbury again pressed for title to the island. It argued that &quot;for three of four miles together there is no channel betwixt us and it.&quot; At low tide they drove wagons across. These arguments did not prevail; on October 17, 1649, the court finalized its temporary decision, apportioning 2/5 of the island to Newbury, 2/5 to Ipswich and 1/5 to Rowley. There is no hint in the court documents that they ever used a name other than Plum Island. The name is apparently of local origin; the journal of Margaret Smith (1678–9) relates:

Leaving on our right hand Plum Island (so-called on account of the rare Plums which do grow upon it), we struck into the open Sea...

In 1776, during the American Revolutionary War, Fort Philip was built on the northern point of the island to defend the Merrimack River. The fort was rebuilt by the federal government in 1808 and served in the War of 1812. The fort&#x27;s site eroded away in the 1830s, destroying it.

An historian of the region, Joshua Coffin, said of it in 1845:

Plum Island, a wild and fantastical sand beach, is thrown up by the joint power of winds and waves into the thousand wanton figures of a snow drift.

==Current geography and village==
The northern portion of the island is bordered by the mouth of the Merrimack River (in which stands Badgers Rock), the western portion by the Plum Island River in the north (which joins the mouth of the Merrimack to Plum Island Sound), Plum Island Sound in the south (into which empty the Parker, Rowley and Eagle Hill rivers) and the southern portion by the mouth of the Ipswich River (into which the sound empties). The Atlantic Ocean lies to the east. The sound is a tidal estuary.

Now situated in Essex County, Plum Island is divided among four cities and towns: Newburyport, Newbury, Rowley and Ipswich. Developed areas of the island constitute the village of Plum Island, Massachusetts with public beaches, businesses and private residences. The village surrounds a body of water known as &quot;the Basin,&quot; and lies wholly within Newburyport and Newbury, the Newbury portion forming one of three legal precincts of the town. The island&#x27;s pristine largest section is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as the Parker River National Wildlife Refuge. On the mainland opposite, the Massachusetts Audubon Society operates the Joppa Flats Education Center and Wildlife Sanctuary.

In 1985, The Trust for Public Land added an additional 12 acres to the refuge. Besides providing habitat for birds and wildlife, this pristine coastal habitat is also enjoyed by visitors who come to swim, hike, surf, fish, and birdwatch.

Plum Island is accessed by one road running from Newburyport to the north of the island on a causeway and drawbridge over the Plum Island River. A charter to build the road between Rolfe&#x27;s Lane (Ocean Avenue) and the island was granted in 1806 to the Plum Island Turnpike and Bridge Corporation. The road remained a private one until 1905, when the General Court required Essex County to lay it out as a county road, compensating its then owners with a cash settlement.

Plum Island Drive runs along the inland side of the island. In the north it is lined with homes. In the refuge it is paved for about half its distance and is a dusty dirt road for the remainder. Along it are numbered parking lots with boardwalks leading to the beach, overlooks and trails, and facilities for the maintenance of the refuge.

Toward the south is the former site of Camp Sea Haven, a therapeutic camp for those stricken with polio. Visitors are restricted from the levelled site. At the southern end of the road, the tip of the island, is Sandy Point State Reservation, a state park. It is for day use only. At the northern end of the road, the northern tip of the island, is the Plum Island Lighthouse, the only lighthouse remaining on the island. It marks the narrow entrance to the mouth of the Merrimack River. The swift tidal currents through the outlet and through the channel between Ipswich Bay and Ipswich Harbor on the southern end make boating and swimming hazardous.

==Touring facilities==
Like most coastal communities, Plum Island has historically been a popular vacation destination. Several large hotels operated during the late-19th and early-20th centuries. Today, there are numerous lodging options for tourists, including bed and breakfasts, inns, and rental cottages. In addition, there is a population of year-round residents.

From Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend, the city of Newburyport offers a Friday-Sunday shuttle bus from Plum Island Point to downtown Newburyport and the Newburyport commuter rail station with a connection to Boston. The service is operated by the MVRTA, costs $1.25 for adults paying cash.

==Ecology==
===Great Marsh===
Plum Island is a barrier beach sheltering the Plum Island River, Plum Island Sound, and the mouths of the Parker, Rowley, Eagle Hill and Ipswich rivers. The entire area between the islands and the mainland is grassland laced with tidal creeks. At high tide the grassland is entirely submerged, in some places by only a few inches of water. At all other times the extensive stretches of grass appear. The creeks either dry up completely or are small channels within mud flats where shellfish proliferate. The lower stretches of the rivers and Plum Island Sound are thus tidal estuaries receiving the fresh-water flows of the rivers.

The grassland is historically termed &quot;Great Marsh&quot;. However, the name also comprises the similar grasslands behind the barrier beaches at Castle Neck (Crane Beach) and Coffins Beach, which shelter the estuaries of the Essex and Annisquam rivers. Not included are the grasslands south of Cape Ann nor the grasslands north of the mouth of the Merrimack River. The entire coast of Massachusetts comprises this type of estuarial terrain, except for the rocky outcrops. Great Marsh has been the focus of a coalition of environmental groups and agencies to protect the marshes between Cape Ann and the Merrimack River from degradation. Historically this coalition continues the work of the founding fathers of Ipswich and other towns in the area, who found it necessary to protect the marsh from overgrazing by means of legislation.

===Beach===
Plum Island Beach is a gently sloping shelf extending some distance out to sea. As a result of the slope, tidal flow does not reach very far horizontally, while breakers are small and close to shore. Boats can easily be launched from or landed on the beach. The shelf causes strong undertow currents. During severe storms the beach is inundated and the breakers strike the dune line. A number of ships have been wrecked in the shallow waters off Plum Island Beach.

The Labrador Current flows from north to south along the shore, migrating sand in that direction and chilling the coastal waters. Several breakwaters have been constructed along the north coast of the island to protect the beach and impede the process. The migrating sand moves the outlet of the Merrimack River, which has been artificially fixed at its current location.

===Vascular plants===
On the dunes a fragile cover of beach grass, beach pea and beach heather stabilize the sand. Visitors to the refuge are restricted from the dunes except on boardwalks to protect this cover. Destabilization has been a problem. In 1953 the U.S. Soil Conservation Service planted several thousand black pines, a hardy alpine tree, to help hold the sand.

Stands of black pine, pitch pine and occasional eastern red cedar trees can be found in the depressions between the dunes. There also are thickets of beach plum, from which the island takes its name, as well as bayberry and honeysuckle (the latter being intrusive).

Maximum dune elevation is about . In the deeper depressions and more sheltered regions between or next to the higher dunes are vernal pools in which black oak, red maple and black cherry can be found. In the underbrush are cranberry. The ferns, moss and leaf cover there shelter salamanders and spadefoot toads.

The native salt-water marshes between Plum Island and the mainland (Great Marsh) are visible from the western edge of the island. Salt marsh hay which grows there has been harvested for feeding farm animals.

Less visible in &quot;the low marsh&quot; at the margin of the water is smooth cordgrass. Also in the marsh are the sedges, &quot;Cyperus&quot; and &quot;Carex&quot;.

In the 1940s and &#x27;50s the wildlife service created two freshwater marshes, North and South Pools, from island runoff by diking a section of the marsh contiguous to the island. It serves as a nesting area and stopover for migrating birds. Originally the common cattail dominated the freshwater marshes, but two intrusive plants, the common reed and purple loosestrife, have replaced much of it.

===Mammals===
The mammals are typical of Massachusetts woodland: the striped skunk, the raccoon, the red fox, the meadow jumping mouse, the white-tailed deer, meadow vole, white-footed mouse and others.

===Avians===
Plum Island and its surrounding estuaries are a popular destination for birders. Plum Island Sound is on a migratory route for many varieties of birds, as well as being a nesting area for piping plovers. Much of the beach in the National Wildlife Refuge is closed to visitors during the nesting season, which can last most of the warm months.

Several prepared observation posts of birds are usually populated by birders with equipment ranging from simple binoculars to expensive telephoto cameras. Some posts are blinds; others are simply a paved shoulder with a sign. Birds are usually observed in the native salt-water marshes, the artificial fresh-water marshes and the thickets and isolated trees of the refuge.

The birds most commonly observed are listed in the visitor center in the refuge. They are the greater yellowlegs, mallard duck, least sandpiper, great egret, snowy egret, herring gull, great black-backed gull, osprey, Canada goose, tree swallow, gray catbird, killdeer, glossy ibis, red-winged blackbird, northern mockingbird, least tern, piping plover and peregrine falcon.

==Beach and dune pests==

===Greenhead flies===
The greatest visible pest to humans is the greenhead fly. Before insect control they swarmed the beach and dunes so thickly as to make human presence there difficult if not impossible from June through September. In recent years the near elimination of the population with traps has reduced their impact to an occasional bite.

===Ticks===
The dog tick and the deer tick enter the clothing of their victim from the vegetation and later crawl into the soft tissue, where they attach themselves. Dog ticks are less harmful, except to dogs, from whom they can in sufficient numbers remove a dangerous amount of blood. Deer ticks often carry Lyme disease, which is endemic to the region.

===Mosquitoes===
The mosquito is a pest everywhere in Massachusetts. Mosquito control has reduced the presence of the pest in the Newbury region. A few cases of eastern equine encephalitis virus, carried by mosquitoes, occur each year.

===Poison ivy===
Poison ivy is indigenous to all the woodlands of Massachusetts. It especially loves the margins of paths. On Plum Island it grows in every thicket and in mats along the sand. The visitor is cautioned at the visitor center to learn to identify its shiny leaves with three leaflets.

<text>The Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in Britain, also known as Britain Yearly Meeting (and, until 1995, London Yearly Meeting), is a Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in England, Scotland, Wales, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. It is the national organisation of Quakers living in Britain. Britain Yearly Meeting refers to both the religious gathering and the organisation. &quot;Yearly Meeting&quot;, or &quot;Yearly Meeting Gathering&quot; are usually the names given to the annual gathering of British Quakers. Quakers in Britain is the name the organisation is commonly known by.

== History ==
=== First Quaker meetings in Britain (1654–1672) ===

Britain Yearly Meeting, which until 1995 was known as London Yearly Meeting, grew out of various national and regional meetings of Friends in the 1650s and 1660s and has met annually in some form since 1668. The first meeting of Friends from different parts of Britain to be organised was at Balby in Yorkshire in 1656. This consisted of representatives from meetings in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire &quot;to consider of such things as might (in the Truth&#x27;s behalf) be propounded unto them; and to enquire into the cause and matter of disorder, if any be.&quot; The Quaker book of discipline, &quot;Quaker Faith and Practice&quot;:

We may think of that at Swannington in 1654 or Balby in 1656 (the postscript to whose lengthy letter of counsel is so much better known than the letter itself) or Skipton the same year, or the general meeting for the whole nation held at Beckerings Park, the Bedfordshire home of John Crook, for three days in May 1658, and attended by several thousand Friends. This in some ways might be considered the first Yearly Meeting were it not for the fact that the 1660s, through persecution and pestilence, saw breaks in annual continuity. The meeting in May 1668 was followed by one at Christmastime, which lasted into 1669, since when the series has been unbroken. It is 1668, therefore, that we have traditionally chosen as the date of establishment of London Yearly Meeting. But many (though not all) of the meetings up to 1677 were select, that is, confined to &quot;publick&quot; (or ministering) Friends: from 1678 they were representative rather than select in character.

===Seventeenth century===
==== Establishment of Yearly Meetings (1672) ====
In 1660 was a meeting which was attended by representatives from Friends from the whole of Britain. At this meeting it was decided that an annual &quot;General Assembly of the Brethren&quot; be held in London annually, the first being held in Fifth Month (May) 1661. For various reasons, this meeting was not held every year, although there has been a national annual meeting of some sort in Britain every year since 1668.

At the &quot;General Meeting of Friends for the Nation&quot; in 1672, it was decided that there would be a:
Generall Meeting of friends held in London once a yeare in the week called Whisun week to consist of six friends for the Citty of London, three for the Citty of Bristoll, two for the Towne of Cochester and one or two from each and every of the Counties of England and Wales respectively (sic)

Minutes are preserved from 1672 which record that this meeting was held in 1673, and from 1674 to 1677 consisted only of recorded ministers. The Yearly Meeting with representatives from each area as described above was restored in 1678, and has met on an annual basis every year since then.

==== The end of official persecution in England (1689) ====

Under James II of England persecution practically ceased. James issued a Declaration of Indulgence in 1687 and 1688, and it was widely held that William Penn had been its author.

In 1689 the Toleration Act was passed. It allowed for freedom of conscience and prevented persecution by making it illegal to disturb anybody else from worship. Thus British Quakerism became tolerated though still not widely understood or accepted and were instead identified in English and Welsh law as a dissenting group.

From almost the very beginning of the movement in the middle seventeenth century, Quakers became notable in the popular imagination not merely for their radical religious ideas and seemingly peculiar social habits but also for their legendary willingness to be jailed or punished for their beliefs.

=== Eighteenth century ===

During the first full century of Quakerism, Quakers underwent a transformation from enemies of the Church of England to quiet pursuit of inward faith. Responding to the struggles and persecution of the seventeenth century, Friends insisted on pursuing a practice of &quot;peculiarity&quot; to protect Quaker communities. This often meant that the business of monthly meetings was taken up with incidents of &quot;outside marriage&quot; and Friends who had chosen a path upon which to &quot;walk disorderly&quot;. Women were entitled to remain single or choose to defer marriage and according to James Jenkins&#x27; records of the time, Quakers recognised the presence of a &quot;call&quot; or &quot;service in all&quot; that existed &quot;beyond their function in family&quot;. This parity of roles may have led to a higher rate of literacy for Quaker women than for women in Britain at large during the eighteenth century. Employment and civil rights were a major Quaker concern during this period. John Bellers, a Fellow of the Royal Society and educational theorist called for &quot;the rich to take care of the poor and their education&quot; and in his 1714 text, &quot;About the Improvement of Physick&quot; advocated for a national system of hospitals to treat the poor and train doctors, a precursor to the National Health Service.

Throughout the century there were a significant number of Quakers who travelled as missionaries to Europe, the Americas, and Africa. Quaker missionaries from England were supported spiritually, financially, and logistically by London Yearly Meeting. The Yearly Meeting &quot;routinely funded&quot; transatlantic crossings for Quaker ministers to Pennsylvania. However, within British society this period is marked as an &quot;inward&quot; era – more commonly known as the Quietist period (a reference to early Christian Quietists). Influenced by Quietists such as Jeanne-Marie Bouvier de la Motte-Guyon, Francois Fenelon, and Miguel de Molinos, the spiritual practices of nonviolence and inward nourishment resonated with Quaker testimony and significant numbers of Friends adopted plain dress and a &quot;concern against ostentation&quot;.

==== Yearly Meeting for Women (1784–1907) ====
Participation in Yearly Meeting was originally limited to men but in 1784, the Yearly Meeting for Women was established, which corresponded with equivalent Yearly Meetings for Women abroad, and corresponded with the Monthly Meetings for Women and Quarterly Meetings for Women in Britain. In 1898, London Yearly Meeting produced a minute stating that:
in future, women Friends are to be recognized as forming a constituent part of all our Meetings for Church Affairs equally with their brethren
and since then women have had an equal right to attend London Yearly Meeting. The Yearly Meeting for Women was laid down in 1907.

=== Nineteenth century ===
The actions of British Quakers in the nineteenth century can be characterised by political activism (political and philanthropic), social reform, and industry. The society underwent a number of changes and series of revisions to the Quietist method which ultimately led to the breakaway denominations of Hicksite, Gurneys, White Quakers, Waterites, and Fritchley General Meeting. London Yearly Meeting in the nineteenth century was a central base for political activity, allowing individual Quakers to &quot;distribute doctrine and ideas&quot; supported by the centrally managed Yearly Meeting based at Devonshire House. A significant number of Quakers began to take seats in Parliament during the nineteenth century. Amongst them, Joseph Pease, John Bright, Fowell Buxton, John Ellis, Edmund Backhouse, and Charles Gilpin. Bright was a vocal opponent to the Crimean War, the Quaker peace testimony a central part of his pacifism and campaign, beginning a thirty-year tenure as the MP for Birmingham from 1857–1885. Fowell Buxton was a prolific campaigner for the abolition of slavery, founding the Anti-Slavery Society with Joseph Pease (younger) in 1823 and becoming leader of the abolition movement following William Wilberforce in 1825. Joseph Pease served as the president of the Peace Society for twelve years alongside the Quaker scientist and philanthropist William Allen. 
In 1818 on capital punishment Yearly Meeting was not merely preoccupied with introspective consideration of the state of the Society: it sought to awaken the public conscience. A statement in 1856 on liberty of conscience was translated into half a dozen languages and taken by deputations of concerned Friends to ecclesiastics and statesmen from Madrid to St Petersburg.

==== Fritchley General Meeting (1868) ====
Fritchley Meeting in Derbyshire split off from London Yearly Meeting in 1868 because they felt that London Yearly Meeting was becoming too evangelical in its outlook. They also objected to Friends in London Yearly Meeting stopping the practices of plain speech and plain dress. They therefore established Fritchley General Meeting as a self-proclaimed Yearly Meeting for Conservative Friends in Britain, which existed as a separate Yearly Meeting entirely independent of London Yearly Meeting, until 1968. Friends from Bournbrook in Birmingham also joined with Fritchley Friends for a few years, before emigrating to Saskatchewan in Canada. The separation was healed in 1968 with Fritchley Meeting rejoining London Yearly Meeting. Fritchley Quaker Meeting is now a full member of Britain Yearly Meeting, with a variety of theological outlooks amongst its membership.

=== Twentieth century ===
==== Meetings outside London ====
In the twentieth century, Yearly Meetings started to be held outside London, namely in Leeds in 1905; in Birmingham in 1908; in Manchester in 1912; in Llandrindrod Wells in 1924; in Scarborough in 1925; in Manchester in 1926; in Bristol in 1937; In York in 1941 and in 1942. in Edinburgh in 1948. In 1945, London Yearly Meeting produced a minute stating that the Yearly Meeting should be held in Eighth Month (August) outside London every four years. These four-yearly meetings, which have become known as &quot;Residential Yearly Meetings&quot; have been held in Exeter in 1986; in Aberdeen in 1989; in Coventry in 1993; in Aberystwyth in 1997; in Exeter in 2001; in York in 2005; in York again in 2009; and in Canterbury in 2011.

London Yearly Meeting in 1994 decided on a change of name to &quot;The Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in Britain&quot; in 1994, with the short form being &quot;Britain Yearly Meeting&quot;. This name change came into effect at the start of 1995.

== Organisational structure ==

Britain Yearly Meeting is the name used to refer to both the Yearly Meeting of Quakers and the central organisation of Quakers in Britain, based in Friends House, London. Britain Yearly Meeting is the national organisation of Quakers in Britain. Its membership consists of the members of all Area Meetings in England, Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands. Any member of Britain Yearly Meeting is entitled to attend the Yearly Meeting gathering.

The national work of Quakers in Britain is undertaken by Meeting for Sufferings and four central standing committees. The committees are composed of representatives from Meetings throughout Britain. This correspondence and representation means that Quakers in Britain can have unified response on major issues. The central work of Meeting for Sufferings and the standing committees is supported by the staff of Britain Yearly Meeting who work from Friends House (Euston), Edinburgh, Swarthmoor Hall and Vibrancy teams whose work covers large areas of Britain.

===Central committees===
There are committees set up to deal with particular issues, including long running committees consisting of representatives from all over Britain: Meeting for Sufferings, Quaker Life and Quaker Peace and Social Witness.

====Meeting for Sufferings====
Meeting for Sufferings is a national representative committee which deals with decisions which need to be made on a national basis for the Yearly Meeting during the year whilst Yearly Meeting is not in session. It has two representatives from each Area Meeting in England, Wales, Scotland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. The General Meeting for Scotland is a member of the ecumenical organisation Action of Churches Together in Scotland.

==== Standing Committees ====
Britain Yearly Meeting currently has four standing committees who carry out work at a national level on behalf of Friends in Britain. Each have representative committees of Friends appointed by Meeting for Sufferings, and accountable to British Yearly Meeting trustees, to oversee the work, as well as a paid secretariat who carry out the day-to-day work of each department:
*Quaker Life Central Committee deals with the running of Quaker meetings within Britain, including outreach work within Britain, education and development for Quakers in Britain, activities for children and young people.
*Quaker Peace and Social Witness deals with Quakers&#x27; peace and development work, both in Britain and overseas.
*Quaker World Relations Committee maintains contact with other yearly meetings and with Friends World Committee for Consultation and its Europe &amp; Middle East Section to which Britain Yearly Meeting is affiliated.
*Quaker Committee on Christian and Interfaith Relations deals with relationships between Quakers and other Christian and faith groups.

Britain Yearly Meeting assembles and publishes a book of discipline, which since 1995 has been known as &quot;Quaker faith &amp; practice&quot;. In 2018, Britain Yearly Meeting decided to revise Quaker faith &amp; practice.

== Yearly meeting ==
Before 2009, three out of four yearly meetings of BYM were held at Friends House over one of the May bank holiday weekends, and once every four years a week-long Residential Meeting was held in the summer. In a change to this practice, the first Yearly Meeting Gathering (YMG) was held in York in 2009, with the 2010 Yearly Meeting being held at Friends House in London on May. The second YMG was held in Canterbury in 2011. A new three-year rotation has been established with Yearly Meetings being held two years running at Friends House, and the third year as a residential YMG.

All types of issues are discussed in the standard fashion of Quaker decision making. Among several lectures over the gathering, one of the highlights is known as the Swarthmore Lecture, relating to issues concerning Quakers. There is also an under 19&#x27;s programme, with activities tailored to each age group.

=== Events for young Quakers ===

==== Under 19s Programme ====
The Under 19s Programme is held during the annual Britain Yearly Meeting and is attended by young Quakers aged 0 to 19, with appropriate age grouping (i.e. 0–3...,15–18). The programme aims to provide young Friends with an insight to Quaker beliefs and values, as well as providing a safe environment for relationship building within the society.

==== Junior Yearly Meeting ====
Junior Yearly Meeting, commonly known as &quot;JYM&quot;, is an event for young Quakers aged 14 to 18. The annual event is normally held around the Easter holidays at the Pioneer Centre in Kidderminster, and coincides biennially with Yearly Meeting Gathering in late July. It acts as a stepping stone for the transition from the Under 19s Programme into the Society of Friends.

== Relationship with international Friends ==
Britain Yearly Meeting participates in the international Religious Society of Friends through the Friends World Committee for Consultation. Britain Yearly Meeting also contributes a large portion of the Quaker United Nations Office budget, through Quaker Peace and Social Witness.

Communications between Yearly Meetings take the form of epistles. Formerly these would be individually addressed to other Yearly Meetings, but now epistles are posted online by the Friends World Committee for Consultation. Quakers are a highly decentralized denomination with a great degree of diversity in beliefs and practices. Britain Yearly Meeting worships in a way that is most similar to Ireland, Canada, Australia and US meetings affiliated with the Friends General Conference characterized by unprogrammed worship and liberal to universalist theology.

<doc id="1025538" wikidata="Q1142458" url="?curid=1025538" title="Findability">
<text>Findability is the ease with which information contained on a website can be found, both from outside the website (using search engines and the like) and by users already on the website. Although findability has relevance outside the World Wide Web, the term is usually used in that context. Most relevant websites do not come up in the top results because designers and engineers do not cater to the way ranking algorithms work currently. Its importance can be determined from the first law of e-commerce, which states &quot;If the user can’t find the product, the user can’t buy the product.&quot; As of December 2014, out of 10.3 billion monthly Google searches by Internet users in the United States, an estimated 78% are made to research products and services online.

Findability encompasses aspects of information architecture, user interface design, accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO), among others.

==Introduction==
Findability is similar to discoverability, which is defined as the ability of something, especially a piece of content or information, to be found. It is different from web search in that the word &quot;find&quot; refers to locating something in a known space while &#x27;search&#x27; is in an unknown space or not in an expected location.

Mark Baker, the author of &quot;Every Page is Page One&quot;, mentions that findability &quot;is a content problem, not a search problem&quot;. Even when the right content is present, users often find themselves deep within the content of a website but not in the right place. He further adds that findability is intractable, perfect findability is unattainable, but we need to focus on reducing the effort for finding that a user would have to do for themselves.

Findability can be divided into external findability and on-site findability, based on where the customers need to find the information.

==History==
Heather Lutze is thought to have created the term in the early 2000s. The popularization of the term &quot;findability&quot; for the Web is usually credited to Peter Morville. In 2005 he defined it as: &quot;the ability of users to identify an appropriate Web site and navigate the pages of the site to discover and retrieve relevant information resources&quot;, though it appears to have been first coined in a public context referring to the web and information retrieval by Alkis Papadopoullos in a 2005 article entitled &quot;Findability&quot;.

==External findability==
External findability is the domain of Internet marketing and search engine optimization (SEO) tactics. External findability can be very influential for businesses. Smaller companies may have trouble influencing external findability, due to being less aware to consumers. Other means are taken to make sure that they are found in search results.

Several factors affect external findability:
# &quot;Search engine indexing&quot;: As the very first step, webpages need to be found by indexing crawler in order to be shown in the search results. It would be helpful to avoid factors that may lead to webpages being ignored by indexing crawlers. Those factors may include elements that require user interaction, such as entering log-in credentials. Algorithms for indexing vary by the search engine which means the number of webpages of a website successfully being indexed may be very different between Google and Yahoo!&#x27;s search engines. Also, in countries like China, government policies could significantly influence the indexing algorithms. In this case, local knowledge about laws and policies could be valuable.
# &quot;Page descriptions in search results&quot;: Once the webpages are successfully indexed by web crawlers and show in the search results with decent ranking, the next step is to attract customers to click the link to the web pages. However, the customers can&#x27;t see the whole web pages at this point; they can only see an excerpt of the webpage&#x27;s content and metadata. Therefore, displaying meaningful information in a limited space, usually a couple of sentences, in search results is important for increasing click traffic of the webpages, and thus the findability of the web content on your webpages.
# &quot;Keyword matching&quot;: At a semantic level, terminology used by the searcher and the content producer be different. Bridging the gap between the terms used by customers and developers is helpful for making web content more findable to more potential content consumers.

==On-site findability==
On-site findability is concerned with the ability of a potential customer to find what they are looking for within a specific site. More than 90 percent of customers use internal searches in a website compared to browsing. Of those, only 50 percent find what they are looking for. Improving the quality of on-site searches highly improves the business of the website. Several factors affect findability on a website:
# &quot;Site search&quot;: If searchers within a site do not find what they are looking for, they tend to leave rather than browse through the website. Users who had successful site searches are twice as likely to ultimately convert.
# &quot;Related links and products&quot;: User experience can be enhanced by trying to understand the needs of the customer and provide suggestions for other, related information.
# &quot;Site match to customer needs and preferences&quot;: Site design, content creation, and recommendations are major factors for affecting the customer experience.

==Evaluation and measures==
Baseline findability is the existing findability before changes are made in order to improve it. This is measured by participants who represent the customer base of the website, who try to locate a sample set of items using the existing navigation of the website.

In order to evaluate how easily information can be found by searching a site using a search engine or information retrieval system, retrievability measures were developed, and similarly, navigability measures now measure ease of information access through browsing a site (e.g. PageRank, MNav, InfoScent (see Information foraging), etc.).

Findability also can be evaluated via the following techniques:
* Usability testing: Conducted to find out how and why users navigate through a website to accomplish tasks.
* Tree testing: An information architecture based technique, to determine if critical information can be found on the website.
* Closed card sorting: A usability technique based on information architecture, for evaluating the strength of categories.
* Click testing: Accounts for the implicit data collected through clicks on the user interface.

==Beyond findability==
Findability Sciences defines a findability index in terms of each user&#x27;s influence, context, and sentiments. For seamless search, current websites focus on a combination of structured hypertext-based information architectures and rich Internet application-enabled visualization techniques.

<doc id="1025548" wikidata="Q940601" url="?curid=1025548" title="Charles Francis Hall">
<text>Charles Francis Hall ( – November 8, 1871) was an American Arctic explorer, best known for his collection of Inuit testimony regarding the 1845 Franklin Expedition and the suspicious circumstances surrounding his death while leading the American-sponsored &quot;Polaris&quot; expedition in an attempt to be the first to reach the North Pole. The expedition was marred by insubordination, incompetence, and poor leadership.

Hall returned to the ship from an exploratory sledging journey, and promptly fell ill. Before he died, he accused members of the crew—the expedition&#x27;s lead scientist, Emil Bessels, in particular—of having poisoned him. An exhumation of his body in 1968 revealed that he had ingested a large quantity of arsenic in the last two weeks of his life.

== Early life ==
Little is known of Hall&#x27;s early life. He was born either in Rochester, New Hampshire, or in the state of Vermont before moving to Rochester at a young age, where he was apprenticed to a blacksmith at a young age.

In the 1840s, he married and drifted westward, arriving in Cincinnati in 1849, where he went into business making seals and engraving plates. He later published his own newspaper; the &quot;Cincinnati Occasional&quot;, later renamed the &quot;Daily Press&quot;.

== Arctic exploration ==
=== First expedition (1860-1862) ===
Around 1857, Hall became interested in the Arctic and spent the next few years studying the reports of previous explorers and trying to raise money for an expedition, intended primarily to learn the fate of Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition.
Hall went on his first expedition by gaining passage on the &quot;George Henry&quot;, a whaler commanded by Captain Sidney O. Budington out of New Bedford. They got as far as Baffin Island, where the &quot;George Henry&quot; was forced to spend the winter. Local Inuit told Hall about relics of Martin Frobisher&#x27;s mining venture at Frobisher Bay, to which Hall traveled to inspect these items. He was assisted by his newly recruited Inuit guides, husband and wife Ipirvik and Taqulittuq.

Hall also found what he took to be evidence that some members of Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition were still alive. On his return to New York, Hall arranged for the Harper Brothers to publish his account of the expedition: &quot;Arctic Researches and Life Among the Esquimaux&quot;. It was edited by William Parker Snow, equally obsessed by Franklin&#x27;s fate. The two eventually came to a disagreement, owing mostly to Snow&#x27;s slow editing. Snow later claimed that Hall had used his ideas for the search for Franklin without giving him due credit.

=== Second expedition (1863-1869) ===
Over the course of 1863, Hall planned a second expedition to seek more clues on the fate of Franklin, including efforts to find any of the rumoured survivors or their written records. The first attempt, using the 95-ton schooner, , was abandoned, probably owing to lack of finances caused by the American Civil War and a troubled relationship with his intended second-in-command, William Parker Snow. Finally, in July 1864, a much smaller expedition departed in the whaler &quot;Monticello&quot;.

During this second expedition to King William Island, Hall found remains and artifacts from the Franklin expedition, and made more inquiries about their fate from natives living there. Hall eventually came to believe that the stories of survivors were unreliable, either by the Inuit or his own readiness to give them overly optimistic interpretations.

On July 31, 1868, while in Repulse Bay, Hall shot Patrick Coleman, a whaler in his party, claiming that Coleman, himself unarmed, was attempting mutiny. Other whalers in the party claimed the attack occurred because Hall was angry that Coleman was interviewing local Inuit without his permission. Coleman died two weeks after being shot, during which Hall expressed remorse and tried to heal him. Hall was never tried for Coleman&#x27;s murder: the Canadian government considered it under American jurisdiction and the American government entirely ignored the matter. Two days after Coleman&#x27;s death, the whaling ships &quot;Ansel Gibbs&quot; and &quot;Concordia&quot; arrived in Repulse Bay. The remaining four whalers deserted to these ships while Hall stayed with the Inuit.

=== &quot;Polaris&quot; expedition (1871-1873) ===

Hall&#x27;s third expedition was of an entirely different character. He received a grant of $50,000 from the U.S. Congress to command an expedition to the North Pole on the . The party of 25 also included Hall&#x27;s old friend Budington as sailing master, George Tyson as navigator, and Emil Bessels as physician and chief of scientific staff. The expedition was troubled from the start as the party split into rival factions. Hall&#x27;s authority over the expedition was resented by a large portion of the party, and discipline broke down.

==== Death ====

&quot;Polaris&quot; sailed into Thank God Harbor—present-day Hall Bay—on September 10, 1871, and anchored for the winter on the shore of northern Greenland. That fall, upon returning to the ship from a sledging expedition with an Inuit guide to a fjord which he named Newman Bay, Hall suddenly fell ill after drinking a cup of coffee. He collapsed in what was described as a fit. For the next week he suffered from vomiting and delirium, then seemed to improve for a few days. At that time, he accused several of the ship&#x27;s company, including Bessels, of having poisoned him. Shortly thereafter, Hall died on November 8. Hall was taken ashore and given a formal burial.

Command of the expedition devolved on Budington, who reorganized to try for the Pole in June 1872. This was unsuccessful and &quot;Polaris&quot; turned south. On October 12, the ship was beset by ice in Smith Sound and was on the verge of being crushed. Nineteen of the crew and the Inuit guides abandoned ship for the surrounding ice while 14 remained aboard. &quot;Polaris&quot; was run aground near Etah and crushed on October 24. After wintering ashore, the crew sailed south in two boats and were rescued by a whaler, returning home via Scotland.

The following year, the remainder of the party attempted to extricate &quot;Polaris&quot; from the pack and head south. A group, including Tyson, became separated as the pack broke up violently and threatened to crush the ship in the fall of 1872. The group of 19 drifted over on an ice floe for the next six months, before being rescued off the coast of Newfoundland by the sealer on April 30, 1873, and probably would have all perished had the group not included several Inuit who were able to hunt for the party.

==== Investigation ====
The official investigation that followed ruled that Hall had died from apoplexy. However, in 1968, Hall&#x27;s biographer, Chauncey C. Loomis, a professor at Dartmouth College, made an expedition to Greenland to exhume Hall&#x27;s body. To the benefit of the professor, permafrost had preserved the body, flag shroud, clothing, and coffin. Tests on tissue samples of bone, fingernails and hair showed that Hall died of poisoning from large doses of arsenic in the last two weeks of his life.

This diagnosis is consistent with the symptoms party members reported. It is possible that Hall treated himself with the poison, as arsenic was a common ingredient of quack medicines of the time. Loomis considered it possible that he was murdered by one of the other members of the expedition, possibly Bessels, though no charges were ever filed. Most recently, the emergence of affectionate letters written by both Hall and Bessels to Vinnie Ream, a young sculptor they both met in New York while waiting for the Polaris to be outfitted, suggests a possible motive for Bessels to eliminate Hall.

<doc id="1025551" wikidata="Q148769" url="?curid=1025551" title="Formica rufa">
<text>Formica rufa, also known as the red wood ant, southern wood ant, or horse ant, is a boreal member of the &quot;Formica rufa&quot; group of ants, and is the type species for that group, being described already by Linnaeus. It is native to Eurasia, with a recorded distribution stretching from the middle of Scandinavia to the northern Iberia and Anatolia, and from Great Britain to Lake Baikal, with unconfirmed reportings of it also to the Russian Far East. There are claims that it can be found in North America, but this is not confirmed in specialised literature, and no recent publication where North American wood ants are listed mentions it as present, while records from North America are all listed as dubious or unconfirmed in a record compilation. The workers&#x27; heads and thoraces are colored red and the abdomen brownish-black, usually with dark patches on the head and promensonotum, although some individuals may be more uniform reddish and even have some red on the part of the gaster facing the body. In order to separate them from closely related species, specimens needs to be inspected under magnification, where difference in hairiness are among the telling characteristics, with &quot;Formica rufa&quot; being hairier than per example &quot;Formica polyctena&quot; but less hairy than &quot;Formica lugubris&quot;. Workers are polymorphic, measuring 4.5–9 mm in length. They have large mandibles, and like many other ant species, they are able to spray formic acid from their abdomens as a defence. Formic acid was first extracted in 1671 by the English naturalist John Ray by distilling a large number of crushed ants of this species. Adult wood ants primarily feed on honeydew from aphids. Some groups form large networks of connected nests with multiple queen colonies, while others have single-queen colonies.

==Description==
Nests of these ants are large, conspicuous, dome-shaped mounds of grass, twigs, or conifer needles, often built against a rotting stump, usually situated in woodland clearings where the sun&#x27;s rays can reach them. Large colonies may have 100,000 to 400,000 workers and 100 queens. &quot;F. rufa&quot; is highly polygynous and often readopts postnuptial queens from its own mother colony, leading to old, multigallery nests that may contain well over 100 egg-producing females. These colonies often may measure several metres in height and diameter. &quot;F. rufa&quot; is aggressively territorial, and often attacks and removes other ant species from the area. Nuptial flights take place during the springtime and are often marked by savage battles between neighbouring colonies as territorial boundaries are re-established. New nests are established by budding from existing nests in the spring, or by the mechanism of temporary social parasitism, the hosts being species of the &quot;F. fusca&quot; group, notably &quot;F. fusca&quot; and &quot;F. lemani&quot;, although incipient &quot;F. rufa&quot; colonies have also been recorded from nests of &quot;F. glebaria&quot;, &quot;F. cunnicularia&quot;. An &quot;F. rufa&quot; queen ousts the nest&#x27;s existing queen, lays eggs, and the existing workers care for her offspring until the nest is taken over.
==Diet==
These ants&#x27; primary diet is aphid honeydew, but they also prey on invertebrates such as insects and arachnids; they are voracious scavengers. Foraging trails may extend 100 m. Larger workers have been observed to forage farther away from the nest. &quot;F. rufa&quot; commonly is used in forestry and often is introduced into an area as a form of pest management.

==Behavior==
===Nursing===
Worker ants in &quot;F. rufa&quot; have been observed to practice parental care or perform cocoon nursing. A worker ant goes through a sensitive phase, where it becomes accustomed to a chemical stimulus emitted by the cocoon. The sensitive phase occurs at an early and specific period. An experiment was conducted by Moli et al. to test how worker ants react to different types of cocoon: homospecific and heterospecific cocoons. If the worker ant is brought up in the absence of cocoons, it will show neither recognition nor nursing behaviour. Both types of cocoons are opened up by the workers and devoured for nutrients. When accustomed to only the homospecific cocoons, the workers collect both types of cocoons, but only place and protect the homospecific cocoons. The heterospecific cocoons are neglected and abandoned in the nest and eaten. Lastly, if heterospecific cocoons were injected with extract from the homospecific cocoons, the workers tend to both types of cocoons equally. This demonstrates that a chemical stimulus from the cocoons seems to be of paramount importance in prompting adoption behaviour in worker ants. However, the specific chemical / stimulus has not been identified.

===Foraging behaviour===
The foraging behaviour of wood ants changes according to the environment. Wood ants have been shown to tend and harvest aphids and prey on and compete with, other predators for food resources. They tend to prey on the most plentiful members of the community whether they are in the canopies of trees or in the forest foliage. Wood ants seem to favour prey that lives in local canopies near their nest; however, when food resources dwindle, they seek other trees further from the nests and explore more trees instead of exploring the forest floor more thoroughly. This makes foraging for food significantly less efficient, but the rest of the nest does not help the foraging ants.

===Kin behaviour===
Wood ants have shown aggressive behaviour toward their own species in certain situations. Intraspecific competition usually occurs early in the spring between workers of competing nests. This aggression may be linked to the protection of maintaining territory and trail. By observing skirmishes and trail formation of wood ants, the territory surrounding each nest differs between seasons. Permanent foraging trails are reinforced each season, and if an ant from an alien species crossed it, hostile activity occurs. Most likely, the territory changes based on foraging patterns are influenced by seasonal changes.

Ants recognize their nestmates through chemical signals. Failure in recognition causes the colony integrity to decay. Heavy metals accumulated through the environment alter the aggression levels. This could be due to a variety of factors such as changes in physiological effect or changes in resource levels. The ants in these territories tend to be less productive and efficient. Increased resource competition would be expected to increase level of aggression, but this is not the case.

=== Raiding ===
Wood ants, particularly those in the Formica species, perform organised and planned attacks on other ant colonies or insects. These planned attacks are motivated by territory expansion, resource acquisition, and brood capture. Raids are performed at certain times of the year, when resources may need restocking, and during the day when ants are most active. Organised and cooperative strategies for raiding are more specific tactics used by the &quot;Formica polyctena&quot; species. However, raiding is still an integral behaviour of the &quot;Formica rufa&quot; group. Scouts will investigate neighbouring nests to raid, marking their targets using pheromones. Wood ants are also capable of counterattack/defending retaliation. Strong defensive measures include guarding entrances to tunnels and having routine patrols of the areas to watch neighbouring nests. Some wood ant species, such as &quot;Formica sanguinea,&quot; will raid brood, which is then integrated into their colony as workers. This behaviour enables the colony to bolster its workforce without expending energy on raising its brood. The captured brood matures and functions within the raiding colony, helping with foraging and nest maintenance tasks.

Raiding has significant evolutionary and ecological implications. This behaviour can establish dominance hierarchies among colonies and influence the structure of ant communities. Raiding contributes to the success of dominant species by providing access to resources that might otherwise be difficult to obtain. This behaviour also reflects the ants’ ability to adapt their foraging strategies to varying environmental conditions. Wood ants can also alter the distribution of resources in the ecosystem by dominating key food sources.

=== Resin use ===
Wood ants intently collect resins from coniferous trees and incorporate them into their nests for various uses. Resin provides wood ants with structural soundness and predator defense to their nests and antimicrobial, antifungal, and pathogen defense when in conjunction with formic acid from their venom gland.

By leveraging the antimicrobial properties of the resin, wood ants are adequately ensuring and sustaining the health of their colonies. Wood ant nests are vulnerable to rapidly spreading microbial loads due to the dense population and organic debris accumulation within large, complex structures. Terpenes and phenolic acids found in coniferous tree resins provide antimicrobial defense and inhibit the growth of pathogens within the nests when mixed with the ants&#x27; formic acid. Nests that have been fortified by resin have significantly less microbial diversity when compared to nests without resin. By managing their environment, wood ants are proficiently protecting the health of their colonies, with the direct advantages of protecting the queen and developing brood with decreased pathogen exposure.

Besides antifungal and microbial defense, resin provides value structural integrity to the nest and a protective barrier from potential intruders and predators. Wood ant nests are vulnerable to numerous external threats as they are often large, complex, and above ground. By binding the resin to other organic materials, the nest is provided with cohesive building material, making the nest less prone to collapse.  Incorporating resin also provides nests with waterproofing and weather resistance, another way to prevent fungal growth. The stickiness and sometimes toxicity of the resin aid in providing a protective barrier against small arthropods and mites that may attack the nest. Chemically, the resin provides camouflage and deters intruders that may use chemical cues to locate nests.

==Colony structure==

=== Polygyny ===
Polygyny in wood ants (&quot;Formica&quot; genus) is a colony&#x27;s social structure that contains multiple reproducing queens. Polygyny may have evolved to enhance colony survival in unstable environments as it allows wood ants to disperse across larger areas by establishing interconnected nests with several queens. This differs from the more commonly observed monogynous social structure of only one reproducing queen within a colony. This behaviour can lead to significant ecological, evolutionary, and colony-level consequences.

Polygyny may have evolved to enhance colony survival in unstable environments as it allows wood ants to disperse across larger areas by establishing interconnected nests with several queens. This differs from a monogamous colony, as a single queen’s reproductive output limits the colony&#x27;s growth. In a monogamous colony, a new queen will typically leave its nest by flight to find and establish a new nest away from the old one. In a polygynous colony, the new queen will establish its nest nearby, with worker ants helping to connect and create cooperative, large colonies. Polygyny allows for higher genetic diversity within the colony, making the colony less susceptible to pathogens and infections. These polygynous colonies have a more complex social hierarchy and can be more successful in certain ecological contexts because of the combined reproductive efforts of several queens.

Through polygyny, the wood ant colonies exhibit reduced levels of relatedness between workers, which can have negative and positive implications. A negative implication is that there can be reduced cooperation between the ants within a colony. However, this reduced level of cooperation is mitigated by the sheer scale of resources available to polygynous colonies. Besides higher genetic diversity, a positive implication is that the colony has faster growth in numbers due to multiple queens producing broods. With higher numbers, there are more ants to collect resources and carry out raids, but this also has drawbacks. Larger colonies put a lot of structural pressure on the above-ground nest that most wood ants have.

===Nest splitting===
Wood ants typically have multiple nests so they may relocate in case of drastic changes in the environment. This splitting of nests causes the creation of multiple daughter nests. Several reasons occur as to why wood ants move. Such as a change in availability of food resources, attack by the population of another colony, or a change in the state of the nest itself. During this time, workers, queens, and the brood are transferred from the original nest to the daughter nest in a bilateral direction. The goal is to move to the daughter nest, but the transporting ants may bring an individual back to the original nest. The splitting process may last from a week to over a month.

===Population===
Turnover rate of wood ant nests is very quick. Within a period of three years, Klimetzek counted 248 nests within a 1,640 hectare area under study. Furthermore, no evidence of a correlation between nest age and mortality was found. Smaller nests had lower life expectancy compared to larger nests. The size of the nests increased as the nest aged.

==Bee paralysis virus==
In 2008, the chronic bee paralysis virus was reported for the first time in this and another species of ants, &quot;Camponotus vagus&quot;. CBPV affects bees, ants, and mites.

<doc id="1025552" wikidata="Q6766613" url="?curid=1025552" title="Mark Attanasio">
<text>Mark L. Attanasio (born September 29, 1957) is an American businessman from the Bronx who is the principal owner of the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB) and the majority shareholder of football club Norwich City. He is worth an estimated $700 million.

In September 2004, he reached a deal, on behalf of an investment group, to purchase the Brewers from the family of MLB commissioner Bud Selig for an estimated US$223 million. The deal was approved by MLB in 2005.

== Early life and education ==
Attanasio was born in the Bronx, New York, and grew up in Tenafly, New Jersey, where he attended high school. He graduated from Brown University with a Bachelor of Arts in 1979 and received his Juris Doctor from Columbia Law School in 1982.

== Career ==

=== Finance ===
Attanasio co-founded and is a senior executive of the Los Angeles alternative investment firm Crescent Capital Group in 1991, which was later bought by Trust Company of the West in 1995. 

In 2001, Attanasio joined the board of directors at the telecommunications firm Global Crossing, which filed for bankruptcy in January 2002. He resigned his position on the board shortly thereafter.

=== Milwaukee Brewers ===
In September 2004, the Milwaukee Brewers and the Selig family announced that they had accepted Attanasio&#x27;s bid to buy the team. 

In 2023, the Brewers reached an agreement with Wisconsin lawmakers for taxpayers to subsidize renovations of American Family Field, the Brewers stadium, to the tune of nearly half a billion dollars. In the lead-up to the agreement, Brewers officials threatened to leave Milwaukee unless the team received taxpayer money.

=== Norwich City ===
In August 2022, it was announced that Attanasio would become a director of Norwich City, an act Attanasio said was his proudest achievement. It was later reported that he would be purchasing an 18% stake in the club from Michael Foulger under the business group Norfolk Holdings. In April 2024, Attanasio’s stake in the club was increased to 40.4% following EFL ratification, making him one of the joint majority shareholders alongside Delia Smith and Michael Wynn-Jones.

On 23 October 2024, Attanasio &amp; Norfolk Holdings became the sole majority shareholders of the club, after the clubs other shareholders approved a deal that saw their stake in the club increase to 85% and decrease Smith &amp; Wynn-Jones stake to 10%. As part of the deal, Attanasio appointed businessman Richard Ressler to the board as a club director, while Smith &amp; Wynn-Jones agreed to step down from their roles as club directors to become honorary life presidents.

=== Other work ===
Along with Brewers assistant general manager Gord Ash and former Brewers pitcher Ben Sheets, Attanasio is also a part-owner of the American Hockey League&#x27;s Milwaukee Admirals.

He was a major sponsor of the widely acclaimed Andy Warhol exhibition at the Milwaukee Art Museum.

He is also on the board of directors for LA28.

== Personal life ==
Mark is the brother of television writer Paul Attanasio. He is married to Deborah (&quot;née&quot; Kaplan) and has two sons, Dan and Mike. His eldest son Dan and his rock band, Pan Am, performed at Summerfest 2008 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

<doc id="1025557" wikidata="Q113173" url="?curid=1025557" title="Gennady Yanayev">
<text>Gennady Ivanovich Yanayev (; 26 August 193724 September 2010) was a Soviet politician and disputed President of the Soviet Union for three days. Yanayev&#x27;s political career spanned the rules of Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Andropov and Chernenko, and culminated during the Gorbachev years. Yanayev was born in Perevoz, Gorky Oblast. After years in local politics, he rose to prominence as Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, but he also held other lesser posts such as deputy of the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.

Due to his chairmanship of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, in 1990 he gained a seat in the 28th Politburo and Secretary of the Central Committee. Later that year, on 27 December, with the help of Mikhail Gorbachev, Yanayev was elected the first, and only, Vice President of the Soviet Union. Having growing doubts about where Gorbachev&#x27;s reforms were leading, Yanayev started working with, and eventually formally leading, the Gang of Eight, the group which deposed Gorbachev during the August 1991 coup d&#x27;état attempt. After three days, the coup collapsed, in part due to Western backing of Boris Yeltsin; during its brief grip of power, Yanayev was made Acting President of the Soviet Union. He was then arrested for his role in the coup, but in 1994 he was pardoned. He spent the rest of his life working in the Russian tourism administration until his death on 24 September 2010.

==Early life and career==
Yanayev was born on 26 August 1937 in the town of Perevoz, Gorky Oblast during the administration of Joseph Stalin as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He graduated from the Gorky Institute of Agriculture in 1959. After graduation he worked as the head of a mechanised agricultural unit and later as a chief engineer in the Gorky Oblast. He applied and officially became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in 1962. From 1963 to 1968, he held the positions of second, and subsequently first, secretary of the Gorky Komsomol, and later became Chairman of the Committee of Youth Organisations, which he held for 12 years. From 1980 to 1986 he was Deputy Chairman of the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. He became Secretary for International Affairs of All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions in 1986 and became Deputy Chairman of the trade unions in 1989. In April 1990 he was elected Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions. As chairman of the trade unions, he was not able to quell the growing labour discontent in the country, but his position granted him a seat in the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) at the 28th CPSU Congress (held in 1990), alongside his election as Secretary of the Central Committee.

==Vice president==

On 27 December 1990, Mikhail Gorbachev proposed Yanayev as Vice President of the Soviet Union. He was Gorbachev&#x27;s third choice for the post; Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev had turned the offer down. Yanayev had initially been rejected by the Supreme Soviet, but he was finally approved by a second vote due to Gorbachev&#x27;s insistence, (by a vote of 1,237 for to 563 against), only days after Shevardnadze had resigned from office due to Gorbachev&#x27;s willingness to give leeway to conservatives. Yanayev said after the vote &quot;I am a Communist to the depths of my soul.&quot;

Some weeks after Yanayev&#x27;s election, a senior Soviet official described Yanayev as &quot;Gorbachev&#x27;s Quayle—a conservative nonentity, no threat to Gorbachev, and his selection would pacify the right-wing&quot;. At the beginning of January 1991, Yanayev headed a committee working on the formation of a new cabinet. Later, he was sent to the Soviet city of Kuznetsk to negotiate with a newly formed independent trade union, making this the first time since 1917 that a Russian government official had negotiated with a trade union; however, after gaining the attention of the Soviet government, the unionists withdrew their plans for a strike.

===August Coup===

Shortly after taking office, Yanayev joined a group of more conservative Communist politicians, led by KGB chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov, who hoped to persuade Gorbachev to declare a state of emergency. After Gorbachev announced his proposal for a New Union Treaty to form the Union of Sovereign States, as a reorganisation of the Soviet Union into a new confederation, he went on vacation to his dacha in Crimea. Believing that this new Union treaty would lead to the disintegration of the USSR, the State Committee of the State of Emergency placed Gorbachev under house arrest on 19 August, one day before the treaty was due to be signed. On that same day the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS) issued the coup plotters&#x27; decree, which stated: &quot;Owing to the conditions of his health, Mikhail Gorbachev is no longer capable of carrying on the duties of the President of the USSR. In accordance with article 127, clause 7 of the USSR constitution, Vice President Gennady Yanayev has assumed the duties of the President of the USSR.&quot;

The decree made references to the growing problems facing the country such as ethnic tensions, political confrontations and chaos, which according to the coup leaders threatened the very existence of Soviet life and the territorial integrity of the USSR. Yanayev further claimed that the danger of collapse was imminent, and if the economic situation was not handled quickly, the Soviet Union would collapse. In addition, Yanayev and the rest of the state committee ordered the Cabinet of Ministers to alter the then current five-year plan to relieve the housing shortage. All city-dwellers were given one third of an acre each to combat winter food shortages by growing fruit and vegetables. When asked about Gorbachev, Yanayev replied: &quot;Let me say that Mikhail Gorbachev is now on vacation. He is undergoing treatment, himself, in our country. He is very tired after these many years and he will need some time to get better.&quot; At a press conference, Yanayev&#x27;s hands were shaking rather violently, leading many journalists to focus on Yanayev&#x27;s apparent drunkenness instead of Gorbachev&#x27;s alleged bad health.

On 19 August, citizens of Moscow gathered around Russia&#x27;s White House and began to erect barricades around it, in which at 16:00 Yanayev responded by declaring a state of emergency in Moscow. Yanayev declared at the press conference at 17:00 that Gorbachev was &quot;resting&quot;. He said: &quot;Over these years he has become very tired and needs some time to get his health back.&quot; Yanayev said the Emergency Committee was committed to continuing his reforms. However, Yanayev&#x27;s weak posture, trembling hands and shaky expressions made his words unconvincing. On August 21, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, chaired by the heads of the chambers of the union parliament, adopted a resolution in which it declared illegal the actual dismissal of President Gorbachev from his duties and the transfer of them to the country&#x27;s vice-president and, in this regard, demanded that Vice-President Yanayev cancel the decrees and emergency orders based on them. According to some historians, Yanayev was the most visible and powerful member of the Emergency Committee but was not its mastermind; Kryuchkov has been described as the &quot;heart and soul of the conspiracy&quot;. Yanayev only agreed to head the Emergency Committee on 20 August. Along with the other coup leaders, such as Valentin Pavlov and Boris Pugo for instance, Yanayev was dismissed as vice president and later jailed for his crimes against the Soviet state.

In 1993, Moscow weekly &quot;Novy Vzglyad&quot; quoted Yanayev as admitting that he was drunk when he signed the decree which made him acting president, but saying that inebriation had not affected his judgment. In a 2008 interview, Yanayev said he regretted making himself acting President, further claiming that he was pressured by the more conservative members to sign the documents which declared his own presidency. He described the events of 1991 as a burden for the rest of his life.

==Later life and death==
Yanayev was released on recognizance not to leave in January 1993. He was pardoned in 1994. He would eventually become the head of the Department of History and International Relations of the Russian International Academy of Tourism. 

On 20 September 2010, Yanayev fell ill and was hospitalised at the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow, where he was diagnosed with lung cancer. He died on 24 September 2010. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) expressed their condolences to Yanayev&#x27;s family. Gennady Zyuganov, the leader of the CPRF, said of him: &quot;Yanayev lived an interesting, complicated and worthy life.&quot; The CPRF officially praised him as &quot;a highly professional specialist ... a dear and trustworthy comrade&quot;. In another statement made by the CPRF, this time on their official website, they claimed: &quot;If they had acted much more decisively, our unified country would have been preserved.&quot; He was buried at the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery, in a ceremony attended by several prominent CPRF members. He was survived by his wife and two daughters.

<text>Nanyang University () was a private university in Singapore between 1956 and 1980. During its existence, it was Singapore&#x27;s only private university in the Chinese language. In 1980, Nanyang University was merged with the University of Singapore to form the National University of Singapore (NUS). It was not until 2005 that another private school in Singapore, SIM University, was established.

==History==
=== Establishment ===

The idea of a Chinese university in Singapore to provide higher education to the Chinese community was first mooted by Tan Lark Sye in 1953, then chairman of the Singapore Hokkien Association. A fund was set up for this purpose, drawing donations from people of all walks of life and with Tan himself donating $5 million. The Singapore Hokkien Association donated 500 acres (2 km2) in the western Jurong area, which was then largely undeveloped rural land.

Nanyang University conducted a flag-raising on 15 March 1956 and started classes on the 30th of that month, offering courses in the arts, sciences and commerce. The first phase of the university building programme was completed two years later, and the university held its official opening ceremony 30 March 1958, with the Governor of Singapore William Goode as guest of honour.

=== External Reviews ===
In January 1959, the Government of Singapore and the university commissioned the first major review of the university. Led by Professor S. L. Prescott, the commission reported unfavourably on the administration of the university, library and laboratory facilities, academic staff and terms of employment, research culture, and curriculum. The commission refused to recommend that the government recognise Nantah degrees.

In July 1959, Dr Gwee Ah Leng (魏雅聆) chaired a commission to follow up on the Prescott report. The Gwee commission submitted its report in November 1959, which was published by the Legislative Assembly in February 1960. The Gwee commission recommended that recruitment of students be broadened to other language streams, the learning of the national language, Malay, and wider use of English in instruction.

In January 1965, Professor Wang Gungwu of the University of Malaya was appointed to chair a committee to review the curriculum of Nanyang University. The Committee reported in May 1965. Meanwhile, in August 1965, Singapore separated from the Federation of Malaysia as an independent republic. In September 1965, the committee was released, and the university accepted the recommendations, triggering students protests, petitions, and boycotts of classes and examinations.

=== Merger with the University of Singapore ===
In the 1970s, Nanyang University encountered problems in student enrolments as many students were attending English-language schools. Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew prompted the university to adopt English language within five years. Subsequently, in the same year in March, a joint campus scheme was introduced to allow students from Nanyang University to jointly study with students from the University of Singapore.

In 1979, Lee invited British academic Frederick Dainton to present his views on the future of university education in Singapore. He suggested merging Nanyang University and the University of Singapore into the latter&#x27;s campus at Kent Ridge.

His proposal gained the support of the government, and in April 1980, the merger was confirmed.

Nanyang University&#x27;s 21st and last convocation was held on 16 August 1980. That same month, the National University of Singapore Act took effect, legally merging the University of Singapore and Nanyang University to form the National University of Singapore (NUS).

==Logo==
The three circles in the logo represent values long held to be important in Chinese tradition. They represent a trinity of values: people, progress and productivity. The linking shows the interdependence between the need for people to work together productively and achieve progress. This symbol can now be seen in the National University of Singapore&#x27;s crest. The circle with the yellow star represents people, signifying the importance placed on human capital in Singapore.

== Relationship with Nanyang Technological University ==

After Nanyang University was merged with the University of Singapore, the grounds formerly occupied by Nanyang University were occupied by a similarly named technical institute, the Nanyang Technological Institute (NTI), in 1981. In 1991, the NTI was upgraded to the status of a university as Singapore&#x27;s second English-medium university and became the Nanyang Technological University (NTU).

===Chinese Heritage Centre===
In 1995, the former Nanyang University Library and Administration Building was reopened as the Chinese Heritage Centre, an autonomous research institute of Nanyang Technological University. It was the first and only university institute in the world that specialises in the study of the ethnic Chinese communities from different parts of the world. It currently served as a research centre, a library and a museum.

===Proposed renaming of Nanyang Technological University as Nanyang University===
The NTU administration announced in 2003 a decision to rename Nanyang Technological University as Nanyang University by 2005, justifying the move based on the university&#x27;s introduction of non-technology-related schools and its expansion into a full multidisciplinary university. In 2004, the administration announced that the renaming would be held off, citing a need to establish itself in other fields of study first.

<text>Relationship marketing is a form of marketing developed from direct response marketing campaigns that emphasizes customer retention and satisfaction rather than sales transactions. It differentiates from other forms of marketing in that it recognises the long-term value of customer relationships and extends communication beyond intrusive advertising and sales promotional messages. 

With the growth of the Internet and mobile platforms, relationship marketing has continued to evolve as technology opens more collaborative and social communication channels such as tools for managing relationships with customers that go beyond demographics and customer service data collection. Relationship marketing extends to include inbound marketing, a combination of search optimization and strategic content, public relations, social media and application development.

==Development==

Relationship marketing refers to an arrangement where both the buyer and seller have an interest in a more satisfying exchange. This approach aims to transcend the post-purchase-exchange process with a customer in order to make richer contact by providing a more personalised purchase, and using the experience to create stronger ties. A main focus on a long-term relationship with customers differentiates relationship marketing from other marketing techniques.

The technique was first proposed by American marketing scholars Berry (1983) and Jackson (1985). Berry (1983) argued in a conference about the field of service marketing that relationship marketing is a marketing activity for enterprises to obtain, maintain and promote effective relationships with customers. After a long-term study on the marketing process of the service industry, it was concluded that the ultimate goal of enterprise marketing is not only to develop new customers but also to focus on maintaining existing customers. Ultimately, the goal is to improve the long-term interests of both parties through cooperative relationships. The study also argues that the cost of maintaining an old customer is far lower than the cost of developing a new customer and that maintaining a relationship with old consumers is more economical than developing new customers. 

Jackson (1985) further modified the concept in the aspect of industry marketing. He argued that the essence of relationship marketing is to attract, establish and maintain a close relationship with enterprise customers. Furthermore, other studies have concluded that the essence of relationship marketing is the actual maintenance of existing customers, which creates long-term interest in a product. This research conclusion has been generally recognised since the original proposal for relationship marketing. The research scope, however, is limited to the relationship with old customers, easily ignoring the dynamic development of customers because long-term customers are developed from new customers. If an enterprise is restricted to the maintenance of existing customers, it is impossible for it to achieve any progress or compete in the market since it cannot attract long-term customers in the first place.

From a social anthropological perspective, relationship marketing theory and practice can be interpreted as commodity exchange that instrumentalises features of gift exchange. Marketers, consciously or intuitively, are recognizing reciprocity, a &#x27;pre-modern&#x27; form of exchange, and have begun to use it.

Thus, relationship marketing revolves around gaining loyal customers. According to Liam Alvey, relationship marketing can be applied where there are competitive product alternatives for customers to choose from and an ongoing desire for that product. Research studying relationship marketing suggests that companies can do this through one of the three value strategies: best price, best product or best service. Hence companies can relay their relationship marketing message through value statements.

The practice of relationship marketing has been facilitated by several generations of customer relationship management software, which track and analyze each customer&#x27;s preferences and activities. For example, an automobile manufacturer maintaining a database of when and how repeat customers buy their products, including data concerning their choices and purchase financing, can more efficiently develop one-to-one marketing offers and product benefits. Moreover, extensive use of such software is found in web applications. A consumer shopping profile can be built as a person shops online and is then used to compute his likely preferences. These curated and predicted offerings can then be presented to the customer through cross-sell, email recommendation and other channels.

Relationship marketing has also migrated back into direct mail. Marketers can use the technological capabilities of digital, toner-based printing presses to produce unique, personalised pieces for each recipient through variable data printing. They can personalise documents by information contained in their databases, including name, address, demographics, purchase history and dozens to hundreds of other variables. The result is a printed piece that reflects the individual needs and preferences of each recipient, increasing the relevance of the piece and increasing the response rate.

==Scope==
Additionally, relationship marketing has been strongly influenced by reengineering. According to process reengineering theory, organizations should be structured according to complete tasks and processes rather than functions. Thus cross-function teams should be responsible for a whole process from beginning to end rather than having the work go from one functional department to another, whereas traditional marketing uses the functional (or &#x27;silo&#x27;) department approach where stages of production are handled by different departments. The legacy of traditional marketing can still be seen in the traditional four Ps of the marketing mix: pricing, product management, promotion, and placement. According to Gordon (1999), the marketing mix approach is too limited to provide a usable framework for assessing and developing customer relationships in many industries and should be replaced by the relationship marketing alternative model where the focus is on customers, relationships and interaction over time rather than markets and products.

In contrast, relationship marketing is cross-functional, organised around processes that involve all aspects of an organization. Some commentators prefer to call relationship marketing &#x27;relationship management&#x27; because it involves much more than that which is included in normal marketing.

Because of its broad scope, relationship marketing can be effective in many contexts. As well as being relevant to &#x27;for profit&#x27; businesses, research indicates that relationship marketing can be useful for organizations in the voluntary sector and in the public sector.

Martin Christopher, Adrian Payne and David Ballantyne at the Cranfield School of Management claim that relationship marketing has the potential to forge a synthesis between quality management, customer service management and marketing.

==Approaches==

===Satisfaction===
Relationship marketing relies on the communication and acquisition of consumer requirements solely from existing customers in a mutually beneficial exchange usually involving permission for contact by the customer through an opt-in system. With particular relevance to customer satisfaction, the relative price and quality of goods and services produced or sold through a company alongside customer service generally determine the amount of sales relative to that of competing companies. Although groups targeted through relationship marketing may be large, accuracy of communication and overall relevance to the customer remains higher than that of direct marketing.

===Retention===
A principle of relationship marketing is the retention of customers in order to ensure repeated trade from preexisting customers by satisfying requirements above those of competing companies through a mutually beneficial relationship. This technique balances new customers and opportunities with current and existing customers to maximise profit and counteracts the leaky bucket theory of business, where new customers in older direct marketing-oriented businesses are gained at the expense of the loss of older customers. This process of &#x27;churning&#x27; is less economically viable than retaining all or the majority of customers using both direct and relationship management because securing new customers requires more investment.

Many companies in competing markets redirect or allocate large amounts of resources towards customer retention. In markets with increasing competition, attracting new customers may cost up to five times more than retaining current customers because direct or &#x27;offensive&#x27; marketing requires much more to cause defection from competitors. However, it is suggested that because extensive classic marketing theories center on means of attracting customers and creating transactions rather than maintaining them, the predominant usage of direct marketing used in the past is now gradually being used more with relationship marketing as the latter&#x27;s importance becomes more recognizable.

Reichheld and Sasser (1990) claim that a 5% improvement in customer retention can cause an increase in profitability of between 25 and 85 percent in terms of net present value depending on the industry. However, Carrol and Reichheld dispute these calculations, claiming that they result from faulty cross-sectional analysis. Research by John Fleming and Jim Asplund indicates that engaged customers generate 1.7 times more revenue than normal customers while having engaged employees and engaged customers returns a revenue gain of 3.4 times the normal return.

According to Buchanan and Gilles, the increased profitability associated with customer retention efforts occurs because of several factors once a relationship has been established with a customer:
* The cost of acquisition occurs only at the beginning of a relationship. The longer a relationship, the lower the amortised cost.
* Account maintenance costs decline as a percentage of total costs or as a percentage of revenue.
* Long-term customers tend to be less inclined to switch products and also tend to be less price-sensitive. This can result in stable unit sales volume and increases in dollar-sales volume.
* They also may provide free word-of-mouth promotions and referrals.
* Furthermore, they are more likely to purchase ancillary products and high-profit margin supplemental products.
* Customers who stay with a company tend to be satisfied with the relationship and are less likely to switch to competitors, increasing the difficulty for competitors to enter the market or gain market share.
* Regular customers tend to be less expensive to service because they are familiar with the process, require less &#x27;education&#x27; and are consistent in their order placement.
* Increased customer retention and loyalty makes employees&#x27; jobs easier and more satisfying. In turn, happy employees increase customer satisfaction in a virtuous circle.

The relationship ladder of customer loyalty groups types of customers according to their level of loyalty. The ladder&#x27;s first rung consists of prospects, non-customers who are likely to become customers in the future. This is followed by the successive rungs of customer, client, supporter, advocate, and partner. The relationship marketer&#x27;s objective is to &#x27;help&#x27; customers climb the ladder as high up as possible. This usually involves providing more personalised service and providing service quality that exceeds expectations at each step.

Customer retention efforts involve multiple considerations:
# Customer valuation – Gordon (1999) describes how to value customers and categorise them according to their financial and strategic value so that companies can decide where to invest for deeper relationships and which relationships need to be served differently or even terminated.
# Customer retention measurement – Dawkins and Reichheld (1990) calculated a company&#x27;s customer retention rate. This is the percentage of customers at the beginning of the year that are still customers by the end of the year. In accordance with this statistic, an increase in retention rate from 80% to 90% is associated with a doubling of the average life of a customer relationship from 5 to 10 years. This ratio can be used to make comparisons between products, between market segments, and over time.
# Determining reasons for defection – It comprises investigating root causes, not mere symptoms. This involves probing for details when contacting former customers. Other techniques include the analysis of customers&#x27; complaints and competitive benchmarking (see competitor analysis).
# Developing and implementing a corrective plan – This could involve actions to improve employee practices, using benchmarking to determine best corrective practices, visible endorsement of top management, adjustments to the company&#x27;s reward and recognition systems, and the use of recovery teams to eliminate the causes of defections.

A technique to calculate the value to a firm of a sustained customer relationship has been developed. This calculation is typically called customer lifetime value, a prediction of the net profit of a customer&#x27;s relationship with a company.

Retention strategies may also include building barriers to customer switching by product bundling (combining several products or services into one package and offering them at a single price), cross-selling (selling related products to current customers), cross-promotions (giving discounts or other promotional incentives to purchasers of related products), loyalty programs (giving incentives for frequent purchases), increasing switching costs (adding termination costs such as mortgage termination fees), and integrating computer systems of multiple organizations (primarily in industrial marketing).

Many relationship marketers use a team-based approach due to the concept that the more points of contact between the organization and customer, the stronger the bond and the more secure the relationship.

==Application==
Relationship marketing and traditional or transactional marketing are not mutually exclusive, and there is no need for a conflict between them. In practice, a relationship-oriented marketer still has choices depending on the situation. Most firms blend the two approaches in order to reach a short-term marketing goal or long-term marketing strategy. Many products have a service component to them, which has been growing in recent decades. 

Relationship marketing aims to strengthen the relationship with clients and secure them. Morgan and Hunt (1994) made a distinction between economic and social exchange on the basis of exchange theory and concluded that the basic guarantee of social exchange was the spirit of the contract of trust and commitment. The transition from economic exchange theory to social exchange theory is where the one-time transaction&#x27;s prevalence is reduced. 

Besides, the theoretical core of enterprise relationship marketing in this period is the cooperative relationship based on commitment, which defines relationship marketing from the perspective of exchange theory and emphasizes that relationship marketing is an activity related to the progress, maintenance and development of all marketing activities. The theory states that trading enterprises are composed of trust and commitment and that the basis of marketing activities to establish long-term relations. Factors affecting cooperation from both sides include communication, power, cost and benefit and opportunism behavior; but the relationship effect is mainly formed by trust and commitment. Moreover, Copulsky and Wolf (1990) introduced terminology like &#x27;one to one&#x27; marketing that leverages IT to target customers with specific offers. 

Enterprise has an incentive to improve the effect of relationships with customer. When access to data and information that improves the relationship with the customer has a low cost, enterprises pay the cost in order to improve relations with customers. Due to the development of communication and Internet technology, information costs have decreased substantially. Liker and Klamath (1998) introduced the relationship between enterprises and suppliers into the scope of relational marketing, claiming that in the marketing process manufacturers make suppliers assume corresponding responsibilities and enable them to exploit technological and resource advantages in the production process, improving their marketing innovation. 

Lukas and Ferrell (2000) believe that the implementation of customer-oriented marketing can greatly promote marketing innovation and encourage enterprises to break through the traditional relationship model between enterprises and customers and propose new products. Lethe (2006) confirms the relationship between enterprises and customers through the observation of the benchmarking customer research, finding a positive correlation to innovation. He posits that good relations between enterprises and customers results in more efficient benchmarking, identifying new potential products, reduce the cost of new product development and increase market acceptance of products. Also he proposes that all relationships established with relevant parties for enterprise marketing are centered on the establishment of good customer relations: the core concept of relationship marketing is maintaining a relationship with customers. 

Guinness (1994) propounds that relationship marketing is a consciousness that regards the marketing process as the interaction between enterprises and various aspects of relationships and networks. According to his research, enterprise faces four relations: its relationship with the macro-environment, that with the micro-environment, market relations and relations with a special market. In addition, enterprises in the implementation of relationship marketing are often able to use networks to promote all aspects of relationship coordination and progress.

===Internal marketing===
Relationship marketing stresses internal marketing, which is using a marketing orientation within an organization itself. Many relationship marketing attributes like collaboration, loyalty and trust determine internal customers&#x27; words and actions. According to this theory, every employee, team and department in the company is simultaneously a supplier and a customer of services and products. An employee obtains a service at a point in the value chain and then provides a service to another employee further along the value chain. If internal marketing is effective, every employee both provides and receives exceptional service to and from other employees. It also helps employees understand the significance of their roles and how their roles relate to others&#x27;. If implemented well, it can encourage every employee to see the process in terms of the customer&#x27;s perception of value and the organization&#x27;s strategic mission. Further, an effective internal marketing program is a prerequisite for effective external marketing efforts (W. George 1990).

===Six markets model===
Christopher, Payne and Ballantyne (1991) identify six markets which they note as central to relationship marketing: internal markets, supplier markets, recruitment markets, referral markets, influence markets and customer markets. They refer to Berry&#x27;s work (1983), which drew attention to the need to engage with internal stakeholders such as employees to ensure that they are capable and willing to deliver the value proposition on offer. 

Referral marketing is the development and implementation of a marketing plan in order to stimulate referrals. Marketing to suppliers is aimed at ensuring a long-term conflict-free relationship in which all parties understand the others&#x27; needs and exceed their expectations. Such a strategy can reduce costs and improve quality. Meanwhile, Influence markets involve a wide range of sub-markets, including government regulators, standards bodies, lobbyists, stockholders, bankers, venture capitalists, financial analysts, stockbrokers, consumer associations, environmental associations and labor associations. These activities are typically carried out by the public relations department, but relationship marketers believe that marketing to all six markets is the responsibility of everyone in an organization. Each market may require its own explicit strategies and marketing mix.

===Live-in marketing===

Live-in marketing (LIM) is a variant of marketing and advertising in which the target consumer is allowed to sample or use a product in a relaxed atmosphere over a long period of time. Much like product placement in film and television, LIM was developed as a means to reach select target demographics in a non-invasive and much less garish manner than traditional advertising. While LIM represents an entirely untapped avenue of marketing, it is not an entirely novel idea. With the rising popularity of experiential and event marketing in North America and Europe and the relatively high ROI in terms of advertising dollars spent on experiential marketing compared to traditional big media advertising, industry analysts see LIM as a natural progression.

LIM functions around the premise that marketing or advertising agencies aim to appeal to companies&#x27; target demographic. Avenues such as sponsorship or direct product placement and sampling are explored in turn. Unlike traditional event marketing, LIM suggests that end-users can sample the product or service in a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere. The theory posits that the end-user will have as positive as possible an interaction with the given brand, thereby leading to word-of-mouth communication and potential future purchases.

<doc id="1025573" wikidata="Q382145" url="?curid=1025573" title="Vladimir Kryuchkov">
<text>Vladimir Aleksandrovich Kryuchkov (; 29 February 1924 – 23 November 2007) was a Soviet lawyer, diplomat, and head of the KGB, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU.

Initially working in the Soviet justice system as a prosecutor&#x27;s assistant, Kryuchkov then graduated from the Diplomatic Academy of the Soviet Foreign Ministry and became a diplomat. During his years in the foreign service, he met Yuri Andropov, who became his main patron. From 1974 until 1988, Kryuchkov headed the foreign intelligence branch of the KGB, the First Chief Directorate (PGU). During these years, the Directorate was involved in funding and supporting various communist, socialist, and anti-colonial movements across the world, some of which came to power in their countries and established pro-Soviet governments; in addition, under Kryuchkov&#x27;s leadership the Directorate had major triumphs in penetrating Western intelligence agencies, acquiring valuable scientific and technical intelligence and perfecting the techniques of disinformation and active measures. At the same time, during his tenure the Directorate became plagued with defectors and had the major responsibility for encouraging the Soviet government to invade Afghanistan, and its ability to influence Western European communist parties diminished even further.

From 1988 until 1991, Kryuchkov served as the 7th Chairman of the KGB. He was the leader of the abortive August coup and its governing committee.

==Early life and career==
Kryuchkov was born in February 1924 in Tsaritsyn (later called Stalingrad, now Volgograd), to a working-class family. His parents were strong supporters of Joseph Stalin. He joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1944 and became a full-time employee of the Communist Youth League (Komsomol). After earning a law degree, Kryuchkov embarked on a career in the Soviet justice system, working as an investigator for the prosecutor&#x27;s office in his home city of Stalingrad.

==Diplomatic service==
Kryuchkov then joined the Soviet diplomatic service, stationed in Hungary until 1959. He next worked for the Communist Party Central Committee for eight years, before joining the KGB in 1967 together with his patron Yuri Andropov. He was appointed head of the First Chief Directorate in the summer of 1971, upon the order of Andropov, and deputy chairman in 1978. In June 1978, he traveled to Afghanistan, and in July 1978 became the KGB rezident in Kabul where he took a very active part in the overthrow of its government at the beginning of the Soviet–Afghan War. In 1988, he was promoted to the rank of General of the Army and became KGB Chairman. In 1989–1990, he was a member of the Politburo.

A political hard-liner, Kryuchkov was among the members of the Soviet intelligence community who misinterpreted the 1983 NATO exercise Able Archer 83 as a prelude to a pre-emptive nuclear strike. Many historians, such as Robert Cowley and John Lewis Gaddis, believe the Able Archer incident was the closest the world has come to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.

== KGB chairmanship ==
After KGB Chairman Viktor Chebrikov sided with General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s rival Yegor Ligachyov in opposition to glasnost and perestroika, he was replaced by Kryuchkov in October 1988. Kryuchkov also opposed Gorbachev&#x27;s reforms, and in his memoirs defended Stalinism and condemned most reforms to the Soviet political system since the rule of Nikita Khrushchev. His appointment by Gorbachev despite this was because he had specialized primarily in foreign intelligence rather than domestic services. Kryuchkov had also been recommended by Gorbachev&#x27;s predecessor and mentor Andropov and his reformist colleague Alexander Yakovlev.

After the 1990 Soviet constitutional reforms, Kryuchkov began working with other hardline officials in the new presidential cabinet such as Boris Pugo, Valentin Pavlov, and Gennady Yanayev to undermine Gorbachev&#x27;s rule. This group of eight ministers eventually became the State Committee on the State of Emergency (GKChP). 

Gorbachev attempted to appease Kryuchkov with a presidential decree expanding the powers of the KGB, and ordered him to keep the anti-Communist RSFSR President Boris Yeltsin and the dissident leader Andrei Sakharov under surveillance. Kryuchkov&#x27;s intelligence may have deceived Gorbachev into underestimating the risk to his rule and distancing himself in favor of his old reformist colleagues in favor of the hardliners.

According to Sergei Tretyakov, Kryuchkov secretly sent US$50 billion worth of Communist Party funds to an unknown location in the lead up to the collapse of the Soviet Union.

=== August Coup ===

Kryuchkov&#x27;s strategy eventually shifted to a coup d&#x27;état in which a state of emergency would enable the KGB to restore the Soviet Union&#x27;s hardline Communist political system.

During the August coup of 1991, Kryuchkov was the initiator of creation of the GKChP which arrested President Gorbachev. However, the coup failed because of the indecisiveness of Kryuchkov and the other conspirators. Kryuchkov notably mobilized the Alpha Group to arrest Yeltsin but then refused to give it the order to do so. Kryuchkov had also allowed the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to assume control of domestic KGB activity under its jurisdiction after Chairman Yeltsin&#x27;s Declaration of State Sovereignty of Russia. Many Russian KGB agents had demonstrated their loyalty to the new government by defying Kryuchkov&#x27;s order to vote against Yeltsin in the 1991 Russian presidential election. After the defeat of the committee, Kryuchkov was imprisoned for his participation. Kryuchkov was replaced as chairman of the KGB by Vadim Bakatin, released on recognizance not to leave in January 1993.

Many analysts of the Soviet Union at the time and since, including former U.S. Ambassador Jack F. Matlock Jr., have held that Kryuchkov was inadvertently responsible for the collapse of the Soviet Union by staging the coup and destroying the Communist Party&#x27;s authority. Matlock wrote in his memoir &quot;People do make a difference, and Vladimir Kryuchkov made a big difference. The Soviet Union might exist in some modified form today if another person had been running the KGB in 1990 and 1991.&quot;

Immediately after the collapse of the coup Kryuchkov unsuccessfully requested a pardon for himself and his co-conspirators on the basis of their old age. On 3 July 1992, Kryuchkov appealed to Russian president Boris Yeltsin, accusing him of laying the blame for the dissolution of the Soviet Union on members of the State Committee on the State of Emergency. Kryuchkov was finally freed in 1994 with a pardon by the State Duma. He subsequently returned to public life with writings condemning Gorbachev&#x27;s rule. His writings improved his reputation with the Russian public, with a 2007 Levada Center poll revealing that only 12 percent of respondents would have actively opposed his coup. On 7 May 2000, Kryuchkov attended the first inauguration of Vladimir Putin as President of Russia.

==Family==
His son was a resident of Switzerland in the 1990s where very large sums were transiting during the 1990s looting of Russia. Yevgeny Primakov blocked the Duma&#x27;s Ponomarev investigative commission from accessing KGB, FCD, and SVR documents.

==Death==
Kryuchkov died at the age of 83 on 23 November 2007. His body was buried at the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery in Moscow.

<doc id="1025576" wikidata="Q882388" url="?curid=1025576" title="The Bloody Chamber">
<text>The Bloody Chamber (or The Bloody Chamber and Other Stories) is a collection of short stories by English writer Angela Carter. It was first published in the United Kingdom in 1979 by Gollancz and won the Cheltenham Festival Literary Prize. The stories are all based on fairytales or folk tales. However, Carter has stated:

The collection contains ten stories: &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot;, &quot;The Courtship of Mr Lyon&quot;, &quot;The Tiger&#x27;s Bride&quot;, &quot;Puss-in-Boots&quot;, &quot;The Erl-King&quot;, &quot;The Snow Child&quot;, &quot;The Lady of the House of Love&quot;, &quot;The Werewolf&quot;, &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot; and &quot;Wolf-Alice&quot;.

The tales vary greatly in length, with the novelette &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot; being &quot;more than twice the length of any of the other stories, and more than thirty times the length of the shortest [the vignette &quot;The Snow Child&quot;].&quot;

The collection&#x27;s contents are also reprinted in Carter&#x27;s &quot;Burning Your Boats&quot;.

==Story summaries==
The stories within &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot; are explicitly based on fairy tales. Carter was no doubt inspired by the works of author and fairytale collector Charles Perrault, whose fairy tales she had translated shortly beforehand.

===The Bloody Chamber===
(Based on &quot;Bluebeard&quot;.)

The narrator, a beautiful teenage girl, marries an older, wealthy French Marquis, who met her while she was playing the piano at a tea-party. Her governess, though pleased she has made a good match, notes the Marquis has formerly wed three women, all of whom died in mysterious circumstances. He gifts his bride a choker made of rubies, warning her against taking it off, and takes her to his coastal castle in Brittany, where she discovers his collection of pornographic engravings and paintings. He takes pleasure in her embarrassment, and they consummate their marriage that night, in a bedroom filled with white lilies and mirrors. The following morning, he hears of urgent business he must attend to in New York. When he leaves, he entrusts her with a chain of keys, telling her she can use them to go about the castle as she wishes. He forbids her from using a certain key, telling her it opens his private den. She tries to grow accustomed to her new-found decadence, but, being a talented pianist, feels most comfortable with the blind piano-tuner. Closer to her age, he lives in a nearby town and, after tuning the piano her husband gave to her as a wedding present, asks to hear her play once in a while. But still, her husband&#x27;s absence makes her feel melancholy, and she telephones her mother. Afterwards, she starts going through the Marquis&#x27; things in order to learn more about him. After going through his desk, she learns more of his previous wives, which pushes her to take the forbidden key and enter his chamber. She soon realizes the full extent of his perverse and murderous tendencies when she discovers the bodies of his previous wives, presented in gruesome ways, some of which are surrounded by the same white lilies the Marquis filled her own room with. In her shock, she drops the key, staining it with the blood on the floor. When she meets the piano-tuner again, she confides the newly discovered secret to him. Before the two can flee, the Marquis returns home, his business trip having been cut short. Unable to clean the blood from the key, the Marquis discovers that she has entered the bloody chamber and presses the key into her forehead, leaving a red mark. He decides to kill her by execution upon a chopping block. The brave piano tuner is willing to stay and accompany her even though he knows he will not be able to save her. She is saved at the last moment at the end of the story by her mother, who bursts into the castle and shoots the Marquis just as he is about to behead the girl in the courtyard. The girl, her mother, and the piano tuner go on to live together and the young widow opens a little music school on the outskirts of Paris. Most of the money she inherited is given away to various charities and the castle is turned into a school for the blind. However, the girl is still stained with a red mark on her forehead with the key.

===The Courtship of Mr Lyon===
(Based on&quot; Beauty and the Beast&quot; – the concept of the Beast as a lion-like figure is a popular one, most notably in the French film version of 1946.)

Beauty&#x27;s father, after experiencing car trouble, takes advantage of a stranger&#x27;s hospitality. However, his benefactor – the Beast – take umbrage when he steals a miraculous white rose for his beloved daughter. Beauty becomes the guest of the leonine Beast, and the Beast aids her father in getting his fortune back. Beauty later joins her father in London, where she almost forgets the Beast, causing him to wither away from heartache. When Beauty learns that he is dying, she returns, saving him. Beauty and the Beast disclose their love for one another and the Beast&#x27;s humanity is revealed. They live happily ever after.

===The Tiger&#x27;s Bride===
(Also based on &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. )

A woman moves in with a mysterious, masked &quot;Milord&quot;, the Beast, after her father loses her to him in a game of cards. Milord is eventually revealed to be a tiger. In a reversal of the ending of &quot;The Courtship of Mr Lyon&quot;, the heroine transforms at the end into a glorious tigress who is the proper mate to the Beast, who will from now on be true to his own nature and not disguise himself as a human. The story has similarities to the Indian story &quot;The Brahman Girl That Married a Tiger&quot; as well as ending elements of &quot;The Frog Prince&quot;.

===Puss-in-Boots===
(Based on &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; and similar to &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;.)

Figaro, a cat, moves in with a rakish young man who lives a happily debauched life. They live a carefree existence, with the cat helping him to make money by cheating at cards, until the young man actually falls in love (to the cat&#x27;s disgust) with a young woman kept in a tower by a miserly, older husband who treats her only as property. The cat, hoping his friend will tire of the woman if he has her, helps the young man into the bed of his sweetheart by playing tricks on the old husband and the young woman&#x27;s keeper. Figaro himself finds love with the young woman&#x27;s cat, and the two cats arrange the fortunes of both themselves and the young man and woman by arranging to trip the old man so that he will fall to his death.

Angela Carter had described Puss in Boots as &quot;the Cat as Con Man... a masterpiece of cynicism... a Figaroesque valet – a servant so much the master already&quot;.

===The Erl-King===
(An adaptation of the Erlking in folklore; a sort of goblin or spirit of the woodlands.)

A maiden wanders into the woods and is seduced by the sinister Erl-King, a seeming personification of the forest itself. However, she eventually realises that he plans to imprison her by turning her into a bird, which he has done with other girls. Realising the Erl-King&#x27;s plan, she kills him by strangling him with his own hair, thus keeping her freedom.

===The Snow Child===
(Has roots in various folktales, most apparently &quot;The Snow-child&quot;; The Snow, the Crow, and the Blood; and also tales such as Snegurochka and an obscure variant of Snow White.)

A Count and Countess go riding in midwinter. The Count sees snow on the ground and wishes for a child &quot;as white as snow&quot;. Similar wishes are made when the Count sees a hole in the snow containing a pool of blood, and a raven. As soon as he made his final wish a young woman of the exact description appears at the side of the road. The Count pays immediate attention to her, much to the chagrin of the Countess. At the Countess&#x27; command, the girl picks a rose but is pricked by a thorn and dies, after which the Count rapes her corpse. After this, her cadaver melts into the snow, leaving nothing but a bloodstain on the snow, a black feather and the rose that she had picked.

===The Lady of the House of Love===
(Loosely based on &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; and more directly on a radio play called &quot;Vampirella&quot;.)

A virginal English soldier, travelling through Romania by bicycle, finds himself in a deserted village. He comes across a mansion inhabited by a vampire who survives by enticing young men into her bedroom and feeding on them. She intends to feed on the young soldier but his purity and virginity have a curious effect on her. When they enter her bedroom she accidentally cuts herself and the soldier kisses it better. He wakes up to find her dead. He leaves to return to his battalion due to the outbreak of World War I.

===The Werewolf===
(Based on &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;.)

A girl goes to visit her grandmother, but encounters a werewolf on the way, whose paw she cuts off with a knife. When she reaches her grandmother&#x27;s house, the paw has turned into a hand with the grandmother&#x27;s ring on it, and the grandmother is both delirious and missing her hand. This reveals the girl&#x27;s grandmother as the werewolf, and she is stoned to death. The girl then inherits all of her grandmother&#x27;s possessions.

===The Company of Wolves===
(Closer adaptation of &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;.)

&quot;Those are the voices of my brothers, darling; I love the company of wolves.&quot;

In the beginning of the piece, the wolf is described as an evil thing. One mini story in the beginning is about a witch who gets impregnated and left by a nobleman, who then visits his wedding and turns the whole wedding ceremony into wolves. She makes the wolves come to serenade her and the baby. In another mini story a young lady and a man are about to consummate their wedding night. As they get ready the husband says he needs to stop and relieve himself in the forest. The wife waits and he never returns. Off in the distance a wolf can be heard howling. She then concludes her husband will never return and marries a new man. With her new husband she bears children. Her first husband comes back and sees his wife. He then becomes furious, transforms into a wolf and bites the leg off the eldest child. Her second husband kills the wolf, who dies and looks exactly the same as he had when he disappeared; this makes her cry and her husband beats her. Later we meet a young girl walking in the woods who is &quot;loved by everyone&quot; and &quot;[fears] nothing&quot;, who meets a handsome hunter who makes a deal with her; whoever can get to the grandmother&#x27;s house first wins, and if the hunter wins she owes him a kiss. The protagonist lets the hunter win because she wants to kiss him. The hunter arrives at the protagonist&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s house first, as planned, but tricks the woman to let him in. She is frail and sick, and holds a Bible in her hand to protect herself against any harm. The hunter is revealed to be a wolf and eats the grandmother, then waits for the girl. When she arrives, she notices her grandmother&#x27;s hair in the fire and knows the wolf has killed her. He threatens to kill and eat her too, but she laughs in his face and proceeds to seduce him, stripping off their clothes and throwing them into the fire. The last lines are &quot;See! sweet and sound she sleeps in granny&#x27;s bed, between the paws of the tender wolf.&quot;

===Wolf-Alice===
(Based on an obscure variant of &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; and with reference to &quot;Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There&quot;, this tale explores the journey towards subjectivity and self-awareness from the perspective of a feral child.)

A feral child, whom some nuns have attempted to &quot;civilise&quot; by trying to teach her standard social graces, is left in the house of a monstrous, vampiric Duke when she cannot conform. She gradually comes to realise her own identity as a young woman and human being, and even develops compassion for the Duke, going far beyond the nuns&#x27; stunted views of life.

==Style and themes==
&quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot; can be treated as a collection of short stories that speak to a bigger narrative that deals with issues of feminism and metamorphosis instead of a set of individual tales. Although each particular narrative deals with a different set of characters, the &#x27;oppressed female seeking liberation&#x27; is a common theme and concept that is explored throughout the collection. The characters seem to blend into each other and become indistinguishable from one another when recognising this theme in the text.

In particular to Carter&#x27;s writing style, Margaret Atwood states that Carter presents a &quot;macabre&quot; painting, filled with gruesome and melancholy prose. &quot;Not for her Hemingway&#x27;s clean, well-lighted place, or Orwell&#x27;s clear prose like a pane of glass. She prefers instead a dirty, badly-lit place, with gnawed bones in the corner and dusty mirrors you&#x27;d best not consult.&quot; It shows throughout these short stories, Carter&#x27;s dedication to dark towers and dusky landscapes. Carter herself admits to being a fan of both Gothic horror and Edgar Allan Poe in particular, including in her stories such elements as incest and cannibalism in order to call upon the Gothic tradition. As such, her prose is also influenced by post-modern conventions, shown through her frank unorthodoxy and twisted proclivities towards sex and sexuality, such as the constant implications of virginity and deflowering in both &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot; and &quot;The Tiger&#x27;s Bride&quot;. Oftentimes, her writing is also considered to be something similar to magical realism in relation to the insertion of inexplicable magical elements. This is shown in &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot; when the narrator is unable to clean the blood from what seems to be a normal key in a semi-realistic setting.

The time periods of the stories are early 20th century. For example, in &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot; the existence of a transatlantic telephone implies a date of 1930 or later. On the other hand, the mention of painters such as Gustave Moreau and Odilon Redon, and of fashion designer Paul Poiret (who designs one of the heroine&#x27;s gowns) all suggest a date before 1945. &quot;The Lady of the House of Love&quot; is clearly set on the eve of the First World War, and the young man&#x27;s bicycle on which he arrives at the tradition-bound vampire&#x27;s house is a symbol of the encroaching modernity which fundamentally altered European society after 1914.

===Feminism===

Angela Carter&#x27;s short stories challenge the way women are represented in fairy tales, yet retain an air of tradition and convention through her voluptuously descriptive prose. For example, in the opening tale &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot;, which is a retelling of Bluebeard, Carter plays with the conventions of canonical fairy tales; instead of the heroine being rescued by the stereotypical male hero, she is rescued by her mother.

Carter effectively draws out the theme of feminism by contrasting traditional elements of Gothic fiction – which usually depicted female characters as weak and helpless – with strong female protagonists. By contrasting the barren and horrific atmosphere found typically within the Gothic to the strong heroines of her story, Carter is able to create sexually liberated female characters that are set against the more traditional backdrop of the fairy tale. In doing so, Carter reinvents the outdated conventions of fairy tales and offers insight on the archetypes and stereotypes of women in these well-known and celebrated stories. In particular, and especially in &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot;, Carter creates familial ties between her heroines and their mothers, where in the original fairy tales their mothers would have either died at the beginning of the story, or gone unmentioned. By creating and strengthening said bond, Carter inverts the trope of a lone woman and creates a chorus of agency, where once there was none. It is notable that the conventions Carter analyzes and reimagines are of a patriarchal nature. Many of the original fairy tales that she draws inspiration from illustrate female characters in a vulnerable, damsel-in-distress position. In giving her female characters more agency, Carter is directly responding to and critiquing these traditional patriarchal tropes.

The stories deal with themes of women&#x27;s roles in relationships and marriage, their sexuality, coming of age and corruption. Stories such as &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot; and &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot; explicitly deal with the horrific or corrupting aspects of marriage and/or sex and the balance of power within such relationships. Themes of female identity are explored in the &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; stories such as &quot;The Tiger&#x27;s Bride&quot;. In one instance, Beauty, the story&#x27;s heroine, is described as removing the petals from a white rose as her father gambles her away; this is a seeming representation of the stripping away of the false layers of her personality to find her true identity, an image that finds a mirror in the story&#x27;s fantastical conclusion.

===Gothic fiction===

Carter continues to toy with Gothic fiction and gender, in a way that utilizes classic Gothic symbolism to push the narrative forward. She writes of Gothic fiction that &quot;characters and events are exaggerated beyond reality, to become symbols, ideas, and passions,&quot; all of which work towards the singular purpose of creating an uneasy atmosphere. In &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot;, she extrapolates on the importance of symbolism, by placing emphasis on images such as the ominous Gothic castle, the blood on the key, or a blood-red choker awarded the heroine as a wedding gift. As in the Gothic tradition, these artefacts foreshadow the story to come, and the fate of the heroine as she spills blood on the bed sheets after consummating her marriage, the blood of her husband&#x27;s previous wives as she learns his dark secret, and the blood that is meant to be spilt from her neck, once the Marquis vows to chop her head off. Gothic images placed within these short stories emphasise terror and the gruesome, attempting to build an atmosphere, while also working to flip certain gendered tropes on their heads: in the end, it is the virgin&#x27;s own blood, her feminine energy in the form of her mother and her quick thinking, that save her from a terrible fate.

Furthermore, Carter seems to draw heavily from the understanding of Gothic literature as following specific, gendered structures. As English Professor at University of Georgia Anne Williams states, &quot;The male Gothic plot employs the Oedipus myth, while the female Gothic plot draws on the myth of Psyche and Eros.&quot; The tale of Psyche and Eros, or Cupid and Psyche, can often be found in such story iterations such as &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, of which &quot;The Tiger&#x27;s Bride&quot; is heavily based. Within this framework, as well, Carter bases many of her stories off of the female tradition. Particularly, in &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot;, she reflects on the sexual nature of Psyche and the beast that is Eros, as the narrator is trapped in a castle and ravished for her virginity. Though, unlike the original tale, Carter continues to darken the narrative in order to fit the Gothic landscape, in such ways as emphasising the nature of sexual acts in accordance to such horrors as cannibalism. While from Eros and Psyche bloom love, the Marquis is constantly looking to devour the heroine, to mutilate her body and objectify her in a show of Gothic horror that Edgar Allan Poe often used to influence the dark undertones in his short stories.

===Aestheticism===

In &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot;, Angela Carter reflects on the nature of artistry. Here, the Marquis, based on the character of Bluebeard from the original tale, is an art dealer, whose art comes in the form of his murder, and the &quot;aesthetic&quot; display of his former wives&#x27; corpses. His current wife&#x27;s role, in this case, &quot;is to act as his Muse... he instructs her with pictorial representations, which functions as self portraits,&quot; in the form of his wives, &quot;that depict his birth as an artist.&quot; The Marquis is first drawn to our narrator because of her artistry in her piano playing, and by lavishing gifts onto the heroine, such as the choker, he attempts to show her mirrored in the bodies and pictures of his previous wives. Here, Carter displays patriarchal values through her antagonist. By presenting himself as the typical artist, and his wife as the muse, he is literally attempting to kill her and her unique proclivities in order to indoctrinate her into his artistic method. He attempts to fetishize her and strip her of agency, a criticism of Carter&#x27;s on the &quot;male literary tradition&quot; of martyring women (literally and metaphorically in fiction) in order to present the fruits of their artistic labour.

==Reception==
===Awards===
&quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot; won the Cheltenham Festival Literary Prize in 1979.

===Critical reception===
&quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot; has received heavy praise and attention from numerous critics such as Jack Zipes (who called it a &quot;remarkable collection&quot;) and Marina Warner (who, on its inspirational nature, said it &quot;turned the key for [her] as a writer&quot;). Neil Gaiman cited the book as one of his inspirations.
In a 2019 essay in the book &quot;Lost Transmissions,&quot; Grady Hendrix said of Angela Carter: &quot;She&#x27;s someone who fantasy doesn&#x27;t claim, and she&#x27;s huge. &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot; is one of the all-time great fantasy novels.&quot;

The critic Patricia Duncker, however, was more reserved in her praise, criticising it for not breaking enough taboos. She said &quot;Carter could never have imagined Cinderella in bed with the fairy God-mother.&quot;

Several critical works have been published that focus on Carter&#x27;s use of fairy tales in &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot; and her other works.

The collection has been taught and studied in University literature courses. It has been used as part of the AQA English Literature, the OCR English Literature and Edexcel English Language &amp; Literature syllabus for A-Levels in schools and colleges across the United Kingdom.

==Adaptations==
===Radio===
Carter later adapted &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot; and &quot;Puss-in-Boots&quot; into radio plays which were broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in 1980 and 1982 respectively. The 1982 adaptation of &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; (as it was retitled) starred Andrew Sachs in the title role. The scripts for both of these plays were published in Carter&#x27;s &quot;Come Unto These Yellow Sands&quot; and later the posthumous collection &quot;The Curious Room&quot;, which also included production notes.

===Film===
The 1984 film &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot; by Neil Jordan was based upon the werewolf stories in this collection, in particular the Little Red Riding Hood analogue &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot;. Carter also directly contributed to the screenplay of this film. Carter&#x27;s original screenplay for this film is published in &quot;The Curious Room&quot;. Jordan and Carter also discussed producing a film adaptation of &quot;Vampirella&quot;, the radio drama that became &quot;The Lady of the House of Love&quot;, but this project was never released.

===Music video===
Punk band Daisy Chainsaw adapted the story of &quot;The Lady of the House of Love&quot; for their 1992 music video for &quot;Hope Your Dreams Come True&quot; (from the EP of the same name and also later the album &quot;Eleventeen&quot;).

===Theatre===
The stories within &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot; are a popular subject for theatrical adaptation. The story &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot; has been adapted for the theatre more than once, including a performance by the &quot;Zoo District&quot; which was accompanied by an amateur film adaptation of &quot;Wolf-Alice&quot;. &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot; is also a popular subject for adaptation by amateur/student theatre groups (e.g. by a Welsh drama college).

Neil Murray directed a haunting and erotic theatre production of Carter&#x27;s story &#x27;The Tiger&#x27;s Bride&#x27; in 2001 at the Gulbenkian Studio, Newcastle Playhouse. Murray comments on his interest in Carter&#x27;s work and refers to her discussion of fairy tales as &#x27;an important medium.&#x27;

In August 2013, Melbourne&#x27;s Malthouse Theatre presented a stage adaptation of The Bloody Chamber by writer Van Badham, directed by Matthew Lutton, with composers David Chisholm (scoring for three live harps) and Jethro Woodward (live and replayed electronic soundscore). Set and costumedesign were by Anna Cordingley with lighting designer Paul Jackson. Save for a relatively brief appearance by Shelly Lauman, the piece was in essence performed by Alison Whyte. The three harpists were Jacinta Dennett, Jess Fotinos, and Yinuo Mu.

===Music===
The band The Parlour Trick featured a song called &quot;The Lady of the House of Love&quot; on their 2012 album &quot;A Blessed Unrest&quot;. Angela Carter is listed as an inspiration in the album notes. Wolf Alice is a band which named themselves after the story in the collection. The band Honeyblood also released a song, &quot;Choker&quot;, on their 2014 self-titled album which retells &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot;.

<text>This article traces the historical development of the dioceses and cathedrals of the Church of England. It is customary in England to name each diocese after the city where its cathedral is located. Occasionally, when the bishop&#x27;s seat has been moved from one city to another, the diocese may retain both names, for example Bath and Wells. More recently, where a cathedral is in a small or little-known town or city, the diocesan name has been changed to include the name of a nearby larger city: thus the cathedral in Southwell now serves the diocese of Southwell and Nottingham, and Ripon Cathedral was in Ripon and Leeds from 1999 until 2014. Cathedrals, like other churches, are dedicated to a particular saint or holy object, or Christ himself, but are commonly referred to by the name of the city where they stand. A cathedral is, simply, the church where the bishop has his chair or &quot;cathedra&quot;.

The forty-two dioceses of the Church of England are administrative territorial units each governed by a bishop. Forty-one dioceses cover England, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands, the Isles of Scilly, and a small part of Wales. One diocese, the Diocese in Europe, is also a part of the Church of England (rather than a separate Anglican church such as the Church in Wales), and covers the whole of mainland Europe, the countries of Morocco and Turkey, and the territory of the former Soviet Union.

The structure of the dioceses within the Church of England was initially inherited from the Catholic Church as part of the English Reformation. During the Reformation, a number of new dioceses were founded. No new English or Welsh dioceses were then created until the middle of the 19th century, when dioceses were founded mainly in response to the growing population, especially in the northern industrial cities.

From 1787, the Anglican church also erected 41 dioceses outside these isles (see § colonial dioceses); these were part of the Church of England until they were separated from the home Church in 1863. From 1801 until 1871, the dioceses of Ireland were also part of the United Church of England and Ireland. In 1920 (by the Welsh Church Act 1914), the Welsh dioceses were separated to form the Church in Wales.

The last dioceses were created in 1927. The 42 dioceses are divided between two Provinces: the Province of Canterbury (with 30 dioceses) and the Province of York (with 12 dioceses). The archbishops of Canterbury and York have pastoral oversight over the bishops within their province, along with certain other rights and responsibilities.

==History==
The history of the cathedrals in Great Britain differs somewhat from that of their European continental counterparts. British cathedrals have always been fewer in number than those of Italy, France, and other parts of Europe, while the buildings themselves have tended to be much larger. While France, at the time of the French Revolution, had 136 cathedrals, England had 27. Because of a ruling that no cathedral could be built in a village, any town in which a cathedral was located was elevated to city status, regardless of its size. To this day several large English cathedrals are located in small &quot;cathedral cities&quot;, notably Wells and Ely Cathedrals, both of which rank among the greatest works of English Medieval architecture.

===Early organisation===
In earlier times, populations were sparsely spread and towns were few. The population of the kingdom of England in the 11th century is estimated at between one and two million, with Lincolnshire, East Anglia, and East Kent the most densely populated areas; in other parts of the country many villages had been razed by the conquest armies. Instead of exercising jurisdiction over geographical areas, many of the bishops were linked to tribes or peoples, as the bishops of the South Saxons, the West Saxons, the Somersætas, etc. The &quot;cathedra&quot; of such a bishop was often migratory.

In 1075 a council was held in London, under the presidency of Archbishop Lanfranc, which, reciting the decrees of the council of Sardica held in 347 and that of Laodicea held in 360 on this matter, ordered the bishop of the South Saxons to remove his see from Selsey to Chichester; the Wiltshire and Dorset bishop to remove his cathedra from Sherborne to Old Sarum, and the Mercian bishop, whose cathedral was then at Lichfield, to transfer it to Chester. Traces of the tribal and migratory system may still be noted in the designations of the Irish see of Meath (where the result has been that there is now no cathedral church) and Ossory, the cathedral church of which is at Kilkenny. Some of the Scottish sees were also migratory.

===Late Middle Ages===
Between 1075 and the 15th century, the cathedrals of England were almost evenly divided between those ruled by secular canons headed by a dean and those ruled by monastic orders headed by a prior, all of which were Benedictine, except Carlisle, which was Augustinian. Two cathedrals, Bath and Coventry, shared their sees with Wells and Lichfield, respectively.

===Reformation===
The entire structure of the monastic and cathedral system was overthrown and reconstituted during the Reformation. Cathedrals which were once Roman Catholic came under the governance of the Church of England.

All the English monastic cathedral chapters were dissolved by Henry VIII and, with the exceptions of Bath and Coventry, were re-founded by him as churches of secular chapters, with a dean as the head, and a certain number of canons ranging from twelve at Canterbury and Durham to four at Carlisle, and with certain subordinate officers as minor canons, gospellers, epistolers, etc. The precentorship in these churches of the &quot;New Foundation&quot;, as they are called, is not, as in the secular churches of the &quot;Old Foundation&quot;, a dignity, but is merely an office held by one of the minor canons.

Henry VIII also created six new cathedrals from old monastic establishments, in each case governed by secular canons. Of these, Westminster did not retain its cathedral status. Four more of England&#x27;s large historic churches were later to become cathedrals: Southwell, Southwark, Ripon, and St Albans Abbey.

==Roles within the Cathedral==
==Details of cathedrals and their foundation==

===Ancient cathedrals===
The medieval Church of England was organised into 17 dioceses. About half of the diocesan cathedrals were also monasteries, with the prior serving double duty as dean of the cathedral. The rest were served by a college of &quot;secular&quot; canons – non-monastic priests living under no fixed rule of life. Both types often had Saxon foundations. Dioceses which exist in the Church of England today are indicated in bold type.

====Pre-Conquest====
====Post-conquest====
===The Henrician Reorganisation===
After Henry VIII&#x27;s break with the Pope and the dissolution of the monasteries, the formerly monastic cathedrals were &quot;re-founded&quot; with secular canons. Furthermore, a number of new dioceses were formed, using some of the largest and finest of the other dissolved monasteries as cathedrals. Together, these two groups — the old monastic cathedrals and the new sees — were known as cathedrals of the New Foundation; the old cathedrals which had always been served by secular canons were known as those of the Old Foundation. Dioceses which exist in the Church of England today are indicated in bold type.

===Colonial dioceses===
During the British colonial era, the Anglican religion was exported to the colonies. From 1787 onwards, Church of England dioceses were founded in the colonies. A structure of provinces and metropolitans developed until, in 1863, the imperial Privy Council ruled that the English church hierarchy had no legal status in the colonies. Immediately prior to that point, the United Church of England and Ireland had a total of 82 dioceses worldwide.

From 1863 onwards, Anglican (former) colonial dioceses have been separate from and independent of the English church. Exceptionally, the Archbishop of Canterbury has retained (and retains to this day) some metropolitan jurisdictions outside England. Dioceses are listed by their name at creation and their present country, with only their cathedral(s) between creation and independence.

===Irish dioceses===
Between the 1801 Union and 1871 disestablishment, the Anglican dioceses of England and Ireland were united in one United Church of England and Ireland. As such, the Irish dioceses were, for a time, Church of England dioceses. Each diocese is listed with its cathedral(s) only during the United Church period.

===Late modern foundations===
No further cathedrals were founded until, in the mid 19th century, the huge population growth of north-central England meant that redistricting could no longer be ignored. Since then twenty new dioceses have been founded, each with a cathedral — some are great medieval monasteries or collegiate churches which were not elevated by Henry VIII but might well have been; others are glorified parish churches; and others are totally new constructions. 

In the following table, bold type indicates the creation of a new diocese, whilst plain type is used to indicate changes to existing dioceses.

==Line of descent since St Augustine==
There were archbishops in London, York and Caerleon and bishops in Lincoln before the 4th century. The following is a simplified breakdown of the creation of dioceses since St Augustine&#x27;s 6th/7th century dioceses. It is simplified in that not every new diocese is formed from only one predecessor – they have often taken territory from two or more neighbouring dioceses. Today&#x27;s dioceses are highlighted in bold type.

<text>Virtual XI (pronounced &quot;Virtual Eleven&quot;) is the eleventh studio album by English heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released on 23 March 1998. It is the band&#x27;s second and final album with Blaze Bayley on vocals. It also marks the first album to utilise a slightly modified logo, with the letters R, M, and N the same size as the other letters as opposed to them being extended. The band used the updated version of their logo for their next few albums; it was used until &quot;The Final Frontier&quot;, released in 2010.

==Background==
&quot;Virtual XI&quot;&#x27;s title is tied in with two extra-musical events: the release of the band&#x27;s computer game, &quot;Ed Hunter&quot;, and the fact that the 1998 FIFA World Cup would be taking place in June of that year. Harris explains, &quot;We figure our fans are pretty much the same as we are, with pretty much the same interests, so we thought, &#x27;It&#x27;s World Cup year in &#x27;98. Let&#x27;s get the football involved in the new album.&#x27; And we were already working on a computer game at that time, so we thought, &#x27;Well, let&#x27;s bring that element into things, too.&#x27;&quot; Prior to the album&#x27;s release, the band organised a publicity tour in which they held football matches across Europe with &quot;guest musicians and pro-footballers from the UK.&quot;

While most of the artwork in the album&#x27;s booklet was taken from the &quot;Ed Hunter&quot; game, the cover was created by Melvyn Grant. According to Grant, he was asked to design something related to virtual reality, but was later asked to alter the artwork by adding a football game, the band then having decided to link the release with the World Cup. This was also the first album to feature the band&#x27;s new alternate logo, with the extended ends of the &quot;R&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, and both &quot;N&#x27;s&quot; removed. This variant would be used on all future studio albums, live albums (with the exception of &quot;Flight 666&quot; and &quot;Maiden England &#x27;88&quot;), and singles up until &quot;The Final Frontier&quot;. Starting with &quot;The Book of Souls&quot;, the band&#x27;s 16th studio album, the original logo was reused.

For this album some keyboard parts were performed by band founder/bassist Steve Harris whereas on previous albums all the keyboard parts had been handled by Harris&#x27; bass technician, Michael Kenney.

As with their previous world tour, several US shows on the Virtual XI World Tour had to be cancelled as Bayley had vocal issues; however, the official reason given for the cancellation was that he was suffering from a severe allergic reaction to pollen.

This would be the second and final studio album to feature Blaze Bayley, as he resigned from Iron Maiden following a February 1999 announcement that Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith, who had left in 1993 and 1990 respectively, would be returning to the line-up.

==Songs==
Stylistically, Bayley states that &quot;Virtual XI&quot; &quot;was a more upbeat album [in comparison to its predecessor], because we&#x27;d survived the &#x27;X-Factor&#x27;... we were a band and, I felt, we were on our way.&quot; According to Harris, &quot;Futureal&quot;, whose lyrics were written by Bayley, is &quot;about being locked up in virtual reality&quot;, and describes it as &quot;a quite straightforward rocker but done Maiden style.&quot; Regarding the album&#x27;s second single, manager Rod Smallwood claims that he &quot;had a bit of a battle with Steve&quot; over releasing &quot;Futureal&quot; instead of &quot;The Angel and the Gambler&quot; as the album&#x27;s lead single, but &quot;Steve put his foot down.&quot; According to Harris, &quot;The Angel and the Gambler&quot; &quot;is the story of these two characters, one guy who&#x27;s been a bit of a rogue, a fly by night, and an angel who gets sent down to try and put him right – except he isn&#x27;t having it.&quot;

Of the album&#x27;s remaining songs, &quot;Lightning Strikes Twice&quot; is, according to Harris, &quot;a never say never-type song ... It&#x27;s a very positive, hopeful song which you can read in lots of different ways.&quot; &quot;The Clansman&quot; was inspired by the film &quot;Braveheart&quot; which Harris states is &quot;about what it&#x27;s like to belong to a community that you try and build up and then you have to fight to stop having it taken away from you&quot;. Speaking about &quot;When Two Worlds Collide&quot;, Harris says, &quot;Lyrically, I think Blaze was trying to write about the different sort of worlds he&#x27;s lived in and maybe about how his world has had to change and adapt to the world of being Iron Maiden&#x27;s singer.&quot; &quot;The Educated Fool&quot; is, according to Harris, about &quot;growing older and everyone expecting you to be wiser but how somehow the older you get and the more you know, the less you have the answers for any of it.&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t Look to the Eyes of a Stranger&quot; is inspired by Steve Harris&#x27; observation, from a parent&#x27;s point of view, that &quot;every stranger is a possible threat&quot;, while &quot;Como Estais Amigos&quot; is a tribute to the soldiers on both sides in the Falklands War; its lyrics were written by Bayley and the music by Gers, making this the first Iron Maiden album where Steve Harris did not write or co-write the final song.

After Bruce Dickinson rejoined the band, Iron Maiden continued to play both &quot;Futureal&quot; and &quot;The Clansman&quot; in concert. While &quot;Futureal&quot; was only performed live in 1999, &quot;The Clansman&quot; appeared in the group&#x27;s setlists until 2003; it was also used during 2018&#x27;s Legacy of the Beast tour. Live recordings of both songs with Dickinson on vocals have been released officially: &quot;Futureal&quot; was issued as a B-side to &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; single, while performances of &quot;The Clansman&quot; can be found on the live albums &quot;Rock in Rio&quot; and &quot;Nights of the Dead&quot;. The &quot;Rock in Rio&quot; recording was also included on Iron Maiden&#x27;s 2011 compilation CD &quot;From Fear to Eternity&quot;.

Four songs that were written during the sessions for &quot;Virtual XI&quot; ended up on its follow-up &quot;Brave New World&quot;: &quot;Nomad&quot;, &quot;Dream of Mirrors&quot;, &quot;Mercenary&quot; and &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;.

Blaze Bayley recorded solo versions of &quot;Futureal&quot; and &quot;When Two Worlds Collide&quot; on his live album &quot;As Live as It Gets&quot;. He regularly performs the album&#x27;s closing song &quot;Como Estais Amigos&quot; in concert, a song which never appeared on any Iron Maiden setlist.

The track &quot;The Clansman&quot; was sampled by singer Brandy in her song &quot;I Tried&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Virtual XI&quot; was met with mixed to negative reviews from critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented that &quot;on the surface, there&#x27;s nothing terribly wrong with the record, as it delivers all the crunching riffs and demonic horror of their best records. The problem is that there&#x27;s nothing memorable about the hooks, riffs, or songs, and there&#x27;s little visceral energy to the music or production. As a result, it sounds lifeless to all but the most devoted fan.&quot; He also stated that Blaze Bayley is &quot;a competent but faceless vocalist&quot;.

<doc id="1025595" wikidata="Q1558572" url="?curid=1025595" title="Bobby Digital (Jamaican producer)">
<text>Bobby Dixon (March 11, 1961 – May 22, 2020), known as Bobby Digital, was a Jamaican reggae and dancehall producer. He was given his nickname &quot;Bobby Digital&quot; because King Jammy, with whom he worked in the mid-1980s, had begun experimenting with digital rhythms at around the same time. He owned the Digital B label, and among the artists with hits on the label are Shabba Ranks and Sizzla. He has influenced reggae artists such as Admiral Tibet.

==Biography==
Dixon was born on March 11, 1961, the third of five children in the Waterhouse district of Kingston. He grew up attending dances in the 1970s, which featured sound systems such as Socialist Roots and Tippertone.

Dixon began working with King Jammy in Kingston in 1985. He struck out on his own in 1988, opening the Heatwave studio and forming the Digital B label, and thereafter a successful distribution company. In the 1980s, Dixon helped stylize the computerized phase of Jamaican music, as an accomplished digital engineer.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s he was the producer for works by Shabba Ranks, Cocoa Tea, Super Cat and Garnett Silk. He explored styles such as dancehall, lovers rock and roots reggae. He also formed his own sound system Heatwave.

In the late 1990s he began to work with artists such as Morgan Heritage, Sizzla, Anthony B and Richie Spice. He was the producer of Sizzla&#x27;s &quot;Black Woman and Child&quot; album of the late 1990s. Morgan Heritage&#x27;s &quot;Protect Us, Jah&quot; also released in the late 1990s was another known collaboration, as well as their three-volume &quot;Morgan Heritage Family and Friends&quot;. Also recorded to panamanian singer Reggae Sam various singles and dubplates for VP RECORDS.

Dixon produced more albums for Richie Spice, Anthony B, Morgan Heritage, Chezidek, Ras Shiloh, Louie Culture, LMS, Mikey Spice, and Norris Man.

Dixon died in Kingston on May 21, 2020, at the age of 59 following a kidney-related illness.

<doc id="1025612" wikidata="Q4033171" url="?curid=1025612" title="AbioCor">
<text>AbioCor was a total artificial heart (TAH) developed by the Massachusetts-based company AbioMed. It was fully implantable within a patient, due to a combination of advances in miniaturization, biosensors, plastics and energy transfer. The AbioCor ran on a rechargeable source of power. The internal battery was charged by a transcutaneous energy transmission (TET) system, meaning that no wires or tubes penetrated the skin, reducing the risk of infection. However, because of its size, this heart was only compatible with men who had a large frame. It had a product life expectancy of 18 months.

AbioCor was surgically introduced into 15 total patients, 14 of them during a clinical trial and one after FDA approval. However, due to insufficient evidence of its efficacy, AbioMed abandoned further development of the product.

==History==
AbioMed was founded by Param Singh and David Lederman. The company began development of the AbioCor device in the 1990s, beginning animal studies in 1998 in preparation to demonstrate readiness for formal clinical trials in humans. On January 30, 2001, the FDA granted AbioMed an investigational device exemption (IDE) for implantation into humans via a clinical trial. This opened the door for the first implantation of the AbioCor into Robert Tools on July 2, 2001. He lived for 151 days before having a fatal cerebrovascular accident. &quot;Time&quot; magazine awarded the AbioCor its Invention of the Year award in late 2001.

The second patient, Tom Christerson, who was given less than a 20 percent chance of surviving 30 days at the time of his surgery, lived for 512 days after receiving the AbioCor, dying on February 7, 2003, due to the wearing out of an internal membrane of the AbioCor. An additional 12 patients had the device implanted into 2004, resulting in an average life span of less than five months among all 14 patients. In some cases the device extended survival by several months, allowing the patients to spend valuable time with family and friends. In two cases, the device extended survival by 10 and 17 months respectively, and one patient was discharged from the hospital to go home. For a patient to be eligible for implantation with the AbioCor, the person must have had severe heart failure (with failure of both ventricles) and had to be likely to die within two weeks without transplantation.

Though the device was initially rejected by FDA Circulatory System Devices Panel in 2005 for Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) status, it was eventually approved by the Food and Drug Administration on September 5, 2006, for HDE status. However, only one patient received the AbioCor after approval, a &quot;76-year-old man with congestive heart failure, who did not qualify for a heart transplant.&quot;

In August 2012, key AbioCor researcher and developer David Lederman died from pancreatic cancer.

The company also had plans to improve the AbioCor with a second version based upon the AbioCor ventricles and the Penn State energy converter. It was expected to last for five years, more than triple the life expectancy of AbioCor. The company stated it would be 30 percent smaller than the original model, and it could be implanted in smaller men and women. Additional modifications were planned to reduce the patient&#x27;s risk of stroke, which was a concern of the FDA. , AbioCor II has not come to fruition, however. Additionally, the AbioCor product has been removed from the AbioMed website, with several news agencies reporting in 2015 that the company had quietly abandoned further development of the device.

In 2019, Abiomed was marketing the Impella Ventricular Support Systems, left-side heart pump models &quot;intended to help pump blood in patients who need short-term support (up to 6 days)&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The AbioCor heart is featured in the 2009 film &quot;&quot;, when it is transplanted into the main character Chev Chelios&#x27;s (Jason Statham) chest after he had been abducted by Chinese mobsters in the very beginning of the movie. However, the heart depicted in the film has a much lower battery life but gives Chev superhuman athleticism when fully charged (for dramatic purposes). The model of the heart in the movie is called AviCor.

<doc id="1025622" wikidata="Q1074223" url="?curid=1025622" title="Ascribed status">
<text>Ascribed status is a term used in sociology that refers to the social status of a person that is assigned at birth or assumed involuntarily later in life. The status is a position that is neither earned by the person nor chosen for them. It is given to them by either their society or group, leaving them little or no control over it. Rather, the ascribed status is assigned based on social and cultural expectations, norms, and standards. These positions are occupied regardless of efforts or desire. These rigid social designators remain fixed throughout an individual&#x27;s life and are inseparable from the positive or negative stereotypes that are linked with one&#x27;s ascribed statuses.

The practice of assigning such statuses to individuals exists cross-culturally within all societies and is based on gender, race, family origins, and ethnic backgrounds.

In contrast, an achieved status is a social position a person takes on voluntarily that reflects both personal ability and merit. An individual&#x27;s occupation tends to fall under the category of an achieved status; for example, a teacher or a firefighter.

Individuals have control over their achieved statuses insofar as there are no restrictions associated with their ascribed statuses that could potentially hinder their social growth. Ascribed status plays an important role in societies because it can provide the members with a defined and unified identity. No matter where an individual&#x27;s ascribed status may place him or her in the social hierarchy, most has a set of roles and expectations that are directly linked to each ascribed status and thus, provides a social personality.

==Factors==
The various factors that determine ascribed status can be age (as in age stratification), kinship, sex, appearance, race, social group, gender, ability status, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, culture, or caste.

In addition to ascription, at birth there are also:
* Delayed ascription (when social status is given at a later stage of life)
* Fluid ascription (when ascribed status leads to an achieved status)

==Reversible and irreversible==
The anthropologist, Ralph Linton, developed definitions for ascribed status and achieved status. According to Linton, ascribed status is assigned to an individual without reference to their innate differences or abilities. Achieved status is determined by an individual&#x27;s performance or effort. Linton noted that while the definitions of the two concepts are clear and distinct, it is not always easy to identify whether an individual&#x27;s status is ascribed or achieved. His perspective offers a deviation from the view that ascribed statuses are always fixed.

Religion is generally perceived as an ascribed status but for those individuals who choose a religion as an adult, or convert to another religion, their religion becomes an achieved status, based on Linton&#x27;s definition. It is commonly perceived that ascribed statuses are irreversible while achieved statuses are reversible. Linton uses Leo Schnore&#x27;s research to illustrate how ascribed statuses can be both irreversible and reversible. An example of an ascribed reversible status is the status of citizenship.

An example of ascribed irreversible status is age. His conclusion is based on the fact that an ascribed status within a social structure is indicative of the behavior that one can exhibit but it does not explain the action itself. Ascribed status is an arbitrary system of classifying individuals that is not fixed in the way that most people think.

Status is a social phenomenon rather than a biological one. The meaning is derived from the collection of expectations of how an individual should behave and what the expected treatment of that individual is. If an individual lies about a biological fact or social accomplishment and this lie remains undiscovered by others and is accepted by them, then in this social system, his status will be based on the lie. His status would not be based on a biological fact or social accomplishment.

Behavior toward the individual will be in accordance with the accepted lie. Consequently, behavior expected from that individual will also be in accordance with that accepted lie rather than the ascribed status that would be associated with him if the truth were known. The success of the structure requires that the expectations remain constant, even if they are illegitimately acquired, given that the truth is never discovered. This further highlights the arbitrariness of ascribed status because there is no biological basis or universal truth for assigning these societal rankings to individuals.

==Low self-esteem==
There is a positive correlation between an individual&#x27;s self-esteem and their ascribed status; for this purpose, self-esteem is defined as a liking and respect for oneself which has its basis in reality. Individuals with a low social status generally have a lower self-esteem. A negative image of oneself among individuals with lower ascribed statuses is the result of the internalization of the expectations that others have of them and the treatment that they receive based on those statuses. Additionally, labeling theory can play a role in ascribed status and self-esteem as well. Labeling theory is associated with the concepts of self-fulfilling prophecy and stereotyping and is a theory that states a person becomes what they are labeled. For example, when members in society can begin to treat individuals on the basis of their ascribed statuses, they &quot;label&quot; them, and the individuals begin to accept the labels themselves. In other words, an individual engages in a behavior that is deemed by others as inappropriate, others label that person to be deviant, and eventually the individual internalizes and accepts this label.

Juxtaposition of their own value systems against the larger society&#x27;s view often leaves individuals of a lower status with low self-esteem without regard to the individual&#x27;s actual capabilities. A negative self-image may stifle an individual&#x27;s efforts to acquire a certain achieved status; this illustrates how a low ascribed status can result in a low achieved status.

==Religion==
Wealth is not the only social characteristic that defines an individual&#x27;s ascribed status. Religion is also a factor. If a person&#x27;s family identifies with a particular religion, be it Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, etc., generally that person may be presumed to adopt the same religion as their biological or adopted parents. An individual&#x27;s religion or absence of religion becomes a part of his or her ascribed status. The social norms of a particular religion may have different ascribed statuses than those given by the larger society because followers are ascribed status based on the religious doctrines that govern their belief. 

Ascribed status can also be closely linked with master status, as they both involve what a person is born into. Master status is a broader term that includes more topics than ascribed status.

==Caste system==

Castes are an example of a stratification structure based on ascribed status. Although each caste system works differently, generally everyone is born into a specific caste and the caste of the parents generally determines the status of their children, regardless of ability or merit. The ranks of a caste system might include:
* priests and scholars
* rulers, warriors and those concerned with defense and administration
* traders, merchants, and people involved in agricultural production
* laborers, servants
* those involved in animal slaughter or sewerage disposal

<text>Ayaka Komatsu ( &quot;Komatsu Ayaka&quot;; born 23 July 1986) is a Japanese model, gravure idol and actress. She was born in Ichinoseki, Iwate Prefecture.

==Biography==

===Modeling career===
Her previous modeling agency is Amuse inc. She was a regular model of the now defunct &quot;Candy&quot; magazine. She also appeared in the Winter 2002-2003 &quot;Angel Blue&quot; fashion catalog and was on the cover of the manga &quot;Young Sunday&quot; dated April 7, 2005.

She was a member of the 2004 edition of the Japanese modeling quartet named Nittelligenic, an idol group sponsored by Nippon TV.

===Acting career===
She has acted in the following movies: &quot;Odoru Daisosasen The Movie 2&quot; (her role in this film was relatively minor; she gets attacked by a vampire), &quot;Koibumi&quot;, &quot;Master of Thunder&quot;, &quot;A Perfect Day for Love Letters&quot;, &quot;Drift&quot; and &quot;Drift 2&quot; (later released as &quot;Drift Deluxe Edition&quot;), and &quot;Boku wa Imōto ni Koi o Suru&quot; (which opened in Japan on January 20, 2007, and later in Europe under the English title &quot;My Sister, My Love&quot;).

Arguably, her best known role was as Minako Aino/Sailor V/Sailor Venus in the series &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot;.

Komatsu was in the cast of a TV show called &quot;Dandori Musume&quot; (&quot;Appointment Girls&quot;). Her role in &quot;Dandori Musume&quot; is more comic than tragic, in contrast to her PGSM role. In 2008, she appeared in &quot;Average&quot; and in episode 7 of &quot;Aren&#x27;t You a Criminal?&quot;.

She had a recurring role in the summer Fuji TV drama &quot;Buzzer Beat&quot;, reuniting with her former Sailor Moon cast member Keiko Kitagawa, who had the lead female role as well as with Tomohisa Yamashita as Komatsu made a cameo appearance on his previous drama, &quot;Kurosagi&quot;.

=== Personal life ===
During her birthday on July 23, 2023, she announced her marriage to a general man, and she would move her entertainment activities to Sendai due to her husband’s work.

On August 26, 2024, she announced on her Instagram account that she is expecting her first child. On February 2, 2025, she announced that she gave birth to her first child, a baby boy on January 28.

<doc id="1025635" wikidata="Q211582" url="?curid=1025635" title="Zong massacre">
<text>The &quot;Zong&quot; massacre was a mass killing of more than 130 enslaved African people by the crew of the British slave ship &quot;Zong&quot; over several days from 29 November 1781. The William Gregson slave-trading syndicate, based in Liverpool, owned the ship as part of the Atlantic slave trade. As was common business practice, they had taken out insurance on the lives of the enslaved Africans as cargo. According to the crew, when the ship ran low on drinking water after a series of navigational errors, the crew threw enslaved Africans overboard.

After the slaver ship reached port at Black River, Jamaica, &quot;Zong&quot;″s owners made a claim to their insurers for the loss of the enslaved Africans. When the insurers refused to pay, the resulting court cases (&quot;Gregson v Gilbert&quot; (1783) 3 Doug. KB 232) held that in some circumstances, the murder of enslaved Africans was legal and that insurers could be required to pay for those who had died. The jury found for the slavers but at a subsequent appeal hearing the judges, led by Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield, ruled against the slave-trading syndicate owners, on the grounds that new evidence suggested that the captain and crew were at fault.

Following the first trial, Olaudah Equiano, a freedman, brought news of the massacre to the attention of the anti-slavery campaigner Granville Sharp, who worked unsuccessfully to have the ship&#x27;s crew prosecuted for murder. Because of the legal dispute, reports of the massacre received increased publicity, stimulating the abolitionist movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; the &quot;Zong&quot; events were increasingly cited as a powerful symbol of the horrors of the Middle Passage, the transoceanic route by which enslaved Africans were brought to the New World.

The non-denominational Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade was founded in 1787. The next year, Parliament passed the Slave Trade Act 1788, its first law regulating the slave trade, to limit the number of slaves per ship. Then, in 1791, Parliament prohibited insurance companies from reimbursing ship owners when enslaved Africans were murdered by being thrown overboard. The massacre has also inspired works of art and literature. It was remembered in London in 2007, among events to mark the bicentenary of the British Slave Trade Act 1807, which abolished British participation in the African slave trade (though stopped short of outlawing slavery). A monument to the murdered enslaved Africans on &quot;Zong&quot; was installed at Black River, Jamaica.

==&quot;Zong&quot;==

&quot;Zong&quot; was originally named &quot;Zorg&quot; (meaning &quot;Care&quot; in Dutch) by its owners, the Middelburgsche Commercie Compagnie. It operated as a slave ship based in Middelburg, Netherlands, and made a voyage in 1777, delivering enslaved Africans to the Dutch colony of Surinam in South America. &quot;Zong&quot; was a &quot;square stern ship&quot; of 110 tons burthen. The British 16-gun brig captured it (as part of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War) on 10 February 1781. On 26 February, &quot;Alert&quot; and &quot;Zong&quot; arrived at Cape Coast Castle, in what is now Ghana. Cape Coast Castle was maintained and staffed, along with other forts and castles, by the Royal African Company (RAC), which used the Castle as its regional headquarters.

In early March 1781, the master of &quot;William&quot; purchased &quot;Zong&quot; on behalf of a syndicate of Liverpool merchants, which included Edward Wilson, George Case, James Aspinall and William, James and John Gregson. William Gregson had an interest in 50 slaving voyages between 1747 and 1780; he also served as mayor of Liverpool in 1762. By the end of his life, vessels in which Gregson had a financial stake had carried 58,000 Africans to slavery in the Americas.

&quot;Zong&quot; was paid for with bills of exchange and the 244 slaves already on board were part of the transaction. The ship was not insured until after it started its voyage. The insurers, another syndicate from Liverpool, underwrote the ship and its slaves for up to £8,000, approximately half the slaves&#x27; potential market value. The remaining risk was borne by the owners.

===Crew===
&quot;Zong&quot; was the first command of Luke Collingwood, formerly the surgeon on the &quot;William&quot;. While Collingwood lacked experience in navigation and command, ship&#x27;s surgeons were typically involved in selecting captured Africans for purchase, so their medical expertise supported the determination of &quot;commodity value&quot; for a captive. If the surgeon rejected a captive, that individual suffered &quot;commercial death&quot;, being of no value and was liable to be killed by the African traders. Sometimes these killings happened in the presence of the surgeon. It is therefore likely that Collingwood had already witnessed the mass killing of slaves. Historian Jeremy Krikler commented that this may have prepared him psychologically to condone the massacre that later took place on the &quot;Zong&quot;. &quot;Zong&quot; first mate was James Kelsall, who had also served on the &quot;William&quot;.

The vessel&#x27;s only passenger, Robert Stubbs, was a former captain of slave ships. In early 1780 he was appointed by the African Committee of the Royal African Company as the governor of Anomabu, a British fortification near Cape Coast Castle in Ghana. This position made him also vice-president of the RAC council of the castle. Due to his ineptitude and enmity incurred with John Roberts, governor of the castle, Stubbs was forced out of the governorship of Anomabu by the RAC council after nine months. Witness statements gathered by the African Committee of the RAC accused him of being a semi-literate drunkard who mismanaged the slave-trading activities of the fort. Stubbs was aboard to return to Britain; Collingwood may have thought his earlier experience on slave ships would be useful.

&quot;Zong&quot; had a 17-man crew when it left Africa, which was far too small to maintain adequate sanitary conditions on the ship. Mariners willing to risk disease and rebellions on slave ships were difficult to recruit within Britain and were harder to find for a vessel captured from the Dutch off the coast of Africa. &quot;Zong&quot; was manned with remnants of the previous Dutch crew, the crew of &quot;William&quot; and with unemployed sailors hired from settlements along the African coast.

== The Middle Passage ==
When &quot;Zong&quot; sailed from Accra with 442 slaves on 18 August 1781, it had taken on more than twice the number of people that it could safely transport. In the 1780s, British-built ships typically carried 1.75 slaves per ton of the ship&#x27;s capacity; on the &quot;Zong&quot;, the ratio was 4.0 per ton. A British slave ship of the period would carry around 193 slaves and it was extremely unusual for a ship of &quot;Zong&quot; relatively small size to carry so many. After taking on drinking water at São Tomé, &quot;Zong&quot; began its voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to Jamaica on 6 September 1781. On 18 or 19 November, the ship neared Tobago in the Caribbean but failed to stop there to replenish its water supplies.

It is unclear who, if anyone, was in charge of the ship at this point, as Collingwood had been gravely ill for some time. The man who would normally have replaced him, first mate James Kelsall, had been suspended from duty following an argument on 14 November. Stubbs had captained a slave ship several decades earlier and he temporarily commanded &quot;Zong&quot; during Collingwood&#x27;s incapacitation but he was not a registered member of the vessel&#x27;s crew. According to the historian James Walvin, the breakdown of the command structure on the ship might explain the subsequent navigational errors and the absence of checks on supplies of drinking water.

=== Massacre ===

On 27 or 28 November, the crew sighted Jamaica at a distance of but misidentified it as the French colony of Saint-Domingue on the island of Hispaniola. &quot;Zong&quot; continued on its westward course, leaving Jamaica behind. This mistake was recognised only after the ship was leeward of the island. Overcrowding, malnutrition, accidents and disease had already killed several mariners and approximately 62 Africans. Kelsall later claimed that there was only four days&#x27; water remaining on the ship when the navigational error was discovered and Jamaica was still 10 to 13 sailing days away.
If the slaves died onshore, the Liverpool ship-owners would have had no redress from their insurers. Similarly, if they died a &quot;natural death&quot; (as the contemporary term put it) at sea, then insurance could not be claimed. If some enslaved people were thrown overboard to save the rest of the &quot;cargo&quot; or the ship, then a claim could be made under &quot;general average&quot;. (This principle holds that a captain who jettisons part of his cargo to save the rest can claim for the loss from his insurers.) The ship&#x27;s insurance covered the loss of slaves at £30 per person.

On 29 November, the crew assembled to consider the proposal that some of the slaves should be thrown overboard. Kelsall later claimed that he had disagreed with the plan at first but it was soon unanimously agreed upon. On 29 November, 54 women and children were thrown through cabin windows into the sea. On 1 December, 42 male slaves were thrown overboard and 36 more followed in the next few days. Another 10, in a display of defiance at the inhumanity of the slavers, chose to commit suicide by jumping into the sea. Having heard the shrieks of the victims as they were thrown into the water, one of the captives requested that the remaining Africans be denied all food and drink rather than being thrown into the sea; the crew ignored this request. In total, 142 Africans were killed by the time the ship reached Jamaica. The account of the King&#x27;s Bench trial reports that one slave managed to climb back onto the ship after being thrown into the water.

The crew claimed that the Africans had been jettisoned because the ship did not have enough water to keep them all alive for the rest of the voyage. This claim was later disputed, as the ship had of water left when it finally arrived in Jamaica on 22 December. An affidavit later made by Kelsall stated that on 1 December, when 42 slaves were killed, it rained heavily for more than a day, allowing six casks of water (sufficient for 11 days) to be collected.

=== Arrival at Jamaica ===
On 22 December 1781, &quot;Zong&quot; arrived at Black River, Jamaica, with 208 slaves on board, less than half the number taken from Africa. The survivors were sold into slavery in January 1782. These people were sold for an average price of £36 per person. The Jamaican Vice-Admiralty court upheld the legality of the British capture of &quot;Zong&quot; from the Dutch and the syndicate renamed the ship &quot;Richard of Jamaica&quot;. Collingwood died three days after &quot;Zong&quot; reached Jamaica, two years before the 1783 court proceedings about the case.

== Legal proceedings ==

When news of the &quot;Zong&quot; massacre reached Great Britain, the ship&#x27;s owners claimed compensation from their insurers for the loss of the slaves. The insurers refused to honour the claim and the owners took them to court. &quot;Zong&quot;″s logbook went missing after the ship reached Jamaica, two years before the hearings started. As such, the legal proceedings provide almost all the documentary evidence about the massacre, though there is no formal record of the first trial other than what is referred to in the subsequent appeals hearing. The ship&#x27;s insurers claimed that the log had been deliberately destroyed, which the Gregson syndicate denied.

Almost all the surviving source material is of questionable reliability. The two witnesses who gave evidence, Stubbs and Kelsall, were strongly motivated to exonerate themselves from blame. It is possible that the figures concerning the number of people killed, the amount of water that remained on the ship and the distance beyond Jamaica that &quot;Zong&quot; had mistakenly sailed are inaccurate.

=== First trial ===
Legal proceedings began when the insurers refused to compensate the owners of &quot;Zong&quot;. The dispute was initially tried at the Guildhall in London on 6 March 1783, with the Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield, overseeing the trial before a jury. Mansfield was previously the judge in Somersett&#x27;s Case in 1772, which concerned the legality of enslaving people in Britain. He had ruled that slavery had never been established by statute in Britain and was not supported by common law.

Stubbs was the only witness in the first &quot;Zong&quot; trial and the jury found in favour of the owners, under an established protocol in maritime insurance that considered slaves as cargo. On 19 March 1783, Olaudah Equiano, a former slave, told the anti-slave-trade activist Granville Sharp of the events aboard &quot;Zong&quot; and a newspaper soon carried a lengthy account, reporting that the captain had ordered the slaves killed in three batches. Sharp sought legal advice the next day, about the possibility of prosecuting the crew for murder.

=== King&#x27;s Bench appeal ===

The insurers applied to the Earl of Mansfield to have the previous verdict set aside and for the case to be tried again. A hearing was held at the Court of King&#x27;s Bench in Westminster Hall on 21–22 May 1783, before Mansfield and two other King&#x27;s Bench judges, Mr Justice Buller and Mr Justice Willes. The solicitor-general, John Lee, appeared on behalf of the &quot;Zong&quot; owners, as he had done previously in the Guildhall trial. Sharp was also in attendance, together with a secretary he had hired to take a written record of the proceedings.

Summing up the verdict reached in the first trial, Mansfield said that the jury

had no doubt (though it shocks one very much) that the Case of Slaves was the same as if Horses had been thrown over board ... The Question was, whether there was not an Absolute Necessity for throwing them over board to save the rest? The Jury were of opinion there was ...

Collingwood had died in 1781 and the only witness of the massacre to appear at Westminster Hall was again, Stubbs, although a written affidavit by first mate Kelsall was made available to the lawyers. Stubbs claimed that there was &quot;an absolute Necessity for throwing over the Negroes&quot;, because the crew feared all the slaves would die if they did not throw some into the sea. The insurers argued that Collingwood had made &quot;a Blunder and Mistake&quot; in sailing beyond Jamaica and that slaves had been killed so their owners could claim compensation. They alleged that Collingwood did this because he did not want his first voyage as a slave ship captain to be unprofitable.

Lee responded by saying that the slaves &quot;perished just as a Cargo of Goods perished&quot; and were jettisoned for the greater good of the ship. The insurers&#x27; lawyers replied that Lee&#x27;s argument could never justify the killing of innocent people; each of the three addressed issues of humanity in the treatment of the slaves and said that the actions of &quot;Zong&quot; crew were nothing less than murder. The historian James Walvin has argued that it is possible that Sharp directly influenced the strategy of the insurers&#x27; legal team.

At the hearing, new evidence was heard, that heavy rain had fallen on the ship on the second day of the killings but still a third batch of slaves was killed. This led Mansfield to order another trial, because the rainfall meant that the killing of those people, after the water shortage had been eased, could not be justified in terms of the greater necessity of saving the ship and the rest of the slaves aboard. One of the judges also said that this evidence invalidated the findings of the jury in the first trial, as the jury had heard testimony that the water shortage resulted from the poor condition of the ship, brought on by unforeseen maritime conditions, rather than from errors committed by its captain. Mansfield concluded that the insurers were not liable for losses resulting from errors committed by &quot;Zong&quot; crew.

There is no evidence that another trial was held on this issue. Despite Sharp&#x27;s efforts, no member of the crew was prosecuted for murder. Even so, the &quot;Zong&quot; case did eventually gain both national and international attention. A summary of the appeal on the &quot;Zong&quot; case was eventually published in the nominate reports prepared from the contemporaneous manuscript notes of Sylvester Douglas, Baron Glenbervie, and others. It was published in 1831 as &quot;Gregson v Gilbert&quot; (1783) 3 Doug. KB 232.

=== Mansfield&#x27;s motives ===
Jeremy Krikler has argued that Mansfield wanted to ensure that commercial law remained as helpful to Britain&#x27;s overseas trade as possible and as a consequence was keen to uphold the principle of &quot;general average&quot;, even in relation to the killing of humans. For Mansfield to have found in favour of the insurers would have greatly undermined this idea. The revelation that rain had fallen during the period of the killings enabled Mansfield to order a retrial, while leaving the notion of &quot;general average&quot; intact. He emphasised that the massacre would have been legally justified and the owners&#x27; insurance claim would have been valid if the water shortage had not arisen from mistakes made by the captain. 

Krikler comments that Mansfield&#x27;s conclusions ignored the ruling precedent of his predecessor, Sir Matthew Hale, that the killing of innocents in the name of self-preservation was unlawful. This ruling was to prove important a century later in &quot;R v Dudley and Stephens&quot;, which also concerned the justifiability of acts of murder at sea. Mansfield also failed to acknowledge another important legal principle—that no insurance claim can be legal if it arose from an illegal act.

== Effect on the abolitionist movement ==
Granville Sharp campaigned to raise awareness of the massacre, writing letters to newspapers, the Lords Commissioners of Admiralty and the Prime Minister (the Duke of Portland). Neither Portland nor the Admiralty sent him a reply. Only one London newspaper reported the first &quot;Zong&quot; trial in March 1783 but it provided details of events. The newspaper article in March 1783 was the first public report of the massacre and it was published nearly 18 months after the event. Little else about the massacre appeared in print before 1787.

Despite these setbacks, Sharp&#x27;s efforts did have some success. In April 1783, he sent an account of the massacre to William Dillwyn, a Quaker, who had asked to see evidence that was critical of the slave trade. The London Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends decided shortly after to begin campaigning against slavery and a petition signed by 273 Quakers was submitted to parliament in July 1783. Sharp also sent letters to Anglican bishops and clergy and to those already sympathetic to the abolitionist cause.

The immediate effect of the &quot;Zong&quot; massacre on public opinion was limited, demonstrating—as the historian of abolitionism Seymour Drescher has noted—the challenge that the early abolitionists faced. Following Sharp&#x27;s efforts, the &quot;Zong&quot; massacre became an important topic in abolitionist literature and the massacre was discussed in works by Thomas Clarkson, Ottobah Cugoano, James Ramsay and John Newton. These accounts often omitted the names of the ship and its captain, thereby creating, in the words of Srividhya Swaminathan, &quot;a portrait of abuse that could be mapped onto any ship in the Middle Passage&quot;. The &quot;Zong&quot; killings offered a powerful example of the horrors of the slave trade, stimulating the development of the abolitionist movement in Britain, which dramatically expanded in size and influence in the late 1780s. In 1787, the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was founded.

Parliament received numerous petitions against the slave trade and examined the issue in 1788. With strong support by Sir William Dolben, who had toured a slave ship, it passed the Slave Trade Act 1788 (Dolben&#x27;s Act), which was its first legislation to regulate the slave trade. It restricted the number of slaves that could be transported, to reduce problems of overcrowding and poor sanitation. Its renewal in 1794 included an amendment that limited the scope of insurance policies concerning slaves, rendering illegal such generalised phrases that promised to insure against &quot;all other Perils, Losses, and Misfortunes&quot;. (The &quot;Zong&quot; owners&#x27; representatives had highlighted such a phrase in seeking their claim at the King&#x27;s Bench hearing.) The act had to be renewed annually and Dolben led these efforts, speaking frequently to parliament in opposition to slavery. The Slave Trade Act 1799 was passed to make these provisions permanent.

Abolitionists, notably William Wilberforce, continued their effort to end the slave trade. Britain passed the Slave Trade Act 1807, which prohibited the Atlantic slave trade and the Royal Navy enforced the Blockade of Africa. The United States also prohibited the Atlantic slave trade in 1808 and helped intercept illegal slave ships at sea, predominately after 1842.

In 1823, the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery Throughout the British Dominions (known as the first Anti-Slavery Society) was founded in Britain, dedicated to abolishing slavery throughout the British Empire; the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 represented the achievement of their goal. The &quot;Zong&quot; massacre was frequently cited in abolitionist literature in the 19th century; Thomas Clarkson&#x27;s 1808 &quot;History of the Rise, Progress, and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the African Slave Trade By the British Parliament&quot; included an account of killings, and was known to Jane Austen when she was writing &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; (1814), with its many allusions to the slave trade in Antigua.

The 1839 edition of Clarkson&#x27;s book had an important influence on the artist J. M. W. Turner, who displayed a painting at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1840 entitled &quot;The Slave Ship&quot;. The painting depicts a vessel from which a number of manacled slaves have been thrown into the sea, to be devoured by sharks. Some of the details in the painting, such as the shackles worn by the slaves, appear to have been influenced by the illustrations in Clarkson&#x27;s book. The painting was shown at an important time in the movement to abolish slavery in the world, as the Royal Academy exhibition opened one month before the first World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. The painting was admired by its owner, John Ruskin. It has been described by the 20th-century critic Marcus Wood as one of the few truly great depictions in Western art of the Atlantic slave trade.

== Representations in modern culture ==
The &quot;Zong&quot; massacre has inspired several works of literature. Fred D&#x27;Aguiar&#x27;s novel &quot;Feeding the Ghosts&quot; (1997) tells the story of an African who survives being thrown overboard from the &quot;Zong&quot;. In the novel, the journal of the slave—Mintah—is lost, unlike that of Granville Sharp. According to the cultural historian Anita Rupprecht, this signifies the silencing of African voices about the massacre.

Margaret Busby&#x27;s play &quot;An African Cargo&quot;, staged in 2007 by Nitro theatre company at Greenwich Theatre and directed by Felix Cross, dealt with the massacre and the 1783 trials, making use of the original legal transcripts, with interspersed songs performed &quot;a cappella&quot; by the cast including &quot;Steal Away&quot;.

M. NourbeSe Philip&#x27;s 2008 book of poems &quot;Zong!&quot; is based on the events surrounding the massacre and uses the account of the King&#x27;s Bench hearing as its primary material. Philip&#x27;s text physically deconstructs the account as a method for undermining the document&#x27;s authority.

An episode of the television programme &quot;Garrow&#x27;s Law&quot; (2010) is loosely based on the legal events arising from the massacre. The historical William Garrow did not take part in the case, and because the &quot;Zong&quot; captain died shortly after arriving in Jamaica, his appearance in court for fraud is also fictional.

In 2014–15, David Boxer, an artist from Jamaica, painted &quot;Passage: Flotsam and Jetsam III (Zong)&quot;.

A play developed by Giles Terera, titled &quot;The Meaning of Zong&quot;, also deals with the massacre and the 1783 trials. It was jointly commissioned by the Royal National Theatre and three regional theatres and was first staged at the Bristol Old Vic in April 2022.

&quot;The Ship They Called The Zong&quot; is a short film that accompanies a 2020 poem of that name by Liam Doyle and features a number of paintings, photographs and wood cuttings representing various aspects of the Transatlantic slave trade. Some of them, such as the Turner painting and the wood cutting, depict the actual massacre itself.

The &quot;Zong&quot; legal case is the main theme of the 2013 British period drama film &quot;Belle&quot;, directed by Amma Asante.

In 2023, Amanda Gorman published the poem &quot;These Means of Dying&quot;—inspired by Philip&#x27;s poem &quot;Zong!&quot; and also composed of words from the same court report—in a &quot;New York Times&quot; column op-ed about the &quot;Adriana&quot; disaster that left hundreds of migrants dead in the Mediterranean Sea.

=== 2007 abolition commemorations ===

In 2007, a memorial stone was erected at Black River, Jamaica, near where &quot;Zong&quot; would have landed. A sailing ship representing &quot;Zong&quot; was sailed to Tower Bridge in London in March 2007 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, at a cost of £300,000. The vessel housed depictions of the &quot;Zong&quot; massacre and the slave trade. It was accompanied by , on board which was an exhibition commemorating the role of the Royal Navy after 1807 in the suppression of the slave trade.

<text>Flogging a dead horse (or beating a dead horse in American English) is an idiom meaning that a particular effort is futile.

==Early usage==
The expression is said to have been popularized by the English politician and orator John Bright. Speaking in the House of Commons in March 1859 on Bright&#x27;s efforts to promote parliamentary reform, Lord Elcho remarked that Bright had not been &quot;satisfied with the results of his winter campaign&quot; and that &quot;a saying was attributed to him [Bright] that he [had] found he was &#x27;flogging a dead horse&#x27;.&quot;

The earliest instance cited in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; dates from 1872, when &quot;The Globe&quot; newspaper, reporting the Prime Minister, William Gladstone&#x27;s, futile efforts to defend the Ecclesiastical Courts and Registries Bill in the Commons, observed that he &quot;might be said to have rehearsed that particularly lively operation known as flogging a dead horse&quot;.

==Earlier related terms==
The phrase may have originated in 17th-century slang, when a horse symbolized hard work. A &quot;dead horse&quot; came to mean something that had become useless. In gambling, &quot;playing a dead horse&quot; meant wagering on something, such as a hand of cards, that was almost sure to lose. In a 17th-century quote from a collection of documents owned by the late Earl of Oxford, Edward Harley,

In journeyman printer&#x27;s slang from the 18th and 19th centuries, work that was charged for on a bill, but not yet carried out, was called &quot;horse&quot;. Carrying out that work was said to be &quot;working for a dead horse&quot;, since no additional benefit would be gained by the labourer when the work was complete.

Many sailors were paid in advance for their first month&#x27;s work. In his book &quot;Old England and New Zealand&quot;, author Alfred Simmons gives a detailed explanation and background of the &quot;Flogging the Dead Horse&quot; ceremony, performed by a ship&#x27;s crew at the end of the first month of their voyage at which time wages resumed. The sailors would get paid in advance of leaving the harbour, spend their money, and embark the ship with nothing. This situation allowed them to exclaim the horse symbolising their usual hard work, without money for motivation, was dead. However, once a month had passed, the sailors would have reached the Horse latitudes where wages due and paid would prompt the horse to live again.

One of the earliest synonyms may be found in an ancient Greek play by Sophocles, &quot;Antigone&quot;,

== Criticism and proposed replacement by PETA ==
In 2018, the organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) campaigned for the general public to cease usage of the idiom, along with other idioms which mentioned animals, to &quot;remove speciesism from daily conversation&quot;. As an alternative, PETA proposed that the general public replace &quot;beating a dead horse&quot; with &quot;feeding a fed horse&quot;. PETA justified the replacement by claiming on Twitter that in the same way, &quot;as it became unacceptable to use racist, homophobic, or ableist language, phrases that trivialize cruelty to animals will vanish as more people begin to appreciate animals for who they are and start &#x27;bringing home the bagels&#x27; instead of the bacon.&quot;

PETA faced ridicule for the suggestion, such as from late night comedy hosts, Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers.

<text>Cooloola is a genus of ensiferan orthopterans known as Cooloola monsters. It is the only genus in the subfamily Cooloolinae and family Cooloolidae of the superfamily Stenopelmatoidea.

Four species are known from this family, all endemic to Queensland, Australia. The name originated from the discovery of the best-known member of the family, the Cooloola monster (&quot;Cooloola propator&quot;), in the Cooloola National Park.

Little is known about their life histories as they lead an almost entirely subterranean existence, but they are believed to prey on other soil-dwelling invertebrates. Cooloola monsters are unusual in comparison with other members of the primitive superfamily Stenopelmatoidea in that the &#x27; antennae are considerably shorter than their body lengths.

==Classification==
While often treated as a family, molecular evidence suggests that are in fact aberrant members of the family Anostostomatidae, and the genus &quot;Cooloola&quot; might not be monophyletic.

Species include:
*&quot;Cooloola dingo&quot; – dingo monster
*&quot;Cooloola pearsoni&quot; – Pearson&#x27;s monster
*&quot;Cooloola propator&quot; – Cooloola monster
*&quot;Cooloola ziljan&quot; – sugarcane monster

<doc id="1025653" wikidata="Q2161046" url="?curid=1025653" title="Ainhum">
<text>Ainhum (from Portuguese, ), also known as dactylolysis spontanea, is a painful constriction of the base of the fifth toe frequently followed by bilateral spontaneous autoamputation a few years later.

==Signs and symptoms==
The groove begins on the lower and internal side of the base of the fifth toe, usually according to the plantar-digital fold. The groove becomes gradually deeper and more circular. The rate of spread is variable, and the disease may progress to a full circle in a few months, or still be incomplete after years. In about 75 percent of cases both feet are affected, though not usually to the same degree. There is no case reported where it begins in any other toe than the fifth, while there is occasionally a groove on the fourth or third toe. The distal part of the toe swells and appears like a small potato. The swelling is due to lymphatic edema distal to the constriction. After a time crusts can appear in the groove which can be infected with staphylococcus. 
While the groove becomes deeper, compression of tendons, vessels and nerves occurs. Bone is absorbed by pressure, without any evidence of infection. After a certain time all structures distal the stricture are reduced to an avascular cord. The toe’s connection to the foot becomes increasingly slender, and if it is not amputated, it spontaneously drops off without any bleeding. Normally it takes about five years for an autoamputation to occur.

Cole describes four stages of ainhum:
Pain is present in about 78% of cases. Slight pain is present in the earliest stage of ainhum, caused by pressure on the underlying nerves. Fracture of the phalanx or chronic sepsis is accompanied with severe pain.

==Cause==
The true cause of ainhum remains unclear. It is not due to infection by parasites, fungi, bacteria or virus, and it is not related to injury. Walking barefoot in childhood had been linked to this disease, but ainhum also occurs in patients who have never gone barefoot. Race seems to be one of the most predisposing factors and it may have a genetic component, since it has been reported to occur within families. Dent et al. discussed a genetically caused abnormality of the blood supply to the foot. It has been related to inadequate posterior tibial artery circulation and absence of plantar arch.

==Diagnosis==

===Histolopathology===
Histology shows a change in the prickle cell layer, and this is responsible for the laying down of condensed keratin causing the groove. The junctional tissue is reduced to a slender fibrous thread, almost avascular, and all the tissues beyond the constricting band is repressed by a fibro-fatty mass covered by hyperkeratotic integument.

===Imaging===
Soft tissue constriction on the medial aspect of the fifth toe is the most frequently presented radiological sign in the early stages. Distal swelling of the toe is considered to be a feature of the disease. In grade III lesions osteolysis is seen in the region of the proximal interphalangeal joint with a characteristic tapering effect. Dispersal of the head of the proximal phalanx is frequently seen. Finally, after autoamputation, the base of the proximal phalanx remains. Radiological examination allows early diagnosis and staging of ainhum. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent amputation.
Doppler shows decreased blood flow in posterior tibial artery.

===Differential diagnosis===
Ainhum is an acquired and progressive condition, and thus differs from congenital annular constrictions. Ainhum has been much confused with similar constrictions caused by other diseases such as leprosy, diabetic gangrene, syringomyelia, scleroderma or Vohwinkel syndrome. In this case, it is called pseudo-ainhum, treatable with minor surgery or intralesional corticosteroids, as with ainhum. It has even been seen in psoriasis or it is acquired by the wrapping toes, penis or nipple with hairs, threads or fibers. Oral retinoids, such as tretinoin, and antifibrotic agents like tranilast have been tested for pseudo-ainhum. Impending amputation in Vohwinkel syndrome can sometimes be aborted by therapy with oral etretinate. It is rarely seen in the United States but often discussed in the international medical literature.

==Prevention==
Wearing shoes to protect barefoot trauma has shown decrease in incidence in ainhum. Congenital pseudoainhum cannot be prevented and can lead to serious birth defects.

==Treatment==
Incisions across the groove turned out to be ineffective. Excision of the groove followed by z-plasty could relieve pain and prevent autoamputation in Grade I and Grade II lesions. Grade III lesions are treated with disarticulating the metatarsophalangeal joint. This also relieves pain, and all patients have a useful and stable foot. Intralesional injection of corticosteroids is also helpful.

==Epidemiology==
Ainhum is an extremely rare disease with prevalence reported between 0.015% and 2.2% of the population. Ainhum occurs worldwide, but is most common in people of sub-Saharan African origin. It is more common in men than in women (2:1) between 20 and 50 years of age. The average age is about thirty-eight. The youngest recorded patient was seven years old. Ainhum is often familial. 

==History==
The first description of ainhum in the West appears to have been provided by English surgeon Robert Clarke, who made a passing reference to &quot;dry gangrene of the little toe&quot; as a common occurrence in the Gold Coast in an 1860 report to the Epidemiological Society of London, but did not recognize it as a distinct entity and believed it to be a consequence of &quot;suppressed yaws&quot;. Ainhum was first recognized as a distinct disease and described as such in detail by Brazilian physician José Francisco da Silva Lima (1826–1910), in 1867. The name &quot;ainhum&quot; (from the Yoruba &quot;ayùn&quot;, meaning &quot;to saw&quot; or &quot;to file&quot;) was used to refer to the disease by Yoruba speakers in Bahia, Brazil, where Silva Lima practiced.

The first histological studies of ainhum were conducted by O. E. H. Wucherer and published in 1872, and the first imaging studies were conducted in 1924.

<doc id="1025654" wikidata="Q253860" url="?curid=1025654" title="Ozzmosis">
<text>Ozzmosis is the seventh studio album by English heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne. Recorded in Paris and New York with producer Michael Beinhorn, it was released on 23 October 1995 by Epic Records. The album reached number 22 on the UK Albums Chart and number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;See You on the Other Side&quot; and &quot;I Just Want You&quot; were released as singles.

After the release of his sixth album &quot;No More Tears&quot; in 1991, Osbourne announced that he would retire from music. However, he returned with &quot;Ozzmosis&quot; in 1995, which featured long-time guitarist Zakk Wylde as well as former Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Deen Castronovo. Producer Michael Beinhorn played most of the keyboards on the album, while Rick Wakeman played the Mellotron on the songs &quot;Perry Mason&quot; and &quot;I Just Want You&quot;. Osbourne later appeared as a guest vocalist on Wakeman&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Return to the Centre of the Earth&quot;.

&quot;Ozzmosis&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. It was one of many Osbourne albums remastered and reissued in 2002. The reissue featured bonus tracks &quot;Whole World&#x27;s Fallin&#x27; Down&quot; and &quot;Aimee&quot;, originally released as B-sides to &quot;Perry Mason&quot; and &quot;See You on the Other Side&quot;, respectively. The album has been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and has sold over 3 million copies.

==Recording and production==
Recording took place at Guillaume Tell Studios in Paris, France, Right Track Recording and Electric Lady Studios in New York City, and Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York. Production was led by Michael Beinhorn, with Paul Northfield engineering and David Bianco mixing. Writing credits on the album – alongside Osbourne, guitarist Zakk Wylde and bassist Geezer Butler – were shared by John Purdell, Jim Vallance, Mark Hudson, Steve Dudas, Lemmy Kilmister, Duane Baron and Steve Vai.

&quot;Ozzmosis&quot; was Ozzy&#x27;s first and only album to feature Butler, drummer Deen Castronovo and keyboardist Rick Wakeman. Guitars were by his long-time band member Wylde, although Steve Vai was originally slated to perform on the album after writing songs with Osbourne in 1994 (of which only &quot;My Little Man&quot; remained). Vai reportedly left the project due to a &quot;falling out&quot; with Osbourne, although Wylde maintains they are still friends.

Prior to Beinhorn&#x27;s involvement, &quot;Ozzmosis&quot; was to be produced by Michael Wagener, who had mixed the preceding &quot;No More Tears&quot;. Songs were recorded with Wagener, and a different lineup including bassist Mike Inez and drummer Randy Castillo, with the intention of making the album sound similar to &quot;No More Tears&quot;. Pre Production with that lineup happened at Granny&#x27;s House Recording Studio in Reno, NV in early 1994 after the &quot;No More Tours&quot; Tour. However, with seven songs completed, Epic Records allegedly requested a change in production style and replaced Wagener with Beinhorn. Of Wagener&#x27;s produced material, &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;See You on the Other Side&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Old LA Tonight&quot; were rerecorded with Beinhorn, &quot;Aimee&quot; and &quot;Living with the Enemy&quot; were released as B-sides, and &quot;Slow Burn&quot; remained unreleased. Wagener&#x27;s version of &quot;See You on the Other Side&quot; was later released on 2005 box set &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; and his demo of &quot;Perry Mason&quot; was released in 2005.

&quot;After doing &quot;Ozzmosis&quot; with Michael Beinhorn producing,&quot; Ozzy remarked in 2001, &quot;I didn&#x27;t care if I never made another album again. There&#x27;d be these fucking mind games. He&#x27;d have me singing all day, and then I&#x27;d get three-quarters through and he&#x27;d go, &#x27;Your voice sounds tired. Let&#x27;s pick it up tomorrow.&#x27; And I knew that the next day he&#x27;d go, &#x27;Your voice has changed. Let&#x27;s start again.

==Promotion and release==
Three singles were released from &quot;Ozzmosis&quot;. The first was &quot;Perry Mason&quot; in November 1995, which reached number 23 on the UK Singles Chart and number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Songs chart. &quot;See You on the Other Side&quot;, released on 9 January 1996, charted in the US at number five on the Mainstream Rock chart and in Sweden at number 59. The third and final single, &quot;I Just Want You&quot;, charted in the UK at number 43 and in the US at number 24 on the Mainstream Rock chart.

In support of the album, Osbourne and his band completed the Retirement Sucks! Tour, named in reference to Osbourne&#x27;s previous tour, the No More Tours Tour, which was originally slated to be his last before his retirement from music. The tour started in Monterrey and Mexico City on 26–28 August. Speaking about his return to touring, Osbourne joked that &quot;If you stayed at home, day in and day out, for 3 years with your wife and a house full of screaming kids, you&#x27;d want to get back out on the road too!&quot; The tour continued through 1996.

==Reception==
===Commercial===
&quot;Ozzmosis&quot; charted at number 22 on the UK Albums Chart, five places lower than its predecessor &quot;No More Tears&quot; and three places lower than its successor &quot;Down to Earth&quot;. It was more successful in the United States, reaching number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the highest position achieved by Osbourne on the chart at the time. The album also reached the top ten in Finland and Sweden, the top 30 in Germany, New Zealand and Norway, the top 40 in Switzerland, and the top 50 in Australia.

By the end of 1995, &quot;Ozzmosis&quot; was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, indicating US sales of over 1 million units; in April 1999, the RIAA certified the album double platinum. The album was also certified platinum by Music Canada, indicating sales in the country of over 80,000 units. According to &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, &quot;Ozzmosis&quot; has sold in excess of 3 million copies in total. As of the 2010 release of &quot;Scream&quot;, &quot;Ozzmosis&quot; is the latest Osbourne studio album to be certified multi-platinum by the RIAA.

===Critical===

&quot;Ozzmosis&quot; received mostly mixed reviews from critics. Writing for music website AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine criticised the album for its lack of evolution from previous releases &quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot; and &quot;No More Tears&quot;. Despite praising the &quot;still impressive&quot; skills of guitarist Zakk Wylde, Erlewine condemned the &quot;modern-rock conscious&quot; production style of producer Michael Beinhorn, which he claimed was the cause of the album&#x27;s main problem – that &quot;on the surface, the music is hard and loud, but it actually sounds smooth and processed&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; critic Chuck Eddy claimed that due to the long running lengths of tracks on the album, &quot;Ozzmosis&quot; &quot;feels like a parody of the most overinflated opera&quot;.

Retrospectively, writers for both Blabbermouth.net and PopMatters have criticised &quot;Ozzmosis&quot; in reviews of later Ozzy Osbourne albums. Nick DeRiso of Ultimate Classic Rock ranked &quot;Ozzmosis&quot; as the eighth best Osbourne album, ahead of only &quot;Down to Earth&quot;, &quot;Under Cover&quot; and &quot;Scream&quot;, criticising the production style of the album. Writing for Loudwire on the 20th anniversary of the album, Jon Wiederhorn described &quot;Ozzmosis&quot; as &quot;a more sonically pristine, but natural extension of the type of melodic hard rock/metal songwriting&quot; on Osbourne&#x27;s previous two albums, noting the presence of &quot;raging rockers ... fist-raising anthems ... and teary ballads&quot;.

<text>The Balassa–Samuelson effect, also known as Harrod–Balassa–Samuelson effect (Kravis and Lipsey 1983), the Ricardo–Viner–Harrod–Balassa–Samuelson–Penn–Bhagwati effect (Samuelson 1994, p. 201), or productivity biased purchasing power parity (PPP) (Officer 1976) is the tendency for consumer prices to be systematically higher in more developed countries than in less developed countries. This observation about the systematic differences in consumer prices is called the &quot;Penn effect&quot;. The Balassa–Samuelson hypothesis is the proposition that this can be explained by the greater variation in productivity between developed and less developed countries in the traded goods&#x27; sectors which in turn affects wages and prices in the non-tradable goods sectors. 

Béla Balassa and Paul Samuelson independently proposed the causal mechanism for the Penn effect in the early 1960s.

==Theory==
The Balassa–Samuelson effect depends on inter-country differences in the relative productivity of the tradable and non-tradable sectors.

===Empirical &quot;Penn Effect&quot;===
By the law of one price, entirely tradable goods cannot vary greatly in price by location because buyers can source from the lowest cost location. However, most services must be delivered locally (e.g. hairdressing), and many manufactured goods such as furniture have high transportation costs or, conversely, low value-to-weight or low value-to-bulk ratios, which makes deviations from the law of one price, known as purchasing power parity or PPP-deviations, persistent. The Penn effect is that PPP-deviations usually occur in the same direction: where incomes are high, average price levels are typically high.

===Basic form of the effect===
The simplest model which generates a Balassa–Samuelson effect has two countries, two goods (one tradable, and a country-specific nontradable) and one factor of production, labor. For simplicity assume that productivity, as measured by marginal product (in terms of goods produced) of labor, in the nontradable sector is equal between countries and normalized to one.

formula_1

where &quot;nt&quot; denotes the nontradable sector and 1 and 2 indexes the two countries.

In each country, under the assumption of competition in the labor market the wage ends up being equal to the value of the marginal product, or the sector&#x27;s price times MPL. (Note that this is not necessary, just sufficient, to produce the Penn effect. What is needed is that wages are at least related to productivity.)

formula_2

formula_3

Where the subscript &quot;t&quot; denotes the tradables sector. Note that the lack of a country specific subscript on the price of tradables means that tradable goods prices are equalized between the two countries.

Suppose that country 2 is the more productive, and hence, the wealthier one. This means that

formula_4

which implies that

formula_5.

So with a same (world) price for tradable goods, the price of nontradable goods will be lower in the less productive country, resulting in an overall lower price level.

===Details===
A typical discussion of this argument would include the following features:
*Workers in some countries have higher productivity than in others. This is the ultimate source of the income differential. (Also expressed as productivity growth.)
*Certain labour-intensive jobs are less responsive to productivity innovations than others. For instance, a highly skilled Zürich burger flipper is no more productive than his Moscow counterpart (in burger/hour) but these jobs are services which must be performed locally.
*The fixed-productivity sectors are also the ones producing non-transportable goods (for instance haircuts) – this must be the case or the labour intensive work would have been off-shored.
*To &quot;equalize local wage levels&quot; with the (highly productive) Zürich engineers, Zürich fast food employees must be paid more than Moscow fast food employees, even though the burger production rate per employee is an international constant.
*The CPI is made up of:
**local goods (which in richer countries are more expensive relative to tradables), and
**tradables, which have the same price everywhere
*The (real) exchange rate is pegged (by the law of one price) so that tradable goods follow PPP (purchasing power parity). The assumption that PPP holds only for tradable goods is testable.
*Since money exchange rates will vary fully with tradable goods productivity, but average productivity varies to a lesser extent, the (real goods) productivity differential is less than the productivity differential in money terms.
*Productivity becomes income, so the real income varies less than the money income does.
*This is equivalent to saying that the money exchange rate exaggerates the real income, or that the price level is higher in more productive, richer, economies.

===Equivalent Balassa–Samuelson effect within a country===
The average asking price for a house in a prosperous city can be ten times that of an identical house in a depressed area of the &quot;same country&quot;. Therefore, the RER-deviation exists independent of what happens to the &quot;nominal exchange rate&quot; (which is always 1 for areas sharing the same currency). Looking at the price level distribution within a country gives a clearer picture of the effect, because this removes some complicating factors:
# The econometrics of purchasing power parity (PPP) tests are complicated by nominal exchange rate noise. (This noise would be an econometric problem, even assuming that the exchange rate volatility is a pure error term).
# There may be some real economy border effects between countries which limit the flow of tradables or people.
# Monetary effects, and exchange rate movements can affect the real economy and complicate the picture, a problem eliminated if comparing regions that use the same currency unit.
# Taxes are very different in many countries, whereas in a same country taxes are usually equal or similar.

A pint of pub beer is famously more expensive in the south of England than the north, but supermarket beer prices are very similar. This may be treated as anecdotal evidence in favour of the Balassa–Samuelson hypothesis, since supermarket beer is an easily transportable, traded good. (Although pub beer is transportable, the pub itself is not.) The BS-hypothesis explanation for the price differentials is that the &#x27;productivity&#x27; of pub employees (in pints served per hour) is more uniform than the &#x27;productivity&#x27; (in foreign currency earned per year) of people working in the dominant tradable sector in each region of the country (financial services in the south of England, manufacturing in the north). Although the employees of southern pubs are not significantly more productive than their counterparts in the north, southern pubs must pay wages comparable to those offered by other southern firms in order to keep their staff. This results in southern pubs incurring a higher labour cost per pint served.

==Empirical evidence on the Balassa–Samuelson effect==
Evidence for the Penn effect is well established in today&#x27;s world (and is readily observable when traveling internationally). However, the Balassa–Samuelson (BS) hypothesis implies that countries with rapidly expanding economies should tend to have more rapidly appreciating exchange rates (for instance the Four Asian Tigers); conventional econometric tests yield mixed findings for this prediction.

In total, since it was (re)discovered in 1964, according to Tica and Druzic (2006) the HBS theory &quot;has been tested 60 times in 98 countries in time series or panel analyses and in 142 countries in cross-country analyses. In these analyzed estimates, country specific HBS coefficients have been estimated 166 times in total, and at least once for 65 different countries&quot;. Many papers have been published since then. Bahmani-Oskooee and Abm (2005) &amp; Egert, Halpern and McDonald (2006) also provide quite interesting surveys of empirical evidence on BS effect.

Over time, the testing of the HBS model has evolved quite dramatically. Panel data and time series techniques have crowded out old cross-section tests, demand side and terms of trade variables have emerged as explanatory variables, new econometric methodologies have replaced old ones, and recent improvements with endogenous tradability have provided direction for future researchers.

The sector approach combined with panel data analysis and/or cointegration has become a benchmark for empirical tests. Consensus has been reached on the testing of internal and external HBS effects (vis a vis a numeraire country) with a strong reservation against the purchasing power parity assumption in the tradable sector.

The vast majority of the evidence supports the HBS model. A deeper analysis of the empirical evidence shows that the strength of the results is strongly influenced by the nature of the tests and set of countries analyzed. Almost all cross-section tests confirm the model, while panel data results confirm the model for the majority of countries included in the tests. Although some negative results have been returned, there has been strong support for the predictions of a cointegration between relative productivity and relative prices within a country and between countries, while the interpretation of evidence for cointegration between real exchange rate and relative productivity has been much more controversial.

Therefore, most of the contemporary authors (e.g.: Egert, Halpern and McDonald (2006); Drine &amp; Rault (2002)) analyze main BS assumptions separately:
# The differential of productivities between the traded and non-traded sector and relative prices are positively correlated.
# The purchasing power parity assumption is verified for tradable goods.
# The RER and relative prices of non-tradable goods are positively correlated.
# As a consequence of 1, 2, &amp; 3, there is a long-run relationship between productivity differentials and the RER.

Refinements to the econometric techniques and debate about alternative models are continuing in the International economics community. For instance:
:&quot;A possible explanation of the BS empirical rejection may simply be that there are additional long-run real exchange determinants that have to be considered.&quot; Drine &amp; Rault conclude.

The next section lists some of the alternative proposals to an explanation of the Penn effect, but there are significant econometric problems with testing the BS-hypothesis, and the lack of strong evidence for it between modern economies may not refute it, or even imply that it produces a small effect. For instance, other effects of exchange rate movements might mask the long-term BS-hypothesis mechanism (making it harder to detect if it exists). Exchange rate movements are believed by some to affect productivity; if this is true then regressing RER movements on differential productivity growth will be &#x27;polluted&#x27; by a totally different relationship between the variables1.

==Alternative, and additional causes of the Penn effect==

Most professional economists accept that the Balassa–Samuelson effect model has some merit. However other sources of the Penn effect RER/GDP relationship have been proposed:

===Distribution sector===
In a 2001 International Monetary Fund working paper Macdonald &amp; Ricci accept that relative productivity changes produce PPP-deviations, but argue that this is not confined to tradables versus non-tradable sectors. Quoting the abstract:An increase in the productivity and competitiveness of the distribution sector with respect to foreign countries leads to an appreciation of the real exchange rate, similarly to what a relative increase in the domestic productivity of tradables does.

=== Dutch Disease ===
Capital inflows (say to the Netherlands) may stimulate currency appreciation through demand for money. As the RER appreciates, the competitiveness of the traded-goods sectors falls (in terms of the international price of traded goods).

In this model, there has been no change in real economy productivities, but money price productivity in traded goods has been exogenously lowered through currency appreciation. Since capital inflow is associated with high-income states (e.g. Monaco) this could explain part of the RER/Income correlation.

Yves Bourdet and Hans Falck have studied the effect of Cape Verde remittances on the traded-goods sector. They find that, as local incomes have risen with a doubling of remittances from abroad, the Cape Verde RER has appreciated 14% (during the 1990s). The export sector of the Cape Verde economy suffered a similar fall in productivity during the same period, which was caused entirely by capital flows and not by the BS-effect.

=== Services are a &#x27;superior good&#x27; ===
Rudi Dornbusch (1998) and others say that income rises can change the ratio of demand for goods and services (tradable and non-tradable sectors). This is because services tend to be superior goods, which are consumed proportionately more heavily at higher incomes.

A shift in preferences at the microeconomic level, caused by an income effect can change the make-up of the consumer price index to include proportionately more expenditure on services. This alone may shift the consumer price index, and might make the non-traded sector look relatively less productive than it had been when demand was lower; if service quality (rather than quantity) follows diminishing returns to labour input, a general demand for a higher service quality automatically produces a reduction in per-capita productivity.

A typical labour market pattern is that high-GDP countries have a higher ratio of service-sector to traded-goods-sector employment than low-GDP countries. If the traded/non-traded consumption ratio is also correlated with the price level, the Penn effect would still be observed with labour productivity rising equally fast (in identical technologies) between countries.

===Protectionism===
Lipsey and Swedenborg (1996) show a strong correlation between the barriers to free trade and the domestic price level. If wealthy countries feel more able to protect their native producers than developing nations (e.g. with tariffs on agricultural imports) we should expect to see a correlation between rising GDP and rising prices (for goods in protected industries - especially food).

This explanation is similar to the BS-effect, since an industry needing protection must be measurably less productive in the world market of the commodity it produces. However, this reasoning is slightly different from the pure BS-hypothesis, because the goods being produced are &#x27;traded-goods&#x27;, even though protectionist measures mean that they are more expensive on the domestic market than the international market, so they will not be &quot;traded&quot; internationally

==Trade theory implications==
The supply-side economists (and others) have argued that raising international competitiveness through policies that promote traded goods sectors&#x27; productivity (at the expense of other sectors) will increase a nation&#x27;s GDP, and increase its standard of living, when compared with treating the sectors equally. The Balassa–Samuelson effect might be one reason to oppose this trade theory, because it predicts that: &quot;a GDP gain in traded goods does not lead to as much of an improvement in the living standard as an equal GDP increase in the non-traded sector&quot;. (This is due to the effect&#x27;s prediction that the CPI will increase by more in the former case.)

==History==
The Balassa–Samuelson effect model was developed independently in 1964 by Béla Balassa and Paul Samuelson. The effect had previously been hypothesized in the first edition of Roy Forbes Harrod&#x27;s &quot;International Economics&quot; (1939, pp. 71–77), but this portion was not included in subsequent editions.

Partly because empirical findings have been mixed, and partly to differentiate the model from its conclusion, modern papers tend to refer to the Balassa–Samuelson &quot;hypothesis&quot;, rather than the Balassa–Samuelson &quot;effect&quot;. (See for instance: &quot;A panel data analysis of the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis&quot;, referred to above.)

* Paper disputes the applicability of the &quot;law of one price&quot; to traded goods; so that the pure Balassa–Samuelson effect is an underestimate of likely RER changes - Cincibuch &amp; Podpiera (2004) studied the RER appreciation to explain why it exceeds the Balassa–Samuelson prediction in the case of bilateral &quot;German-Central European country trade&quot; as the traded goods&#x27; productivity gap has declined. They argue that in practise, border barriers mean that tradables appreciate with productivity, and say:
::&quot;Real appreciation is also observed in tradables and often accounts for the bulk in the overall appreciation&quot;.

<text>Sylvia Lynd ( Dryhurst; 1888 – 21 February 1952) was an Anglo-Irish poet, essayist, short story writer and novelist. She was born in London but both of her parents, A.R. Dryhurst and her mother, the suffragist writer Nora Dryhurst ( Robinson) were Dubliners. Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. From 1904 to 1906, Lynd studied at the Slade School of Fine Art, later moving on to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. Around this time, she was associated with the Inghinidhe na hÉireann, an Irish nationalist women’s organisation. In 1908, a monthly magazine was produced, Bean na hÉireann, which sought to discuss topics such as politics, the vote for women, language, and labour issues. Lynd edited the first issue before returning to England and Helena Molony took it over. 

In 1909, she married a journalist and man of letters, Robert Wilson Lynd, whom she had met at the London Gaelic League four years earlier. Born in Belfast to a Presbyterian minister, Robert Lynd wrote for &quot;The Northern Whig&quot; and later became a literary editor for the &quot;Daily News&quot; (later known as &quot;News Chronicle&quot;) and a columnist for &quot;New Statesman&quot;. They lived in Hampstead, London for many years and had two daughters, Máire (who was to marry Jack Gaster) and Sigle. Sylvia Dryhurst Lynd died in 1952, aged 63.

<doc id="1025668" wikidata="Q3480300" url="?curid=1025668" title="Grímur Jónsson Thorkelin">
<text>Grímur Jónsson Thorkelín (8 October 1752 – 4 March 1829) was an Icelandic–Danish-Norwegian scholar, who became the National Archivist of Norway and Denmark and Professor of Antiquities at Østfold University College.

In 1786, he travelled to England in order to search for documents relating to medieval Danish-English contacts and Anglo-Saxon manuscripts with Viking influence. In 1787, he hired British Museum employee James Matthews to transcribe the sole extant manuscript of the Old English epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; and made another copy himself. Matthews did not know Old English or the manuscript&#x27;s insular script, and so copied what he saw, not always rendering correctly; Thorkelin, on the other hand, had knowledge of Old English which led him to introduce various emendations where he thought the text was incorrect. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the prestigious and honorary American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1790.

Under a commission from the Danish, Norwegian and Icelandic government, Thorkelin had prepared &quot;Beowulf&quot; for publication by 1807. During the Battle of Copenhagen (1807) his house was burned and demolished due to fire, and the text (on which he had spent 20 years) was lost. The manuscripts survived, however, and Thorkelin began again. The poem was eventually published in 1815. Thorkelin was the first scholar to make a full translation of the poem, into Latin.

The Thorkelín transcriptions are now an important textual source for &quot;Beowulf&quot;, as the original manuscript&#x27;s margins have suffered from deterioration and vandalism throughout the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. His early copies provide a record in many areas where the text would otherwise be lost forever.

Thorkelín is generally regarded as one of the pioneering figures in Nordic and Germanic studies. Moreover, his visit to Britain reinvigorated interest and appreciation in the island&#x27;s Germanic past, in ways both scholarly and romantic. However, this view is not without its detractors; Magnús Fjalldal describes Thorkelín as &quot;essentially a fraud as a scholar&quot; and lists a number of errors in Thorkelín&#x27;s edition and translation, many of which were pointed out by contemporary scholars.

<text>Samuel Dick (November 14, 1740 – November 16, 1812) was an American physician who was a delegate for New Jersey to the Confederation Congress in 1784 and 1785.

Samuel was born at Nottingham in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland. He studied medicine in Scotland before he opened a practice in Salem in 1740. He married Sarah Sinnickson on October 10, 1773, and they had ten children (Rebecca, Mary, John, Samuel Jr., Andrew, Isabella, Anna, Samuel Stewart, William and Maria). Sarah was the daughter of Andrew Sinnickson, and her brother Thomas represented New Jersey in the first U.S. Congress.

Dick served in the New Jersey militia before and during the Revolutionary War. When the 2nd New Jersey Regiment joined the Continental Army and was assigned to cover the withdrawal after the failed invasion of Canada, he accompanied them north as a surgeon in 1776. In June, with the Canada assignment over he returned to New Jersey. Later that year he was appointed a colonel, commanding the western battalion of the Salem County militia.

Dick was first elected to represent Salem in the New Jersey General Assembly in 1777. He was also appointed collector of customs for the state&#x27;s western district in 1778. The state legislature elected him as a delegate to the Confederation Congress in 1783. In 1787, he was a delegate to the New Jersey convention that ratified the United States Constitution. He served for several years as a surrogate in the county courts for Salem County. He was a candidate in the 1792 United States House of Representatives election in New Jersey, in which the top 4 won; he finished 10th.

<doc id="1025688" wikidata="Q1644025" url="?curid=1025688" title="Hellmouth">
<text>A Hellmouth, or the jaws of Hell, is the entrance to Hell envisaged as the gaping mouth of a huge monster, an image which first appeared in Anglo-Saxon art, and then spread all over Europe. It remained very common in depictions of the &quot;Last Judgment&quot; and &quot;Harrowing of Hell&quot; until the end of the Middle Ages, and is still sometimes used during the Renaissance and after. It enjoyed something of a revival in polemical popular prints after the Protestant Reformation, when figures from the opposite side would be shown disappearing into the mouth. A notable late appearance is in the two versions of a painting by El Greco of about 1578. Political cartoons still showed Napoleon leading his troops into one.
Medieval theatre often had a hellmouth prop or mechanical device which was used to attempt to scare the audience by vividly dramatizing an entrance to Hell. These seem often to have featured a battlemented castle entrance, in painting usually associated with Heaven.

The Hellmouth was intended to remind a Christian audience of the danger of damnation. Those shown entering, or already inside, are typically shown naked, their clothing not having survived the General Resurrection of the Dead that is often part of the same image. Some, even if naked, wear headgear indicating their rank at the top of society, with the papal tiara, king&#x27;s crown and bishop&#x27;s mitre the most common. Far rarer are indications of people being non-Christian, such as the Jewish hat. 

==History==

The oldest example of an animal Hellmouth known to Meyer Schapiro was an ivory carving of c. 800 in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and he says most examples before the 12th century are English. Many show the Harrowing of Hell, which appealed to Anglo-Saxon taste, as a successful military raid by Christ. Schapiro speculates that the image may have drawn from the pagan myth of the Crack of Doom, with the mouth that of the wolf-monster Fenrir, slain by Vidar, who is used as a symbol of Christ on the Gosforth Cross and other pieces of Anglo-Scandinavian art. In the assimilation of Christianised Viking populations in northern England, the Church was surprisingly ready to allow the association of pagan mythological images with Christian ones, in hogback grave markers for example.
===Satan swallowing the damned===
In the Anglo-Saxon Vercelli Homilies (4:46-8) Satan is likened to a dragon swallowing the damned:

... ne cumaþ þa næfre of þæra wyrma seaðe &amp; of þæs dracan ceolan þe is Satan nemned.

[they] never come out of the pit of snakes and of the throat of the dragon which is called Satan.
===Association with Leviathan===
The whale-monster Leviathan (translated from Hebrew, Job 41:1, &quot;wreathed animal&quot;) has been equated with this description, although this is hard to confirm in the earliest appearances. However, in &quot;The Whale&quot;, an Old English poem from the Exeter Book, the mouth of Hell is compared to a whale&#x27;s mouth:

The whale has another trick: when he is hungry, he opens his mouth and a sweet smell comes out. The fish are tricked by the smell and they enter into his mouth. Suddenly the whale&#x27;s jaws close.

Likewise, any man who lets himself be tricked by a sweet smell and led to sin will go into hell, opened by the devil—if he has followed the pleasures of the body and not those of the spirit. When the devil has brought them to hell, he clashes together the jaws, the gates of hell. No one can get out from them, just as no fish can escape from the mouth of the whale.
===Association with Cerberus===
Later in the Middle Ages, the classical Cerberus also became associated with the image, although it is hardly likely that the Anglo-Saxons had him in mind. 
===Hellmouth as the mouth of Satan===
Satan himself is often shown sitting in Hell eating the damned, but according to G.D. Schmidt this is a separate image, and the Hellmouth should not be considered to be the mouth of Satan, although Hofmann is inclined to disagree with this. The Hellmouth never bites the damned, remaining wide open, ready for more.
===Decline of the motif in the Late Middle Ages===

In general the motif had fallen from favour in Italy and the Netherlands by the late 14th century, and is rarely seen in the many &quot;Last Judgement&quot;s in Early Netherlandish painting, but in the late medieval works by Hieronymous Bosch and his followers, where the wide interior of Hell is shown, there is often a Hellmouth leading to some special compartment. It continued in use in Germany and France. The Hellmouth appears, swallowing a bishop, at bottom left in &quot;The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot;, a famous woodcut by Albrecht Dürer (c. 1497–98).

<text>Microraptor (Greek, μικρός, &quot;mīkros&quot;: &quot;small&quot;; Latin, &quot;raptor&quot;: &quot;one who seizes&quot;) is a genus of small, four-winged dromaeosaurid dinosaurs. Numerous well-preserved fossil specimens have been recovered from Liaoning, China. They date from the early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation (Aptian stage), 125 to 120 million years ago. Three species have been named (&quot;M. zhaoianus&quot;, &quot;M. gui&quot;, and &quot;M. hanqingi&quot;), though further study has suggested that all of them represent variation in a single species, which is properly called &quot;M. zhaoianus&quot;. Cryptovolans, initially described as another four-winged dinosaur, is usually considered to be a synonym of &quot;Microraptor&quot;.

Like &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, well-preserved fossils of &quot;Microraptor&quot; provide important evidence about the evolutionary relationship between birds and earlier dinosaurs. &quot;Microraptor&quot; had long pennaceous feathers that formed aerodynamic surfaces on the arms and tail but also on the legs. This led paleontologist Xu Xing in 2003 to describe the first specimen to preserve this feature as a &quot;four-winged dinosaur&quot; and to speculate that it may have glided using all four limbs for lift. Subsequent studies have suggested that &quot;Microraptor&quot; was capable of powered flight as well.

&quot;Microraptor&quot; was among the most abundant non-avialan dinosaurs in its ecosystem, and the genus is represented by more fossils than any other dromaeosaurid, with possibly over 300 fossil specimens represented across various museum collections. One specimen in particular shows evidence of active primary feather moulting, which is one of the few known fossil evidence of such behavior among pennaraptoran dinosaurs.

==History==
===Naming controversy===
The initial naming of &quot;Microraptor&quot; was controversial, because of the unusual circumstances of its first description. The first specimen to be described was part of a chimeric specimen—a patchwork of different feathered dinosaur species (&quot;Microraptor&quot; itself, &quot;Yanornis&quot; and an as-of-yet undescribed third species) assembled from multiple specimens in China and smuggled to the USA for sale. After the forgery was revealed by Xu Xing of Beijing&#x27;s Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Storrs L. Olson, curator of birds in the National Museum of Natural History of the Smithsonian Institution, published a description of the Microraptor&#x27;s tail in an obscure journal, giving it the name &quot;Archaeoraptor liaoningensis&quot; in an attempt to remove the name from the paleornithological record by assigning it to the part least likely to be a bird. However, Xu had discovered the remains of the specimen from which the tail had been taken and published a description of it later that year, giving it the name &quot;Microraptor zhaoianus&quot;.

Since the two names designate the same individual as the type specimen, &quot;Microraptor zhaoianus&quot; would have been a junior objective synonym of &quot;Archaeoraptor liaoningensis&quot; and the latter, if valid, would have had priority under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. However, there is some doubt whether Olson in fact succeeded in meeting all the formal requirements for establishing a new taxon. Namely, Olson designated the specimen as a lectotype, before an actual type species was formally erected. A similar situation arose with &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; and &quot;Manospondylus gigas&quot;, in which the former became a &quot;nomen protectum&quot; and the latter a &quot;nomen oblitum&quot; due to revisions in the ICZN rules that took place on December 31, 1999. In addition, Xu&#x27;s name for the type specimen (&quot;Microraptor&quot;) was subsequently used more frequently than the original name; as such, this and the chimeric nature of the specimen would render the name &quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; a &quot;nomen vanum&quot; (as it was improperly described) and the junior synonym &quot;Microraptor&quot; a &quot;nomen protectum&quot; (as it&#x27;s been used in more published works than &quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; and was properly described).

===Additional specimens===

The first specimen referred to &quot;Microraptor&quot; represented a small individual and included faint feather remnants, but was otherwise not well preserved and lacked a skull.
In 2002 Mark Norell et al. described another specimen, BPM 1 3-13, which they did not name or refer to an existing species. Later that year Stephen Czerkas et al. named the specimen &quot;Cryptovolans pauli&quot;, and referred two additional specimens (the first to show well-preserved feathers) to this species. The generic name was derived from Greek &quot;kryptos&quot;, &quot;hidden&quot;, and Latin &quot;volans&quot;, &quot;flying&quot;. The specific name, &quot;pauli&quot;, honors paleontologist Gregory S. Paul, who had long proposed that dromaeosaurids evolved from flying ancestors.

The type specimens of &quot;C. pauli&quot; were collected from the Jiufotang Formation, dating from the early Albian and now belong to the collection of the Paleontology Museum of Beipiao, in Liaoning, China. They are referred to by the inventory numbers LPM 0200, the holotype; LPM 0201, its counterslab (slab and counterslab together represent the earlier BPM 1 3-13); and the paratype LPM 0159, a smaller skeleton. Both individuals are preserved as articulated compression fossils; they are reasonably complete but partially damaged.

Czerkas &quot;et al.&quot; (2002) diagnosed the genus on the basis of having primary feathers (which in the authors&#x27; opinion made it a bird), a co-ossified sternum, a tail consisting of 28 to 30 vertebrae and a third finger with a short phalanx III-3. Some of the feathers Czerkas described as primary were actually attached to the leg, rather than the arm. This, along with most of the other diagnostic characters, is also present in the genus &quot;Microraptor&quot;, which was first described earlier than &quot;Cryptovolans&quot;. However, BPM 1 3-13 has a longer tail, proportionately, than other &quot;Microraptor&quot; specimens that had been described by 2002, which have 24 to 26 tail vertebrae.

Subsequent studies (and more specimens of &quot;Microraptor&quot;) have shown that the features used to distinguish &quot;Cryptovolans&quot; are not unique, but are present to varying degrees across various specimens. In a review by Phil Senter and colleagues in 2004, the scientists suggested that all these features represented individual variation across various age groups of a single &quot;Microraptor&quot; species, making the name &quot;Cryptovolans pauli&quot; and &quot;Microraptor gui&quot; junior synonyms of &quot;Microraptor zhaoianus&quot;. Many other researchers, including Alan Feduccia and Tom Holtz, have since supported its synonymy. &quot;M. gui&quot; has been accepted as a distinct species with the specimen reported in 2013 being distinguishable from the type specimen of &quot;M. zhaoianus&quot;.

A new specimen of &quot;Microraptor&quot;, BMNHC PH881, showed several features previously unknown in the animal, including the probably glossy-black iridescent plumage coloration. The new specimen also featured a bifurcated tailfan, similar in shape to previously known &quot;Microraptor&quot; tailfans except sporting a pair of long, narrow feathers at the center of the fan. The new specimen also showed no sign of the nuchal crest, indicating that the crest inferred from the holotype specimen may be an artifact of taphonomic distortion.

Numerous further specimens likely belonging to &quot;Microraptor&quot; have been uncovered, all from the Shangheshou Bed of the Jiufotang Formation in Liaoning, China. In fact, &quot;Microraptor&quot; is the most abundant non-avialan dinosaur fossil type found in this formation. In 2010, it was reported that there were over 300 undescribed specimens attributable to &quot;Microraptor&quot; or its close relatives among the collections of several Chinese museums, though many had been altered or composited by private fossil collectors.

===Study and debate===

Norell &quot;et al.&quot; (2002) described BPM 1 3-13 as the first dinosaur known to have flight feathers on its legs as well as on its arms.

Czerkas (2002) mistakenly described the fossil as having no long feathers on its legs, but only on its hands and arms, as he illustrated on the cover of his book &quot;Feathered Dinosaurs and the Origin of Flight&quot;. In his discussion of &quot;Cryptovolans&quot; in this book, Czerkas strongly denounces Norell&#x27;s conclusions; &quot;The misinterpretation of the primary wing feathers as being from the hind legs stems directly to [&quot;sic&quot;] seeing what one believes and wants to see&quot;. Czerkas also denounced Norell for failing to conclude that dromaeosaurs are birds, accusing him of succumbing to &quot;...the blinding influences of preconceived ideas.&quot; The crown group definition of Aves, as a subset of Avialae, the explicit definition of the term &quot;bird&quot; that Norell employs, would definitely exclude BPM 1 3-13. However, he does not consider the specimen to belong to Avialae either.

Czerkas&#x27;s interpretation of the hindleg feathers noted by Norell proved to be incorrect the following year when additional specimens of &quot;Microraptor&quot; were published by Xu and colleagues, showing a distinctive &quot;hindwing&quot; completely separate from the forelimb wing. The first of these specimens was discovered in 2001, and between 2001 and 2003 four more specimens were bought from private collectors by Xu&#x27;s museum, the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology. Xu also considered these specimens, most of which had hindwings and proportional differences from the original &quot;Microraptor&quot; specimen, to be a new species, which he named &quot;Microraptor gui&quot;. However, Senter also questioned this classification, noting that as with &quot;Cryptovolans&quot;, most of the differences appeared to correspond with size, and likely age differences. Two further specimens, classified as &quot;M. zhaoianus&quot; in 2002 (&quot;M. gui&quot; had not yet been named), have also been described by Hwang and colleagues.

Czerkas also believed that the animal may have been able to fly better than &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, the animal usually referred to as the earliest known bird. He cited the fused sternum and asymmetrical feathers, and argued that &quot;Microraptor&quot; has modern bird features that make it more derived than &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;. Czerkas cited the fact that this possibly volant animal is also very clearly a dromaeosaurid to suggest that the Dromaeosauridae might actually be a basal bird group, and that later, larger, species such as &quot;Deinonychus&quot; were secondarily flightless (Czerkas, 2002). The current consensus is that there is not enough evidence to conclude whether dromaeosaurs descended from an ancestor with some aerodynamic abilities. The work of Xu &quot;et al.&quot; (2003) suggested that basal dromaeosaurs were probably small, arboreal, and could glide. The work of Turner &quot;et al.&quot; (2007) suggested that the ancestral dromaeosaur could not glide or fly, but that there was good evidence that it was small-bodied (around 65 cm long and 600–700 g in mass).

==Description==

&quot;Microraptor&quot; was among the smallest-known non-avian dinosaurs, with the holotype of &quot;M. gui&quot; measuring in length, in wingspan and weighing . There are larger specimens which would have measured at least in length, more than in wingspan and weighed . Aside from their extremely small size, &quot;Microraptor&quot; were among the first non-avialan dinosaurs discovered with the impressions of feathers and wings. Seven specimens of &quot;M. zhaoianus&quot; have been described in detail, from which most feather impressions are known. Unusual even among early birds and feathered dinosaurs, &quot;Microraptor&quot; is one of the few known bird precursors to sport long flight feathers on the legs as well as the wings. Their bodies had a thick covering of feathers, with a diamond-shaped fan on the end of the tail (possibly for added stability during flight). Xu &quot;et al.&quot; (2003) compared the longer plumes on &quot;Microraptor&quot;″s head to those of the Philippine eagle. Bands of dark and light present on some specimens may indicate color patterns present in life, though at least some individuals almost certainly possessed an iridescent black coloration.

===Distinguishing anatomical features===
A diagnosis is a statement of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism. Several anatomical features found in &quot;Microraptor&quot;, such as a combination of unserrated and partially serrated teeth with constricted &#x27;waists&#x27;, and unusually long upper arm bones, are shared with both primitive avians and primitive troodontids. &quot;Microraptor&quot; is particularly similar to the basal troodontid &quot;Sinovenator&quot;; in their 2002 description of two &quot;M. zhaoianus&quot; specimens, Hwang &quot;et al.&quot; note that this is not particularly surprising, given that both &quot;Microraptor&quot; and &quot;Sinovenator&quot; are very primitive members of two closely related groups, and both are close to the deinonychosaurian split between dromaeosaurids and troodontids.

===Coloration===

In March 2012, Quanguo Li &quot;et al.&quot; determined the plumage coloration of &quot;Microraptor&quot; based on the new specimen BMNHC PH881, which also showed several other features previously unknown in &quot;Microraptor&quot;. By analyzing the fossilized melanosomes (pigment cells) in the fossil with scanning electron microscope techniques, the researchers compared their arrangements to those of modern birds. In &quot;Microraptor&quot;, these cells were shaped in a manner consistent with black, glossy coloration in modern birds. These rod-shaped, narrow melanosomes were arranged in stacked layers, much like those of a modern starling, and indicated iridescence in the plumage of &quot;Microraptor&quot;. Though the researchers state that the true function of the iridescence is yet unknown, it has been suggested that the tiny dromaeosaur was using its glossy coat as a form of communication or sexual display, much as in modern iridescent birds.

==Classification==
The cladogram below follows a 2012 analysis by paleontologists Phil Senter, James I. Kirkland, Donald D. DeBlieux, Scott Madsen and Natalie Toth.

In a 2024 paper which reported the smallest known juvenile specimen of &quot;Microraptor&quot;, Wang and Pei included microraptorians and eudromaeosaurians within a new clade Serraraptoria.

==Paleobiology==
===Wings and flight===
&quot;Microraptor&quot; had four wings, one on each of its forelimbs and hindlimbs, somewhat resembling one possible arrangement of the quartet of flight surfaces on a tandem wing aircraft of today. It had long pennaceous feathers on arms and hands with legs and feet . The long feathers on the legs of &quot;Microraptor&quot; were true flight feathers as seen in modern birds, with asymmetrical vanes on the arm, leg, and tail feathers. As in modern bird wings, &quot;Microraptor&quot; had both primary (anchored to the hand) and secondary (anchored to the arm) flight feathers. This standard wing pattern was mirrored on the hindlegs, with flight feathers anchored to the upper foot bones as well as the upper and lower leg. Though not apparent in most fossils under natural light, due to obstruction from decayed soft tissue, the feather bases extended close to or in contact with the bones, as in modern birds, providing strong anchor points.

It was originally thought that &quot;Microraptor&quot; was a glider, and probably lived mainly in trees, because the hindwings anchored to the feet of &quot;Microraptor&quot; would have hindered their ability to run on the ground. Some paleontologists have suggested that feathered dinosaurs used their wings to parachute from trees, possibly to attack or ambush prey on the ground, as a precursor to gliding or true flight. In their 2007 study, Chatterjee and Templin tested this hypothesis as well, and found that the combined wing surface of &quot;Microraptor&quot; was too narrow to successfully parachute to the ground without injury from any significant height. However, the authors did leave open the possibility that &quot;Microraptor&quot; could have parachuted short distances, as between closely spaced tree branches. Wind tunnel experiments have demonstrated that sustaining a high-lift coefficient at the expense of high drag was likely the most efficient strategy for &quot;Microraptor&quot; when gliding between low elevations. &quot;Microraptor&quot; did not require a sophisticated, &#x27;modern&#x27; wing morphology to be an effective glider. However, the idea that &quot;Microraptor&quot; was an arboreal glider relies on it to have regularly climbed or even lived in trees, when study of its anatomy have shown that its limb proportions fall in line with modern ground birds rather than climbers, and its skeleton shows none of the expected adaptations in animals specialized for climbing trees.
Describing specimens originally referenced as a distinctive species (&quot;Cryptovolans pauli&quot;), paleontologist Stephen Czerkas argued &quot;Microraptor&quot; may have been a powered flier, and indeed possibly a better flyer than &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;. He noted that the &quot;Microraptor&#x27;s&quot; fused sternum, asymmetrical feathers, and features of the shoulder girdle indicated that it could fly under its own power, rather than merely gliding. Today, most scientists agree that &quot;Microraptor&quot; had the anatomical features expected of a flying animal, though it would have been a less advanced form of flight compared to birds. For example, some studies suggest the shoulder joint was too primitive to allow a full flapping flight stroke. In the ancestral anatomy of theropod dinosaurs, the shoulder socket faced downward and slightly backward, making it impossible for the animals to raise their arms vertically, a prerequisite for the flapping flight stroke in birds. Studies of maniraptoran anatomy have suggested that the shoulder socket did not shift into the bird-like position of a high, upward orientation close to the vertebral column until relatively advanced avialans like the enantiornithes appeared. However, other scientists have argued that the shoulder girdle in some paravian theropods, including &quot;Microraptor&quot;, is curved in such a way that the shoulder joint could only have been positioned high on the back, allowing for a nearly vertical upstroke of the wing. This possibly advanced shoulder anatomy, combined with the presence of a propatagium linking the wrist to the shoulder (which fills the space in front of the flexed wing and may support the wing against drag in modern birds) and an alula, much like a &quot;thumb-like&quot; form of leading edge slot, may indicate that &quot;Microraptor&quot; was capable of true, powered flight.

Other studies have demonstrated that the wings of &quot;Microraptor&quot; were large enough to generate the lift necessary for powered launching into flight even without a fully vertical flight stroke. A 2016 study of incipient flight ability in paravians demonstrated that &quot;Microraptor&quot; was capable of wing-assisted incline running, as well as wing-assisted leaping and even ground-based launching.

Stephen Czerkas, Gregory S. Paul, and others have argued that the fact &quot;Microraptor&quot; could fly and yet is also very clearly a dromaeosaurid suggests that the Dromaeosauridae, including later and larger species such as &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, were secondarily flightless. The work of Xu and colleagues also suggested that the ancestors of dromaeosaurids were probably small, arboreal, and capable of gliding, although later discoveries of more primitive dromaeosaurids with short forelimbs unsuitable for gliding have cast doubt on this view. Work done on the question of flight ability in other paravians, however, showed that most of them probably would not have been able to achieve enough lift for powered flight, given their limited flight strokes and relatively smaller wings. These studies concluded that &quot;Microraptor&quot; probably evolved flight and its associated features (fused sternum, alula, etc.) independently of the ancestors of birds. In 2024, Kiat and O&#x27;Connor analyzed that Mesozoic birds and &quot;Microraptor&quot; had remex morphologies that are consistent with modern volant birds, while anchiornithids and &quot;Caudipteryx&quot; were secondarily flightless.

===Hindwing posture===

Sankar Chatterjee suggested in 2005 that, in order for &quot;Microraptor&quot; to glide or fly, the forewings and hindwings must have been on different levels (as on a biplane) and not overlaid (as on a dragonfly), and that the latter posture would have been anatomically impossible. Using this biplane model, Chatterjee was able to calculate possible methods of gliding and determined that &quot;Microraptor&quot; most likely employed a &quot;phugoid&quot; style of gliding: launching itself from a perch, the animal would have swooped downward in a deep U-shaped curve and then lifted again to land on another tree. The feathers not directly employed in the biplane wing structure, like those on the tibia and the tail, could have been used to control drag and alter the flight path, trajectory, etc. The orientation of the hindwings would also have helped the animal control its gliding flight. Chatterjee also used computer algorithms that test animal flight capacity to test whether or not &quot;Microraptor&quot; was capable of true, powered flight, as opposed to or in addition to passive gliding. The resulting data showed that &quot;Microraptor&quot; did have the requirements to sustain level powered flight, so it is theoretically possible that the animal flew, as opposed to gliding.

Some paleontologists have doubted the biplane hypothesis, and have proposed other configurations. A 2010 study by Alexander &quot;et al.&quot; described the construction of a lightweight three-dimensional physical model used to perform glide tests. Using several hindleg configurations for the model, they found that the biplane model, while not unreasonable, was structurally deficient and needed a heavy-headed weight distribution for stable gliding, which they deemed unlikely. The study indicated that a laterally abducted hindwing structure represented the most biologically and aerodynamically consistent configuration for &quot;Microraptor&quot;. A further analysis by Brougham and Brusatte, however, concluded that Alexander&#x27;s model reconstruction was not consistent with all of the available data on &quot;Microraptor&quot; and argued that the study was insufficient for determining a likely flight pattern for &quot;Microraptor&quot;. Brougham and Brusatte criticized the anatomy of the model used by Alexander and his team, noting that the hip anatomy was not consistent with other dromaeosaurs. In most dromaeosaurids, features of the hip bone prevent the legs from splaying horizontally; instead, they are locked in a vertical position below the body. Alexander&#x27;s team used a specimen of &quot;Microraptor&quot; which was crushed flat to make their model, which Brougham and Brusatte argued did not reflect its actual anatomy. Later in 2010, Alexander&#x27;s team responded to these criticisms, noting that the related dromaeosaur &quot;Hesperonychus&quot;, which is known from complete hip bones preserved in three dimensions, also shows hip sockets directed partially upward, possibly allowing the legs to splay more than in other dromaeosaurs. However, Hartman and colleagues suggested that &quot;Hesperonychus&quot; is not a dromaeosaur, but actually an avialan close to modern birds like &quot;Balaur bondoc&quot; based on phylogenetic analyses in 2019.

===Ground movement===

Due to the extent of the hindwings onto most of the animal&#x27;s foot, many scientists have suggested that &quot;Microraptor&quot; would have been awkward during normal ground movement or running. The front wing feathers would also have hindered &quot;Microraptor&quot; when on the ground, due to the limited range of motion in the wrist and the extreme length of the wing feathers. A 2010 study by Corwin Sullivan and colleagues showed that, even with the wing folded as far as possible, the feathers would still have dragged along the ground if the arms were held in a neutral position, or extended forward as in a predatory strike. Only by keeping the wings elevated, or the upper arm extended fully backward, could &quot;Microraptor&quot; have avoided damaging the wing feathers. Therefore, it may have been anatomically impossible for &quot;Microraptor&quot; to have used its clawed forelimbs in capturing prey or manipulating objects.

===Implications===

The unique wing arrangement found in &quot;Microraptor&quot; raised the question of whether the evolution of flight in modern birds went through a four-winged stage, or whether four-winged gliders like &quot;Microraptor&quot; were an evolutionary side-branch that left no descendants. As early as 1915, naturalist William Beebe had argued that the evolution of bird flight may have gone through a four-winged (or &quot;tetrapteryx&quot;) stage. Chatterjee and Templin did not take a strong stance on this possibility, noting that both a conventional interpretation and a tetrapteryx stage are equally possible. However, based on the presence of unusually long leg feathers in various feathered dinosaurs, &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, and some modern birds such as raptors, as well as the discovery of further dinosaurs with long primary feathers on their feet (such as &quot;Pedopenna&quot;), the authors argued that the current body of evidence, both from morphology and phylogeny, suggests that bird flight did shift at some point from shared limb dominance to front-limb dominance and that all modern birds may have evolved from four-winged ancestors, or at least ancestors with unusually long leg feathers relative to the modern configuration.

===Feeding===

In 2010 researchers announced that further preparation of the type fossil of &quot;M. zhaoianus&quot; revealed preserved probable gut contents, and a full study on them was later published in 2022 by David Hone and colleagues. These consisted of the remains of a mammal, primarily a complete and articulated right foot (including all tarsals, metatarsals, and most of the phalanges) as well as the shafts of additional long bones and potentially other fragments. The foot skeleton is similar to those of &quot;Eomaia&quot; and &quot;Sinodelphys&quot;. It corresponds to an animal with an estimated snout to vent length of and a mass of . The unguals of the foot are less curved than in &quot;Eomaia&quot; or &quot;Sinodelphys&quot;, indicating that the mammal could climb but less effectively than in the two latter genera and so was likely not arboreal but potentially scansorial.

It is ambiguous whether the mammal had been predated upon or scavenged by the &quot;Microraptor&quot;, although the lack of other definitive body parts consumed may suggest the low-muscle mass foot may have been eaten during a late stage of carcass consumption, possibly through scavenging. The find is a rare example of a theropod definitively consuming a Mesozoic mammal. The only other two examples are the indeterminate tyrannosauroid specimen GMV 2124 (also known as NGMC 2124) and the holotype of &quot;Huadanosaurus&quot;, both of which are previously attributed to &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot;.

In the December 6, 2011 issue of &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot;, Jingmai O&#x27;Connor and coauthors described a specimen of &quot;Microraptor gui&quot; containing bones of an arboreal enantiornithean bird in its abdomen, specifically a partial wing and feet. Their position implies the bird was swallowed whole and head-first, which the authors interpreted as implying that the &quot;Microraptor&quot; had caught and consumed the bird in the trees, rather than scavenging it.

In 2013 researchers announced that they had found fish scales in the abdominal cavity of another &quot;M. gui&quot; specimen. The authors contradicted the prior suggestion that &quot;M. gui&quot; hunted only in an arboreal environment, proposing that it was also an adept hunter of fish as well. They further argued that the specimen showed a probable adaptation to a fish-eating diet, pointing to the first three teeth of the mandible being inclined anterodorsally, a characteristic often associated with piscivory. They concluded that &quot;Microraptor&quot; was an opportunistic feeder, hunting the most common prey in both arboreal and aquatic habitats.

Both of these studies regarded each gut contents as instances of predation. However, Hone and colleagues (2022) questioned the reliability of these interpretations and wrote that both could just as equally be attributed to scavenging. Further, they argued against &quot;Microraptor&quot; being a specialist in either or both arboreal or aquatic hunting, citing the broad range of vertebrate gut contents (i.e. fish, mammals, lizards, birds) as evidence for a generalist hunting strategy, and that neither required that &quot;Microraptor&quot; being a specialist for hunting in either habitats.

In 2019, a new genus of scleroglossan lizard (&quot;Indrasaurus&quot;) was described from a specimen found in the stomach of a &quot;Microraptor&quot;. The &quot;Microraptor&quot; apparently swallowed its prey head first, a behavior typical of modern carnivorous birds and lizards. The &quot;Indrasaurus&quot; bones lacked marked pitting and scarring, indicating that the &quot;Microraptor&quot; died shortly after eating the lizard and before significant digestion had occurred.

Unlike its fellow paravian &quot;Anchiornis&quot;, &quot;Microraptor&quot; has never been found with gastric pellets, despite the existence of four &quot;Microraptor&quot; specimens that preserve stomach contents. This suggests that &quot;Microraptor&quot; passed indigestible fur, feathers, and bits of bone in its droppings instead of producing pellets.

Based on the size of the scleral ring of the eye, it has been suggested &quot;Microraptor&quot; hunted at night. The discovery of iridescent plumage in &quot;Microraptor&quot; has led many to question this assumption on the grounds that no modern birds that have iridescent plumage are known to be nocturnal, but this argument is itself questionable as there in fact are modern nocturnal birds with iridescent plumage, such as the kākāpō as well as various night-feeding waterfowl; furthermore, as a forest-dwelling, presumably solitary carnivore, &quot;Microraptor&quot; was significantly different ecologically compared to extant corvids and icterids with dark, iridescent plumage, which are social omnivores of more open habitats.

<doc id="1025706" wikidata="Q4794929" url="?curid=1025706" title="Arnold (comic strip)">
<text>Arnold was a syndicated comic strip by Kevin McCormick that ran at its height in 56 newspapers, including the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and the &quot;Detroit Free Press,&quot; from December 13, 1982, through April 17, 1988. The strip was characterized by an off-beat sense of humor and random interjections by the title character, Arnold.

==Motifs==
The main characters were Arnold Melville, a strange, volatile child; Tommy Jordon, his well-meaning but clueless friend; and Mr. Lester, Arnold and Tommy&#x27;s schoolteacher. These three were usually the only characters actually seen in the strip, with off-stage voices coming from the other characters (such as parents, bullies, teachers, coaches and other authority figures).

Arnold often yelled &quot;AIEEE!&quot; at random moments, and both characters had run-ins with the school cafeteria ladies—specifically Arnold, who referred to mayonnaise as &quot;WHITE DEATH!&quot; at the top of his lungs. Arnold also ran a newspaper called &quot;The Vicious Rumor&quot; (which often made fun of Tommy and Mr. Lester), as well as turning the school&#x27;s safety patrol in his own, private para-military unit. 

Tommy had a particular aversion to &quot;wet bread&quot; and occasionally brought a thinly-veiled Christian attitude to his reactions to the other characters (cartoonist McCormick became a born-again Christian after ending the strip and is now a youth pastor). He would also be abused by various school sports coaches, especially his football coach; Tommy would sometimes be seen wearing his helmet backwards, as the coach did not think much of Tommy&#x27;s suggestions.

Toward the end of the run, a baby brother to Arnold, named Sid, was born. Sid frequently grabbed hold of others by holding on with his mouth.

== Legacy ==
McCormick decided to end &quot;Arnold&quot; in 1988, in a suitably bizarre fashion. In the last regular strip, which ran on Saturday, April 16, 1988 (an unrelated Sunday strip was seen the next day), Tommy calls Arnold&#x27;s parents and asks to speak to him. However, Tommy is told that a giant bird had grabbed Arnold and flew off with him. (When Tommy asks, &quot;What I am supposed to do now?&quot;, his apparently unconcerned mother merely says, &quot;Goodbye, Tommy,&quot; and hangs up on him.) 

The following month, the cartoonist wrote to the fans of the strip in the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;: &quot;I was extremely gratified and happy to receive all the letters from Free Press readers concerning the demise of Arnold. I even had second thoughts. But, alas, it was too late. The gigantic bird had already swallowed. Thank you for your loyalty to the strip.&quot;

== Parodies ==
Arnold was featured in &quot;Mad&quot; #253 entry &quot;The Trend Toward Rottenness in the Comic Strips&quot;, illustrated by Bob Clarke.

<doc id="1025710" wikidata="Q7641964" url="?curid=1025710" title="Super/System">
<text>Super/System, one of the first books about poker strategy, was written and published in 1979 by Doyle Brunson, a professional poker player and multiple winner at the World Series of Poker.

==History and title==

How I Made Over $1,000,000 Playing Poker was primarily written by Doyle Brunson who, at the time of publication in 1979, had won the main event of the World Series of Poker in 1976 and 1977. The book was one of the first comprehensive books on strategies for various poker games. Many notable poker players and tournament champions contributed sections to the book.

The title of the book was originally How I Made Over $1,000,000 Playing Poker. The title is also sometimes written as Super System, without a slash; Doyle Brunson&#x27;s Super System; or Super/System: A Course in Power Poker.

==Contents==
The book begins with a biographical sketch of Doyle Brunson and then quickly discusses general poker strategy. The general strategy includes controlling emotion, watching competitors play, reasoning outplay, and other similar tips that benefit all forms of poker play.

The sections of the book dedicated to strategy were divided as follows:
*Draw poker written by Mike Caro. Among other things, Caro writes in detail about tells, how to gain information about an opponent&#x27;s hand based on how they act. He is regarded as an expert on poker psychology and behavior and would later go on to write his own seminal book on tells.
*Seven-card stud written by Chip Reese
*Lowball written by Joey Hawthorne and Doyle Brunson
*Seven-card stud high-low split (with no qualifier for low) by David Sklansky
*Limit Texas hold &#x27;em by Bobby Baldwin
*No-limit Texas hold &#x27;em by Doyle Brunson

Finally, there is a comprehensive list of probability and statistics calculated by Mike Caro. In addition to raw numbers, many scenarios are investigated and common questions are answered.

==Influence==
Many of today&#x27;s top poker players, young and old, swear by &quot;Super/System&quot;. Although many years have passed since the original publication, it still contains relevant strategies and statistics. Brunson himself believes that because the book has been so influential, it probably cost him more money than he was paid for writing it.

Many of the poker variants are played differently today, and there are many new variants that are not covered in &quot;Super/System&quot;, so the book has been superseded in some areas.

==Super System 2==
A sequel titled &quot;Super System 2&quot; was published in October 2004 ().

The second book is broken up into several sections, each covering a different variant of poker, and written by experts on those games. Contributors include: Daniel Negreanu; Lyle Berman, founder of the World Poker Tour; Bobby Baldwin; Johnny Chan; Mike Caro; Jennifer Harman; Todd Brunson; Steve Zolotow; and Crandell Addington.

<text>Northern Virginia Community College (NVCC and, informally, NOVA) is a public community college with six campuses and four centers in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. It is the third-largest multi-campus community college in the United States and the second largest educational institution in the Commonwealth of Virginia after Liberty University.

The college is part of the Virginia Community College System. Anne M. Kress has been its president since January 13, 2020. NOVA has campuses in Alexandria, Annandale, Loudoun County, Manassas, Springfield and Woodbridge.

==History==
The college was established on February 8, 1965, under the name Northern Virginia Technical College. In the fall of 1965, the college opened with 761 students in a single building in Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads under president Robert L. McKee. To accommodate an ever-growing student body, the college purchased in Annandale in 1966 to create the first of six permanent campus sites. NOVA has also offered distance learning courses since 1975.

==Academics==
The college includes nearly 75,000 students and more than 2,500 faculty and staff members. NOVA is also one of the most internationally diverse colleges in the United States, with a student body consisting of individuals from more than 180 countries. NOVA is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and offers more than 160 degrees at the associate level and certificate programs. NOVA also offers distance learning programs through their Extended Learning Institute (ELI) and continuing education courses through Workforce Development. The college encourages students to enroll in four-year colleges after completing their NOVA education. Its feeder program guarantees admission to partnered intrastate schools.

NOVA offers dual-enrollment so high-school students can enroll in classes at the age of 16.

==Campuses==
The college is served by a library system extending across all six campuses and the Arlington Center. NOVA Libraries contain more than 250,000 volumes and subscribe to more than 200 databases, many of these purchased through the Virtual Library of Virginia, meaning that NOVA has access to many of the same resources as the other colleges and universities in Virginia.

=== Alexandria ===

The Alexandria Campus is located in Alexandria and primarily serves the residents of the City of Alexandria, Arlington County, Falls Church, and eastern Fairfax County. The campus grew from one building constructed on a 22.5-acre site in 1971 to three buildings on 51.4 acres in 1980. Additions to the original Bisdorf Building and the Engineering/Automotive Technology Building was opened in 1980. In that year, the John Tyler School was also purchased from the City of Alexandria and incorporated as part of the campus. The Alexandria Campus also maintains classrooms in leased facilities at off-campus locations. The Rachel M. Schlesinger Concert Hall and Arts Center was completed in 2001. In Spring 2006, under the auspices of the Alexandria Campus, the Arlington Center opened for classes.

=== Annandale ===
The Annandale Campus is located in central Fairfax County and primarily serves the residents of the county. The campus began as one building constructed in 1967 on a 78-acre site. In 1969, three additional buildings were erected and the TV/Technical Building followed in 1970. The Nursing Building was completed in 1972. The Brault Building, which houses college staff, was completed in 1984, and recent renovations were complete in 2015. The Richard J. Ernst Community Cultural Center, which serves the college and the community, was completed in 1990. The MacDiarmid Building was completed in 1997. In Spring 2006, work was completed on a six-level, 825-space parking garage for faculty, staff, students, and visitors. The Student Services Building opened in Fall 2011, and was renamed the Mark Warner Student Services Building after Virginia Senator Mark Warner in 2016. The Annandale Campus also provides off-campus instruction at various locations.

=== Loudoun ===

The Loudoun Campus is located in Sterling and primarily serves the residents of northern Fairfax County and Loudoun County. Construction began on a 91.4-acre site in 1972 and was completed in 1974 with four permanent buildings, the temporary Interior Design Building, and greenhouse/laboratories. Under the auspices of the Loudoun Campus, the Reston Center opened for classes in spring 2006 and the Signal Hill Center opened for classes in Fall 2009. In Fall 2012, the Learning Commons building opened at the Loudoun Campus. The Higher Education Center opened in 2015, and was renamed the Robert G. Templin Higher Education Center in 2016. The Loudoun Campus also maintains classrooms in leased off-campus facilities.

===Manassas===
The Manassas Campus is located in western Prince William County on a 100-acre site next to the Manassas National Battlefield. The campus primarily serves the residents of western Prince William and Fairfax counties and the cities of Manassas and Manassas Park. In 1999, the Mary Louise Jackson Amphitheater was opened. In 2008, under the auspices of the Manassas Campus, the Innovation Park location opened for classes. In Spring 2012, the Harry J. Parrish Hall opened at the Manassas Campus.

=== Medical Education (MEC) ===

The Medical Education Campus (MEC) opened in the Fall of 2003 in Springfield. The MEC is a collaborative effort between NOVA, George Mason University, Virginia Commonwealth University, and regional public school systems. The MEC offers many different health-related programs and features state-of-the-art classrooms and laboratories, dental clinics, and a clinical practice site for nursing and allied health students. The MEC offers a special nursing program called Momentum 2+1 that specifically prepares graduates to transfer to the Bachelor of Science degree in nursing at George Mason University. The MEC is also a member of the NoVa HealthFORCE, an initiative of The Northern Virginia Health Care Workforce Alliance (NVHCW A), addressing issues in the Health Care profession.

=== Woodbridge ===
The Woodbridge Campus is located in eastern Prince William County and primarily serves the residents of the county. Classes were offered in temporary community facilities from 1972 through 1975. Campus construction began in 1974 on a 109-acre site. A four-story building was completed in 1975; Phase II of this building was completed in 1990. The campus has also added the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning buildings and several temporary facilities. In Fall 2013, the Woodbridge Campus opened the Arts and Science Building, and in 2015, unveiled the Regional Center for Workforce Education and Training. The Woodbridge Campus provides off-campus instruction at several locations, including area high schools and the Quantico and Fort Belvoir military bases.

==Athletics==
NOVA started intercollegiate athletics in 2001 as a member of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA). The college sponsors women&#x27;s volleyball, men&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s cross country, men&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s basketball, football, men&#x27;s lacrosse, and women&#x27;s softball at the intercollegiate varsity level. In addition, NOVA has a club ice hockey team that is a member of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA). NOVA added a varsity esports team in the Fall 2018 as a member of the National Association of Collegiate Esports (NACE).

The college introduced Ace, the Nighthawk, in 2017 as the first mascot of the modern era of NOVA Athletics.

<doc id="1025718" wikidata="Q1388486" url="?curid=1025718" title="Pierre Chambon">
<text>Pierre Chambon (; born 7 February 1931 in Mulhouse, France) was the founder of the in Strasbourg, France. He was one of the leading molecular biologists who utilized gene cloning and sequencing technology to first decipher the structure of eukaryotic genes and their modes of regulation. His major contributions to science include the identification of RNA polymerase II (B), the identification of transcriptional control elements, the cloning and dissection of nuclear hormone receptors, revealing their structure and showing how they contribute to human physiology. His group was also one of the first to demonstrate, biochemically and electron-microscopically, that the nucleosome is the smallest unit of chromatin (Cell, Vol. 4, 281–300, 1975). He accomplished much of his work in the 1970s – 1990s.

The core of Pierre Chambon&#x27;s scientific work has been dedicated to the genetics and molecular biology of vertebrates.  

1. Discovery of a new polynucleotide, polyADP-ribose (1963)  

2. Discovery of the multiplicity of RNA polymerases in eukaryotes (1969)  

3. Contribution to the elucidation of the structure of active and inactive chromatin (the nucleosome) (1975)  

4. Discovery that histones are responsible for the supercoiling of DNA in chromatin (1975)  

5. Discovery of split genes in animal genomes (1977)  

6. Characterization of promoter elements of eukaryotic protein-coding genes and discovery of the &quot;enhancer&quot; element (1980-1987)  

7. Cloning of estrogen and progesterone receptors; elucidation of the mechanism of action of steroid hormones at the level of gene expression (1985-1990)  

8. Discovery of nuclear receptors for retinoids (1987-)  

9. Discovery of the nuclear receptor superfamily, their three-dimensional structure, molecular mechanism of action, and their physiological and pathophysiological functions at the cellular and organismal levels (1987-)  

10. Discovery of a method allowing somatic mutations to be induced in mice at a chosen time and in a specific tissue or cell type.  

Chambon was elected a Foreign Associate of the US National Academy of Sciences and to the French Académie des Sciences in 1985, a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1987. He was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize. from Columbia University in 1999 and a second time in 2018. In 2003 he was awarded the March of Dimes Prize in Developmental Biology. He received the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 2004 for his work in the field. In 2010, Chambon was awarded the Gairdner Foundation International Award &quot;for the elucidation of fundamental mechanisms of transcription in animal cells and to the discovery of the nuclear receptor superfamily&quot;.

<text>The Secret World of Alex Mack is an American science fiction television series that aired on Nickelodeon from October 8, 1994, to January 15, 1998. The series was co-created by Ken Lipman and Thomas W. Lynch and was produced by Lynch Entertainment, Hallmark Entertainment and Nickelodeon Productions. &quot;The Secret World of Alex Mack&quot; was accompanied by a tie-in series of 34 paperback books, as well as a variety of merchandise.

==Plot==

Alexandra &quot;Alex&quot; Mack is an ordinary teenage girl living with her parents, George and Barbara, and her precocious older sister, Annie, in the industrial town of Paradise Valley, Arizona. The town is largely founded around Paradise Valley Chemical, a chemical factory that employs most of the adult residents, although the factory&#x27;s staff and history are notoriously shady.

While walking home after her first day of junior high school, Alex is nearly hit by a truck from Paradise Valley Chemical, and during the incident, she is accidentally drenched with GC-161, an experimental substance developed by the factory. She soon discovers that it has given her various powers, including telekinesis, the ability to shoot electricity from her fingertips, and the ability to dissolve into a mobile puddle of liquid. Alex finds this exciting and fun; however, her powers prove to be unpredictable (occasionally, her skin glows a bright yellow when she is nervous). She confides only in Annie and her best friend Ray, choosing to keep her powers a secret from everyone else, including her parents, for fear of what the chemical factory&#x27;s CEO, Danielle Atron, will do to her if she finds out.

=== Series overview ===
The series evolves from seasons 1–4 from innocent hijinks to darker connotations; seasons 1–2 mostly deal with cheerful misadventures and comedic encounters with incompetent Paradise Valley Chemical staff Vince and Dave. Seasons 3–4 take on a more serious and dark development, in which it is revealed that Danielle Atron had been developing GC-161 as far back as the 1970s, and that she may have had fellow scientists and researchers systematically assassinated to cover up GC-161&#x27;s mutagenic effects on people.

Subplots of the series included Barbara Mack going back to college as a mature student; Alex and her friends being targeted by a school bully; Alex&#x27;s crush, Scott, turning out to be a ; and Louis Driscoll befriending Alex and Ray after moving to Paradise Valley as a new student. Vince, meanwhile, is fired in season 3 and replaced by an asocial Vienna-born scientist named Lars Frederickson. Vince makes frequent reappearances as a guest character, obsessed with trying to get his job back. While Alex was initially bullied by an older student named Jessica in season 1, Jessica&#x27;s actress, Jessica Alba, left for other projects and the character was replaced with Kelly, a preppy but mean-spirited cheerleader, and later Jo (the aforementioned school bully who goes after Alex and Ray).

In season 4, Alex develops a serious relationship with Hunter, a new boy in town. She initially believes he is infatuated with Danielle Atron after discovering what appears to be a love shrine to the woman in his bedroom, but Hunter is revealed to be investigating Danielle&#x27;s potential involvement in the death of his scientist father by drowning. Alex shares her first kiss with Hunter.

==Characters==

===Main===
* Alexandra &quot;Alex&quot; Mack (played by Larisa Oleynik) – Alex is an average teenage girl in Paradise Valley. While walking home from school, she is nearly hit by a truck carrying GC-161 and is doused with it, thus giving her extraordinary powers. Among them are telekinesis, the ability to generate electricity from her hands and the ability to liquefy and travel from place to place in the form of a puddle of liquid. She briefly manifests superhuman strength as a result of her body having an unusual reaction to a new type of curry recipe her mother had just tried, but this was only valid in one episode as her mother never used the recipe again.
* Raymond &quot;Ray&quot; Alvarado (played by Darris Love) – Alex&#x27;s best friend and next door neighbor, and the only one besides Annie to know about Alex&#x27;s powers.
* Annie Mack (played by Meredith Bishop) – Alex&#x27;s older sister, and a scientific genius in her own right. Next to Ray, she is the only one who originally knows about Alex&#x27;s powers. She administers various scientific tests to ensure Alex&#x27;s safety. She also hopes to one day present her research, in an effort to stop Danielle Atron.
* George Mack (played by Michael Blakley) – Annie and Alex&#x27;s father. He is a brilliant chemist who works for Danielle Atron at the Paradise Valley Chemical Plant.
* Barbara Mack (played by Dorian Lopinto) – Annie and Alex&#x27;s mother. She is a more down-to-earth woman who works in a public relations firm which represents the chemical plant.

===Recurring===
* Louis Driscoll (played by Benjamin Kimball Smith) – Alex and Ray&#x27;s abrasive friend, who moves to Paradise Valley from Cincinnati in season 2. At first Alex is jealous of Louis, but they finally become friends. Alex and her gang generally find Louis annoying, with a grandiose personality, but at times he can be a very caring and well-meaning person, such as when he attempts to rescue a young child trapped beneath a cement pipe, or when he helps Alex make a friendship video for Nathan Dean in their class. Louis&#x27;s father is a businessman and entrepreneur.
*David &quot;Dave&quot; Watt (played by John Nielsen) – The seemingly dim-witted truck driver who was driving the truck that accidentally dumped the GC-161 chemical on Alex. As the only witness to the accident, Dave is often forced to serve as a partner to Vince Carter (see below) in trying to capture Alex. After seeing Alex using her powers while she was in high school, Dave keeps it a secret from Danielle to protect her as he knew what kind of horrible experiments Danielle had planned for her. In season 4, Dave reveals himself to be much more intelligent than Danielle believes, telling her that he just likes living a simple life, and serving as a whistleblower to George Mack about corruption at the plant. Alex hugs him after learning that he kept her secret to protect her, and George, in gratitude, later promises Dave a job at another chemical plant.
* Scott Greene (played by Jason Strickland) – Alex&#x27;s junior high school crush, an older sports jock who dates Kelly later on. Alex eventually discovers Scott&#x27;s vapid nature when he steals her photos that she took while working for the school scrapbook.
* Jessica (played by Jessica Alba) – Scott&#x27;s first girlfriend and Alex&#x27;s first school rival.
* Kelly Phillips (played by Hilary Salvatore) – Scott&#x27;s second girlfriend and Alex&#x27;s second school rival. Kelly deviously discredits Alex at every given turn, much to Alex&#x27;s dismay.
* Robyn Russo (played by Natanya Ross) – One of Alex and Ray&#x27;s neighborhood friends. Though she possesses a sardonic sense of humor and is fun to be around, she suffers from low self-esteem and can be very depressing, sometimes expressing grim opinions of death and nihilism. Robyn often wears black and dresses more goth as the series goes on. She has a hamster named Donald that dies, sending her into an intense grieving period. Robyn eventually discovers Alex&#x27;s powers in the series finale, initially not believing Louis when he tells her.
* Nicole Wilson (played by Alexis Fields) – Another of Alex and Ray&#x27;s friends. An opposite personality to Robyn, has a take-charge attitude and rebellious demeanor. Nicole is often involved in social justice causes, mainly environmentalism and animal rights. In season 3&#x27;s episode &quot;The Neighbor&quot;, Danielle Atron strangely sees her younger self in Nicole&#x27;s idealism and goals of making the world a better place, but admits that becoming the CEO of Paradise Valley Chemical has since made her apathetic. Nicole does not appear in the final episode of the series to discover Alex&#x27;s powers.
* Danielle Atron (played by Louan Gideon) – The CEO of the Paradise Valley Chemical Plant who is the main antagonist of the series. She wants to market GC-161 as a radical new weight-loss drug, and is increasingly focused on finding the GC-161 child (who she never discovers is Alex until the last two episodes) and capture them, as both a test subject and a threat to the secrecy of her plans. In season 2, Danielle&#x27;s childhood is examined, revealing that she was a prodigy who was abused by her mother, causing neighbours to gossip when Danielle stopped appearing in school. She was removed from her home after she was discovered locked in the basement, then raised by her grandparents, whose land she later bought as a location to build Paradise Valley Chemical. In season 4, it&#x27;s revealed in a newspaper clipping in Hunter&#x27;s bedroom that Danielle had rescued several people in a fire at a rival chemical plant, but that the accident caused toxicity and genetic defects affecting Danielle and the other fire victims, after which Danielle established Paradise Valley Chemical as the main factory in town. Danielle&#x27;s grandmother was played by Michael Learned in season 2&#x27;s &quot;The Secret&quot;, a Halloween-themed episode.
* Carlton (played by Jason Marsden) – Carlton is Danielle&#x27;s geeky, manipulative nephew and Annie Mack&#x27;s scientific rival. Carlton attempts to sabotage Annie&#x27;s project at a science fair in season 1. Vince initially believes Carlton to be the GC-161 child, but this turns out to be false. Carlton then loses the science fair to Annie, and is last seen crying next to his failed project.
*Vincent &quot;Vince&quot; Carter (played by John Marzilli) – The head of security at the Paradise Valley Chemical Plant, Vince is a former Navy Seal and uses illegal tactics to protect Danielle&#x27;s interests. Vince often remarks about the Federal Government, &quot;I&#x27;m not one of their favourite guys&quot;, and is mentally unstable, although it is never made entirely clear what occurred in his past that drove him to work for Paradise Valley Chemical. He makes it his obsession to find the GC-161 child (even after he gets fired from the Plant). After being fired, he wears military garb and talks to himself. Despite often being cruel to Dave, he at times does treat Dave as possibly the only real friend he has. While trapped in an air duct in the Mack House at one point, he breaks down sobbing after Barbara says of him, &quot;the man had no friends&quot; (from her time working alongside him). 
* Oscar (animal actor) – a chimpanzee that Dave buys Vince as a Christmas present; Oscar consumes an open jelly glass of GC-161 in season 2, gaining similar powers to Alex&#x27;s. In season 3, he&#x27;s revealed to have been adopted by Dave, living in Dave&#x27;s trailer park.
* Lars Frederickson (played by Kevin Quigley) – A skilled chemist hailing from the Paradise Valley Chemical Plant&#x27;s foreign branch in Vienna. He becomes Danielle Atron&#x27;s chief subordinate after Vince gets fired. Lars has a shy wife named Inez, who attends an awkward dinner at the Mack household. Annie and Lars together uncover a disturbing report from the 1970s revealing that GC-161 is older than either of them initially believed, and that all the scientists on the original research project, aside from Danielle Atron, are missing or deceased. This bothers Lars, who goes to Danielle to question her, but then he decides to help her cover up the report. Lars is named after one of the members of punk rock group Rancid.
* Hunter Reeves (played by Will Estes) – Hunter comes to Paradise Valley with an agenda concerning the disappearance of his father in relation to GC-161. Alex finds a shrine to Danielle in his bedroom after sneaking in, but then discovers that he&#x27;s actually been investigating the plant. Alex eventually kisses him and reveals her powers to him in season 4.
* Jo (played by Jennifer Manley) – Jo is a school bully who torments Alex, Ray and Robyn in several episodes throughout seasons 3–4.
* Bruce Lester (played by Josh Keaton) – Annie&#x27;s longtime boyfriend throughout Season 2. Bryce and Annie go mountain-climbing, and volunteer at an amateur magic show. Eventually they break up but remain friends, leaving Annie devastated, although she does get closer to her sister afterwards.
* Nathan &quot;Creeper&quot; Dean (played by Hank Harris) – Nathan is a shy, neurodivergent boy in Alex&#x27;s film class who embarrasses Alex with a bizarre video project shown to the other students and teacher.
* Gloria (played by LaReine Chabut) – Gloria is Alex&#x27;s boss, a donut shop owner at the local bakery &quot;Wayne&#x27;s Wigwam&quot;. In Season 4, Alex has a falling out with Gloria over the practice of using Styrofoam plates that damage the environment.
* Mr. Alverado (played by J.D. Hall) – Ray&#x27;s dad, who shares Ray&#x27;s passion for music.
* Gino Lawless (played by Frankie Como) – Gino was a security guard at Paradise Valley Chemical. He later becomes a reoccurring government agent investigating the plant. Gino&#x27;s surname was chosen ironically, as he is one of the few Paradise Valley Chemical staff who has any scruples.
* Elias Griffin (played by Francis X. McCarthy) – Griffin was a member of the Food and Drug Administration, who was secretly being bribed by Danielle Atron to hide the side-effects of GC-161 so that it would be approved faster. After failing a lie detector test given by Gino, Griffin is arrested. The character appears throughout season 4.
* Hannah Mercury (played by guest star Charlotte Ayanna) – the most popular girl in Alex&#x27;s school, who Ray has a crush on.
* Chester (played by Jim Wise) – a local policeman, one of Alex&#x27;s acquaintances.
* Jenny (played by Francesca Marie Smith) – Jenny is an insecure younger girl who idolizes Alex, to the point of being extremely annoying and manipulative. She bullies another girl by calling her &quot;bubblebutt&quot;, after which Alex tries to get Jenny to behave better and appreciate the friends she has.
* Gordon &quot;Scooter&quot; Kramer (played by Corey Joshua Taylor) – Scooter is George Mack&#x27;s work colleague, and a supporting character throughout seasons 3-4.
* Coach Rooney (played by Glenn Morshower) – a loud sports coach with military-like behaviour; Coach Rooney appears in all seasons of the series.

==Episodes==

==Production==
Thomas W. Lynch, who had created the programs &quot;Night Tracks&quot; and &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot;, said the idea for the series was based on an incident from his own childhood. Lynch&#x27;s father, a nuclear physicist, worked with radioactive material in the family&#x27;s garage and the chemical spilled out of its container. Lynch said, &quot;Today, they would&#x27;ve shut the whole block down. It cracked me up—the idea that that stuff was right there. What if I ate it? What would happen to me?&quot; For the fictional chemical GC-161 in the show, Lynch said he came up with the GC part of the name while doing DNA research, while the 161 came from the number eight.

Though the character of Alex Mack was initially conceived as a boy, Nickelodeon had the writers change the character to a girl.

The series was filmed in Valencia, Santa Clarita and the Santa Clarita Valley. The Mack home and Paradise Valley Chemical Plant interiors were filmed in a converted warehouse used as a soundstage. The junior high scenes were filmed at Charles Helmers and James Foster Elementary Schools. Castaic Middle School was used for senior high scenes. The house, used for exterior shots, is located in the Westford Place neighborhood of Valencia.

Near the end of the series&#x27; run, Lynch presented star Larisa Oleynik with a package deal that included a fifth season of the show and a feature film, but Oleynik turned the deal down. Said Oleynik, &quot;I have absolutely no regrets about that. It was an incredible thing he was offering me and I knew that at the time, but I was a little burnt out.&quot;

==Television airing==
The show premiered on Nickelodeon (part of SNICK line-up) in 1994 and ended in 1998. Internationally, it also aired on YTV in Canada, Kabel 1 in Germany, SVT in Sweden, France 2 in France, Viasat 3 in Hungary, Rai 1 in Italy, Fox Kids in Latin America, Channel 4 in the UK, NHK in Japan and was in the children&#x27;s weekday lineup for much of the mid-to-late 1990s on the ABC in Australia. Repeats of the show aired in 2003 on The N, but it was soon replaced there. The show aired occasionally on TeenNick&#x27;s 1990s-oriented block, &quot;The &#x27;90s Are All That&quot;.

==Cast reunion==
&quot;The Secret World of Alex Mack 20 Year Reunion&quot; was recorded in 2018 and released as a TV movie on YouTube and Vimeo. Initially a live convention interview, the reunion featured numerous cast and crew members from the original TV series, revelations about their lives post-series, and discussions of a possible reboot or sequel. It was revealed that many of the cast members had gone on to various endeavors, with moderate success: Larisa Oleynik (Alex) had gone on to earn mainstream adult roles in shows such as &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot;, while other cast members had largely left acting. Alexis Fields (Nicole) had gone on to a career in interior design, John Marzilli (Vince) had adopted a son who attended the cast reunion, and Darris Love (Ray) became involved in acting and music.

==Home media==
A single VHS volume containing two episodes titled &quot;In the Nick of Time&quot; was released by Sony Wonder in the United States in 1996.

The show&#x27;s first season (consisting of 13 episodes on two discs) was released by Genius Entertainment on DVD format on October 2, 2007. The set is noteworthy for giving Jessica Alba top billing on the package, most likely in an effort to sell more copies, even though she actually only appears in a supporting role, and only in a few episodes. This was then released in Region 2 on April 2, 2012, and in Region 4 on June 6, 2012.

The first and second seasons are available through Amazon.com&#x27;s Instant Video section and through iTunes.

Mill Creek Entertainment released the complete series on DVD for the very first time on August 1, 2017.

=== DVD boxed set controversy ===
The UK release of the series&#x27; DVD boxed set received a rating of &#x27;15&#x27; from the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), a rating considered restrictive, particularly since the series was initially aimed at preteens. It was eventually revealed by the BBFC that the &#x27;15&#x27; rating was applied to the boxed set because of a season 1 episode called &quot;Shock Value&quot; where Alex is seen climbing into a clothesdryer from the pilot. According to the BBFC, &quot;The presentation of this behaviour is comic and no negative consequences are shown which would warn young viewers of the potential dangers of hiding in such appliances. While fatal incidents of children trapped in washing machines or fridges are rare, there remains sufficient cause for serious concern. The distributor indicated that they would be happy to accept a higher certificate rather than cutting the episode. The TV series is rather dated and would not have much appeal to a young audience when compared to current children&#x27;s TV programmes. In addition, as the work was being targeted at an adult &#x27;nostalgia&#x27; market, children would not be the natural audience.&quot;

==Book series==
A book series aimed at young readers was released along with the series. The first and last books of the series are novelizations of the first and last episodes, respectively. The rest of the series consists of completely original stories, tied into the main series through the mentioning of various plot points from the TV episodes. There were 34 books in total, all released as mass-market paperbacks from Simon &amp; Schuster. Authors Diana G. Gallagher and Cathy East Dubowski were the predominant authors of the series, although other authors were recruited in-between to write certain titles.

The following titles were included in the series (in order, published between the years 1995 to 1998; note that the exclamation point at the end of each title was a stylized and intentional punctuation):

All 34 books have been out of print since the 1990s, although second-hand copies continue to circulate.

<text>Radio London, also known as Big L and Wonderful Radio London, was a top 40 (in London&#x27;s case, the &quot;Fab 40&quot;) offshore commercial station that operated from 23 December 1964 to 14 August 1967, from a ship anchored in the North Sea, off Frinton-on-Sea, Essex, England. 

The station, like other offshore radio operators, was dubbed a pirate radio station, and went off air following the introduction of the Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967 which made it illegal to supply or assist such stations except in an emergency. The station was notable for helping to launch the careers of various disc jockeys who went on to work at BBC Radio 1. Its offices were in the West End of London at 17 Curzon Street, just off Park Lane.

== Origin of the station ==
Radio London was the brainchild of Don Pierson, who lived in Eastland, Texas, United States. In a 1984 interview, Pierson said he got the idea in 1964, while reading a report in &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; of the start of Radio Caroline and Radio Atlanta from ships that were at that time anchored off south-east England.

Pierson said he was struck by the fact that those two offshore stations were the first and only all-day commercial radio broadcasters serving the UK. An entrepreneur, he compared the number of stations then serving the population of his native northwest Texas with the two stations serving the entire UK. He told Eric Gilder that he thought his idea would make a lot of money while bringing enjoyment to many people. Pierson caught the next night flight from Love Field in Dallas to the UK, where he chartered a small plane and flew over the two radio ships. After taking photographs, he returned to Texas determined to create a station bigger and better than either.

Radio London broadcast from the MV &quot;Galaxy&quot;, a former Second World War United States Navy minesweeper, originally named USS &quot;Density&quot;. It was fitted out for radio broadcasting in Miami, then sailed across the Atlantic to the Azores, where the antenna was erected, before final positioning off the Essex coast. The operation was overseen by one of the other investors, Tom Danaher.

Owing to a disagreement with the other investors, Pierson left the Radio London consortium. His participation ended several weeks before the station went on air, although he kept a small shareholding.

==Broadcasting staff==
The disc jockeys included Chuck Blair, Tony Blackburn, Pete Brady, Tony Brandon, Dave Cash (who also teamed up to present a popular &quot;Kenny and Cash Show&quot;), Ian Damon, Chris Denning, Dave Dennis, Pete Drummond, John Edward, Kenny Everett (co-host of the &quot;Kenny and Cash Show&quot;, and ultimately fired for continual on-air criticism of the religious programme, &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot;), Graham Gill, Bill Hearne, Duncan Johnson, Paul Kaye (who became the main news reader), Lorne King, &quot;Marshall&quot; Mike Lennox, John Peel (see &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot;), Earl Richmond, Mark Roman, John Sedd, Keith Skues, Ed Stewart, Norman St. John, Tommy Vance (who came to the station via Radio Caroline South and had been on KHJ Los Angeles), Richard Warner, Willy Walker, Alan West, Tony Windsor (who had begun his offshore career with Radio Atlanta) and John Yorke.

In August 1966, the Beatles began their last US concert tour. After the storm John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;more popular than Jesus&quot; comment caused in the US, the group&#x27;s reception was a cause for speculation – and the Beatles&#x27; management arranged for British journalists to accompany them. Radio London&#x27;s Kenny Everett (a Liverpudlian), Caroline&#x27;s Jerry Leighton, and Swinging Radio England&#x27;s Ron O&#x27;Quinn were invited. Because the UK Post Office – at that time the country&#x27;s monopoly telephone service provider – had cut ship-to-shore communication with pirate vessels, Everett had to call a number on land.

Paul Kaye would go ashore, take the call in Harwich and tape the conversation before heading back to the ship, where the recording was edited and music inserted to make a 30-minute programme, sponsored by Bassett&#x27;s, whose Jelly Babies were allegedly the Beatles&#x27; favourite. The shows went out each evening at 7.30 for 40 days of the tour. In 1967, Radio London got an eight-day UK exclusive on the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, playing it first on 12 May 1967. The album was in the shops on 1 June 1967, but Everett had left the station on 21 March that year.

==Advertising sales==
A Cadillac car dealer in Abilene, Texas, who became one of the investors associated with Pierson, nominated Philip Birch, a J. Walter Thompson account director who had relocated from JWT&#x27;s offices in the US to their offices in London. Birch became managing director, responsible for the entire management of Radio London and its sales company, Radlon (Sales). Birch was largely responsible for the station&#x27;s success, tailoring the American-style format to a British audience.

The cost of the station was covered by local and national advertising and the half-hour religious commentary, &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot;, presented by Herbert W. Armstrong or his son, Garner Ted Armstrong. The Armstrongs&#x27; Worldwide Church of God sponsored the station with £50,000 a year. &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; aired at 7pm, outside prime hours.

British authorities would not register a British sales company called &quot;Radio London&quot; because the name was &quot;too similar&quot; to an existing company, Commercial Radio (London), so it was registered as &quot;Radlon (Sales) Ltd&quot;. It was owned by Philip Birch and was the name on the air for advertising sales. The investors were in Texas and used different names for interlocking companies outside the UK and USA to disguise their interests, primarily for tax reasons.

After closure of &quot;Big L&quot;, Birch became the founding managing director of Piccadilly Radio, which was awarded the UK licence for Manchester in 1973 and became one of Britain&#x27;s most successful radio stations. He also founded Air Services, selling national advertising for stations throughout the UK. He continued as CEO of Piccadilly Radio and chairman of Air Services until his retirement in January 1984.

==Station name==
The station was to have been called Radio KLIF London, using recorded programmes from the Dallas AM radio station, KLIF 1190. When it was decided that the sound should be live and geared towards a British audience and culture, Pierson hired Ben Toney as Programme Director. Philip Birch was appointed CEO in charge of the radio station and advertising sales. Birch suggested calling the station Radio Galaxy, in anticipation of its star-making ability.

As a compromise the minesweeper was renamed MV &quot;Galaxy&quot; while the station itself became Radio London. However, the PAMS jingles brought a refinement of the name so that it was known as &quot;Wonderful Radio London&quot; and &quot;Big L&quot;; just as KLIF in Dallas called its hometown &quot;Big D&quot;.

== Technical facilities ==
Virtually all DJ programmes originated live from a studio located in the hold at the rear of the ship. The original studio was installed by RCA while the ship was being fitted out in Miami, but the ship&#x27;s metal bulkheads presented problems with acoustics and soundproofing. That was rectified by lining the walls with mattresses and blankets from the crew&#x27;s bunk beds, although that meant no-one could sleep during the daytime. In early 1966, two new studios were constructed (also below the water-line), with proper acoustics and a more ergonomic layout - the main on-air/DJ studio had a modern sound/mixing board, and a smaller one for the hourly news bulletins, production (of commercials, etc.) and as backup.

Radio London&#x27;s transmitter was housed in a large purpose-built steel shed on the rear deck, because it was too large to fit in the hold. The US-manufactured RCA Ampliphase transmitter was rated at 50,000 watts (50kW). An on-air slogan ran &#x27;Your 50,000-watt Tower of Power&#x27;, although initially it operated at 17kW. In contrast, Radio Caroline, its main rival, operated with a Continental Electronics 10kW transmitter. In 1966, Caroline South upgraded to a 50kW Continental transmitter and, for a time, Radio London pretended to retaliate by increasing its power to 75kW.

The station&#x27;s antenna was a vertical-guyed tubular steel mast aft of the bridge. Radio London&#x27;s publicity claimed the mast was high, but later calculations from photographs indicated that it was approximately , . The positioning of the antenna was at the ship&#x27;s centre of gravity and that was critical, as no cement ballast was used in the ship&#x27;s hull to counteract movement caused by such a tall and heavy mast on a floating vessel.

Although the wavelength was announced as &quot;266 metres&quot;, the station experimented with frequencies between , and , and tended to suffer night-time heterodyne interference from stations in Zagreb and elsewhere. In October 1966, a number of test transmissions took place on , announced as &quot;277 metres&quot;, using a 10kW standby transmitter, but it was decided not to change frequency on a permanent basis. When Radio 270 off Scarborough UK started transmissions in June 1966 on , it interfered with Big L Radio London for about 5 days, before Radio London finally made the big step from to its permanent and final that had the typical 4 and 5 kHz heterodynes caused by and . In early 1966, Radio London briefly hopped from to due to its increased strong signal, causing interference to Radio Zagreb on . In October 1966, QSL cards reported Radio London having been received in faraway places such as Illinois, USA, Kimberley and Riversdale, South Africa due to favourable atmospheric propagation conditions and the split-frequency Radio London used.

After Radio Caroline South increased power and changed its frequency to in the spring of 1966, it caused some interference to Radio London on . That seems to have been caused by resonance between the two ships&#x27; antenna masts, and possibly by the &quot;Galaxy&quot;″s steel hull.

==Station closedown==
At midnight on 14 August 1967, the Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967 came into effect in the United Kingdom. It created a criminal offence of supplying music, commentary, advertising, fuel, food, water or other assistance except for life-saving, to any ship, offshore structure such as a former WWII fort, or flying platform such as an aircraft used for broadcasting without a licence from the regulatory authority in the UK. Despite initial plans to the contrary, Radio London decided not to defy the law, and closed before the Act came into effect.

It was decided to close at 3pm on 14 August 1967, partly to guarantee a large audience, as well as to enable the ship&#x27;s DJs and other staff to return to shore and board a train to London. A one-hour recorded show was broadcast from 2pm to allow staff to get ready to leave. The time also described an &quot;L&quot; shape of the hands on a clock face, but whether that was a real consideration is unknown.

&quot;Their Final Hour&quot;, as the programme was called, had recorded greetings of farewell and remembrance from recording stars; included were the voices of Mick Jagger, Cliff Richard, Ringo Starr and Dusty Springfield. The 2:30 news bulletin, read by Paul Kaye, was the final live segment on the station. Birch thanked DJs and staff and others involved throughout the station&#x27;s life, as well as politicians and others who fought for the station – and its 12 million listeners in the United Kingdom and four million in the Netherlands, Belgium and France&#x27;. That was followed by the last record, &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; by the Beatles, then Paul Kaye&#x27;s final announcement: &quot;Big L time is three o&#x27;clock, and Radio London is now closing down&quot;. Radio London&#x27;s theme tune, the &quot;PAMS Sonowaltz&quot;, popularly called &quot;Big Lil&quot;, was played before the transmitter was switched off by engineer Russell Tollerfield, just after 3pm.

Just after Radio London closed down, Robbie Dale on Radio Caroline South (previously Radio Atlanta) broadcast a brief tribute to the station, thanked its staff and DJs, and held a minute&#x27;s silence. Most offshore stations had already left the air. Radio Scotland and Radio 270 closed at midnight. Radio Caroline South said it and Radio Caroline North (the original Caroline) would continue. Owner Ronan O&#x27;Rahilly said they were defending the principle of free broadcasting, rather than being mere business assets. Caroline&#x27;s offshore broadcasts continued on and off until 1990, after which the station pursued legal means of broadcasting.

Radio London staff arriving at London&#x27;s Liverpool Street station from Harwich were greeted by large numbers of fans, some wearing black armbands and carrying placards with slogans such as &quot;Freedom went with Radio London&quot;. They tried to storm the platform, leading to minor scuffles with police.
The MV &quot;Galaxy&quot; sailed initially to Hamburg, West Germany, where Erwin Meister and Edwin Bollier tried to buy it for what became Radio Nordsee International. When the deal fell through, Meister and Bollier looked for another ship. In 1979, the &quot;Galaxy&quot;, with its 170 ft mast still erect, was sunk in Kiel harbour as an artificial reef; but, in 1986, concerns about pollution from the ship&#x27;s fuel tanks resulted in it being brought ashore and salvaged.

==Further history==
When his second radio ship closed and the vessel returned to Miami, Florida, in 1967, Don Pierson attempted to restart &quot;Wonderful Radio London&quot; from there. His plan was to interest investors in restarting Radio London off-shore from New York. When that failed, he began a venture involving yet another ship which would restart &quot;Wonderful Radio London&quot; off San Diego, California. That, too, sank.

In 1982, Pierson helped promote a syndicated &quot;Wonderful Radio London Show&quot;, first aired over KVMX, a station he owned in Eastland, Texas. He promoted the show at the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas, Nevada. When Ben Toney, the original offshore Radio London programme director, became involved, the show was on KXOL in Fort Worth, Texas, and as a daily show aired over 250,000-watt XERF in Mexico. Plans were made to extend the early morning airtime of XERF into &quot;Wonderful Radio London&quot; as a full service station, and to send a new ship to the UK as &quot;Wonderful Radio London International&quot;&#x27; (WRLI), to replicate Radio London&#x27;s success of the 1960s. However, those further plans failed to materialise beyond their syndication stage.

Pierson died in 1996.

==Swinging Radio England and Britain Radio==
As a result of Radio London, Pierson created Swinging Radio England and Britain Radio on another ship (the MV &quot;Olga Patricia&quot;; later renamed MV &quot;Laissez Faire&quot;) in 1965. They did not get to air until 1966 when their vessel anchored close to the MV &quot;Galaxy&quot;. The twin stations were not commercially successful due to their brash American radio style, technical problems, and mismanagement. Dutch station Radio Dolfijn replaced Radio England in November 1966. Radio 355 replaced Britain Radio and Dolfijn gave way to Radio Twee Twee Zeven (227) in early 1967.

==In pop culture==
*Wonderful Radio London is referred to (and some of its jingles used) on The Who&#x27;s album &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; and their film &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;.
*The station features in the 1966 film &quot;Dateline Diamonds&quot;, which includes a few external shots of the &quot;Galaxy&quot; and a fanciful studio re-creation of its interior.
*Radio London was parodied in the film &quot;The Boat That Rocked&quot;.

<text>ROCS &quot;Kee Lung&quot; (基隆; DDG-1801) is the lead ship of her class of guided-missile destroyers currently in active service of Republic of China Navy.

==History==
While &quot;Kee Lung&quot; is the lead ship of her class, she was actually not the first ship in her class built. &quot;Kee Lung&quot; was formerly the American , which was decommissioned by the United States Navy in 1998. &quot;Scott&quot; was sold to the Republic of China Navy along with the other three &quot;Kidd&quot;-class destroyers in 2001. &quot;Scott&quot; was then renamed to &quot;Kee Long&quot; was the first of the four ships to be commissioned in the Republic of China Navy which made her the lead ship in the Republic of China Navy. Ironically, the , which was the original lead ship of the class, was also sold to the Republic of China Navy in 2006 and was renamed ROCS &quot;Tso Ying&quot; (DDG-1803). For a period of time &quot;Kee Lung&quot; was tentatively named Chi Teh (紀德), a transliteration of &quot;Kidd&quot; into Chinese. But it was later decided to name her after the port of Keelung, a major naval port in northern Taiwan.

&quot;Kee Lung&quot;, along with her three sister ships, is the largest destroyer and second largest ship in displacement ever in Republic of China Navy service, only smaller than ROCS &quot;Hsu Hai&quot; (LSD-193), a dock landing ship. &quot;Kee Lung&quot; was re-fitted for service in the ROCN at Detyen&#x27;s Shipyard in North Charleston, South Carolina. She was formally commissioned on 17 December 2005 along with sister ship .
==Specifications==

&quot;Kee Lung&quot; is the only one of her sister ships to be equipped with LAMPS III system and flight deck strengthened. This enables &quot;Kee Lung&quot; to carry up to two of the more capable Sikorsky S-70(M)-1/2 Seahawk helicopters for anti-submarine warfare, compared to her sister ships.

<text>In Greek mythology, Themiste () or [[Themis]] was a Trojan princess and daughter of King Ilus II of Troad. She was the (half) sister of Laomedon, Tithonius and Telecleia. Themiste was married off by Ilus to her cousin King Capys, son of Assaracus and Hieromneme, and became the queen of Dardania. With him she became the mother of Anchises and possibly, Acoetes. The former son would later become the father of the famous Aeneas while the later one, became the father of the priest Laocoon.

<doc id="1025748" wikidata="Q1557613" url="?curid=1025748" title="Lévy process">
<text>In probability theory, a Lévy process, named after the French mathematician Paul Lévy, is a stochastic process with independent, stationary increments: it represents the motion of a point whose successive displacements are random, in which displacements in pairwise disjoint time intervals are independent, and displacements in different time intervals of the same length have identical probability distributions. A Lévy process may thus be viewed as the continuous-time analog of a random walk.

The most well known examples of Lévy processes are the Wiener process, often called the Brownian motion process, and the Poisson process. Further important examples include the Gamma process, the Pascal process, and the Meixner process. Aside from Brownian motion with drift, all other proper (that is, not deterministic) Lévy processes have discontinuous paths. All Lévy processes are additive processes.

== Mathematical definition ==
A Lévy process is a stochastic process formula_1 that satisfies the following properties:
# formula_2 almost surely;
# Independence of increments: For any formula_3, formula_4 are mutually independent;
# Stationary increments: For any formula_5, formula_6 is equal in distribution to formula_7
# Continuity in probability: For any formula_8 and formula_9 it holds that formula_10

If formula_11 is a Lévy process then one may construct a version of formula_11 such that formula_13 is almost surely right-continuous with left limits.

== Properties ==

=== Independent increments ===
A continuous-time stochastic process assigns a random variable &quot;X&quot;&quot;t&quot; to each point &quot;t&quot; ≥ 0 in time. In effect it is a random function of &quot;t&quot;. The increments of such a process are the differences &quot;X&quot;&quot;s&quot; − &quot;X&quot;&quot;t&quot; between its values at different times &quot;t&quot; &lt; &quot;s&quot;. To call the increments of a process independent means that increments &quot;X&quot;&quot;s&quot; − &quot;X&quot;&quot;t&quot; and &quot;X&quot;&quot;u&quot; − &quot;X&quot;&quot;v&quot; are independent random variables whenever the two time intervals do not overlap and, more generally, any finite number of increments assigned to pairwise non-overlapping time intervals are mutually (not just pairwise) independent.

=== Stationary increments ===

To call the increments stationary means that the probability distribution of any increment &quot;X&quot;&quot;t&quot; − &quot;X&quot;&quot;s&quot; depends only on the length &quot;t&quot; − &quot;s&quot; of the time interval; increments on equally long time intervals are identically distributed.

If formula_11 is a Wiener process, the probability distribution of &quot;X&quot;&quot;t&quot; − &quot;X&quot;&quot;s&quot; is normal with expected value 0 and variance &quot;t&quot; − &quot;s&quot;.

If formula_11 is a Poisson process, the probability distribution of &quot;X&quot;&quot;t&quot; − &quot;X&quot;&quot;s&quot; is a Poisson distribution with expected value λ(&quot;t&quot; − &quot;s&quot;), where λ &gt; 0 is the &quot;intensity&quot; or &quot;rate&quot; of the process.

If formula_11 is a Cauchy process, the probability distribution of &quot;X&quot;&quot;t&quot; − &quot;X&quot;&quot;s&quot; is a Cauchy distribution with density formula_17.

=== Infinite divisibility ===
The distribution of a Lévy process has the property of infinite divisibility: given any integer &quot;n&quot;, the law of a Lévy process at time t can be represented as the law of the sum of &quot;n&quot; independent random variables, which are precisely the increments of the Lévy process over time intervals of length &quot;t&quot;/&quot;n,&quot; which are independent and identically distributed by assumptions 2 and 3. Conversely, for each infinitely divisible probability distribution formula_18, there is a Lévy process formula_11 such that the law of formula_20 is given by formula_18.

=== Moments ===
In any Lévy process with finite moments, the &quot;n&quot;th moment formula_22, is a polynomial function of &quot;t&quot;; these functions satisfy a binomial identity:

:formula_23

== Lévy–Khintchine representation ==
The distribution of a Lévy process is characterized by its characteristic function, which is given by the Lévy–Khintchine formula (general for all infinitely divisible distributions): If formula_24 is a Lévy process, then its characteristic function formula_25 is given by
:formula_26
where formula_27, formula_28, and formula_29 is a -finite measure called the Lévy measure of formula_11, satisfying the property
:formula_31
In the above, formula_32 is the indicator function. Because characteristic functions uniquely determine their underlying probability distributions, each Lévy process is uniquely determined by the &quot;Lévy–Khintchine triplet&quot; formula_33. The terms of this triplet suggest that a Lévy process can be seen as having three independent components: a linear drift, a Brownian motion, and a Lévy jump process, as described below. This immediately gives that the only (nondeterministic) continuous Lévy process is a Brownian motion with drift; similarly, every Lévy process is a semimartingale.

=== Lévy–Itô decomposition ===
Because the characteristic functions of independent random variables multiply, the Lévy–Khintchine theorem suggests that every Lévy process is the sum of Brownian motion with drift and another independent random variable, a Lévy jump process. The Lévy–Itô decomposition describes the latter as a (stochastic) sum of independent Poisson random variables.

Let formula_34— that is, the restriction of formula_29 to formula_36, normalized to be a probability measure; similarly, let formula_37 (but do not rescale). Then 
:formula_38

The former is the characteristic function of a compound Poisson process with intensity formula_39 and child distribution formula_40. The latter is that of a compensated generalized Poisson process (CGPP): a process with countably many jump discontinuities on every interval a.s., but such that those discontinuities are of magnitude less than formula_41. If formula_42, then the CGPP is a pure jump process. Therefore in terms of processes one may decompose formula_11 in the following way
:formula_44
where formula_45 is the compound Poisson process with jumps larger than formula_41 in absolute value and formula_47 is the aforementioned compensated generalized Poisson process which is also a zero-mean martingale.

== Generalization ==

A Lévy random field is a multi-dimensional generalization of Lévy process.
Still more general are decomposable processes.

<doc id="1025751" wikidata="Q1459175" url="?curid=1025751" title="USS Chandler (DDG-996)">
<text>USS &quot;Chandler&quot; (DDG-996) was the final ship in the &quot;Kidd&quot; class of guided-missile destroyers operated by the U.S. Navy. Derived from the &quot;Spruance class&quot;, these vessels were designed for air defense in hot weather. She was named after Rear Admiral Theodore E. Chandler.

Originally named &quot;Andushirvan&quot;, the ship was originally ordered by the Shah of Iran, but was undelivered when the 1979 Iranian Revolution occurred. Subsequent to this, the U.S. Navy elected to commission her for service in the Persian Gulf and Mediterranean Sea, as she was equipped with heavy-duty air conditioning and was also well suited to filtering sand and the results from NBC warfare. She was commissioned in 1982.

&quot;Chandler&quot; was decommissioned in 1999. She was transferred to the Republic of China, renamed &quot;Wu Teh&quot; (DDG-1805) in 2004, and finally recommissioned as [[ROCS Ma Kong (DDG-1805)|ROCS &quot;Ma Kong&quot;]] (DDG-1805) in 2006.

== Accident ==
In June 1985, &quot;Chandler&quot; was involved in an accident on the Columbia River. The ship itself was sued under Admiralty law in the United States by a barge owner who claimed that &quot;Chandler&quot;″s negligent action on the Columbia River caused a dangerous swell called a soliton.

The District Court of Oregon heard the case and held that the officers on &quot;Chandler&quot; breached their duty to exercise reasonable care in avoiding creation of the dangerous swell and the plaintiff was able to recover for the damages.

==Awards==

<doc id="1025752" wikidata="Q4052280" url="?curid=1025752" title="USS Scott (DDG-995)">
<text>USS &quot;Scott&quot; (DDG-995) was a of the United States Navy. She was named for Rear Admiral Norman Scott, who was killed during a surface action at the First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Battle of Friday the 13th&quot;) aboard USS &quot;Atlanta&quot;, receiving a posthumous Medal of Honor for his actions.

Originally named &quot;Nader&quot;, &quot;Scott&quot; was ordered by the Shah of Iran, but was undelivered at the time of the Iranian Revolution and the U.S. Navy elected to commission her and her sister ships for service in the Persian Gulf. The destroyers were equipped with heavy-duty air conditioning and were also well suited to filtering sand and the results from NBC warfare. She was commissioned in 1981.

&quot;Scott&quot; completed a major re-fit in Philadelphia in 1988 that focused on upgrading its radar and fire control tracking system.

&quot;Scott&quot; was decommissioned from the U.S. Navy on 10 December 1998.

==Current status==
&quot;Scott&quot; was sold to the Republic of China in 2004, originally to be named &quot;Chi Te&quot;. However, due to her better storage condition than her sister ships, she became the first &quot;Kidd&quot;-class vessel to be commissioned by the Republic of China Navy (ROCN) and thus became ROCS &quot;Kee Lung&quot; (DDG-1801), the lead vessel of the new ROCN &quot;Kee Lung&quot;-class destroyers.

After almost two years of refit and training in the U.S., the &quot;Kee Lung&quot; was commissioned on 17 December 2005 at Keelung naval port in northern Taiwan. The ROCN paid just over $690 million for the four &quot;Kidd&quot;-class destroyers, giving it extensive anti-aircraft warfare (AAW) capabilities.

<doc id="1025763" wikidata="Q7409169" url="?curid=1025763" title="Same-sex marriage in Saskatchewan">
<text>Same-sex marriage has been legal in Saskatchewan since November 5, 2004 as a result of a decision of the Family Law Division of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench. This decision followed similar cases in six other provinces and territories, and pre-dated by eight months the federal &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; of 2005, which made same-sex marriage available throughout Canada. Later court decisions have dealt with the issue of marriage commissioners who object to performing same-sex marriages on the basis of their religious beliefs.

Saskatchewan was the seventh jurisdiction in Canada, and the tenth in the world after the Netherlands, Belgium, Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, Massachusetts, Yukon, Manitoba and Nova Scotia, to legalise same-sex marriage.

==Court cases==
===&quot;N.W. v. Canada (Attorney General)&quot; ===
In the fall of 2004, five same-sex couples brought an application in the Family Law Division of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench, seeking a judgment requiring marriage licence issuers appointed by the provincial government to issue marriage licences to same-sex couples. The application was based on the argument that the traditional common-law definition of marriage discriminated against same-sex couples on the basis of sexual orientation, contrary to the equality clause of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. At the time of the application, courts in six other Canadian provinces and territories had upheld the constitutionality of same-sex marriage in Canada. The application named as parties both the Attorney General of Canada, Irwin Cotler, and the Attorney General for Saskatchewan, Frank Quennell. Both the federal and provincial governments were parties; the former because the substantive law governing the definition of marriage is a matter of federal jurisdiction under the Constitution of Canada, and the latter because marriage licence issuers are provincial officials appointed under Saskatchewan&#x27;s marriage legislation. Quennell had already stated in September 2004 that he would not oppose such a court bid. The Green Party of Saskatchewan supported the couples, and had issued a statement supporting same-sex marriage rights in April 2004, &quot;Giving same sex couples the same range of choices as opposite sex couples is a simple question of fairness and human dignity. Either this government supports equality or it does not.&quot;

On 3 November 2004, the five couples appeared before Justice Donna Wilson on the application. Neither the federal nor the provincial governments challenged the suit. Greg Walen, lawyer for one of the couples, had filed a statement of claim seeking a declaratory judgment that the common-law definition of marriage be changed to include the wording &quot;two people to the exclusion of others&quot;, rather than &quot;two people of the opposite sex&quot;. On 5 November, Justice Wilson ruled that the common-law opposite-sex definition of marriage violated the equality rights of same-sex couples under the &quot;Charter&quot;, and that &quot;the common-law definition of marriage for civil purposes is declared to be &#x27;the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others.&#x27;&quot; Justice Wilson also ordered the federal and provincial attorneys general to pay court costs to the applicants, on a solicitor-client basis, fixed at a total of $10,000, divided evenly between the two governments.

Walen of the Saskatoon law firm Scharfstein, Gibbings, Walen, &amp; Fisher issued a statement following the court ruling that &quot;[t]he judge found that it is unconstitutional to exclude same-sex couples from civil marriage and changed the law to include them. The judge agreed with the Ontario Court of Appeal that &#x27;the dignity of persons in same-sex relationships is violated by the exclusion of same-sex couples from the institution of marriage&#x27;...The judge agreed with the Yukon court that the province had a choice whether or not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, and it chose not to. As a result, costs were awarded on an increased scale against both the province and the federal government.&quot; Spokespeople for Canadians for Equal Marriage, Egale Canada and the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour welcomed the court decision. James Hein-Blackmore, a plaintiff in the case, said, &quot;What this means to me is peace of mind. The day we were married was a great day of happiness as we professed our love to one another. But not having our marriage recognized here in Saskatchewan was a great burden. Now I know that no matter what happens in our lives or our health, I can rest assured that my husband will have all the legal rights to handle things the way we want them.&quot; Attorney General Quennell said he would not appeal the decision.

=== &quot;M.J. v. Nichols&quot; ===
In 2005, Orville Nichols, a 30-year marriage commissioner and devout Baptist, refused to marry a same-sex couple, M.J. and B.R., because it conflicted with his religious beliefs. M.J. filed a complaint under the &quot;Saskatchewan Human Rights Code&quot; that &quot;Mr. Nichols refused to perform a marriage between M.J. and B.R. on the basis of the prohibited ground of M.J.&#x27;s sexual orientation.&quot; The Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal ordered Nichols to pay $2,500 in compensation to the couple for infringing their right to access public services without discrimination. In 2009, the Saskatchewan Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench dismissed Nichols&#x27; appeal.

The Saskatchewan Government followed by proposing legislation which would have allowed marriage commissioners to refuse for this reason. In January 2011, on a reference question, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal ruled that such a law would be unconstitutional. It was estimated at the time that about 1% of the existing marriage commissioners would resign or be fired because they were unwilling to issue licences to same-sex couples. Provincial law permits religious bodies and officials—but not marriage commissioners—to refuse to perform a marriage in their place of worship for religious reasons.

==Provincial legislation==
In 2001, the Saskatchewan Legislature passed two statutes, the &quot;Miscellaneous Statutes (Domestic Relations) Amendment Act, 2001&quot;, and the &quot;Miscellaneous Statutes (Domestic Relations) Amendment Act, 2001 (No. 2)&quot;, which together changed the definition of &quot;spouse&quot; in 24 provincial laws to treat same-sex couples equally to opposite-sex couples. The changes included the areas of adoption, spousal support, inheritance rights, pensions, and property rights. This meant that same-sex couples were given the right adopt children jointly. The two acts received royal assent by Lieutenant Governor Lynda Haverstock on 6 July 2001.

Historically, the provincial &quot;Marriage Act, 1995&quot; required marriage commissioners to pronounce a newlywed couple as &quot;husband and wife&quot;. In 2021, the Saskatchewan Legislature repealed the Act and enacted in its stead the &quot;Marriage Act, 2021&quot;, which received royal assent by Lieutenant Governor Russell Mirasty on 13 May 2021. The new law uses gender-neutral language with regard to married spouses. Section 5-9(2) of the Act states that each of the parties shall, in the presence of the marriage commissioner and the witnesses, declare:

==Marriage statistics==
The 2016 Canadian census showed that there were 1,070 same-sex couples living in Saskatchewan.

The first same-sex marriage in La Loche in the Clearwater River Dene Nation was performed in summer 2018 for a Dene two-spirit couple.

==Religious performance==
In July 2019, the synod of the Anglican Church of Canada passed a resolution known as &quot;A Word to the Church&quot;, allowing its dioceses to choose whether to bless and perform same-sex marriages. Following the vote, the Diocese of Saskatoon announced that its clergy would be permitted to solemnise same-sex marriages. Same-sex marriages are not performed in the Diocese of Qu&#x27;Appelle, which encompasses the southern third of Saskatchewan. The marriage canon of the Anglican Church of Canada serves as the canon on marriage in the diocese. The Diocese of Saskatchewan likewise does not perform same-sex marriages.

Some other religious organisations also perform same-sex marriages in their places of worship, including the United Church of Canada, Quakers, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, and the Canadian Unitarian Council. A same-sex couple was married on December 31, 2014 in a Mennonite congregation in Saskatoon, the first same-sex marriage in the Mennonite Church Canada.

<text>A type-in program or type-in listing was computer source code printed in a home computer magazine or book. It was meant to be entered via the keyboard by the reader and then saved to cassette tape or floppy disk. The result was a usable game, utility, or application program.

Type-in programs were common in the home computer era from the late 1970s through the early 1990s, when the RAM of 8-bit systems was measured in kilobytes and most computer owners did not have access to networks such as bulletin board systems. 

Magazines such as &quot;Softalk&quot;, &quot;Compute!&quot;, &quot;ANALOG Computing&quot;, and &quot;Ahoy!&quot; dedicated much of each issue to type-in programs. The magazines could contain multiple games or other programs for a fraction of the cost of purchasing commercial software on removable media, but the user had to spend up to several hours typing each one in. Most listings were either in a system-specific BASIC dialect or machine code. Machine code programs were long lists of decimal or hexadecimal numbers, often in the form of codice_1 statements in BASIC. Most magazines had error checking software to make sure a program was typed correctly.

Type-in programs did not carry over to 16-bit computers such as the Amiga and Atari ST in a significant way, as both programs and data (such as graphics) became much larger. It became common to include a covermount 3 -inch floppy disk or CD-ROM with each issue of a magazine.

== Description ==

A reader would take a printed copy of the program listing, such as from a magazine or book, sit down at a computer, and manually enter the lines of code. Computers of this era automatically booted into a programming environment – even the commands to load and run a prepackaged program were really programming commands executed in direct mode. After typing the program in, the user would be able to run it and also to save it to disk or a cassette for future use. Users were often cautioned to save the program before running it, as errors could result in a crash requiring a reboot, which would render the program irretrievable unless it had been saved. While some type-in programs were short, simple utility or demonstration programs, many type-ins were fully functional games or application software, sometimes rivaling commercial packages.

Type-ins were usually written in BASIC or a combination of a BASIC loader and machine code. In the latter case, the opcodes and operands of the machine code part were often simply given as DATA statements within the BASIC program, and were loaded using a POKE loop, since few users had access to an assembler. In some cases, a special program for entering machine code numerically was provided. Programs with a machine code component sometimes included assembly language listings for users who had assemblers and who were interested in the internal workings of the program.

The downside of type-ins was labor. The work required to enter a medium-sized type-in was on the order of hours. If the resulting program turned out not to be to the user&#x27;s taste, it was quite possible that the user spent more time keying in the program than using it. Additionally, type-ins were error-prone, both for users and for the magazines. This was especially true of the machine code parts of BASIC programs, which were nothing but line after line of data, e.g. DATA statements in the BASIC language. In some cases where the version of ASCII used on the type of computer the program was published for included printable characters for each value from 0–255, the code could have been printed using strings that contained the glyphs that the values mapped to, or a mnemonic such as [SHIFT-R] instructing the user which keys to press. While a BASIC program would often stop with an error at an incorrect statement, the machine code parts of a program could fail in untraceable ways. This made the correct entry of programs difficult.

Other solutions existed for the tedium of typing in seemingly-endless lines of code. Freelance authors wrote most magazine type-in programs and, in the accompanying article, often provided readers a mailing address to send a small sum (US$3 was typical) to buy the program on disk or tape. By the mid-1980s, recognising this demand from readers, many US-published magazines offered all of each issue&#x27;s type-ins on an optional disk, often with a bonus program or two. Some of these disks became electronic publications in their own right, outlasting their parent magazine as happened with &quot;Loadstar&quot;. Some UK magazines occasionally offered a free flexi disc that played on a turntable connected to the microcomputer&#x27;s cassette input. Other input methods, such as the Cauzin Softstrip, were tried, without much success.

Not all type-ins were long. &quot;Run&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Magic&quot; column specialized in one-liner programs for the Commodore 64. These programs were often graphic demos or meant to illustrate a technical quirk of the computer&#x27;s architecture; the text accompanying the graphics demo programs would avoid explicitly describing the resultant image, enticing the reader to type it in.

== History ==
Type-in programs preceded the home computer era. As David H. Ahl wrote in 1983:

Upon Ahl&#x27;s departure from DEC in July 1974, he initiated a bimonthly magazine titled &quot;Creative Computing&quot; while serving as an educational marketing manager at AT&amp;T. The inaugural issue was released in October of that year, and by the fourth year, a team of eight individuals were working on it. The magazine featured computer games and its debut coincided with the introduction of the Altair 8800 - the first widely accessible computer kit - which was announced in January 1975, according to Ahl.

Most early computer magazines published type-in programs. The professional and business-oriented journals such as &quot;Byte&quot; and &quot;Popular Computing&quot; printed them less frequently, often as a test program to illustrate a technical topic covered in the magazine rather than an application for general use. Consumer-oriented publications such as &quot;Compute!&quot; and &quot;Family Computing&quot; ran several each issue. The programs were sometimes specific to a given home computer and sometimes compatible with several computers. Platform-specific magazines such as &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot; (VIC-20 and Commodore 64) and &quot;Antic&quot; (Atari 8-bit computers), since they only had to print one version of each program, were able to print more, longer listings.

Although type in programs were usually copyrighted, like the many games in &quot;BASIC Computer Games&quot;, authors often encouraged users to modify them, adding capabilities or otherwise changing them to suit their needs. Many authors used the article accompanying the type-ins to suggest modifications for the reader and programmer to perform. Users would sometimes send their changes back into the magazine for later publication. This could be considered a predecessor to open source software, but today most open source licenses specify that code be available in a machine-readable format.

&quot;Antic&quot; stated in 1985 that its staff &quot;spends a good portion of our time diligently combing the incoming submissions for practical application programs. We receive a lot of disk directory programs, recipe file storers, mini word processors, and other rehashed versions of old ideas&quot;. While most type-ins were simple games or utilities and likely only to hold a user&#x27;s interest for a short time, some were very ambitious, rivaling commercial software. Perhaps the most famous example is the type-in word processor &quot;SpeedScript&quot;, published by &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot; and &quot;Compute!&quot; for several 8-bit computers starting in 1984. &quot;Compute!&quot; also published &quot;SpeedScript&quot;, along with some accessory programs, in book form. It retained a following into the next decade as users refined and added capabilities to it.

&quot;Compute!&quot; discontinued type-in programs in May 1988, stating &quot;As computers and software have grown more powerful, we&#x27;ve realized it&#x27;s not possible to offer top quality type-in programs for &quot;all&quot; machines. And we also realize that &quot;you&#x27;re&quot; less inclined to type in those programs&quot;. As the cost of cassette tapes and floppy disks declined, and as the sophistication of commercial programs and the technical capabilities of the computers they ran on steadily increased, the importance of the type-in declined. In Europe, magazine covermount disks became common, and type-ins became virtually non-existent.

==Validation software==
To prevent errors when typing in listings, most publications provided short programs to verify that code was entered correctly. These were specific to a magazine or family of magazines, and different validation programs were usually used for BASIC source and binary data. &quot;Compute!&quot; and &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot; printed a short listing in each issue for The Automatic Proofreader to check BASIC programs, while &quot;ANALOG Computing&quot; used D:CHECK (for disk) and C:CHECK (for cassette tape).

For binary listings, &quot;Compute!&quot; and &quot;Ahoy!&quot; provided MLX and Flankspeed respectively, which were both interactive programs for entering data. The MIKBUG machine code monitor for the Motorola 6800 of the late 1970s incorporated a checksum into its hexadecimal program listings. &quot;ANALOG Computing&quot; presented machine code programs as BASIC codice_1 statements, then prepended a short program to compute checksums. Running the program output a list of values to be checked against those printed in the magazine. Upon successful validation, the program was saved as a binary file and the BASIC code no longer needed.

<doc id="1025771" wikidata="Q2872847" url="?curid=1025771" title="Ontario Highway 404">
<text>King&#x27;s Highway 404 (pronounced &quot;four-oh-four&quot;), also known as Highway 404 and colloquially as the 404, is a north-south 400-series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. A continuation of the municipal Don Valley Parkway (DVP) north of Highway 401, it connects Toronto with East Gwillimbury. The controlled-access freeway also connects with Highway 407 in Markham and the Don Valley Parkway in North York and Toronto, which formed the northeastern ring road of the Greater Toronto Area until the opening of Highway 412 in 2016. Highway 404 provides access to the eastern edge of Richmond Hill, Aurora and Newmarket and the western edge of Whitchurch-Stouffville, in addition to the southern edge of Keswick.

Metro Toronto (Metro) completed the Don Valley Parkway (DVP) to Sheppard Avenue in 1966. Metro initially planned extension of the DVP to Steeles Avenue, northward the province would continue the route which was inaugurated as Highway 404. However, the province ending up decided that their new highway would also run south of Steeles, incorporating the existing segment of the Metro-built DVP between Sheppard and Highway 401. The first section south of Steeles opened in 1977, over what was formerly Woodbine Avenue. Over the next twelve years, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) undertook a continuous construction program to extend the highway to Davis Drive in Newmarket. This was completed on October 24, 1989. The route has undergone a periodic series of smaller extensions and widening in the years since, now travelling a further north to Woodbine Avenue near Ravenshoe Road in the town of East Gwillimbury. It has been proposed to further extend the freeway to southeast of Beaverton.

Highway 404 is one of several freeways in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) with High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes; the southbound lane was one of the initial projects in the province and opened on December 13, 2005. The northbound lane opened on July 23, 2007.

== Route description ==

Running parallel to Highway 400 approximately to the east, Highway 404 extends on a north–south orientation between Highway 401 and Woodbine Avenue. There are 16 interchanges along its length, mostly of the Partial cloverleaf A4 configuration. Exit numbers on the freeway start at 17, suggesting that the length of the Don Valley Parkway was considered in distance calculations; until 2017, there were no exit numbers posted on the DVP.

A continuation of the municipal-controlled DVP, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) jurisdiction over the freeway begins as the opposing directions of travel diverge south of the Highway 401 interchange.
Northbound, two lanes from the DVP are joined by a third from the eastbound collectors of Highway 401. These narrow to two lanes before merging with a single lane from westbound Highway 401 immediately south of Sheppard Avenue. An additional two lanes from eastbound Highway 401 converge and form a separate carriageway with no access to Sheppard.
Southbound, the freeway is divided into two carriageways, both of which provide access to the DVP. The outer carriageway also provides access from Sheppard and to both directions of Highway 401, including the westbound express lanes, while the inner carriageway is intended for DVP-bound traffic. The HOV lane eventually merges with DVP-bound traffic, and also has an off-ramp via a tunnel to the Highway 401 westbound collector lanes.
To the east of Highway 404 is the Consumers Road office park. To the west and north of Sheppard Avenue is Fairview Mall, which has its own connection with the southbound lanes attached to the Sheppard interchange.

The highway continues directly north along the old Woodbine Avenue right-of-way to just south of Steeles Avenue. This section of the freeway is five lanes per direction (four general purpose lanes, one HOV lane near the central median), plus an auxiliary lane that emerges from an on-ramp of one interchange and then diverges at an off-ramp of the next interchange. Southbound, the HOV lane continues to the interchange at Highway 401. From just north of the Van Horne Avenue overpass, the leftmost northbound lane becomes an HOV lane. Alongside Highway 404 to the east is an industrial warehouse and commercial office area, while on the west is a suburban subdivision of North York.
At the interchange with Steeles Avenue which also includes a dedicated on-ramp from Woodbine Avenue (York Regional Road 8), the freeway enters the Regional Municipality of York where it diverges to the west before continuing north, running parallel to Woodbine Avenue. To the east are industrial units, while on the west are residential suburbs. This land-use persists north to the Highway 407 ETR junction, a multi-level combination interchange with two flyovers. At this point the freeway narrows and the central concrete barrier ends; a grass median taking its place between the opposing lanes. Immediately north of Highway 407, the freeway interchanges with Highway 7, and due to the close spacing of these two interchanges, the northbound off-ramp to Highway 7 is braided with the on-ramp from Highway 407 (and vice versa with the southbound ramps) to avoid weaving. The freeway passes west of Buttonville Municipal Airport (decommissioned as of November 2023) and then interchanges with 16th Avenue, and the close proximity to the airport&#x27;s runways necessitates that this freeway segment is illuminated by low poles instead of the high mast lighting on the rest of the freeway.

The land-use density continues to drop, with the appearance of some open spaces and farms interspersed with industrial and commercial buildings. By 19th Avenue, just north of the Honda Canada headquarters in Markham, the land-use is agricultural on both sides of Highway 404. Highway 404 continues north, forming the eastern boundary of the municipalities of Richmond Hill, Aurora and Newmarket and the western boundary of Whitchurch-Stouffville. North of Wellington Street, the highway reduces in width to four lanes, which is its configuration north through East Gwillimbury. The route continues, passing east of the community of Queensville, where just a bit north Highway 404 will meet the future Bradford Bypass, as it eventually curves northeast and terminates at an at-grade intersection with Woodbine Avenue immediately south of Ravenshoe Road (York Regional Road 32).

The speed limit is on most of its length, with the exception of the stretch between Newmarket and the north end of the highway, where the speed limit is since it was raised on April 22, 2022.

== History ==

===Early studies===
A freeway east of Highway 11 was planned as early as 1954, when the province extended Highway 48 south from Port Bolster. A large cloverleaf interchange was constructed with the Toronto Bypass, and plans formulated for a dual highway around the east side of Lake Simcoe, connecting with Highway11 near Orillia or Gravenhurst. This route was dropped when Metropolitan Toronto began planning for the northern extension of the DVP in 1957, as subdivisions encroached upon Woodbine Avenue north of Highway401. The six-lane expressway was to follow the alignment of Woodbine from its southern terminus at Lawrence Avenue to north of Steeles Avenue, where the Department of Highways (DHO) would continue the road as a &quot;new King&#x27;s Highway&quot;. 

In 1959, the DHO announced that they would construct and maintain the new route once the DVP was completed to Highway401 and designate it Highway404.
The proposed route of the freeway was presented at a special delegation on December13, 1960 by Harold Barry, a representative of the department. During this time Metro opened another section of the DVP from Lawrence Avenue to Highway 401 on November 17, 1966, followed by the section north of Highway 401 to Sheppard Avenue on March 1, 1967. As completed at that time, after passing Sheppard Avenue the parkway ended and transitioned to the two-lane Woodbine Avenue.

===Construction begins=== 
Design work on Highway404 started in 1973, and construction began following the awarding of a C$6.9million contract in March 1976. This contract included construction of the Finch Avenue interchange, overpasses at McNicoll and Van Horne Avenues and of six-lane freeway between Sheppard and Steeles Avenues.
Shortly thereafter, on April20, Ernest Avenue and Van Horne Avenue were closed to traffic at Woodbine.
The existing Metro-built segment of the DVP between Sheppard and Highway401 was absorbed as part of the new provincial freeway. 

The first section of Highway404 between Highway401 and Steeles Avenue opened in late 1977, including the flyover ramp from southbound Woodbine Avenue.
The freeway was separated by a grass median with a steel box beam acting as a barrier between the lanes. Construction north of Toronto proceeded quickly, with the contract for the section from Steeles to Highway7 being awarded in 1976 and the section opening on November10, 1978.
The next extension, to Stouffville Road (then known as the Gormley Side Road), was opened ceremoniously on December9, 1980 by minister James Snow;
the segment north of Highway7 was four lanes wide.
The section of Highway404 north of Stouffville Road was the subject of considerable controversy when work began to clear the route on May15, 1981 before the completion of an environmental impact assessment. The Ministry of Transportation and Communications was charged with violating the newly enacted Environmental Assessment Act, which it contested came into effect after construction of the extension had begun.
Minister James Snow was charged with violating the act, and called upon to resign. The Minister did not resign, but paid a C$3,500 fine. Despite the issues surrounding it, the extension between Stouffville Road and Bloomington Road was opened ceremoniously on the morning of August10, 1982.

As originally built by Metro, the Sheppard Avenue interchange with the parkway was originally a Parclo AB2, plus Fairview Mall Drive at the time ran only east-west directly north of the shopping centre and also had its own on/off-ramps from the southbound lanes of Highway 404. In the 1980s the province removed the separate sets of Fairview Mall Drive and Sheppard Avenue ramps in favour of an on/off-ramp that fed directly to the shopping centre and an extension of Fairview Mall Drive whose eastbound lanes run south to meet with Sheppard Avenue.

Construction on the segment north of Bloomington to Aurora Sideroad was already in progress by this point. It was opened to traffic in late September 1985. 16th Avenue, which had been widened from two to four lanes during the mid-1980s, received ramps connecting to the freeway south of that existing underpass.

=== Extension to Newmarket===
Construction on the section from Wellington Street to Davis Drive began in early 1986, and the section opened to traffic on October24, 1989 at 8:30am. This final segment cost $22.1million, ending the continuous construction program undertaken since 1973 at a cost of $83.3million.

=== 1997-2007 expansion ===
Studies and environmental assessments into various extensions began almost immediately after the completion of the route to Newmarket in 1989; it would take over a decade for any northward progression to take place. The completion of the route to Davis Drive was met with scorn as traffic in Newmarket rapidly increased as the bedroom community grew with the new highway access. Municipal officials warned prior to the opening of the route that major traffic delays would be faced along Davis Drive. Then-mayor Ray Twinney began an immediate push to widen Green Lane – at that time an unpaved rural route – into a bypass of the town.
Traffic delays were also compounded at the southern end of Toronto, where drivers whom had previously made use of Yonge Street, Bayview Avenue or Leslie Street would shift to make use of the new freeway.

By 1992, York Region was moving forward with plans to expand Green Lane into a four lane road, while the province was urged to consider extending Highway 404 north to it, and eventually around the east side of Lake Simcoe. The province studied this and other options over the following years, before a formal announcement was made by Minister of Transportation Tony Clement on June 22, 1998, along with York Region chairman Bill Fisch. The plan called for an extension of Highway 404 north to Green Lane, and widening of Highway 9, the western extension of Davis Drive (now part of it after being downloaded and redesignated as York Regional Road 31 east of Highway 400) outside town, to five lanes between Highway 400 and Bathurst Street. At the time over 20,000 vehicles used Davis Drive on an average day.
In the interim period, work went into expanding the six lane freeway through Toronto and Markham. A combination interchange was built with the new Highway 407 ETR which opened in June 1997, which as a prerequisite required the realignment of some ramps from the nearby Highway 7 interchange. In early 1998, the MTO announced plans for two contracts to widen Highway 404 south of Highway 7. The first contract converted the grass median into an additional lane in each direction with a central concrete barrier between them, with the inner lanes to eventually be converted into HOV lanes. High-mast lighting was installed in the median barrier, replacing the unique luminaires that were mounted outside of the right shoulder of each carriageway. With the shift in road illumination completed as a prerequisite, the second contract would result in an additional lane in each direction on the outside the existing freeway south of Highway 407, making it ten lanes wide, with expansion of the southbound and northbound lanes completed in 2005 and 2007, respectively. 

In conjunction with the widening to add HOV lanes, improvements were made to the bottlenecked interchange with Highway 401. This involved the construction of a two-lane on-ramp receiving traffic from the eastbound Highway 401 express and collectors that would converge with Highway 404 northbound without access to Sheppard Avenue, while the existing single lane on-ramp for that same movement was retained for Highway 401 collector traffic to exit at Sheppard Avenue. In early 2004, construction began on a new ramp from the Highway 404 southbound HOV lane to the Highway 401 westbound collectors, with the ramp consisting of a curved tunnel beneath the Highway 404&#x27;s southbound general traffic lanes. To accommodate the HOV tunnel ramp, the directional ramp for general traffic from Highway 404 southbound to the Highway 401 westbound collectors was shifted further west with its entry just under the Don Mills Road overpass while also realigned to permit a higher speed. On December 13, 2005, the southbound HOV lane was opened to traffic. This was one of the three original HOV lanes in Ontario; the other two HOV lanes were on Highway 403 in Mississauga.
Work on the northbound HOV lane began shortly thereafter, opening at 8:30 am on Monday, July 23, 2007. As the freeway crosses Highway 7, the southbound HOV lane started as an additional lane while the northbound HOV lane transitioned to a standard through lane as the rightmost general travel lane merged.


In 1999, Highway 404 was widened to six lanes between Highway 7 and Major Mackenzie Drive, using the right-of-way afforded by the grass median. Ramps were added to connect Regional Road 73 (16th Avenue) with the segment of Highway 404 north of that junction, making it a full interchange. On June 19, 2003, Transportation Minister and Oak Ridges MPP Frank Klees opened the new ramps, with Thornhill MPP Tina Molinari also in attendance, with traffic permitted onto the ramp following the ceremony. The MTO formally announced plans to alleviate traffic in Newmarket on August 28, 2000: a three contract project to widen and extend Highway 404. The first contract added an additional lane in each direction in the grass median from Major Mackenzie Drive to Bloomington Road. A second contract then extended those two lanes north to Aurora Sideroad. These two projects both began in the summer of 2001 and were completed in December. The third contract (see below) was an extension from Davis Drive to Green Lane. The MTO formally announced plans to alleviate traffic in Newmarket on August 28, 2000: a three contract project to widen and extend Highway 404. The first contract added an additional lane in each direction in the grass median from Major Mackenzie Drive to Bloomington Road. A second contract then extended those two lanes north to Aurora Sideroad. These two projects both began in the summer of 2001 and were completed in December. The third contract called for a four lane extension from Davis Drive to Green Lane and the reconstruction of Green Lane into a four-laned arterial road between Leslie Street and Woodbine Avenue.
This contract began shortly after the announcement in September 2000. The extension was opened to traffic on February 8, 2002, at a ceremony attended by York North MPP Julia Munro and York Region chairman Bill Fisch. 

=== Extension to Keswick ===
On May 16, 2006, the MTO announced plans to extend Highway 404 by from Green Lane to Ravenshoe Road at the south end of Keswick. The first contracts were awarded later that year for the construction of the northbound bridge over Green Lane,
followed by two structures over Mount Albert Road, west of Woodbine Avenue, begun in late 2008 and completed in 2009.
By April 2011, the extension had been cleared and graded.
Completion was originally scheduled for December 15, 2012, with landscaping work to continue the following spring.
However, due to soil conditions and utility relocation issues, the project was delayed by nearly two years. The C$99 million extension opened on September 17, 2014.

=== Further widening for extension of HOV lanes ===
On December 9, 2016, the MTO announced that the segment between Highway 407 and Stouffville Road would be widened from six to eight lanes with the additional inner lanes to be used as HOV lanes. Much of the work involved paving over the remainder of the grass median and erecting a concrete barrier. A complex part of this project involved the staged replacement of the existing 16th Avenue and Rouge River bridges that have been in service when the freeway opened; the old 16th Avenue underpasses had been widened twice (in 1988 for new ramps, and in 2002 for the freeway expansion) but still only permitted four lanes of an increasingly congested 16th to pass through, while the old Rouge River bridges were originally designed with two freeway lanes each and for the 2002 expansion they were restriped for three lanes by removing the shoulders. A carpool lot was added at Major Mackenzie Drive at the start of the project. Construction north of Major Mackenzie Drive started in 2017 and was completed in 2021, while construction south of Major Mackenzie started in 2019 and was scheduled to be completed by the end of August 2024. The southbound HOV lane south of Stouffville Road opened on September 16, 2024 and the northbound HOV lane opened on September 28, 2024.

== Future ==
Long term proposals by the province call for Highway 404 to be extended to Highway 12, between Sunderland and Beaverton. This extension would follow a new alignment to Port Bolster, east of which the freeway would incorporate the existing two lanes of Highway 48. It has drawn criticism from various environmental groups who claim it will only serve to accelerate urban sprawl north of Toronto.

<text>Denver Collin Dalley is an American singer-songwriter based in Omaha, Nebraska. He is best known for his collaboration with Bright Eyes frontman Conor Oberst in Desaparecidos, and has been involved in various other musical projects, including Statistics, Intramural, and PRESSERS. Denver got married in 2019 and is an expert juggler.

==Career==
===Desaparecidos===
Dalley collaborated with childhood friend Conor Oberst as main songwriter of the politically charged indie rock band Desaparecidos. The band released &quot;Read Music/Speak Spanish&quot; on Omaha-based Saddle Creek Records before going on hiatus in 2003. They reunited in 2010, performing at the Concert for Equality in Omaha on July 31, and again on July 31, 2012 at Omaha&#x27;s Maha Music Festival.

===Statistics===
In 2003, following the temporary caesura of Desaparecidos, Dalley formed Statistics, an electronic-tinged solo project, and signed onto the Jade Tree Records label. After releasing a self-titled extended play in 2003 and two studio albums titled &quot;Leave Your Name&quot; and &quot;Often Lie&quot; in 2004 and 2005, respectively, Dalley chose to focus on other projects, effectively putting Statistics on hiatus. However, in 2013, eight years after &quot;Often Lie&quot;, Dalley released a new studio album titled &quot;Peninsula&quot; on Afternoon Records, featuring a collaboration with Minnesota-based singer-songwriter Sean Tillman (a.k.a. Har Mar Superstar). Dalley hopes to create visuals in the form of music videos for songs in &quot;Peninsula&quot;, something that he has never done in his prior musical ventures.

===Other work===
Dalley formed Intramural and released &quot;This is a Landslide&quot; on October 23, 2008, via Slowdance Records. He has also recorded music with Leta Lucy from The Twilight Singers as part of a project called Two of Cups, which is currently unsigned.

Dalley performs and collaborates frequently with Sean Tillman (a.k.a. Har Mar Superstar) and has appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and Lopez Tonight, playing both guitar and bass guitar in Tillman&#x27;s multiple projects. Dalley also toured as an instrumentalist with The Pink Spiders in the fall of 2008 and The Watson Twins in early 2009.

Dalley has licensed his music to such shows as &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; and &quot;ER&quot;, written music for several national and international commercials, and scored a feature-length documentary called &quot;America&#x27;s Marine Aviators&quot;.

==Characters and story==
The strip was based on Allen&#x27;s comedic persona and focused on his neuroses, angst, sexual frustration and frequent psychiatric treatment.

Writers for the strip included David Weinberger. 

==Collected editions==
A collection of some strips was published in 1978 as &quot; Non-Being and Somethingness: Selections from the Comic Strip Inside Woody Allen&quot; () and features an introduction by Buckminster Fuller.

<doc id="1025774" wikidata="Q903241" url="?curid=1025774" title="Bratslav">
<text>Bratslav (, ; ) is a rural settlement in Ukraine, located in Tulchyn Raion of Vinnytsia Oblast, by the Southern Bug river. It is a medieval European city and a regional center of the Eastern Podolia region (see Bracław Voivodeship) founded by government of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, which dramatically lost its importance during the 19th–20th centuries. Population: 

==Name==
In addition to the Ukrainian (&quot;Bratslav&quot;), in other languages the name of the city is and , &quot;Bratslev&quot;. Today also pronounced Breslev or &quot;Breslov&quot; as the name of a Hasidic group, which originated from this town.

==History==

The first written mention of Bratslav dates back to 1362. City status was granted Magdeburg Rights in 1564. Bratslav belonged to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania until the Lublin Union of 1569, when it became a voivodeship center in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland as part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

In the early 16th century, the Starosta of Bratslav and Vinnytsia (Winnica) was Hetman Kostiantyn Ostrozky, who commanded Polish–Lithuanian army in the Battle of Orsha. Nevertheless, Ostrozky was unable to protect Bratslav and its castle from destruction in 1497, when the town was raided by Crimean Tatars. The castle was rebuilt and reinforced by order of Polish King Alexander I Jagiellon, but it was destroyed once again, in 1551, during a Tatar raid commanded by Khan Devlet I Giray, after which Bratslav turned into a desert.

In 1564, Bratslav was granted Magdeburg rights, and five years later, following the Union of Lublin, it was annexed by the Kingdom of Poland, becoming capital of the Bratslav Voivodeship, which existed for over 200 years. During this time, Bratslav (then named Bracław in Polish) by the authorities, was property of Polish kings, and was ruled by the starostas.

In 1570, a special commission of the Polish Sejm marked boundaries of the Bratslav Voivodeship. In the west, it reached the Dniestr and the Murachwa rivers, in the north it went along the so-called Black Tatar Trail. With top-quality soil, the so-called chernozem, Bracław Voivodeship was the most fertile region of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1589 in Warsaw, the Sejm granted coat of arms to the town: a cross in red field, with blue shield in the middle. In 1598, Polish Parliament decided to move the seat of local courts and sejmiks from Bratslav to Vinnytsia, and as a result, Winnica became a de facto capital of the voivodeship, even though it was still named after Bracław.

On October 5, 1594, Zaporozhian Cossacks under Severyn Nalyvaiko murdered near Bratslav Castle a tabor of the local Polish nobility, who tried to escape the Nalyvaiko Uprising. In 1648, during the Bohdan Khmelnytsky rebellion, Bracław became a Cossack regimental city, part of the Ukrainian Hetman state, which was later assimilated by the Tsardom of Russia. In 1667, under the Treaty of Andrusiv, Russia returned the city to Poland. The city was ruled by the Ottoman Empire between 1672 and 1699, returning then to Poland once more. It became part of the Russian Empire after the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, along with the rest of the formerly Polish Right-bank Ukraine. Under Russia, Bratslav was an &quot;uezd&quot; (district) center in the Podolia Governorate. As the city had no access to a railroad, its importance and population gradually declined.

Bratslav is famous in Judaism as the place where Rabbi Nachman lived and taught between 1802 and 1810. Rabbi Nachman was the founder of one of the major branches of Hasidism, Breslover Hasidism, and an author of Jewish mystical works. After the 1917 revolution Judaism had been strongly persecuted. The history of this persecution is well illustrated by the life of Bratslav rabbi Moishe Yankel Rabinovich who served as a rabbi from 1919 to 1968.

In 1926 Bratslav had a population of 7,842 (Source=Columbia-Lippincott Gazetteer).

During World War II, Bratslav was occupied by German and Romanian armies on July 22, 1941, and was made into a ghetto for Jews of Bratslav and its vicinities. According to Romanian reports, there were 747 Jews in Bratslav in the end of December 1941. On January 1, 1942, most Jews were transferred to an extermination camp, and 50 people were drowned in the South Bug river. Two labor camps for German construction companies Todt-Dorman and Horst und Jessen were opened in August 1942. They hosted about 1,200 Jews deported from Romania, as well as about 300 Ukrainian Jews. The labor schedule was designed to exhaust all prisoners: work in masonry, without days off, from dawn till dusk, with a 30-minute lunch break. On September 23, 1942, all elderly and children were shot in a neighboring forest. The executions continued regularly after that date. In April 1943, Todt-Dorman camp was closed, and the prisoners were transferred to Horst und Jessen. Bratslav was part of Transnistria Governorate in Kingdom of Romania till its liberation on 17 March 1944 by Red Army.

Until 26 January 2024, Bratslav was designated urban-type settlement. On this day, a new law entered into force which abolished this status, and Bratslav became a rural settlement.

<doc id="1025777" wikidata="Q5346903" url="?curid=1025777" title="Edwin Ward Moore">
<text>Edwin Ward Moore (July 15, 1810 – October 5, 1865), was an American naval officer who also served as commander-in-chief of the Navy of the Republic of Texas.

==Early life==
Moore was born in Alexandria, Virginia. His grandfather and uncle had served in the American Revolution. Moore was a classmate of Robert E. Lee&#x27;s at the Alexandria Academy.

==Early naval career==
Moore entered the United States Navy as a midshipman in 1825 at the age of 15.

His first assignment came when he was posted to the USS &quot;Hornet&quot;, followed by stints on the &quot;Fairchild&quot; and the &quot;Delaware&quot;. He saw active service on the Atlantic Coast and the Mediterranean Sea. In 1830, Moore was stationed at the Gosport Navy Yard, and five years later was commissioned a lieutenant and assigned to the sloop-of-war &quot;Boston&quot; on July 1, 1836. While serving on the &quot;Boston&quot;, Moore saved the ship from sinking when it encountered heavy seas in a hurricane.

In September 1836, the &quot;Boston&quot; captured the Texas privateer &quot;Terrible&quot; off the coast of New Orleans. The Texas ship was sent to Pensacola, Florida, on piracy charges. This contact with the Texans is believed to have prompted Moore to re-evaluate his military career. Promotion within the U.S. Navy at this time was a slow process, as many of the officers who served in the War of 1812 still held rank above Moore.

==Moore&#x27;s journey to and with the Republic&#x27;s Navy==
In 1839, Moore was accused of recruiting officers and up to 80 sailors from the &quot;Boston&quot; to join him in enlisting with the Republic of Texas Navy. Moore&#x27;s cousin, Alexander Moore, confirmed this rumor to Commodore Charles Ridgley, who forwarded the charges to the Secretary of the Navy. On July 8, 1839, Moore resigned from the U.S. Navy to become commander of the Republic of Texas Navy.

U.S. Secretary of the Navy, John Forsyth, tried to bring charges against Moore based on his violation of the Neutrality Act of 1819, but Moore resigned his commission before any trial was held.

From 1840–1841, he sailed off the Mexican coast to hasten peace negotiations between the Republic of Texas and Mexico. On collapse of the negotiations, Moore returned to Texas and to the support of Texas President Mirabeau B. Lamar. Lamar signed a treaty with the Mexican state of Yucatán for the lease the Texas navy for $8,000 per month and to protect their ports from being blockaded by the Mexican Navy. On September 18, 1840, Moore received orders to guard the Yucatán coast in conformity with the Texas-Yucatán Treaty and on December 13, 1840, left Galveston, Texas, with three ships to join the small Yucatán fleet at Sisal, Yucatán, under the command of former Texas Navy officer Captain James D. Boylan. Moore later captured the town of San Juan Bautista, Tabasco, and then surveyed the Texas coast. His chart was later published by the British Admiralty.

===Invasion of Tabasco===

In September 1840, Moore invaded the Mexican state of Tabasco in support to the Tabasco federalist forces, collaborating in the overthrow of the centralist governor José Ignacio Gutierrez, capturing the state capital San Juan Bautista on November 17, 1840.

Subsequently, and due to a disagreement with the new federalist government, for the lack of a payment of $25,000 Mexican pesos promised to Moore, on December 14, 1840, he bombarded the capital again, until he reached a new agreement with the government of Tabasco for the payment of the debt.

==President Sam Houston==
Upon becoming President of the Republic of Texas, Sam Houston suspended the treaty with the Yucatán and ordered the fleet to return to Texas. Houston was not a big supporter of the Texas Navy. When funds for naval repairs, approved by the Texas Congress, were withheld by Houston, Moore reinstated the treaty with the Yucatán in defiance of Houston&#x27;s orders. Moore and two other Texas ships, along with a few from the Yucatán navy, engaged the Mexican fleet in May 1843 in the Battle of Campeche. Mexico&#x27;s naval fleet consisted of the British-built ironclad steam-powered warship the &quot;Guadalupe&quot; and was the most advanced fleet ever assembled in the Gulf of Mexico at that time. Their battle was determined a draw, though Mexico suffered high casualties. The Mexican government even coined a medal of bravery for their sailors. Mexican Commodore Francisco de Paula Lopez, a naval veteran, was recalled for his failure to defeat a smaller and out-gunned force, and was court-martialed.

==End of career==
On January 16, 1843, the Texas Congress ordered the sale of the Texas fleet. On June 1, 1843, Moore and the fleet had received Houston&#x27;s proclamation accusing them of disobedience and piracy and suspending Moore from the Texas Navy. Houston even went so far as to ask for any friendly nation to capture and execute the Texas fleet. Moore returned to Galveston on July 14, and turned himself in at the port of Menard&#x27;s Wharf, a hero to the people of Texas, and demanded a trial.

According to later newspaper reports he was charged by the Texas government with disobeying orders and treason (in support of the Yucatan polity), and discharged from the Texas Navy on March 21, 1843, which then led to piracy, and the hanging by Moore from the yardarm four sailors, Antonio Landois, James Hudgins, Isaac Allen, and William Simpson, which the Texians deemed murder.

==Later years==
After the dissolution of the Texas Navy, Moore spent many years in prosecuting financial claims against Texas. In 1844, the Texas House of Representatives concluded that Moore was owed $26,510.41. He was paid, in installments, with the last payment coming in 1856. Moore married Emma Matilda Stockton Cox of Philadelphia in 1849. She was a distant cousin of Commodore Robert Stockton.

In 1850, Moore and other officers petitioned the U.S. Navy to recognize their rank as officers with the Texas Navy. The House Naval Affairs Committee supported their claim, but the United States Supreme Court did not agree, holding that when Texas joined the Union, only property, and not human beings, belonged to the United States. On March 3, 1857, Congress finally closed the books on Moore and the other officers by granting them five years of back pay at the salaries of corresponding U.S. Navy officers.

He was in New York City for a time attempting to perfect a machine to revolutionize marine engineering. His quarrel with Sam Houston over the justice of his suspension from the navy continued during Houston&#x27;s term as U.S. Senator.

In 1860, Moore returned to Galveston, where he built the Galveston Customhouse. Moore died in New York City on October 5, 1865, of apoplexy.

<text>The Jonha Falls (also called Gautamdhara Falls) is a waterfall located in Ranchi district in the Indian state of Jharkhand. 

==Geography==
===Location===
Jonha Falls is located at 

==The falls==

Situated at an edge of the Ranchi plateau, the Jonha Falls is an example of a hanging valley falls. The Gunga River hangs over its master stream, Radu River and forms the falls.
One has to descend 722 steps to admire the surroundings. Water in the falls drops from a height of .

The Jonha Falls is an example of a nick point caused by rejuvenation. Knick point, also called a nick point or simply nick, represents breaks in slopes in the longitudinal profile of a river caused by rejuvenation. The break in channel gradient allows water to fall vertically giving rise to a waterfall.

==Culture==
There is a tourist rest house which encloses a Buddhist shrine with a deity of Lord Gautama Buddha. A temple and an ashram dedicated to Buddha was built atop Gautam Pahar by the sons of Baldeo Das Birla. A fair is organized in Jonha every Tuesday and Saturday.

Many remains of Buddhism are present in Jonha Falls, situated on Gautam Hill, 38 km away from the capital Ranchi. There is an ancient temple of Lord Gautam Buddha on the hill of Jonha Falls. This temple was built hundreds of years ago by Raja Baldev Das Birla.

==Transport==
The Jonha Falls is from Ranchi. It is approachable by both road and train. Jonha Station is just 1.5 km from the fall. For travel by road, one has to take the Ranchi-Purulia Road and after travelling for about one has to travel about off the main road.

<doc id="1025788" wikidata="Q741892" url="?curid=1025788" title="Patrick Henry College">
<text>Patrick Henry College (PHC) is a private liberal arts non-denominational conservative Protestant Christian college located in Purcellville, Virginia. Its departments teach classical liberal arts, government, strategic intelligence in national security, economics and business analytics, history, journalism, environmental science and stewardship, and literature. The university has full accreditation from the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS-COC) as of 2022. Patrick Henry College continues to be accredited by the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS), which is also recognized as an institutional accreditor by the United States Department of Education. Its graduation rate is 67%.

==History==
Patrick Henry College was incorporated in 1998 by Michael Farris, who is also the founder and chairman of the board of the Home School Legal Defense Association, with which PHC is still closely connected. It officially opened September 20, 2000, with a class of 92 students. The college eschews federal financial aid and is therefore relieved from United States Department of Education requirements on demographic makeup and other quotas. The school does not ask about race or ethnicity on applications.

PHC receives all of its funding from tuition fees and donations. The college states that it does not accept any money from sources that seek to supersede the authority of its Board of Trustees or conflict with its foundational statements. PHC adds new facilities and programs only as funds are available.

PHC is a member of the advisory board of Project 2025, a collection of conservative and right-wing policy proposals from the Heritage Foundation to reshape the United States federal government and consolidate executive power should the Republican nominee win the 2024 presidential election.

===Accreditation===
Patrick Henry College received accreditation in 2007 from the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools, a national accrediting organization for Christian colleges, universities, and seminaries created by the Institute for Creation Research. In June 2021, the college received Candidacy status from The Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS-COC). As of June 2022, the school is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The college was denied accreditation by the American Academy for Liberal Education in 2002 because creationism was part of the curriculum. On June 30, 2005, the school was officially recognized by the United States Department of Education (ED) as an institution eligible for ED programs. It also allowed students to use more scholarships and grants and made donors and students eligible for various tax benefits. In 2012, the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools reaffirmed Patrick Henry College&#x27;s accreditation for a period of ten years.

==Religious affirmations==
Students must sign a &quot;Statement of Faith&quot; before they enroll, affirming belief in what the college considers core Christian doctrines. For example, students are asked to acknowledge &quot;Satan exists as a personal, malevolent being who acts as tempter and accuser, for whom Hell, the place of eternal punishment, was prepared, where all who die outside of Christ shall be confined in conscious torment for eternity. [...] Man is by nature sinful and is inherently in need of salvation, which is exclusively found by faith alone in Jesus Christ and His shed blood. [...] Christ&#x27;s death provides substitutionary atonement for our sins.&quot; The college professes non-denominational Christian beliefs, informed by Evangelical Protestantism.

Teaching faculty must also sign the Statement of Faith and a more detailed Statement of Biblical Worldview, which represents the college&#x27;s requirements for what should be taught. For example, the &quot;Biblical Worldview Applications&quot; states, &quot;Any biology, Bible, or other courses at PHC dealing with creation will teach creation from the understanding of Scripture that God&#x27;s creative work, as described in Genesis 1:1–31, was completed in six twenty-four-hour days.&quot;

In 2006, PHC founder Farris commented that the college held the view that its faith was the only true faith (&quot;we believe that there is truth and there is error&quot;) and expressed disapproval of religious and social toleration. &quot;Tolerance cannot coexist with liberty&quot; because &quot;the crowd of tolerance wants to ban speech.&quot;

PHC does not receive federal funding: &quot;In order to safeguard our distinctly Christian worldview, we do not accept or participate in government funding.&quot; In consequence, PHC is not required to follow federal guidelines, like most other institutions, concerning sex-based and other forms of discrimination.

==Campus==
Patrick Henry College is located in the town of Purcellville in rural northern Virginia, approximately northwest of Washington, D.C. The campus currently consists of seven buildings arranged around a retention pond popularly called &quot;Lake Bob&quot;, as well as several athletic fields. The oldest structure, Founders Hall, opened in 2000 and contains three classrooms, the college library, and various administrative and faculty offices. It is also home to the offices of the Home School Legal Defense Association. Hanna Rosin, author of &quot;God&#x27;s Harvard&quot;, described the campus as &quot;tiny, less like an Ivy League college than like a Hollywood set of an old Ivy League school.&quot; The buildings are of Colonial Revival architecture. The artwork in Founders Hall consists of copies of portraits of the Founding Fathers placed along a staircase, leading to a picture of Patrick Henry at the second Virginia convention which features a light from heaven guiding Henry&#x27;s speech. The artwork is designed to, in the words of Hanna Rosin, &quot;remind the students that America was founded as a Christian nation.&quot;

The school&#x27;s residential village is composed of six residence halls located along the edges of the lake. There are three men&#x27;s and three women&#x27;s dormitories. The four smaller dormitories opened in 2001, while Red Hill, a male dormitory, was opened in 2003. The school&#x27;s sixth dormitory, Shiloh, opened in 2024 and is a women&#x27;s dormitory. When Shiloh opened, the school changed the Montpelier dormitory from a women&#x27;s dormitory to a men&#x27;s dormitory. Located in the basement of Mount Vernon is an auditorium referred to as Town Hall, where the school&#x27;s daily chapel sessions and other special events are held. The residence halls are set up in an arc shape around the lake.

===Barbara Hodel Student Center===

In August 2009 the college opened a student life center, which significantly expanded dining, classroom, recreational, and athletic facilities. Approximately 1,000 people attended the dedication ceremony featuring evangelical leader James Dobson of Focus on the Family as keynote speaker.

==Governance==
The college&#x27;s founder, Mike Farris, announced his resignation as president of the college on March 6, 2006, to become chancellor. Graham Walker served as the second president of the college from 2006 to 2014. The editor of &quot;World&quot;, Gene Edward Veith, served as Interim President.

Jack Haye was made third President of Patrick Henry College in 2015. He was a banker for thirty years.

==Academics==
Students at the college can choose their major from within seven fields of study. The Government Department offers majors in Government, Journalism, Economics &amp; Business Analytics, and Strategic Intelligence in National Security. The Government major provides an option to specialize in American Politics and Policy, International Politics and Policy, Political Theory, Strategic Intelligence, or a General Government track. The Classical Liberal Arts Department offer degrees in Classical Liberal Arts, History, and Literature and Minors in Biblical Studies, Classics, History, Journalism, Music, and Philosophy.

On January 24, 2007, the school successfully completed an on-site review by a TRACS assessment team, and was granted full accreditation in April.

===Faculty===
In 2024, PHC&#x27;s website listed twenty full-time professors, of which eighteen held terminal degrees in their field. As of 2023, PHC also listed twenty-seven part-time faculty, all of whom have received a master&#x27;s degree or higher. Chancellor Emeritus Mike Farris has a J.D., has authored several novels and critiques of constitutional law, and has argued numerous cases before federal and state high courts, as well as the United States Supreme Court. In addition to serving as Chancellor Emeritus of Patrick Henry College, he is also chairman and General Counsel of the Home School Legal Defense Association. From 2017 through 2022, he was CEO and general counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom.

====2006 academic freedom dispute====
In 2005, a library clerk was asked to resign for promoting the idea that baptism is essential for salvation, considered a violation of the Statement of Faith. Further, in March 2006, five of the college&#x27;s sixteen faculty members—Erik Root, Robert Stacey, Kevin Culberson, Todd Bates, and David Noe—resigned in protest, saying that the president&#x27;s interpretation of the Biblical Worldview Policy conflicted with their views on academic freedom.

The resignations led to a discussion about the practical implementation of a strong liberal arts education along with conservative biblical beliefs and what a balanced discussion between the two might look like. David C. Noe, an assistant professor of Classics at PHC, departed after disagreements on how non-Christian authors should be viewed and valued when compared to Biblical texts. He found PHC&#x27;s application of its statement of faith incompatible with his personal view of Christianity.

===Forensics===

====Moot court====
Since 2001, PHC&#x27;s moot court program has reached the final round in 18 out of 22 years and won 12 times in the American Moot Court Association National Competition. In 2016, the team won the Nelson Mandela World Human Rights Moot Court Competition. Until 2022, the program held the number one position in the American Moot Court Association&#x27;s official rankings. While the program did not reach the final round in 2021 and 2022 (ceding its top ranking to the University of Chicago), in 2023 it reclaimed its top ranking.

In 2019, Dean of Academic Affairs, Pre-Law Advisory, and the college&#x27;s Moot Court and Mock Trial coach, Frank Guliuzza, died after coaching the Moot Court team through 8 of its 11 championship titles.

====Mock Trial====
PHC fields a mock trial team in the American Mock Trial Association. In the 2021-2022 season, PHC advanced two teams to the National Championship Tournament. PHC A came 4th place in its division, while PHC B earned an Honorable Mention as the 11th place in its division. As of the 2022-2023 season, PHC is the only college in the nation to have two teams within the top 20 teams in AMTA&#x27;s Team Power Rankings, with PHC A at #6 and PHC B at #16, respectively. This is a repeat achievement by PHC has repeated this feat; in the prior 2021-2022 season, PHC A sat at #3, with PHC B at #20.

In 2022, PHC graduate Benjamin Crosby won the UCLA Law &amp; Drexel Law&#x27;s Trial By Combat competition, a one-on-one competition hosted for outstanding competitors in AMTA. With his victory, PHC became the fifth school to field a Trial by Combat champion, along with NYU, the University of Cincinnati, Duke University, and the University of California, Los Angeles.

====Civic Debate====
In 2021, 52 students represented PHC in civic debate, nearly two-thirds of them being freshmen or sophomores. PHC participated in a mix of virtual and in-person events. At the 2021 Lafayette Debates National Championship hosted jointly by George Washington University and France&#x27;s École de guerre-Terre, PHC students won 1st and 2nd place. In the spring 2022 NATO Summit, which included masters&#x27; level students and undergraduates, PHC students achieved 2nd through 5th places. At the General Welfare debates, PHC students achieved 1st through 3rd place. These resulted in possible internship offers to several students from the distinguished event judges. Recently, PHC students outperformed Ivy League universities, including Harvard and Yale, to win the European Union Delegation&#x27;s 2023 Schuman Challenge.

====Pre-Law Advising====
PHC&#x27;s LSAT scores rank among the best in the United States. In both 2019 and 2020, PHC students (including both alumni and current students) earned an average of 167.6 on the Law School Admission Test. In 2021, graduating seniors averaged 171, and all PHC students taking the LSAT (including alumni) averaged 170.6. These results are in the 98th percentile.

==Student life==
Students may not have sex outside of marriage, or use alcohol or tobacco while under the authority of the college, which is defined as any time during a semester while enrolled, on or off campus. Men and women are not allowed in each other&#x27;s dorm rooms except during open dorm days, and underclassmen are subject to a curfew. Firearms are prohibited on campus.

In the 2000s, Hanna Rosin, author of &quot;God&#x27;s Harvard&quot;, said that &quot;never would you find a group of better-behaved teenagers than on the campus of Patrick Henry.&quot;

===Civic involvement===
Students are involved in the community, and PHC requires its Government students to fulfill up to 24 credits of apprenticeship projects, which include internships, research and writing projects, and extracurricular activities such as moot court, Model United Nations, and Mock Trial. Students currently serve as interns in a wide variety of political organizations, such as the White House, a variety of government agencies, congressional offices and think-tanks. Students are active in local and national politics, often working with local political action groups to lobby for conservative issues at the federal and state levels. Classes are canceled the day of the national elections and the day before, so that students may volunteer on political campaigns; and many students act as Student Action Team leaders for Generation Joshua, leading groups of usually homeschooled high school students volunteering on campaigns across the United States.

===Athletics===
Patrick Henry College competes as the Sentinels, fielding teams in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s intercollegiate soccer and basketball, and is a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA).

===Sexual assault controversy===
Several female students and alumni have accused the college administration of blaming them for sexual assaults that occurred during their enrollment at Patrick Henry College. In 2020, PHC dropout and U.S. Representative Madison Cawthorn was accused by over 150 college alumni of engaging in &quot;sexually predatory behavior&quot; toward fellow students during his time on campus.

===LGBT discrimination===
On April 12, 2007, LGBT rights group Soulforce selected PHC as one of the targets of its annual &quot;Equality Ride&quot; to protest the stance of conservative Christian colleges concerning homosexuality. Patrick Henry College officials did not allow Soulforce to enter the university premises but did suggest that student representatives engage in a formal debate at a neutral location on the merits of the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment to the US Constitution. Soulforce organizers declined this suggestion and notified the college of their intent to enter the campus. After being refused entry, Soulforce protesters formed a picket line outside of the campus entrance and protested for approximately five hours.

<doc id="1025794" wikidata="Q17098969" url="?curid=1025794" title="Minimum degree algorithm">
<text>In numerical analysis, the minimum degree algorithm is an algorithm used to permute the rows and columns of a symmetric sparse matrix before applying the Cholesky decomposition, to reduce the number of non-zeros in the Cholesky factor.
This results in reduced storage requirements and means that the Cholesky factor can be applied with fewer arithmetic operations. (Sometimes it may also pertain to an incomplete Cholesky factor used as a preconditioner—for example, in the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm.)

Minimum degree algorithms are often used in the finite element method where the reordering of nodes can be carried out depending only on the topology of the mesh, rather than on the coefficients in the partial differential equation, resulting in efficiency savings when the same mesh is used for a variety of coefficient values.

Given a linear system
:formula_1
where A is an formula_2 real symmetric sparse square matrix. The Cholesky factor L will typically suffer &#x27;fill in&#x27;, that is have more non-zeros than the upper triangle of A. We seek a permutation matrix P, so that the matrix
formula_3, which is also symmetric, has the least possible fill in its Cholesky factor. We solve the reordered system
:formula_4
The problem of finding the best ordering is an NP-complete problem and is thus intractable, so heuristic methods are used instead. The minimum degree algorithm is derived from a method first proposed by Markowitz in 1959 for non-symmetric linear programming problems, which is loosely described as follows. At each step in Gaussian elimination row and column permutations are performed so as to minimize the number of off diagonal non-zeros in the pivot row and column. A symmetric version
of Markowitz method was described by Tinney and Walker in 1967 and Rose later derived a graph theoretic version of the algorithm where the factorization is only simulated, and this was named the minimum degree algorithm. The graph referred to is the graph with &quot;n&quot; vertices, with vertices &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; connected by an edge when formula_5, and the &quot;degree&quot; is the degree of the vertices. A crucial aspect of such algorithms is a tie breaking strategy when there is a choice of renumbering resulting in the same degree.

A version of the minimum degree algorithm was implemented in the MATLAB function symmmd (where MMD stands for multiple minimum degree), but has now been superseded by a symmetric approximate multiple minimum degree function symamd, which is faster. This is confirmed by theoretical analysis, which shows that for graphs with &quot;n&quot; vertices and &quot;m&quot; edges, MMD has a tight upper bound of formula_6 on its running time, whereas for AMD a tight bound of formula_7 holds. Cummings, Fahrbach, and Fatehpuria designed an exact minimum degree algorithm with formula_7 running time, and showed that no such algorithm can exist that runs in time formula_9, for any formula_10, assuming the strong exponential time hypothesis.

<text>The Borough of Chaguanas is the largest municipality (83,489 at the 2011 census) and fastest-growing town in Trinidad and Tobago. Located in west-central Trinidad, south of Port of Spain, north of Couva and San Fernando, and named after the indigenous tribe who originally settled there, it grew in size due to its proximity to the Woodford Lodge sugar refinery. It remained a minor town until the 1980s when it began to grow rapidly as it drew people for its bargain shopping and moderately priced housing. Its rapid growth has seen property values increase dramatically, however.

Chaguanas became a borough in 1990; prior to that, it was part of Caroni County. The current mayor is Faaiq Mohammed, and the Borough Council has historically been dominated by the United National Congress. Chaguanas has also been a hub for Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian culture and even the broader Indo-Caribbean culture.

==History==
Chaguanas was named for the Chaguanes Amerindian tribe. The area was settled by the time of the British conquest of Trinidad in 1797 (see &quot;History of Trinidad and Tobago&quot;). The town originated on what was then H.E. Robinson&#x27;s sugar estate adjacent to the Woodford Lodge sugar refinery and the De Verteuil coconut and cocoa estate to the north and east. In its early days the inhabitants, most of them of Indian descent, called the town Chauhan, after the Chauhan Dynasty of India from medieval times. The estate was sold over to the now defunct Caroni (1975) Ltd when sugar was the main export commodity for Trinidad and Tobago, and was part of the Woodford Lodge Estate, which is home to several buildings, including the homes of several ex-Caroni workers. Construction of the Trinidad Government Railway helped the town grow.

The Princess Margaret Highway, built by the Naval Base Trinidad military during World War II, joined the Southern Main Road at Chaguanas. Construction of the Sir Solomon Hochoy Highway extended the highway south to San Fernando. The Carlsen Air Force Base was a former United States Army Air Forces World War II airbase constructed in Carlsen Field in 1942, consisting of two landing strips, &quot;Edinburgh&quot; and &quot;Xerxes&quot;. The airbase also included an emergency landing strip, &quot;Tobago&quot;. Edinburgh Field became the principal combat base for USAAF bombers and Naval airships on Trinidad as well as Navy fighters with a complex of runways and taxiways that surpassed even Waller Field. This lasted until 3 November 1943 when, it was renamed Carlsen Field. It was also used by the Royal Air Force and was defended by US Army infantry and AA units. When the Navy began lighter-than-air operations in the Caribbean in the fall of 1943, the 80th Seabees were brought in to build a station at Carlsen Field. To supplement the eight Army-owned buildings taken over by the Navy, the 80th Battalion built a large, steel blimp hangar, a mooring circle, paved runways, a helium-purification plant, and other operational appurtenances. The facility was formally disestablished on 1950, and today the former air and naval airship base has been turned into a dairy and agricultural area south of Chaguanas and is all but unrecognisable. Much of the former airfield area is owned by National Flour Mills (NFM) and the only remnants of the base are the name of the area in south Chaguanas, along with streets named &quot;Edinburgh&quot; and &quot;Xerxes&quot;.

In the later 20th century Chaguanas grew rapidly as a bazaar town. The construction of Lange Park in the early 1980s attracted a middle-class community moving south from Port of Spain and the East–West Corridor and north from San Fernando. Its central location made it attractive to southerners working in north Trinidad and northerners looking for more affordable homes. Over the years, there has been an increase in the number of Afro-Trinidadian persons joining the mostly Indo-Trinidadian community of Chaguanas, primarily through the construction of National Housing Authority (now the Housing Development Corporation) residential housing, such as Edinburgh 500. Orchard Gardens was constructed as an upper middle class community, and Lange Park (which originally and continues to have a number of civil servants) gradually gentrified.

Also, despite Couva&#x27;s historical legacy within the Caroni County, as Chaguanas has evolved and expanded significantly to become the de facto administrative and commercial capital of Central Trinidad, Couva&#x27;s character has now changed to become a magnet for industrialisation, sports, health, education, commercial, aviation and residential activities.

In October 1990 Chaguanas was elevated to the status of borough under the provisions of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1990.

==Geography==
Chaguanas is low-lying and is just upstream from the Caroni Swamp. The Caparo River runs through the town. The Chaguanas Main Road runs East to West from Felicity to Longdenville. The Southern Main Road (SMR) from Busy Corner (part of which includes the Chaguanas Main Road from Busy Corner to Montrose Junction) runs south to San Fernando. The North-South Highways begins and ends at the flyover in Chaguanas, just east of the SMR West of the SMR, Perseverance Road continues south from Railway Road onto Orange Field Road.

===Climate===
Chaguanas has a lowland seasonal tropical climate with a wet season lasting from June to November and a dry season lasting from January to May. Unlike Port of Spain, Chaguanas has a usually hot and sweltering climate year round, with an exception for the wet season.

===Urban structure===
Chaguanas is bounded to the north by Munroe Road, to the east by the Gandia River, to the south by the Honda River and to the west by the Gulf of Paria.

The town is bisected by the Sir Solomon Hochoy Highway and Uriah Butler Highway.

Chaguanas consists of the following main population centres:

* Downtown Chaguanas – the original core town of Chaguanas and modern central business district; lies west of the Solomon Hochoy Highway.
* Montrose – primarily commercial district east of the Solomon Hochoy Highway.
* Edinburgh 500 and other related developments – south of Montrose.
* Edinburgh Village – south of downtown Chaguanas Area. There are two villages between downtown Chaguanas and Bagna Trace/Carlsen Field triangle roundabout on the Southern Main Rd. – Edinburgh Village and Chase Village. Boundary is defined by the Caparo River south-to-river just south of Chandernagore Rd, Chase Village continues further south to triangle and onwards. Edinburgh Village contains housing areas Edinburgh Gardens Phases 1, 2, and 3.
* Lange Park – north of Montrose and south of Endeavour, east of Orchard Gardens and the Uriah Butler Highway.

==Governance==
The Chaguanas Borough Corporation (CBC) is a local government authority and was incorporated on 13 September 1990 by Municipal Corporation Act 21 of 1990. The CBC is governed by the Act 21 of 1990 of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. In 2013, the Chaguanas Borough Corporation moved into its new administrative building situated in Success Street, Woodforde Lodge.

Chaguanas Borough Council has eight electoral district councillors and four aldermen selected through a proportional representation methodology. The mayor and deputy mayor are then selected. The electoral districts are: Felicity/Endeavour; Enterprise South; Edinburgh/Longdenville; Enterprise North; Charlieville; Montrose; Monroe Road/Caroni Savannah Road; and Cunupia.

Chaguanas comprises (wholly or in part) the following parliamentary electoral districts: Chaguanas West; Chaguanas East, Couva North, Caroni Central, and Caroni East.

==Economy==

Chaguanas developed as a market town and still attracts bargain shoppers. Much of Chaguanas&#x27; development has centred around the Chaguanas Main Road where numerous shopping plazas have been constructed. The Chaguanas Main Road (east of the Chaguanas flyover) continued to develop, primarily through small and medium size businesses, to fulfill the expanding population centres.

Retail development expanded with the construction of three malls in the downtown in the 1980s (Centre City, Mid Centre and Ramsaran Plaza, later to become Centre Pointe Mall). Centre City Mall has been significantly renovated and there are future plans to expand further to become the largest mall in the Caribbean. It will feature two major buildings, one near to the Uriah Butler Highway and another close to the centre of Chaguanas, joined by an enclosed walkover above the Mulchan Seuchan Link Road.

More recently, construction of Price Plaza in Endeavour expanded upscale retail opportunities. Price Plaza includes a warehouse-style stores, restaurants, a food court as well as many other retail outlets.

ABEL or Alstons Building Enterprises Limited is a member of the ANSA McAl Group of Companies and is situated in Longdenville. It is the largest manufacturer of clay building blocks and Metpro steel and aluminium windows and doors and Astralite and Spectra uPVC windows and doors in the English-speaking Caribbean.

Chaguanas has also developed into a financial centre. The Unit Trust Corporation (UTC), First Citizens Bank (FCB), Sagicor, Republic Bank of Trinidad and Tobago, Scotiabank, RBTT, and the Bank of Baroda all have major corporate offices in Chaguanas.

The dissolution of the state-owned sugar company, Caroni (1975) Limited, had a profound effect on Chaguanas, since this company was a major employer.

==Demographics==
Chaguanas has grown rapidly from a small village to the largest borough in Trinidad and Tobago. Chaguanas has historically been considered an Indo-Trinidadian city through its original villages (such as Edinburgh village, Felicity, Charlieville, Chandernagore, Chase Village, St. Thomas, Montrose, and Endeavour), but as it has grown it has become more multi-racial. Enterprise is a historically Afro-Trinidadian village that has been absorbed into the growing city of Chaguanas. Also, Edinburgh 500 and other associated governmental housing developments are also largely Afro-Trinidadian.

==Culture and entertainment==
===Scenery/attractions===
The Lion House also known as Anand Bhavan, is the ancestral home of the Capildeo family and is the birthplace of Nobel Prize–winning author V.S. Naipaul is located in Chaguanas. This is generally assumed to be the model for Hanuman House in Naipaul&#x27;s &quot;A House for Mr Biswas&quot;, with Chaguanas as the model for Arwacas.

The Caroni Swamp, the largest mangrove wetland in Trinidad and Tobago, is located just north and west of the town. The swamp is a popular tourist attraction and roosting ground for the scarlet ibis, national bird of Trinidad and Tobago.

The Divali Nagar site, located in northern Chaguanas, is a major attraction in the period just before Diwali. The village of Felicity, on the western end of Chaguanas, is famous for its elaborate Diwali celebrations.

===Media===
The Trinidad Publishing Company (TTSE: TPCL), the country&#x27;s oldest and most established publisher of the Trinidad Guardian newspaper, constructed its printing facility for the Newspaper division of Trinidad Publishing Company Limited, of the ANSA McAL Group&#x27;s Media Sector, in the vicinity of Chaguanas flyover.

HCU Communications Limited (now defunct) was based in Chaguanas. It operated a radio station (Win Radio 101.1 FM), was home of television station (WIN TV) From early 2007, it also published three weekly newspapers, &quot;The Probe&quot;, &quot;Uhuru&quot; and &quot;Bollywood Today&quot;.

===Entertainment===
The town includes numerous malls (such as Price Plaza, Xtra Plaza, Mid Centre Mall &amp; Centre Pointe Mall) and associated restaurants and bars. Also, a number of areas in Chaguanas are now quickly developing into entertainment areas, such as Rodney Road, Endeavour with The Rise, Law 5, Double R, and others.

==Infrastructure==
===Health===
The Chaguanas District Hospital is located in Montrose Chaguanas (along the Southern Main Road). Inclusive of the district health facility, a private hospital (Medical Associates) situated in the vicinity of the Chaguanas flyover was opened in 2012. Other small privately run health facilities are located throughout Chaguanas and its environs.

The Caroni County Medical Officers of Health (CMOH), of which Chaguanas falls under, is situated on the Southern Main Road in Couva. The CMOH are responsible for insect-vector control and septic leakage complaints.

===Education===
The Borough is host to many prominent primary and secondary schools. Notable primary schools include Montrose Vedic in Downtown Chaguanas, and Montrose Government in Lange Park.

The Presentation College, Chaguanas is a Roman Catholic secondary school in Chaguanas and is the brother school of Presentation College, San Fernando. It was regarded the best performing high school in Trinidad and Tobago throughout its history, and in particular within its recent history being awarded the country&#x27;s President&#x27;s medal for best performing student multiple times (5 times in a row).

The University of the West Indies (UWI) Esmond D Ramesar Open Campus will be constructed along the Narsaloo Ramaya Road in Chaguanas.

===Transport===
Chaguanas is an important transportation hub. Buses, taxis and maxi-taxis connect Chaguanas with Port of Spain, San Fernando, Curepe and Couva, and smaller settlements around central Trinidad.

Given the town&#x27;s origin as a village and its generally unplanned rapid growth into the country&#x27;s largest town (by population), Chaguanas is continuously plagued by traffic problems despite numerous attempts of alternative traffic management schemes. This traffic congestion is now considered as a threat to future growth of the Borough.

===Sports===
The main sporting venue in Chaguanas is the Central Regional Indoor Sport Arena Hall at Saith Park. Smaller recreation grounds (e.g. Woodforde Lodge, Avinash Samaroo ground) and cricket pitches (Pierre Road) are scattered throughout the borough, but no larger sporting venues are located within the town. The town leverages the infrastructure from other towns such as Couva&#x27;s Ato Boldon Stadium or Sevilla golf course, also located in Couva.

===Utilities===
Electric generation is handled by Powergen, while electrical distribution is handled by the Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission (T&amp;TEC). Chaguanas does not contain its own power generation facilities.

Water and sewerage are under the purview of the Water and Sewerage Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (WASA).

The town is served by all major telecommunication (including cable, satellite) companies, e.g. TSTT, Flow, DirectTV, Digicel+ and Greendot.

<doc id="1025802" wikidata="Q260824" url="?curid=1025802" title="The Physicists">
<text>The Physicists () is a German satiric drama/tragic comedy written in 1961 by Swiss writer Friedrich Dürrenmatt. The play was mainly written as a result of the Second World War and many advances in science and nuclear technology. The play deals with questions of scientific ethics and humanity&#x27;s general ability to manage its intellectual responsibility. It is often recognized as his most impressive yet most easily understood work.

The play was first performed in Zürich in 1962 and published the same year by the publisher Die Arche. It was translated into English by James Kirkup, and first published in the US in 1964 by Grove Press, under its Evergreen imprint.

== Synopsis ==
The story is set in the drawing room of the German sanatorium &quot;Les Cerisiers&quot;, which is a noble psychiatric home for the mentally ill, run by a doctor and psychologist, Fräulein Doktor Mathilde von Zahnd. The main room, where the play is set, is connected to three other rooms, each of which is inhabited by a patient. These three men, who are all physicists by trade, are permitted use of the drawing room, where they are monitored and checked on by the female nurses. Herbert Georg Beutler is the first patient, and he is convinced that he is Sir Isaac Newton. The second patient is Ernst Heinrich Ernesti, who believes himself to be Albert Einstein. The third patient is Johann Wilhelm Möbius, and he believes that he is regularly visited by the biblical King Solomon.

Once the play begins, it is revealed to the audience that &quot;Einstein&quot; has just killed one of his nurses, and the police are examining the scene. The inspector Richard Voß continuously questions the doctor and indirectly insults the &quot;mentally ill&quot; patients. It is revealed through their discussion that this is the second murder of a nurse by one of the three patients in just three months, the first having been committed by &quot;Newton&quot;.

The motives behind the three murders become clearer as the play advances into the second act, where it is revealed with startling abruptness that not even one of the three patients is actually mad; they are all only faking insanity for various reasons.

On orders of the state attorney, the inspector convinces the doctor to exchange the remaining female nurses with male caretakers. After the inspector leaves, Möbius is visited by his former wife Lina and his three sons, and Lina&#x27;s new husband, the missionary Oskar Rose. Missionary Rose got a position at the Mariana Islands and Lina and the boys are visiting Möbius to say their final goodbye. Möbius tries to persuade his youngest son to not too become a physicist and seemingly falls into a maniacal trance-like monologue and chases them off.

After the visitors leave, the nurse Monika Stettler talks with Möbius. During their conversation she tells him that she loves him and that she believes in his conversations with Salomon, or atleast his scientific theories and manuscripts, and tries to convince him to leave the institution with her and become a scientist again. Möbius subsequently strangles her to death.

At the beginning of the play&#x27;s second act the police take the body, and the seemingly distressed doctor von Zahnd introduces the new intimidating male caretakers and has bars installed on all the rooms’ windows. Afterwards the three patients are finally left alone for the night.

In the play&#x27;s following climactic scene, the three men all finally reveal their secrets.

Möbius is actually an incredibly brilliant physicist whose discoveries include such fabled results as a solution to the problem of gravitation, a &quot;Unitary Theory of Elementary Particles&quot;, and the &quot;Principle of Universal Discovery&quot;. Fearing what humanity could do with these powerful discoveries, he feigned madness, in hopes that he might be put in a home for the mentally ill and thus be protected along with his knowledge.

However, he failed to avoid the attention which he so dearly feared. &quot;Einstein&quot; and &quot;Newton&quot; are both spies, representatives of two different countries of the Cold War, and they have infiltrated the &quot;Les Cerisiers&quot; in order to secure Möbius&#x27; documents and, if possible, the man himself. Each spy had to murder a nurse who each where in love with them, to protect their secrets and to strengthen their simulation of madness, as well as to further conceal their identities.

The two spies first threaten each other and then, each of the two attempts to convince Möbius to come with them. Möbius, however, persuades them that the secrets he has discovered are too terrible for man to know and assures them that their efforts are in vain because he recently burned all the manuscripts that he developed during his time in the sanatorium. After much debate, the three men finally agree that they are content to protect humanity by living out the rest of their lives in captivity, while furthering and serving physics.

These noble plans are quickly changed by the play&#x27;s final plot twist; Fräulein Doktor Mathilde von Zahnd enters the room and reveals to the three men that she has eavesdropped on their entire conversation. Furthermore, she admits to knowing about Möbius for years and has been secretly copying his documents. She reveals that she has been using his scientific discoveries to construct an international empire which she would later rule. She believes that King Solomon is speaking to her, and that, with Solomon‘s guidance and Möbius&#x27; discoveries, she can become the most powerful woman on earth.

The story ends with a sense of impending doom. Möbius, &quot;Newton&quot;, and &quot;Einstein&quot; have been tricked and trapped. The play ends with each of the men speaking to the audience, emphasizing their plight and the plight of all humanity. In their eyes, humanity was lost and could not be helped.

==Adaptations==

A 1963 radio play adaptation by Schweizer Radio DRS.

It was adapted for Australian TV.

A was produced by Süddeutscher Rundfunk and directed by Fritz Umgelter.

In 1988, a TV movie &quot;The Physicists&quot; () was produced by the Lentelefilm studio in the USSR.

BBC radio version 17/10/1963 (repeated 8/11/1963 &amp; 5/3/1972) produced by William Glen-Doepel; and BBC World Service radio versions from c1981 &amp; 7/7/1991.

In January 2013, BBC Radio 3 broadcast an adaptation by Matt Thompson with Samantha Bond as Doctor von Zahnd, Geoffrey Whitehead as the inspector, John Hodgkinson as Möbius, Thom Tuck as Newton, John Bett as Einstein, and Madeleine Worrall as both Nurse Monika and Mrs Rose.

==1964 Australian TV version==

The play was adapted for Australian TV in 1964 by the Australian Broadcasting Commission in Melbourne. Australian drama was relatively rare at the time and it was common for local versions of overseas plays to be produced.

===Premise===
At a mental asylum in Europe, police investigate the murder of two nurses who were assigned to three inmates, all physicists: Mobius, Beutler, and Ernesti. Mobius imagines himself as in contact with King Solomon. Beutel and Ernesti maintain they are Newton and Einstein.

===Cast===
*Terry Norris as Beutler
*Wynn Roberts as Mobius
*Robert Peach as Ernesti
*Syd Conabere
*Brian James
*Patricia Kennedy as psychiatrist
*Gerda Nicolson 
*Elizabeth Wing

===Production===
The play had been first produced in London in January 1963 and made its Australian stage premiere in St Martins Theatre Sydney, October 1963.

It was one of 20 TV plays produced by the ABC in 1964. Chris Muir described the play as &quot;full of the unexpected and rich in dramatic climaxes. It is also a play of black humour. Dürrenmatt, while making us laugh at ourselves, makes us feel uncomfortable in the process by showing us our failings often through grotesque imagery.&quot;

===Reception===
The critic for the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; wrote that the production:
Shifted the convincing effects in the play from the chaff of its thriller-comedy element. The light relief dialogue is there for the purpose of keeping a puzzled live audience amused, and on television this doubtful sprinkling of humour did not come through; similarly the two murders and police investigations range false in such unrealistic treatment. Christopher Muir... followed Duerrenmatt&#x27;s directions closely, imposing on television the geometrical pattern of the asylum common room with its three cell doors and the curiously clockwork behaviour of the characters. As though seen under a magnifying glass, the gripping features of the play showed clear and sharp; the only real and understandable figure, fortunately one central to the play, was given a worthy portrayal by Wynn Roberts (although one of his big scenes was cut). This was Mobius, the genius impelled by both fear and courage. Tension is well supplied to the second half of the play by, the unexpected twists of the plot, and the cold, lucid arguments of the three physicists were excellently focused in this production.

<doc id="1025819" wikidata="Q1780344" url="?curid=1025819" title="Strider (1989 arcade game)">
<text>Strider, released in Japan as is a 1989 hack and slash game developed and published by Capcom for arcades. Set in a dystopian future where Earth is ruled by the tyrannical Grandmaster Meio, it follows the titular Strider named Hiryu as he attempts to end his tyrannical reign for good. The game resulted from cooperation between Capcom and manga publisher Moto Kikaku. It marked the video game debut of Strider Hiryu, after the character was introduced in the 1988 manga &quot;Strider Hiryu&quot;.

The game debuted on Capcom&#x27;s CP System arcade board. Various home computer ports were developed by Tiertex and published by U.S. Gold in 1989. The NES version has a different plot than the original. Sega released &quot;Strider&quot; for its own Genesis console in 1990. Of all home versions, the Genesis adaptation is considered the most successful, winning the Game of the Year and Best Graphics in a Video Game awards from &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; in 1990.

&quot;Strider&quot; gameplay is cited as a major influence on the video game franchises &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;, &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;, and &quot;God of War&quot;. It became one of Capcom&#x27;s early hits, praised for its innovative gameplay, diverse and unique music, and multilingual voice samples.

==Gameplay== 
The controls of &quot;Strider&quot; consist of an eight-way joystick and two action buttons for attacking and jumping. The player controls the protagonist Strider Hiryu, a ninja whose main weapon is a tonfa-like plasma sword known as a &quot;Cypher&quot;. He can perform numerous acrobatic feats depending on the joystick/button combination used. Pressing the jump button while Hiryu is standing still will cause him to do a regular vertical jump, while pressing the jump button while pushing the joystick left or right will enable him to do a cartwheel jump. Hiryu can also slide under or through certain obstacles and enemies by first crouching down and then pressing the jump button. As well as his sliding move, both jumps can also be used to destroy weaker opponents. Hiryu is able to latch onto certain platforms, and climb across walls and ceilings using a metallic hook. While running down a sloped surface, Hiryu can gain enough momentum to allow him to do a longer cartwheel jump than usual.

Numerous power-ups can be obtained from item boxes carried by certain enemies. These include an extension to Hiryu&#x27;s attack range that lasts for one hundred slashes, two types of health aids (represented by the kanji used to write Hiryu&#x27;s name: and 飛竜), a max health extension (represented by the kanji , the second character in Hiryu&#x27;s name), an extra life, and a power-up that not only makes Hiryu invulnerable to attack but also increases his own attack abilities via shadow images of himself for 15 seconds. Hiryu can also summon robotic companions known collectively as &quot;options&quot; that help him fight enemies. These consist of up to two mushroom-like droids, a saber-toothed robo tiger and a robot hawk, known individually as Options A, B and C respectively.

The game has five stages: the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic (called &quot;St. Petersburg&quot; during the arcade game&#x27;s attract sequence), the Siberian Wilderness, the Aerial Battleship Balrog, the Amazonian Jungle, and the Grandmaster&#x27;s lair itself, the Third Moon. Each of the stages is divided into a number of smaller sections, each with their own time limit and checkpoint location. The player has a three-point health gauge (which can be increased to five points with the health extensions). Hiryu will lose a life when either his health gauge is fully depleted, by moving him off the screen entirely (like falling into a bottomless pit) or when the game&#x27;s timer reaches zero. It is Game Over when all of Hiryu&#x27;s lives are lost, but the player can be given the opportunity to continue.

==Plot== 
In a dystopian future in the year 2048, a mysterious dictator known as the &quot;Grandmaster&quot; rules the world. Hiryu, the youngest ever Super A Ranked member of an organization of high-tech ninja agents known as the &quot;Striders&quot;, is alone tasked with the Grandmaster&#x27;s assassination. Hiryu begins his mission by infiltrating the Grandmaster&#x27;s capital at the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, a Federation referred to as Eastern European which became the Imperial Capital of the Russian Empire by the year 2048.

==Development==
The arcade version of &quot;Strider&quot; was part of a three-way project conceived in a collaboration between Capcom and Hiroshi Motomiya&#x27;s manga studio Moto Kikaku, which also included the &quot;Strider Hiryu&quot; manga by Moto Kikaku&#x27;s Tatsumi Wada that was published in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Comic Computique&quot; anthology in Japan, as well as the NES version of &quot;Strider&quot;. Kouichi Yotsui, director of the coin-op &quot;Strider&quot; (who is credited as Isuke in the game), was chosen for his experience with the CP System hardware while working as a background designer on &quot;Ghouls &#x27;n Ghosts&quot;. The three projects were developed independently of each other.

According to Yotsui the franchise was conceived as a multimedia collaboration between video game company Capcom and manga collective Moto Kikaku, the two companies having previously collaborated on the video game versions of the manga &quot;Tenchi wo Kurau&quot;. Moto Kikaku produced the manga version, while Capcom developed two separate video game versions, a coin-operated video game and a console version for the NES. All three works share common plot elements, while featuring their differences as well. He further said it was he who &quot;pushed for a ninja concept&quot; as they were leaning towards an action game, a ninja setting would&#x27;ve been convenient. &quot;The hero would be derived from a ninja. We loosely decided on that.&quot; Regarding Hiryu&#x27;s three robot helpers, he said that he was inspired by the 1960s ninja comics (the one that most influenced him was Shirato Sanpei&#x27;s &quot;Kamui Gaiden&quot;), in which the ninja often had various animals to support them or attack their enemies. Speaking with &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;, Yotsui said that Strider Hiryu&#x27;s climbing abilities were inspired by his personal experience when he got himself stranded on the roof of Capcom’s building; fearing freezing to death and with no way to call for help, he climbed down the side of the building to reach a nearby fire escape stairway.

The original arcade game soundtrack was composed entirely by video game music composer Junko Tamiya, who was not credited for her work in the arcade version but was mentioned as part of the original arcade staff in some console adaptations. Early revisions of the arcade game were missing the unique music for the Aerial Battleship and Third Moon stages. In this version the music from the first stage of the game was repeated here instead.

&quot;Strider&quot; contains many different styles of themes that change dynamically throughout the game according to the stages and the situations on screen. These range from experimental and progressive futuristic sci-fi action themes to baroque, tribal and classical music pieces. Elements from the soundtrack have also been used in other Capcom games where Hiryu has appeared. These include the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series as well as other &quot;Strider&quot; related games.

==Ports==
Ports of &quot;Strider&quot; for the Atari ST, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, Commodore 64, IBM PC compatibles, and ZX Spectrum were published by U.S. Gold and developed by Tiertex in 1989. The U.S. Gold versions have the order of the third and fourth stages swapped (the order of the cut-scenes were kept the same, causing a continuity error), and the final battle with the Grandmaster missing (the last stages end with the battle against the giant robot gorilla Mecha Pong). As a result, the ending was changed to reveal that the events of the game were a simulation that the player was going through. All five versions featured downgraded graphics, less music and missing enemies compared to the arcade version. Additionally, the controls were modified so that the game would be compatible with one-button joystick controllers. The Atari ST version was used a base for the Amiga version, not utilising the Amiga&#x27;s graphics processors for improved performance and graphics. Despite these changes, all of the U.S. Gold releases received high review scores by computer game magazines of the time. Later, in 1992, the assets of the Atari ST version were used for the conversion on the Master System, also made by Tiertex. A final fight with the Grandmaster was added in this version, but the ending credits continue to say that all was just a simulation.

Sega produced their home version of &quot;Strider&quot; for the Mega Drive/Genesis, which was released in Japan on September 29, 1990, with subsequent releases in North America and the PAL region. It was advertised as one of the first 8-Megabit cartridges for the system, and went on to be a bestseller. This version was also re-released for the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on November 15, 2011 and in North America on February 16, 2012. It was re-released again on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service on October 25, 2021. The Genesis/Mega Drive version contains a different ending from the arcade game. This ending shows the destruction of the final stage as the game&#x27;s protagonist makes his escape. This is then followed by the main credit sequence that sees Hiryu flying his glider in space and reminiscing about the various encounters he had during his mission as he heads back to earth. The ending theme was an edited combination of two separate pieces of music planned for the arcade game, but replaced with a repeat of the first level music. Computer magazine &quot;ACE&quot; considered the previous Amiga conversion to be &quot;as good as this one&quot;.

Capcom separately produced a version for the X68000 computer in 1991, releasing it exclusively in Japan. It is a very close reproduction of the arcade original, with minimal changes.

A version for the Capcom Power System Changer was planned and previewed but never released.

NEC Avenue produced a PC Engine CD version of &quot;Strider Hiryu&quot;, which was released exclusively in Japan on September 22, 1994 as a CD-ROM² title which requires the Arcade Card expansion. It features an all-new desert stage that was not in the arcade version, as well as newly recorded cut-scenes, music and dialogue, with Japanese voice actor Kaneto Shiozawa as the voice of Hiryu and Kōji Totani as the Grand Master. The PC Engine CD version had a long development process, having been planned in various formats, including the SuperGrafx at one point.

The PlayStation version of &quot;Strider&quot; was first released by Capcom in 2000 as a second disc which came packaged with the PlayStation version of &quot;Strider 2&quot;. The North American release has the &quot;Strider&quot; and &quot;Strider 2&quot; game code pressed onto the wrong disc. This version was reissued separately in Japan on October 24, 2006 as part of the &quot;Capcom Game Books&quot; series, which included an extended manual and strategy guide for the game. This makes this standalone version technically the last original PlayStation game ever made, released after the system&#x27;s discontinuation in March 2006.

The original arcade version was included in the 2006 video game compilations &quot;Capcom Classics Collection: Remixed&quot; for the PlayStation Portable and &quot;Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2&quot; for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. A Japanese mobile phone version was released in 2010.

==Reception==
In the United Kingdom, &quot;Strider&quot; was the best-selling arcade game for three months during early 1989 (between February and April). In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Strider&quot; on their April 1, 1989 issue as being the third most-successful table arcade unit of the month, outperforming titles like &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;.

===Reviews===
&quot;Strider&quot; opened to critical acclaim, particularly for its gameplay, graphics, diverse music, and voice samples. The original arcade game received positive reviews from critics upon release. &quot;The Games Machine&quot; called it &quot;THE platform and ladders game to be seen playing at the moment.&quot; &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; called it &quot;brilliant&quot; and &quot;a real epic&quot; with &quot;some imaginative stuff&quot; in the game. &quot;Commodore User&quot; praised the &quot;high definition graphics, brilliant movements and good old-fashioned blasting action&quot; along with a &quot;bit of tongue-in-cheek political&quot; content.

The Genesis version was praised for its accurate and detailed faithfulness to the original. Upon release, &quot;GamePro&quot; called the Genesis port &quot;a faithful translation of the arcade hit&quot;, and praised its &quot;gorgeous graphics, non-stop arcade-style action, and ... captivating and unusual sound track.&quot; &quot;EGM&quot; awarded the Genesis port best video game of the year in 1990 and winner of their best graphics category.

&quot;Strider&quot; has spawned numerous fansites and retrospectives.

According to &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;″s Darran Jones, &quot;everything about Strider was epic. Its backgrounds were brilliantly designed and featured an array of exotic locations, while its sprite design was superb. There was a uniqueness to &quot;Strider&quot; art design that gave it a distinctive look back in 1989 and still makes it stand out brilliantly today. It&#x27;s a mysterious mish-mash of different cultures that ensured it stood out from its arcade peers.&quot; Jones also praised the game&#x27;s &quot;stunning animation&quot;, gameplay, and controls, as well as its &quot;superbly atmospheric&quot; soundtrack.

Mark Caswell of &quot;Crash&quot; magazine referred to the game&#x27;s graphics as detailed and incredible, the scrolling and action as smooth and called the gameplay &quot;some of the most demanding gameplay ever invented&quot;.

===Accolades===
At Japan&#x27;s 3rd &quot;Gamest&quot; Awards in 1989, the arcade version of &quot;Strider&quot; received the awards for Best Production and Best Action Game. &quot;Strider&quot; ranked in 5 different categories in &quot;Gamest&quot; annual video game awards, the &quot;Gamest Grand Prix&quot;: 4th in the overall &quot;Gamest Grand Prix&quot;, 5th in &quot;Best Graphics&quot;, 3rd in &quot;Best VGM&quot; and 1st in &quot;Best Action&quot; and &quot;Best Direction&quot;. The game also ranked 22nd in &quot;Best 100 games of the Year&quot;, and several characters from the game also placed well in the &quot;Best Characters&quot; category: Hiryu at the lead in 3rd place, followed by Tong Pooh (13th), the Option A robot (21st), Grandmaster Meio (25th), Ouroboros (30th) and Strobaya (39th) In a 1991 &quot;Gamest&quot; reader poll, &quot;Strider&quot; was voted the ninth best arcade game of all time; they ranked &quot;Strider&quot; 9th in the &quot;Top 30 Readers&#x27; Choice&quot; from their special issue &quot;The Best Game&quot;.

In 1990, &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; included the arcade game in its &quot;Top of the Slots &#x27;89&quot; list at third place.

In the 1990 &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; awards, the Sega Genesis version of &quot;Strider&quot; received the awards for Best Game of the Year and Best Graphics in a Video Game. In 1992, &quot;Mega&quot; placed &quot;Strider&quot; at 31st spot in their list of top Mega Drive games of all time.

In 1997 &quot;EGM&quot; ranked the Genesis version the 42nd best console video game of all time, remarking that &quot;any game where you can crawl on walls and do all kinds of cool flips is pretty awesome.&quot; In 2010, UGO.com included &quot;Strider&quot; in their list of the 25 video games that need sequels, and &quot;Game Informer&quot; included it on the list of ten gaming franchises that should be revived: &quot;Imagine the sidescrolling insanity of the &quot;Metal Slug&quot; series, but replace grizzled soldiers with a badass ninja. That&#x27;s &quot;Strider&quot;, and it&#x27;s awesome.&quot; That same year, the game was also included as one of the titles in the book &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;. ScrewAttack named it as the best Genesis game ever made, and &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; included it among the top ten Mega Drive games. In 2017, Gamesradar ranked Strider 33rd on its &quot;Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time.&quot;

==Legacy==

===NES game===
&quot;Strider&quot; was released for the NES exclusively in North America a few months after the arcade version&#x27;s release. This version was produced alongside the arcade game but follows the plot of Moto Kikaku&#x27;s tie-in manga. A Famicom version of the same game was planned for release in Japan, but never made it to the shelves.

===Sequels===
Under license from Capcom U.S.A., U.S. Gold and Tiertex produced a &quot;Strider&quot; sequel in Europe titled &quot;Strider II&quot; (released in North America as &quot;Journey From Darkness: Strider Returns&quot;) for various computer platforms, as well as the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Game Gear, and Master System home consoles. This European-produced sequel was not released in Japan. Like the previous conversions of the original game, the quality of this one was very low. Capcom later produced another sequel, unrelated to the Tiertex-produced &quot;Strider Returns&quot;, titled &quot;Strider 2&quot;, which was released for the arcades and the PlayStation in 2000.

===Reboot===
An untitled &quot;Strider&quot; reboot game was being developed by Grin in 2009, before being canceled by Capcom, soon after &quot;Bionic Commando&quot; was released. An all-new &quot;Strider&quot; reboot was developed by Double Helix Games and released on PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360 and Xbox One, and Steam in 2014.

===Other appearances===
Strider Hiryu also appears as a playable character in the 1998 fighting game &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes&quot;, which was followed by &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes&quot; in 2000. Hiryu has also made minor appearances in other Capcom-related games such as &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash&quot;, &quot;Namco × Capcom&quot;, &quot;Project X Zone 2&quot; and &quot;Adventure Quiz: Capcom World 2&quot;, including a small cameo appearance in Ken&#x27;s stage in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot;. Hiryu was one of the characters intended to appear in the unreleased 3D fighting game &quot;Capcom Fighting All-Stars&quot;. Hiryu&#x27;s next guest appearance was in the 2011 fighting game &quot;Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot; which marked his character&#x27;s official 3D debut; this game is also notable as being the first where he is voiced in English. He returned in the sequel, &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite&quot;. 

The character has received positive reception both from critics and the general public. In the Japanese &quot;Gamest&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best 100 games of the Year&quot; in 1989, Hiryu ranked 3rd in the &quot;Best Characters&quot; category. In 2000, &quot;Edge&quot; opined that &quot;in terms of visual appeal and agility, Strider Hiryu ranks as one of the best characters ever designed.&quot; That same year, IGN&#x27;s Travis Fahs noted him &quot;one of Capcom&#x27;s best loved characters&quot;, commenting that &quot;there&#x27;s no denying the iconic appeal, but for all of his flashy moves and fashion sense, Capcom has never really known what to do with him.&quot; In 2012, GamesRadar ranked this &quot;somewhat of an enduring classic&quot; as the 59th &quot;most memorable, influential, and badass&quot; protagonist in games, commenting that his &quot;sheer levels of badass cool have seen him endure long past his clichés sell-by date, making him now an archetype rather than a stereotype.&quot;

===Related games===
&quot;Strider&quot; director Kouichi Yotsui left Capcom soon after its release. He later designed an unofficial, coin-operated sequel for Mitchell Corporation in 1996. Yotsui considers that game, titled &quot;Cannon-Dancer&quot; in Japan and &quot;Osman&quot; in the West, a &quot;self-parody&quot; of his work on &quot;Strider&quot;. &quot;Moon Diver&quot; is a 2011 Square Enix game that shares some of the same gameplay elements and was also created by Yotsui. The game Run Saber, released by Atlus in 1993 for the Super NES, is often compared to Strider due to them being similar in play mechanics.

===Influence===
According to Eurogamer, &quot;Strider&quot; was a vital influence on video game franchises such as &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;, &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; and &quot;God of War&quot;. According to &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;, the over-the-top action of future Capcom franchises, such as &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; and &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot;, draws from &quot;Strider&quot;, particularly in their inclusion of the &quot;boss rush&quot;.

British rapper Tinchy Stryder named himself partially after &quot;Strider&quot;, which he often played as a boy. In October 2012, Brazilian guitarist Pedro Pimentel released a tribute theme to this game series - also named &quot;Strider&quot; and included in his debut solo album (self-titled). As published in the Brazilian edition of Guitar Player magazine (March 2013), &quot;&#x27;Strider&#x27; is a composition with a very modern theme and great guitar solos. Good quality recording and very tasteful tones.&quot;

&quot;Strider&quot; was also influential among European developers: platform games including &quot;Assassin&quot;, &quot;Zool: Ninja of the Nth Dimension&quot; and &quot;Wolfchild&quot; were influenced in either gameplay or aesthetics from the original arcade coin-op game.

In later years, various indie developers have published platform games featuring the gameplay style of &quot;Strider&quot;, with titles such as &quot;Oniken&quot;, &quot;Cataegis: The White Wind&quot;, &quot;Tänzer&quot;, &quot;Blazing Chrome&quot; and &quot;Bushiden&quot;.

The game and its world has also served as a point of inspiration for Keiji Inafune, the co-creator of &quot;Mega Man&quot;. Inafune has stated that he has always liked the &quot;world view&quot; of &quot;Strider&quot; and modeled the name of &quot;Mega Man X&quot; co-protagonist Zero after one of its characters (reportedly, Solo). Capcom has also stated that one of the game&#x27;s villains, Tong Pooh, served as inspiration for &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character, Chun-Li.

<text>Pergamon Press was an Oxford-based publishing house, founded by Paul Rosbaud and Robert Maxwell, that published scientific and medical books and journals. Originally called Butterworth-Springer, it is now an imprint of Elsevier.

==History==
The core company, Butterworth-Springer, started in 1948 to bring the &quot;Springer know-how and techniques of aggressive publishing in science&quot; to Britain. Paul Rosbaud was the man with the knowledge. When Maxwell acquired the company in 1951, Rosbaud held a one-quarter share. They changed the house name to Pergamon Press, using a logo that was a reproduction of a Greek coin from Pergamon. Maxwell and Rosbaud worked together growing the company until May 1956, when, according to Joe Haines, Rosbaud was sacked.

When Pergamon Press started it had only six serials and two books. Initially the company headquarters was in Fitzroy Square in West End of London. In 1959, the company moved into Headington Hill Hall, a country home rented from the city of Oxford.

In 1960, Brian Cox joined Pergamon Press as subscription manager. After the founders&#x27; deaths, Cox has become the primary witness to the phenomenal rise of Pergamon Press in the Science, Technology, and Medicine (STM) sector of publishing. The 59 Pergamon academic journals in 1960 became 418 journals in 1992. Cox recalls that in the process some 700 were launched, many transmogrifying rather than ceasing. Cox says &quot;The secret of Pergamon&#x27;s success was to publish a large number of journals, so that the established titles could support the new ones during their formative years&quot;.

In 1962, Pergamon Press started the series called &quot;The Commonwealth and International Library of Sciences, Technology, Engineering, and Liberal Studies&quot;. By 1970, this series had 1000 titles. Brian Cox says that in all, Pergamon published 7,000 monographs for various authors.

In 1964, Pergamon Press became a public company. With its growth and export performance, the company was a recipient of one of the Queen&#x27;s Awards for Enterprise in 1966. That year saw construction of a new office block and warehouse at Headington Hill. Pergamon ventured to produce an &quot;Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Physics&quot;, in nine volumes and four supplements in the decade from 1961.

In 1969, Maxwell lost control of Pergamon and was ejected from the board. An inquiry by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) under the Takeover Code of the time reported in mid-1971: &quot;We regret having to conclude that, notwithstanding Mr Maxwell&#x27;s acknowledged abilities and energy, he is not in our opinion a person who can be relied on to exercise proper stewardship of a publicly quoted company.&quot; It was found that Maxwell had contrived to maximise Pergamon&#x27;s share price through transactions between his private family companies. Maxwell reacquired Pergamon in 1974 after borrowing funds.

Pergamon continued with &quot;International Encyclopedias&quot; in biotechnology, chemistry, education, engineering, entomology, linguistics, materials science, and pharmacology and toxicology. The education volume won the Dartmouth Medal from the American Library Association in 1986 as the best reference work of the year.

Pergamon also has offices in Elmsford, New York, in the United States.

Pergamon is the publisher of several works of the Club of Rome, such as &quot;Beyond the Age of Waste&quot;, &quot;Energy, the Countdown&quot;, &quot;No Limits to Learning&quot;, &quot;Towards more Effective Societies&quot;, &quot;Dialogue of Wealth and Welfare&quot; and &quot;Microelectronics and Society&quot;.

== Business approach ==
In 2017 Stephen Buranyi described Maxwell&#x27;s approach in the &quot;Guardian&quot;:

The consequences of Pergamon Press business strategies during this period has been described by Mark W. Neff in the academic journal &quot;Issues in Science and Technology&quot;:

==Sale to Elsevier== 
Maxwell sold Pergamon Press to academic publishing giant Elsevier in March 1991 for £440 million; the funds were used to repay the large debt taken on by Maxwell in taking control of &quot;New York Daily News&quot;.

Maxwell retained Pergamon&#x27;s US books (which became part of sister company Macmillan Inc.), the &quot;Chess&quot; and &quot;Bridge&quot; magazines, and some smaller properties. The imprint &quot;Pergamon Press&quot; continues to be used to identify journals now published by Elsevier.

<text>Dunlop Manufacturing, Inc. is a manufacturer of musical accessories, especially effects units, based in Benicia, California, United States. Founded in 1965 by Jim Dunlop Sr., the company grew from a small home operation to a large manufacturer of music gear. Dunlop has acquired several well-known effects pedal brands, including Cry Baby, MXR and Way Huge.

== Background and history ==

Scottish immigrant Jim Dunlop founded the Jim Dunlop Company in 1965 as a part-time business while working as a processing and chemical engineer at Barr and Stroud in Glasgow. He was an apprentice of the creator of the first hip replacement, William &quot;Bill&quot; Wallace. His first product was the Vibra-Tuner, a small device that attached to a guitar with a suction cup and displayed whether the guitar was in tune with the vibration of a small reed.

While visiting music stores to sell his new product, someone told him that musicians needed a good capo, remarking that anyone who made a good capo that could handle a 12-string guitar would make a lot of money. Using his engineering background, Dunlop created the toggle capo, and then worked with a local machine shop to build the first capo dies, manufacturing what eventually became the long running &quot;1100 series&quot; capo.

Starting from his living room, Dunlop later moved construction to his garage, and then to a location outside the house.

On March 19, 1972, he moved into the pick market, after reading every issue of &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine and noting musicians’ comments concerning what they liked and did not like about picks. He made his first picks from nylon, and continues to produce these.

Also in 1972, Dunlop left his job at Dymo Industries to focus on his own company full-time. He moved his family to Benicia, California and set up shop in Benicia Industrial Park. A few years later, he outgrew that building and moved to Industrial Way.

Dunlop products now range from capos and picks to slides, strings, fret wire, strap retainers, and a variety of electronic effects, including the original Cry Baby wah-wah pedal, the Uni-Vibe phaser, Heil Talk Box, and the MXR and &quot;Way Huge&quot; lines of stompboxes.

Dunlop Manufacturing founder Jim Dunlop Sr died on February 6, 2019, at the age of 82.

== Way Huge Electronics ==
Jeorge Tripps launched Way Huge in 1992. In late 1999 the company closed its doors when Tripps went to work for Line 6. In 2008, Tripps and the company moved to Dunlop Manufacturing and resurrected the Way Huge line, including the Swollen Pickle (a fuzz), Pork Loin (an overdrive), Fat Sandwich (a distortion), and Green Rhino (another overdrive). They have also recently reissued the much sought-after and often cloned Red Llama overdrive, notable for its volume boost and gain past 2 o&#x27;clock which results in a sound that is very distorted and has considerable mid-range presence. Way Huge has also collaborated with Joe Bonamassa on various drive pedals including the &#x27;Penny Saver Royale&#x27; and the &#x27;Overrated Special&#x27;.

== Tortex==
Introduced in 1981, Tortex is the company&#x27;s brand name for an acetal based line of plectra. The overall feeling of the picks is meant to mimic the feeling of vintage tortoise shell picks (as genuine tortoise shell picks have been banned since 1973).

<text>The Taylor Highway (numbered Alaska Route 5) is a highway in the U.S. state of Alaska that extends 160 miles (258 km) from Tetlin Junction, about 11 miles (17 km) east of Tok on the Alaska Highway, to Eagle. The southern 96 miles from the Alaska Highway to Jack Wade Junction is designated as Alaska Route 5. The entire highway formerly carried this designation, but the north end of Route 5 has been rerouted to follow the Top of the World Highway to the Canadian border.

==Route description==
The first of the highway is paved; the rest is gravel. The highway is closed to automobile traffic from October through April, but is used by snowmobiles in the winter. The large Fortymile caribou herd roams near the highway. The highway also provides access to the Fortymile River National Wild and Scenic River system.

==History==
Wagon trails had supplied Eagle, Chicken, and the historic Fortymile Mining District since the nineteenth century. The Fortymile Road was established in 1951 and later renamed in honor of ARC President (1932–1948) Ike P. Taylor. It connects to the Top of the World Highway from Tetlin, at Jack Wade Junction, allowing road access to Dawson City, Yukon during parts of the year. It is from Jack Wade Junction to Dawson City.

<doc id="1025835" wikidata="Q26961740" url="?curid=1025835" title="Hardy Spicer">
<text>Hardy Spicer is a brand of automotive transmission or driveline equipment best known for its mechanical constant velocity universal joint originally manufactured in Britain by Hardy employing patents belonging to US-based Spicer Manufacturing. Hardy and Spicer soon became partners. Later Spicer became Dana Holding Corporation.

Since the commercial success of front wheel drive cars began in the 1960s the industry manufacturing universal joints has grown enormously.

The Hardy Spicer and Laycock Engineering group of businesses, later known as Birfield, have been part of the GKN Driveline group since 1966.

==History==
Ed. J Hardy Limited was founded and later formed into a limited liability company by Birmingham-born cycle-parts manufacturer Edward John Hardy (1874–1950) in 1903 to import components for British motor manufacturers from France. The French industry was then dominant.

===Bearings===
Bound Brook Bearings of Bound Brook, New Jersey sold to Ed J Hardy and Company in 1922 the rights to manufacture their oil-less bearings and oil retaining bearings and sell them in Europe and the British Empire.

===Flexible coupling===
Just before the first World War Hardy designed, patented and made a flexible laminated fabric and rubber coupling which soon became standard on British cars and trucks. A licence to manufacture the &quot;Hardy flexible coupling&quot; in USA was granted to the Thermoid Rubber Company.

===Mechanical universal joint===
More powerful engines and higher speeds required a mechanical universal joint. In USA, already with a link to Thermoid, Hardy established a contact with Spicer Manufacturing Corporation of Toledo, Ohio. Spicer took a share of Ed. J Hardy Limited in exchange for British patent rights and all engineering data of the Spicer mechanical joint and in 1926 the name of Ed. J Hardy &amp; Co was changed to Hardy, Spicer and Co Limited.

===Other businesses===
The Phosphor Bronze Company was bought in 1937 for its manufacture of high grade non-ferrous castings and the following year Hardy, Spicer elected to make their own forgings in their own forging plant. The plant&#x27;s name was Forgings and Presswork (Birmingham) Limited. Sheffield&#x27;s Laycock Engineering also made a flexible coupling known as Layrub as well as being a large manufacturer of garage and railway equipment.

==Birfield Industries==
In 1939 Hardy-Spicer joined with Laycock Engineering both becoming subsidiaries of a new holding company named Birfield Industries Limited incorporated by Laycock Engineering&#x27;s chairman, Herbert Hill (1901–1987) for that purpose.

===Constant velocity joints===
Herbert Hill pushed his team to make continuous improvements to the basic Rzeppa constant velocity joint and was rewarded in the 1960s when much of the world&#x27;s motor industry switched to front wheel drive using Birfield joints, the CV joints now made by GKN Driveline and currently installed in more than one-third of all new cars worldwide.

Notable improvements to the original Rzeppa design have been the elimination of the need for a splined coupling and Birfield&#x27;s modifications to the ball grooves and their track-steered ball cage introduced with BMC&#x27;s Minis in 1959.

===Rear axles===
Salisbury Axle in USA was also part of the Spicer Group and in 1939 the Salisbury Transmission Company was formed in Britain to manufacture hypoid rear axles and, in the late 1950s, &quot;Powr-Lok&quot; limited-slip differentials.

===Automotive clutches===
Laycock&#x27;s principal product became spring diaphragm clutches. 

From the late 1940s into the 1970s it made under de Normanville patents an add-on epicyclic overdrive unit which saved manufacturers from incorporating a 4th or 5th gear within their gearboxes.

==Birfield multinational group 1964==
;Group members included: Hardy Spicer; Laycock Engineering; Forgings &amp; Presswork; Salisbury Transmission; Kent Alloys; Bound Brook; Felco Hoists; Hardy Spicer Walterscheid; John C Carlson; T B Ford; Shotton Bros; Felco Hoists; Birfield Filtration; R Jones &amp; Co; Oddy Engineering; Birfield Machine Tools; Birfield Extrusions; Foundry Mechanisations (Baillot); A E Callaghan &amp; Son; Micron Sprayers; Birfield Industries.

;Overseas group members: Bound Brook Bearing Corporation of America, Nordiska Kardan AB; Birfield (Ireland); Birfield (Nederland) Tranmissie; Felco France.

;Overseas interests: 37.5 per cent of Uni-Cardan AG, 21 per cent of France&#x27;s Glaenzer-Spicer SA in any case controlled by Uni-Cardan, Birfield Transmissioni SpA in Italy jointly owned with Glaenzer-Spicer, an association with Toyo Bearing of Japan and lesser interests in businesses in many other industrialised countries.

==GKN Driveline==
In 1966 Guest Keen &amp; Nettlefold seeing advantage in amalgamating with its local competition and wanting to pre-empt an expected bid from USA&#x27;s TRW Inc. bought Birfield the sole UK supplier of CVJs.

There were also particular significant advantages in the amalgamation such as Hardy Spicer&#x27;s strength in the EU and USA whereas GKN was weak in both those parts of the world.

As GKN Driveline its constant velocity joints take near 50 per cent of the world market and Driveline employs about 22,000 people at 46 locations across 23 countries.

<text>The Instituto Superior Técnico (IST, also known as Técnico, and stylized TÉCNICO LISBOA; English: ) is the school of engineering and technology of the University of Lisbon. It was founded as an autonomous school in 1911, and was integrated into the Technical University of Lisbon (now part of the University of Lisbon) in 1930. IST is the largest school of engineering in Portugal by number of enrolled students, faculty size, scientific production and patents.

IST has three campuses, all located in the Lisbon metropolitan area: the Alameda campus in Lisbon, the Taguspark campus in the Oeiras municipality, and the &quot;Tecnológico e Nuclear&quot; campus in the Loures municipality. The school is divided in 11 departments that are responsible for teaching undergraduate and postgraduate programs. Each department is organized in sections, which group together specific subjects within its scientific area. In addition, the laboratories of the several departments support the teaching and research activities carried out at IST.

IST is a member of several university partnerships, including CLUSTER, CESAER, T.I.M.E., TPC, and the ATHENS Programme.

== History ==
The &quot;Instituto Superior Técnico&quot; (IST) was created from the split of the Lisbon Commercial and Industrial Institute (IICL) into two schools. Following the implantation of the Republic in Portugal in 1910, Alfredo Bensaúde, a professor of Mineralogy and Geology at the IICL, was invited by Manuel de Brito Camacho, Minister of Development in the Provisional Government, to create and lead a new technical school, as part of nationwide education reforms. A decree approved on 23 May 1911 and published in the &quot;Diário do Governo&quot; declared that the IICL would be split into two schools: the &quot;Instituto Superior do Comércio&quot; (current Lisbon School of Economics and Management) and the &quot;Instituto Superior Técnico&quot;. 

Alfredo Bensaúde was the first director of IST, a position he held from 1911 to 1920. He implemented its first pedagogical program, which had five engineering courses: mining engineering, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and chemical-industrial engineering. Under his direction, there was an investment in theoretical-practical teaching where workshops and laboratories, as well as the library, played an essential role. He also noted for recruiting foreign teachers, which he considered to have an essential role in organizing some of the courses. 

The first facilities of IST were located in the Rua da Boavista in Lisbon. In 1927, Duarte Pacheco became director of IST and started the project for a new campus for the school. He requested the design to architect Porfírio Pardal Monteiro, who counted with the collaboration of Luís Benavente, a fellow architect, in the project. The construction of the Alameda campus started in 1928 and was finished in 1935, with the inauguration happening the following year. IST became the first academic institution in Portugal with its own campus. In the meantime, in 1930, IST became part of the newly created Technical University of Lisbon. In 1948, IST hosted the &quot;Fifteen Years of Public Works&quot; exhibition, an event organized by the Portuguese State to exhibit the new infrastructures built in the first 15 years of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot;. The statue of a woman holding a square and compass, by Salvador Barata Feyo, placed in the northern side of the campus, is a sculpture from this exhibition that was permanently added to the Alameda campus. 

Between 1952 and 1972, 12 study centres were established in Portugal, three of them at IST, in the fields of Chemistry, Geology and Mineralogy, and Electronics. These centres were responsible for promoting faculty training and scientific qualification through doctoral studies in universities and research centres abroad.

In 1970, the minimum period for obtaining a bachelor&#x27;s degree decreased from six to five years, and the number of students enrolled at IST significantly increased. During the 1970s, scientific research at IST also has a major increase, through the creation of the Interdisciplinary Complex building in 1973, which gathered together various autonomous research units.

During the 1990s, more engineering courses, including Master and PhD degrees, were added to IST&#x27;s curricular offer. The facilities in the Alameda campus had the greatest expansion in this decade, with the construction of the Civil Engineering and Architecture Pavilion and the North and South towers. 

In 2000, IST inaugurated a new campus in the municipality of Oeiras, specifically in the Taguspark, the first Portuguese science and technology park. In the academic year 2006–2007, the Declaration of Bologna was successfully implemented for all IST programmes, reducing the time to obtain a bachelor&#x27;s degree to three years. In 2012, the &quot;Tecnológico e Nuclear&quot; campus was added to IST, following the discontinuation of the Technological and Nuclear Institute.

Today IST is involved with several of Portugal&#x27;s research, development and technology transfer institutions and offers a vast number of degrees in science and engineering areas, at undergraduate, master and doctoral levels. IST is also part of several networks and international programmes to promote student mobility, both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. 

== Campuses and facilities ==
IST has three campuses: the Alameda campus in Lisbon, the Taguspark campus in the Oeiras municipality, and the &quot;Tecnológico e Nuclear&quot; campus in the Loures municipality.

=== Alameda campus ===

The Alameda campus is the primary location of IST. It was inaugurated in 1936 as the first dedicated university campus in Portugal. It is located in the &quot;freguesia&quot; of Areeiro, in Lisbon.

The campus originally had 7 buildings. Throughout the years, new buildings were constructed inside the campus, expanding the facilities of IST. Some of the buildings added after 1936 include:

* The Interdisciplinary Complex, opened in 1973;
* The Civil Engineering and Architecture Pavilion, opened in 1993;
* The North Tower, opened in 1994;
* The South Tower, opened in 2000;
* The Social Action Pavilion, opened in 2003.
Currently the campus has a total of 26 buildings. Apart from lecture and research buildings, it includes a dedicated canteen building, a building for the students&#x27; association, playing fields for sports, an indoor swimming pool, and a kindergarten.

=== Taguspark campus ===

IST inaugurated a second campus in the Taguspark, a science and technology park in Porto Salvo, in the Oeiras municipality, in 2000. The campus consists of a main building, a sports field and a hall of residence.

Taguspark is located about 14 km to the west of the Alameda campus. A free shuttle bus service connecting the Alameda and Taguspark campuses is available for exclusive use of the IST community.

As of the academic year 2023–2024, three bachelor&#x27;s degree programmes and five master&#x27;s degree programmes are lectured in the Taguspark campus.

=== &quot;Tecnológico e Nuclear&quot; campus ===
The &quot;Tecnológico e Nuclear&quot; campus was added to IST in 2012. It is located in Bobadela, in the municipality of Loures, about 9 km northeast of the Alamada campus. Prior to its addition to IST, the campus belonged to the Technological and Nuclear Institute (Portuguese: &quot;Instituto Tecnológico e Nuclear)&quot;, which was extinguished in December 2011 by governmental decree.

The campus contained the only nuclear reactor in Portugal, which was used for more than 50 years for scientific research. The reactor was stopped on 11 May 2016 and dismantled in 2019.

As of the academic year 2023–2024, two master&#x27;s degree programmes use the facilities in this campus: Radiation Protection and Safety, and Science and Technology for the Cultural Heritage.

<text>Kherson (Ukrainian and , ; ) is a port city in southern Ukraine that serves as the administrative centre of Kherson Oblast. Located by the Black Sea and on the Dnieper River, Kherson is the home to a major ship-building industry and is a regional economic centre. At the beginning of 2022, its population was estimated at 279,131.

From March to November 2022, the city was occupied by Russian forces during their invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian forces recaptured the city on 11 November 2022. In June 2023, the city was flooded following the Russian destruction of the nearby Kakhovka Dam.

==Etymology==
As the first new settlement in the &quot;Greek project&quot; of Empress Catherine and her favourite Grigory Potemkin, it was named after the Heraclea Pontic colony of Chersonesus ( ) which was located on the Crimean Peninsula, meaning &#x27;peninsular shore&#x27;.

== History ==
=== Early days and Russian Empire era (until 1917) ===
Kherson was preceded by the town of &quot;Bilechowisce&quot;, first marked on a map by Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan from 1648. &quot;Bilchowisce&quot; was listed as one of the three chief towns of Yedisan in a 1701 book by English cartographer Herman Moll. A French-language map of the site in 1769 (inset) shows a Russian-built fort or sconce named St. Alexandre. This had been built in 1737 during the Russo-Turkish War and served the Zaporizhian Sich as an administrative center, run by local Cossacks.
The Russian Empire annexed the territory from the Crimean Khanate in 1774, and a decree of Catherine the Great on 18 June 1778 founded Kherson on the high bank of the Dnieper as a central fortress of the Black Sea Fleet.

1783 saw the city granted the rights of a district town and the opening of a local shipyard where the hulls of the Russian Black Sea fleet were laid. Within a year the Kherson Shipping Company began operations. By the end of the 18th century, the port had established trade with France, Italy, Spain and other European countries. Between 1783 and 1793 Poland&#x27;s maritime trade via the Black Sea was conducted through Kherson by the &quot;Kompania Handlowa Polska&quot;. The Poles leased a piece of the shoreline and built houses, exchange offices, workshops and warehouses. There was substantial immigration of Poles and a Polish consulate was established in 1783. In 1791, Potemkin was buried in the newly built St. Catherine&#x27;s Cathedral. In 1803 the city became the capital of the Kherson Governorate.
Industry, beginning with breweries, tanneries and other food and agricultural processing, developed from the 1850s. According to the Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland and other Slavic Countries from 1880, the city was mostly inhabited by Ukrainians, Greeks and Jews. According to the 1897 census, the population of the city was 59,076 of which, on the basis of their first language, 47.2% were recorded as Russian, 29.1% as Jewish, 19.6% Ukrainian, 1.7% Polish. During the revolution of 1905 there were workers&#x27; strikes and an army mutiny (an armed demonstration by soldiers of the 10th Disciplinary Battalion) in the city.

=== Soviet era (1917–1991) ===
==== Early Bolshevik period ====
In the Russian Constituent Assembly election held in November 1917—the first and last free election in Kherson for 70 years—Bolsheviks who had seized power in Petrograd and Moscow received just 13.2 percent of the vote in the Governorate. The largest electoral bloc in the district, with 43 percent of the vote, was an alliance of Ukrainian Socialist Revolutionaries (SRs), Russian Socialist Revolutionaries and the United Jewish Socialist Workers Party.

The Bolsheviks dissolved SR-dominated Assembly after its first sitting, and proceeded to force from Kiev the Central Council of Ukraine (Tsentralna Rada) whose response to the Leninist coup had been to proclaim the independence of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic (UPR). But, before the Bolsheviks could secure Kherson, they were obliged to cede the region under the terms of the March 1918 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk to the German and Austrian controlled Ukrainian State. After the withdrawal of German and Austrian forces in November 1918, the efforts of the UPR (the Petluirites) to assert authority were frustrated by a French-led Allied intervention which occupied Kherson in January 1919.
In March 1919, the Green Army of local warlord Otaman Nykyfor Hryhoriv ousted the French and Greek garrison and precipitated the Allied evacuation from Odesa. In July, the Bolsheviks defeated Hryhoriv who had called upon the Ukrainian people to rise against the &quot;Communist impostors&quot; and their &quot;Jewish commissars&quot;, and had perpetrated pogroms, including in the Kherson region. Kherson itself was occupied by the counter-revolutionary Whites before finally falling to the Bolshevik Red Army in February 1920. In 1922 the city and region was formally incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR a constituent republic of the Soviet Union.

The population was radically reduced from 75,000 to 41,000 by the famine of 1921–1923, but then rose steadily, reaching 97,200 in 1939.

==== World War II and post-War period ====
In 1940, the city was one of the sites of executions of Polish officers and intelligentsia committed by the Soviets as part of the Katyn massacre.

Further devastation and population loss resulted from the German occupation during the Second World War. The German occupation, which lasted from August 1941 to March 1944, contended with both Soviet and Ukrainian nationalist (OUN) underground cells. The Kherson district leadership of the OUN was headed by (brother of OUN leader Stepan Bandera).

In September 1941, the Germans executed the city&#x27;s remaining Jewish population, several thousand men, women and children, in anti-tank ditches near the village of Zelenivka. Later, they used the place to bury Soviet soldiers from a prisoner-of-war camp in the city (Stalag 370).

In the post-war decades, which saw substantial industrial growth, the population more than doubled, reaching 261,000 by 1970. The new factories, including the Comintern Shipbuilding and Repairs Complex, the Kuibyshev Ship Repair Complex, and the Kherson Cotton Textile Manufacturing Complex (one of the largest textile plants in the Soviet Union), and Kherson&#x27;s growing grain-exporting port, drew in labour from the Ukrainian countryside. This changed the city&#x27;s ethnic composition, increasing the Ukrainian share from 36% in 1926 to 63% in 1959, while reducing the Russian share from 36 to 29%. The Jewish population never recovered from the Holocaust visited by the Germans: accounting for 26% of residents in 1926, their number had fallen to just 6% in 1959.

=== In independent Ukraine ===
With a turnout of 83.4% of eligible voters, 90.1% of the votes cast in Kherson Oblast affirmed Ukrainian independence in the national referendum of 1 December 1991. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kherson and its industries experienced severe dislocation. Over the following three decades, the population of both the city and the region declined, reflecting both a significant excess of deaths over live births and persistent net-emigration from the area.

The 2014 pro-Russian unrest in eastern and southern Ukraine was marked in Kherson by a small demonstration of some 400 persons. Following the Russian occupation of Crimea in 2014, Kherson housed the office of the Ukrainian President&#x27;s representative in Crimea.

In July 2020, as part of the general administrative reform of Ukraine, the Kherson Municipality was merged as Kherson urban hromada into newly established Kherson Raion, one of five raions in the Kherson Oblast of which the city remained the administrative centre.
A &quot;City Profile&quot;, part of the SCORE (Social Cohesion and Reconciliation) &quot;Ukraine 2021&quot; project funded by USAID, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the European Union, concluded that &quot;more than 80% of citizens in Kherson city feel their locality is a good place to live, work, and raise a family&quot;. This was despite a low level of trust in the local authorities in whom corruption was perceived to be high. It also found that, while more inclined to express support for co-operation with Russia than for membership of the EU, &quot;citizens in Kherson feel attached to their Ukrainian identity&quot;.

==== 2020 local election ====
In the last free elections before the 2022 Russian invasion, the Ukrainian local elections held on 25 October 2020, the results of Kherson City Council elections were as follows:

The parties widely perceived as pro-Russian, and Euro-skeptic, Opposition Platform, Volodymyr Saldo Bloc, and Party of Shariy (3.9%) had a combined vote of just over 30% of the total, and secured 20 out of the 54 seats on the city council. In the wake of the invasion, the Opposition Platform and the Party of Shariy were banned by the National Security Council for alleged ties to the Kremlin.

The Volodymyr Saldo Bloc dissolved; its deputies in Kyiv joined the newly formed faction &quot;Support to the programs of the President of Ukraine&quot;. From 26 April 2022, Volodymyr Saldo himself, who had been mayor of Kherson from 2002 to 2012, went on to serve the Russian occupiers, as head of the Kherson military–civilian administration.

=== Russian invasion from February 2022 ===

Kherson witnessed heavy fighting in the first days of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine (Kherson offensive). As of 2 March the city was under Russian control, and as early as 8 March the Russian FSB was reported to be tasked with crushing resistance.

Under the Russian occupation, locals continued to stage street protests against the invading army&#x27;s presence and in support of the unity of Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian government, the Russian military sought to create a puppet Kherson People&#x27;s Republic in the style of the Russian-backed separatist polities in the Donbas region and tried to coerce local councillors into endorsing the move, detaining those activists and officials who opposed their design.

By 26 April 2022, Russian troops had taken over the city&#x27;s administration headquarters and had appointed both a new mayor, former KGB agent Alexander Kobets, and ex-mayor Volodymyr Saldo as a new civilian-military regional administrator. The next day, Ukraine&#x27;s Prosecutor General said that troops used tear gas and stun grenades to disperse a further pro-Ukraine rally in the city centre. In an indication of an intended split from Ukraine, on the 28th the new administration announced that from May it would switch the region&#x27;s payments to the Russian ruble. Citing unnamed reports about alleged discrimination against Russian speakers, its deputy head, Kirill Stremousov, said that &quot;reintegrating the Kherson region back into a Nazi Ukraine is out of the question&quot;.
On 30 September 2022, the Russian Federation claimed to have annexed Kherson Oblast. The United Nations General Assembly condemned the proclaimed annexations with a vote of 143–5.

Russian forces were ordered to withdraw from the city by defence minister Sergei Shoigu and regroup on the eastern side of the Dnieper on 9 November 2022. Ukrainian officials claimed that Russian troops were destroying bridges connecting the city to the other bank of the river. On 11 November, Ukraine announced that its forces had entered the city following the Russian withdrawal.
Before retreating, the Russian army destroyed infrastructure facilities of the city (communications, water, heat, electricity, TV tower), looted two main museums (Local History Museum and the Art Museum), transporting their items to Crimean museums, and took away several monuments to historical figures.

In June 2023, the city was flooded following the Russian destruction of the nearby Kakhovka Dam.

On 23 October 2023, online voting concluded on the renaming of numerous streets and localities in Kherson for purposes of decolonization and derussification. This was in accordance with Law of Ukraine &quot;On Condemnation and Prohibition of Propaganda of Russian Imperial Policy in Ukraine and Decolonization of Toponymy&quot;, giving local councils six months to remove problematic toponymy.

With Russian forces entrenched just across the Dnipro River, the city remains subject to frequent shelling. By the beginning of 2024, just 71,000 of the city&#x27;s pre-war population of 300,000 remain.

In late May 2024, the Russians started sending in small drones to purposefully target Kherson civilians in a terror campaign that became known as the ″human safari″. Russian drones, many of them funded by Russian civilians according to American freelance journalist Zarina Zabrisky, hit targets such as people at bus stops, commuters and children playing in parks, with footage of the attacks being shared and celebrated on Russian social media.

<text>Laurin &amp; Klement was a Czech automobile, motorcycle and bicycle manufacturing company founded in 1895 in Mladá Boleslav, Kingdom of Bohemia by automotive pioneers Václav Laurin and Václav Klement. Car production commenced in 1905, and the company soon became the largest car manufacturer in Austria-Hungary. It was acquired by industrial conglomerate Škoda Works in 1925 and re-branded as Škoda Auto, which is today the largest car manufacturer in the Czech Republic and a part of the Volkswagen Group.

==History==
The company was founded in 1895 and engaged in the production of new bicycles as well as doing repairs, their first bicycles being called &quot;Slavia&quot;. The company was named after its two founders: Václav Laurin (born 27 September 1865, died 4 December 1930), and Václav Klement (born 16 October 1868, died 13 August 1938).

Car production commenced in 1905, and the company soon became the largest car manufacturer in Austria-Hungary. In 1925 the company was acquired by the Škoda Works, and operated henceforth under the brand Škoda Auto (Škoda).

Today, the &quot;Laurin &amp; Klement&quot; name is used by Škoda Auto to distinguish especially luxurious editions of some of their car models (Yeti, Octavia, Superb and Kodiaq).

<doc id="1025869" wikidata="Q943937" url="?curid=1025869" title="Saint Phocas">
<text>Phocas, sometimes called Phocas the Gardener (Greek: Φωκᾶς), is venerated as a martyr and saint by the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches. His life and legend may have been a fusion of three men with the same name: a Phocas of Antioch, a Phocas the Gardener and Phocas, Bishop of Sinope.

==Life==
Catholic tradition states that he was a gardener who lived at Sinope, on the Black Sea, who used his crops to feed the poor and aided persecuted Christians. During the persecutions of Diocletian, he provided hospitality to the soldiers who were sent to execute him. The soldiers, not knowing that their host was their intended victim, agreed to his hospitality. Phocas also offered to help them find the person they were seeking.

As the soldiers slept, Phocas dug his own grave and prayed. He made arrangements for all his possessions to be distributed to the poor after his death. In the morning, when the soldiers awoke, Phocas revealed his identity.

The soldiers hesitated and offered to report to their commander that their search had been fruitless. Phocas refused this offer and bared his neck. He was then decapitated and buried in the grave that he had dug for himself.

==Veneration==
He is mentioned by Asterius of Amasia (ca. 400). The name Phocas seems to derive from the Greek word for &quot;seal&quot; (phoke/φώκη), which may explain his patronage of sailors and mariners. A sailors&#x27; custom was to serve Phocas a portion of every meal; this was called &quot;the portion of St. Phocas.&quot; This portion was bought by one of the voyagers and the price was deposited in the hands of the captain. When the ship came into port, the money was distributed among the poor, in thanksgiving to their benefactor for their successful voyage. He is mentioned in the work by Laurentius Surius. This tradition may be connected to a similar practice among sailors in the Baltic Sea of giving food offerings to an invisible sprite known as the Klabautermann.

Phocas is mentioned in W. H. Auden&#x27;s poem Horae Canonicae, Sext I, verse 6, 2nd line.

<doc id="1025889" wikidata="Q555207" url="?curid=1025889" title="Jaime Paz Zamora">
<text>Jaime Paz Zamora (born 15 April 1939) is a former Bolivian politician who served as the 60th president of Bolivia from 1989 to 1993. He also served as the 32nd vice president of Bolivia from October 1982 to December 1984 during the presidency of Hernán Siles Zuazo.

==Foundation of the MIR and alliance with Siles Zuazo==

Jaime Paz Zamora studied in Belgium and became an ardent supporter of left-wing/progressive causes in the turbulent 1960s. Exiled by dictator Hugo Banzer in 1971, he co-founded in Chile the Revolutionary Left Movement (&quot;Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria&quot;, MIR), originally a member of the Socialist International.

Soon, the MIR attracted the support of a large portion of the Marxist intelligentsia, especially university students. Upon returning to Bolivia in 1978, Paz&#x27;s MIR cemented an alliance with the Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario de Izquierda of former President Hernán Siles. The result was the formation of the Unidad Democrática y Popular (UDP).

It was a mutually beneficial pact, since Siles offered everything the MIR lacked (experience and legitimacy with the working class stemming from the 1952 Revolution) while Paz, in turn, provided Siles what he did not have: the support of the university students and younger intellectuals.

==The inconclusive 1978 and 1979 elections==
The UDP participated in the June 1978 elections, with Siles at the head of the ticket and, by all accounts won a plurality. The vote was annulled, however, due to the discovery of massive fraud on behalf of the government endorsed candidate, General Juan Pereda. New elections were conducted in 1979. They, too, turned out to be a fiasco, as the UDP&#x27;s Hernán Siles, with Paz as his vice-presidential running mate, finished first at the ballot box, but without attaining the 50% majority necessary for direct election. Thus, it was left to Congress to determine the next Chief Executive, as stipulated in the Bolivian Constitution. Surprisingly (or perhaps not, given the lack of democratic practice in Bolivia at that time) Congress could not agree on any candidate, no matter how many votes were taken. Eventually, Congress proclaimed as temporary President the head of the Senate, Dr. Wálter Guevara, pending the calling of yet a new round of elections in 1980.

==The 1980 elections==
Ominously, the ultra-right wing of the Bolivian military began to intimate that it would never stand for the installation in the Palacio Quemado of the &quot;extremist&quot; Siles and Paz, but the 1980 campaign continued unabated. In April, the small rented plane in which Paz and a delegation of UDP politicians were traveling crashed in the Altiplano near La Paz, with the resulting death of all on board except the vice-presidential candidate. The plane had belonged to a company owned by Colonel Luis Arce, who would surface as Minister of Interior in the upcoming (and quite ruthless) military dictatorship of Luis Garcia Meza. No one doubts that it was an assassination attempt. In any case, Paz recovered from his burns and resumed campaigning, buoyed by the increasing support received in the aftermath of the &quot;accident.&quot; The winner of this third vote in three years was, yet again, the Siles Zuazo-Paz Zamora formula. The two would have been sworn in, were it not for the July 17, 1980, coup of General Luis García Meza, which brutally interrupted the democratic process.

==The UDP in power and Paz as Vice-President (1982–1985)==
Paz fled to exile, but returned in 1982, when the military&#x27;s experiment had run its course and the Bolivian economy was on the verge of collapse. With the reputation of the armed forces badly damaged by the excesses of the 1980–82 dictatorship, the only way out was a hasty retreat. In October 1982 the results of the 1980 elections were upheld to save the country the expense of yet another vote, and Siles was sworn in, with the MIR&#x27;s Jaime Paz as his vice-president. The economic situation was dire indeed, and soon a galloping hyperinflationary process developed. Siles had great difficulty in controlling the situation. In all fairness, he received scant support from the political parties or members of congress, most of whom were eager to flex their newly acquired political muscles after so many years of authoritarianism. The unions, led by the old firebrand Juan Lechín paralyzed the government with constant strikes. At this point, the MIR (led by Paz) disassociated itself from the regime (1984), deserting the sinking ship when Siles&#x27; popularity sank to an all-time low. The 1982-85 hyperinflation would end up being the fourth largest ever recorded in the world.

==Ideological revision (1985–1989)==
By 1985, the government&#x27;s impotence prompted Congress to call early elections, citing the fact that Siles had been originally elected five years before. Having broken with Siles, the MIR this time ran on its own, led by the ubiquitous Paz as its presidential candidate. Paz finished a respectable third, and the MNR&#x27;s Víctor Paz Estenssoro was elected president (1985–89). During the 1985–1989 period, the MIR underwent major ideological transformations, with Paz and Oscar Eid advocating a break with Marxist notions and with any call for class-based struggle. These were the days of Perestroika, and the handwriting seemed to be on the wall (so to speak) for the Eastern European totalitarianisms. The MIR&#x27;s programmatic shift entailed some major defections (most notable of which was that of Antonio Araníbar), but at least the party emerged more united and cohesive than it had been. It also had increased its electoral appeal considerably.

==The 1989 election and the &quot;Patriotic Accord&quot;==
Paz once more ran for president in May 1989. He finished third, although not far behind the top two vote-getters, Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada and former dictator Hugo Banzer. As usual, no candidate received the 50% necessary for direct election, so Congress began deliberations to choose the next Head of State. Paz had vowed to never cooperate with Banzer, who had exiled and persecuted the MIR in the 1970s. But Banzer had broken acrimoniously with the MNR of the first-place finisher Sánchez de Lozada; when the opportunity for an alliance with Banzer materialized, Paz took it. It was a move that would cost him, and the MIR, everything in the years to come. On August 5, 1989, he was elected president by Congress—thanks to the political support received from General Banzer. This seemingly unlikely MIR-ADN (Banzer) &quot;entente&quot; was officially referred to as the &quot;Patriotic Accord,&quot; with both leaders announcing the forgiveness of past enmities for the betterment of Bolivia and the consolidation of the as yet fragile democratic process. Many citizens were admired, others revolted.

==The Paz Zamora presidency (1989–1993)==
The administration of Jaime Paz was rather successful. Limited by his alliance with Banzer (and perhaps by his own new convictions), the President &quot;refrained&quot; from attempting major transformations. He opposed the complete eradication of the coca leaf, as proposed by the U.S. administration of George H. W. Bush while cooperating with the main thrust of the so-called War on Drugs. He advocated the potential medicinal and industrial use of coca, but achieved very little in the way of concrete results. His repeated pre-electoral statements about &quot;rolling back&quot; the neoliberal policies of his predecessor, Dr. Paz Estenssoro, came to nothing too, as the bulk of the privatization and de-statization reforms remained in place. All in all, Paz &quot;muddled through,&quot; Perhaps the high point of the Paz Zamora years on the domestic front had a lot to do with the president itself; it &quot;centered&quot; on the final qualification of Bolivia for the Soccer World Cup in 1993. The education, medical and general services were improved. On the other hand, corruption allegations disrupted his term; these would eventually lead to the jailing of his chief aide and MIR co-founder, Oscar Eid, for drug trafficking connections. He served his full four-year prison sentence. 
In foreign policy, Paz did successfully negotiate the cession of a sovereign port on the Peruvian coast, although without territorial continuity from Bolivian territory its benefits proved rather limited. In 1990 and in 1992 his presidency achieved to restore non-diplomatic and unofficial relationships between The Republic of Bolivia and The Republic of China (Taiwan) through representative and commercial offices in La Paz (opened in 1990) and in Taipei (opened in 1992) and vice-president Sajines personally meet with then Taiwanese president Lee Teng Hui and expressed that Sajines&#x27;visit was going to increase the economic and technical cooperation between The Republic of China (Taiwan) and The Republic of Bolivia and as well to improve the friendship relationships between the Bolivian and Taiwanese peoples.

==The debacle==
The MIR, and Paz, emerged from the 1989–93 considerably damaged, especially after Eid&#x27;s incarceration. As per the stipulations of the &quot;Patriotic Accord,&quot; the MIR supported Banzer in the 1993 presidential elections, but failed to have him elected in Congress. The MNR&#x27;s Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada was sworn in instead. Paz again ran for the top post in 1997 and in 2002, both times finishing fourth. All the while, the MIR&#x27;s presence in Congress was diluted to a fraction of what it once was. Paz&#x27;s latest participation in an election occurred in the 2005 Tarija Prefectural (the equivalent of a U.S. governorship) contest. Jaime Paz this time lost to the MNR&#x27;s candidate, a man by the name of Cossío, who had been former President of the Bolivian Congress. This seems to have brought a rather sad end to a career marked by great expectations, many corruption scandals, never proved to be right and a share of electoral defeats. Perhaps Paz sealed his own fate when he signed the 1989 accord with General Banzer. The short-term benefits (the presidency) may not have been worth the long-term losses, especially as regards to legitimacy.

<text>Prince Alexey Fyodorovich Orlov (; ) was a Russian diplomat, the natural son of Count Fyodor Grigoryevich Orlov. Born in Moscow, he took part in the Napoleonic Wars from 1805 to the capture of Paris in 1814. For his services as commander of the cavalry regiment of the Horse Life Guards during the rebellion of 1825 he was granted the title of count, and in the Turkish War of 1828–1829 he rose to the rank of lieutenant-general.

At this time his diplomatic career began. He served as the Russian plenipotentiary at the Peace of Adrianople, and in 1833 was appointed Russian ambassador at Constantinople, holding at the same time the post of commander-in-chief of the Black Sea Fleet. He became, indeed, one of the most trusted agents of Emperor Nicholas I, whom in 1837 he accompanied on his foreign tour. From 1844 to 1856 Orlov headed the infamous &quot;Third Section&quot; (secret police).

In 1854 he travelled to Vienna to bring Austria over to the side of Russia during the Crimean War of 1853–1856, but without success. In 1856 he was one of the plenipotentiaries who concluded the Peace of Paris. In the same year, raised to the dignity of prince, he was appointed president of the Imperial Council of State and of the Council of Ministers. In 1857, during the absence of Emperor Alexander II, he presided over the commission formed to consider the question of the emancipation of the serfs, to which he was altogether hostile. He died in Saint Petersburg.

==In popular culture==

Orlov was the subject of a satirical verse by Alexander Pushkin, alleging that Orlov&#x27;s mistress, the dancer Istomina, could see his penis only through a microscope.

<doc id="1025899" wikidata="Q1584969" url="?curid=1025899" title="Formica cunicularia">
<text>Formica cunicularia is a species of ant found all over Europe. They are especially common in western Europe and southern England, but they can be found from southern Scandinavia to northern Africa and from Portugal to the Urals. In England, Donisthorpe records the species as having occurred as far north as Bewdley in Worcestershire. In &quot;Formica cunicularia&quot;, the worker is an ashy grey black color and is usually 4.0–6.5 mm long. The males are found to have a uniformly dark body and are 8.0–9.0 mm long. The queen is yellowish red to dark black and is 7.5–9.0 mm.

== Habitat ==
&quot;F. cunicularia&quot; has habitat ranging from open to relatively cluttered to visually rich. In Finland, Albrecht found that all nests were small, with single entrances in dry, hot environments with low vegetation. They nest under stones or in small earth mounds. Nests are usually separate, containing one queen. &quot;F. cunicularia&quot;, unlike most other &quot;Formica&quot; &quot;fusca&quot;-group species, can form noticeable hillocks over its nests, and in addition to these produces &quot;rufibarbis&quot;-like runs in the vicinity of its nest.

== Biology ==
When found in arid and semi-arid regions, these ants feed primarily on seeds and as such, their anthills have a much higher density of seeds, but due to the seed preference of the ants there is less seed diversity. &quot;F. cunicularia&quot; will follow irregular paths while they forage, but will follow a straight path home when finished. They do this by a process called path integration where they analyze their total distance and direction on their foraging trips so that they can follow that straight path home. That isn&#x27;t the only mechanism that explains their homing behavior though. They can also find a path home based on visual cues in their surroundings. An interesting facet of their homing behavior is that they will combine these two methods when in unfamiliar terrain. &quot;F. cunicularia&quot; have the ability to discern between multiple shades of a color and they are particularly good at distinguishing two different greens; This is probably because they often live in very green rich environments. They live in small colonies of around 5000 individuals. They are predaceous but are often scavengers. Its appearance and habits ally it, to some extent, with &quot;Formica rufibarbis&quot;, although the former&#x27;s red markings are far less conspicuous. Horace Donisthorpe comments:

:Forel points out that [&quot;Formica fusca var.&quot;] &quot;rubescens&quot; [=&quot;F. cunicularia&quot;] has frequently been confounded with &quot;rufibarbis&quot;, and it is probable that some British records of ... &quot;rufibarbis&quot; really refer to this variety.

== Lichen dispersal ==

An interesting coincidence of these ants is that they help lichen disperse. Lichen has trouble on its own and the soredia of the lichen can attach to the ants by virtue of being so small. In areas where they overlap we see more of certain types of lichen growing due to the &quot;F. cunicularia&#x27;s&quot; help. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any benefit to the ants.

== As a slave species ==

&quot;F. cunicularia&quot; is a host of the slave-making ant &quot;Polyergus rufescens.&quot; Slave makers &quot;P. rufescens&quot; will raid to kill adults in the &quot;F. cunicularia&quot; colony and steal their brood to be raised to do domestic tasks. &quot;P. rufescens&quot; will choose to parasitize &quot;F. cunicularia&quot; over other choices even when available. A gland not unique to &quot;F. cunicularia&quot; is the Dufour&#x27;s gland. It is involved with many behaviors of ants, such as trail following, clustering, but also alarm and defense. When &quot;F. cunicularia&quot; daubed with extract from a slave-maker ant&#x27;s Dufour&#x27;s gland, there was a significant decrease in aggression towards invading workers. This facilitates the takeover of the hosts colony. Another possible reason for &quot;F. cunicularia&quot; being chosen as a host species more often because they don&#x27;t resist as much as other species. In an experiment involving cocoons of multiple species, they didn&#x27;t discriminate between their own and the slave-making species.
