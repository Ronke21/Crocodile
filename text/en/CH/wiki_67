<text>The KA engines were a series of four-stroke inline-four gasoline piston engines manufactured by [[Nissan]], which were offered in 2.0 and 2.4 L. The engines blocks were made of cast-iron, while the cylinder heads were made of aluminum.

Despite their large capacity, this motor was not equipped with balance shafts.

When used in the passenger cars both versions of the KA24 used a crankshaft girdle, as opposed to individual main bearing caps. In the Nissan Hardbody and Frontier applications a crank girdle was not used.

==KA20==
===KA20DE===

The KA20DE was a DOHC 16-valve engine produced from June 1999 through August 2007. It was mainly used in Japanese Domestic Market commercial vehicles.

===KA24DE===

The KA24DE was used in many Nissan cars and trucks. Most KA24DEs bound for the US were built in the city of Aguascalientes, Mexico, with the exceptions of the 240SX, 1994-97 Altima (re-badged Bluebird SSS), and the U13 Bluebird released in Australia with FWD configuration, which were manufactured in Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. The KA24DE is very similar to the KA24E. The KA24E is SOHC with three valves per cylinder actuated by rocker arms, and the KA24DE is DOHC with 4 valves per cylinder and shim-over-bucket valve actuation. Design improvements of the dual cam engine include the use of a knock sensor, larger diameter girdled main bearings in the Japanese block, different oil pan (not interchangeable between Japanese and Mexican blocks), different oil pickup (front pickup on Japanese block and side on Mexican block), dipstick location (toward the rear of block on Mexican and mid block on Japanese) and piston oil squirters. In addition to the increased power and torque, the KA24DE has a higher redline than the KA24E.

KA24DE-A is an Altima specific model of the KA24DE. The head and block are non-interchangeable between all other models and are uniquely cast for front wheel drive operation.

Differences in the Japanese block to Mexican are also present. The Mexico blocks (all DEs except those found in the S series) implemented a distributor and oil pump drive similar to the L series; from the crank nose. They also used a single row chain for the upper timing assembly without valve cover mounted guide. In addition to this, they removed the rearmost cam journal in the Mexico head. The crank rides on individually capped bearings with a slightly smaller diameter than the Japanese block, with shorter, slightly lower compression pistons in cylinders that have thicker walls than the Japanese DE. They retained the knock sensor and piston oilers.

<text>Ji Pengfei ( February 2, 1910 – February 10, 2000) was a Chinese politician.

==Biography==
Ji Pengfei was born in Linyi, Yuncheng, Shanxi in 1910. He joined the Chinese Red Army in 1931, and the Chinese Communist Party in 1933.

After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Ji Pengfei worked with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and led diplomatic missions to East Germany before being appointed as China&#x27;s first ambassador to the GDR in 1953, being the youngest Chinese ambassador at 43. He was recalled to serve as vice-minister of Foreign Affairs in 1955.

When the Cultural Revolution broke out, he was initially targeted as member of the counter-revolutionary clique ruling the Foreign Ministry, along with Chen Yi and Qiao Guanhua. Nevertheless, he was relatively untouched as he remained at his post. After Chen Yi died in 1972, Ji Pengfei succeeded him as Foreign Minister until 1974, and was elected CCP Central Committee member. He was appointed secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress in 1975, and confirmed in 1978. In 1972, he signed Japan-China Joint Communiqué with Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka and Foreign Minister Masayoshi Ohira of Japan.

In the post-Cultural Revolution period, Ji Pengfei held several posts. In 1979 he was appointed head of the International Liaison Department of the CCP Central Committee, then vice premier and secretary-general of the State Council from 1980 to 1982, and finally head of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office. He also served as Standing Committee member of the Central Advisory Commission, a Party body aimed at helping the retirement of elder officials.

In 1999, his son, Ji Shengde, a senior member of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army intelligence, was arrested and tried for corruption, selling classified information and diverting public funds, and was sentenced to death penalty. The penalty was commuted to 20 years in prison, when he returned stolen money and denounce other abuses.

Ji Pengfei was praised by the Xinhua News Agency as an outstanding communist fighter, and greatly lauded again in 2010 at a ceremony in the Great Hall of the People to celebrate his 100th birth anniversary.

<doc id="1030925" wikidata="Q798487" url="?curid=1030925" title="Backing vocalist">
<text>A backing vocalist is a singer who provides vocal harmony with the lead vocalist or other backing vocalists. A backing vocalist may also sing alone as a lead-in to the main vocalist&#x27;s entry or to sing a counter-melody. Backing vocalists are used in a broad range of popular music, traditional music, and world music styles.

Solo artists may employ professional backing vocalists in studio recording sessions as well as during concerts. In many rock and metal bands (e.g., the power trio), the musicians doing backing vocals also play instruments, such as guitar, electric bass or keyboards. In Latin or Afro-Cuban groups, backing singers may play percussion instruments or shakers while singing. In some pop and hip-hop groups and in musical theater, they may be required to perform dance routines while singing through headset microphones.

Styles of background vocals vary according to the type of song and genre of music. In pop and country songs, backing vocalists may sing harmony to support the lead vocalist. In hardcore punk or rockabilly, other band members who play instruments may sing or shout backing vocals during the chorus (refrain) section of the songs.

== Terminology ==

Alternative terms for backing vocalists include &quot;backing singer&quot;, &quot;backing vocals&quot;, &quot;additional vocals&quot; or, particularly in the United States and Canada, &quot;backup singer,&quot; &quot;background singer&quot;, or &quot;harmony&quot;.

== Examples ==

While some bands use performers whose sole on-stage role is backing vocals, backing singers commonly have other roles. Two notable examples of band members who sang back-up are The Beach Boys and The Beatles. The Beach Boys were well known for their close vocal harmonies, occasionally with all five members singing at once such as &quot;In My Room&quot; and &quot;Surfer Girl&quot;.

The Beatles were also known for their close style of vocal harmonies – all of them sang both lead and backing vocals at some point, especially John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who frequently supported each other with harmonies, often with fellow Beatle George Harrison joining in. Ringo Starr, while not as prominent as a backup singer due to his distinctive voice, sings backing vocals in such tracks as &quot;The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill&quot; and &quot;Carry That Weight&quot;. Examples of three-part harmonies by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison include &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, &quot;Because&quot;, &quot;Day Tripper&quot;, and &quot;This Boy&quot;.
The members of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young and Bee Gees each wrote songs, sang backup or lead vocals, and played various instruments in their performances and recordings.

== Lyrics ==
In the lyrics, the backing vocals are standardly written in parentheses to differentiate them from the main vocals, which are written without any markup. The backing vocals for a line may come in mid-line, or even after the main lyrics have already been sung. Vocalizing is fairly common so as to not detract from the meaning of the lyrics of the primary vocals. The sound of the backing vocals is often in a differing style (e.g., either more muted or pitched up) so as to complement rather than compete with the main parts.

== Lead singers who record backing vocals ==

In the recording studio, some lead singers record their own backing vocals by overdubbing with a multitrack recording system, record their own backing vocals, then recording the lead part over them. Some lead vocalists prefer this approach because multiple parts recorded by the same singer blend well.

A famous example overdubbing is Freddie Mercury&#x27;s multipart intro to Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. Other artists who have recorded multitrack lead and backing vocals include Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy, Tom DeLonge of Blink-182 and Angels and Airwaves, Wednesday 13 in his own band and Murderdolls, Ian Gillan of Deep Purple, Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco, Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran, and Brad Delp of Boston.

With the exception of a few songs on each album, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Prince, Dan Fogelberg, Eddie Rabbitt, David Bowie, Harry Nilsson, and Richard Marx sing all of the background vocals for their songs. Robert Smith of the Cure sings his own backing vocals in the studio, and doesn&#x27;t use backing vocalists when performing live.

== Uncredited backing vocals ==

Prominent vocalists who provide backing vocals in other artists&#x27; recordings are often uncredited to avoid conflicts with their own recording agreements, and for other reasons. Examples include:

* &quot;Roll with Me, Henry&quot; by Etta James, which includes Richard Berry, author of &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, performing the role of Henry.
* Sam Cooke&#x27;s &quot;Bring It On Home to Me&quot;, with vocal &quot;echo&quot; responses by Lou Rawls.
* John Lennon and Paul McCartney on the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;We Love You&quot;.
* Ronnie Spector on Eddie Money&#x27;s &quot;Take Me Home Tonight&quot;, from the Ronettes&#x27; 1963 hit &quot;Be My Baby&quot;.
* Mick Jagger doing background vocals on Carly Simon&#x27;s recording of &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot;, which led to the erroneous theory that the song was about Jagger.
* Paul McCartney as one of the background revellers on Donovan&#x27;s 1966 &quot;Mellow Yellow&quot;. (Contrary to popular belief, McCartney does not whisper &quot;quite rightly&quot; in the chorus, but Donovan himself).
* Andrew Gold&#x27;s &quot;Never Let Her Slip Away&quot;, with harmony vocals by Freddie Mercury.
* Jonathan Richman&#x27;s &quot;The Neighbors&quot;, featuring Jody Ross.
* Rockwell&#x27;s &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Watching Me&quot;, with backing vocals by Jermaine Jackson and Michael Jackson.
* &quot;Bad Blood&quot; by Neil Sedaka, with backing vocals by Elton John.
* Patti LaBelle on Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Roses&quot; from the album &quot;Late Registration&quot;. She said the liner notes were already printed when she lent her vocals to the track.

<text>Ryan William Nelsen (born 18 October 1977) is a former New Zealand professional football player and former head coach of Major League Soccer side Toronto FC.

Nelsen commonly played as a defender, and his professional career began in 1995. He notably captained the New Zealand national team and started his professional football career in his native country for Christchurch United. In 2001, he joined MLS side D.C. United and went on to play 81 times in the league, scoring 7 goals. In 2005, he moved to England with Premier League side Blackburn Rovers where he scored 8 times in 172 appearances. In 2012, he made a move to Tottenham Hotspur but only managed 5 appearances (scoring once in an FA Cup tie against Bolton Wanderers, the re-arranged match following Fabrice Muamba&#x27;s cardiac arrest) before joining Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2012. He agreed to return to MLS on 8 January 2013 by signing with Toronto FC as head coach. He was fired from Toronto FC on 31 August 2014.

==Early life==
After attending Our Lady of the Assumption primary school and St Thomas of Canterbury College, he moved to the United States to play for Greensboro College in North Carolina in 1997. After spending two years at Greensboro and leading The Pride to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III championship match, only to lose to Ohio Wesleyan University, he transferred to Stanford University where he played his final two years of college football. He was named Stanford&#x27;s Most Valuable Player as a junior and an NSCAA All-American as a senior while playing as a defensive midfielder. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science.

==Club career==
===Christchurch United===
Nelsen played for Christchurch United from 1995 to 1998. Even after he relocated to the United States, he played his last season with the club when he was home for a semester&#x27;s sabbatical from his university football scholarship with Greensboro College.

===DC United===
Nelsen was drafted fourth overall in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft by D.C. United, with whom he spent four years in Major League Soccer (MLS). After emerging as a starter in 2002, Nelsen was named team captain in 2003, replacing Marco Etcheverry, as well as winning the team&#x27;s Defender of the Year Award and being named to the league&#x27;s Best XI. Again, in 2004 after leading United to its fourth MLS Cup, he was named the Best XI. In four years in MLS, Nelsen had seven goals and five assists.

===Blackburn Rovers===
Nelsen was signed by Blackburn Rovers on a free transfer in January 2005, shortly after the completion of the 2004 MLS season. In the summer of 2005, after just six months at the club, Nelsen signed a new three-year contract after impressing manager Mark Hughes and helping to turn Blackburn&#x27;s defence into one of the toughest in the Premiership. Nelsen was successfully awarded a work permit on appeal after the initial application had been refused due to New Zealand being ranked outside the top seventy in the FIFA World Rankings.

In the 2005–06 season, Blackburn qualified for the UEFA Cup with a sixth-place finish, but Nelsen missed the last few games after breaking his foot in a 2–0 win at Charlton Athletic. Nevertheless, his performances since arriving in England prompted much interest from rival clubs including Portsmouth, whose bid for Nelsen was rejected by Blackburn. On 1 February 2006, he started and played the full ninety minutes alongside Andy Todd in a 4–3 league victory over Manchester United at Ewood Park.

Nelsen was dealt with another blow before the start of the 2006–07 season, with a serious hamstring injury forcing him out until the new year. On his return to the team in an FA Cup fourth round win against Luton Town, he was immediately made captain. In July 2007, he signed a new five-year deal with the club until the summer of 2012. He scored his first league goal for Blackburn with a header against Wigan Athletic on 26 April 2009 in a 2–0 win which helped Blackburn stay in the Premier League for another season. He then scored his second Premier League goal against Portsmouth with a header from a corner taken by David Dunn on 7 November 2009, and has also scored goals against Birmingham City and Fulham. On 11 April 2010, Nelsen came on for the injured Christopher Samba against Manchester United at Ewood Park in a 0–0 draw. Nelsen made his 175th appearance for Blackburn Rovers, leading the team in a 3–2 defeat to Everton at Ewood Park on 17 April 2010. In all competitions, Nelsen made a total of thirty-three appearances and scored four goals in the 2009–10 season.

On 13 November 2010, he scored against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane for his first goal of the 2010–11 Premier League season. On 27 November, he played the full ninety minutes partnering Christopher Samba, but this time in a 7–1 rout against Manchester United at Old Trafford. He then added his second and third goals of the campaign by scoring against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 4 December in a 3–0 win and against West Ham United on 18 December in a 1–1 draw.

With Blackburn&#x27;s tenth successive Premier League season, and their seventeenth in nineteen seasons, now underway, Nelsen welcomed the club&#x27;s proposed takeover by Indian owned Venky&#x27;s Group who has promised up to £100 million for Sam Allardyce to spend on strengthening the squad – with Nelsen feeling that the squad could do with &quot;freshing up.&quot; On 15 January 2011, he made his 200th appearance for Blackburn in the away game against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

Nelsen signed a two-year contract extension with Rovers in late January 2011 which would keep him at the club until the summer of 2013. Under Steve Kean as manager following the sacking of Sam Allardyce, Nelsen was relieved as team captain of Blackburn in favour of Christopher Samba, Nelsen moving to vice-captain. Nelsen suffered a knee injury forcing him to miss the rest of the 2010–11 season. Following the 2010–11 season, in which Blackburn avoided relegation, Nelsen recovered from the knee injury and made one appearance against Aston Villa in a 3–1 loss.

After fully recovering from his knee injury Nelsen was released from Blackburn on the transfer deadline day 31 January 2012 to sign for Tottenham Hotspur by Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Nelsen was signed by Tottenham Hotspur on a free transfer on 2 February 2012, to replace defender Sébastien Bassong, who joined Wolves on loan. He was given the number 33 shirt. He made his debut for Tottenham on 11 February 2012 in the Premier League match against Newcastle United, when he replaced Ledley King in the seventy-fourth minute.

Nelsen made his first starting debut on 19 February 2012 against Stevenage in their FA Cup tie.

He scored his first goal for Tottenham Hotspur on 27 March 2012 in the seventy-fourth minute of an FA Cup tie against Bolton Wanderers in a replay of a previous game, due to Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba having a cardiac arrest in the first tie. Tottenham Hotspur won the match 3–1 that day.

On 25 May 2012, he was released by Tottenham with fellow January signing Louis Saha. He made eight appearances scoring one goal.

===Queens Park Rangers===
On 18 June 2012, it was announced that Ryan Nelsen had signed a one-year deal with Queens Park Rangers. He scored the first goal with Rangers against Wigan Athletic heading the ball equalising the score to 1–1.

It was announced on 8 January 2013 that Nelsen had signed for Canadian MLS side Toronto FC as the club&#x27;s new head coach. However, he remained under contract with QPR and was in negotiations with their management regarding his release to take up the Toronto position.

It was announced on 22 January 2013 that Nelsen would play his last game for QPR against 
Manchester City at Loftus Road on 29 January and would join Toronto FC on 1 February. He played his last match for Queens Park Rangers on 29 January in a 0–0 draw against English champions, Manchester City, and was given a guard of honour by his teammates after the game.

==International career==
Nelsen made his New Zealand debut against Poland on 19 June 1999. He was part of the All Whites&#x27; winning squad in the 2002 OFC Nations Cup, scoring the only goal of a 1–0 win over rivals Australia in the final.

Although he has been selected to play on numerous occasions, Nelsen had not represented New Zealand between his last appearance in 2004 and 2008 due largely to a recurring hamstring injury.
Nelsen captained the New Zealand U-23 squad for their first appearance at the Olympic Games against China. Although he was only available for the opening two matches as Blackburn had requested that he return in time to prepare for their opening Premier League game of the 2008–09 season against Everton.
Nelsen captained the All Whites side as they qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, beating Bahrain in a two-legged playoff in November 2009.

On 10 May 2010, Nelsen was named in New Zealand&#x27;s final 23-man squad to compete at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

On 15 June, 28 years to the day after New Zealand made their second appearance in a FIFA World Cup Finals, their first since 1982, Nelsen captained New Zealand to their first ever point in a FIFA World Cup Finals match in a 1–1 draw with World Cup debutants Slovakia. On 24 June, Nelsen again skippered the All Whites in a 0–0 draw with Paraguay, but New Zealand were knocked out of the group stages. However, it is surely indisputable that New Zealand&#x27;s biggest honour was to draw 1–1 with Italy, who were the reigning champions.

Nelsen was named in a football &quot;World Cup Best XI&quot; by American sports channel, ESPN on 10 July 2010.

==Coaching career==
On 8 January 2013 Nelsen accepted an offer to become head coach of Major League Soccer side Toronto FC. He started on 1 February in time for Toronto&#x27;s pre-season. Nelsen won his first game as a head coach in the home opener against Sporting Kansas City in a 2–1 victory on 9 March, with both goals coming from newly acquired striker Robert Earnshaw. He was sacked, along with his assistants, on 31 August 2014 after winning three out of his last 13 matches.

==Writing career==
Nelsen and New Zealand author Tony Smith co-wrote the book &quot;Ryan Nelsen&#x27;s Road to the World Cup&quot;.

==GA16==

===GA16S===

The GA16S is a SOHC engine with a bore and stroke of . The GA16S has twelve valves, solid valve rockers, and is fitted with a carburetor. It produces (without a catalyst). For some markets, such as South Africa, there was also an eight-valve version which produces at 5500 rpm. In the New Zealand market N13 Sentra, it produces at 6000 rpm and at 3200 rpm, with a compression ratio of 9.4:1.

===GA16DS===
The GA16DS is a carbureted only engine with a 16-valve DOHC head. Models equipped with a catalyst use the electronically controlled carburetor. It produces between and . Without catalyst produces .

;Applications:
* 1990-1993 Nissan Primera P10
* 1990-1993 Nissan Sunny N14
* 1990-1993 Nissan 100NX B13
* 1990-1997 Nissan Avenir Cargo
* 1992-1996 Nissan Bluebird U13

This engine was also fitted to the Nissan Sunny B13 from Japan, called the EX Saloon.

===GA16i===

The GA16i is a throttle-body fuel-injected engine produced from August 1987 through June 1990, which produces . It is a single-cam, 12-valve design, with manually adjustable rocker arms. 1989 and 1990 North-American market Sentras and European N13 Sunnys received the hydraulic-rocker version which produced and of torque.

Applications:
* 1989-1990 Nissan Sentra
* 1989-1990 Nissan Pulsar

===GA16E===

The GA16E is a multi-point fuel injected SOHC engine. It produces .

===GA16DE===


The GA16DE is a engine produced from November 1990 through 1999. All GA16DEs have 16 valves and a DOHC head. There are three versions: the North-American first-generation (1991–1994) NVCS (VTC), which produces at 6000 rpm and at 4000 rpm, the North-American second-generation (1995-1999) NVCS (VTC), which produces at 6000 rpm and at 4000 rpm, and a European non-NVCS (VTC) version which makes .

The two variants of the North American NVCS engine are distinguished as such: in addition to differences in the intake manifolds and (resultantly) the heads, earlier motors used pistons with two compression rings and a single oil ring and put out five less horsepower, while later GA16DEs have a single compression ring and a single oil ring. Some engines have siamesed exhaust manifolds, while others keep the exhausts separated until the catalytic converter.

The GA16DE shares its block and crankshaft with the GA16i; however, their timing chain covers, connecting rods and pistons are different. Despite this, it is possible to interchange connecting-rod/piston assemblies between the GA16i and GA16DE with no damage to the valve-train.

Earlier ECUs contained the fuel &amp; ignition maps on a discrete ROM microcontroller, making retuning relatively easy. Later ECUs integrated the maps onto a larger, more integrated microcontroller&#x27;s firmware, making retuning require the use of a daughterboard.

Applications:
* 1993-1996 Nissan NX1600 B13
* 1991-1994 Nissan Sentra B13
* 1994-1995 Nissan 100NX B13 (UK)
* 1991-1994 Nissan Presea R10

* 1993-1999 Nissan Primera P10/P11
* 10/1992-07/1995 Nissan Sunny Traveller N14 / Nissan Wingroad Y10
* 1999-2001 Nissan Exalta Philippines
* 1995-1999 Nissan Vanette Cargo.

===GA16DNE===

The GA16DNE is a Mexican-specification engine, which produces . The main differences between the DE and DNE are no NVCS (VTC) and no ECCS plenum. The DNE has a vertical throttle body with an MAF inside; the air filter is diagonally oriented in its air filter housing. Since 2003, the DNE comes with a new ECU and 3 oxygen sensors.

The &quot;N&quot; in its nomenclature stands for &quot;New EGI&quot; (emission system), since this engine does not have an EGR system like the GA16DE. Other Nissan engines with the &quot;N&quot; nomenclature are natural gas powered.

Applications:
* 1998-2004 Nissan Tsubame Y10 (Mexico)
* 1996-2000 Nissan Sentra B14

<doc id="1030937" wikidata="Q14786283" url="?curid=1030937" title="Bit part">
<text>In acting, a bit part is a role in which there is direct interaction with the principal actors and no more than five lines of dialogue, often referred to as a five-or-less or under-five in the United States, or under sixes in British television, or a walk-on part with no dialogue.

A bit part is a credited higher billing than that of an extra and lower than that of a supporting actor. An actor who regularly performs in bit roles, either as a hobby or to earn a living, is referred to as a bit player, which is also a term to describe an aspiring actor who has not yet broken into supporting or leading roles.

Unlike extras, who do not typically interact with principals, actors in bit parts are sometimes listed in the credits. An exception to this practice is the cameo appearance, wherein a well-known actor or other celebrity appears in a bit part; it is common for such appearances to be uncredited.

In MGM&#x27;s 1951 screen version of the musical &quot;Show Boat&quot;, the role of the cook Queenie (Frances E. Williams) was reduced from a significant supporting role in the stage version to a bit part in the film. Williams, whose appearance was not intended as a cameo, was not listed at all in the credits. On the other hand, William Warfield, whose role as Joe, Queenie&#x27;s husband, was also drastically shortened in the film from the stage original, did receive screen credit because he sang &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;.

Bit parts are often significant in the story line and sometimes pivotal, as in Jack Albertson&#x27;s role as a postal worker in the 1947 feature film &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;. Some characters with bit parts attract significant attention. Konstantin Stanislavski remarked that &quot;there are no small parts, only small actors&quot;.

Dabbs Greer, a bit actor, once said: &quot;Every character actor, in their own little sphere, is the lead&quot;.

<text>Patrick Philippe Moraz (born 24 June 1948) is a Swiss musician, film composer and songwriter, best known for his tenures as keyboardist in the rock bands Yes and the Moody Blues.

Born into a musical family, Moraz learned music at a young age and studied at the Lausanne Conservatory. He began a music career in the 1960s as a jazz musician, performing with his quartet and quintet, groups that performed across Europe and won several awards. He formed the short-lived progressive rock group Mainhorse in 1969, and began work scoring films. In 1974, he formed another band, Refugee, and recorded one album before he joined Yes later the same year. Moraz was a member of Yes until 1976, and during this time he also started a solo career.

Moraz was a member of the Moody Blues from 1978 to 1991. Since then, he has worked on various solo projects.

==Early life==
Moraz was born on 24 June 1948 on an aeroplane, though Morges, Switzerland, has been cited as his hometown. He was born in to a musical family; his father used to work for Polish pianist and composer Ignacy Jan Paderewski. He has a sister, Patricia. As a child, Moraz played the violin, piano, and percussion and wrote compositions for the piano at the age of five. He studied jazz and classical music until his development came to an abrupt halt at thirteen after he broke four fingers in a roller skating accident. He recalled, &quot;I was told I could never play classical music again&quot;. Following a course of therapy and a considerable amount of practice with his left hand playing, Moraz was able to regain his technique, becoming ambidextrous in the process. Initially, Moraz wished to be an anthropologist and learned to speak Greek and Latin. Instead he chose to pursue music and studied in Lausanne at the Lausanne Conservatory, where he studied with Clara Haskil and, while in Paris, Nadia Boulanger. At sixteen, Moraz became the youngest person to receive the Best Soloist award at the Zürich jazz festival. Moraz went on to win awards at the festival, as a solo artist or in his jazz groups, for five consecutive years. In 1964, Moraz spent his summer in Cadaqués, Spain as a scuba diving instructor and spent time with Salvador Dalí at his property in Portlligat where he organised and performed at several gatherings for his guests.

At seventeen, Moraz&#x27;s playing as a jazz soloist at a music festival earned him a prize of a collection of albums and some lessons with French jazz soloist Stéphane Grappelli who taught him &quot;all I needed to know about jazz and rock&quot;. Moraz also spent time performing in several countries in Africa. In November 1964, Moraz left Switzerland for England, a place he always wanted to visit and perform. Not knowing the English language, he arrived in Bournemouth where he stayed for six months. Prior to his travels, Moraz&#x27;s father offered him work as a chef in Switzerland in one of his kitchens that he managed, with the hope of using the skill to work in England. Moraz cooked at a school for a £2.88 salary (equivalent to £ in 2025)., calling it &quot;one of the hardest jobs I ever had&quot;. He played the piano in a local pub and tea room for more money. However, he was kicked out of the Musicians&#x27; Union because he took up employment as a bar pianist with an incorrect type of work visa. The director of the union then spotted him playing in a restaurant, causing Moraz to leave the country and cancel proposals to jam with a Bournemouth group, the Night People. He also worked by selling encyclopaedias in Geneva. In 1965, Moraz&#x27;s quartet won an award at the Zürich jazz festival, and was soon invited to be the opening act for a European tour headlined by American saxophonist John Coltrane.

==Career==

===1969–1974: Mainhorse and Refugee===
Moraz returned to England in 1969 when he auditioned potential players for a new progressive rock band, Mainhorse. He wished for a drummer who could play like John Bonham, Buddy Rich, odd time signatures and the blues, and tried out &quot;like 250 drummers&quot; in the process. He settled with a line-up of Jean Ristori on vocals and bass, Bryson Graham on drums, and Peter Lockett on vocals and guitar. They signed with Polydor Records and recorded their only studio album, &quot;Mainhorse&quot; (1971), at De Lane Lea Studios, later purchased by Ian Gillan of Deep Purple in Kingsway, London. The album was not a commercial success, but the group secured work by performing at gigs in Germany. Moraz took up further work as a film composer on &quot;The Salamander&quot; (1971).

After touring Japan and Hong Kong as a musical director for a Brazilian ballet, Moraz returned to Switzerland in 1973. He recorded further film music for &quot;The Invitation&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Middle of the World&quot; (1974). In the summer, Moraz received a call from Lee Jackson, guitarist and singer of Jackson Heights, asking him if he was interested in joining Jackson Heights. Moraz had jammed with Jackson&#x27;s previous band, The Nice, in 1969 when they played in Switzerland. Moraz refused, and counter-offered that they form a new band with former Nice member Brian Davison on drums. The band, Refugee, signed with Charisma Records and released &quot;Refugee&quot; (1974), written and arranged by Moraz and Jackson. The group developed a tight sound by practising for at least eight hours each day. Refugee supported the album with a tour.

===1974–1978: Yes and start of solo career===
Upon his arrival from Geneva working on a film score for Gerard Depardieu, Moraz was asked to join Yes, following the departure of Rick Wakeman in May 1974. The band had begun work on &quot;Relayer&quot; (1974), their seventh album, in Virginia Water, Surrey, and sought potential replacements. Moraz had seen the band perform during their tour of Switzerland in 1969. After a try-out with Greek musician Vangelis, which proved unsuccessful following musical union issues and his unwillingness to travel, music reporter Chris Welch suggested to the band&#x27;s manager, Brian Lane, that they ask Moraz. Though he regretted splitting with his Refugee bandmates, Moraz accepted the position as it was an opportunity that he thought would benefit his career, though he once said, &quot;I felt it was time to leave&quot;. Moraz&#x27;s audition occurred in the first week of August 1974 with Vangelis&#x27;s keyboards, which were still set up in the rehearsal room. After tuning up, Moraz watched the band play the middle section of &quot;Sound Chaser&quot;, which he said was &quot;Absolutely unbelievable. To experience that – the truest surround experience I had ever encountered as an observer and listener&quot;. He was then asked to come up with an opening to it, and what he played ended up on the album.

After his successful audition, Moraz learned their repertoire across seven albums for the &quot;Relayer&quot; tour, which began in November 1974. When the tour ended in August 1975, Yes took an extended break so each member could produce a solo album. Charisma Records released Moraz&#x27;s first album as a solo artist, which, due to its title consisting of a symbol which does not appear on standard keyboards, has since become commonly known as &quot;The Story of I&quot; (1976). Since working with the Brazilian ballet, he became interested in percussion and travelled to Colombia, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina for inspiration, and arrived in Brazil where he gathered &quot;a very, very strong unit of 16 percussionists&quot; to play on his album. Moraz invited synthesizer inventor Bob Moog to contribute sounds on the album; Moog accepted the task, and worked with him for several weeks. During this time Moraz also played on Steve Howe&#x27;s album &quot;Beginnings&quot; (1975) and Chris Squire&#x27;s album &quot;Fish Out of Water&quot; (1975). Moraz travelled to Brazil and incorporated Brazilian rhythms and musicians on &quot;The Story of I&quot;, giving it a world music flavour. Afterward he reconvened with Yes for their 1976 North American tour, where the band headlined several large concerts.

After the 1976 tour, Yes retreated from UK tax collectors to Montreux, Switzerland, to record their next album, &quot;Going for the One&quot; (1977). Some of the material had already been worked out by the time of their arrival; this included contributions to &quot;Awaken&quot;, &quot;Wonderous Stories&quot; and &quot;Parallels&quot; from Moraz. However, during the early sessions, Moraz was told to leave in order to allow Wakeman to return to the band. Moraz spoke about his departure: &quot;Even though, at the time, the split &#x27;was not made to appear acrimonious&#x27;, I suffered extremely and extensively. To be &#x27;asked to leave&#x27; so suddenly put me in a lot of turmoil and disturbance ... I was never compensated for anything. I never ever got paid for any of my tour participation in the ... tour of 1976 ... I was entitled to a 20% cut from what the band was getting.&quot; In 2014, Chris Squire would suggest that a lack of a musical bond between Moraz and Steve Howe was the main artistic reason for Moraz and Yes parting company.

Moraz continued with his solo career and Charisma released his second album, &quot;Out in the Sun&quot; (1977), which he wanted to sound &quot;completely different and more liberated&quot;. He then moved to Brazil for a year and a half, and prepared material for his third album. He wanted to title the album &quot;Primitivization&quot;, but the record company chose to release it as &quot;Patrick Moraz&quot; (1978). During his time in Brazil, Moraz joined a Brazilian rock band, Vimana, with Lobão and Lulu Santos and Ritchie. He also recorded the keyboards in one of the most iconic songs of Brazilian music, &quot;Avohai&quot; by Zé Ramalho.

===1978–1991: The Moody Blues and solo projects===
In May 1978, Moraz visited a convention held by the Audio Engineering Society in Los Angeles, where Herbie Hancock taught him vocoder, and agreed to represent Aphex Systems in Brazil. On his way back to Brazil, Moraz stopped in Miami as he had some free time. At the hotel, he received a call asking him to join the Moody Blues after Mike Pinder left the band. Moraz proceeded to sing &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; and &quot;Tuesday Afternoon&quot; on the phone, and accepted an audition in London in July 1978. Before his arrival, Moraz performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival with Brazilian musicians Airto Moreira and Gilberto Gil. The audition with the Moody Blues was successful, and Moraz &quot;Got the gig that very afternoon&quot;.

Moraz toured with the Moody Blues in support of their ninth album, &quot;Octave&quot; (1978), which began in late 1978. Their next album, &quot;Long Distance Voyager&quot; (1981), became the band&#x27;s biggest hit, reaching No. 1 in the US. This was followed by &quot;The Present&quot; (1983), &quot;The Other Side of Life&quot; (1986), and &quot;Sur la Mer&quot; (1988).

During his tenure with the Moody Blues, Moraz completed several solo projects. He toured with his group from Brazil, recorded with Chick Corea, and released two albums with drummer Bill Bruford as Moraz-Bruford. The two toured worldwide between 1983 and 1985. In May 1986, he worked on some &quot;temporary cues&quot; and &quot;not the final scores&quot; to the soundtrack to &quot;Predator&quot; (1987) and &quot;Wild Orchid&quot; (1989). The project gave him the opportunity to visit the filming of &quot;Predator&quot; in Mexico, and to meet Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mickey Rourke. However, Moraz could not fully complete the score for &quot;Predator&quot; because of an upcoming tour with the Moody Blues, leaving Alan Silvestri to compose the rest. He also operated Aquarius Studios in Geneva with Ristori. Moraz performed the score to &quot;The Stepfather&quot; (1987).

During the recording for &quot;Keys of the Kingdom&quot; (1991), Moraz was interviewed for &quot;Keyboard&quot; magazine. He expressed a feeling that The Moody Blues&#x27; music had become too confined and that the group had become stagnant, offering &quot;no musical challenge&quot;. The other members, he thought, were unwilling to use his musical compositions and claimed his only composition during his 13 years with them was &quot;half a song with the drummer&quot;. Before the Moody Blues toured the album, Moraz was fired from the band. In September 1991, Moraz sued the group for $500,000 as well as wrongful dismissal, claiming the group decided to split their profits four ways instead of five, and wished to be paid royalties he felt were owed to him as a full-time member of the band for almost 15 years. However, the group maintained Moraz was only a hired musician, despite his name being listed as a member on their albums and promotional materials and his appearing in official band photographs. On December 28, 1992, the jury in the case, aired on &quot;Court TV&quot;, awarded Moraz $77,175 from the defendants. Moraz had been offered $400,000 before the lawsuit.

===1991–present: Solo career===
After his dismissal from the Moody Blues, Moraz has primarily concentrated on solo projects. His first of three piano albums, &quot;Windows of Time&quot; (1994), was recorded in a studio at Full Sail University in Florida. A total of fourteen hours of material was recorded which was cut to exactly one hour. Moraz then spent the next four years developing &quot;hundreds of pieces of music for all instruments, as well as orchestras and choirs&quot;, producing several artists, and completed work for the Conference on World Affairs, of which he is an official delegate. He also wished to tour &quot;Windows of Time&quot;, but thought the style of the music would suffer in a traditional concert setting.

In late 1994, Moraz began a piano tour of the US and Europe with his Coming Home, America Tour (CHAT), which saw him perform at private or semi-private venues for an $800 flat fee, booked entirely by fans through the Internet. One show saw him perform for a couple in their home. The tour ended in November 1995 for a total of 92 performances. One of them was recorded and released as &quot;PM in Princeton&quot; (1995) for CD and video. In 1997, Moraz started work on a new album, &quot;A Way to Freedom&quot;, featuring arrangements for a symphony orchestra, percussionists, and a jazz brass band. The project remains a work in progress. From 1998 to 2000, Moraz worked almost exclusively on his second piano album &quot;Resonance&quot; (2000), which, like &quot;Windows of Time&quot;, was cut to exactly one hour of music. He also performed at a benefit concert at the request of poet José Ramos-Horta.

By 2001, Moraz had continued with several projects, including researching and preparing film scripts, including one for a potential film adaptation of &quot;The Story of I&quot;. He released his third piano album, the classically influenced &quot;ESP&quot; (2003), short for &quot;Etudes, Sonatas and Preludes&quot;. In 2012, he issued a compilation of tracks from the three piano albums titled &quot;PianissiMoraz&quot; (2012).

In 2011, Moraz guested on an album by Panorama Syndicate entitled &quot;Skyline&quot;, playing piano on the title track.

In April 2014, Moraz took part in the annual progressive rock-themed cruise voyage Cruise to the Edge as a solo artist. In 2015, Moraz and drummer Greg Alban formed the Moraz Alban Project and released a studio album &quot;The M.A.P. Project&quot; (2015), featuring percussionist Lenny Castro, saxophonist Dave Van Such, bassists John Avila and Patrick Perrier, and Counting Crows bassist Matt Malley. Moraz and Alban met in 1983 and Alban played drums on Moraz&#x27;s album &quot;Time Code&quot; (1984). The project was an Alban solo endeavour at first, with Moraz contributing to the music, but it grew to feature numerous other musicians with the music written around the drums and keyboards. In November 2015, Moraz released a limited edition 19-CD box set of his 18 albums, including &quot;Mainhorse&quot; (1971), &quot;The Story of I&quot; (1976) and the live album &quot;Music for Piano and Drums: Live in Maryland&quot; (2012).

Moraz took part in his second Cruise to the Edge voyage in February 2017.

Moraz reunited with Yes in July 2018. As part of Yes&#x27; 50th Anniversary tour, Moraz performed with Yes at two shows in Philadelphia, July 20 and 21. At each show, Moraz played keys during the band&#x27;s performance of &quot;Soon&quot;. Moraz also appeared during the Yes FanFest before the July 21 show, at first performing a 70-minute solo piano show and then appearing on stage with Yes and taking part in a band interview.

== Personal life ==
Moraz lives in Florida with his second wife, Phyllis, and spends some time in his native Switzerland. He has one son, David, and a daughter, Rana, with first wife Diane.

<text> (Sanskrit; ) is a Buddhist term commonly translated as &quot;energy&quot;, &quot;diligence&quot;, &quot;enthusiasm&quot;, &quot;effort&quot; or &quot;heroism&quot; &quot;help&quot;. It can be defined as an attitude of gladly engaging in wholesome activities, and it functions to cause one to accomplish wholesome or virtuous actions.

==Etymology==
 literally means &quot;state of a strong human&quot; or &quot;manliness.&quot; In Vedic literature, the term is associated with heroism and virility.

In Buddhism, refers to a practitioner&#x27;s &quot;energy&quot;, &quot;persistence&quot;, &quot;persevering,&quot; &quot;vigour&quot;, &quot;effort&quot;, &quot;diligence&quot;, or &quot;exertion&quot;, and is repeatedly identified as a necessary prerequisite for achieving liberation.

==Mental factor==
Within the Buddhist Abhidharma teachings, is identified as:
*One of the six occasional mental factors within the Theravada Abhidharma 
*One of the eleven virtuous mental factors within the Mahayana Abhidharma

In this context, is defined as the attitude of gladly engaging in what is wholesome; its function is to cause one to accomplish wholesome actions.

The Abhidharma-samuccaya states: 
:What is ? It is the mind intent on being ever active, devoted, unshaken, not turning back and being indefatigable. It perfects and realizes what is conducive to the positive.

In the context of the Mahayana Abhidharma, is commonly translated as diligence.

==Pali literature==
In Buddhism&#x27;s Pali literature, is identified as critical component in each of the following sets of qualities conducive to Enlightenment ():
:*the five spiritual faculties ()
:*the five powers ()
:*the ten or six &quot;perfections&quot; ()
:*the seven factors of enlightenment (). 
It is also associated with &quot;Right Effort&quot; () of the Noble Eightfold Path (Pāli: ; Skt.: ) and with the &quot;Four Right Exertions&quot; ().

In the &quot;Kīṭāgiri Sutta&quot; (MN 70), the Buddha instructs his followers:
:... For a faithful disciple who is intent on fathoming the Teacher&#x27;s Dispensation, it is natural that he conduct himself thus: &#x27;Willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry up on my body, but my energy [Pali: ] shall not be relaxed so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength [], manly energy [], and manly persistence []...&quot;

==Other characterizations==
 stands for strenuous and sustained effort to overcome unskillful ways (), such as indulging in sensuality, ill will and harmfulness (see, e.g., and ).

 can also be aroused by strong feelings of and the practice of the charnel ground meditations as outlined in the Satipatthana sutta.

It stands for the right endeavour to attain .

 can also signify courage and physical strength and was cultivated by Buddhist guardians including the Shaolin monks. It signifies strength of character and persistent effort for the well-being of others as well as the ability to defend the Triratna from attacks.

In the absence of sustained effort in practicing meditation, craving creeps in and the meditator comes under its influence. Right effort () is thus required to overcome unskillful mental factors and deviation from .

<text>Stephen Peters (December 27, 1912 – November 29, 1976) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Manitoba legislature from 1958 to 1966, as a representative of the social-democratic Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and its successor, the New Democratic Party.

Peters was born in Winnipeg. The son of John Peters, he was educated at Winnipeg and the neighbouring suburb of Elmwood (later a part of the amalgamated city of Winnipeg), and worked for several years as a mechanic. Peters served in the Canadian military during World War II. He worked for Canada Packers, retiring in 1975. In 1939, Peters married Doris Marjorie Greustad. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1958 provincial election, defeating incumbent Liberal-Progressive MLA Alexander Turk in the newly created riding of Elmwood, by a margin of about 800 votes.

Peters faced a strong challenge from Progressive Conservative candidate Emerson Snyder in the 1959 general election (in which the PCs won a majority government under the leadership of Dufferin Roblin). Peters was re-elected, but his majority was reduced to under 200 votes; Turk finished a distant third. Peters again faced a difficult re-election in 1962; he was again victorious, but the difference between himself and the third-place candidate was less than three hundred votes.

Peters&#x27;s electoral strength in Elmwood was based on his strong connection to unionized labour in the community. He resigned from the legislature in 1966; the riding was subsequently held by Russell Doern, who turned it into a safer seat for the NDP.

He died in Winnipeg at the age of 63.

<text>Maurice Antonio Ferré (June 23, 1935 – September 19, 2019) was an American politician who served six terms as the Mayor of Miami. Ferré was the first Puerto Rican-born United States mayor and the first Latino Mayor of Miami. He was an unsuccessful candidate in the 2010 elections for the U.S. Senate seat for Florida vacated by Mel Martínez for the Democratic primary.

==Early years==

Ferré was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico. He was the son of businessman José Ferré and nephew of governor of Puerto Rico Luis A. Ferré (1904–2003). Ferre&#x27;s father José visited Miami, Florida in the 1920s and wondered why the city did not have any tall buildings. He then ventured into construction and real estate development in Miami. Ferré was born when José and his family returned to their hometown, Ponce in Puerto Rico. Ferré was a graduate of the University of Miami.

Ferré served in the Florida House of Representatives from 1967 to 1968. He served as mayor of Miami from 1973 to 1985.

From 1993 to 1993, Ferré served in the Miami-Dade County Board of Commissioners and was Vice-Chairman of the Miami-Dade County Board of Commissioners. He was active in national political campaigns, and was a member of several presidential advisory boards. Ferré also worked as a banker and business consultant, and held various research and teaching posts.

On December 20, 1995, Francisco Ferré Malaussena, Mariana Gómez de Ferré, and Felipe Antonio Ferré Gómez, the son, daughter-in-law, and grandson of Ferré, died when American Airlines Flight 965 crashed into a mountain in Colombia.

Ferré ran for mayor of Miami-Dade County in 1996, finishing in third against fellow Commissioners Alex Penelas and Arthur Teele. Ferré won 20% and did not make it to the runoff.

In November 2001, Ferré lost his bid to be reelected Mayor of Miami.

Ferré attempted his second run for mayor of Miami-Dade County in 2004; however, he won only 17.76% of the vote, and did not make the run-off.

==Later years==

Ferré was on a fellowship at Princeton University and was writing a book about the contributions that Hispanics have made to American culture. Ferré was one of the driving forces behind the intermestic (an abbreviation of &quot;international&quot; and &quot;domestic&quot;) dialogue, which attempts to seek consensus regarding Puerto Rico&#x27;s political status problem from both an international and domestic vantage point. He spoke about this effort to deal with Puerto Rico&#x27;s political status in an address to the Puerto Rico Senate as keynote speaker during the Governors&#x27; Day special session on February 16, 2006.

In October 2009, Ferré announced that he was running for the open U.S. Senate seat of Mel Martinez. He finished in fourth place (last place) in the Democratic primary, with only 4.9% of the vote.

Ferré is sometimes referred to as the &quot;father of modern-day Miami.&quot; To pay tribute to him and his legacy, a park district in Miami, formerly called Museum Park, was named after him in early 2019.

Ferré died in Miami on September 19, 2019, from spinal cancer. He was 84 years of age. He was buried at Caballero Rivero Woodlawn Park North Cemetery and Mausoleum in Miami.

<doc id="1030974" wikidata="Q379143" url="?curid=1030974" title="Baruntse">
<text>Baruntse is a mountain in the Khumbu region of eastern Nepal, crowned by four peaks and bounded on the south by the Hunku Glacier, on the east by the Barun Glacier, and on the northwest by the Imja Glacier. It is considered as one of the best preparation peaks in the Himalayas for climbers readying themselves for eight-thousanders, however the mountain has a low success rate due to its technical difficulties, steep slopes and unpredictable weather conditions. It is open for beginners, but requires the use of fixed ropes to climb.

Accessing the mountain is usually gained from the South, where climbers can ascend Mera Peak to acclimatize before moving up the valley to Baruntse base camp. From the village of Lukla, it is an eight day hike to base camp.

== First ascents ==
The mountain was first climbed May 30, 1954 via the south ridge by Colin Todd and Geoff Harrow of a New Zealand expedition led by Sir Edmund Hillary.

The first ascent of the East Ridge was made on April 27, 1980 by Lorenzo Ortas, Javier Escartín, Jeronimo Lopez (all Spain) and Carlos Buhler (America) of a Spanish expedition led by Juan José Díaz Ibañez.

In 1994, the first ascent of the North West face of Baruntse North by Vladimir Leitermann, Martin Otta and Tomas Pekarek was nominated for a Piolets d&#x27;Or.

The first ascent of the west face was made in 1995 by a Russian team consisting of climbers Valeri Pershin (climbing leader), Evgeni Vinogradski, Salavat Habibulin, Nikolai Zhilin, and Yuri Ermachek. The ascent was made in seven days and the summit was made on October 12.

In 2004, the first ascent of Ciao Patrick (V+/VI M6+ 90°) on the northwest face and northwest ridge of Baruntse North (7,057m) was made by Simone Moro, Bruno Tassi and Denis Urubko. The alpine-style ascent was identified as one of the most notable ascents of the year.

In 2010, Becky Bellworthy from the United Kingdom became the youngest woman to summit Baruntse at 18 years old. 

=== Notable climbs and incidents ===
In 1998, prominent American alpinist and ski racer Raoul Wille died of altitude sickness while climbing Baruntse.

Nineteen-times Everest summiteer Chhewang Nima died in 2010 on Baruntse after falling through a cornice while fixing a rope beneath the summit.

In 2013, Petr Machold and Jakub Vaněk from the Czech Republic were lost after attempting to climb up the mountain&#x27;s west side, which had only been done once previously. They made it to 6,600m. Heavy snow caught them in camp, and when a rescue operation was mounted, the climbers could not be found.

In 2018, Mera, a stray Tibetan mastiff-Himalayan sheepdog cross climbed Baruntse after following a trekking expedition up the mountain. Team leader Don Wargowsky shared his tent and a sleeping mat with the dog, who is thought to be the first canine to ascend a 7,000m peak.

In 2021, Czech climbers Marek Holeček and Radek “Ráďa” Groh attempted the North-West face climb that had caught Machold and Vaněk eight years earlier. The perilous climb, which they later named &quot;Heavenly Trap&quot;, lasted ten days due to increasingly worsening weather conditions. After summitting, the descent took nearly 80 hours. The climbers graded the route VI+ M6+ 80°.

<doc id="1030976" wikidata="Q3077765" url="?curid=1030976" title="Sunshine Superman (song)">
<text>&quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; is a song written and recorded by Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan. It was released as a single in the United States through Epic Records (Epic 5–10045) in July 1966, but due to a contractual dispute the United Kingdom release was delayed until December 1966, where it appeared on Donovan&#x27;s previous label, Pye Records (Pye 7N 17241). The single was backed with &quot;The Trip&quot; on both the US and UK releases. It has been described as &quot;[one of the] classics of the era&quot;, and as &quot;the quintessential bright summer sing along&quot;.

&quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; reached the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States (Donovan&#x27;s only single to do so) and subsequently became the title track of his third album. When finally released in the UK, it reached No. 2. A different mix of &quot;The Trip&quot; (without harmonica) is also included in the album. The single version of &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; was edited down from its original four-and-a-half minutes to just over three, and this version was also used on the album; the full-length version made its debut on the &quot;Donovan&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; LP in 1969.

==Musical style==

Recorded on 19 December 1965, the song &quot;has a claim to be the first psychedelic rock record ever recorded&quot; according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;. It was arranged by two jazz musicians, pianist John Cameron and Spike Heatley, who played double bass. John Paul Jones, who would also act as an arranger on some Donovan sessions for producer Mickie Most, played electric bass. Session guitarist Jimmy Page (The Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin) played lead guitar, employing an innovative use of the volume control on his guitar for the repeating figure he played during the verses. Cameron played a two-tier Morley harpsichord on the record. After the success of the song, Cameron would arrange (and play on) many tracks for Donovan and Most.

&quot;Billboard&quot; described the single as a &quot;rockin&#x27; production ballad with an exciting, commercial sound&quot;. &quot;Cashbox&quot; described the song as a &quot;funky, medium-paced, blues-soaked romancer about a lad who is determined to snare the gal of his dreams&quot;, and called it &quot;impressive&quot;. &quot;Record World&quot; said it &quot;has an incessant and irresistible mid shuffle beat.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Following the release of the hit song, the name &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; became widely associated with Donovan himself, and was used as the title or part of the title of about six of his album releases and reissues (including several compilations and a live album as well as being used as the title track of his 1966 studio album).

Various incarnations of a Sunshine Superman have appeared in comics produced by DC Comics, the publishers of the Superman character. Writer Grant Morrison referenced the song in a 1990 issue of &quot;Animal Man&quot; by creating Sunshine Superman, an African American version of Superman whose S-shield is sun-shaped and who was a member of the Love Syndicate of Dreamworld, from a world based on the drug culture of the 1960s. Sunshine Superman and his world were wiped out by the Crisis on Infinite Earths, only to be brought back by the Psycho-Pirate before fading away again. Sunshine Superman returned for a brief, non-speaking cameo in &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #7, in an army of alternate Supermen. In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, the Dreamworld Earth is reintroduced as Earth-47, where an iteration of Sunshine Superman and the Love Syndicate exist.

<text>TRS-80 is an electronic music group formed in Chicago in 1997 and led by founding member, Jay Rajeck.

==Biography==
TRS-80 was started by Kent Rayhill and Jay Rajeck in their hometown of Chicago, with Deb Schimmel joining them early on. The trio shared a common desire to write and perform music with real drums and synthesizers. A music writing frenzy of over 50 songs took place at Rajeck&#x27;s home studio. The band played their first live show in 1998, opening for Death In Vegas at Double Door in Chicago. The band was known for their incorporation of visuals projected in sync with their music during live performances.

Chicago indie rock venue The Empty Bottle took TRS-80 under their wing shortly after hearing the band&#x27;s demo and put them on the bill with artists like Sonic Boom, Acid Mothers Temple, Oval, and Laika among others, which helped grow TRS-80 a local following. From there they received bigger shows at venues like Metro, the Vic Theater and the 2,500 seat Riviera Theater opening for B52s, The Sisters of Mercy, The Creatures and other touring bands.

Over the next five years TRS-80 worked with two local record labels, released four albums, and toured parts of the US and Canada. The band also created custom scores for the award-winning Public Radio International show, This American Life and a Nike promotional film titled &quot;Les Jumelles&quot; created by Tron Legacy director, Joseph Kosinski.

In February 2005 Kent and Deb performed their last show, retiring from the stage to pursue other non-musical interests. In March 2005 Rajeck performed as TRS-80 with Mike Barron and Fred de Albuquerque on synthesizers and toured that summer in Canada and the US.

In 2006 TRS-80&#x27;s music was featured twice in CSI: NY and an international Coca-Cola TV ad campaign. Jay Rajeck relocated to Los Angeles and released the full-length album &quot;Mystery Crash&quot; and sister release &quot;Demixes&quot; through Hollywood based One Cell Records after completing a West Coast tour. Long time TRS-80 video collaborator Eric Fensler relocated to Los Angeles from New York shortly thereafter and became Rajeck&#x27;s partner in TRS-80 performances playing synth. The New You EP was released in 2008 through TRS-80&#x27;s new label home, Vinyl International and music from the album was featured in the video game Saints Row 2 that sold over 2 million copies. TRS-80&#x27;s first custom filmed music video for the single &quot;Tinted&quot; was created and took record sales to an all-time high.

<text>The Khumbu Glacier () is located in the Khumbu region of northeastern Nepal between Mount Everest and the Lhotse-Nuptse ridge. With elevations of at its terminus to at its source, it is the world&#x27;s highest glacier. The Khumbu Glacier is followed for the final part of the trail to one of the Everest Base Camps. The start of the glacier is in the Western Cwm near Everest. The glacier has a large icefall, the Khumbu Icefall, at the west end of the lower Western Cwm. This icefall is the first major obstacle—and among the more dangerous—on the standard south col route to the Everest summit. It is also the largest glacier in Nepal. 
The end of Khumbu Glacier is located at .

<text>Esophageal webs are thin membranes occurring anywhere along the esophagus.

==Presentation==
Its main symptoms are pain and difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia).

Esophageal webs are thin membranes of normal esophageal tissue consisting of mucosa and submucosa that can partially protrude/obstruct the esophagus. They can be congenital or acquired. Congenital webs commonly appear in the middle and inferior third of the esophagus, and they are more likely to be circumferential with a central or eccentric orifice. Acquired webs are much more common than congenital webs and typically appear in the cervical area (postcricoid).

Clinical symptoms of this condition are selective (solid more than liquids) dysphagia, thoracic pain, nasopharyngeal reflux, aspiration, perforation and food impaction (the last two are very rare).

==Causes==
They are mainly observed in the Plummer–Vinson syndrome, which is associated with chronic iron deficiency anemia. One in 10 patients with Plummer-Vinson syndrome will eventually develop squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, but it is unclear if esophageal webs in and of themselves are a risk factor.

Esophageal webs are associated with bullous diseases (such as epidermolysis bullosa, pemphigus, and bullous pemphigoid), with graft versus host disease involving the esophagus, and with celiac disease.

Esophageal webs are more common in white individuals and in women (with a ratio of 2:1). The literature describes relations between these webs and Plummer-Vinson Syndrome, bullous dermatologic disorders, inlet patch, graft-versus-host disease and celiac disease. The postulated mechanisms are sideropenic anemia (mechanism unknown) or some interference of the immune system.
Esophageal webs can be ruptured during upper endoscopy.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnostic test of choice is a barium swallow.

==Treatment==
Esophageal webs and rings can be treated with endoscopic dilation.

After starring in several independent films, Wood appeared in more mainstream films, including &quot;The Wrestler&quot; (2008), &quot;Whatever Works&quot; (2009), and &quot;The Ides of March&quot; (2011).

She returned to television in the recurring role of Sophie-Anne Leclerq on &quot;True Blood&quot; from 2009 to 2011. She also portrayed the title character&#x27;s malicious daughter in the HBO miniseries &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; (2011), for which she was nominated for the Golden Globe and Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She starred as sentient android Dolores Abernathy in the HBO series &quot;Westworld&quot; (2016–2022), for which she won a Critics&#x27; Choice Award and earned Golden Globe and Emmy Award nominations. Wood also had a voice role in the Disney animated film &quot;Frozen II&quot; (2019), and portrayed Madonna in &quot;&quot; (2022).

==Early life and family==
Wood was born in Raleigh, North Carolina on September 7, 1987. Her mother, Sara Lynn Moore, is an actress, director, and acting coach. Her father, Ira David Wood III, is an actor, theater director and playwright prominent in Raleigh, where he is the co-founder and executive director of a community theatre company called Theatre in the Park. Wood&#x27;s brother, Ira David Wood IV, is also an actor; she has two other brothers, Dana and Thomas, and a sister named Aden. Her paternal aunt, Carol Winstead Wood, was a production designer in Hollywood.

Of having a traditionally masculine given name, Wood has said: &quot;My mother had a dream that she was gonna have a daughter with blond hair and blue eyes named Evan, so that was just my name.&quot;

Wood was actively involved in Theatre in the Park while growing up, including an appearance in the 1987 production of her father&#x27;s musical comedy adaptation of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; when she was just a few months old. She subsequently played the Ghost of Christmas Past in several productions there, and starred as Helen Keller alongside her mother (as Anne Sullivan) in &quot;The Miracle Worker,&quot; under her father&#x27;s direction.

She attended Cary Elementary School in Cary, North Carolina, where she starred in its production of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. When her parents divorced, she moved with her mother to her mother&#x27;s native Los Angeles in 1997 to further her acting career. She attended public school in California before leaving at age 12 for homeschooling. She received her high school diploma at 15. Wood said she earned a black belt in taekwondo when she was 12, and that she participated in the AAU Junior Olympic Games.

==Career==
===1993–2000: Early work===
Wood began her career appearing in several made-for-television films that were shot in her native North Carolina from 1993 onwards. She made her acting debut at the beginning of that year in Sondra Locke&#x27;s &quot;Death in Small Doses&quot;. She also had recurring roles in the television series &quot;American Gothic&quot; (1995–1996) and &quot;Profiler&quot; (1998–1999), receiving a nomination for Best Supporting Young Actress in a TV Drama Series at the 21st Young Artist Awards for the latter.

Wood&#x27;s first major screen role was in the 1997 film &quot;Digging to China&quot;, as a ten-year-old girl living with her alcoholic mother, played by Cathy Moriarty, who forms an unlikely friendship with a man with intellectual disability, played by Kevin Bacon. It was shot in Western North Carolina and won the Children&#x27;s Jury Award at the Chicago International Children&#x27;s Film Festival. Wood remembers the role as initially hard, but that it &quot;eventually led to her decision that acting is something she might never want to stop doing.&quot; The following year she had a role in &quot;Practical Magic&quot;, a fantasy film directed by Griffin Dunne starring Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman, for which she was nominated for Best Supporting Young Actress at the 20th Young Artist Awards. It was followed by the 1999 made-for-television thriller &quot;Down Will Come Baby&quot;, for which she was nominated for the YoungStar Award for Best Young Actress in a Mini-Series/Made for TV Film.

From 1999 to 2002, Wood was a regular on the ABC television family drama &quot;Once and Again&quot; in the role of Jessie Sammler. Her character dealt with her parents&#x27; divorce, anorexia, and falling in love with her best friend Katie, played by Mischa Barton, in what became the first teen lesbian pairing on network television. For her performance as Jessie, Wood was nominated for the YoungStar Award for Best Young Actress, and won Best Ensemble in a TV Series along with her co-stars Julia Whelan and Meredith Deane, at the 22nd Young Artist Awards.

===2001–2005: Breakthrough===
Wood made her teenage debut as a leading film actress in 2001&#x27;s &quot;Little Secrets&quot;, directed by Blair Treu, where she played 14-year-old aspiring concert violinist Emily Lindstrom. For that role, she was nominated for Best Leading Young Actress at the 24th Young Artist Awards. Wood next played a supporting role in Andrew Niccol&#x27;s 2002 satirical science fiction film &quot;Simone&quot;, which starred Al Pacino. That same year, Wood was recognized as One to Watch at the Young Hollywood Awards.

Wood&#x27;s breakout movie role followed with Catherine Hardwicke&#x27;s 2003 film &quot;Thirteen&quot;. She starred as Tracy Louise Freeland, a young teen who sinks into a downward spiral of hard drugs, sex, and petty crime. Her performance garnered critical acclaim, earning her Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations for Best Lead Actress. During the time of &quot;Thirteen&quot;″s release, Wood was featured on the cover of &quot;Vogue&quot;, with the magazine naming her as one of the &quot;It Girls&quot; of Hollywood. She similarly appeared, along with eight other teen actresses, on the cover of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;″s Young Hollywood issue in July 2003. A supporting role opposite Cate Blanchett and Tommy Lee Jones in Ron Howard&#x27;s &quot;The Missing&quot;, in which she played the kidnapped daughter Lilly Gilkeson, followed the same year, earning her a nomination for Best Leading Young Actress at the 25th Young Artist Awards.

In 2005, Wood appeared opposite Kevin Costner and Joan Allen in the Mike Binder-directed &quot;The Upside of Anger&quot;, a well-reviewed film in which Wood played Lavender &quot;Popeye&quot; Wolfmeyer, one of four sisters dealing with their father&#x27;s absence. Her character also narrated the film. Wood&#x27;s next two starring roles were in dark independent films. In the 2005 Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize nominee &quot;Pretty Persuasion&quot;, a black comedy focusing on the themes of sexual harassment in schools and attitudes about women in media and society, Wood played Kimberly Joyce, a manipulative, sexually active high-schooler. One critic commented, &quot;Wood does flip cynicism with such precise, easy rhythms and with such obvious pleasure in naughtiness that she&#x27;s impossible to hate.&quot; David Jacobson&#x27;s neo-western &quot;Down in the Valley&quot; premiered later that year, in which Wood&#x27;s character, Tobe, falls in love with an older man, played by Edward Norton, a cowboy who is at odds with modern society. Of her performance, it was written that &quot;Wood conveys every bit of the adamant certainty and aching vulnerability inherent in late adolescence.&quot; Wood has commented on her sexually-themed roles, saying that she is not aiming for the &quot;shock factor&quot; in her film choices. Also in 2005, Wood starred in the music videos for Bright Eyes&#x27; &quot;At the Bottom of Everything&quot; and Green Day&#x27;s &quot;Wake Me Up When September Ends&quot;.

===2006–2008: Independent films===

By 2006, Wood was described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as being &quot;one of the best actresses of her generation.&quot; Later that year, she received the Spotlight Award for Emerging Talent at &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual Women in Hollywood gala. Also in 2006, Wood appeared with an all-star ensemble cast as Natalie Finch in the comedy-drama film &quot;Running with Scissors&quot;. Directed by Ryan Murphy and starring Annette Bening, the film was based on the memoir by Augusten Burroughs, which is a semi-autobiographical account of Burroughs&#x27; childhood in a dysfunctional family.

Wood had roles in two films released in September 2007. &quot;King of California&quot;, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, tells the story of a bipolar jazz musician (Michael Douglas) and his long-suffering teenage daughter, Miranda (Wood), who are reunited after his two-year stay in a mental institution and who embark on a quixotic search for Spanish treasure. One review praised Wood&#x27;s performance as &quot;excellent.&quot; The second film was &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, Julie Taymor&#x27;s jukebox musical set to the songs of the Beatles that was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Musical or Comedy. Set during the counter-cultural revolution of the 1960s, Wood played Lucy, an American teen who develops a relationship with her brother&#x27;s British friend Jude (Jim Sturgess). The film featured her singing musical numbers, and she has described the role as her favorite. One critic wrote that &quot;Wood brings much-needed emotional depth.&quot;

Wood provided the voice of an alien named Mala in &quot;Battle for Terra&quot;, a 2007 animated science fiction film about a peaceful alien planet that faces destruction from colonization by the displaced remainder of the human race. The film won the 2008 Grand Prize at the Ottawa International Animation Festival. The film was also screened at the San Francisco International Film Festival, where she received an award at the Midnight Awards. In 2007, Wood also starred in the Vadim Perelman-directed &quot;The Life Before Her Eyes&quot;, based on the Laura Kasischke novel of the same name, about the friendship of two teens of opposite character who are involved in a Columbine-like shooting incident at their school and are forced to make an impossible choice. Wood played the younger version of Uma Thurman&#x27;s character, Diana. One critic cited her performance as &quot;hands-down extraordinary.&quot; Wood stated that she intended the film to be the last one in which she played a teenager.

The following year, she co-starred in Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s &quot;The Wrestler&quot;, winner of the Golden Lion Award for Best Film at the Venice Film Festival, about Randy &quot;Ram&quot; Robinson (Mickey Rourke), a professional wrestler from the 1980s who is forced to retire after a heart attack threatens to kill him the next time he wrestles. Wood played Stephanie, Robinson&#x27;s estranged daughter. Of her performance, one critic wrote, &quot;Once her character stops stonewalling her father and hears him out, Wood provides a fine foil for Rourke in their turbulent scenes together.&quot;

===2009–present: Further film and television career===

Wood co-starred in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Whatever Works&quot;, which premiered at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival, playing the young wife of Larry David&#x27;s character. She later expressed regret for taking the role and that she would not work with Allen again. In May 2009, she played Juliet in six fundraising performances of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at the Theater In The Park; the production was directed by her brother Ira, who also starred. That same year, Wood was named Young Hollywood Superstar at the Young Hollywood Awards.

Wood had a recurring role in the second and third seasons of the HBO supernatural drama series, &quot;True Blood&quot;, from 2009 to 2011 as Sophie-Anne Leclerq. Wood had a role in the film &quot;The Conspirator&quot;, which premiered at Ford&#x27;s Theatre in Washington, D.C., in April 2011, directed by Robert Redford (about the conspiracy surrounding the assassination of Abraham Lincoln). She also had a role in &quot;The Ides of March&quot;. She portrayed the title character&#x27;s daughter in the 2011 HBO miniseries &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;, for which she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award and the Primetime Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

In late 2012 she began filming &quot;10 Things I Hate About Life&quot;, a followup to the hit 1999 teen comedy &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; in which she and Thomas McDonell played a couple who meet while attempting suicide. Filming was suspended when she became pregnant with her son; when it resumed again in 2013 Wood left the production, claiming she had not been paid beyond her $300,000 advance since the production company had not been able to raise enough money to pay her for the filming already completed. In response they sued her for $30 million.

Wood starred with Chris Evans in a 2010 ad campaign filmed by Frank Miller for Gucci Guilty Eau fragrances. Both actors reprised their roles for additional ads in 2013 and 2016. Wood played Gabi in the 2013 psychological romantic thriller film &quot;Charlie Countryman&quot; with Shia LaBeouf and Rupert Grint. She voiced Marianne in the 2015 film &quot;Strange Magic&quot;.

In 2016, Wood began starring as sentient android Dolores Abernathy in the HBO science fiction Western series &quot;Westworld&quot;. Her performance was praised as &quot;spectacular&quot;, &quot;tour-de-force, turn-on-a-dime&quot;, as well as &quot;a tremendous technical achievement&quot;.

In August 2019, Wood announced on Twitter and D23 Expo that she was cast to voice Queen Iduna in &quot;Frozen II&quot;. The film was released in November 2019 to commercial success. She later featured in &quot;Kajillionaire&quot; in 2020, and &quot;Backspot&quot; in 2023. In January 2023, a workshop reading for &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; was held starring Wood along with Amanda Seyfried.

In 2024, she began starring in the Off-Broadway musical revival &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;.

==Other ventures==
===Music===
In 2012, Wood recorded &quot;I&#x27;d Have You Anytime&quot; which is on the fourth CD of &quot;Chimes of Freedom: The Songs of Bob Dylan Honoring 50 Years of Amnesty International&quot;, a compilation production for the benefit of the organization. She performed as electro-pop duo, Rebel and a Basketcase, with multi-instrumentalist Zach Villa in 2016. The duo disbanded in August 2017. Wood is one-half of cover band Evan + Zane, which she formed with guitarist/singer-songwriter Zane Carney in 2018. Evan + Zane put out their first CD, called &quot;Dreams&quot;, in December 2022.

Wood appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for the first time in 2019 when &quot;Show Yourself&quot;, the duet she sang alongside Idina Menzel from the &quot;Frozen II&quot; soundtrack, debuted on the chart at number 99. The song peaked at number 70.

===Activism===
In June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting; in the video, Wood and others told the stories of the people killed there.

In February 2018, she testified before the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations in support of the Sexual Assault Survivors&#x27; Bill of Rights Act. In April 2019, she testified before the California State Senate to help pass the Phoenix Act, which extended the statute of limitations in domestic violence cases from three to five years and requires police to have additional training. In her testimony, Wood said she had been physically, sexually and emotionally abused by singer Marilyn Manson, including antisemitism, and that she had subsequently been diagnosed with complex post-traumatic stress disorder.

==Personal life==
Wood has said, &quot;My mother is Jewish and I was raised with the religion.&quot; In 2012, she stated, &quot;I believe in God but I am not religious. I am spiritual. My definition of God isn&#x27;t in any religion. It&#x27;s very personal.&quot;

Wood dated English actor Jamie Bell between 2005 and 2006. In January 2007, her relationship with Marilyn Manson became public; Wood was the inspiration for Manson&#x27;s song &quot;Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)&quot; and appeared in the song&#x27;s music video. They became engaged in January 2010, but ended their relationship seven months later.

In 2011, Wood publicly disclosed that she is bisexual, and rekindled her relationship with Jamie Bell. They were married in October 2012 and had a son in July 2013. In May 2014, they announced their separation. By 2015, Wood was in a relationship with her bandmate Zach Villa. They were engaged in January 2017, but called it off that September. Starting in 2020, Wood and Bell were in dispute over the custody of their son. Bell said he was deprived of contact with him when Wood moved from Los Angeles to Nashville; Wood claimed she did this to protect the child from former fiancé Marilyn Manson. Bell argued in court that Wood&#x27;s &quot;story defies credibility&quot;, and accused her of &quot;withholding our son from me for other reasons of her own invention.&quot; In May 2023, the two agreed the child would live primarily with Bell in Los Angeles, with Wood having visitation for &quot;one extended weekend per month,&quot; and certain holidays.

In 2020, Wood wrote a message on Twitter regarding the death of Kobe Bryant, describing Bryant as a &quot;rapist&quot;, a reference to his 2003 sexual assault case. Many, including Bryant&#x27;s widow, criticized Wood for the comment, and Wood deleted her Twitter account soon after.

===Marilyn Manson abuse allegations===
In 2016, Wood told a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reporter she had been raped twice years earlier, once by a &quot;significant other&quot;. In February 2021, Wood named Manson as her alleged abuser on Instagram, where four other women made similar allegations against him. Sixteen women have made accusations against Manson, and four have sued him for sexual assault. The Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department said they were investigating Manson due to allegations of domestic violence. In September 2022, the LACSD presented the report of their 19-month investigation on Manson to Los Angeles County district attorney George Gascón. Gascón called the file &quot;partial&quot;, and said more evidence was needed in order to file charges.

In March 2022, HBO released the docuseries &quot;Phoenix Rising&quot;, focusing on these allegations and the circumstances that led Wood, who was 18 at the time, to enter a relationship with the then-37-year-old Manson. That month, Manson filed a lawsuit against Wood for defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, violations of the California Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act, as well as impersonation of an FBI agent and falsifying federal documents. In May 2023, a judge dismissed a part of the lawsuit that involved an FBI letter, which Wood denied forging, and another that alleged Wood and another woman named as a defendant, Illma Gore, created a checklist for other women to use to accuse Manson of abuse. In 2024, Manson dropped his lawsuit and agreed to pay Wood&#x27;s legal fees.

<doc id="1030995" wikidata="Q352189" url="?curid=1030995" title="Vehicle extrication">
<text>Vehicle extrication is the process of removing a patient from a vehicle which has been involved in a motor vehicle collision. Patients who have not already exited a crashed vehicle may be medically (cannot exit a vehicle due to their injuries) or physically trapped, and may be pinned by wreckage, or unable to exit the vehicle because a door will not open.

== Operations ==
Once an incident scene is protected, extrication can commence. Vehicle extrication can be considered in six phases. These phases are:

# Safety and Scene Assessment
# Stabilisation and Initial Access
# Glass Management
# Space Creation
# Full Access
# Immobilisation and Extrication

=== Safety and Scene Assessment ===
Once a scene is protected, for example from other moving traffic, the fire service commander will complete a rapid assessment to identify any significant hazards that may present immediate risks to emergency service workers, members of the public or the patient or patients. This may include fire, hazardous substances, the risk of falling from a height, or being electrocuted or injured by falling masonry from a damaged building. Steps are then taken to mitigate these risks.

=== Stabilisation and Initial Access ===
==== Stabilisation can be thought of as three phases. ====

Phase 1 is rapid stabilisation, these are simple methods to improve vehicle stability:

*Applying a parking brake
*Applying a wheel chock
*Applying a winch wire
*Deflating tyres (this may compromise subsequent rescue efforts and forensic investigations)
*Electrically isolating the vehicle
*Using personnel to brace the vehicle

Phase 2 is stabilisation achieved using chocks and wedges under and around the vehicle.

Phase 3 is the use of additional equipment to stabilise a vehicle. This may be more complex and include:
*Hydraulic/pneumatic stability equipment
*Lifting bags
*Struts

=== Glass Management ===
Glass management involves controlling the risk posed by the windows of the vehicle. This is not just the removal of the vehicle’s windows: it must also include the control of any glass fragments which may pose a risk to the patient and attending emergency service personnel, or which could damage equipment, especially hydraulic hoses.

=== Space Creation ===
The space creation step starts with a structural assessment of the involved vehicle to determine which vehicle components could be simply opened, moved, or manipulated by utilising a vehicle’s natural design features. This would include opening doors, windows or sunroofs and moving/removing seats or headrests. Beyond that, an extrication plan will be formulated which details which vehicle body parts will need to be removed, displaced or reformed to allow access to the patient or patients. A number of specific techniques can be utilised and these are discussed later.

Consideration should also be given to moving the vehicle involved in the incident if that will aid space creation. Moving vehicles with patients still inside is permissible if deemed safe. Relocation of crashed vehicles may:

* Improve safety
* Reduce rescue times
* Provide better access to the casualty

=== Full Access ===
Full access aims to ensure that there is enough space to meet and exceed a patient&#x27;s clinical requirements and to meet the needs of emergency service personnel. Space creation should allow access for medically trained responders to reach the patient. They can assess the patient and if required undertake medical interventions: for example, stopping bleeding, opening obstructed airways, providing medications such as oxygen or tranexamic acid.

=== Immobilisation and Extrication ===
It used to be thought that individuals involved in road traffic collisions needed extremely careful handling, including the use of cervical spine collars and spinal immobilisation boards. This is not however supported by the available evidence base. Patients should be encouraged or assisted to self-extricate from the crashed vehicle as a first-line extrication plan, unless:

* the patient cannot understand or follow instructions, or
* the patient is unable to stand (or it is suspected that they would be unable to stand) on at least one leg, due either to injury or to another condition, for example:
** Impalement
** Suspected pelvic fracture
** Suspected or confirmed bilateral leg fractures
** Signs of head injury (significant dizziness or confusion)

If extrication is required, patients should not be transported on a rigid extrication (spinal) board, as this can cause pressure injuries, and false positives on later examination of the back. Cervical collars do not adequately protect the neck, but they raise intracranial pressure, impede airway management and cause pressure ulcers, and their routine use is not advised in the developed world, and if used they should be loosened at the earliest opportunity.

==Extrication tools and equipment==

Rescue personnel may use a number of powered rescue tools to extricate victims. There are three main types of powered rescue tools including:
* Hydraulic rescue tools – Rescue tools powered by a hydraulic pump. The pump may be powered by hand, an electric motor or a gasoline engine. They may be portable or mounted to a vehicle. There are 4 basic types of hydraulic rescue tools: 
** Spreaders, 
** Shears (Often referred to as the Jaws of Life), 
** Combination spreader/shears, 
** Extrication extension rams.
* Pneumatic rescue tools – Rescue tools that are powered by pressurized air. The pressurized air is sourced from SCBA cylinders, vehicle mounted cascade systems or air compressors. Saws, Air bags, air shores and air chisels are examples of pneumatically powered rescue tools.
*Electric rescue tools – Rescue tools that are powered by electrical power. Powered through power cords linked to electricity generators and through batteries. Reciprocating saws, spreaders, shears, extension rams, and spreader/shears can all be electrically powered.
Stabilization tools include:
* Hydraulic and nonhydraulic jacks – Designed to lift the vehicle.
* Buttress Tension System – A buttress tension system is used to stabilize a vehicle resting on its side or top. It may consist of a minimum of three 4 x 4 inch posts wedged between the vehicle and the ground, or it may be a system composed of metal rods and straps. The exact placement varies by the condition and weight of the vehicle as well as what the vehicle is resting on.
* Wheel chock – Wheel chocks are used to stabilize vehicles resting on their wheels. They are commonly constructed of aluminum, hard rubber, wood, or urethane plastic.
* Cribbing – Cribbing consist of wood or plastic blocks that are made in a variety of shapes and sizes.
* Pneumatic lifting bag – Pneumatic lifting bags are air-pressurized devices that lift objects. They come in three basic types: high-pressure, medium-pressure and low-pressure. They are usually made with a rubber exterior reinforced with steel wire or Kevlar. When deflated they are about one inch thick.
* Winches – Winches are usually vehicle mounted. They are used in conjunction with chains or cables.

Other equipment that can be used during a vehicle extrication include but are not limited to:

* Gasoline rotary saw – A well-maintained gasoline rotary saw can be fitted with various blades: carbide toothed blades, abrasive blades, and diamond blades are among the common blade choices for rescue operations.
* Reciprocating saw – This is a versatile tool, the blades for reciprocating saws have undergone recent changes in composition. High-end carbide-tipped blades have had proven results in the fire service and can cut boron.
* Angle grinders
* Impact wrench/air ratchet – when paired with the right sockets, will speed up disassembly tasks. Air chisels are also ideal for rescue work. Depending on the tool size, capabilities may range from sheet metal to plate steel. Larger style air chisels are also effective on concrete.
* Oxy-fuel cutting torches may be oxygen gasoline, oxygen, acetylene, or exothermic type torches. Space limitations on the rig often determine the size of the cylinders and, therefore, the torch capabilities.
* Tempered and laminated glass removal tools – Tools designed specifically for glass removal are more appropriate than traditional forcible-entry tools. They create less shock to the vehicle and limit patient compartment intrusion.
* Pliers, adjustable wrenches, screwdrivers, etc. – Tools such as these can be used to disconnect the 12-volt battery system; remove interior trim at all push, pull and cut locations; disassemble vehicle components, etc.
* Wire cutters and seatbelt cutters – Almost any disentanglement tactic requires wires and/or seatbelts to be severed for the complete removal of components. Having easy, quick tools readily available makes quick work of these tedious tasks.
* Razor knife – A sharp blade can be used to expose upholstered areas during operations.

== Vehicular Technical Rescue Techniques ==

These include:

* Roof removal
* Roof flap
A roof flap can be undertaken forwards, backwards or sideways. The technique is similar for all three, but the direct the roof is &quot;folded&quot; differs. The steps to perform this technique (forwards) would include:

# Remove the glass from all side and rear windows
# Cut all seatbelts
# Strip trim around cutting points
# Cut all roof pillars except front A-pillars
# Cut “hinge” cuts in roof rail at windshield at the front of the car
# Flap roof forward and secure in position
# Cover sharps
* Pedal displacement
* B-post rip
Removal of the B-post or B-Pillar of a vehicle to allow improved access. The B-pillar is located between a vehicle&#x27;s front and rear side glass, where it serves as a structural support of its roof, its removal leaves the side of a car wide open.
* Third Door creation
Third door creation (or conversion) provides additional access to patients in 2 door cars.
* Dash roll
The dashboard and steering column can intrude into the passenger compartment and crush a patient or restrict their movement. A dash roll, or dash relocation aims to create space by moving the dashboard away from the patient.

==Additional risks==

=== Airbags ===

Active systems such as airbags make cutting into a vehicle more complicated: when they are not set off during the crash (e.g. in a vehicle struck from the rear or a rollover), extrication operations may set them off. This can cause additional trauma to the victim or to the rescuers. Airbags can remain active anywhere from 5 seconds to 20 minutes after being disconnected from the car&#x27;s battery. This is one of the reasons rescuers disconnect the vehicle&#x27;s battery and wait before cutting into a vehicle.

=== Hood Hinge Struts ===
Hood hinge struts can pose a great amount of danger to rescuers who are extricating a victim from a car that had any significant heat in the engine compartment. According to the strut manufacturers, these sealed and pressurized struts are designed to operate at temperatures ranging from 40 degrees Fahrenheit to 284 degrees Fahrenheit. No manufacturer could provide any evidence that any testing at temperatures above 284 degrees Fahrenheit had ever been conducted. During a vehicle fire, especially an engine compartment fire, the two hood hinge struts will be exposed to high heat levels. Since there is no pressure relief &quot;valve&quot; on any of these sealed and pressurized struts, the units can fail violently when overheated. Unfortunately for firefighters, this failure can actually &quot;launch&quot; the entire strut or just one part of the unit a significant distance off the vehicle like an unguided missile. It is the launching of the heated strut that in several incidents across the United States, has caused serious injury to firefighters.

=== Hybrid Cars ===
New hybrid technologies also include additional high voltage batteries, or batteries located in unusual places. These can expose occupants and rescuers to shock, acid or fire hazards if not dealt with correctly.

=== Liquid Petroleum Gas ===
Some vehicles have an additional autogas (LPG) tank. As the system was not built in, there is a risk of damaging the pipe which is often under the car, releasing the pressurized fuel. The risk of this is minimized by locating the line in a protected position during installation. Modern installations also have a shutoff solenoid at the tank so that rupture will only release the fuel in the line rather than allowing fuel to come out of the tank.

== Specific Extrication Challenges ==
Car manufacturers are increasingly using ultra-high-strength steel (UHSS) to the crash safety ratings of their vehicles. UHSS is used in areas of the vehicle such as the A-pillar, B-pillar, rockers, side impact beams, and roof beams. This steel is difficult to cut with the standard extrication tools.

Carbon fibre poses unique challenges when used to manufacture vehicles. It is light and strong and can be difficult to cut. In addition cutting this material can produce particulates which are harmful to health, and breathing protection is required for rescuers and the casualty.

<doc id="1031001" wikidata="Q292391" url="?curid=1031001" title="AGM-122 Sidearm">
<text>The AGM-122 Sidearm was an American air-to-surface anti-radiation missile produced between 1986 and 1990. While not as capable as newer anti-radiation missiles, they were cheaper and lighter in weight allowing more versatile deployment.

==Development==
The AGM-122 Sidearm was produced by the re-manufacture of AIM-9C missiles that had been taken out of service. The AIM-9C was a semi-active radar homing variant of the Sidewinder, developed for the US Navy&#x27;s Vought F-8 Crusader, but used for only a limited period of time. Conceived and developed at China Lake NAWS, the Sidearm was first tested in 1981. In 1984, Motorola was issued a contract to convert and upgrade AIM-9Cs to the AGM-122A standard. A total of about 700 units were produced between 1986 and 1990.

Existing stocks of Sidearm have been depleted, and the missile is no longer in service. Proposals for new-build missiles, under the designation AGM-122B, have not been proceeded with to date.

The AGM-122 was less capable than newer anti-radiation missiles, such as the AGM-88 HARM, but also substantially cheaper, and its lighter weight enabled it to be carried by combat helicopters as well as fighter aircraft and fighter bombers. The missile was primarily fielded aboard Marine Corps AH-1T/W Sea Cobra attack helicopters, and Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier jump jets, and could take the place of self-defense air to air missiles. The weapon retained the same warhead of the AIM-9C, which gave it a fairly limited destructive ability against armored vehicles. However, due to the nature of radiation homing missiles, the AGM-122 aimed for the radar emitter directly, all but guaranteeing the operational elimination of the target.

The Sidearm was primarily intended for use against short-range radar guided anti-aircraft artillery and shorter range SAMs, including those fired by vehicles. The missile was capable of tracking a target even if it was moving.

<doc id="1031003" wikidata="Q7613599" url="?curid=1031003" title="Steve Peters (Ontario politician)">
<text>Stephen J. &quot;Steve&quot; Peters (born 19 January 1963) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada, who served as a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1999 to 2011. He served as a Speaker from 2007 to 2011 and was a Cabinet Minister in the government of Dalton McGuinty.

==Background==
Peters was born in St. Thomas, in the southwestern section of Ontario. Both of his parents were the children of Ukrainian immigrants. He was educated at the University of Western Ontario, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1985. Peters subsequently worked as an archivist at Victoria Hospital in London, Ontario, and at Alma College in St. Thomas. He also worked as a stock clerk at an A&amp;P food store in St. Thomas.

==Politics==
Peters began his political career at the municipal level, being elected to the St. Thomas city council in 1988. He became the city&#x27;s mayor in 1991, and was the youngest mayor in the country at the time. Peters was re-elected by significant majorities in 1994 and 1997.

Peters ran as a candidate of the Ontario Liberal Party in the 1999 provincial election. He defeated incumbent Progressive Conservative (PC) MPP Bruce Smith in the riding of Elgin—Middlesex—London by 1,171 votes.

The election was won by the Progressive Conservatives, and Peters became the opposition critic for Disability issues on 26 June 1999. In September 2000, he was named opposition critic for Agriculture. For the next three years, most of his interventions in the legislature were focused on agricultural and rural issues.

Peters was easily re-elected in the 2003 provincial election, receiving over 57% of the vote. Bruce Smith, again running for the Progressive Conservatives, received just over 30%. The election was won by the Liberals and Peters was named Minister of Agriculture and Food on 23 October 2003. In late September 2004, he announced that the provincial government would provide $30 million to farmers affected by the BSE crisis, which had prevented Canadian beef from reaching the American market.

He was named as Ontario&#x27;s Minister of Labour following a cabinet shuffle on 29 June 2005.

Though he was re-elected in the general election of October 2007, he was dropped from cabinet in a post-election cabinet shuffle. On 28 November 2007, he was elected by his fellow members as the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly on the fourth ballot, defeating Michael A. Brown, Ted Arnott, David Zimmer and Lorenzo Berardinetti.

On 9 November 2010, Peters announced that he would not be seeking re-election in the 2011 Ontario general election.

In 2013, he supported Gerrard Kennedy in his bid to become leader of the Liberal Party. The leadership race was won by Kathleen Wynne.

===Cabinet positions===

==After politics==
After leaving the legislature, Peters became executive director of the Alliance of Ontario Food Processors.

Peters was elected to St. Thomas City Council in 2018.

<doc id="1031012" wikidata="Q1955417" url="?curid=1031012" title="Poses (album)">
<text>Poses is the second studio album by the American-Canadian singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright, released through DreamWorks Records in June 2001. The album was recorded, mixed, and produced by Pierre Marchand, with select tracks produced by Propellerheads&#x27; Alex Gifford (&quot;Shadows&quot;), Ethan Johns (&quot;California&quot;), Damian LeGassick (&quot;The Tower of Learning&quot;), and Greg Wells (&quot;Across the Universe&quot;).

&quot;Poses&quot; contains ornate, piano-driven arrangements that cite a wide variety of musical sources, from &quot;indie pop to Gershwin to trip-hop and back again.&quot; The album took a year and a half to record, with most of it written during Wainwright&#x27;s six-month stay at the Chelsea Hotel. While &quot;Poses&quot; continues the enveloping sound established by Wainwright&#x27;s debut album, collaborations between Wainwright and various producers and guest musicians pushed it in different directions, resulting in drum loops, &quot;gritty beats in unexpected places&quot;, and a &quot;fuller, live&quot; sound. Using fewer operatic elements than the previous album, in an attempt to create a more radio-friendly pop record, &quot;Poses&quot; addresses debauchery and love in less esoteric means. Guests on the album include Wainwright&#x27;s sister, Martha Wainwright, fellow singer-songwriter Teddy Thompson, and rock musician Melissa Auf der Maur.

All tracks were written by Wainwright except for &quot;Shadows&quot;, which was co-written by Alex Gifford, and &quot;One Man Guy&quot;, a song written and originally performed by Wainwright&#x27;s father, Loudon Wainwright III. The bonus track &quot;Across the Universe&quot; is a Lennon–McCartney song that Wainwright recorded initially for the 2001 film &quot;I Am Sam&quot;, and later re-recorded with producer Greg Wells for &quot;Poses&quot;.

&quot;Poses&quot; debuted at No. 117 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and Wainwright ranked No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Top Heatseekers chart. He won the Outstanding Music Album award at the 2002 GLAAD Media Awards, and at the Juno Awards of 2002 was nominated for Best Songwriter and took home the award for Best Alternative Album. Several years following its release, &quot;Poses&quot; was certified gold by the Canadian Recording Industry Association and included on &quot;Mojo&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Modern Classics&quot; list and on &quot;Out&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest, Gayest Albums&quot; list.

==Development==

Wainwright&#x27;s goal was to make a pop record to &quot;show that [he] can get up from behind the piano and that [he&#x27;s] actually pretty compatible with other people of [his] age out there.&quot; He teamed up with producer Pierre Marchand, a family friend who often worked with Wainwright&#x27;s mother and aunt (Kate and Anna McGarrigle), and had helped him record several demo tapes prior to being signed to DreamWorks. Musicians Melissa Auf der Maur and Teddy Thompson also appear on the album, as does Wainwright&#x27;s sister Martha Wainwright. Several tracks were produced by Greg Wells, Alex Gifford, Ethan Johns, and Damian LeGassick. The album took a year and a half to record – half the time it took him to record his first album.

According to Wainwright, &quot;Poses&quot; grew thematically out of its title track, which was inspired by his residency at New York City&#x27;s infamous Chelsea Hotel. Referring to his stay there, he recalled: &quot;I went to all these parties and met all these people and found that, basically, it&#x27;s like a big revolving door. I thought if I could look at it as a series of poses and extract from it what I needed for my songs, then I would survive.&quot; Describing his writing process, Wainwright stated he typically comes up with a melody line and starts singing phonetically, from which words often appear. To promote the album prior to its release, Wainwright embarked on a tour throughout the United States and Canada.

==Songs and themes==
Debauchery is a primary theme throughout the album, stemming from Wainwright&#x27;s struggles with addiction and quest for fame. &quot;Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk&quot; best reflects this motif, directly addressing decadence and desire (&quot;Everything it seems I like&#x27;s a little bit sweeter/A little bit fatter, a little bit harmful for me&quot;). The song has been called an &quot;ode to subtle addictions and the way our compulsions rule our lives.&quot; The music video for &quot;Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk&quot;, directed by Giles Dunning and released by DreamWorks in 2001, features Wainwright performing the song at a piano inside a warehouse and scenes of him walking around New York City.

Asserting that successful pop albums evoke a particular lifestyle that other people have experienced, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Ben Ratliff claims &quot;Poses&quot; does just that, manifesting the &quot;young, gay, narcissistic achiever in New York&quot;. &quot;But&quot;, Ratliff clarifies, &quot;the Chelsea Boy is only a magnified version of practically every kid new to a big city who&#x27;s got a job and an apartment and worries about weekend plans: The Chelsea Boy just has sharper clothes, higher standards of beauty and a better tradition of mordant humor to console himself with.&quot;

An &quot;ode to queer love&quot;, &quot;Greek Song&quot; touches on beauty, passion, and adventure while incorporating Asian string instruments. The melody was taken from the &quot;Cherry Duet&quot; in Pietro Mascagni&#x27;s opera &quot;L&#x27;amico Fritz&quot;.

&quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Joe Tangari complimented the title track, stating that it &quot;stands as one of Wainwright&#x27;s finest songs, with an aching melody and Spartan piano backing.&quot; The song is semi-autobiographical, mirroring Wainwright&#x27;s struggles with addiction and desire for fame (&quot;I did go from wanting to be someone/Now I&#x27;m drunk and wearing flip-flops on Fifth Avenue&quot;).

Coated with thickly layered vocal harmonies, &quot;Shadows&quot; was co-written and produced by Propellerheads&#x27; Alex Gifford. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said the following of the track: &quot;[&#x27;Shadows&#x27;] keeps a dry funk drumbeat, a dab of piano chords, some low clarinet lines and, finally, a swarm of seraphic, multitracked voices; it&#x27;s one of the many songs on the album that build up to moments of cinematic perfection, in which your goose bumps are exactly the ones Wainwright intended.&quot; The programmed beats on &quot;The Tower of Learning&quot; were contributed by contemporary composer Damien LeGassick.

The music video for &quot;California&quot;, also directed by Giles Dunning, features Wainwright performing the song karaoke-style while reading lyrics from a monitor that projects a black-and-white video of Rufus and Martha dressed in 1940s garb. The video also features Wainwright and his band performing the song out of character.

&quot;The Tower of Learning&quot;, originally written for Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;, was resurrected when Wainwright &quot;saw this guy whose eyes were very beautiful, and all of a sudden the whole subject of falling into someone&#x27;s eyes and how electrifying that can be&quot; inspired him. &quot;Grey Gardens&quot; is a tribute to the documentary film of the same name and Thomas Mann&#x27;s &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, written as if Tadzio (a character from the novel) is in the Beales&#x27; mansion and Wainwright is &quot;Little Edie&quot;.

&quot;Rebel Prince&quot;, once described as flag-wavingly homoerotic, tells the story of a hotel resident waiting for his prince to rescue him before he &quot;[rids his] dirty mind of all of its preciousness.&quot; Written from the perspective of a companion praising his queen, &quot;The Consort&quot; sounds of a &quot;dusty minuet beamed in from the harpsichord Elizabethan age.&quot; &quot;One Man Guy&quot;, originally written by Wainwright&#x27;s father (folk musician Loudon Wainwright III), features vocals by friend Teddy Thompson and Wainwright&#x27;s sister Martha Wainwright. Tangari called the cover &quot;faithful and endearing&quot;, admitting Wainwright&#x27;s performance &quot;proves [he] has at least a touch of dad&#x27;s folk roots in him.&quot;

Wainwright said the following of &quot;Evil Angel&quot;:
The simple &quot;In a Graveyard&quot; has been described as a &quot;soulful reflection on moribund themes that momentarily leaves the oboes and strings at the door for a direct heart-to-heart with the listener.&quot; The music video for &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, originally used to promote &quot;I Am Sam&quot;, was directed by Len Wiseman and released through V2 Records. The Lennon–McCartney track appeared on the soundtrack to the film, but was re-recorded to become a bonus track for the reissue of &quot;Poses&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Overall, reception of the album was positive. Allmusic&#x27;s Zac Johnson called the album &quot;spectacular&quot;, &quot;brimming over with Wainwright&#x27;s trademark popera and young romantic wishes.&quot; He further described &quot;Poses&quot; as &quot;beautifully discordant and sonically chilling&quot;, but an album that &quot;often hints at warm grins with mischievous winks.&quot; In his review for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Joe Tangari characterized &quot;Poses&quot; as an &quot;epic album that speaks with grand gestures and a refined eloquence rare in young songwriters.&quot; In addition, Tangari complimented Wainwright&#x27;s ability to express himself and suggested that his voice had improved, becoming less of an acquired taste. &quot;Blender&quot;″s Lisa Gidley asserted the album cemented Wainwright as the &quot;most sardonic iconoclast&quot;, and that well-worn topics from obsession to culture shock are &quot;skewered in fresh ways.&quot; Raidió Teilifís Éireann contributor Tom Grealis stated &quot;Poses&quot; is &quot;infused with a rare charm and wit, magnified by Wainwright&#x27;s sharp lyrical touch and vocal melodies&quot;, and that &quot;Papa must be proud.&quot;

Some were more critical of the album. Referring to the numerous producers and guest artists who collaborated with Wainwright on the album, Johnson stated the album&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;group&#x27; feel suffers only slightly from being less intimate&quot; than Wainwright&#x27;s debut album. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s John Aizlewood praised &quot;Poses&quot; for being brighter and more focused than &quot;Rufus Wainwright&quot;, but described the title track as dreary and &quot;Shadows&quot; as &quot;schmaltzy&quot;. Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant&quot; described Wainwright as &quot;gloriously pompous&quot;, partly due to the &quot;pretentious&quot; French verses and the &quot;blaring&quot; French horns sprinkled throughout the album.

Following is a table of 2001 &quot;end of year&quot; list placements by various publications:

==Commercial performance==
While album sales were limited, with &quot;Poses&quot; debuting at No. 117 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, Wainwright ranked No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Heatseekers chart. The album failed to chart in any other countries. In 2004, &quot;Poses&quot; reached No. 103 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. As of 2002, sales in the United States have exceeded 137,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

Wainwright was nominated for Solo Artist of the Year in the music category of &quot;GQ&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2001 Men of the Year awards. For its critical acclaim and success within the gay community, &quot;Poses&quot; was awarded Outstanding Music Album at the 2002 GLAAD Media Awards, an awards ceremony sponsored by the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). At the Juno Awards of 2002, Wainwright was nominated for Best Songwriter for &quot;Poses&quot;, &quot;Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk&quot;, and &quot;Grey Gardens&quot;; &quot;Poses&quot; won the award for Best Alternative Album. &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Modern Classics&quot; list, published in 2006, placed the album at No. 95. In September 2007, &quot;Poses&quot; was certified gold by the Canadian Recording Industry Association. In 2008, &quot;Out&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Poses&quot; No. 50, and Wainwright&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Want One&quot;, No. 80 on their &quot;100 Greatest, Gayest Albums&quot; list.

<text>Wade Barrett (born June 23, 1976) is an American former soccer player. He was most recently the interim head coach of the Houston Dynamo in Major League Soccer.

== Career ==

=== College ===

Barrett was born in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and played college soccer at the College of William and Mary from 1994 to 1997, where he scored thirty-eight goals and twenty-six assists, and was voted an NSCAA All-American in his senior season.

=== Professional ===
Barrett was drafted twelfth overall in the 1998 MLS College Draft by the then-San Jose Clash. Barrett was a consistent contributor for the Earthquakes in his first two seasons, being slowly converted from a midfielder to a defender, but was sidelined by groin injuries in the 2000 season that forced him to miss much of the year. Barrett returned in 2001 and proved himself to be one of the best defenders in MLS, playing left back for a San Jose team that would win the 2001 MLS Cup. Barrett cemented his position in 2002, continuing his exceptional play at left fullback, and in recognition was named to the 2002 MLS Best XI. In five years in the league, he scored five goals and made twenty-two assists.

Barrett left MLS after the 2002 season to pursue opportunities in the United Kingdom. Barrett first signed with Danish club AGF Aarhus, with whom he spent the latter half of 2002 and much of 2003, but was unable to establish himself as a regular starter. Barrett opted to leave the club in July 2004 in order to join Fredrikstad FK in Norway, joining fellow American Brian West.
He left Scandinavia in January 2005, re-signing with San Jose and winning the MLS Supporter&#x27;s Shield in his first season back. Along with the rest of his teammates, he moved to Houston to become part of the Dynamo for the 2006 season.

In each of the Dynamo&#x27;s first two seasons, Barrett and his teammates finished second in the Western Conference but won the MLS Cup championship. As the Dynamo&#x27;s captain, Barrett lifted the championship trophy each year. He played in sixty-one of the team&#x27;s sixty-two regular season games in its first two seasons.

Barrett retired prior to the start of the 2010 season, and transitioned into an assistant coaching role for Dynamo. As of June 7, 2016, Barrett has been named the interim head coach of Dynamo for the remainder of the 2016 season.

=== International ===

As of March 2007, Barrett has earned two caps for the U.S. national team, the first one coming November 17, 2002, against El Salvador. He was called into camp for the U.S. for an October 8, 2005, World Cup qualifier against Costa Rica, but suffered a hamstring injury in training that prevented him from appearing in the match. In March 2007, Barrett was again called into camp for the national team in preparation for friendlies against Ecuador and Guatemala, and was brought into the game against Guatemala as a second-half substitute.

<doc id="1031016" wikidata="Q467979" url="?curid=1031016" title="Jaime Moreno (footballer, born 1974)">
<text>Jaime Moreno Morales (born 19 January 1974) is a Bolivian former professional footballer now serving as Youth Academy Technical Training Coach for D.C. United in Major League Soccer, and as the head coach of D.C. United&#x27;s U-23 side.

Moreno began his career at Club Blooming and then played for Colombia&#x27;s Independiente Santa Fe before spending two seasons at the English club Middlesbrough. The rest of his career was spent at D.C. United apart from one season at the New York MetroStars in 2003, and he was the all-time leading scorer in Major League Soccer at the time of his retirement in 2010. On 22 August 2007, in a match against the New York Red Bulls, he scored his 109th MLS goal, surpassing the previous league record set by former Dallas Burn and Real Salt Lake forward Jason Kreis. On 17 April 2009, Moreno became the first MLS player ever to reach the mark of 100 goals and 100 assists when he assisted on a Ben Olsen stoppage time goal.

From 1991 to 2008, Moreno played 75 matches for the Bolivia national team, scoring eight goals. He represented the nation in five Copa América tournaments and the 1994 FIFA World Cup.

==Club career==
Moreno was born in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia. He began his career attending the prestigious Tahuichi Academy and playing for Blooming from 1991 to 1994. He signed with the Colombian side Independiente Santa Fe in 1994, but made only five league appearances for the team.

In 1994 Moreno signed with Middlesbrough, and the following season he became the first Bolivian to play in the English Premiership. Moreno started in Middlesbrough&#x27;s official opening of their new Riverside Stadium in a friendly against Italian side Sampdoria. He spent two years there, mostly coming off the bench. In total he made 20 league appearances for Boro, but only scored one league goal against Barnsley, also scoring another goal against A.C. Cesena in the Anglo-Italian Cup.

In 1996, in the middle of the Major League Soccer season, he was signed by the league and allocated to D.C. United, and helped lead them to the MLS Cup. He was one of the league&#x27;s best players in 1997, when he led the league in goals (16), was named to the MLS Best XI and won another MLS Cup for his side (he would add a third Cup and another Best XI in 1999). After the 1997 season, he spent a few games on loan back to Middlesbrough, scoring once against Stoke City.

1998 was Moreno&#x27;s best season, as he scored 16 goals and added 11 assists, only losing the MLS MVP Award to teammate and fellow Bolivian Marco Etcheverry. He continued to play well amid constant concerns about his weight, but injuries began to take toll in 2001. He missed a large chunk of the 2002 season, and a conflict with head coach Ray Hudson led to Moreno being traded to the MetroStars after that season.
Moreno missed most of his one season with the Metrostars, but did score two goals, one against United. He was shipped back to United before the 2004 season and, undertaking a strict training regimen to avoid injuries, regained much of his old form. He was a finalist for MLS MVP, was named to the league&#x27;s Best XI for the second time, and led D.C. to their fourth MLS Cup. He was named to another Best XI in 2005. He was named to the MLS All-Time Best XI after the 2005 season. 

In 2007, he scored his 108th goal on a penalty kick against Toronto FC on 19 May, tying him with Jason Kreis as the all-time leading scorer in MLS. Moreno and Steve Ralston are the only players to have played in each of the first 15 MLS seasons. On 12 August 2010, Jaime Moreno and D.C. United announced that the 2010 season would be his last year with the club. His last game was at home against Toronto FC on 23 October 2010, where he scored on a penalty kick.

After the 2010 MLS season D.C. United declined Moreno&#x27;s contract option and he elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft. When he was not selected, Moreno retired as a player and was hired as Youth Academy Technical Training Coach for D.C. United on 4 March 2011.

==International career==
Moreno was a regular on the Bolivia national team for most of the 1990s and played in the 1994 FIFA World Cup and the 1997 Copa América, but had been ignored for six years until recalled in 2007 for a friendly with Ireland. He played in the 2007 Copa América, where he scored his eighth international goal in the 39th minute of Bolivia&#x27;s opening game against the host nation of Venezuela. He also scored in the 24th minute against Peru, though it was not enough for Bolivia to advance from the group stage.

Moreno announced his retirement from international football in October 2008, after 75 appearances and nine goals scored for his country. He played in 23 FIFA World Cup qualification matches and at the 1999 Confederations Cup.

==Managerial career==
D.C. United announced on 1 March 2011 that Moreno had been named the club&#x27;s Youth Academy Technical Training Coach.

On 5 May 2011; six months after his retirement, Moreno was hired by his former club, D.C. United, to coach their U-23 side. The team represents the highest tier in United&#x27;s Academy, and will begin playing in the Premier Development League, the fourth division in American soccer in 2012.

==Post-playing career==
On 14 September 2013, Moreno was inducted into the D.C. United Hall of Tradition at halftime of a match against the Los Angeles Galaxy at RFK Stadium.

On 2 October 2021, Moreno was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Moreno and his wife, Louise, reside in Loudoun County, Virginia, with their five children. Moreno&#x27;s oldest son, James, 15, has been invited to train with Premier League club West Ham as of 20 October 2010.

<text>Hopewell Valley is a group of communities in Mercer County, New Jersey loosely affiliated through municipal service sharing agreements, all of which send their students to the Hopewell Valley Regional School District.

The area referred to as Hopewell Valley comprises the township of Hopewell (2000 census population of 16,105), the Borough of Hopewell (2,035), the Borough of Pennington (2,696), and the unincorporated census-designated place Titusville (which is within Hopewell Township).

The school district includes four elementary schools (Hopewell Elementary, Toll Gate Grammar, Bear Tavern, and the recently opened Stony Brook Elementary School), a middle school (Timberlane Middle School) and a high school (Hopewell Valley Central High School). Before regionalization of the school district in the 1950s, the high school was simply known as Central High School of Hopewell Township, and the moniker Central High School (sans the Hopewell Valley) persists to some extent in the state of New Jersey as the school&#x27;s (albeit incorrect) official name.

==Historic events==
General George Washington&#x27;s crossing of the Delaware River from Pennsylvania to New Jersey leading to the victory at the Battle of Trenton on the morning of December 26, 1776 is commemorated at Washington Crossing State Park in Titusville. The crossing is re-enacted each year if the weather permits. Hopewell Valley is also the site of the notorious kidnapping of the Charles Lindbergh infant in 1932.

==Notable people==
* Peter Benchley, who drew from the names of local streets and roads in creating the fictional town of Amity in his 1974 novel &quot;Jaws&quot;.
* John Hart, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, lived in Hopewell Township. He is buried in Hopewell Borough.

<doc id="1031019" wikidata="Q968606" url="?curid=1031019" title="Pokalde">
<text>Pokalde Peak (or Dolma Ri) is a mountain peak of Nepal situated 12 km southwest of Mount Everest. Pokalde Peak is one of the shortest and easiest trekking peaks in the Everest Region. The majority of the climb from base camp requires little more than walking with short sections of scrambling up rock.

During the trekking seasons this rocky peak is scarcely covered by snow. Despite its lack of any great technical difficulty, it offers trekkers the prospect of reaching 5,800m in elevation and superb views from the summit, particularly to the South East, North West and West. Other prominent mountains visible from the summit include Makalu, Ama Dablam and Pumori. Because of its relatively low difficulty and impressive summit vista&#x27;s for this altitude, Pokalde is a popular commercial tourist peak in Nepal for those wishing to climb a Himalayan peak without needing to use ice axes and crampons.

The first ascent of Pokalde Peak was made in April 1953 via the ridge adjoining the Pokalde summit with the Kongma La high pass (5535m). This ridge continues from Kongma La to the slightly higher Mehra Peak (Kongma Tse) at 5820m and beyond. Hence the prominence of Pokalde Peak is modest at 271m (889 feet). Most ascents of Pokalde Peak nowadays are made by skirting the opposite Makalu side of the mountain.

Pokalde Peak can be easily climbed in half a day by a fit and acclimatised group with appropriate leadership. Despite its low difficulty, sections of Pokalde are quite exposed so it shouldn&#x27;t be attempted in poor weather. Doing so would significantly increase the difficulty of the climb above that of a &quot;simple trekking peak&quot;. The final pitch to the summit also involves a short section of near vertical scrambling which for amateurs should definitely be protected by rope.

The base camp of Pokalde Peak is situated in a raised &quot;amphitheatre&quot; style valley with a large circular lake in the middle below the Kongma La pass. About 40 minutes from the base camp is the Kongma glacier. This glacier offers ice walls suitable for ice climbing training by appropriately equipped and motivated groups. The glacier is said to be receding in size.

Footprint evidence of significant snow leopard activity has been witnessed in the vicinity of Pokalde Peak base camp. This is despite the popularity of the area in being the gateway to both a major trekking peak as well as a high pass.

Even during the trekking seasons, it is not uncommon for overnight temperatures at base camp to be in excess of twenty degrees below freezing.

<doc id="1031029" wikidata="Q4674595" url="?curid=1031029" title="Acosta Bridge">
<text>The St. Elmo W. Acosta Bridge spans the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, Florida on a fixed span. It is named for City Councilman St. Elmo W. Acosta, who convinced voters to approve a $950,000 bond issue for the original bridge at the site. It carries a total of six lanes of SR 13 with the two-track Jacksonville Skyway in the median and sidewalks on the outside.

Prior to its replacement in 1991, the bridge, originally called St. Johns River Bridge, opened in 1921 and carried three lanes (center one reversible) on a lift bridge of similar design to the nearby Main Street Bridge but was known as the Yellow Monster, largely for its tendency to stick in the upward position. Tolls were charged until 1940, earning more than $4 million for the City of Jacksonville. At some time in 1991, the original bridge was closed to allow construction of the new one to proceed.
The Acosta Bridge was also notable due to its blue neon lights that illuminated the bridge at night. In February 2015 the Jacksonville Transportation Authority announced that the neon lights would &quot;be off indefinitely with no return date on the books&quot; citing a lack of funding for repairs. However, in 2019 the JTA began a $2.6 million project to replace the inoperable neon lights with LED lights. Installation is expected to be completed by summer 2020 and unlike the neon lights, the new LEDs will be able to display any color, not just blue.

==North (downtown) approach==
The original north approach was a T-shaped viaduct, with the bridge ending at Riverside Avenue (US 17/SR 15). Just southwest of the Acosta Bridge, Riverside Avenue passed over the adjacent Florida East Coast Railway bridge approach.

When the bridge was rebuilt, the intersection was rebuilt as a semi-directional T interchange. Direct high-speed connections were provided between the bridge and both directions on Riverside Avenue, as well as a direct ramp from the bridge to the intersection of Broad Street and Bay Street (Riverside Avenue splits into a one-way pair of Broad Street and Jefferson Street north of the bridge).

==South approach==
The bridge originally emptied out on Miami Road (now Prudential Drive) just west of San Marco Boulevard, with a continuation, at least southbound, to San Marco Boulevard. SR 13 went south on San Marco Boulevard, and was later changed to go east on Miami Road.

Around 1958, a system of freeways was built in Jacksonville. This system included an eastern approach for the recently opened Fuller Warren Bridge, along with the older Acosta Bridge and Main Street Bridge, carrying traffic to the Philips Highway (U.S. Route 1 (SR 5)) and Atlantic Boulevard (US 90 (SR 10)). A new approach to the Acosta Bridge was built, splitting from the old one two blocks north of Miami Road, and passing over the intersection of Miami Road and San Marco Boulevard before merging with the other bridge approaches. The old approach became southbound only, and northbound access was provided at Mary Street, two blocks north of Miami Road. A northbound exit was also provided at Mary Street for traffic coming from the south and east. No southbound entrance was provided, but the adjacent Main Street Bridge approach provided access in that direction.

When the bridge was rebuilt, the south approach was kept almost identical. The only real difference was a new northbound onramp from Museum Circle, one block north of Mary Street.
The popular Diamond Head Lobster House was in its path and had to be demolished.

<text>The Aerfer Sagittario 2 (Italian for &quot;sagittarius&quot;) was a prototype all-metal single-seat lightweight fighter aircraft built in Italy by Aerfer, intended to serve as an interceptor or light tactical support aircraft. First flown in 1956, it became the first Italian aircraft to break the sound barrier in controlled flight when it reached Mach 1.1 during a dive from 13,725 m (45,000 ft).

==Design and development==
The Sagittario 2 was based on the earlier Sagittario, which was itself a development of the S.7 piston-engined training aircraft that went into service with the Italian Air Force in small numbers.

A small all-metal aircraft, the Sagittario 2 had its jet engine mounted in the nose, with the exhaust underneath the mid-fuselage. The wing and tail surfaces were highly-swept. 
The cockpit was moved forward of its position on the Sagittario&#x27;s predecessors, and equipped with a bubble canopy. A tricycle undercarriage was fitted, with the nose gear retracting under the engine.

Development continued as the Ariete.

<doc id="1031033" wikidata="Q5341161" url="?curid=1031033" title="Education in Tasmania">
<text>The education system in [[Tasmania]] comprises the education of children from their early years, through kindergarten, primary and high school, and tertiary education in universities and vocational education and training organisations. The system is delivered by the government-run K–12 schooling system, and numerous independent schools and colleges, most of which are controlled or sponsored by religious organisations. Public education in Tasmania is managed primarily by the Department for Education, Children and Young People. The Department is responsible for all aspects of education in Tasmania including schooling, adult education, the State Library and TasTAFE, a vocational tertiary institution with many campuses around the state.

Education in Australia details a national overview of the education system.

==History==

The oldest tertiary institution to be founded in Australia was the theological school Christ College in Bishopsbourne, Tasmania, in 1846. Today Christ College is a residential college of the University of Tasmania, which was founded in 1890, making the university the fourth oldest in the country.

In 1868 Tasmania became the first Australian colony to introduce compulsory education. In 1885 the Tasmanian Department of Education was founded under the &quot;Education Act 1885 (Tas)&quot;, the fifth Australian colony to establish a government department with specific responsibility for education and public instruction. In 1908 school fees for compulsory education were abolished, the last Australian state to do so.

==Early childhood education==
The Tasmanian Education Department Launching into Learning program is a free program for young children (from birth to 4 years old) and their families. It helps parents and their child get to know their local school and other families. Launching into Learning operates in all Tasmanian Government primary and district schools and Child and Family Centres.

==Primary education==
Whereas all other Australian states have a two-tiered system for primary and secondary education, in Tasmania a three-tiered system applies covering primary, high school for students from Years 7 to 10, and colleges for students in Years 11 and 12, and in some college, an optional Year 13. Kindergarten commences for children aged from four years old on 1 January in the year of enrolment. Children who are formally identified as gifted may be eligible to start Kindergarten early – and they must be aged at least three years and six months as of 1 January in the year in which they will start. Students begin their first year of school (preparatory) in the year the child will turn six years of age. They spend seven years in primary school before progressing to secondary education, like other states.

==Secondary education==

Similarly to other states, years 11 and 12 students can obtain the Tasmanian Certificate of Education (TCE) or can complete Vocational Education Training. Yet unlike other states, Tasmania has separate schools, called &quot;colleges&quot;, for the final two years. Years 7-10 are undertaken at &quot;high schools&quot;, although &quot;district schools&quot; and many nongovernment schools combine primary, high school, and college education together, depending on the needs of the school.

There has been much of criticism of this system of education as only half of Year 10 students will go on to college and complete their secondary education. Furthermore, 50% of the state is classified as functionally illiterate, and more than half of the state&#x27;s teenagers fall below the national baseline for maths. Students who do not live near a college, which are all located in Hobart, Launceston, Devonport and Burnie, are frequently required to board to obtain their TCE, forcing many 16 year-olds to leave home. However, recent changes by the Tasmanian government has led to a push to make regional high schools offer TCE subjects.

===Public high schools===
Public high schools entirely co-educational and teach students from Years 7 to 10 or more recently Year 12. A list of these schools is located at the list of high schools in Tasmania.

===Colleges (Senior High Schools)===
In Tasmania, &quot;colleges&quot; are Senior High Schools that cater only for Year 11 and 12 students.
 There are eight colleges in Tasmania.

===Non-government schools===
The non-government schools in Tasmania generally have a religious affiliation, although the involvement of the sponsoring organisation varies between schools. The schools differ in the format of public schools and offer a range of year levels. A list of these schools is located at the list of non-government schools in Tasmania.

===District schools===
In Tasmania there are 26 district schools or district high schools. These schools are located in rural areas where primary and secondary education are taught on a single campus, usually ranging from kindergarten to Year 12 (K-12). A list of these schools is located at the list of district schools in Tasmania.

==Homeschool education==
Tasmania has an active Homeschooling community. Homeschool families in Tasmania must be registered with the Tasmanian Home Education Advisory Council (THEAC), which is an advisory and monitoring board which reports to the Minister for Education. In 2012 there were 660 homeschooling students registered in Tasmania, giving Tasmania the highest ratio of homeschooled students to students in traditional schools (6.4 per 1000 children) in Australia.

==Tertiary education==
The largest public education institution in Tasmania is the University of Tasmania, with major campuses at Newnham (in Launceston) and Sandy Bay (in Hobart), along with a north-west centre in Burnie. TasTAFE (formerly known as TAFE Tasmania) also offers Tertiary qualifications across multiple locations within Tasmania.

== School terms ==
The academic year in Tasmania generally runs from the beginning of February until mid-December for primary and secondary schools, and for colleges exams start early in November. Tasmanian schools operate on a four-term basis. Schools are closed for the Tasmanian public holidays.

<text>Farewell to Manzanar is a memoir published in 1973 by Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston and James D. Houston. The book describes the experiences of Jeanne Wakatsuki and her family before, during, and following their relocation to the Manzanar internment camp due to the United States government&#x27;s internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. It was adapted into a made-for-TV movie in 1976 starring Yuki Shimoda, Nobu McCarthy, James Saito, Pat Morita, and Mako.

==Synopsis==

Jeanne Wakatsuki (the book&#x27;s narrator) is a &quot;Nisei&quot; (child of a Japanese immigrant). At age seven, Wakatsuki—a native-born American citizen—and her family were living on Ocean Park (near San Pedro, California). They have to move to Terminal Island, where her father, a fisherman who owned two boats, was arrested by the FBI following the Pearl Harbor attack on December 7, 1941.

Soon after, she and the rest of her family were imprisoned at Manzanar (an American internment camp), where 11,070 Americans of Japanese ancestry and their immigrant parents—who were prevented from becoming American citizens by law—were confined during the Japanese American internment during World War II. The book describes the Wakatsukis&#x27; experiences during their imprisonment and events concerning the family before and after the war.

Ko Wakatsuki (Jeanne&#x27;s father) emigrated from Japan to Honolulu, Hawaii and then to Idaho, running away with his wife and abandoning his family. Stubborn and proud, he did not cope well with his isolation: he drank and abused his family. Woody (Jeanne&#x27;s brother) wants to preserve his family&#x27;s honor by joining the U.S. Army. After joining (and fighting in the Pacific theater) he visits his father&#x27;s Aunt Toyo, who gave his father money for the trip to Hawaii. After the visit, Woody feels a new pride in his ancestry. He becomes the man of the family, leading them early in their internment.

On the morning of December 7, 1941, Jeanne Wakatsuki says farewell to her father&#x27;s sardine fleet at San Pedro Harbor. By the time the boats return, news reaches the family that the Japanese have bombed Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. Jeanne&#x27;s father burns his Japanese flag and identity papers but is arrested by the FBI and beaten when taken to jail. Jeanne&#x27;s mother moves the family to the Japanese ghetto on Terminal Island, and then to Boyle Heights in Los Angeles. On February 19, 1942, President Roosevelt signs Executive Order 9066 giving the military authority to relocate those posing a potential threat to national security. Americans of Japanese descent await their final destination; “their common sentiment is &quot;shikata ga nai&quot;” (&quot;it cannot be helped”). A month later the government orders the Wakatsukis to move to the Manzanar Relocation Center, in the desert 225 miles northeast of Los Angeles.

At the camp, the Japanese Americans find cramped living conditions, badly prepared food, unfinished barracks, and dust blowing in through every crack and knothole. There is not enough warm clothing to go around; many fall ill from immunizations and poorly preserved food, and they face the indignity of non-partitioned camp toilets (which particularly upsets Jeanne&#x27;s mother). The Wakatsukis stop eating together in the camp mess hall, and the family begins to disintegrate. Jeanne, virtually abandoned by her family, takes an interest in the other people in camp and studies religion with two nuns. However, after she suffers sunstroke when imagining herself a suffering saint, her father orders Jeanne to stop.

Jeanne&#x27;s father is arrested and returns a year later from the Fort Lincoln Internment Camp. The family is unsure how to greet him; only Jeanne welcomes him openly. She has always admired her father (who left his samurai family in Japan to protest the declining social status of the samurai), and fondly remembers how he conducts himself—from his courtship of Jeanne&#x27;s mother to his virtuoso pig-carving. Something happened, however, during his time at the detention camp (where government interrogators accused him of disloyalty and espionage); he is now in a downward emotional spiral. He becomes violent and drinks heavily, nearly striking Jeanne&#x27;s mother with his cane before Kiyo (Jeanne&#x27;s youngest brother) punches their father in the face.

The men&#x27;s frustration eventually results in the December Riot, which breaks out after three men are arrested for beating a man suspected of helping the government. The rioters roam the camp searching for &quot;inu&quot; (both “dog” and “traitor” in Japanese). The military police try to stop the riot; in the chaos they shoot into the crowd, killing two Japanese and wounding ten others. That night, a patrol group accosts Jeanne&#x27;s brother-in-law, Kaz, and his fellow workers and accuses them of sabotage. The mess-hall bells ring until noon the following day, as a memorial to the dead. Soon after, the government requires a loyalty oath to distinguish loyal Japanese from potential enemies. Opinion about whether to take the oath is divided. Answering “no” to the loyalty questions will result in deportation, but answering “yes” will result in being drafted. Jeanne&#x27;s father and Woody answer “yes”, and Papa attacks a man for calling him an &quot;inu&quot;. That night Jeanne overhears her father singing the Japanese national anthem, &quot;Kimigayo&quot;, whose lyrics speak of the endurance of stones.

After the riot, camp life calms down; the Wakatsuki family moves to a nicer barracks near a pear orchard, where Jeanne&#x27;s father takes up gardening. Manzanar begins to resemble a typical American town: schools open, residents are allowed short trips outside the camp, and Jeanne&#x27;s oldest brother Bill forms a dance band called the Jive Bombers. She explores the world inside the camp, trying out Japanese and American hobbies before taking up baton twirling. Jeanne returns to her religious studies and is about to be baptized when her father intervenes. She begins to distance herself from him, but the birth of a grandchild draws her parents closer together than ever.

By the end of 1944, the number of people at Manzanar dwindles; men are drafted, and families take advantage of the government&#x27;s new policy of relocating families away from the west coast. Woody is drafted and, despite his father&#x27;s protests, leaves in November to join the all-&quot;Nisei&quot; 442nd Combat Regiment. While in the military, Woody visits his father&#x27;s family in Hiroshima. He meets Toyo, his father&#x27;s aunt, and finally understands his father&#x27;s pride. In December, the U.S. Supreme Court rules that the internment policy is illegal and the War Department prepares to close the camps. The remaining residents, fearing the future, postpone their departure but eventually are ordered to leave. Jeanne&#x27;s father decides to leave in style, buying a broken-down blue sedan to ferry his family back to Long Beach.

In Long Beach, the Wakatsukis move into public housing, Cabrillo Homes. Although they fear public hatred, they see little sign of it. On the first day of sixth grade, however, a girl in Jeanne&#x27;s class is amazed at Jeanne&#x27;s ability to speak English; this makes Jeanne realize that prejudice is not always open and direct. She later becomes close friends with the girl (Radine, who lives in the same housing project). The two share the same activities and tastes, but when they reach high school subtle prejudice keeps Jeanne from the social and extracurricular success available to Radine.

Jeanne retreats into herself, and nearly drops out of school; however, when her father moves the family to a berry farm in San Jose she decides to make another attempt at school life. Her homeroom nominates her queen of the school&#x27;s annual spring carnival, and for the election assembly, she leaves her hair loose and wears an exotic sarong. Although the teachers try to prevent her from winning, her friend Leonard Rodriguez exposes the teachers’ plot and ensures her victory. Jeanne&#x27;s father, however, is furious that she won the election by flaunting her sexuality before American boys. He forces her to take Japanese dance lessons, but she soon quits. As a compromise, Jeanne wears a conservative dress to the coronation ceremony; however, the crowd&#x27;s muttering makes her realize that neither the exotic sarong nor the conservative dress represents her true self.

In April 1972, Jeanne revisits Manzanar with her husband and three children. She needs to remind herself that the camp actually existed; over the years, she began to think she imagined the whole thing. Walking through the ruins, the sounds and sights of the camp come back to her. Seeing her eleven-year-old daughter, Jeanne realizes that her life began at the camp (as her father&#x27;s life ended there). She remembers him driving crazily through camp before leaving with his family, and finally understands his stubborn pride.

==Distribution==
The non-fiction book has become a curriculum staple in schools and universities across the United States. In an effort to educate Californians about the experiences of Japanese Americans who were confined in American internment camps during World War II, the book and the movie were distributed in 2002 as a part of a kit to approximately 8,500 public elementary and secondary schools and 1,500 public libraries in the state. The kit included study guides tailored to the book and a video teaching guide.

On October 7, 2011, the Japanese American National Museum (JANM) announced that it had negotiated the rights for the 1976 NBC-produced film directed by John Korty; it was made available for purchase from JANM.

<doc id="1031040" wikidata="Q381103" url="?curid=1031040" title="Fermentation lock">
<text>A fermentation lock or fermentation airlock is a device used in beer brewing and wine making that allows carbon dioxide released during fermentation to escape the fermenter, while not allowing air to enter the fermenter, thus avoiding oxidation.

There are two main designs for the fermentation lock. These designs work when half filled with water. When the pressure of the gas inside the fermentation vessel exceeds the prevailing atmospheric pressure the gas will push its way through the water as individual bubbles into the outside air. A sanitizing solution, sulphur dioxide or alcohol is sometimes placed in the fermentation lock to prevent contamination of the beverage in case the water is inadvertently drawn into the fermenter.

This device may take the form of a tube connected to the headspace of the fermenting vessel into a tub of sanitized liquid or a simpler device mounted directly on top of the fermentation vessel.

Currently, a popular fermentation lock that mounts on top of the fermentation vessel is the three-piece fermentation lock. Other models contain three bulbous chambers allowing for a broader range of pressure equalization. These bulbous fermentation locks were generally made of hand blown glass and are nowadays often made of clear plastic.

The use of perforated rubber balloons offers an easy and inexpensive alternative to conventional airlocks: as used primarily in homebrewing, the balloon is stretched over the orifice of the fermentation vessel and, if necessary, tightened with rubber bands. The balloon is then perforated with a needle. These punctures, while not completely airtight, sufficiently protect the vessel&#x27;s contents from contamination and allow the gases produced by fermentation to evacuate from the vessel as the pressure rises and the balloon inflates.

<doc id="1031043" wikidata="Q7815883" url="?curid=1031043" title="Tom G. Palmer">
<text>Thomas Gordon Palmer (; born 1956, Bitburg-Mötsch, West Germany) is an American libertarian author and theorist, a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute and Vice President for International Programs at the Atlas Network.

== Professional life ==
Palmer earned his B.A. in liberal arts from St. John&#x27;s College, his M.A. in philosophy from The Catholic University of America, and his doctorate in political science from Oxford University. At Oxford, Palmer was an H. B. Earhart Fellow at Hertford College and the President of the Oxford Hayek Society.

Palmer has been active in the promotion of libertarian and classical liberal ideas and policies since the early 1970s. He has been editor of several publications, including &quot;Dollars &amp; Sense&quot; (the newspaper of the National Taxpayers Union), &quot;Update&quot;, and the &quot;Humane Studies Review&quot;, and has published articles in such newspapers and magazines as the &quot;New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the &quot;Spectator&quot; of London, &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;Slate&quot;, &quot;Ethics&quot;, and the &quot;Cato Journal&quot;.

He teaches political economy and legal and constitutional history for the Institute for Humane Studies the Institute of Economic Studies Europe. He also works with such organizations as Liberty Fund, and the Council on Public Policy, He blogs at his own website and at Cato@Liberty and is a contributor to the Independent Gay Forum. Palmer is the director of Cato University, a summer seminar sponsored by the Cato Institute.

Palmer is a Senior Fellow of the Cato Institute, where he was previously also Vice President for International Programs and director of its Center for the Promotion of Human Rights. He remains director of Cato University. On January 1, 2009, the center&#x27;s programs were shifted to the Atlas Economic Research Foundation and the Atlas Global Initiative for Free Trade, Peace, and Prosperity. Palmer is Executive Vice President of the Atlas Network and General Director of its Global Initiative, which has since expanded its programs. The Atlas Economic Research Foundation was founded by Antony Fisher, the moving force behind Britain&#x27;s classical liberal Institute of Economic Affairs.

== Involvement in Eastern Europe ==
Before joining the Cato Institute, he was a vice president of the Institute for Humane Studies at George Mason University. During the late 1980s and the very early 1990s, he worked with the Institute for Humane Studies and other organizations to spread classical liberal/libertarian ideas in Eastern Europe. He traveled throughout the region to hold seminars and smuggled books, cash, photocopiers, and fax machines from an office in Vienna, Austria. He arranged for translation and publication into a variety of central and eastern European languages of textbooks in economics and law, as well as seminal works by Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and other thinkers in the libertarian and liberal traditions. He remains active in the region as a speaker at various conferences and seminars, like Liberty Seminars in Slovenia.

== Involvement in the Middle East ==
Palmer is currently attempting to duplicate in the Middle East some of the work he did in Eastern Europe. He has commissioned translation into Middle Eastern languages (Arabic, Kurdish, Persian, and Azeri) and publication of works by Frederic Bastiat, F. A. Hayek, James Madison, and other libertarian influences, and has published essays in Middle Eastern languages on such topics as &quot;Challenges of Democratization&quot; and &quot;Religion and the Law.&quot; In April 2005 Palmer addressed members of the Iraqi parliament in the parliamentary assembly hall on constitutionalism and has written on Iraq. He has also promoted the creation of a libertarian web site, lampofliberty.org, where it is available in Arabic, Azerbaijani, Kurdish, and Persian; and started an Arabic publishing venture. He continues to lecture in the Middle East and works closely with Arabic and Persian bloggers. He has been actively involved in campaigning for free speech rights in the Middle East, notably with the campaign to free Abdelkareem Nabil Soliman, through articles in the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, the &quot;Daily Star&quot; of Lebanon, and other activities.

Palmer opposed the invasion of Iraq before it happened and criticized its conduct afterwards.

== Works ==
Palmer has published essays on the philosophy of individual rights (e.g., in an essay from &quot;Individual Rights Reconsidered&quot;, edited by Tibor Machan (Stanford: Hoover Institution Press, 2001), a substantive response to G. A. Cohen&#x27;s attack on property rights, several responses to the theories of Cass Sunstein and Stephen Holmes, and essays on multicultural politics, on globalization, on globalization and personal and cultural identity, and on libertarian political philosophy. Palmer also published an extensive bibliographical essay on libertarianism in &quot;The Libertarian Reader&quot;, edited by David Boaz. He has published law review articles on intellectual property that have garnered substantial attention within the legal and technological community for his general critique of patents and copyrights and his suggestions of contractual and technological solutions to the problems for which intellectual property rights are usually proposed as solutions.

Palmer also currently publishes a popular blog &quot;Tom G. Palmer&#x27;s Blog&quot;. In 2009, many of his essays and op-eds were published as &quot;Realizing Freedom: Libertarian Theory, History, and Practice&quot; and a 2nd expanded edition of the book was published later as well. He served as editor for &quot;The Morality of Capitalism: What Your Professors Won&#x27;t Tell You&quot;, which was published in 2011 and featured essays from Nobel Prize winners Mario Vargas Llosa and Vernon L. Smith, Whole Foods Market CEO and founder John Mackey, and scholars from around the world. &quot;After the Welfare State: Politicians Stole Your Future, You Can Get It Back&quot;, published in 2012, was another book for which he served as editor and also contributed essays. Over 150,000 copies of &quot;After The Welfare State&quot; was distributed by Students for Liberty to student groups for free. In 2013, &quot;Why Liberty: Your Life, Your Choices, Your Future&quot; was published, which featured Dr. Palmer as editor and contributor. Palmer is also the editor of &quot;Peace, Love &amp; Liberty&quot;, a book published in 2014 that features selected writings from Radley Balko, Steven Pinker, Jeffrey Miron, and others.

Palmer&#x27;s political activities include being a founding member and national secretary of the Committee Against Registration and the Draft (1979–81), president of the Oxford Civil Liberties Society (1993–94), and manager or communications director for several political campaigns. He was a plaintiff in &quot;Parker v. District of Columbia&quot;, a successful lawsuit in Washington, D.C. to secure the right to own a handgun in one&#x27;s home, based on the text of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The case had particular personal significance for him, in that he once survived an attempted assault because he was armed with a handgun. Palmer believes that his attackers were motivated by anti-gay animus; he is openly gay.

<text>Chatelaine is an English-language Canadian women&#x27;s magazine which covers topics from food, style and home décor to politics, health and relationships. &quot;Chatelaine&quot; and its French-language version, &quot;Châtelaine&quot;, are published by St. Joseph Communications.

&quot;Chatelaine&quot; was first published in March 1928 by Maclean Publishing. From 1957 to 1977, &quot;Chatelaine&quot;″s editor was Doris Anderson, under whose tenure the magazine covered women&#x27;s issues, including the rise of feminism as a social phenomenon. Other recent editors include Mildred Istona, Rona Maynard and Lianne George. The current editor is Maureen Halushak.

In 2014, &quot;Chatelaine&quot; ranked first in Canada as the largest magazine with a total circulation of 534,294 copies. &quot;Chatelaine&quot; is now the fourth largest magazine in Canada with a circulation of 257,000 according to AAM June 2017. Due to falling print ad revenues and a declining circulation, &quot;Chatelaine&quot; reduced its publication frequency from 12 to 6 times a year in 2017. Other Rogers Media publications, which held an interest in &quot;Chatelaine&quot; at the time, also reduced their publication frequency or became digital-only publications.

==Founding==
First published in March 1928, &quot;Chatelaine&quot; was created by the Maclean Hunter Publishing Company as a means to reach a different demographic than its other publications, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; and the &quot;Financial Post&quot;. Maclean Hunter Publishing Company solicited ideas from Canadian women to choose a name for the magazine, offering a $1000 prize for the winning entry. The contest drew 75,000 entries. A rancher&#x27;s wife from Eburne, British Columbia won with her suggestion of &quot;The Chatelaine.&quot; The title refers to the ring of keys which housewives long ago would use to get into every part of the house. Anne Elizabeth Wilson was appointed as the first editor of the magazine. She quit in 1929 when she married her fiancee, Victor Paulovich Blochin.

==1920s and 1930s==

The first issue of &quot;Chatelaine&quot; was published the same month that Emily Murphy presented the Persons Case to the Supreme Court, a major turning point in Canadian women&#x27;s history. In December 1929, Murphy wrote an article for &quot;Chatelaine&quot; entitled &quot;Now That Women Are Persons, What&#x27;s Ahead?&quot; Along with providing advice on style, cooking, homemaking, and child-rearing, &quot;Chatelaine&quot; published editorials from influential female thinkers. In 1928 and 1929, article topics included panic over the rising divorce rate, &quot;Wages and Wives&quot; (April 1929), and the high maternal mortality rate in rural Canada (July 1928).

The economic hardships of the Great Depression changed the tone of &quot;Chatelaine&quot;. During the 1930s, the magazine became less political. Popular parts of the magazine included monthly budget meal plans and romantic fiction. There was a rise in male-authored articles, including &quot;Men Don&#x27;t Want Clever Wives,&quot; and &quot;What Did Your Husband Give Up For Marriage?&quot;(August 1938).

The magazine encouraged participation from readers, offering a prize of $25 to the best letter written in response to one of their articles. In October 1938, Edith Hunter of Calgary won the $25 for her letter in response to &quot;What Did Your Husband Give Up For Marriage?&quot; contesting the article. Chatelaine tried to maintain its position as a voice for Canadian women, and included a few political articles with a feminist edge such as &quot;When Women Enter Public Life?&quot; (September 1938), and &quot;Why I Had a Civil Marriage&quot; (March 1935).

==World War II==

The editor of the magazine from 1929 to 1952 was Byrne Hope Sanders. Sanders took some time off from the magazine during World War II after being seconded to Ottawa. She was made a Companion of the Order of Canada for her work as head of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, where she implemented food rationing and set up a consumer council of women.

During the Second World War, &quot;Chatelaine&quot; published cover images of young women in uniform, working on farms, and contributing to the war effort. After the war, as husbands returned home from overseas, the magazine immediately switched to images of ultra-femininity and articles on being a wife. There was a sharp increase in articles about motherhood and family life. Editorials such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Delay Parenthood&quot; (May 1946) were suitable companions to the &quot;Baby Boom&quot; period.

==1957–1977==

After five years under editor John Clare (editor 1952–1957), feminist Doris Anderson took over the position in 1957 and held the position until 1977. Under Anderson, &quot;Chatelaine&quot; began publishing controversial content about subjects including sex and women&#x27;s rights.

Her early tenure at the magazine saw it transformed from a traditional women&#x27;s publication into one that addressed challenging issues, including legal abortion in specific circumstances (1959), an exposé on child abuse (1960), a critique of Canadian divorce laws (1961) and a call for equal pay for women (1962). The writers she employed included June Callwood, Barbara Frum, Adrienne Clarkson, and Michele Landsberg.

In 1963, Anderson considered publishing an excerpt of Betty Friedan&#x27;s &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;. Anderson turned down the excerpt, claiming that the magazine had already covered the material Friedan wrote about. This anecdote is often used to distinguish Anderson and her publication as ahead of its time. Anderson later said that she regretted missing out on what she called &quot;the scoop of the century.&quot;

Anderson pursued and was passed over for the position of editor in chief of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine three times in just over two years: first for Peter Gzowski, then for former managing editor Phil Sykes and finally for Peter C. Newman. It would not be until 2016, more than 45 years later, that a female editor would be appointed to helm &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, the country&#x27;s oldest active magazine (launched in 1905).

Promoting the role of women in politics under her direction, &quot;Chatelaine&quot; identified 50 women who had potential as parliamentarians and put 12 of them – including Member of Parliament Flora MacDonald who referred to it in an interview at Anderson&#x27;s passing[4] – on the cover. For much of her life, she supported greater representation of women in Parliament. In 1974, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada for her contributions to publishing and to public affairs. She left the magazine in 1977.

==1977–2004==

Mildred Istona was editor in chief from 1977 until 1994. Rona Maynard was editor in chief from 1994 until 2004. Under Maynard, the magazine became more personal, often dealing with the struggles, stories and needs of everyday women. Lee Simpson was the first female publisher of &quot;Chatelaine&quot; in 1988. Donna Clark was Publisher from 1998 until 2004. Clark led a re-launch of &quot;Chatelaine&quot; that cost more than $2 million in March 1999.

==2004–2008==
Kim Pittaway succeeded Maynard in 2004 as &quot;Chatelaine&#x27;s&quot; editor in chief. Maynard chose Pittaway to replace her with help from publisher Donna Clark. Pittaway joined &quot;Chatelaine&quot; in 1997 as a freelance editor, and in 1999 started writing her monthly column &quot;Broadside&quot;. In 2001, she joined the magazine full-time as managing editor. Pittaway departed the magazine after 15 months as editor in chief due to conflicts with the Publisher. Kerry Mitchell was publisher of &quot;Chatelaine&quot; at that time. Mitchell was publisher of &quot;Chatelaine&quot; and vice-president of Rogers Consumer Publishing from 2004 until 2009.

Beth Hitchcock was named interim editor of &quot;Chatelaine&quot; for 5 months in 2005–2006.

Sara Angel spent 14 months in the position of editor in chief of &quot;Chatelaine&quot; from May 2006 – July 2007. Angel looked to infuse &quot;more opinion, more entertainment and more ideas&quot; into &quot;Chatelaine&quot; to bring back previous editor Doris Anderson&#x27;s feminist voice. The publication had 4.5 million readers at the time, according to the Print Measurement Bureau.

Maryam Sanati was named editor in chief of &quot;Chatelaine&quot; February 2008. Sanati had been deputy editor of &quot;Chatelaine&quot; for more than 18 months. Her role as editor in chief was announced on the eve of the media brand&#x27;s 80th anniversary celebration. The magazine unveiled a new look with its May 2018 issue.

In 2008, the magazine would be recognized as the second-most influential magazine in Canada – just ahead of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;.

==2009–2014==
Ken Whyte assumed the role of publisher of &quot;Chatelaine&quot; October 2009 until 2011 when he was named President of Rogers Publishing.

Jane Francisco was named editor in chief November 2009, making her the magazine&#x27;s fifth editor in less than six years. Between 2004 and 2010, &quot;Chatelaine&quot; had lost nearly 850,000 readers from total yearly readership. Under Francisco&#x27;s tenure, &quot;Chatelaine&quot; celebrated its 85 anniversary in 2013 with a special June double issue with four flip covers.

Tara Tucker was named Publisher in January 2012. &quot;Chatelaine&quot; released a new logo and a new brand campaign.

In the second half of 2012, &quot;Chatelaine&quot; was No. 1 for the first time in the magazine&#x27;s history in paid circulation, and single copy sales were up 8%.

In the past, the magazine has named a Woman of the Year, honouring a Canadian woman for her achievements in the previous year. Honorees have included Prime Minister Kim Campbell, athlete Chantal Petitclerc, pop singer k.d. lang, and &quot;Jane Doe&quot;, a Toronto woman who waged a successful court battle against the Toronto Police Service after alleging that in 1986 the police force had failed to issue warnings about Paul Callow, who subsequently raped her.

In 2013, Francisco and Tucker launched several multichannel initiatives including a two-hour weekly radio program, television edition and various licensing agreements – even a highly successful fitness app which reached #1 in 18 countries in health &amp; fitness category. &quot;Chatelaine&quot; launched the &quot;Chatelaine&quot; Show 14 August 2012 on CityLine on CityTV. The &quot;Chatelaine&quot; Edition became a regular feature on CityTV in 2013.

In July 2013, Rogers Media launched &quot;Chatelaine Radio&quot;, a two-hour weekly lifestyle radio program. The program, hosted by a local personality in each market but with common health, food and fashion features contributed by the magazine&#x27;s editors, initially premiered on four Rogers Radio stations, CHFI-FM in Toronto, CHFM-FM in Calgary and CHYM-FM and CIKZ-FM in Kitchener-Waterloo.

Francisco left to run &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; in the US in 2013. Karine Ewart was named editor in chief January 2014.

==2015–2018==

Lianne George was named editor in chief in June 2015. George had been the magazine&#x27;s editorial director since 2014. By 2017 circulation had fallen from the largest in Canada the fourth largest. In 2017, Rogers Media reduced the number of print editions from twelve times a year to six.

==2019-present==

Maureen Halushak was named editor in January 2019.

On 20 March 2019, Rogers announced a deal to sell the magazine to St. Joseph Communications.

<doc id="1031051" wikidata="Q1258865" url="?curid=1031051" title="Villa Emo">
<text>Villa Emo is one of the many creations conceived by Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio. It is a patrician villa located in the Veneto region of northern Italy, near the village of Fanzolo di Vedelago, in the Province of Treviso. The patron of this villa was Leonardo Emo and remained in the hands of the until it was sold in 2004. Since 1996, it has been conserved as part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto&quot;.

==History==
Andrea Palladio&#x27;s architectural fame is considered to have come from the many villas he designed. The building of Villa Emo was the culmination of a long-lasting project of the patrician of the Republic of Venice to develop its estates at Fanzolo. In 1509, which saw the defeat of Venice in the War of the League of Cambrai, the estate on which the villa was to be built was bought from the Barbarigo family. Leonardo di Giovannia Emo was a well-known Venetian aristocrat. He was born in 1538 and inherited the Fanzolo estate in 1549. This property was dedicated to the agricultural activities from which the family prospered. The Emo family&#x27;s central interest was at first in the cultivation of their newly acquired land. Not until two generations had passed did Leonardo Emo commission Palladio to build a new villa in Fanzolo.

Historians do not have firm chronology of dates on the design, construction, or the commencement of the new building: the years 1555 or 1558 is estimated to have been when the building was designed, while the construction was thought to have been undertaken between 1558 and 1561. There is no evidence showing that the villa was built by 1549: however, it has been documented to have been built by 1561. The 1560s saw the interior decoration added and the consecration of the chapel in the west barchesse in 1567. The date of completion is put at 1565; a document which attests to the marriage of Leonardo di Alvise with Cornelia Grimani has lasted from that year.

Partial alterations were made to the Villa Emo in 1744 by Francesco Muttoni. Arches within both wings that were close to the central build were sealed off and additional residential areas were created. The ceilings were altered in 1937–1940. The villa and its surrounding estate were purchased in 2004 by an institution and further restorations were made.  Since 1996, it has been conserved as part of the World Heritage Site &quot;City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto&quot;.

The villa is at the centre of an extensive area that bears centuriation, or land divisions, and extends northward. The landscape of Fanzolo has a continuous history since Roman times and it has been suggested that the layout of the villa reflects the straight lines of the Roman roads.

==Architecture==
Villa Emo was a product of Palladio&#x27;s later period of architecture. It is one of the most accomplished of the Palladian Villas, showing the benefit of 20 years of Palladio&#x27;s experience in domestic architecture. It has been praised for the simple mathematical relationships expressed in its proportions, both in the elevation and the dimensions of the rooms.

Palladio used mathematics to create the ideal villa. These “harmonic proportions” were a formulation of Palladio&#x27;s design theory. He thought that the beauty of architecture was not in the use of orders and ornamentation, but in architecture devoid of ornamentation, which could still be a delight to the eye if aesthetically pleasing portions were incorporated.

In 1570, Palladio published a plan of the villa in his treatise &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot;. Unlike some of the other plans he included in this work, the one of Villa Emo corresponds nearly exactly to what was built. His classical architecture has stood the test of time and designers still look to Palladio for inspiration.  

The layout of the villa and its estate is strategically placed along the pre-existing Roman grid plan. There is a long rectangular axis that runs across the estate in a north–south direction. The agricultural crop fields and tree groves were laid out and arranged along the long axis, as was the villa.

The outer appearance of the Villa Emo is marked by a simple treatment of the body of the building, whose structure is determined by a geometrical rhythm. The construction consists of brick-work with a plaster finish, visible wooden beams seen in the spaces of the piano nobile, and coffered ceilings like that within the loggia. The central structure is an almost square residential area. The living quarters are raised above ground-level, as are all of Palladio&#x27;s other villas.

Instead of the usual staircase going up to the main front door, the building has a ramp with a gentle slope that is as wide as the pronaos. This reveals the agricultural tradition of this complex. The ramp, an innovation in Palladian villas, was necessary for transportation to the granaries by wheelbarrows loaded with food products and other goods. The wide ramp leads to the loggia which takes the form of a column portico crowned by a gable – a temple front which Palladio applied to secular buildings. As in the case with the Villa Badoer, the loggia does not stand out from the core of the building as an entrance hall, but is retracted into it. The emphasis of simplicity extends to the column order of the loggia, for which Palladio chose the plain Tuscan order. Plain windows embellish the piano nobile as well as the attic.

The central building of the villa is framed by two symmetrical long, lower colonnaded wings, or barchesses, which originally housed agricultural facilities, like granaries, cellars, and other service areas. This was a working villa like Villa Badoer and a number of the other designs by Palladio. Both wings end with tall dovecotes which are structures that house nesting holes for domesticated pigeons. An arcade on the wings face the garden, consisting of columns that have rectangular blocks for the bases and capitols. The west barchesse also contains a chapel. The barchesses merge with the central residence, forming one architectural unit. This typological format of a villa-farm was invented by Palladio and can be found at Villa Barbaro and Villa Baroer.

Palladio emphasises the usefulness of the lay-out in his treatise. He points out that the grain stores and work areas could be reached under cover, which was particularly important. Also, it was necessary for the Villa Emo&#x27;s size to correspond to the returns obtained by good management. These returns must in fact have been considerable, for the side-wings of the building are unusually long, a visible symbol of prosperity. The Emo family introduced the cultivation of maize on their estate (and the plant, still new in Europe, is depicted in one of Zelotti&#x27;s frescoes). In contrast to the traditional cultivation of millet, considerably higher returns could be obtained from the maize. It is not clear if the long walk, made of large square paving-stones, which leads to the front of the house, served a practical purpose. It seems to be a fifteenth-century threshing floor. However, Palladio advised that threshing should not be carried out near a house.

==Frescoes==

The exterior is simple, bare of any decoration. In contrast, the interior is richly decorated with frescoes by the Veronese painter Giovanni Battista Zelotti, who also worked on Villa Foscari and other Palladian villas. The main series of frescoes in the villa is grouped in an area with scenes featuring Venus, the goddess of love. Zelotti appears to have completed the work on the frescoes by 1566.

In the loggia, the frescoes have representations of Callisto, Jupiter, Jupiter in the Guise of Diana, and Callisto transformed into a Bear by Juno. The &quot;Great Room&quot; is filled with frescoes that were placed between Corinthian columns that rise from high pedestals. The events in the frescoes concentrate on humanistic ideals and Roman history alluding to marital virtues. Exemplary scenes include &quot;Virtue&quot; portrayed in a scene from the life of Scipio Africanus. On the left wall is the scene of Scipio returning the girl betrothed to Allucius and the right wall a scene showing The Killing of Virginia. The sides of these frescoes have false niches that consist of monochrome figures: Jupiter holding a torch, Juno and the Peacock, Neptune with the Dolphin, and Cybele with the Lioness. These figures allude to the four natural elements (fire, air, water, earth). Side panels contain enormous prisoners emerging from the false architectural framework. On the south wall of the great hall toward the vestibule is a false broken pediment that appears above a real entrance arch. A fresco of two female figures, Prudence with the Mirror and Peace with an Olive Branch, can be seen. The North wall at the center of the upper part of the building contains the crest of the Emo Family. It is carved and gilt wood, surrounded by trompe-l&#x27;œil cornices and festoons.

To the left of the central chamber is the Hall of Hercules. It contains episodes referring mainly to the mythological hero. The intent was to emphasize the victory of virtue and reason over vice. The frescoes are inserted in a framework of false ionic columns. The east wall contains scenes of Hercules embracing Dejanira, Hercules throwing Lica into the sea, and The Fame of Hercules at the center. The west wall is Hercules at the Stake, placed within false arches. On the south wall is a panel above the doorway that depicts a Noli me Tangere (“Touch Me Not”) scene.

To the right of the central chamber is the Hall of Venus. This hall contains episodes that refer to the Goddess of Love. On the west wall within false arches are the scenes of Venus detering Adonis from Hunting and Venus aiding the Wounded Adonis. The east wall fresco shows Venus wounded by Love. On the south wall is a panel above the doorway that shows Penitent St. Jerome.

&quot;The Abstinence of Scipio&quot; appears frequently in cycles of frescoes for Venetian villas. For example, the Villa la Porto Colleoni in Thiene and Villa Cordellina in Montecchio Maggiore, built nearly 200 years later, also use this image, fostering ideals which, had in the 15th and 16th centuries, resulted from the renewed discussion of the depravity of town life, in contrast to the tranquility, abundance, and freedom of artistic thought associated with rural existence. Hence, another room in the villa is called the &quot;Room of the Arts&quot;, featuring frescoes with allegories of individual arts, such as astronomy, poetry or music. Within the many frescoes are depictions of different flowers and fruit, including corn, only recently introduced into the Po Valley. Many of the frescoes are presented within false architecture, like columns, arches and architectural framework.
==Media==

In the 1990s Villa Emo was featured in &quot;Guide to Historic Homes: In Search of Palladio&quot;, Bob Vila&#x27;s three-part six-hour production for A&amp;E Network.

The 2002 movie &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Game&quot; used the Villa Emo as a location.

<doc id="1031053" wikidata="Q3474485" url="?curid=1031053" title="Grapevine, California">
<text>Grapevine is an unincorporated community in Kern County, California, United States, at the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley. The small village is directly adjacent to Interstate 5 and consists mainly of gas stations, motels an other travelers roadside services. At an elevation of , the community is located at the foot of a grade known as the Grapevine that lies in Grapevine Canyon through the Tejon Pass.

==Etymology==
The village and grade are named for the canyon the trail passed through, after the wild grapes that grow along the original road. Its Spanish name is &quot;La Cañada de las Uvas&quot;, that is, &quot;Grapevine Ravine.&quot;

==Geography==
The ZIP Code is 93243, and the community is inside area code 661. A post office operated at Grapevine from 1923 to 1960. The community of Wheeler Ridge lies three miles north of Grapevine on Interstate 5, with Lebec nine miles south.
Before the road was straightened and widened during 1933–34 by the three-lane Ridge Route Alternate (US 99), the Grapevine was infamous for its high accident rate. There are escape ramps branching off both sides of the downward part of the road for heavy trucks whose brakes fail on this five mile long, 6% grade, 1600-foot ascent - and now straight - grade.

The Grapevine is subject to severe weather and closure to traffic in winter. The stretch of I-5 through the Grapevine and the Tejon Pass is sometimes closed by the California Highway Patrol, generally because of the icy conditions combined with the steep grade of the pass, and the high volume of traffic during the winter holidays. Occasionally, heavy rains will cause mud and rockslides, closing the freeway. The Highway Patrol is also concerned, especially with the large number of big-rigs that pass through, that just one accident in the icy or snowy conditions might force traffic to slow down or come to a complete stop, leaving hundreds of vehicles stalled at once. Whenever there is such a closure, traffic must either wait for it to reopen, or endure a slow multi-hour detour.

==Landmark==
The top of the Grapevine is registered as California Historical Landmark #283, where Don Pedro Fages passed through in 1772 during his explorations through California.

==Future development==

The Tejon Ranch Company is planning further development in the area, which it identified as at &quot;the northern base of the Interstate 5 grapevine, starting at the foothills in the southernmost portion of the San Joaquin Valley, extending parallel to the Tejon Ranch Commerce Center along I-5&quot;. A company spokesman said the development would result in 12,000 to 14,000 homes and 5.1 million square feet of commercial development. In addition, the company has identified seven thousand additional acres for a development to be called Grapevine North.

<text>The Aerfer &quot;Ariete&quot; (Italian for &quot;Ram&quot; or &quot;Aries&quot;) was a prototype fighter aircraft built in Italy in 1958. It was a refined derivative of the Aerfer Sagittario 2, and was an attempt to bring that aircraft up to a standard where it could be mass-produced as a viable combat aircraft.

Retaining most of the Sagittario 2&#x27;s layout with a nose intake and ventral exhaust for the main Derwent engine, the Ariete added a Rolls-Royce Soar RS.2 auxiliary turbojet engine to provide additional power for climbing and sprinting. This used a dorsal, retractable intake with its exhaust at the tail.

No production ensued; a proposed version with a de Havilland Spectre rocket engine instead of the auxiliary turbojet, the Aerfer Leone (&quot;Lion&quot; or &quot;Leo&quot;), was abandoned before a prototype could be built.

<doc id="1031055" wikidata="Q3586317" url="?curid=1031055" title="1969 Manitoba general election">
<text>The 1969 Manitoba general election was held on June 25, 1969 to elect Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) of the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was a watershed moment in the province&#x27;s political history. The social-democratic New Democratic Party emerged for the first time as the largest party in the legislature, winning 28 out of 57 seats. The governing Progressive Conservative Party fell to 22, and the once-dominant Liberal Party fell to an historical low of five. The Social Credit Party won one seat, and there was also one Independent elected.

Although the NDP had risen from third place to only one seat short of a majority, it was not clear what form the government would take in the days immediately following the election. There were negotiations among the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives to form a minority coalition government, supported by the Social Credit and Independent members; under this scenario, former Liberal leader Gildas Molgat would have become Premier. These plans came to nothing when Liberal MLA Laurent Desjardins announced that he would sit as a &quot;Liberal Democrat&quot; supporting the NDP, allowing the NDP to form government by one seat. Edward Schreyer became the province&#x27;s first social democratic Premier shortly thereafter.

The Manitoba NDP had a total election budget of $45,000. Although very small by modern standards, this was the most the party had ever spent up to this time.

The Liberals had managed to remain as the Official Opposition for a decade after losing power in 1959. However, this would be the start of almost 20 years in the political wilderness; the party would not come close to governing again until winning opposition status in 1988.

<text>During John Kerry&#x27;s candidacy in the 2004 U.S. presidential campaign, a political issue that gained widespread public attention was Kerry&#x27;s Vietnam War record. In television advertisements and a book called &quot;Unfit for Command&quot;, co-authored by John O&#x27;Neill and Jerome Corsi, the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT), a 527 group later known as the Swift Vets and POWs for Truth, questioned details of his military service record and circumstances relating to the awarding of his combat medals. Their campaign against Kerry&#x27;s presidential bid received widespread publicity, but was later discredited and gave rise to the neologism &quot;swiftboating&quot;, to describe an unfair or untrue political attack. Defenders of Kerry&#x27;s service record, including former crewmates, stated that allegations made by SBVT were false.

==Swift Boat Veterans for Truth==
Of the approximately 3,600 Swift boat sailors who served in Vietnam, the names of some 200 appeared on the group&#x27;s statement against Kerry; most did not serve at the same time or in the same place as Kerry. Of those who served in Kerry&#x27;s boat crew, only Stephen Gardner joined SBVT. He was not present on any of the occasions when Kerry earned his medals, including his Purple Hearts. Gardner appeared in two of the group&#x27;s television advertisements. All other living members of Kerry&#x27;s crew supported his presidential bid, and some frequently campaigned with him as his self-described &quot;band of brothers&quot;. Kerry crew members have disputed some of SBVT&#x27;s various allegations, calling them &quot;totally false&quot; (Drew Whitlow), &quot;garbage&quot; (Gene Thorson), and &quot;a pack of lies&quot; (Del Sandusky). Several members of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT) served in the same unit as Kerry, although Gardner was the only one to serve on Kerry&#x27;s boat. A number of Kerry&#x27;s SBVT critics were present on accompanying Swift Boats at one of the combat events for which Kerry was decorated with the Bronze Star Medal and a third Purple Heart. Another SBVT member, Dr. Louis Letson, was the physician who claims to have treated Kerry for his first Purple Heart wound. Larry Clayton Lee was the sole SBVT member to participate in the event for which Kerry was awarded the Silver Star. No SBVT member participated in events related to the award of Kerry&#x27;s second Purple Heart.

In addition to questioning the merit of many of Kerry&#x27;s service awards, SBVT decried his post-Vietnam anti-war activity and disputed the truthfulness of his subsequent testimony about the conduct of the American military as demonstrated in that war. Many political observers saw this as reflecting the &quot;true reason behind the Swift Boat campaign.&quot; All of the allegations referencing Kerry&#x27;s Vietnam service and awards were made during Kerry&#x27;s 2004 presidential campaign while Kerry&#x27;s post-Vietnam anti-war activity had long been a subject of controversy.

Defenders of John Kerry&#x27;s service record, including nearly all of his former crewmates, have stated that SBVT&#x27;s allegations are false.

==Allegations and evidence==

===Purple Heart – general criteria===
The criteria for the Purple Heart call for its award for any injury received during combat requiring treatment by a medical officer; the military makes no distinction regarding the severity of the injury. Under military regulations, the Purple Heart can also be awarded for &quot;friendly fire&quot; wounds in the &quot;heat of battle,&quot; so long as the fire is targeted &quot;under full intent of inflicting damage or destroying enemy troops or equipment.&quot;

An article in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; described the circumstances in which Purple Hearts were given to wounded Swift Boat personnel in Vietnam:

&quot;There were an awful lot of Purple Hearts—from shrapnel; some of those might have been M-40 grenades,&quot; said George Elliott, Kerry&#x27;s commanding officer. &quot;The Purple Hearts were coming down in boxes. Kerry, he had three Purple Hearts. None of them took him off duty. Not to belittle it, that was more the rule than the exception.&quot;

In Douglas Brinkley&#x27;s book &quot;Tour of Duty: John Kerry and the Vietnam War&quot;, Brinkley notes that Purple Hearts were given out frequently:

As generally understood, the Purple Heart is given to any U.S. citizen wounded in wartime service to the nation. Giving out Purple Hearts increased as the United States started sending Swifts up rivers. Sailors—no longer safe on aircraft carriers or battleships in the Gulf of Tonkin—were starting to bleed, a lot.

According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;:

Navy rules during the Vietnam War governing Purple Hearts did not take into account a wound&#x27;s severity—and specified only that injuries had to be suffered &quot;in action against an enemy&quot;.
A &quot;Times&quot; review of Navy injury reports and awards from that period in Kerry&#x27;s Swift boat unit shows that many other Swift boat personnel received Purple Hearts for slight wounds of uncertain origin.

====First Purple Heart====

Some SBVT members have questioned the propriety of Kerry&#x27;s first Purple Heart, received for a wound sustained on December 2, 1968. Kerry remained on duty after being wounded, and sought treatment at the following day&#x27;s sick call. They assert that the injury was too minor to merit a citation because the only treatment Kerry received, after the removal of a piece of shrapnel from his arm, was bacitracin (an antibiotic) and a bandage, and he returned to service immediately. Other division members, including at least one SBVT member, received Purple Hearts under similar circumstances. SBVT also claims that the wound was not from enemy fire but was from shrapnel of a grenade he threw himself, &quot;Self-inflicted wounds were awarded if incurred &#x27;in the heat of battle, and not involving gross negligence.&#x27; Kerry&#x27;s critics insist his wound would not have qualified, but former Navy officials who worked in the service&#x27;s awards branch at the time said such awards were routine.&quot;

On the night in question, Kerry was not on a Swift Boat, but on a 15-foot skimmer. Kerry opened fire on suspected guerrillas on the shore. During this encounter, Kerry suffered a shrapnel wound in the left arm above the elbow. Accounts differ over the crew aboard the skimmer, the source of Kerry&#x27;s injury—Kerry has stated that he does not know where the shrapnel came from—and several other major details.

James Wasser, who later became Kerry&#x27;s radarman on PCF 44, was serving as an interpreter on board-and-search missions at the time; on the night of December 2 he was on the Swift boat accompanying the skimmer, interrogating fishermen picked up by the skimmer.

SBVT&#x27;s claims about the incident are primarily based on an account by retired Rear Admiral William Schachte, then a lieutenant. Schachte has stated that he regularly led training missions for recently arrived officers such as Kerry. One tactic described by Schachte was for a Swift Boat to tow the skimmer to the target area and wait nearby. The skimmer, manned by three people, &quot;would go in, draw fire and get out immediately.&quot; The waiting Swift Boats or air support would attack the enemies thus detected. Schachte stated that he had participated in all previous skimmer missions up to and including the night Kerry was injured, although the latter claim could not be substantiated.

In an interview in 2003, Schachte made no mention of being on the skimmer with Kerry that night; in addition, he described the action as a &quot;firefight&quot; and said of Kerry, &quot;He got hit.&quot; In August 2004, however, Schachte stated that he was the senior officer on Kerry&#x27;s skimmer that night, with one enlisted man also on board, that he popped a flare after detecting movement, and opened fire. He stated that there was no return fire, and that Kerry was &quot;nicked&quot; by a fragment from an M-79 grenade launcher he fired himself. Moreover, while Schachte has described Kerry as, at the time, a &quot;rookie [who] would never be put in command&quot; of a skimmer mission, Kerry was actually given command of a Swift Boat and crew just three days after the skimmer mission and sent into a combat area.

Kerry crewmates Bill Zaladonis and Patrick Runyon dispute Schachte&#x27;s 2004 account. Zaladonis stated that &quot;Myself, Pat Runyon, and John Kerry, we were the only ones in the skimmer.&quot; Runyon added, &quot;Me and Bill aren&#x27;t the smartest, but we can count to three.&quot; They recounted that the skimmer opened fire on suspected guerrillas attempting to evade the patrol, as they ran from sampan boats onto the shore. Both Runyon and Zaladonis believe, but are not completely certain, that the skimmer received return hostile fire; Runyon commented, &quot;It was the scariest night of my life.&quot; Runyon also stated that he is &quot;100 percent certain&quot; that no one on the boat fired a grenade launcher. Zaladonis has noted that Schachte went on &quot;a bunch of&quot; other skimmer missions and speculated that Schachte might have inadvertently mixed up his dates.

In an SBVT television ad, Dr. Lewis Letson asserted, &quot;I know John Kerry is lying about his first Purple Heart because I treated him for that injury,&quot; but did not specify the alleged lie; he subsequently gave varied accounts of his purported interaction with Kerry. Kerry&#x27;s medical records list a medic, J. C. Carreon, as the &quot;person administering treatment&quot; for this wound. Dr. Letson&#x27;s name does not appear on the record, but Letson claimed it was common for medics to sign the paperwork even though Letson would treat the patient. That claim cannot be verified as Carreon died in 1992. In addition, Letson claimed he was given information by way of Kerry&#x27;s crewmen who accompanied him to the clinic, but neither Zaladonis nor Runyon accompanied Kerry, nor has any crewman who was on the nearby Swift Boat supported this claim.

SBVT member Grant Hibbard, who was Kerry&#x27;s commander at the time, has claimed that Kerry came to him the morning after the incident, after he had been to sick bay, stating that he was eligible for a Purple Heart. Hibbard has also claimed that he denied Kerry&#x27;s request and does not know how the award eventually came to be granted, although he had initially stated that he acquiesced on the matter of the award. The presentation letter for the award was dated February 28, 1969.

In addition, Hibbard stated in &quot;Unfit for Command&quot; (Chapter 3) that he had been told that &quot;our units had fired on some VC units running on the beach,&quot; which if true would meet the criteria for the Purple Heart.

SBVT also points to the narration of a subsequent event in &quot;Tour of Duty&quot; (pp. 188–189). Brinkley opens the account of a four-day cruise by stating that &quot;Kerry—who had just turned 25 on December 11, 1968—was a fine leader of his men&quot;. He goes on to quote Kerry&#x27;s reflections in his notebook: &quot;A cocky feeling of invincibility accompanied us up the Long Tau shipping channel because we hadn&#x27;t been shot at yet, and Americans at war who haven&#x27;t been shot at are allowed to be cocky.&quot; SBVT argues that this journal entry shows that the December 2 incident could not have involved enemy fire. Others argue that Kerry was referring to ambushes, a common misfortune for Swift Boats which Kerry had not yet suffered, or to the crew collectively, as he used the term &quot;we&quot; instead of &quot;I&quot;, and most of his crewmembers clearly had been &quot;shot at&quot; before.

===Bronze Star===
Kerry&#x27;s Bronze Star was criticized by former Swift Boat commander Larry Thurlow. During the incident leading to the medal, Thurlow was in tactical command of five boats, including Kerry&#x27;s. The incident began when one of the boats struck a mine. In 2004 Thurlow, along with two other SBVT members, alleged that for bravery under fire is false because neither Kerry&#x27;s boat nor any of the others was under hostile fire. In an affidavit about the incident, Thurlow testified, &quot;I never heard a shot.&quot; Of the three boat commanders present besides Kerry and Thurlow, two are SBVT members who now claim that there was no hostile fire during the incident. But one was seriously wounded with a concussion and the other left the scene early to accompany the wounded to safety. Only Kerry and Thurlow remained behind to work on damage control. The other boat commander present, Don Droz, was later killed in action; however, his widow recalls Droz&#x27;s account as being consistent with Kerry&#x27;s.

Several other witnesses insist that there was hostile fire during the incident. Jim Rassmann, the Special Forces captain Kerry rescued, wrote, &quot;Machine-gun fire erupted from both banks of the river. … When I surfaced, all the Swift boats had left, and I was alone taking fire from both banks. To avoid the incoming fire, I repeatedly swam under water.&quot; Del Sandusky, the helmsman on Kerry&#x27;s boat, PCF-94, stated, &quot;I saw the gun flashes in the jungle, and I saw the bullets skipping across the water.&quot; Wayne Langhofer, who manned the machine gun on Don Droz&#x27;s PCF-43, stated, &quot;There was a lot of firing going on, and it came from both sides of the river.&quot; Michael Medeiros, aboard PCF-94, recalled &quot;a massive ambush. There were rockets and light machine gun fire plus small arms.&quot; Jim Russell, the Psychological Operations Officer of the unit, who was on Kerry&#x27;s boat (PCF-43), wrote &quot;All the time we were taking small arms fire from the beach… Anyone who doesn&#x27;t think that we were being fired upon must have been on a different river.&quot;

Although it is not mentioned in &quot;Unfit for Command&quot;, Thurlow was also awarded a Bronze Star for his actions during the same incident. Thurlow&#x27;s citation includes several phrases indicating hostile fire such as &quot;despite enemy bullets flying about him&quot; and &quot;enemy small arms and automatic weapons fire&quot;, and speaks of fire directed at &quot;all units&quot; of the five-boat fleet. Thurlow&#x27;s medal recommendation, signed by Elliott, used the phrasing &quot;under constant enemy small arms fire.&quot; Also unmentioned in &quot;Unfit for Command&quot; was Robert Lambert, Thurlow&#x27;s chief petty officer who was the official eyewitness cited for Thurlow&#x27;s Bronze Star recommendation, and who received his own Bronze Star for &quot;courage under fire&quot; for pulling Thurlow out of the water. Lambert still insists that the boats were receiving fire from the enemy.

The after-action report is initialed &quot;KJW&quot;, whom SBVT claimed is Kerry. However, Kerry&#x27;s initials are &quot;JFK&quot;, and SBVT cites no reason why Kerry would have included a &quot;W&quot;. These same initials &quot;KJW&quot; appear on other reports about events in which Kerry did not participate. A Navy official stated to the &quot;New York Times&quot; that the initials referred not to the author of the report, but to the headquarters staffer who received it.

Furthermore, Kerry&#x27;s base commander, Adrian Lonsdale, stated that according to the precedence he had set out in his operations order, Kerry would be the &quot;only logical candidate&quot; to write the report based on his length of service in Vietnam. However, records indicate that Kerry actually had the least amount of time in Vietnam of any of the officers there that day (although Droz had arrived at Anthoi somewhat later than Kerry).

In addition, SBVT claimed that the after action report for the incident was sent from the Coast Guard cutter where Kerry had received medical treatment, the USCGC &quot;Spencer&quot;. but relevant Navy documents indicate that the report was likely transmitted from a ship with a routing indicator that would apply to the LST &quot;Washtenaw County&quot; (LST-1166), where all nonevacuated officers who had served on the mission were berthed for the night.

Finally, beyond the medal citations, all U.S. Navy documents indicate hostile fire during the action. Kerry&#x27;s boat even received special recognition from Captain Roy Hoffmann on March 14 in his weekly report to his men; the report&#x27;s description of hostile fire was not disputed at the time. PCF-94 had major damage that had to be repaired before it could resume patrols. Also, later intelligence reports confirm the presence of hostile forces.

===Silver Star===
Kerry&#x27;s Silver Star medal was questioned by George Elliott, Kerry&#x27;s former commanding officer and a member of SBVT. Elliott&#x27;s stated position on the award changed during the course of the 2004 presidential campaign.

 indicates that he charged into an ambush, killing an enemy preparing to launch a rocket. In his 1969 performance evaluation, Elliott wrote &quot;In a combat environment often requiring independent, decisive action, LTJG [Lieutenant Junior Grade] Kerry was unsurpassed. He constantly reviewed tactics and lessons learned in river operations and applied his experience at every opportunity. On one occasion, while in tactical command of a three boat operation his units were taken under fire from ambush. LTJG Kerry rapidly assessed the situation and ordered his units to turn directly into the ambush. This decision resulted in routing the attackers with several KIA [Killed in Action]. LTJG Kerry emerges as the acknowledged leader in his peer group. His bearing and appearance are above reproach.&quot;

During Kerry&#x27;s 1996 Senate re-election campaign, when there was criticism of his Silver Star, Elliott responded: &quot;The fact that he chased armed enemies down is not something to be looked down on.&quot; In June 2003, Elliott was quoted as saying the award was &quot;well deserved&quot; and that he had &quot;no regrets or second thoughts at all about that.&quot;

During the 2004 campaign, however, Elliott signed two affidavits that criticize the award. The first, in July 2004, stated in part, &quot;When Kerry came back to the United States, he lied about what occurred in Vietnam...&quot; After the release of this first affidavit, Michael Kranish of the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; quoted Elliott saying, &quot;It was a terrible mistake probably for me to sign the affidavit with those words. I&#x27;m the one in trouble here...I knew it was wrong...In a hurry I signed it and faxed it back. That was a mistake.&quot; Elliott contended that Kranish had substantially misquoted him, but the &quot;Globe&quot; stood by its account, calling the disputed quotes &quot;absolutely accurate&quot;.

The story prompted Elliott to release a second affidavit, in August 2004, in which he stated, &quot;Had I known the facts, I would not have recommended Kerry for the Silver Star for simply pursuing and dispatching a single wounded, fleeing Viet Cong.&quot; The second affidavit made what Elliott called an &quot;immaterial clarification&quot;, in that he admitted that he had no personal knowledge of the circumstances of the shooting. Rather, his initial statement that Kerry had been dishonest was based on unspecified sources and a passage contributed by Kranish to a biography of Kerry.

However, although Elliott claims that he was not in possession of the facts of the event, the original citation that Elliott wrote (which is not the citation that appears in &quot;Unfit for Command&quot;) incorporates most of the details in the after action report. The report states that Kerry chased and shot a single wounded, fleeing Viet Cong. In addition, it states that the PCFs were filled with troops, that all three boats turned into the first ambush and beached, that the troops conducted the first sweep, and that while Kerry led the first landing party during the second sweep, the other landing parties and troops followed and took out the VC.

Kerry’s crew members who were there that day do not agree with Elliott’s characterization of the event in his 2004 affidavits. They contend that the enemy soldier, although wounded, was still a threat. For example, Fred Short, said, &quot;The guy was getting ready to stand up with a rocket on his shoulder, coming up. And Mr. Kerry took him out... he would have been about a 30-yard shot... [T]here&#x27;s no way he could miss us.&quot; Del Sandusky, Kerry’s second in command, described the consequences to the lightly armored Swift Boat: &quot;Charlie would have lit us up like a Roman candle because we&#x27;re full of fuel, we&#x27;re full of ammunition.&quot; Another witness stated that the VC &quot;had an entry wound at the side of his chest and exit wound at the opposite side of the chest cavity, a wound that was consistent with reports of the man turning to fire a second B-40 rocket.&quot;

The only member of SBVT who was present that day, Larry Clayton Lee, has stated he believes Kerry earned the Silver Star.

Another eyewitness, William Rood, a former &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; editor, in a 2004 article gave an account that supports Kerry&#x27;s version of the events of that day. Rood was commander of PCF-23, which was one of the two Swift Boats that accompanied Kerry&#x27;s PCF-94.

Rood discounted several specific charges made by SBVT about the incident. In his (secondhand) book account, O&#x27;Neill implied that Kerry chased down a lone &quot;teenager in a loincloth clutching a grenade launcher which may or may not have been loaded,&quot; without coming under enemy fire himself. In contrast, Rood stated that there were multiple attackers, there was heavy hostile fire, and the guerrilla Kerry shot was &quot;a grown man, dressed in the kind of garb the Viet Cong usually wore&quot; armed with a &quot;loaded B-40 rocket launcher&quot;. Also, O&#x27;Neill called Kerry&#x27;s tactic of charging the beach &quot;stupidity, not courage.&quot; Similarly, Hoffman characterized Kerry&#x27;s actions as reckless and impulsive. However, Rood stated that Kerry&#x27;s tactic of charging the beach was discussed and mutually agreed with the other Swift boat commanders beforehand. He also notes that, at the time, Hoffman praised all three Swift boat commanders and called the tactics developed &quot;a shining example of completely overwhelming the enemy&quot; and that they &quot;may be the most efficacious method of dealing with small numbers of ambushers.&quot; O&#x27;Neill responded that Rood&#x27;s criticism was &quot;extremely unfair&quot; and stated that Rood&#x27;s account of events is not substantially different from what appeared in his book &quot;Unfit for Command&quot;, for which Rood had declined an interview. The American eyewitnesses to the second sweep, including SBVT member Larry Clayton Lee, have stated that there were multiple VC at the scene of the second sweep.

The accounts of Vietnamese witnesses are consistent on several points with Rood&#x27;s. Ba Thanh, the guerrilla killed while carrying the B-40 rocket launcher, was &quot;big and strong&quot; and in his late 20s. Return fire was also intense, according to Vo Van Tam, who was then a local Viet Cong commander: &quot;I led Ba Thanh&#x27;s comrades, the whole unit, to fight back. And we ran around the back and fought the Americans from behind. We worked with the city soldiers to fire on the American boats.&quot; No Vietnamese witnesses saw how Thanh died or saw him being chased by an American.

No individual who was present that day has disputed Kerry&#x27;s version of events, nor suggested that he did not earn the Silver Star, and some said accounts given in &quot;Unfit for Command&quot; were incorrect.

O&#x27;Neill states that the Silver Star was awarded after only two days, &quot;with no review&quot;. 

Some critics questioned the reason for the existence of three versions of the Silver Star citation with variations in the wording, the first being signed by Vice Admiral Zumwalt, as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces, Vietnam, the second being signed by Admiral John Hyland as Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet, and the third being signed by John Lehman, as Secretary of the Navy. In this connection, Mr. Lehman, who served as secretary from 1981 to 1987, was quoted as saying he had never seen or signed the most recent citation (&quot;Kerry citation a &#x27;total mystery&#x27; to ex-Navy chief&quot;, Thomas Lipscomb, Chicago Sun-Times, Aug. 28, 2004). However, in its October 2004 documentation of its investigation of Kerry&#x27;s medals, the office of the Navy inspector general described the first, longer version as the &quot;COMUSNAVFOR Vietnam version, signed by VADM Zumwalt&quot; and the second version as the &quot;official version, signed by the delegated award authority, ADM Hyland, CINCPACFLT&quot;. As to the third version, the report described it as one of several &quot;duplicate citations&quot; that were issued in 1985 after &quot;considerable correspondence indicating efforts over the years to chase down various citations&quot;, and stated that the ones under Lehman&#x27;s name were likely signed by machine. In addition, in October 2004, Rowan Scarborough of the Washington Times reported:

Republican Sen. John Warner, who was Undersecretary of the Navy at the time, stated &quot;We did extraordinary, careful checking on that type of medal, a very high one, when it goes through the secretary. I&#x27;d stand by the process that awarded that medal, and I think we best acknowledge that his heroism did gain that recognition.&quot; Elmo Zumwalt, Commander of the United States Naval Forces in Vietnam at that time, signed Kerry&#x27;s original Silver Star citation and defended the award in 1996, saying &quot;It is a disgrace to the United States Navy that there&#x27;s any inference that the [medal] process was anything other than totally honest.&quot; &quot;Boston Herald&quot;, October 28, 1996.

===Cambodia mission===
On March 27, 1986, while giving , Kerry mentioned he was in Cambodia on a Swift Boat around Christmas 1968. During that encounter, Kerry said he was shot at by Vietnamese and Khmer Rouge Cambodians, while the President had told the American people that U.S. military personnel were not in Cambodia. According to the Boston Globe biography of Kerry, he later recalled that after the Christmas Eve incident, he began to develop a deep mistrust of U.S. government pronouncements.

One chapter of SBVT&#x27;s &quot;Unfit for Command&quot; questioned Kerry&#x27;s statements that he was in Cambodia during the war. Kerry did not claim to have been sent on a covert mission to Cambodia on Christmas Eve, 1968. Rather, he believed at the time he had crossed the border while on a patrol near the border, during which the boats were ambushed and later came under friendly fire from South Vietnamese soldiers. None of Kerry&#x27;s crewmates confirmed being sent to Cambodia. One of Kerry&#x27;s crewmen, SBVT member Steven Gardner, asserted that it was physically impossible to cross the Cambodian border, as it was blocked and patrolled by PBRs (a type of patrol boat); however, Kerry&#x27;s boat was evidently patrolling with PBRs during the mission in question. Some crewmembers have, moreover, stated that they may at some point have entered Cambodia without knowing it. James Wasser, who was on PCF-44 on that December mission, while saying that he believed they were &quot;very, very close&quot; to Cambodia, did not recall actually crossing over; he also stated that it was very hard to tell their exact position in the border area. Kerry&#x27;s own journal entry on this, written the night of the mission, does not specifically say they entered Cambodia. However, it does state that PCF-44 was somewhere &quot;toward Cambodia&quot; to provide cover for two smaller patrol boats, and in sarcasm, that he considered messaging Christmas greetings to his commanders &quot;from the most inland Market Time unit&quot; and that a court martial for the incident &quot;would make sense&quot; In addition, George Elliott noted in Kerry&#x27;s fitness report that he had been in an ambush during the 24-hour Christmas truce, which began on Christmas Eve.
Michael Meehan, a spokesman for the Kerry campaign, responded to SBVT&#x27;s charges with a statement that Kerry was referring to a period when Nixon had been president-elect and before he was inaugurated. Meehan went on to state that Kerry had been &quot;deep in enemy waters&quot; between Vietnam and Cambodia and that his boat came under fire at the Cambodian border. Meehan also said that Kerry did covertly cross over into Cambodia to drop off special operations forces on a later occasion, but that there was no paperwork for such missions and he could not supply dates.

Based on examination of Kerry&#x27;s journals and logbook, historian Douglas Brinkley placed the covert missions soon after Christmas. In an interview with the London &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, Brinkley stated that Kerry had gone into Cambodian waters three or four times in January and February 1969 on clandestine missions, dropping off U.S. Navy SEALs, U.S. Army Green Berets, and CIA operatives. Brinkley added, &quot;He was a ferry master, a drop-off guy, but it was dangerous as hell. Kerry carries a hat he was given by one CIA operative. In a part of his journals which I didn&#x27;t use he writes about discussions with CIA guys he was dropping off.&quot;

In an interview with Tim Russert on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, Kerry corrected his 1979 statement about being &quot;five miles across the border&quot; on Christmas Eve, but reiterated that he was on a patrol at the border at that date and had been sent on a covert mission at a later date.

In the book, O&#x27;Neill argued that a Swift boat commander would have been &quot;seriously disciplined or court-martialed&quot; for crossing the Cambodian border. Critics point out the inconsistency between this description and O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s own claims documented in a conversation with President Nixon in 1971 in which O&#x27;Neill told the President he had worked along the Cambodian border on the water in a Swift boat.

==Document release==
Kerry has made his Vietnam journals and diaries available to his biographer, historian Douglas Brinkley, but has not made them otherwise publicly available. In declining to make the materials available to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2004, the Kerry campaign cited an exclusivity agreement with Brinkley. However, Brinkley subsequently told the paper that he interpreted the agreement as requiring only that quotations from the materials cite his book.

During the 2004 campaign, Kerry released hundreds of documents related to his military service, including his reserve and discharge documents.

The conservative organization Judicial Watch filed a request for Kerry&#x27;s records with the Navy under the Freedom of Information Act. The Navy provided Judicial Watch with a biographical data sheet on Kerry, two citations and one certificate for the Silver Star medal, two citations and one certificate for the Bronze Star medal, and three sets of orders and certificates for the Purple Heart. The Navy was required to withhold an additional 31 pages of personnel records because a release authorization was not provided, but referred the requester to Kerry&#x27;s website which contained documents exempted from disclosure.

Kerry was attacked by SBVT and some media entities for not authorizing independent public access to his privacy protected service records. After the election, on May 20, 2005, he did sign a Standard Form 180 allowing full release of all his military service records, including his reserve and discharge records, as well as his medical records, to the Associated Press, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. A spokesman for Kerry declined the &quot;New York Sun&#x27;s&quot; request to be included on that release. The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reported that the material largely duplicated what Kerry had released during the campaign, and included no &quot;substantive new material&quot;.

Asked why he had declined to sign the release earlier, Kerry responded:

==Navy Inspector General report on medals==
In September 2004, Vice Admiral Ronald A. Route, the Navy Inspector General, completed a review of Kerry&#x27;s combat medals, initiated at the request of Judicial Watch. In a memo to Secretary of the Navy Gordon R. England, Route stated:

On September 23, 2004, Judicial Watch appealed on the basis that &quot;no specific documentary examples were cited or offered as exhibits&quot; in the Navy Inspector General&#x27;s letter of reply. Judicial Watch also filed a Freedom of Information Act request for documentation of the investigation. On October 4, 2004 the Navy Inspector General&#x27;s office responded with documentation of the investigation.

Included within the Navy Inspector General&#x27;s documentation was a discussion of the duplicate medal citations Kerry had received in 1985:

In an October 5, 2004 letter to Judicial Watch, Secretary England deferred to the Navy Inspector General&#x27;s authority as the investigating officer, and declined to initiate a separate review. On October 12, 2004, &quot;Judicial Watch&quot; released a press release critical of the Navy&#x27;s decision that no further investigation or review would take place.

==&quot;Swiftboating&quot;==
Since the 2004 election, the term &quot;swiftboating&quot; (or &quot;swift boating&quot;) has become a common expression for a campaign attacking opponents by questioning their credibility and patriotism in a dishonest manner. The term is most often used with the pejorative meaning of a smear campaign.

<doc id="1031066" wikidata="Q6795586" url="?curid=1031066" title="Maxim Institute">
<text>The Maxim Institute is a research and public policy think tank based in Auckland, New Zealand. The Institute&#x27;s work is oriented toward a conservative perspective on its issues of primary concern, which are now education policy, tax and welfare policy. Although initially identifiable as a social conservative organisation, its policy statements have emphasised fiscal restraint within tax and welfare policy since its former director, Bruce Logan, left in 2005.

The Institute has been involved in public debate in a number of educational policy issues. These include private school funding, teacher registration and training options, bulk funding and related concerns. As it originally arose from the &quot;Education Development Foundation&quot; as its precursor organisation before it rebranded, this is not illogical, although educational policy issues have been a diminished focus since 2001. During the Logan era, free speech, social justice, democracy and constitutional issues were emphasised. The Institute produces research and publications, and advocates for fiscal conservative public policy. It regularly organises a series of political forums and has developed websites in the lead up to New Zealand general elections for the sake of educating voters about the electoral process.

Maxim Institute&#x27;s mission statement is &quot;to foster ideas and leadership that enable freedom, justice and compassion to flourish in New Zealand.&quot;

==Work==
Since its founding in 2001, Maxim Institute has supported a greater role for &quot;civil society&quot; and community in New Zealand life, notably in education, welfare and social service provision. Mild controversy has hinged on what the Institute considers to be &#x27;civil society&#x27; in this context, and concern has been expressed by some small segments of the population about harms contingent on what left-leaning critics view as &#x27;welfare privatisation&#x27; and outsourcing to &#x27;questionable&#x27; religious conservative social service providers.

The Institute has undertaken extensive research in a number of areas. Most notable amongst their reports are a series on the role of government as expressed through the taxation system, a literature report on father involvement - &quot;Going Further with Fathers&quot; - and a modelling project looking at school choice - &quot;Roll Play&quot;.

It has published a wide range of op-eds and analysis on these and other subjects in newspapers, and also produces research and submissions on law and policy (See publications). Since its inception, Maxim Institute has also run an internship programme.

==Social Conservative Era: CEO Bruce Logan: 2001-2005==
Maxim Institute first gained public recognition in 2003 when it opposed the Prostitution Reform Bill. The Institute stated that the Bill would legitimise and increase the exploitation of women in New Zealand. It also opposed the Civil Union and Relationships Statutory References Bills in the following year, and argued that such moves would make &quot;marriage meaningless.&quot; The act was passed, and lesbian and gay New Zealanders acquired secular ceremonial and ritual recognition of their relationships and substantive equal relationship-related rights and responsibilities within most areas of New Zealand law.

==Fiscal Conservative Era: CEO Greg Fleming: 2005- ==
After the retirement of Bruce Logan, the Institute moved to emphasise fiscal conservatism as well as its previous focus on the aforementioned social conservative &#x27;core&#x27; issues. Thus, it has also supported other measures which &quot;empower parents,&quot; localising decision making. Maxim Institute has also endorsed restorative justice, parental choice of schools, democratic involvement, performance related pay for teachers, strong communities, limited government, low taxes and personal responsibility.

The Institute holds regular forums, including one held at the Auckland Town Hall and centred on the theme of &quot;social justice&quot;. Speakers have included Youth Court Judge Andrew Becroft, University of Canterbury Professor David Fergusson and Researcher Professor Peter Saunders.

In 2008, it held the first of its Annual John Graham Lectures. This was delivered by Professor Jeremy Waldron of NYU Law School and titled &quot;Parliamentary Recklessness: Why we need to legislate more carefully&quot;.

The Institute also holds regular public lectures on topics such as tax and &quot;social justice&quot;. However, as with its adoption of &#x27;civil society&#x27; rhetoric, there have been minor criticisms of its concept of &#x27;social justice&#x27;, which rules encourages public participation through renewed emphasis on privatisation policies, as well as redistributive taxation policies to ensure equality of opportunity.

==History==
Maxim Institute was founded on 12 November 2001 by Greg Fleming (formerly general manager of Parenting with Confidence) and Bruce Logan, a former Headmaster, and former Director of the New Zealand Education Development Foundation (NZEDF) in Christchurch. John Graham (then University of Auckland Chancellor) also played a role in the Institute&#x27;s founding.

After serving four years as the Institute&#x27;s Director, Bruce Logan retired in 2005 and was replaced by Greg Fleming. Maxim Institute&#x27;s Christchurch office closed in early 2006.

==Publications==
Maxim Institute has published various books and reports on issues including political correctness, curriculum, and marriage law. These books include &quot;Silent Legacy: The unseen ways great thinkers have shaped our culture&quot;, which considers the history of western philosophy. &quot;Pursuing Social Justice in New Zealand&quot;, a collection of essays from prominent New Zealanders looking at creating strong communities. &quot;From Innocents to Agents&quot;, which looks at the politicisation of children in New Zealand. &quot;Vying for our Children&quot;, which examines various education philosophies. It also formerly published a quarterly journal entitled &quot;Evidence&quot;. According to Maxim Institute &quot;Evidence&quot; &quot;explore[d] the critical issues facing New Zealand society today, including education, family and welfare. &quot;Evidence&quot; provided commentaries and analyses that were heavily relied on Anglo-American and Australian religious and social conservative pressure groups. As of Issue 15 (Spring 2005), &quot;Evidence&quot; ceased publication, as Bruce Logan was its former editor.

The Institute produces a monthly email called &quot;Real Issues&quot;, which focuses on &quot;provoking analysis of developments in policy and culture in New Zealand and around the world&quot;.

As well as Real Issues, Maxim also published an ongoing series of educational research reports based on research by Colmar Brunton, called &quot;The Parent Factor&quot;, related to parental choice in education access, government funding and opposition to centralisation.

The Institute also drafts submissions on a range of public policy issues. The issues have included sedition law reform, electoral finance, victims&#x27; rights, democratic reform, prostitution, civil unions, hate speech and section 59. However, it has primarily emphasised fiscal conservative positions on tax and welfare policy since 2005.

==Awards==

In 2005, Managing Director Greg Fleming was one of six New Zealanders to receive an Emerging Leader Award from the Sir Peter Blake (sailor) Trust.

Maxim Institute has received several international think tank awards from the Atlas Economic Research Foundation, a neoliberal US think tank. The Templeton Freedom Prizes were awarded for: Institute Excellence (first place), Social Entrepreneurship (second place) and Initiative in Public Relations (second place).

In April 2006, Atlas Foundation awarded Maxim Institute&#x27;s &quot;Parent Factor&quot; publications as the winner of the Innovative Projects category of the Sir Antony Fisher International Memorial Award.

==Controversies==

===Plagiarism===
On 17 October 2005, Paul Litterick of the New Zealand Association of Rationalists and Humanists used Copyscape , a web-based plagiarism detection service, to analyse Logan&#x27;s published newspaper work. He alleged plagiarism in Logan&#x27;s work, and published the results in the &quot;Fundy Post&quot; (Issues 18 and 19), an online chronicle of the alleged excesses of New Zealand conservative Christians and other faith-based elements. Litterick found that some of Logan&#x27;s work was taken (with permission) from Anglo-American sources, which include The Heritage Foundation, Institute for American Values, National Fatherhood Institute, Maggie Gallagher (a U.S. social conservative journalist), Melanie Phillips (UK), Conservative Christian Fellowship (UK) and Digby Anderson, Social Affairs Unit (UK). Later that year, Logan retired from the Maxim Institute.

===&quot;NZ Votes&quot;===
In 2005 the Maxim Institute ran a project leading up to the New Zealand general election, 2005 called &quot;NZ Votes.&quot; The campaign featured a website and 30 debates between electorate candidates around the country. On its website, the NZ Votes project described itself as a &quot;non profit and non partisan&quot; and as a &quot;community service&quot; designed to inform voters about MMP. However, Nicky Hager criticised the Institute&#x27;s candidate database in his book &quot;The Hollow Men&quot; (2006), and also alleged that there had been close ties between the New Zealand National Party and a series of educational policy booklets that attacked New Zealand Labour Party government stances on such issues. However another book, &quot;The Baubles of Office&quot;, by Stephen Levine and Nigel Roberts, makes a point of highlighting the political neutrality of nzvotes.org.

In June 2011, the Institute advertised that it had invited Iain Duncan-Smith, United Kingdom Secretary of State for Welfare and Pensions, head of the Centre for Social Justice and former leader of the Conservative Party of the United Kingdom and the Opposition (2001—2003). This has raised some questions about whether the Institute&#x27;s days of social conservative emphasis are as far behind it as its recent public policy statements and analyses suggest. Duncan-Smith is an outspoken social conservative on issues like abortion, civil partnerships and inclusive adoption reform in the United Kingdom 

===Frank Ellis visit===
In 2004, Dr Frank Ellis, a University of Leeds lecturer, spoke at a conference hosted by the Maxim Institute on political correctness and its reputed origins in Soviet Communism. Ellis was later suspended from his post when it emerged he had endorsed the British National Party, and for his alleged ties to white nationalist groups.

<doc id="1031068" wikidata="Q445801" url="?curid=1031068" title="Stern John">
<text>Stern John (born 30 October 1976) is a Trinidadian football manager and former player who is currently managing Saint Lucia. He managed Anguilla from 2020 to 2022. He previously played for a number of American and English football clubs that included Columbus Crew, Nottingham Forest, Birmingham City, Coventry City, Derby County, Sunderland, Southampton, Bristol City, Crystal Palace and Ipswich Town.

==Club career==
===Early U.S. career===

John was born in Tunapuna, Trinidad and Tobago, to a sporting family that included several professional footballers and cricket players. He played on the Trinidad and Tobago cricket youth national team until age 16, when he switched to playing soccer full-time. John moved to the United States in 1995 to attend New Jersey&#x27;s Mercer County Community College. He had been recruited in Trinidad by the college&#x27;s head coach, Charlie Inverso, who had previously sought international talent. John led the Mercer County Vikings to the 1995 NJCAA soccer championship and scored 27 goals, including one in the final against Yavapai College.

He made his professional debut for the Carolina Dynamo of the A-League, the second division of U.S. club soccer, in April 1997 while on loan from the Trinidad and Tobago Football Association. John was traded to the New Orleans Riverboat Gamblers for Jamie Wellington a month later, having not scored a goal in five appearances for Carolina. With New Orleans, where he was paired with fellow Trinidadian forward Mickey Trotman, John scored 16 goals in 21 appearances and was named Rookie of the Year.

John was invited by the New England Revolution to their 1998 preseason camp, but was not retained after his trial. Following the 1998 CONCACAF Gold Cup, where he scored two goals, John was invited for a walk-on trial by the Columbus Crew. His second cousin Ansil Elcock, a fellow Trinidad and Tobago international who had been signed by the Crew, had recommended John to head coach Tom Fitzgerald. Following a successful trial, John was signed and made his Major League Soccer debut on 29 March 1998 against the Dallas Burn, where he replaced Elcock but failed to score. He scored his first MLS goal in his fifth appearance, a 5–1 victory over the Miami Fusion, and ended the match with a hat-trick and an assist. John ended his rookie MLS season as the league scoring champion with 26 goals in 27 matches and a place in the MLS Best XI. He was the first MLS player to score three hat-tricks in a single season, including 16 goals in a span of 12 matches.

He scored 18 goals in the 1999 season, tied for the league&#x27;s scoring leaderboard, and attracted interest from European clubs but declined a mid-season transfer. He ended his MLS career with 44 goals in 55 matches.

===Nottingham Forest===
After the 1999 season with Columbus, John was acquired by Nottingham Forest of the English First Division for a fee of £1.5 million. However, eventual financial difficulties at Forest following the team&#x27;s failed bid at promotion forced John&#x27;s sale to Birmingham City in February 2002, then pushing for promotion to the Premier League, for the sum of £100,000. John scored 18 goals in 49 starts for Forest.

===Birmingham City===
At Birmingham, John scored nine goals in 60 Premier League appearances in two full seasons and was effective with his hold up play and also had some memorable moments in the blue shirt of Birmingham, such as his turn and finish away at West Ham in 2002; his last minute equaliser at Villa Park in the Birmingham derby; and his last minute goal away at Millwall which put Birmingham through to the Playoff Final in 2002. He then scored one of the penalties in the play-off final shootout to help them get promoted to the Premier League. Popular with the Birmingham fans for his goals, he nonetheless fell out of favour with management, and was sold to Coventry City on 14 September 2004.

===Coventry City===
In his first season with Coventry, John finished second in team scoring with 12 goals despite starting in barely half of Coventry&#x27;s games.

===Derby County===
At the start of the 2005–06 season, following the signing of James Scowcroft, John found himself outside of manager Micky Adams&#x27;s first-team plans. As a result, he was loaned to Derby County on 16 September 2005. He rejoined Coventry three months later.

===Sunderland===
On 29 January 2007, John was transferred to Sunderland for an undisclosed fee. The signing was Sunderland manager Roy Keane&#x27;s sixth signing of the 2006–07 season January transfer window. He scored his first goals against Southend United in a 4–0 victory on 17 February 2007.

===Southampton===
On 29 August 2007, John moved to Southampton as part of a deal that took his international teammate Kenwyne Jones in the opposite direction.

He scored his first goals with two in a 3–2 win against West Bromwich Albion on 6 October 2007. From then on he scored regularly for &quot;The Saints&quot;, with nine goals in his first fifteen appearances, including a second half hat trick against Hull City on 8 December 2007. He finished the 2007–08 season fourth highest scorer in the Championship with 19 goals for Southampton. (He had also scored once for Sunderland in the Premier League prior to his transfer.) Before being sent off for a second bookable offence, John scored two goals, including the match winner, in Southampton&#x27;s final game of the season against Sheffield United, as the Saints narrowly avoided relegation to League One.

===Bristol City===
John was loaned to Bristol City in October 2008 until the end of the 2008–09 season. John made his first Bristol City appearance, coming on as a substitute, against Barnsley in a 0–0 draw. John scored his first goal for Bristol City in a 4–1 defeat to Reading at Ashton Gate Stadium on 1 November 2008.

===Crystal Palace===
On 29 July 2009, John signed for Crystal Palace on a year-long deal after turning down an offer to stay at Southampton. He made his debut on the opening day of the season against Plymouth Argyle, he had to come off after 35 minutes due to an injury. He returned in mid-October, but joined Ipswich Town on a one-month loan at the end of November. He scored his first goal for Ipswich in a 3–2 win over Coventry City on 16 January 2010. Upon his return to Palace he scored his first goal for the club in a 3–1 win at Watford on 30 March 2010. New Palace manager George Burley had hoped to discuss the player&#x27;s future at the end of the season, but no discussion occurred, and John left the club.

===Solihull Moors===
In August 2012, after two seasons out of English football, John returned, signing for Solihull Moors. He did not make an appearance in any competition for the club.

===WASA FC===
John retired and moved back to his native Trinidad and Tobago after his spell at Solihull Moors. He came out of retirement a second time in order to join WASA FC of the National Super League of Trinidad and Tobago in January 2014. He scored on his debut

===Central F.C.===
John came out of retirement once again in 2016 when he was appointed as player-coach of Central F.C. in the TT Pro League.

==International career==
John made his international debut for Trinidad and Tobago national team on 15 February 1995 against Finland in a friendly at the Queen&#x27;s Park Oval, scoring one goal on his debut. He was a vital player for the &quot;Soca Warriors&quot; and remains the team&#x27;s all-time leading scorer with 70 goals in 115 caps. He was also the 7th highest international goalscorer at the time of his retirement in 2011. He is also the all-time top CONCACAF goal scorer.

John was instrumental in helping his country qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and played in all three of his country&#x27;s World Cup group matches at Germany 2006. In Germany, he scored an offside goal. He was also named Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation Player of the Year in 2002. John is currently the second most capped Trinidad and Tobago international behind former teammate Angus Eve. He was the only player to score in 12 consecutive international matches, from 1998 to 1999.

==Coaching career==
On 9 November 2020, John become the new manager of the Anguilla national team. On 23 May 2022, the Saint Lucia Football Association announced that John had taken over as head coach of the Saint Lucia national team.

==Personal life==
As a member of the squad that competed at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, John was awarded the Chaconia Medal (Gold Class), the second highest state decoration of Trinidad and Tobago.

<text>The Globe GC-1 Swift, also known as the Globe/Temco Swift, is a light, two-seat sport monoplane from the post–World War II period.

==Design and development==
The Swift was designed by R.S. &quot;Pop&quot; Johnson in 1940, despite the fanciful story which has now entered into popular mythology surrounding the Swift&#x27;s origin (that a Culver Cadet was obtained as a &quot;template&quot; aircraft). The design was financially secured by John Kennedy, president of the Globe Medicine Company, to be built by his new Globe Aircraft Company. World War II interrupted their plans, however, and the GC-1A Swift advertised as the &quot;All Metal Swift&quot; re-designed by K.H.&quot;Bud&quot; Knox, received its type certificate on 7 May 1946. Two prototypes were built but essentially, the design remained the same as the type which entered production. Globe built about 408 GC-1As.

Later that year, the Swift received a more powerful engine of , making it the GC-1B. Globe, together with TEMCO, built 833 GC-1Bs in six months. Globe&#x27;s production outpaced sales of the Swift; as a result Globe was forced into insolvency. TEMCO, the largest creditor, paid $328,000 to obtain the type certificate, tooling, aircraft, and parts allowing them to continue production in late 1947 hoping to recoup their losses. TEMCO built 260 more aircraft before ending Swift production in 1951.

The type certificate for the Swift was obtained by Universal Aircraft Industries (later Univair) along with all production tooling. Spare parts continued to be built until 1979 when the Swift Museum Foundation under the leadership of President Charlie Nelson purchased the Type Certificate, parts and tooling.

==Operational history==
The most unusual variant of the series became a separate design, the TEMCO TE-1 Buckaroo which was built in a short-run first as a contender for a USAF trainer aircraft contract, and was later transferred to foreign service as a military trainer. Several of these trainers have since returned to the civil market.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On June 28, 1952, a privately operated Temco Swift, aircraft registration &quot;N3858K&quot;, collided with American Airlines Flight 910, Douglas DC-6 &quot;N90750&quot;, over Dallas while both aircraft were on final approach to Dallas Love Field. The collision and ensuing crash killed both occupants of the Swift; the DC-6 landed safely with minor damage and no injuries to the 55 passengers and five crew. The accident was attributed to the Swift pilot&#x27;s failure to follow visual flight rules and exercise prudence during the landing approach. A contributing factor was air traffic control error.

<text>USS &quot;Ludlow&quot; (DD-112) was a built for the United States Navy during World War I.

==Description==

The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was an improved and faster version of the preceding . Two different designs were prepared to the same specification that mainly differed in the turbines and boilers used. The ships built to the Bethlehem Steel design, built in the Fore River and Union Iron Works shipyards, mostly used Yarrow boilers that deteriorated badly during service and were mostly scrapped during the 1930s. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a crew of 6 officers and 108 enlisted men.

Performance differed radically between the ships of the class, often due to poor workmanship. The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was powered by two steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of intended to reach a speed of . The ships carried of fuel oil which was intended gave them a range of at .

The ships were armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts and were fitted with two 1-pounder guns for anti-aircraft defense. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A &quot;Y-gun&quot; depth charge thrower was added to many ships.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Ludlow&quot; named for Augustus C. Ludlow, was laid down 7 January 1918 at Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California, launched 9 June 1918; sponsored by Miss Elizabeth Ludlow Chrystie, a descendant of Lieutenant Ludlow; and commissioned 23 December 1918. Following west coast shakedown, &quot;Ludlow&quot; embarked on the continuous training program. On 17 July 1920 she was reclassified as a light minelayer and redesignated DM-10, A change of home ports followed 19 January 1921 when she arrived at Pearl Harbor for eight years with Mine Squadron 2, Fleet Base Force.

&quot;Ludlow&quot; joined in gunnery practice, mining operations antisubmarine training, and fleet battle problems in the Hawaiian Islands and off the United States West Coast, and in 1929 trained Naval Reserves. Leaving Pearl Harbor 16 November 1929, she arrived San Diego on 26 November 1929, and there decommissioned on 24 May 1930. Struck from the Navy list on 18 November 1930, she was scrapped and her metal sold 10 March 1931.

<text>The Prague Spring International Music Festival (, commonly , Prague Spring) is a classical music festival held every year in Prague, Czech Republic, with symphony orchestras and chamber music ensembles from around the world.

The first festival was held in 1946 under the patronage of Czechoslovak president Edvard Beneš, and its organizing committee was made up of important figures in Czech musical life. In that year, the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra was celebrating its fiftieth anniversary and was therefore granted to appear in all of the orchestral concerts. The project was initiated by Rafael Kubelík, chief conductor of the orchestra at the time. Such musicians as Karel Ančerl, Leonard Bernstein, Sir Adrian Boult, Rudolf Firkušný, Jaroslav Krombholc, Rafael Kubelík, Moura Lympany, Yevgeny Mravinsky, Charles Münch, Ginette Neveu, Jarmila Novotná, Lev Oborin, David Oistrakh, Ken-Ichiro Kobayashi and Jan Panenka have appeared at the festival. Since 1952, the festival has opened on 12 May, the anniversary of the death of Bedřich Smetana, with his cycle of symphonic poems &quot;Má vlast&quot; (&quot;My Country&quot;), and it used to close (until 2003) with Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9.

The festival commemorates important musical anniversaries by including works by the composers concerned on its programmes, and presents Czech as well as world premieres of compositions by contemporary authors. Artists and orchestras who performed at the festival include Sviatoslav Richter, Lorin Maazel, Herbert von Karajan, Mstislav Rostropovich, Julian Lloyd Webber, Boris Pergamenschikow, Lucia Popp, Kim Borg, Sir Colin Davis, Maurice André, Dmitry Sitkovetsky, Leonid Kogan, Paul Klecki, Gustav Leonhardt, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Giovanni Bellucci, Alfred Brendel, Heinrich Schiff, Leopold Stokowski, Arthur Honegger, Arthur Rubinstein, and Gennady Rozhdestvensky.

Prague Spring&#x27;s traditional venue is the Rudolfinum concert hall, a neo-renaissance building situated on the bank of the Vltava River. It is complemented by Prague&#x27;s ornate Municipal House (), which has a larger seating capacity.

The Prague Spring has a particular focus on supporting younger performers. The Prague Spring International Music Competition was established just one year after the festival itself and is held each year in various instrumental sections. The list of past winners of competition includes Mstislav Rostropovich, Saša Večtomov, Natalia Gutman, James Galway and Maurice Bourgue.

<doc id="1031112" wikidata="Q4373725" url="?curid=1031112" title="USS Rathburne (DD-113)">
<text>USS &quot;Rathburne&quot; (DD–113) was a in the United States Navy during both World Wars. She was the first ship named for John Peck Rathbun.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Rathburne&quot; was laid down on 12 July 1917 by William Cramp &amp; Sons Company, Philadelphia. The ship was launched on 27 December 1917, sponsored by Miss Malinda B. Mull. The destroyer was commissioned on 24 June 1918.

==Service history==

===World War I===
During the final months of World War I, July to November 1918, &quot;Rathburne&quot; escorted coastal convoys from the mid-Atlantic seaboard as far north as Halifax, Nova Scotia and oceanic convoys to the Azores. Completing her last convoy at New York on 27 November, she remained there until the new year, 1919, then sailed south to Cuba for winter maneuvers. With the spring, she again crossed the Atlantic, operated from Brest during May and June, and returned to New York in July. In August she was transferred to the Pacific Fleet. West coast operations occupied the remainder of the year, while the first half of 1920 was spent in overhaul at Puget Sound. Designated DD-113 in July, she cruised the waters off Washington and in the Gulf of Alaska from August 1920 until January 1921, and then shifted south for operations off California.

In July, she headed west and in late August arrived at Cavite to join the Asiatic Fleet. Based there for almost a year, she departed the Philippines on 16 July 1922, cruised off the China coast into August and on 30 August sailed from Nagasaki en route to Midway, Pearl Harbor, and San Francisco. Arriving at the latter on 2 October, she soon shifted to San Diego, where she was decommissioned on 12 February 1923 and was berthed with the reserve fleet until 1930.

Recommissioned on 8 February 1930, &quot;Rathburne&quot; remained in the eastern Pacific, engaged in exercises including fleet problems involved with strategic scouting, tracking, attacking, and defense of convoys and the defense of the west coast, through 1933. In early 1934 she departed San Diego for the Panama Canal and the Caribbean Sea for Fleet Problem XV, a three-phased problem involving the attack and defense of the canal; the capture of advanced bases; and fleet action. A cruise along the east coast followed and in the fall she returned to San Diego.

===World War II===
Two years later she was transferred to the West Coast Sound Training Squadron, and, until early 1944, she was used primarily as a schoolship.

On 25 April 1944, she departed San Diego for Puget Sound and conversion to a high-speed transport. Reclassified APD-25 on 20 May, she returned to San Diego in June; underwent amphibious training, and in July steamed for Hawaii. During late July and early August, she trained with underwater demolition teams (UDT). On 10 August, UDT 10 reported aboard, and on 12 August, &quot;Rathburne&quot; continued west.

After rehearsals in the Solomons, &quot;Rathburne&quot; sortied from Purvis Bay with TG 32.5 on 6 September. Six days later, she arrived off the Palaus to begin her first combat operations, the Peleliu and Angaur preinvasion bombardment and minesweeping operations. On 14 September she offloaded UDT 10, supported them with gunfire as they cleared the approaches to the Angaur beaches, and reembarked them on 15 September. &quot;Rathburne&quot; resumed covering fire for UDT 8, after reembarking UDT 10, then on 16 September took up screening duties. On 19 September, she departed Angaur and headed for Ulithi, where UDT 10 reconnoitered the Falalop and Asor beaches, beginning on 21 September. By 23 September the atoll had been occupied and &quot;Rathburne&quot; moved south, to New Guinea and the Admiralties, to prepare for the invasion of Leyte.

On 18 October, the APD entered Leyte Gulf. The next day, UDT 10 went ashore on Red Beach in the northern assault area between Palo and San Ricardo. Through the morning, &quot;Rathburne&quot; provided covering fire and shortly after noon pulled the team off the beach. On 20 October, she covered the landings, and then shifted to fire support off the Dulag beaches. Detached, soon after her arrival, she began messenger and passenger runs between the northern and southern transport areas.

The next day, she transited Surigao Strait en route to Kossol Roads, the Admiralties, the Solomons, and New Caledonia. At the end of November she steamed west, for New Guinea. In December, she prepared for the Luzon offensive. On the 27th, she sailed for Lingayen Gulf.

Assigned to TU 77.2.1, the San Fabian fire support group, she acted as part of the antiaircraft screen en route and splashed two enemy planes on 5 January 1945. The following day she was in Lingayen Gulf, screening larger ships bombarding the assault area. On 7 January, she landed UDT 10 on Blue Beach and covered them as they reconnoitered the area to destroy natural and manmade obstacles. On the 8th she resumed bombardment activities.

On 9 January, troops went ashore, and from then until 11 January, &quot;Rathburne&quot; alternated fire support duty with patrols in the transport area. On 11 January, she got underway for Leyte, but 14 days later headed back to Luzon to provide support during the push against Manila. UDT 10, disembarked on 29 January, reported no opposition at San Narciso, but &quot;Rathburne&quot; remained in the area until after the landings.

By 3 February, &quot;Rathburne&quot; was back in San Pedro Bay, whence, the next day, she sailed for Saipan. From Saipan, she carried mail to Iwo Jima in early March, then at mid-month she returned to the Bonin-Volcano area for antisubmarine patrol duty. On 22 February, she departed the area; transported prisoners of war to Guam; and prepared for duty off Okinawa.

Escorting LST Group 91 en route, &quot;Rathburne&quot; arrived at Kerama Retto on 18 April. The next day, she shifted to the Hagushi anchorage and took up screening and escort duty.

On the evening of 27 April, she was on patrol off Hagushi. Air alerts had been called throughout the day. At about 2200, her radar picked up an enemy plane on the port quarter, out but closing fast.

Increasing speed, changing course, and antiaircraft fire did not deter the &quot;kamikaze&quot;. He crashed the port bow on the waterline. Three compartments were flooded. Sound gear was put out of commission. Fires broke out on the forecastle. But there were no casualties. Damage control parties soon extinguished the fires and contained the flooding. &quot;Rathburne&quot;, slowed to , made for Kerama Retto.

By mid-May, temporary repairs had been completed and she was underway for San Diego. Arriving on 18 June, she was reconverted to a destroyer and reclassified DD-113 on 20 July.

Still on the west coast when hostilities ceased in mid-August, &quot;Rathburne&quot; was ordered to the east coast for inactivation. Sailing on 29 September, she arrived at Philadelphia on 16 October and was decommissioned on 2 November 1945. Struck from the Navy list on 28 November, she was sold for scrapping to the Northern Metals Co, Philadelphia, in November 1946.

==Awards==

<text>Silviculture is the practice of controlling the growth, composition/structure, as well as quality of forests to meet values and needs, specifically timber production.

The name comes from the Latin (&#x27;forest&#x27;) and (&#x27;growing&#x27;). The study of forests and woods is termed &quot;silvology&quot;. Silviculture also focuses on making sure that the treatment(s) of forest stands are used to conserve and improve their productivity.

Generally, silviculture is the science and art of growing and cultivating forest crops based on a knowledge of silvics, the study of the life history and general characteristics of forest trees and stands, with reference to local/regional factors. The focus of silviculture is the control, establishment and management of forest stands. The distinction between forestry and silviculture is that silviculture is applied at the stand-level, while forestry is a broader concept. Adaptive management is common in silviculture, while forestry can include natural/conserved land without stand-level management and treatments being applied.

==Silvicultural systems==

The origin of forestry in German-speaking Europe has defined silvicultural systems broadly as high forest (), coppice with standards () and compound coppice, short rotation coppice, and coppice (). There are other systems as well. These varied silvicultural systems include several harvesting methods, which are often wrongly said to be a silvicultural systems, but may also be called rejuvenating or regenerating method depending on the purpose.

The high forest system is further subdivided in German: 
* High forest ()
** Age class forest ()
*** Even-aged forestry
**** Clear cutting ()
**** Shelterwood cutting ()
**** Seed-tree method
*** Uneven-aged forestry
**** The Femel selection cutting (group selection cutting) ()
**** Strip selection cutting (strip-and-group felling system) ()
**** Shelterwood wedge cutting ()
**** Mixed-form regeneration methods ()
** Continuous cover forestry ()
*** Uneven-aged forestry
**** Selection forest ()
**** Target diameter harvesting ()
These names give the impression is that these are neatly defined systems, but in practice there are variations within these harvesting methods in accordance with to local ecology and site conditions. While location of an archetypal form of harvesting technique can be identified (they all originated somewhere with a particular forester, and have been described in the scientific literature), and broad generalizations can be made, these are merely rules of thumb rather than strict blueprints on how techniques might be applied. This misunderstanding has meant that many older English textbooks did not capture the true complexity of silviculture as practiced where it originated in Mitteleuropa.

This silviculture was culturally predicated on wood production in temperate and boreal climates and did not deal with tropical forestry. The misapplication of this philosophy to those tropical forests has been problematic. There is also an alternative silvicultural tradition which developed in Japan and thus created a different biocultural landscape called &quot;satoyama&quot;.

After harvesting comes regeneration, which may be split into natural and artificial (see below), and tending, which includes release treatments, pruning, thinning and intermediate treatments. It is conceivable that any of these three phases (harvesting, regeneration, and tending) may happen at the same time within a stand, depending on the goal for that particular stand.

==Regeneration==
Regeneration is basic to the continuation of forested, as well as to the afforestation of treeless land. Regeneration can take place through self-sown seed (&quot;natural regeneration&quot;), by artificially sown seed, or by planted seedlings. In whichever case, the performance of regeneration depends on its growth potential and the degree to which its environment allows the potential to be expressed. Seed, of course, is needed for all regeneration modes, both for natural or artificial sowing and for raising planting stock in a nursery.

The process of natural regeneration involves the renewal of forests by means of self-sown seeds, root suckers, or coppicing. In natural forests, conifers rely almost entirely on regeneration through seed. Most of the broadleaves, however, are able to regenerate by the means of emergence of shoots from stumps (coppice) and broken stems.

===Seedbed requirements===

Any seed, self-sown or artificially applied, requires a seedbed suitable for securing germination.

In order to germinate, a seed requires suitable conditions of temperature, moisture, and aeration. For seeds of many species, light is also necessary, and facilitates the germination of seeds in other species, but spruces are not exacting in their light requirements, and will germinate without light. White spruce seed germinated at 35 °F (1.7 °C) and 40 °F (4.4 °C) after continuous stratification for one year or longer and developed radicles less than long in the cold room. When exposed to light, those germinants developed chlorophyll and were normally phototropic with continued elongation.

For survival in the short and medium terms, a germinant needs: a continuing supply of moisture; freedom from lethal temperature; enough light to generate sufficient photosynthate to support respiration and growth, but not enough to generate lethal stress in the seedling; freedom from browsers, tramplers, and pathogens; and a stable root system. Shade is very important to the survival of young seedlings. In the longer term, there must be an adequate supply of essential nutrients and an absence of smothering.

In undisturbed forest, decayed windfallen stemwood provides the most favorable seedbed for germination and survival. Seedlings growing on such sites are less likely to be buried by accumulated snowpack and leaf litter, and less likely to be subject to flooding. Advantages conferred by those microsites include: more light, higher temperatures in the rooting zone, and better mycorrhizal development. According to a 1940 survey in the Porcupine Hills of Manitoba, approximately 90% of spruce seedlings were germinating from this substrate.

Mineral soil seedbeds are more receptive than the undisturbed forest floor, and are generally moister and more readily rewetted than the organic forest floor. However, exposed mineral soil, much more so than organic-surfaced soil, is subject to frost heaving and shrinkage during drought. The forces generated in soil by frost or drought are quite enough to break roots.

The range of microsites occurring on the forest floor can be broadened, and their frequency and distribution influenced by site preparation. Each microsite has its own microclimate. Microclimates near the ground are better characterized by vapour pressure deficit and net incident radiation, rather than the standard measurements of air temperature, precipitation, and wind pattern.

Aspect is an important component of microclimate, especially in relation to temperature and moisture regimes. Germination and seedling establishment of Engelmann spruce were much better on north than on south aspect seedbeds in the Fraser Experimental Forest, Colorado; the ratios of seeds to 5-year-old seedlings were determined as 32:1, 76:1, and 72:1 on north aspect bladed-shaded, bladed-unshaded, and undisturbed-shaded seedbeds, respectively. Clearcut openings of adjacent to an adequate seed source, and not more than 6 tree-heights wide, could be expected to secure acceptable regeneration (4,900, 5-year-old trees per hectare), whereas on undisturbed-unshaded north aspects, and on all seedbed treatments tested on south aspects, seed to seedling ratios were so high that the restocking of any clearcut opening would be questionable.

At least seven variable factors may influence seed germination: seed characteristics, light, oxygen, soil reaction (pH), temperature, moisture, and seed enemies. Moisture and temperature are the most influential, and both are affected by exposure. The difficulty of securing natural regeneration of Norway spruce and Scots pine in northern Europe led to the adoption of various forms of reproduction cuttings that provided partial shade or protection to seedlings from hot sun and wind. The main objective of echeloned strips or border-cuttings with northeast exposure was to protect regeneration from overheating, and was originated in Germany and deployed successfully by A. Alarik in 1925 and others in Sweden. On south and west exposures, direct insolation and heat reflected from tree trunks often result in temperatures lethal to young seedlings, as well as desiccation of the surface soil, which inhibits germination. The sun is less injurious on eastern exposures because of the lower temperature in the early morning, related to higher humidity and presence of dew.

In 1993, Henry Baldwin, after noting that summer temperatures in North America are often higher than those in places where border-cuttings have been found useful, reported the results of a survey of regeneration in a stand of red spruce plus scattered white spruce that had been isolated by clearcutting on all sides, so furnishing an opportunity for observing regeneration on different exposures in this old-field stand at Dummer, New Hampshire. The regeneration included a surprisingly large number of balsam fir seedlings from the 5% stand component of that species. The maximum density of spruce regeneration, determined 4 rods (20 m) inside from the edge of the stand on a north 20°E exposure, was 600,000/ha, with almost 100,000 balsam fir seedlings.

A prepared seedbed remains receptive for a relatively short period, seldom as long as 5 years, sometimes as short as 3 years. Seedbed receptivity on moist, fertile sites decreases with particular rapidity, and especially on such sites, seedbed preparation should be scheduled to take advantage of good seed years. In poor seed years, site preparation can be carried out on mesic and drier sites with more chance of success, because of the generally longer receptivity of seedbeds there than those on moister sites. Although an indifferent seed year can suffice if seed distribution is good and environmental conditions favourable to seedling germination and survival, small amounts of seed are particularly vulnerable to depredation by small mammals. Considerable flexibility is possible in timing site preparation to coincide with cone crops. Treatment can be applied either before any logging takes place, between partial cuts, or after logging. In cut and leave strips, seedbed preparation can be carried out as a single operation, pre-scarifying the leave strips, post-scarifying the cut strips.

Broadcast burning is not recommended as a method of preparing sites for natural regeneration, as it rarely exposes enough mineral soil to be sufficiently receptive, and the charred organic surfaces are a poor seedbed for spruce. A charred surface may get too hot for good germination and may delay germination until fall, with subsequent overwinter mortality of unhardened seedlings. Piling and burning of logging slash, however, can leave suitable exposures of mineral soil.

===Season of planting===
==Artificial regeneration==

With a view to reducing the time needed to produce planting stock, experiments were carried out with white spruce and three other coniferous species from Wisconsin seed in the longer, frost-free growing season in Florida, 125 vs. 265 days in central Wisconsin and northern Florida, respectively. As the species studied are adapted to long photoperiods, extended daylengths of 20 hours were applied in Florida. Other seedlings were grown under extended daylength in Wisconsin and with natural daylength in both areas. After two growing seasons, white spruce under long days in Florida were about the same as those in Wisconsin, but twice as tall as plants under natural Wisconsin photoperiods. Under natural days in Florida, with the short local photoperiod, white spruce was severely dwarfed and had a low rate of survival. Black spruce responded similarly. After two growing seasons, long day plants of all 4 species in Florida were well balanced, with good development of both roots and shoots, equaling or exceeding the minimum standards for 2+1 and 2+2 outplanting stock of Lake States species. Their survival when lifted in February and outplanted in Wisconsin equalled that of 2+2 Wisconsin-grown transplants. Artificial extension of the photoperiod in the northern Lake States greatly increased height increment of white and black spruces in the second growing season.

Optimum conditions for seedling growth have been determined for the production of containerized planting stock. Alternating day/night temperatures have been found more suitable than a constant temperature; at 400 lumens/m2 light regime, a 28 °C/20 °C day/night temperatures have been recommended for white spruce. However, temperature optima are not necessarily the same at different ages and sizes. In 1984, R. Tinus investigated the effects of combinations of day and night temperature on height, caliper, and dry weight of 4 seed sources of Engelmann spruce. The 4 seed sources appeared to have very similar temperature requirements, with night optima about the same of slightly lower than daylight optima.

Tree provenance is important in artificial regeneration. Good provenance takes into account suitable tree genetics and a good environmental fit for planted / seeded trees in a forest stand. The wrong genotype can lead to failed regeneration, or poor trees that are prone to pathogens and undesired outcomes.

Artificial regeneration has been a more common method involving planting because it is more dependable than natural regeneration. Planting can involve using seedlings (from a nursery), (un)rooted cuttings, or seeds.

Whichever method is chosen it can be assisted by tending techniques also known as intermediate stand treatments.

The fundamental genetic consideration in artificial regeneration is that seed and planting stock must be adapted to the planting environment. Most commonly, the method of managing seed and stock deployment is through a system of defined seed zones, within which seed and stock can be moved without risk of climatic maladaptation. Ontario adopted a seed zone system in the 1970s based on G.A. Hills&#x27; 1952 site regions and provincial resource district boundaries, but Ontario&#x27;s seed zones are now based on homogeneous climatic regions developed with the Ontario Climate Model. The regulations stipulate that source-identified seedlots may be either a general collection, when only the seed zone of origin is known, or a stand collection from a specific latitude and longitude. The movement of general-collection seed and stock across seed zone boundaries is prohibited, but the use of stand-collection seed and stock in another seed zone is acceptable when the Ontario Climate Model shows that the planting site and place of seed origin are climatically similar. The 12 seed zones for white spruce in Quebec are based mainly on ecological regions, with a few modifications for administrative convenience.

Seed quality varies with source. Seed orchards produce seed of the highest quality, then, in order of decreasing seed quality produced, seed production areas and seed collection areas follow, with controlled general collections and uncontrolled general collections producing the least characterized seed.

===Seeds===

====Dewinging, extraction====

When seed is first separated from cones it is mixed with foreign matter, often 2 to 5 times the volume of the seed. The more or less firmly attached membranous wings on the seed must be detached before it is cleaned of foreign matter. The testa must not incur damage during the dewinging process. Two methods have been used, dry and wet. Dry seed may be rubbed gently through a sieve that has a mesh through which only seed without wings can pass. Large quantities of seed can be processed in dewinging machines, which use cylinders of heavy wire mesh and rapidly revolving stiff brushes within to remove the wings. In the wet process, seed with wings attached are spread out 10 cm to 15 cm deep on a tight floor and slightly moistened throughout; light leather flails are used to free seed from the wings. B. Wang described a unique wet dewinging procedure in 1973 using a cement mixer, used at the Petawawa tree seed processing facility. Wings of white and Norway spruce seed can be removed by dampening the seed slightly before it is run through a fanning mill for the last time. Any moistened seed must be dried before fermentation or moulding sets in.

====Seed viability====

A fluorescein diacetate (FDA) biochemical viability test for several species of conifer seed, including white spruce, estimates the proportion of live seed (viability) in a seedlot, and hence the percentage germination of a seedlot. The accuracy of predicting percentage germination was within +/- 5 for most seedlots. White spruce seed can be tested for viability by an indirect method, such as the fluorescein diacetate (FDA) test or ‘Ultra-sound&#x27;; or by the direct growth method of ‘germination&#x27;. Samples of white spruce seed inspected in 1928 varied in viability from 50% to 100%, but averaged 93%. A 1915 inspection reported 97% viability for white spruce seed.

====Germinative testing====

The results of a germination test are commonly expressed as &quot;germinative capacity&quot; or a &quot;germination percentage&quot;, which is the percentage of seeds that germinate during a period of time, ending when germination is practically complete. During extraction and processing, white spruce seeds gradually lost moisture, and total germination increased. Mittal et al. (1987) reported that white spruce seed from Algonquin Park, Ontario, obtained the maximum rate (94% in 6 days) and 99% total germination in 21 days after 14-week pre-chilling. The pre-treatment of 1% sodium hypochlorite increased germinability.

Encouraged by Russian success in using ultrasonic waves to improve the germinative energy and percentage germination of seeds of agricultural crops, Timonin (1966) demonstrated benefits to white spruce germination after exposure of seeds to 1, 2, or 4 minutes of ultrasound generated by an M.S.E. ultrasonic disintegrator with a power consumption of 280 VA and power impact of 1.35 amperes. However, no seeds germinated after 6 minutes of exposure to ultrasound.

====Seed dormancy====

Seed dormancy is a complex phenomenon and is not always consistent within species. Cold stratification of white spruce seed to break dormancy has been specified as a requirement, but Heit (1961) and Hellum (1968) regarded stratification as unnecessary. Cone handling and storage conditions affect dormancy in that cold, humid storage (5 °C, 75% to 95% relative humidity) of the cones prior to extraction seemingly eliminated dormancy by overcoming the need to stratify. Periods of cold, damp weather during the period of cone storage might provide natural cold (stratification) treatment. Once dormancy was removed in cone storage, subsequent kiln-drying and seed storage did not reactivate dormancy.

Haddon and Winston (1982) found a reduction in viability of stratified seeds after 2 years of storage and suggested that stress might have been caused by stratification, e.g., by changes in seed biochemistry, reduced embryo vigor, seed aging or actual damage to the embryo. They further questioned the quality of the 2-year-old seed even though high germination occurred in the samples that were not stratified.

====Cold stratification====

Cold stratification is the term applied to the storing of seeds in (and, strictly, in layers with) a moist medium, often peat or sand, with a view to maintaining viability and overcoming dormancy. Cold stratification is the term applied to storage at near-freezing temperatures, even if no medium is used. A common method of cold stratification, is to soak seed in tap water for up to 24 h, superficially dry it, then store moist for some weeks or even months at temperatures just above freezing. Although Hellum (1968) found that cold stratification of an Alberta seed source led to irregular germination, with decreasing germination with increasing length of the stratification period, Hocking&#x27;s (1972) paired test with stratified and nonstratified Alberta seed from several sources revealed no trends in response to stratification. Hocking suggested that seed maturity, handling, and storage needed to be controlled before the need for stratification could be determined. Later, Winston and Haddon (1981) found that the storage of white spruce cones for 4 weeks at 5 °C prior to extraction obviated the need for stratification.

====Seed ripeness====

Seed maturity cannot be predicted accurately from cone flotation, cone moisture content, cone specific gravity; but the province of B.C. found embryo occupying 90% + of the corrosion cavity and megagametophyte being firm and whitish in colour are the best predictors for white spruce in B.C., and Quebec can forecast seed maturity some weeks in advance by monitoring seed development in relation to heat-sums and the phenological progression of the inflorescence of fireweed (&quot;Epilobium angustifolium&quot; L.), an associated plant species. Cone collection earlier than one week before seed maturity would reduce seed germination and viability during storage. Four stages of maturation were determined by monitoring carbohydrates, polyols, organic acids, respiration, and metabolic activity. White spruce seeds require a 6-week post-harvest ripening period in the cones to obtain maximum germinability, however, based on cumulative degree-days, seed from the same trees and stand showed 2-week cone storage was sufficient.

===Plantation establishment criteria===

Plantations may be considered successful when outplant performance satisfies certain criteria. The term &quot;free growing&quot; is applied in some jurisdictions. Ontario&#x27;s &quot;Free-to-Grow&quot; (FTG) equivalent relates to a forest stand that meets a minimum stocking standard and height requirement, and is essentially free of competition from surrounding vegetation that might impede growth. The FTG concept was introduced with the advent of the Forest Management Agreement program in Ontario in 1980 and became applicable to all management units in 1986. Policy, procedures, and methodologies readily applicable by forest unit managers to assess the effectiveness of regeneration programs were still under development during the Class Environmental Assessment hearings.

In British Columbia, the Forest Practices Code (1995) governs performance criteria. To minimize the subjectivity of assessing deciduous competition as to whether or not a plantation is established, minimum specifications of number, health, height, and competition have been specified in British Columbia. However, minimum specifications are still subjectively set and may need to be fine-tuned in order to avoid unwarranted delay in according established status to a plantation. For example, a vigorous white spruce with a strong, multi-budded leading shoot and its crown fully exposed to light on 3 sides would not qualify as free-growing in the current British Columbia Code but would hardly warrant description as unestablished.

==Competition==

Competition arises when individual organisms are sufficiently close together to incur growth constraint through mutual modification of the local environment. Plants may compete for light, moisture and nutrients, but seldom for space &quot;per se&quot;. Vegetation management directs more of the site&#x27;s resources into usable forest products, rather than just eliminating all competing plants. Ideally, site preparation ameliorates competition to levels that relieve the outplant of constraints severe enough to cause prolonged check.

The diversity of boreal and sub-boreal broadleaf-conifer mixed tree species stands, commonly referred to as the &quot;mixedwoods&quot;, largely preclude the utility of generalizations and call for the development of management practices incorporating the greater inherent complexity of broadleaf-conifer mixtures, relative to single-species or mixed-species conifer forest. After harvesting or other disturbance, mixedwood stands commonly enter a prolonged period in which hardwoods overtop the coniferous component, subjecting them to intense competition in an understorey. It is well established that the regeneration and growth potential of understorey conifers in mixedwood stands is correlated to the density of competing hardwoods. To help apply &quot;free-to-grow&quot; regulations in British Columbia and Alberta, management guidelines based on distance-dependent relations within a limited radius of crop trees were developed, but Lieffers et al. (2002) found that free-growing stocking standards did not adequately characterize light competition between broadleaf and conifer components in boreal mixedwood stands, and further noted that adequate sampling using current approaches would be operationally prohibitive.

Many promising plantations have failed through lack of tending. Young crop trees are often ill-equipped to fight it out with competition resurgent following initial site preparation and planting.

Perhaps the most direct evaluation of the effect of competition on plantation establishment is provided by an effective herbicide treatment, given it is performed correctly and without contamination of waters of the state. The fact that herbicide treatment does not always produce positive results should not obscure the demonstrated potential of herbicides for significantly promoting plantation establishment. Factors that can vitiate the effectiveness of a herbicide treatment include: weather, especially temperature, prior to and during application; weather, especially wind, during application; weather, especially precipitation, in the 12 to 24 hours after application; vegetation characteristics, including species, size, shape, phenological stage, vigour, and distribution of weeds; crop characteristics, including species, phenology, and condition; the effects of other treatments, such as preliminary shearblading, burning or other prescribed or accidental site preparation; and the herbicide used, including dosage, formulation, carrier, spreader, and mode of application. There is a lot that can go wrong, but a herbicide treatment can be as good or better than any other method of site preparation.

===Competition indices===

The study of competition dynamics requires both a measure of the competition level and a measure of crop response. Various competition indices have been developed, e.g., by Bella (1971) and Hegyi (1974) based on stem diameter, by Arney (1972), Ek and Monserud (1974), and Howard and Newton (1984) based on canopy development, and Daniels (1976), Wagner (1982), and Weiner (1984) with proximity-based models. Studies generally considered tree response to competition in terms of absolute height or basal area, but Zedaker (1982) and Brand (1986) sought to quantify crop tree size and environmental influences by using relative growth measures.

==Tending==

Tending is the term applied to pre-harvest silvicultural treatment of forest crop trees at any stage after initial planting or seeding. The treatment can be of the crop itself (e.g., spacing, pruning, thinning, and improvement cutting) or of competing vegetation (e.g., weeding, cleaning).

===Planting===

How many trees per unit area (spacing) that should be planted is not an easily answered question. Establishment density targets or regeneration standards have commonly been based on traditional practice, with the implicit aim of getting the stand quickly to the free-to-grow stage. Money is wasted if more trees are planted than are needed to achieve desired stocking rates, and the chance to establish other plantations is proportionately diminished. Ingress (natural regeneration) on a site is difficult to predict and often becomes surprisingly evident only some years after planting has been carried out. Early stand development after harvesting or other disturbance undoubtedly varies greatly among sites, each of which has its own peculiar characteristics.

For all practical purposes, the total volume produced by a stand on a given site is constant and optimum for a wide range of density or stocking. It can be decreased, but not increased, by altering the amount of growing stock to levels outside this range. Initial density affects stand development in that close spacing leads to full site utilization more quickly than wider spacing. Economic operability can be advanced by wide spacing even if total production is less than in closely spaced stands.

Beyond the establishment stage, the relationship of average tree size and stand density is very important. Various density-management diagrams conceptualizing the density-driven stand dynamics have been developed. Smith and Brand&#x27;s (1988) diagram has mean tree volume on the vertical axis and the number of trees/ha on the horizontal axis: a stand can either have many little trees or a few big ones. The self-thinning line shows the largest number of trees of a given size/ha that can be carried at any given time. However, Willcocks and Bell (1995) caution against using such diagrams unless specific knowledge of the stand trajectory is known.

In the Lake States, plantations have been made with the spacing between trees varying from 3 by 3 to 10 by 10 feet (0.9 m by 0.9 m to 3.0 m by 3.0 m). Kittredge recommended that no fewer than 600 established trees per acre (1483/ha) be present during the early life of a plantation. To insure this, at least 800 trees per acre (1077/ha) should be planted where 85% survival may be expected, and at least 1200/ac (2970/ha) if only half of them can be expected to live. This translates into recommended spacings of 5 by 5 to 8 by 8 feet (1.5 m by 1.5 m to 2.4 m by 2.4 m) for plantings of conifers, including white spruce in the Lake States.

===Enrichment planting===

A strategy for enhancing natural forests&#x27; economic value is to increase their concentration of economically important, indigenous tree species by planting seeds or seedlings for future harvest, which can be accomplished with enrichment planting (EP).

===Release treatments===
* Weeding: A process of getting rid of saplings&#x27; or seedlings&#x27; competition by mowing, application of herbicide, or other method of removal from the surroundings.
* Cleaning: Release of select saplings from competition by overtopping trees of a comparable age. The treatment favors trees of a desired species and stem quality.
* Liberation cutting: A treatment that releases tree seedling or saplings by removing older overtopping trees.

===Spacing===

Over-crowded regeneration tends to stagnate. The problem is aggravated in species that have little self-pruning ability, such as white spruce. Spacing is a thinning (of natural regeneration), in which all trees other than those selected for retention at fixed intervals are cut. The term juvenile spacing is used when most or all of the cut trees are unmerchantable. Spacing can be used to obtain any of a wide range of forest management objectives, but it is especially undertaken to reduce density and control stocking in young stands and prevent stagnation, and to shorten the rotation, i.e., to speed the production of trees of a given size. Volume growth of individual trees and the merchantable growth of stands are increased. The primary rationale for spacing is that thinning is the projected decline in maximum allowable cut. And since wood will be concentrated on fewer, larger, and more uniform stems, operating and milling costs will be minimized.

Methods for spacing may be: manual, using various tools, including power saws, brush saws, and clippers; mechanical, using choppersand mulchers; chemical; or combinations of several methods. One treatment has had notable success in spacing massively overstocked (&lt;100 000 stems/ha) natural regeneration of spruce and fir in Maine. Fitted to helicopter, the Thru-Valve boom emits herbicide spray droplets 1000 μm to 2000 μm in diameter at very low pressure. Swaths 1.2 m wide and leave strips 2.4 m wide were obtained with &quot;knife-edge&quot; precision when the herbicide was applied by helicopter flying at a height of 21 m at a speed of 40–48 km/h. It seems likely that no other method could be as cost-effective.

Twenty years after spacing to 2.5 × 2.5 m, 30-year-old mixed stands of balsam fir and white spruce in the Green River watershed, New Brunswick, averaged 156.9 m3/ha.

A spacing study of 3 conifers (white spruce, red pine and jack pine) was established at Moodie, Manitoba, on flat, sandy, nutritionally poor soils with a fresh moisture regime. Twenty years after planting, red pine had the largest average dbh, 15% greater than jack pine, while white spruce dbh was less than half that of the pines. Crown width showed a gradual increase with spacing for all 3 conifers. Results to date were suggesting optimum spacings between 1.8 m and 2.4 m for both pines; white spruce was not recommended for planting on such sites.

Comparable data are generated by espacement trials, in which trees are planted at a range of densities. Spacings of 1.25 m, 1.50 m, 1.75 m, 2.00 m, 2.50 m, and 3.00 m on 4 site classes were used in the 1922 trial at Petawawa, Ontario. In the first of 34 old field white spruce plantations used to investigate stand development in relation to spacing at Petawawa, Ontario, regular rows were planted at average spacings of from 4 × 4 to 7 × 7 feet (1.22 m × 1.22 m to 2.13 m × 2.13 m). Spacings up to 10 × 10 feet (3.05 m × 3.03 m) were subsequently included in the study. Yield tables based on 50 years of data showed:

* Except for merchantable volumes at age 20 and site classes 50 and 60, closer spacings gave greater standing volumes at all ages than did wider spacings, the relative difference decreasing with age.
* Merchantable volume as a proportion of total volume increases with age, and is greater at wider than at closer spacings.
* Current annual volume increment culminates sooner at closer than at wider spacings.

A smaller espacement trial, begun in 1951 near Thunder Bay, Ontario, included white spruce at spacings of 1.8 m, 2.7 m, and 3.6 m. At the closest spacing, mortality had begun at 37 years, but not at the wider spacings.

The oldest interior spruce espacement trial in British Columbia was established in 1959 near Houston in the Prince Rupert Forest Region. Spacings of 1.2 m, 2.7 m, 3.7 m, and 4.9 m were used, and trees were measured 6, 12, 16, 26, and 30 years after planting. At wide espacements, trees developed larger diameters, crowns, and branches, but (at 30 years) basal area and total volume/ha were greatest in the closest espacement (Table 6.38). In more recent trials in the Prince George Region of British Columbia (Table 6.39) and in Manitoba, planting density of white spruce had no effect on growth after up to 16 growing seasons, even at spacings as low as 1.2 m. The slowness of juvenile growth and of crown closure delay the response to intra-competition. Initially, close spacing might even provide a positive nurse effect to offset any negative response to competition.

===Thinning===

See Thinning

Thinning is an operation that artificially reduces the number of trees growing in a stand with the aim of hastening the development of the remainder. The goal of thinning is to control the amount and distribution of available growing space. By altering stand density, foresters can influence the growth, quality, and health of residual trees. It also provides an opportunity to capture mortality and cull the commercially less desirable, usually smaller and malformed, trees. Unlike regeneration treatments, thinnings are not intended to establish a new tree crop or create permanent canopy openings.

Thinning greatly influences the ecology and micro-meteorology of the stand, lowering the inter-tree competition for water. The removal of any tree from a stand has repercussions on the remaining trees both above-ground and below. Silvicultural thinning is a powerful tool that can be used to influence stand development, stand stability, and the characteristics of the harvestable products.

Tending and thinning regimes and wind and snow damage are intimately related when considering intensive conifer plantations designed for maximum production.

Previous studies have demonstrated that repeated thinnings over the course of a forest rotation increase carbon stores relative to stands that are clear-cut on short rotations and that the carbon benefits differ according to thinning method (e.g., thinning from above versus below).

====Precommercial thinning====
In the early development of forest stand, density of trees remain high and there is competition among trees for nutrients. When natural regeneration or artificial seeding has resulted in dense, overstocked young stands, natural thinning will in most cases eventually reduce stocking to more silviculturally desirable levels. But by the time some trees reach merchantable size, others will be overmature and defective, and others will still be unmerchantable. To reduce this unbalance and to obtain more economic returns, in the early stage, one kind of cleaning is done which is known as precommercial thinning. Generally, one or two times precommercial thinning is done to facilitate the growth of the tree
The yield of merchantable wood can be greatly increased and the rotation shortened by precommercial thinning. Mechanical and chemical methods have been applied, but their costliness has militated against their ready adoption.

===Pruning===
Pruning, as a silvicultural practice, refers to the removal of the lower branches of the young trees (also giving the shape to the tree) so clear knot-free wood can subsequently grow over the branch stubs. Clear knot-free lumber has a higher value. Pruning has been extensively carried out in the Radiata pine plantations of New Zealand and Chile; however, the development of finger joint technology in the production of lumber and mouldings has led to many forestry companies reconsidering their pruning practices. &quot;Brashing&quot; is an alternative name for the same process.
Pruning can be done to all trees, or more cost effectively to a limited number of trees. There are two types of pruning: natural or self-pruning and artificial pruning. Most cases of self-pruning happen when branches do not receive enough sunlight and die. Wind can also take part in natural pruning which can break branches. Artificial pruning is where people are paid to come and cut the branches. Or it can be natural, where trees are planted close enough that the effect is to cause self-pruning of low branches as energy is put into growing up for light reasons and not branchiness.

===Stand Conversion===

The term &quot;stand conversion&quot; refers to a change from one silvicultural system to another and includes &quot;species conversion&quot;, i.e., a change from one species (or set of species) to another. Such change can be effected intentionally by various silvicultural means, or incidentally by default e.g., when high-grading has removed the coniferous content from a mixedwood stand, which then becomes exclusively self-perpetuating aspen. In general, such sites as these are the most likely to be considered for conversion.

==Growth and yield==

In discussing yields that might be expected from the Canadian spruce forests, Haddock (1961) noted that Wright&#x27;s (1959) quotation of spruce yields in the British Isles of 220 cubic feet per acre (15.4 m3/ha) per year and in Germany of 175 cubic feet per acre (12.25 m3/ha) per year was misleading, at least if it was meant to imply that such yields might be approached in the Boreal Forest Region of Canada. Haddock thought that Wright&#x27;s suggestion of 20 to 40 (average 30) cubic feet per acre (1.4 m3/ha to 2.8 m3/ha (average 2.1 m3/ha) per year was more reasonable, but still somewhat optimistic.

The principal way forest resource managers influence growth and yield is to manipulate the mixture of species and number (density) and distribution (stocking) of individuals that form the canopy of the stand. Species composition of much of the boreal forest in North America already differs greatly from its pre-exploitation state. There is less spruce and more hardwoods in the second-growth forest than in the original forest; Hearnden et al. (1996) calculated that the spruce cover type had declined from 18% to only 4% of the total forested area in Ontario. Mixedwood occupies a greater proportion of Ontario&#x27;s second-growth forest (41%) than in the original (36%), but its component of white spruce is certainly much diminished.

Growth performance is certainly influenced by site conditions and thus by the kind and degree of site preparation in relation to the nature of the site. It is important to avoid the assumption that site preparation of a particular designation will have a particular silvicultural outcome. Scarification, for instance, not only covers a wide range of operations that scarify, but also any given way of scarifying can have significantly different results depending on site conditions at the time of treatment. In point of fact, the term is commonly misapplied. &quot;Scarification&quot; is defined as &quot;loosening the top soil of open areas, or breaking up the forest floor, in preparation for regenerating by direct seeding or natural seedfall&quot;, but the term is often misapplied to practices that include scalping, screefing, and blading, which pare off low and surface vegetation, together with most off its roots to expose a weed-free surface, generally in preparation for sowing or planting thereon.

Thus, it is not surprising that literature can be used to support the view that the growth of seedlings on scarified sites is much superior to that of growth on similar sites that have not been scarified, while other evidence supports the contrary view that scarification can reduce growth. Detrimental results can be expected from scarification that impoverishes the rooting zone or exacerbates edaphic or climatic constraints.

Burning site preparation has enhanced spruce seedling growth, but it must be supposed that burning could be detrimental if the nutrient capital is significantly depleted. An obvious factor greatly influencing regeneration is competition from other vegetation. In a pure stand of Norway spruce, for instance, Roussel (1948) found the following relationships:

A factor of some importance in solar radiation–reproduction relationships is excess heating of the soil surface by radiation. This is especially important for seedlings, such as spruce, whose first leaves do not shade the base of the stem at the soil surface. Surface temperatures in sandy soils on occasion reach lethal temperatures of 50 °C to 60 °C.

==Common methods of harvesting==
Silvicultural regeneration methods combine both the harvest of the timber on the stand and re-establishment of the forest. The proper practice of sustainable forestry should mitigate the potential negative impacts, but all harvest methods will have some impacts on the land and residual stand. The practice of sustainable forestry limits the impacts such that the values of the forest are maintained in perpetuity. Silvicultural prescriptions are specific solutions to a specific set of circumstances and management objectives. Following are some common methods:

===Clearcut harvesting===
Conventional clearcut harvesting is relatively simple: all trees on a cutblock are felled and bunched with bunches aligned to the skidding direction, and a skidder then drags the bunches to the closest log deck. Feller-buncher operators concentrate on the width of the felled swath, the number of trees in a bunch, and the alignment of the bunch. Providing a perimeter boundary is felled during daylight, night-shift operations can continue without the danger of trespassing beyond the block. Productivity of equipment is maximized because units can work independently of one another.

===Clearcutting===
An even-aged regeneration method that can employ either natural or artificial regeneration. It involves the complete removal of the forest stand at one time. Clearcutting can be biologically appropriate with species that typically regenerate from stand replacing fires or other major disturbances, such as Lodgepole Pine (&quot;Pinus contorta&quot;). Alternatively, clearcutting can change the dominating species on a stand with the introduction of non-native and invasive species as was shown at the Blodgett Forest Research Station near Georgetown, California. Additionally, clearcutting can prolong slash decomposition, expose soil to erosion, impact visual appeal of a landscape and remove essential wildlife habitat. It is particularly useful in regeneration of tree species such as Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot;) which is shade intolerant.. In addition, the general public&#x27;s distaste for even-aged silviculture, particularly clearcutting, is likely to result in a greater role for uneven-aged management on public lands as well. Across Europe, and in parts of North America, even-aged, production-orientated and intensively managed plantations are beginning to be regarded in the same way as old industrial complexes: something to abolish or convert to something else.

Clearcutting will impact many site factors important in their effect on regeneration, including air and soil temperatures. Kubin and Kemppainen (1991), for instance, measured temperatures in northern Finland from 1974 through 1985 in three clear-felled areas and in three neighbouring forest stands dominated by Norway spruce. Clear felling had no significant influence on air temperature at 2 m above the ground surface, but the daily air temperature maxima at 10 cm were greater in the clear-felled area than in the uncut forest, while the daily minima at 10 cm were lower. Night frosts were more common in the clear-felled area. Daily soil temperatures at 5 cm depth were 2 °C to 3 °C greater in the clear-felled area than in the uncut forest, and temperatures at depths of 50 cm and 100 cm were 3 °C to 5 °C greater. The differences between the clear-felled and uncut areas did not diminish during the 12 years following cutting.

===Coppicing===
A regeneration method which depends on the sprouting of cut trees. Most hardwoods, the coast redwood, and certain pines naturally sprout from stumps and can be managed through coppicing. Coppicing is generally used to produce fuelwood, pulpwood, and other products dependent on small trees. A close relative of coppicing is pollarding. Three systems of coppice woodland management are generally recognized: simple coppice, coppice with standards, and the coppice selection system.
*In Compound coppicing or coppicing with standards, some of the highest quality trees are retained for multiple rotations in order to obtain larger trees for different purposes.

===Direct seeding===
Prochnau (1963), four years after sowing, found that 14% of viable white spruce seed sown on mineral soil had produced surviving seedlings, at a seed:seedling ratio of 7.1:1. With Engelmann spruce, Smith and Clark (1960) obtained average seventh year seed:seedling ratios of 21:1 on scarified seedbeds on dry sites, 38:1 on moist sites, and 111:1 on litter seedbeds.

===Group selection===
The group selection method is an uneven-aged regeneration method that can be used when mid-tolerant species regeneration is desired. The group selection method can still result in residual stand damage in dense stands, however directional falling can minimize the damage. Additionally, foresters can select across the range of diameter classes in the stand and maintain a mosaic of age and diameter classes.
Classical European silviculture achieved impressive results with systems such as Henri Biolley&#x27;s in Switzerland, in which the number and size of trees harvested were determined by reference to data collected from every tree in every stand measured every seven years.

While not designed to be applied to boreal mixedwoods, the is described briefly here to illustrate the degree of sophistication applied by some European foresters to the management of their forests. Development of management techniques that allowed for stand development to be monitored and guided into sustainable paths were in part a response to past experience, particularly in Central European countries, of the negative effects of pure, uniform stands with species often unsuited to the site, which greatly increased the risk of soil degradation and biotic diseases. Increased mortality and decreased increment generated widespread concern, especially after reinforcement by other environmental stresses.

More or less uneven-aged, mixed forests of preponderantly native species, on the other hand, treated along natural lines, have proved to be healthier and more resistant to all kinds of external dangers; and in the long run such stands are more productive and easier to protect.

However, irregular stands of this type are definitely more difficult to manage—new methods and techniques had to be sought particularly for the establishment of inventories, as well as increment control and yield regulation. In Germany, for instance, since the beginning of the nineteenth century under the influence of G.L. Hartig (1764–1837), yield regulation has been effected almost exclusively by allotment or formula methods based on the conception of the uniform normal forest with a regular succession of cutting areas.

In France, on the other hand, efforts were made to apply another kind of forest management, one that aimed to bring all parts of the forest to a state of highest productive capacity in perpetuity. In 1878, the French forester A. Gurnaud (1825–1898) published a description of a for determining increment and yield. The method was based on the fact that through careful, selective harvesting, the productivity of the residual stand can be improved, because timber is removed as a cultural operation. In this method, the increment of stands is accurately determined periodically with the object of gradually converting the forest, through selective management and continuous experimentation, to a condition of equilibrium at maximum productive capacity.

Henri Biolley (1858–1939) was the first to apply Gurnaud&#x27;s inspired ideas to practical forestry. From 1890 on, he managed the forests of his Swiss district according to these principles, devoting himself for almost 50 years to the study of increment and a treatment of stands directed towards the highest production, and proving the practicability of the check method. In 1920, he published this study giving a theoretical basis of management of forests under the check method, describing the procedures to be applied in practice (which he partly developed and simplified), and evaluating the results.

Biolley&#x27;s pioneering work formed the basis upon which most Swiss forest management practices were later developed, and his ideas have been generally accepted. Today, with the trend of intensifying forest management and productivity in most countries, the ideas and application of careful, continuous treatment of stands with the aid of the volume check method are meeting with ever-growing interest. In Britain and Ireland, for example, there is increased application of continuous cover forestry principles to create permanently irregular structures in many woodlands.

===Patch cut===

===Row and broadcast seeding===
Spot and row seeders use less seed that does broadcast ground or aerial seeding but may induce clumping. Row and spot seeding confer greater ability to control seed placement than does broadcast seeding. Also, only a small percentage of the total area needs to be treated.

In the aspen type of the Great Lakes region, direct sowing of the seed of conifers has usually failed. However, Gardner (1980) after trials in Yukon, which included broadcast seeding of white spruce seed at 2.24 kg/ha that secured 66.5% stocking in the Scarified Spring Broadcast treatment three years after seeding, concluded that the technique held &quot;considerable promise&quot;.

===Seed-tree===
An even-aged regeneration method that retains widely spaced residual trees in order to provide uniform seed dispersal across a harvested area. In the seed-tree method, 2-12 seed trees per acre (5-30/ha) are left standing in order to regenerate the forest. They will be retained until regeneration has become established at which point they may be removed. It may not always be economically viable or biologically desirable to re-enter the stand to remove the remaining seed trees. Seed-tree cuts can also be viewed as a clearcut with natural regeneration and can also have all of the problems associated with clearcutting. This method is most suited for light-seeded species and those not prone to windthrow.

===Selection systems===
Selection systems are appropriate where uneven stand structure is desired, particularly where the need to retain continuous cover forest for aesthetic or environmental reasons outweighs other management considerations. Selection logging has been suggested as being of greater utility than shelterwood systems in regenerating old-growth Engelmann Spruce Sub-alpine Fir (ESSF) stands in southern British Columbia. In most areas, selection logging favours regeneration of fir more than the more light-demanding spruce. In some areas, selection logging can be expected to favour spruce over less tolerant hardwood species (Zasada 1972) or lodgepole pine.

===Shelter spot seeding===
The use of shelters to improve germination and survival in spot seedings seeks to capture the benefits of greenhouse culture, albeit miniature. The Hakmet seed shelter, for instance, is a semi-transparent plastic cone 8 cm high, with openings of 7 cm diameter in the 7.5 cm diameter base and 17 mm diameter in the 24 mm diameter top. This miniature greenhouse increases air humidity, reduces soil desiccation, and raises air and soil temperatures to levels more favourable to germination and seedling growth than those offered by unprotected conditions. The shelter is designed to break down after a few years of exposure to ultraviolet radiation.

Seed shelters and spring sowing significantly improved stocking compared with bare spot seeding, but sheltering did not significantly improve growth. Stocking of bare seedspots was extremely low, possibly due to smothering of seedlings by abundant broadleaf and herbaceous litter, particularly that from aspen and red raspberry, and exacerbated by strong competition from graminoids and raspberry.

Cone shelters (Cerkon™) usually produced greater survival than unsheltered seeding on scarified seedspots in trials of direct seeding techniques in interior Alaska, and funnel shelters (Cerbel™) usually produced greater survival than unsheltered seeding on non-scarified seedspots. Both shelter types are manufactured by AB Cerbo in Trollhättan, Sweden. Both are made of light-degradable, white, opaque plastic, and are 8 cm high when installed.

White spruce seed was sown in Alaska on a burned site in summer 1984, and protected by white plastic cones on small spots scarified by hand, or by white funnels placed directly into the residual ash and organic material. A group of six ravens (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;) was observed in the area about one week after sowing was completed in mid-June. Damage averaged 68% with cones and 50% with funnels on an upland area, and 26% with funnels on a floodplain area. Damage by ravens was only 0.13% on unburned but otherwise similar areas.

In seeding trials in Manitoba between 1960 and 1966 aimed at converting aspen stands to spruce–aspen mixedwoods, 1961 scarification in the Duck Mountain Provincial Forest remained receptive to natural seeding for many years.

===Shelterwood===
In general terms, the shelterwood system is a series of partial cuts that removes the trees of an existing stand over several years and eventually culminates in a final cut that creates a new even-aged stand. It is an even-aged regeneration method that removes trees in a series of three harvests: 1) Preparatory cut; 2) Establishment cut; and 3) Removal cut. The success of practising a shelterwood system is closely related to: 1. the length of the regeneration period, i.e. the time from the shelterwood cutting to the date when a new generation of trees has been established; 2.the quality of the new tree stand with respect to stand density and growth; and 3.the value increment of the shelter trees. Information on the establishment, survival and growth of seedlings influenced by the cover of shelter trees, as well as on the growth of these trees, is needed as a basis for modelling the economic return of practising a shelterwood system. The method&#x27;s objective is to establish new forest reproduction under the shelter of the retained trees. Unlike the seed-tree method, residual trees alter understory environmental conditions (i.e. sunlight, temperature, and moisture) that influence tree seedling growth. This method can also find a middle ground with the light ambiance by having less light accessible to competitors while still being able to provide enough light for tree regeneration. Hence, shelterwood methods are most often chosen for site types characterized by extreme conditions, in order to create a new tree generation within a reasonable time period. These conditions are valid foremost on level ground sites which are either dry and poor or moist and fertile.

===Shelterwood systems===
Shelterwood systems involve two, three, or exceptionally more partial cuttings. A final cut is made once adequate natural regeneration has been obtained. The shelterwood system is most commonly applied as a two-cut uniform shelterwood, first an initial regeneration (seed) cut, the second a final harvest cut. In stands less than 100 years old, a light preparatory cut can be useful. A series of intermediate cuts at intervals of 10–20 years has been recommended for intensively managed stands.

From operational or economic standpoints, however, there are disadvantages to the shelterwood system: harvesting costs are higher; trees left for deferred cutting may be damaged during the regeneration cut or related extraction operations; the increased risk of blowdown threatens the seed source; damage from bark beetles is likely to increase; regeneration may be damaged during the final cut and related extraction operations; the difficulty of any site preparation would be increased; and incidental damage to regeneration might be caused by any site preparation operations.

===Single-tree selection===
The single-tree selection method is an uneven-aged regeneration method most suitable when shade tolerant species regeneration is desired. It is typical for older and diseased trees to be removed, thus thinning the stand and allowing for younger, healthy trees to grow. Single-tree selection can be very difficult to implement in dense or sensitive stands and residual stand damage can occur. This method is also disturbs the canopy layer the least out of all other methods.

===Spot seeding===
Spot seeding was found to be the most economical and reliable of the direct seeding methods for converting aspen and paper birch to spruce and pine. In the Chippewa National Forest (Lake States), seed-spot sowing of 10 seeds each of white spruce and white pine under 40-year aspen after different degrees of cutting on gave second-season results clearly indicating the need to remove or disturb the forest floor to obtain germination of seeded white spruce and white pine.

Spot seeding of coniferous seed, including white spruce, has had occasional success, but several constraining factors commonly limit germination success: the drying out of the forest floor before the roots of germinants reach underlying moisture reserves; and, particularly under hardwoods, the smothering of small seedlings by snow-pressed leaf litter and lesser vegetation. Kittredge and Gervorkiantz (1929) determined that removal of the aspen forest floor increased germination percentage after the second season in seed spots of both white pine and white spruce, in four plots, from 2.5% to 5%, from 8% to 22%, from 1% to 9.5%, and from 0% to 15%.

Spot seeding requires less seed than broadcast seeding and tends to achieve more uniform spacing, albeit sometimes with clumping. The devices used in Ontario for manual spot seeding are the &quot;oil can&quot; seeder, seeding sticks, and shakers. The oil can is a container fitted with a long spout through which a predetermined number of seeds are released with each flick of the seeder.

===Strip cutting===
Harvesting cutblocks where only a portion of the trees are to be removed is very different from clearcutting. First, trails must be located to provide access for the felling and skidding/forwarding equipment. These trails must be carefully located to ensure that the trees remaining meet the desired quality criteria and stocking density. Second, the equipment must not damage the residual stand. The further desiderata are outlined by Sauder (1995).

The dearth of seed and a deficiency of receptive seedbeds were recognized as major reasons for the lack of success of clearcut harvesting. One remedy attempted in British Columbia and Alberta has been alternate strip cutting. The greater seed source from uncut trees between the cut strips, and the disturbance to the forest floor within the cut strips could be expected to increase the amount of natural regeneration. Trees were cut to a diameter limit in the cut strips, but large trees in the leave strips often proved too much of a temptation and were cut too, thus removing those trees that would otherwise have been the major source of seed.

An unfortunate consequence of strip thinning was the build-up of spruce beetle populations. Shaded slash from the initial cut, together with an increase in the number of windthrown trees in the leave strips, provided conditions ideally suited to the beetle.

===Underplanting===
DeLong et al. (1991) suggested underplanting 30- to 40-year-old aspen stands, on the basis of the success of natural spruce in regenerating under stands of such stands: &quot;By planting, spacing can be controlled enabling easier protection of the spruce during stand entry for harvesting of the aspen overstorey&quot;.

===Variable retention===
A harvesting and regeneration method which is a relatively new silvicultural system that retains forest structural elements (stumps, logs, snags, trees, understory species and undisturbed layers of forest floor) for at least one rotation in order to preserve environmental values associated with structurally complex forests.

&quot;Uneven-aged and even-aged methods differ in the scale and intensity of disturbance. Uneven-aged methods maintain a mix of tree sizes or ages within a habitat patch by periodically harvesting individual or small groups of trees, Even-aged methods harvest most or all of the overstory and create a fairly uniform habitat patch dominated by trees of the same age&quot;. Even-aged management systems have been the prime methods to use when studying the effects on birds.

==Mortality==

A survey in 1955–56 to determine survival, development, and the reasons for success or failure of conifer pulpwood plantations (mainly of white spruce) in Ontario and Quebec up to 32 years old found that the bulk of the mortality occurred within the first four years of planting, unfavourable site and climate being the main causes of failure.

==Advance growth==

Naturally regenerated trees in an understorey prior to harvesting constitute a classic case of good news and bad news. Understorey white spruce is of particular importance in mixedwoods dominated by aspen, as in the B15, B18a, and B19a Sections of Manitoba, and elsewhere. Until the latter part of the last century, white spruce understorey was mostly viewed as money in the bank on a long-term, low interest deposit, with final yield to be realized after slow natural succession, but the resource became increasingly threatened with the intensification of harvesting of aspen. White spruce plantations on mixedwood sites proved expensive, risky, and generally unsuccessful. This prompted efforts to see what might be done about growing aspen and white spruce on the same landbase by protecting existing white spruce advance growth, leaving a range of viable crop trees during the first cut, then harvesting both hardwoods and spruce in the final cut. Information about the understorey component is critical to spruce management planning. The ability of then current harvesting technology and crews employed to provide adequate protection for white spruce understories was questioned by Brace and Bella. Specialized equipment and training, perhaps with financial incentives, may be needed to develop procedures that would confer the degree of protection needed for the system to be feasible. Effective understorey management planning requires more than improved mixedwood inventory.

Avoidance of damage to the understorey will always be a desideratum. Sauder&#x27;s (1990) paper on mixedwood harvesting describes studies designed to evaluate methods of reducing non-trivial damage to understorey residuals that would compromise their chance of becoming a future crop tree. Sauder concluded that: (1) operational measures that protected residual stems may not unduly increase costs, (2) all felling, conifers and hardwoods, needs to be done in one operation to minimize the entry of the feller-buncher into the residual stand, (3) several operational procedures can reduce understorey damage, some of them without incurring extra costs, and (4) successful harvesting of treatment blocks depends primarily on the intelligent location of skid trails and landings. In summary, the key to protecting the white spruce understorey without sacrificing logging efficiency is a combination of good planning, good supervision, the use of appropriate equipment, and having conscientious, well-trained operators.Even the best plan will not reduce understorey damage unless its implementation is supervised.

New stands need to be established to provide for future supply of commercial white spruce from 150,000 ha of boreal mixedwoods in four of Rowe&#x27;s (1972) regional Forest Sections straddling Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, roughly from Peace River AB to Brandon MB. In the 1980s, with harvesting using conventional equipment and procedures, a dramatic increase in the demand for aspen posed a serious problem for the associated spruce understorey. Formerly, white spruce in the understories had developed to commercial size through natural succession under the protection of the hardwoods. Brace articulated a widespread concern: &quot;The need for protection of spruce as a component of boreal mixedwoods goes beyond concern for the future commercial softwood timber supply. Concerns also include fisheries and wildlife habitat, aesthetics and recreation, a general dissatisfaction with clearcutting in mixedwoods and a strong interest in mixedwood perpetuation, as expressed recently in 41 public meetings on forestry development in northern Alberta...&quot;.

On the basis of tests of three logging systems in Alberta, Brace (1990) affirmed that significant amounts of understorey can be retained using any of those systems provided that sufficient effort is directed towards protection. Potential benefits would include increased short-term softwood timber supply, improved wildlife habitat and cutblock aesthetics, as well as reduced public criticism of previous logging practices. Stewart et al. (2001) developed statistical models to predict the natural establishment and height growth of understorey white spruce in the boreal mixedwood forest in Alberta using data from 148 permanent sample plots and supplementary information about height growth of white spruce regeneration and the amount and type of available substrate. A discriminant model correctly classified 73% of the sites as to presence or absence of a white spruce understorey, based on the amount of spruce basal area, rotten wood, ecological nutrient regime, soil clay fraction, and elevation, although it explained only 30% of the variation in the data. On sites with a white spruce understorey, a regression model related the abundance of regeneration to rotten wood cover, spruce basal area, pine basal area, soil clay fraction, and grass cover (R² = 0.36). About half the seedlings surveyed grew on rotten wood, and only 3% on mineral soil, and seedlings were ten times more likely to have established on these substrates than on litter. Exposed mineral soil covered only 0.3% of the observed transect area.

===Advance growth management===

&quot;Advance growth management&quot;, i.e., the use of suppressed understorey trees, can reduce reforestation costs, shorten rotations, avoid denuding the site of trees, and also reduce adverse impacts on aesthetic, wildlife, and watershed values. To be of value, advance growth must have acceptable species composition and distribution, have potential for growth following release, and not be vulnerable to excessive damage from logging.

The age of advance growth is difficult to estimate from its size, as white that appears to be two- to three-year-old may well be more than twenty years old. However, age does not seem to determine the ability of advance growth of spruce to respond to release, and trees older than 100 years have shown rapid rates of growth after release. Nor is there a clear relationship between the size of advance growth and its growth rate when released.

Where advance growth consists of both spruce and fir, the latter is apt to respond to release more quickly than the former, whereas spruce does respond. If the ratio of fir to spruce is large, however, the greater responsiveness to release of fir may subject the spruce to competition severe enough to negate much of the effect of release treatment. Even temporary relief from shrub competition has increased height growth rates of white spruce in northwestern New Brunswick, enabling the spruce to overtop the shrubs.

==Site preparation==

Site preparation is any of various treatments applied to a site in order to ready it for seeding or planting. The purpose is to facilitate the regeneration of that site by the chosen method. Site preparation may be designed to achieve, singly or in any combination: improved access, by reducing or rearranging slash, and amelioration of adverse forest floor, soil, vegetation, or other biotic factors. Site preparation is undertaken to ameliorate one or more constraints that would otherwise be likely to thwart the objectives of management. A valuable bibliography on the effects of soil temperature and site preparation on subalpine and boreal tree species has been prepared by McKinnon et al. (2002).

Site preparation is the work that is done before a forest area is regenerated. Some types of site preparation are burning.

===Burning===

Broadcast burning is commonly used to prepare clearcut sites for planting, e.g., in central British Columbia, and in the temperate region of North America generally.

Prescribed burning is carried out primarily for slash hazard reduction and to improve site conditions for regeneration; all or some of the following benefits may accrue:

:a) Reduction of logging slash, plant competition, and humus prior to direct seeding, planting, scarifying or in anticipation of natural seeding in partially cut stands or in connection with seed-tree systems.
:b) Reduction or elimination of unwanted forest cover prior to planting or seeding, or prior to preliminary scarification thereto.
:c) Reduction of humus on cold, moist sites to favour regeneration.
:d) Reduction or elimination of slash, grass, or brush fuels from strategic areas around forested land to reduce the chances of damage by wildfire.

Prescribed burning for preparing sites for direct seeding was tried on a few occasions in Ontario, but none of the burns was hot enough to produce a seedbed that was adequate without supplementary mechanical site preparation.

Changes in soil chemical properties associated with burning include significantly increased pH, which Macadam (1987) in the Sub-boreal Spruce Zone of central British Columbia found persisting more than a year after the burn. Average fuel consumption was 20 to 24 t/ha and the forest floor depth was reduced by 28% to 36%. The increases correlated well with the amounts of slash (both total and ≥7 cm diameter) consumed. The change in pH depends on the severity of the burn and the amount consumed; the increase can be as much as two units, a hundred-fold change. Deficiencies of copper and iron in the foliage of white spruce on burned clearcuts in central British Columbia might be attributable to elevated pH levels.

Even a broadcast slash fire in a clearcut does not give a uniform burn over the whole area. Tarrant (1954), for instance, found only 4% of a 140-ha slash burn had burned severely, 47% had burned lightly, and 49% was unburned. Burning after windrowing obviously accentuates the subsequent heterogeneity.

Marked increases in exchangeable calcium also correlated with the amount of slash at least 7 cm in diameter consumed. Phosphorus availability also increased, both in the forest floor and in the 0 cm to 15 cm mineral soil layer, and the increase was still evident, albeit somewhat diminished, 21 months after burning. However, in another study in the same Sub-boreal Spruce Zone found that although it increased immediately after the burn, phosphorus availability had dropped to below pre-burn levels within nine months.

Nitrogen will be lost from the site by burning, though concentrations in remaining forest floor were found by Macadam (1987) to have increased in two of six plots, the others showing decreases. Nutrient losses may be outweighed, at least in the short term, by improved soil microclimate through the reduced thickness of forest floor where low soil temperatures are a limiting factor.

The &quot;Picea/Abies&quot; forests of the Alberta foothills are often characterized by deep accumulations of organic matter on the soil surface and cold soil temperatures, both of which make reforestation difficult and result in a general deterioration in site productivity; Endean and Johnstone (1974) describe experiments to test prescribed burning as a means of seedbed preparation and site amelioration on representative clear-felled &quot;Picea/Abies&quot; areas. Results showed that, in general, prescribed burning did not reduce organic layers satisfactorily, nor did it increase soil temperature, on the sites tested. Increases in seedling establishment, survival, and growth on the burned sites were probably the result of slight reductions in the depth of the organic layer, minor increases in soil temperature, and marked improvements in the efficiency of the planting crews. Results also suggested that the process of site deterioration has not been reversed by the burning treatments applied.

===Ameliorative intervention===

Slash weight (the oven-dry weight of the entire crown and that portion of the stem &lt; 4 inches in diameter) and size distribution are major factors influencing the forest fire hazard on harvested sites. Forest managers interested in the application of prescribed burning for hazard reduction and silviculture, were shown a method for quantifying the slash load by Kiil (1968). In west-central Alberta, he felled, measured, and weighed 60 white spruce, graphed (a) slash weight per merchantable unit volume against diameter at breast height (dbh), and (b) weight of fine slash (&lt;1.27 cm) also against dbh, and produced a table of slash weight and size distribution on one acre of a hypothetical stand of white spruce. When the diameter distribution of a stand is unknown, an estimate of slash weight and size distribution can be obtained from average stand diameter, number of trees per unit area, and merchantable cubic foot volume. The sample trees in Kiil&#x27;s study had full symmetrical crowns. Densely growing trees with short and often irregular crowns would probably be overestimated; open-grown trees with long crowns would probably be underestimated.

The need to provide shade for young outplants of Engelmann spruce in the high Rocky Mountains is emphasized by the U.S. Forest Service. Acceptable planting spots are defined as microsites on the north and east sides of down logs, stumps, or slash, and lying in the shadow cast by such material. Where the objectives of management specify more uniform spacing, or higher densities, than obtainable from an existing distribution of shade-providing material, redistribution or importing of such material has been undertaken.

===Access===

Site preparation on some sites might be done simply to facilitate access by planters, or to improve access and increase the number or distribution of microsites suitable for planting or seeding.

Wang et al. (2000) determined field performance of white and black spruces eight and nine years after outplanting on boreal mixedwood sites following site preparation (Donaren disc trenching versus no trenching) in two plantation types (open versus sheltered) in southeastern Manitoba. Donaren trenching slightly reduced the mortality of black spruce but significantly increased the mortality of white spruce. Significant difference in height was found between open and sheltered plantations for black spruce but not for white spruce, and root collar diameter in sheltered plantations was significantly larger than in open plantations for black spruce but not for white spruce. Black spruce open plantation had significantly smaller volume (97 cm3) compared with black spruce sheltered (210 cm3), as well as white spruce open (175 cm3) and sheltered (229 cm3) plantations. White spruce open plantations also had smaller volume than white spruce sheltered plantations. For transplant stock, strip plantations had a significantly higher volume (329 cm3) than open plantations (204 cm3). Wang et al. (2000) recommended that sheltered plantation site preparation should be used.

===Mechanical===

Up to 1970, no &quot;sophisticated&quot; site preparation equipment had become operational in Ontario, but the need for more efficacious and versatile equipment was increasingly recognized. By this time, improvements were being made to equipment originally developed by field staff, and field testing of equipment from other sources was increasing.

According to J. Hall (1970), in Ontario at least, the most widely used site preparation technique was post-harvest mechanical scarification by equipment front-mounted on a bulldozer (blade, rake, V-plow, or teeth), or dragged behind a tractor (Imsett or S.F.I. scarifier, or rolling chopper). Drag type units designed and constructed by Ontario&#x27;s Department of Lands and Forests used anchor chain or tractor pads separately or in combination, or were finned steel drums or barrels of various sizes and used in sets alone or combined with tractor pad or anchor chain units.

J. Hall&#x27;s (1970) report on the state of site preparation in Ontario noted that blades and rakes were found to be well suited to post-cut scarification in tolerant hardwood stands for natural regeneration of yellow birch. Plows were most effective for treating dense brush prior to planting, often in conjunction with a planting machine. Scarifying teeth, e.g., Young&#x27;s teeth, were sometimes used to prepare sites for planting, but their most effective use was found to be preparing sites for seeding, particularly in backlog areas carrying light brush and dense herbaceous growth. Rolling choppers found application in treating heavy brush but could be used only on stone-free soils. Finned drums were commonly used on jack pine–spruce cutovers on fresh brushy sites with a deep duff layer and heavy slash, and they needed to be teamed with a tractor pad unit to secure good distribution of the slash. The S.F.I. scarifier, after strengthening, had been &quot;quite successful&quot; for two years, promising trials were under way with the cone scarifier and barrel ring scarifier, and development had begun on a new flail scarifier for use on sites with shallow, rocky soils. Recognition of the need to become more effective and efficient in site preparation led the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests to adopt the policy of seeking and obtaining for field testing new equipment from Scandinavia and elsewhere that seemed to hold promise for Ontario conditions, primarily in the north. Thus, testing was begun of the Brackekultivator from Sweden and the Vako-Visko rotary furrower from Finland.

According to J. Charton and A. Peterson, motormanual scarification is best suited for small restoration projects (less than 25,000 trees) or in ecologically sensitive areas such as riparian zones or areas that are prone to erosion.

According to J. Charton, scarification intensity can effect first year seedling mortality and growth. Scarification should be properly applied to various site conditions to ensure that it works in a positive manner for planted seedlings. Since both fireweed and bluejoint grass were shown as soil moisture moderators, reduced scarification intensity may be beneficial to planted seedlings in the wetter areas found on the Kenai Peninsula. However, other factors such as encouraging natural regeneration to promote pre-beetle species compositions should be considered. Reforestation managers should balance response to scarification in wet areas to achieve the proper balance between planted seedling survival and growth and achieving the desired level of natural regeneration.

===Mounding===

Site preparation treatments that create raised planting spots have commonly improved outplant performance on sites subject to low soil temperature and excess soil moisture. Mounding can certainly have a big influence on soil temperature. Draper et al. (1985), for instance, documented this as well as the effect it had on root growth of outplants (Table 30).

The mounds warmed up quickest, and at soil depths of 0.5 cm and 10 cm averaged 10 and 7 °C higher, respectively, than in the control. On sunny days, daytime surface temperature maxima on the mound and organic mat reached 25 °C to 60 °C, depending on soil wetness and shading. Mounds reached mean soil temperatures of 10 °C at 10 cm depth five days after planting, but the control did not reach that temperature until fifty-eight days after planting. During the first growing season, mounds had three times as many days with a mean soil temperature greater than 10 °C than did the control microsites.

Draper et al.&#x27;s (1985) mounds received five times the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) summed over all sampled microsites throughout the first growing season; the control treatment consistently received about 14% of daily background PAR, while mounds received over 70%. By November, fall frosts had reduced shading, eliminating the differential. Quite apart from its effect on temperature, incident radiation is also important photosynthetically. The average control microsite was exposed to levels of light above the compensation point for only three hours, i.e., one-quarter of the daily light period, whereas mounds received light above the compensation point for eleven hours, i.e., 86% of the same daily period. Assuming that incident light in the 100-600 μE/m2/s intensity range is the most important for photosynthesis, the mounds received over four times the total daily light energy that reached the control microsites.

===Orientation of linear site preparation, e.g., disk-trenching===

With linear site preparation, orientation is sometimes dictated by topography or other considerations, but where the orientation can be chosen, it can make a significant difference. A disk-trenching experiment in the Sub-boreal Spruce Zone in interior British Columbia investigated the effect on growth of young outplants (lodgepole pine) in 13 microsite planting positions: berm, hinge, and trench; in north, south, east, and west aspects, as well as in untreated locations between the furrows. Tenth-year stem volumes of trees on south, east, and west-facing microsites were significantly greater than those of trees on north-facing and untreated microsites. However, planting spot selection was seen to be more important overall than trench orientation.

In a Minnesota study, the N–S strips accumulated more snow, but the snow melted faster than on E–W strips in the first year after felling. Snow-melt was faster on strips near the centre of the strip-felled area than on border strips adjoining the intact stand. The strips, 50 feet (15.24 m) wide, alternating with uncut strips 16 feet (4.88 m) wide, were felled in a &quot;Pinus resinosa&quot; stand, aged 90 to 100 years.

<text>A bridge is a fixed dental restoration (a fixed dental prosthesis) used to replace one or more missing teeth by joining an artificial tooth definitively to adjacent teeth or dental implants.

==Definitions==
Fixed bridge: A dental prosthesis that is definitively attached to natural teeth and replaces missing teeth.

Abutment: The tooth that supports and retains a dental prosthesis.

Pontic: The artificial tooth that replaces a missing natural tooth.

Retainer: The component attached to the abutment for retention of the prosthesis. Retainers can be major or minor.

Unit: Pontics and abutment teeth are referred to as units. The total number of units in a bridge is equal to the number of pontics plus the number of abutment teeth.

Saddle: The area on the alveolar ridge which is edentulous where at least one missing tooth is to be reinstated.

Connector: Joins the pontic to the retainer or two retainers together. Connectors may be fixed or movable.

Span: The length of the alveolar ridge between the natural teeth where the bridge will be placed.

Resin-bonded bridge: A dental prostheses where the pontic is connected to the surface of natural teeth which are either unprepared or minimally prepared.

== Advantages and disadvantages of tooth replacement ==

==Types of bridge==
===Conventional bridge===

Conventional bridges are bridges that are supported by full-coverage crowns, three-quarter crowns, post-retained crowns, onlays and inlays on the abutment teeth. In these types of bridges, the abutment teeth require preparation and reduction to support the prosthesis. Conventional bridges are named depending on the way the pontic (false teeth) is attached to the retainer.

====Fixed–fixed bridges====
A fixed–fixed bridge refers to a pontic which is attached to a retainer at both sides of the space with only one path of insertion. This type of design has a rigid connector at each end which connects the abutment to the pontic. As the abutments are connected together rigidly, it is critical that during tooth preparation the proximal surfaces of the abutment teeth must be prepared so that they are parallel to each other.

====Cantilever====
A cantilever is a bridge where a pontic is attached to a retainer only at one side. The abutment tooth may be mesial or distal to the pontic.

In a spring cantilever, the pontic and retainer are remote from each other and connected by a metal bar. Usually, a missing anterior tooth is replaced and supported by a posterior tooth. This design of bridge has been superseded.

====Fixed–movable====
The pontic is firmly attached to a retainer at one end of the span (major retainer) and attached via a movable joint at the other end (minor retainer).

A major advantage of this type of bridge is that the movable joint can accommodate the angulation differences in the abutment teeth in long axis, which enables the path of insertion to be irrespective of the alignment of the abutment tooth. This enables a more conservative approach as the abutments do not need to be prepared to be parallel to one another. Ideally the rigid connector should attach the pontic to the more distal abutment. The movable connector attaches the pontic to the mesial abutment, enabling this abutment tooth limited movement in a vertical direction.

===Resin-bonded bridge===
An alternative to the traditional bridge is the resin-bonded or adhesive bridge (also called a Maryland bridge). A resin-bonded bridge utilises retainer &quot;wings&quot; on the sides of the pontic which attach it to the etched enamel of the abutment teeth. Abutment teeth require minor or no preparation. They are most often used when the abutment teeth are whole and sound (i.e., no crowns or major fillings). Single retainer cantilever resin-bonded bridges have less complications than end-to-end resin-bonded bridges with retainer wings on both sides.

=== Combination designs ===
The incorporation of elements of different conventional bridge designs. A popular combination design is the use of a fixed-fixed design with a cantilever.

=== Hybrid designs ===
Bridges that incorporate elements of both conventional and adhesive bridge designs.

==Case selection and treatment planning==
===Case selection===
Appropriate case selection is important when considering the provision of fixed bridgework. Patient expectations should be discussed and a thorough patient history should be obtained. Replacement of missing teeth with fixed bridgework may not always be indicated and both patient factors alongside restorative factors should be considered before deciding if providing fixed bridgework is appropriate. The survival rate of bridgework can be affected by the span of bridge needed, the proposed position of the bridge, and the size, shape, number and condition of planned abutment teeth. Furthermore, any active disease including caries or periodontal disease should be treated and followed by a period of maintenance to ensure patient compliance in maintaining appropriate oral hygiene.

Study models mounted on a semi-adjustable articulator using a facebow record are a useful aid to study occlusion prior to provision of a fixed prosthesis. They may also be used to practice planned tooth preparation. Subsequently, a diagnostic wax-up can be provided to help the patient visualise the final prosthesis and to construct a silicone index. This index can be used to make a temporary prosthesis.

===Selection and evaluation of abutment teeth===
Multiple factors influence the selection of appropriate abutment teeth. These include the size of potential abutment tooth, with larger teeth having an increased surface area preferable for retention, using teeth with a stable periodontal status, favourable tooth angulation, favourable tooth position, and an adequate crown–root ratio.

Careful abutment selection is critical for the success of bridgework. The prosthesis must be capable of tolerating occlusal forces, which would normally be received by the missing tooth as well as its normal occlusal loading. These forces are transmitted to the abutment(s) via the prosthesis.

Vital teeth are preferred to endodontically treated ones for bridge abutments. Endodontically treated teeth have lost a large amount of tooth structure, weakening them and making them less able to tolerate additional occlusal loading. Post crowns have been shown in some studies to have a higher failure rate.

For resin bonded bridges abutment teeth should ideally be unrestored and have enough enamel to support the metal wing retainer. Additionally there must be sufficient space to accommodate the minimum connector width of 0.7mm and 2mm connector height. It is acceptable for the abutment to be minimally restored with small composite restorations provided they are sound. It is advised to replace old composite restorations prior to cementation to provide optimum bond strength via the oxide layer.

Teeth with active disease such as caries or periodontal disease should not be used as abutments until the disease has been stabilised. Once stable periodontally compromised teeth may be used as abutments, depending on the crown to root ratio described below.

Ante&#x27;s law states that the roots of abutment teeth must have a combined periodontal surface area in three dimensions that is more than that of the missing root structures of the teeth replaced with a bridge, is used in bridgework design. This law remains controversial in terms of supporting clinical evidence.

Crown to root ratio is the distance from the occlusal/incisal surface of the tooth to the alveolar crest in relation to the length of root within the bone. The minimum ratio of crown to root is considered to be 1:1, although the most favourable is a crown:root of 2:3. As the proportion of tooth supported by bone decreases, the lever effect increases.

Root configuration should be considered when selecting abutment(s). Divergent roots of posteriors provide increased support compared to converging, fused or conical roots. Roots that curve apically provide increased support compared to those which have a fixed taper.

The number of abutments required depends on both the position of the tooth to be replaced and the length of the span. Cantilever designs utilising one abutment is the design of choice for replacing a single tooth anteriorly and can also be used posteriorly.

Occlusion of the pontic with the opposing tooth should be assessed. This may determine which type of design is most appropriate and therefore how many abutments are required. For resin bonded bridges the pontic should have light contact in intercuspal position (ICP) and no contact in lateral excursions.

=== Biomechanical considerations ===
Torquing forces can occur when the pontic lies outside the interabutment axis line as the pontic acts as a lever arm. This is particularly applicable to long span bridges replacing multiple anteriors.

Deflection varies directly with the cube of the length, and inversely with the cube of the occlusogingival thickness of the pontic. The longer the span, the more deflection occurs. The amount of deflection is 8 times greater when the length of the span increases to 2 pontics, and increases to 27 times greater with 3 pontics in comparison to a single pontic. It is likely that increased span length will result in the abutments being subjected to increased torquing forces. The thinner the pontic, the more deflection occurs. If the thickness of the pontic is reduced by 50% this causes an 8 times increase in deflection. Choosing pontics with increased occlusogingival dimension and using high yield strength alloys to construct the prosthesis will help reduce deflection.

===Indications for use===
# Replacement of a single tooth or a small spanning space.
# Good oral health status and motivation of patient to maintain oral health.
# Periodontal status of remaining dentition at a stable and satisfactory level.
# Abutment teeth of good quality with minimal restorations and enough surface area and enamel present for adhesion.
# Splinting of periodontally compromised teeth to improve occlusal stability, comfort and decrease mobility. (Periodontally compromised teeth is also a contraindication).
# As a way of fixed retention after orthodontic treatment or extraction.
# Patient unsuitable for implants. This may be due to inadequate bone levels, expense or patient not wanting to receive implants.

===Contraindications===
# Size of saddle area too long.
# Patients with parafunction e.g. bruxism.
# Tooth mobility increases risk of de-bonding.
# Malaligned teeth resulting in poor aesthetics and common path of insertion.
# Abutment tooth quality inadequate for example may have a reduced surface area, reduced enamel or be heavily restored.
# Increased risk of caries due to increased difficulty in maintaining oral hygiene around the bridgework.
# Increased risk of loss of vitality.
# Allergy to base metal alloys e.g. nickel
#Poor patient motivation. Active dental disease (caries, periodontal disease) and poor oral hygiene.

==Types of artificial plastic teeth==
Types of artificial plastic teeth (known in the industry as Pontics)

# Wash-through Pontic (also known as hygienic pontic or sanitary pontic)
# Dome Pontic (also known as bullet- or torpedo-shaped)
# Ridge Lap Pontic (also known as Full Saddle Pontic)
# Modified Ridge-Lap Pontic
# Ovate Pontic
# Conical Pontic

A pontic aims to restore aesthetics, give occlusal stability and improve function.

The hygienic pontic does not contact the underlying alveolar ridge, making it the most straightforward to keep clean. Due to the poor aesthetics of this design it is most commonly employed to replace mandibular molars.

The bullet pontic is the second most favourable in terms of being able to maintain good oral hygiene, with the pontic only contacting one point of the alveolar ridge.

Ridge lap and modified ridge lap pontics have superior aesthetics to the designs discussed previously, with the labial/buccal surface aiming to restore the appearance of a natural tooth from the incisal edge to the gingival margin. To minimise coverage of the soft tissues the lingual/palatal portion of the pontic is reduced to improve accessibility for maintaining good oral hygiene. For the modified ridge lap design the pontic only contacts the buccal aspect of the alveolar ridge.

The ovate pontic comes into contact with the underlying soft tissue and hides the defects of the edentulous ridge with applying light pressure. It is commonly used in provisional bridges following extraction of teeth to improve the emergence profile and helps in shaping the gingiva around the future fixed prosthesis.

==Types of bridges according to durability==
Bridges can either be provisional (temporary/interim) or permanent. The provisional bridge is a transitional restoration that protects the teeth that are weakened by the preparation, and stabilises the dental tissues until the fabrication of the final restoration, moreover, it can pave the way to the aesthetics of the future permanent restoration and its appearance, which can help the patient accept the final profile. Provisional restorations are designed to be used for a few weeks to months, they can be fabricated directly (by chair side), or indirectly ( in the dental laboratory). It is usually tried in a few times to check if it fits properly and if its margins are well adapting on the teeth surface and gingiva, it may need relining or a few adjustments. Provisional bridges can either be made of acrylic resins or metal. The resins are the most commonly used, they are either made of cellulose acetate, polycarbonate or poly-methyl methacrylate. Other chemically activated resins include poly-R methacrylates: these are methacrylates with ethyl or isobutyl substances added to increase the strength of material. Also, commonly used resins include the BisGMA based dimethacrylate, and the visible light urethane di-methylacrylate. Dimethacrylate-based materials were found to be better than monomethacrylates for temporary restorations in terms of flexural strength and hardness.

==Types of bridges according to material==
# Metal based, noble based metals such as gold, or base metal alloys such as nickel chromium.
# Non-metal based. They can be either resin veneered, fibre-reinforced composite, porcelain fused to metal, or ceramics which are either silica, alumina, or zirconia.

===Acrylic resin and porcelain fused to metal (PFM)===

Acrylic resin was the first veneering material used to help restore the aesthetics of crown and bridges. The aim was to maintain a similar colour to natural teeth by attaching it on the labial surface of metal crown / bridges; however, resin-veneered dental prosthetics lacked stability and abrasion resistance. Porcelain fused to metal (PFM) was then introduced; the porcelain is composed of two layers (one opaque to cover the metal substructure and another translucent to provide an enamel illusion). Still several researchers consider PFM the gold standard as it has been reported to have 95% success over a 10-year period, a reason why newer types of all-ceramic restorations are usually compared to PFM crowns/bridges to assess its success and durability. However, PFM restorations may show a grey colour at the cervical margins of the tooth showing the metal substructure.

===IPs Emax===
IPs Emax ceramics offer high aesthetic properties, which is why its use has been increasingly popular. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine the longevity of Emax in bridges; some reports have found fair short-term survival, but unfavorable medium-term survival. Failures of restorations were most reported in the posterior teeth region. IPs Emax is available as press ingots or as IPs Emax CAD/CAM system. Emax use in crowns or bridges is not recommended for patients who suffer from bruxism.

===Zirconia===
Zirconia is used in anterior, and posterior fixed bridges, and also on implants. Zirconia is fabricated using the dental CAD/CAM technology. It has high mechanical strength and it can withstand high occlusal forces compared to all-ceramic materials. in addition it can resist crack propagation in the core material; however, cracks often occur in the veneering material leading to its fracture whether in the tooth-supported or implant-supported bridges. Reports found that the 3×3 mm designed connectors in zirconia bridges increased the strength to resist fracture by 20%.

Although the use of ceramic based fixed prosthesis have been popular as it achieves a lifelike, highly esthetic appearance, a Cochrane Review found insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of ceramic materials for fixed prosthodontic treatment over metal-ceramic.

==Clinical stages of bridgework==
#Assessment: Clinical assessment of the patient&#x27;s suitability for bridgework. Detailed history (including medical history), appropriate assessment of the suitability of the patient&#x27;s oral environment (including occlusion, caries risk, periodontal risk, radiographic examination, sensibility testing), assessment of patient aims and motivation, abutment tooth selection and bridge design.
#Primary impressions: Primary impressions can be taken with alginate to make study casts. A facebow record should also be taken to enable the occlusion to be studied prior to provision of the prosthesis
#Diagnostic wax-up: This enables the patient to visualise how the definitive prosthesis will look. The wax up can also be used to construct a putty matrix which can be used subsequently to make a temporary restoration.
#Restoration replacement: Restorations in abutment teeth with questionable prognosis or old composite resin restorations for adhesive bridgework should be replaced.
#Tooth preparation: This should be completed with reference to radiographs and study casts obtained during treatment planning. For conventional bridges, tooth preparation should aim to conserve tooth tissue, ensure a parallel path of insertion, achieve clearance in the occlusion and ensure well defined preparation margins. The taper of each preparation on the abutment teeth must be the same. This is known as &quot;parallelism&quot; among the abutments and allows the bridge to fit onto the abutment teeth. Adhesive bridges require minimal preparation.
# Master impressions: An accurate impression should be made of the prepared teeth, along with an impression of the opposing arch. The master casts are used to provide accurate information about the occlusion to the laboratory and construct the prosthesis.
# Occlusal registration: An occlusal registration is needed when providing extensive bridgework to allow the opposing casts to be related accurately. This may not be necessary if only a small number of teeth are to be restored.
# Temporary restoration: Temporary restorations should be fabricated if possible to protect and maintain the prepared teeth until placement of the final restoration.
# Try in: Confirm the clinical acceptability before cementing definitively. Assess the prosthesis on the master casts and identify the cause of any problems if present. A period of temporary cementation to assess clinical acceptability prior to definitive placement is sometimes used.
# Final placement: Once satisfied the prosthesis is clinically acceptable, cement and bond the bridgework definitively.
# Review: Assess the bridgework and manage any post-operative issues.

==Restoration fabrication==

As with single-unit crowns, bridges may be fabricated using the lost-wax technique if the restoration is to be either a multiple-unit FGC or PFM. Another fabrication technique is to use CAD/CAM software to machine the bridge. As mentioned above, there are special considerations when preparing for a multiple-unit restoration in that the relationship between the two or more abutments must be maintained in the restoration. That is, there must be proper parallelism for the bridge to seat properly on the margins.

Sometimes, the bridge does not seat, but the dentist is unsure whether it is because the spatial relationship between the abutments is incorrect, or whether the abutments do not actually fit the preparations. The only way to determine this is to section the bridge and try in each abutment by itself. If they each fit individually, the spatial relationship was incorrect, and the abutment that was sectioned from the pontic must now be reattached to the pontic according to the newly confirmed spatial relationship. This is accomplished with a solder index.

The proximal surfaces of the sectioned units (that is, the adjacent surfaces of the metal at the cut) are roughened and the relationship is preserved with a material that will hold on to both sides, such as PATTERN RESIN from the company GC America. With the two bridge abutments individually seated on their prepared abutment teeth, the resin is applied to the location of the sectioning to reestablish a proper spatial relationship between the two pieces. This can then be sent to the lab where the two pieces will be soldered and returned for another try-in or final cementation.

==Advantages of bridges==
Dental bridges offer several advantages.

They can usually be completed in only two dental appointments, restore the tooth back to full chewing function, require no periodic removal for cleaning, have a long life-expectancy and are aesthetically pleasing.

==Bridge failures==
===Common reasons for bridge failures===

# Poor oral hygiene: As with any fixed prosthesis including bridges, maintaining good oral hygiene to prevent plaque formation around the bridge is key. This will ensure prolonged performance. A study examined the gingival health around the fixed bridges after 14 days – 6 months post insertion found the surfaces were more plaque retentive, causing gingival inflammation regardless the material of fabrication of the bridge, unlike single crowns which did not show the same effect.
# Mechanical failures: These failures can occur due to loss of retention of the bridge due to improper cementation, construction or preparation.
Fracture of the metal coating or pontic can also lead to mechanical failures. Fracture in connectors of bridges at the gingival side is a common finding in most all-ceram bridges.
# Biological failures: These can occur due to caries in the tooth (one of the commonest causes of crown and bridge failures) or due to pulpal injury. Problems with abutment teeth such as tooth fracture, secondary caries or periodontal disease can cause discomfort and put pressure on surrounding soft tissues to also cause a biological failure of the bridge.
# Aesthetic failures: These can occur at the time of cementation and include; colour mismatch, roughness of margins or improper tooth contour. 
Aesthetics failures can also occur over a period of time including through wear of teeth, gingival recession or drifting of teeth.
# Problems with abutment teeth: Abutment teeth affected by secondary caries, vitality loss or periodontal disease can all lead to bridge failure.

===Oral manifestations of bridge failures===
Bridge failures result in clinical complications and patients can present with:
# Pain in the oral cavity
# Sensitivity, bleeding and inflammation of the gums 
# Foul breath and taste disturbances

===Bridge failure management===
Management of bridge failures depends upon the extent and type of failure and these can be prevented through forming a thorough treatment plan with the patient as well regularly emphasising the importance of maintaining a very good level of oral hygiene after the bridge has been placed. The importance of cleaning underneath the pontic, through the use of interdental cleaning aids, should also be reinforced as plaque control around fixed restorations is more difficult.

Management options include:
# Keeping the bridge under observation/review
# Repairing, replacing or removing the fault

<text>William Donald Nix (September 27, 1941 – December 31, 2024) was an American musician, songwriter, and producer. Nix, who was best known for his song &quot;Going Down,&quot; was described by AllMusic as &quot;one of the more obscure figures in Southern soul and rock.&quot;

==Biography==
William Donald Nix was born into a musical family in Memphis, Tennessee, on September 27, 1941. His brother Larry became a mastering engineer for Stax Records and for the Ardent Studios in Memphis. Nix began his career playing saxophone for the Memphis-based Mar-Keys, alongside Steve Cropper and Duck Dunn. The group scored a hit single with &quot;Last Night&quot; in 1961. After leaving the Mar-Keys, Nix worked as a session musician for Stax.

After relocating to Los Angeles in the mid-1960s, Nix worked as a producer and songwriter with such acts as Leon Russell, Gary Lewis and the Playboys, John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, and Freddie King, among others. Nix&#x27;s best known composition, &quot;Going Down,&quot; was originally released by the band Moloch on their eponymous album in 1969, and has become a blues-rock standard, having been covered by Freddie King, the Jeff Beck Group, the Who, and the Rolling Stones. In 1971, Nix made the acquaintance of George Harrison, leading to Nix organizing the backup vocalists for the Concert for Bangladesh.

As a solo artist, Nix released nine albums between 1971 and 2008, and published three books.

Nix died at his home in Germantown, Tennessee, on December 31, 2024, at the age of 83.

<doc id="1031157" wikidata="Q44686" url="?curid=1031157" title="City Hall (1996 film)">
<text>City Hall is a 1996 American political thriller film directed by Harold Becker and starring Al Pacino, John Cusack, Bridget Fonda and Danny Aiello. The film is Becker&#x27;s second collaboration with Pacino, having directed him in &quot;Sea of Love&quot; (1989).

==Plot==
New York City Mayor John Pappas makes a speech. His admiring deputy mayor Kevin Calhoun watches and narrates the scene. Meanwhile, NYPD Detective Eddie Santos and mob figure Tino Zapatti kill each other in a shootout on a Brooklyn street corner. A stray bullet from Zapatti&#x27;s gun also kills a 6-year-old boy.

Tino was the nephew of mob boss Paul Zapatti, and questions are raised about why he was free on probation. To contain the outrage, Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun investigates. Internal Affairs intends to portray Santos as a dirty cop. Detective&#x27;s Endowment Association lawyer Marybeth Cogan does her best to protect Santos&#x27;s family and becomes Calhoun&#x27;s reluctant ally.

Calhoun&#x27;s investigation leads to Frank Anselmo, a Brooklyn political boss who has connections to the Zapatti family. Anselmo plants money at Zapatti&#x27;s behest to frame Santos. Calhoun and Cogan continue to seek the truth from a number of sources, including Santos&#x27;s partner and another Zapatti relative. After the murder of probation officer Larry Schwartz, they conclude that Judge Walter Stern is receiving illegal income. Mayor Pappas agrees that Stern must resign.

The scandal escalates to Zapatti instructing Anselmo to die by suicide rather than become an informant or go to jail. To protect his family, Anselmo shoots himself. Calhoun discovers that Stern owes his judgeship to a bribe that Anselmo delivered on behalf of the Zapattis to keep Tito out of jail. Pappas engineered the scheme. Shocked and disheartened, Calhoun tells Pappas that he must resign. Although Pappas wants to fight the imminent scandal, he admires Calhoun&#x27;s integrity and acquiesces.

Calhoun soon runs for New York City&#x27;s 6th City Council district, determined to make the city a better place.

==Production==
In January 1994, it was announced that Harold Becker had made a deal with Paramount Pictures to direct &quot;City Hall&quot;, a drama in the vein of &quot;Network&quot; written by Bo Goldman. The following month, it was announced that Castle Rock Entertainment had picked up &quot;City Hall&quot; after Paramount let their option lapse.

Tom Cruise was in preliminary negotiations to star in the film, but negotiations quickly fell apart. 
==Reception==
=== Critical response ===
&quot;City Hall&quot; has a 60% approval rating, based on 25 reviews, at Rotten Tomatoes. The critics&#x27; consensus reads: &quot;&quot;City Hall&quot; explores political corruption with commendable intelligence, but this web of scandal struggles to coalesce into satisfying drama.&quot; At CinemaScore, it holds a &quot;B–&quot; rating on a scale of A+ to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four. He wrote, &quot;Many of the parts of &quot;City Hall&quot; are so good that the whole should add up to more, but it doesn&#x27;t.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; had high praise for Danny Aiello&#x27;s &quot;beauty of a performance&quot;, calling it the &quot;heart of the tale&quot;.

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; graded the film B–. He wrote, &quot;If you&#x27;re going to travel the familiar labyrinth of corruption, it helps to have John Cusack as your guide.&quot;

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; concluded, &quot;What prevents &#x27;City Hall&#x27; from being an outright failure is its intriguing sense of detail.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; called &quot;City Hall&quot; a &quot;Greek tragedy&quot; that &quot;aims to tell the dark truth about a modern metropolis yet doesn&#x27;t stint on fun&quot;.

Many reviewers praised the chemistry of the two leads. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote, &quot;The relationship between Pacino and Cusack is more than seductive enough to hold audience attention.&quot;

&quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; gave the film 2½ stars out of 4. It felt that the film was &quot;Less than the sum of its parts...But give it credit for trying.&quot;

&quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; was grateful that the film &quot;gives us a political drama with engaging moral and ethical dimensions. The movie is a welcome change from the fluff of &#x27;The American President&#x27; and the self-indulgent freak show that was &#x27;Nixon&#x27;.&quot;

===Box office===
The film was released on February 16, 1996, in 1,815 theaters. It debuted at number 4 at the United States box office, grossing $8 million. For its second weekend, it landed at number 6, grossing $13.8 million. The film grossed $20.3 million in the U.S. and Canada, and $13.1 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $33.4 million.

<text>The LAW 80 (Light Anti-armour Weapon 80), regularly referred to as LAW 94 in British service, is a man-portable, disposable anti-tank weapon previously used by the British Army and a few other militaries.

==Description==
The weapon consists of an extendable launch tube with an integrated spotting rifle and 1× sight. The spotting rifle has five rounds of ammunition, and is ballistically matched to the rocket. The rounds it uses are quite unusual, consisting of a 9 mm tracer bullet loaded in a necked up 7.62mm NATO shell casing, with a .22 Hornet blank mounted in the base of the larger case, providing the propellant charge. Upon firing, the .22 cartridge case pushes out of the back of the 7.62 mm casing, unlocking the breech of the spotting rifle in a form of primer actuation. 

To launch the rocket the firer removes the large protective end caps and extends the rear of the launch tube, opens the sight, and moves the arming lever to &quot;armed&quot;. The weapon is then in spotting rifle mode. To fire the rocket, the firer moves a charge lever forward with his firing hand thumb. The rocket motor burns out before it leaves the launch tube, the resulting blast being directed rearwards from the launch tube. The rocket then coasts to the target, arming itself after it has passed a certain arming distance. The warhead is a HEAT shaped charge and could penetrate of rolled homogeneous armour at 90 degrees, as was taught to soldiers trained on the weapon system in the British Army, Royal Navy (Royal Marines) and RAF Regiment. It was also taught that sloped, composite and reactive armour, would reduce the penetration and would be an important factor when selecting the aiming point.

<doc id="1031180" wikidata="Q525762" url="?curid=1031180" title="Perth Observatory">
<text>The Perth Observatory is the name of two astronomical observatories located in Western Australia (WA). In 1896, the original observatory was founded in West Perth on Mount Eliza overlooking the city of Perth (obs. code 319). Due to the city&#x27;s expansion, the observatory moved to Bickley in 1965. The new Perth Observatory is sometimes referred to as Bickley Observatory (obs. code 322, 323).

==History==

===First Perth Observatory===
The original Perth Observatory was constructed in 1896 and was officially opened in 1900 by John Forrest, the first premier of Western Australia. The observatory was located at Mount Eliza overlooking the city of Perth. Its chief roles were keeping Standard Time for Western Australia and meteorological data collection. The observatory dome was demolished in the 1960s to make way for Dumas House, after the Observatory of the city was relocated elsewhere. The house of the chief astronomer of the old observatory remains today, the current tenant is the National Trust.

===WA Government Astronomers===
====William Ernest Cooke====

William Ernest Cooke was appointed the first Western Australian Government Astronomer in 1896 after a similar posting at the Adelaide Observatory. On arrival in Perth, his first task was to determine the exact latitude and longitude of the colony. He was also able to determine the time of day with greater accuracy. Before his arrival clocks could vary by up to half an hour. The time was announced each day by a cannon still present on the grounds. The design was by the government architect, George Temple-Poole, and features a bold combination of styles.

====Harold Burnham Curlewis====
Cooke&#x27;s successor as Government Astronomer was Harold Curlewis who wrote in 1929:
Since the prevailing winds blow over the huge extent of King&#x27;s Park, its excellence for astronomical work is not impaired by its proximity to the city, as is so often the case with other observatories. ...A glance from the tower, from which a wonderful panorama of Perth may be obtained, shows that no growth of the city can ever adversely affect observing conditions

=====Curlewis and the WA border=====
In 1920 and 1921 Curlewis was involved with the Government Astronomer of South Australia, Dodwell, in determinations to fix positions for marking of the West Australian border on the ground with the South Australian border at Deakin, Western Australia. In 1921 the same group from the Deakin determinations travelled by the State Ship, MV &quot;Bambra&quot; to Wyndham, where they were guided by M.P. Durack to a point on Rosewood station near Argyle Downs close to the 129th meridian east longitude (129° east). They used the relatively new technology of the day, wireless radio time signals, and other methods to fix a position for the Northern Territory border with Western Australia.

These early determinations led to the 1968 agreement for the formation of Surveyor Generals Corner.

The WA border is not straight &quot;(see Western Australia border)&quot;; at the 26th parallel south (26° south) there is an approximately &quot;sideways&quot; section of the WA/NT border, which runs east–west.

====Hyman Solomon Spigl====
Curlewis&#x27;s successor as Government Astronomer was Hyman Solomon Spigl between 1940 and 1962. Spigl, who was from a surveying background, progressed rebuilding a post war ravaged Observatory by rejuvenating the time service, seismology services, completing the Astrographic Catalogues, became involved in the International Geophysical Year by installing a Markowitz Moon camera and restarted the publications for the Royal Astronomical Society. Additionally, through a National Science Foundation of America grant, he was in the process of refurbishing the Observatory&#x27;s meridian transit circle to recommence meridian observations. While he never achieved this before his death, and it was never used again, the instrument sits in the foyer of the Perth Observatory now fully refurbished.

In 1958 Spigl was awarded a Gledden Travelling Fellowship by the University of Western Australia; Spigl spent 12 months travelling in the US, UK and Europe. Spigl was actively searching for a new site for the Perth Observatory as a result of the decision for it to be relocated as an outcome of the implementation of the 1955 Stephenson-Hepburn Report. Spigl spent many years lecturing in surveying at the University of Western Australia and was involved in the Astronomical Society of Western Australia.

====John Bertrand Harris====
Upon the death of Spigl on 20 August 1962, John Bertrand Harris, who had been Spigl&#x27;s assistant since 1957, became the fourth Government Astronomer of the Perth Observatory between 1962 until the end of 1974. Harris had to step in to the position of Government Astronomer at a time when the Perth Observatory was on the move to its new site in the Darling Range, Bickley, some east of its original position in the City of Perth. Clearing of the land in the State Forrest in Bickely commenced in February 1964, with excavations commencing in May 1964 and construction works on buildings continuing through 1965; staff moved in on 19 December 1965.

With the new Bickely site complete, in 1967, Harris oversaw the installation of a meridian circle telescope at the Observatory as part of an expedition by astronomers from the Hamburg Observatory in Germany. The expedition worked on the international Southern Reference Stars program that resulted in a revised, larger and more accurate meridian catalogue of the Southern Hemisphere: the Perth 70 meridian catalogue. In 1970 Harris was successful in forming a dedicated Perth Observatory Meridian section to assist the German expedition in their work. After the German expedition left over the 1971/72 Christmas/New Year period, Harris successfully negotiated the loan of the Hamburg telescope indefinitely and obtained funding from the Government of Western Australia to increase the Meridian staff numbers. This Perth Observatory Meridian team continued and expanded on the German expedition work, resulting in the Perth 75 meridian catalogue.

In 1967, Harris worked with the University of Western Australia to install a telescope at the Observatory that was built and used by the University of Western Australia staff and students, as well as Perth Observatory astronomers.

Harris then moved the astrographic telescope, which had been in storage since August 1963, to the new site after arranging its refurbishment; the telescope recommenced observations on 29 March 1968, taking second epoch photographic plates for proper motion studies.

In 1968, the Lowell Observatory of Flagstaff Arizona USA, located a Boller and Chivens telescope at the Perth Observatory as part of the International Planetary Patrol Program. The program was designed to collect 35-mm format photographic data on the atmospheric and surface features of Solar System planets, mostly Mars, Jupiter and Venus; Harris was to be a regular observer outside his normal daytime Government Astronomer role.

Harris was successful in increasing the technical and astronomical staff numbers at the new Bickley Perth Observatory as its role moved to that of more of a scientific function, however Harris also restarted the public tours on 23 October 1966 and maintained the provision of information services to Western Australia. Harris also continued time and tide services for Western Australia, however as had been the case in 1908 for Meteorology, the move saw seismic monitoring activities being relocated to Mundaring under the Commonwealth Government control.

Harris was responsible for the August 1973 IAU Symposium No. 61 in Perth on &quot;New Problems of Astrometry&quot;. Like his predecessor, he died at an early age, 49, but had raised the standing of the Perth Observatory to a well respected scientific institution within Australia and internationally.

====Dr Iwan (Ivan) Nikoloff====
With the death of Harris on 23 December 1974, Nikoloff was to act in the role of Government Astronomer of the Perth Observatory until 30 May 1979 when he officially became the fifth Government Astronomer of the Perth Observatory.

After arriving in Australia in 1964, he commenced at the Perth Observatory as an Astronomer Grade II on 1 May 1964 and worked on the Observatory&#x27;s astrograph; his previous experience also saw him set up and calibrate the recently acquired Zeiss plate measuring machine. With the relocation of the Perth Observatory from Perth to Bickley, Nikoloff&#x27;s surveying skills were extensively used in setting up the new Observatory during 1965.

Nikoloff worked with the German Hamburg Observatory meridian circle telescope expedition on the Perth 70 catalogue, from 1969 until 1971, before the expedition astronomers returned to Germany that Christmas.

In 1971, with funding by the Government of Western Australia and negotiations for the loan of the Hamburg telescope, Nikoloff was placed in charge of the newly formed Perth Observatory Meridian Section. Dr Nikoloff commenced a new observing program of FK4 and FK4 Supplementary stars that would result in the Perth 75 catalogue of 2549 stars. The catalogue not only extended the well revered Perth 70 catalogue, but provided valuable Southern Hemisphere information for the construction of the new FK5 reference frame sought by the international astronomical community.

As Government Astronomer, Nikoloff passed on the Meridian Section to D. Harwood, but kept a keen involvement in the construction of the subsequent Perth 83 meridian catalogue. While daily administrative duties kept him busy, Nikoloff continued observing on all the Observatory&#x27;s telescopes at night and on weekends.

Nikoloff maintained a good relationship with the University of Western Australia, was a Foundation member and Fellow of the Astronomical Society of Australia, a life member of the Astronomical Association of Western Australia and a member of the IAU&#x27;s original Commission 8 (Astrometry) and I (Fundamental Astronomy); he also continued the Observatory&#x27;s public information services and tours. He retired on 4 January 1985 and died on 8 April 2015.

===Perth Observatory Directors===
Upon the retirement of Dr I Nikoloff, the governing body of the Perth Observatory at that time, the Department of Science and Technology (Australia), replaced the primary title of what was previously called the Government Astronomer, with the title of Director Perth Observatory. The reason given was that the title of Government Astronomer &quot;...&quot;seemed antiquated to them&quot;&quot;, it also reflected similar changes throughout the world with astronomical institutions merging with Universities.

====Michael Philip Candy====
With the compulsory retirement age still in place, after Dr I Nikoloff retired, Mr Michael Philip Candy became the first Director of the Perth Observatory.

In 1969 Candy was offered the position of Director of the British Astronomical Association, however declined due to his plans to emigrate to Australia that year.

After arriving in Australia 12 May 1969, he commenced at the Perth Observatory as an &quot;Astronomer Grade II&quot; and in November 1969 took over the running of the Perth Observatory Astrographic telescope from Dr I Nikoloff.

His numerical prowess, gained during his time at HM Nautical Almanac Office, was to be a great asset in the astrometric programs of the Perth Observatory, as was his interest in comets.

It took little time for Candy to position the Perth Observatory at the forefront of southern cometary astrometry. By 1972, the Perth Observatory was 9th in the world in producing cometary positions. Not content with this, Candy introduced new photographic glass plate processing practices to increase the limiting magnitude of objects achievable at that time from 14th to 19th. The new processes were to see the recovery of five comets and the positioning of the Observatory to 2nd place between 1973 and 1977 and 4th between 1978 and 1984, resulting in him being awarded the prestigious Merlin Medal of the British Astronomical Association in 1975. Under his direction the Perth Observatory discovered over 100 new asteroids as well as contributing a significant number of observations to the Minor Planet Center.

He continued the first publication of the Perth Observatory on comet and minor positions, commenced by Mr B Harris, with Communication No. 2, 3, 4 and the last, that of Communication No. 5 in 1986.

By 1979 his astrometric abilities and contributions were widely acknowledged and he became Vice President of International Astronomical Union, Commission 6, a position he held until 1982 when he was elected president for a 3-year term. At the same time became a working member of International Astronomical Union Commission 20 until 1988 – Positions and Motions of Minor Planets, Satellites and Comets.

The Perth Observatory was positioned well for Halley&#x27;s Comet in 1986/1987 and under Candy the Perth Observatory produced 10% of all Earth based astrometric positions for the comet, the largest contribution in the World.

Candy was a councillor of the Astronomical Society of Australia from 1988 to 1990, councillor of the Royal Society of Western Australia between 1988 and 1990, and president of the Royal Society of Western Australia in 1989 .

He saw the most drastic staff cuts to the Observatory by the Government in 1987 with 50% of the staff redeployed and one whole section closed down.

With the compulsory retirement age no longer in place, unlike his predecessor, Candy was able to continue working at the Perth Observatory on projects including the eclipsing binary FO Hydra, a comet hunter telescope, a new theory on comet origins and evolution, the analysis of the lost comet Gale, as well as comparison of a South Australian comet discovered in 1979 with that of a comet from 1770.

In 1960 he discovered Comet Candy 1960n and was the first Astronomer to discover, as well as compute, a comets orbit from two more observations within 60 hours of its discovery.

Mr M P Candy officially retired on 24 December 1993 and died 2 November 1994.

His work was honored by the naming of Minor Planet 3015 Candy in 1980.

====James D Biggs====
Dr James D Biggs commenced at the Perth Observatory in May 1994 and resigned in 2010.

====Ralph Martin (Acting)====
After Dr J D Biggs resigned, Ralph Martin acted in the Directors position until on 22 January 2013 the WA Government announced that all research programs would be cut and the Observatory would only be open for tours.

Martin and the remaining staff of the Perth Observatory took voluntary redundancy.

===Earthquake records===
As an earthquake observatory in Perth a Milne-Shaw seismograph was utilised between 1923 and 1959 for the recording of earthquakes in Western Australia. After 1959 the earthquake monitoring was taken up by the Mundaring Geophysical Observatory.

===New observatory at Bickley===
In the 1960s, light pollution from the city of Perth and a small part of the implementation of the 1955 plan by Stephenson-Hepburn Report saw the land where the Perth Observatory resided make way for what was to initially be five government office blocks, however there was only one ever built, Dumas House. After nearly being closed by the State Government, the Observatory was moved to its current site at Bickley near Mount Gungin in the Darling Range. Construction of the new observatory cost $600,000, and it was opened by the Premier Sir David Brand on 30 September 1966.

===Recent history===
The Observatory has fought off several attempts to close the facility by the State Government, the most serious being in 1987 when it was part of the Department of State Services. An outcry from the public, scientific and amateur communities was helpful in retaining the observatory.

As of July 2015, The Perth Observatory Volunteer Group runs the Observatory under a community partnership agreement between the Department of Parks and Wildlife and the Perth Observatory Volunteer Group which was signed in June 2015.

====Centenary 1996====
In January 1996, the centenary of its foundation, the observatory was transferred to the Department of Conservation and Land Management, now part of the Department of Parks and Wildlife (Western Australia).

====Bickley Observatory heritage listed====
In 2005 the Bickley site was heritage listed, being Australia&#x27;s oldest continuing operating observatory and Australia&#x27;s only remaining State Government operated astronomical observatory.

====Publication====
The &quot;Western Australian astronomy almanac&quot; was published in the 2000s by the DEC as part of the Observatory expertise, utilising staff of the Observatory to edit and contribute. The 2002 publication for the 2003 almanac had an extra subtitle which was not utilised in later editions: &quot;the really useful guide to the wonders of the night sky&quot;.

It had been preceded by &quot;Astronomical Data&quot; (1965–1990) and the &quot;Astronomical Handbook&quot; (1989–1992 ?).

==Perth Observatory today==
The Minor Planet Center credits 29 minor planet discoveries to Perth Observatory for the period between 1970 and 1999.

On 22 January 2013 the Western Australian Government announced that all research programs would be cut and the Observatory would only be open for tours.

As of 1 July 2015, the Perth Observatory Volunteer Group has been running the Observatory for the Western Australian Government, the Perth Observatory continues to operate today under the management of only 3 part-time staff and almost 120 volunteers.

In 2022-23, 14,992 people were reached by Perth Observatory programs, and 771 school students experienced a lesson at the observatory. 179 night sky tours were held, with 5810 people experiencing a night sky tour. There were 1516 daytime walk-in visitors to the observatory. 26 off-site events were conducted throughout the state.

There were 162 registered volunteers who contributed 20,560 hours of volunteer time.

==Honors==
The Florian asteroid 3953 Perth was named in honour of the observatory.

<doc id="1031185" wikidata="Q4378426" url="?curid=1031185" title="My Name Is Modesty">
<text>My Name Is Modesty is a 2004 American action film directed by Scott Spiegel. Quentin Tarantino executive produced. It was released direct-to-DVD. The film is based on the early years of the character Modesty Blaise, a former crime boss turned secret agent. This is the third production that brings Peter O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s character Modesty Blaise to the screen, following the feature film &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; with Monica Vitti in 1966 and the TV pilot &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; with Ann Turkel in 1982.

The film stars British actress Alexandra Staden as Modesty and chronicles a crucial event in the character&#x27;s life sometime before the start of the comic strip. As such, it omits the key character of Willie Garvin, Modesty&#x27;s companion throughout the run of the original comic strip and the 30-year series of spin-off novels and short stories published by O&#x27;Donnell.

==Plot==
Modesty Blaise is working as a croupier in a casino in Tangier. A group of violent criminals assassinate her employer and enter the casino shooting staff and demanding entry to the casino&#x27;s safe. Modesty delays her retaliation and retribution as she protects the lives of her staff. When the criminals kill the only person who can open the safe, Modesty arranges for a fellow employee to arrive who has the password for the computer that holds the details of the entry to the vault. As the criminals and their captives await the individual, Modesty takes on the leader of the criminals at the game of roulette. They agree that if she wins twice in a row a captive sworn to not tell what happened is released; when she loses she has to tell the truth about her background to the leader of the criminals who has become fascinated by her. She relates her life story little by little in the manner of Scheherazade.

Modesty tells her life story in flashback beginning as an orphaned child in a refugee camp in the Balkans, to her meeting her mentor who teaches her his knowledge of various languages and martial arts until he died in Algeria where she makes her way to Tangier and becoming a croupier. The criminals eventually enter the safe but are confronted with a revenging Modesty.

The time setting of the film is kept vague. Although flashback sequences involving warfare invoke World War II or other conflicts in the late 1940s and early 1950s (in keeping with the original comic strip), Modesty as an adult is shown using computers and other current (for 2004) technology.

==Cast==
* Alexandra Staden as Modesty Blaise
* Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Miklos
* Raymond Cruz as Raphael Garcia
* Fred Pearson as Professor Lob
* Eugenia Yuan as Irina
* Valentin Teodosiu as Henri Louche
* Bianca Ana Tudorica as Young Modesty Blaise

==Production==

After director Scott Spiegel filmed &quot;From Dusk till Dawn 2&quot; in 1999, producer Harvey Weinstein asked Spiegel to direct &quot;My Name Is Modesty&quot;. Quentin Tarantino joined the filming as an executive producer. The filming took place in Bucharest, Romania and lasted 18 days. The film was produced &quot;pro forma&quot; for Miramax Films to maintain rights to the source material, the &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; comic strip.

Peter O&#x27;Donnell acted as a consultant to the film with an updated sequence in the story mirroring how O&#x27;Donnell first met the girl who inspired him.

==Release==
&quot;My Name Is Modesty&quot; was released straight to DVD.

==Reception==
Juan Morales of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film one of the &quot;vivid examples of Mr. Spiegel&#x27;s sly, visual directing style&quot;. Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; opined that the film &quot;isn&#x27;t half-bad&quot; and is a &quot;mildly diverting time-killer&quot;. He went on to note, &quot;Scripters Lee and Janet Scott Batchler concoct a scenario that often plays like the pilot for a syndicated tele series. Budgetary and scheduling restraints require vet vidpic director Scott Spiegel... to keep most of the action within the casino set. Still, Spiegel sustains a reasonable level of tension while Modesty stalls for time. Climactic smackdown is suitably brisk, if predictable. Handsome lensing by Vivi Dragan Vasile is a plus.&quot;

<text>The Kwangmyŏngsŏng program was a class of experimental satellites developed by North Korea. The name Kwangmyŏngsŏng (&quot;bright star&quot;, &quot;brilliant star&quot; or &quot;constellation&quot; in Korean) is from a poem written by Kim Il Sung. The first class of satellites built by North Korea, the program started in the mid-1980s. There have been five launches so far, of which two have been successful.

According to North Korea Academy of Science&#x27;s Academician Kwon Tong-hwa, the SLV was developed in the 1980s when late leader Kim Il Sung announced the decision to launch a North Korean satellite.

The decision to send a North Korean satellite was precipitated by the successful launching of South Korea&#x27;s first satellite, Uribyol-1, on 10 August 1992 and its second satellite, Uribyol 2, on 26 September 1993, both by a European Ariane 4 SLV. In a late-1993 meeting of the Korean Workers&#x27; Party Central Committee, Kim Il Sung expressed his desire to quickly place a satellite into orbit, leading to the expansion of North Korea&#x27;s nascent space program and the requirement for a space launch vehicle.
==Launch attempts==
===First orbital launch attempt===

On 4 September 1998, the official Korean Central News Agency announced that a satellite called &quot;Kwangmyŏngsŏng-1&quot; had been launched at 3:07 UTC on 31 August from a launch site in Musudan-ri, Hwadae-gun, North Hamgyong Province by a Paektusan-1 satellite launch vehicle (SLV). No objects were ever tracked in orbit from the launch, and outside North Korea it is considered to have been a failure.

United States Space Command reported that the satellite failed to reach orbit, and burned up in the atmosphere. The failure is believed to have occurred during the third stage burn.

North Korea&#x27;s leader Kim Jong Il revealed that the country had spent approximately 200–300 million dollars for the satellite project during a summit with then-South Korean president Kim Dae-Jung in 2000.

===Second orbital launch attempt===
Kwangmyŏngsŏng-2 was a satellite launched by North Korea on 5 April 2009. According to the North Korean government, an Unha-2 rocket carrying the satellite was launched on Sunday 5 April 2009 at 11:20 local time (02:20 UTC) from the Tonghae Satellite Launching Ground at Musudan-ri in northeastern North Korea. However, officials in South Korea and the United States reported that the rocket and any payload had fallen into the Pacific Ocean. The Russian Space Control concurred, stating that the satellite &quot;simply is not there&quot;.

Prior to the launch, concern was raised by other nations, particularly the United States, South Korea and Japan, that the launch might be a trial run of technology that could be used in the future to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile. The launch of the rocket was sharply condemned by the United States and the European Union, while the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Russia urged restraint.

===Third launch attempt===
Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 was a polar-orbiting earth observation satellite that North Korea tried to launch 13 April 2012 from the Sohae Satellite Launching Station at Cholsan County in northwestern North Korea. The satellite was to be lifted by a Unha-3 carrier rocket. The satellite launch was timed to coincide with the centenary of Kim Il Sung&#x27;s birth. The rocket broke up a minute after its launch and the remains fell into the ocean.

===Fourth launch attempt===
On 1 December 2012, the Korean Central News Agency said that the Korean Committee for Space Technology announced that it would launch a second version of Kwangmyongsong-3 to be lifted by a Unha-3 carrier rocket at the Sohae Satellite Launching Station on a launch period between 10 and 22 December 2012.

The launch was carried out on 12 December 2012, at 09:50 local time (00:50 UTC) and the satellite entered polar orbit, as confirmed by monitoring agencies in South Korea and North America with NORAD #39026 and International designator 2012-072A.

===Fifth launch attempt===

Kwangmyongsong-4 or KMS-4 is an Earth observation satellite launched by North Korea on 7 February 2016.

On 7 February 2016, roughly a month after an alleged hydrogen bomb test, North Korea claimed to have put a satellite into orbit around the Earth. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe had warned the North to not launch the rocket, and if it did and the rocket violated Japanese territory, it would be shot down. Nevertheless, North Korea launched the rocket anyway, claiming the satellite was purely intended for peaceful, scientific purposes. Several nations, including the United States, Japan, and South Korea, have criticized the launch, and despite North Korean claims that the rocket was for peaceful purposes, it has been heavily criticized as an attempt to perform an ICBM test under the disguise of a peaceful satellite launch. China also criticized the launch; however it urged &quot;the relevant parties&quot; to &quot;refrain from taking actions that may further escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula&quot;.
===Planned sixth launch attempt===
There are plans to a sixth launch attempt of a Kwangmyŏngsŏng program satellite, called Kwangmyŏngsŏng-5. In late December 2017, it is reported that Kwangmyŏngsŏng-5 had completed and could be launched on a mobile launch platform. The satellite was reported to be equipped with cameras and telecommunication devices, as well as the capability of transmitting data back to Earth.

So far, the Kwangmyŏngsŏng-5 has not been launched.

==In popular culture==
The Kwangmyŏngsŏng-1 satellite has since featured prominently in North Korean festivities and celebrations such as the mass games. Commemorative stamps showing the real shape of the satellite still attached to the spin up solid motor orbital insertion third stage and more than two orbits have also been printed on several occasions.

<doc id="1031191" wikidata="Q1385398" url="?curid=1031191" title="Extraordinary rendition">
<text>Extraordinary rendition is a euphemism for state-sponsored kidnapping in another jurisdiction and transfer to a third state. The phrase usually refers to a United States-led program used during the War on Terror, which had the purpose of circumventing the source country&#x27;s laws on interrogation, detention, extradition and/or torture. Extraordinary rendition is a type of extraterritorial abduction, but not all extraterritorial abductions include transfer to a third country.

Extraordinary rendition began under the administration of President Bill Clinton and continued under the administration of President George W. Bush. Hundreds of &quot;illegal combatants&quot; were abducted for U.S. detention, and transported detainees to U.S.-controlled sites as part of an extensive interrogation program that included torture. Extraordinary rendition continued under the Obama administration, with targets being interrogated and subsequently taken to the U.S. for trial. A 2018 report by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament found the United Kingdom, specifically MI5 and MI6, to be complicit in many of the renditions carried out by the U.S., by helping to fund them, by supplying intelligence, and by knowingly allowing the abductions to happen.

In July 2014, the European Court of Human Rights condemned the government of Poland for participating in CIA extraordinary rendition, ordering Poland to pay restitution to men who had been abducted, taken to a CIA black site in Poland, and tortured. Torture is banned under the European Convention on Human Rights, which 46 nations, including Poland, have pledged to uphold.

== Background ==
By 2004, critics alleged that torture was used against subjects with the knowledge or acquiescence of the United States, where the transfer of a person for the purpose of torture is unlawful. In addition, some former detainees, such as the Australian citizen Mamdouh Habib, claimed to have been transferred to other countries for interrogation under torture. In December 2005, then Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice insisted:

The United States has not transported anyone, and will not transport anyone, to a country when we believe he will be tortured. Where appropriate, the United States seeks assurances that transferred persons will not be tortured.

Between 2001 and 2005, CIA officers captured an estimated one hundred fifty people and transported them around the world.

Under the Bush administration, rendered persons were reported to have undergone torture by receiving countries. Journalists, civil and constitutional rights groups, and former detainees have alleged that this occurred with the knowledge or cooperation of the administrations of the United States and the United Kingdom.

Such revelations prompted several official investigations into alleged secret detentions and unlawful interstate transfers involving Council of Europe members. A June 2006 report estimated that one hundred people had been kidnapped by the CIA on European Union soil with the cooperation of Council of Europe members and rendered to other countries, often after having transited through secret detention centers (&quot;black sites&quot;), some located in Europe. According to the separate European Parliament report of February 2007, the CIA has conducted 1,245 flights, many of them to destinations where suspects could face torture, in violation of Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture. A large majority of the European Union Parliament endorsed the report&#x27;s conclusion that many member states tolerated illegal actions by the CIA, criticizing several European governments and intelligence agencies for their unwillingness to cooperate with the investigation.

Within days of his 2009 inauguration, Barack Obama signed an executive order opposing rendition torture and established a task force to provide recommendations about processes to prevent rendition torture. His administration distanced itself from some of the harshest counterterrorism techniques but permitted the practice of rendition to continue, restricting transport of suspects to countries with jurisdiction over them for the purpose of prosecution after diplomatic assurances &quot;that they [would] not be treated inhumanely&quot; had been received.

== Definitions ==
Rendition, in law, is a transfer of persons from one jurisdiction to another, and the act of handing over, both after legal proceedings and according to law. &quot;Extraordinary rendition,&quot; however, is a rendition that is extralegal, i.e. outside the law (see: kidnapping). Rendition refers to the transfer; the apprehension, detention, interrogation, and any other practices occurring before and after the movement and exchange of extrajudicial prisoners do not fall into the strict definition of &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot;. In practice, the term is widely used to describe such practices, particularly the initial apprehension. This latter usage extends to the transfer of suspected terrorists by the US to countries known to torture prisoners or employ harsh interrogation techniques that may rise to the level of torture.

The Bush administration freely admitted to this practice; stating, among other provisions, that they have specifically asked that torture not be used. However, torture can still occur despite these provisions, and much documentation exists alleging that it has happened in many cases. In these instances, the initial captor allows the possibility of torture by releasing the prisoner into the custody of nations that practice torture.

The next distinction of degree is that of intent, where much of the search for evidence continues. It has been alleged that some of those detainees have been tortured with the knowledge, acquiescence, or even participation of US agencies. A transfer of anyone to anywhere for torture would be a violation of US law. New York attorney Marc D. Falkoff stated that such evidence, i.e. transfer for the purposes of torture, was an operational practice. In a court filing, Falkoff described a classified prisoner transfer memo from Guantanamo as noting that information could not be retrieved, as torture could not be used, and recommending that the prisoner be sent to a nation that practiced torture.

== Historical instances ==
=== Historical cases ===

The American Civil Liberties Union alleges that extraordinary rendition was developed during the Clinton administration. CIA officials in the mid-1990s were trying to track down and dismantle militant Islamic organizations in the Middle East, particularly Al Qaeda.

According to Clinton administration official Richard Clarke:

Both the Bush and Clinton cases involved apprehending known terrorists abroad, by covert means if necessary. The Bush administration expanded the policy after the 9/11 attacks.

In a &quot;New Yorker&quot; interview with CIA veteran Michael Scheuer, an author of the rendition program under the Clinton administration, writer Jane Mayer noted:

In 1995, American agents proposed the rendition program to Egypt, making clear that it had the resources to track, capture, and transport terrorist suspects globally – including access to a small fleet of aircraft. Egypt embraced the idea ... &#x27;What was clever was that some of the senior people in Al Qaeda were Egyptian,&#x27; Scheuer said. &#x27;It served American purposes to get these people arrested, and Egyptian purposes to get these people back, where they could be interrogated.&#x27; Technically, U.S. law requires the CIA to seek &#x27;assurances&#x27; from foreign governments that rendered suspects won&#x27;t be tortured. Scheuer told me that this was done, but he was &#x27;not sure&#x27; if any documents confirming the arrangement were signed.

Scheuer testified in 2007 before Congress that no such assurances were received. He acknowledged that treatment of prisoners may not have been &quot;up to U.S. standards&quot;:

This is a matter of no concern as the Rendition Program&#x27;s goal was to protect America. The rendered fighters delivered to Middle Eastern governments are now either dead or in places from which they cannot harm America. Mission accomplished, as the saying goes.

Thereafter, with the approval of President Clinton and a presidential directive (PDD 39), the CIA elected to send suspects to Egypt, where they were turned over to the Egyptian Mukhabarat. (→ Tal&#x27;at Fu&#x27;ad Qasim)

=== 20th century ===
The CIA was granted permission to use rendition of indicted terrorists to American soil in a 1995 presidential directive signed by President Bill Clinton, following a procedure established by George H. W. Bush in January 1993.

The United States has since increasingly used rendition as a tool in the &quot;war on terror&quot;, ignoring the normal extradition processes outlined in international law. Suspects taken into United States custody are delivered to third-party states, often without ever having been on United States soil, and without involving the rendering countries.

Critics have accused the CIA of employing rendition for the purpose of circumventing American laws mandating due process and prohibiting torture, labeling the practice &quot;torture flights&quot;. Sociological comparisons have been drawn between extraordinary rendition and the death flights implemented, most notably, by Argentina during the 1960s and 1970s. Defenders of the practice argue that culturally informed and native-language interrogations are more successful in gaining information from suspects.

Hundreds of documents retrieved from Libyan foreign ministry offices in Tripoli following the 2011 Libyan civil war show that the CIA and MI6 rendered suspects to Libyan authorities knowing they would be tortured.

In a number of cases, such as those of Khalid El-Masri and Maher Arar, suspects caught up in the procedure suffered lengthy detentions, despite ultimately being found innocent. The CIA reportedly launched an investigation into such incidents of &quot;erroneous rendition&quot;.

=== 21st century ===

Following the 11 September 2001 attacks the United States, in particular the CIA, has been accused of rendering hundreds of people suspected by the government of being terrorists—or of aiding and abetting terrorist organizations—to third-party states such as Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Uzbekistan. Such &quot;ghost detainees&quot; are kept outside judicial oversight, often without ever entering US territory, and may or may not ultimately be transferred to the custody of the United States.

According to a 4 December 2005 article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; by Dana Priest:

Members of the Rendition Group follow a simple but standard procedure: Dressed head to toe in black, including masks, they blindfold and cut the clothes off their new captives, then administer an enema and sleeping drugs. They outfit detainees in a diaper and jumpsuit for what can be a day-long trip. Their destinations: either a detention facility operated by cooperative countries in the Middle East and Central Asia, including Afghanistan, or one of the CIA&#x27;s own covert prisons—referred to in classified documents as &quot;black sites&quot;, which at various times have been operated in eight countries, including several in Eastern Europe.

Following mounting scrutiny in Europe, including investigations held by the Swiss State Councillor Dick Marty who released a public report in June 2006, the US Senate, in December 2005, was about to approve a measure that would include amendments requiring the Director of National Intelligence to provide regular, detailed updates about secret detention facilities maintained by the United States overseas, and to account for the treatment and condition of each prisoner.

== Reported methods ==
Media reports describe suspects as being arrested, blindfolded, shackled, and sedated, or otherwise kidnapped, and transported by private jet or other means to the destination country. The reports also say that the rendering countries have provided interrogators with lists of questions. Detainees, referred to as enemy combatants by the US administration, were commonly hooded and tethered to the floor of cargo planes during flights. As their movement was restricted by shackles they were required to wear diapers during the entire duration of flights.

=== Airline flights ===
On 4 October 2001, a secret arrangement was made in Brussels by all members of NATO. Lord George Robertson, British defense secretary and later NATO&#x27;s secretary-general, would later explain NATO members agreed to provide &quot;blanket overflight clearances for the United States and other allies&#x27; aircraft for military flights related to operations against terrorism.&quot;

==== Boeing Jeppesen international trip planning ====
On 23 October 2006, the &quot;New Yorker&quot; reported that Jeppesen, a subsidiary of Boeing, handled the logistical planning for the CIA&#x27;s extraordinary rendition flights. The allegation is based on information from an ex-employee who quoted Bob Overby, managing director of the company as saying &quot;We do all of the extraordinary rendition flights—you know, the torture flights. Let&#x27;s face it, some of these flights end up that way. It certainly pays well.&quot; The article went on to suggest that this may make Jeppesen a potential defendant in a lawsuit by Khaled El-Masri. Jeppesen was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the ACLU on 30 May 2007, on behalf of several other individuals who were allegedly subject to extraordinary rendition.

The suit was dismissed on 8 September 2010 by a federal appeals court because &quot;going forward would reveal state secrets&quot;.

=== Black sites ===
In 2005, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published revelations concerning CIA flights and &quot;black sites&quot;, covert prisons operated by the CIA and whose existence is denied by the US government. The European Parliament published a report in February 2007 concerning the use of such secret detention centers and extraordinary rendition (&quot;See below&quot;). These detention centers violate the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the UN Convention Against Torture, treaties that all EU member states are bound to follow.

According to ABC News two such facilities, in countries mentioned by Human Rights Watch, have been closed following the publicity. CIA officers say the captives were relocated to the North African desert. All but one of these 11 high-value al Qaeda prisoners were subjected to torture by the CIA, sometimes referred to as &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; authorized for use by about 14 CIA officers.

==== Extraordinary renditions and black sites in Europe ====

In January 2005, Swiss senator Dick Marty, representative at the Council of Europe in charge of the European investigations, concluded that 100 people had been kidnapped by the CIA in Europe—thus qualifying as ghost detainees—and then rendered to a country where they may have been tortured. Marty qualified the sequestration of Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr (aka &quot;Abu Omar&quot;) in Milan in February 2003 as a &quot;perfect example of extraordinary rendition.&quot; (See below: Council of Europe investigation and its two reports)

&quot;The Guardian&quot; reported on 5 December 2005, that the government of the United Kingdom is &quot;guilty of breaking international law if it knowingly allowed secret CIA &quot;rendition&quot; flights of terror suspects to land at UK airports, according to a report by American legal scholars.&quot;

According to &quot;Raw Story&quot;, the Polish site identified by reporter Larisa Alexandrovna and Polish intelligence officer David Dastych is Stare Kiejkuty. In response to these allegations, former Polish intelligence chief, Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, embarked on a media blitz and claimed that the allegations made by Alexandrovna and Dastych were &quot;...part of the domestic political battle in the US over who is to succeed current Republican President George W Bush,&quot; according to the German news agency Deutsche Presse Agentur.&quot;

==== Prison ships ====
The United States has also been accused of operating &quot;floating prisons&quot; to house and transport those arrested in its &quot;War on Terror&quot;, according to human rights lawyers. They have claimed that the US has tried to conceal the numbers and whereabouts of detainees. Although no credible information to support these assertions has ever come to light, the alleged justification for prison ships is primarily to remove the ability for jihadists to target a fixed location to facilitate the escape of high value targets, commanders, operations chiefs etc.

== Example cases ==
=== Khaled Masri case ===

Khalid El-Masri (born 1963) is a German citizen who was mistakenly abducted by the Macedonian police, and handed over to the U.S. CIA. While in CIA custody, he was flown to Afghanistan, where he was allegedly held in a black site, interrogated, beaten, strip-searched, sodomized, and subjected to other inhuman and degrading treatment, which at times escalated to torture, though none of those claims can be verified. After El-Masri held hunger strikes, and was detained for four months in the &quot;Salt Pit&quot;, the CIA finally admitted his arrest was a mistake and released him. He is believed to be among an estimated 3,000 detainees, including several key leaders of al Qaeda, whom the CIA captured from 2001 to 2005, in its campaign to dismantle terrorist networks.

=== Abu Omar case ===
In 2003, Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr (aka &quot;Abu Omar&quot;) was kidnapped by the CIA in Milan (Italy), and deported to Egypt. His case has been characterized by the Swiss senator Dick Marty as a &quot;perfect example of extraordinary rendition&quot;. Abu Omar was kidnapped as he walked to his mosque in Milan for noon prayers. He was transported on a Learjet (using the call sign SPAR 92) to Ramstein, Germany. SPAR (Special Air Resources) is the call sign used by US senior military officers and civilian VIPs for airlift transport. A second plane took him to Cairo, where he was imprisoned and, he claims, tortured.

In 2005, the Italian judge Guido Salvini issued a warrant for the arrest of 13 persons said to be agents or operatives of the CIA in association with Nasr&#x27;s kidnapping. In December 2005, an Italian court issued a European arrest warrant against 22 CIA agents suspected of this kidnapping (including Robert Seldon Lady, Eliana Castaldo, Lt. Col. Joseph L. Romano, III, etc.). The CIA has not commented on the case, while Berlusconi&#x27;s government has denied any knowledge of a kidnapping plot. Just after the 2006 Italian general elections, Roberto Castelli (Lega Nord), outgoing Justice Minister, declared to Italian prosecutors that he had not passed the extradition request to the US.

In 2005, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported Italian court documents which showed that the CIA tried to mislead Italian anti-terrorism police who were looking for the cleric at the time. Robert S. Lady, the CIA&#x27;s substation chief in Milan, has been implicated in the abduction. In a written opinion upholding the arrest warrant, judge Enrico Manzi wrote that the evidence taken from Lady&#x27;s home &quot;removes any doubt about his participation in the preparatory phase of the abduction.&quot; Lady, however, alleged that the evidence had been gathered illegally, and has denied involvement in the abduction. Photos of Robert (Bob) Lady and other defendants surfaced on the Web.

Marco Mancini, the SISMI director of anti-terrorism and counterespionage, and Gustavo Pignero, the department&#x27;s director in 2003, have been arrested on charges of complicity in a kidnapping, with the aggravating circumstances of abuse of power. Italian judges have issued 26 EU arrest warrants for U.S. citizens in connection with this event. A judge also issued arrest warrants for four Americans, three CIA agents and an Air Force officer who commanded the security forces at Aviano Air Base at the time of the abduction.

In 2007, Nasr&#x27;s lawyer said Egypt had released him and he was back with his family.

In 2009, an Italian judge convicted 22 suspected or known CIA agents, a U.S. Air Force (USAF) colonel, and two Italian secret agents of the kidnapping. These were the first legal convictions in the world against people involved in the CIA&#x27;s extraordinary renditions program.

=== Majid Mahmud Abdu Ahmad case ===

A story in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 2005 seems to corroborate the claims of &quot;torture by proxy.&quot; It mentions the attorneys for Majid Mahmud Abdu Ahmad, a detainee held by the Pentagon at Guantanamo Bay, filed a petition to prevent his being transferred to foreign countries. According to the petition&#x27;s description of a redacted classified Defense Department memo from 2004, its contents say &quot;officials suggested sending Ahmad to an unspecified foreign country that employed torture in order to increase chances of extracting information from him.&quot;

Mr Falkoff, representing Ahmad, continued: &quot;There is only one meaning that can be gleaned from this short passage,&quot; the petition says. &quot;The government believes that Mr. Ahmad has information that it wants but that it cannot extract without torturing him.&quot; The petition goes on to say that because torture is not allowed at Guantanamo, &quot;the recommendation is that Mr. Ahmad should be sent to another country where he can be interrogated under torture.&quot;
In a report, regarding the allegations of CIA flights, on 13 December 2005, the rapporteur and Chair of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe&#x27;s Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights, Swiss councillor Dick Marty, concluded: &quot;The elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees—outside all judicial procedure—in European countries.&quot;
In a press conference in January 2006, he stated &quot;he was personally convinced the US had undertaken illegal activities in Europe in transporting and detaining prisoners.&quot;

=== Muhammad Bashmila case ===
Muhammad Bashmila, a former secret prisoner, now free in Yemen, gave an interview to the BBC &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme, where he spoke of being transferred from Afghanistan to a detention center where it was cold, where the food appeared European and where evening prayers were held. Somewhere in Eastern Europe is suspected. This claim cannot be confirmed.

=== Maher Arar case ===

Maher Arar, a Syrian-born dual Syrian and Canadian citizen, was detained at Kennedy International Airport on 26 September 2002, by US Immigration and Naturalization Service officials. He was heading home to Canada after a family holiday in Tunisia. After almost two weeks, enduring hours of interrogation chained, he was sent, shackled and bound, in a private jet to Jordan and then Syria, instead of being deported to Canada. There, he was interrogated and tortured by Syrian intelligence. Maher Arar was eventually released a year later. He told the BBC that he was repeatedly tortured during 10 months&#x27; detention in Syria—often whipped on the palms of his hands with metal cables. Syrian intelligence officers forced him to sign a confession linking him to Al Qaeda.

He was finally released following intervention by the Canadian government. The Canadian government lodged an official complaint with the US government protesting Arar&#x27;s deportation. On 18 September 2006, a Canadian public enquiry presented its findings, entirely clearing Arar of any terrorist activities. In 2004 Arar filed a lawsuit in a federal court in New York against senior U.S. officials, on charges that whoever sent him to Syria knew he would be tortured by intelligence agents. US Attorney General John Ashcroft, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge and FBI Director Robert Mueller were all named in the lawsuit. In 2009, a U.S. federal appeals court ruled that U.S. law did not allow victims of extraordinary rendition to sue U.S. officials for torture suffered overseas.

In 2006, Arar received the Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award from the Institute for Policy Studies for his ordeal. In 2007, Maher Arar received a public apology from the U.S. House of Representatives. U.S. Representative Dana Rohrabacher, who apologized, stated that he would fight any efforts to end the practice.

In 2007, Arar was awarded $10.5 million in compensation from the Canadian government for pain and suffering in his ordeal and a formal apology from Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

== Other cases ==
&quot;This is a non-exhaustive list of some alleged examples of extraordinary rendition. Most cannot be confirmed.&quot;
* A Pakistani newspaper reported that in the early hours of 23 October 2001 a Yemeni citizen, Jamil Qasim Saeed Mohammed, a 27-year-old microbiology student at Karachi University, was spirited aboard a private plane at Karachi&#x27;s airport by Pakistani security officers.
* In October 2001, Mamdouh Habib, who lives in Australia and has both Australian and Egyptian nationality (having been born in Egypt), was detained in Pakistan, where he was interrogated for three weeks, and then flown to Egypt in a private plane. From Egypt, he was later flown to a US airbase in Afghanistan. He told the BBC that he did not know who had held him, but had seen Americans, Australians, Pakistanis, and Egyptians among his captors. He also said that he had been beaten, given electric shocks, deprived of sleep, blindfolded for eight months and brainwashed. After signing confessions of involvement with al-Qaeda, which he has now retracted, Mr Habib was transferred to Guantanamo Bay. He was released without charge in January 2005. Former Pakistani Interior Minister Makhdoom Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat told in an interview by the Australian current affairs programme &quot;Dateline&quot; that Mr Habib was linked with the &quot;terrorist element&quot; operating at that time. However, he contradicted himself a few minutes later, in the same interview, saying that Habib had been assumed guilty because he was in the restricted province of Baluchistan without proper visa documents.
* In late 2001 Saddiq Ahmad Turkistani was freed by US forces from a Taliban prison in Kandahar, Afghanistan. At a news conference, he told reporters and U.S. officials he had been wrongly imprisoned for allegedly plotting to kill Osama bin Laden. He was then taken to a U.S. military base in Afghanistan, where he was stripped, bound and thrown behind bars. According to U.S. lawyers who represent him, in January 2002 he was sent to the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Nearly four years later, Turkistani remained there, despite being cleared for release early 2005 after a government review concluded he is &quot;no longer an enemy combatant.&quot; It is unclear exactly when that determination was made, but Justice Department lawyers gave notice of it in an 11 October court filing. According to a 26 June 2006 press release from the Saudi Arabian embassy, Turkistani was released from Guantanamo to Saudi custody.
* In 2002, captured Al Qaeda leader Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi was rendered to Egypt where he was allegedly tortured. The information he provided to his interrogators formed a fundamental part of the Bush administration case for attacking Iraq, alleging links between Al Qaeda and Iraq. Al-Libi later recanted his story and it is generally believed that his stories of contact between the Saddam Hussein regime and Al-Qaeda were fabricated to please his interrogators.
* Ahmed Agiza and Muhammad al-Zery, two Egyptians who had been seeking asylum in Sweden, were arrested by Swedish police in December 2001. They were taken to Bromma airport in Stockholm, had their clothes cut from their bodies, suppositories were inserted in their anuses and they were put in diapers, overalls, hoods, hand and ankle cuffs, they were then put onto a jet with American registration N379P with a crew of masked men. They were flown to Egypt, where they were imprisoned, beaten, and tortured according to Swedish investigative programme &quot;Kalla fakta&quot;. The Swedish ambassador visited them only six weeks later. Agiza was previously charged and sentenced in absentia with being an Islamic militant and was sentenced to 25 years, a sentence that was reduced to 15 years due to the political pressure after the Rendition became known. Al-Zery wasn&#x27;t charged, and after two years in jail without ever seeing a judge or prosecutor he was sent to his village in Egypt. In 2008 Al-Zery was awarded $500,000 in damages by the Swedish government for the wrongful treatment he received in Sweden and the subsequent torture in Egypt.
* In March 2002, Abou Elkassim Britel, an Italian citizen with Moroccan origins, was arrested in Pakistan and subsequently interrogated by Pakistani and US officials. He was then rendered to Moroccan authorities, detained and tortured in a secret Temara interrogation centre. He was finally released without any charges brought against him, before being rearrested in May 2003 at the border crossing of the Spanish enclave of Melilla in North Africa. He is currently imprisoned in Äin Bourja prison in Casablanca after having been sentenced to nine years in January 2004 for membership of a subversive organisation and for activities including holding unauthorised meetings. This in spite of conclusions in September 2006 by Italian Justice, after a five years investigation, that there was &quot;an absolute lack of grounds of evidence of charge which may be used in trial&quot; and that the suspicion motivating the inquiries had proved unfounded. Nonetheless, allegations in the Italian press and the judicial proceedings that were underway in Italy influenced court proceedings against Britel in Morocco that led to him being sentenced. MPs from Italy and from the European Parliament are set to ask the Moroccan Royal Cabinet to grant a pardon to the Italian citizen. According to the European Parliament &quot;Temporary Committee on the Alleged Use of European Countries by the CIA for the Transport and the Illegal Detention of Prisoners&quot; headed by rapporteur Giovanni Claudio Fava, documents demonstrated that &quot;the Italian judicial authorities and the Italian Ministry for Home Affairs (the latter, acting on behalf of the &quot;Direzione Centrale della Polizia di Prevenzione&quot; cited in connection with the investigation by the &quot;Divisione Investigazioni Generali ed Operazioni Speciali&quot;) cooperated constantly with foreign secret services and were well aware of all Britel&#x27;s movements and whatever unlawful treatments he received, from the time of his initial arrest in Pakistan.&quot;
* In 2003, an Algerian named Laid Saidi was abducted in Tanzania and taken to Afghanistan, where he was imprisoned and tortured along with Khalid El-Masri. His detention appears to have arisen through a mistranslation of a telephone conversation, in which U.S. officials believed he was speaking about airplanes (&quot;tairat&quot; in Arabic) when he had in fact been speaking about tires (&quot;tirat&quot; in Arabic).
* Binyam Mohammed, an Ethiopian student who lived in London, was apprehended in Pakistan in April 2002. He allegedly spent three years in &quot;black sites,&quot; including in Morocco and Afghanistan. He was supposed to be part of a plot involving José Padilla. The Observer reported: &quot;He went to Pakistan in June 2001 because, he says, he had a drug problem and wanted to quit. He was arrested on 10 April at the airport on his way back to England because of an alleged passport irregularity. Initially interrogated by Pakistani and British officials, he told Stafford Smith: &quot;The British checked out my story and said they knew I was a nobody. They said they would tell the Americans.&quot; He was deprived of sleep by having heavy rock music played loudly throughout the day and night.
* On 13 December 2004, Rodrigo Granda, a FARC terrorist was captured in Caracas, Venezuela by a group of Colombian intelligence officials. Granda was clandestinely transported to the Colombian city of Cúcuta, near the border with Venezuela, where his capture was legalised by the corresponding authorities. After the capture of Granda became publicly known, the Venezuelan Government broke relations with Colombia as response of violations to its sovereignty.
* On 5 April 2006, Amnesty International released details of the United States&#x27; system of extraordinary rendition, stating that three Yemeni citizens were held somewhere in Eastern Europe.
* On 21 February 2008, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband admitted that two United States extraordinary rendition flights refuelled on Diego Garcia in 2002, and was &quot;very sorry&quot; that earlier denials by British government ministers were having to be corrected.
* The case of Mohammed Haydar Zammar, now a terrorist for ISIL.

=== Investigations by multi-nation groups ===

==== Council of Europe investigation and its two reports ====
On 25 November 2005, the lead investigator for the Council of Europe, Swiss lawmaker Dick Marty announced that he had obtained latitude and longitude coordinates for suspected black sites, and he was planning to use satellite imagery over the last several years as part of his investigation. On 28 November 2005, EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini asserted that any EU country which had operated a secret prison would have its voting rights suspended. In a preliminary report, Dick Marty declared that it was &quot;doubtful that European governments, or at least their intelligence services, were unaware&quot; of the CIA kidnapping of a &quot;hundred&quot; persons on European territory and their subsequent rendition to countries where they may be tortured.

The report from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of the Council of Europe directed by Dick Marty, and made public on 7 June 2006, was titled: &quot;Alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving Council of Europe member states.&quot;

Following the publication of this report, the Council of Europe published its draft Recommendation and Resolution document which
found grounds for concern with the conduct of both the US and member states of the EU and expresses concern for the disregard of international law and the Geneva Convention. Following a 23-point resolution the document makes five recommendations.
* 1 refers to its Resolution on alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving Council of Europe member states.
* 2 recalling its previous recommendation on the legality of the detention of persons by the United States in Guantanamo Bay
* 3 urges the Committee of Ministers to draft a recommendation to Council of Europe member States containing:
:common measures to guarantee more effectively the human rights of persons suspected of terrorist offences who are captured from, detained in or transported through Council of Europe member States; and a set of minimum requirements for &quot;human rights protection clauses&quot;, for inclusion in bilateral and multilateral agreements with third parties, especially those concerning the use of military installations on the territory of Council of Europe member States.
* 4 urgently requests that: an initiative be launched on an international level, expressly involving the United States, an Observer to the Council of Europe, to develop a common, truly global strategy to address the terrorist threat. The strategy should conform in all its elements with the fundamental principles of our common heritage in terms of democracy, human rights and respect for the rule of law. Also, a proposal be considered, in instances where States are unable or unwilling to prosecute persons accused of terrorist acts, to bring these persons within the jurisdiction of an international court that is competent to try them. One possibility worth considering would be to vest such a competence in the International Criminal Court, whilst renewing invitations to join the Court to the United States and other countries that have not yet done so.
* 5 recommends improving the Council of Europe&#x27;s ability to react rapidly and effectively to allegations of systematic human rights abuse involving several member States.

Several months before the publication of the Council of Europe report directed by Dick Marty, Gijs de Vries, the EU&#x27;s antiterrorism coordinator, asserted in April 2006 that no evidence existed that extraordinary rendition had been taking place in Europe. It was also said that the European Union&#x27;s probe, and a similar one by the continent&#x27;s leading human rights group had not found any human rights violations nor other crimes that could be proven to the satisfaction of the courts. This denial from a member of the executive power of the EU institutions has been questioned by the European Parliament report, which was accepted by a vast majority of the Parliament in February 2007 (&quot;See below:The European Parliament&#x27;s 14 February 2007 report&quot;).

On the other hand, Dick Marty explained the difference of approach concerning terrorism between the EU and the US as following:
While the states of the Old World have dealt with these threats primarily by means of existing institutions and legal systems, the United States appears to have made a fundamentally different choice: considering that neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism, it decided to develop new legal concepts. This legal approach is utterly alien to the European tradition and sensibility, and is clearly contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

However, despite Marty&#x27;s claims, the European Parliament investigations uncovered cooperation between European secret services and governments and the extraordinary renditions programs, making such a clear-cut distinction over-simplistic (&quot;see below&quot;). Dick Marty himself has not accepted such a dualistic approach, as he showed that for the British government also, the phenomenon of Islamic terrorism was alleged to be so grave that the balance of liberties had to be reconsidered. Marty&#x27;s report stated that:

The compilation of so-called &quot;black lists&quot; of individuals and companies suspected of maintaining connections with organisations considered terrorist and the application of the associated sanctions clearly breach every principle of the fundamental right to a fair trial: no specific charges, no right to be heard, no right of appeal, no established procedure for removing one&#x27;s name from the list.

The second report was released on 8 June 2007

==== 27 June 2006 Council of Europe resolution ====
The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) accused the United States of operating a &quot;clandestine spiderweb of disappearances, secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers&quot; and called for EU regulations governing foreign intelligence services operating in Europe, and demanded &quot;human rights clauses&quot; in military base agreements with the USA.

In a resolution and recommendation approved by a large majority, the Assembly also called for:
* The dismantling by the US of its system of detentions and transfers.
* A review of bilateral agreements between Council of Europe member states and the US, particularly on the status of US forces stationed in Europe and on the use of military and other instrastructures, to ensure they conform to international human rights norms.
* Official apologies and compensation for victims of illegal detentions against whom no formal accusations, nor any court proceedings, have ever been brought
* An international initiative, expressly involving the United States, to develop a common, truly global strategy to address the terrorist threat which conforms to democracy, human rights and the rule of law.

==== European Parliament&#x27;s investigation and report ====
The European Parliament launched its own investigation into the reports. In April 2006, MEPs leading the investigations expressed concerns that the CIA had conducted more than 1,000 secret flights over European territory since 2001, some to transfer terror suspects to countries that used torture. Investigators said that the same US agents and planes were involved over and over again. The Parliament adopted a resolution in July 2006 endorsing the Council of Europe&#x27;s conclusions, midway through its own investigation into the alleged program.

&quot;In a resolution passed on 14 February 2007 MEPs approved by a large majority (382 voting in favour, 256 against and 74 abstaining) their committee&#x27;s final report, which criticized the rendition program and concluded that many European countries tolerated illegal CIA activities including secret flights over their territories. The countries named were: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The report ...

According to the report, the CIA had operated 1,245 flights, many of them to destinations where suspects could face torture. The Parliament also called for the creation of an independent investigation commission and the closure of the Guantanamo camp. According to Italian Socialist Giovanni Fava, who drafted the document, there was a &quot;strong possibility&quot; that the intelligence obtained under the illegal extraordinary rendition program had been passed on to EU governments who were aware of how it was obtained. The report also uncovered the use of secret detention facilities used in Europe, including Romania and Poland. The report defines extraordinary renditions as instances where &quot;an individual suspected of involvement in terrorism is illegally abducted, arrested and/or transferred into the custody of US officials and/or transported to another country for interrogation which, in the majority of cases involves incommunicado detention and torture&quot;.

==== UN report by Manfred Nowak ====
Manfred Nowak, a special reporter on torture, has catalogued in a 15-page U.N. report presented to the 191-member General Assembly that the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Sweden and Kyrgyzstan are violating international human rights conventions by deporting terrorist suspects to countries such as Egypt, Syria, Algeria and Uzbekistan, where they may have been tortured.

&quot;The United States is holding at least 26 persons as &quot;ghost detainees&quot; at undisclosed locations outside of the United States,&quot; Human Rights Watch said on 1 December 2005, as it released a list naming some of the detainees. The detainees are being held indefinitely and incommunicado, without legal rights or access to counsel.

=== Investigations by NGOs ===
==== World Policy Council report ====
The World Policy Council, headed by Ambassador Horace Dawson and Senator Edward Brooke, criticized the Bush administration in the area of civil and human rights for its policy on extraordinary rendition. The Council concluded in its report that extraordinary rendition

=== Investigations by national governments ===
==== France ====
The French district attorney of Bobigny opened up an instruction (an investigation) in order &quot;to verify the presence in Le Bourget Airport, on 20 July 2005, of the plane numbered N50BH.&quot; This instruction was opened following a complaint deposed in December 2005 by the &quot;Ligue des droits de l&#x27;homme&quot; (LDH) NGO (&quot;Human Rights League&quot;) and the &quot;International Federation of Human Rights Leagues&quot; (FIDH) NGO on charges of &quot;arbitrary detention&quot;, &quot;crime of torture&quot; and &quot;non-respect of the rights of war prisoners&quot;. It has as objective to determine if the plane was used to transport CIA prisoners to Guantanamo Bay detainment camp and if the French authorities had knowledge of this stop. However, the lawyer defending the LDH declared that he was surprised that the instruction was only opened on 20 January 2006, and that no verifications had been done before.
On 2 December 2005, conservative newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; had revealed the existence of two CIA planes that had landed in France, suspected of transporting CIA prisoners. But the instruction concerned only N50BH, which was a Gulfstream III, which would have landed at Le Bourget on 20 July 2005, coming from Oslo, Norway. The other aircraft is suspected to have landed in Brest on 31 March 2002. It was investigated by the Canadian authorities, as it would have been flying from St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, via Keflavík in Iceland before going to Turkey.

==== Germany ====
Business daily &quot;Handelsblatt&quot; reported 24 November 2005, that the CIA used an American military base in Germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the German government. The &quot;Berliner Zeitung&quot; reported the following day there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a &quot;high probability&quot; of being operated by the CIA, at Ramstein, the Rhein-Main Air Base and others. The newspaper cited experts and &quot;plane-spotters&quot; who observed the planes as responsible for the tally.

In January 2007, the German government indicted 13 alleged CIA operatives for the abduction in Macedonia, transport to Afghanistan, and torture of Khaled el-Masri, a German citizen mistakenly believed to be a terrorist. Spanish authorities identified the suspected CIA abduction team from hotel records after a stopover by their Boeing 737 in Palma de Mallorca. Names of the alleged occupants of the rendition aircraft were James Fairing, Jason Franklin, Michael Grady, Lyle Edgard Lumsden III, Eric Fain, Bryam Charles, Kirk James Bird, Walter Richard Gressbore, Patricia Rilroy, Jane Payne, James O&#x27;Hale, John Decker, and Hector Lorenzo.

Many of these names proved to be aliases. Investigations by news organizations including the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, and &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; identified James Kovalesky (alias James Richard Fairing), Harry Kirk Elarbee (alias Kirk James Bird), and Eric Robert Hume (alias Eric Matthew Fain) as pilots working for Aero Contractors, a CIA flight contractor based in Smithfield, N.C. CBS News identified Lyle Edgard Lumsden III as a US Army captain who &quot;retired in 1992 from active duty, having served as a physician&#x27;s assistant&quot; whose last known address was &quot;the Washington DC area&quot;.

None of the names or aliases in this case match those of the 26 alleged CIA agents prosecuted by Italy (see Abu Omar case below). However, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported one of the pilots may have been involved in both incidents. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the 13 alleged CIA operatives were charged in indictments issued in Spain and in Munich, but because of &quot;intense political pressure from Washington&quot; Germany never requested their extradition. In Germany, unlike Italy, defendants cannot be tried &quot;in absentia&quot;.

==== Italy ====
In the &quot;Abu Omar case&quot; in Italy, Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr (aka Abu Omar), an Islamist cleric, was kidnapped in a joint CIA–SISMI operation in Milan on 17 February 2003, transferred to the Aviano Air Base, and then flown to Egypt, where he was held until 11 February 2007, when an Egyptian court ruled his imprisonment was &quot;unfounded&quot;. He claims he was abused on the Aviano Base and endured prolonged torture in Egypt. Italian prosecutors investigated the abduction, and indicted 26 US citizens including the head of CIA in Italy, Jeffrey W. Castelli. SISMI chief General Nicolò Pollari and second-in-command Marco Mancini were forced to resign, and were also indicted. On 4 November 2009, after a trial &quot;in absentia&quot;, an Italian judge found 23 Americans (names listed here) and the two Italians guilty. The sentences ranged from five to eight years for the Americans and three years each for the Italians. The judge acquitted three American diplomats, citing diplomatic immunity, along with five Italian secret service agents, including the former chief, citing state secrecy. In 2010 an Italian appellate court confirmed most of the verdicts and increased the sentences of the 23 Americans. Among those convicted was Stephen R. Kappes, later the number two man at the CIA, Robert Seldon Lady, formerly CIA station Chief in Milan, Col. Joseph L. Romano, a U S Air Force officer, and asserted CIA agent Sabrina De Sousa, who unsuccessfully sued the US State Department to grant her diplomatic immunity and shield her from arrest.

These were the first convictions anywhere in the world arising from the CIA&#x27;s practice of abducting terror suspects and transferring them to third countries where torture occurred. The US had tried but failed to obstruct the prosecutions by Italy&#x27;s independent judiciary. Following the convictions the US used threats and diplomatic pressure to stop the Italian executive branch from issuing arrest warrants and extradition requests for the Americans.

==== Ireland ====
The Irish government has come under internal and external pressure to inspect airplanes at Shannon Airport to investigate whether or not they contain extraordinary rendition captives.
Police at Shannon Airport said that they had received political instruction not to approach, search or otherwise interfere with US aircraft suspected of being involved in extraordinary rendition flights. Irish Justice Minister Dermot Ahern sought permission from the US for random inspection of US flights, to provide political &quot;cover&quot; to him in case rendition flights were revealed to have used Shannon; he believed at least three flights had done so.
The European Parliament has censured Ireland for its role in facilitating extraordinary rendition and taking insufficient or no measures to uphold its obligations under the UN CAT.

==== Kosovo ====
In 2002, the Council of Europe&#x27;s then-Commissioner for Human Rights Alvaro Gil-Robles witnessed &quot;a smaller version of Guantanamo&quot;, he told France&#x27;s &quot;Le Monde&quot; newspaper.
Gil-Robles told the daily that he had inspected the centre, located within the US military&#x27;s Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo, in 2002, to investigate reports of extrajudicial arrests by NATO-led peacekeepers.

==== Portugal ====
Portugal opened up an investigation concerning CIA flights in February 2007, on the basis of declarations by Socialist MEP Ana Gomes and by Rui Costa Pinto, journalist of &quot;Visão&quot; review. The Portuguese general prosecutor, Cândida Almeida, head of the Central Investigation and Penal Action Department (DCIAP), announced the opening of investigations on 5 February 2007. They were to be centered on the issue of &quot;torture or inhuman and cruel treatment,&quot; and instigated by allegations of &quot;illegal activities and serious human rights violations&quot; made by MEP Ana Gomes to the attorney general, Pinto Monteiro, on 26 January 2007. In February 2008, the UK NGO Reprieve published a report based on flight logs obtained by Ana Gomes, confirming that over 728 prisoners were flown to Guantánamo through Portuguese airspace, and hence through Portuguese jurisdiction, in at least 28 flights.

One of the most critic voice against the scarce collaboration provided by the Portuguese government to the European Parliament Commission which investigated CIA flights, Ana Gomes declared that, although she had no doubt that permission of these illegal flights were frequent during Durão Barroso (2002–2004) and Santana Lopes (2004–2005)&#x27; governments, &quot;during the [Socialist] government of José Sócrates [2005– ], 24 flights which passed through Portuguese territory&quot; are registered. Active in the TDIP commission, Ana Gomes complained about the Portuguese state&#x27;s reluctance to provide information, leading her to tensions with the Foreign minister, Luís Amado, member of the same party. Ana Gomes declared herself satisfied with the opening of the investigations, but underlined that she had always claimed that a parliamentary inquiry would be necessary.

On the other hand, journalist Rui Costa Pinto was heard by the DCIAP, as he had written an article, refused by &quot;Visão&quot;, about flights passing by Lajes Field, a Portuguese airbase used by the US Air Forces, in the Azores.

Approximately 150 CIA flights which have flown through Portugal have been identified.

==== Romania ====
Franco Frattini the European Union Justice Commissioner requested an explanation from the governments of Poland and Romania about the accusations made by Dick Marty. Doris Mircea (Romanian spokeswoman in Brussels) replied to this in November 2007 in a letter stating &quot;no person was kept illegally as a prisoner within Romanian jails and no illegal transfer of detainees passed through Romanian territory&quot; and that that was the official finding of a committee of inquiry set up by the government to investigate the accusations.

==== Spain ====
In November 2005, Spanish newspaper &quot;El País&quot; reported that CIA planes had landed in the Canary Islands and in Palma de Mallorca. Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzón, notable for his earlier attempt to prosecute Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, opened up an investigation concerning these landings which, according to Madrid, were made without official knowledge, thus being a breach of national sovereignty. Diplomatic cables leaked in 2010 suggest that the United States government including the American ambassador, worked with parts of the Spanish government to subvert the Spanish judicial process to control and ultimately stymie and thwart the investigation.

==== Sweden ====

Extraordinary rendition provoked a diplomatic crisis between the United States and Sweden in 2006 when Swedish authorities put a stop to CIA rendition flights. In December 2001 Swedish police detained Ahmed Agiza and Muhammad al-Zery, two Egyptians who had been seeking asylum in Sweden. The police took them to Bromma airport in Stockholm, and then stood aside as masked alleged CIA operatives cut their clothes from their bodies, inserted drugged suppositories in their anuses, and dressed them in diapers and overalls, handcuffed and chained them and put them on an executive jet with American registration N379P. They were flown to Egypt, where they were imprisoned, beaten, and tortured according to extensive investigate reports by Swedish programme &quot;Kalla fakta&quot;. A Swedish Parliamentary investigator concluded that the degrading and inhuman treatment of the two prisoners violated Swedish law. In 2006 the United Nations found Sweden had violated an international torture ban in its complicity in the CIA&#x27;s transfer of al-Zari to Egypt. Sweden imposed strict rules on rendition flights, but Swedish Military Intelligence posing as airport personnel who boarded one of two subsequent extraordinary rendition flights in 2006 during a stopover at Stockholm&#x27;s Arlanda International Airport found the Swedish restrictions were being ignored. In 2008 the Swedish government awarded al-Zery $500,000 in damages for the abuse he received in Sweden and the subsequent torture in Egypt.

==== United Kingdom ====
After claims by Liberty that British airports had been used by the &quot;CIA for extraordinary rendition flights, the Association of Chief Police Officers launched an investigation in November 2005. The report was published in June 2007 and found no evidence to support the claim. This was on the same day the Council of Europe released its report with evidence that the UK had colluded in extraordinary rendition, thus directly contradicting ACPO&#x27;s findings. Liberty has challenged the findings and has stated that its original claims were based on &quot;credible evidence&quot;.

In July 2007, the British government&#x27;s Intelligence and Security Committee released their Rendition report, detailing U.S. and U.K. activities and policies.

On 21 February 2008, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband admitted (despite previous government denials) that two U.S. extraordinary rendition flights had stopped on Diego Garcia in 2002, a U.K. territory. When questioned as to whether the government had deliberately misled the public over rendition, the Foreign Secretary apologised and stated that the government had simply &quot;made a mistake&quot;. His statement also laid out the current UK Government view on Extraordinary rendition;

A judicial inquiry, chaired by Sir Peter Gibson was announced by the government in July 2010, but was never formally launched and was scrapped in January 2012. According to the government, this was due to ongoing criminal investigations. In April 2012 the CIA and FBI won a court ruling in the US, exempting them from releasing documentation requested by British members of parliament. It later emerged that relevant 2002 flight records from Diego Garcia had been destroyed by water damage.

== &quot;Erroneous rendition&quot; ==
An article published on 5 December 2005, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the CIA&#x27;s Inspector General was investigating what it calls erroneous renditions. The term appears to refer to cases in which innocent people were subjected to extraordinary rendition.

Khalid El-Masri is the most well-known person who is believed to have been subjected to the process of &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot;, as a result of mistaken identity. Laid Saidi, an Algerian detained and tortured along with El-Masri, was apprehended apparently because of a taped telephone conversation in which the word &quot;tirat&quot;, meaning &quot;tires&quot; in Arabic, was mistaken for the word &quot;tairat&quot;, meaning &quot;airplanes&quot;.

The Post&#x27;s anonymous sources say that the Inspector General is looking into a number of similar cases—possibly as many as thirty innocent men who were captured and transported through what has been called &quot;erroneous renditions&quot;.

A 27 December 2005 story quotes anonymous CIA insiders claiming there have been 10 or fewer such erroneous renditions.
It names the CIA&#x27;s inspector general, John Helgerson, as the official responsible for the inquiry.

The AP story quotes Tom Malinowski, Washington office director of Human Rights Watch who said:

I am glad the CIA is investigating the cases that they are aware of, but by definition you are not going to be aware of all such cases, when you have a process designed to avoid judicial safeguards.

== Obama Executive Order on rendition ==
Two days after President Barack Obama was sworn into office, on 22 January 2009, he signed an executive order entitled &quot;Ensuring Lawful Interrogations&quot;. Overall, the executive order calls for more oversight of interrogation by third parties, but does not end extraordinary rendition. The section of the Executive Order relating to extraordinary rendition provides as follows:

On 2 November 2009 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that victims of extraordinary rendition cannot sue Washington for torture suffered overseas, because Congress has not authorized such lawsuits, in ruling on Canadian citizen Maher Arar&#x27;s case. On 15 September 2010 PolitiFact.com wrote about the Obama administration&#x27;s record on renditions:

The administration has announced new procedural safeguards concerning individuals who are sent to foreign countries. President Obama also promised to shut down the CIA-run &quot;black sites,&quot; and there seems to be anecdotal evidence that extreme renditions are not happening, at least not as much as they did during the Bush administration. Still, human rights groups say that these safeguards are inadequate and that the DOJ Task Force recommendations still allow the U.S. to send individuals to foreign countries.

<doc id="1031206" wikidata="Q321362" url="?curid=1031206" title="Pinocytosis">
<text>In cellular biology, pinocytosis, otherwise known as fluid endocytosis and bulk-phase pinocytosis, is a mode of endocytosis in which small molecules dissolved in extracellular fluid are brought into the cell through an invagination of the cell membrane, resulting in their containment within a small vesicle inside the cell. These pinocytotic vesicles then typically fuse with early endosomes to hydrolyze (break down) the particles.

Pinocytosis is variably subdivided into categories depending on the molecular mechanism and the fate of the internalized molecules.

==Function==
In humans, this process occurs primarily for absorption of fat droplets. In endocytosis the cell plasma membrane extends and folds around desired extracellular material, forming a pouch that pinches off creating an internalized vesicle. The invaginated pinocytosis vesicles are much smaller than those generated by phagocytosis. The vesicles eventually fuse with the lysosome, whereupon the vesicle contents are digested. Pinocytosis involves a considerable investment of cellular energy in the form of ATP.

===Pinocytosis and ATP===

Pinocytosis is used primarily for clearing extracellular fluids (ECF) and as part of immune surveillance. In contrast to phagocytosis, it generates very small amounts of ATP from the wastes of alternative substances such as lipids (fat). Unlike receptor-mediated endocytosis, pinocytosis is nonspecific in the substances that it does transport: the cell takes in surrounding fluids, including all solutes present.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word &quot;pinocytosis&quot; () uses combining forms of &quot;pino-&quot; + &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;, all Neo-Latin from Greek, reflecting &quot;píno&quot;, to drink, and cytosis. The term was proposed by W. H. Lewis in 1931.

==Non-specific, adsorptive pinocytosis==
Non-specific, adsorptive pinocytosis is a form of endocytosis, a process in which small particles are taken in by a cell by splitting off small vesicles from the cell membrane. Cationic proteins bind to the negative cell surface and are taken up via the clathrin-mediated system, thus the uptake is intermediate between receptor-mediated endocytosis and non-specific, non-adsorptive pinocytosis. The clathrin-coated pits occupy about 2% of the surface area of the cell and only last about a minute, with an estimated 2500 leaving the average cell surface each minute. The clathrin coats are lost almost immediately, and the membrane is subsequently recycled to the cell surface.

== Macropinocytosis ==
Macropinocytosis is a clathrin-independent endocytic mechanism that can be activated in practically all animal cells, resulting in uptake. In most cell types, it does not occur continuously but rather is induced for a limited time in response to cell-surface receptor activation by specific cargoes, including growth factors, ligands of integrins, and apoptotic cell remnants. These ligands activate a complex signaling pathway, resulting in a change in actin dynamics and the formation of cell-surface protrusions of filopodia and lamellopodia, commonly called &quot;ruffles&quot;. When ruffles collapse back onto the membrane, large fluid-filled endocytic vesicles form called macropinosomes, which can transiently increase the bulk fluid uptake of a cell by up to tenfold. Macropinocytosis is a solely degradative pathway: macropinosomes acidify and then fuse with late endosomes or endolysosomes, without recycling their cargo back to the plasma membrane.

Some bacteria and viruses have evolved to induce macropinocytosis as a mechanism for entering host cells. Some of these can stop the degradation processes in order to survive inside the macropinosome, which may transform into smaller and long-lasting vacuoles containing the viruses or bacteria (some of which may replicate inside), or simply escape through the wall of the macropinosome when inside. For example, the gut pathogen &quot;Salmonella&quot; typhimurium injects toxins into the host cell in order to induce macropinocytosis as a form of uptake, inhibits the degradation of the macropinosome, and forms a salmonella-containing vacuole, or SCV, wherein it can replicate.

<doc id="1031208" wikidata="Q1036543" url="?curid=1031208" title="Himura Kenshin">
<text>is a fictional character and the protagonist of the manga &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; created by Nobuhiro Watsuki. Kenshin&#x27;s story is set in a fictional version of Japan during the Meiji period. Kenshin is a former legendary assassin known as , more properly named . At the end of the Bakumatsu, he becomes a wandering swordsman, now wielding a —a &quot;katana&quot; that has the cutting edge on the inwardly curved side of the sword, thus being nearly incapable of killing. Kenshin wanders the Japanese countryside offering protection and aid to those in need as atonement for the murders he once committed as an assassin. In Tokyo, he meets a young woman named Kamiya Kaoru, who invites him to live in her dojo, despite learning about Kenshin&#x27;s past. Throughout the series, Kenshin begins to establish lifelong relationships with many people, including ex-enemies, while dealing with his fair share of enemies, new and old.

When creating Kenshin, Watsuki designed the androgynous and small Kenshin to be physical opposite of the bulky Hiko Seijūrō, a character that appears in his first one-shot manga, &quot;Crescent Moon in the Warring States&quot;. As a result, he was given a virile appearance with long red hair as well as cross-shaped scar in his face. He was also based on the &quot;hitokiri&quot; Kawakami Gensai. In Japanese, Kenshin has been voiced by Megumi Ogata for the drama CDs and Mayo Suzukaze for the animated adaptations. In the live-action films he was portrayed by Takeru Satoh. For the English dubs of the series, Richard Cansino voiced him in the first anime, J. Shanon Weaver replaced him for original video animation (OVA), and the duology film &quot;New Kyoto Arc&quot;. Micah Solusod did the dub for the live-action film trilogy.

Kenshin&#x27;s character was well received by fans, with his holding the top spot in all reader popularity polls for the series. Critics of the series praised his strong personality and backstory which most critics found appealing. However, though some complained about his development during the OVA series; while his role in the prequel OVAs were praised, his role in the anime-only sequel OVA series resulted in criticism by various critics including Watsuki himself. Satoh&#x27;s acting in the live-action film received positive comments due to how he fits the character as well as his fight choreography. A variety of collectibles based on Kenshin have been created, including figurines, key chains, plushies, and replicas of his &quot;sakabatō&quot; sword.

==Creation and conception==

Manga author Nobuhiro Watsuki discovered and used the story of Kawakami Gensai, a executed by the Meiji Government. Watsuki enjoys drawing Kenshin due to how he tends to sacrifice himself for others. While writing the series, once he thought Kenshin should think more about his future since he is more connected to his past. He also stated he would like to be as Kenshin but he does not believe their lives&#x27; style match. Kenshin&#x27;s morals in regards to having the strength to protect others were influenced by Miyamoto Musashi&#x27;s questions about the meaning of strength.

Ever since writing his first storyboards for the manga, Watsuki did sketches of Kenshin&#x27;s appearance and noticed that he looked like Kurama from Yoshihiro Togashi&#x27;s manga &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;. Watsuki considered himself younger back and that he preferred always drawing goodlooking men in contrast to Hiko Seijuro from a previous one-shot. When competing with these series, Watsuki felt &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; competed more with &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; that focused more on drama rather than action like &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. In contrast to the &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; young lead Yusuke Urameshi, Kenshin was written as an adult with a dark past based on the Edo period in order to make the series stand out. Nevertheless, the manga managed to compete well against other &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot; manga from the 1990s including &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot;. Kenshin&#x27;s age was also a departure from common archetypes in manga as the themes and lore in the story made him an adult in contrast to other young protagonist besides &quot;City Hunter&quot;. Nevertheless, he was careful with how writing these characters as they get old.

During the development of the series&#x27; pilot chapter, &quot;Rurouni, Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story&quot;, Watsuki and his editor argued over Kenshin&#x27;s speech patterns, settling for a &quot;slangy&quot; one. For the final version of the first &quot;Romantic Story&quot;, Watsuki adjusted the dialogue; in his view, he made Kenshin sound &quot;more as I prefer him now&quot;. Nevertheless, Kenshin was concerned about how Kenshin&#x27;s manner abruptly changed when facing his opponent. Watsuki added Kenshin&#x27;s trademark as a placeholder to be an expression of the English speech disfluency &quot;huh&quot;. Watsuki notes that he was surprised at how well it caught on, and how much he ended up having Kenshin use the sound during the series. Watsuki also planned to make Kenshin older than 30 years old; his editor commented that it was strange that the main character of a manga for teenagers to be of such an age, so he instead made him 28 years old.

Watsuki based most of Kenshin&#x27;s abilities on a real swordsman of the Tokugawa period named , who was skilled in acrobatic techniques. However, one of Kenshin&#x27;s moves where he stops an enemy&#x27;s flamethrower by rotating his sword received multiple complaints with Watsuki admitting the move as somewhat out of place and &quot;not really organic&quot; to his world. By early publication of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, Watsuki was unsure whether or not Kenshin and Kamiya Kaoru would become lovers in future chapters. Sagara Sanosuke was created to be Kenshin&#x27;s best friend who would punch him order to make him retain his composure. However, Watsuki did not think the idea worked as much as possibly. For the final fight between Kenshin and Shishio, Watsuki admitted he expressed more joy in drawing Shishio than Kenshin. During this arc and mostly the final fight between Kenshin and Shishio&#x27;s fight Watsuki kept listening to the song &quot;In The Blue Sky&quot; from the video game &quot;Virtual On&quot;; the song&#x27;s title was used in the final chapter of the Kyoto arc. Additionally, the final shot of Kenshin returning to Kaoru&#x27;s dojo was inspired by the final shot of the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; anime&#x27;s first opening theme:&quot;Sobakasu&quot; by Judy and Mary.

In the next and final arc of the manga, the story took a darker tone as most of the characters believed Kaoru was killed by Yukishiro Enishi which made Kenshin question his own way of living and escape to a village of wanderers. Watsuki did not enjoy angst in Kenshin so his friend Myōjin Yahiko took the place as the series&#x27; protagonist until Kenshin recovered. A similar dark event occurs in Kenshin&#x27;s memories involving how he accidentally killed Tomoe which the author is ashamed of for making him similar to Shishio&#x27;s murder of Komagata Yumi. In order to make Kenshin recover, Watsuki introduced Tomoe&#x27;s father, who is simply referred as &quot;Geezer&quot;, who assists him in finding an answer to atone for his sins. Once Kenshin recovered, he runs back to the city in order to save Yahiko from Enishi&#x27;s former comrade, Kujiranami Hyōgo. The fight was originally planned to last longer than the one-chapter shot but due to difficulties in drawing explosions Kujinarami made with his weapons, the fight ended with Kenshin cutting Kujinarami&#x27;s weapon. In this arc&#x27;s climax, Watsuki kept listening to the song &quot;Hurry Go Round&quot; by late musician hide which felt it suited the relationship between Enishi as well as Kenshin but in his darker persona. The author also commented he would like to have given both Kenshin and Enishi&#x27;s characters a bigger contrast. A reader also asked Watsuki whether Kenshin could defeat his rival Saitō Hajime since they never got a final duel. Watsuki responded, saying the two are equally matched but the result might depend whether or not Kenshin had something to protect.

===Design===

Like several characters, Kenshin was influenced the Shinsengumi with Kenshin being affected by Okita Sōji and Saitō Hajime in order to give him an air of mystery. According to Watsuki, when he found that Kawakami maintained a duty to his dead comrades, he decided to create the title character. Since Watsuki&#x27;s debut work contained a tall, black-haired man in &quot;showy&quot; armor, he wanted to make a character &quot;completely opposite&quot; to the debut character; the new character ended up &quot;coming out like a girl&quot;. According to Watsuki, he used &quot;no real motif&quot; when creating Kenshin and placed a cross-shaped scar on his face &quot;not knowing what else to do.&quot; During his fight against Shishio Makoto&#x27;s army, Kenshin is given a new sword with a sheath made of wood. Though it is more difficult to draw, Watsuki decided to redesign the sword to make it look like the first one Kenshin had in the series.

At the end of the series, Kenshin appears with short hair. Initially, Watsuki had planned to make his hair shorter before the end; however, he found this to be similar to the character Multi in &quot;To Heart&quot;. Additionally, Himura Kenji was introduced in the finale as the son of Kenshin and Kaoru; even though the character was &quot;cliché&quot; Watsuki felt that Kenji had to appear.

In the first &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; &quot;kanzenban&quot;, published in Japan in July 2006, Watsuki included a draft page featuring a redesign of Kenshin&#x27;s character. To make his X-shaped scar more notable, Watsuki made it long enough to cross his nose. Kenshin&#x27;s hair is tied in two tails, which are flowing to make him look younger, and shorter, and less androgynous. Watsuki also added a &quot;Habaki&quot; to Kenshin&#x27;s sword to make it easier to draw by simplifying its structure, while also emphasizing strength. Kenshin&#x27;s &quot;hitokiri&quot; look was also redesigned slightly, by making his clothes more worn and giving him Yukishiro Tomoe&#x27;s neck scarf.

===Portrayal in other works===
When the live-action of the manga was made, Watsuki had several ideas about Kenshin&#x27;s mind about his early appearances in the series. This resulted in the manga reboot &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration&quot; where Kenshin&#x27;s characterization was expanded by the author who thought in retrospective about what he could add to him. He also wrote a prequel chapter to the original series which helped the readers to understand why Kenshin would stay in Kaoru&#x27;s dojo. He challenged himself to express Kenshin&#x27;s inner feelings. Watsuki compared Kenshin&#x27;s role in the original manga to that of Kōmon in &quot;Mito Kōmon&quot; or Yoshimune&#x27;s in &quot;Abarenbō Shōgun&quot;, where the supporting characters built the drama and he was the hero who would defeat the villains. This made it easy to express the thoughts of the surrounding characters but not Kenshin&#x27;s, so he wanted to &quot;dig deeper&quot; into Kenshin this time. It turned out harder than he imagined. Although drawing it was not difficult, when he tried to make it entertaining the story got gloomier due to Kenshin&#x27;s regrets. By chapter four he got worried it would be a repeat of the Jinchū Arc of the original manga. This is when he gave up digging deeper into Kenshin&#x27;s thoughts.

Watsuki tried expressing more of Kenshin&#x27;s inner feelings in &quot;Restoration&quot;; a man who brought about a peaceful new era can not find his place because of the acts he committed in the past. He tried expressing this with the &quot;pool of blood&quot; theme. The author said this version of the character seems slightly more immature than the original because he is more reserved and excitable; &quot;perhaps he isn&#x27;t too hero-like.&quot; Watsuki changed the way &quot;Hiten Mitsurugi-ryū&quot; and its techniques are written purely for fun. The editorial office even got a phone call pointing this out. The most noticeable change in his appearance is the addition of a white scarf, &quot;scarf = hero.&quot; Watsuki also changed his cross-shaped scar; leaving it white for Kenshin, but shading it black when his &quot;Battōsai&quot; persona takes over. The author said because of the way he draws now, he struggled with Kenshin&#x27;s hair, unable to get the original bushy feeling it had until the end. Alongside &quot;Restoration&quot;, Watsuki decided to write a prequel to the original series set before Kenshin&#x27;s first meeting with Kaoru. Watsuki elaborated on the common question of &quot;Why would Kenshin, who wandered for ten years, suddenly stop in the First Act?&quot; In &quot;Act Zero&quot; an elder notices Kenshin&#x27;s unhealed emotional scar and her kind advice has a slight effect on him, becoming the motivation for his actions in the first chapter.

The fact that the original manga ended with Kenshin as a family man bothered Watsuki as he was not sure if Kenshin should fight again now that he happily married. Upon watching the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; musical, Watsuki was convinced to write &quot;Hokkaido&quot; as soon as he finished writing his recent work &quot;Embalming&quot;. In order to keep the cheerful feeling of the original series, Watsuki wrote the new characters who are nicely treated by Kenshin and Kaoru. Upon helping the staff from the live-action films, &quot;The Final&quot; and &quot;The Beginning&quot;, Watsuki came up with new ideas to give Kenshin&#x27;s story a happy ending despite his &quot;hitokiri&quot; actions. Watsuki believes that Takeru Satoh&#x27;s portrayal of the main character stands out as stronger than the manga one, most notably in &quot;The Final&quot;. He felt that Kenshin was a &quot;King Type&quot; character similar to Monkey D. Luffy from Eiichiro Oda&#x27;s &quot;One Piece&quot; as a result of how heroic they are. Watsuki also reflected on Kenshin&#x27;s pacifism which became a common trend in other heroes in &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot; protagonists like Luffy and Naruto Uzumaki who fight but are against the idea of killing their enemies while in the case of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; dead characters are often revived. He believes newer series like &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;, &quot;Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba&quot; and &quot;Jujutsu Kaisen&quot; explored more the concept of death. Nevertheless, the Kenshin Watsuki was still written for the &quot;Hokkaido Arc&quot; with the idea of sparing his enemies.

===Actors===

Watsuki received letters from fans describing Megumi Ogata&#x27;s audiobook voice as a &quot;good fit&quot; for Kenshin. Watsuki said that he imagined Kenshin&#x27;s voice to be &quot;more neutral&quot;. The fact that the audiobook voice actors, especially Ogata and Tomokazu Seki, who portrayed Sanosuke, did not voice their corresponding roles in the anime disappointed Watsuki.

In the anime adaptation of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, Watsuki&#x27;s designs were combined with the voice talents of voice actress Mayo Suzukaze. She said that she started feeling like Kenshin after years of work as his voice, but says that providing the voice for his character was one of her best experiences. In producing the English dub version of the series, Media Blasters considered following suit, with Mona Marshall considered a finalist to voice Kenshin. Richard Hayworth was eventually selected for the role, giving Kenshin&#x27;s character a more masculine voice in the English adaptation. Marshall was also selected to voice the younger Kenshin during flashback scenes. Clark Cheng, Media Blasters dub script writer, said that localizing Kenshin&#x27;s unusual speech was a difficult process. His use of &quot;de gozaru&quot; and &quot;oro&quot; were not only character trademarks that indicated his state of mind, but important elements to the story. However, neither is directly translatable into English, and in the end the company chose to replace &quot;de gozaru&quot; with &quot;that I did,&quot; &quot;that I am,&quot; or &quot;that I do.&quot; Kenshin&#x27;s signature &quot;oro&quot; was replaced with &quot;huah&quot; to simulate a &quot;funny sound&quot; that had no real meaning. Daryl Surat of &quot;Otaku USA&quot; said that the grammar in Kenshin&#x27;s dialogue in the Media Blasters dub and subtitles resemble the grammar in the dialogue of Yoda, a character in &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Saito is replacing Suzukaze with the 2023 series which appealed to him since he was a fan of the series ever since he was a child and looks forward to creating his own take.

In the live-actions films of the series, Kenshin was played Takeru Satoh. In casting Satoh, director Keishi Ōtomo said the actor was a good fit for the character, citing their physical similarities. Producer Shinzō Matsuhashi shared similar feelings as Ōtomo. During the making of this film, both Watsuki and his wife found Satoh as an ideal actor him. Watsuki was surprised by Satoh&#x27;s work as well as the special effects in the first film which made Kenshin&#x27;s character realistic. For the Kyoto duology films, Ōtomo said he did not have to put much advice to Satoh as his acting in the first film attracted multiple positive reactions by the staff and the audience. He then stated &quot;Even without saying this or that from the side, he created an image of Kenshin, including his behavior, swordplay, and speech, through the necessary preparation and hard work. So I didn’t worry at all&quot;.

During an interview, Satoh said &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; was one of the first manga he read to the point he would play sword-fights with his friends. Additionally, once he was cast as Kenshin, Satoh started intense swordsmanship training. Satoh said he liked Kenshin&#x27;s character to the point of enjoying role in the three films. However, the actor expressed pressure in doing the role as a result of having to take part in multiple fighting scenes. Nevertheless, Satoh said he enjoyed Kenshin&#x27;s lines due to the impact they have on most characters, most notably his enemies. Due to the Kyoto films showing a darker characterization of Kenshin as he struggles against different strong rivals, Satoh also said his work became more challenging. Still, he found it interesting. A scene that Satoh enjoyed was Kenshin&#x27;s fight against Sawagejō Chō due to the fact Kenshin is forced to attack his enemy even though he does not know his weapon is deadly which goes against his morals; as a result, Satoh briefly showed Kenshin&#x27;s &quot;hitokiri&quot; side for a brief moment. The actor said he discussed this scene with the director who pleased with the result. Kenshin&#x27;s strongest technique, the &quot;Amakakeru Ryū no Hirameki&quot;, was Satoh&#x27;s favorite move as he likes its meaning. While Kenshin shouts his attacks&#x27; names in both manga and anime, Satoh instead decided to say the names after performing those moves.

During shooting of the film &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: The Final&quot;, the battle between Kenshin and Enishi had to be remade several times because Satoh got exhausted of moving four times in total. Satoh praised Arata&#x27;s work as Enishi as he made the antagonist terrifying to the point the comical Kenshin acts with more tension in response to his threats which made him drop the signature sound effect &quot;Oro&quot;. Arata also praised Satoh&#x27;s works as he carried the franchise across several years in the live-action films. Watsuki believes that Takeru Satoh&#x27;s portrayal of the main character stands out as stronger than the manga one, most notably in &quot;The Final&quot;.

===In &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;===
Himura Kenshin, born is a legendary former assassin. He is a peerless swordsman who practices the , a fictional ancient sword art based on Battōjutsu, that enables him to exercise superhuman speed and reflexes, foresee his opponent&#x27;s movements in battle, as well as perform many powerful sword techniques. Most of his techniques were originally intended to be lethal, but Kenshin has since modified the use of these techniques in accordance with his vow never to kill. To this end, he fights using his &quot;sakabatō&quot; (a reverse-edge sword). After finishing his job as an assassin in the Ishin Shishi, Kenshin assumes the life of a wanderer. Ten years after the Revolution, he arrives in Tokyo, where he meets Kamiya Kaoru. She invites him to stay in her dojo even after she discovers that Kenshin is the &quot;Battōsai&quot;. Kenshin wants to protect every individual from danger without harming others. Formerly known as &quot;the strongest &quot;hitokiri&quot;,&quot; Kenshin is the main target of many old enemies and people who want to gain his title. Thus, he avoids letting others get too close to him for their own protection. However, he eventually begins to rely on his friends, allowing them to fight alongside him.

During his stay in Tokyo, Kenshin establishes lifelong relationships with many people, including ex-enemies, such as the former Shinsengumi member Saitō Hajime. Saitō&#x27;s arrival is a test ex-Ishin Shishi Ōkubo Toshimichi made in order see Kenshin&#x27;s power to see if he can defeat Shishio Makoto. Shishio is the brutal, once-successor to Kenshin&#x27;s position as Chōshū&#x27;s &quot;hitokiri&quot;, masterminds a movement seeking to overthrow the Meiji Government, Kenshin leaves Tokyo to stop him. To defeat such a foe, Kenshin is forced to resume his training and mend his relationship with his teacher Hiko Seijūrō, who taught and took care of him as a child. He learns the , which deals nine simultaneous strikes to the fundamental targets of swordsmanship. The &quot;Kuzu-ryūsen&quot;, however, is a part of the test used for the initiation in learning his strongest technique: , a &quot;battōjutsu&quot; that surpasses the speed of the &quot;Kuzu-ryūsen&quot;. Even if the technique is defeated, it can generate a vacuum in its wake and sucking the opponent in; as this happens, the body is spun around for a second stronger strike. Throughout the training, Kenshin increasingly wants to survive to any combat so that Kaoru will not be shocked by his death. After finishing his training, Kenshin&#x27;s friends reunite with him and help him defeat Shishio and his army.

Months later, a man known as Yukishiro Enishi starts attacking all the people Kenshin meets as an act of revenge for the death of his sister Yukishiro Tomoe. At this point, it is revealed that Kenshin was married to Tomoe in the Bakumatsu, but accidentally killed her while trying to rescue her from a group of assassins. When Enishi learns of Kenshin&#x27;s feelings towards Kaoru, he sets out to kidnap her. He succeeds and leaves behind a professionally made decoy of Kaoru with a sword in her heart, making everyone believe that she has been murdered. Kenshin falls into a severe depression and runs off to a village of outcasts to mourn. After a while, he is forced to stand up and fight upon learning one his friend is in danger, returning to his former self in the process. Meanwhile, his friends discover Kaoru is alive. The group goes to rescue her on Enishi&#x27;s island. A battle between Kenshin and Enishi follows. When Kenshin wins, he and Kaoru return home. Afterwards, Kenshin learns that since the &quot;Hiten Mitsurugi-ryū&quot; is only suitable for a wide-framed muscular build like that of Seijūrō&#x27;s, his body will eventually begin to deteriorate and he will soon be unable to use it again. Five years later, Kenshin is married to Kaoru and has a son named Kenji. After an encounter with Kaoru&#x27;s student Myōjin Yahiko, Kenshin gives his &quot;sakabatō&quot; to him as a gift for his coming-of-age.

===In other media===
====Printed works====
Kenshin first appeared in two chapters of &quot;Rurouni, Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story&quot;, the pilot chapters of the manga, in which he arrives in Tokyo and defeats several groups of villains attacking families. In these stories, Kenshin is given a similar personality to the one he has in the series, but his name is not mentioned. Following the original series&#x27; ending, Watsuki wrote two shorts where Kenshin makes brief appearances; in &quot;Yahiko no Sabato&quot; Kenshin and Kaoru entrust Yahiko with taking care of a dojo whereas in &quot;Haru ni Sakura&quot; he reunites with all his friends and learn about the place where Saito left and learn of his friend Sagara Sanosuke through a letter after he left Japan.

The manga&#x27;s reboot, &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration&quot;, follows Kenshin&#x27;s stay in Tokyo as in the original series. After attacking a drug dealer known as Takeda Kanryu, Kenshin becomes the target of many of his warriors. This leads to a fight against his old enemy Jin-e from the Shinsengumi who tries to encourage his &quot;hitokiri&quot; be reborn by using Kaoru as a hostage and nearly killing her. However, as Kenshin is about kill Jin-e, Kaoru stops him; following Jin-e&#x27;s suicide, Kenshin stays in Kaoru&#x27;s dojo. Before the reboot, Watsuki also wrote a prequel chapter where Kenshin meets a western doctor during his years of wandering.

In 2016, Watsuki wrote a sidestory named &quot;The Ex-Con Ashitaro&quot; in which Kenshin appears to save the young title character from a group of enemies. Shueisha later revealed &quot;Ashitaro&quot; is the prequel to an upcoming from &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;: the Hokkaido Arc. In the &quot;Hokkaido arc&quot;, Kenshin&#x27;s group learns that Kaoru&#x27;s father is alive and decide to go to Hokkaido to find him. Yahiko returns Kenshin his &quot;sakabato&quot; to aid him in possible fights but Kenshin&#x27;s stamina keeps reaching its limit when fighting. Although Kenshin is primarily interested in finding Kaoru&#x27;s father, he learns from Saito&#x27;s adopted son Mishima Eiji of a new threat in Hokkaido who aim to conquer Japan rather than westernize the country. For this purpose, Saito calls Shishio&#x27;s surviving allies and one Shinsengumi, Nagakura Shinpachi, to aid them in the battle. Sanosuke also returns to aid Kenshin in the battle.

In 2021, Watsuki created the manga that shows the first time Kenshin used his sakabatō.

====Other works====
In the 1997 movie &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: The Motion Picture&quot;, Kenshin meets a samurai named Takimi Shigure, who tries to overthrow the Meiji Government and avenge the deaths of his family during the Bakumatsu. Kenshin encounters Shigure and defeats him to avoid the start of a war while avenging one of his friends killed by Kenshin in the past. However, he fails to bring his fight give a peaceful resolution as Shigure&#x27;s own men betray him and several of his soldiers die alongside him.

In the OVAs of the series, &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Trust &amp; Betrayal&quot; from 1999, Kenshin&#x27;s life in the Bakumatsu is explored.

He decides to wander again, and Kaoru strongly supports him, promising to welcome him home with a smile and their child. Kenshin eventually becomes ravaged by an unknown disease. However, he decides to assist in the First Sino-Japanese War as he had promised the Meiji Government. After the war&#x27;s end, Sanosuke discovers a gravely injured Kenshin on the shore, who has lost his memory and cannot return to Japan. Sanosuke arranges for Kenshin&#x27;s return to Tokyo and Kaoru. The two finally meet, and Kenshin collapses into her arms as he clutches her. Kaoru then notices Kenshin&#x27;s scar has faded away, signifying his death. After watching the last OVA, Nobuhiro Watsuki was quite unhappy with how the story ended, saying that &quot;Kenshin went through so much crap and deserved a happy ending.&quot;

Kenshin also appears in other animated retelling of the series titled &quot;New Kyoto Arc&quot; from 2011 and 2012.

In the live-action movie trilogy, Kenshin is portrayed by Takeru Satoh. The first film retells Kenshin&#x27;s arrival to Tokyo while making new allies and enemies whereas the second and the third ones from 2014 show his fight against Shishio&#x27;s forces. &quot;The Final&quot; focuses on his fight against Enishi&#x27;s forces while &quot;The Beginning&quot; focuses on his past as a &quot;hitokiri&quot; and meeting with Tomoe.

Kenshin is a playable character in all of the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; video games, as well as the crossovers &quot;Jump Super Stars&quot; and &quot;Jump Ultimate Stars&quot;. In June 2013, Kenshin was confirmed to be a playable character alongside &quot;Bleach&quot;″s protagonist Ichigo Kurosaki in &quot;J-Stars Victory Vs&quot; for the PlayStation 3. In celebrating the 50th anniversary of the magazine &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot;, a cardgame was developed by Bandai Namco Entertainment with Kenshin appearing as a character card.

It was announced in November 2018 that Kenshin Himura along with Shishio Makoto would be playable characters in the &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; cross-over video game&quot;, Jump Force,&quot; developed by Bandai Namco Entertainment. Teppei Koike also portrays Kenshin in the Kyoto arc musical and has expressed joy of doing it, having read the manga when he was younger.

==Reception==
===Popularity===
Kenshin has been highly popular with the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; reader base, having ranked first in every &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; popularity poll of the series, always with more than double the votes of the second place character. Two polls by the official &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; anime featured Kenshin as one of the series&#x27; most popular characters. In the first, Kenshin was at the top, while in the second, he placed second. His Battōsai incarnation was also fifth in the latter poll. Kenshin has also been featured various times in the &quot;Animage&quot;″s Anime Grand Prix polls, ranking as one of the most popular male anime characters. In a &quot;Newtype&quot; poll in March 2010, Kenshin was voted the eighth most popular male anime character from the 1990s. An abundance of merchandise have been released in Kenshin&#x27;s likeness including keychains, action figures, and plush dolls. Since the manga was published, non-functional and functional &quot;sakabatō&quot; have been produced for purchase by collectors and fans. In a poll by Anime News Network, Kenshin was voted as the second best male anime character with long hair, being surpassed by Edward Elric from &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot;. In 2014, IGN ranked him as the fifth greatest anime character of all time, saying that: &quot;Although Kenshin&#x27;s momentary lapses make him a complete badass and set the stage for some of the most epic sword battles ever animated, Kenshin always goes back to his sweet persona once the danger is gone.&quot; Kenshin was also fifth in IGN&#x27;s Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time with writer Chris Mackenzie describing him as: &quot;A classic example of a classic anime type, the peace-loving killing machine.&quot; Kenshin&#x27;s &quot;Amakakeru Ryū no Hirameki&quot; technique has ranked third in a Japanese survey that featured the most popular moves in manga and anime. In a poll by Anime News Network, he was voted as the top &quot;guy&quot;. In a Japanese TV special from August 2017, Kenshin was voted as the 16th &quot;strongest hero&quot; from the Showa Era as well as the 15th one from the Heisei Era.

Serdar Yegulalp from ThoughtCo. also listed the series as one of the &quot;Best anime romances&quot; with a bigger focus on Kenshin and Kaoru. For the 9th Asian Film Awards, Satoh was nominated in the &quot;Best Actor&quot; category for his portrayal of Kenshin. In the Japan Action Awards 2012, Satoh also won an award in the category &quot;Best Action Actor&quot;.

===Critical reception===
Several publications covering manga, anime, video games, and other media have praised and criticized the character. Tasha Robinson from SciFi.com remarked &quot;Kenshin&#x27;s schizoid personal conflict between his ruthless-killer side and his country-bumpkin&quot; side was a perfect way to develop good stories which was one of the factors that made the series popular. Marco Oliveier from the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University said that the sakabatō symbolises Kenshin&#x27;s oath not to kill again which has been found challenging by other warriors. According to Ashley D. Lake from UC Riverside, Kaoru represents the Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu values defied in the &quot;Meiji era&quot; that Kenshin chooses to protect due to the values it offers to people, something rare in anime series due to prominent violence during the time &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; premiered in Japan. Megan Lavey from Mania Entertainment highly praised Kenshin&#x27;s characterization in the manga due to his seriousness as well how he intends to tell his friends his feelings contrasting some episodes from the anime where Kenshin is more comical. Lavey also highly praised the fight between Kenshin and Saito Hajime in the manga&#x27;s seventh volume and Kenshin&#x27;s killing intent displayed against his rival. Similarly, his first fight against Saito in the anime adaptation earned high praise by Anime News Network writer Mark A. Grey considering one of the best ones from the series. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; found comical how whenever Kenshin is not fighting he is doing the laundry or cleans the dojo which brings a light tone that appealed the writer. T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews website criticized Kenshin&#x27;s super deformed appearance in comedy scenes claiming it does not suit the context of the character or the series. Mania.com remarks that Kenshin has a &quot;smartass&quot; attitude in a review of volume 8; while they noted that is a common attitude in the anime that makes him look out-of-character. Anime News Network&#x27;s Mike Crandol praised Kenshin for being a character that all people enjoy watching due to his comedy scenes. compared Kenshin to Musashi Miyamoto from &quot;Vagabond&quot; due to their relationship with historical figures rarely explored in manga. In About.com&#x27;s Top 8 Anime Love Stories, Kenshin and Kaoru&#x27;s relationship ranked 8th with Katherine Luther noting it is a &quot;classic romance.&quot; Bamboo Dong from Anime News Network highly criticized Kenshin in the OVA&#x27;s retelling of the Kyoto arc for lacking all the development he faced in both the manga and anime of this arc.

For Sony&#x27;s OVAs of the franchise, there have also been multiple response. Matthew Anderson from DVD Vision Japan found the series&#x27; title &quot;Samurai X&quot; unfitting for Kenshin as the reviewer regarded the character as a hired killer rather than as a samurai as seen across the prequel OVAs. Rio Yañez from &quot;Animerica&quot; said one of the major themes of &quot;Trust&quot; is understanding the repercussions and after-effects murder can have, something that Kenshin has yet to comprehend though others have tried to point it out to him. Mike Crando from Anime News Network highly enjoyed Kenshin&#x27;s characterization in the prequel as he refers it as &quot;it is a fascinating and emotional character study in its own right&quot; due to Kenshin&#x27;s character development across these four episodes from &quot;an idealistic youth to a cold-hearted killer, only to be redeemed through love lost and the realization that swinging his sword is destroying his own life as well as the lives of the people on the receiving end&quot;. Additionally, the reviewer enjoyed the OVA&#x27;s director&#x27;s cut for showing more fights between Kenshin and Shinsenguimi, the special forces where Saito originated from. Earl Cressey from DVD Talk found Kenshin as a &quot;complex&quot; character and said his relationship with Yukishiro Tomoe might appeal the viewers. Carlos Ross from T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews shared similar feelings and enjoyed the romance between Kenshin Tomoe despite its tragic outcome. Yegulalp from ThoughtCo. also listed the series as one of the &quot;Best anime romances&quot; with a bigger focus on Kenshin and Tomoe.

Kenshin&#x27;s development in the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Reflection&quot; OVA series has received negative reviews by many publications. Anime News Network also adds that in &quot;Reflection&quot; he &quot;continues to be his old mopey self&quot; and criticizes the fact that he never says &quot;oro&quot;, while IGN felt that some moments of the relationship between Kenshin and Kaoru were depressing. While criticizing the characters&#x27; sad decisions, Serdar Yegulalp from About.com wondered whether the OVAs had to make viewers accept Kenshin&#x27;s death wish after so much time of wandering and feeling a mortal disease. However, some reviewers noted Kenshin&#x27;s personality in the OVAs was one of the most complex ever to be animated remarking on the fact that he can not forget his bloody past, despite having a peaceful life. Don Houston from DVD Talk noted the controversy between the fandom as they refrained from treating &quot;Reflection&quot; as canon due to how tragic the life of Kenshin&#x27;s family became. Ridwan Khan from Animefringe shared similar feelings, but noted Kenshin had no new enemies to fight after Enishi, leaving him with his disease story arc.

Besides the printed series and its animated adaptations, there have been comments regarding Kenshin&#x27;s role in the live-action films where he is played by Takeru Satoh] Deborah Young from &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; comically compared the character to Michael Jackson but praised his portrayal of swordsmanship. Matt Schley from &quot;Otaku USA&quot; commented that Satoh did a good performance making Kenshin into likeable protagonist. Both Nick Creamer and Ko Ransom from Anime News Network shared similar opinions, noting Satoh managed to adapt the character well. Schley once again praised Satoh&#x27;s role in the finale alongside other actors. For the last movie, Creamer expressed that Satoh kept doing a fine work as acting as Kenshin, praising his battles like Young. While enjoying the final duel between Kenshin and Shishio Makoto, Hayley Scanlon from UK Anime Network felt it took too much screentime. Lito B. Zulueta from The Enquirer also enjoyed the fight between Kenshin and Shishio, the actors, as well as how the character of Kenshin has helped popularized the term of samurai in western culture. David West from &quot;Neo&quot; criticized Kenshin&#x27;s long training with his teacher but still found that in the film, Kenshin&#x27;s vow of not killing anybody remains true. Satoh&#x27;s action sequences from &quot;The Final&quot; and his rivalry with Enishi were also the subject of praise. Meanwhile, the younger Kenshin from &quot;The Beginning&quot; shocked critics for how coldhearted he is in his assassin works during the Bakumatsu but changes into a more peaceful person when meeting Tomoe. In retrospect, F. Liu from International Journal of Education and Humanities noticed that the accidental murder of Tomoe caused the awakening of the protagonist&#x27;s wiser personality as he realized the horrible actions he has been causing leading to his transformation into a wanderer once the &quot;Bakumatsu&quot; ends, abandoning his bushido and becoming more benevolent in the process.

In &quot;The Renegotiation of Modernity&quot;, Kenshin&#x27;s heroic nature as a wanderer was compared to both Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter due to how he wishes to protect the weak people, seeing nothing wrong with such trait as heavily explored in the series when confronting the young Seta Sojiro who had opposite values in terms how should the strong men act. This soft masculinity exemplified. also in the balance between Kenshin&#x27;s supernatural strength and small design, led a major impact in the audience due to how likable the protagonist is. His introduction marks his values with the sword which also affected Kaoru, Yahiko&#x27;s and Sanosuke&#x27;s values upon their meetings. In doing so, &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; laid&quot; more than twenty years ago the foundation of a fresh paradigm of humanity based on tenderness and mutual acceptance as a counter-movement to the individualism, competition and efficiency that characterize the project of modernity&quot;.

<text>A dependent clause, also known as a subordinate clause, subclause or embedded clause, is a certain type of clause that juxtaposes an independent clause within a complex sentence. For instance, in the sentence &quot;I know Bette is a dolphin&quot;, the clause &quot;Bette is a dolphin&quot; occurs as the complement of the verb &quot;know&quot; rather than as a freestanding sentence. Subtypes of dependent clauses include content clauses, relative clauses, adverbial clauses, and clauses that complement an independent clause in the subjunctive mood.

==Content clause==

A content clause, also known as a &quot;noun clause&quot;, provides content implied or commented upon by its main clause. It can be a subject, predicate nominative, direct object, appositive, indirect object, or object of the preposition. Some of the English words that introduce content clauses are &quot;that, who&quot; (and formal &quot;whom&quot;), &quot;whoever&quot; (and formal &quot;whomever&quot;), &quot;whether, why, what, how, when&quot;, and &quot;where&quot;. Notice that some of these words also introduce relative and adverbial clauses. A clause is a content clause if a pronoun (&quot;he, she, it,&quot; or &quot;they&quot;) could be substituted for it.

Examples: 
*I know &quot;who said that&quot;. (I know them. The dependent clause serves as the object of the main-clause verb &quot;know&quot;.)
*&quot;Whoever made that assertion&quot; is wrong. (They are wrong. The dependent clause serves as the subject of the main clause.)

In English, in some instances the subordinator &quot;that&quot; can be omitted.

Example 1:
*I know &quot;that he is here.&quot;
*I know &quot;he is here&quot;.

Example 2:
*I think &quot;that it is pretty&quot;. (less common)
*I think &quot;it is pretty&quot;. (more common)

==Relative (adjectival) clause==

In Indo-European languages, a relative clause, also called an adjectival clause or an adjective clause, meets three requirements:
#Like all dependent clauses, it contains a verb (and also a subject unless it is a non-finite dependent clause). However, in a pro-drop language the subject may be a zero pronoun: the pronoun may not be explicitly included because its identity is conveyed by a verbal inflection.
#It begins with a relative adverb [&quot;when, where&quot;, &quot;how&quot;, or &quot;why&quot; in English] or a relative pronoun [&quot;who, whom, whose, that, what&quot; or &quot;which&quot; in English]. However, the English relative pronoun (other than &quot;what&quot;) may be omitted and only implied if it plays the role of the object of the verb or object of a preposition in a restrictive clause; for example, &quot;He is the boy I saw&quot; is equivalent to &quot;He is the boy whom I saw&quot;, and &quot;I saw the boy you are talking about&quot; is equivalent to the more formal &quot;I saw the boy about whom you are talking&quot;.
#The relative clause functions as an adjective, answering questions such as &quot;what kind?&quot;, &quot;how many?&quot; or &quot;which one?&quot;

The adjective clause in English will follow one of these patterns:

*Relative Pronoun [Functioning as Object of Verb] + Subject + Verb
:This is the ball &quot;that&quot; I was bouncing.

*Relative Pronoun [Functioning as Object of Verb] (Omitted but Implied) + Subject + Verb
:This is the ball I was bouncing.

*Relative Adverb + Subject + Verb (possibly + Object of Verb)
:That is the house &quot;where&quot; I grew up.
:That is the house &quot;where&quot; I met her.

*Relative Pronoun [Functioning as Subject] + Verb (possibly + Object of Verb)
:That is the person &quot;who&quot; hiccuped.
:That is the person &quot;who&quot; saw me.

*Relative Pronoun [Functioning as Object of Preposition] + Subject + Verb (possibly + Object of Verb) + Preposition
:That is the person &quot;who(m)&quot; I was talking about.
:That is the person &quot;who(m)&quot; I was telling you about.

*Preposition + Relative Pronoun [Functioning as Object of Preposition] + Subject + Verb (possibly + Object of Verb)
:That is the person about &quot;whom&quot; I was talking.
:That is the person about &quot;whom&quot; I was telling you.

*Possessive Relative Pronoun + Noun [Functioning as Subject] + Verb (possibly + Object of Verb)
:That is the dog &quot;whose&quot; big brown eyes pleaded for another cookie.
:That is the dog &quot;whose&quot; big brown eyes begged me for another cookie.

*Possessive Relative Pronoun + Noun [Functioning as Object of Verb] + Subject + Verb
:That is the person &quot;whose&quot; car I saw.

For a discussion of adjective clauses in languages other than English, see Relative clause#Examples.

===Punctuation===
====English punctuation====
The punctuation of an adjective clause depends on whether it is essential (restrictive) or nonessential (nonrestrictive) and uses commas accordingly. Essential clauses are not set off with commas; nonessential clauses are. An adjective clause is essential if the information it contains is necessary to the meaning of the sentence:

*The vegetables &quot;that people often leave uneaten&quot; are usually the most nutritious.

The word &quot;vegetables&quot; is non-specific. Accordingly, for the reader to know which are being mentioned, one must have the information provided in the adjective clause (in italics). Because it restricts the meaning of &quot;vegetable&quot;, the adjective clause is called a restrictive clause. It is essential to the meaning of the main clause and uses no commas (and so does not experience a pause when spoken).

However, if the additional information does not help to identify more narrowly the identity of the noun antecedent but rather simply provides further information about it, the adjective clause is nonrestrictive and so requires commas (or a spoken pause) to separate it from the rest of the sentence:

*Broccoli, &quot;which people often leave uneaten&quot;, is very nutritious.

Depending on context, a particular noun could be modified by either a restrictive or nonrestrictive adjective clause. For example, while &quot;broccoli&quot; is modified nonrestrictively in the preceding sentence, it is modified restrictively in the following.

*The broccoli &quot;which (&quot;or&quot; that) people leave uneaten&quot; is often nutritious.

==Adverbial clause==

&quot;He saw Mary &quot;when he was in New York&quot;&quot; and &quot;They studied hard &quot;because they had a test&quot;&quot; both contain adverbial clauses (in italics). Adverbial clauses express &quot;when, why, where, opposition&quot;, and &quot;conditions&quot;, and, as with all dependent clauses, they cannot stand alone. For example, &quot;When he was in New York&quot; is not a complete sentence; it needs to be completed by an independent clause, as in:

*He went to the Guggenheim Museum &quot;when he was in New York.&quot;

or equivalently

*&quot;When he was in New York&quot;, he went to the Guggenheim Museum.

==Sentence structure==
A &quot;complex sentence&quot; contains an independent clause and at least one dependent clause. A sentence with two or more independent clauses plus (one or more) dependent clauses is referred to as a &quot;compound-complex sentence&quot;. (Every clause contains a subject and predicate.) Here are some English examples:

My sister cried &quot;because she scraped her knee&quot;. (complex sentence)
*Subjects: My sister, she
*Predicates: cried, scraped her knee
*Subordinating conjunction: because

&quot;When they told me&quot; &quot;(that) I won the contest&quot;, I cried, but I didn&#x27;t faint. (compound-complex sentence)
*Subjects: they, I, I, I
*Predicates: told me, won the contest, cried, didn&#x27;t faint
*Subordinating conjunctions: when, that (implied or understood)
*Coordinating conjunction: but

This sentence contains two dependent clauses: &quot;When they told me&quot;, and &quot;(that) I won the contest&quot;, the latter which serves as the object of the verb &quot;told&quot;. The connecting word &quot;that&quot;, if not explicitly included, is understood to implicitly precede &quot;I won&quot; and in either case functions as a subordinating conjunction. This sentence also includes two independent clauses, &quot;I cried&quot; and &quot;I didn&#x27;t faint&quot;, connected by the coordinating conjunction &quot;but&quot;. The first dependent clause, together with its object (the second dependent clause), adverbially modifies the verbs of both main clauses.

==Non-finite dependent clauses==

Dependent clauses may be headed by an infinitive, gerund, or other non-finite verb form, which in linguistics is called deranked. For instance:

* Sit up straight &quot;while singing.&quot;

In these cases, the subject of the dependent clause may take a non-nominative form. An example is:

* I want &quot;him to vanish.&quot;

<text>In traditional grammar, an independent clause (or main clause) is a clause that can stand by itself as a &quot;simple sentence&quot;. An independent clause contains a subject and a predicate and makes sense by itself.

Independent clauses can be joined by using a semicolon or by using a comma followed by a coordinating conjunction (&quot;and&quot;, &quot;but&quot;, &quot;for&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;nor&quot;, &quot;so&quot;, &quot;yet&quot;, etc.).

==Examples==
In the following example sentences, independent clauses are underlined, and conjunctions are in bold.

Single independent clauses:
*I have enough money to buy an ice cream cone.
*My favourite flavour is chocolate.
*Let&#x27;s go to the shop.
Multiple independent clauses:
*I have enough money to buy an ice cream cone; my favourite flavour is chocolate.
*I have enough money to buy an ice cream cone, so let&#x27;s go to the shop.

<doc id="1031225" wikidata="Q4051345" url="?curid=1031225" title="The Varsity (restaurant)">
<text>The Varsity is a restaurant chain in Atlanta, Georgia. The main branch of the chain was the largest drive-in fast food restaurant in the world, taking up two city blocks and accommodating up to 800 diners. The main location ended car-side service in 2020. There are now six other branches across metropolitan Atlanta.

==History==
Originally named &quot;The Yellow Jacket&quot;, The Varsity was established in 1928 at the corner of Luckie Street and Hemphill Avenue in Midtown Atlanta. Its founder, Frank Gordy of Thomaston, Georgia, a Reinhardt University graduate, briefly attended The Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), studying industrial management. Popular legend states that Gordy dropped out, but according to Janice McDonald, he actually transferred to Oglethorpe College. As the business grew, Gordy was forced to move the restaurant to 61 North Avenue (on the northwest corner of Spring Street). To accommodate the crowds, the present structure now covers two city blocks. It was here that the name was changed to &quot;The Varsity,&quot; reflecting his desire to expand to other college campuses. During the drive-in era, The Varsity began its curbside service. The Atlanta location ceased offering curbside service in July 2020 but later reintroduced it in September of that year, in modified form.

The current location in Atlanta is now adjacent to the Downtown Connector&#x27;s interchange with North Avenue. When that freeway (now I-75/85) was built by GDOT, it took out several blocks of Williams Street and much of The Varsity&#x27;s western parking lot, forcing a parking garage to be erected as a replacement. The restaurant and the Georgia Tech campus sit on opposite sides of the Connector, linked by the North Avenue bridge.

The enterprise has since expanded all around the state of Georgia. They include the cities of Bethlehem, Cartersville, Dawsonville, Kennesaw, Norcross, and Rome. Former Varsity locations include the cities of Athens and Alpharetta. The first Athens location opened in 1932 at the corner of East Broad Street and College Avenue, but was closed around the late 1970s. Another Athens location opened further west on West Broad Street near Milledge Avenue in the 1960s. The latter location for demolition in 2021. The Varsity location in Athens closed in June 2021, though the company hinted that it might return to Athens. The Alpharetta location closed on February 1, 2016, as it had become unprofitable, and the building has since been demolished. In 2023, a new Varsity opened in Bethlehem. During that same year, construction for a location in Rome began. Although it was supposed to be open by the end of the year, it is still under construction as of March 2024.

The Varsity, Jr., located in northeast Atlanta, was the only other location of the chain to offer curbside service. The Varsity, Jr. closed in August 2010, having been at that location for more than 40 years, after the city of Atlanta did not approve the chain&#x27;s plans to replace that building. The plans for the new Varsity, Jr. were instead used for the new location in Dawsonville. The restaurant offers catering services to the metro Atlanta region for both corporate and non-corporate functions, going as far east as Conyers and Stone Mountain, Georgia.

There is also a mini-Varsity on the campus of Reinhardt University in Waleska, Georgia. Frank Gordy met his wife, Evelyn, at Reinhardt in 1924 and went on to Georgia Tech to finish his education. Their custom-designed home was later moved from Atlanta to the Reinhardt University campus. The Gordy family gave part of their land to Cobb County for what is now the Mountain View campus of Chattahoochee Technical College and the Mountain View Aquatics Center, the rest was sold in the 1990s for upscale tract housing and strip malls. Gordy Parkway, a loop named for Frank Gordy, serves all of these.

===Culture===


One of the best-known employees at the Varsity was Erby Walker, who worked there for 45 years until he died in 2008. He started at the Varsity at the age of 15 sweeping floors, and was nearly fired on the first day, but soon graduated to the kitchen. Mr. Walker was noted for his ability to move the service line quickly, especially during the rush period right before a Georgia Tech football game. His signature catchphrase was, &quot;Have your money out and your food on your mind, and I&#x27;ll getcha to the game on time!&quot; He retired in 2003, but came back three weeks later. That year Walker was inducted into the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau Hospitality Hall of Fame.

Comedian Nipsey Russell began his entertainment career at The Varsity in the 1940s as a carhop. The creative and resourceful Russell would dress in a flamboyant style and pepper his order-taking duties with jokes and amusing songs, thereby earning him extra tips. U.S. presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama all visited The Varsity during their terms in office. &quot;Mad&quot; artist Jack Davis has done advertising for The Varsity.

The Varsity was featured in the PBS documentary &quot;A Hot Dog Program&quot; by Rick Sebak. It also appeared in the movie &quot;We Are Marshall&quot; while the coaches are recruiting players.

===Service===
The Varsity bills itself as &quot;The World’s Largest Drive-in Restaurant.&quot; According to the Atlanta History Center, The Varsity receives over 30,000 people on days when a football game is playing. The restaurant receives several more visitors during Supercross Saturday and on Saturdays in July in general.

In 1996, The Varsity stated that it served over 5,000 fried fruit pies, two miles of hotdogs, 300 gallons of chili, 2,500 pounds of potatoes and 2,000 pounds of onions every day. It also described itself as the largest seller of Coca-Cola in the world. In 1998, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; reported that the restaurant sold over 12,000 hotdogs a day and could deliver over 1,000 hotdogs a minute via conveyor belt. In August 2018, &quot;Garden &amp; Gun&quot; reported that the restaurant could manufacture up to 2,400 fried fruit pies an hour.

They have a location at the Atlanta airport. You can’t use cash there.

<text>The Montreal Royales were one of eight teams in the short-lived Canadian Baseball League (2003 only). The Royales of the CBL, unrelated to the Montreal Royals of 1939–1960, were strictly a road team which never succeeded in obtaining a &quot;home&quot; field in the Montreal area to play, despite several efforts to negotiate one. All nine of their home games were played in neutral cities such as Sherbrooke (Amedée Roy Stadium). The Royales finished their season at the bottom of their division with a 10-22 record.

<text>Black Cat, White Cat () is a 1998 Serbian romantic black comedy film directed by Emir Kusturica. It won the Silver Lion for Best Direction at the Venice Film Festival.

The literal translation of the title is actually &quot;Black , white &quot;. The movie characters speak in Romani, Serbian, and Bulgarian frequently switching among them.

==Plot==
Matko Destanov, a small-time Romani smuggler and profiteer, lives with his teenage son Zare in a ramshackle house by the Danube River in eastern Serbia near the Bulgarian border. He has plans to steal a whole train of smuggled fuel. To obtain a loan that would subsidize the heist, he visits Grga Pitić, a wheelchair-using old gangster, who is an old friend of Zarije Destanov, Matko&#x27;s father and Zare&#x27;s grandfather. Matko plots the details of the job with an ally named Dadan, a rich, fun-living, drug-snorting gangster who has a harem, juggles grenades, and cheats at gambling. However, Dadan double-crosses him and glitches up the deal by giving Matko a drink that is drugged, and carrying out the job while Matko is unconscious. Matko is unable to repay his loan, so Dadan makes a deal whereby he would forgive the debt if Zare marries Afrodita, Dadan&#x27;s dwarf sister. However, Zare (17) is in love with Ida (26), a barmaid who works in an establishment run by her Roma grandmother Sujka, and Afrodita is waiting for the man of her dreams. Dadan coerces Afrodita into marrying by dunking her in a well, while Zare first learns of the scheme to marry him off from Ida, who has overheard Dadan and Matko plotting it in the restaurant where she works. Meanwhile, Zare retrieves Zarije from the hospital where he is being kept, with the aid of a gypsy band. Grga Pitić is having problems of his own, as he wants his grandsons, including the 2.00m giant Grga Veliki, to get married.

The two reluctantly endure the wedding ceremony held at Matko&#x27;s house, which Dadan refuses to postpone despite the sudden apparent death of Zarije. They were not supposed to have a wedding while in mourning, but Dadan decides to delay the death announcement, so Matko and Zare hide Zarije&#x27;s body in the attic, packed in ice. Ida and Sujka provide the catering for the wedding, and Ida is upset at seeing her beloved married to someone else. However, the bride runs away mid-ceremony, pursued by Dadan, Matko and Dadan&#x27;s criminal cronies. Meanwhile, Grga Veliki is driving his father and brother to Matko&#x27;s house so that they may visit Zarije&#x27;s grave (Grga Pitić and Zarije old friends). The fleeing bride stumbles across Grga Veliki, and the couple fall instantly in love. Grga Pitić arrives on the scene, after his wheelchair had fallen out the back of the truck and rolled downhill, and he is delighted that Grga Veliki has found his mate. The old gangster forces Dadan, who had once worked for him, to accept the match.

The groom conspires with Sujka and Ida to bring Dadan down a peg, and rigs the outhouse so that the seat will come apart. While the preparations for the wedding ceremony of Afrodita and Grga Veliki are being conducted, Matko and Dadan pass the time by playing dice, with Dadan cheating. Sujka comes in during the game, and serves the unsuspecting Dadan a drink spiked with a laxative. Grga Pitić apparently dies, and Dadan and Matko hide his body in the attic, where Zarije&#x27;s body is also hidden. However, the two corpses soon both come back to life; they were not dead after all. They are surprised to find themselves together, as they had not seen each other for 25 years and each had thought the other was dead. During the ceremony, Dadan starts to feel uncomfortable and rushes into the outhouse, only to fall into the manure. His harem and cronies desert him, and as he tries to clean himself off on a goose, only Matko remains loyal, and he provides Dadan with a shower from the garden hose. Zare grabs the wedding official at gunpoint and orders him to solemnize his marriage with his sweetheart, Ida, and the two sail off together on a riverboat set for Bulgaria with a fistful of cash stashed in his grandfather&#x27;s accordion, the blessing of their respective grandparents and, as witnesses, a black cat and a white cat.

==Production==
In the aftermath of the worldwide success, as well as the controversy of his previous feature, Palme d&#x27;Or-winning &quot;Underground&quot;, Kusturica was so hurt by the aggressive criticism coming from several French intellectuals that he publicly announced his retirement from movies at the age of 41.

He later changed his mind, deciding to come back with a project on Gypsy music which he originally envisioned as a documentary with a working title &quot;Musika Akrobatika&quot;. The idea further evolved and Kusturica decided to add narrative flourishes of his own, so &quot;Musika Akrobatika&quot; got transformed into a fictional feature &quot;Black Cat, White Cat&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Black Cat, White Cat&quot; received a positive response from critics, garnering an 83% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 35 reviews with an average score of 7.1/10. The site’s critics consensus reads, &quot;Rambling and eccentric, Emir Kusturica&#x27;s comedy captures the life and energy of the Gypsy family at the heart of the tale.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote a positive review, summing the film up as &quot;a mad scramble through the Felliniesque realm of Mr. Kusturica&#x27;s imagination&quot;. She further praised Srđan Todorović&#x27;s portrayal of Dadan Karambolo as &quot;a repetitive but irresistible turn&quot; before concluding that &quot;Mr. Kusturica so evidently adores all of the film&#x27;s other characters that &quot;Black Cat, White Cat&quot; becomes a wild, warts-and-all celebration of their lives and like Fellini, Kusturica finds true grace where it&#x27;s least expected and makes films utterly, uncompromisingly his own&quot;.

In his review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Kevin Thomas refers to the film as a &quot;raucous, knockabout comedy, a paean to love, freedom and friendship&quot;, before concluding that despite being two hours and nine minutes long, &quot;Black Cat, White Cat&quot; &quot;gets away with it better than most over-long movies due to its beguiling rambling shaggy dog-story quality.&quot;

In a generally positive review, J. Hoberman of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; refers to the film as &quot;bravura moviemaking by any objective standard&quot; and a &quot;vehicle for the director&#x27;s lowdown magic-realist fantasies about Romany gangsters, which has a velocity that belies its jerry-built mise-en-scène&quot; concluding that &quot;&quot;Black Cat, White Cat&quot; is determined to twist every character into an ideogram for vulgar humanity&quot; while wondering if &quot;these gypsies are a screen on which the Bosnian-born director can project his own feelings of ostracism and homelessness&quot;.

&quot;Salon&quot;&#x27;s Andrew O&#x27;Hehir wrote a positive review, describing the film as &quot;manic, carnivalesque, and treating death as a minor (and temporary) inconvenience&quot; and commends &quot;Kusturica&#x27;s convincing portrayal of his homeland as a social and architectural ruin, where everything is either falling apart or overbuilt in misbegotten grandiosity&quot;. O&#x27;Hehir concludes with &quot;Kusturica strikes a half-ironic tone throughout this overcrowded, cacophonous masterpiece that’s almost impossible to categorize. In the tradition of Eastern European film, he’s satirizing the conventions of rural magic realism at least as much as he’s embracing them. But there’s nothing cynical or cold-hearted about &quot;Black Cat, White Cat&quot;. Like the waves of geese, pigs, goats, dogs and cats that sometimes threaten to overwhelm the human characters, it is recklessly, indescribably alive&quot;.

Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; praised the film&#x27;s characters who &quot;whether freakish or treacherous, come up wonderfully human.&quot;

Web critic James Berardinelli praised the film as &quot;something fresh and vibrant in an era when something as idiotic as &quot;Armageddon&quot; is the top-grossing movie of 1998 and films generally follow safe, comfortable patterns because that&#x27;s what the studios&#x27; research shows that audiences want&quot;. He commended the film&#x27;s &quot;earthy feel as well as its charm that lies in it lacking the polished glaze of most big budget features although being expertly filmed&quot;, praised the performances of Bajram Severdžan and Branka Katić, and concluded that &quot;while not a masterpiece, Kusturica&#x27;s latest film is a real treat for those in search of a healthy dose of laughter set in a culture whose intricacies are rarely captured on film.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
Music has an important place in this picture, as it is present in almost every scene. Zarije is especially devoted to music as he&#x27;s seen with the local band playing specially for him on the way from hospital and then at the fair near the lake.

<doc id="1031250" wikidata="Q943336" url="?curid=1031250" title="Cotton library">
<text>The Cotton or Cottonian library is a collection of manuscripts that came into the hands of the antiquarian and bibliophile Sir Robert Bruce Cotton MP (1571–1631). The collection of books and materials Sir Robert held was one of the three &quot;foundation collections&quot; of the British Museum in 1753. It is now one of the major collections of the Department of Manuscripts of the British Library. Cotton was of a Shropshire family who originated near Wem and were based in Alkington and employed by the Geneva Bible publisher, statesman and polymath Sir Rowland Hill in the mid 16th century.

After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, many priceless and ancient manuscripts that had belonged to the monastic libraries began to be disseminated among various owners, many of whom were unaware of the cultural value of the manuscripts. Cotton&#x27;s skill lay in finding, purchasing and preserving these ancient documents. The leading scholars of the era, including Francis Bacon, Walter Raleigh, and James Ussher, came to use Sir Robert&#x27;s library. Richard James acted as his librarian. The library is of special importance for having preserved the only copy of several works, including &quot;Beowulf&quot;, &quot;The Battle of Maldon&quot;, and &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;.

In 1731 the collection was badly damaged by a fire in which 13 manuscripts were completely destroyed, and some 200 seriously damaged. The most important Anglo-Saxon manuscripts had already been copied; the original text of &quot;The Battle of Maldon&quot; was completely burned.

==History==
===Origins===
At the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, official state records and important papers were poorly kept, and often retained privately, neglected or destroyed by public officers. 

The Cotton family were prominent in Shropshire, and their seat at Alkington, and they were connected to the polymath and sixteenth century statesman Sir Rowland Hill who published the Geneva Bible; and by the seventeenth century Sir Robert Cotton came to hold, and subsequently bound, over a hundred volumes of official papers. There is a theory that the curious incident of the 1643 Battle of Wem was the output of concerns of both sides to secure the Library of Old Sir Rowland at Soulton Hall. 

By 1622, his house and library stood immediately north of the Houses of Parliament and was a valuable resource and meeting-place not only for antiquarians and scholars but also for politicians and jurists of various persuasions, including Sir Edward Coke, John Pym, John Selden, Sir John Eliot, and Thomas Wentworth.

Such important evidence was highly valuable at a time when the politics of the realm were historically disputed between king and Parliament. Sir Robert knew his library was of vital public interest and, although he made it freely available to consult, it made him an object of hostility on the part of the government. On 3 November 1629 he was arrested for disseminating a pamphlet held to be seditious (it had actually been written fifteen years earlier by Sir Robert Dudley) and the library was closed on this pretext. Cotton was released on 15 November and the prosecution abandoned the following May, but the library remained shut up until after Sir Robert&#x27;s death; it was restored to his son and heir, Sir Thomas Cotton, in 1633.

Sir Robert&#x27;s library included his collection of books, manuscripts, coins and medallions. After his death the collection was maintained and added to by his son, Sir Thomas Cotton (d. 1662), and grandson, Sir John Cotton (d. 1702).

===Gift to the nation===
Sir Robert&#x27;s grandson, Sir John Cotton, donated the Cotton library to Great Britain upon his death in 1702. At this time, Great Britain did not have a national library, and the transfer of the Cotton library to the nation became the basis of what is now the British Library. The early history of the collection is laid out in the introductory recitals to the British Museum Act 1700 (13 &amp; 14 Will. 3. c. 7) that established statutory trusts for the Cotton library:

Sir Robert Cotton late of Connington in the County of Huntingdon Baronett did at his own great Charge and Expense and by the Assistance of the most learned Antiquaries of his Time collect and purchase the most useful Manuscripts Written Books Papers Parchments [Records] and other Memorialls in most Languages of great Use and Service for the Knowledge and Preservation of our Constitution both in Church and State which Manuscripts and other Writings were procured as well from Parts beyond the Seas as from severall Private Collectors of such Antiquities within this Realm [and] are generally esteemed the best Collection of its Kind now any where extant And whereas the said Library has been preserved with the utmost Care and Diligence by the late Sir Thomas Cotton Son of the said Sir Robert and by Sir John Cotton of Westminster now living Grandson of the said Sir Robert and has been very much augmented and enlarged by them and lodged in a very proper Place in the said Sir Johns ancient Mansion House at Westminster which is very convenient for that Purpose And whereas the said Sir John Cotton in pursuance of the Desire and Intentions of his said Father and Grandfather is content and willing that the said Mansion House and Library should continue in his Family and Name and not be sold or otherwise disposed or imbezled and that the said Library should be kept and preserved by the Name of the Cottonian Library for Publick Use &amp; Advantage...

The acquisition of the collection was better secured and managed by the British Museum Act 1706 (6 Ann. c. 30), under which the trustees removed the collections from the ruinous Cotton House, whose site is now covered by the Houses of Parliament. It went first to Essex House, The Strand, which, however, was regarded as a fire risk; and then to Ashburnham House, a little west of the Palace of Westminster. From 1707 the library also housed the Old Royal Library (now &quot;Royal&quot; manuscripts at the British Library). Ashburnham House also became the residence of the keeper of the king&#x27;s libraries, Richard Bentley (1662–1742), a renowned theologian and classical scholar.

===Ashburnham House fire===
On 23 October 1731, fire broke out in Ashburnham House, in which 13 manuscripts were lost, while over 200 others faced severe destruction and water damage. Bentley escaped while clutching the priceless &quot;Codex Alexandrinus&quot; under one arm, a scene witnessed and later described in a letter to Charlotte, Lady Sundon, by Robert Freind, headmaster of Westminster School. The manuscript of &quot;The Battle of Maldon&quot; was destroyed, and that of &quot;Beowulf&quot; was heavily damaged. Also severely damaged was the Byzantine Cotton Genesis, the illustrations of which nevertheless remain an important record of Late Antique iconography. One of the collection&#x27;s two original exemplifications of the 1215 Magna Carta, &quot;Cotton Charter XIII.31A&quot;, was shrivelled in the fire, and its seal badly melted.

Arthur Onslow, Speaker of the House of Commons, as one of the statutory trustees of the library, directed and personally supervised a remarkable programme of restoration within the resources of his time. The published report of this work is of major importance in bibliography. Copies of some of the lost works had been made, and many of those damaged could be restored in the nineteenth century. However, these early conservation efforts were not always successful: bungled attempts to clean the Magna Carta exemplification rendered it largely illegible to the naked eye. More recently, advances in multispectral photography have enabled imaging specialists at the British Library led by Christina Duffy to scan and upload images of previously illegible early English manuscripts damaged in the fire. Images will form part of Fragmentarium (Digital Research Laboratory for Medieval Manuscript Fragments), an international collaboration of libraries and research institutions to catalogue and collate vulnerable manuscript fragments, making them available for research under a Creative Commons public domain license.

===British Museum and Library===
In 1753 the Cotton library was transferred to the new British Museum, under the Act of Parliament which established it. At the same time the Sloane Collection and Harley Collection were acquired and added, so that these three became the museum&#x27;s three &quot;foundation collections&quot;. The Royal manuscripts were donated by George II in 1757. In 1973 all these collections passed to the newly established British Library. The British Library continues to organise its Cottonian books according to the famous busts.

==Classification==
Sir Robert Cotton had organised his library according to the case, shelf and position of a book within a room twenty-six feet long and six feet wide. Each bookcase in his library was surmounted by a bust of a historical personage, including Augustus Caesar, Cleopatra, Julius Caesar, Nero, Otho, and Vespasian. In total, he had fourteen busts, and his scheme involved a designation of bust name/shelf letter/volume number from left end. Thus, the two most famous of the manuscripts from the Cotton library are &quot;Cotton Vitellius A.xv&quot; and &quot;Cotton Nero A.x&quot;. In Cotton&#x27;s own day, that meant &quot;Under the bust of Vitellius, top shelf (A), and count fifteen over&quot; for the volume containing the Nowell Codex (including &quot;Beowulf&quot;) and &quot;Go to the bust of Nero, top shelf, tenth book&quot; for the manuscript containing all the works of the Pearl Poet. The manuscripts are still catalogued by these call numbers in the British Library.

According to scholar, Colin Tite, the system according to the busts was probably not in full effect until 1638; however there are notes that suggest that Sir Robert planned to arrange the library in this system before his death in 1631, but was probably, as Tite hypothesises, interrupted during the implementation by the closure of the library in 1629.

In 1696, the first printed catalogue of the Cotton library&#x27;s holdings was published by Thomas Smith, the librarian of Sir John Cotton, Sir Robert Cotton&#x27;s grandson. The library&#x27;s official catalogue was published in 1802 by Joseph Planta, which remained the standard guide to the library&#x27;s contents until modern times.

<doc id="1031257" wikidata="Q2494969" url="?curid=1031257" title="Baikal Cossacks">
<text>Baikal Cossacks were Cossacks of the Transbaikal Cossack Host (); a Cossack host formed in 1851 in the areas beyond Lake Baikal (hence, Transbaikal).

==Organisation==
The Transbaikal Cossack Host was one of those created during the 19th century as the Russian Empire expanded to the Far East and South-East. It remained smaller than the Don Cossacks and other longer-established Hosts. The Transbaikal Cossack Host partially consisted of Siberian Cossacks, Buryats, Evenk (Tungus) military units, and included the peasant population of some of the regions. The military component included three cavalry regiments and three unmounted brigades. Its main purpose was to patrol the Sino-Russian border and perform everyday military duties in the region. The official leader of the Transbaikal Cossack Host had the title of &quot;Nakazny ataman&quot; (&quot;the one who was appointed&quot;). From 1872 he also served as military governor of the Transbaikal oblast, which had with its headquarters in Chita.

In the early 20th century, the Transbaikal Cossack Host normally supplied one &quot;polusotnya&quot; (fifty men) of guards for rural policing work, four cavalry regiments, and two batteries in time of peace. During World War I, the Host expanded to one polusotnya, nine cavalry regiments, four batteries, and three reserve &quot;sotnyas&quot; (each of one hundred men). In 1916, the Cossack population of the Transbaikal Cossack Host numbered 265,000 people, out of which 14,500 men served in the military.

==History==
The Transbaikal Cossack Army is known to have participated in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in 1899–1901, the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, and World War I. Many of the Cossack divisions were disbanded in 1917, but were recreated in 1918. During the Russian Civil War, the more prosperous Cossacks joined the ranks of the anti-Soviet armies of General Grigory Semenov and baron Roman Ungern. The poorer Cossacks took an active part in the guerrilla movement.

In 1920 at the end of the Russian Civil War, the Transbaikal Cossack Host was disbanded.

However, the remnant of Baikal Cossacks fled to Manchuria and some of their troops came under Manchukuo Imperial Army to resist Soviet Union.

==Distinctions==
The distinguishing colour of the Transbaikal Cossack Host was yellow; worn on the cap bands, epaulettes and wide trouser stripes of a dark green uniform of the loose-fitting cut common to the Steppe Cossacks. Individual regiments were distinguished by numbers on the epaulettes. High lambs-wool hats (papakha) were worn on occasion, with yellow cloth tops. From 1908 the new khaki service jacket of the regular Russian cavalry was adopted, but the yellow shoulder straps of the full dress uniform were retained, as was yellow piping on the blue/grey breeches.
