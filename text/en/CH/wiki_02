<text>Gérard Henri Grisey (; ; 17 June 1946 – 11 November 1998) was a twentieth-century French composer of contemporary classical music. His work is often associated with the Spectralist Movement in music, of which he was a major pioneer.

==Biography==
Grisey was born in Belfort, on 17 June 1946. From a very young age, Grisey demonstrated enormous interest and talent in music composition and study, writing his first essay on music when he was 9 years old. He studied at the in Trossingen in Germany from 1963 to 1965 before entering the Conservatoire national supérieur de musique where he studied with Olivier Messiaen from 1965 to 1967 and again from 1968 to 1972, while also working with Henri Dutilleux at the École normale de musique in 1968. He won prizes for piano accompaniment, harmony, counterpoint, fugue, and composition at the Conservatoire under Messiaen&#x27;s guidance. He also studied electroacoustics with Jean-Étienne Marie in 1969, composition with Karlheinz Stockhausen, Iannis Xenakis and György Ligeti at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse in 1972, and acoustics with at the Faculté des Sciences in 1974. Other studies were undertaken in the summer of 1969 at the Accademia Chigiana in Siena.

Grisey won the Prix de Rome, enabling him to stay at the Villa Medici in Rome from 1972 to 1974. While there he became friends with Tristan Murail, with whom he founded the group L&#x27;Itinéraire in 1973 along with Roger Tessier and Michaël Lévinas, later to be joined by Hugues Dufourt. In 1974–75, he studied acoustics with Émile Leipp at the Paris VI University, and in 1980 became a trainee at the IRCAM (Institut de recherche et coordination acoustique/musique) in the computer music course organized by David Wessel and Marc Battier. During the same year, Grisey went to Berlin as a guest of the D.A.A.D. (&quot;Berliner Künstlerprogramm des DAAD&quot;) program. He subsequently left for the University of California, Berkeley, where he was appointed professor of theory and composition for the years 1982 to 1985 or until 1986. After returning to Europe, he took up the role of professor of orchestration and composition at the Conservatoire de Paris from 1987 until his death, while also holding numerous composition seminars in France (Centre Acanthes, Lyon, Paris) and abroad (Darmstadt, Freiburg, Milan, Reggio Emilia, Oslo, Helsinki, Malmö, Göteborg, Los Angeles, Stanford, London, Moscow, Madrid, etc.) For notable pupils 

Gérard Grisey died at the age of 52 in Paris on 11 November 1998 due to a ruptured aneurysm.

==Musical style==
Grisey&#x27;s music is often considered to belong to the genre of spectral music, which he is credited with founding along with fellow composer Tristan Murail, although he later disowned the label in interviews and writings. According to British journalist Tom Service, &quot;His achievement has often been reduced to yet another of new music&#x27;s fetishistic labels, &#x27;spectralism&#x27; – a category that Grisey had rejected by the end of his life.&quot;

Nonetheless, he spent much of his career exploring the spectrum of tone colour between harmonic overtones and noise. In addition, he was fascinated by musical processes which unfold slowly, and he made musical time a major element of many of his pieces. He expressed the opinion that: &quot;We are musicians and our model is sound not literature, sound not mathematics, sound not theatre, visual arts, quantum physics, geology, astrology or acupuncture.&quot;

<text>Donald Frederick &quot;Donn&quot; Draeger (April 15, 1922 – October 20, 1982) was an American practitioner and teacher of martial arts. He was the author of several important books on Asian martial arts, and was a pioneer of international judo in the United States and Japan. He also helped make the study of martial arts an acceptable topic of academic research.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Donald Frederick &quot;Donn&quot; Draeger was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on April 15, 1922. His parents were Frank and Irma (Poetsch) Draeger. In 1940, at age 17, he was living in Milwaukee with his father, his stepmother Dora, two half-brothers, and his father&#x27;s stepfather and mother. He was married in Bluefield, West Virginia, on June 18, 1949. During the next two years, Draeger and his wife had two sons. The family separated in the spring of 1951.

===Military service===
Draeger served in the United States Marine Corps from 1943 to 1956. He began his recruit training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego in January 1943. After graduation, he attended officer candidate school at Marine Barracks Quantico. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in April 1943.

Draeger received branch training as a signal officer, and in October 1944, he was assigned to Corps Signal Battalion, V Amphibious Corps. During February and March 1945, Corps Signal Battalion participated in the Battle of Iwo Jima.

In April 1945, Draeger was promoted to first lieutenant, and transferred to III Amphibious Corps, which was preparing for the planned invasion of Japan. However, when the Pacific War ended in August 1945, III Amphibious Corps instead went to North China to accept the surrender of Japanese soldiers, and from October 1945 to February 1946, Draeger served with a signal unit in Tianjin, China.

Draeger returned to the USA in the spring of 1946, and for the rest of the year, he served with Marine detachments in Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin.

In January 1947, he was reassigned to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. While at Camp Lejeune, he was promoted to captain, commanded a company, and coached the base judo team.

During the summer of 1951, Draeger was sent to Korea, where he served as a signal officer in the 1st Marine Division. While in Korea, his secondary duties included teaching judo in the division support area near Hongcheon.

In October 1952, Draeger was reassigned to Headquarters Marine Corps. His primary duty assignment was with the Inter-American Defense Board. While in this billet, he held the rank of major. Upon completion of this assignment, Draeger reverted to his permanent rank of captain, and he separated from the service on June 30, 1956.

===Post-military===
In 1956, Draeger attended Georgetown University in Washington, DC, and in 1959, he was awarded the Bachelor of Science degree from Sophia University in Tokyo.

Draeger reportedly began his involvement in the martial arts while living in the Chicago area, at around the age of 7 or 8. His first training was in Yoshin-ryu jujutsu, but he soon changed to judo and by age 10, he reportedly achieved the grade of 2nd kyu (the lower of the two levels of brown belt).

By 1948, Draeger was ranked 4th &quot;dan&quot; in judo. This grading occurred before 1947, so it probably occurred while he was stationed in China in 1946. His known judo instructors in Tianjin included Mike Matvey.

In 1952, Draeger was one of the leaders of the newly established US Judo Black Belt Association. This was the first national-level judo organization in North America, and the forerunner of what later became the United States Judo Federation. Draeger&#x27;s national-level postings included vice-president of the Pan-American Judo Association and chairman of the Public Relations Committee of the Amateur Judo Association of the United States. He also helped promote judo throughout the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.

Draeger officially represented US judo interests during international contests held in Cuba and Belgium in 1953, and in 1964, he was named the United States Amateur Athletic Union judo representative in Japan, in anticipation of judo&#x27;s inclusion in the 1964 Olympics.

During this time, Draeger also trained in Chinese martial arts, learning baguazhang under Wang Shujin while in Japan. By mediation of his training partner Robert W. Smith, Draeger fought a challenge match against Huang Sheng-shyan, defeating him by a choke. Smith had previously tried to get him to fight the renowned Cheng Man-ch&#x27;ing, whom Draeger had previously criticized, but Draeger declined due to the heavy age difference between them.

Draeger also participated in judo activities in Japan. For instance, in 1961, Draeger and British judo athlete John Cornish were the first non-Japanese athletes selected to demonstrate nage-no-kata during the All-Japan Judo Championships. Draeger became a member of the Nihon Kobudo Shinkokai, the oldest Japanese cultural organization for the study and preservation of classical martial arts. He was the first non-Japanese practitioner of Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū, achieving instructor status (&quot;kyoshi menkyo&quot;) in that system. He also held high ranks in Shindo Muso-ryu jodo, kendo, karate and aikido, among other arts.

Draeger studied the evolution and development of human combative behavior and was director of the International Hoplology Society (IHC) in Tokyo until his death in 1982.

===Later years===
In his later years, Draeger spent four months a year on field trips throughout Asia. While on these trips, he visited schools and studied combative methods, which he analyzed and recorded. These studies were sometimes published as articles in various martial arts magazines, or put into books.

Draeger lived in Japan, China, Mongolia, Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia. One of the books he wrote is &quot;Pentjak-Silat: The Indonesian Fighting Art&quot; (1970). In 1979, Draeger and his team visited the island of Sumatra. While visiting the Aceh tribe there, it appears that the entire group was somehow poisoned, perhaps deliberately. As a result, he developed severe amoebic dysentery, leading to hospitalization. Draeger began losing weight and he grew increasingly weak during this ordeal. His legs began to swell, causing him great pain, and he found it difficult to walk or train. His long devotion to martial arts training came to a gradual halt.

While he was getting treatment at Tripler Army Medical Center in Honolulu, it was discovered that he had developed cancer of the liver. Draeger died on October 20, 1982, at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Milwaukee. Cause of death was metastasized carcinoma. He was buried at Wood National Cemetery in Milwaukee on October 25, 1982. His grave lies in Section 4, site 377.

==Books and other media==
Draeger wrote dozens of books and articles about the Asian martial arts. His most influential books were probably &quot;Asian Fighting Arts&quot; (written with Robert W. Smith, Tuttle, 1969) and &quot;Martial Arts and Ways of Japan&quot; (Weatherhill, 3 volumes, 1973–1974). Draeger&#x27;s research, theories, and concepts inspired a generation of martial art researchers and practitioners, and as of 2012, many of his books remain in print.

Draeger briefly worked in film. Specifically, he served as martial arts coordinator for the James Bond film &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, where he also doubled for actor Sean Connery. He also appeared in at least one television documentary about the Japanese martial arts.

While living in Japan, Draeger collected woodblock prints, and in 2004, part of his collection of sumo prints was featured in an exhibition organized by the Seattle Asian Art Museum.

<text>The May Uprising took place in Dresden, Kingdom of Saxony in 1849; it was one of the last of the series of events known as the Revolutions of 1848.

==Events leading to the May Uprising==
In the German states, revolutions began in March 1848, starting in Berlin and spreading across the other states which now make up Germany. The heart of the revolutions was in Frankfurt, where the newly formed National Assembly, the Frankfurt Parliament, met in St Paul&#x27;s Church from May 1848, calling for a constitutional monarchy to rule a new, united German nation. To form the Assembly, near-democratic elections had taken place across the German states; the majority of the members were Saxon democrats. On 28 March 1849 the Assembly passed the first &quot;Reichsverfassung&quot; (constitution) for Germany, and in April 1849, Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia was offered the crown.

Despite its apparent progress, the National Assembly really depended upon the co-operation of the old leaders and Emperor; this became all too clear when Friedrich Wilhelm IV refused to accept the crown in disgust. Movements sprang up across the German states to force through the new constitution but the National Assembly disintegrated. In Saxony, Frederick Augustus II had never recognised the constitution, and now also disbanded the Saxon parliament.

In Württemberg the more radical elements of the National Assembly formed a rump parliament in Stuttgart, which was defeated by Prussian troops. At the same time, the people of Saxony began to react to the repression of the democratic movement — the May Uprising began.

==The uprising==
At first the Saxon town councillors attempted to persuade Frederick Augustus II to accept the constitution in public speeches. The municipal guards who should have controlled them were on their side and made an address to the King, also calling for acceptance of the constitution. The King was unyielding, however, and called them to order. This led to further unrest, which in turn caused the king to bring in Prussian troops; the situation exploded.

On 3 May 1849, the municipal guards were told to go home, but the town councillors organised them into defensive units to stop expected Prussian intervention. As the people&#x27;s anger grew, the government withdrew into the castle and the armoury (&quot;Zeughaus&quot;), protected by Saxon troops. The municipal guards were undecided whether or not to support the people, who threatened to use explosives to get the government out. In response the Saxon troops fired on the crowd. Within hours the town was in chaos, with 108 barricades erected. In the early hours of 4 May 1849, the king and his ministers managed to escape and fled to the fortress of Königstein.

Three members of the dissolved Democratic parliament now became the leaders of the revolution: Samuel Erdmann Tzschirner, Karl Gotthelf Todt and Otto Leonhard Heubner formed a provisional government with the aim of forcing the acceptance of the constitution. Tzschirner called in another member, Alexander Heinze, to organise fighting and bring in more communal guards from outside Dresden.

Reinforcements joined the revolutionaries from as far away as Chemnitz, Zwickau and Marienberg, and the struggle grew extremely violent. The Saxon troops were also backed up by arriving Prussian soldiers. They planned to encircle the rebels and corner them on the &quot;Altmarkt&quot; (Old Market), but the number of barricades meant they had to fight for every street, even in the houses.

Recent studies place the number of revolutionaries at around 3,000, compared with 5,000 government troops from Saxony and Prussia. Apart from being outnumbered, the rebels were also untrained in battle, disorganised and lacked weapons, so they stood little chance of success. On 9 May the majority (1,800) were forced to flee. Most of the others gave up, and the rest were tracked down to the Frauenkirche and arrested.

==Prominent figures amongst the revolutionaries==
Before the events of May 1849, Dresden was already known as a cultural centre for liberals and democrats; the anarchist &quot;Dresdner Zeitung&quot; newspaper was partly edited by the music director August Röckel and contained articles by Mikhail Bakunin, who came to Dresden in March 1849. The Saxon government later accused Bakunin of being the revolutionaries&#x27; ringleader, although this is unlikely to have been the case. Röckel also published the popular democratic newspaper &quot;Volksblätter&quot;.

Richard Wagner the composer, at the time Royal Saxon Court Conductor, had been inspired by the revolutionary spirit since 1848 and was befriended by Röckel and Bakunin. He wrote passionate articles in the &quot;Volksblätter&quot; inciting people to revolt, and when fighting broke out he took a very active part in it, making hand grenades and standing as a look out at the top of the Kreuzkirche. The architect Gottfried Semper was until 1849 less politically active, but had made known his democratic beliefs and felt compelled to stand up for them, also taking a lead role on the barricades. Others on the barricades included Pauline Wunderlich, Gustav Zeuner, Ludwig Wittig (main editor of the &quot;Dresdner Zeitung&quot;); the actress and singer Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient supported the uprising.

==Results of the uprising==
The struggle left some Dresden buildings in ruins: the old Opera, two sides of the Zwinger and six houses were burned down. The number of dead rebels is uncertain but in 1995 the figure was estimated at around 200; 8 Saxon and 23 Prussian soldiers died.

The Saxon government arrested Bakunin and Röckel in Chemnitz, but Tzschirner, Heubner and Todt escaped. Todt died early in his Swiss exile at Rießbach in 1852. Semper and Wagner were on the government&#x27;s wanted list, but also escaped, to Zürich, where Wagner remained. From 1849 the German states saw a sharp rise in emigration as thousands deserted their homeland for political reasons, many of them artists, writers and other well-educated, prominent members of society.

The revolution had a slight effect on the political system, in that the nobility lost some of its power in the lower house, but otherwise was a complete failure.

<doc id="1007725" wikidata="Q213769" url="?curid=1007725" title="Lake Päijänne">
<text>Lake Päijänne () is the second largest lake in Finland (). The lake drains into the Gulf of Finland via the Kymi River. The major islands are from north to south Vuoritsalo, Muuratsalo, Onkisalo, Judinsalo, Edessalo, Taivassalo, Haukkasalo, Vehkasalo, Mustassalo, Virmailansaari and Salonsaari. The largest island is Virmailansaari. The word &quot;saari&quot; means an island. &quot;Salo&quot; once meant a great island, nowadays it means a great forest area.

The largest city on the shores of Päijänne is Jyväskylä in the North. The city of Lahti is connected to Päijänne through Lake Vesijärvi and Vääksy canal.

An underground aqueduct, Päijänne Water Tunnel, connects the lake to Vantaa, providing the Greater Helsinki area with water. The deepest point in any lake in Finland is in Päijänne ().

The name of Lake Päijänne comes possibly from a Pre-Finno-Ugric substrate language.

==Transportation==
Päijänne is a famous boating, canoeing and sailing attraction. The long lake is connected by canals to Lake Keitele, Lake Vesijärvi and to Lake Ruotsalainen. Length of the open waterway for ships is . Construction of canals connecting Päijänne to the Baltic Sea has been discussed for decades. Nevertheless, the plan is still to be materialized.

Until the 1940s Lake Päijänne was a major transportation channel in the Central Finland. Numerous ships transported passengers and freight between the villages and cities on the shores of Päijänne. Nowadays, passenger transportation is rather a tourist attraction on the lakelands than the fastest way connecting the cities and villages. One of the most popular passenger transportation routes in summertime is between the cities of Lahti and Jyväskylä.

==Tourism==
There are 16,000 cottages on the shores of Päijänne. Most of the cottages are private owned and have a separate sauna cottage.

In addition to cottage tourism Päijänne attracts fishing, sailing, canoeing, rowing, paddling, trekking, ice-skating, snow mobile and nature tourists. The National Parks of Päijänne and Leivonmäki alone has tens of thousands of visitors every year.

The Clear and Drinkable Lake Päijänne South Association won a Tourism and Environment award presented by the European Union Commission in 1995.

==National Parks==
Päijänne National Park () is a national park in the southern parts of Lake Päijänne. It consists of 50 unbuilt islands and parts of inhabited islands. The national park has been established in 1993 and has an area of .

Leivonmäki National Park is situated few kilometres North East from the Northern part of Lake Päijänne. It is one of the youngest national parks in Finland.

<text>A home equity line of credit, or HELOC ( ), is a revolving type of secured loan in which the lender agrees to lend a maximum amount within an agreed period (called a term), where the collateral is the borrower&#x27;s property (akin to a second mortgage). Because a home often is a consumer&#x27;s most valuable asset, many homeowners use their HELOC for major purchases or projects, such as home improvements, education, property investment or medical bills, and choose not to use them for day-to-day expenses.

A reason for the popularity of HELOCs is their flexibility, both in terms of borrowing and repaying. Furthermore, their popularity may also stem from having a better image than a &quot;second mortgage&quot;, a term which can more directly imply an undesirable level of debt. However, within the lending industry itself, HELOCs are categorized as a second mortgage. HELOCs are usually offered at attractive interest rates. This is because they are secured against a borrower’s home and thus seen as low-risk financial products.

However, because the collateral of a HELOC is the home, failure to repay the loan or meet loan requirements may result in foreclosure. As a result, lenders generally require that the borrower maintain a certain level of equity in the home as a condition of providing a home equity line, usually a minimum of 15-20%.

==Differences from conventional loans==
A HELOC differs from a conventional home equity loan in that the borrower is not advanced the entire sum up front, but uses a line of credit to borrow sums that total no more than the credit limit, similar to a credit card.

The term of a HELOC is split in two distinct periods. During the “draw period”, the customer can use their HELOC like a revolving facility. Draw periods typically last 10 years. During this time, the borrower can drawdown funds, repay and redraw again as many times as they wish, only paying interest on their outstanding balance. The draw period is followed by the “repayment period” where the outstanding balance plus interest is due, either as a lump-sum balloon payment or according to a loan amortization schedule.

Early repayment can usually be made at any time in the term and are either capital and interest or interest only (“minimum payment”). Repayment amount can range from the minimum payment to the full drawn amount plus interest. Lenders determine the amount they can lend to a borrower based on two variables: 1) the value of the security property and 2) the borrower’s creditworthiness. This is expressed in a combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio.

== History of HELOCs ==

=== United States ===
HELOCs became very popular in the United States in the early 2000s, in part because banks were using ad campaigns to encourage customers to take out home loans, and because interest paid was typically deductible under federal and many state income tax laws. This effectively reduced the cost of borrowing funds and offered an attractive tax incentive over traditional methods of borrowing such as credit cards. Whereas most mortgages are offered at fixed rates, HELOCs are usually offered at variable rates due to the flexibility embedded into a 10-year draw period where interest rates may change.

HELOC abuse is often cited as one cause of the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States. In 2008 major home equity lenders including Bank of America, Countrywide Financial, Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, National City Mortgage, Washington Mutual and Wells Fargo began informing borrowers that their home equity lines of credit had been frozen, reduced, suspended, rescinded or restricted in some other manner. Falling housing prices have led to borrowers possessing reduced equity, which was perceived as an increased risk of foreclosure in the eyes of lenders.

After Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, interest on a HELOC is no longer deductible unless the loan is used for substantial home improvement. After announcing they were no longer considering applications for HELOCs in 2020, JPMorgan Chase announced in May 2022 they were reconsidering it.

=== Canada ===
Similarly to the US, the HELOC market in Canada grew by 20% a year in the early 2000s, representing $35 billion in 2000 to approximately $186 billion in 2012. Looking at non-mortgage consumer debt, the share of HELOCs grew from 10% to 40% in that time. To put this breakthrough into perspective, credit cards consistently represented around 15% of the market share through this period. The main drivers for this evolving market were low-interest rates and sustained rising property prices. Both conditions were favourable to customers, as the growing equity in their properties represented an excellent opportunity to secure larger and longer loans.

In the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, demand for HELOCs stabilized and grew by an average of 2% yearly. This slower growth could be attributed to a lower demand, exceptionally low rates on mortgages and a more regulated market. Indeed, the recession has pushed the Canadian government to take measures aimed at mitigating the risks associated with taking a HELOC. Some of these measures may have impacted the growth of the HELOC market, limiting the demand on the customer side and making lending criteria tighter.

A 2011 decision to make HELOCs ineligible for government-backed “portfolio insurance” was one of them. This insurance was used by lenders to “securitize pooled mortgages through the National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities (NHA MBS) program”. Another measure was the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) decision to cap the maximum LTV ratio for HELOCs at 65%, thus limiting the amounts homeowners could leverage from their property. Underwriting rules were also made stricter through the Residential Mortgage Underwriting Practices and Procedures Guideline.

=== United Kingdom ===
Despite the proliferation of HELOC products in the US and Canada, the UK market did not have a similar product offering pre-2021. This is significant as the UK market has historically replicated innovative financial products developed in the US, such as credit cards or online payments. This can be partly attributed to the fact that the UK banking system is highly consolidated with little product innovation among the major lenders. This changed in the post-pandemic context, where innovation in the financial services industry has accelerated, with ‘fintechs’ introducing new products to the market.

The first UK HELOC product was in 2021, by the fintech Selina Finance. As of 2022, despite less than 5% per capita utilisation of HELOC products compared to mature, established markets such as the US and Canada, UK customers have shown increasing tendency to use HELOC products as a substitute to existing consumer finance tools. As a result, annual HELOC originations have increased fivefold, from $50m in 2021 to $250m in 2022.

In the UK however, offset mortgages have been common for many years, which is a primary form of lending against a property. The current companies that provide these products are Yorkshire Building Society, Coverntry Building Society, Clydesdale Bank &amp; Accord Mortgages. A primary benefit of offset mortgages is that they have fee free options, whereas Selina Finance&#x27;s option comes with a minimum fee of over £1300.

=== Brazil ===
In spite of high interest rates for consumers in Brazil, which are historically among the highest in the world, often above 200% per year, and in some cases, surpassing 430% per year for revolving credit card debt, home equity line of credit (HELOC) were not offered in the country prior to 2023. In 2022, almost 80% of Brazilian families ended the year in debt (generally with very expensive rates), a record since the CNC - National Confederation of Commerce - began researching the subject in 2011. The first Brazilian company offering a HELOC product was authorized to operate by the Central Bank of Brazil in June 2023. It was the fintech ZiliCred (trading name) / All In Cred (company name). 

ZiliCred estimates that the market potential of home equity line of credit (HELOC) in Brazil represents something like 12% of operations linked to property guarantees, which represents around BRL 420 billion. ZiliCred HELOC closing costs are around CDI rate plus a flat rate (0.99% to 1.99%) per month, which represents average savings around 95% when compared to interest rates from other revolving credit lines. ZiliCred offers a fee free option when HELOC is contracted directly with the Company.

The introduction of HELOC in Brazil is a noteworthy development in the country&#x27;s financial landscape. It can enhance financial flexibility, reduce borrowing costs, and provide homeowners with a valuable tool to manage their finances more effectively. This empowerment can lead to better financial decision-making, reduced reliance on high-cost consumer debt, and ultimately a higher quality of life for many individuals.

<doc id="1007733" wikidata="Q3904949" url="?curid=1007733" title="Regenerative fuel cell">
<text>A regenerative fuel cell or reverse fuel cell (RFC) is a fuel cell run in reverse mode, which consumes electricity and chemical B to produce chemical A. By definition, the process of any fuel cell could be reversed. However, a given device is usually optimized for operating in one mode and may not be built in such a way that it can be operated backwards. Standard fuel cells operated backwards generally do not make very efficient systems unless they are purpose-built to do so as with high-pressure electrolysers, regenerative fuel cells, solid-oxide electrolyser cells and unitized regenerative fuel cells.

==Process description==
A hydrogen fueled proton-exchange membrane fuel cell, for example, uses hydrogen gas (H2) and oxygen (O2) to produce electricity and water (H2O); a regenerative hydrogen fuel cell uses electricity and water to produce hydrogen and oxygen.

When the fuel cell is operated in regenerative mode, the anode for the electricity production mode (fuel cell mode) becomes the cathode in the hydrogen generation mode (reverse fuel cell mode), and vice versa. When an external voltage is applied, water at the anode side will undergo electrolysis to form oxygen and protons; protons will be transported through the solid electrolyte to the cathode where they can be reduced to form hydrogen. In this reverse mode, the polarity of the cell is opposite to that for the fuel cell mode. 
The following reactions describe the chemical process in the hydrogen generation mode:

At the anode (where water is oxidized): H2O→1/2O2 + 2H+ + 2e−

At the cathode (where hydrogen is produced): 2H+ + 2e−→ H2

Overall, the reaction can be summarized as: H2O→ 1/2O2 + H2

==Solid oxide regenerative fuel cell==
One example of RFC is solid oxide regenerative fuel cell. Solid oxide fuel cell operates at high temperatures with high fuel-to-electricity conversion ratios and it is a good candidate for high temperature electrolysis. Less electricity is required for electrolysis process in solid oxide regenerative fuel cells (SORFC) due to high temperature.

The electrolyte can be O2− conducting and/or proton (H+) conducting. The state of the art for O2− conducting yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) based SORFC using Ni–YSZ as the hydrogen electrode and LSM (or LSM–YSZ) as the oxygen electrode has been actively studied. Dönitz and Erdle reported on the operation of YSZ electrolyte cells with current densities of 0.3 A cm−2 and 100% Faraday efficiency at only 1.07 V. The recent study by researchers from Sweden shows that ceria-based composite electrolytes, where both proton and oxide ion conductions exist, produce high current output for fuel cell operation and high hydrogen output for electrolysis operation. Zirconia doped with scandia and ceria (10Sc1CeSZ) is also investigated as potential electrolyte in SORFC for hydrogen production at intermediate temperatures (500-750 °C). It is reported that 10Sc1CeSZ shows good behavior and produces high current densities, with suitable electrodes.

Current density–voltage () curves and impedance spectra are investigated and recorded. Impedance
spectra are realized applying an ac current of 1–2A RMS (root-mean-square) in the frequency range from 30 kHz
to 10−1 Hz. Impedance spectra shows that the resistance is high at low frequencies (&lt;10 kHz) and near zero at high frequencies (&gt;10 kHz). Since high frequency corresponds to electrolyte activities, while low frequencies corresponds to electrodes process, it can be deduced that only a small fraction of the overall resistance is from the electrolyte and most resistance comes from anode and cathode. Hence, developing high performance electrodes are essential for high efficiency SORFC. Area specific resistance can be obtained from the slope of curve. Commonly used/tested electrodes materials are nickel/zirconia cermet (Ni/YSZ) and lanthanum-substituted strontium titanate/ceria composite for SORFC cathode, and lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) for SORFC anode. Other anode materials can be lanthanum strontium ferrite
(LSF), lanthanum strontium copper ferrite and lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite. Studies show that Ni/YSZ electrode was less active in reverse fuel cell operation than in fuel cell operation, and this can be attributed to a diffusion-limited process in the electrolysis direction, or its susceptibility to aging in a high-steam environment,
primarily due to coarsening of nickel particles. Therefore, alternative materials such as the titanate/ceria composite (La0.35Sr0.65TiO3–Ce0.5La0.5O2−δ) or (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5O3 (LSCM) have been proposed electrolysis cathodes. Both LSF and LSM/YSZ are reported as good anode candidates for electrolysis mode. 
Furthermore, higher operation temperature and higher absolute humidity ratio can result in lower area specific resistance.

<doc id="1007738" wikidata="Q5216087" url="?curid=1007738" title="Dangerous Dogs Act 1991">
<text>The Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 (c. 65) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom prohibiting or restricting certain types of dogs and codifying the criminal offence of allowing a dog of any breed to be dangerously out of control. After a series of eleven dog attacks in 1991, Home Secretary Kenneth Baker promised &quot;to rid the country of the menace of these fighting dogs&quot;. The Act has been controversial for failing to stem the rise of dog attacks and for focusing on a dog&#x27;s breed or looks instead of an individual dog&#x27;s behaviour.

==Introduction==
The 1991 act was introduced by then Home Secretary Kenneth Baker, and was amended in 1997. The Act applies in England, Wales and Scotland, with The Dangerous Dogs (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 having a similar effect in Northern Ireland. The intention of the Act was the protection of the people. Prior to the Act there were no criminal penalties for injuries or deaths caused by dog attacks.

In summary:
*Section 1, &quot;Dogs bred for fighting&quot;, prohibits the ownership of certain types of dogs, unless exempted on the &quot;Index of Exempt Dogs&quot;. It was intended to have a preventative effect.
*Section 2, &quot;Other specially dangerous dogs&quot;, allows to designate further dog types that present a serious danger to the public (in addition to those bred for fighting).
*Section 3&quot;,&quot; &quot;Keeping dogs under proper control&quot;, creates a criminal offence of allowing any dog (of any breed or type) to be dangerously out of control, and legal action may be taken against the dog&#x27;s owner.
*Section 4, &quot;Destruction and disqualification orders&quot;, covers orders for destruction of dogs, and orders for prohibiting offenders from the keeping of dogs for a period of time.

Britain has a long history of various dog legislation in attempts to protect the public. In the ninth century, dog-owners were fined if their dog bit a person. In 1839, fines were exacted for allowing dogs to run loose in London, and owners were liable if their unmuzzled dog attacked a person or other animal. In 1847, it became a criminal offence to let a dangerous dog run loose. The power to confiscate dogs was introduced in 1871. Prohibition of owning a dog as a penalty was available in 1989. The 1991 Act banned four types of dog, and made it an offence for an owner to allow any dog &quot;to be dangerously out of control&quot;. In 1997, the Act was amended, relaxing rules and giving courts more flexibility about euthanasia orders. And in 2006, local authorities were empowered to ban dogs from certain public areas to reduce menace and fouling by dogs.

==Section 1 (Breed Specific Legislation)==
Under the Act, it is illegal to own certain dogs without an exemption from a court. The Act bans the breeding, sale and exchange of these dogs, even if they are on the Index of Exempted Dogs.

The Act applies to five types of dogs:
* Pit Bull Terrier
* Japanese Tosa
* Dogo Argentino
* Fila Brasileiro
* XL Bully
The first two are explicitly mentioned in the Act, and the third and fourth were designated by the Secretary of State in 1991, and the fifth added in 2023.

The Act also covers cross-breeds of the above five types of dog. Dangerous dogs are classified by &quot;type&quot;, not by breed label. This means that whether a dog is prohibited under the Act will depend on a judgement about its physical characteristics, and whether they match the description of a prohibited &quot;type&quot;. This assessment of the physical characteristics is made by a Dog Legislation Officer (DLO), a police officer experienced in dog handling and dog legislation, who assists in the investigation of dog-related allegations of crime.

On 15 September 2023, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that XL Bully would be added to the Dangerous Dogs Act. It was designated on 31 December 2023 for England and Wales, and in Scotland on 23 February 2024.

=== What is prohibited ===
The act makes it illegal for anyone to own, breed, breed from, sell, advertise (even as a gift), give away, or allow a dog of any of the listed breeds to stray. Those who previously owned individuals of the breed before the act came into force could apply for Certificates of Exemption for a limited period of time after the act came into effect for each of the breeds prohibited.

===Index of Exempted Dogs===
The process for getting a Section 1 dog exempted includes proving to the court that the dog is not a danger to public safety, that it is owned by a &#x27;fit and proper&#x27; person to be in charge of a dog, that the dog is already neutered and microchipped, and that the owner has obtained third-party insurance that would cover an incident of bodily injury or death of a person caused by the dog. Ongoing conditions include keeping the dog at the address listed, notifying of address changes, notifying of the death or export of the dog, keeping the dog muzzled and on a lead in public places, keeping the dog securely to prevent escape, and maintaining all previous conditions for the life of the dog.

The Act established the &quot;Index of Exempted Dogs&quot; and the Animal Welfare section of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) oversees the administration of the Act and the Index.

Initially, dogs born before 30 November 1991 were eligible to be put on the Index of Exempted Dogs (a grandfather clause). Applications were received for over 8,000 dogs; 5,223 dogs received their &quot;Certificate of Exemption&quot;. Dogs born after 30 November 1991 were not eligible to be on the Index, and it was expected the Index would cease after the death of the last of the original 5,223 dogs. However, the 1997 amendments expanded eligibility, effectively continuing the Index. As of 2015, there were 3,001 Pit bull terriers on the Index, 6 Dogo Argentinos, 0 Fila Brasilieros, and 3 Japanese Tosas. As of 2018, there were 3,514 Pit bull terriers, 3 Japanese Tosas, 13 Dogo Argentinos, and 0 Fila Brazilieros. As of February 2024, when the XL Bully ban came into effect, there were over 55,000 XL bullies registered.

==Reception and responses==

The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the British Veterinary Association are both against the breed-specific legislation provisions of the Act (Section 1), claiming that there is no scientific evidence that all individuals of a breed are dangerous. However, data from the Metropolitan Police shows that in incidents involving &#x27;dangerously out of control dogs&#x27; banned breeds account for about 20% of offences. Defra says there are &quot;a large number of serious cases from a very small population of dogs in circulation, and that is striking evidence that there is an issue with this particular type of dog&quot;, while a Member of Parliament said &quot;Despite the fact that dogs on the exempt list must be muzzled in public, that breed still accounts for almost 20% of all reported attacks. We know also that pit bulls have been involved in seven of the 31 fatal attacks that have occurred since 2005. That is highly disproportionate for one type of dog that is banned, and it underlines the need to be cautious about change in this area.&quot;

The RSPCA have been criticised for their opposition to breed-specific legislation, and their own pet insurance excludes certain breeds from coverage.

The act only covers dog attacks causing physical injury to a human, not physical injury or death to other animals, and does not cover mental injury to a human witnessing such an attack (PTSD, for example). Efforts have been made to get the law changed. In some cases, injuries to humans have been ignored or not taken seriously by authorities because they were caused during a dog-on-dog attack.

A 2018 proposal by PETA to have the Staffordshire Bull Terrier and American Bulldog added to the list of banned dogs spawned a petition in support of the Staffordshires which garnered 160,000 signatures. The proposal was debated by Parliament and rejected. George Eustice declared, &quot;The Government have no plans at all to add Staffordshire bull terriers, or any other type of dog, to the list of prohibited dogs.&quot;

The act has been described as a piece of rushed legislation which was an overreaction to a transient public mood. The Act is sometimes cited as an unfavourable example of such legislation, and in January 2007, the act was included in public responses to a BBC Radio 4 poll of unpopular UK legislation.

A 1992 case involving a dog named Dempsey, a pit bull terrier which three years later had its destruction order reversed, brought interest because of the lack of discretion that the Act gave magistrates regarding Section 1 dogs. Discretion was granted to magistrates with the 1997 amendment to the Act.

In the case of &quot;R (Sandhu) v. Isleworth Crown Court [2012]&quot;, the claimant Sandhu was in prison and sought to nominate a temporary keeper to have his dog. The judicial review held that a person does have the right to nominate a person to temporarily keep the dog. This decision has more recently been more regulated to only allow for temporary keepership in certain circumstances.

<text>(William) Denis Johnston (18 June 1901 – 8 August 1984) was an Irish writer. Born in Dublin, he wrote mostly plays, but also works of literary criticism, a book-length biographical essay of Jonathan Swift, a memoir and an eccentric work on cosmology and philosophy. He also worked as a war correspondent, and as both a radio and television producer for the BBC. His first play, &quot;The Old Lady Says &quot;No!&quot;&quot;, helped establish the worldwide reputation of the Dublin Gate Theatre; his second, &quot;The Moon in the Yellow River&quot;, has been performed around the globe in numerous productions featuring such storied names as James Mason, Jack Hawkins, Claude Rains, Barry Fitzgerald, James Coco and Errol Flynn. Later plays dealt with the life of Swift, the 1916 Rebellion, the pursuit of justice, and the fear of death. He wrote two opera libretti and a pageant.

== Early life ==
Johnston was the only child of William John Johnston from Magherafelt, a barrister (later an Irish Supreme Court judge), and his wife, Kathleen (née King), a teacher and singer from Belfast. They were Presbyterians and liberal home rulers. Johnston was to see the family home in Dublin occupied by rebels during the 1916 Easter Rising. 

Johnston was educated at St Andrew&#x27;s College, Dublin (1908–15, 1917–19), and Merchiston Castle School, Edinburgh (1915–16). In 1918, he attempted to join Sinn Féin, offering to supply the party with weapons taken from his Officer Training Corps. In 1922, while reading history and law at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge (1919–23) he tried to enlist in the civil-war Free State army. He went on to study at the Harvard Law School (1923–4) and entered King&#x27;s Inns (Dublin) and the Inner Temple (London).

In London, developing his interest in the theatre, Johnston abandoned plans for a legal and political career.

==Career==
Johnston was a protégé of Yeats and Shaw, and had a stormy friendship with Seán O&#x27;Casey. He was a pioneer of television and war reporting. He worked as a lawyer in the 1920s and &#x27;30s before joining the BBC as a writer and producer, first in radio and then in the fledgling television service. His broadcast dramatic work included both original plays and adaptations of the work of many different writers.

&quot;Passionate in his radical scepticism and loathing of what he saw as the pernicious influence of the Roman Catholic Church&quot;, at the end of 1933, Johnston joined the trade unionist John Swift, the Dublin novelist Mary Manning, and fellow northerner, the socialist Jack White, in forming The Secular Society of Ireland. &quot;Convinced that clerical domination in the community is harmful to advance&quot;, the society sought &quot;to establish in this country complete freedom of thought, speech and publication, liberty for mind, in the widest toleration compatible with orderly progress and rational conduct&quot;. Among other things it aimed to terminate ”the clerically-dictated ban on divorce”, “the Censorship of Publications Act” and “the system of clerical management, and consequent sectarian teaching, in schools.” 

This was at a time of heightened clerical militancy and as soon the meeting place of the Society (from which it distributed the British journal &quot;The Freethinker&quot;) was exposed, it had to shift to private houses outside of Dublin. In 1936 Johnson and the other members wound the society up and donated the proceeds to the government of the beleaguered Spanish Republic. Johnston had become a recognised man of the left: in 1930 he had joined the Irish Friends of Soviet Russia, and though never a party member, until as late as the 1950s he professed faith in a communist future.

During the Second World War he served as a BBC war correspondent, reporting from El Alamein, through the Italian campaign, to Buchenwald and Hitler&#x27;s Berghof. For this he was awarded an OBE, a Mention in Despatches, and the Yugoslav Partisans Medal. He then became Director of Programmes for the television service.

Johnston later moved to the United States and taught at Mount Holyoke College, Smith College and other universities. He kept extensive diaries throughout his life, now deposited in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin, and these together with his many articles and essays give a distinctive picture of his times and the people he knew. Another archive of his work is held at the library of Ulster University at Coleraine. He received honorary degrees from the University of Ulster and Mount Holyoke College and was a member of Aosdána.

Denis and actress Shelah Richards were the parents of Jennifer Johnston, a respected novelist and playwright, and a son, Micheal. His second wife was the actress Betty Chancellor, with whom he had two sons, Jeremy and Rory.

==Critical acclaim==
Hilton Edwards, who first directed &quot;The Old Lady Says &quot;No!&quot;&quot;, said that the script &quot;read like a railway guide and played like &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot;.&quot;

Reviewing &quot;The Moon in the Yellow River&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Brooks Atkinson wrote &quot;Mr Johnston does not explain; he irradiates.&quot; Set in 1927 during an attempt by the IRA to destroy an Irish Free State government power plant, a later &quot;New York Times&quot; review of the play&#x27;s 1961 revival noted an &quot;exhilaratingly mad, comic strain.&quot;. But acclaim was not universal. Irish writer and broadcaster (and later member of the Irish Senate) Denis Ireland remarked that the play&#x27;s success in London was &quot;natural enough&quot; for &quot;it fulfils the first law of Anglo-Irish literature: it makes the native Irish appear a race of congenital idiots.&quot;

Johnston&#x27;s war memoir &quot;Nine Rivers from Jordan&quot; reached The &quot;New York Times&quot;&#x27; Best Seller list and was cited in the &quot;World Book Encyclopedia&quot;&#x27;s 1950s article on World War II under &quot;Books to Read&quot;, along with Churchill, Eisenhower et al. Joseph Ronsley cites an unnamed former CBS Viet Nam correspondent who called the book the &quot;Bible&quot;, carrying it with him constantly, &quot;reading it over and over in the field during his tour of duty.&quot;

In a profile in the &quot;New Yorker&quot; in 1938, Clifford Odets is quoted as saying that the only playwrights he admired were John Howard Lawson, Sean O’Casey, and Denis Johnston.

Johnston&#x27;s tribute to Dublin, &quot;Strumpet city in the sunset,&quot; from the closing speech of &quot;The Old Lady says &quot;No!&quot;&quot;, has achieved its own fame. James Plunkett titled his epic novel of Dublin before the First World War &quot;Strumpet City&quot;. A travel guide written by Harvard students in introducing Dublin made a classic misattribution: &quot;James Joyce loved his &#x27;Strumpet city in the sunset&#x27;&quot;.

The Denis Johnston Playwriting Prize is awarded annually by Smith College Department of Theatre for the best play, screenplay or musical written by an undergraduate at Smith, Mount Holyoke, Amherst and Hampshire Colleges and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The prize was endowed by his former student at Smith, Carol Sobieski.

Guitarist Jeremy Popoff and bassist Kevin Baldes met in 1986, and soon after, began playing music together. In 1987, Popoff (guitar), Jerry Neel (bass), Dave Barber (drums) and Derek Johnson (vocals) formed the band Strate Lace and performed three live shows together: The Troubador in Hollywood, The Waters Club in San Pedro, and a back-to-school party in a friend&#x27;s backyard. Neel quit the band early on to pursue a career in the mortgage industry and Johnson would go on to attend the Trebas Institute of Recording Arts in Hollywood, California, where he learned to produce and engineer. On February 20, 2003, Derek Johnson was among the 100 killed in the nightclub fire while attending a Great White concert at The Station in West Warwick, Rhode Island.

Meanwhile, around 1988, high school friends Baldes (15 or 16 at the time) and Jeremy Popoff&#x27;s brother, A. Jay, (14 at the time) formed the pop metal band Razzle. The lineup being Kevin Baldes (lead vocals, bass), A. Jay Popoff (drums), and Sean Holland (guitar). They performed their first show on June 26, 1988, at The Troubadour. In 1989, A. Jay switched from drums to lead vocals, and the band added guitarist Jeremy Popoff and drummer Allen Shellenberger. Things began to come together in 1990, when the group released a demo tape (engineered by Derek Johnson, the singer of Strate Lace) and an EP entitled &quot;New Vibe Revolution&quot; in 1993. Razzle dissolved in 1993 and became Stain in 1994, which had a much harder and heavier sound. They released a demo tape in 1995 and eventually signed with Malicious Vinyl in 1995. After finding out the name &quot;Stain&quot; was already owned, the band changed their name to Lit.

===&quot;Tripping the Light Fantastic&quot; (1996–1997)===
On April 1, 1997, the group released &quot;Tripping the Light Fantastic&quot; on the Malicious Vinyl record label. Lit continued to grow their local and national fan base playing locally and touring with alternative bands such as Radish (Ben Kweller), Lifter and Reel Big Fish. Malicious Vinyl (owned by Hip Hop label Delicious Vinyl) lost its national distribution shortly after&quot;Tripping the Light Fantastic&quot; was released, which allowed the band to get out of their recording contract. They spent the next few months writing songs and showcasing for various major record labels. Lit signed with RCA Records in 1998.

===The RCA years and mainstream success (1998–2002)===
Lit gained worldwide popularity with their second album &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot;, released in February 1999. &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; yielded the massive hit single &quot;My Own Worst Enemy&quot;, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart for a total of 11 weeks and receiving a &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Award for the biggest modern rock song of 1999. It was followed by &quot;Zip-Lock&quot; (which featured Blink-182 in the video) and &quot;Miserable&quot;, which featured Pamela Anderson in the video. Shortly after, the album was certified platinum in the US and gold in Canada, becoming the band&#x27;s best selling album. The band performed over 286 shows and toured worldwide in support of &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot;. In addition to the Vans Warped Tour and a slot on Woodstock 1999, the band toured with the Offspring, Garbage, and No Doubt. The band&#x27;s tracks also appeared in soundtracks of &quot;Ready to Rumble&quot; and &quot;The Replacements&quot;, and appeared in the movie &quot;Replicate&quot; and the TV series &quot;V.I.P.&quot; starring Pamela Anderson. The band became staples on late night television shows The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien, Later with Craig Kilborn and appeared regularly on MTV TRL, Spring Break and guitarist Jeremy Popoff appeared in an episode of MTV Cribs.

Lit followed up &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; with the 2001 release of &quot;Atomic&quot;. The band&#x27;s highest-charting single was &quot;Lipstick and Bruises&quot; which reached top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Modern Rock Tracks. Lit toured to support &quot;Atomic&quot;, which began with a headlining US tour that scheduled to begin on September 11, 2001, in New Jersey, the same day as the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks. The band continued to tour, appear on television and movies, and also released two albums from Handsome Devil and The Color Red who the band signed to their Dirty Martini label, distributed by RCA.

===Self-titled album and death of Allen Shellenberger (2003–2009)===
Lit continued to tour the states, including several festivals, before the release of their self-titled &quot;Lit&quot; on the DRT Entertainment label on June 24, 2004. The single &quot;Looks Like They Were Right&quot; made it on the Top 40 charts. That year the group also put out its first long-form DVD, &quot;All Access&quot;, on November 16, 2004.

On May 5, 2008, Lit announced that drummer Allen Shellenberger was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Shellenberger immediately underwent clinical trials, chemotherapy and radiation at the Cedars-Sinai Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute. It was discovered that the tumor was malignant glioma and was incurable. His treatments were documented in a piece on &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; that aired in the same month. Lit canceled their scheduled tour dates with Kiss due to Shellenberger&#x27;s diagnosis. On July 26, 2008, Lit held a benefit concert for him at the House of Blues in Anaheim, California. A number of bands performed including Sugar Ray and Handsome Devil. Shellenberger&#x27;s last show with the band was September 28, 2008 at Paramount Studios for Paramount Rocks. He died from the cancer on August 13, 2009, at the age of 39.

On November 23, 2009, Lit played their first concert since Shellenberger&#x27;s death. Drum tech Nathan Walker, who had filled in for Shellenberger earlier that year, was now his successor on drums. They later announced that they had begun to work on a new album.

===&quot;The View from the Bottom&quot; (2010–2014)===
In April 2010 during an interview with OC Talk Radio, Lit hinted that they would return to a major label for their next release. They also revealed their work on a new management deal, as well as performing new material live. In September 2010, Kevin Baldes confirmed that Lit were in the studio, writing and recording their sixth studio album.

Lit announced in December 2011 that they were back in the studio with producer Butch Walker to finish their new album. It was also announced that the band had signed with Megaforce Records and would release their new album &quot;The View from the Bottom&quot; on June 19, 2012. The first single, &quot;You Tonight&quot;, was released on iTunes on May 1, 2012, and a video for &quot;The Broken&quot; was released in August 2012. On January 7, 2013, frontman A.

<text>F. J. McCormick (real name Peter Christopher Judge) (1 June 1890 in Skerries, Ireland – 24 April 1947 in Dublin, Ireland) was an Irish actor who became known for his work at Dublin&#x27;s Abbey Theatre. He acquired the stage name F.J. McCormick to disguise his identity from his current and future employers, and to avoid parental disapproval. He joined the Abbey at age 19, and acted in some 500 productions there. He is especially remembered for his work in the plays of Seán O&#x27;Casey.

== Early life and family ==
After living in Skerries in his early years, at age 10 he moved to Dublin and proceeded to live here for the majority of the duration of his life. He was educated locally in Skerries. His father, Michael Judge, was a maltser and later became a brewery manager. McCormick was of medium height, with &quot;expressive eyes&quot; and thick brown hair. As a young man, he began writing by contributing articles to the press. He worked briefly as a post office clerk in London but returned to Dublin to work as a junior clerk in the Civil Service. Eventually, he resigned from his public service career in 1918 and decided to embrace acting as a full time career as a member of the Abbey Theatre at age 19.

McCormick&#x27;s mother died when he was 2 years old. He and his family moved to Dublin when he was 10 or 12 years old. He was raised in Skerries and attended the Holy Faith Convent for primary education. McCormick described his childhood in Skerries &quot;as a very happy one&quot;. He married Eileen Crowe on 2 December 1925 in Rathdown. They met at the Abbey where Crowe was also an actor. In describing their performances together, De Burca wrote &quot;F.J McCormick and Eileen Crowe lived a life together of perfect bliss&quot;. The couple had two children, a son, David, and a daughter, Marie.

== Career ==
After moving briefly to London, McCormick returned to Dublin, where he worked in the Civil Service. He also took acting roles in the Workmen&#x27;s Club on York Street, and for the first time under the pseudonym by which he became known for roles with the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, Dublin. By May 1919, he had a leading role in an independent production at the Abbey Theatre (&quot;The Curate of St. Chad&#x27;s&quot; by Constance Powell Anderson). An attack on Irish acting by Edward Martyn was answered by McCormick in the pages of the journal &quot;Banba&quot; in June, 1921.

McCormick acted in over 500 plays at the Abbey Theatre, becoming particularly associated with the plays of Sean O&#x27;Casey staged there. From 1923–1925, he was also stage manager at the Abbey. Of his performance as Seumus Sheilds in &quot;The Shadow of a Gunman&quot;, O&#x27;Casey said that the actor had created a character greater than that O&#x27;Casey had written. He played Capt. Brennan in the filmed version of O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s &quot;The Plough and the Stars&quot; but it was his return to film in Carol Reed&#x27;s &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; (1947) that saw him singled out for praise in contemporaneous reviews. The &quot;Irish Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the acting of the Irish players was unremittingly professional, and, in the case of F. J. McCormick, as Shell, a weak-minded and elderly corner-boy, quite outstanding.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; of London found &quot;it is Mr. F. J. McCormick as a sly, bird-like creature, who stops just the right side of informing, who catches most surely at the imagination.&quot;

In their review of the film &quot;Hungry Hill&quot; (also 1947), &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;As the butler who served John Brodrick, his sons, and their sons in turn, the late F. J. McCormick is truly magnificent, giving an even more subtle portrayal of Irish character than he did as the wily tramp in &quot;Odd Man Out&quot;.&quot;

== Later life and death ==
In the last 5 years of McCormick’s life he continued to work in the Abbey where he acted in over 70 plays before he died. He only starred in one play in the theatre in the final year of his life, the play &quot;They Got What They Wanted&quot; playing the role of Bartley Murnaghan. He secured more leading roles in the film industry. McCormick died on the 24 April 1947 from a brain tumour at 56 years old, in Dublin. He is buried in Deansgrange, Blackrock. He continued to work right up until his death.

It is said that people regarded him as one of the greatest actors in his era. This comes from his work in 500 plays and 4 films over his career. A year after his passing in 1948 Barry Fitzgerald said he only knew of two actors with the gift that McCormick had and they were Charles Laughton and Charlie Chaplin.

== Legacy ==
There are many popular plays and films that McCormick was part of which are still remembered to this day by many, some of them include the original &quot;The Plough and the Stars&quot; in (1926) where he originated the role of Commandant Jack Clitheroe. He also played the role of Captain Brennan in the John Ford film version of the play in 1936. In his appreciation for McCormick, Gabriel Fallon remembered him as both a great actor and a great man.

It is said that he was one of the most versatile actors of his generation, his early death was a huge loss to the Irish arts and more specifically the Abbey Theatre where he carried most of his work.

<text>Sinj () is a town in the continental part of Split-Dalmatia County, Croatia. As of the 2021 census, the population was 23,500 people, of which 10,800 inhabited its urban core.

Sinj is known for a knights&#x27; tournament of Sinjska alka, which has been held since the beginning of the 18th century as a sign of victory over the Ottoman Empire, and for the shrine of Our Lady of Sinj. The urban center of Sinj is a protected cultural heritage site.

==Geography==

Sinj is located in Dalmatia, in the region historically known as &quot;Cetinska Krajina&quot;, a group of settlements situated around a fertile karstic field of Sinjsko Polje (300 m AMSL), once shaped by the flood waters of the Cetina river. The field lies between the mountains of Svilaja (1508 m), Dinara (1913 m), Kamešnica (1855 m) and Visoka (890 m). Further south, the mountain Mosor (1339 m) separates Sinj from the Adriatic sea. The mountains give Sinj its specific sub-Mediterranean climate, with a total annual rainfall of about 1300 mm. Winters are wet and cold, especially in the mornings, when temperatures can drop below -10 °C, whereas summers are hot and dry, with temperatures surpassing +40 °C. Partly due to its location in a valley, Sinj is one of the coldest Dalmatian towns in winter and one of the warmest in summer.

==History==
===Prehistory===
Several stone weapons and tools discovered in Cetinska Krajina attest to the area&#x27;s population dating back to the Mesolithic. Many caves and dugouts contain evidence of later Neolithic settlements. About 1000 years BC, the area was inhabited by the Illyrian tribe Dalmatae. They were settled in the area between the rivers of Krka and Cetina, where they clashed with the Romans in the period of wars from 156 BC to 9 AD, ending with their complete defeat under the leadership of Bato the Daesitiate.

===Roman era===
In Roman times, there were two important localities in the vicinity of Sinj: Colonia Claudia Aequum near today&#x27;s village of Čitluk, and Tilurium, today&#x27;s Gardun near Trilj.

Aequum was probably founded by Emperor Augustus as &quot;Oppidum Civium Romanorum&quot;. Among the various monuments, the famous statue of Hekate (Diana) and the head of Heracles were discovered there, which are kept in the archaeological collection of the Franciscan monastery. This is the birthplace of Roman general Sextus Julius Severus, who suppressed the Jewish uprising and destroyed Jerusalem in 135 AD.

During the long period of peace (Pax Romana), the Romans built roads in the area, fortified Osinium (Sinj), on Illyrian foundations, and Tilurium on the southernmost edge of the polje of Sinj; they built a bridge on Cetina (&quot;Pons Tilurii&quot;) and numerous villa rusticas. Tilurium was once home to the Roman 7th legion, followed by Roman auxiliary units.

Since the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476, the Cetina region had been ruled by the Byzantine Empire.

=== Arrival of Croats ===

It is unknown when the Croats settled in the area. The Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII mentions the County of Cetina among the Croatian administrative units in his 10th century&quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot;.

Over time, a settlement developed beneath the old fortress. It was initially referred to as &quot;Cetina,&quot; after the nearby river, but the name of the old town of Sinj was eventually transferred to it. Following the extinction of the Trpimirović dynasty in 1102, the country was united with Hungary under the Árpád dynasty, but Cetina was ruled almost independently by the Domaldo family, then by the powerful Croatian Šubić family from the end of the 13th century, falling under the rule of the Nelipić family in the middle of the 14th century. It was ruled by the Talovci family beginning in the middle of the 15th century, followed by general discord and internal conflicts until it fell to the Ottoman Turks.

===Ottoman and Venetian era===
In 1513 Sinj was conquered by the Ottoman army. It eventually lost its importance and became a small settlement on the road connecting Bosnia to the Adriatic Sea. Part of the Croatian population fled, part remained, and the smallest part converted to Islam. At the time, the fortress and its suburb had about a hundred houses and about a thousand inhabitants.

With the return of power of the Republic of Venice to nearby Fortress of Klis in 1648, Sinj regained its old importance as the last Turkish outpost towards the Venetian possessions. After several failed attempts to break free from Turkish rule, the new provisor Girolamo Cornaro with about 7,000 fighters captured the fortress on September 25, 1686.

Due to harsh living conditions and constant oppression under Ottoman rule, the domicile population declined, so Venetian authorities attempted to attract people from western Bosnia. The most massive migration took place in 1687, led by the Franciscans from the Rama monastery. In August 1715, during the Second Morean War, the Turks tried to retake Sinj and kept it under siege. The siege was unsuccessful, owing primarily to the collapse of Ottoman logistics, hunger and the outbreak of dysentery; on the night of August 15, the Turks fled to Livno. Contrary to popular belief, it appears that Venetian professional army units bore the majority of the burden in the conflict with Ottoman forces, rather than local fighters. The &quot;Diary of the Siege of Sinj&quot; is a written Venetian account of the events; no Turkish sources mentioning the siege or battle have been discovered thus far.

Following the Treaty of Požarevac in 1718, the entire region fell under the Venetian Republic. The period is considered one of poor prospects, although the town began to develop as a result of increased trade with Bosnia. The settlement was moved from the old and unsuitable fortress to the plain, where a new church, a monastery and the first residential houses were built soon after.

=== Austrian and French rule ===
The Republic of Venice and its possessions were abolished by the agreement between Napoleon and Holy Roman Empire (Austria) on October 17, 1797. Napoleon ceded the Venetian possessions to Austria, and in July the first Austrian troops arrived in Cetinska Krajina. This marked the beginning of the first Austrian occupation of Dalmatia, which would last for eight years. As a result of new Austrian policies, Sinj&#x27;s first public elementary school opened in 1798.

With the defeat in the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, Austria was forced to hand over all former Venetian possessions to Napoleon, giving the region a new master at the beginning of 1806. A tumultuous and significant period of French rule began that would last seven years. In 1811, the French established the Municipality of Sinj. The French administration canceled state subsidies wherever it was possible, thus canceling the support for Alka. Following Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in Russia and near Leipzig in 1813, the Austrian army reoccupied Dalmatia, and Sinj. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and until 1918, the town was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 13 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in the Kingdom of Dalmatia.

To get to know the newly acquired properties, Austrian Emperor Francis II takes a journey through Dalmatia in 1818, and visits Sinj. The people of Sinj use the opportunity to organize the tournament of Alka, which Francis II liked so much that he established a permanent annual financial support.

Despite Germanisation and Austrian bureaucracy, Sinj made significant progress under the Austrians. In 1854, the first public high school in Dalmatia with Croatian as the language of instruction was founded in Sinj by the Franciscan Province of Split. Due to its favorable strategic position, Sinj become an important Austrian military center in Dalmatia. The bridges over the Cetina river were built between 1849 and 1851; sewerage was installed in 1878, and by the end of the century, the town had taken on its current urban form; in 1891, an important tobacco trade center opened. With the town&#x27;s economic growth, which was based on trade with its neighbors and beyond, it was granted a railway connection to Split. In 1898, a major earthquake struck the town, causing widespread damage. In 1912, the town received a water supply system that provided drinking water from the Kosinac karst spring. The First World War began in 1914, with significant casualties in the Cetina region.

=== Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes ===

After the defeat of Austria in WWI, a new union was created in 1918, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. The new state under the rule of the Karađorđević dynasty failed to meet public expectations. When Stjepan Radić was assassinated in the National Assembly in Belgrade in 1928, the town sent an Alka delegation to his funeral in Zagreb. Between the two world wars, the town developed a vibrant and diverse cultural life: two amateur theater groups, large choirs, two brass bands, and a philharmonic orchestra were established, and a large number of local intellectuals received classical (est. 1854) and real (est. 1921) high school education.

The city center was first electrified around 1922.

=== Second World War ===
The town and nearby settlements were under the rule of military forces of the Independent State of Croatia, Italian, and German armies. This resulted in the spread of the idea of Partisan resistance, followed by frequent reprisals by the fascist regime against the local population. The people&#x27;s liberation army included approximately 500 soldiers from the town of Sinj. In total, 1338 partisans died in the fighting, 143 of whom were killed in the Battle on Sutjeska . The occupiers killed 1,888 people and set fire to 2,933 homes in 59 villages across the region. Eight partizans were declared National Heroes of Yugoslavia. In the famous Battle of the Neretva, nineteen-year-old Bruno Vuletić from Sinj commanded the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Dalmatian Brigade, some of which were the first to cross the collapsed bridge and attack the Axis-aligned Chetniks.

On October 25, 1944, the town was liberated by the forces of the 20th Division of the Yugoslav Army.

During the war, 479 residents of the Sinj region were interned in concentration camps, the majority of whom never returned. On April 22, 1945, Ante Bakotić from Sinj led the escape of male prisoners from the Jasenovac Concentration Camp, shortly before the end of WWII. Many of the 1,073 detainees at the time, including Bakotić, did not survive the flight.

=== Socialist Republic of Croatia ===

Following WWII, there was extensive work to increase literacy, emancipate women, and accelerate industrial development. Dalmatinka cotton processing factory was established in 1951, along with Trnovača agricultural plant, Cetinka factory, Naprijed wood processing company, and Autoprijevoz, a freight and bus transport company. Three hydroelectric plants were built along the Cetina river: Peruća (1960), Orlovac (1972), and Đale (1989). Comprehensive healthcare was established, and a health center with a maternity ward was built. A variety of sports, art, and technical clubs, as well as the town&#x27;s scout organization, were formed. In 1959, the town&#x27;s music school began offering lessons in solfeggio, piano, violin, and wind instruments.

The city was rapidly expanding through planned construction, which began with housing for workers at the newly established megafactory Dalmatinka; the town&#x27;s Olympic swimming pool was built in parallel with the building of the factory. Sinjski skojevci Elementary School opened (in 1977), as well as with a new large sports hall, a hotel, a hippodrome for the 1979 Mediterranean Games, and a large high school building. The construction of the Split-Zagreb state road (1963) improves traffic connections, but the narrow-gauge railway known as Sinjska rera, which connected the town to Split, was discontinued in 1962.

=== Independent Croatia ===

Since the summer of 1991, a large part of the old Municipality of Sinj was occupied, and Sinj was within artillery range of the rebel Serbs&#x27; positions, about 6 km away; some 3,000 shells were fired at the city. Along with the rest of Dalmatia, Sinj was cut off from the motherland in terms of transportation and energy.

In modern Croatia, Sinj has regressed economically: industry from the socialist period either collapsed or was destroyed by war and tycoon privatization during the war. Most of the economy consists of service activities. The city promotes the development of agriculture, transport, tourism, and industry, so far with limited success.

<text>Francisco Sánchez Gómez (; 21 December 194725 February 2014), known as Paco de Lucía (), was a Spanish virtuoso flamenco guitarist, composer, and record producer. A leading proponent of the new flamenco style, he was one of the first flamenco guitarists to branch into classical and jazz. Richard Chapman and Eric Clapton, authors of &quot;Guitar: Music, History, Players&quot;, describe de Lucía as a &quot;titanic figure in the world of flamenco guitar&quot;, and Dennis Koster, author of &quot;Guitar Atlas, Flamenco&quot;, has referred to de Lucía as &quot;one of history&#x27;s greatest guitarists&quot;.

De Lucía was noted for his fast and fluent picados (fingerstyle runs). A master of contrast, he often juxtaposed picados and rasgueados (flamenco strumming) with more sensitive playing and was known for adding abstract chords and scale tones to his compositions with jazz influences. These innovations saw him play a key role in the development of traditional flamenco and the evolution of new flamenco and Latin jazz fusion from the 1970s. He received acclaim for his recordings with flamenco singer Camarón de la Isla in the 1970s, recording ten albums which are considered some of the most important and influential in flamenco history.

Some of de Lucía&#x27;s best known recordings include &quot;Río Ancho&quot; (later fused with Al Di Meola&#x27;s &quot;Mediterranean Sundance&quot;), &quot;Entre dos aguas&quot;, &quot;La Barrosa&quot;, &quot;Ímpetu&quot;, &quot;Cepa Andaluza&quot; and &quot;Gloria al Niño Ricardo&quot;. His collaborations with guitarists John McLaughlin, Al Di Meola and Larry Coryell in the late 1970s saw him gain wider popularity outside his native Spain. De Lucía formed the Paco de Lucía Sextet in 1981 with his brothers, singer Pepe de Lucía and guitarist Ramón de Algeciras, and collaborated with jazz pianist Chick Corea on their 1990 album, &quot;Zyryab&quot;. In 1992, he performed live at Expo &#x27;92 in Seville and a year later on the Plaza Mayor in Madrid. He also collaborated with guitarist Juan d&#x27;Anyelica on his album Cositas Buenas. After 2004 he greatly reduced his public performances, retiring from full touring, and typically only gave several concerts a year, usually in Spain and Germany and at European festivals during the summer months.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Paco de Lucía was born on 21 December 1947 as Francisco Sánchez Gómez in Algeciras, province of Cádiz, in southern Spain. He was the youngest of the five children of flamenco guitarist Antonio Sánchez Pecino and Portuguese mother Lucía Gomes; his brothers include flamenco singer Pepe de Lucía and flamenco guitarist Ramón de Algeciras (now deceased).

Playing in the streets as a young boy, there were many Pacos and Pablos in Algeciras. In Spain and Latin America, any of these children with common first names would be referred to as follows: &#x27;&quot;Name of Child&quot;, (son or daughter) of &quot;Name of Mother&quot;&#x27;, or &quot;Paco (son) of Lucía&quot; in his case, instead of using the child&#x27;s last name. Later, after learning to play the guitar and tasked with figuring out a way to bill himself, wanting to honor his Portuguese mother Lucía Gomes, he adopted the stage name &quot;Paco de Lucía&quot;.

His father Antonio received guitar lessons from a cousin of Melchor de Marchena: Manuel Fernández (aka Titi de Marchena), a guitarist who arrived in Algeciras in the 1920s and established a school there. Antonio introduced Paco to the guitar at a young age and was extremely strict in his upbringing from the age of 5, forcing him to practice up to 12 hours a day, every day, to ensure that he could find success as a professional musician. At one point, his father took him out of school to concentrate solely on his guitar development. In a 2012 interview de Lucía stated that, &quot;I learned the guitar like a child learns to speak.&quot;

Flamenco guitarist and biographer Donn Pohren and record producer José Torregrosa compared Paco&#x27;s relationship with his father to the relationship of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Leopold Mozart in the way both fathers &quot;moulded their sons&quot; into becoming world-class musicians, and both continued to dictate even after the latter became famous.

Paco&#x27;s brother Ramón idolized Niño Ricardo, and taught his complex falsetas to his young brother, who would learn them with relative ease and change them to his own liking and embellish them. This initially angered Ramón, who considered Ricardo&#x27;s works to be sacred and thought his brother was showing off; but he soon began to respect his brother immensely, and came to realize that he was a prodigious talent, &quot;fuera de serie&quot; (out of the ordinary).

As also with Ramón, Ricardo was Paco&#x27;s most important influence, and his first guitar hero; Paco said &quot;all of us youngsters would look up to him, trying to learn from him and copy him.&quot; In 1958, at age 11, Paco made his first public appearance on Radio Algeciras. That year, he met Sabicas for the first time in Málaga. A year later, he was awarded a special prize at the Festival Concurso International Flamenco de Jerez de la Frontera flamenco competition.

===1960s===

At the age of 14 he made his first record with his brother Pepe, &quot;Los Chiquitos de Algeciras&quot; (&quot;The little ones from Algeciras&quot;). In the early 1960s, de Lucía toured with the flamenco troupe of dancer José Greco. In New York City in 1963, at the age of 15, he had his second encounter with Sabicas and his first encounter with Mario Escudero, both of whom became de Lucía&#x27;s mentors and later close friends. They urged him to start writing his own material, advice he took to heart. In 1964, he met Madrileño guitarist Ricardo Modrego with whom he recorded three albums: &quot;Dos guitarras flamencas&quot; (1964), &quot;12 canciones de García Lorca para guitarra&quot; and &quot;12 éxitos para 2 guitarras flamencas&quot; (1965).

His early albums were traditional flamenco recordings and he recorded classics such as &quot;Malagueña&quot; on the &quot;12 éxitos para 2 guitarras flamencas&quot; album. He toured again with José Greco in 1966 and recorded &quot;Ímpetu&quot;, a bulerías composed by Mario Escudero, for his debut solo album, &quot;La fabulosa guitarra de Paco de Lucía&quot; (1967). He appeared at the 1967 Berlin Jazz Festival. According to Gerhard Klingenstein, top jazz musicians who appeared at the festival (i.e. Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk), profoundly influenced de Lucía, and sparked a fascination for jazz that remained with him throughout his life.

In the late 1960s, de Lucía toured Europe with a group called Festival Flamenco Gitano and encountered other new talents in the flamenco world including singer Camarón de la Isla, with whom he enjoyed a fruitful collaboration between 1968 and 1977. They recorded ten albums together and received considerable acclaim. Richard Nidel said that their partnership was &quot;central to the history of flamenco in the last quarter of the twentieth century.&quot;

Organizers began offering de Lucía lucrative contracts for concert tours in 1967, which he declined as he preferred to tour in company, which he did with his brother Ramón, de la Isla and other musicians. De Lucía recorded many albums with his brother, including &quot;Canciones andaluzas para 2 guitarras&quot; (1967), &quot;Dos guitarras flamencas en América Latina&quot; (1967), &quot;Fantasía flamenca de Paco de Lucía&quot; (1969), and &quot;12 Hits para 2 guitarras flamencas y orquesta de cuerda&quot; (1969). They met Esteban Sanlucar in Buenos Aires and Juan Serrano in Detroit, and during 1970 spent considerable time in New York City where they grew close to Sabicas and Mario Escudero, playing together into the night.

===1970s===

De Lucía made a cameo appearance, dressed as a Mexican guitarist, in the 1971 western &quot;Hannie Caulder&quot;, playing the melody of Ken Thorne&#x27;s main theme over a string section. That year, he released the album &quot;El mundo del flamenco&quot;, which included a version of Mario Escudero&#x27;s &quot;Ímpetu&quot;, a bulerías. &quot;Guitar International&quot; mentioned his &quot;very aggressive&quot; approach to playing &quot;Ímpetu&quot;. Escudero was a major influence on de Lucía during this period, inspiring him to explore new possibilities for flamenco. He began working with record producer José Torregrosa.

De Lucía&#x27;s 1972 release &quot;El duende flamenco de Paco de Lucía&quot; was considered a groundbreaking album in the flamenco community. As the 1970s progressed, de Lucía continued to produce groundbreaking albums and ventured into an increasingly unconventional and innovative style of flamenco with jazz influences. His next release, &quot;Fuente y caudal&quot;, acclaimed particularly for his &quot;Entre dos aguas&quot;, which has become arguably his best-known composition, and also for &quot;Solera&quot; and &quot;Cepa Andaluza&quot;. &quot;Entre dos aguas&quot;, a rumba featuring bongos with an electric bass, means &quot;Between two waters&quot;, referring to his home town of Algeciras, where the Mediterranean meets the Atlantic. Biographer Pohren describes &quot;Cepa Andaluza&quot; as a &quot;phenomenal&quot; bulerías, which is &quot;accompanied by palmas, shouts of encouragement and general jaleo, and makes one want to leap up and dance.&quot; The album also features several other tracks named after Andalusian landmarks, a theme de Lucía continued in his later albums.

The &quot;Fuente y caudal&quot; album was one of the best-selling Spanish records for several months and de Lucía and Torregrosa found that the additional instruments and approach away from traditional flamenco proved more popular with the general public. The early influences of the traditional players became increasingly less apparent as de Lucía embraced jazz and other influences, creating his own voice and distinct style, yet never venturing too far from his roots.

On 18 February 1975, de Lucía became the first-ever flamenco performer to perform at the Teatro Real of Madrid. He played a set with his brother Ramón, in front of a relatively young audience without the use of effects. Pohren said that de Lucía&#x27;s performance &quot;was brilliant technically, and played a meaningful, moving, traditional brand of flamenco that did not betray what Paco had in store for the flamenco guitar in the future.&quot; The recording was released as &quot;En vivo desde el Teatro Real&quot;.

His 1976 album, &quot;Almoraima&quot;, was a wider success and featured &quot;Almoraima&quot; and &quot;Río Ancho&quot;. The album was named after a former convent of the same name located about from Algeciras on the road to Jimena de la Frontera, which had recently been converted into a hotel complex. The album featured significant Arabic and jazz influences especially in the bulerías composition of the same name; the name Almoraima is of Arabic origin from the Moorish period. De Lucía performed on an episode of &quot;Parkinson&quot; on BBC in the UK, in which Michael Parkinson said &quot;a marvelous young musician who is making his very first appearance on British television. His unconventional and modern approach to playing flamenco has already made him a big star in Europe, particularly in his native Spain.&quot;

In 1977, de Lucía married Casilda Varela, the daughter of General Varela and descendant to a powerful Basque industrialist Ampuero family; they had three children. He released his final album, &quot;Castillo de Arena&quot; with Camarón de la Isla, The lyrics were written by Antonio Sánchez, with the exception of the bulerías &quot;Samara&quot;, which Sánchez and de la Isla wrote together. This would be his last LP with a singer for at least 15 years. He reportedly said that the human voice is &quot;naturally too limited&quot; and that he prefers the exploration of different instrumentalists; he also said a busy schedule was the reason for lack of recordings with singers.

He performed extensively across the US and Europe during this period, increasing his popularity outside Spain and the flamenco community in Europe, and met many jazz, Latin and other musicians who continued to influence de Lucía&#x27;s evolution as a &quot;Nuevo flamenco&quot; player. He began to show a very keen interest in jazz fusion and rock, and in 1977 performed with Carlos Santana in the Plaza de toros de las Arenas bullring in Barcelona. He was invited by Al Di Meola to record on his &quot;Mediterranean Sundance&quot; piece for his album &quot;Elegant Gypsy&quot;. Despite considerable new interest in flamenco and de Lucía&#x27;s playing generated by the album, traditionalist flamenco critics did not approve of the piece and hated that many people considered &quot;Mediterranean Sundance&quot; flamenco music and frowned upon de Lucía. Di Meola informed the critics not to worry and that &quot;Paco is not leaving flamenco, but expanding it.&quot; In 1978, Paco and his brothers recorded &quot;Interpreta a Manuel de Falla&quot;, a classical effort of compositions by Manuel de Falla.

In 1979, de Lucía, John McLaughlin, and Larry Coryell formed The Guitar Trio and together made a tour of Europe and released a video recorded at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall entitled &quot;Meeting of the Spirits&quot;. Pohren said that de Lucía&#x27;s decision to work with musicians like McLaughlin, Di Meola, Coryell, and Chick Corea must have been an &quot;exciting and stimulating&quot; experience for him, given their technical musical knowledge and ability to improvise and said that they carried him &quot;so far afield that at times he must have been profoundly confused, a man running the risk of losing his musical identity.&quot; This concerned de Lucía, who said in a late 1990s interview, &quot;I have never lost the roots in my music, because I would lose myself. What I have tried to do is have a hand holding onto tradition and the other scratching, digging in other places, trying to find new things I can bring into flamenco.&quot;

===1980s===

The Guitar Trio continued touring in 1980, with Larry Coryell being replaced by Al Di Meola in 1981. De Lucía reportedly suffered from headaches and backaches while performing because he found it difficult to improvise and follow McLaughlin and Coryell&#x27;s advanced knowledge of jazz improvisation. Paco professed, &quot;Some people assume that they were learning from me, but I can tell you it was me learning from them. I have never studied music, I am incapable of studying harmony—I don&#x27;t have the discipline, playing with McLaughlin and Di Meola was about learning these things.&quot;

Also in 1981, The Guitar Trio released one of their most successful records, &quot;Friday Night in San Francisco&quot;, which sold over 1 million copies and generated a significant interest in flamenco music in America and Europe. It featured an extended combination of &quot;Mediterranean Sundance&quot; and &quot;Río Ancho&quot;; this became arguably the piece most associated with the musicians. De Lucía also formed the Paco de Lucía Sextet in 1981 (which included his brothers Ramón and Pepe), and released the first of its three albums that same year. On 30 August 1981, de Lucía performed a solo set at St. Goarshausen in Germany, where he performed &quot;Monasterio de Sal&quot; and &quot;Montino&quot; among others and later performed with The Guitar Trio. The event was broadcast on national WDR television.

Larry Coryell and John McLaughlin took part on the making of Paco de Lucía&#x27;s &quot;Castro Marín&quot; (1981). It was named after the hometown of Paco&#x27;s Portuguese mother, Luzia. Recorded at Tokyo in Dezember 1980, &quot;Castro Marín&quot; remains one of the most obscure titles in his catalogue. Coryell and Paco played as duo on the fifth track, &quot;Convite (Rumba)&quot;, and as a trio on the next track &quot;Palenque&quot;.

After &quot;Castro Marín&quot; came Paco&#x27;s revolutionary &quot;Sólo quiero caminar&quot; (1981). It was the very first to be recorded with Paco&#x27;s sextet, a group that brought into being a new way to play flamenco. One of the sextet&#x27;s major contributions was introducing the Peruvian cajón within a flamenco context. Percussionist Rubem Dantas came up with an original style of playing the instrument, one that became unique to flamenco. Largely due to &quot;Sólo quiero caminar&quot;, the cajón crossed over to other latin music styles, such as the tango and rumba.

In 1982, de Lucía put on a series of concerts with jazz pianist Chick Corea. Corea was a considerable influence on him in the 1980s and he and McLaughlin adapted a version of his piece &quot;Spain&quot;, performing it live together several times in the mid to late 1980s. He released a &quot;Golden&quot; double compilation album in 1982, &quot;La Guitarra de Oro de Paco de Lucía&quot;, covering de Lucía&#x27;s earliest recordings with Ricardo Modrego of Federico García Lorca songs to date, and featured two siguiriyas, a flamenco form in which he had not indulged in his recordings since 1972.

John McLaughlin, Al Di Meola and Paco de Lucía reconvened to record a studio album, &quot;Passion, Grace &amp; Fire&quot; (1983). In the Spanish remaster of the album, flamenco scholars José Manuel Gamboa and Faustino Nuñez weigh in their impressions on the liner notes. Though somewhat lacking the &quot;warmth&quot; of the live setting of their debut, &quot;Passion, Grace &amp; Fire&quot; is a more balanced effort. The three performers contributed with two compositions each.

Paco de Lucía had an acting role in Carlos Saura&#x27;s highly acclaimed film &quot;Carmen&quot;, for which he was also nominated for a BAFTA Film Award for Best Score. De Lucía composed original film scores for several films in the 1980s, including &quot;The Hit&quot;, a 1984 film in which he provided the soundtrack with Eric Clapton, with a minor contribution by Roger Waters.

On his 1984 album, &quot;Live... One Summer Night&quot;, de Lucía not only played guitar, but also filled the role of producer. Paco de Lucía has also appeared as himself on television in documentaries and TV shows and accepted a position as a judge at Seville&#x27;s 1984 Bienal de Flamenco.

By the mid-1980s, both the Sextet and the Guitar Trio had reached its plateau and stopped performing together, although de Lucía would continue to perform with McLaughlin as a duo across Europe in 1986 and later. In a 1986 interview with &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine, Di Meola said that the reason for the breakdown was that their performances were designed to &quot;drive the audience berserk&quot; with a display of astonishing virtuosity and that they had run out of new spectacular fast runs to impress the audiences. Di Meola remarked that the music had become too &quot;wild and crazy&quot; and that he preferred to explore the quieter side of music, something Paco also felt, saying that he preferred &quot;controlled expression to velocity.&quot; In May 1986, he performed at the Centro de Bellas Artes Rock music festival alongside the likes of Earl Klugh, Spyro Gyra, and Dave Valentin.

In 1987, de Lucía performed for the first time in the Soviet Union, and went back to his roots with his highly successful release, &quot;Siroco&quot;. &quot;Siroco&quot; is often cited as his best album and one of the greatest flamenco albums of all time.

His compositions &quot;La Cañada&quot;, the opening track, a tango called &quot;La Barrosa&quot;, an alegrías named after the Playa la Barrosa in the province of Cadiz, and &quot;Gloria al Niño Ricardo&quot;, a soléa, received considerable attention and are considered modern flamenco classics. Eric Clapton and Richard Chapman described &quot;La Barrosa&quot;, a sweet alegrías played in B major, as, &quot;full of effortless delicacy with cascading phrases.&quot; &quot;Gloria al Niño Ricardo&quot; is dedicated to Niño Ricardo who was de Lucía&#x27;s &quot;first hero&quot; of the guitar. Several of his compositions from &quot;Siroco&quot; formed the staple of de Lucía&#x27;s later concert performances, and he often began his concerts with &quot;La Cañada&quot;.

In 1989, de Lucía refused to perform at the bullring in Seville with Plácido Domingo and Julio Iglesias.

===1990s===

Although the sextet had declined after 1986, in 1990 they got together to record &quot;Zyryab&quot;, a groundbreaking Arabic flamenco/jazz album with jazz pianist Chick Corea and fellow virtuoso flamenco guitarist Manolo Sanlúcar. The album is named after Ziryab, an 8th–9th century Shiraz-born poet/musician at the Umayyad court in Córdoba, credited with introducing to Spain the Persian lute, which evolved into the Spanish guitar—and according to some, established flamenco itself. One track on the album, a tarantas, is dedicated to Sabicas. The album was critically well-received; &quot;JazzTimes&quot; praised the passion and rhythm of the musicians featuring on the album.

Until asked to perform and interpret Joaquín Rodrigo&#x27;s &quot;Concierto de Aranjuez&quot; in 1991, de Lucía was not proficient at reading musical notation. Biographer Pohren, however, at the time of writing his biography in 1992, said that he was still not proficient and had found a bizarre way of learning the piece, locking himself away.

His performance with the orchestra under Edmon Colomer was highly acclaimed, a sensitive, atmospheric rendition that composer Rodrigo himself praised, describing it as &quot;pretty, exotic, inspired ... I might add that Paco plays it with a great deal of feeling, far more than is normally heard. And that goes for the orchestra that backs him up.&quot; In 1992, he performed live at the bullring at Seville Expo &#x27;92, and a year later on the Plaza Mayor in Madrid, playing &quot;La Barrosa&quot;. In 1995, he and Bryan Adams recorded the hit song and video &quot;Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?&quot; on the soundtrack for the American film &quot;Don Juan DeMarco&quot;.

In 1996, his first &quot;golden hits&quot; album, &quot;Antología&quot;, was in the top 20 in Spain for at least 16 weeks, selling over 65,000 copies. In 1997, de Lucía performed in a tribute show to the assassinated Spanish politician Miguel Ángel Blanco, alongside Julio Iglesias, Los del Rio, and other musicians. In 1998 he released and produced &quot;Luzia&quot;, dedicated to his dying mother (hence the Portuguese spelling of her name). It is considered to be one of de Lucía&#x27;s most complete and mature artistic statements.

===2000–14===

De Lucía lived for five years in Quintana Roo, Mexico, but returned to his native Spain in 2003 after professing to have become really tired with spending his whole life touring for six to eight months a year, getting up at the crack of dawn and living in hotels. He continued to keep a holiday home in Mexico though and regularly visited with his family.

In 2004 he toured the United States and Canada with Seville flamenco singer La Tana, but subsequently greatly reduced his live performances in public. He retired from full touring, and would only give a few concerts a year, usually in Spain and Germany and at European festivals during the summer months. Pohren described de Lucía as &quot;extremely timid and retiring&quot;, saying that, &quot;Being a very private person, [he] was dismayed at the ensuing popularity and lionization, and the increased pressure fame placed upon his shoulders, demanding that he constantly innovate and work harder to achieve technical and revolutionary perfection.&quot;

In 2003, de Lucía released &quot;Integral&quot; (2003), a 26CD Limited Edition Box Set, and &quot;Por Descubrir&quot;, a compilation album. In 2004, de Lucía released &quot;Cositas Buenas&quot; with Javier Limón. It was released on Blue Thumb Records by Universal Music Spain S.L., and features four bulerías, two rumba tracks, a tangos and a tientos. It won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Flamenco Album in 2004 and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Award for Latin Jazz Album of the Year in 2005.

In 2005, he was nominated for producer of the year by the Latin Grammy for La Tana&#x27;s &quot;Tu, Ven a Mi&quot;, which was de Lucía&#x27;s first recording where he directed another artist since working on Camarón de la Isla&#x27;s &quot;Potro de rabia y miel&quot;.

In 2004, he won the Prince of Asturias Awards in Arts, and on 23 March 2007, the University of Cadiz recognized de Lucía&#x27;s musical and cultural contributions by conferring on him the title of Doctor Honoris Causa. In 2010, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Berklee College of Music in Boston, and performed at the Montreux Festival. He was also known for some years to select countries where he did not usually perform, and played at the Arena in Pula, Croatia in 2006 and 2010, and in Turkey, Morocco and Tunisia in 2013. He appeared at the 49th Carthage International Festival on 31 July, playing at the Roman Theatre.

===Death===

De Lucía died of a heart attack on 25 February 2014, while on holiday with his family in Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo, Mexico. While playing soccer with his son on the beach, he asked his wife to take him to the hospital because he felt a &quot;strange coolness in his throat.&quot; He was taken to a hospital and was able to enter the emergency room on his own, but had to be helped into a gurney. Soon after, he lost consciousness and died.

His brother Pepe commented that de Lucía had quit a two-pack a day smoking habit 20 days earlier, and vowed to take up more sports activity after the death of his friend Félix Grande. His remains are buried at the municipal cemetery of his hometown Algeciras, Andalucía. De Lucía posthumously won the Latin Grammy Award for Album of the Year for his album &quot;Canción Andaluza&quot; at the 2014 awards ceremony. Shortly after his passing, the regional government of the Community of Madrid announced that the new northern terminus of Line 9 of the city&#x27;s Metro system would be named after him as a tribute.

==Legacy==

De Lucía was widely considered to be the world&#x27;s premier flamenco guitarist and by many to be Spain&#x27;s greatest musical export. He had a revolutionary influence on flamenco music both as a composer and otherwise. His influence on flamenco guitar has been compared with that of Andrés Segovia&#x27;s on classical guitar.

His album &quot;Fuente y caudal&quot; (&quot;Fountain and Flow&quot;) has been cited by many to have changed the world of flamenco guitar beyond traditional flamenco culture. Along with Enrique Morente and Camarón de la Isla, de Lucía was the first artist to break away from traditional flamenco and form what is now known as &quot;nuevo flamenco&quot;. As a composer, de Lucía was the first Spanish artist to mix jazz with Andalusian music in a more or less systematic way. This includes, but is not limited to, his collaborations with Di Meola, McLaughlin, and Pedro Iturralde.

Esteban de Sanlúcar and Mario Escudero were also major influences on him and sources of inspiration. According to biographer Pohren, de Lucía was &quot;fascinated with jazz&quot; and held a deep respect for high-tech jazz musicians, regarding Di Meola, McLaughlin, Coryell and Corea as highly as musicians as he did his flamenco mentors. Despite these influences, according to the &quot;Jazz Times&quot;, &quot;Most flamenco fans can trace the music&#x27;s history to either Before Paco or After Paco.&quot; In 2004 interview with &quot;El País&quot; he said &quot;I have always found that the more technique you have the easier it is to express yourself. If you lack technique you lose the freedom to create.&quot; Like many other flamenco guitarists he often played a Hermanos Conde guitar and had his own signature model, but had a range of guitars in his collection.

Richard Chapman and Eric Clapton describe de Lucía as a &quot;titanic figure in the world of flamenco guitar&quot;, highlighting his &quot;astounding technique and inventiveness&quot; and his broad range of musical ideas from other styles, such as Brazilian music and jazz. He is noted for his innovation and colour in harmony and his remarkable dexterity, technique, strength and fluidity in his right hand, capable of executing extremely fast and fluent picados. A master of contrast, he often juxtaposes picados with rasgueados and other techniques and often adds abstract chords and scale tones to his compositions with jazz influences.

Bill Milkowski of &quot;DownBeat&quot; described him as &quot;the portrait of studied concentration and pristine perfection: stiff backed and stern faced, with a distinguished air about him that some might misread as haughtiness. He&#x27;s proud and majestic, like a regal Arabian steed prancing with grace and elegance, yet able to reveal great power.&quot; Craig Harris of AllMusic noted his &quot;deeply personal melodic statements and modern instrumentation.&quot; &quot;Atlanta&quot; magazine said, &quot;The guitar, when used properly, can be one of the most haunting and beautiful instruments to create sound ... when he brushes his fingers across the strings, [he] can create some of the most incredible music. It&#x27;s almost like a lullaby.&quot;

José Luis Acosta, president of the Spanish Artists and Editors Society stated that &quot;Paco was and will be a universal artist, who took the guitar and flamenco sentiment to the heart of the whole world.&quot; In 2015, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine named de Lucía as one of The 30 Most Influential Latin Artists of All Time, an editor writes: &quot;The virtuoso instrumentalist popularized flamenco worldwide, and brought the Spanish sound to the forefront of avant-garde jazz.&quot;. In the same year, he was posthumously inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame for his contributions to flamenco music. On 21 December 2016, Google commemorated the anniversary of de Lucía&#x27;s birth with a Google Doodle created by Google artist Sophie Diao that was shown in Spain, Mexico, and several South American nations.

Another of Paco de Lucía&#x27;s contributions was the inclusion of the cajón, an Afro-Peruvian instrument Caitro Soto exposed to him during his visit to Peru in the late 1970s. He understood this instrument, which he saw as a permanent solution to the need for percussion in flamenco. Along with Rubem Dantas, he added its percussive elements and it became an essential tool of contemporary flamenco and later, other international musical trends.

A statue is dedicated to his memory in his native city of Algeciras, overlooking the harbour.

<doc id="1007767" wikidata="Q1179504" url="?curid=1007767" title="DeFord Bailey">
<text>DeFord Bailey (December 14, 1899 – July 2, 1982) was an American old-time musician and songwriter considered to be the first African American country music star. He started his career in the 1920s and was one of the first performers to be introduced on Nashville radio station WSM&#x27;s Grand Ole Opry, and becoming, alongside Uncle Dave Macon, one of the program&#x27;s most famous performers. He was the first African-American performer to appear on the show, and the first performer to record his music in Nashville. Bailey played several instruments in his career but is best known for playing the harmonica, often being referred to as a &quot;harmonica wizard&quot;.

Bailey was born and raised in Tennessee, all his family played &quot;black hillbilly&quot; country and blues music and he learned how to play the harmonica and mandolin while recuperating from polio as a young child. He moved from New York to Nashville with relatives in his late teens and was a significant early contributor to Nashville&#x27;s burgeoning music industry. Among the first generation of entertainers to perform live on the radio, his recorded compositions were well-known and popular.

Bailey toured and performed with Roy Acuff and many well-known country artists during the 1930s. But as a result of the 1941 royalties disagreement between Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) and American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), he was fired by WSM and stopped making his living as an entertainer. Afterwards, he supported himself and his family by opening a shoe shining company and renting out rooms in his home. He returned to sporadic public performances in 1974 when he was invited to participate in the Opry&#x27;s first Old-Timers show and in 2005 was posthumously inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Deford Bailey was born on December 14, 1899, near the Bellwood community in Carthage, Smith County, Tennessee. At least one of his grandfathers had been enslaved. All of his family was involved in music. A grandfather was a fiddler, and his mother, who died when he was about a year old, played guitar. Another brother learned banjo. Bailey suffered from polio, then called infant paralysis, and was taken in by an aunt named Barbara Lou. He learned to play the harmonica and mandolin at the age of three when he contracted polio. While he was ill, Bailey was confined to bed for a year and could only move his head and arms. His style of playing the harmonica took root during that time, as he imitated the sounds of the natural world around him and of the trains traveling through the countryside. Though Bailey did recover from his bout with polio, there were some long-term consequences. His back remained slightly misshapen, and he only grew to be 4 feet, 10 inches. He was so short and slender as a teenager that he was mistaken to be an underage child by railroad ticket agents. His foster father, Clark Odom, was hired as a manager for a farm near Nashville, and in 1908 the family made the move from Smith County. The Odoms and their foster son lived on Nashville and Franklin Tennessee farms Clark Odom managed for several years. In 1918, the family moved to Nashville when Clark Odom got a city job, and Bailey started to perform locally there as an amateur.

==Career==
Bailey&#x27;s first radio appearance was apparently in September 1925 on Fred Exum&#x27;s WDAD, a Nashville station that only lasted from 1925 until sometime in 1927. His first documented appearances, however, were in 1926 according to &quot;The Nashville Tennessean&quot; including WDAD on January 14 and WSM on June 19. On December 10, 1927, he debuted his trademark song, &quot;Pan American Blues&quot; (named for the Louisville and Nashville Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Pan-American&quot;), on a program then known as the &quot;WSM Barn Dance&quot;. At that time &quot;Barn Dance&quot; aired after NBC&#x27;s classical music show, the &quot;Music Appreciation Hour&quot;. While introducing Bailey, WSM station manager and announcer George D. Hay exclaimed on-air, &quot;For the past hour, we have been listening to music largely from Grand Opera, but from now on, we will present &#x27;The Grand Ole Opry.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Pan American Blues&quot; was the first recording of a harmonica blues solo.

Several records by Bailey were issued in 1927 and 1928, all of them harmonica solos. In 1927 he recorded for Brunswick Records in New York City, In 1928 he made the first recordings in Nashville, eight sides for RCA Victor, three of which were issued on the Victor, Bluebird, and RCA labels. Emblematic of the ambiguity of Bailey&#x27;s position as a recording artist is the fact that his arguably greatest recording, &quot;John Henry&quot;, was released by RCA separately in both its &quot;race&quot; series and its &quot;hillbilly&quot; series. In addition to his well-known harmonica, Bailey also played the guitar, bones, and banjo.

Bailey was a pioneer member of the WSM &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; and one of its most popular performers, appearing on the program from 1927 to 1941. During this period he toured with major country stars, including Uncle Dave Macon, Bill Monroe, and Roy Acuff. Acuff later said &quot;I was an unknown when I began touring with DeFord. He could draw a crowd, not me. He helped me get started.&quot; Bailey&#x27;s own article at the Country Music Hall of Fame called him &quot;one of the Grand Ole Opry&#x27;s most popular early performers and country music&#x27;s first African American star.&quot; Like other Black stars of his day traveling in the Southern United States and Western United States, he faced difficulties in finding food and accommodations while on tour because of discriminatory Jim Crow laws.

Bailey was fired by WSM in 1941 because of a licensing conflict between BMI and ASCAP, which prevented him from playing his best-known tunes on the radio. When he was let go from the Opry, that effectively ended his performance and recording career. Bailey then spent the rest of his life running his own shoeshine stand and renting out rooms in his home to make a living. Though he continued to play the harmonica, he rarely performed publicly. One of his rare performances occurred in 1974, when he agreed to appear on the Opry. This was a special event to mark the Opry leaving the Ryman Auditorium for the Grand Ole Opry House. This performance became the impetus for the Opry&#x27;s annual Old Timers&#x27; Shows.

Afterwards, Bailey continued to perform at the Opry only occasionally. He played there on his 75th birthday in December 1974, at the Old Timers Shows, and also in April 1982. A few months later that year, in June, he was taken to Nashville&#x27;s Baptist Hospital in failing health. Bailey died from kidney and heart failure on July 2, 1982, at his daughter&#x27;s home in Nashville, and is buried in Greenwood Cemetery there.

==Family==
Bailey&#x27;s family were also in the music business. His son, also named DeFord Bailey and called DeFord Bailey Jr was a well-known musician in Nashville. At one time his band included Jimi Hendrix as a guitarist. Bailey&#x27;s grandson, Carlos DeFord Bailey, has performed at the Grand Ole Opry.

==Influence and posthumous accolades==
Bailey himself said that he came from a tradition of &quot;black hillbilly music&quot;. His family members had played a variety of instruments, including a grandfather who had been a well-known local fiddler in Smith County, Tennessee. He said later when referring to playing the harmonica when he was growing up &quot;Oh, I wore it out trying to imitate everything I hear! Hens, foxes, hounds, turkeys, and all those trains and things on the road. Everything around me.&quot;

 Along with performing well-known genre classics such as &quot;Cow-Cow Blues&quot;, Bailey also wrote his own signature Opry songs, like the train-imitating &quot;Pan American Blues&quot; and the &quot;Dixie Flyer Blues&quot;. When WSM&#x27;s power increased to 50,000 watts, Bailey&#x27;s influence also increased, with harmonica enthusiasts listening to his performances and studying his recordings.

2005 Nashville Public Television produced the documentary &quot;DeFord Bailey: A Legend Lost&quot;. The documentary was broadcast nationally through PBS. Bailey was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame on November 15, 2005. The DeFord Bailey Tribute Garden at the George Washington Carver Food Park in Nashville was dedicated on June 27, 2007. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Country Music&quot; called him &quot;the most significant black country star before World War II.&quot; Bailey is still being referred to as a &quot;harmonica wizard&quot; more than three decades after his death.

<text>Cape Virgenes () is the southeastern promontory of continental Argentina in South America. A little to the south-west,the southernmost point of land is Punta Dúngeness. Ferdinand Magellan reached it on 21 October 1520 during the Spanish expedition to East Asia and discovered a strait, now called the Strait of Magellan in his honor. As 21 October was the feast day of Saint Ursula and the Eleven Thousand Virgins, he named the cape in their honor.

Its location is the southern 52nd parallel and is an approximate antipode to Amsterdam (located at the 52nd parallel of the northern hemisphere).

The Cape is located in Santa Cruz Province, Patagonia, Argentina. The Cape Virgenes Argentine Lighthouse has been operating since 1904. In 1884, gold was found there sparking the Tierra del Fuego gold rush. Recently, rises in the number of southern right whales visiting the area have been confirmed.

<text>Ormond College is the largest of the residential colleges of the University of Melbourne located in the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It is home to around 350 undergraduates, 90 graduates and 35 professorial and academic residents.

==History==

===Beginnings (1853)===
The University of Melbourne was established by an act of the Parliament of Victoria in 1853. were set aside for residential colleges, of which each were allotted to the Anglican, Presbyterian, Methodist and Roman Catholic denominations. The Presbyterian allotment became Ormond College. 

At the end of August 1877, Alexander Morrison, headmaster of Scotch College and convener of the Presbyterian Church assembly&#x27;s committee to &quot;watch over the land&quot;, received a letter from the director of the Victorian Education Department, proposing that if the church did not mean to take the land for a college, that it be sold and the proceeds divided, half to the church and half to the state for university purposes. This spurred Morrison into action. A subscription list was opened, with a target of £10,000; on this list Francis Ormond&#x27;s name appears against a donation of £3,000. 

The General Assembly meeting in November 1877 resolved that the church should immediately proceed with the building of a college and that £10,000 be raised for the purpose, that the buildings be used as a college of residence for university students and as a theological school. Immediate steps were taken to raise the money. In the course of three years, some £38,000 were raised, of which Francis Ormond contributed £22,571. The foundation stone of the college (now lost) was laid by the Governor of Victoria, George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby, on 15 November 1879. The formal opening of the college took place on 18 March 1881. At this ceremony it was announced that Francis Ormond had offered to bear the whole cost of the remainder of the planned buildings.

On opening there were 20 students, soon growing to 24. Ormond College was unique amongst University of Melbourne colleges in welcoming students of all faiths and none, a philosophy built upon the Scottish Enlightenment tradition. Students of other Christian denominations, Jewish students and others were welcomed and this has become a cornerstone of the college&#x27;s inclusive ethos.
In honour of the silver jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887, Francis Ormond funded the building of the Victoria Wing which came into use in 1889. In 1893 the dining hall, kitchens, staff quarters and the original master&#x27;s residence (Allen House) were opened. The neo-Gothic dining hall is reminiscent of an Oxbridge building and is often compared to Hogwarts from J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. A Hogwarts-themed episode of &quot;MasterChef&quot; was filmed there in 2013.

===Rapid growth (1880s)===

The rapid growth of the college soon outstripped the available accommodation and Francis Ormond provided funds for the southwest wing, together with a temporary building (which was, however, stone-walled and tin-roofed) where the cloisters now are, which served as kitchens and a dining hall. The next addition to the buildings of the college was the Wyselaskie building, which was completed in March 1887. John Dickson Wyselaskie was a Western District squatter, who also gave generously to the Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College. The building contained a lecture hall and two residences for theological professors and was adapted and divided in 1968 so as to provide for four residences. On 6 July 1887, the portrait of Francis Ormond, which now hangs above the college&#x27;s dining hall door, was unveiled by Sir James McBain.

In honour of the silver jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887, Francis Ormond funded the building of the Victoria Wing which came into use in 1889. In 1893 the dining hall, kitchens, staff quarters and the original lodge (Allen House) were opened. On either side of the end window of the hall are effigies representing Francis and Mary Ormond.

===Post WWII expansion (1950s)===


The period after World War II saw great demands for accommodation; for the first time the college passed 150 students. Following an appeal for funds in 1949, a series of improvements were made to Main Building. The kitchens were extensively modernised and general maintenance was brought up to date after the lag resulting from the Depression of the 1930s and the shortages of men and material during and after the War. In 1955, a squash court was built to commemorate the Ormond men who died in the Second World War. A new Master&#x27;s residence was designed by the prominent architects Grounds, Romberg and Boyd and was completed in 1958. At the same time, a permanent residence was provided for the Vice-Master by the conversion of a rooms of the old lodge (Allen House) and the addition of a semi-circular cream brick building.

===Innovation (1960s)===
During the 1960s the college continued to work with Grounds, Romberg and Boyd to create ground-breaking buildings. In the vacation of 1960–61 a new domestic wing was built to accommodate the extra staff and facilities required for the larger college planned for 1962. The three octagon-shaped buildings that constitute Picken Court were built during 1961 and were ready for occupation in 1962, providing accommodation for around 100 students and eight tutors. The chancellor of the university, Sir Arthur Dean, opened the building in March 1962.

New premises for the MacFarland Library were built in 1965, which were combined with a new theological hall common room. The former library became the chapel, the official opening of which took place on 19 March 1967. For the first time the college had its own place of worship, as befits a church foundation. In 1982 the library was reorganised, separating the Ormond College and Joint Theological College collections.

In 1968, a striking and bold building was opened in the south-east corner of the college grounds in the style later named brutalism. The chancellor of the university, Sir Robert Menzies, officially opened the southeast building and named it McCaughey Court after the master, Davis McCaughey. This building, which caused much comment, won awards for the architects Romberg and Boyd.

===Sexual assault allegations (1991)===
Ormond College was embroiled in controversy in 1991 over allegations that the master of the college had sexually assaulted two female students at a Valedictory party and that the college council had dismissed these complaints out of hand. The master was convicted of one charge of assault, however the conviction was later overturned on appeal, though he resigned his position. The events of this controversy were written into a 1995 book by Helen Garner, &quot;The First Stone&quot;, which itself was embroiled in controversy over bias toward the master, its criticism of third wave feminism and fictionalisation of various events and circumstances. Since this case, Ormond College has reformed its procedures in regards to sexual harassment and assault.

===21st century ===
In 2009, Rufus Black was appointed master of Ormond College. An ethicist and Rhodes scholar, Black ushered in a new era of change and development. In that year, Ormond launched an Indigenous program which supported Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students to live at Ormond and study at the University of Melbourne.

The college developed also major new facilities during this period. In 2010 the junior common room was redeveloped into cafe style space and lounge. In May 2011 the college opened a $4m student academic centre, containing several formal and informal learning spaces along with the college library and information technology facilities. Since 2010 the college has expanded its undergraduate facilities by creating a series of loft rooms in its main building and McCaughey Court. The college has also developed a cohort of graduate students in its two dedicated graduate buildings opened in 2014 and 2015.

In 2016, the college opened the Wade Institute of Entrepreneurship. Established with a gift from entrepreneur Peter Wade, the institute delivers programs for investors, entrepreneurs and schools, including a new University of Melbourne Masters of Entrepreneurship. The degree is a collaboration between Ormond and the university&#x27;s Faculty of Business and Economics and its School of Engineering. The building is designed along &quot;passivhaus&quot; principles, by Melbourne architectural firm Lovell Chen.

In 2018, Lara McKay became master of Ormond.

==Admission of women==
From the beginning Ormond accepted women as non-residents, able to attend tutorials and participate in college life whilst living offsite with funding from the college. Female students were amongst its most notable early scholars. Later, from 1968 to 1972, female students were able to live in college in return for waiting duties and attend tutorials; they were admitted as members of the Ormond College Students&#x27; Club in 1969. In 1973, Ormond accepted women students as residents for the first time. Women quickly rose to leadership roles in both the staff and student bodies including being elected chair of the students&#x27; club and appointed to the role of vice-master (deputy head of college).

==Renate Kamener Oration==

Renate Kamener (8 June 1933 – 12 March 2009) was a German-born Jew whose family escaped before the Holocaust and settled in South Africa, where she became a teacher. She and her husband Bob were active in the anti-apartheid movement and migrated to Australia in 1965, where after teaching English for some time she became head of Humanities at Swinburne Technical College. She was dedicated to peace and social justice, and founded Salaam-Shalom, a Muslim-Jewish women&#x27;s group that promoted dialogue and friendship.

To honour her memory, the Kamener Family set up the Renate Kamener in collaboration with Ormond College, &quot;to help and encourage Indigenous students to achieve their tertiary education ambitions&quot;. It is funded mainly by the annual Renate Kamener Oration, managed by volunteers, and held in the Past speakers at the oration include:

<doc id="1007781" wikidata="Q277452" url="?curid=1007781" title="Ebstein's anomaly">
<text>Ebstein&#x27;s anomaly is a congenital heart defect in which the septal and posterior leaflets of the tricuspid valve are displaced downwards towards the apex of the right ventricle of the heart. EA has great anatomical heterogeneity that generates a wide spectrum of clinical features at presentation and is complicated by the fact that the lesion is often accompanied by other congenital cardiac lesions. It is classified as a critical congenital heart defect accounting for less than 1% of all congenital heart defects presenting in around 1 per 200,000 live births. Ebstein&#x27;s anomaly usually presents with a systolic murmur (sometimes diastolic) and frequently with a gallop rhythm.

==Signs and symptoms==
The annulus of the valve is still in the normal position. The valve leaflets, however, are to a varying degree, attached to the walls and septum of the right ventricle. A subsequent &quot;atrialization&quot; of a portion of the morphologic right ventricle (which is then contiguous with the right atrium) is seen. This causes the right atrium to be large and the anatomic right ventricle to be small in size.
* S3 heart sound
* S4 heart sound
* Triple or quadruple gallop due to widely split S1 and S2 sounds plus a loud S3 and/or S4
* Systolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation = Holosystolic or early systolic murmur along the lower left sternal border depending on the severity of the regurgitation
* Right atrial hypertrophy
* Right ventricular conduction defects
* Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome often accompanies

===Related abnormalities===

While Ebstein&#x27;s anomaly is defined as the congenital displacement of the tricuspid valve towards the apex of the right ventricle, it is often associated with other abnormalities.

====Anatomic abnormalities====
Typically, anatomic abnormalities of the tricuspid valve exist, with enlargement of the anterior leaflet of the valve. The other leaflets are described as being plastered to the endocardium.
Tethering the underlying ventricular wall is the most common for the posterior and septal leaflets, and sail-like anterior leaflets may be tethered to the RV free wall also.

About 50% of individuals with Ebstein&#x27;s anomaly have an associated shunt between the right and left atria, either an atrial septal defect or a patent foramen ovale.

====Electrophysiologic abnormalities====
About 50% of individuals with Ebstein&#x27;s anomaly have an accessory pathway with evidence of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, secondary to the atrialized right ventricular tissue. This can lead to abnormal heart rhythms including atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia.
Other abnormalities that can be seen on the ECG include:
# signs of right atrial enlargement or tall and broad &#x27;Himalayan&#x27; P waves
# first degree atrioventricular block manifesting as a prolonged PR-interval
# low amplitude QRS complexes in the right precordial leads
# atypical right bundle branch block
# T wave inversion in V1-V4 and Q waves in V1-V4 and II, III and aVF.

==Risk factors==
An enlargement of the aorta may occur; an increased risk of abnormality is seen in babies of women taking lithium during the first trimester of pregnancy (though some have questioned this) and in those with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

==Diagnosis==
An echocardiogram is the most common and specific way to diagnose Ebstein’s anomaly because it effectively shows all 4 chambers of the heart, which displays the distance between the hinge point of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve and the anterior leaflet of the mitral valved (displacement index) to determine if the value is greater than 8mm/m2.

==Treatment==

===Medication===
Ebstein&#x27;s cardio physiology typically presents as an (antidromic) AV reentrant tachycardia with associated pre-excitation. In this setting, the preferred medication treatment agent is procainamide. Since AV-blockade may promote conduction over the accessory pathway, drugs such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin are contraindicated.

If atrial fibrillation with pre-excitation occurs, treatment options include procainamide, flecainide, propafenone, dofetilide, and ibutilide, since these medications slow conduction in the accessory pathway causing the tachycardia and should be administered before considering electrical cardioversion. Intravenous amiodarone may also convert atrial fibrillation and/or slow the ventricular response.

===Surgery===
The Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) recommends surgical intervention for these indications:
* Limited exercise capacity (NYHA III-IV)
* Increasing heart size (cardiothoracic ratio greater than 65%)
* Important cyanosis (resting oxygen saturation less than 90% - level B)
* Severe tricuspid regurgitation with symptoms
* Transient ischemic attack or stroke
The CCS further recommends patients who require operation for Ebstein&#x27;s anomaly should be operated on by congenital heart surgeons who have substantial specific experience and success with this operation. Every effort should be made to preserve the native tricuspid valve.

==History==
Ebstein&#x27;s anomaly was named after Wilhelm Ebstein, who in 1866 described the heart of the 19-year-old patient Joseph Prescher. Joseph Prescher was cyanotic with dyspnea, palpitations, jugular venous distension, and cardiomegaly. At autopsy, “Ebstein described an enlarged and fenestrated anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve.” In addition, “the posterior and septal leaflets were hypoplastic, thickened, and adherent to the right ventricle. There was also a thinned and dilated atrialized portion of the right ventricle, an enlarged right atrium, and a patent foramen ovale.”

<text>George Peress Sanderson (1848– 5 May 1892, Madras) was a British naturalist who worked in the public works department in the princely state of Mysore. He began a system for capturing wild elephants that were destructive to agriculture so as to use them in captivity. He was known in the popular press as the &quot;Elephant King&quot; and wrote a book on his life in the forests of India. Rudyard Kipling is believed to have modelled the character &quot;Petersen Sahib&quot; in his &quot;Toomai of the elephants&quot; after him.
==Biography==
Sanderson was born in India in 1848, the son of Rev. Daniel Sanderson, a Methodist missionary in India from 1842 to 1867. George Sanderson was sent home for schooling to his father&#x27;s family in Cockermouth, Cumbria. He was at the Wesley (Methodist) Kingswood School, Bath, from 1859 to 1863, returning to India in 1864 at the age of 16. He was offered work in a coffee estate by a friend but the damage to coffee by borers and a blight disease ended that prospect. He then joined in government surveys, learned Kannada, and applied for a government position.

During his employment in the irrigation department of Mysore with the British Government in India he found time for big game hunting which included tigers, elephants and the Indian Bison. His work involved the maintenance of 150 miles of canals around Hunsur as Assistant Channel Superintendent. Over the years he rose to become head of the irrigation department and was in charge of 716 miles of canals that went through the forests. He encountered elephants and tigers during this period and saw that some roving herds were destructive and suggested that they be captured. In September 1875, he was put in temporary charge of an elephant catching team of Bengal and worked in the Garo and Chittagong hills. They captured 85 elephants before he returned to Mysore. He introduced a novel way of catching wild elephants for subsequent taming and training in forestry work. Instead of trapping elephants in pits, he tried a method of driving herds into a &quot;kheddah&quot;, a fenced, ditched enclosure. In some cases he had sweet sorghum planted to attract the elephants. His techniques were a spectacular success and in 1889 he organised a demonstration to entertain Prince Albert, Duke of Clarence &amp; Avondale, when he visited India. The press referred to Sanderson as the elephant (or &quot;hathee&quot;) king.

Sanderson wrote a book, &quot;Thirteen Years Among the Wild Beasts of India&quot;, based to a large extent on his life at Morlay in the Biligirirangan Hills. He died of pulmonary phthisis in Chennai at the home of his brother-in-law Dr (later Sir) Arthur M. Branfoot in 1892 shortly after marriage and on the way back for a long leave in England. An obituary noted that he was a vegetarian while another noted his refusal to accept an invitation to dine with Prince Albert Victor who was visiting Mysore. 

An 1899 newspaper correspondent and Sir Theodore James Tasker, in an article published by the Kipling Society in 1971 suggested that &quot;Petersen Sahib, the man who caught all the elephants for the Government of India&quot; in the Jungle Book story, &quot;Toomai of the Elephants&quot; by Rudyard Kipling, was a reference to George Peress Sanderson.

<doc id="1007796" wikidata="Q1065855" url="?curid=1007796" title="Sunday at the Village Vanguard">
<text>Sunday at the Village Vanguard is a live album by jazz pianist and composer Bill Evans and his Trio consisting of Evans, bassist Scott LaFaro, and drummer Paul Motian. Released in 1961, the album is routinely ranked as one of the best live jazz recordings of all time.

==History==
&quot;Sunday at the Village Vanguard&quot; was drawn from material recorded on June 25, 1961, at the Village Vanguard in New York City. The trio played five sets—two in the afternoon and three in the evening—each one comprising four or five numbers and lasting about half an hour. This was the last performance by the Bill Evans Trio with bassist Scott LaFaro, who was killed in a car accident eleven days after the recording.

Riverside had been looking for only one album from this date, but LaFaro&#x27;s death changed the economics. The album was subtitled &quot;Featuring Scott LaFaro&quot; and was rushed out for release three months after recording by September 1961. Evans and producer Orrin Keepnews reportedly selected the tracks for &quot;Sunday at the Village Vanguard&quot; to best feature LaFaro&#x27;s masterly performance on bass, beginning and ending with two tracks (&quot;Gloria&#x27;s Step&quot; and &quot;Jade Visions&quot;) written by LaFaro himself, and with all the others featuring solos by him.

This memorable day&#x27;s performance resulted in additional material released in a second album in 1962, &quot;Waltz for Debby&quot;, as well as a further selection of takes appearing posthumously in 1984 as another LP: &quot;Bill Evans — More From the Vanguard&quot; (Milestone M-9125).

In numerous interviews Evans has paid tribute to what he always considered to be his finest trio:

:::&quot;I am thankful that we recorded that day, because it was the last time I saw Scott and the last time we would play together. When you have evolved a concept of playing which depends on the specific personalities of outstanding players, how do you start again when they are gone?&quot;

After this recording at the Village Vanguard and the death of LaFaro, it became one of the extreme low periods in the life and career of Evans. He did not play for many months, not even at home.

==Reception==

Writing for AllMusic, music critic Thom Jurek wrote of the album: &quot;This trio is still widely regarded as his finest, largely because of the symbiotic interplay between its members. This is a great place to begin with Evans.&quot; C. Michael Bailey of All About Jazz wrote: &quot;Along with bassist wunderkind Scott LaFaro and drummer Paul Motian, Evans perfected his democratic vision of trio cooperation, where all members performed with perfect empathy and telepathy... It is these performances, currently available as Sunday at the Village Vanguard and Waltz for Debby that comprise the number one best jazz live recording in this present series.&quot;

Starting in 1992, both this album and its successor &quot;Waltz for Debby&quot; have been awarded a crown in all nine editions of &quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings&quot;. In 2000, it was voted number 946 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2005, the album was included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Reissue==
In 2005, Riverside issued &quot;The Complete Village Vanguard Recordings, 1961&quot; a fully remastered three-CD box set containing virtually all the material from the entire day&#x27;s recording at the Village Vanguard (one number has been lost) on that date of 25 June. 
While all of this music was already available on the 12-CD box-set released in 1984 &quot;Bill Evans - The Complete Riverside Recording&quot;, this re-issue has had the audience ambiance enhanced and includes introductions, on-stage discussions between the musicians, interaction with the audience, and a few bars of music that Evans improvised to fill out the tape at the end of the night.

<doc id="1007798" wikidata="Q770922" url="?curid=1007798" title="Coat of arms of Poznań">
<text>The coat of arms of Poznań consists of white (not silver) city walls with three towers. On the left (heraldic) tower stands Saint Peter with a key and on the heraldic right one stands Saint Paul with a sword. In the gate there are two golden crossed keys with a cross above. Over the middle tower, which contains a single window and is topped by a battlement, there is a gothic shield with a white eagle in crown. On the sides of the two saints there are golden crescents and stars. All of those elements are on a blue field. Over the shield there is golden crown. Author of modern version of coat of arms is Jerzy Bąk.

==History==
The first known image of the Poznań coat of arms is on the seal of a document dated 1 May 1344. It contains all of the elements of the modern coat of arms except the crown over the shield. Throughout history, simpler versions were sometimes used: with only walls and keys or even only keys and cross on blue field. In 1440 king Vladislaus III of Varna gave Poznań the right and privilege to seal documents with red, royal wax. This privilege also allowed the town court to judge people of all states, including nobles and church hierarchs.

During Prussian-German rule, the Polish white eagle on a red background was coloured black on a gold background (a Prussian eagle), and the city towers were brick-red instead of white.

==Symbolic==
*City walls – symbol of town founded on Magdeburger law.
*St. Peter and St. Paul – patrons of cathedral and city. Poznań diocese is the oldest in Poland so it has right to this same patrons as St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Vatican
*shield with white eagle – Coat of Arms of Przemysł I, founder of town on magdeburger law and his son Przemysł II, king of Poland with seat in Poznań
*keys – municipal self-government
*cross – Christian faith
*crescents and stars – unknown but resembling Leliwa coat of arms
*crown over Coat of Arms – capital function in history of Poznań

<doc id="1007805" wikidata="Q635007" url="?curid=1007805" title="1919 South American Championship">
<text>The 1919 [[Copa América|South American Championship of Nations]] was the third continental championship for South American national football teams. It was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from 11 to 29 May 1919.

The participating countries were Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay as the defending champion.

After finishing tied in the group standings on points, host Brazil beat Uruguay in the playoff match to win their first title.

The playoff was the longest match in the competition&#x27;s history, and under current rules, will remain so indefinitely: with the score tied 0-0 after 90 minutes had expired, both captains and the referee agreed to play an extra time period of two 15-minute halves. When 120 minutes expired with the score still tied 0-0, both captains and the referee agreed to play a second extra time period of two 15-minute halves; thus, the playoff match lasted 150 minutes.

==Format==
There was no qualifying for the tournament. The participating countries were Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. All teams competed between each other in a single group. Two points were awarded for a win, one for a draw and zero for a defeat. If there was a tie of points at the top of the standings, a playoff match would be held to determine the champion.

==Squads==

==Venues==
==Final round==
Each team played one match against each of the other teams. Two points were awarded for a win, one point for a draw and zero points for a defeat.

==Aftermath==
The day after the final, Uruguayan goalkeeper Roberto Chery died in hospital in Rio de Janeiro of a strangulated hernia; he had been injured after attempting to stop a goal during the match against Chile. As substitutions were not allowed at the time, Chery had to play the rest of the match while severely injured.

Brazil and Uruguay had scheduled a friendly match (&quot;Copa Rio Branco&quot;) for 19 June 1919, but following Chery&#x27;s tragic death, the Uruguayan team declined to play. Argentina offered to replace the Uruguayan side, which the Brazilian Federation accepted, and the match was played as the &quot;Copa Roberto Chery&quot; to honor the late Uruguayan goalkeeper. Argentina entered the field wearing Uruguay&#x27;s traditional light-blue jersey, while Brazil wore the jersey of Uruguayan club Peñarol.

<doc id="1007807" wikidata="Q714498" url="?curid=1007807" title="Hon'inbō Shūsai">
<text>is the professional name of Hoju Tamura, also known as , who was a Japanese professional Go player.

== Biography ==
Shusai was born in Shiba, Tokyo, son of Tamura Yasunaga, a retainer of the &quot;shōgun&quot;. He learned go at age 10 and joined the Hoensha in 1883, then under the leadership of Murase Shūho. He was made &quot;shodan&quot; at age 13. At age 18, he attained the rank of 2nd &quot;dan&quot; (the lower professional ranks cannot be assumed to correspond to modern ones). He then broke with the game for a time, tried to go into business on his own account, and ended up in a Buddhist retreat in Chiba Prefecture. After more than a year out of the game, he set up his own go salon in Roppongi.

He was then helped by Kim Ok-gyun, a Korean then resident in Japan, who used his contacts to secure Tamura an introduction to Hon&#x27;inbō Shūei. He was re-ranked as 4th &quot;dan&quot; in 1892 and proceeded up the ranks from there. He engaged in a number of high-profile matches. He played Ishii Senji, a top player at Hoensha, in two &quot;jubango&quot;, one in 1895 on &quot;sen&quot;, and the other in 1897 on &quot;sen-ai-sen&quot;. A fourth such match in 1899 was left incomplete. In 1897, he challenged Yasui San&#x27;ei, last of the Yasui house, to a &quot;jubango&quot;. He also challenged Hon&#x27;inbō Shūgen. In 1897–98 he played Ishii Senji once more. In 1899 he played &quot;jubango&quot; against Karigane Junichi, who would be his only serious rival over the coming decades. In 1900–01 he played a &quot;jubango&quot; with Iwasa Kei. He emerged with the reputation of the top player, apart from Shuei. In 1907, he became 7th &quot;dan&quot;, an exclusive grade in those times.

He became the 21st and last hereditary head of the Hon&#x27;inbō house, as successor to Shūei. The manner of his ascension was to cause a lasting conflict between Tamura, who took the name Shūsai, and Karigane, also of the Honinbo house, who had been backed by Shuei&#x27;s widow.

He attained the title of Meijin in 1914, becoming the tenth player since the original Hon&#x27;inbō Sansa to do so. In Shūsai&#x27;s case, as was for Shūei previously, there was no official government involvement, and his title was given by the acclaim of fellow players. He subsequently played in some high-profile &quot;defenses&quot; of the Meijin position as the only 9th &quot;dan&quot; player.

==Style and influence==
Shūsai was a naturally slow and deep-thinking player. The fashion for relatively slow play in Japan has been traced back to his influence. Innovations such as time limits and clocks were introduced during his lifetime, much to the ire of Shūsai.

Shusai pushed the strategy of the Meiji period – as famously outlined by Hon&#x27;inbō Shūho&#x27;s book &quot;Hoen Shinpo&quot; – to further efficiency. This was done by playing farther and sometimes higher extensions, with the intention of providing better global protection to weak points. This method – then new – has been referred to as &quot;harmony breaking&quot;.

Be that as it may, his opening style was unable to deeply influence many others as the culmination of his style was soon cut short by the arrival of the &quot;shinfuseki&quot; openings revolution. He rarely innovated in &quot;joseki&quot;, preferring the admonition &quot;do not seek out novelty&quot;.

Before the Nihon Ki-in was set up, there was no codified set of rules available at all. Shūsai handed down judgements on controversies in the first days, for example on &quot;mannenko&quot;.

==Under the Nihon Ki-in==
The 1924 foundation of the Nihon Ki-in was the most significant moment in the organisational history of Japanese go in the twentieth century. It was mediated through Shusai, whose prestige was required as a minimum condition to unify the various groups. Shusai was backed by Baron Kishichiro Okura, an influential business magnate.

The process was started in 1923 with the foundation of the &quot;Hiseikai&quot; group by Karigane, Tamejiro Suzuki, Dohei Takabe, and Segoe Kensaku. This prompted the amalgamation of the Honinbo school and the Hoensha, in January 1923, in the Chūō Kiin. This arrangement was however temporary, and the two constituent organizations split three months later. The 1923 Great Kantō earthquake brought hardship to a number of Go organizations, and many of them faced closure. Under the guidance of Baron Kishichiro Okura, the Nihon Ki-in was founded in May 1924 to merge existing organizations into a single entity. Shusai was an important member of this new organization.

== Important matches ==

=== The match with Kiseisha ===
Karigane, in the meantime, had set up his rival &quot;Kiseisha&quot; organisation (1924). The &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; planned a challenge match between the two camps. This was the setting for the 1926 showdown with Karigane (the &quot;group-capturing masterpiece&quot;), perhaps the most anthologised game of modern times. Edward Lasker in his book &quot;Go and Go Moku&quot; wrote:

:... probably one of the most beautiful games on record ... [after White&#x27;s 41st move] The way Karigane boldly develops a position and finally cuts at e4 is most ingenious; it took a Hon&#x27;inbō to refute his plan. ... [After the end] Playing over this beautiful game over several times will teach the student more than he could learn in several years practice. No better guide on the way to mastership can be imagined.

Intense public interest was shown by, or perhaps aroused by, the &quot;Yomiuri&quot;″s publicity tactic of posting the game on billboards, with plays pasted on as they happened. Shūsai won the game with White. The players had 16 hours each; the game was played out over 6 sessions, with Karigane eventually resigning as he ran out of time in a game he was likely to lose by about 5 points.

This was just the initial game of a subsequent win-and-continue match, in which three Kiseisha players (Karigane, Takabe and Onoda Chiyotaro) rotated against Nihon Ki-in young stars. Kitani Minoru won ten games in a row, and the match was a triumph for the Ki-in.

=== 1933 game with Go Seigen ===

In 1933, Go Seigen and Shūsai played a famous game. Go Seigen was then 18 years old, ranked 5 &quot;dan&quot;, and had been in Japan about five years. They had played before, but not an even game; Go Seigen had won five previous handicap games.

The tradition at the time dictated whoever played White had the right to adjourn the game at any time, and there was no sealing of moves. This meant that Shūsai, being the nominally stronger player and thus holding White, could adjourn the game whenever it was his turn to play and continue deliberating at his leisure during the adjournment. Shūsai shamelessly abused this privilege by calling adjournments some 13 times, without exception, all at his turn to move, thus prolonging the match to a period of three months (16 October 1933 – 19 January 1934). For instance, Shūsai played first on the eighth day of the match, and Go Seigen replied within two minutes. Shūsai then thought for three and a half hours but only to adjourn the game. It was no secret that Shusai, during adjournments, discussed and studied the game with his students to come up with the best moves. Go Seigen was therefore put into an especially adverse position for having to take on the entire Honinbo establishment.

Shūsai trailed throughout the game until, on the 13th day of the match, he made a brilliant move at W160, now celebrated. It was rumored that it was not Shūsai but one of his students, Maeda Nobuaki, who was the author of this ingenious move. Segoe Kensaku told a reporter this, in what he thought was an off-the-record interview. Maeda himself even hinted as much. When presented with the opportunities to debunk these rumors, Maeda neither denied nor confirmed them. The match ended with Hon&#x27;inbō Shūsai winning by two points.
=== Retirement game ===
Shusai transferred the Hon&#x27;inbō title to the Nihon Ki-in in 1936 and retired thereafter.

In 1938, at the age of 64, he came back to play a memorial &quot;retirement game&quot; against Kitani Minoru, losing it by 5 points. The game was later immortalized by Nobel Prize winner Kawabata Yasunari in the novel &quot;Meijin&quot; (published in English as &quot;The Master of Go&quot;).

Kitani Minoru, having witnessed how Shūsai abused his adjournment privilege during his match against Go Seigen, demanded that the moves be sealed before each adjournment. Initially, Shūsai&#x27;s camp opposed this, but Kitani insisted, and Shūsai eventually gave in. Time limits were used, of 40 hours each, and Kitani thought deeply. He won the game by a comfortable margin of five points (the game had no komi, so Kitani as black kept his initial advantage by safe play).

== Controversy ==
Hon&#x27;inbō Shusai has had a number of accusations leveled against his character. These deal with his rivalries, within the Hon&#x27;inbō house and subsequently with the establishment of the Nihon Ki-in, conduct as a player, and financial dealings. Even though a transitional figure, Shūsai possessed enormous prestige due to his positions of Meijin and Hon&#x27;inbō, but he often abused his privileges as the senior player.

Hashimoto Utaro confided to a reporter that his master Segoe Kensaku had his reservations about Shūsai. Segoe had earlier, along with Shūsai, visited China at the invitation of several wealthy Chinese go patrons. They played a number of exhibition games against Chinese players. As a guest, Shūsai had refused to abide by Chinese playing rules, embarrassing his hosts in the process. Moreover, Shūsai would not apparently risk losing to young Chinese players and left many games unfinished, supposedly to be concluded another day, a promise he never fulfilled. Segoe commented to Hashimoto that it was unacceptable for Shūsai to have left the games unfinished after receiving hospitality and large game fees.

Go Seigen also held Shūsai in very low esteem. According to Pieter Mioch, who interviewed Go Seigen for the Dutch Go Association magazine, Go Seigen called Shūsai a &quot;scoundrel&quot; and a &quot;villain&quot;. Go Seigen accused Shūsai of selling his prestigious Hon&#x27;inbō title for a large sum to build himself a magnificent house while failing to give any of the money back to the go community.

<text>The Latin maxim , meaning &quot;we do not know and will not know&quot;, represents the idea that scientific knowledge is limited. It was popularized by Emil du Bois-Reymond, a German physiologist, in his 1872 address (&quot;The Limits of Science&quot;).

== Seven &quot;World Riddles&quot; ==

Emil du Bois-Reymond first used the words and at the close of his keynote address to the 1872 Congress of German Scientists and Physicians. As he saw it, science was bounded by two limits: the ultimate nature of matter and the enigma of consciousness. Eight years later, in a speech before the Prussian Academy of Sciences, he expanded his list of conundrums to seven &quot;world riddles&quot; or &quot;shortcomings&quot; of science. Three of these he declared to be &quot;transcendent&quot;, or permanently unknowable: &quot;1. the ultimate nature of matter and energy, 2. the origin of motion, ... 5. the origin of simple sensations.&quot;

== Hilbert&#x27;s reaction ==

David Hilbert, a widely-respected German mathematician, suggested that such a conceptualization of human knowledge was too pessimistic, and that by considering questions unsolvable we limit our understanding.

In 1900, during an address to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris, Hilbert suggested that answers to problems of mathematics are possible with human effort. He declared, &quot;in mathematics there is no &quot;, and he worked with other formalists to establish foundations for mathematics during the early 20th century.

On 8 September 1930, Hilbert elaborated his opinion in a celebrated address to the Society of German Scientists and Physicians, in Königsberg:

Answers to some of Hilbert&#x27;s 23 problems were found during the 20th century. Some have been answered definitively; some have not yet been solved; a few, most notably Cantor&#x27;s continuum hypothesis, have been shown to be undecidable on the basis of currently accepted principles.

In 1931, Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems showed that for any formal system of mathematics satisfying certain minimal requirements, there exist questions that cannot be answered within that system. While this does not exclude that the question can be answered unambiguously in another system, the incompleteness theorems are generally taken to imply that Hilbert&#x27;s hopes for proving the consistency of mathematics using purely finitistic methods were unfounded. As this excludes the possibility of an absolute proof of consistency, there must always remain an ineliminable degree of insecurity about the foundations of mathematics: we will never be capable of knowing, once and for all, with a certainty unimpeachable even by the most stout skepticism, that there is no contradiction in our basic theories. (Note that this does not mean that such skepticism is rational; it only means that it cannot be refuted with absolute rigour.)

== Other responses ==
The sociologist Wolf Lepenies discussed the with the opinion that du Bois-Reymond was not really pessimistic about science:

This was in regards to Friedrich Wolters, one of the members of the literary group &quot;George-Kreis&quot;. Lepenies thought that Wolters misunderstood the degree of pessimism being expressed about science, but understood the implication that scientists themselves could be trusted with self-criticism.

Lepenies was repeating the criticism, first leveled in 1874 by du Bois-Reymond&#x27;s rival Ernst Haeckel, that the &quot;seemingly humble but actually presumptuous is the of the infallible Vatican and of the &#x27;Black International&#x27; which it heads.&quot; Haeckel overstated his charge: du Bois-Reymond had never supported the Catholic Church, and far from professing humility he reminded his audience that while our knowledge was indeed bounded by mysteries of matter and mind, within these limits &quot;the man of science is lord and master; he can analyze and synthesize, and no one can fathom the extent of his knowledge and power&quot;.

In response to his critics du Bois-Reymond modified his watchword in &quot;The Seven World Riddles&quot; (1880) to that of (&quot;We doubt it.&quot;)

William James referred to &quot;Ignoramus, ignorabimus&quot; in his lecture &quot;Reflex Action and Theism&quot; (1881) as an expression of agnosticism, which gives man no practical tools for his volitions. James had attended du Bois-Reymond&#x27;s lectures in Berlin.

The &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; also regarded the maxim as the ensign of agnosticism:To the average citizen who reads as he runs, and who is unacquainted with any tongue save his native British, it may well appear that the Gospel of Unbelief, preached among us during the last half-century, has had its four Evangelists–the Quadrilateral, as they have been called, whose works and outworks, demilunes and frowning bastions, take the public eye, while above them floats the agnostic banner with its strange device, &quot;&quot;Ignoramus et Ignorabimus&quot;.&quot; The issue of whether science has limits continues to attract scholarly attention.

<text>Thomas Leopold &quot;Carbide&quot; Willson (March 14, 1860 – December 20, 1915) was a Canadian inventor.

== Biography ==
Willson was born on a farm near Princeton, Canada West, on March 14, 1860, and went to school in Hamilton, Ontario. By the age of 21, he had designed and patented the first electric arc lamps used in Hamilton. He moved to the United States in search of opportunities to sell his ideas.

In 1892, Willson discovered an economically efficient process for creating calcium carbide, which is used in the production of acetylene gas. In 1895, he sold his patent to Union Carbide.

In the same year, Willson married Mary Parks in California and moved back to Canada. He built a house for his mother in Woodstock, Ontario in 1895. During 1900 and 1901, he moved to Ottawa and opened carbide plants both in Ontario (Merritton and Ottawa) and Quebec (Shawinigan). In 1911, he founded the International Marine Signal Company to manufacture marine buoys and lighthouse beacons.

Willson was the first person to own an automobile in Ottawa.In 1907, Willson built a summer house on Meech Lake in what is now Gatineau Park. The house is now owned by the federal government and notable for being the site of negotiations on the Meech Lake Accord. In 1911, he began experimenting with the condensation of phosphoric acid in the manufacture of fertilizers at a mill on Meech Creek within the park. Due to this venture and running out of capital, he missed one interest payment and lost nearly all of his estate to his creditor, American tobacco king James Buchanan Duke. The Meech Lake estate was then sold to Arthur Vining Davis who would go on to further Willson&#x27;s enterprising effort by establishing the Quebec aluminum industry at Arvida, the name of the town being a portmanteau of his own name.

Willson died of a heart attack in New York City on December 20, 1915, while trying to raise funds for a hydroelectric project in Labrador. His dream was finally realized in 1974 as the Churchill Falls project. His name was given to an island on the Saguenay river, near the Shipshaw powerhouse.

<doc id="1007815" wikidata="Q9001389" url="?curid=1007815" title="Álvarez Guedes">
<text>Guillermo Álvarez Guedes (8 June 1927 – 30 July 2013) was a Cuban comedian, actor, writer &amp; businessman. He was better known across Latin America as Álvarez Guedes.

==Early years==
Alvarez Guedes was born in Unión de Reyes, Matanzas, a town from where, according to a popular song, hails a legendary and probably fictional rumba king called Malanga. His showbiz career began in his hometown. There, since childhood, he would entertain crowds at parties and fairs by dancing and singing. 

==Career==
It was natural that Guedes would travel to Havana, not just the country&#x27;s capital but a known entertainment center. In Havana, he worked in theaters and radio shows. But it was in the new medium of television, of which Cuba was the Latin American pioneer, where he made his mark. In a city known for its nightclub scene, Alvarez Guedes appeared in popular television shows that were set in bars and clubs in the role of &quot;el borracho&quot;, the drunkard, where he mixed linguistic humor with a physical comic style reminiscent of American silent movie stars like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. He worked in this medium, as well as the booming club world of 1950s Havana, where he shared billing with such stars as Beny Moré, Olga Guillot and Rita Montaner.

During that decade, the comic also began a cinematic career that would lead to roles in more than 14 movies and the production of three. However, his most disseminated medium was the recorded spoken word. In 1960, Alvarez Guedes was forced into exile, landing first in New York City then San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he eventually made his first comedy album in 1973, leading to thirty-plus albums over the years. Through the albums, he became an international star of Spanish-language comedy before settling in Miami. 

An icon of the Cuban exile community, Alvarez Guedes became known throughout Latin America through his recordings of stand-up comedy, where he told jokes in an unmistakable Spanish filled with Cuban idioms that seemed to flow naturally from his native country&#x27;s street humor. Thanks to his popularity, a Cuban accent strikes many fellow Latins as full of verve and good cheer and has probably done more for good vibrations between Cubans and other Spanish speakers than any diplomatic venture.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Álvarez Guedes dedicated himself to recording comedy albums and writing comedy books. He routinely expressed his desire for Cuba to return to the way it used to be; such was the occasion when he made one of his famous jokes, involving a TWA flight he supposedly took between Havana and Miami. That route was actually flown by TWA, Pan Am and Cubana before Fidel Castro&#x27;s rise to power.

Curiously, his own best-selling album is in English – sort of. In his &quot;How to Defend Yourself from the Cubans,&quot; which was released in the mid &#x27;80s, Alvarez Guedes routines are spoken in heavily accented English – and incongruously American-accented Spanish. In the album, Alvarez Guedes warns Americans in a tongue-in-cheek manner about the Cuban invasion of United States homeland and culture. The humor works doubly with English and Spanish speakers, the latter recognizing the absurdities of their own culture. It is admitted among Cuban-Americans that Alvarez Guedes could call Cubans on their follies without eliciting any rancor from his countrymen.

In that recording and other stand-up routines, Alvarez Guedes patented the use of the expression &quot;¡ñó!&quot; Though it stands for a blunt obscenity, Cubans use the word in both the two-syllable original and the abbreviation as a sign of awe, indignation or even reflection, without ever considering its original meaning. It is the ultimate four-letter word. But given how Cuban speech tends to slur pronunciation, the comedian picked up on its shortened version and it became his trademark.

It is likely that Guillermo Alvarez Guedes broke the vulgarity barrier in Spanish stand-up. But he did not do so transgressively, like a Lenny Bruce, but in the manner of American ethnic comics like the masters of Jewish shtick, as the natural expression of a people. For most of his career, Alvarez Guedes&#x27; humor was laced with vulgarity and his audiences laughed accordingly. Yet he never told truly off-color jokes and his comic persona was deadpan and straight, sometimes affecting righteous indignation. He was just talking as would any Cuban.

That was his biggest appeal. He played – some would say he was – the &quot;cubanazo&quot;, a word well known in Miami which roughly means, The Big Cuban. Too Cuban For You. Among Cubans, it was the recognition of one&#x27;s ethnic idiosyncrasies that enriched his popularity. Among others, it was being granted license to laugh at aspects of Cuban speech and culture which the audience already found funny. As anti-Castro as any of his exile compatriots, Alvarez Guedes summed up his critique of Fidel Castro in a simple vulgarity in Spanish: He was an S.O.B. Most Cuban-Americans would agree.

&quot;My best memories of Cuba make me sad&quot;, he told El Nuevo Herald in 2007. &quot;Cuba is a country that no longer exists, even if I was born there&quot;.

The roots of Alvarez Guedes&#x27; humor are to be found in a Cuban music hall tradition known as &quot;teatro bufo&quot;, where ethnic types drawn from the Havana barrios acted out comedy skits that were Creole versions of comic theater from the 16th and 17th century Spanish traditions. According to the EnCaribe web page, Alvarez Guedes represented both &quot;el gallego (literally &quot;the galician&quot;)—&quot;– a handlebar-moustached Spanish immigrant, whose physical appearance was that of Alvarez Guedes himself – and &quot;el negrito&quot;, a street-smart Afro-Cuban who relentlessly mocks el gallego. And his attitude is rooted in &quot;choteo&quot;, a disregard for any seriousness that Cuban intellectual life identifies as a major component of the island&#x27;s culture.

But such academic wonderings would be dismissed by Alvarez Guedes, who in his radio show on Miami&#x27;s Clasica 92.3FM would urge his listeners, in the best tradition of choteo, to &quot;tirarlo todo a relajo&quot; — make a joke of everything.

Alvarez Guedes wrote over 20 books, and his albums, alongside television presentations and stand-up comedy appearances have made him one of the most well-liked entertainers, both among the Hispanic public and fellow entertainers alike.

==GEMA Records==
Alvarez Guedes and his brother Rafael, together with composer/band leader Ernesto Duarte Brito, founded Gema Records, the company that launched the international careers of &quot;El Gran Combo&quot;, a Puerto Rican Salsa music group. A friendship united Guedes with the orchestra&#x27;s director, Rafael Ithier. The company also launched the careers of Elena Burke and Rolando Laserie, among others.

==Death==
Alvarez Guedes died on 30 July 2013 at his home in the Kendall neighborhood of Miami.

<text>George Shiels (24 June 1881 – 19 September 1949) was an Irish dramatist whose plays were a success both in his native Ulster and at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin. His most famous plays are &quot;The Rugged Path&quot;, &quot;The Passing Day&quot;, and &quot;The New Gossoon&quot;.

==Biography==
Shiels was born to Robert Shiels and Eileen (née MacSweeney) in Ballymoney, County Antrim, and emigrated to Canada as a young man. While working on the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1913, he was involved in a serious accident that left him in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. He returned to Ballymoney and started a shipping company with his brother, and also began writing at this time. Starting with poems and short stories, he soon progressed to plays, which he provided to the Ulster Literary Theatre under the pen name of George S. Morsheils.

Starting with &quot;Bedmates&quot; (1921), his plays began to be regularly accepted by the Abbey Theatre for production. His 1930 work &quot;The New Gossoon&quot; was so well-received that the Abbey&#x27;s touring company, The Abbey Theatre Irish Players, brought the play to Broadway for limited runs three times, in 1932, 1934, and 1937. In 1940, a production of Shiels&#x27; &quot;The Rugged Path&quot; set an Abbey record by attracting a total audience of 25,000 people over eight weeks.

When his success as a playwright allowed him, he left the shipping business and moved to Carnlough on the coast of County Antrim, where he lived from 1932 until his death in 1949.

<text>Dural is a semi rural suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia 36 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government areas of Hornsby Shire and The Hills Shire. Dural is part of the Hills District. Round Corner is a locality in the south-western part of Dural.

==History==
The original inhabitants of the Dural area were the Darug people. Dural is derived from Dooral-Dooral, an Aboriginal name meaning &quot;a smoking hollow tree&quot;.

The name &quot;Dooral&quot; appeared on Surveyor Richard Dundiate&#x27;s map of April 1817 and originally covered the whole area including present day Glenorie, Galston, Arcadia and Middle Dural. Located on the Old Northern Road, a historic road built by convicts between 1825 and 1836 to link early Sydney, in the Colony of New South Wales, with the fertile Hunter Valley to the north. The first grant in the area was made to George Hall in 1879. At an earlier stage, a local settler, James Roughley, had donated land to be used for the building of a church. A sandstone chapel was built on Old Northern Road circa 1846, with a vestry, apse and shingle roof, plus a bell turret on the western gable. A porch was added soon after. The chapel—known as St Jude&#x27;s Church—is now listed on the Register of the National Estate.

Dural Post Office opened on 1 August 1864.

<text>Samizdata is a British group weblog. Founded on 2 November 2001, by Perry de Havilland and originally named ‘Libertarian Samizdata’, it dropped the label due to the reluctance of editors to subscribe to a particular label.

Edited by &quot;anarcho-libertarians, tax rebels, Eurosceptics, and Wildean individualists,&quot; Samizdata is one of the UK&#x27;s oldest blogs. The editors describe Samizdata.net as &quot;a blog for people with a critically rational individualist perspective. We are developing the social individualist meta-context for the future. From the very serious to the extremely frivolous.

In 2005, &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that it was &quot;by some measures the nation&#x27;s most successful independent blog,&quot; with over 15,000 unique visitors a day, and &quot;arguably the grandfather of British political blogs.&quot; In 2008, &quot;The Observer&quot; labeled it as one of the fifty most powerful blogs in the world.

<text>&quot;General Electors&quot; is the term formerly used in Fiji to identify citizens of voting age who belonged, in most cases, to ethnic minorities. The 1997 Constitution defined General Electors as all Fiji citizens who were not registered as being of Fijian, Indian, or Rotuman descent. Also included were citizens who did qualify to be registered in the above categories, but who chose not to be. Persons of biracial or multiracial ancestry could opt to enroll either as General Electors, or as descendants of any of the other three groups to which they had an ancestral claim. General Electors were thus a diverse electorate, whose members included Europeans, Chinese, Banaban Islanders, and many smaller groups. They were allocated 3 seats in the House of Representatives, the lower and more influential house of the Fijian Parliament.

The 1997 Constitution of Fiji was a compromise between what it saw as the ideal of universal suffrage, and the practical reality of the need to protect the communal interests of Fiji&#x27;s diverse ethnic communities. The House of Representatives reflected this compromise, with 46 members chosen for &quot;communal electorates&quot; by voters on closed electoral rolls comprising citizens of ethnic Fijian (23), Indo-Fijian (19), and Rotuman (1) ancestry, with a further 3 reserved for General Electors. Another 25 members were open to citizens of all races, and were elected by universal suffrage.

Over the years, the exact definition of General Electors varied, as did their parliamentary representation. Prior to 1994, biracial and multiracial voters were also included automatically. That year, James Ah Koy, a popular politician of ethnic Fijian and Chinese descent, successfully lobbied for a law change to allow him to register as a Fijian, rather than as a General Elector. The 1997 Constitution codified this change, giving citizens of mixed ancestry multiple options for registration. (Citizens were allowed to register for only one category, but for a small fee could change their registration at any time).

In the transitional years of the 1960s, when the British colonial rulers were preparing Fiji for independence, General Electors were allocated 10 seats in the 40 member legislature. Seven of these were elected on a closed roll consisting only of General Electors; the remaining 3 were chosen by universal suffrage. The 1970 constitution, under which Fiji became independent, reduced their representation to 8 out of 52, of which 3 were elected on the closed roll and 5 by universal suffrage. At the constitutional conference in London in April 1970, the then-Prime Minister, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, strongly resisted pressure to reduce the General Electors&#x27; representation further, arguing that with the numbers of ethnic Fijians and Indo-Fijians so evenly balanced, they needed the minorities as a buffer between them. Politics may have been a factor, too: General Electors were strong supporters of Mara&#x27;s Alliance Party: in six parliamentary elections over a twenty-year period, they never voted against it.

In the wake of the 1987 coup, a new constitution was promulgated in 1990 aimed at enforcing and institutionalising ethnic Fijian dominance. General Electors&#x27; representation was reduced to 5 out of 71, but all were now elected on the closed roll, thereby increasing the influence of politicians responsible only to General Electors, whom the Fijian nationalists still saw as allies. A Constitutional review in 1997, however, agreed on a more equitable distribution. General Electors would be allocated 3 out of 46 &quot;communal electorates,&quot; with the opportunity to contest, with all other groups, the 25 Open electorates. At any rate, with almost seven percent of the communal seats allocated to them, their representation was now close to their percentage of the Fijian population.

Throughout the 1990s, General Electors generally supported the General Voters&#x27; Party (a reconstitution of what had been the European faction of the now-disbanded Alliance Party), and its successor, the United General Party, (now the United Peoples Party). In the 2001 election, however, they divided their three seats among three different parties. Subsequently, the United General Party leader, Millis Beddoes, was appointed Leader of the Opposition when the Fiji Labour Party leader, Mahendra Chaudhry, declined the position. This was the first time that a General Electors&#x27; representative had served in this capacity.

A new constitution was promulgated in September 2013, abolishing ethnic representation in the newly constituted unicameral Parliament of Fiji. As a formal electoral constituency, the General Electors ceased to exist.

<text>Radio City 107.3 is a Swedish radio station.

The station was launched in 1987 in Gothenburg, Sweden, on the West Coast of Sweden. Since broadcasting began, the station has developed a format and music concept tailor-made for the listeners in Gothenburg. Radio City 107.3 is owned by ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG.

Radio 107.3 covers Gothenburg and the surrounding communities within a diameter of , which means that the station has a total &quot;universe&quot; of approximately 800,000 people. The target group is 20 to 40-year-old listeners. In the area of coverage, the radio competes with four commercial stations, four government channels and at least five community frequencies.

The station&#x27;s local approach is reflected in all of its programming - from the most popular music in Gothenburg, &quot;100% Gothenburg – 100% Hits&quot; to the locally produced news broadcasts and traffic information, the editorial coverage of local events and the building of strong and well-known on-air personalities. It is the biggest commercial radio station in Sweden.

In 2006, Radio City 107,3 and Mix Megapol were amalgamated. The new name of the station was Mix Megapol Radio City with &quot;Gothenburg&#x27;s best mix of music&quot;</text><links>

<doc id="1007836" wikidata="Q1282102" url="?curid=1007836" title="Eric James, Baron James of Rusholme">
<text>Eric John Francis James, Baron James of Rusholme (13 April 1909 – 16 May 1992) was a prominent British educator.

==Background==
Eric John Francis James was born at Derby into a Nonconformist family. His father was a commercial traveller with a passion for literature, which he successfully passed to his son.

James was educated at York Place Secondary School, Brighton. At age 13 he went to Taunton&#x27;s School at Southampton, from where he won an exhibition to the Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford. He gained a first in Chemistry, and represented the university at chess. He had planned on studying Medicine, but unable to obtain the necessary scholarships, he chose a teaching career.

==Career==

James was offered a temporary appointment at Winchester College in 1933, where he soon secured a permanent staff position. He taught Chemistry, as well as a variety of related subjects. He remained there until 1945, and was High Master of Manchester Grammar School from 1945 to 1962. He then became the first Vice-Chancellor of the University of York, serving from 1962 to 1973. He is credited with creating the collegiate structure of the University of York.

==Educational views and influence==
James held well-known and controversial views on the importance of meritocracy and took very seriously &quot;the University&#x27;s obligation to be a cultural and educational force in the region&quot;. His three cardinal principles for the University of York were:
*it should be collegiate in character
*it should deliberately aim to limit the range of subjects 
*much of the teaching should be by tutorials and seminars.

James strongly believed in equality of opportunity. He strove to distinguish between equality of opportunity and uniformity of treatment. He held that able children are a nation&#x27;s most precious asset, and that the academically gifted will best develop their talents in company with their peers.

In the 1950s and 1960s it required considerable moral courage to stand out against the dominant educational opinion, which had settled dogmatically upon scrapping grammar schools in favour of the supposedly more egalitarian comprehensive system. He advocated a pure meritocracy. Selection at Manchester Grammar School was by competitive examination, with no marks added for wealth or family connections. It was the essence of his philosophy that grammar schools should serve as ladders, giving all levels of society access to the highest places in the land. His approach bore fruit; in the mid-1950s Manchester Grammar School was attaining up to 45 scholarships every year at Oxford and Cambridge. However, in the short term his efforts were doomed to failure; Manchester was forced to become a fee-charging school.

In 1962 James moved to the University of York, named as Vice-Chancellor. He was involved with every detail of the university&#x27;s development. He described his work with the architects as one of the most exciting times of his life. The institution which he helped to shape exhibited many characteristics of Oxford; James stressed that at least half the students should live on the campus; he housed them in separate colleges which were conceived not simply as halls of residence, but as the centres of the university&#x27;s social and academic life. To create the closest possible relationship between teacher and taught, tutors as well as students were given rooms in the colleges; and the tutorial became the basic form of instruction. Half of the undergraduates were women.

James&#x27; prescription for running a university was simple:
*get extremely good men on your staff
*create a place where schools will want to send their best people
*look after the students when you have got them.

He proved more successful than many of his peers in dealing with the student troubles of the 1960s. He made himself available for discussion with anybody. Upon his retirement in 1973, the president of the student union lauded the respect and admiration which the Vice-Chancellor had earned.

==Further interests==
James was chairman of the 1953-1954 Headmasters&#x27; Conference. As a member of the Central Advisory Council on Education he was part of the 1959 Crowther Report on secondary education, which contained two of his special concerns - the raising of the school leaving age to 16; and for specialised studies in sixth forms.

James was a member of the Standing Commission on Museums and Art Galleries, as well as a member of the Press Council.

After his 1973 retirement, James served on the Social Science Research Council. He also chaired of the Personal Social Services Council, and the Royal Fine Art Commission. He broadcast in both the radio and television versions of The Brains Trust. However, he campaigned vigorously against popular television, holding that it produced a &quot;diseducative&quot; effect on young viewers.

James set forth his educational ideas in two books, &quot;An Essay on the Content of Education&quot; (1949) and &quot;Education and Leadership&quot; (1951). His &quot;Elements of Physical Chemistry&quot;, written in collaboration with another master during his Winchester period, became a standard school textbook.

==James Report on Teacher Training==
In 1970, the British Secretary of State for Education and Science, Margaret Thatcher, asked James to chair a government inquiry into teacher training. His slant on education of future teachers included a conviction that teachers should be educated rather than trained. He wanted teachers who could inspire children; beside this great principle, what or how they should teach were questions of lesser import. He held that a single subject, well taught, might form the basis of a true education; equally that an apparently alluring spread of studies, badly taught, would simply become a drab routine.

The &quot;James Report on Teacher Training&quot;, which appeared in 1972, envisaged the colleges of education as mini-universities where students would follow a two-year, purely academic, course leading to a Diploma of Higher Education, before engaging specifically with teaching. Only after the DipHE should future teachers undertake a two-year course addressed to the theory and practice of work in the classroom. It was also proposed that teachers should attend an in-service course for not less than one term every seven years.

The James Report received opposition from the National Union of Teachers, but the Government and the preponderance of opinion supported its recommendations.

==Honours and awards==
James was knighted in 1956, and was created a life peer as Baron James of Rusholme, of Fallowfield in the County Palatine of Lancashire, in 1959.

In 2023, the University of York Boat Club, named their men’s coxed four after Lord James in honour of his work in establishing the first Roses tournament and to commemorate 60 years of the club.

==Personal==

In 1939 James married Cordelia Mary Wintour, the sole daughter of Major-General Fitzgerald Wintour, and sister of Charles Wintour, an editor of the British daily newspaper &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. Cordelia was a paternal aunt of the fashion magazine editor Dame Anna Wintour and of the British journalist Patrick Wintour.

The son of Eric James and Cordelia Wintour James is Oliver Francis Wintour James, who became a professor, a leading British hepatologist, and pro vice-chancellor of the Newcastle University.

==Death==
Eric James died in 1992. He had become blind, and fell in his home in North Yorkshire onto a miniature orange tree: a twig penetrated his eyeball and pierced his brain.

<text>Nikhila Bedi (; &quot;née&quot; Moolgaoker; 9 September 1966) is a British television and radio presenter, born to an Indian father of Maharashtrian origin and an English mother. She was married to food stylist Sunil Vijayakar before her second marriage to Kabir Bedi from 1992 to 2005; she retained her married name after their divorce. She describes herself as Indo-Anglian.

She writes and presents &quot;The Arts Hour&quot; and &quot;The Arts Hour on Tour&quot; for the BBC World Service, and co-hosts BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Live&quot;.

==Background==
Her paternal grandparents were the industrialist Sumant Moolgaokar, head of Tata Motors and Tata Steel, and social worker Leela Sumant Moolgaokar, a pioneer of blood transfusion in India.

==Career==
Both a stage and television actress, Bedi began her career in Mumbai. Spotted by the UK&#x27;s Channel 4, she hosted &quot;Bombay Chat&quot;, an on-location celebrity talk show. Star TV gave her a primetime slot for &quot;Nikki Tonight&quot; which quickly proved to be Asia&#x27;s most widely viewed and controversial talk show, although it was subsequently cancelled by Star TV after a guest, gay rights activist Ashok Row Kavi, made a derogatory remark about Mahatma Gandhi.

Bedi then moved to live and work for a time in Los Angeles, before returning to the UK in 2000 to be the face of Universal&#x27;s film channel The Studio for over two years. She also presented two live film shows for NOW, &quot;Worldwide Screen&quot; and &quot;Bollywood Today&quot;.

In 2003, Bedi began working in radio, appearing on LBC and BBC Radio 4. In 2004, she became the presenter of a new weekend morning programme called &quot;Hot Breakfast&quot; on the BBC Asian Network before taking over as presenter of the weekday afternoon show, &quot;Drive&quot; in 2005. In May 2006, as part of wide-ranging schedule changes, she was given her own show called &quot;Nikki Bedi&quot; on the BBC Asian Network. The daily show featured music, films, books, art and all things cultural and included interviews with prominent figures from those worlds.

She has covered for a number of key presenters on BBC Radio 2, BBC London 94.9 and BBC Radio 4 and in October 2008 fulfilled a long-held ambition by appearing in an episode of the BBC Radio 4 drama, &quot;The Archers&quot;. Bedi continued with her television work alongside radio, appearing as a presenter on BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Desi DNA&quot; for three years and on the popular BBC One series &quot;To Buy or Not to Buy&quot; during 2010 and 2011.

Bedi was a Costa Book Awards judge in the New Novel category announced in Jan 2010 and has also been on the judging panel for the European Independent Film Festival Awards and the One World Media Awards. In February 2010, she presented a 3-part documentary series on BBC Radio 2 called &quot;Bollywood Britain&quot;. The series explores the history of Hindi film music and its lasting ties with generations of British Asians.

Bedi continues to be a voiceover artist, having voiced or narrated a wide variety of shows from the BBC Four documentary series &quot;Indian School&quot; to the &quot;Millies&quot; on ITV.

===BBC Radio London, BBC World Service and BBC Radio 4 (2010–present)===
Joining BBC Radio London in 2010, Bedi presented an evening weekend show until taking over as presenter of the Monday to Thursday overnight show in 2011. She has also been a regular stand-in presenter for key BBC Radio London shows and presenters including, the &quot;Lesley Joseph Show&quot;, the &quot;Vanessa Feltz Show&quot;, &quot;Eddie Nestor&#x27;s Rum Shop&quot;, &quot;The Late Show with JoAnne Good&quot; and Gaby Roslin on &quot;The Breakfast Show&quot;.
Early in 2013, Bedi moved to the BBC Radio London evening weekend show (Friday to Sunday), making way for her new weekday show &quot;The Arts Hour&quot; on the BBC World Service. Curated, written and presented by Bedi, &quot;The Arts Hour&quot; is a weekly collection of the most interesting arts related stories from across the BBC and elsewhere. In February 2016, Bedi moved to the weekday early breakfast on the renamed BBC Radio London. She left early breakfast in December 2016, and from January 2017 until April 2019, Bedi presented a Sunday mid morning show on BBC Radio London.

In August 2019, Bedi made her debut on Smooth Radio on a Sunday afternoon show.

Bedi has been associated with BBC Radio 4 for several years having become a regular interviewer on &quot;Loose Ends&quot;, presenting the show when usual host Clive Anderson was absent and she has also occasionally presented &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot;. Bedi became co-host of &quot;Saturday Live&quot; in late 2020.

<text>Gränna () is a locality in Jönköping Municipality, Jönköping County, Sweden with 2,665 inhabitants in 2018. Founded in 1652 by Count Per Brahe, it is in Småland on the eastern shores of the lake Vättern, about 40 km north of Jönköping.

The town is at the foot of Gränna mountain and is characterized by its steep streets and old wooden houses.

Up until the local government reform of 1971, Gränna and its immediate surroundings constituted a city municipality of its own; since then it has become an integral part of Jönköping Municipality.

Gränna is, despite its small population, for historical reasons often still referred to as a &quot;city&quot;. Statistics Sweden, however, only counts localities with more than 10,000 inhabitants as cities.

Gränna is known for its red and white polkagris (literally &quot;polka pig&quot; in Swedish) stick candy, also known as peppermint rock. This was first made by the widow Amalia Eriksson in 1859. A statue of Amalia can now be seen in the park at the foot of Gränna mountain. The town is popular with tourists and is a connection point for the ferry service to the island Visingsö.

The balloonist Salomon August Andrée, who died in an attempt to reach the North Pole by balloon, was born in Gränna. The Grenna Museum hosts an exhibition of the expedition together with a comprehensive collection of related objects and photos.

Students studying Pathway Program at Jönköping University have the privilege of living and studying in Gränna. Campus Gränna is situated in the Centre of Gränna. Buses depart from Gränna to Jönkoping every half hour and it takes approximately 30-45 minutes to travel between the location.

Campus Gränna&#x27;s development dates back to Grennaskolan, which at the time was a national boarding school and later became Jönköping University&#x27;s campus. Campus Gränna has been through several significant milestones, including when it became the Pathway Program Centre and started its collaboration with Jönköping University, making many changes in its educational offerings.

Campus Gränna inhabits the Jönköping University environment, enabling collaborative projects, joint academic initiatives and cultural exchanges. Campus collaborates with the local community through partnerships, outreach programs, and community events, which leads to a diverse and inclusive learning environment.

==Gränna in popular culture==
*When Niklas Strömstedt wrote lyrics in Swedish for the musical &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;, Glasgow was replaced by &quot;Gränna&quot; as the place which the singer calls from in the lyrics of the song Super Trouper.

<text>J.C. Bamford Excavators Limited (JCB) is a British multinational manufacturer of equipment for construction, agriculture, waste handling, and demolition. It was founded in 1945 and is based in Rocester, Staffordshire, England. 

The word &quot;&quot; is also often used colloquially as a generic description for mechanical diggers and excavators, and the word even appears in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, although it is still held as a trademark.

==History==
Joseph Cyril Bamford Excavators Ltd. was founded by Joseph Cyril Bamford in October 1945 in Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, England. He rented a lock-up garage . In it, using a welding set which he bought second-hand for £1 from English Electric, he made his first vehicle, a tipping trailer from war-surplus materials. The trailer&#x27;s sides and floor were made from steel sheet that had been part of air raid shelters. On the same day as his son Anthony was born, he sold the trailer at a nearby market for £45 (plus a part-exchanged farm cart) and at once made another trailer. At one time he made vehicles in Eckersley&#x27;s coal yard in Uttoxeter. The first trailer and the welding set have been preserved.

In 1948, six people were working for the company, and it made the first hydraulic tipping trailer in Europe. In 1950, it moved to an old cheese factory in Rocester, still employing six. A year later, Bamford began painting his products yellow. In 1953, he developed JCB&#x27;s first backhoe loader, and the JCB logo appeared for the first time. It was designed by Derby Media and advertising designer Leslie Smith. In 1957, the firm launched the &quot;hydra-digga&quot;, incorporating the excavator and the major loader as a single all-purpose tool useful for the agricultural and construction industries.

By 1964, JCB had sold over 3,000 3C backhoe loaders. The next year, the first 360-degree excavator was introduced, the JCB 7. 

In 1975, Anthony Bamford, Bamford&#x27;s son, was made Chairman of the company.

In 1978, the Loadall machine was introduced. The next year, the firm started its operation in India. In 1991, the firm entered a joint venture with Sumitomo of Japan to produce excavators, which ended in 1998. Two years later, a JCB factory was completed in Pooler near Savannah, Georgia, in the US, and in 2012 a factory was opened in Brazil.

In 2005, JCB bought a company, purchasing the German equipment firm Vibromax. In the same year, it opened a new factory in Pudong, China. Planning of a new £40M JCB Heavy Products site began following the launch of an architectural design competition in 2007 managed by RIBA Competitions, and by the next year, the firm began to move from its old site on Pinfold Street in Uttoxeter to the new site beside the A50; the Pinfold Street site was demolished in 2009. During that year, JCB announced plans to make India its largest manufacturing hub. Its factory at Ballabgarh in Haryana was to become the world&#x27;s largest backhoe loader manufacturing facility. Although JCB shed 2,000 jobs during the Great Recession, in 2010 it rehired up to 200 new workers.

In 2013, JCB set up its fourth manufacturing facility in India. In 2014, it was reported that three out of every four pieces of construction equipment sold in India was a JCB, and that its Indian operations accounted for 17.5% of its total revenue. JCB-based memes have also become prevalent in India.

JCB began manufacturing 20-30 tonne excavators in Solnechnogorsky District in Russia in 2017. Due to trade sanctions imposed following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, JCB suspended its operations in Russia in March 2022.

In 2020, JCB launched www.jcbexplore.com - a website dedicated to promoting constructive play and outdoor activities for kids.

==Products==

Many of the vehicles produced by JCB are variants of the backhoe loader, including tracked or wheeled variants, mini and large version and other variations, such as forklift vehicles and telescopic handlers for moving materials to the upper floors of a building site. The company also produces wheeled loading shovels and articulated dump trucks.

Its JCB Fastrac range of tractors, which entered production in 1990, can drive at speeds of up to 75 km/h (40 mph) on roads and was shown on the BBC television programme &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;, and years later as Jeremy Clarkson&#x27;s tractor of choice in &quot;Top Gear&quot;. The firm makes a range of military vehicles, including the JCB HMEE. It licenses a range of rugged feature phones and smartphones designed for construction sites. The design and marketing contract was awarded to Data Select in 2010, which then lost the exclusive rights in 2013.

JCB power systems make a hydrogen combustion engine which aims to be cost effective by reusing parts from the company&#x27;s Dieselmax engines.

JCB Insurance Services is a fully owned subsidiary of JCB that provides insurance for customers with funding from another fully owned subsidiary, JCB Finance.

==JCB Dieselmax==
In April 2006, JCB announced that they were developing a diesel-powered land speed record vehicle known as the &#x27;JCB Dieselmax&#x27;. The car is powered by two modified JCB 444 diesel power plants using a two-stage turbocharger to generate , one engine driving the front wheels and the other the rear wheels.

On 22 August 2006 the Dieselmax, driven by Andy Green, broke the diesel engine land speed record, attaining a speed of . The following day, the record was again broken, this time with a speed of .

== Controversies and criticism ==

===Violation of EU antitrust law===

In December 2000, JCB was fined €39.6M by the European Commission for violating European Union antitrust law. The fine related to restrictions on sales outside allotted territories, purchases between authorised distributors, bonuses and fees which restricted out of territory sales, and occasional joint fixing of resale prices and discounts across different territories. JCB appealed the decision, with the European Court of First Instance upholding portions of the appeal and reducing the original fine by 25%. JCB appealed to the European Court of Justice but this final appeal was rejected in 2006, with the court slightly increasing the reduced fine by €864,000.

=== Tax avoidance ===

In 2017, a Reuters study of JCB group accounts found that between 2001 and 2013, the JCB group paid £577M to JCB Research, an unlimited company that does not have to file public accounts and which has only two shares, both owned by Anthony Bamford. JCB Research has been described as an obscure company, allegedly worth £27,000, but which donated £2M to the Conservative Party in the run up to the 2010 election, making it the largest donor. Ownership of the company which has never filed accounts is disputed by the Bamford brothers. According to a Guardian report, much of the Bamford money was held in shares in offshore trusts. 
JCB Service, the main JCB holding company, is owned by a Dutch parent company, ‘Transmissions and engineering Netherlands BV’, which is ultimately controlled by “Bamford family interests”. According to Ethical Consumer, JCB has six subsidiaries in jurisdictions considered to be tax havens, in Singapore, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Delaware and Switzerland.

===Involvement in Israeli settlements===

On 12 February 2020, the United Nations published a database of all business enterprises involved in certain specified activities related to the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Golan Heights. JCB has been listed on the database in light of its involvement in activities related to &quot;the supply of equipment and materials facilitating the construction and the expansion of settlements and the wall, and associated infrastructures&quot;. The international community considers Israeli settlements built on land occupied by Israel to be in violation of international law.

In October 2020, the British government decided to investigate a complaint that JCB’s sale of equipment to Israel did not comply with the human rights guidelines set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The UK National Contact Point (NCP), part of the UK’s Department of International Trade, agreed to review a complaint against JCB submitted by a charity, Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights. JCB said it had no “legal ownership” of its machinery once sold to Comasco, its sole distributor of JCB equipment in Israel.

===Bailout loan===
In 2020, JCB received a £600M loan in emergency financial aid from the UK government, during the coronavirus pandemic, despite its ultimate ownership being in the Netherlands and having reported a record £447M profit the previous year. Its chief executive Graeme Macdonald said: “Although not a public company, we are eligible for CCF because of our contribution to the UK economy. We don’t expect to utilise it in the short-term but it gives us an insurance policy if there is further disruption from or second spike or other impact around the world.”

===Politics===
JCB is a significant donor to the UK Conservative Party. Between 2007 and 2017, JCB and related Bamford entities donated £8.1m in cash or kind to the party. Between 2019 and 2021 JCB donated a further £2.5m.

In 2016, Anthony Bamford donated £100,000 to Vote Leave, the official pro-Brexit group, and wrote to JCB&#x27;s 6,500 staff explaining why he supported the UK leaving the EU.

In October 2016, it was reported that JCB had left the CBI business lobby group in the summer of the same year due to the organisation&#x27;s anti-Brexit stance. In May 2021, Anthony Bamford rejected an invitation to rejoin CBI, after previously having called it a &quot;waste of time&quot; that &quot;didn’t represent my business or private companies&quot;.

<text>Kristina Cruises (previously Rannikkolinjat) is a Finnish family-owned shipping company with over fifty years of experience in cruise business. The company was founded in 1985 and registered in Kotka. In addition to the five destinations in the early days of business they currently sail to more than 70 ports. Summer destinations traditionally include several ports of the Baltic Sea, Norwegian fjords and other cities in Northern Europe. In the autumn the ship usually sails in the Mediterranean, where one week cruises to many different destinations are arranged. During winter seasons their ships have sailed in Canary Islands and east coast of Africa.

They used to operate two ships, &quot;Kristina Regina&quot; (1960) made foreign cruises, often cruising in the Mediterranean Sea and other warm destinations. The second ship, &quot;Kristina Brahe&quot; (1943) was used for cruises within the lakes and coast of Finland. These ships begun to show their age and did not meet the new regulations and have now been sold. MS Kristina Katarina, originally built in 1982 as M/S Konstantin Simonov, was the latest ship.

In 2013 the company faced financial difficulties forcing Kristina Cruises to lay up its 1982-built Katarina cruise ship for the winter and cancel the season, the company today has sold the vessel to FleetProOcean.

All 2014 plans are cancelled and the company is said to be concentrating on selling cruises on other ships as a tour operator.

<doc id="1007866" wikidata="Q179660" url="?curid=1007866" title="Kalimotxo">
<text>The calimocho or kalimotxo (, ) is a drink consisting of equal parts red wine and a cola-based soft drink. 

Red wine and cola were combined in Spain as early as the 1920s, but Coca-Cola was not widely available. That changed in 1953, when the first Coca-Cola factory opened in Spain. The combination was given various names, until 1972 when its mass usage at a festival in Algorta led to it being christened the kalimotxo, a playful combination of the two creators&#x27; nicknames, Kalimero and Motxongo.

It has since become a classic of the Basque Country region and in the rest of Spain in large part due to its simple mixture, accessibility of ingredients, and low cost. Furthermore, the drink has become a favorite in parts of Southern Jutland, Denmark, and the island of Als, also Denmark.

The same mixture is known as katemba in South Africa, cátembe in Mozambique, gomnar (bamboo) in Croatia, Serbia, North Macedonia and other Balkan countries, jote (black vulture) in Chile, ColaRot in Austria, houba (mushroom) in the Czech Republic, vadász (hunter) in Hungary.

<doc id="1007870" wikidata="Q7573984" url="?curid=1007870" title="Spasmodic poets">
<text>The spasmodic poets were a group of British poets of the Victorian era. The term was coined by William Edmonstoune Aytoun with some derogatory as well as humorous intention. The epithet itself is attributed, by Thomas Carlyle, to Lord Byron. 

Spasmodic poets include George Gilfillan, the friend and inspiration of William McGonagall. Gilfillan worked for thirty years on his long poem &quot;Night&quot;, but he is best known for his encouragement of the young Spasmodics in literary reviews which he wrote under the pseudonym &quot;Apollodorus&quot;. Others associated with the group were Philip James Bailey, Richard Hengist Horne, Sydney Thompson Dobell, Alexander Smith, John Stanyan Bigg, Gerald Massey, John Westland Marston, and Ebenezer Jones. 

The term &quot;spasmodic&quot; was also applied by contemporary reviewers to Elizabeth Barrett Browning&#x27;s &quot;Aurora Leigh&quot;, Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Maud&quot;, Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, and the poetry of Arthur Hugh Clough. These poets are not generally included in the Spasmodic school by modern literary critics. Spasmodic poetry was extremely popular from the late 1840s through the 1850s when it abruptly fell out of fashion. William Edmondstoune Aytoun&#x27;s parodic &quot;Firmilian; or, The Student of Badajoz: a Spasmodic Tragedy&quot; (1854) is credited with getting the verse of the Spasmodic school laughed down as bombast.

Spasmodic poetry frequently took the form of verse drama, the protagonist of which was often a poet. It was characterized by a number of features including lengthy introspective soliloquies by the protagonist, which led to the charge that the poetry was egotistical.

<text>Jesús Gloria Molina (May 31, 1948 – May 14, 2023) was an American politician who served as a member of the Los Angeles City Council, the California State Assembly, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

Participating in the Chicano movement as a young activist, Molina entered politics in 1982, running in opposition to the powerful male-dominated Eastside political machine for a seat in the California State Assembly, becoming the first Latina elected to the assembly. She had a long unbeaten streak in electoral politics, becoming the first Latina elected to the Los Angeles City Council and to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, and served on the Board for 23 years. After terming out on the Board, Molina ran again for the Los Angeles City Council in 2015, but was defeated by incumbent José Huizar.

Molina was considered a trailblazer and helped revitalize Los Angeles&#x27;s Grand Park and supported the LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes project, and has been said to have paved the way for future female and Latina politicians. Grand Park in Los Angeles was re-named Gloria Molina Grand Park after her death in 2023.

== Early life and activism ==

Molina was born on May 31, 1948, in Montebello, California, to Leonardo Castillo Molina and Concepción Molina, who immigrated to Los Angeles from Mexico. She grew up as one of ten children in the Los Angeles suburb of Pico Rivera, attending El Rancho High School before going to East Los Angeles College and California State University, Los Angeles. While attending college, she worked full-time as a legal secretary. Then she became certified as an adult education instructor and taught clerical skills at the East Los Angeles Skills Center.

Molina&#x27;s early career was characterized by her involvement in the Chicano movement and advocating for women&#x27;s health. An early accomplishment was when she started a Nurse Mentoring Program in an effort to address the country&#x27;s shortage of nurses by partnering with local community colleges to encourage and help more students to pursue a nursing degree.

== Political career ==

Before being elected to public office, Molina served in the Carter Administration as a deputy for presidential personnel. After leaving the White House, she served in San Francisco as a deputy director for the Department of Health and Human Services. She stated to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that she had seen that men had &quot;kept dismissing the contributions of her and other women&quot;, which was why she ran for office in 1982.

=== California State Assembly ===
In 1982, Art Torres vacated his seat in California&#x27;s 56th State Assembly district due to redistricting, with Torres and Assemblymember Richard Alatorre making Richard Polanco run in the district. Molina had approached the two about running in the district, but was told that she could not since Polanco was running. She ran anyway, and defeated Polcano to become the first Latina woman to be elected in the California State Legislature. Her win would set the stage for a political feud between Torres and Molina, with supporters being called the Torristas and Molinistas.

=== Los Angeles City Council ===

In 1986, the 1st district of the Los Angeles City Council was vacant due to incumbent Howard Finn&#x27;s death, and the City Council decided that the district would be moved from the San Fernando Valley to Eastside Los Angeles. Now in a largely Latino district, Molina announced her candidacy for the special election. She was mainly challenged by Larry Gonzalez, a member of the Los Angeles Board of Education. In the election, she defeated Gonzalez and two others by a landslide, making her the first Latina woman to be elected to the City Council. She was succeeded in the State Assembly by Lucille Roybal-Allard.

While on the council, Molina feuded with Richard Alatorre, who had been elected to the council in 1985.

=== Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors ===
In 1990, Peter F. Schabarum decided not to run for re-election for the 1st district of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, but served an extra three months while the board redistricted under court orders to create a majority-Latino district. That year, Molina announced that she would be running for the seat, being challenged by U.S. Representative Matthew G. Martínez and Art Torres. The runoff election was between Molina and Torres, with Torres having a lead in fundraising for his campaign. Although Molina was at a disadvantage financially, she still defeated Torres to become the first Latina to be elected to the Board of Supervisors.

At her first meeting, she was described as &quot;[giving] hints of the in-your-face approach that sometimes characterized her years on the City Council.&quot; During her 23 years serving the Los Angeles County board of supervisors, she became known as a fiscal watchdog committed to overseeing good government reforms, maintenance of the county&#x27;s public health care system, and also quality-of-life issues for the millions of county residents living in the unincorporated areas.

One of Molina&#x27;s significant achievements was her involvement with the Mothers of East Los Angeles, a group formed to organize against a proposed plan to build a prison in East LA. As city councilwoman, she found government unresponsive to her concerns of yet another proposal to build a prison near schools in the predominantly Chicano and Mexican neighborhood. In the mid-2000s she drove through skid row looking for families with children and would call the Department of Family and Children Services, to help families and remove children from unsafe conditions.

In 2008, Molina piloted a program that became known as the Gloria Molina Foster Youth Education Program. This program attempted to improve the high school graduation rates of students in the foster care system. By committing social workers to aid in helping manage and track these students&#x27; academic success the program was able to raise the graduation rate from the national average of 58% to 80%. When Molina retired from her supervisor position in 2014 because of term limits, she stated that one of her biggest regrets was that she was not able to do more to improve the high school graduation rates amongst fostered youth.

== Post-political career ==
In 2014, facing a term limit on the Board of Supervisors, Molina announced that she was challenging 14th district incumbent José Huizar for his seat on the City Council. She had stated that she had considered retirement before being asked to run from various people, and criticized Huizar for not heeding his constituents. In the 2015 election, Huizar defeated Molina and other competitors by a landslide, avoiding the need for a runoff.

== Legislation ==
=== Anti-food truck bill ===
In April 2008, Molina introduced legislation to the board of supervisors which would severely increase penalties on food vendors in unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County, including East L.A. The new rules would punish parking of a food truck for more than one hour with a $1000 fine and/or six months in jail. This move was specifically targeted at vendors operating taco trucks, a cultural institution in East L.A. as well as the county as a whole. Newspaper editorials decried the move, and a petition was quickly set up to attempt to force a repeal of the legislation. The taco vendors also hired a lawyer to fight their cause. The ordinance was ultimately struck down by a judge.

=== Boycott of Arizona ===
In June 2010, Molina voted yes with two other Los Angeles County supervisors to boycott Arizona because of SB 1070. Molina said in her statement that the law &quot;simply goes too far&quot; and that &quot;a lot of people have pointed out that I am sworn as an L.A. County supervisor to uphold the Constitution. All I can say is that I believe that Arizona&#x27;s law is unconstitutional.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Molina was married to Ron Martinez, a businessman, with the two having a daughter, Valentina Martinez. She lived in the Los Angeles neighborhood of El Sereno.

In March 2023, Molina announced that she had been diagnosed with terminal cancer three years prior, and that she had been battling it with treatments but it had become very aggressive. She died on May 14, 2023, seventeen days before her 75th birthday.

== Honors and legacy ==
In April 2006, Molina was honored as the &quot;Hispanic Business Woman of the Year&quot; by &quot;Hispanic Business&quot; magazine. In 2014, she was awarded an honorary doctorate of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) from Whittier College. Molina also quilted, founding the East L.A. Stitchers and frequently knitting with the group until her announcement of terminal cancer.

In 2023, after Molina&#x27;s announcement of terminal cancer, Hilda Solis, Molina&#x27;s successor on the Board of Supervisors, introduced a motion to rename Grand Park to Gloria Molina Grand Park, honoring her contributions to the park&#x27;s redevelopment. It was approved unanimously by the Board of Supervisors the day it was introduced. A motion to endorse the renaming passing in the Los Angeles City Council, with Mayor Karen Bass also endorsing it. Another motion by councilmembers Monica Rodriguez and Kevin de León renamed the pedestrian crosswalks &quot;Gloria Molina Legacy Pathway&quot;. A couple of days after, the Metro Board of Directors voted to dedicate the East LA Civic Center station to Molina.

<doc id="1007885" wikidata="Q575566" url="?curid=1007885" title="Bang (Blur song)">
<text>&quot;Bang&quot; is a song by English rock band Blur, released on 29 July 1991 as the third single from their debut album, &quot;Leisure&quot;.

== Music video ==

The video, directed by Willy Smax, features the band in west London at night. Time-lapse photography of night-time traffic was used, creating streaks of light from cars&#x27; headlights. Black-and-white performance shots were also included. In later years Dave Rowntree expressed his love of the video, stating it as his favorite of the Blur catalogue. The video itself went generally unnoticed during its time of release and of all the promos, gets the least airplay on television. The video has been aired quite frequently on MTV Rocks, though, as part of their &quot;Blur Top 40&quot; list, of which it features at 26. A vinyl copy of &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; by the Beatles, &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; by Bob Dylan, and &quot;Forever Changes&quot; by Love can be found in the music video when Graham Coxon is seen playing his guitar. The board game the band is playing whilst sat at the table is Scrabble.
The music video bears similarity to &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot; by frontman Damon Albarn&#x27;s later project Gorillaz due to its shots of London and the Centre Point building.

==Release==
&quot;Bang&quot; reached number 24 in the UK Singles Chart. Its disappointing performance relative to previous single &quot;There&#x27;s No Other Way&quot; marked the end of Blur&#x27;s initial period of popularity, which would not be equalled until the release of &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot; three years later.

It has been all but disowned by the band, who claim it was written in less than 15 minutes in response to record company demands for another bankable single. It is almost never played live, and has not been included on either &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;. &quot;I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll ever play that again&quot;, Alex James remarked in 1999, having performed it during rehearsals for that year&#x27;s tour. &quot;Fuckin&#x27; hell, worst verse you ever heard. Dannii Minogue gave it &#x27;Stinker of the Week&#x27; in &quot;Number One&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="1007887" wikidata="Q1929336" url="?curid=1007887" title="Michael Scott (architect)">
<text>Michael Scott (24 June 1905 – 24 January 1989) was an Irish architect whose buildings included the Busáras building in Dublin, Cork Opera House, the Abbey Theatre and both Tullamore and Portlaoise Hospitals.

== Early life and education ==
He was born in Drogheda in 1905. His family originated in the Province of Munster. His father, William Scott, was a school inspector from near Sneem on the Iveragh Peninsula in County Kerry. His mother was from County Cork. Michael was educated at Belvedere College, Dublin.

There he first demonstrated his skills in painting and acting. Initially, he wanted to pursue a career as a painter but his father pointed out that it might make more financial sense to become an architect.

== Career ==

Scott became an apprentice for the sum of £375 per annum to the Dublin architectural firm Jones and Kelly. He remained there from 1923 until 1926, where he studied under Alfred E. Jones. In the evenings after work, he also attended the Metropolitan School of Art and the Abbey School of Acting, and appeared in many plays there until 1927, including the first productions of Seán O&#x27;Casey’s (1884-1964) Juno and the Paycock and The Plough and the Stars. On completing his pupilage he became an assistant to Charles James Dunlop and then had a brief spell as an assistant architect in the Office of Public Works.

In 1931 he partnered with Norman D. Good to form Scott and Good, and they opened an office in Dublin. Scott and Good’s designed the hospital at Tullamore (1934–37) and Portlaoise General Hospital (1935). Between 1937 and 1938, Scott was the President of the Architectural Association of Ireland (AAI Laois). He founded his company, Michael Scott Architects, in 1938. That same year he also designed his house Geragh, at Sandycove, County Dublin.

Scott’s most important pre-war commission was the Irish Pavilion for the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair in 1938. Scott produced a shamrock-shaped building constructed in steel, concrete, and glass. It was selected by an international jury as the best building in the show. As a result, Scott was presented with a silver medal for distinguished services and given honorary citizenship of the city of New York by the then Mayor Fiorello La Guardia. Other better-known architects who designed national pavilions for this World Fair included Alvar Aalto of Finland and Oscar Niemeyer (born 1907) of Brazil.

Scott had three major commissions from the Córas Iompair Éireann CIÉ, the Inchicore Chassis Works, the Donnybrook Bus Garage (1952) and, most famously, the Dublin Central Bus Station, to be known as àras Mhic Dhiarmada or Busáras. Though initially controversial, Busáras was to win Scott the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland Triennial Gold Medal for Architecture.

Scott was the founder of Rosc and the chairman of the board for many years. Rosc &#x27;67 was a large, first of its kind, Irish art exhibition which showed historic treasures from Irish history alongside hundreds of contemporary artworks. The Rosc series of exhibitions continued for 21 years.

Later, Ronnie Tallon and Robin Walker became partners, and the firm was renamed Scott Tallon Walker in 1975, shortly after the firm won the RIBA Royal Gold Medal. Scott, who spent most of his life living at Sandycove Point, just south of Dún Laoghaire in south Dublin, was buried near Sneem in County Kerry.

<doc id="1007890" wikidata="Q3610799" url="?curid=1007890" title="Alexander Smith (poet)">
<text>Alexander Smith (1829/30, probably 31 December 18295 January 1867) was a Scottish poet, labelled as one of the Spasmodic School, and essayist.

==Life==

Alexander Smith was the eldest of eight, possibly nine, children born to John Smith (1803–1884) and Christina née Murray (1804–1881). John Smith was a pattern designer for the textile trade; he worked variously in Paisley and in Kilmarnock, where Alexander was born, before moving to Glasgow when Alexander was about eight years old.

When Alexander was still at school, he was stricken by a fever that left him with a squint in one eye. Details of his schooling are sparse, but it is known that it began in Paisley and continued at a school on John Street in Glasgow. There was talk of him being trained for the ministry, but the family&#x27;s finances required that he leave school at the age of eleven and follow his father&#x27;s trade in the muslin factory.

Alexander was an avid reader, and became co-founder, with like-minded youngsters, of the Glasgow Addisonian Literary Society. Early poems were published in &quot;The Glasgow Citizen&quot;, whose proprietor and editor James Hedderwick became a patron and friend. The success of his first volume of poems, &quot;A Life Drama and other Poems&quot; (1853), brought him fame and influential supporters that led to him being appointed Secretary of Edinburgh University in 1854.

In Edinburgh, Smith was a near neighbour of the landscape painter Horatio McCulloch, who had also grown up in Glasgow, and the two became firm friends.
McCulloch&#x27;s wife, Marcella MacLellan, was from the Isle of Skye, where the Cuillin were the subjects of many of McCulloch&#x27;s paintings. He and Alexander Nicolson, a Skyeman living in Edinburgh, introduced Smith to the island. That introduction had a profound effect on Smith&#x27;s remaining years.

On 24 April 1857 Smith married Marcella&#x27;s cousin, Flora Nicolson Macdonald (1829–1873), at Ord House, her parents&#x27; home on Sleat peninsula in Skye. The couple returned to Skye every summer, and the island inspired the work for which Smith is most remembered today: &quot;A Summer in Skye&quot;.

Smith&#x27;s later years brought financial worry. His salary from the university had been increased to £200 per annum, but sales of his writing were damaged by hostile criticism. He had to support a growing family, and maintain &#x27;Gesto Villa&#x27;, a large house in Wardie that had been bought for them by an uncle of Flora who had made his fortune in India from Indigo. Although Alexander&#x27;s working hours at the university left time to write, that time was largely absorbed in entertaining his many friends and relatives.

He contracted diphtheria in November 1866. That became compounded with typhoid fever. By the end of the year he seemed to be rallying but the combination was too much. He died at home on 5 January 1867 aged 37, and was buried five days later in Warriston Cemetery.

=== Memorial ===
His 16 feet (4.87m) tall red sandstone cross stands close to the old East Gate (now sealed) of Warriston Cemetery (access is by another gate).

The memorial was designed by the artist James Drummond (1816–1877) in a Celtic cross design including a harp, poet&#x27;s laurel bay leaf wreath, and a star, and the stonework was carved with thistles and bayleaves intertwining, by the sculptor John Rhind (1828–1892). It also has a bronze head image of Smith in profile, added by William Brodie (1815 – 1881) who also sculpted Greyfriars Bobby.

The inscription is: &quot;Alexander Smith, poet and essayist. Born at Kilmarnock, 31st Dec. 1829; Died at Wardie, 5th Jan. 1867&quot;, and at the base it has carved &#x27;Erected by some of his personal friends&#x27;.

==Works==

As a poet he was one of the leading representatives of what was called the &quot;Spasmodic&quot; School, now fallen into oblivion. Smith, P. J. Bailey and Sydney Dobell were satirized by W. E. Aytoun in 1854 in &quot;Firmilian: a Spasmodic Tragedy&quot;.

In the year Sydney Dobell came to Edinburgh, an acquaintanceship sprang up between the two which resulted in their collaboration in a book of &quot;War Sonnets&quot; (1855), inspired by the Crimean War. Smith also published &quot;City Poems&quot; (1857) and &quot;Edwin of Deira&quot; (1861), a Northumbrian epic poem.

Although his early work &quot;A Life Drama&quot; was highly praised, his poetry was later less well thought of and was ridiculed as being a Spasmodic. &quot;Edwin of Deira&quot; was also attacked, unjustly, as plagiarism. Smith turned his attention to prose, and published &quot;Dreamthorp: Essays written in the Country&quot; (1863), noted especially for the essay &quot;A Lark&#x27;s Flight&quot;, in which Smith describes the song of a lark breaking the silence just before the trapdoor is sprung under two condemned men. Two years later he published his most celebrated work, &quot;A Summer in Skye&quot; (1865). As well as these and many magazine articles, he edited the Golden Treasury edition of Burns, and wrote a novel, &quot;Alfred Hagart&#x27;s Household&quot;, which was serialised in &quot;Good Words&quot; in 1865.

Smith&#x27;s 1857 poem &quot;Glasgow&quot; was adapted into song in 2022 by Revival-Folk band :Bird in the Belly for their concept album :After the City.

==Family==

Alexander and Flora had five children:
*Flora Macdonald (1858–1867)
*Jessie Catherine (Murray) (1860–1941) went to Australia where she married James Morris
*Charles Kenneth Macleod (1862–1890) died in Calcutta, India
*Marcella MacLellan (1864–1865) (7 months)
*Isabella Mary Macdonald (1866–1939) went to an uncle at Ord; she married Dr James Pender Smith.

With Alexander&#x27;s death, Flora&#x27;s life turned to tragedy. Her mother had died the previous summer. Now, in the space of three months and a few days, she lost her husband, her father, and her eldest child. Only two months after that, McCulloch, who was probably the family&#x27;s best friend in Edinburgh, died. McCulloch&#x27;s widow, Flora&#x27;s cousin, left for Australia, and died on the voyage. Flora, who had come from a beautiful and fairly isolated place, was left in a Victorian metropolis with three small children. She died in 1873, aged forty-four; her death certificate gives the causes of death as cardiac disease, apoplexy, and alcoholism.

==Quotations==

*&quot;Stirling, like a huge brooch clasps Highlands and Lowlands together&quot;.
*&quot;In Scotland one is continually coming into contact with an unreasonable prejudice against English manners, institutions, and forms of thought; and in her expression of these prejudices Scotland is frequently neither great nor dignified. There is a narrowness and touchiness about her which is more frequently found in villages than in great cities. She continually suspects that the Englishman is about to touch her thistle rudely, or to take liberties with her unicorn.&quot;

The musical is the third adaptation of the 1937 play &quot;Parfumerie&quot; by Hungarian playwright Miklós László, following the 1940 film &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot; and the 1949 musical version &quot;In the Good Old Summertime.&quot; (It surfaced again as 1998&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot;). The plot revolves around Budapest shop employees Georg and Amalia, who, despite being consistently at odds with each other at work, are unaware that each is the other&#x27;s secret pen pal met through lonely-hearts ads.

The musical premiered on Broadway in 1963 and ran for 301 performances, was produced in the West End in 1964, and received award-winning revivals on each side of the Atlantic in the 1990s (as well as numerous regional productions). Although the original Broadway run was not a financial success, &quot;She Loves Me&quot; slowly became a cult classic, and the massively successful 2016 Broadway revival became the first Broadway show ever to be live-streamed.

==Synopsis==
===Act One===
On a beautiful summer day in Budapest in 1934, the employees of Maraczek&#x27;s Parfumerie arrive at work (&quot;Good Morning, Good Day&quot;). Working at the shop are Ladislav Sipos, a fretful middle-aged salesman with a family; teenage delivery boy Arpad Laszlo; thirty-something Ilona Ritter, who is having an affair with suave Steven Kodaly; and Georg Nowack, the shy assistant manager. Mr. Maraczek arrives to open the store, and soon business is under way (&quot;Sounds While Selling&quot;/&quot;Thank You, Madam&quot;). Georg has been exchanging letters with an anonymous woman he knows only as &quot;Dear Friend&quot;, and he shares today&#x27;s romantic letter with Sipos. Maraczek advises Georg to get married and recalls being a bachelor (&quot;Days Gone By&quot;).

Arpad begins stocking the shelves with a new musical cigarette case. Mr. Maraczek insists that they will manage to sell one within an hour. A nervous young woman, Amalia Balash, enters, hoping to obtain a job at the Parfumerie. When Georg tells her they are not hiring, she demands to speak with Maraczek. Amalia takes one of the cigarette cases and convinces a customer that it is really a musical candy box that plays each time it is opened to gently tell the owner &quot;no more candy&quot; (&quot;No More Candy&quot;). Maraczek is impressed and immediately hires Amalia.

As summer turns into autumn and then into the early days of winter, tension grows in the shop. Ilona and Kodaly are at odds, Mr. Maraczek is increasingly short-tempered with Georg, and Georg and Amalia bicker constantly. Georg finds solace in his anonymous romantic pen pal, not suspecting that his correspondent is none other than Amalia (&quot;Three Letters&quot;). Their fellow employees observe their bickering, and Sipos explains to Arpad that they argue because they unknowingly like each other very much. Arpad naively suggests they tell Georg and Amalia this, and Sipos retorts that they&#x27;d never believe it. Finally, in early December, the two &quot;Dear Friends&quot; arrange to meet in person.

Maraczek humiliatingly dresses down Georg for a minor problem. Georg tells Sipos that tonight he will finally meet his &quot;dear friend&quot; (&quot;Tonight At Eight&quot;). Meanwhile, Amalia explains to Ilona that even though she has not met her &quot;dear friend&quot; yet, she knows him very well from his letters (&quot;I Don&#x27;t Know His Name&quot;).

Mr. Maraczek and Georg argue, and when it becomes obvious that Maraczek is about to fire Georg, Sipos knocks over the stack of musical cigarette boxes to distract him. Maraczek reprimands Sipos and leaves. Sipos tells Georg that no replacement would treat him as well as Georg does (&quot;Perspective&quot;). Maraczek insists that everyone stay late to decorate for Christmas, but Amalia says she must leave early for her date. Georg asks to leave too, but Mr. Maraczek refuses to let him go. Georg angrily quits, and the other employees sadly say goodbye to Georg (&quot;Goodbye Georg&quot;). Amalia leaves clutching a copy of &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; with a rose in it so that her &quot;dear friend&quot; will be able to identify her. She wonders if &quot;dear friend&quot; will like her (&quot;Will He Like Me?&quot;) Meanwhile, inside the shop, Kodaly begins seducing Ilona (&quot;Ilona&quot;). They make a date, but when Mr. Maraczek insists they must close the store early, Kodaly realizes that he has time for a 9:30 date that he previously scheduled. He postpones his date with Ilona, and she angrily declares that she will never fall for a man like him again (&quot;I Resolve&quot;). Georg is nervous and asks Sipos to give &quot;dear friend&quot; a note explaining that Georg could not come.

Mr. Maraczek&#x27;s private investigator enters the shop and tells him that Kodaly is having an affair with his wife. Maraczek had assumed it was Georg. The investigator leaves, and Maraczek&#x27;s wife calls to say she&#x27;ll be out late. Maraczek points a gun at his own head and pulls the trigger as Arpad enters the shop. Meanwhile, in the Cafe Imperiale, the head waiter is trying to maintain a romantic atmosphere as Amalia waits with her book and rose (&quot;Romantic Atmosphere&quot;). Georg and Sipos enter and are shocked to realize that Amalia is Georg&#x27;s date; however, Amalia does not know Georg is her &quot;dear friend&quot;. Georg sits at Amalia&#x27;s table and mocks her, singing a &quot;Tango Tragique&quot; about a woman who was murdered on a blind date (the show has been re-structured to where the song is not sung by Georg, but it is a dance number for the ensemble, 8-20-19). They argue, and Georg leaves. As the cafe closes, Amalia, still waiting, begs &quot;dear friend&quot; not to abandon her (&quot;Dear Friend&quot;).

===Act Two===
The next day, Mr. Maraczek has survived his suicide attempt, and Arpad comes to visit him in the hospital. Maraczek is impressed with Arpad&#x27;s hard work in his absence, and Arpad begs to be promoted to sales clerk (&quot;Try Me&quot;). Georg also stops by, and Maraczek apologizes and asks him to return to his job. Maraczek tells Georg to fire Kodaly and mentions that Amalia has called in sick.

Georg is worried about Amalia and visits her at her apartment. She fears he has come to spy on her and tell the others she is not really sick, so she attempts to get out of bed and get ready for work (&quot;Where&#x27;s My Shoe&quot;). Georg, seeing she is truly sick, forces her back to bed and presents her with a gift: vanilla ice cream. He apologizes for his rudeness the previous night, but Amalia tells him that he was right about her date; if &quot;dear friend&quot; really loved her, he would have come. Georg, meaning well, makes up a story that he saw an older, bald, fat gentleman looking into the cafe. Georg says the man told him that he had to work and could not meet his date, and Georg surmises that he must be her &quot;dear friend&quot;. Amalia is surprised to find she enjoys her conversation with Georg. After he leaves, she begins a letter to &quot;dear friend&quot; but can only think of Georg&#x27;s kindness and his gift of (&quot;Vanilla Ice Cream&quot;).

Georg joyously realizes that Amalia loves him (&quot;She Loves Me&quot;). At Maraczek&#x27;s, Ilona explains to Sipos that she has gotten over Kodaly; last night, she went to the library where she met Paul, a kindly optometrist (&quot;A Trip to the Library&quot;). Kodaly bids everyone goodbye (&quot;Grand Knowing You&quot;). With Christmas fast approaching, the employees are busy helping last-minute shoppers, and Georg and Amalia enjoy each other&#x27;s company (&quot;Twelve Days to Christmas&quot;). On Christmas Eve, Amalia tells Georg she has invited &quot;dear friend&quot; to spend the evening with her and her mother. She invites Georg as well, and he hesitatingly accepts. Mr. Maraczek returns to the shop for a happy reunion, and Ilona announces her plans to accept Paul&#x27;s proposal that night, even though he does not know he is going to propose yet. Sipos leaves to join his family&#x27;s Christmas party, and Maraczek takes Arpad for a night on the town.

Georg helps Amalia with her packages as she leaves the shop, and they accidentally drop one of the musical cigarette boxes. Amalia intends to give it to &quot;dear friend&quot;, but Georg says he really would like it; it will remind him of the day he first met her. He admits that he always thought Amalia was the sort of girl he could fall in love with. Amalia confesses to having similar feelings, and Georg takes one of Amalia&#x27;s letters to &quot;dear friend&quot; out of his pocket and begins reading it aloud. Amalia finally understands that Georg really is &quot;dear friend&quot; and they kiss (&quot;Finale&quot;).

==Productions==
Producer Lawrence Kasha brought the three writers together.

=== Original Broadway production ===
The musical premiered on Broadway on April 23, 1963, at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre not long after the settlement of the four-month-long 1962–1963 New York City newspaper strike. Nevertheless, the show managed to run for 302 performances. The musical was directed by Harold Prince and choreographed by Carol Haney, with the cast that featured Daniel Massey as Georg Nowack, Barbara Cook as Amalia Balash, Barbara Baxley as Ilona Ritter, Jack Cassidy as Stephen Kodaly, Nathaniel Frey as Ladislav Sipos, Ralph Williams as Arpad Laszlo, and Ludwig Donath as Mr. Maraczek. The romantic, old fashioned show was short on big song and dance numbers, and the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre was too small to generate a big profit. A two-record original cast recording was released by MGM Records and subsequently re-released on CD on the Polydor label in 1987.

=== West End production ===
The West End production opened on April 29, 1964, at the Lyric Theatre, where it ran for 189 performances. The cast included Gary Raymond, Rita Moreno, Anne Rogers and Gary Miller. A London cast recording was released by Angel Records.

===Faded From View===
After the original Broadway production it was 30 years before a major revival. Critic Arthur Dorman, in a review of a production in 2019, says that it was overshadowed by the big Broadway productions of that time. &quot;But,&quot; he says, &quot;a small group of fans kept a flame going for &quot;She Loves Me&quot;, which was further flamed when the original &quot;Amalia&quot;, Barbara Cook, became a staple of cabarets and concert stages and made &quot;Vanilla Ice Cream&quot; one of her signature performance pieces.&quot; Cook began her concert career on January 26, 1975 in Carnegie Hall. The concert included three songs from &quot;She Loves Me&quot;, but the New York Times review doesn’t name them.

=== First Broadway revival ===
The Roundabout Theatre Company produced a Broadway revival, directed by Scott Ellis and choreographed by Rob Marshall (assisted by his sister Kathleen). It opened on June 10, 1993, at the Criterion Center Stage Right and transferred on September 28, 1993, to the Brooks Atkinson Theatre, closing on June 19, 1994, after a total of 354 performances and 42 previews. The cast included Boyd Gaines as Georg, Judy Kuhn (replaced by Diane Fratantoni when the show transferred) as Amalia, Sally Mayes as Ilona, Howard McGillin as Kodaly, Lee Wilkof as Ladislav, Brad Kane as Arpad, and Louis Zorich as Mr. Maraczek. A revival cast recording was released by Varèse Sarabande, featuring Fratantoni as Amalia. The production was conducted by David Loud.

The West End revival, also directed by Ellis and choreographed by Marshall, opened on July 12, 1994, at the Savoy Theatre, where it ran for one year. The cast included John Gordon Sinclair as Georg, Ruthie Henshall as Amalia, and Tracie Bennett as Ilona. A revival cast recording was released on the First Night label.

=== Second Broadway revival ===
The Roundabout Theatre Company presented a revival in 2016, again directed by Scott Ellis and choreographed by Warren Carlyle, on Broadway which opened at Studio 54 on March 17 following previews from February 19 in a limited engagement to June 5. The production starred Laura Benanti as Amalia, Zachary Levi as Georg, Jane Krakowski as Ilona, Gavin Creel as Kodaly, Byron Jennings as Maraczek, and Michael McGrath as Sipos. On December 2, 2015, it was announced that Byron Jennings would play the role of Maraczek, replacing René Auberjonois. The revival&#x27;s run was extended to July 10, 2016, and Tom McGowan replaced Michael McGrath in the role of Sipos beginning May 10, 2016.

Following the huge success of the 2016 Broadway revival, the musical was revived in London&#x27;s West End at the Menier Chocolate Factory, opening on November 25, 2016, in previews, officially on December 7, for a limited run through March 5, 2017. Directed by Matthew White, the cast starred Scarlett Strallen as Amalia Balash.

==== 2016 live broadcast ====

The June 30, 2016, performance of the Roundabout revival of &quot;She Loves Me&quot; was presented via BroadwayHD live stream, marking the first time a Broadway show had ever been broadcast live. The historic broadcast was screened in cinemas on December 1, 2016.

=== Other productions ===
A limited run of concert performances was held in March 1977 at The Town Hall in New York City, and featured Madeline Kahn as Amalia, Barry Bostwick as Georg, Rita Moreno as Ilona, George Rose as Mr. Maraczek, and Laurence Guittard as Kodaly.

A slightly abridged BBC-TV production was made in 1978 starring Gemma Craven as Amalia, Robin Ellis as Georg, and David Kernan as Kodaly.

The Oregon Shakespeare Festival, in Ashland, Oregon, staged a production as part of its 2010 season, running from February through October in the Angus Bowmer Theater.

A critically acclaimed, small-scale Australian production opened at Sydney&#x27;s Hayes Theatre Company, which began previews on 22 August 2018. The show featured Rowan Witt as Georg opposite Caitlin Berry as Amalia, with Tony Llewellyn-Jones as Maraczek. The production was directed by Erin James.

==Characters and original cast==
== Cancelled film adaptation ==
MGM bought the screen rights for the musical in 1967 with plans to make it into a film starring Julie Andrews and to be directed by Harold Prince. After a year of delays, MGM moved forward with the film with a revised production in 1969. Julie Andrews was still set to play Amalia; however Blake Edwards was now set to direct. Dick Van Dyke was strongly considered for the role of Georg which would have reunited Andrews and Van Dyke for the first time since &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; in 1964. Maurice Chevalier was among those considered for the role of Maraczek. Production was well underway when Kirk Kerkorian bought MGM and installed James T. Aubrey Jr. to run the studio to make sweeping changes. 

With a major company restructuring and focus shifting to more youth oriented films, the musical was among the many projects abruptly dropped.

<text>Bronson Canyon, or Bronson Caves, is a section of Griffith Park in Los Angeles that has become known as a filming location for many films and television series, especially Westerns and science fiction, from the early days of motion pictures to the present.

==Location and history==
Bronson Canyon is located in the southwest section of Griffith Park near the north end of Canyon Drive, which is an extension of Bronson Avenue. In 1903, the Union Rock Company founded a quarry, originally named Brush Canyon, for excavation of crushed rock used in the construction of city streets–carried out of the quarry by electric train on the Brush Canyon Line. The quarry ceased operation in the late 1920s, leaving the caves behind. The caves became known as the Bronson Caves after the nearby avenue and a hill of that name, giving the area its more popular name of Bronson Canyon. The same street may have indirectly provided the stage name for actor Charles Bronson, as the former Charles Buchinsky is believed to have chosen that name in 1954 after seeing it on a street sign in Hollywood.

The craggy quarry remains are pockmarked by what appear to be cave openings, and therefore create an ideal backdrop for filming scenes meant to take place in a lonely southwestern wilderness. Scenes of the main cave entrance are normally filmed in a manner that shows the entrance at an angle because the cave is actually a very short tunnel through the hill, with the rear opening easily visible in a direct shot. The most well-known appearance of the tunnel entrance is likely its use as the entrance to the Batcave in the 1966–68 &quot;Batman&quot; television series.

Because so many films, in practically every genre, have had scenes filmed there over the last 100 years, the impression of a wide mountainous area has been created in film viewer&#x27;s minds. In fact the canyon is a rather small v-shaped area with the caves in the middle apex.

<text>Hugh Leonard (9 November 1926 – 12 February 2009) was an Irish dramatist, television writer, and essayist. In a career that spanned 50 years, Leonard wrote nearly 30 full-length plays, 10 one-act plays, three volumes of essay, two autobiographies, three novels, numerous screenplays and teleplays, and a regular newspaper column.

==Life and career==
Leonard was born in Dublin as John Joseph Byrne, but was put up for adoption. Raised in Dalkey, an affluent suburb of Dublin, by Nicholas and Margaret Keyes, he changed his name to John Keyes Byrne. For the rest of his life, despite the pen name of &quot;Hugh Leonard&quot;, which he later adopted and by which became well known, he invited close friends to call him &quot;Jack&quot;.

Leonard was educated at the Harold Boys&#x27; National School, Dalkey, and Presentation College, Glasthule, winning a scholarship to the latter. He worked as a civil servant for 14 years. During that time, he both acted in and wrote plays for community theatre groups. His first play to be professionally produced was &quot;The Big Birthday&quot;, which was mounted by the Abbey Theatre in Dublin in 1956. His career with the Abbey Theatre continued until 1994. After that, his plays were produced regularly by Dublin&#x27;s theatres.

He moved to Manchester for a while, working for Granada Television, before returning to Ireland in 1970, settling in Dalkey.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Leonard was the first major Irish writer to establish a reputation in television writing extensively for television, including original plays, comedies, thrillers, and adaptations of classic novels for British television. He was commissioned by RTÉ to write &quot;Insurrection&quot;, a 50th-anniversary dramatic reconstruction of the Irish uprising of Easter 1916. Leonard&#x27;s Silent Song, adapted for the BBC from a short story by Frank O&#x27;Connor, won the Prix Italia in 1967. He wrote the script for the RTÉ adaptation of &quot;Strumpet City&quot; by James Plunkett.

Three of Leonard&#x27;s plays have been presented on Broadway: &quot;The Au Pair Man&quot; (1973), which starred Charles Durning and Julie Harris; &quot;Da&quot; (1978); and &quot;A Life&quot; (1980). Of these, &quot;Da&quot; – which premiered at the Olney Theatre in 1973 before being produced off-off-Broadway at the Hudson Guild Theatre and then transferring to the Morosco Theatre – was the most successful, running for 20 months and 697 performances, then touring the United States for 10 months. It earned Leonard both a Tony Award and a Drama Desk Award for Best Play. It was made into a film in 1988, starring Martin Sheen and Barnard Hughes, who reprised his Tony Award-winning Broadway performance.

In 1984, Leonard discovered his accountant Russell Murphy had embezzled IR£258,000 from him. Leonard was particularly upset that Murphy had used his money to take clients to the theatre and purchased expensive seats at some of Leonard&#x27;s plays.

Leonard wrote two volumes of autobiography, &quot;Home Before Night&quot; (1979) and &quot;Out After Dark&quot; (1989). Some of his essays and journalism were collected in &quot;Leonard&#x27;s Last Book&quot; (1978) and &quot;A Peculiar People and Other Foibles&quot; (1979). In 1992 the &quot;Selected Plays of Hugh Leonard&quot; was published. Until 2006 he wrote a humorous weekly column, &quot;The Curmudgeon&quot;, for the Irish &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; newspaper. He had a passion for cats and restaurants, and an abhorrence of broadcaster Gay Byrne.

In 1994, Leonard gave a review of &quot;Katie Roche&quot;&#x27; by Irish playwright Teresa Deevy which was performed in the Peacock Theatre, and he recalls his own acting role in an undated amateur production of &#x27;Temporal Powers&#x27; which Teresa Deevy attended.

Even after retiring as a &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; columnist, Leonard displayed an acerbic humour. In an interview with Brendan O&#x27;Connor, he was asked if it galled him that Gay Byrne was now writing his old column. His reply was, &quot;It would gall me more if he was any good at it.&quot; Leonard was a patron of the Dublin Theatre Festival.

In 1994, Leonard appeared in a televised interview with Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Féin, an Irish political party associated with the Provisional Irish Republican Army. Leonard had long been an opponent of paramilitary groups and a critic of the IRA. However, on the show and afterwards he was criticised for being &quot;sanctimonious and theatrical&quot; towards Adams; at one point he referred to Sinn Féin as &quot;dogs&quot;.

&quot;Hugh Leonard- Odd Man In&quot;, a film on his life and work, shown on RTÉ in March 2009. Leonard&#x27;s final play, &quot;Magicality,&quot; was not performed during his lifetime; a rehearsed reading of the second act was staged at the Dalkey Castle and Heritage Centre in June 2012.

Leonard died in his hometown, Dalkey, aged 82, after a long illness, leaving €1.5 million in his will.

<doc id="1007903" wikidata="Q5532513" url="?curid=1007903" title="Generalized singular value decomposition">
<text>In linear algebra, the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) is the name of two different techniques based on the singular value decomposition (SVD). The two versions differ because one version decomposes two matrices (somewhat like the higher-order or tensor SVD) and the other version uses a set of constraints imposed on the left and right singular vectors of a single-matrix SVD.

==First version: two-matrix decomposition==
The generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) is a matrix decomposition on a pair of matrices which generalizes the singular value decomposition. It was introduced by Van Loan in 1976 and later developed by Paige and Saunders, which is the version described here. In contrast to the SVD, the GSVD decomposes simultaneously a pair of matrices with the same number of columns. The SVD and the GSVD, as well as some other possible generalizations of the SVD, are extensively used in the study of the conditioning and regularization of linear systems with respect to quadratic semi-norms. In the following, let formula_1, or formula_2. 

=== Definition === 

The generalized singular value decomposition of matrices formula_3 and formula_4 isformula_5where
* formula_6 is unitary, 
* formula_7 is unitary, 
* formula_8 is unitary,
*formula_9is unitary,
*formula_10 is real diagonal with positive diagonal, and contains the non-zero singular values of formula_11 in decreasing order,
* formula_12,
* formula_13 is real non-negative block-diagonal, where formula_14 with formula_15, formula_16, and formula_17,
* formula_18 is real non-negative block-diagonal, where formula_19 with formula_20, formula_21, and formula_22,
* formula_23,
* formula_24,
* formula_25,
* formula_26.

We denote formula_27, formula_28, formula_29, and formula_30. While formula_31 is diagonal, formula_32 is not always diagonal, because of the leading rectangular zero matrix; instead formula_33 is &quot;bottom-right-diagonal&quot;. 

=== Variations ===

There are many variations of the GSVD. These variations are related to the fact that it is always possible to multiply formula_34 from the left by formula_35 where formula_36 is an arbitrary unitary matrix. We denote 

* formula_37 
* formula_38, where formula_39 is upper-triangular and invertible, and formula_40 is unitary. Such matrices exist by RQ-decomposition.
* formula_41. Then formula_42 is invertible. 

Here are some variations of the GSVD: 

* MATLAB (gsvd):formula_43 
* LAPACK (LA_GGSVD):formula_44 
* Simplified:formula_45

=== Generalized singular values ===

A &quot;generalized singular value&quot; of formula_46 and formula_47 is a pair formula_48 such that 

formula_49We have 

*formula_50
*formula_51
By these properties we can show that the generalized singular values are exactly the pairs formula_52. We haveformula_53Therefore
:formula_54
This expression is zero exactly when formula_55 and formula_56 for some formula_57.

In, the generalized singular values are claimed to be those which solve formula_58. However, this claim only holds when formula_59, since otherwise the determinant is zero for every pair formula_48; this can be seen by substituting formula_61 above.

=== Generalized inverse ===

Define formula_62 for any invertible matrix formula_36 , formula_64 for any zero matrix formula_65, and formula_66 for any block-diagonal matrix. Then defineformula_67It can be shown that formula_68 as defined here is a generalized inverse of formula_69; in particular a formula_70-inverse of formula_69. Since it does not in general satisfy formula_72, this is not the Moore–Penrose inverse; otherwise we could derive formula_73 for any choice of matrices, which only holds for certain class of matrices. 

Suppose formula_74, where formula_75 and formula_76. This generalized inverse has the following properties:

* formula_77
* formula_78
* formula_79
*formula_80
*formula_81
* formula_82
* formula_83
* formula_84

=== Quotient SVD ===

A &quot;generalized singular ratio&quot; of formula_46 and formula_47 is formula_87. By the above properties, formula_88. Note that formula_81 is diagonal, and that, ignoring the leading zeros, contains the singular ratios in decreasing order. If formula_47 is invertible, then formula_91 has no leading zeros, and the generalized singular ratios are the singular values, and formula_92 and formula_93 are the matrices of singular vectors, of the matrix formula_94. In fact, computing the SVD of formula_95 is one of the motivations for the GSVD, as &quot;forming formula_96 and finding its SVD can lead to unnecessary and large numerical errors when formula_97 is ill-conditioned for solution of equations&quot;. Hence the sometimes used name &quot;quotient SVD&quot;, although this is not the only reason for using GSVD. If formula_47 is not invertible, then formula_99is still the SVD of formula_100 if we relax the requirement of having the singular values in decreasing order. Alternatively, a decreasing order SVD can be found by moving the leading zeros to the back: formula_101, where formula_102 and formula_103 are appropriate permutation matrices. Since rank equals the number of non-zero singular values, formula_104.

=== Construction ===
Let 

* formula_105 be the SVD of formula_11, where formula_107 is unitary, and formula_108 and formula_109 are as described,
* formula_110, where formula_111 and formula_112,
* formula_113, where formula_114 and formula_115,
* formula_116 by the SVD of formula_117, where formula_92, formula_31 and formula_120 are as described,
* formula_121 by a decomposition similar to a QR-decomposition, where formula_93 and formula_33 are as described.

Thenformula_124We also haveformula_125Thereforeformula_126Since formula_127 has orthonormal columns, formula_128. Thereforeformula_129We also have for each formula_130 such that formula_131 thatformula_132Therefore formula_133, andformula_134

== Applications ==
The GSVD, formulated as a comparative spectral decomposition, has been successfully applied to signal processing and data science, e.g., in genomic signal processing.

These applications inspired several additional comparative spectral decompositions, i.e., the higher-order GSVD (HO GSVD) and the tensor GSVD. 

It has equally found applications to estimate the spectral decompositions of linear operators when the eigenfunctions are parameterized with a linear model, i.e. a reproducing kernel Hilbert space.

==Second version: weighted single-matrix decomposition==
The weighted version of the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) is a constrained matrix decomposition with constraints imposed on the left and right singular vectors of the singular value decomposition. This form of the &quot;GSVD&quot; is an extension of the &quot;SVD&quot; as such. Given the &quot;SVD&quot; of an &quot;m×n&quot; real or complex matrix &quot;M&quot;
:formula_135
where
:formula_136
Where &quot;I&quot; is the identity matrix and where formula_137 and formula_138 are orthonormal given their constraints (formula_139 and formula_140). Additionally, formula_139 and formula_140 are positive definite matrices (often diagonal matrices of weights). This form of the &quot;GSVD&quot; is the core of certain techniques, such as generalized principal component analysis and Correspondence analysis.

The weighted form of the &quot;GSVD&quot; is called as such because, with the correct selection of weights, it &quot;generalizes&quot; many techniques (such as multidimensional scaling and linear discriminant analysis).

<doc id="1007907" wikidata="Q4824416" url="?curid=1007907" title="Australian Medical Association">
<text>The Australian Medical Association (AMA) is an independent professional association for Australian doctors and medical students. The association is not a government authority and does not regulate or certify doctors, a responsibility which lies with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency. The association&#x27;s national headquarters are located in Barton, Australian Capital Territory, in addition to the offices of its branches in each of the states and territories in Australia.

The organisation aims to lead health policy debate. It is based on a structure of state branches and committees. The AMA advocates to promote and protect the interests of doctors in Australia, and medical patient care. It has around 30,000 members forming the largest voluntary association of doctors in Australia. The AMA has traditionally been a politically conservative body, although the AMA officially endorses trials to use pill testing.

The AMA offers an Indigenous Medical Scholarship. It has formed an Equity, Inclusion and Diversity Committee. The current president is Dr Danielle McMullen. The BMA Branches of the Australian states and territories formally merged into the Australian Medical Association in 1962.

==Aims and objectives==
The AMA has a range of representative and scientific committees. One of its stated aims is &quot;leading the health policy debate by developing and promoting alternative policies to those government policies that the AMA considers poorly targeted or ill-informed; responding to issues in the health debate through the provision of a wide range of expert resources; and commissioning and conducting research on health issues.&quot;.

==Membership and demographics==
The AMA represents slightly fewer than 30% of all Australian doctors, which is the largest voluntary association of doctors in Australia. This is down from previous levels of 95% in 1962 and 50% in 1987. The rate of membership amongst Australian GPs is lower than for other doctors, with approximately 6,000 out of 45,000 GPs being AMA members. Engagement of GPs by the AMA is lower than for the RACGP and ACRRM. In 2020, the incoming AMA President Omar Khorshid claimed in an interview that the AMA could still advocate on behalf of all doctors, even though only 30% of doctors supported the AMA through membership.

There are 150 officially recognised specialty medical Colleges in Australia. The AMA offers only the 11 largest out of the 15 representation on AMA Federal Council with the smaller Colleges currently ineligible for representation. The official Australian medical colleges that do not have representation within the AMA are Australasian College of Sport and Exercise Physicians, Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine, College of Intensive Care Medicine and the Royal Australasian College of Medical Administrators.

The AMA offers an Indigenous Medical Scholarship. It has called upon the Federal government to spend more on Indigenous Health in a number of areas. However, the AMA lobbied against equitable time-tiered Medicare consultation rebates for different specialists, which was proposed by the MBS Review Taskforce. Inability to access equitable time-tiered MBS rebates for Sport &amp; Exercise Medicine specialists under Medicare is an important issue for Indigenous Australians. In 2020, the AMA President Tony Bartone criticised attendees at the Black Lives Matter rallies in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic for attending a large gathering, although AMA (WA) President Andrew Miller was supportive.

The AMA formed an Equity, Inclusion and Diversity Committee (EIDC) in 2016, which produced an anti-racism statement in 2018 . The AMA held a Gender Equity Summit in 2019 and set targets to improve female representation on AMA Boards and Committees, aiming for &gt;=40%. The AMA has only had two female Presidents in its history. In early 2020, less than 20% of members on AMA Federal Council were female. After elections in mid-2020, this had increased to 27% of members on Federal council being female. In 2017, 42% of doctors were female in Australia.

==History==

===Colonial medical associations===

====New South Wales====

The Medico-Chirurgical Association of Australia was formed in 1844 aiming to &quot;maintain and secure the dignity and the privileges of the medical and surgical profession in this colony&quot;. Prominent surgeon and former convict William Bland was a founding member, but the organisation was short-lived. In 1850, Irish-trained physician Henry Douglass revived the Australian Philosophical Society (later the Royal Society of New South Wales), which included Charles Nicholson and a number of other doctors as members.

In 1858, English-trained physician James Robertson established a body called the Australian Medical Association (AMA), whose members were primarily from Sydney but also included some Queenslanders. Bland was elected as the organisation&#x27;s president and it recorded over 110 members in its early years. However, it did not survive Robertson and Bland&#x27;s subsequent deaths and was wound up in 1869.

Following the demise of the original AMA, unsuccessful attempts at revival were made by Frederick Milford and Charles Nathan. In 1876, Nicholson established a medical section of the Royal Society with the aid of Normand MacLaurin and Philip Sydney Jones. A New South Wales branch of the BMA was established in 1880, receiving official recognition on the same date as the South Australian branch.

====Queensland====
The Queensland Medical Society was established in 1871 with Kearsay Cannan as president and Joseph Bancroft as secretary. Following conflict between members, it was replaced by the Medical Society of Queensland (MSQ) in 1882 with Kevin Izod O&#x27;Doherty as inaugural president, later replaced by Bancroft. The society was complemented by the Queensland Medico-Ethical Association led by surgeon John Thomson. After Bancroft&#x27;s death in 1894, Queensland followed the other colonies in establishing a branch of the BMA, with ophthalmologist William Frederick Taylor as inaugural branch president.

====South Australia====
The South Australian Medical Association was established in 1872 with surgeon William Gosse as president, but it was wound up in 1881. Many physicians were also prominent in the Royal Society of South Australia, including Joseph Verco, George Mayo and Edward Charles Stirling. South Australia was the first colony to establish a branch of the British Medical Association, doing so in 1879 with Gosse as president and Thomas Wilson Corbin as secretary. The South Australian branch of the BMA proved to be the most active in Australia, lobbying for the creation of a medical school at the University of Adelaide, organising the first Intercolonial Medical Congress in 1887, and encouraging other colonies to also affiliate with the BMA.

====Tasmania====
Several physicians were prominent in the Royal Society of Tasmania, established in 1843, including state premiers James Agnew and William Crowther. However, it was not until 1896 that Agnew established a medical section of the Royal Society, which functioned as the main medical organisation in Tasmania for 15 years. Attempts to establish a branch of the BMA were made as early as the 1880s, driven by Victorian-trained doctors. In 1897 a sub-branch of the Victorian BMA was formed in Launceston, which lasted until 1904. A Tasmanian branch of the BMA was eventually established in 1911, but was marked by conflict between groups from Launceston and Hobart. The branch was split into northern and southern sections in 1925.

====Victoria====
The Port Phillip Medical Association was established in 1846 with a membership drawn from the Port Phillip District of New South Wales. It was disbanded in 1851, the same year that the district became the separate colony of Victoria, but the following year was replaced by a new Victorian Medical Association (VMA) with David Elliot Wilkie as president. A rival Medical-Chirurgical Association of Victoria (MCA) was established in 1853 by William McCrea, joined by a number of independent bodies in gold rush districts such as Castlemaine, Mount Alexander, Bendigo and Ballarat.

The VMA and MCA merged in 1855 to form the Medical Society of Victoria (MSV). With James Edward Neild as honorary secretary, the MSV established a medical library and began publishing the &quot;Australian Medical Journal&quot;. However, it suffered from a series of internal conflicts between members and in 1868 was joined by a rival Medical Association of Victoria (MAV), publishing an alternative &quot;Australian Medical Gazette&quot;. In 1879, Neild resigned from the MSV over its failure to support him in a lawsuit and led moves to establish Victorian branch of the BMA, with surgeon William Gilbee as president. The MSV and BMA alternated between periods of enmity and cooperation until 1906, when they formally merged. Surgeon George Adlington Syme and Harry Brookes Allen were prominent supporters of the merger.

====Western Australia====
Due to its small population and distance from the other colonies, no serious attempts to establish a medical association in Western Australia were made until the 1880s. The Western Australian Medical Association was established in 1897, but lasted less than a year before a local branch of the BMA was set up with Alfred Waylen as inaugural president.

===Later history===

In 1911, the South Australian branch of the BMA resolved that a federal committee be established to co-ordinate activities with the other Australian branches. The motion was made by William Thornborough Hayward.

The BMA Branches of the Australian states and territories formally merged into the Australian Medical Association in 1962.

==Coat of arms==
==Positions==
The AMA has traditionally been a conservative (rather than progressive) body, often opposing change rather than lobbying for change within medicine. For example, the AMA released a press release in early 2019 claiming an &quot;Advocacy breakthrough&quot; which in fact was to &quot;oppose changes&quot; being considered under a wide-ranging review of the Medicare Benefits Schedule. Historically the AMA has tended to oppose &quot;government interference in the practice of medicine&quot; advocating on behalf of the service-providers (doctors) rather than the consumers (patients). The AMA has been recently criticised for accepting the Australian Federal Government&#x27;s JobSeeker subsidy during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia despite being profitable during 2020.

===Climate change===

The AMA acknowledges the scientific consensus that climate change is real and anthropogenic. In September 2019, the AMA officially declared climate change a public health emergency, stating that &quot;The scientific reality is that climate change affects health and well-being by increasing the situations in which infectious diseases can be transmitted, and through more extreme weather events, particularly heatwaves.&quot;

Tony Bartone, AMA President, noted that climate change will cause &quot;higher mortality and morbidity from heat stress; injury and mortality from increasingly severe weather events; increases in the transmission of vector-borne diseases; food insecurity resulting from declines in agricultural outputs; a higher incidence of mental-ill health&quot;.

The AMA has agreed with Doctors for the Environment Australia (DEA) that the healthcare sector in Australia should aim for a 80% reduction in emissions by 2030, but the AMA is still supportive of medical procedures with a poor evidence-base that could be considered wasteful and a source of excess emissions. For example, the AMA lobbied the Australian government to continue to fund spinal fusion as a surgical treatment under Medicare, even when there was substantial evidence that spinal fusion is an ineffective procedure and plans were in place to de-fund this surgery.

The AMA has called on the Australian Government to:
* Adopt mitigation targets within an Australian carbon budget
* Promote the health benefits of addressing climate change
* Develop a National Strategy for Health and Climate Change
* Promote an active transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy
* Establish a National Sustainable Development Unit to reduce carbon emissions in the healthcare sector.

===Community pill-testing===
The AMA officially endorses trials to use pill-testing at community events such as festivals. AMA President Dr Tony Bartone publicly declared his support for pill-testing at festivals, stating that it would provide &quot;an opportunity to try and inform [drug users] about the dangerous consequences and try to get an opportunity to give them education and access to rehabilitation in terms of trying to reduce their drug dependency.&quot; NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian rejected the AMA&#x27;s call for pill testing.

=== COVID-19 ===
In June 2021, AMA President Omar Khorshid advocated for the construction of “purpose-built quarantine facilities” across each state and territory in Australia, particularly areas with significant international travel.

<doc id="1007909" wikidata="Q380529" url="?curid=1007909" title="Vladimir Nazor">
<text>Vladimir Nazor (30 May 1876 – 19 June 1949) was a Croatian poet and politician. During and after World War II in Yugoslavia, he served as the first President of the Presidium of the Croatian Parliament (Croatian head of state), and first Speaker of the Croatian Parliament.

Nazor is a well-known poet, writer, translator, and humanist. He was not an active politician until 1941, but had a significant political influence through ethical aspects of his work during prewar Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

== Early career ==
Nazor&#x27;s early work paralleled the rise of the Young Croatian literary movement. He acquired much literary popularity in Croatia writing about folk legends and stories, including &quot;Big Joseph&quot; (&quot;Veli Jože&quot;) (1908), which features a helpful and kind hearted giant named Jože living in the town of Motovun (Inner Istria). His verses in &quot;Hrvatski kraljevi&quot; (&quot;Croatian Kings&quot;) (1912) established him as a prominent patriot poet. &quot;Istrian Tales&quot; (&quot;Istarske priče&quot;) (1913) showcased his storytelling style. By illuminating the personality of the South Slavs through tales of Croatia, he contributed to the creation of the Yugoslav national consciousness.

Nazor supported the opposition alliance led by Vladko Maček in the 1938 Yugoslavian election. During World War II, on 30 December 1941, Nazor became a member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts by government decree. In 1942 he escaped from Zagreb with poet Ivan Goran Kovačić in a boat across the river Kupa, sublimed in the poem &quot;The Boat on the Kupa&quot; (&quot;Čamac na Kupi&quot;), and then joined the Partisans. However, there is also a different story related to Nazor&#x27;s alleged escape. According to the Croatian writer and politician Nedjeljko Mihanović (citing a testimony from Nazor&#x27;s sister), Nazor, who at the time was old and had health issues, did not escape on his own will but was abducted by communist agents for propaganda purposes and later forced to collaborate with the new government. Nazor became one of Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s closest associates and the President of Croatia&#x27;s World War II assembly, the ZAVNOH. He went on to write a war diary &quot;With Partisans&quot; (&quot;S partizanima&quot;) (1943–1945).

Nazor began his political career as the head of the State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia (ZAVNOH), the provisional Croatian World War II deliberative assembly, before becoming head of the first post-war Croatian National Parliament (&quot;Narodni Sabor&quot;). In that post, he was, by law, concurrently the first (non-monarchical) head of state of Croatia, and the &quot;de facto&quot; first head of state of the current Croatian republic. His position carried little real political power, which was instead invested in the office of the President of the Government and informally with the Secretary of the Communist Party of Croatia.

Nazor&#x27;s opus after WWII mostly consisted of works strongly supportive of Tito&#x27;s communist regime. His hagiographic poem &quot;Titov Naprijed&quot; (Tito&#x27;s Forward) was famously memorized by generations of schoolchildren throughout Yugoslavia well into the 80s. Other poems such as &quot;Drug Tito&quot; (Comrade Tito), &quot;Naš vođa&quot; (Our Leader), &quot;Uz Maršala Tita&quot; (With Marshal Tito), and many others had a similar socialist realism style bolstering Tito&#x27;s cult of personality. However, it is a matter of debate whether Nazor really became a fervent communist or supported the regime mostly out of fear and opportunism. Reflecting on his position under the communist government in his diary &quot;Večernje bilješke&quot; (1945), Nazor notes &quot;They gave me a lot of honor but no power!&quot; (&quot;Doduše, dodijeliše mi čast, ali ne i vlast!&quot;).

== As a poet ==

One of Nazor&#x27;s main prose works is the extensive novel &quot;Loda the Shepherd&quot; (&quot;Pastir Loda&quot;) (1938). The work describes the history of his native island of Brač as told by Loda, a faun, one of the last of that kind on the island.

In poetry, Nazor&#x27;s creative way began with metaphysical transcendental philosophy and materialistic revolutionary action, prior to rational scheme and harmonic larpourlartistic crystal structure and interior protest against artistic verbalizing in Futurism, Dadaism, Expressionism, and Surrealism, as well as instructive didactics of socialist realism. Therefore, his opus incorporates a variety of style tendencies, from neoclassical and surrealistic to symbolism. Some of his works contain rhythm forcing, vowels shortening for adjusting the number of syllables and progressing the sentence to the next verse, as well as his use of unusual and archaic words

Nazor wrote over 500 poems. The early phase of Nazor&#x27;s poetry work is mostly object of scholars&#x27; research now, but &quot;Galérien&#x27;s Poeme&quot; (&quot;Galiotova pesan&quot;) from that time (1903), describing suffering and sadness of a galley slave, attains universal meaning as condemnation of oppression and still stands as one of the most expressive disapproval of slavery.

Nazor reached the highest scope in poems of so-called pagan phase, published in books of verse &quot;Lyrics&quot; (&quot;Lirika&quot;) (1910) and &quot;New Poems&quot; (&quot;Nove pjesme&quot;) (1913).

Vladimir Nazor spoke several languages and translated Italian (Dante – Divina Commedia, Giosuè Carducci, Giovanni Pascoli, Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio), German (Goethe, Heine), French (Hugo, Alfred de Musset), and English (Shakespeare).

Nazor was buried in Mirogoj Cemetery. Since 1959, Croatia has named a state award for artistic achievement the Vladimir Nazor Award. In 2008, a total of 306 streets in Croatia were named after Nazor, making him the second most common person eponym of streets in the country behind Matija Gubec.

<text>The UCL Slade School of Fine Art (informally The Slade) is the art school of University College London (UCL) and is based in London, England. It has been ranked as the UK&#x27;s top art and design educational institution. The school is organised as a department of UCL&#x27;s Faculty of Arts and Humanities.

==History==

The school traces its roots back to 1868 when lawyer and philanthropist Felix Slade (1788–1868) bequeathed funds to establish three Chairs in Fine Art, to be based at Oxford University, Cambridge University and University College London, where six studentships were endowed.

Distinguished past teachers include Henry Tonks, Wilson Steer, Randolph Schwabe, William Coldstream, Andrew Forge, Lucian Freud, John Hilliard, Bruce McLean, Alfred Gerrard and Phyllida Barlow. Edward Allington was Professor of Fine Art and Head of Graduate Sculpture until his death in 2017.

Two of its most important periods were immediately before, and immediately after, the turn of the twentieth century, described by Henry Tonks as its two &#x27;crises of brilliance&#x27;. The first included the students Augustus John, William Orpen and Percy Wyndham Lewis; the second – which has been chronicled in David Boyd Haycock&#x27;s &quot;A Crisis of Brilliance: Five Young British Artists and the Great War&quot; (Old Street Publishing, 2009) – included the students Dora Carrington, Mark Gertler, Paul Nash, C.R.W. Nevinson and Stanley Spencer. 

Another notable period followed the Second World War, under the directorship of William Coldstream, who brought in Lucian Freud to teach, and whose students included Paula Rego, Michael Andrews and the filmmaker Lorenza Mazzetti. Coldstream was responsible for the creation of the Slade Film Department, the first in any British university, in 1960, with Thorold Dickinson as chief lecturer. Filmmakers associated with the Slade Film Department include Derek Jarman and Peter Whitehead.

==Slade Centre for Electronic Media in Fine Art==
The Slade Centre for Electronic Media in Fine Art (SCEMFA) was opened in 1995. The centre provides opportunities for research into electronic media and fine art with the goal of contributing to debate on national and international levels. The Slade had previously been home to Malcolm Hughes&#x27;s Computer and Experimental Department in the 1970s.

In 1997 SCEMFA presented &quot;Collision&quot;, a public lecture series by artists, writers, and curators working with interactivity, telematics, and digital works. This exhibition was followed by &quot;Spontaneous Reaction&quot;, a week-long seminar funded by the Arts Council of England, which took a critical look at interactivity with participants from a variety of disciplines, including psychology, architecture, and computer science.

Throughout 1998, SCEMFA collaborated with Channel 4 UK to organise &quot;Cached&quot;, a monthly event held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London. Funded by the Arts Council, this series investigated the conceptual and practical issues of producing art for the internet through a series of artists presentations.

== Art collection ==
The Slade art collection was started when the yearly prizes awarded to top students was combined with a collection scheme in 1897 and the Summer Composition Prize and the Figure and Head Painting Prizes began to be kept by the school. Works by students and staff of the Slade School of Fine Art form the basis of the UCL Art museum today.

==Rankings==
In a 2008 survey conducted by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; the Slade recorded perfect scores.

<text>For data storage, identification is the capability to find, retrieve, report, change, or delete specific data without ambiguity. This applies especially to information stored in databases. In database normalisation, the process of organizing the fields and tables of a relational database to minimize redundancy and dependency, is the central, defining function of the discipline.

<text>Friedrich Flick (10 July 1883 – 20 July 1972) was a German industrialist and convicted Nazi war criminal. After the Second World War, he reconstituted his businesses, becoming the richest person in West Germany, and one of the richest people in the world, at the time of his death in 1972.

==Early life==
Born in Ernsdorf (today, Kreuztal) in the Prussian Province of Westphalia, Flick began his career as a clerk in the iron industry. A shrewd businessman, he was on the Board of Directors of an iron foundry by 1915 at age 32, becoming General Director four years later. He amassed a fortune during World War I and became extremely wealthy under the Weimar Republic, establishing major industrial concerns in the coal and steel industries. 

He profited from speculation, and stock deals. A conservative, he donated to many different mainstream political parties under the Weimar regime, and contributed greatly to the election campaign of conservative President Paul von Hindenburg. In 1932, he contributed 50,000 &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; (RM) to the up and coming Nazi Party.
==Nazi Party involvement==
After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Flick increased his financial support to them, and it is estimated that he contributed over 7.65 million RM by the fall of the regime in 1945. He became a member of the Keppler Circle, later called the Circle of Friends of the &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;, a group of German industrialists whose aim was to strengthen the ties between the Nazi Party and business and industry. He was also made a member of the Academy for German Law, an organization financed by business contributions. 

During the Nazi regime, Flick&#x27;s businesses profited greatly from the process of Aryanization under which Jews were expropriated by being forced to sell their businesses, sometimes at a fraction of their market worth. Flick formally joined the Nazi Party on 1 May 1937, and in 1938 he was named a Military Economic Leader (&quot;Wehrwirtschaftsführer&quot;).

Flick&#x27;s enterprises were instrumental in Nazi Germany&#x27;s rearmament efforts. After the launching of the Second World War, Flick&#x27;s companies employed an estimated 48,000 forced laborers in his coal mines, steel plants and munitions works. It is estimated that some 80 percent of these workers may have perished.

==War crimes trial==
After the end of the war, Flick was arrested on 13 June 1945 and put on trial for war crimes on 19 April 1947. The Flick trial was one of the twelve Subsequent Nuremberg Trials of the military, political, and economic leadership of Nazi Germany, held after the Nuremberg trials (the &quot;Trial of the Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal&quot;), the most well-known trials which tried 22 of the most important captured Nazis. Like the other trials, the Flick trial took place at the Palace of Justice.

The defendants in this case were Friedrich Flick and five other high-ranking directors of Flick&#x27;s group of companies, &quot;Flick Kommanditgesellschaft&quot;, or &quot;Flick KG&quot;. The charges centered on slave labor and plundering, but Flick and the most senior director, Otto Steinbrinck, were also charged for their membership in the above-noted &quot;Circle of Friends of the Reichsführer-SS,&quot; founded in 1932 by Wilhelm Keppler and taken over by Heinrich Himmler in 1935. Its members donated annually about 1 million &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; to a &quot;Special Account S&quot; in favor of Himmler. Flick steadfastly refused to acknowledge any guilt whatsoever, stating: &quot;nothing will convince us that we are war criminals.&quot; However, Flick was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and on 22 December 1947 was sentenced to seven years imprisonment, with consideration for time served.
==Later career==
Flick was released early on 25 August 1950, due to the institution of good time credits. Despite his conviction, he quickly rebuilt his industrial empire and became one of West Germany&#x27;s richest people by the 1950s, and the largest shareholder of Daimler-Benz and held large amounts of shares in Feldmühle, Dynamit Nobel, Buderus and Krauss-Maffei. 

He was awarded numerous honours, including the Grand Cross with Star and Sash of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1963 and the Bavarian Order of Merit, and was an honorary senator of Technische Universität Berlin. At the time of his death, his industrial conglomerate encompassed 330 companies and around 300,000 employees.

He died in Konstanz on 20 July 1972. His heirs were his son Friedrich Karl Flick and his grandson Friedrich Christian Flick, who established the modern art gallery Friedrich Christian Flick Collection.

<text>The Flick family is a wealthy German family with an industrial empire that formerly embraced holdings in companies involved in coal, steel and a minority holding in Daimler AG.

Friedrich Flick (1883–1972) was the founder of the dynasty, establishing a major industrial conglomerate during the Weimar Republic; he was found guilty at the Flick Trial, which formed part of the Nuremberg Trials. During the Second World War Flick&#x27;s industrial enterprises used 48,000 forced labourers from Germany&#x27;s concentration camps. Friedrich Flick was pardoned 3 years later and received a full refund of the proceeds of crime paid, from the governments.

Friedrich Christian Flick, known as Mick Flick, is an art collector and grandson of Friedrich Flick.

== History ==
Friedrich Flick was the son of a wealthy farmer, who also owned some stock in a mining company in Ernsdorf. His rise began as a member of the board of directors of the Charlottenhütte mining company, and he eventually became a co-owner. He became the company&#x27;s Director-General in 1919. During the Weimar Republic, he built an enormous industrial conglomerate.

=== War crimes ===

While originally a member of the right-wing liberal-nationalist German People&#x27;s Party, Flick also supported the Nazi Party financially from 1933, and over the next ten years donated over seven million marks to the party.

During the Second World War Flick&#x27;s industrial enterprises used 48,000 forced labourers from Germany&#x27;s concentration camps. It is estimated that 80 per cent of these workers died as a result of the way they were treated during the war. Flick was found guilty of war crimes at Nuremberg in 1947 and was sentenced to seven years in prison, but was pardoned 3 years after and resumed control over his industrial conglomerate, becoming the richest person in West Germany.

=== Controversies ===

The 1983 Flick Affair revealed that German politicians had been bribed to allow the Flick family to reduce its tax liabilities, and after becoming an Austrian citizen to further reduce his tax obligations, in 1985 Friedrich Karl Flick sold most of his industrial holdings to &quot;Deutsche Bank&quot; for $2.5 billion (£1.4 billion), retiring until his 2006 death.

On Thursday November 20, 2008, it was reported that his body was stolen from a cemetery in Velden am Wörtersee, Austria.

=== Charitable donations ===

A German high school in Friedrich Flick&#x27;s hometown was called the &quot;Friedrich-Flick-Gymnasium&quot; until September 2008. The contribution from Flick had made it possible to build this school in 1969. The Donatella Flick Conducting Competition is named for Princess Donatella Missikoff Flick, the wife of Gert Rudolph Flick.

<text>Angrignon station () is a Montreal Metro station in Le Sud-Ouest borough of Montreal, Quebec. It is operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) and is the western terminus of the Green Line. The station includes a large bus terminus for buses to southwest Montreal, the West Island (Dorval), and South Western Quebec. It opened in 1978.

== Architecture ==

Angrignon station is built with windows encasing the tracks and side platforms, which creates a very light and airy environment. Jean-Louis Beaulieu received an award from the Ordre des architectes du Québec for the design of the station.

The station is equipped with the MétroVision information screens which displays news, commercials, and the time till the next train.

== Artwork ==
On the platforms, Les Boîtes vivantes by Shelley Miller is a ceramic photography montage of Parc Angrignon&#x27;s Quartiers d’hiver. This was the winter residence of animals of the Jardin des merveilles (Garden of Wonders) - a former urban zoo in Parc La Fontaine. The work was installed in 2022 as part of work to make the station accessible.

In October 2019, work began to make the station universally accessible with the installation of elevators at a cost of $18m. As part of the project, the glass walls of the station were replaced to improve watertightness. A piece of artwork was also installed. The work was completed on December 9 2022, making it the 24th accessible station.

== Origin of the name ==
Jean-Baptiste Arthur Angrignon was alderman of the district of Saint-Paul and a member of the Executive Committee of the city of Montreal. He oversaw the development of what is now Parc Angrignon on what was land that belonged to the Crawford family. The area was named after him in 1927.

<text>Romano Artioli (born 5 December 1932, in Moglia) is an Italian entrepreneur and one-time owner of Bugatti and Lotus automobile brands.

Artioli was born in Moglia in the Province of Mantua. He was raised in Bolzano where in the 1980s he operated one of the largest Ferrari dealerships in the world, selling in northern Italy and southern Germany.
He also imported Japanese cars, owning &quot;Autoexpò&quot; which in 1982 became the first Italian importer of Suzuki.

He was encouraged by Ferruccio Lamborghini and Paolo Stanzani to establish &quot;Bugatti International&quot;, a holding company that bought the Bugatti trademark name in 1987 with Jan K Breitfeld as President of the holding.
Artioli became chairman of Bugatti Automobili S.p.A., which made the Bugatti EB 110 between 1991 and 1995.
In 1993, his wife Renata Kettmeir formed the Bolzano-based &quot;Ettore Bugatti&quot; luxury item maker, also using the Bugatti &quot;EB&quot; logo. Their involvement ended in September 1995 due to bankruptcy, and the company was eventually bought by Volkswagen in April 1998. Prior to the sale to Volkswagen, private equity investor CVC attempted a purchase of Bugatti via UK corporate finance advisor Anglo American Ventures, however the £100m deal failed at due diligence stage.

Artioli purchased Lotus from General Motors in August 1993 and became its chairman until 1996 when he stepped down to be Special Projects director until 1998. 
He sold a majority stake to Proton in 1996 to fund his losses due to the insolvency of Bugatti.

His daughter Elena Artioli (born 1970) is a politician for the South Tyrolean People&#x27;s Party and
Lega Nord Alto Adige – Südtirol.
The Lotus Elise was named after Romano Artioli&#x27;s granddaughter Elisa Artioli.

<doc id="1007951" wikidata="Q236290" url="?curid=1007951" title="Margaret, Countess of Tyrol">
<text>Margaret, nicknamed Maultasch (1318 – 3 October 1369), was the last Countess of Tyrol from the House of Gorizia (&quot;Meinhardiner&quot;), and an unsuccessful claimant to the Duchy of Carinthia. Upon her death, Tyrol became united with the Austrian hereditary lands of the Habsburg dynasty.

== Biography ==
=== Descent ===
Margaret was the only surviving daughter of Duke Henry of Carinthia, also landgrave of Carniola, Count of Tyrol and former King of Bohemia, with his second wife Adelaide, a daughter of the Welf duke Henry I of Brunswick. As her father&#x27;s three marriages had produced no male heirs, he reached an agreement with the Wittelsbach emperor Louis IV in 1330 that enabled Margaret to succeed him in his Carinthian and Tyrolean estates, while Carniola would be handed over to the Habsburgs.

In the ongoing struggle between the rivalling Habsburg, Wittelsbach and Luxembourg dynasties, Emperor Louis had assured his position by defeating his Habsburg rival Frederick the Fair at the 1322 Battle of Mühldorf – a fact that prompted his former Luxembourg ally King John of Bohemia to explore possibilities to increase his own power base. He approached Henry of Carinthia, his former brother-in-law whom he had defeated in the struggle for the Bohemian throne in 1310, and arranged the engagement of his younger son John Henry, brother of the future Emperor Charles IV, to Henry&#x27;s heiress Margaret in 1327.

John Henry was sent to Tyrol and in 1330, upon approval by Emperor Louis, he and Margaret celebrated their wedding in Innsbruck at the age of eight and twelve, respectively. According to contemporary sources, the children disliked each other from the beginning.

=== Reign ===
By the marriage, King John secured access to the Alpine mountain passes to Italy, which in turn drove the Wittelsbach emperor to break the arrangements he had made with Margaret&#x27;s father. When Henry of Carinthia died in 1335, Louis thus gave Carinthia to the Habsburg duke Albert II of Austria, who had raised inheritance claims as the eldest son of King Albert I of Germany and Elisabeth of Gorizia-Tyrol, Margaret&#x27;s paternal aunt. Tyrol, in turn, would be taken by the Wittelsbachs themselves, thus squeezing out Margaret and her Bohemian (Luxembourg) husband entirely. Nevertheless, when the Tyrolean lands were claimed by the Bavarian Wittelsbach dynasty, she cleverly played on her affiliation with the rivalling Luxembourgs. She sent for her husband&#x27;s capable brother Charles who, backed by local nobles, at least enforced Margaret&#x27;s succession as Countess of Tyrol.

However, the situation again worsened when young John Henry turned out to be a haughty, incompetent co-ruler and philanderer disrespected by the Tyrolean aristocracy. His brother Charles temporarily acted as a regent; however, his mediation efforts were rejected and in 1336/37 he left Tyrol to join his father on a Prussian Crusade. When on the evening of 1 November 1341 John Henry came home from hunting, Margaret refused her husband admittance to their Tirol Castle residence. Furious, John Henry moved around the country, but found no shelter in any noble residence. He finally was forced to leave the Tyrolean lands and was received as a refugee by the Aquileia patriarch Bertram of St. Genesius.

Margaret again played the rivalling dynasties off against each other and escaped the revenge of the deprived Luxembourgs by turning to the House of Wittelsbach: in the presence of Emperor Louis IV, she married his eldest son Margrave Louis I of Brandenburg on 10 February 1342 in Meran. The fact that she entered the marriage without being granted a divorce from John Henry caused a veritable scandal on the European stage and earned the couple the excommunication by Pope Clement VI. Margrave Louis succeeded in gaining the support of the Tyrolean nobles and took it upon himself to declare Margaret&#x27;s marriage to John Henry null and void. The scholars William of Ockham and Marsilius of Padua defended this &quot;first civil marriage&quot; of the Middle Ages, claiming that John Henry had never consummated his matrimony.

Margaret&#x27;s former brother-in-law Charles IV, elected German anti-king in opposition to Emperor Louis in 1346, campaigned in Tyrol the next year and laid siege to Tirol Castle; however, he had to pull out without success, though not without burning down the cities of Bozen and Meran out of revenge. After the emperor&#x27;s death in October, Charles was able to consolidate Luxembourg rule and abandoned his hostile attitude. He gave in and dissolved the marriage of his brother with Margaret according to canon law, to obtain papal agreement for John Henry&#x27;s remarriage to Margaret of Opava, daughter of the Přemyslid duke Nicholas II in 1349.

The countess forged a new alliance by the marriage of her son by Louis, Meinhard III, to Margaret of Habsburg, the youngest daughter of the Austrian duke Albert II. With the assistance of the Habsburgs, the countess and her second husband were finally absolved from excommunication by Pope Innocent VI in 1359.

=== Retirement ===
After the sudden death of her husband Louis in 1361, her son Meinhard III succeeded his father as Duke of Upper Bavaria and Count of Tyrol. However, Meinhard died less than two years later without heirs and just under a month away from the age of twenty-one. His death precipitated an invasion by his Wittelsbach uncle Duke Stephen II of Bavaria-Landshut. Stephen, allied with Bernabò Visconti, re-united Landshut with Meinhard&#x27;s Upper Bavarian lands and also claimed Tyrol. Again facing the threat of losing her patrimony, Margaret was finally induced to contract the County of Tyrol over to her late son&#x27;s brother-in-law, the Habsburg duke (and self-proclaimed &quot;Archduke&quot;) Rudolf IV of Austria, who eventually united it with the Austrian dominions. The conflict over Tyrol was settled by the 1369 Peace of Schärding between Rudolf&#x27;s brother and successor Duke Albert III of Austria and Duke Stephen II of Bavaria, the financial compensation for which was exigent upon Margaret&#x27;s death.

Margaret died in exile in Vienna in 1369 and is buried at the Minoritenkirche.

Margaret&#x27;s feudal heir would have been her elder cousin&#x27;s son, Frederick III of Aragon, ruler of the island of Sicily, the only descendant of Otto III of Carinthia, the penultimate ruler from the Gorizia-Tyrol dynasty. After his line, the succession would have gone in 1401 to Joanna of Aragon, Countess of Foix, and in 1407 to Yolande of Aragon, Queen of Naples (both daughters of John I, King of Aragon). Only in 1740 would that descent converge with the actual holders of the Tyrol, when Maria Theresa, wife of the Aragonian heir Francis III, Duke of Lorraine, succeeded in Tyrol as well.

==Nicknames==
In the fierce dispute over her divorce and remarriage, Margaret received the nickname &quot;Maultasch&quot; (literally &quot;bag mouth&quot;, cf. Maultasche, meaning &quot;whore&quot; or &quot;vicious woman&quot;) in contemporary ecclesiastical propaganda. The epithet is first documented in a 1366 sequel of the &quot;Sächsische Weltchronik&quot; (Saxon World Chronicle); she was also called &quot;Medusa&quot; by the Florence chronicler Filippo Villani and is further known by a variety of nicknames, including &quot;Kriemhild&quot;, &quot;Medusa&quot;, &quot;Mouthpoke&quot;, &quot;Pocket-mouth&quot;, &quot;Satchel-mouth&quot;, &quot;the Big Mouth&quot;, &quot;the Mouth Bag&quot;, &quot;the Pocket-Mouthed&quot;, &quot;the She-Wolf of the Tyrol&quot;, &quot;the Ugly Duchess&quot;, and &quot;With the Pouch Mouth&quot;.

Contemporaries such as the chronicler John of Winterthur called her exceptionally beautiful; however, with the lack of contemporary portraits, the nickname &quot;Maultasch&quot; led to the widespread notion of a woman with deformed features. Quentin Matsys&#x27;s 1513 portrait &quot;The Ugly Duchess&quot; (which was thought to have been made after a sanguine by Leonardo da Vinci, but it is more likely that the latter is a copy after Matsys&#x27; ) may refer to Margaret, and it was Sir John Tenniel&#x27;s model for the &quot;Duchess&quot; in his illustrations of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. In 1816 Jacob Grimm collected the &quot;Legends of Margarete&quot; in his book &quot;German sagas&quot; and Lion Feuchtwanger used her story in his 1923 novel &quot;The Ugly Duchess&quot;. The tale of Margaret&#x27;s unsuccessful siege of Carinthian Hochosterwitz Castle and its shrewd garrison was popularized by the psychologist Paul Watzlawick.

<doc id="1007961" wikidata="Q457221" url="?curid=1007961" title="List of The Smurfs characters">
<text>This is a list of &quot;[[The Smurfs]]&quot; characters appearing in the original comics, the 1980s cartoon and the 2011 movie (as well as its sequels), and the 2021 reboot.

The Smurfs were also sold as collectible toys, and many of these characters were ideal from manufacturing and marketing points of view in that they had the same basic body plan but could be differentiated by one or two distinguishing accessories.
== Number of Smurfs ==

According to &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine N° 1954 from 1964, there are 100 Smurfs in total; this does not take into account later additions from the Smurfs comic books and films.

Although the Smurfs were fairly undifferentiated in the beginning, over time, where the story required it, very specific Smurfs emerged. For example, the character Smurfette was introduced in the 1967 album &quot;The Smurfette&quot; and disappeared &quot;definitely&quot; again at the end of that story. Only after she was re-introduced in the 1981 TV series, Smurfette became a regular character and even one of the protagonists.

<doc id="1007969" wikidata="Q6094427" url="?curid=1007969" title="Iterative reconstruction">
<text>Iterative reconstruction refers to iterative algorithms used to reconstruct 2D and 3D images in certain imaging techniques.
For example, in computed tomography an image must be reconstructed from projections of an object. Here, iterative reconstruction techniques are usually a
better, but computationally more expensive alternative to the common filtered back projection (FBP) method, which directly calculates the image in
a single reconstruction step. In recent research works, scientists have shown that extremely fast computations and massive parallelism is possible for iterative reconstruction, which makes iterative reconstruction practical for commercialization.

== Basic concepts ==

The reconstruction of an image from the acquired data is an inverse problem. Often, it is not possible to exactly solve the inverse
problem directly. In this case, a direct algorithm has to approximate the solution, which might cause visible reconstruction artifacts in the image. Iterative algorithms approach the correct solution using multiple iteration steps, which allows to obtain a better reconstruction at the cost of a higher computation time.

There are a large variety of algorithms, but each starts with an assumed image, computes projections from the image, compares the original projection data and updates the image based upon the difference between the calculated and the actual projections.

=== Algebraic reconstruction ===

The Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) was the first iterative reconstruction technique used for computed tomography by Hounsfield.

=== Iterative Sparse Asymptotic Minimum Variance ===

The iterative sparse asymptotic minimum variance algorithm is an iterative, parameter-free superresolution tomographic reconstruction method inspired by compressed sensing, with applications in synthetic-aperture radar, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

=== Statistical reconstruction ===
There are typically five components to statistical iterative image reconstruction algorithms, e.g.
# An object model that expresses the unknown continuous-space function formula_1 that is to be reconstructed in terms of a finite series with unknown coefficients that must be estimated from the data.
# A system model that relates the unknown object to the &quot;ideal&quot; measurements that would be recorded in the absence of measurement noise. Often this is a linear model of the form formula_2, where formula_3 represents the noise.
# A statistical model that describes how the noisy measurements vary around their ideal values. Often Gaussian noise or Poisson statistics are assumed. Because Poisson statistics are closer to reality, it is more widely used.
# A cost function that is to be minimized to estimate the image coefficient vector. Often this cost function includes some form of regularization. Sometimes the regularization is based on Markov random fields.
# An algorithm, usually iterative, for minimizing the cost function, including some initial estimate of the image and some stopping criterion for terminating the iterations.

=== Learned Iterative Reconstruction ===
In learned iterative reconstruction, the updating algorithm is learned from training data using techniques from machine learning such as convolutional neural networks, while still incorporating the image formation model. This typically gives faster and higher quality reconstructions and has been applied to CT and MRI reconstruction.

== Advantages ==
The advantages of the iterative approach include improved insensitivity to noise and capability of reconstructing an optimal image in the case of incomplete data. The method has been applied in emission tomography modalities like SPECT and PET, where there is significant attenuation along ray paths and noise statistics are relatively poor.

Statistical, likelihood-based approaches: Statistical, likelihood-based iterative expectation-maximization algorithms
are now the preferred method of reconstruction. Such algorithms compute estimates of the likely distribution of annihilation events that led to the measured data, based on statistical principle, often providing better noise profiles and resistance to the streak artifacts common with FBP. Since the density of radioactive tracer is a function in a function space, therefore of extremely high-dimensions, methods which regularize the maximum-likelihood solution turning it towards penalized or maximum a-posteriori methods can have significant advantages for low counts. Examples such as Ulf Grenander&#x27;s Sieve estimator
or Bayes penalty methods, or via I.J. Good&#x27;s roughness method may yield superior performance to expectation-maximization-based methods which involve a Poisson likelihood function only.

As another example, it is considered superior when one does not have a large set of projections available, when the projections are not distributed uniformly in angle, or when the projections are sparse or missing at certain orientations. These scenarios may occur in intraoperative CT, in cardiac CT, or when metal artifacts
require the exclusion of some portions of the projection data.

In Magnetic Resonance Imaging it can be used to reconstruct images from data acquired with multiple receive coils and with sampling patterns different from the conventional Cartesian grid and allows the use of improved regularization techniques (e.g. total variation) or an extended modeling of physical processes to improve the reconstruction. For example, with iterative algorithms it is possible to 
reconstruct images from data acquired in a very short time as required for real-time MRI (rt-MRI).

In Cryo Electron Tomography, where the limited number of projections are acquired due to the hardware limitations and to avoid the biological specimen damage, it can be used along with compressive sensing techniques or regularization functions (e.g. Huber function) to improve the reconstruction for better interpretation.

Here is an example that illustrates the benefits of iterative image reconstruction for cardiac MRI.

<text> (Devanagari: , IAST: ) is a Sanskrit and Pali word that connotes the virtue of generosity, charity or giving of alms, in Indian religions and philosophies.

In Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism, is the practice of cultivating generosity. It can take the form of giving to an individual in distress or need, or of philanthropic public projects that empower and help many.

 is an ancient practice in Indian traditions, tracing back to Vedic traditions.

==Hinduism==

 (Sanskrit: ) means giving, often in the context of donation and charity. In other contexts, such as rituals, it can simply refer to the act of giving something. is related to and mentioned in ancient texts along with concepts of () which means benevolent deed, helping others; () which means fee one can afford; and (), which means alms.

 is defined in traditional texts as any action of relinquishing the ownership of what one considered or identified as one&#x27;s own, and investing the same in a recipient without expecting anything in return.

While is typically given to one person or family, Hinduism also discusses charity or giving aimed at public benefit, sometimes called . This aims at larger projects such as building a rest house, school, drinking water or irrigation well, planting trees, or building a care facility, among others.

===Dāna in Hindu texts===
The &quot;Rigveda&quot; has the earliest discussion of in the Vedas. The &quot;Rigveda&quot; relates it to &quot;truth&quot; and in another hymn points to the guilt one feels from not giving to those in need. It uses , the root of word , in its hymns to refer to the act of giving to those in distress. Ralph T. H. Griffith, for example, translates Book 10, Hymn 117 of the Rig veda as follows:
The Upanishads, composed before , present some of the earliest Upanishadic discussion of . Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, in verse 5.2.3, states that three characteristics of a good, developed person are self-restraint (), compassion or love for all sentient life (), and charity ().

Chandogya Upanishad, Book III, similarly, states that a virtuous life requires: (asceticism), (charity), (straightforwardness), (non-injury to all sentinent beings) and (truthfulness).

&quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; describes the right and wrong forms of in verses 17.20 through 17.22. It defines (good, enlightened, pure) charity, in verse 17.20, as that given without expectation of return, at the proper time and place, and to a worthy person. It defines (passion, ego driven, active) charity, in verse 17.21, as that given with the expectation of some return, or with a desire for fruits and results, or grudgingly. It defines (ignorant, dark, destructive) charity, in verse 17.22, as that given with contempt, to unworthy person(s), at a wrong place and time. In Book 17, Bhadwad Gita suggests steadiness in , or the good form of charity is better; and that should be avoided. These three psychological categories are referred to as the s in Hindu philosophy.

The &quot;Adi Parva&quot; of the Hindu Epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, in Chapter 91, states that a person must first acquire wealth by honest means, then embark on charity; be hospitable to those who come to him; never inflict pain on any living being; and share a portion with others whatever he consumes. In Chapter 87 of &quot;Adi Parva&quot;, it calls sweet speech and refusal to use harsh words or wrong others even if you have been wronged, as a form of charity. In the &quot;Vana Parva&quot;, Chapter 194, the Mahabharata recommends that one must, &quot;conquer the mean by charity, the untruthful by truth, the wicked by forgiveness, and dishonesty by honesty&quot;. &quot;Anushasana Parva&quot; in Chapter 58, recommends public projects as a form of dāna. It discusses the building of drinking water tanks for people and cattle as a noble form of giving, as well as giving of lamps for lighting dark public spaces. In later sections of Chapter 58, it describes planting public orchards, with trees that give fruits to strangers and shade to travelers, as meritorious acts of benevolent charity. In Chapter 59 of Book 13 of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Yudhishthira and Bhishma discuss the best and lasting gifts between people:

The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; discusses when is proper and when it is improper. In Book 8, Chapter 19, verse 36 it states that charity is inappropriate if it endangers and cripples modest livelihood of one&#x27;s biological dependents or of one’s own. Charity from surplus income above that required for modest living is recommended in the Puranas.

Hindu texts exist in many Indian languages. For example, the &quot;Tirukkuṛaḷ&quot;, written between and , is one of the most cherished classics on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. It discusses charity, dedicating Chapter 23 of Book 1 on Virtues to it. &quot;Tirukkuṛaḷ&quot; suggests charity is necessary for a virtuous life and happiness. In it, Thiruvalluvar states in Chapter 23: &quot;Giving to the poor is true charity, all other giving expects some return&quot;; &quot;Great, indeed, is the power to endure hunger. Greater still is the power to relieve other&#x27;s hunger&quot;; &quot;Giving alms is a great reward in itself to one who gives&quot;. In Chapter 101, he states: &quot;Believing wealth is everything, yet giving away nothing, is a miserable state of mind&quot;; &quot;Vast wealth can be a curse to one who neither enjoys it nor gives to the worthy&quot;. Like the Mahabharata, Tirukkuṛaḷ also extends the concept of charity to deeds (body), words (speech) and thoughts (mind). It states that a brightly beaming smile, the kindly light of loving eye, and saying pleasant words with sincere heart is a form of charity that every human being should strive to give.

=== in rituals===
 is also used to refer to rituals. For example, in a Hindu wedding, () refers to the ritual where a father gives his daughter&#x27;s hand in marriage to the groom, after asking the groom to promise that he will never fail in his pursuit of dharma (moral and lawful life), artha (wealth) and kama (love). The groom promises to the bride&#x27;s father, and repeats his promise three times in presence of all gathered as witness.

Other types of charity includes donating means of economic activity and food source. For example, (donation of a cow), () (donation of land), and or (, ): Sharing knowledge and teaching skills, (): Charity of care for the sick and diseased, (): giving freedom from fear (asylum, protection to someone facing imminent injury), and (): Giving food to the poor, needy and all visitors.

===The effect of ===
Charity is held as a noble deed in Hinduism, to be done without expectation of any return from those who receive the charity. Some texts reason, referring to the nature of social life, that charity is a form of good karma that affects one&#x27;s future circumstances and environment, and that good charitable deeds lead to good future life because of the reciprocity principle.
Other Hindu texts, such as &quot;Vyasa Samhita&quot;, state that reciprocity may be innate in human nature and social functions but is a virtue in itself, as doing good lifts the nature of one who gives. The texts do not recommend charity to unworthy recipients or where charity may harm or encourage injury to or by the recipient. , thus, is a dharmic act, requires an idealistic-normative approach, and has spiritual and philosophical context. The donor&#x27;s intent and responsibility for diligence about the effect of on the recipient is as important as the itself. While the donor should not expect anything in return with , the donor is expected to make an effort to determine the character of the recipient, and the likely return to the recipient and to the society. Some medieval era authors state that is best done with (faith), which is defined as being in good will, cheerful, welcoming the recipient of the charity and giving without (finding faults in the recipient). These scholars of Hinduism, states Kohler, suggest that charity is most effective when it is done with delight, a sense of &quot;unquestioning hospitality&quot;, where the ignores the short term weaknesses as well as the circumstances of the recipient and takes a long term view.

===In historical record===
Xuanzang, the Chinese pilgrim to India, describes many (houses of goodness, merit, charity) in his memoir. He mentions these Punyasalas and Dharmasalas in Takka (Punjab) and other north Indian places such as near the Deva temples of Haridwar at the mouth of river Ganges and eight Deva temples in Mulasthanapura. These, recorded Xuanzang, served the poor and the unfortunate, providing them food, clothing and medicine, also welcoming travelers and the destitute. So common were these, he wrote, that &quot;travelers [like him] were never badly off.&quot;

Al-Biruni, the Persian historian, who visited and lived in India for 16 years from about , mentions the practice of charity and almsgiving among Hindus as he observed during his stay. He wrote, &quot;It is obligatory with them (Hindus) every day to give alms as much as possible.&quot;

&quot;Satram&quot;s, called &quot;Choultry&quot;, &quot;Dharamsala&quot;, or &quot;Chathram&quot;s in parts of India, have been one expression of Hindu charity. Satrams are shelters (rest houses) for travelers and the poor, with many serving water and free food. These were usually established along the roads connecting major Hindu temple sites in South Asia as well as near major temples.

Hindu temples served as charitable institutions. Burton Stein states that South Indian temples collected donations (&quot;melvarum&quot;) from devotees, during the Chola dynasty and Vijayanagara Empire periods in . These were then used to feed people in distress as well as fund public projects such as irrigation and land reclamation.

===Hindu treatises on dāna===
&quot;Mitākṣarā&quot; by Vijñāneśvara is an 11th-century canonical discussion and commentary on dāna, composed under the patronage of Chalukya dynasty. The discussion about charity is included in its thesis on &quot;ācāra&quot; (moral conduct).

Major Sanskrit treatises that discuss ethics, methods and rationale for charity and alms giving in Hinduism include, states Maria Heim, the 12th-century &quot;Dāna Kānda&quot; &quot;Book of Giving&quot; by Laksmidhara of Kannauj, the 12th-century &quot;Dāna Sāgara&quot; &quot;Sea of Giving&quot; by Ballālasena of Bengal, and the 14th-century sub-book &quot;Dānakhanda&quot; in &quot;Caturvargacintamani&quot; &quot;The Gem of the Four Aims of Human Life&quot; by Hemadiri of Devagiri (modern Daulatabad, Maharashtra). The first two are few hundred page treatises each, while the third is over a thousand-page compendium on charity, from a region that is now part of modern-day eastern Maharashtra and Telangana; the text influenced Hindus of Deccan region and South India from 14th to 19th centuries.

==Buddhism==

 as a formal religious act is directed by the Buddhist laity specifically to a monastic or spiritually-developed person. In Buddhist thought, it has the effect of purifying and transforming the mind of the giver.

Generosity developed through giving leads to experience of material wealth and possibly being reborn in happy states. In the Pāli Canon&#x27;s &quot;Dighajanu Sutta&quot;, generosity (denoted there by the Pāli word , which can be synonymous with ) is identified as one of the four traits conditioning happiness and wealth in the next life. Conversely, lack of giving leads to unhappy states and poverty.

 leads to one of the or &quot;perfections&quot;, the . This can be characterized by unattached and unconditional generosity, giving and letting go.

Buddhists believe that giving without seeking anything in return leads to greater spiritual wealth. Moreover, it reduces the acquisitive impulses that ultimately lead to continued suffering from egotism.

, or generosity, can be given in both material or immaterial ways. Spiritual giving—or the gift of noble teachings, known as , is said by the Buddha to surpass all other gifts. This type of generosity includes those who elucidate the Buddha’s teachings, such as monks who preach sermons or recite from the Tripiṭaka, teachers of meditation, unqualified persons who encourage others to keep precepts, or helping support teachers of meditation. The most common form of giving is in material gifts such as food, money, robes, and medicine.

==Jainism==
 is described as a virtue and duty in Jainism, just as it is in Buddhist texts and Hindu texts like &quot;Mitaksara&quot; and &quot;Vahni Purana&quot;. It is considered an act of compassion, and must be done with no desire for material gain. Four types of &quot;dāna&quot; are discussed in the texts of Jainism: (donation of food), (donation of medicine), (donation of knowledge) and (giving of protection or freedom from fear, asylum to someone under threat). is one of ten means to gain positive karma in the soteriological theories of Jainism. Medieval era texts of Jainism dedicate a substantial portion of their discussions to the need and virtue of . For example,&quot;Yashastilaka&quot;&#x27;s book VIII section 43 is dedicated to the concept of in Jainism.

The practice of &quot;dāna&quot; is most commonly seen when lay people give alms to the monastic community. In Jainism, monks and nuns are not supposed to be involved in the process of making food and they also cannot purchase food since they cannot possess money. Therefore, &quot;dāna&quot; is important for the sustenance of the Jain monastic community. The lay donor also benefits from the act of &quot;dāna&quot; because &quot;&quot;dāna&quot; is accepted as being a means of gaining merit and improving the quality of [their] destiny.&quot;

==Sikhism==

, called , is considered one of three duties of Sikhs. The duty entails sharing part of one&#x27;s earnings with others, by giving to charity and caring for others. Examples of in Sikhism include selfless service and .

<text>The Thakali ( ) are an ethnolinguistic Tibeto-Burman ethnic group of Nepal.They are often regarded as the &quot;richest caste&quot; of Nepal. The traditional area of the Thakali community is called &quot;Thak-sat-se&quot; or the Thak Khola region and lies in the Kali Gandaki River valley in the Mustang District, Gandaki Province in western Nepal. According to the 2001 census, the Thakali population of around 12,973 constituted only 0.06% of Nepal&#x27;s population. By the 2011 Nepal census, there were 13,215 Thakali people in Nepal.

The &quot;Lhafewa&quot; (Barha Barse Kumbha Mela), &quot;Toranlha&quot; (ancestral worship) and &quot;Falo&quot; (Kumar Yatra) are the major festivals of Thakalis. &quot;Dhnom&quot; is the title of the Thakali priest who performs the work of the local shaman. The madal, &quot;khaprang&quot; and &quot;thamken&quot; are their main musical instruments.

There are four groups who consider themselves Thakali; all four castes are different according to the Census of Nepal. They are &quot;Teen Gauley&quot; (the Thakali from Thini, Syang and Chimang villages), &quot;Marphali&quot; (Thakali from Marpha village, further subclassified as &quot;Hirachan&quot;, &quot;Pannachan&quot;, &quot;Jwarchan&quot;, and &quot;Lalchan&quot;), &quot;Chaar Jaat&quot; or &quot;four castes&quot; (&quot;Sherchan&quot;, &quot;Tulachan&quot;, &quot;Bhattachan&quot;, &quot;Gauchan&quot;) and &quot;Thakali&quot; (those Thakali from Southern Mustang, Tukuche, and Jomsom). These groups consider themselves to be part of different castes but all still Thakali. The customs, culture, dress and festivals of each differ slightly.

==Geographic distribution==
The Central Bureau of Statistics of Nepal classifies the Thakali people as a subgroup within the broader social group of mountain/hill nationalities (&quot;janajāti&quot;). At the time of the 2011 Nepal census, 13,215 people (0.0% of the population of Nepal) were Thakali. The distribution of Thakali people by province was as follows:
* Gandaki Province (0.3%)
* Bagmati Province (0.1%)
* Karnali Province (0.0%)
* Koshi Province (0.0%)
* Lumbini Province (0.0%)
* Madhesh Province (0.0%)
* Sudurpashchim Province (0.0%)

The population of Thakali people was higher than national average (0.0%) in the following districts:
* Mustang (20.9%)
* Manang (0.9%)
* Myagdi (0.9%)
* Kaski (0.5%)
* Baglung (0.2%)
* Eastern Rukum (0.2%)
* Kathmandu (0.2%)
* Jumla (0.1%)
* Lalitpur (0.1%)
* Parbat (0.1%)
* Pyuthan (0.1%)
* Rupandehi (0.1%)

<doc id="1007978" wikidata="Q783373" url="?curid=1007978" title="Australian pound">
<text>The pound (sign: £, £A for distinction) was the currency of Australia from 1910 until 14 February 1966, when it was replaced by the Australian dollar. Like other £sd currencies, it was subdivided into 20 shillings (denoted by the symbol s or /–), each of 12 pence (denoted by the symbol d).

==History==
The establishment of a separate Australian currency was contemplated by section 51(xii) of the Constitution of Australia, which gave the Federal Parliament power to legislate with respect to &quot;currency, coinage, and legal tender&quot;.

===Establishment===

====Coinage====
The Deakin government&#x27;s &quot;Coinage Act 1909&quot; distinguished between &quot;British coin&quot; and &quot;Australian coin&quot;, giving both status as legal tender of equal value. The Act gave the Treasurer the power to issue silver, bronze and nickel coins, with the dimensions, size, denominations, weight and fineness to be determined by proclamation of the Governor-General. The first coins were issued in 1910, produced by the Royal Mint in London.

====Paper currency====

The Fisher Government&#x27;s &quot;Australian Notes Act 1910&quot; gave the Governor-General the power to authorise the Treasurer to issue &quot;Australian notes&quot; as legal tender, &quot;payable in gold coin on demand at the Commonwealth Treasury&quot;. It also prohibited the circulation of state notes and withdrew their status as legal tender. In the same year the &quot;Bank Notes Tax Act 1910&quot; was passed imposing a prohibitive tax of 10% per annum on &quot;all bank notes issued or re-issued by any bank in the Commonwealth after the commencement of this Act, and not redeemed&quot;, which effectively ended the use of private currency in Australia.

As a transitional measure lasting three years, blank note forms of 16 banks were supplied to the government in 1911 to be overprinted as redeemable in gold and issued as the first Commonwealth notes. Some of these banknotes were overprinted by the Treasury, and circulated as Australian banknotes until new designs were ready for Australia&#x27;s first federal government-issued banknotes, which commenced in 1913.

In May 2015, the National Library of Australia announced that it had discovered the first £A 1 banknote printed by the Commonwealth of Australia, among a collection of specimen banknotes. This uncirculated Australian pound note, with the serial number (red-ink) P000001, was the first piece of currency to carry the coat of arms of Australia.

===Gold standard===

The Australian currency was fixed in value to sterling. As such Australia was on the gold standard so long as Britain was.

In 1914, the British government removed sterling from the gold standard. When it was returned to the gold standard in 1925, the sudden increase in its value (imposed by the nominal gold price) unleashed crushing deflationary pressures. Both the initial 1914 inflation and the subsequent 1926 deflation had far-reaching economic effects throughout the British Empire, Australia and the world. In 1929, as an emergency measure during the Great Depression, Australia left the gold standard, resulting in a devaluation relative to sterling. A variety of pegs to sterling applied until December 1931, when the government devalued the local unit by 20%, making one Australian pound equal to 16 shillings sterling and one pound sterling equal to 25 Australian shillings.

Coins of the Australian pound also circulated freely in New Zealand, although they were never legal tender. By 1931, Australian coins made up approximately 30% of the total circulation in New Zealand. The devaluation of Australian and New Zealand exchange rates relative to the pound sterling led to New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;Coinage Act 1933&quot; and the issuing of the first coinage of the New Zealand pound.

===World War II===
During World War II, the Empire of Japan produced currency notes denominated in the Australian pound for use in Pacific island countries intended for occupation. Since mainland Australia was never occupied or intended to be occupied, the occupation currency was not used there, but it was used in the captured parts of the then-Australian territories of Papua and New Guinea.

===Post-war devaluation===
In 1949, when the United Kingdom devalued sterling against the US dollar, Australian Prime Minister and Treasurer Ben Chifley followed suit so the Australian pound would not become over-valued in sterling zone countries with which Australia did most of its external trade at the time. As one pound sterling went from US$4.03 to US$2.80, the Australian pound went from US$3.224 to US$2.24.

===Decimalisation===
Decimalisation had been proposed for Australian currency since 1902, when a select committee of the House of Representatives, chaired by George Edwards, had recommended that Australia adopt a decimal currency with the florin (two shillings) as its base.

In February 1959 the Commonwealth Government appointed a Decimal Currency Committee to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of a decimal currency, and, if a decimal currency was favoured, the unit of account and denominations of subsidiary currency most appropriate for Australia, the method of introduction and the cost involved.

The committee presented its report in August 1960. It recommended the introduction of the new system on the second Monday in February 1963. In July 1961 the Commonwealth Government confirmed its support of a decimal currency system, but considered it undesirable to make final decisions on the detailed arrangement that would be necessary to effect the change. On 7 April 1963 the Commonwealth Government announced that a system of decimal currency was to be introduced into Australia at the earliest practicable date, and gave February 1966, as the tentative change-over date. On 14 February 1966, a decimal currency, the dollar of one hundred cents, was introduced.

Under the implementation conversion rate, £A1 was set as the equivalent of $2. Thus, ten shillings became $1 and one shilling became 10¢. As a shilling was equal to twelve pence, a new cent was worth slightly more than a penny.

==Coins==
In 1855, gold full and half sovereigns (worth, respectively, £1  and 10/– sterling) were first minted by the Sydney Mint. These coins were the only non-Imperial denominations issued by any of the Australian mints until after Federation (the Sydney Mint struck Imperial gold sovereigns and half sovereigns starting in 1871, and the Melbourne Mint starting in 1872).

In 1910, .925 fineness sterling silver coins were minted in denominations of 3d, 6d, 1/– and 2/– (known as a Trey, Zac, Deena, and Florin respectively). Unusually no half crown (worth 2/6) was ever issued. Bronze ½d and 1d coins followed in 1911. Production of half sovereigns ceased in 1916, followed by that of sovereigns in 1931. In 1937 a crown (5/– piece, known as a Dollar) was issued to commemorate the coronation of King George VI. This coin proved unpopular in circulation and was discontinued shortly after being reissued in 1938.

In 1946, the fineness of Australian silver sixpences, shillings, and florins was reduced to .500, a quarter of a century after the same change had been made in Britain. In New Zealand and the United Kingdom, silver was soon abandoned completely in everyday coinage, but Australian .500 silver coins continued to be minted until after decimalisation.

==Banknotes==

Examples of private issue paper currency in New South Wales, denominated in sterling, exist from 1814 (and may date back to the 1790s). Denominated in sterling (and in some cases Spanish dollars), these private banker and merchant scrip notes were used in Sydney and Hobart through 1829. Private issue banknotes were issued between 1817 and 1910 in denominations ranging from £1 to £100. In 1910, superscribed banknotes were used as the Commonwealth&#x27;s first national paper currency until the Treasury began issuing Commonwealth banknotes in 1913. The Commonwealth Bank Act of 1920 gave note-issuing authority to the Commonwealth Bank.

<text>Notker the Stammerer ( – 6 April 912), Notker Balbulus, or simply Notker, was a Benedictine monk at the Abbey of Saint Gall active as a composer, poet and scholar. Described as &quot;a significant figure in the Western Church&quot;, Notker made substantial contributions to both the music and literature of his time. He is usually credited with two major works of the Carolingian period: the &quot;Liber Hymnorum&quot;, which includes an important collection of early musical sequences, and an early biography of Charlemagne, the &quot;Gesta Karoli Magni&quot;. His other works include a biography of Saint Gall known as the &quot;Vita Sancti Galli&quot; and a martyrology, among others.

Born near the Abbey of Saint Gall, Notker was educated alongside the monks Tuotilo and Ratpert; all three were composers, making the Abbey an important center of early medieval music. Notker quickly became a central figure of the Abbey and among the leading literary scholars of the Early Middle Ages. A renowned teacher, he taught Solomon III, the bishop of Constance and on occasion advised Charles the Fat. Although venerated by the Abbey of Saint Gall and the namesake of later scholars there such as Notker Physicus and Notker Labeo, Notker was never formally canonized. He was given &quot;the Stammerer&quot; as an epithet, due to his lifelong stutter.
==Life and career==
Notker was born around 840, near the Abbey of Saint Gall in modern-day Switzerland. His wealthy family was of either Alemannic or Swiss descent and they owned land in Jonschwil of Thurgau. Notker&#x27;s later biographer Ekkehard V claims he was born in Heiligau—now Elgg—in the Canton of Zürich, but this has been rejected by the historian , who suggests a birthplace near Jonschwil. Since childhood Notker had a stutter, because of tooth loss in his youth, resulting in the Latin epithet () or &quot;the Stammerer&quot; in English. The German musicologist likened him to the partially blind Walafrid Strabo and Hermann of Reichenau, who had a limp, as three monks with physical impairments who achieved creative feats.

He began schooling at Saint Gall early in age and spent the rest of his life in the Abbey. His teachers included the Swiss monk and the Irish monk Moengal, called &quot;Marcellus&quot; by Notker. He may have also been instructed by Grimald of Weissenburg, a student of Alcuin. The later book &quot;Casus monasterii Sancti Galli&quot; of Ekkehard IV &quot;paints a lively picture of the monastery school&quot;, and notes that Notker was taught alongside Tuotilo and Ratpert; all three would become teachers and composers at the Abbey.

Although first and foremost a scholar, Notker held numerous positions at the Abbey including librarian in 890 and master of guests () in 892 and 894. He became established as a well-known teacher and was eventually appointed &quot;master of the monastic school&quot;. Among his students was Solomon, who was later Bishop of Constance from 890 until his death in 912. Notker was often called upon for council from outside the Abbey; on occasion he advised Charles the Fat who visited the Abbey from 4–6 December 883. Charles was the dedicatee of Notker&#x27;s &quot;De Carolo Magno&quot;, an early biography of Charlemagne. Ekkehard IV lauded Notker as &quot;delicate of body but not of mind, stuttering of tongue but not of intellect, pushing boldly forward in things Divine, a vessel of the Holy Spirit without equal in his time&quot;.

Despite his renown in the Abbey, Notker never became an abbot of Saint Gall, and repeatedly declined abbacy offers elsewhere. Notker died in Saint Gall on 6 April 912.

==Musical works==
===&quot;Liber Hymnorum&quot;===
Notker created the &quot;Liber Hymnorum&quot; (&quot;Book of Hymns&quot;) during the late 9th century, an important early collection of &quot;Sequences&quot; dedicated to Liutward, the bishop of Vercelli. Completed in 884, it is essentially a set of melodies and texts organized by the Church calendar. The oldest surviving sources of the &quot;Liber Hymnorum&quot; date from either Notker&#x27;s last years or directly after his death.

In the preface to his &quot;Liber Hymnorum&quot;, Notker claimed his musical work was inspired by an antiphoner that was brought to Gall from the Jumièges Abbey, soon after its destruction in 851. Notker was particularly inspired by the Jumièges chant book setting verses to the melodies, making them easier to remember; he goes on to discuss his childhood difficulties in recalling the &quot;melodiae longissimae&quot;.

===Others===
Numerous other musical works have been ascribed to Notker, with varying certainty. The sequence melody &quot;Ave beati germinis&quot; is attributed to him in one mid-10th century source.

Ekkehard IV&#x27;s attribution of the melodies &quot;Frigdola&quot; and &quot;Occidentan&quot; is problematic since these appear to have existed before Notker&#x27;s time. The hymn &quot;Media Vita&quot; was erroneously attributed to him by in 1613.
==Literary works==
&quot;For modern translations, see &quot;

===&quot;Gesta Karoli Magni&quot;===
The &quot;Gesta Karoli Magni&quot; (&quot;The Deeds of Charles the Great&quot;)—also known as &quot;De Carolo Magno&quot; (&quot;Concerning Charles the Great&quot;)—is among the earliest biographies of Charlemagne, after the &quot;Vita Karoli Magni&quot; of Einhard. Notker the Stammerer is usually identified as the pseudonymous &quot;Monk of Saint Gall&quot; () to whom the work is attributed. Numerous life details are shared between Notker and the unknown Monk, including their origin, education and long-term stay at Saint Gall. The translator Lewis Thorpe concludes that the two are &quot;probably the same person, although this cannot be proved&quot;.

The work is not a linear biography, but instead two books of &quot;exempla&quot;—anecdotal &quot;moral tales&quot;—relating chiefly to Charlemagne and his family. When discussed by scholars, Notker&#x27;s work is often compared unfavorably to that of Einhard; the historian Philipp Jaffé derided Notker as one who &quot;took pleasure in amusing anecdotes and witty tales, but who was ill-informed about the true march of historical events&quot;, and described the work itself as a &quot;mass of legend, saga, invention and reckless blundering&quot;. Similarly, the classical scholar H. W. Garrod dismissed it as a &quot;a largely mythical record&quot;. More sympathetically, the historian Matthew Innes has cited Notker&#x27;s use of &quot;humour and anecdotal style&quot; as encouraging &quot;a negative judgement [of] his abilities&quot;, noting that &quot;Recent scholarship [on the &quot;Gesta Karoli Magni&quot; ] has stressed the underlying clarity of its intellectual vision and found coherent ideas about the correct ordering of society, church and politics.&quot;

===Martyrology===
Among Notker&#x27;s literary works was the arrangement of a martyrology, which is a catalogue of martyrs or other Christian saints with short biographies. Written around 900, only a single incomplete copy survives, not including some saints born on June 13–17, July 3–6, August 19–26, October 27 and December 31. That the work survives incomplete may suggest Notker simply never finished his &quot;ambitious project&quot;.

In his martyrology, Notker appeared to corroborate one of St Columba&#x27;s miracles. St Columba, being an important father of Irish monasticism, was also important to St Gall, which had strong Irish connections. The abbot Adomnán wrote that at one point Columba had—through clairvoyance—seen a city in Italy near Rome being destroyed by fiery sulphur as a divine punishment and that three thousand people had perished. And shortly after Columba saw this, sailors from Gaul arrived to tell the news of it. Notker claimed in his martyrology that this event happened and that an earthquake had destroyed a city which was called &#x27;new&#x27;. It is unclear what this city was that Notker was claiming, although some thought it may have been Naples, previously called Neapolis (). However Naples was destroyed by a volcano in 512 before Columba was born, and not during Columba&#x27;s lifetime and the historian Richard Sharpe notes that &quot;Notker was no better placed than anyone since to know what Adomnán intended&quot;.

===Others===
Notker completed the &quot;Breviarium Regum Francorum&quot; (&quot;Breviary of the Frankish Kings&quot;) begun by Erchanbert. A Latin key explaining significative letters (performance instructions in some Gregorian chant) is attributed to Notker, though it is sometimes erroneously ascribed to Notker Labeo.

==Legacy==
Scholars vary on evaluating Notker&#x27;s main legacy; the priest Alban Butler asserted that his sequences were his most important achievement, while the historian Rosamond McKitterick states that he is best remembered for the &quot;Gesta Karoli Magni&quot;. Notker and Solomon II were the most important writers educated at Saint Gall, and Notker was among the both leading literary scribes and scholars of his time. He was the namesake of the later scholars Notker Physicus and Notker Labeo, who are referred to as &quot;Notker II&quot; and &quot;Notker III&quot; respectively.

On Notker&#x27;s canonization status, the English cleric John Donne noted that &quot;he is a private Saint, for a few Parishes&quot;. According to the 16th-century historian Henricus Canisius, Notker&#x27; Sainthood was granted by Leo X in 1512 for Saint Gall and nearby churches, and in 1513 for the Diocese of Constance. The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; interprets Leo&#x27;s action as beatification. In Saint Gall and other churches he is commemorated annually on 6 April. Notker was never formally canonized.

In the mid-19th century the Swiss music scholar was the first to transcribe almost all of Notker&#x27;s extant melodies into modern notation. Many of his transcriptions are still in use, though older manuscript sources are available now that Schubiger did not have access to, meaning that &quot;a more comprehensive approach to the sources will produce readings that are closer to Notker&#x27;s own use, and better musically&quot;. In 2017, a modern edition for 20 of Notker&#x27;s sequences was published by via .

<doc id="1008001" wikidata="Q1406612" url="?curid=1008001" title="Fernando C. Beaman">
<text>Fernando Cortez Beaman (June 28, 1814 – September 27, 1882) was a teacher, lawyer and politician from Michigan during and after the American Civil War. He served as a member of the United States House of Representatives and as mayor of Adrian, Michigan.

==Early life==
Beaman was born in Chester, Vermont, the son of Joshua Beaman and Hannah (Olcott) Beaman. He moved with his parents to a farm in Franklin County, New York, in 1819, and attended the district schools and Franklin Academy in Malone, New York. He taught school and moved to Rochester, New York, in 1836, where he studied law.

==Career==
He moved to Manchester, Michigan, in 1838, where he was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in 1839. In 1841, he moved to Tecumseh to practice law, then moved to Clinton. In 1843, he moved to Adrian, having been appointed prosecuting attorney for Lenawee County. He served in that position until 1850. In Adrian, he formed a law practice with Thomas M. Cooley, future Chief Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court.

He was the city attorney of Adrian and a member of the convention that organized the Republican Party &quot;under the oaks&quot; at Jackson in 1854. He was a delegate to the first Republican National Convention at Philadelphia in 1856, and was also mayor of Adrian in 1856 and judge of the probate court of Lenawee County from 1856 to 1860.

Beaman was elected as a Republican candidate from Michigan&#x27;s 2nd congressional district to the United States House of Representatives for the Thirty-seventh and to the four succeeding Congresses, serving from March 4, 1861, to March 3, 1871. Due to redistricting after the 1860 census, Beaman represented Michigan&#x27;s 1st congressional district following the elections of 1862. During the Thirty-ninth Congress, he was chairman of the House Committee on Roads and Canals. He declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1870 and returned to Adrian where he resumed the practice of law.

Beaman was again appointed a judge of probate court of Lenawee County in 1871, and was then elected to the same position in 1872, and re-elected in 1876.

Due to ill health, Beaman declined appointment as United States Senator to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Zachariah Chandler in 1879. He also declined appointments to the Michigan Supreme Court and as United States Commissioner of Indian Affairs.

He died in Adrian on September 27, 1882, and is interred in Oakwood Cemetery there.

==Personal life==
Beaman married Mary Goodrich on May 10, 1841, in Brockport, New York. They had three children: Mary A. Beaman, Edward C. Beaman, and Roscoe W. Beaman.

<doc id="1008004" wikidata="Q547997" url="?curid=1008004" title="Nui (atoll)">
<text>Nui is an atoll and one of nine districts of the Pacific Ocean state of Tuvalu. It has a land area of 3.37 km2 and a population of 610 (2017 Census).

Traditionally Nuian culture is organised in three family circles – Tekaubaonga, Tekaunimala and Tekaunibiti families. Most people live on the western end of Fenua Tapu. In the 2012 census, 321 people live in Alamoni – Maiaki and 221 people live in Manutalake – Meang (Tanrake). The junior school is Vaipuna Primary School.

==Geography==
Nui consists of at least 21 islets. These are:

* Fenua Tapu
* Motupuakaka
* Pakantou
* Piliaieve
* Pongalei
* Talalolae
* Telikiai, also known as &quot;Meang&quot;
* Tokinivae
* Unimai
* and at least 12 other islands

The biggest, most southern and most eastern island is Fenua Tapu (area 1.38 km2), which is followed by Telikiai (which is the most western islet), Tokinivae, Pongalei, Talalolae, Pakantou, Unimai, Piliaieve and Motupuakaka.

==Languages==
The people of Nui speak the Gilbertese language, the language of Kiribati, and Tuvaluan, the official language of Tuvalu. The ancestors of Nui came from both Samoa and the Gilbert Islands in what is now Kiribati.

==Early history==
The island was first sighted by Europeans on 16 January 1568 by Spanish navigator Álvaro de Mendaña, who named it &quot;Isla de Jesús&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Island of Jesus&quot;) because it was discovered on the day following the feast of the Holy Name. There are no less than six accounts of this event, that of Mendaña himself being as follows:

&quot;A little after nine o&#x27;clock in the morning, a lad called Trejo, being aloft, first sighted land upon the starboard side to the southwest...When we drew near, we found it so small that it was no more than six leagues in circumference. This island was very full of trees like palms; towards the north it had a reef, which entered the sea a quarter of a league, and towards the south was another smaller reef. On the west side it had a strand lying lengthways, with reefs in different parts. This is on the west side, for we could not go round the east side because of the weather. Taking this island from the sea outwards, it has the shape of two galleys, with a copse in the middle which appears like a fleet of ships&quot;

Mendaña found the island inhabited and five canoes came nearly within bow shot of his ship, when their occupants raised their paddles and turned back with shouts. Mendaña thereupon ordered signals to be made to them with a white cloth to try to get them to return, instead of which they landed and in turn stuck up signals along the shore. At night one of the ships showed a light, it was copied by a fire, and when it was put out the fire extinguished also. Hernán Gallego, Mendaña&#x27;s pilot, says the natives were &quot;naked and mulattoes&quot; and Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, cosmographer in the expedition reported that the island &quot;had a large fishery&quot;. As it was late Mendaña decided to defer landing until the morning and kept the ships tacking all night. With the dawn, however, a strong westerly storm blew up, and although they tried all day to regain the island they were at length compelled to give up.

A Dutch expedition (the frigate &quot;Maria Reijgersbergen&quot;) found Nui on the morning of 14 June 1825 and named the main island (Fenua Tapu) as &quot;Nederlandsch Eiland&quot; (Dutch Island). The atoll has been called Egg or Netherland Island.
The population of Nui from 1860 to 1900 is estimated to be between 250 and 300 people.

Kirisome, was Nui&#x27;s first and long serving pastor (1865–99).

Robert Waters was an early trader on Nui in the 1850s-1860s. Martin Kleis was the resident trader on Nui in the late 19th century who sold copra to Henderson and Macfarlane.

The photographer Thomas Andrew visited Nui in about 1885–86.

Nui Post Office opened around 1919 and a climate station was established in 1941.

The traditional outrigger canoes (&quot;paopao&quot;) from Nui were constructed with an indirect type of outrigger attachment and the hull is double-ended, with no distinct bow and stern. These canoes were designed to be sailed over the Nui lagoon. The booms of the outrigger are longer than those found in other designs of canoes from the other islands. This made the Nui canoe more stable when used with a sail than the other designs.

Celebrations are held on Nui on 16 February – &quot;Bogin te Ieka&quot; (Day of the Flood) – to commemorate the Tsunami that struck the island on that day in 1882.

==Cyclone &quot;Pam&quot;, March 2015==
Nui was affected by storm surges caused by Cyclone &quot;Pam&quot; in early March 2015, which caused damage to houses, crops and infrastructure. On 22 March 71 families (40 per cent of the population) of Nui remained displaced and were living in 3 evacuation centres or with other families. The Situation Report published on 30 March reported that Nui suffered the most damage of the three central islands (Nui, Nukufetau and Vaitupu); with Nui suffering the loss of 90% of the crops. Health assessment teams visited Nui and the other islands affected by Cyclone Pam.

==General election, 2024==
Mackenzie Kiritome was re-elected and Sir Iakoba Taeia Italeli was elected to represent Nui in the parliament in the 2024 general election. Dr. Puakena Boreham was not re-elected.



==Notable local people==
Sir Iakoba Italeli (GCMC) was the Governor-General of Tuvalu from 16 April 2010 until 22 August 2019. He represented Nui in the Parliament from 2006 until he was appointed the Governor-General. He was the Minister of Education, Sports and Health in the Ielemia Ministry. He was again elected an MP in the 2024 general election and was appointed the Speaker of the Parliament.

Alesana Kleis Seluka (MBE, CBE) is medical doctor by profession and Chairman of the Public Service Commission of Tuvalu. He has represented Nui in the parliament. He served as the Minister of Finance and Economic Planning from 1996 until 1999, and Minister of Health from 2001 to 2006.

Pelenike Isaia became the second woman ever to have sat in the Parliament of Tuvalu, she became an MP in the 2011 by-election following the death of her husband Isaia Taeia Italeli. She represented Nui until the 2015 Tuvaluan general election.

Mamao Keneseli is a community development leader on Nui, where she became involved with running a women&#x27;s handicraft centre in 1990, teaching women how to develop their skills and earn a living. From 2010 to 2017 she was the director of the Matapulapula Women&#x27;s Group.

<text>Local Nature Reserve (LNR) is a statutory designation for certain nature reserves in Great Britain. The Wild Life Conservation Special Committee established them and proposed a national suite of protected areas comprising national nature reserves, conservation areas (which incorporated suggestions for Sites of Special Scientific Interest), national parks, geological monuments, local nature reserves and local educational nature reserves.

There are now over 1,280 LNRs in England, covering almost 40,000 hectares, which range from windswept coastal headlands and ancient woodlands to former inner city railways and long abandoned landfill sites.

==History==

=== National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act ===
The National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 combined elements of several of these categories in its definition of a nature reserve (Section 15). The hope of the Special Committee was to see sites protected which represented sites of local scientific interest, which could be used by schools for field teaching and experiment, and in which people with no special interest in natural history could &quot;...&quot;derive great pleasure from the peaceful contemplation of nature&quot;.&quot;

A Local Nature Reserve (capitalised) is a statutory designation made under Section 21 – &quot;Establishment of nature reserves by local authorities&quot; – of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 by principal local authorities (district, borough or unitary councils) in England, Scotland and Wales. Parish and town councils in England have no direct power to designate nature reserves, but they can have the powers to do so delegated to them by their principal local authority using section 101 of the Local Government Act 1972.

The first LNR in Scotland was established in 1952 at Aberlady in East Lothian.

==Establishment of nature reserves==
To establish a LNR, the declaring local authority must first have a legal interest in the land concerned, for example, they could own it, lease it or have a nature reserve agreement with the owner. The land must lie within the area which the declaring authority controls.

LNRs are of local, but not necessarily national, importance. LNRs are almost always owned by local authorities, who often pass the management of the LNR onto County Wildlife Trusts. LNRs also often have good public access and facilities. An LNR can also be an SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest), but often is not, or may have other designations (although an LNR cannot also be a national nature reserve). Except where the site is an SSSI, there is no legal necessity to manage an LNR to any set standard, but management agreements often exist.

An LNR may be given protection against damaging operations. It also has certain protection against development on and around it. This protection is usually given via the local plan (produced by the planning authority), and often supplemented by local by-laws. However, there is no national legal protection specifically for LNRs.

=== Information ===
Information on LNRs is available from the Countryside Council for Wales (&quot;A Place for Nature at your Doorstep: the role of Local Nature Reserves&quot;, 2004), Natural England (&quot;Local Nature Reserves: places for people and wildlife&quot;, 2000) and Scottish Natural Heritage (&quot;Local Nature Reserves in Scotland: a guide to their selection and declaration&quot;, 2000).

During the course of her career, Hackett was also nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award, a BAFTA Award, and a Golden Laurel Award, as well as the recipient of an Obie Award, a Drama Desk Award, and a Theatre World Award honoring her stage work. 

==Early life==
Hackett was born in the East Harlem neighborhood of New York City, the daughter of John and Mary (née Esposito) Hackett, and grew up in Elmhurst, Queens, where she became a model and dropped out during her final year of high school. She had a sister, Theresa, and a brother, John. Hackett&#x27;s mother was from Naples, Italy, and her father had Irish ancestry, and they raised her Catholic and sent her to Catholic schools.

==Acting career==
Hackett debuted in 1959 with the role of Gail Prentiss in the television series, &quot;Young Doctor Malone&quot;. In 1961, she won a Theatre World Award, an Obie Award for Best Actress, and a Drama Desk Award for her Off-Broadway portrayal of Chris in Michael Shurtleff&#x27;s play &quot;Call Me By My Rightful Name&quot;.

She had a recurring role in the CBS legal drama &quot;The Defenders&quot; (1961–1965) as the fiancée of Kenneth Preston (played by Robert Reed). She appeared regularly in scenes with both lead actors. She had a leading role in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;A Piano in the House&quot;. In the 1963–1964 season, she guest-starred on &quot;Channing&quot;, an ABC drama about college life starring Jason Evers and Henry Jones.

Hackett had one of the starring roles in the 1966 Sidney Lumet film &quot;The Group&quot;, along with Candice Bergen, Larry Hagman, Richard Mulligan, Joanna Pettet, and others. She was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress for this role. 

She also played the role of Catherine Allen in the 1968 Western &quot;Will Penny&quot;, with Charlton Heston in the title role.

After this, she primarily had parts in TV movies and on episodes of TV series.

In 1976, she played the female lead in the Disney adventure film &quot;Treasure of Matecumbe&quot;. In 1978, she appeared in a PBS adaptation of &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot; as Christine Mannon. Her performance in that production earned her some of the best reviews of her career. The same year, she was a regular in the cast of the short-lived CBS situation comedy &quot;Another Day&quot;, portraying Ginny Gardner.

She appeared in the September 22, 1979, episode &quot;Grass Is Always Greener&quot; of &quot;The Love Boat&quot; as Julie McCoy&#x27;s former classmate from the line&#x27;s cruise director course.

Hackett won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the 1981 film &quot;Only When I Laugh&quot;, the last film she made before her death.

<text>Petworth House is a late 17th-century Grade I listed country house in the parish of Petworth, West Sussex, England. It was built in 1688 by Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset, and altered in the 1870s to the design of the architect Anthony Salvin. It contains intricate wood-carvings by Grinling Gibbons (d. 1721). It is the manor house of the manor of Petworth. For centuries it was the southern home for the Percy family, earls of Northumberland.

Petworth is famous for its extensive art collection made by the Northumberland and Seymour/Somerset families and George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont (1751–1837), containing many works by his friend J. M. W. Turner. It also has an expansive deer park, landscaped by Capability Brown, which contains a large herd of fallow deer.

==History==

===Medieval Manor House===
The manor of Petworth first came into the possession of the Percy family as a royal gift from Adeliza of Louvain, the widow of King Henry I (1100–1135), to her brother Joscelin of Louvain. He later married the Percy heiress and adopted the surname Percy. His descendants became the earls of Northumberland, the most powerful family in northern England. The Percy family, whose primary seat was at Alnwick Castle in Northumberland, bordering Scotland, intended Petworth to be for their occasional residence only.

The site was previously occupied by a fortified manor house built by Henry de Percy, 1st Baron Percy (1273–1314), in 1308–09, the chapel and undercroft of which still survive as part of the current house.

However, in the 16th century, the Percy family came into conflict with the crown as the staunchly Catholic family fell foul of the English Reformation which resulted in Petworth being briefly taken from them by King Henry VIII, restored to them by Queen Mary I before the wider family came under scrutiny during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland, allied the family to Mary, Queen of Scots, and led the 1569 Rising of the North against Elizabeth with the aim of deposing her and placing Mary on the throne – this failed and led to his execution for treason in 1572. His younger brother, Henry Percy, 8th Earl of Northumberland, would regain his title from the Queen after begging her mercy and was granted his freedom on the condition that the family be confined to Petworth where they could be observed by the court. The house at Petworth was therefore transformed and expanded to become the permanent home of the family with grand stables erected and a pleasure garden laid out at this time. A part of this era manor house, a &#x27;Lost&#x27; North wing, was discovered during archaeological excavations in 2012–15 under the lawn at the front of the house having been demolished in 1692.

===Baroque House===
In 1670 Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland (1644–1670), died without a male heir, and thus his considerable fortune and estates of Petworth House, Alnwick Castle, Syon House and Northumberland House were inherited by his 2-year-old daughter and sole heiress, Lady Elizabeth Percy (1667–1722). In 1682, at the age of 16 and already twice widowed, she married the 20-year-old Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset (1662–1748), whose family seat was Marlborough Castle in Wiltshire. They became one of the wealthiest couples in England.

It was the 6th Duke, nicknamed &#x27;the Proud Duke&#x27;, and the Duchess who rebuilt the house between 1688 and 1702 in the Baroque style that favoured order and symmetry. It was very much inspired by the Palace of Versailles and aimed to establish Petworth as a rival to these European palaces.

The grounds and wider parkland were also managed at this time with the parkland being home to quarries and proving an industrial and working landscape supporting the building works and the house. Around the house were planted more formal gardens including an avenue of lime trees approaching the house, a canal gardens and fishponds, parterre, great greenhouse and Orangerie. Completing the formal gardens was a Quarter Piece Lawn and Rampart terraces comprising a series of walks carved into the hill and accompanied by carved seats, stairs and statues.

===Split inheritance challenges and Capability Brown===
Since 1750 the house and estate have been owned by the prominent Wyndham family, descended from Sir Charles Wyndham, 4th Baronet (1710–1763), of Orchard Wyndham in Somerset, a nephew and co-heir of Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset (1684–1750). As part of the inheritance and splitting-up of the great Percy inheritance, which had been a source of contention between the 7th Duke and his father the 6th Duke, in 1749 after the death of the 6th Duke, King George II granted the 7th Duke four extra titles in the peerage, including Baron Cockermouth and Earl of Egremont, with the latter two created with special remainder to Sir Charles Wyndham, the intended and actual recipient of Petworth, Cockermouth Castle and Egremont Castle. Following the 7th Duke&#x27;s death in 1750, his lands and titles were split between his daughter, Lady Elizabeth Seymour and her husband Sir Hugh Smithson, 4th Baronet (d.1786), and Charles Wyndham through the 7th Duke&#x27;s deceased brother-in-law Sir William Wyndham. The former inherited the northern Percy estates, including Alnwick Castle and Syon House, together with the titles Baron Warkworth of Warkworth Castle and Earl of Northumberland and whose descendants are the current Dukes of Northumberland based at Alnwick Castle. The latter inherited Petworth and some estates in Sussex, Cumbria and Yorkshire as earls of Egremont.

The 2nd Earl was responsible for the collections of Rococo mirrors and antique statues that exist in the house today and was responsible for commissioning Lancelot &#x27;Capability&#x27; Brown to landscape the parkland during the 1750s and 1760s. The works involved the demolition of the formal gardens that preceded it, the landscaping of the wider parkland to raise the profile of the lawn in front of the house, infill quarries, smooth over the terraced walks and digging out buildings in the parkland down to foundation level. Archaeological investigations seemed to suggest that the turf was removed prior to the levelling works so they could be replaced after the works were completed and aiding the current natural look to the landscape.

===House of Art===
It was George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont (1751–1837), who solidified the house&#x27;s reputation as one of fine art. He inherited the house in 1763 and began what has been termed a &#x27;Golden Age&#x27; of Petworth when he expanded his collection of contemporary art and expanded and changed the house in order to display it best, in particular through the addition of the North Gallery in 1824–5. He was patron to many contemporary artists including J. M. W. Turner and John Constable who were frequent guests to the house and painted the house and its parkland frequently - this has more recently helped inform restorations to the house and parkland.

The 3rd Earl bequeathed Petworth and Cockermouth Castle to his illegitimate son and adopted heir Col. George Wyndham (1787–1869), but who could not inherit the title of Earl of Egremont so was instead created Baron Leconfield by Queen Victoria in 1859.

The title of Earl of Egremont instead passed to his nephew George Wyndham, 4th Earl of Egremont (1786–1845), who, while not inheriting Petworth, instead received the (not inconsiderable) entailed Wyndham estates including Orchard Wyndham, still owned today by the Wyndham family. He attempted to make up for the loss of Petworth by building his own stately home in Devon called Silverton Park, which was demolished in 1902.

===Open to public: National Trust===
The house and deer park were handed over to the nation in 1947 by Edward Wyndham, 5th Baron Leconfield (1883–1967), and are now managed by the National Trust under the name Petworth House &amp; Park. The Leconfield Estates would continue to own much of Petworth and the surrounding area and the family would be able to continue living in part of Petworth House. It was John Wyndham, 6th Baron Leconfield and since 1963 also 1st Baron Egremont, who negotiated the gift of the contents of the house, in particular the paintings and sculptures, into the property of the National Trust in lieu of accumulated death duties. The current Lord and Lady Egremont continue a tradition of unbroken occupancy at Petworth House today with Max Egremont and his family living in the south wing, allowing much of the remainder of the House to be open to the public. Lady Egremont has restored the gardens. In its 2018/2019 Annual Report, the Trust reported that Petworth House received 178,760 visitors. In its 2022 Annual Report, the Trust reported that Petworth House received 147,079 visitors in 2021–22, having had a dip in numbers to 88,600 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020–21.

Today&#x27;s building houses an important collection of paintings and sculptures, including 19 oil paintings by J. M. W. Turner (some owned by the family, some by Tate Britain), who was a regular visitor to Petworth, paintings by Anthony van Dyck and Joshua Reynolds, carvings by Grinling Gibbons and Ben Harms, classical and neoclassical sculptures (including ones by John Flaxman and John Edward Carew), and wall and ceiling paintings by Louis Laguerre. There is also a terrestrial globe by Emery Molyneux, believed to be the only one in the world in its original 1592 state.

==Petworth Park==

The 283-hectare (700-acre) landscaped park, known as Petworth Park, contains a large herd of fallow. It is one of the more famous in England, largely on account of a number of pictures of it which were painted by Turner. There is also a woodland garden, known as the Pleasure Ground and some unusual ha-has.
The landscaped park and pleasure grounds of Petworth are Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

Petworth House is home to the Petworth House Real Tennis Club (many such private estates held real tennis courts). Petworth Park is also a cricket venue, for the refounded Petworth Park Cricket Club.

==Surrounding area==
As was usual for a mediaeval manor house, it was built in its original form next to the parish church (to provide the lord of the manor with enhanced spiritual benefits), around which developed a village, now grown to a sizeable town. Such position is unusual for a country mansion of its size and date, which were frequently later re-built on new more private sites away from the original manor house, or the church and village were on occasion demolished to provide the desired privacy. Petworth House and Park are thus today situated immediately adjacent to the town of Petworth, with its shops and restaurants.

As an insight into the lives of past estate workers the Petworth Cottage Museum has been established in High Street, Petworth, furnished as it would have been in about 1910.

==Visitor facilities==

Since being opened to the public, the house has attracted a significant number of visitors each year to see the art collections, explore the parkland and pleasure grounds. As such, the National Trust opened and run a number of facilities for visitors at the site.

The trust run two car parks for visitors, a main car park ideally placed for the house and pleasure gardens and a more northern car park for the wider deer park. With the exception of a visitor reception near to the main car park and a food and beverage kiosk in the old fire station, the visitor amenities are all located within the old service block for the house. This service wing contains the site shop, a second-hand bookshop, a cafe in the old Audit Room (which opened originally as a sculpture gallery before being used as a hall for large gatherings of the estate staff and servants), toilets and a seasonal art gallery. The service wing also contains a few of the historic kitchen rooms preserved for the public to view.

In addition to publishing a general visitor guidebook, the trust also publishes an in-depth guide to the different art pieces within the house and detailing in more detail the family history associated with the collection. They also have a virtual guide for visitors in addition to the volunteer room stewards present around the house. They also announced in 2021 the opening of a second shop within the house selling books related to the art works in the house and art supplies.

==Filming location==

Petworth House has been used extensively as a location for film and TV productions. Included in the credits are &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; (1975), &quot;Silver Bears&quot; (1977), &quot;&quot; (2007), &quot;Maleficent&quot; (2014), &quot;Mr Turner&quot; (2014), &quot;Rebecca&quot; (2020), and &quot;Bridgerton&quot; (2022). &quot;Napoleon&quot;, starring Joaquin Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby filmed at Petworth in March 2022.

<doc id="1008011" wikidata="Q2189223" url="?curid=1008011" title="Sutton, Dublin">
<text>Sutton () is a residential suburb on the Northside of Dublin, Ireland. It occupies the tombolo which links Howth Head to the mainland, some of the lower slopes of Howth Hill, and a little of the adjacent coasts. The area lies within the jurisdiction of Fingal County Council. There is a small commercial core at the Sutton Cross road intersection.

Sutton lies in the ancient Barony of Coolock, within the traditional County Dublin.

==History==
The first recorded mention of Sutton in reference to the area is from around 1228–48, noted in the Calendar of Archbishop Alen&#x27;s Register; it is likely linked to a person of Norman origin.

==Location and geography==
===Location===
Historically Sutton lay entirely on the Howth peninsula, from Sutton Cross up to Claremont Road and where Barren Hill meets Carrickbrack Road and the Martello Tower at Red Rock. Today, however, it is generally considered to extend to the railway, where it meets Baldoyle, and to the junction of Baldoyle Road and the coast road, where it meets Bayside, these additional lands historically having been farmland. The only neighbouring district on Howth Head is Howth itself.

===Access===
Beginning on the Howth Road (R105) about 12 kilometres from the city centre, Sutton neighbours Howth, which occupies most of the Howth peninsula, and Baldoyle and Bayside. It is served by the main road from Dublin to Howth (R105). Dublin Bus serves the area with routes H3 and 6, within the BusConnects scheme. There is a cycleway that connects Sutton to Clontarf and Fairview, with works ongoing to connect to Sandymount.

Sutton railway station opened on 30 July 1846 as &quot;Baldoyle &amp; Sutton&quot;, being renamed &quot;Sutton&quot; in 1901. The station lies on the Howth branch of the commuter rail network and is served by the Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) system.

The Hill of Howth Tramway ran between Sutton railway station and Howth railway station around the Hill of Howth until 1959.
===Geography===
At the core of Sutton is a tombolo connecting Howth (which used to be an island) to the mainland. The original village of Sutton was situated on the city-facing (south-western) side of Howth Head, along Strand Road, where there are today housing terraces and a small harbour, but the area is now centred on Sutton Cross.
====Streams====
There are several small streams in the area, all substantially culverted. Some tiny flows cross the Sutton end of the Cliff Walk paths, and two bigger streams, Santa Sabina Stream and the Carrickbrack Stream, discharge at the coast on Sutton Strand. Carrickbrack Stream rises between Shielmartin Hill and Dun Hill near Howth Golf Course, and flows, meeting minor tributaries, roughly parallel to Carrickbrack Road, coming to the shore at the south-western end of the strand, while Santa Sabina Stream comes from the central area of the Howth (Deer Park) Estate, and runs in culvert past the Offington housing estate and through the grounds of Santa Sabina Dominican Convent, reaching the sand around 150m north of the mouth of the Carrickbrack, with concrete framing and a guard rail. The Santa Sabina outfall, in front of Saint Fintan&#x27;s Roman Catholic church, sometimes flows very actively but is notably sometimes covered by sand, which is then cleared by Fingal County Council staff.

====Beaches====

Sutton is surrounded by many beaches. The Burrow Beach is particularly popular among locals and tourists. It is approximately 1.2 km and stretches from Sutton Golf Club to Howth, along one side of the tombolo connecting Howth Head to the mainland. Sutton Strand runs along the coast road and in front of St. Fintan&#x27;s church.

====Quarries====
Two quarries previously operated in Sutton on the Howth Road near Corr Castle and at Barren Hill on St.Fintans Road. Both are now closed.

==Amenities==
There is one main commercial area, with a Supervalu store (previously a Superquinn) supermarket, under that chain&#x27;s HQ, which in turn had replaced the local cinema), the Marine Hotel, a post office, and other banking, dining and retail operations. The local filling stations closed some years back, leaving the unattended Maxol filling station in coastal Kilbarrack and its attended station on Baldoyle Road as the only fuelling facilities nearby. 

==Sports and leisure activities==
There is dinghy sailing off the coast at Sutton Dinghy Club, based within Sutton Creek. Golf can be played at Sutton Golf Club, with Howth and the Deerpark golf facilities nearby; footgolf and poc fada can also be played at Deerpark. Suttonians Rugby Football Club, at Station Road, provides for local rugby players and supporters. Sutton Tennis Club has 12 outdoor courts and five indoor squash courts; it is the biggest club for junior squash in Ireland. The local soccer club is Howth Celtic, with grounds located opposite St.Fintan&#x27;s primary school on Carrickbrack Road. There is a local scout group which meets in St. Mary&#x27;s Church of Ireland Parish Hall in Howth.

Red Rock is a trailhead for the Cliff Walk which navigates a large section of Howth Head and ends at Howth village. Shielmartin Hill is also readily accessible from Sutton.

==Buildings==

One of the area&#x27;s oldest buildings, the fifteenth century Corr Castle, is located at Sutton North near the Howth Road entrance to Offington housing estate. The castle previously formed part of the Howth Park Racecourse which stretched over large parts of Sutton and Howth.

The area is also home to one of Ireland&#x27;s Martello Towers at Red Rock which is now a private residence. Also located in Red Rock is Sutton Castle, the former home of the Jameson family, and later became the residence of Belgian businessman Albert Luykx, made famous during the Irish arms trial. It subsequently became Sutton House Hotel and then Sutton Castle Hotel, before being converted in 2003 to private residences.
Several notable Georgian houses are located in Sutton including two imposing 4-storey Georgian era houses now called Beachfield House (previously called Devonshire Terrace) as well as the nearby Sealawn House (1830s) which was owned by John Pentland Mahaffy. Adjacent to these is a terrace of Howth stone-faced fisherman&#x27;s cottages called &quot;Martello Terrace&quot;. The end house of this terrace used to house the old Sutton coast guard station but has now been converted into residential accommodation.

The old tram shed which was used by the Hill of Howth Tramway is located near Sutton Station, but is now a private residence which is part of a modern housing development.

The Luí na Gréine (English:&quot;Sunset&quot;) granite standing stone monument is located on the seaside pathway at Sutton strand and was designed by Cliodhna Cussen and erected in the mid-2000s.

==Education==
Sutton has three mixed primary schools: the Burrow School, on the Dublin Road between Sutton Cross and Howth, St. Fintan&#x27;s National School, on Carrickbrack Road, and the primary part of Sutton Park School. It holds three secondary schools: St. Fintan&#x27;s High School (a boys school, technically in Baldoyle), Santa Sabina Dominican College (a.k.a. Santa Sabina) (girls) and the senior part of Sutton Park School (mixed).

==Religion==
Sutton comprises a parish in the Roman Catholic church, St. Fintans, within the deanery of Howth, with a parish church at the base of Howth Hill, adjacent to Santa Sabina School, at the junction of Greenfield Road and Church Road. 
There is also a Methodist church at the junction of Church Road and Howth Road.
Sutton contains one of Dublin&#x27;s main burial grounds, St. Fintan&#x27;s, which is divided into two parts, &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new.&quot; The former contains a ruined chapel dating from early Norman times, and the latter, an abandoned keeper&#x27;s cottage.

Uphill from the older graveyard, in a wooden hut on private grounds, is the still-flowing holy well of St. Fintan.

==Administration==
Sutton is part of the Dublin Bay North Dáil Éireann constituency, having previously been part of Dublin North-East for many years.

The area is also within the Howth-Malahide local electoral area in the jurisdiction of Fingal County Council, and there is also an electoral division of &quot;Sutton&quot;.

The lead single from her fourth album, &quot;Dream×Dream&quot; was released in April 2004. The song served as the theme song to the Japanese animated movie &quot;Detective Conan: Magician of the Silver Sky&quot; and peaked at number sixth on the &quot;Oricon&quot; chart. Her fourth album &quot;Playgirl&quot; was released in December 2004. The R&amp;B-influenced J-pop album peaked at number seven and managed to sell 100,000 copies in Japan. The album has yielded three singles: &quot;Dream×Dream&quot;, &quot;Start&quot;, and &quot;Boom-Boom-Boom&quot;.

=== 2005–2008: &quot;Delight&quot; and &quot;Trip&quot; ===
In May 2005, &quot;Akaku Atsui Kodō&quot; was released as the lead single from Aiuchi&#x27;s fifth studio album. The song served as the theme song to the Japanese Tokusatsu series &quot;Ultraman Nexus&quot; and reached number seven on the &quot;Oricon&quot; chart. The double-A side single &quot;Glorious&quot;/&quot;Precious Place&quot; was released in March 2006 as the third single from the album. Both songs served the theme song to the PlayStation role-playing video game &quot;Another Century&#x27;s Episode 2&quot;. The single was a success, peaking at number five and sold over 26,000 copies in Japan. Her fifth album &quot;Delight&quot; was released in May 2006. The dance music-tasted J-pop album was received well by her fans and reached number four in Japan. In support of the album, Aiuchi embarked on the concert tour &quot;Rina Aiuchi Live Tour 2006 &quot;Delight&quot;&quot; from 8 June 2006. In June 2006, Aiuchi released a collaboration single with U-ka Saegusa, &quot;100 mono Tobira&quot;, under the name of Rina Aiuchi and U-ka Saegusa. The song was written for the Japanese television animated series &quot;Case Closed&quot; and sold approximately 30,000 copies in Japan. In addition to her work for &quot;Delight&quot;, Aiuchi appeared on the track &quot;Ai Epilogue&quot; on Tsunku&#x27;s album &quot;Type 2&quot;.

In April 2007, the second single as Rina Aiuchi and U-ka Saegusa, &quot;Nanatsu no Umi wo Wataru Kaze no yō ni&quot; was released to a commercial success, selling over 36,500 copies in Japan. The song was written for the Japanese animated movie &quot;Detective Conan: Jolly Roger in the Deep Azure&quot;. Aiuchi&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Trip&quot; was released in May 2008. The album yielded one top-ten single: &quot;Nemurenu Yo ni&quot;/&quot;Party Time Party Up&quot; and managed to enter top-ten in Japan.

=== 2009: &quot;Thanx&quot; and &quot;All Singles Best: Thanx 10th Anniversary&quot; ===
In March 2009, Aiuchi&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Thanx&quot; was released. The album failed to enter top-ten in Japan and managed to sell around 22,000 copies nationwide. The album has yielded one top-ten single: &quot;Friend&quot;/&quot;Sugao no mama&quot;.

In July 2009, Aiuchi released the double-A side single &quot;Story&quot;/&quot;Summer Light&quot;. The single peaked at number nine on the &quot;Oricon&quot; chart and sold approximately 6,700 copies in Japan. The follow-up single, &quot;Magic&quot; was released in October 2009. Although the song failed to enter the top-ten in Japan, the sales surpassed last single, with the total sales of 8,600 copies. Aiuchi&#x27;s second compilation album &quot;All Singles Best: Thanx 10th Anniversary&quot; was released in December 2009. The album succeeded commercially, reaching number seven on the &quot;Oricon&quot; chart and selling over 38,000 copies in Japan.

=== 2010–2011: &quot;Last Scene&quot; and retirement ===
In March 2010, Aiuchi released her first B-side tracks compilation album &quot;Colors&quot;. The album failed commercially and sold only 4,500 copies in Japan. On 30 July 2010, Aiuchi announced that she would retire from the music industry at the end of the year, because of the thyroid deficiency. Her eighth and last studio album &quot;Last Scene&quot; was released in September 2010. The album debuted at number eight on the &quot;Oricon&quot; chart and sold approximately 20,600 copies in Japan. The album has yielded four singles: &quot;Good Days&quot;, &quot;Sing a Song&quot;, &quot;C Love R&quot;, and &quot;Hanabi&quot;. On 31 December 2010, Aiuchi&#x27;s first box set &quot;Rina Aiuchi Premier Box 2000–2010&quot; was released exclusively on her fan club and the web store of her label, Giza Studio. In September 2011, her second remix album &quot;Forever Songs: Brand New Remixes&quot; was released.

=== 2012–present: Post-retirement and comeback ===
In September 2012, Aiuchi announced that she had founded a dog clothing company, &quot;Bon Bon Copine&quot;. Soon, she achieved success as a businesswoman, leading the company to success with 50 million yen of the yearly turnover.

In September 2015, Aiuchi appeared on the Japanese television music show, &quot;The Karaoke Battle&quot; and covered &quot;Hello, Again (Mukashi Kara Aru Basho)&quot; by My Little Lover and &quot;Love Story&quot; by Namie Amuro. The appearance marked her comeback to the music industry and since then, she has performed at several shows. In April 2018, Aiuchi released her first song since 2010, &quot;Warm Prayer&quot; under the name of R. The song managed to enter a top on the &quot;RecoChoku&quot; high-resolution songs chart. Aiuchi released her first studio album in ten years, &quot;Ring&quot;, in March 2020.

In March 2021, Aiuchi accused her former producer of the sexual harassments and filed a lawsuit against her former talent agent, Giza Artist, seeking 10 million yen, alleging that they did not protect her from the harassments. In the same month, Aiuchi announced that she would resume the musical activities under her former stage name, Rina Aiuchi.

On October 13, 2022, Osaka District Court dismissed Aiuchi&#x27;s lawsuit, ruled that the harassment is not recognized; her appeal at Osaka High Court rejected on April 21, 2023, ruled that her sexual harassment claim is not credible.

<doc id="1008028" wikidata="Q300883" url="?curid=1008028" title="Sudo">
<text>sudo () is a program for Unix-like computer operating systems that enables users to run programs with the security privileges of another user, by default the superuser. It originally stood for &quot;superuser do&quot;, as that was all it did, and this remains its most common usage; however, the official Sudo project page lists it as &quot;su &#x27;do. The current Linux manual pages for su define it as &quot;substitute user&quot;, making the correct meaning of sudo &quot;substitute user, do&quot;, because sudo can run a command as other users as well.

Unlike the similar command &quot;su&quot;, users must, by default, supply their own password for authentication, rather than the password of the target user. After authentication, and if the configuration file (typically codice_1) permits the user access, the system invokes the requested command. The configuration file offers detailed access permissions, including enabling commands only from the invoking terminal; requiring a password per user or group; requiring re-entry of a password every time or never requiring a password at all for a particular command line. It can also be configured to permit passing arguments or multiple commands.

==History==
Robert Coggeshall and Cliff Spencer wrote the original subsystem around 1980 at the Department of Computer Science at SUNY/Buffalo. Robert Coggeshall brought sudo with him to the University of Colorado Boulder. Between 1986 and 1993, the code and features were substantially modified by the IT staff of the University of Colorado Boulder Computer Science Department and the College of Engineering and Applied Science, including Todd C. Miller. The current version has been publicly maintained by OpenBSD developer Todd C. Miller since 1994, and has been distributed under an ISC-style license since 1999.

In November 2009 Thomas Claburn, in response to concerns that Microsoft had patented sudo, characterized such suspicions as overblown. The claims were narrowly framed to a particular GUI, rather than to the sudo concept.

The logo is a reference to an xkcd strip, where an order for a sandwich is accepted when preceded with &#x27;sudo&#x27;.

==Design==

Unlike the command &quot;su&quot;, users supply their personal password to sudo (if necessary) rather than that of the superuser or other account. This allows authorized users to exercise altered privileges without compromising the secrecy of the other account&#x27;s password. Users must be in a certain group to use the sudo command, typically either the wheel group or the sudo group. After authentication, and if the configuration file permits the user access, the system invokes the requested command. &quot;sudo&quot; retains the user&#x27;s invocation rights through a grace period (typically 5 minutes) per pseudo terminal, allowing the user to execute several successive commands as the requested user without having to provide a password again.

As a security and auditing feature, sudo may be configured to log each command run. When a user attempts to invoke sudo without being listed in the configuration file, an exception indication is presented to the user indicating that the attempt has been recorded. If configured, the root user will be alerted via mail. By default, an entry is recorded in the system.

==Configuration==
The codice_2 file contains a list of users or user groups with permission to execute a subset of commands while having the privileges of the root user or another specified user. The file can be edited by using the command codice_3. Sudo contains several configuration options such as allowing commands to be run as sudo without a password, changing which users can use sudo, and changing the message displayed upon entering an incorrect password. Sudo features an easter egg that can be enabled from the configuration file that will display an insult every time an incorrect password is entered.

==Impact==
In some system distributions, sudo has largely supplanted the default use of a distinct superuser login for administrative tasks, most notably in some Linux distributions as well as Apple&#x27;s macOS. This allows for more secure logging of admin commands and prevents some exploits.

==RBAC==
In association with SELinux, sudo can be used to transition between roles in role-based access control (RBAC).

==Tools and similar programs==
&quot;visudo&quot; is a command-line utility that allows editing the sudo configuration file in a fail-safe manner. It prevents multiple simultaneous edits with locks and performs sanity and syntax checks.

Sudoedit is a program that symlinks to the sudo binary. When sudo is run via its sudoedit alias, sudo behaves as if the -e flag has been passed and allows users to edit files that require additional privileges to write to.

Microsoft released its own version of &quot;sudo&quot; for Windows in February 2024. It functions similarly to its Unix counterpart by giving the ability to run elevated commands from an unelevated console session. The program runas provides comparable functionality in Windows, but it cannot pass current directories, environment variables or long command lines to the child. And while it supports running the child as another user, it does not support simple elevation. Hamilton C shell also includes true &quot;su&quot; and &quot;sudo&quot; for Windows that can pass all of that state information and start the child either elevated or as another user (or both).

Graphical user interfaces exist for sudo – notably &quot;gksudo&quot; – but are deprecated in Debian and no longer included in Ubuntu. Other user interfaces are not directly built on sudo, but provide similar temporary privilege elevation for administrative purposes, such as pkexec in Unix-like operating systems, User Account Control in Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X Authorization Services.

doas, available since OpenBSD 5.8 (October 2015), has been written in order to replace &quot;sudo&quot; in the OpenBSD base system, with the latter still being made available as a port.

gosu is a tool similar to sudo that is popular in containers where the terminal may not be fully functional or where there are undesirable effects from running sudo in a containerized environment.

==History== 
They were the winners of the Asayan audition (similar to the &quot;American Idol&quot; series) in 2000 organized by Sony Music Entertainment Japan.

Their first single &quot;Pieces of a Dream&quot; was released on March 3, 2001, and was the best selling single that year (over 2 million). Most of their singles have reached #1 on the Oricon charts; all five albums have reached #1 the day they were released. Their #1 streak was broken by the KinKi Kids&#x27; album &quot;H Album: Hand&quot;, scoring them a #2 rank for &quot;Fo(u)r&quot;.

Chemistry is also known in Korea for the popular collaboration song &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Together Now,&quot; featuring talents from both Korea and Japan and for collaborating with Korean singer Lena Park who appears in the B-side &quot;Dance with Me&quot; on the &quot;Kimi ga Iru&quot; single.

On March 6, 2008, Kaname Kawabata married model Miki Takahashi. They met after she appeared in the PV for &quot;This Night.&quot;

Their single &quot;Period&quot; was selected as the fourth opening for the anime series &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood&quot;.

In 2010, Chemistry worked together with the 4-person dance group Synergy to release &quot;Shawty&quot;. Another joint work of the two groups was released November 3, 2010, titled &quot;Keep Your Love&quot;.

In 2011, Chemistry was tapped by Bandai Visual to record a song for the OVA series, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn&quot;, due to be the title song for the 3rd episode, &quot;The Ghost of Laplace&quot;. &quot;Merry-go-round&quot; is due for release on March 2, 2011, as a follow-up before the OVA&#x27;s actual release on March 5, 2011.

Their 15th single &quot;Wings of Words&quot; was used as the fourth opening theme for &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; from PHASE-38 to 49. Chemistry performed this song live in collaboration with the two-time Olympic champion in figure skating, Yuzuru Hanyu, at the 2018 Fantasy on Ice in Makuhari and Kanazawa. Kawabata made a solo appearance in the 2016 edition of the ice show as well.

After going on hiatus in 2012 so that both members could focus on pursuing solo careers, the pair resumed activities as a musical duo in 2017. Their new single &quot;Windy&quot; was used as the second ending theme song for the anime adaptation of &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="1008047" wikidata="Q240580" url="?curid=1008047" title="Infanta Pilar, Duchess of Badajoz">
<text>Infanta Pilar of Spain, Duchess of Badajoz and Viscountess of La Torre (Spanish: &quot;María del Pilar Alfonsa Juana Victoria Luisa Ignacia y Todos los Santos de Borbón y Borbón&quot;; 30 July 1936 – 8 January 2020), sometimes known more simply as Pilar de Borbón, was the elder daughter of Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona and Princess María Mercedes of the Two Sicilies, and older sister of King Juan Carlos I.

==Early life==

Infanta Pilar was the firstborn daughter of Juan de Borbón y Battenberg and María de las Mercedes de Borbón y Orleans, Counts of Barcelona, she was born in Ville Saint Blaise, home of the counts of Barcelona in Cannes (Alpes-Maritimes, France), on 30 July 1936. She was baptized in Cannes, in the church of Rins, with the name of &quot;María del Pilar Alfonsa Juana Victoria Luisa Ignacia de Todos los Santos de Borbón y Borbón&quot;. Her godparents were her paternal grandfather, King Alfonso XIII and her maternal grandmother the Princess Louise of Orléans, although Alfonso XIII acted by delegation as he did not want to meet his wife Queen Victoria Eugenia. From her birth, as the daughter of the heir to the Crown of Spain she was given the title of Infanta of Spain with treatment of Royal Highness. However, the official recognition of that title came when her brother was already King of Spain.

When she was an infant, the family moved to Rome where the Spanish Royal Family settled in exile. In 1941, after the resignation of Alfonso XIII, her father became the holder of the dynastic rights of the Spanish Crown in exile. During World War II she lived at Lausanne in Switzerland, where her grandmother, Queen Victoria Eugenia, lived. In 1946 the family resettled at Estoril in Portugal.

Together with her parents and her brother Juan Carlos, she took part in the ship tour organized by Queen Frederica and her husband King Paul of Greece in 1954, which became known as the “Cruise of the Kings” and was attended by over 100 royals from all over Europe. On this trip, Juan Carlos met the hosts&#x27; 15-year-old daughter, Sofia, his future wife, for the first time.

Her family attempted to marry her to Baudouin of Belgium, who ended up marrying Fabiola de Mora instead.

At the wedding of her brother  Juan Carlos I of Spain with Princess Sofía of Greece, in 1962, she was one of eight bridesmaids.

==Marriage and family==

Pilar needed to renounce her rights of succession to the Spanish throne to marry a commoner as stipulated by the Pragmatic Sanction of Charles III on marriages of members of the royal family.

She married Luis Gómez-Acebo y Duque de Estrada, 2nd Viscount of La Torre (23 December 1934 – 9 March 1991) on 5 May 1967 in Lisbon, Portugal at Jerónimos Monastery, who obtained with his marriage the status of Grandee of Spain. They had five children:

*Doña María de Fátima Simoneta Luisa Gómez-Acebo y Borbón (31 October 1968)
*Don Juan Filiberto Nicolás Gómez-Acebo y Borbón, &quot;later&quot; 3rd Viscount of La Torre (6 December 1969 – 12 August 2024)
*Don Bruno Alejandro Gómez-Acebo y Borbón (15 June 1971)
*Don Luis Beltrán Ataúlfo Alfonso Gómez-Acebo y Borbón (20 May 1973)
*Don Fernando Humberto Gómez-Acebo y Borbón (30 September 1974 – 1 March 2024)

Her husband died of lymphatic cancer on 9 March 1991.

==Equestrian sport==
Pilar de Borbón had been supporting international equestrian sport. She was President of the International Equestrian Federation from 1994 to 2006, succeeded by HRH Princess Haya bint al Hussein. She wrote the foreword of the official Spanish translation of the national instruction handbook of the German National Equestrian Federation, Técnicas Avanzadas de Equitación - Manual Oficial de Instrucción de la Federación Ecuestre Alemana.

From 1996 to 2006 she was a member of the International Olympic Committee for Spain, when she became an honorary member, and Member of the Executive Board of the Spanish Olympic Committee.

==Philanthropic and other activities==
Pilar de Borbón was one of the founders of &quot;Asociación Nuevo Futuro&quot; (&quot;New Future Association&quot;) in 1968, an international child support organization, and was its president and then president of honor. Until her death, she was one of the leaders and supporters of the Rastrillo Nuevo Futuro event, which provided part of the income that financed Asociación. The event even received the visit of the Queens of Spain, Letizia and Sofia. &quot;Rastrillo has always been a place of meeting, solidarity and enjoyment for her&quot;, wrote &quot;¡Hola! magazine&quot; in January 2019. Her last public appearance was in &quot;Rastrillo&quot; on 23 November 2019.

Pilar de Borbón was also a member of the board of directors of the Queen Sofía Spanish Institute in New York City, president of the World Monuments Fund España and, from 2007 to 2009, president of Europa Nostra, the European Federation for the Defense of Cultural Heritage.
She was also a music fan and accompanied her brother, King Juan Carlos of Spain, and nephews to bullfighting matches.

==Financial holdings==

Mossack Fonseca files document that in August 1974, Pilar de Borbón became president and director of the Panama-registered company Delantera Financiera SA (registered May 1969) with her husband as secretary-treasurer and director. In 1993, London-based Timothy Lloyd who had represented the undisclosed owner of the company said that Pilar de Borbón owned it. After March 1993, the intermediary representing the company was Madrid-based Abogados, a law firm founded by Pilar de Borbón&#x27;s brother-in-law . From July 2006 until its dissolution in June 2014, five days before the installation of her nephew Felipe VI, Pilar de Borbón&#x27;s son Bruno Alejandro Gómez-Acebo Borbón was director and treasurer of the company. On 7 April 2016 she admitted the accusations concerning the company were valid but made it clear that she never personally evaded taxes.

==Illness and death==
Pilar was operated for an intestinal obstruction on 2 February 2019 in Madrid, and was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2019, being made public in May of the same year. On 5 January 2020, she was admitted to the hospital as her condition worsened. She died 3 days later on 8 January at the Ruber International Hospital in Madrid, with her family at her side.

She was cremated on 9 January and her ashes were buried alongside her husband in Saint Isidore Cemetery, Madrid, in a private ceremony. On 28 January, her funeral was held in El Escorial basilica, attended by her nephew King Felipe VI of Spain, former Queen of the Netherlands, Princess Beatrix, her brother Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofía, cousin-in-law by marriage Queen Margarita (wife of Simeon II of Bulgaria), the Duke of Braganza Duarte Pio, and Spanish political authorities represented by Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo, Mayor of Madrid José Luis Martínez-Almeida and President of the Congress of Deputies Meritxell Batet.

===Early work===
Rey was born in Buenos Aires and studied acting under Hedwig Schlichter and Milagros de la Vega. He became known as an actor in Argentine movies. In 1957, he participated in the film &quot;El Diablo de vacaciones&quot;, directed by Ferruccio Cerio, with Nelly Panizza and Ana María Cassan, embarking on the ship &quot;Yapeyu&quot; to travel around the world, but filming did not conclude. In 1960, he began working with Ana Casares forming the main couple of the television program &quot;María Trastorno y yo&quot;, but within three months, production had to be interrupted, after he was hired in the United States for a small role in &quot;Battle at Bloody Beach&quot;.

===1960 to 1986===
In 1961, Rey made a guest appearance on the courtroom series &quot;Perry Mason&quot; as murder victim and title character Vincent Danielli in &quot;The Case of the Injured Innocent&quot;. He had supporting and leading roles in two episodes of &quot;Thriller&quot; titled &quot;Guillotine&quot; (1961) and &quot;La Strega&quot; (1962). One of Rey&#x27;s most visible film roles came in &quot;Fun in Acapulco&quot; (1963).

Rey&#x27;s best known role was that of casino owner and playboy Carlos Ramirez on the television series &quot;The Flying Nun&quot; (1967–70), which became an international success. He played a South American patriot in the &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; episode &quot;The Mist of Silence&quot;. He portrayed a Spanish sergeant on a 1966 episode of &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;. He also appeared in a season one episode of &quot;The Fugitive&quot; titled &quot;Smoke Screen&quot;. He appeared in an episode of &quot;Route 66&quot;, as a jai alai player in Florida and brother to one of Fidel Castro&#x27;s junior officers, hoping to be reunited with his brother.

Rey&#x27;s only credited lead in a film in the United States was in &quot;The Stepmother&quot; (1972). He remained busy on television, playing the role of Karl Duval on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; from 1976 to 1977. He was also a frequent panelist on the game shows &quot;Tattletales&quot;, &quot;He Said, She Said&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; and &quot;Match Game&quot;. He appeared as part of an ensemble cast in William Peter Blatty&#x27;s film &quot;The Ninth Configuration&quot; (1980). In 1986, he played Captain Luis Rueda on &quot;Dallas&quot;. He also directed for television, with credits on &quot;Villa Allegre&quot;, &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; and &quot;Forever Fernwood&quot;.
