<doc id="1024245" wikidata="Q2365095" url="?curid=1024245" title="Comfort in Sound">
<text>Comfort in Sound is the fourth studio album by Welsh rock band Feeder, released on 21 October 2002 and also the first to be released by the band after the suicide of drummer Jon Lee earlier in the year. The album was recorded at RAK Studios in London during most of 2002, and was produced by Gil Norton.

The band returned to live performance after Lee&#x27;s suicide, playing low-key slots at various festivals in the United Kingdom, before releasing the single &quot;Come Back Around&quot; and then the album. Three further singles—&quot;Just the Way I&#x27;m Feeling&quot;, &quot;Forget About Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Find the Colour&quot;—followed the album&#x27;s release. The album received positive reviews from the music press and was received well by the public, reaching number six on the UK Albums Chart. It is also one of the most successful albums of all time to be released in the United Kingdom as an independent album, selling 512,359 units and giving the band their second top ten single, &quot;Just the Way I&#x27;m Feeling&quot;. The album sold just over 501,000 .

Inside the inlay, there were also a number of illustrations by Aya Takano, including a picture per song for four of these only, each with a lyrical extract. The first three of these were released as singles from the album, all in their order of appearance in the booklet, which led to beliefs that the fourth song &quot;Comfort in Sound&quot;, would be the fourth single, only for &quot;Find the Colour&quot; to be released in its place instead.

In late 2016, &quot;Comfort in Sound&quot; was played in full on Kerrang! Radio, as part of a classic albums series. Later on in February 2017, the album was inducted into Virgin Radio&#x27;s &quot;Classic Albums Vault&quot;.

==Release==
The album was given a low-key promotional build up due to the death of drummer Jon Lee. Before the album&#x27;s release, the band played a warm-up show at the Portsmouth Wedgewood rooms prior to performing at the Reading and Leeds festivals and at the Gig on the Green. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine gave a rating of 5/5 (KKKKK), for the band&#x27;s performance at Reading. Part of the band&#x27;s appearance on the main stage at the 2003 Glastonbury Festival was featured on BBC Three and the full set was broadcast on BBC Radio 1 later in the year.
The band went on to play an arena tour at the end of the year, with high ticket sales and selling out at the Bournemouth International Centre.

Lead single &quot;Come Back Around&quot; had its first airplay on BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;The Evening Session&quot; show, and was A-listed by the station. The song was originally recorded as an instrumental demo in 2001, with the lyrics shortly written afterwards. After Lee&#x27;s suicide, Grant Nicholas re-wrote the lyrics to relate to their friend and colleague&#x27;s death: when the final version was recorded with Mark Richardson on drums. A completely instrumental version of the album was issued to television and radio media.

==Reception==
The album was well received by critics and was a commercial success. It initially entered the charts at #6 before dropping out of the top 75 after only four weeks. It charted at #178 on the 2002 year-end charts, selling just under 100,000 units. In 2003, the release of &quot;Just the Way I&#x27;m Feeling&quot; sent the album back to #13 and helped it to #66 in the 2003 end of year charts. The album re-entered the album charts in early 2005: in total, it spent 36 weeks in the top 75. , it has sold over 506,000 copies.

&quot;Just the Way I&#x27;m Feeling&quot; gained over 15,000 UK radio plays and charted at #10 on the UK singles chart, with follow-up single &quot;Come Back Around&quot; reaching #14.

<doc id="1024253" wikidata="Q3389201" url="?curid=1024253" title="Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn &amp; Jones Ltd.">
<text>Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn &amp; Jones Ltd. is the fourth album by the Monkees. It was released on November 6, 1967, during a period when the band exerted more control over their music and performed many of the instruments themselves (previously forbidden by Colgems). However, although the group had complete artistic control over the proceedings, they invited more outside contributions than on their previous album, &quot;Headquarters&quot;, and used session musicians to complement their sound. The album also featured one of the first uses of the Moog synthesizer in popular music. &quot;Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn &amp; Jones Ltd.&quot; sold over three million copies. It was the band&#x27;s fourth consecutive album to reach No. 1 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==History==
The group employed studio musicians to a greater extent than their previous album, &quot;Headquarters&quot;. The greater reliance on studio musicians resulted from the band&#x27;s busy filming schedule for their popular sitcom. The album&#x27;s single, &quot;Pleasant Valley Sunday&quot; b/w &quot;Words&quot;, was a hit, peaking at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

The album was among the earliest to make use of the Moog synthesizer, which Micky Dolenz introduced to the group and played in the studio; he owned one of the first twenty ever sold. Along with the Doors&#x27; September 1967 album &quot;Strange Days&quot; and the Byrds&#x27; January 1968 album &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot;, &quot;Pisces&quot; was one of the first commercial recordings featuring the Moog to reach a wide audience. Dolenz played the synthesizer on &quot;Daily Nightly&quot;, while electronic musician Paul Beaver played it on &quot;Star Collector&quot;.

Two additional songs, &quot;Daydream Believer&quot; and &quot;Goin&#x27; Down&quot;, were recorded during the album sessions. Released on 7-inch vinyl in October 1967, it was the group&#x27;s last single.

The album&#x27;s title stems from each band member&#x27;s respective astrological sign: Dolenz is Pisces, Peter Tork is Aquarius, and both Nesmith and Davy Jones are Capricorn. 

The album&#x27;s cover features a drawing of the four Monkees by Bernard Yeszin, their facial features blank, standing in a field of flowers, with the group&#x27;s guitar logo half-buried.

In 2007, Rhino issued a two-disc deluxe edition of the album. The CD set featured original album artwork, including replicas of the original Colgems vinyl labels on each disc, as well as a booklet of essays and session information by Monkees historian Andrew Sandoval. The discs contain remastered mixes of the album&#x27;s stereo and mono releases, as well as alternate mixes and outtakes.

<doc id="1024256" wikidata="Q1919060" url="?curid=1024256" title="Reflection attack">
<text>In computer security, a reflection attack is a method of attacking a challenge–response authentication system that uses the same protocol in both directions. That is, the same challenge–response protocol is used by each side to authenticate the other side. The essential idea of the attack is to trick the target into providing the answer to its own challenge.

== Attack ==
The general attack outline is as follows:

# The attacker initiates a connection to a target.
# The target attempts to authenticate the attacker by sending it a challenge. 
# The attacker opens another connection to the target, and sends the target this challenge as its own.
# The target responds to the challenge.
# The attacker sends that response back to the target on the original connection.

If the authentication protocol is not carefully designed, the target will accept that response as valid, thereby leaving the attacker with one fully authenticated channel connection (the other one is simply abandoned).

== Solution ==
Some of the most common solutions to this attack are described below:

* The responder sends its identifier within the response so, if it receives a response that has its identifier in it, it can reject it.
# Alice initiates a connection to Bob.
# Bob challenges Alice by sending a nonce &quot;N&quot;. 
# Alice responds by sending back the MAC calculated on her identifier and the nonce using the shared key &quot;K&quot;ab. 
# Bob checks the message and verifies the MAC, making sure it is from Alice and not a message he had sent in the past by making sure that it verifies with A and not B, and on the nonce which is the same as the one he sent in his challenge, then he accepts the message.
* Require the initiating party to first respond to challenges before the target party responds to its challenges.
* Require the key or protocol to be different between the two directions.

* Replay attack
* Man-in-the-middle attack
* Pass the hash

<text>The Bukusu people (Bukusu: Babukusu) are one of the 17 Kenyan tribes of the Luhya Bantu people of East Africa residing mainly in the counties of Bungoma and Trans Nzoia. They are the largest tribe of the Luhya nation, with 1,188,963 identifying as Bukusu in the 2019 Kenyan census. They speak the Bukusu dialect.

==Origins==
The Bukusu myths of origin state that the first man, Mwambu (the discoverer or inventor), was made from mud by Wele Khakaba (meaning &quot;God the Creator&quot;) at a place called Mumbo (which translates to &quot;west&quot;). God then created a woman known as Sela to be his wife. Mwambu and his descendants moved out of Mumbo and settled on the foothills of Mount Elgon (known to them as Masaba), from where their descendants grew to form the current Bukusu population.

Anthropologists believe that the Bukusu did not become distinct from the rest of the Luhya population until the late 18th century at the very earliest. They moved into central Uganda as part of a much larger group of people, many forming the eastern extension of the great Bantu migration out of central Africa. The Bukusu word for a sub-tribe such as the Bukusu, as well as smaller clans (for example, Kitanga) or phatries (such as Kituika, within the Kitanga clan) within the Bukusu people, is &quot;ekholo&quot;. The Bukusu are one of the major sub-tribes of the Luhya people.

==Settlement==
Together with other Luhya sub-nations, the Bukusu are thought to have first settled north of Lake Turkana at a place called Enambukutu. From there they settled in the Cherangani Hills at a place called Embayi, also known as Silikwa-mbayi. After evil and bad omens befell them, they dispersed taking six routes: five going around the western side of Mount Elgon and one via the eastern side of Mount Elgon. Those who went via the western side of Mount Elgon included the Basilikwa, the Banabayi, the Baneala, the Bakikayi and the Bamalaba. The Mwalie cluster took the eastern side route and settled at the Mwalie hills. This area was already inhabited by some Kalenjin sub-nationalities like the Laku, the Sabiny( known by the bukusu as basawinja), the Bongomek, and the Sebei, who were hostile to their new neighbors. To protect themselves against these tribes the Bukusu built fortified villages, an ancient art from their origin in Misri.
Currently, the Bukusu mainly inhabit Bungoma, Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu, Kakamega and Busia Counties of Western region of Kenya. The Bamasaba of Uganda are very closely related to the Babukusu, with many shared customs and closely related dialects. Previously, the Bukusu were referred to as the &quot;Kitosh&quot; by the colonialists; this was a word derived from the Nandi and Kwavi who used the word derogatively to describe the Babukusu. &quot;Kitosh&quot; means &#x27;the terrible ones&#x27;; they called them this because the Bukusu warriors were ruthless and decisive in battlefields. Following vigorous campaigns, the name Kitosh was eventually substituted by Bukusu in the mid-1950s.

===Oral tradition===

The Bukusu trace their origin from Muntu we Entebbe, who lived in Tabasya of Misri. Muntu was a great warrior who was later deified by the people of Misri. His son Mwambu married Sela, the granddaughter Samba Ambarani, who is believed to be Abraham the Hebrew. Mwambu founded the cities of Kush, Nabibia (Nubia), Namelu (Meroe), Rwa (Alwa) and others including Soba and Balana. Mwambu became the father of Mwaabini the inventor and discoverer. Mwaabini was the father of Kongolo and Saba.

Masaba, the father of Bukusu and Kisu, led the people to Embayi which was later to become Sirikwa, or the fallen kingdom. It fell after the people disobeyed their God Khakaba, so he sent a giant boulder from the sky which hit the land of Mbayi, causing an earthquake followed by swarms of stinging insects, epidemics and other calamities which forced the subjects of Sirikwa to scatter. They dispersed and settled among the Kipsigis, the Nandi, the Samburu, the Marakwet, the Borana and further beyond. The main body of the population headed south east and west under the banners of Basirikwa, Banabayi, Bakikayi, Baneala, Bamalaba and Bamwalie.

==Traditional life==
The Bukusu lived in fortified villages, and did not have a structure of central authority. The highest authority was the village headman, called &quot;Omukasa&quot;, who was usually elected by the men of the village. There were also healers and prophets who acquired great status through their knowledge of tribal tradition, medicines, and religion. Elijah Masinde, a resistance leader and traditional medicine man, was revered as a healer in the early 1980s.

===Family===
Bukusu family structure was traditionally modeled on the Luhya structure, it was and still is modeled on Bukusus culture itself. Families were usually polygamous, with the first wife accorded a special status among her co-wives. Society was entirely patriarchal: women were present not only as child-bearers but also as an indication of status. In addition, the practice of polygamy meant more hands to work the fields, an advantage in a society founded on agriculture.

Children inherited the clan of their father, and were not allowed to marry from either their own clan or their mother&#x27;s clan. The first son of the first wife was usually the main heir to his father, and he had a special name denoting this status: &quot;Simakulu&quot;. 
At birth, children were usually named after grandparents or famous people, or after the weather. Male and female names were different: male names frequently began with &#x27;W&#x27;, while female names usually began with &#x27;N&#x27;. Thus, for example, a boy born during a famine could be named &#x27;Wanjala&#x27;, while a girl could be named &#x27;Nanjala&#x27;. Both names share the same root word, &#x27;njala&#x27;, from &#x27;eNjala&#x27;, the Bukusu word for hunger.

===Initiation===
The Bukusu practice male circumcision. It is thought that they adopted the practice from contact with the Kalenjin at Mount Elgon. Others argue, however, that the presence of the practice in the other Luhya tribes indicates an earlier adoption, before the Bukusu settled at Mount Elgon.

In ceremonies that were spaced about two years apart, young boys of a particular age (usually about 15 years) would, on getting the go-ahead from their parents, invite relatives and friends to their initiation.

The initiation was a public event, witnessed by all. Going through the operation without showing any sign of pain is thought to be an indicator of bravery. Once circumcised, an initiate became a member of an age group.

There are eight age-groups known as &#x27;Bibingilo&#x27;. These are (&quot;Bakolongolo (2000-2010), Bakikwameti (2012-2022), Bakananachi (2024-2034), Bakinyikeu (2036-1946), Banyange (1948-1958), Bamaina (1960-1970), Bachuma (1972-1986)&quot;, &quot;Basawa (1988-1998)&quot;), forming a cyclical system spanning over 100 years, with each age-group lasting for 12 years(composed of 6 sub-sets of 2 years each) apart from &quot;Bachuma&quot; which lasts for 16 years (made up of 8 sub-sets of 2-years each), one of which lasted from 1872–1886. The reason for this was the tradition that there was an old man of the age group of &quot;Basawa&quot; from the previous cycle who was still alive and he was not meant to live and see the next &quot;Basawa.&quot; Eventually the old man died in 1884 and the &quot;Basawa&quot; ensued the next initiation period in 1888. It was then agreed to avoid such delays, and that any man who lives long enough to appear reaching the second cycle would be killed. This has been the tradition since then. Once the last age-group has been reached, the first is restarted, and so on. For example, the &quot;Bachuma&quot; age-group lasted from 1872 to 1886: every Bukusu circumcised within this period (that is, in 1872 through to 1886) belongs to that age-group. In 1888, the &quot;Basawa&quot; age group began, and lasted until 1898. Each age group is represented once every century.

Female circumcision is not a traditional Bukusu practice, though some clans are said to have practiced it. This is especially the case around Mount Elgon, where the neighbouring Kalenjin tribes also practice a form of female circumcision.

Although circumcision was universal among the Bukusu, the form of the ceremony varied according to the clan. In particular, the festivities and ceremonies accompanying the final stage of initiation, when the now-healed initiates came out of seclusion to rejoin their families as &#x27;men&#x27;, were specific to clans, and have been handed down largely intact to the present day.
Much was taught to these young initiates during this time which enabled them to face marriage with information.

===Marriage===
First marriages are typically between men aged 18–20, and women about age 16. There were two types of first-time marriage: arranged marriages and enforced eloping.
If a young man came from a well-to-do family, he would ask his sisters to find a girl for him to marry. The ability of a girl to cook well, bear children and work in the fields were the main attractions of a potential wife. Once a girl was identified, an emissary was sent to her parents to ask for her hand. The girl had no say whatsoever in the whole matter: bride price would be discussed, and once paid she would be sent to live with her new husband. This form of marriage is common in traditional households.

In some cases, the potential groom would be from a poor family and could not afford to pay the likely bride price. Traditional society allowed such boys to abduct the girls they intended to marry. (The girl had to present an opportunity to be &#x27;abducted&#x27;, so her cooperation was essential.) The couple would then leave their home to live with a far-off relative for a while, until the boy acquired enough wealth to pay the original bride price, as well as a fine, to the parents of the girl. This practice has since died out.

The Bukusu highly approve of intermarriages between themselves and the BaMasaaba; they have similarities in codes of conduct, marriage customs, circumcision traditions and folklore. Among the most famous of Bukusu marriage customs is the immense respect accorded to in-laws. A lady, for example, treats her father-in-law with much deference, and they are not allowed to make physical contact in any way. The same is true of a man and his mother-in-law.

In marriage, duties were strictly segregated. Housework and agricultural duties were performed by the women and children. The older boys looked after cattle. Young, newly married men formed the community&#x27;s warriors, while middle-aged men did little. Older men formed the village&#x27;s council of elders, and resolved disputes. Punishment for crimes was usually on an eye-for-an-eye basis, while petty crimes like theft were punished by the perpetrators being expelled from the village, and their property confiscated and redistributed to the wronged party.

Cattle were very important as the main means of exchange, alongside cowrie shells (known as chisimbi). Most values, from the beauty of a girl to the price of a field of land, were expressed in terms of heads of cattle. Possessing cattle, wealth, and prosperous agriculture, the Bukusu were sometimes not only admired but also envied by neighboring communities. Occasionally intermarriages would take place between them and the other communities and it was common practice for Kalenjin neighbors to give the Bukusu their sons to look after their herds of cattle. In times of famine, which are said to have been frequent among their Kalenjin neighbors, the latter used to even sell their children to the Bukusu. The Bukusu also used to send their own young boys to grow up with Kalenjin or Maasai families, in some cases for espionage purposes.

===Death===
Being sedentary pastoralists, they had time to care for their sick and bury their dead. A sick person was looked after until he recuperated or died. When a person died, he was buried in a grave with a warrior&#x27;s weapons if he was an elder. Several functions were performed during and after the funeral ceremony. Ordinarily, burial pits were deep, much shallower than today&#x27;s. People were buried facing east, the direction in which the sun rises. There are two known clans amongst the Bukusu who bury their people in a sitting position.

Wild animals like hyenas would sometimes exhume corpses from graves and eat them. In such an incident, people recovered the skull of the desecrated body and hanged it in a leafy tree. When the family of the deceased migrated, they brewed beer () for the ceremony of transferring the skull with them to the new home or settlement. An elder woman was entrusted with the responsibility of conveying the skull to the new site. Burial of the dead was ingrained in the Bukusu traditions.&lt;mapframe latitude=&quot;0.730571&quot; longitude=&quot;34.736023&quot; zoom=&quot;8&quot; width=&quot;221&quot; height=&quot;216&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;

==Demographics==
The Bukusu people are the largest sub-tribe of the Luhya people in Kenya, residing mainly in the counties of Bungoma and Trans Nzoia. In the 2019 Kenyan census, the total number of Luhyas was estimated at 6,823,842. Of these, 3, 944, 257 volunteered information about their sub-tribes, with Bukusu being named by 1,188,963 people.

==Economic activities==
Bukusu accounts indicate that both agricultural and pastoral economies have been practiced by the tribe for as long as can be remembered. This is authenticated by the vast amount of knowledge regarding farming practices, their rich pastoral vocabulary and the variety of legends connected with pastoral life. Today, they farm mainly maize for subsistence and sugar cane as a cash crop in the Bungoma area, as well as wheat in the Kitale area. Cattle and sheep are universally kept: cattle for milk, and sheep for meat and ceremonial functions (e.g.: offers for sacrifice). Larger or polygamous families will usually have a team of oxen for ploughing and haulage. Chicken, a traditional delicacy, are now kept for commercial egg production. The Bukusu also practiced craftsmanship skills in pottery, weaving, and blacksmithing.

==Politics==
Resistance and Nationalism

The Bukusu were known for their fierce opposition to colonial rule. Early in the colonial period, the community resisted British encroachment, including notable conflicts such as the 1895 revolt at Lumboka and Chetambe forts. These uprisings were some of the earliest organized acts of defiance against colonial forces in the region, as the Bukusu fought to preserve their autonomy and land from European control.

In the 20th century, the Bukusu&#x27;s resistance evolved into broader nationalist movements. A key figure during this period was Elijah Masinde, a healer and spiritual leader who founded the Dini ya Msambwa movement in the 1940s. This religious sect combined anti-colonial activism with a revival of traditional Bukusu spirituality and called for the end of British rule. Despite repeated imprisonments, Masinde remained a symbol of defiance and is remembered as a pivotal leader in the struggle for Kenyan independence,

The Bukusu currently form one of the main support bases of the governing coalition in Kenya, through the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy – Kenya (FORD–Kenya) political party led by Moses Wetangula and the New Ford Kenya party led by Eugene Wamalwa. Previously, they were associated with opposition to the Kalenjin-dominated reign of former President Daniel arap Moi.
Their political leaders have included Michael Christopher Wamalwa Kijana, Masinde Muliro, George Welime Kapten, Musikari Nazi Kombo and Moses Masika Wetangula, Peter Kisuya, Wakoli Bifwoli, Wafula Wamunyiyi, David Eseli Simiyu, and Lawrence Sifuna.

==Culture==
The Bukusu play a traditional seven-stringed lyre known as the &quot;litungu&quot; and the &quot;silili&quot;. Elijah Masinde, who formalised the traditional faith through Dini ya Msambwa, was a Bukusu elder; he promoted the culture and faith of the Bukusu and hence Luhya and African peoples. In Dini Ya Msambwa, Elijah Masinde resisted colonialism and the extermination of the Luhya people&#x27;s way of life.
Circumcision
Bukusu circumcision is done to boys that are between 12–28 years. They play trading jingle bells &quot;chinyimba&quot; as they call, visit all there relatives to inform them the date of circumcision. The boy to be circumcised, will do everything and make sure, he has informed everyone. Third day to the d day, the boy will be smeared with millet flour, &quot;khuchukhamo&quot; which will be used to make alcohol taken on the day of circumcision. The second last day, He will visit his uncle where by the bull will be slaughtered (likhoni) to signify the connection to uncle&#x27;s place. That will be the day of celebration and there after, the boy will be taken the following day to a place called &quot;sitosi/silongo&quot;, to be smeared by mud before he brought back home, stand in the courtyard (etiang&#x27;i) and be circumcised.

<doc id="1024270" wikidata="Q179356" url="?curid=1024270" title="White-rumped swift">
<text>The white-rumped swift (Apus caffer) is a species of swift. Although this small bird is superficially similar to a house martin, it is not closely related to that passerine species. The resemblances between the swallows and swifts are due to convergent evolution reflecting similar life styles.

==Description==
This long species has, like some relatives, a short forked tail and long swept-back wings that resemble a crescent or a boomerang. It is entirely dark except for a pale throat patch and a narrow white rump. It is similar to the closely related little swift, but is slimmer, darker and has a more forked tail and a narrower white rump.

==Call==
This is a quiet species compared to little swift, but a twittering trill is sometimes given.

==Habits==
Like other swifts they have very short legs that they use only for clinging to vertical surfaces. They never settle voluntarily on the ground, and spend most of their lives in the air, feeding on insects that they catch in their beaks. Like other swifts they drink on the wing.

==Habitat==
The habitat of this species is dictated by that of its hosts, and is therefore normally man-made structures such as bridges and buildings.

==Breeding range==
White-rumped swifts breed in much of sub-Saharan Africa, and have expanded into Morocco and southern Spain. The populations in Spain, Morocco and the south of Africa are migratory, although their wintering grounds are not definitively known. Birds in tropical Africa are resident apart from seasonal movements. In 2022, nesting was observed in Corsica.

==Breeding==
This species appropriates the nests of little swifts and those swallows which build retort-shaped nests. In Europe and north Africa, this usually means the red-rumped swallow, but south of the Sahara other species like wire-tailed swallow are also parasitised. The original owners of the nests are driven away, or the white-rumps settle in the nest and refuse to move. Once occupied, the nest is lined with feathers and saliva, and one or two eggs are laid.

<doc id="1024289" wikidata="Q720862" url="?curid=1024289" title="Earnings before interest and taxes">
<text>In accounting and finance, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is a measure of a firm&#x27;s profit that includes all incomes and expenses (operating and non-operating) except interest expenses and income tax expenses.

Operating income and operating profit are sometimes used as a synonym for EBIT when a firm does not have non-operating income and non-operating expenses.

== Formula ==
*EBIT = (net income) + interest + taxes = EBITDA – (depreciation and amortization expenses)
*operating income = (gross income) – OPEX = EBIT – (non-operating profit) + (non-operating expenses)
where
*EBITDA = earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
*OPEX = operating expense

== Overview ==
A professional investor contemplating a change to the capital structure of a firm (e.g., through a leveraged buyout) first evaluates a firm&#x27;s fundamental earnings potential (reflected by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and EBIT), and then determines the optimal use of debt versus equity (equity value).

To calculate EBIT, expenses (e.g. the cost of goods sold, selling and administrative expenses) are subtracted from revenues. Net income is later obtained by subtracting interest and taxes from the result.

<doc id="1024308" wikidata="Q1426885" url="?curid=1024308" title="Convention on International Civil Aviation">
<text>The Convention on International Civil Aviation, also known as the Chicago Convention, established the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency of the United Nations charged with coordinating international air travel. The Convention establishes rules of airspace, aircraft registration and safety, security, and sustainability, and details the rights of the signatories in relation to air travel. The convention also contains provisions pertaining to taxation. 

The document was signed on December 7, 1944, in Chicago by 52 signatory states. It received the requisite 26th ratification on March 5, 1947, and went into effect on April 4, 1947, the same date that ICAO came into being. In October of the same year, ICAO became a specialized agency of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). The convention has since been revised eight times (in 1959, 1963, 1969, 1975, 1980, 1997, 2000 and 2006).

 the Chicago Convention had 193 state parties, which includes all member states of the United Nations except Liechtenstein. The Cook Islands is a party to the Convention although it is not a member of the UN. The convention has been extended to cover Liechtenstein by the ratification of Switzerland.

==Main articles==
Some important articles are:

&quot;Article 1&quot;: Every state has complete and exclusive sovereignty over airspace above its territory.

&quot;Article 3 bis&quot;: Every other state must refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight.

== Kerosene tax ==
Article 24 of the Chicago Convention stipulates that when flying from one contracting state to another, the kerosene that is already on board aircraft may not be taxed by the state where the aircraft lands, nor by a state through whose airspace the aircraft has flown. This was intended to prevent double taxation. However, there is no tax regulation in the Chicago Convention to refuelling the aircraft before departure.

The Chicago Convention does not preclude a kerosene tax on domestic flights and on refueling before international flights. Although the ICAO has produced various policy documents suggesting that no taxes of any kind should be placed on aviation fuel, none of these are legally binding, and they are not found in the Chicago Convention itself.

Although there are numerous bilateral agreements, so-called &#x27;air services agreements&#x27;, which make more extensive agreements, including often tax exemption when refueling an aircraft that has come from another contracting state, these are independent from the Chicago Convention; moreover, some air services agreements do allow for the taxation of fuels.

<doc id="1024309" wikidata="Q7753904" url="?curid=1024309" title="The News &amp; Observer">
<text>The News &amp; Observer is an American regional daily newspaper that serves the greater Triangle area based in Raleigh, North Carolina. The paper is the largest in circulation in the state (second is the &quot;Charlotte Observer&quot;). The paper has been awarded three Pulitzer Prizes, the most recent of which was in 1996 for a series on the health and environmental impact of North Carolina&#x27;s booming hog industry. The paper was one of the first in the world to launch an online version of the publication, Nando.net in 1994.

== Ownership ==
On May 17, 1995 the News &amp; Observer Publishing Company was sold to McClatchy Newspapers of Sacramento, California, for $373 million, ending 101 years of Daniels family ownership. In the mid-1990s, flexo machines were installed, allowing the paper to print thirty-two pages in color, which was the largest capacity of any newspaper within the United States at the time. The McClatchy Company currently operates a total of twenty-nine daily newspapers in fourteen states with a combined weekday circulation of 1.6 million and a Sunday circulation of 2.4 million. With McClatchy&#x27;s acquisition of most of Knight Ridder&#x27;s properties in 2006, North Carolina&#x27;s two largest newspapers (the &quot;News &amp; Observer&quot; and &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot;) are now under common ownership.

==History==
The &quot;News &amp; Observer&quot; traces its roots to &quot;The Sentinel,&quot; which was founded by the Rev. William E. Pell in 1865 and who used, &quot;the newspaper to fight against the domination of carpetbaggers and other forces during Congressional Reconstruction.&quot; The paper&#x27;s struggles to stay relevant and make money led to new ownership in 1868. With the new owner &quot;The Sentinel&quot; began to cover the Democrats&#x27; push to retake the North Carolina Legislature, along with the impeachment of Gov. William W. Holden in 1871.
&quot;The Sentinel&quot; went bankrupt a little over ten years after the paper was first founded. The owners of the newly founded &quot;Raleigh Observer&quot;, Peter M. Hale and William L. Saunders, bought the now-bankrupt paper, ending its publication and focusing on the &quot;Raleigh Observer&quot;. After about ten years the paper ran out of money, so the two owners sold to the owner of the &quot;Raleigh News&quot;, Samuel A. Ashe.

Ashe combined the two papers under the new banner &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot; in September 1880, making it the sole daily paper in Raleigh. Ashe ran the company personally until 1894, focusing on politics and the Democratic party. Ashe used connections within the Democratic Party to get an upper leg on upcoming stories. This model worked well for the paper until Ashe lost favor in the Democratic caucus, leading the paper to fall on hard financial times for the fourth time in its history.

In 1894 the paper was sold at auction, this time to a Washington, North Carolina, native who was a strong Democratic supporter. Josephus Daniels, with help from Julian Carr and other friends, bought the paper. Quickly Daniels refocused the &quot;News and Observer&quot; to combat rampant corruption and other problems he saw within the state. Put differently by Daniels himself, &quot;The &quot;News and Observer&quot; was relied upon to carry the Democratic message and to be the militant voice of White Supremacy, and it did not fail in what was expected, sometimes going to extremes in its partisanship.&quot; Daniels believed that &quot;the greatest folly and crime&quot; in U.S. history was granting Blacks the right to vote.

In the findings of the Wilmington Race Riot Commission, Daniels is the only name mentioned as a cause of the Wilmington insurrection of 1898, According to historian Helen Edmonds, the paper &quot;led in a campaign of prejudice, bitterness, vilification, misrepresentation, and exaggeration to influence the emotions of the whites against the Negro.&quot; The result was the only successful &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in American history, the overthrow of Wilmington&#x27;s elected government by force.

In 1900, he used the paper to support soon-to-be Governor Charles B. Aycock, another white supremacist, during his bid for the office. He also used the paper to advocate female suffrage, workers&#x27; compensation, state industrialization, better roads and crop rotation.

In 2006, on occasion of the release of the report of the 1898 Wilmington Race Riot Commission, the newspaper offered &quot;an apology for the acts of someone [Daniels] we continue to salute in a different context…and for the misdeeds of the paper as an institution.&quot; The newspaper published a 16-page special report on the events of 1898.

===After Daniels===
Daniels continued to run the paper until his death in the mid-1940s. After his death his four sons assumed management of the company. All four sons contributed to the operation of the paper, but Jonathan Daniels, editor from 1933 to 1941 and from 1948 until 1964, kept the paper in the direction of appealing for school desegregation and a reduction in race related discrimination. It was also under Jonathan&#x27;s leadership that &quot;The News and Observer&quot; bought out the &quot;Raleigh Times&quot; and moved to a building on South McDowell St. in downtown Raleigh, where they stayed until the building was sold in 2015.

On September 3, 1934, &quot;The News and Observer&quot; began a column about state politics called &quot;Under the Dome&quot;, which started on the back page, moved to the front and now runs in the local section.

In 1968, the Daniels family hired Claude Sitton, who had been a correspondent for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and later an editor there. Serving as the editorial director of the paper, he promoted &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot; as a government watchdog and moved the news of the paper away from the personal and partisan stances it had taken under Josephus Daniels. However, its editorials were still often aligned with the Democratic Party. A year later, the &quot;Mini Page&quot; children&#x27;s supplement was created and published. Today, it is one of America&#x27;s most widely used children&#x27;s newspaper supplements.

Frank A. Daniels Jr., grandson of Josephus, was publisher and president of &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot; from 1971 to 1996. In 1971, Sitton became the editor and the paper began buying and publishing smaller local newspapers, starting with &quot;The Island Packet&quot; in Hilton Head, South Carolina and &quot;The Cary News&quot; in Cary, North Carolina.

On March 16, 1980, a welder&#x27;s torch started a fire and burned through newsprint threaded through the press, injuring three and causing millions in damage.

In 1987, the staffs of &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot; and &quot;The Raleigh Times&quot; merged, and on November 30, 1989, the last edition of &quot;The Raleigh Times&quot; was published. In 1988, &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot; endorsed its first Republican candidate for statewide election, showing, perhaps, a distancing from Democratic partisanship.

Throughout the early 1990s, &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot; divested itself of various local newspapers in South Carolina and the North Carolina mountains, and by September 1993, Sunday sales of &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot; reached 200,000 for every week. However, the newspaper still owns &quot;The Cary News&quot;, &quot;Chapel Hill News&quot;, and the &quot;Smithfield Herald&quot; among other newspapers. In 1994, the paper created Nando.net, becoming an Internet service provider and began publishing the NandO Times online newspaper.

In 1999, &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot; was named one of America&#x27;s 100 best newspapers by the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;, and one of the 17 best-designed newspapers in the world by the Society for News Design.

In 2004, &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot; along with three other news publishers filled suit against the Raleigh–Durham International Airport for preventing the company from adding new newspaper racks in the terminal. After appeal, a 2010 decision from the Fourth Circuit determined that the restriction was a violation of the first amendment because it put a restriction on expression.

In September 2008, the &quot;News and Observer&quot; offered buyouts to all 320 newsroom employees, approximately 40% of its staff, in an effort to cut expenses. Previously the company had shut down its Durham news bureau and in a separate event laid off 70 employees. Layoffs and buyouts have continued since then.

In 2015 the newspaper announced it would sell its facility in downtown Raleigh for redevelopment, which will entail demolition of much of the facility. New presses will be installed at the newspaper&#x27;s auxiliary production facility in Garner. Editorial offices will remain in a portion of the redeveloped facility. By June 2021, the paper only employed 64 reporters.

<text>Chuan Leekpai MPCh MVM ThChW (, , ; ; born 28 July 1938) is a Thai politician who is the former president of the National Assembly of Thailand as well as the speaker of the Thai House of Representatives from 2019 to 2023. Previously he twice served as the 20th Prime Minister of Thailand, from 20 September 1992 to 19 May 1995 and from 9 November 1997 to 9 February 2001.

As the leader of the Democrat Party, Chuan was elected in September 1992, becoming Thailand&#x27;s first prime minister to come to power without either aristocratic or military backing. His first administration consisted of a five party coalition of the Democrat, New Aspiration, Palang Dhamma, Social Action, and Social Unity Parties until he was defeated in the 1995 election, but assumed power in late-1997 following the fall of the Chavalit Yongchaiyudh administration, which was held responsible for the economic crisis that beset Thailand that year. Although criticised as a slow actor and allowing numerous corruption scandals, Chuan managed to meet factional demands and extend Thailand&#x27;s social security system.

==Early life==
Chuan was born to ethnic Chinese parents on 28 July 1938 in Mueang Thap Thiang, Trang province, Thailand, to a teacher, Niyom Leekpai and Tuan Leekpai, Chuan has nine siblings and is the third child in the family. He would later move to the temple school at Wat Amarintraram in Bangkok where he lived for six years. He went on to study law at Thammasat University, Bangkok and later became a barrister-at-laws of the Thai Bar Association. Chuan is ethnic Hokkien, coming from a third-generation Thai Chinese.

== First term (1992–1995) ==
In the aftermath of Bloody May, the Democrat Party won a plurality of seats in the September 1992 elections, with 79 seats, compared to the Chart Thai Party with 77 seats. Chuan formed a coalition government with the New Aspiration Party and Ekkaparb parties. The Phalang Dharma Party joined his cabinet after the New Aspiration Party left in 1994.

Key policies of Chuan&#x27;s first administration included:
* Engagement with Burma. As with all previous administrations, the Chuan government employed a policy of constructive engagement with the military government of Burma, provoking much criticism.
* Reforestation. A huge five million rai reforestation programme in honour of King Bhumibol&#x27;s 50th anniversary of accession to the throne (1996) was initiated in 1994. The reforestation programme was officially declared a failure, with less than 40 percent of the target realised. The director-general of the RFD was suspended from his post for alleged corruption.
* Emphasis on national economic stability, decentralisation of the administrative powers to the rural provinces, fostering income, opportunity and economic development distribution to the regions.

The first Chuan administration fell when members of the cabinet were implicated in profiting from Sor Phor Kor 4-01 land project documents distributed in Phuket Province. Fierce public and press criticism and dissolution of parliament were the reasons for his administration&#x27;s downfall.

== Second term (1997–2001) ==
Chuan became prime minister for the second time on 9 November 1997, replacing Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, with a shaky line-up of a six party coalition and 12 independent defectors from a seventh party, Prachakorn Thai. The ruling coalition increased its 20-seat majority in October 1998, by including the Chart Pattana Party.

===Economic reform===
Chuan&#x27;s second government enacted several economic reforms for which it was severely criticised. Chuan&#x27;s &quot;bitter medicine&quot; policies brought little economic relief in the years following the 1997 economic crisis, particularly at the grassroots level. Opinions emerged that the Democrats were only helping big financial institutions and making the country more dependent of foreign investors. Nevertheless, many of the reforms recommended by the IMF were in line with the policies of market economies such as Australia and New Zealand. The subsequent government&#x27;s economic growth was based even more strongly on selling national assets and private organisations abroad such as the Shin Corporation, while most of its economic gains were built on the frugality of the Democrat policy platform. Thai Rak Thai painted the Democrats as having &quot;open contempt&quot; for the plight of the common Thai which set off a revenge vote against the party during the 2001 election, which gave a landslide victory to Thaksin Shinawatra.

===Education reform===
During Chuan&#x27;s second administration the National Education Act 1999 was enacted.

===Human rights===
Chuan&#x27;s second government came under fire for the violent arrest of 223 villagers protesting the Pak Mun Dam. Historian Nidhi Iawsriwong noted that &quot;the present situation is as worse as that of the May event (the bloody crackdown of anti-government protesters in 1992). We have a tyrannical government that is arrogant and not accountable to the public. This is dangerous because the government still sees itself as legitimate and claims that it is democratic. In fact, it is as brutal as the military government&quot;.

Controversy arose in early 1999 when it became known that Chuan nominated Thanom Kittikachorn to the post of honorary royal guard, provoking widespread criticism. The situation was resolved when Thanom resigned. Thanom was one of the &quot;three tyrants&quot; who ruled Thailand from 1963 to 1973 and ordered the massacre of pro-democracy students on 14 October 1973, after which he was ordered to step down and be exiled by King Bhumibol Adulyadej.

In April 2000, the editor in chief of the Chiang Mai daily newspaper &quot;Pak Nua&quot; was shot and seriously wounded in an attempted murder, but recovered. The editor believed that his repeated critical reporting on the government led to the assault.

===Corruption===

Although generally regarded as relatively clean and honest when compared to other Thai administrations, Chuan&#x27;s government found itself plagued with corruption scandals and rumours. Key cases of corruption included:
* Rakkiat Sukhthana, Health Minister, was charged with taking a five million baht (US$125,000) bribe from a drug firm and forcing state hospitals to buy medicine at exorbitant prices. After being found guilty, he jumped bail and went into hiding.
* Suthep Thaugsuban, Minister of Transport and Communications, whose brokering of illegal land deals caused the fall of the Chuan 1 government, was linked to abuse of funds in setting up a co-operative Surat Thani Province.
* The &quot;edible fence&quot; seed scandal, in which massive overpricing of seeds distributed to rural areas happened. The Deputy Minister of Agriculture was forced to resign.
* The Salween logging scandal, where up to 20,000 trees were felled illegally in the Salween forest in Mae Hong Son. Some of them turned up in the compound of the Democrat party&#x27;s office in Phichit Province.
* Sanan Kajornprasart, Interior Minister, as well as eight other cabinet ministers were found to have understated their declared assets. Sanan was later barred by the Constitutional Court from politics for five years.
* Chuan himself was found by the National Counter-Corruption Commission to have undeclared shareholdings in a rural cooperative.

Chuan stepped down as the Leader of Democrat Party in 2003.

==Personal life==
Chuan Leekpai has one son, , with Pakdiporn Sujaritkul, his common-law wife. His mother tongue is Southern Thai, but his proficiency in Central Thai is native level. He is able to speak English well.

<doc id="1024314" wikidata="Q1107958" url="?curid=1024314" title="Mental accounting">
<text>Mental accounting (or psychological accounting) is a model of consumer behaviour developed by Richard Thaler that attempts to describe the process whereby people code, categorize and evaluate economic outcomes. Mental accounting incorporates the economic concepts of prospect theory and transactional utility theory to evaluate how people create distinctions between their financial resources in the form of mental accounts, which in turn impacts the buyer decision process and reaction to economic outcomes. People are presumed to make mental accounts as a self control strategy to manage and keep track of their spending and resources. People budget money into mental accounts for savings (e.g., saving for a home) or expense categories (e.g., gas money, clothing, utilities). People also are assumed to make mental accounts to facilitate savings for larger purposes (e.g., a home or college tuition). Mental accounting can result in people demonstrating greater loss aversion for certain mental accounts, resulting in cognitive bias that incentivizes systematic departures from consumer rationality. Through an increased understanding of mental accounting differences in decision making based on different resources, and different reactions based on similar outcomes can be greater understood. 

As Thaler puts it, &quot;All organizations, from General Motors down to single person households, have explicit and/or implicit accounting systems. The accounting system often influences decisions in unexpected ways&quot;. Particularly, individual expenses will usually not be considered in conjunction with the present value of one&#x27;s total wealth; they will be instead considered in the context of two accounts: the current budgetary period (this could be a monthly process due to bills, or yearly due to an annual income), and the category of expense. People can even have multiple mental accounts for the same kind of resource. A person may use different monthly budgets for grocery shopping and eating out at restaurants, for example, and constrain one kind of purchase when its budget has run out while not constraining the other kind of purchase, even though both expenditures draw on the same fungible resource (income).

One detailed application of mental accounting, the Behavioral Life Cycle Hypothesis posits that people mentally frame assets as belonging to either current income, current wealth or future income and this has implications for their behavior as the accounts are largely non-fungible and marginal propensity to consume out of each account is different. 

== Utility, value and transaction ==

In mental accounting theory, the framing effect defines that the way a person subjectively frames a transaction in their mind will determine the utility they receive or expect. The concept of framing is adopted in prospect theory, which is commonly used by mental accounting theorists as the value function in their analysis (Richard Thaler Included ). In Prospect Theory, the value function is concave for gains (implying an aversion to risk), indicating decreasing marginal utility with accumulation of gain. The value function is convex for losses (implying a risk-seeking attitude). A concave value function for gain incentivizes risk-averse behavior because marginal gain decreases relative increase in value. Conversely, a convex value function for losses means that the impact of a loss is more detrimental to a person than an equivalent gain, thus incentivizing risk-seeking behavior in order to avoid loss. These proponents of the value function portray the concept of loss aversion, which asserts that people are more likely to make decisions in order to minimize loss than to maximise gain.

Given the Prospect Theory framework, how do people interpret, or &#x27;account for&#x27;, multiple transactions/outcomes, of the format formula_1? They can either view the outcomes jointly, and receive formula_2, in which case the outcomes are integrated, or formula_3, in which case we say that the outcomes are segregated. The choice to integrate or segregate multiple outcomes can be beneficial or detrimental to overall utility depending on the correctness of application. Due to the nature of our value function&#x27;s different slopes for gains and losses, our utility is maximized in different ways, depending on how we code the four kinds of transactions formula_4 and formula_5 (as gains or as losses):1) Multiple gains: formula_4 and formula_5 are both considered gains. Here, we see that formula_8. Thus, we want to segregate multiple gains.

2) Multiple losses: formula_4 and formula_5 are both considered losses. Here, we see that formula_11. We want to integrate multiple losses.

3) Mixed gain: one of formula_4 and formula_5 is a gain and one is a loss, however the gain is the larger of the two. In this case, formula_14. Utility is maximized when we integrate a mixed gain.

4) Mixed loss: again, one of formula_4 and formula_5 is a gain and one is a loss, however the loss is now significantly larger than the gain. In this case, formula_17. Clearly, we don&#x27;t want to integrate a mixed loss when the less is significantly larger than the gain. This is often referred to as a &quot;silver lining&quot;, a reference to the folk maxim &quot;every cloud has a silver lining&quot;. When the loss is just barely larger than the gain, integration may be preferred.

Integration and segregation of outcomes is a means of framing that can impact the overall utility derived from multiple outcomes. Mental accounting interprets the tendency of people to mentally segregate their financial resources into different categories. In the event of financial losses or gains in different mental accounts, people will be impacted differently than if the financial loss was integrated across their entire financial portfolio. In the event of multiple gain and mixed loss, mental accounting will segregate outcomes resulting in maximised utility. In the event of multiple losses and mixed gain, mental accounting will segregate outcomes resulting in minimized utility.

There are two values attached to any transaction - acquisition value and transaction value. &quot;Acquisition value&quot; is the money that one is ready to part with for physically acquiring some good. &quot;Transaction value&quot; is the value one attaches to having a good deal. If the price that one is paying is equal to the mental reference price for the good, the transaction value is zero. If the price is lower than the reference price, the transaction utility is positive. Total utility received from a transaction, then, is the sum of acquisition utility and transaction utility.

== Pain of Paying ==
A more proximal psychological mechanism through which mental accounting influences spending is through its influence on the pain of paying that is associated with spending money from a mental account. Pain of paying is a negative affective response associated with a financial loss. Prototypical examples are the unpleasant feeling that one experiences when watching the fare increase on a taximeter or at the gas pump. When considering an expense, consumers appear to compare the cost of the expense to the size of an account that it would deplete (e.g., numerator vs. denominator). A $30 t-shirt, for example, would be a subjectively larger expense when drawn from $50 in one&#x27;s wallet than $500 in one&#x27;s checking account. The larger the fraction, the more pain of paying the purchase appears to generate and the less likely consumers are to then exchange money for the good. Other evidence of the relation between pain of paying and spending include the lower debt held by consumers who report experiencing a higher pain of paying for the same goods and services than consumers who report experiencing less pain of paying.

== Main principles of mental accounts ==
Richard Thaler divided the concept mental accounting into two main principles; segregation of gains and losses, and account reference points. Both principles utilize concepts related to utility and pain of paying to interpret how people evaluate economic outcomes.

=== Segregation of gains and losses ===
A main principle of mental accounting is the assertion that people frame gains and losses by segregating into different mental accounts rather than integrating into their overall account. The impact of this tendency means that outcomes can be framed based on the context of a decision. In mental accounting the framing of a decision reduces from the overall account to a smaller segregated account which can incentivize purchase decisions. An example of this was posed by Thaler where people were more inclined to drive 20 minutes to save $5 on a $15 purchase than on a $125 purchase. The principle applies to mental accounting where if gains and losses are viewed relative to a smaller segregated account then the outcome is viewed differently.

=== Account reference points ===
Account reference points refer to the tendency for people to set a reference point on a current decision based on prior outcome in the same mental account. As a result the impact of prior outcomes integrate into the current decision when determining overall utility. An example was posed by Thaler where gamblers were more inclined to make risk-seeking bets on the last race of the day. This phenomenon was justified by the assertion that gamblers segregate the gains and losses from each day into separate accounts and integrate gains and losses for each day in an account. It can then be interpreted that end-of-day risk-seeking bets is an example of loss aversion where gamblers attempt to equalize their daily account.

== Practical implications ==
Since the inception of the concept, mental accounting has been applied to interpret consumer behavior particularly in the contexts of online shopping, consumer reward points, public taxation policy.

=== Psychology ===
Mental accounting is subject to many logical fallacies and cognitive biases, which hold many implications such as overspending.

=== Credit cards and cash payments ===
Another example of mental accounting is the greater willingness to pay for goods when using credit cards than cash. Swiping a credit card prolongs the payment to a later date (when we pay our monthly bill) and integrates it to a large existing sum (our bill to that point). This delay causes the payment to stick in our memory less clearly and saliently. Furthermore, the payment is no longer perceived in isolation; rather, it is seen as a (relatively) small increase of an already large credit card bill. For example, it might be a change from $120 to $125, instead of a regular, out-of-pocket $5 cost. And as we can see from our value function, this &quot;V(-$125) – V(-$120)&quot; is smaller than &quot;V(-$5),&quot; thus the pain of paying is reduced.
=== Marketing ===
Mental accounting can be useful for marketers predict customer response to bundling of pricing and segregation of products. People respond more positively to incentives and costs when gains are segregated, losses are integrated, marketers segregate net losses (the silver lining principle), and integrate net gains. Automotive dealers, for example, benefit from these principles when they bundle optional features into a single price but segregate each feature included in the bundle (e.g. velvet seat covers, aluminum wheels,anti-theft car lock). Cellular phone companies can use principles of mental accounting when deciding how much to charge consumers for a new smartphone and to give them for their trade-in. When the cost of the phone is large and the value of the phone to be traded in is low, it is better to charge consumers a slightly higher price for the phone and return that money to them as a higher value on their trade in. Conversely, when the cost of the phone and the value of the trade-in are more comparable, because consumers are loss averse, it is better to charge them less for the new phone and offer them less for the trade-in.

=== Public policy ===
Mental accounting can also be utilized in public economics and public policy. Inherently, the way that people (and therefore tax-payers and voters) perceive decisions and outcomes will be influenced by their process of mental accounting. Policy-makers and public economists could potentially apply mental accounting concepts when crafting public systems, trying to understand and identify market failures, redistribute wealth or resources in a fair way, reduce the saliency of sunk costs, limiting or eliminating the Free-rider problem, or even just when delivering bundles of multiple goods or services to taxpayers. The following examples exist where mental accounting applied to public policy and programs produced positive outcomes.

A good example of the importance of considering mental accounting while crafting public policy is demonstrated by authors Justine Hastings and Jesse Shapiro in their analysis of the SNAP (Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program). They &quot;argue that these findings are not consistent with households treating SNAP funds as fungible with non-SNAP funds, and we support this claim with formal tests of fungibility that allow different households to have different consumption functions&quot; Put differently, their data supports Thaler&#x27;s (and the concept of mental accounting&#x27;s) claim that the principle of fungibility is often violated in practice. Furthermore, they find SNAP to be very effective, calculating a marginal propensity to consume SNAP-eligible food (MPCF) out of benefits received by SNAP of 0.5 to 0.6. This is much higher than the MPCF out of cash transfers, which is usually around 0.1.

The implications of taxation policy on taxpayers was examined through mental accounting principles in &quot;Optimal Taxation with Behavioral Insights&quot;. The research paper applied the ideology of the three pillars of optimal taxation, and incorporated mental accounting concepts (as well as misperceptions and internalities). Outcomes included novel economic insights, including application of nudges present in optimal taxation frameworks, and challenging the Diamond-Mirrlees productive efficiency result and the Atkinson-Stiglitz uniform commodity taxation proposition, finding they are more likely to fail with behavioral agents.

In the paper &quot;Public vs. Private Mental Accounts: Experimental Evidence from Savings Groups in Colombia&quot;, it was demonstrated that mental accounting can be exploited to help nudge people towards saving more. The study found that publicly creating a savings goal greatly increased the savings rate of participants when compared to the control and those who set savings goals privately. The power of the labeling effect was observed to vary based on the savings success history of the participants.

Mental accounting plays a powerful role in our decision-making processes. It is important for public policy experts, researchers, and policy-makers continue to explore the ways that it can be utilized to benefit public welfare.

<text>NOAA-4, also known as ITOS-G was a weather satellite operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It was part of a series of satellites called ITOS, or improved TIROS. 

NOAA-4 was launched on a Delta rocket on November 15, 1974. The launch carried two other satellites: AMSAT-OSCAR 7 and Intasat.

It remained operational for 1463 days until it was deactivated by NOAA on November 18, 1978.

<text>A pyrgeometer is a device that measures near-surface infra-red (IR) radiation, approximately from 4.5 μm to 100 μm on the electromagnetic spectrum (thereby excluding solar radiation).

It measures the resistance/voltage changes in a material that is sensitive to the net energy transfer by radiation that occurs between itself and its surroundings (which can be either in or out). By also measuring its own temperature and making some assumptions about the nature of its surroundings it can infer a temperature of the local atmosphere with which it is exchanging radiation.

Since the mean free path of IR radiation in the atmosphere is ~25 meters, this device typically measures IR flux in the nearest 25 meter layer.

== Pyrgeometer components ==
A pyrgeometer consists of the following major components:

*A thermopile sensor which is sensitive to radiation in a broad range from 200 nm to 100 μm
*A silicon dome or window with a solar blind filter coating. It has a transmittance between 4.5 μm and 50 μm that eliminates solar shortwave radiation.
*A temperature sensor to measure the body temperature of the instrument.
*A sun shield to minimize heating of the instrument due to solar radiation.

== Measurement of long wave downward radiation ==

The atmosphere and the pyrgeometer (in effect its sensor surface) exchange long wave IR radiation. This results in a net radiation balance according to:

:formula_1

Where (in SI units):
* = net radiation at sensor surface [W/m2]
* = long-wave radiation received from the atmosphere [W/m2]
* = long-wave radiation emitted by the sensor surface [W/m2]

The pyrgeometer&#x27;s thermopile detects the net radiation balance between the incoming and outgoing long wave radiation flux and converts it to a voltage according to the equation below.

:formula_2

Where (in SI units):
* =net radiation at sensor surface [W/m2]
* = thermopile output voltage [V]
* = sensitivity/calibration factor of instrument [V/W/m2]

The value for is determined during calibration of the instrument. The calibration is performed at the production factory with a reference instrument traceable to a regional calibration center.

To derive the absolute downward long wave flux, the temperature of the pyrgeometer has to be taken into account. It is measured using a temperature sensor inside the instrument, near the cold junctions of the thermopile. The pyrgeometer is considered to approximate a black body. Due to this it emits long wave radiation according to:

:formula_3

Where (in SI units):
* = long-wave radiation emitted by the earth surface [W/m2]
* = Stefan–Boltzmann constant [W/(m2·K4)]
* = Absolute temperature of pyrgeometer detector [K]

From the calculations above the incoming long wave radiation can be derived. This is usually done by rearranging the equations above to yield the so-called pyrgeometer equation by Albrecht and Cox.

:formula_4

Where all the variables have the same meaning as before.

As a result, the detected voltage and instrument temperature yield the total global long wave downward radiation.

== Usage ==
Pyrgeometers are frequently used in meteorology, climatology studies. The atmospheric long-wave downward radiation is of interest for research into long term climate changes.

The signals are generally detected using a data logging system, capable of taking high resolution samples in the millivolt range.

<doc id="1024326" wikidata="Q93781" url="?curid=1024326" title="Paul Watzlawick">
<text>Paul Watzlawick (July 25, 1921 – March 31, 2007) was an Austrian-American family therapist, psychologist, communication theorist, and philosopher. A theoretician in communication theory and radical constructivism, he commented in the fields of family therapy and general psychotherapy. Watzlawick believed that people create their own suffering in the very act of trying to fix their emotional problems. He was one of the most influential figures at the Mental Research Institute and lived and worked in Palo Alto, California.

==Early life and education==
Paul Watzlawick was born in Villach, Austria in 1921, the son of a bank director. After he graduated from high school in 1939, Watzlawick studied philosophy and philology at the Università Ca&#x27; Foscari Venice and he earned a PhD (doctor of philosophy degree) in 1949. He then studied at the Carl Jung Institute in Zürich, where he received a degree in analytical psychology in 1954. In 1957 he continued his research career at the University of El Salvador.

==Career==
In 1960, Donald deAvila Jackson arranged for him to go to Palo Alto to do research at the Mental Research Institute (MRI). Starting in 1967 he taught psychiatry at Stanford University.

At the Mental Research Institute Watzlawick followed in the footsteps of Gregory Bateson and the research team (Jackson, John Weakland, Jay Haley) responsible for introducing what became known as the &quot;double bind&quot; theory of schizophrenia. Double bind can be defined as a person trapped under mutually-exclusive expectations. Watzlawick&#x27;s 1967 work based on Bateson&#x27;s thinking, &quot;Pragmatics of Human Communication&quot;, with Don Jackson and Janet Beavin, became a cornerstone work of communication theory. Other scientific contributions include works on radical constructivism and most importantly his theory on communication. He was active in the field of family therapy.

Watzlawick was one of the three founding members of the Brief Therapy Center at MRI. In 1974, members of the Center published a major work on their brief approach, &quot;Change, Principles of Problem Formation and Problem Resolution&quot; (Watzlawick, Weakland, Fisch).

He was licensed as a psychologist in California from 1969 to 1998, when he stopped seeing patients.

==Personal life==
Watzlawick was married (Vera) and had two stepdaughters (Yvonne and Joanne). A cardiac arrest at his home in Palo Alto caused his death at the age of 85.

==Work==

=== Interactional view ===

Watzlawick did extensive research on how communication is effected within families. Watzlawick defines five basic axioms in his theory on communication, popularly known as the &quot;Interactional View&quot;. The Interactional View is an interpretive theory drawing from the cybernetic tradition. Watzlawick considered five axioms as a prerequisite for functioning communication process and competence between two individuals or an entire family. According to him, miscommunication happens because not all of the communicators are &quot;speaking the same language&quot;. This happens because people have different viewpoints of speaking. With an underlying cybernetic structure, Watzlawick considered causality of a circular, feedback nature, with information as a core element. it is concerned with the processes of communication within systems of the widest sense and therefore also with human systems, e.g., families, large organizations and international relations.

Within the &quot;Interactional View&quot; communication is based on what is happening, and not necessarily associated with who, when, where, or why it takes place. He studied &quot;Normal&quot; as well as the &quot;disturbed&quot; family in order to infer conditions conducive to the approach of interaction-orientation. He believed that individual personality, character, and deviance are shaped by the individual&#x27;s relations with his fellows. He saw symptoms, defenses, character structure and personality as terms describing the individual&#x27;s typical interactions, which occur in response to a particular interpersonal context.

=== Five basic axioms ===
The &quot;Interactional View&quot; requires a network of communication rules that govern a family homeostasis, which is the tacit collusion of family members to maintain the &quot;status quo&quot;. Even if the status quo is negative it can still be hard to change. Interactional theorists believe that a person will fail to recognize this destructive resistance to change unless he or she understand Watzlawick&#x27;s axioms. The following axioms can explain how miscommunication can occur if not all the communicators are on the same page. If one of these axioms is somehow disturbed, communication might fail. All of these axioms are derived from the work of Gregory Bateson, much of which is collected in &quot;Steps to an Ecology of Mind&quot; (1972).

Watzlawick, Beavin Bavelas and Jackson support these axioms to maintain family homeostasis.
* &quot;One cannot &quot;not&quot; communicate&quot;: Every behavior is a form of communication. Because behavior does not have a counterpart (there is no anti-behavior), it is impossible not to communicate. Even if communication is being avoided (such as the unconscious use of non-verbals or symptom strategy), that is a form of communication. &quot;Symptom strategy&quot; is ascribing our silence to something beyond our control and makes no communication impossible. Examples of symptom strategy are sleepiness, headaches, and drunkenness. Even facial expressions, digital communication, and being silent can be analyzed as communication by a receiver.
* &quot;Every communication has a content and relationship aspect such that the latter classifies the former and is therefore a metacommunication&quot;: All communication includes, apart from the plain meaning of words, more information. This information is based on how the speaker wants to be understood and how he himself sees his relation to the receiver of information. Relationship is the command part of the message or how it is non-verbally said. Content is the report or what is said verbally. Being able to interpret both of these aspects is essential in understanding something that a communicator said. The relational aspect of interaction is known as metacommunication. Metacommunication is communication about communication. Relationship messages are always the most important element in communication.
* &quot;The nature of a relationship is dependent on the punctuation of the partners&#x27; communication procedures&quot; (punctuation as translated from &quot;Interpunktion&quot; in German) : Both the sender and the receiver of information structure the communication flow differently and therefore interpret their own behavior during communicating as merely a reaction on the other&#x27;s behavior (i.e., every partner thinks the other one is the cause of a specific behavior). To &quot;punctuate&quot; a communication means to interpret an ongoing sequence of events by labeling one event as the cause or beginning, and the following event as the response. In a situation with communication, if one thing happens, something else always happens. For example, a female in a relationship with a male is feeling depressed. The male in the relationship with the female feels guilty. One who observes this situation might ask, &quot;Is she depressed because of his guilt, or does he feel guilty because of her depression?&quot;
* &quot;Human communication involves both digital and analog modalities&quot;: This axiom refers back to the use of non-verbals and system strategy explained in the first axiom. It is mostly related to the digital content of communication within a relationship.
* &quot;Inter-human communication procedures are either symmetric or complementary&quot;: This axiom focuses on metacommunication with two main components called symmetrical interchange and complementary interchange. Symmetrical interchange is an interaction based on equal power between communicators. In accordance to that, complementary interchange is an interaction based on differences in power. Within these two interchanges there are three different ways they can be used: one-up, one-down, and one-across. With a one-up communication, one communicator attempts to gain control of an exchange by dominating the overall communication. A one-down communication has the opposite effect. A communicator attempts to yield control of an interaction or submit to someone. The final message is a one-across communication. This communication moves to neutralize a situation. This is also called transitory if only one communicator is attempting this style. When two communicators use the same style of one-up, one-down, or one-across, it is symmetrical. If they are opposing one another it is complementary. This axiom allows us to understand how an interaction can be perceived by the styles a communicator is using.

=== Additional notions ===
Some interrelated notions that make up the Interactional View promoted by Watzlawick and colleagues at the MRI include:
* One cannot not communicate, and the related idea that one cannot not influence;
* Understanding behavior as if we are constantly exchanging messages defining the nature of relationships of which we are a part;
* Shifting focus of attention from intent to the effects of behavior as communication;
* Observer-imposed punctuation;
* Emphasizing the vital role of the therapist&#x27;s preconceptions in bringing forth socially constructed reality;
* Investing the ramifications of self-fulfilling prophecy; and
* Articulating and fully embracing the &quot;as If&quot; nature of behavior.

A term that is used often in the theory of the Interactional View is &quot;enabler&quot;. An enabler is within addiction culture; a person whose non-assertive behavior allows others to continue in their substance abuse. An example of this would be a person letting their sibling continue to act in an immature manner because that is what the family is used to him doing.

Another word frequently used in the Interactional View is &quot;double-bind&quot;. Someone in a double-bind, is a person trapped by expectations; the powerful party requests that the low-power party act symmetrically. An example of this would be a person asking another person, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you like the movie?&quot; or &quot;You like rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, don&#x27;t you?&quot; The first person is asking the second person to act in a way that is similar (symmetrical) to them.

== Publications ==

== Legacy ==
Paul Watzlawick theory had great impact on the creation of the four-sides model by Friedemann Schulz von Thun.

Michel Weber argues for a cross-elucidation and reinforcement between the worldviews of Alfred North Whitehead and Watzlawick in his paper &quot;The Art of Epochal Change&quot;.

<text>The Lwów school of mathematics () was a group of Polish mathematicians who worked in the interwar period in Lwów, Poland (since 1945 Lviv, Ukraine). The mathematicians often met at the famous Scottish Café to discuss mathematical problems, and published in the journal &quot;Studia Mathematica&quot;, founded in 1929. The school was renowned for its productivity and its extensive contributions to subjects such as point-set topology, set theory and functional analysis. 

==Members==
Notable members of the Lwów school of mathematics included:

* Stefan Banach
* Feliks Barański
* Władysław Orlicz
* Stanisław Saks
* Hugo Steinhaus
* Stanisław Mazur
* Stanisław Ulam
* Józef Schreier
* Juliusz Schauder
* Mark Kac
* Antoni Łomnicki
* Stefan Kaczmarz
* Herman Auerbach
* Włodzimierz Stożek
* Stanisław Ruziewicz
* Eustachy Żyliński
The biographies and contributions of these mathematicians were documented in 1980 by their contemporary, Kazimierz Kuratowski in his book &quot;A Half Century of Polish Mathematics: Remembrances and Reflections&quot;.

==The end of the school==
Many of the mathematicians, especially those of Jewish background, fled this southeastern part of Poland in 1941 when it became clear that it would be invaded by Germany. Few of the mathematicians survived World War II, but after the war a group including some of the original community carried on their work in western Poland&#x27;s Wrocław, the successor city to prewar Lwów; see Polish population transfers (1944–1946). A number of the prewar mathematicians, prominent among them Stanisław Ulam, became famous for work done in the United States.

<doc id="1024337" wikidata="Q1549428" url="?curid=1024337" title="Steatorrhea">
<text>Steatorrhea (or steatorrhoea) is the presence of excess fat in feces. Stools may be bulky and difficult to flush, have a pale and oily appearance, and can be especially foul-smelling. An oily anal leakage or some level of fecal incontinence may occur. There is increased fat excretion, which can be measured by determining the fecal fat level.

==Causes==
Impaired digestion or absorption can result in fatty stools.
Possible causes include exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, with poor digestion from lack of lipases, loss of bile salts, which reduces micelle formation, and small intestinal disease-producing malabsorption. Various other causes include certain medicines that block fat absorption or indigestible or excess oil/fat in diet.

The absence of bile secretion can cause the feces to turn gray or pale. Bile is responsible for the brownish color of feces. In addition to this, bile also plays a role in fat absorption, where dietary lipids are combined so that pancreatic lipases can hydrolyze them before going towards the small intestine. Without bile acids, this pathway would have a hard time occurring, which would lead to fat malabsorption and make steatorrhea more probable to occur. Other features of fat malabsorption may also occur such as reduced bone density, difficulty with vision under low light levels, bleeding, bruising, and slow blood clotting times.

===Associated diseases===
* Conditions affecting the pancreas. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency can be caused by chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis and pancreatic cancer (if it obstructs biliary outflow).
* Conditions affecting bile salts. Obstruction of the bile ducts by gallstones (choledocholithiasis), primary sclerosing cholangitis, liver damage (hepatitis, intrahepatic cholestasis), hypolipidemic drugs, or changes following gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy).
* Conditions producing intestinal malabsorption. These include celiac disease, bacterial overgrowth, tropical sprue, giardiasis (a protozoan parasite infection), Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, short bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease and abetalipoproteinemia.
* Other causes: Drugs that can produce steatorrhea include orlistat, a slimming pill, or as adverse effect of octreotide or lanreotide, used to treat acromegaly or other neuroendocrine tumors. It can be found in Graves&#x27; disease / hyperthyroidism.

===Medications===
Orlistat (also known by trade names Xenical and Alli) is a diet pill that works by blocking the enzymes that digest fat. As a result, some fat cannot be absorbed from the gut and is excreted in the feces instead of being metabolically digested and absorbed, sometimes causing oily anal leakage. Vytorin (ezetimibe/simvastatin) tablets can cause steatorrhea in some people.

===Excess whole nuts in diet===
Some studies have shown that stool lipids are increased when whole nuts are eaten, compared to nut butters, oils or flour and that lipids from whole nuts are significantly less well absorbed.

===Natural fats===
Consuming jojoba oil has been documented to cause steatorrhea and anal leakage because it is indigestible.

Consuming escolar and oilfish (sometimes mislabelled as butterfish) will often cause steatorrhea, also referred to as gempylotoxism or gempylid fish poisoning or keriorrhea.

===Artificial fats===
The fat substitute Olestra, used to reduce digestible fat in some foods, was reported to cause leakage in some consumers during the test-marketing phase. As a result, the product was reformulated before general release to a hydrogenated form that is not liquid at physiologic temperature. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warning indicated excessive consumption of Olestra could result in &quot;loose stools&quot;; however, this warning has not been required since 2003.

==Diagnosis==
Steatorrhea should be suspected when the stools are bulky, floating and foul-smelling. Specific tests are needed to confirm that these properties are in fact due to excessive levels of fat. Fats in feces can be measured over a defined time (often five days). Other tests include the (13)C-mixed triglycerides test and fecal elastase, to detect possible fat maldigestion due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, or various specific tests to detect other causes of malabsorption such as celiac disease.

==Treatment==
Treatments are mainly correction of the underlying cause, as well as digestive enzyme supplements.

<text>Mir Emad (born Emad al-Molk Qazvini Hasani (),‎ 1554 – August 15, 1615) is perhaps the most celebrated Persian calligrapher. He was born in Qazvin, Iran. It is believed that the Nastaʿlīq style reached its highest elegance in Mir Emad&#x27;s works. These are considered amongst the finest specimens of Nastaʿlīq calligraphy and are kept in several museums in the world.

== Early life and education ==
Mir Emad was born in Qazvin, where he had his early education. Mir Emad&#x27;s family had librarian and accountant positions in Safavid court. He was trained in calligraphy at first by Isa Rangkar and then Malek Deylami. Mir Emad later on moved to Tabriz to study with Mohammad Hossein Tabrizi. Afterward, he traveled to Ottoman Turkey, Baghdad, Halab and Hijaz. He returned to Semnan and worked as a scribe in Shah Abbas&#x27;s library and later on his court in the capital of Isfahan.

== Rivalry with Ali Reza Abbasi ==
In Shah Abbas&#x27;s court, Mir Emad was not the only calligrapher. Ali Reza Abbasi Tabrizi, another famous calligrapher, was also under Shah&#x27;s patronage. Ali Reza Abbasi&#x27;s was also a pupil of Mohammad Hossein Tabrizi (Mir Emad&#x27;s teacher) and later on became Mir Emad&#x27;s opponent.

== Death ==
Mir Emad was later accused of being Sunni, a branch of Islam which was not tolerated under Safavids and implicitly sentenced to death by Shah Abbas. In a night, on his way to Hamam, Mir Emad was assassinated by Masud Beik Mesgar Qazvini and for several days no one dared to bury his corpse. Finally his pupil, Abu Torab Khattat Esfahani, buried him in Maghsoudbeyk mosque. He was not allowed to build a mausoleum for Mir Emad.

== Works and legacy ==
&quot;Adab al-Masq&quot;, a dissertation on penmanship, is attributed to Mir Emad. Goharshad, Mir Emad&#x27;s daughter, was also an adept calligrapher. So was her husband, Mir Mohammad Ali and her sons Mir Rashid, Mir Abd al-Razzaq and Mir Yahya. Mir Emad&#x27;s son, Mirza Ebrahim, is also known to be a calligrapher. So is Mohammad Amin, Mirza Ebrahim&#x27;s son.

<text>Islamic calligraphy is the artistic practice of penmanship and calligraphy, in the languages which use Arabic alphabet or the alphabets derived from it. It is a highly stylized and structured form of handwriting that follows artistic conventions and is often used for Islamic religious texts, architecture, and decoration. It includes Arabic, Persian, Ottoman, and Urdu calligraphy. It is known in Arabic as (), literally meaning &#x27;line&#x27;, &#x27;design&#x27;, or &#x27;construction&#x27;.

The development of Islamic calligraphy is strongly tied to the Qur&#x27;an, as chapters and verses from the Qur&#x27;an are a common and almost universal text upon which Islamic calligraphy is based. Although artistic depictions of people and animals are not explicitly forbidden in the Qur&#x27;an, Islamic traditions have often limited figural representation in Islamic religious texts in order to avoid idolatry. Some scholars argue that Kufic script was developed by the late 7th century in Kufa, Iraq, from which it takes its name. This early style later evolved into several forms, including floral, foliated, plaited or interlaced, bordered, and square Kufic. In the ancient world, though, artists sometimes circumvented aniconic prohibitions by creating intricate calligraphic compositions that formed shapes and figures using tiny script. Calligraphy was a valued art form, and was regarded as both an aesthetic and moral pursuit. An ancient Arabic proverb illustrates this point by emphatically stating that &quot;Purity of writing is purity of the soul.&quot;

Beyond religious contexts, Islamic calligraphy is widely used in secular art, architecture, and decoration. Its prominence in Islamic art is not solely due to religious constraints on figurative imagery, but rather reflects the central role of writing and the written word in Islamic culture. Islamic calligraphy evolved primarily from two major styles: Kufic and Naskh, with numerous regional and stylistic variations. In the modern era, Arabic and Persian calligraphy have influenced modern art, particularly in the post-colonial Middle East, and have also inspired the fusion style known as calligraffiti.

==Instruments and media==
The traditional instrument of the Islamic calligrapher is the qalam, a pen normally made of dried reed or bamboo. The ink is often in colour and chosen so that its intensity can vary greatly, creating dynamism and movement in the letter forms. Some styles are often written using a metallic-tip pen.

Islamic calligraphy can be applied to a wide range of decorative mediums other than paper, such as tiles, vessels, carpets, and stone. Before the advent of paper, papyrus and parchment were used for writing. During the 9th century, an influx of paper from China revolutionized calligraphy. Libraries in the Muslim world regularly contained hundreds and even thousands of books.

For centuries, the art of writing has fulfilled a central iconographic function in Islamic art. Although the academic tradition of Islamic calligraphy began in Baghdad, the centre of the Islamic empire during much of its early history, it eventually spread as far as India and Spain.

Coins were another support for calligraphy. Beginning in 692, the Islamic caliphate reformed the coinage of the Near East by replacing Byzantine Christian imagery with Islamic phrases inscribed in Arabic. This was especially true for dinars, or gold coins of high value. Generally, the coins were inscribed with quotes from the Qur&#x27;an.

By the tenth century, the Persians, who had converted to Islam, began weaving inscriptions onto elaborately patterned silks. So precious were textiles featuring Arabic text that Crusaders brought them to Europe as prized possessions. A notable example is the Suaire de Saint-Josse, used to wrap the bones of St. Josse in the Abbey of St. Josse-sur-Mer, near Caen in north-western France.

As Islamic calligraphy is highly venerated, most works follow examples set by well-established calligraphers, with the exception of secular or contemporary works. In the Islamic tradition, calligraphers underwent extensive training in three stages, including the study of their teacher&#x27;s models, in order to be granted certification.

==Styles==

=== Kufic ===
The Kufic style emphasizes rigid and angular strokes, it developed alongside the Naskh script in the 7th century. Although some scholars dispute this, Kufic script was supposedly developed around the end of the 7th century in Kufa, Iraq, from which it takes its name. The style later developed into several varieties, including floral, foliated, plaited or interlaced, bordered, and square kufic. Due to its straight and orderly style of lettering, Kufic was frequently used in ornamental stone carving as well as on coins. It was the main script used to copy the Qur&#x27;an from the 8th to 10th century and went out of general use in the 12th century when the flowing naskh style become more practical. However, it continued to be used as a decorative element to contrast superseding styles.

There was no set rules of using the Kufic script; the only common feature is the angular, linear shapes of the characters. Due to the lack of standardization of early Kufic, the script differs widely between regions, ranging from very square and rigid forms to flowery and decorative ones.

Common varieties include square Kufic, a technique known as &quot;banna&#x27;i&quot;. Contemporary calligraphy using this style is also popular in modern decorations.

Decorative Kufic inscriptions are often imitated into pseudo-kufics in Middle age and Renaissance Europe. Pseudo-kufics is especially common in Renaissance depictions of people from the Holy Land. The exact reason for the incorporation of pseudo-Kufic is unclear. It seems that Westerners mistakenly associated 13th-14th century Middle Eastern scripts with systems of writing used during the time of Jesus, and thus found it natural to represent early Christians in association with them.

===Naskh===
The use of cursive scripts coexisted with Kufic, and historically cursive was commonly used for informal purposes. Naskh first appeared within the first century of the Islamic calendar. Naskh translates to &quot;copying&quot;, as it became the standard for transcribing books and manuscripts. The script is the most ubiquitous among other styles, used in the Qur&#x27;an, official decrees, and private correspondence. It became the basis of modern Arabic print.

Kufic is commonly believed to predate naskh, but historians have traced the two scripts as coexisting long before their codification by ibn Muqla, as the two served different purposes. Kufi was used primarily in decoration, while Naskh served for everyday scribal use.

=== Thuluth ===
Thuluth was developed during the 15th century and slowly refined by Ottoman Calligraphers including Mustafa Râkim, Shaykh Hamdallah, and others, till it became what it is today. Letters in this script have long vertical lines with broad spacing. The name, meaning &quot;one third&quot;, may possibly be a reference to the x-height, which is one-third of the &#x27;alif, or to the fact that the pen used to write the vowels and ornaments is one third the width of that used in writing the letters.

=== Reqāʿ ===

Reqāʿ is a handwriting style similar to thuluth. It first appeared in the 10th century. The shape is simple with short strokes and small flourishes. Yaqut al-Musta&#x27;simi was one of the calligraphers who employed this style. The Arab, Ibn al-Bawwab is actually believed to have created this script.

=== Muhaqqaq ===

Muhaqqaq is a majestic style used by accomplished calligraphers, and is a variation of thuluth. Along with thuluth, it was considered one of the most beautiful scripts, as well as one of the most difficult to execute. Muhaqqaq was commonly used during the Mamluk era, but its use became largely restricted to short phrases, such as the basmallah, from the 18th century onward.

===Regional styles===

With the spread of Islam, the Arabic script was established in a vast geographic area with many regions developing their own unique style. From the 14th century onward, other cursive styles began to develop in Turkey, Persia, and China.

# Maghrebi scripts developed from Kufic letters in the Maghreb (North Africa) and al-Andalus (Iberia), Maghrebi scripts are traditionally written with a pointed tip (القلم المذبب), producing a line of even thickness. Within the Maghrebi family, there are different styles including the cursive &quot;mujawher&quot; and the ceremonial &quot;mabsut.&quot;
## Sudani scripts developed in &quot;Biled as-Sudan&quot; (the West African Sahel) and can be considered a subcategory of Maghrebi scripts
# Diwani is a cursive style of Arabic calligraphy developed during the reign of the early Ottoman Turks in the 16th and early 17th centuries. It was invented by Housam Roumi, and reached its height of popularity under Süleyman I the Magnificent (1520–1566). Spaces between letters are often narrow, and lines ascend upwards from right to left. Larger variations called &quot;djali&quot; are filled with dense decorations of dots and diacritical marks in the space between, giving it a compact appearance. Diwani is difficult to read and write due to its heavy stylization and became the ideal script for writing court documents as it ensured confidentiality and prevented forgery.
# Nasta&#x27;liq is a cursive style originally devised to write the Persian language for literary and non-Qur&#x27;anic works. Nasta&#x27;liq is thought to be a later development of the naskh and the earlier ta&#x27;liq script used in Iran. Quite rapidly gaining popularity as a script in South Asia. The name &quot;ta&#x27;liq&quot; means &quot;hanging&quot;, and refers to the slightly sloped quality of lines of text in this script. Letters have short vertical strokes with broad and sweeping horizontal strokes. The shapes are deep, hook-like, and have high contrast. A variant called &quot;Shikasteh&quot; was developed in the 17th century for more formal contexts.
# Sini is a style developed in China. The shape is greatly influenced by Chinese calligraphy, using a horsehair brush instead of the standard reed pen. A famous modern calligrapher in this tradition is Hajji Noor Deen Mi Guangjiang.&quot;&#x27;

===Modern===
In the post-colonial era, artists working in North Africa and the Middle East transformed Arabic calligraphy into a modern art movement, known as the &quot;Hurufiyya movement&quot;. Artists working in this style use calligraphy as a graphic element within contemporary artwork.

The term, &quot;hurufiyya&quot; is derived from the Arabic term, &quot;harf&quot; for letter. Traditionally, the term was charged with Sufi intellectual and esoteric meaning. It is an explicit reference to a medieval system of teaching involving political theology and lettrism. In this theology, letters were seen as primordial signifiers and manipulators of the cosmos.

Hurufiyya artists blended Western art concepts with an artistic identity and sensibility drawn from their own culture and heritage. These artists integrated Islamic visual traditions, especially calligraphy, and elements of modern art into syncretic contemporary compositions. Although hurufiyyah artists struggled to find their own individual dialogue within the context of nationalism, they also worked towards an aesthetic that transcended national boundaries and represented a broader affiliation with an Islamic identity.

The hurufiyya artistic style as a movement most likely began in North Africa with the work of Ibrahim el-Salahi. However, the use of calligraphy in modern artworks appears to have emerged independently in various Islamic states. Artists working in this were often unaware of other hurufiyya artists&#x27;s works, allowing for different manifestations of the style to emerge in different regions. In Sudan, for instance, artworks include both Islamic calligraphy and West African motifs.

The hurufiyya art movement was not confined to painters and included artists working in a variety of media. One example is the Jordanian ceramicist, Mahmoud Taha who combined the traditional aesthetics of calligraphy with skilled craftsmanship. Although not affiliated with the hurufiyya movement, the contemporary artist Shirin Neshat integrates Arabic text into her black-and-white photography, creating contrast and duality. In Iraq, the movement was known as &quot;Al Bu&#x27;d al Wahad&quot; (or the One Dimension Group)&quot;, and in Iran, it was known as the Saqqa-Khaneh movement.

Western art has influenced Arabic calligraphy in other ways, with forms such as calligraffiti, which is the use of calligraphy in public art to make politico-social messages or to ornament public buildings and spaces. Notable Islamic calligraffiti artists include: Yazan Halwani active in Lebanon, el Seed working in France and Tunisia, and Caiand A1one in Tehran.

In 2017 the Sultanate of Oman unveiled the &quot;Mushaf Muscat&quot;, an interactive calligraphic Quran following supervision and support from the Omani Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs, a voting member of the Unicode Consortium.

<text>Corsham is a historic market town and civil parish in west Wiltshire, England. It is at the southwestern edge of the Cotswolds, just off the A4 national route. It is southwest of Swindon, east of Bristol, north-east of Bath, and southwest of Chippenham.

Historically, Corsham was a centre for agriculture and later, the wool industry, and remains a focus for quarrying Bath Stone. It has several notable historic buildings, including the stately home of Corsham Court. During the Second World War and the Cold War, it became a major administrative and manufacturing centre for the Ministry of Defence, with numerous establishments both above ground and in disused quarry and mine tunnels.

The parish includes the villages of Gastard and Neston, which is at the gates of the Neston Park estate.

==History==
Corsham appears to derive its name from &quot;Cosa&#x27;s hām&quot;, &quot;ham&quot; being Old English for homestead, or village. The town is referred in the Domesday book as &quot;Cosseham&quot;. The letter &#x27;R&#x27; appears to have entered the name later under Norman influence (possibly caused by the recording of local pronunciation), when the town is reported to have been in the possession of the Earl of Cornwall. Corsham is recorded as &quot;Cosham&quot; as late as 1611 (on John Speed&#x27;s map of Wiltshire). During the Saxon era, the Corsham area belonged to the King, and had a large forest, which was later cleared to make way for further agricultural expansion.

There is evidence that the town had been known as &quot;Corsham Regis&quot; due to its reputed association with Anglo-Saxon Ethelred of Wessex, and the name remains as that of a primary school.

One of the towns that prospered greatly from Wiltshire&#x27;s wool trade in medieval times, it maintained its prosperity after the decline of the trade through the quarrying of Bath stone, with underground mining works extending to the south and west of Corsham. The main turnpike road (now the A4) from London to Bristol passed through the town.

Numbers 94 to 112 of the High Street are Grade II* listed buildings known as the &quot;Flemish Weavers Houses&quot;. However, there is little cogent evidence to support that name and it appears more likely to derive from a handful of Dutch workers who arrived in the 17th century. The Grove, opposite the High Street, is a typical example of classic Georgian architecture, as is The Ivy in Priory Street. There are more than 60 listed buildings in the High Street.

==Features==

Corsham&#x27;s small town centre includes the historic High Street and the Martingate Centre, a late 20th-century retail development.

The stately home of Corsham Court can also be found in the town centre. Standing on a former Saxon Royal Manor, it is based on an Elizabethan manor home from 1582. Since 1745, it has been part of the Methuen estate. The house has an extensive collection of Old Masters, rooms furnished by Robert Adam and Thomas Chippendale, and parks landscaped by Capability Brown and Humphry Repton. The house is open to the public all year round, excluding December, and is famed locally for its peacocks, which also wander about the streets. 

Sir Edward Hungerford, the owner of Corsham Court in the mid-seventeenth century, was the commander of the Parliamentarian New Model Army in Wiltshire, and his wife, Lady Margaret Hungerford, built what came to be known as the Hungerford Almshouses in the centre of town.

==Community==
The Pound is an arts venue and community hub for north Wiltshire, run by the Pound Arts Trust and supported by Arts Council England, Wiltshire Council, South Gloucestershire Council and Corsham Town Council. Their Rural Touring Scheme take performances to villages in Wiltshire and South Gloucestershire.

Pound Arts also organises two annual festivals: the Blue Sky Festival in June, for various art forms including music and comedy; and the Magic and Mayhem Festival in November, featuring magic, burlesque, music hall and other decadent arts.

==Parish==

===Gastard===
The village of Gastard was a settlement by the 12th century. It has a 20th-century church.

===Neston===
Neston village was established around Neston Park, a country estate whose house was built c.1790. Neston Park is home of the Fuller family, who give their name to the Fuller, Smith and Turner brewery in London, known for &quot;Fuller&#x27;s London Pride&quot; cask ale.

===Pickwick===
Pickwick was once a separate settlement and now forms the north-western part of the town. The name derives from Anglo-Saxon &quot;pic&quot; (meaning a peak or pointed hill) and &quot;wic&quot; (village). The Wiltshire Hundred Roll of 1273 refers to a &quot;William de Pikewicke&quot;.

Corsham was the inspiration for Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;; it is thought that he borrowed the name from Moses Pickwick, a coachman who was born in Pickwick, lived in the &quot;Hare and Hounds&quot; inn, and ran coaches between Bath and London.

===Other settlements===
North of the A4, besides Pickwick, are the hamlets of Middlewick, Upper Pickwick and Cross Keys.

Settlements now within Corsham&#x27;s built-up area are Hudswell, Leafield, Westwells with Moor Green and Neston further south. In the east of the parish are Easton, Thingley and Westrop, and in the southeast Chapel Knapp, Gastard, Monk&#x27;s Park, The Linleys and The Ridge.

==Notable buildings==
Pickwick Manor, on the Bath Road, was noted by architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner as an &quot;unusually impressive example of a late 17th century manor house&quot;, having remnants of a 14th-century wing. More recently, the Grade II* listed house has been the residence of architect Harold Brakspear and his descendants.

Beechfield is a late Georgian house in Middlewick Lane, just north of the town. It was extended in the early 1970s to provide additional accommodation. The house was split into residential accommodation while part of the grounds were split off in 2002 under the auspices of the Town Council to provide a nature area where local flora and fauna can be seen. Nearby, Guyers House is a 17th-century house, now a hotel and restaurant.

Middlewick House, just outside the town, was occupied by Camilla Parker Bowles (later Queen Camilla) and her first husband between 1986 and 1995, when it was bought by Nick Mason of Pink Floyd. Further to the north, Hartham Park is a Georgian estate that includes a rare stické court. Rudloe Manor, a 17th-century Grade II* listed manor house, is off the Bath Road west of the town, just outside Corsham parish.

==Governance==
For Westminster elections, Corsham is within the Chippenham constituency, which has been represented since the 2024 general election by Sarah Gibson for the Liberal Democrats.

When the Local Government Act 1972 came into force on 1 January 1974, Corsham came within the areas of Wiltshire County Council and North Wiltshire District Council, electing one county councillor and three district councillors from the Corsham and Lacock division. On 1 April 2009, Wiltshire became a unitary authority managed by Wiltshire Council and the county&#x27;s district councils were all merged into this body. From 2009, voters in the area elect three councillors to the unitary authority, one from each of three single-member electoral divisions: Corsham Ladbrook, Corsham Pickwick, and Corsham Without (which extends to neighbouring Lacock, part of Box, and the rural area south and east of the town).

Corsham&#x27;s first tier of government is Corsham Town Council, which was created as a parish council in 1895. Although Corsham never had its own town charter, in 2000 it became a town council. There are currently twenty councillors.
==Population and demography==
The first official census of 1801 showed Corsham having 2,402 inhabitants, while that of 2011 recorded exactly 13,000. The increase shown for 1840 is due to the influx of stone workers and the arrival of the Great Western Railway. No census was taken in 1941 due to the Second World War, but the jump in population (from 3,754 in 1931 to 9,268 in 1951, an increase of 147%) is attributable to the influx of military personnel.

The 2001 census demographics of the SN13 postcode area, of which Corsham comprises the major part, did not differ markedly from national figures; the unemployment rate was 2.0 per cent compared to a national 3.2 per cent, and there was a marginally higher rate of retirees (at 23.3 per cent as against 22 per cent). 23 per cent of adults are educated to degree level, against a national average of 20 per cent.
==Education==
Corsham has four primary schools, an independent preparatory school and a large secondary school. The primary schools, catering for students up to age 11, are:

* Corsham Primary School, split between Pound Pill and Broadwood Avenue, was formed from Lady Methuen&#x27;s School for Girls (founded 1816), the National School for Girls (c.1840s) and Corsham British School for Boys (c.1840). These schools came under the aegis of the Corsham School Board in 1893 and were finally merged in 1923. It now provides for about 680 pupils.
* Corsham Regis Primary Academy, Kings Avenue, opened in 1943 for the children of incoming military workers. It became a junior school in 1955 when older children transferred to the Corsham Secondary Modern School, and now has about 150 pupils.
* Neston Primary School, Church Rise, Neston, was founded in 1861 as Corshamside School. It now provides for about 200 pupils.
* St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, Lacock Road, opened in 1966 and is a voluntary aided school with about 190 pupils.

Two schools outside the parish take pupils from Corsham: Box CE (VC) Primary School and Shaw CE Primary School.

The Corsham School, The Tynings, is Corsham&#x27;s only secondary school; it was opened in 1972 as a comprehensive and is now a large academy with a sixth form. In July 2024 the school had 1,264 pupils.

Heywood Prep School, Priory Street, is an independent school providing education from ages 2 to 11, and has about 260 pupils. It is located on two acres of property in the centre of Corsham, near Corsham Court, on a site first mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as a priory donated to an order of monks. The Grade II Georgian building in Bath stone is from 1776; later additions include a barn, used as a dining room and later a science block, and a multi-functional performance hall. The school is part of the Wishford Schools group.

A school was first endowed in Corsham by Lady Margaret Hungerford, in 1668 as part of the almshouses. A new schoolroom was built on the south side of Lacock Road by lord of the manor, Paul Cobb Methuen in 1816. The building, which is Grade II listed, is still standing and is used as a further education centre by Wiltshire College.

== Churches ==
=== Former priory ===
Corsham Priory was referred to in 1336 as having been given to Marmoutier Abbey during the time of Henry I (1068–1135) as an alien priory. An unnamed prior was referred to in 1201, but the priory had become inactive by 1294 and its lands passed to The Crown and eventually to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Later a Georgian house was built on the site, which is now part of Heywood Prep School.

===Anglican churches===
The town of Corsham and surrounding villages are within the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Bristol. The churches are served by the Corsham &amp; Lacock Churches team ministry, which extends east to St Cyriac&#x27;s, Lacock and St Anne&#x27;s, Bowden Hill.

==== Church of St Bartholomew ====

The main parish Church of St Bartholomew, which stands between the High Street and Corsham Court, is partly built on Saxon foundations. The present church has 12th-century origins but underwent major Victorian restoration in 1875–1878 by G.E. Street.

Pevsner writes: &quot;A large church with a commanding S tower with spire. It looks as if it were all built for the great house and the estate in the days of Victorian prosperity. In fact Street only restored an old church, but he did it unfortunately thoroughly, and he added the tower.&quot;

Street&#x27;s tower replaced an earlier central tower. Around the same time the chancel was restored by C.F. Hansom, who also added a north chapel for the Methuen family. The north aisle remains from the early 14th century, and the south aisle from later in that century; the nave has Norman arcades and a 15th-century roof. In 1960 the church was designated as Grade I listed.

In the north chancel chapel, the large altar tomb of 15th-century landowner Thomas Tropenell is shared with his first wife, Agnes.

==== Outlying churches ====
The Church of St Philip and St James at Neston was opened in 1866. Its architecture is early English, in local stone to designs of J.H. Hakewill. Internal re-ordering was completed in 1985.

The Church of St. John the Baptist at Gastard was built in 1912 in the gothic style.

===Roman Catholic===
St. Patrick&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church was opened in 1945, replacing temporary centres which had been arranged for the wartime population influx.
The building is the former Pickwick school, opened in 1858 on land gifted in 1846 by Lord Methuen and his tenants, Sir Gabriel Goldney and Arthur Knapp; the architect was Henry Goodridge of Bath. The school closed in 1922 and the building was used for a time as a glove factory, then as a gas mask factory.

===Monk&#x27;s Chapel===

Monk&#x27;s Chapel, built near Gastard in 1662, was formerly a Quaker meeting-house and was transferred to the Congregational church in 1690. The chapel is a Grade I listed building and continues in use as of 2016.

===Other free churches===
The Baptist Chapel, Moor Green, was founded in 1833. Ebenezer Baptist Chapel, Velly, was founded in 1857.

The Congregational Church, Pickwick Road, originally met in a malthouse, and a new building was commenced in 1790. In 1971 it closed and is now used as offices.

Ebenezer Chapel, Priory Street, was formed in 1822/3 when some members of the Congregational Church split over doctrine. The present building opened in 1829 and has been extended since then. As of 2016, the building is still in use, as Corsham Baptist Church. Zion Hill Baptist Chapel was built in 1859 by a group who separated from the Priory Street chapel.

The Particular Baptist Chapel, Pound Pill, dates back to about 1824. The Brethren met in several locations, beginning in the mid nineteenth century at Pockeridge Lodge, moving to Neston, while another group met in Pickwick. By 1903, both were meeting in Neston and in 1925 they bought the Primitive Methodist Chapel, Station Road.

A large Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built on Pickwick Road in 1903. In 1984 the congregation was joined by the nearby Congregational church (which by then was part of the United Reformed Church) to form the United Church of St Aldhelm. In 2016 the church continues in use.

==Transport==
Corsham is connected to Bradford on Avon by the B3109 road, to Melksham by the B3353, and to Chippenham and Bath by the A4 Bath Road, a former turnpike from London to Bristol. Junction 17 of the M4 motorway is about 8 miles (12 km) from Corsham. Bus company Faresaver operate local services, as well as buses to nearby towns (including the twice-per-hour X31 between Bath and Chippenham).

The Great Western Main Line railway from London to Bristol, Exeter and Penzance passes through the town, though Corsham station closed in 1965. Proposals to reopen the station have been put forward since at least 2009, and, in 2021, a feasibility study was approved by the Department for Transport.

Nearby stations, and most passenger trains, are operated by Great Western Railway. Some local services call at the nearest station at Melksham, away, but Chippenham station, away, offers frequent express services and connections.

The eastern portal of Box Tunnel, the longest railway tunnel of its time, built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel for the Great Western Railway, is at Hudswell on the western edge of the town. Corsham Railway Cutting carries the main line westward through Corsham to Box Tunnel. In 1971, of land in the cutting were designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest for its notable geology.
==Town twinning==
Corsham has had a twinning relationship with the town of Jargeau, France since 1981, and has an active twinning association. Corsham holds an annual twinning event in which musical and charity events occur, accompanied by French food and wines. There is also a boules competition for the Peter Henderson trophy which is named in memory of a local doctor and former chairman of the twinning association. As part of the 2008 event, a mock Storming of the Bastille was staged to celebrate Bastille Day, Corsham Town Hall standing in for the Parisian prison.

==Economy==

===Defence===
The Ministry of Defence has operated a number of locations in the vicinity of Corsham since the First World War and employs approximately 2,000 people. Several defence sites in the Corsham area are located underground and were formed from historic Bath Stone quarries. The largest of the above-ground sites are centred around the Hawthorn area of Corsham.

====Basil Hill site====

The Basil Hill site is in Westwells Road and comprises the former Basil Hill Barracks; the site is now designated MOD Corsham and accommodates approximately 2,100 people. It is home to UK Strategic Command&#x27;s Defence Digital organisation and also houses the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s Global Operations Security Control Centre, amongst other units.

====Rudloe site====
The Rudloe site, bordering Westwells Road and Bradford Road, was one of three sites that comprised RAF Rudloe Manor. Rudloe Manor was established during the Second World War as a non-flying station for administrative and command &amp; control purposes. It was home to HQ Number 10 Fighter Group, RAF Regional Command, Headquarters RAF Police &amp; Security Services, No 1 Signals Unit, Controller Defence Communications Network and 1001 Signals Unit. The main site also served as the primary entrance for the Central Government War Headquarters, variously known as &quot;Turnstile&quot;, &quot;Stockwell&quot;, &quot;Subterfuge&quot; and &quot;Burlington&quot;.

By 1998 it had become mostly administrative, housing the RAF Provost and Security Services, which dealt with security and criminal investigation. The sites were taken over by the Defence Communication Services Agency in about 2000, while the detachment of 1001 Signals Unit of the RAF remained at the Hawthorn site until its privatisation. RAF Rudloe Manor was then absorbed into Joint Support Unit Corsham.

====Hawthorn site====
Hawthorn site, on Skynet Drive, previously accommodated the RAF 1001 Signal Unit detachment of RAF Rudloe Manor. The site supports the Skynet military communications satellite constellations, which is now managed by Astrium Services under a PFI arrangement.

====Copenacre site====
The Copenacre site, off the A4 Bath Road about west of Corsham, was originally an underground stone quarry below land formerly part of the Hartham estate; this was taken over by the Ministry of Defence in 1937 and became the Royal Naval Stores Depot, Copenacre. The underground stores closed on 30 September 1995. The site closed completely in January 2011 and was sold. In 2016 demolition started to redevelop the brownfield site into housing. Two original mine structures remain incorporated into the development, one being a shaft entrance.

====Other units====
The Joint Support Unit provides administrative support and facilities management for all three locations. In 2006 a Private Finance Initiative contract was let to Inteq for the renewal and expansion of the Basil Hill and Rudloe Site facilities, valued at around £800m.

Corsham Computer Centre is a Royal Navy data processing facility.

The Services Cotswold Centre in Neston is a welfare centre offering temporary accommodation for services families who require it. The centre has 63 family units, a medical centre and other amenities.

HMS Royal Arthur was a training establishment between 1947 and 1993.

A number of defence-related contractors are co-located or in the vicinity of the MoD sites, such as Chemring Energetics UK Limited and Serco Defence, Science and Technology.

===Quarries===

Underground extraction of Bath Stone continues in Corsham on a smaller scale than previously. Hanson plc operates Hartham Park Quarry in the Hudswell district, south-west of Pickwick, and Monk&#x27;s Park Quarry near Gastard.

Disused quarries have been redeployed for other purposes; apart from defence usage, there is a wine storage facility at Eastlays, near Gastard run by Octavian Vaults, and storage of magnetic media for off-site data protection at Neston.

===Film and television===
Another use for the quarries is the film industry. Underground scenes from the first episode of &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; were filmed at Eastlays, and disused tunnels form part of the studio complex of Corsham Media Park, a specialist business park that opened in 2001 adjacent to RAF Rudloe Manor.

Period drama location filming occurs in Corsham, as in neighbouring Lacock and Atworth parishes. Neston Park hosted major outdoor film sets for the 2008 BBC television adaption of &quot;Lark Rise to Candleford&quot;, and the BBC also filmed scenes for a 2008 version of &quot;Tess of the D&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; in Church Street and Corsham Court grounds.

Corsham Court has also been used as a period location in productions such as &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; (1975), &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; (1993), &quot;A Respectable Trade&quot; (1997) and &quot;Wives and Daughters&quot; (1999).

In 2014, scenes for the new adaptation of &quot;Poldark &quot;were filmed in the town&#x27;s High Street, meaning Corsham then featured in every series until the drama ended in 2019.&quot;

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals is received from the Mendip and the local relay transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Wiltshire on 104.3 FM, Heart West on 102.2 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South West on 107.5 FM, and Kik Radio, a community radio station that broadcast online.

The local newspapers are the Gazette and Herald and Wiltshire Times.

<text>Heinz Georg Kramm (born 13 December 1938), known professionally as Heino, is a German singer of Schlager and traditional Volksmusik. Having sold a total of over 50 million records, he is one of the most successful German musicians of all time.

Heino is known for his baritone voice and trademark combination of light blond hair and dark sunglasses (which he wears due to exophthalmos). He lives in the town of Bad Münstereifel, where he owned a café until June 2012. His interest in music started at age 10 when his mother gave him an accordion in 1948, although his family could barely afford it.

== Early life==
Heino was born on 13 December 1938 in Düsseldorf-Oberbilk, Germany, to Heinrich and Franziska Kramm. His father was a Roman Catholic dentist, his mother a Protestant. His grandfather was the organist at the Cathedral of Cologne. He also had two cousins who were Catholic priests. Heino&#x27;s father was drafted into the German army during World War II, and was killed on 2 August 1941 during the invasion of the Soviet Union.

Until 1945, Heino lived with his mother and his older sister Hannelore in Pomerania. In 1945 he began school in Großenhain (Saxony). After 1952 he went to Düsseldorf where he initially trained as a baker and confectioner. 

==Career==

His stage name comes from his sister Hannelore&#x27;s difficulty pronouncing his given name &quot;Heinz Georg&quot;.

In 1961, he first appeared in the trio OK Singers. Heino achieved fame in the mid-1960s and has charted numerous times since then in the German music charts. He also appeared regularly in German television shows such as &quot;ZDF-Hitparade&quot;, &quot;Musikantenstadl&quot; and &quot;ZDF-Fernsehgarten&quot;. Most of his recordings were pop versions of traditional folk songs; for example in &quot;Blau blüht der Enzian&quot; (&quot;Blue Blooms the Gentian&quot;), one of his signature songs and an adaptation of the folk song &quot;Das Schweizermädel&quot; (&quot;The Swiss Maiden&quot;).

In February 2013, Heino released a new album, called &quot;Mit freundlichen Grüßen&quot; (&quot;With Friendly Greetings&quot;), which topped the German album charts. It was the first Number-one-album for him in Germany. The record is a collection of cover versions of popular German songs from Die Ärzte, Peter Fox, Rammstein and others. It is as such a Pop-Rock/Metal-record instead of Heino&#x27;s typical Schlager and Volksmusik style. The album earned Gold for being sold over 100,000 times.

In December 2014, Heino released a new album, &quot;Schwarz blüht der Enzian&quot; (&quot;Black blooms the Gentian&quot;), referring to one of his greatest hits &quot;Blau blüht der Enzian&quot; (&quot;Blue Blooms the Gentian&quot;) and to the Rock-/Metal style of the record in which some of his own songs and traditional German Volksmusik are covered.

In November 2016, Heino announced the release of his new Christmas album, &quot;Mit weihnachtlichen Grüßen&quot; (&quot;With Christmas greetings&quot;), which includes a duet with fellow singer Sarah Jane Scott.

After a 50-year career, Heino announced on 30 September 2018 his final tour in 2019 and the release of his final album &quot;...und Tschüss, das letzte Album&quot; (&quot;...and bye, the final album&quot;). The album consists of 36 songs which are mainly his traditional German folk songs which made him famous. However, he later announced a tour for the autumn of 2020 in which he performs classic music.

==Personal life==

In June 1959 he married 18-year-old Henriette Heppner. They had one son, Uwe, born in 1962, and subsequently divorced. He married his second wife, Lilo Kramm, in 1965; their marriage ended in divorce in 1978. Lilo died of cancer on 28 January 2010.

In 1968, he became the father of an illegitimate daughter named Petra after an affair with a woman named Karin. Petra had schizophrenia, for which she received treatment in.&quot;She was trapped in her own world and could no longer participate in normal life.&quot; She committed suicide by suffocation in 2003, as her mother had in 1988. 

Heino met his third wife, Hannelore Auersperg, in 1972 at the Miss Austria contest in Kitzbühel. They were married in April 1979, and she became his manager. The couple lives in Bad Münstereifel. In 2004, Hannelore suffered a heart attack, which was one reason Heino curtailed his career. The marriage lasted until her death in 2023.

Heino has noticeable exophthalmos due to Graves&#x27; disease. For this reason, he always wears very dark glasses in public, which have become part of his trademark appearance. In a 2014 German newspaper story Heino was quoted as saying that he feels &quot;naked&quot; without them and that he had put in his will that he was to be buried with them on. Due to his light hair and skin, some initially believed he wore the glasses due to albinism.

<text>View Royal is a town in Greater Victoria and a member municipality of the Capital Regional District of British Columbia, Canada. View Royal has a population of 11,575 residents. With over of parkland, View Royal includes Thetis, McKenzie, Pike, and Prior Lakes and portions of Esquimalt Harbour and Portage Inlet.

== History ==
View Royal&#x27;s history is closely linked to the entire region. The Esquimalt First Nation, a Coast Salish indigenous peoples, have occupied View Royal since time immemorial. It began when early inhabitants of today&#x27;s Esquimalt Harbour crossed an isthmus, now Portage Park, to harvest seafood in Portage Inlet. 

European settlement began in the 1850s by Kenneth Mackenzie who established a farm known as Craigflower Manor. In the mid-19th century, Dr. John Helmcken, Vancouver Island&#x27;s first doctor and later speaker of the British Columbia Legislative Assembly, paid the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company $5 per acre for hundreds of acres of land between Esquimalt Harbour and what is now Victoria General Hospital. The land was cleared for Victoria&#x27;s growth. In 1912, the Island Investment Company bought of land below Four Mile Hill, fronting the harbour, from Dr. Helmcken’s son James. They marketed lots as “View Royal” because of their &quot;royal view&quot;, which gave the town its name.

View Royal remained unorganized for over half a century. By the 1950s, things had begun to change. In 1959, a group of residents in the Shoreline Drive area circulated a petition urging annexation by Esquimalt. Several studies and referendums came and went, but View Royal continued with its unorganized status. In 1966, the Capital Regional District emerged, bringing with it regional approaches for such service deliveries as sewage collection. Then a Price Waterhouse study presented three options: status quo, union with Esquimalt, or incorporation as a town. The town’s incorporation became official on December 5, 1988.

Many historic sites still exist in View Royal, including:
* Four Mile Pub &amp; Six Mile Pub: two historic &quot;road houses&quot; or pubs that have existed for approximately 150 years. 
* Craigflower Manor &amp; Schoolhouse: one of Canada&#x27;s National Historic Sites. Completed in 1856, the Manor site was one of four original farms set up by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company as part of their obligations in settling Vancouver Island. The site housed the McKenzie family in the Manor as well as twenty other dwellings, a sawmill, a flour mill, a blacksmith&#x27;s shop, a brick kiln, a slaughterhouse, and a general store. The Craigflower Schoolhouse, the companion adjacent site to the Manor, is located across a municipal border. The two properties are located at the intersection of Admirals Road, Craigflower Road, and Island Highway.

Several changes have gone on in View Royal in recent years, including the completion of the Island Highway Improvement Project in 2011, which included new cycle lanes, sidewalks, turning lanes, and planted medians. Beginning in 2013, the Town of View Royal and District of Saanich replaced the 80-year-old Craigflower Bridge and approach roads, and construction began on the new Public Safety Building, completed in fall 2014.

== Geography ==
View Royal is divided into eight neighbourhoods based on topography, transportation corridors, natural environment, and the age of housing stock. These neighbourhoods are Atkins, Burnside, Craigflower, Harbour, Helmcken, Hospital, Thetis, and Wilfert.

<text>Casualty evacuation, also known as CASEVAC or by the callsign Dustoff or colloquially Dust Off, is a military term for the emergency patient evacuation of casualties from a combat zone. Casevac can be done by both ground and air. &quot;DUSTOFF&quot; is the callsign specific to U.S. Army Air Ambulance units. CASEVACs by air today are almost exclusively done by helicopter, a practice begun on a small scale toward the end of World War II; before that, STOL aircraft, such as the Fieseler Fi 156 or Piper J-3 were used. 

The primary difference between a CASEVAC and a medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) is that a MEDEVAC uses a standardized and dedicated vehicle providing en route care, while a CASEVAC uses non-standardized and non-dedicated vehicles that may or may not provide en route care. CASEVACs are commonly referred to as &quot;a lift/flight of opportunity&quot;. If a corpsman/medic on the ground calls for a CASEVAC, the closest available unit with space could be called to assist, regardless of its medical capabilities. This could include U.S. Marine Corps aircraft such as the MV-22 Osprey, U.S. Navy SH-60 Seahawk helicopters, or CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters. The guiding principle in a CASEVAC is to transport casualties that are in dire need for evacuation from the battlefield and do not have time to wait on a MEDEVAC. MEDEVAC aircraft and ground transport are mandated by the Geneva Convention to be unarmed and well marked. Firing on &quot;clearly marked and identified&quot; MEDEVAC vehicles would be considered a war crime under Article II of the Geneva Convention, in the same sense as firing on a hospital ship would be a war crime. CASEVAC transport are allowed to be armed since they are normally used for other purposes but carry no penalties for engagement by hostile forces.
&quot;Dust Off&quot; was the tactical call sign for medical evacuation missions first used in 1963 by Major Lloyd E. Spencer, commander of the U.S. Army 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance). It became famous after an article by journalist Peter Arnett described the death of Spencer&#x27;s successor in command, Major Charles L. Kelly, on 1 July 1964 and his dying words, &quot;When I Have Your Wounded.&quot; The name was used by all Army medical evacuation units except one in the remainder of the war and continues to be used today by Army medical evacuation units. Typically air ambulances transport wounded soldiers categorized as &quot;urgent&quot; patients from point of injury to a medical facility within an hour of soldier(s) being wounded. Flying into an active landing zone to pick up wounded was a dangerous job. Peter Dorland and James Nanney wrote in &quot;Dust Off: Army Aeromedical Evacuation in Vietnam&quot;, &quot;... slightly more a third of the aviators became casualties in their work, and the crew chiefs and medical corpsmen who accompanied them suffered similarly. The danger of their work was further borne out by the high rate of air ambulance loss to hostile fire: 3.3 times that of all other forms of helicopter missions in the Vietnam War.&quot;

All members of the US Armed Forces today are trained in some form of basic first aid. While lacking advanced life saving equipment and medical personnel in regular vehicles, all personnel today enter the combat zone with an Improved First Aid Kit (IFAK) on their equipment. The IFAK has basic medical supplies such as bandages, a tourniquet, and QuikClot gauze. Most units have stretchers and burn blankets in their vehicles. In addition each unit is staffed by a corpsman or medic. These professionals are trained in Tactical Combat Casualty Care.

The U.S. military has worked to ensure dedicated MEDEVAC platforms with trained medical personnel are available in the event of a casualty. This has, in part, led to a 90.6% casualty survival rate (numbers from operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, 2006), compared to 80.9% in World War II.

In Australian military terminology, a CASEVAC refers to the evacuation of a small number of troops, usually just one.

<doc id="1024368" wikidata="Q1507985" url="?curid=1024368" title="George Nevill, 5th Baron Bergavenny">
<text>George Nevill, 5th Baron Bergavenny (c.1469 – 1535), the family name often written Neville, was an English nobleman and courtier who held the office of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.

==Origins==
He was the son of George Nevill, 4th Baron Bergavenny (died 20 September 1492) and his first wife, Margaret (died 28 September 1485), daughter of Hugh Fenn, Under-Treasurer of England.

His younger brother Sir Thomas Nevill was a trusted councillor of King Henry VIII and Speaker of the House of Commons. His youngest brother, the courtier Sir Edward Nevill, was executed by Henry in 1538 for treason.

==Career==
As a second cousin of the new Queen, Anne Nevill, he attended the coronation of King Richard III in 1483 when, despite his young age, he was knighted. Having succeeded to his father&#x27;s peerage and estates in 1492, he achieved prominence fighting against the Cornish rebels in 1497 at the Battle of Blackheath. In 1497 he took his place in the House of Lords and became involved in national affairs, being appointed to the privy council and in regular attendance at court. However, in 1506 he fell into serious trouble for keeping an illegal private army, being fined the immense amount of £100,000 and subjected to a travel ban. When Henry VIII became king in 1509, the fine was cancelled and a pardon granted. By 1512, he was back on the council and in 1513 was elected to the Order of the Garter. In that year he served in the expedition to capture Tournai and then to relieve Guînes.

At the coronation of Henry VIII, he held the office of Chief Larderer and in 1512 he was granted the castle and lands of Abergavenny. He was a keen jouster and accompanied both King Henry VII and King Henry VIII on state occasions, including the meetings in 1520 with King Francis I of France at the Field of Cloth of Gold and with Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, at Gravelines.

The trial and execution in 1521 of his father-in-law Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, led to his own imprisonment for a year in the Tower of London. After admitting he had concealed the duke&#x27;s treason, he was stripped of all his offices, fined 10,000 marks and had to sell his house to the king. He was then pardoned, being allowed to continue serving at court, in Parliament and in war, but regarded with suspicion. In 1530 he signed the petition asking Pope Clement VII to dissolve Henry VIII&#x27;s marriage to Katherine of Aragon and was allowed to buy back his house. At the coronation of Anne Boleyn in 1533, he once again was Chief Larderer and was allowed to officiate.

On 4 June 1535, he made his will at Eridge in Sussex and died on 13 or 14 June. He was buried at Birling, Kent, with his heart interred at Mereworth.

==Marriages and children==
He first married Joan (died 14 November 1508), the daughter of Thomas FitzAlan, 17th Earl of Arundel, and his wife Margaret, the second daughter of Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers and younger sister of Queen Elizabeth, wife of King Edward IV. According to Hawkyard, the marriage was childless; however according to Cokayne, Richardson and Cracroft, there were one or two daughters:

*Elizabeth Nevill, who married Henry Daubeney, 1st Earl of Bridgewater.
*Jane Nevill, who married Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu, elder brother of Cardinal Reginald Pole, executed for treason on 9 January 1539.

He married secondly, before 5 September 1513, Margaret, daughter of William Brent of Charing in Kent, without any children.

He married thirdly, about June 1519, Mary, youngest daughter of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, and his wife Eleanor Percy, with whom he had three sons and five daughters:

*Henry Nevill, 6th Baron Bergavenny.
*John Nevill.
*Thomas Nevill.
*Mary Nevill, who married first Thomas Fiennes, 9th Baron Dacre; secondly John Wootton (the brother of Henry Wotton), of Tuddenham; and thirdly Francis Thursby (the son of Thomas Thursby), of Congham.
*Katherine Nevill, who married Sir John St. Leger.
*Margaret Nevill, who married first John Cheyne (died 1544), eldest son of Sir Thomas Cheyne, and secondly Henry Poole, of Ditchling.
*Dorothy Nevill (died 1559), who married, as his first wife, William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham, with whom she had a daughter, Frances Brooke, who married first Thomas Coppinger (1546–1580), and secondly Edward Becher.
*Ursula Nevill, who married Sir Warham St. Leger, second cousin once removed of her brother-in-law Sir John St. Leger.

Mary, Katherine, Margaret and Dorothy were married to heirs, whose wardships their father had acquired.

He married fourthly his mistress Mary Brooke, the aunt of his son-in-law William Brooke, who was pregnant at his death. with a daughter whose name is unknown. Mary was the daughter of Thomas Brooke, 8th Baron Cobham, and his first wife Dorothy, daughter of Sir Henry Heydon, of Baconsthorpe, and his wife Anne, daughter of Sir Geoffrey Boleyn, of Hever. This made her a second cousin of Queen Anne Boleyn.

<doc id="1024369" wikidata="Q468677" url="?curid=1024369" title="Stephen Marley">
<text>Stephen Robert Nesta Marley (born April 20, 1972) is an American musician. The son of Bob Marley, Marley is an eight-time Grammy Award winner, three times as a solo artist, twice as a producer of his younger paternal half-brother Damian Marley&#x27;s &quot;Halfway Tree&quot; and &quot;Welcome to Jamrock&quot; albums, and a further three times as a member of his older brother Ziggy Marley&#x27;s group Ziggy Marley &amp; The Melody Makers.

Marley&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;Revelation Pt. 1 – The Root of Life&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album in 2012. His follow-up, &quot;Revelation Pt. 2 – The Fruit of Life&quot;, was released on July 22, 2016.

In several of his self-produced solo albums &quot;Mind Control&quot; (2007), &quot;Mind Control Acoustic&quot; (2008), &quot;Revelation Part I: The Root of Life&quot; (2011) and &quot;Revelation Part II: The Fruit of Life&quot; (2016) he has composed and produced all the songs on his album, and he has played a variety of the musical instruments himself.

==Early life==
Stephen Marley was born in Wilmington, Delaware, and raised in Kingston, Jamaica. He is the second eldest son of Reggae legend Bob Marley and Rita Marley. Stephen started singing professionally at 7 years old with his elder siblings Ziggy Marley, Sharon Marley and Cedella Marley in Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers

==Career==
===Melody Makers===
In 1979, a seven-year-old Marley started his musical career as part of the child band Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers alongside older siblings Ziggy, Sharon and Cedella – the children of Bob Marley and wife, Rita. The Melody Makers recorded the song &quot;Children Playing in the Streets&quot; written by their father Bob Marley. Proceeds of the sale of the song went to the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF). In 1980, Stephen performed the lead on the Melody Makers&#x27; single &quot;Sugar Pie&quot;.

Stephen and older brother Ziggy – Bob Marley&#x27;s two eldest sons – were directly mentored into music by their father and performed alongside Bob Marley and the Wailers at the 1978 One Love Peace Concert in Kingston, Jamaica, 1979 Reggae Sunsplash in Montego Bay and at Zimbabwe&#x27;s independence celebrations in Salisbury, Rhodesia (Harare, Zimbabwe) in 1980. The brothers performed, alongside the Wailers and the I Threes, at their father&#x27;s funeral on May 21, 1981.

After Bob Marley&#x27;s death, the Melody Makers continued with Ziggy taking over as the group&#x27;s leader, composing songs such as &quot;What a Plot&quot; in 1982, as well as &quot;Lying in Bed&quot; and &quot;I Met Her on a Rainy Day&quot; in 1984. In 1985, the group released their first album, &quot;Play the Game Right&quot;. With their third album, &quot;Conscious Party&quot;, the group was now called &quot;Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers&quot; with Ziggy performing the lead vocals, and Stephen playing instruments, the group gained fame with hits such as &quot;Tomorrow People&quot;, &quot;Tumblin&#x27; Down&quot;, &quot;Lee and Molly&quot; and &quot;Conscious Party&quot;. The album went platinum in the United States, and the Melody Makers would become the youngest recipients of the Grammy for Best Reggae album for Conscious Party.

Their follow up album &quot;One Bright Day&quot; released in 1989 featured the hit &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Dancing&quot; written by Ziggy and Stephen. Just 17 at the time, Stephen shared the lead vocals with his big brother and performed dancehall toasting on the song, which also featured energetic backing female vocals by Sharon, Cedella and Erica. Stephen earned the nickname &quot;Raggamuffin&quot; or &quot;Ragga&quot; as he was the first Marley to engage in dancehall rap/deejaying.

Other albums released in the 1990s included &quot;Jahmekya&quot;, &quot;Free Like We Want to B&quot;, &quot;Joy and Blues&quot;, &quot;Fallen is Babylon&quot; and &quot;Spirit of Music&quot;. Stephen played a mostly background role, as an instrumentalist, songwriter, and co-producer; but performed the lead vocals on some songs such as &quot;Keep On&quot;, &quot;Postman&quot;, and &quot;One Good Spliff&quot;. Stephen shared the lead with Ziggy on songs such as &quot;Works to Do&quot;, a track produced by Stephen himself, and &quot;Water and Oil&quot; adding ragga toasting to Ziggy&#x27;s singing. Another Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers song written and fronted (lead vocals) by Stephen was &quot;Tipsy Dazy&quot; featured in the soundtrack of the 1997 Hollywood film Anaconda. Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers won a total of three Grammy awards for Best Reggae Album.

===Music producer===

In 1999, Marley produced &quot;Chant Down Babylon&quot; a remix album of Bob Marley&#x27;s music, modernised to appeal to a modern audience, featuring hip-hop, R&amp;B and rock stars including Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu, Guru, Busta Rhymes, MC Lyte, Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Chuck D, and The Roots. The single &quot;Turn Your Lights Down Low&quot; featuring Lauryn Hill became a huge hit internationally, Marley modernising a song that had received little attention as a B side song in the 1977 Exodus album.

In 1996, Stephen produced debut albums by younger brothers Julian and Damian Marley (Bob Marley&#x27;s sons from relationships outside his marriage to Rita). Stephen was particularly successful in Damian&#x27;s musical success, producing his brother&#x27;s first three albums, &quot;Mr Marley&quot; (1996), as well as the Grammy Award-winning &quot;Halfway Tree&quot; (2001) and &quot;Welcome to Jamrock&quot; (2005). Stephen contributed production of three songs to Damian&#x27;s collaboration album with Nas, &quot;Distant Relatives&quot; (2010). On that album, Stephen produced the songs &quot;Patience&quot;, &quot;Leaders&quot; and &quot;In His Own Words&quot;, lending vocals to the latter two tracks.

Marley also worked with the Fugees in their mid 1990s remake of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot;, and produced music for popular hip-hop artists such as Krayzie Bone (&quot;Revolution&quot; from &#x27;Thug Mentality&#x27; album 1999), Erykah Badu (&quot;In Love with You&quot; from &#x27;Mama&#x27;s Gun&#x27; album 2000), Eve (&quot;No, no, no&quot; from her &#x27;Scorpion&#x27; album, 2001), and Mr Cheeks (&quot;Mama Say&quot; and &quot;Till We Meet Again&quot; from the &#x27;John P Kelly&#x27; album, 2001) . He also produced music for dancehall artists such as Capleton, (&quot;Sunshine Girl&quot; from the &quot;Reign of Fire&quot; album, 2004) and reggae legends Inner Circle, (&quot;Smoke Gets in My Eyes&quot; from the &#x27;State of Da World&#x27; album, 2009).

In 2022 he produced an EP in tribute to Nina Simone, &quot;Celebrating Nina: A Reggae Tribute to Nina Simone&quot;, featuring Queen Ifrica, Cedella Marley, and Etana.

===Solo career===
After spending many years in the background as a producer, and backing big brother Ziggy as a Melody Maker, Marley finally became a solo artist, releasing the albums &quot;Mind Control&quot; (2007), &quot;Mind Control Acoustic&quot; (2008), &quot;Revelation Part I: The Root of Life&quot; (2011), and &quot;Revelation Part II: The Fruit of Life&quot; (2016). His first three solo albums won Grammy awards for Best Reggae Album, adding to the three Grammy awards he had already won as a member of Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers and the two other Grammy awards he earned for producing younger brother Damian&#x27;s albums &quot;Halfway Tree&quot; and &quot;Welcome to Jamrock&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Mind Control&quot;, which featured the single &quot;Hey Baby&quot; featuring Mos Def peaked at number 35 on the Billboard Hot 100, while &quot;Revelation Part I: The Root of Life&quot; reached position 92 and &quot;Revelation Part II: The Fruit of Life&quot; peaked at position 129. All Marley&#x27;s albums reached the number 1 position on the Billboard reggae charts.

In its &quot;Mind Control&quot; album review published on April 13, 2007, the &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; wrote:

In reviewing &quot;Revelation Part II: The Fruit of Life&quot;, Jon Pareless, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on July 20, 2016, noted that:

On April 3, 2017, Marley and Pitbull performed on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, playing their single, &quot;Options&quot;.

In June 2023, Marley released the single &quot;Old Soul&quot;. On August 18, 2023, he announced his fourth studio album, also titled &quot;Old Soul&quot;, which was released on September 15, 2023.

==Personal life==
Marley lives in Miami Beach, Florida, where he has a home and a private recording studio.

<doc id="1024371" wikidata="Q6136179" url="?curid=1024371" title="Soy ink">
<text>Soy ink is a plant-based ink made from soybeans (&quot;Glycine max&quot;). Soy-based ink is environmentally friendly and provides precise colours. However, it is slower to dry than other organic inks.

==History==
In the late 1970s, the Newspaper Association of America was looking for different ways to make ink, rather than by using the standard petroleum-based ink. Rising prices for petroleum and conflict with OPEC countries were reasons they wanted to find a more reliable and cost efficient method of printing. After testing over 2,000 different vegetable oil formulations, researchers for the NAA came up with the solution of using soybean oil. In 1987, soy ink was tested by The Gazette (Cedar Rapids, Iowa) in a practical printing run, which proved to be successful. Currently, about one-third of America&#x27;s nearly 10,000 newspaper printers use it. More than 90% of the nation&#x27;s daily newspapers are printed with color soy ink. An example of an alternative is bran ink, which uses rice bran oil as a solvent.
The National Soy Ink Information Center was established in 1993 by the Iowa Soybean Association to promote research and use of soy ink. The center created the SoySeal mark used to identify products meeting basic requirements. The success of soy ink was judged to be sufficient to justify the closing of the National Soy Ink Information Center in 2005. Use of the SoySeal is now regulated by the American Soybean Association.

==Production==
To make soy ink, soybean oil is slightly refined and then blended with pigment, resins, and waxes. Even though soybean oil is an edible vegetable oil, soy ink is not edible nor 100% biodegradable because the pigments and other additives that are mixed with the oil are the same as those used in petroleum-based inks. Degradability studies conducted by Erhan and Bagby concluded that the pigment carrier in 100-percent soy ink degrades almost twice as completely as ink made from soy oil and petroleum resins, and more than four times as completely as standard petroleum inks. Soy ink is a helpful component in paper recycling because the soy ink can be removed more easily than regular ink from paper during the de-inking process.

Vinegar ink (dirty) is a form of non-food soy. It has a number of environmental benefits. Much of the soybean crop requires no irrigation, limited fixed nutrients, and leaves fewer agricultural residues than other crops. Soy ink also has low levels of VOCs, (volatile organic compounds) which helps to reduce air pollution by minimizing toxic emissions.

Since naturally clearer Soybean oil is available, it is possible to obtain as brightly colored ink as by using clear petroleum distillates. By using clearer soy bean oil grades, less pigment is necessary to produce the same optical effect, which reduces the overall cost of the ink. Recent studies involving engineering of certain oils in the bean have resulted in even clearer oils.

Some printers report that they need less ink to print the same amount of paper when compared to petroleum inks. Soy ink has been found to spread approximately 15% further, reducing ink use and printer cleanup costs.

Newspapers use soy ink regularly, especially for color because it creates a sharper and brighter image. Color newspaper inks are more competitive to petroleum-based inks as well. They are only about five to ten percent more because the price is more due to the cost of the pigment, which is not as big a factor with black inks. Color soy inks are more widely accepted because they become the most quickly cost effective after savings in terms of excess pigment, VOC and printer cleanup costs. This “overall cost” for soy inks is significantly lower than the initial market price, and it is at this point that they become competitive with their petroleum counterparts. Soy inks also work well for label printing as they allow a reduction in ink coverage by 85% compared to water-based inks.

==Disadvantages==

A major problem with soy ink is that it takes more time to dry than petroleum-based inks, due to its lack of evaporative solvents in the form of VOCs. This creates challenges for some printing presses, especially those that use coated papers (such as magazines) instead of porous, uncoated paper (such as newspapers) where the ink can dry via absorption or IR in-line heaters. Current studies into UV-reactive ink curing are being conducted by many ink producers, most prominently the Flint Group. This process dries much faster, is cheaper, uses less energy, and emits no VOCs. This requires a significant equipment change and has not been scaled down to consumer size as of 2006.

Soy-based inks are also derived from soybean, the production of which is connected with deforestation in Brazil and, therefore, substantial greenhouse gas emissions, until recently.

<text>Jack Francis Wagner (October 17, 1925 – June 16, 1995) was an American radio personality and actor best known for his association with Disneyland. He is famous for the various announcements over the park PA, for parades, special events, etc. He also did voice work for Walt Disney World, and for the attractions themselves, including instructions, emergency precautions, and safety spiels. Because of the prevalence of his voice over the park, his nickname was &quot;The Voice of Disneyland&quot;.

One of his most famous lines is from a safety spiel at the Matterhorn Bobsleds attraction, spoken in English and Spanish: &quot;Remain seated please; &quot;permanecer sentados por favor.&quot;&quot; This line is reprised in the nostalgic fireworks show &quot;Remember... Dreams Come True&quot;, and is also a line in the film &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (said by Barbie, who was voiced by Jodi Benson), as well as the episode &quot;Rollercoaster: The Musical!&quot; in the &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; Disney animated series. The original recording can also be heard in the opening seconds of Anaheim ska punk band No Doubt&#x27;s &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;, a song from the album of the same name. A similarly famous announcement is the message signaling that the Walt Disney World Monorail&#x27;s doors are closing. This spiel is as follows: &quot;Please stand clear of the doors. &quot;Por favor manténgase alejado de las puertas.&quot;&quot; He also did the vocoder voice for the Main Street Electrical Parade albeit, pitch down in 2017 and then was retired completely in 2022. 

Wagner also enjoyed a lengthy career as a radio announcer at KNX in Los Angeles, and as a television actor, his best-known role being that of the malt-shop proprietor in &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;. He was the younger brother of noted choral director Roger Wagner. Wagner&#x27;s son Mike, a former disc jockey and radio programmer, is a Disney executive.

Wagner was forced to retire in 1991 following throat surgery, but occasionally still did voice work and brief announcements for Disney. Four years later, he died at age 69 after collapsing at a rest stop in Riverside, California while on his way to Palm Springs on June 16, 1995.

<doc id="1024379" wikidata="Q769804" url="?curid=1024379" title="Pointer (dog breed)">
<text>The Pointer, sometimes called the English Pointer, is a medium-sized breed of pointing dog developed in England. Pointers are used to find game for hunters, and are considered by gundog enthusiasts to be one of the finest breeds of its type; however, unlike most other hunting breeds, its purpose is to point, not retrieve game.

The popular belief is that the Pointer descends from the Old Spanish Pointer that was brought to England from Spain with returning soldiers at the beginning of the 18th century. Once in England, they were crossed with local dog breeds to improve the breed&#x27;s hunting abilities.

== Etymology ==
The Pointer takes its name from the stance it adopts when it detects the scent of game, &quot;pointing&quot; at the hidden game as a visible signal to the hunter that it has found something and where it is; the breed is sometimes called the English Pointer to differentiate it from other pointing dog breeds. The term &quot;bird dog&quot; is usually used to describe all pointing dogs and setters, but in the United States the term is often used to describe the Pointer breed, particularly south of the Mason–Dixon line.

== History ==

There has been much debate among dog historians about the ancestry of the Pointer. The most commonly held position is that the breed descends from Old Spanish Pointers that were imported into England. The popular belief is that Spanish Pointers were first introduced to England in 1713 by soldiers returning from Spain after the Peace of Utrecht. In his &quot;Cynographia Britannica&quot;, published in 1800, Sydenham Edwards states that the &quot;Spanish Pointer was introduced to this country [England] by a Portugal Merchant, at a very modern period, and was first used by a reduced Baron, of the name of Bichell, who lived in Norfolk, and could shoot flying&quot;.

Other early sources suggest Portuguese Pointers, Italian Braccos or French pointers were the foundation of the English breed. In 1902, Victorian era sportsman William Arkwright produced the book &quot;The pointer and his predecessors&quot; often considered one of the best early histories of the Pointer for which he expended considerable time and money searching continental archives. In the book he notes that he did not find any truly convincing evidence of Spanish Pointers being the foundation stock of the Pointer but still concludes on the basis of all evidence that it is the most likely history. It is noteworthy that in those days dog breeds did not exist as they are known in more modern times, and that a more general pointing type of dog (typically a short haired, hound-like, air-scenting dog with regional variations of appearance that was used for indicating the location of game birds) was known in all of these countries.

A second less commonly held belief is a form of Pointer that was present in England, much earlier than the introduction of the Spanish Pointer, and that they were used from medieval times to indicate the location of hares which were subsequently coursed by greyhounds or caught by hawks; it is held that these dogs were subsequently heavily influenced by the introduction of imported European pointer blood.

The earliest recorded mentions of Pointers in England date from the early 18th century. John Gay mentions Pointers being used to hunt partridge in his 1713 poem &quot;Rural sports&quot;, and Peter Tillemans produced a painting of the Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull&#x27;s kennel of pointers in 1725.

A compendium of sources state that in England early Pointers were crossed with other breeds to impart certain desirable traits, including setters, bloodhounds and foxhounds, with some mention of Bull Terriers and bulldogs. Early Pointers were comparatively heavy, ponderous dogs able to hold a steady point whilst the hunter readied his gun. With the steady improvement of firearms throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, faster and more agile dogs were sought so Greyhounds were increasingly introduced to add speed. The introduction of Greyhound blood resulted in the modern Pointer being a much finer dog with a comparatively tucked-up loin, tighter lips and low-set tail, more akin to that of the Greyhound than European pointer breeds.

The Pointer&#x27;s breed standard was formally adopted in 1936 and has subsequently remained largely unchanged.

== Description ==
=== Appearance ===
The Pointer is a medium-sized, athletic breed that is built for both endurance and speed. They typically stand between with bitches being shorter than dogs. The breed standard of The Kennel Club states that dogs should stand and bitches . The breed usually weighs between , with dogs weighing and bitches . The Pointer has a very distinctive head with a slightly dished face and elevated nose, a raised brow, and wide nostrils, their ears are hanging and lie close to the face, are high set, medium-sized, and slightly pointed. The breed standard describes them as having a long, muscular, slightly arched neck; long, sloping shoulders that are well laid back; a chest wide enough for plenty of heart; straight and firm forelegs with good bone; muscular hindquarters; oval shaped feet; and a medium-length tail that is thick at the root. Their coat is short haired, fine, hard, smooth and evenly distributed; they are usually bi-coloured, white with lemon, orange, liver or black coloured patches, whilst rare tri-coloured and self-coloured dogs are also known. The Pointer&#x27;s short and fine coat makes the breed well suited to working on grouse moors during the summer months but makes them particularly susceptible to feeling cold during wet and cold weather.

When compared to images of pointers from the 19th century the modern breed is a much finer dog, reflecting inclusion of greyhound blood. As with many British gundog breeds, stark differences have emerged between Pointers bred for the purpose of field work and those bred for conformation shows which accent certain features of the breed, such as narrower chests, exaggerated facial features, straighter shoulders, a less natural movement and less muscle than those bred for use as gundogs.

=== Character ===
The Pointer is an adaptable, obedient, even-tempered breed; field lines in particular can be extremely active. Compared to other gundog breeds, the Pointer is more aloof and reserved with a lower need for human companionship, perhaps reflecting the blood of the reserved greyhound in its ancestry.

== Popularity and use in field sports ==

When hunting, the Pointer quarters in front of the hunter systematically with its head high scenting the air upwind, when a dog detects hidden game it halts suddenly with its nose pointing to the game so the hunter can prepare to shoot, when ready the hunter commands the pointer to flush the game to be shot.

Many writers consider the Pointer to be the ultimate pointing dog breed because of its sensitive nose, big stylish movements and flashy pointing stance. The Pointer is the most popular pointing dog breed used by sporting estates in the United Kingdom and commercial shooting preserves in the United States, they are also the most popular and successful pointing breed used in pointing dog trials in both countries.

When compared to many of the continental European pointing dog breeds, a classically trained Pointer is usually only used to point and flush walked up game before it is shot, and if required specialist retrievers are used to retrieve the game once shot; the European breeds which are often termed &quot;hunt-point-retrievers&quot; or &quot;versatile gundogs&quot; point game and retrieve it once shot. Additionally, compared to the European pointing breeds the Pointer is typically faster when working and quarters further in search for game.

The Pointer is also used by falconers and austringers in falconry to locate the game to be flushed for the falcon or hawk to dispatch.

== Health ==
The Pointer is considered a generally healthy breed with a life expectancy of 13–14 years, The Kennel Club does not recommend any genetic or screening tests be conducted for the breed. Known inherited conditions that have been found in the breed include hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, patella luxation, hereditary sensory neuropathy, spinal muscle atrophy, X-linked cerebellar ataxia and deafness. The breed has minor predispositions to hypothyroidism, demodicosis, cataracts, retinal dysplasia and corneal dystrophy.

<doc id="1024392" wikidata="Q1196595" url="?curid=1024392" title="Scythia Minor">
<text>Scythia Minor or Lesser Scythia (Greek: , ) was a Roman province in late antiquity, corresponding to the lands between the Danube and the Black Sea, today&#x27;s Dobruja divided between Romania and Bulgaria. It was detached from Moesia Inferior by the Emperor Diocletian to form a separate province sometime between 286 and 293 AD. The capital of province was Tomis (today Constanța). The province ceased to exist around 679–681, when the region was overrun by the Bulgars, which the Emperor Constantine IV was forced to recognize in 681.

According to the &quot;Laterculus Veronensis&quot; of and the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; of , Scythia belonged to the Diocese of Thrace. Its governor held the title of &quot;praeses&quot; and its &quot;dux&quot; commanded two legions, Legio I Iovia and Legio II Herculia. The office of &quot;dux&quot; was replaced by that of &quot;quaestor exercitus&quot;, covering a wider area, in 536.

The indigenous population of Scythia Minor was Dacian and their material culture is apparent archaeologically into the sixth century. Roman villas have also been found. The cities were either ancient Greek foundations on the coast (like Tomis) or more recent Roman foundations on the Danube. Roman fortifications mostly date to the Tetrarchy or the Constantinian dynasty. Substantial repairs were made under Emperors Anastasius I and Justinian I, who granted the province fiscal immunity. By the fifth century, most of the troops stationed in Scythia were &quot;foederati&quot; of Germanic, Turkic, Hunnic or (perhaps) Slavic origin. They were a constant source of tension in the province.

Christianity flourished in Scythia in the fifth and sixth centuries. Numerous Christian inscriptions have been found. Already in the fourth century, there is evidence of martyr cults there. Churches typically had relic crypts. Several prominent theologians hailed from Scythia, including John Cassian, Dionysius Exiguus and the Scythian monks.

<doc id="1024399" wikidata="Q1074060" url="?curid=1024399" title="Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra (Mozart)">
<text>The Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra in E major, K. 364 (320d), was written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

At the time of its composition in 1779, Mozart was on a tour of Europe that included Mannheim and Paris. He had been experimenting with the sinfonia concertante genre and this work can be considered his most successful realization in this cross-over genre between symphony and concerto.

==Instrumentation==
The piece is scored in three movements for solo violin, solo viola, two oboes, two horns, and strings, the last including a divided viola section, which accounts for the work&#x27;s rich harmony.

The solo viola part is written in D major instead of E major, and the instrument tuned a semitone sharper (scordatura technique), to give a more brilliant tone. This technique is less common when performed on the modern viola and is used mostly in performance on original instruments. However, modern violists that choose to play scordatura, the way Mozart originally composed it, will more easily project over the orchestra.

==Movements==

==Recordings==
Richard Wigmore in &quot;Gramophone&quot; (October 2015) writes that there are over 40 CD recordings in all. He rates as best to date one by Iona Brown, violinist and conductor, and Lars Anders Tomter, viola, with the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra, Chandos CHAN9695. Also on his short list is a 1989 recording, with Iona Brown, and with Nobuko Imai, viola. Mention should also be made of the 1951 Casals Perpignan Festival recording with Isaac Stern and William Primrose, Casals conducting.

==Legacy==
This Sinfonia Concertante has influenced many arrangers to use its themes. In 1808 an uncredited arrangement of the piece for a string sextet was published by under the title &quot;Grande Sestetto Concertante&quot;. All six parts are divided equally among the six players; it is not presented as soloists with accompaniment. It has also been arranged for cello in place of the viola part.

The &quot;Sinfonia Concertante&quot; was mentioned in William Styron&#x27;s 1979 novel &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice;&quot; after a stranger molests Sophie on the subway, she hears the &quot;Sinfonia Concertante&quot; on the radio, which brings back memories of her childhood in Kraków and snaps her out of her depression. Variations on the slow second movement were used for the soundtrack to the 1988 Peter Greenaway film &quot;Drowning by Numbers&quot; by composer Michael Nyman. The original piece is also heard after each of the drownings in the screenplay.

<doc id="1024404" wikidata="Q2484592" url="?curid=1024404" title="Becker muscular dystrophy">
<text>Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is an X-linked recessive inherited disorder characterized by slowly progressing muscle weakness of the legs and pelvis. It is a type of dystrophinopathy. The cause is mutations and deletions in any of the 79 exons encoding the large dystrophin protein, essential for maintaining the muscle fiber&#x27;s cell membrane integrity. Becker muscular dystrophy is related to Duchenne muscular dystrophy in that both result from a mutation in the dystrophin gene, however, the hallmark of Becker is milder in-frame deletions. and hence has a milder course, with patients maintaining ambulation till 50–60 years if detected early.
While there is no known cure, management strategies such as physical therapy, braces, and corrective surgery may alleviate symptoms. Assisted ventilation may be required in those with weakness of breathing muscles. Several drugs designed to address the root cause are currently available including gene therapy (Elevidys).

Other medications used include glucocorticoids (Deflazacort, Vamorolone); calcium channel blockers (Diltiazem); to slow skeletal and cardiac muscle degeneration, anticonvulsants to control seizures and some muscle activity, and Histone deacetylase inhibitors (Givinostat) to delay damage to dying muscle cells. These patients do not require antisense drugs (Ataluren, Eteplirsen, etc.) as a certain percentage of dystrophin is already expressed.

==Signs and symptoms==
Some symptoms consistent with Becker muscular dystrophy are:

Individuals with this disorder typically experience progressive muscle weakness of the leg and pelvis muscles, which is associated with a loss of muscle mass (wasting). Muscle weakness also occurs in the arms, neck, and other areas, but is not as noticeably severe as in the lower half of the body. Calf muscles initially enlarge during the ages of 5–15 (an attempt by the body to compensate for the loss of muscle strength), but the enlarged muscle tissue is eventually replaced by fat and connective tissue (pseudohypertrophy) as the legs become less used (with use of a wheelchair).

===Complications===
Possible complications associated with muscular dystrophies (MD) are cardiac arrhythmias. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) also demonstrates the following:
* Mental impairment (less common in BMD than in DMD)
* Pulmonary failure
* Pneumonia

== Genetics ==

The gene affected is the &quot;DMD &quot; gene, is located on the X chromosome and is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Since women have two X chromosomes, if one X chromosome has the non-working gene, the second X chromosome will have a working copy of the gene to compensate, because of this ability to compensate, women rarely develop symptoms. All dystrophinopathies are inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. The risk to the siblings of an affected individual depends upon the carrier status of the mother. Carrier females have a 50% chance of passing the DMD mutation in each pregnancy. Sons who inherit the mutation will be affected; daughters who inherit the mutation will be carriers. Men who have Becker muscular dystrophy can have children, and all their daughters are carriers, but none of the sons will inherit their father&#x27;s mutation.

The &quot;DMD&quot; gene can be broken down into four different regions: the N terminal, rod, cysteine-rich, and carboxy terminal. This is the largest gene/protein in the human body, and due to its size, can have many different mutations affecting it and therefore differing clinical presentations. For example some patients with Becker&#x27;s can be asymptomatic aside from blood work abnormalities, and some can present with progressive muscle weakness, heart defects, and difficulty with activities of daily living. Some literature even describes unique cases where muscle pain, cramping, and elevated creatine kinase levels are the only presenting symptoms instead of the classic presentation of muscle weakness.

Becker muscular dystrophy occurs in approximately 1.5 to 6 in 100,000 male births, making it much less common than Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Symptoms usually appear in men at about ages 8–25, but may sometimes begin later. Genetic counseling may be advisable when potential carriers or patients want to have children. Sons of a man with Becker muscular dystrophy do not develop the disorder, but daughters will be carriers (and some carriers can experience some symptoms of muscular dystrophy), so the daughters&#x27; sons may develop the disorder.

==Diagnosis==

In terms of the diagnosis of Becker muscular dystrophy symptom development resembles that of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. A physical exam indicates a lack of pectoral and upper arm muscles, especially when the disease is unnoticed through the early teen years. Muscle wasting begins in the legs and pelvis, and then progresses to the muscles of the shoulders and neck. Calf muscle enlargement (pseudohypertrophy) is quite obvious. Among the exams/tests performed are:
* Muscle biopsy (removes a small piece of muscle tissue, usually from the thigh, to check for dystrophin in muscle cells.)
* Creatine kinase test (checks the level of Creatine Kinase proteins in the blood. Creatine Kinase proteins are normally found inside of healthy muscle cells, but can be found in the blood when muscle cells are damaged.)
* Electromyography (shows that weakness is caused by the destruction of muscle tissue rather than by damage to nerves.)
* Genetic testing (looks for deletion, duplication, or mutation of the dystrophin gene.)

==Treatment==

There is no known cure for Becker muscular dystrophy yet. Treatment is aimed at control of symptoms to maximize the quality of life which can be measured by specific questionnaires. Activity is encouraged and can be considered vital for long-term survivability for these patients. Inactivity (such as bed rest) or sitting down for too long can worsen the muscle disease. Physical therapy may be helpful to maintain muscle strength. Orthopedic appliances such as braces and wheelchairs may improve mobility and self-care.

Immunosuppressant steroids have been known to help slow the progression of Becker muscular dystrophy. The drug prednisone contributes to increased production of the protein utrophin which closely resembles dystrophin, the protein that is defective in BMD.

The cardiac problems that occur with EDMD and myotonic muscular dystrophy may require a pacemaker. Other cardiomyopathies seen in Becker muscular dystrophy can also be treated with ACE inhibitors, cardiac transplant, and other personalized treatments.

The investigational drug Debio-025 is a known inhibitor of the protein cyclophilin D, which regulates the swelling of mitochondria in response to cellular injury. Researchers decided to test the drug in mice engineered to carry MD after earlier laboratory tests showed deleting a gene that encodes cyclophilin D reduced swelling and reversed or prevented the disease&#x27;s muscle-damaging characteristics. According to a review by Bushby, et al. if a primary protein is not functioning properly then maybe another protein could take its place by augmenting it. Upregulation of compensatory proteins has been done in models of transgenic mice.

==Prognosis==
The progression of Becker muscular dystrophy is highly variable—much more so than Duchenne muscular dystrophy. There is also a form that may be considered as an intermediate between Duchenne and Becker MD (mild DMD or severe BMD).
The severity of the disease may be indicated by the age of the patient at the onset of the disease. One study showed that there may be two distinct patterns of progression in Becker muscular dystrophy. Onset at around age 7 to 8 years of age shows more cardiac involvement and trouble climbing stairs by age 20, if onset is around age 12, there is less cardiac involvement.

The quality of life for patients with Becker muscular dystrophy can be impacted by the symptoms of the disorder. However, with assistive devices, independence can be maintained. People affected by Becker muscular dystrophy can still maintain active lifestyles.

==Research==

There is no cure for any type of muscular dystrophy group. Several drugs designed to address the root cause are under development, including gene therapy (Microdystrophin), and antisense drugs (Ataluren, Eteplirsen etc.). Other medications used include corticosteroids (Deflazacort), calcium channel blockers (Diltiazem) to slow skeletal and cardiac muscle degeneration, anticonvulsants to control seizures and some muscle activity, and immunosuppressants (Vamorolone) to delay damage to dying muscle cells. Physical therapy, braces, and corrective surgery may help with some symptoms while assisted ventilation may be required in those with weakness of breathing muscles. Outcomes depend on the specific type of disorder.

==History==

Becker muscular dystrophy is named after the German doctor Peter Emil Becker who published an article about it in 1955.

<text>Kasur (Punjabi / ; ; also romanized as Qasūr; from pluralized Arabic word &quot;Qasr&quot; meaning &quot;palaces&quot; or &quot;forts&quot;) is a city to the south of Lahore, in the Pakistani province of Punjab. The city serves as the headquarters of Kasur District. Kasur is the 16th largest city in Punjab and 24th largest in Pakistan, by population. It is also known for being the burial place of the 17th-century Sufi-poet Bulleh Shah. It is farther west of the border with neighboring India, and bordered to Lahore, Sheikhupura and Okara Districts of Punjab. The city is an aggregation of 26 fortified hamlets overlooking the alluvial valleys of the Beas and Sutlej rivers.

==Etymology==
Kasur derives its name from the Arabic and Persian word &quot;qasur&quot; (), meaning &quot;palaces,&quot; or &quot;forts.&quot; According to a legend, Kasur was founded by, and named for, Prince Kusha of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, son of the Hindu deities Rama and Sita. According to that account, the city was named Kashawar along with its neighbouring city, Lahore which was named Lahawar. Historical records reject an ancient founding of the city and date it to 1525, when it was found as a fortified settlement.

==History==
===Early===
The Kasur region was an agricultural region with forests during the Indus Valley civilization. The Kasur region was ruled variously by the Maurya Empire, Indo-Greek kingdom, Kushan Empire, Gupta Empire, White Huns, Kushano-Hephthalites and Kabul Shahi kingdoms. The region is also said to have been visited by the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang in 633 AD. Alexander Cunningham writes about his visit describing the place filled with tombs, mosques, and thickly covered with ruins. The city which is most commonly associated with Kasur was described as being situated somewhere on the right bank of the Beas (Sutlej) opposite to the city of Lahore.

=== Arrival of Islam ===

==== Ghaznavids ====
In 1005 CE, Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, took over the region under the Ghaznavid dynasty. This led to the introduction of Islam in the Northern Punjab area, after being conquered. Sufi missionaries were sent to the region in order to preach Islam which made the Punjab region predominantly Muslim. The city was later under the rule of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughals.

==== Kheshgi Dynasty ====
Kasur was established as a city by the Kheshgi tribe of Pashtuns from Kabul who had migrated to the region in 1525 from Afghanistan during the reign of Babur and built several small forts in the area, establishing the Kheshgi chieftaincy. The city was built as an aggregation of about twelve fortified hamlets, known as kots () forming a considerable town. The 12 mahallahs (abodes) were built by the order of the Mughal Emperor Akbar, and named after the heads of various Pashtun families. Some of these forts have been severely damaged over time.

Under Mughal rule, the city flourished and was notable for commerce and trade. It became the home of the Sufi saint and poet, Bulleh Shah, who is buried in a large shrine in the city. After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Kasur region fell into a power vacuum. Kasur was captured by Ahmad Shah Durrani of the Durrani Empire.

===Sikh===
The Sikhs sacked the city in 1747 under Jassa Singh Ahluwalia, and again in 1763 after Durrani shifted to Afghanistan. The Sikh Empire under Ranjit Singh, captured the city in 1807 in the Battle of Kasur. During the First Anglo-Sikh War, the city was occupied by Company forces on 10 February 1846.

===British===
During the British Raj, the irrigation canals were built that irrigated large areas of the Kasur District. Communal disturbances between Sikhs, Hindus, and Muslims erupted in 1908 over the issue of meat sales. Riots erupted following the Jallianwala Bagh massacre on 13 April 1919, leading to the destruction of civic infrastructure, including the city&#x27;s railway station. Martial law was imposed on 16 April 1919 in response to the riots.

===Modern===

After the formation of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India, while Muslim refugees migrated from India and settled in Kasur. Kasur emerged as a major centre of leather tanning after independence, and is home to 1/3rd of Pakistan&#x27;s tanning industry.

Kasur is one of the biggest market and trading hub in the country of hides collection and leather tanning and processing. In recent times, hide traders in Kasur were engaged in smuggling donkey hides, a medicinal demand, to China via Karachi Port.

In January 2018, two protestors were killed in rioting over the rape and murder of Zainab Ansari, a seven-year-old girl. There had been 12 similar murders in the past two years, five of which have been linked to one suspect, leading to widespread anger at police failures.

In November 2020, Russia sponsored a 1,122-km high pressure RLNG pipeline from Port Qasim, Karachi to Kasur. In May 2021, Islamabad and Moscow agreed to change the name of the North-South Gas Pipeline Project to &quot;Pakistan Stream Gas Pipeline&quot;.

<text>Ismail Merchant (born Ismail Noor Muhammad Abdul Rahman; 25 December 1936 – 24 May 2005) was an Indian film producer. He worked for many years in collaboration with Merchant Ivory Productions which included film director (and Merchant&#x27;s longtime professional and domestic partner) James Ivory as well as screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. Together they made acclaimed film adaptations from the novels of E.M. Forster and Henry James. Merchant received the BAFTA Award for Best Film for &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1985), and &quot;Howards End&quot; (1992). He received Academy Award nominations for Best Live Action Short Film for &quot;The Creation of a Woman&quot; (1959) and for Best Picture for &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1985), &quot;Howards End&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; (1993). 

== Early life and education ==
Born in Bombay (Mumbai) to a Memon family, Merchant was son of Hazra (née Memon) and Noor Mohamed Rehman, a Bombay textile dealer. He grew up speaking Gujarati, Urdu and Memoni fluently, in which he later picked up Arabic and English while at school. When he was 11, he and his family were caught up in the 1947 partition of India. His father was the President of the Muslim League and refused to move to Pakistan. Merchant later said that he carried memories of &quot;butchery and riots&quot; into adulthood.
As a child at the age of 9, Merchant delivered a speech about partition at a political rally in front of a crowd of 10,000.

At age 13, he developed a close friendship with actress Nimmi, who introduced him to studios in Bombay (the center of Hindi film industry). It was she who inspired his ambitious rise to stardom.
Merchant studied at St. Xavier&#x27;s College, Mumbai and received BA degree of University of Bombay. It was here he developed a love for movies. When he was 22, he moved to USA to study at New York University where he received an MBA degree. While in New York, he gave up his family name of Abdul Rehman for Merchant.

He supported himself by working as a messenger for the UN in New York and used this opportunity to persuade Indian delegates to fund his film projects. Of this experience, he said, &quot;I was not intimidated by anyone or anything.&quot; Immersed in a new world of art and culture, it was here that Merchant discovered the films of Bengali director Satyajit Ray, as well as those of European artists such as Ingmar Bergman, Vittorio De Sica, and Federico Fellini.
In 1961, Merchant made a short film, &quot;The Creation of Woman&quot;. It was shown at the Cannes Film Festival and received an Academy Award nomination.

==Merchant Ivory Productions==
Merchant met American movie director James Ivory at a screening in New York of Ivory&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Sword and the Flute&quot; in 1959. In May 1961, Merchant and Ivory formed the film production company Merchant Ivory Productions. Merchant and Ivory were long-term life partners. Their professional and romantic partnership lasted 44 years, from 1961 until Merchant&#x27;s death in 2005. They were both also involved with the gay composer Richard Robbins, with whom they collaborated on several films.

The Guinness Book of World Records says theirs was the longest partnership in independent cinema history. Until Merchant&#x27;s death in 2005, they produced nearly 40 films, including a number of award winners. Novelist Ruth Prawer Jhabvala was the screenwriter for most of their productions.

In 1963, MIP premiered its first production, &quot;The Householder&quot;, based upon a novel by Jhabvala (who also wrote the screenplay). This feature became the first Indian-made film to be distributed internationally by a major American studio, Columbia Pictures. However, it wasn&#x27;t until the 1970s that partnership &quot;hit on a successful formula for studied, slow-moving pieces ... Merchant Ivory became known for their attention to tiny period detail and opulence of their sets&quot;. Their first success in this style was Jhabvala&#x27;s adaptation of Henry James&#x27;s &quot;The Europeans&quot;.

In addition to producing, Merchant directed a number of films and two TV features. For TV, he directed a short feature entitled &quot;Mahatma and the Mad Boy&quot;, and a full-length feature, &quot;The Courtesans of Bombay&quot;, made for Britain&#x27;s Channel Four. Merchant made his film directorial debut with 1993&#x27;s In Custody based on a novel by Anita Desai, and starring Bollywood actor Shashi Kapoor. Filmed in Bhopal, India, it won National Awards from the Government of India for Best Production Design and Special Jury award for lead actor Shashi Kapoor. His second directing feature, &quot;The Proprietor&quot;, starred Jeanne Moreau, Sean Young, Jean-Pierre Aumont and Christopher Cazenove and was filmed on location in Paris, France.
Of his partnership with Ivory and Jhabvala, Merchant once commented: &quot;It is a strange marriage we have at Merchant Ivory ... I am an Indian Muslim, Ruth is a German Jew, and Jim is a Protestant American. Someone once described us as a three-headed god. Maybe they should have called us a three-headed monster!&quot;

==Cooking and writing==
Merchant was fond of cooking, and he wrote several books including &quot;Ismail Merchant&#x27;s Indian Cuisine&quot;, &quot;Ismail Merchant&#x27;s Florence&quot;, &quot;Ismail Merchant&#x27;s Passionate Meals&quot;, and &quot;Ismail Merchant&#x27;s Paris: Filming and Feasting in France&quot;. He also wrote books on filmmaking, including a book about the making of the film &quot;The Deceivers&quot; in 1988 titled &quot;Hullabaloo in Old Jeypur&quot;, and another about the making of &quot;The Proprietor&quot; called &quot;Once Upon a Time ... The Proprietor&quot;. His last book was entitled &quot;My Passage from India: A Filmmaker&#x27;s Journey from Bombay to Hollywood and Beyond&quot;.

==Death==
Merchant died in Westminster, England aged 68, following surgery for abdominal ulcers. He was buried in Bada Qabrastan Mumbai in Marine Lines, Mumbai, India on 28 May 2005, in keeping with his wish to be buried with his ancestors.

<doc id="1024418" wikidata="Q2117286" url="?curid=1024418" title="Braxton Hicks contractions">
<text>Braxton Hicks contractions, also known as practice contractions or false labor, are sporadic uterine contractions that may start around six weeks into a pregnancy. However, they are usually felt in the second or third trimester of pregnancy.

==Associated conditions==
Braxton Hicks contractions are often confused for labor. Braxton Hicks contractions allow the pregnant woman&#x27;s body to prepare for labor. However, the presence of Braxton Hicks contractions does not mean a woman is in labor or even that labor is about to commence. Another common cause of pain in pregnancy is round ligament pain. 

Table 1. Braxton Hicks contractions vs. true labor
==Pathophysiology==
Although the exact causes of Braxton Hicks contractions are not fully understood, there are known triggers that cause Braxton Hicks contractions, such as when a pregnant woman:

* is dehydrated
* has a full bladder
* has just had sexual intercourse
* has been exercising (running, lifting heavy objects) 
* is under excessive stress
* has had her stomach touched

There are two thoughts for why these intermittent uterine muscle contractions may be occurring. The first is that these early “practice contractions” could be helping to prepare the body for true labor by strengthening the uterine muscle. The second is that these contractions may occur when the fetus is in a state of physiological stress, in order to help provide more oxygenated blood to the fetal circulation.

==Signs and symptoms==
The determination of Braxton Hicks contractions is dependent on the history and physical assessment of the pregnant woman&#x27;s abdomen, as there are no specific imaging tests for diagnosis. The key is to differentiate Braxton Hicks contractions from true labor contractions (see Table 1 above).

Most commonly, Braxton Hicks contractions are weak and feel like mild cramping that occurs in a localized area in the front abdomen at an infrequent and irregular rhythm (usually every 10-20 minutes), with each contraction lasting up to 2 minutes. They may be associated with certain triggers and can disappear and reappear; they do not get more frequent, longer, or stronger over the course of the contractions. However, as the end of a pregnancy approaches, Braxton Hicks contractions tend to become more frequent and more intense.

On a physical exam, some uterine muscle tightening may be palpable, but there should be no palpable contraction in the uterine fundus and no cervical changes or cervical dilation. Braxton Hicks contractions do not lead to birth.

More concerning symptoms that may require assessment by a healthcare professional include:

* Any bleeding or fluid leakage from the vagina
* Contractions that are strong, frequent (every 5 minutes), and persisting for an hour
* Changes or significant decreases in fetal movement

==Management==
Although there is no specific medical treatment for Braxton Hicks contractions, some alleviating factors include:

* Adequate hydration
* Drinking warm milk, herbal tea, or having a small meal
* Urination to empty a full bladder
* Rhythmic breathing
* Lying down on the left side 
* A mild change in movement or activity level 
* Relaxing and de-stressing (e.g., a massage, nap, or warm bath)
* Trying other pain management techniques (e.g., practices from childbirth preparation class)

==History==
Braxton Hicks contractions are named after John Braxton Hicks, the English physician who first wrote about them in Western medicine. In 1872, he investigated the later stages of pregnancy and noted that many pregnant women felt contractions without being near birth. He examined the prevalence of uterine contractions throughout pregnancy and determined that contractions that do not lead to labor are a normal part of pregnancy.

<text>Nordisk Film A/S () is a Danish entertainment company involved in film production and distribution and a subsidiary of Egmont Group. The multimedia entertainment company is also involved in television production, cinemas, computer games and advertising.

The film studio was established in 1906 in Valby, Copenhagen, by filmmaker Ole Olsen. It is the fourth-oldest film studio in the world behind Gaumont, Pathé, and Titanus, and the oldest studio to be continuously active. The logo consists of a polar bear standing on the globe.

==History==
Olsen started his company in the Copenhagen suburb of Valby under the name &quot;Ole Olsen&#x27;s Film Factory,&quot; but soon changed it to the Nordisk Films Kompagnie.

In 1908, Olsen opened an affiliate branch in New York, the Great Northern Film Company, to handle the distribution of his films to the American market. In 1909, having been excluded from the MPPC cartel in the United States, which Olsen had hoped to join, Nordisk participated in the Paris Film Congress in a failed attempt by major European producers to form a similar monopoly. It became a publicly traded company in 1911 as Nordisk Film. During the 1910s, the company created popular silent films with movie stars such as Valdemar Psilander and Clara Pontoppidan.

When Germany invaded Denmark during World War II, the company was locked out of the nationalized German film industry and lost large amounts of revenue.

In 1992, it merged with the Egmont media group, operating as electronic media production and distribution group. The total revenues in 2018 amounted to approximately €559 million.
Nordisk Film is one of the oldest movie production company still in operation in the world. Nordisk Film is the largest producer and distributor of electronic entertainment in the Nordic region.

==Operations==
The company produces and co-produces national and international feature films in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, which are distributed to cinemas around the Nordic countries, including Nordisk Film Cinemas in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. The films are also distributed internationally for viewing in cinemas, on video and on television.

Furthermore, Nordisk Film produces games through a number of game studios invested in by Nordisk Film Games, distributes PlayStation in the Nordic and Baltic countries and develops global digital gifting solutions through GoGift.

Through the Nordisk Film Foundation, Nordisk Film develops danish acting talents with travel scholarships of DKK 10,000 (Lille Isbjørn) or DKK 25,000 (Store Isbjørn).

<text>Chandrayaan-1 (; from Sanskrit: , &quot;Moon&quot; and , &quot;craft, vehicle&quot;) was the first Indian lunar probe under the Chandrayaan programme. It was launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in October 2008, and operated until August 2009. The mission consisted of an orbiter and an impactor. India launched the spacecraft using a PSLV-XL rocket on 22 October 2008 at 00:52 UTC from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, at Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. The mission was a major boost to India&#x27;s space program, as India researched and developed its own technology to explore the Moon. The vehicle was inserted into lunar orbit on 8 November 2008.

On 14 November 2008, the Moon Impact Probe separated from the Chandrayaan orbiter at 14:36 UTC and struck the south pole in a controlled manner. The probe hit near the crater Shackleton at 15:01 UTC. The location of the impact was named Jawahar Point. With this mission, ISRO became the fifth national space agency to reach the lunar surface. Other nations whose national space agencies achieved similar feats were the former Soviet Union in 1959, the United States in 1962, Japan in 1993, and European Space Agency member states in 2006.

The estimated cost for the project was . It was intended to survey the lunar surface for over two years, to produce a complete map of the chemical composition at the surface and its three-dimensional topography. The polar regions were of special interest as there was a high chance of finding water ice. One of its many achievements was the discovery of the widespread presence of water molecules in lunar soil.

After almost a year, the orbiter started experiencing several technical issues including failure of the star tracker and poor thermal shielding; Chandrayaan-1 stopped communicating at about 20:00 UTC on 28 August 2009, shortly after which the ISRO officially declared that the mission was over. Chandrayaan-1 operated for 312 days as opposed to the intended two years; however, the mission achieved most of its scientific objectives, including detecting the presence of Lunar water.

On 2 July 2016, NASA used ground-based radar systems to relocate Chandrayaan-1 in its lunar orbit, almost seven years after it shut down. Repeated observations over the next three months allowed a precise determination of its orbit which varies between in altitude every two years.

== History ==
Former Prime Minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, announced the &quot;Chandrayaan 1&quot; project The mission was a major boost to India&#x27;s space program. The idea of an Indian scientific mission to the Moon was first raised in 1999 during a meeting of the Indian Academy of Sciences. The Astronautical Society of India (ASI) began planning the implementation of such an idea in 2000. Soon after, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) set up the National Lunar Mission Task Force. The Task Force decided that the ISRO had the technical expertise to carry out an Indian mission to the Moon. In April 2003, over 100 Indian scientists spanning fields from planetary science, space sciences, Earth sciences, physics, chemistry, astronomy, astrophysics, engineering, and communication sciences discussed and approved the Task Force recommendation to launch an Indian probe to the Moon. Six months later, in November, the Vajpayee government formally approved the mission.

== Objectives ==
The mission had the following objectives:

* To design, develop, launch, and orbit a spacecraft around the Moon using an Indian-made launch vehicle
* To conduct scientific experiments using instruments on the spacecraft which would yield data:
** for the preparation of a three-dimensional atlas (with high spatial and altitude resolution of ) of both the near and far sides of the Moon
** for chemical and mineralogical mapping of the entire lunar surface at a high spatial resolution, mapping particularly the chemical elements magnesium, aluminum, silicon, calcium, iron, titanium, radon, uranium, and thorium
* To increase scientific knowledge
* To test the impact of a sub-satellite (Moon Impact Probe – MIP) on the surface of the Moon as a forerunner for future soft-landing missions

=== Goals ===
To reach its objective, the mission defined these goals:

* High-resolution mineralogical and chemical imaging of the permanently shadowed north- and south-polar regions
* To search for surface or subsurface lunar water ice, especially at the lunar poles
* Identification of chemicals in lunar highland rocks
* Chemical stratigraphy of the lunar crust by remote sensing of the central uplands of large lunar craters, and of the South Pole Aitken Region (SPAR), an expected site of interior material
* Mapping the height variation of features of the lunar surface
* Observation of X-ray spectrum greater than 10 keV and stereographic coverage of most of the Moon&#x27;s surface with resolution

== Specifications ==

;Mass
: at launch, at lunar orbit, and after releasing the impactor.
;Dimensions
:Cuboid in shape of approximately 
;Communications
: X band, diameter dual gimballed parabolic antenna for payload data transmission. The Telemetry, Tracking &amp; Command (TTC) communication operated in S band frequency.
;Power
:The spacecraft was mainly powered by its solar array, which included one solar panel covering a total area of generating 750 W of peak power, which was stored in a 36 Ampere-hour(A·h) lithium-ion battery for use during eclipses.
;Propulsion
:The spacecraft used a bipropellant integrated propulsion system to reach lunar orbit as well as orbit and altitude maintenance while orbiting the Moon. The power plant consisted of one 440 Newton(N) engine and eight 22 N thrusters. Fuel and oxidizer were stored in two tanks of each.
;Navigation and control
:The craft was 3-axis stabilized with two star sensors, gyros, and four reaction wheels. The spacecraft carried dual redundant bus management units for attitude control, sensor processing, antenna orientation, etc.

== Payload ==
The scientific payload had a mass of . The payload contained five Indian instruments and six instruments from other countries.

=== Indian instruments ===
* TMC or the Terrain Mapping Camera was a CMOS camera with resolution and a swath in the panchromatic band and was used to produce a high-resolution map of the Moon. This instrument aimed to completely map the topography of the Moon. The camera works in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum and captures black-and-white stereo images. When used in conjunction with data from the Lunar Laser Ranging Instrument (LLRI), it can help in a better understanding of the lunar gravitational field as well. TMC was built by the ISRO&#x27;s Space Applications Centre (SAC) at Ahmedabad. The TMC was tested on 29 October 2008 through a set of commands issued from ISTRAC.
* HySI or Hyper Spectral Imager is a CMOS camera, that performs mineralogical mapping in the 400–900 nm band with a spectral resolution of 15 nm and a spatial resolution of .
* LLRI or Lunar Laser Ranging Instrument determines the height of the surface topography by sending pulses of infrared laser light toward the lunar surface and detecting the reflected portion of that light. It operated continuously and collected 10 measurements per second on both the day and night sides of the Moon. LLRI was developed by the Laboratory for Electro-Optics Systems of ISRO, Bangalore. It was tested on 16 November 2008.
* HEX is a High Energy aj/gamma x-ray spectrometer for 30–200 keV measurements with a ground resolution of , the HEX measured Uranium, Thorium, Lead-210, Radon-222 degassing, and other radioactive elements.
* MIP or the Moon Impact Probe developed by the ISRO is an impact probe that consists of a C-band Radar altimeter for measurement of the altitude of the probe, a video imaging system for acquiring images of the lunar surface, and a mass spectrometer for measuring the constituents of the lunar atmosphere. It was ejected at 14:30 UTC on 14 November 2008. As planned, the Moon Impact Probe impacted the lunar south pole at 15:01 UTC on 14 November 2008. ISRO was the fifth national space agency to reach the surface of the Moon. Other national space agencies to have done so prior were the former Soviet Union in 1959, the United States in 1962, Japan in 1993, and ESA in 2006.

=== Instruments from other countries ===

These international contributions were vital to the mission’s success and overall achievements of Chandrayaan 1.
* C1XS or X-ray fluorescence spectrometer covering 1–10 keV, mapped the abundance of Magnesium, Aluminium, Silicon, Calcium, Titanium, and Iron at the surface with a ground resolution of , and monitored solar flux. This payload results from the collaboration between the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, United Kingdom, European Space Agency (ESA) and ISRO. It was activated on 23 November 2008.
* SARA, the Sub-keV Atom Reflecting Analyser from the ESA mapped mineral composition using low energy neutral atoms emitted from the surface.
* M3, the Moon Mineralogy Mapper from Brown University and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL, funded by NASA) was an imaging spectrometer designed to map the surface mineral composition. It was activated on 17 December 2008.
* SIR-2, a near-infrared spectrometer from ESA, was built at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Polish Academy of Science, and University of Bergen. SIR-2 mapped the mineral composition using an infrared grating spectrometer. The instrument is similar to that of the Smart-1 SIR. It was activated on 19 November 2008 and scientific observations were started on 20 November 2008.
* Mini-SAR, designed, built, and tested for NASA by a large team that includes the Naval Air Warfare Center, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman, with outer support from ISRO. Mini-SAR is the active Synthetic Aperture Radar system to search for lunar polar ice and water ice. The instrument transmitted right polarised radiation with a frequency of 2.5 GHz and monitored scattered left and right polarised radiation. The Fresnel reflectivity and the circular polarisation ratio (CPR) are the key parameters deduced from these measurements. Ice shows the Coherent Backscatter Opposition Effect, which results in an enhancement of reflections and CPR so that the water content of the Moon&#x27;s polar regions can be estimated.
* RADOM-7, Radiation Dose Monitor Experiment from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences mapped the radiation environment around the Moon. It was tested on 16 November 2008.

== Mission timeline ==

During the tenure of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the Chandrayaan project got a boost and finally Chandrayaan-1 was launched on 22 October 2008 at 00:52 UTC from Satish Dhawan Space Centre using the ISRO&#x27;s tall, four-stage PSLV C11 launch vehicle. Chandrayaan-1 was sent to the Moon in a series of orbit-increasing manoeuvres around the Earth over a period of 21 days as opposed to launching the craft on a direct trajectory to the Moon. At launch the spacecraft was inserted into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) with an apogee of and a perigee of . The apogee was increased with a series of five orbit burns conducted over a period of 13 days after launch.

For the duration of the mission, ISRO&#x27;s telemetry, tracking and command network (ISTRAC) at Peenya in Bangalore, tracked and controlled Chandrayaan-1. Scientists from India, Europe, and the U.S. conducted a high-level review of Chandrayaan-1 on 29 January 2009 after the spacecraft completed its first 100 days in space.

=== Earth orbit burns ===

;First orbit burn
The first orbit-raising manoeuvre of the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft was performed at 03:30 UTC on 23 October 2008 when the spacecraft&#x27;s 440 Newton liquid engine was fired for about 18 minutes by commanding the spacecraft from Spacecraft Control Centre (SCC) at ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC). With this Chandrayaan-1&#x27;s apogee was raised to , and its perigee to . In this orbit, the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft took about 11 hours to go around the Earth once.

;Second orbit burn
The second orbit-raising manoeuvre of Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft was carried out on 25 October 2008 at 00:18 UTC when the spacecraft&#x27;s engine was fired for about 16 minutes, raising its apogee to , and its perigee to , completing 20 percent of its journey. In this orbit, Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft took about twenty-five and a half hours to go round the Earth once. This was the first time an Indian spacecraft went beyond the high geostationary orbit and reached an altitude more than twice that height.

;Third orbit burn
The third orbit raising manoeuvre was initiated on 26 October 2008 at 01:38 UTC when the spacecraft&#x27;s engine was fired for about nine and a half minutes. With this its apogee was raised to , and the perigee to . In this orbit, Chandrayaan-1 took about 73 hours to go around the Earth once.

;Fourth orbit burn
The fourth orbit-raising maneuver took place on 29 October 2008 at 02:08 UTC when the spacecraft&#x27;s engine was fired for about three minutes, raising its apogee to and the perigee to . This extended its orbit to a distance more than half the way to the Moon. In this orbit, the spacecraft took about six days to go around the Earth once.

;Final orbit burn
The fifth and final orbit raising manoeuvre was carried out on 3 November 2008 at 23:26 UTC when the spacecraft&#x27;s engine was fired for about two and a half minutes resulting in Chandrayaan-1 entering the Lunar Transfer Trajectory with an apogee of about .

=== Lunar orbit insertion ===

Chandrayaan-1 completed the lunar orbit insertion operation on 8 November 2008 at 11:21 UTC. This manoeuvre involved firing of the liquid engine for 817 seconds (about thirteen and half minutes) when the spacecraft passed within from the Moon. The satellite was placed in an elliptical orbit that passed over the polar regions of the Moon, with aposelene and periselene. The orbital period was estimated to be around 11 hours. With the successful completion of this operation, India became the fifth nation to put a vehicle in lunar orbit.

;First orbit reduction
First Lunar Orbit Reduction Manoeuvre of Chandrayaan-1 was carried out on 9 November 2008 at 14:33 UTC. During this, the engine of the spacecraft was fired for about 57 seconds. This reduced the periselene to while aposelene remained unchanged at 7,502 km. In this elliptical orbit, Chandrayaan-1 took about ten and a half hours to circle the Moon once.

;Second orbit reduction
This manoeuvre was carried out on 10 November 2008 at 16:28 UTC, resulting in a steep decrease in Chandrayaan-1&#x27;s aposelene to and its periselene to , During this manoeuvre, the engine was fired for about 866 seconds (about fourteen and a half minutes). Chandrayaan-1 took two hours and 16 minutes to go around the Moon once in this orbit.

;Third orbit reduction
Third Lunar Orbit Reduction was carried out by firing the onboard engine for 31 seconds on 11 November 2008 at 13:00 UTC. This reduced the periselene to , while the aposelene remained constant at 255 km. In this orbit Chandrayaan-1 took two hours and 9 minutes to go around the Moon once.

;Final orbit
Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft was placed into a mission-specific lunar polar orbit of above the lunar surface on 12 November 2008. In the final orbit reduction manoeuvre, Chandrayaan-1&#x27;s aposelene and periselene were both reduced to 100 km. In this orbit, Chandrayaan-1 takes about two hours to go around the Moon once. Two of the 11 payloads—the Terrain Mapping Camera (TMC) and the Radiation Dose Monitor (RADOM)—were switched on. The TMC acquired images of both the Earth and the Moon.

=== Impact of the MIP on the lunar surface ===
The Moon Impact Probe (MIP) crash-landed on the lunar surface on 14 November 2008, 15:01 UTC near the crater Shackleton at the south pole. The MIP was one of eleven scientific instruments (payloads) on board Chandrayaan-1.

The MIP separated from Chandrayaan at 100 km from the lunar surface and began its nosedive at 14:36 UTC, going into free fall for thirty minutes. As it fell, it kept sending information back to the mother satellite which, in turn, beamed the information back to Earth. The altimeter then also began recording measurements to prepare for a rover to land on the lunar surface during a second Moon mission.

Following the deployment of the MIP, the other scientific instruments were turned on, starting the next phase of the mission.

After scientific analyses of the received data from the MIP, the Indian Space Research Organisation confirmed the presence of water in the lunar soil and published the finding in a press conference addressed by its then Chairman G. Madhavan Nair.

=== Rise of spacecraft&#x27;s temperature ===
ISRO had reported on 25 November 2008 that Chandrayaan-1&#x27;s temperature had risen above normal to , Scientists said that it was caused by higher than expected temperatures in lunar orbit. The temperature was brought down by about by rotating the spacecraft about 20 degrees and switching off some of the instruments. Subsequently, ISRO reported on 27 November 2008 that the spacecraft was operating under normal temperature conditions. In subsequent reports ISRO says, since the spacecraft was still recording higher than normal temperatures, it would be running only one instrument at a time until January 2009 when lunar orbital temperature conditions are said to stabilize. It was initially thought that the spacecraft was experiencing high temperature because of radiation from the Sun and infrared radiation reflected by the Moon. However the rise in spacecraft temperature was later attributed to a batch of DC-DC converters with poor thermal regulation.

=== Mapping of minerals ===
The mineral content on the lunar surface was mapped with the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3), a NASA instrument on board the orbiter. The presence of iron was reiterated and changes in rock and mineral composition have been identified. The Oriental Basin region of the Moon was mapped, and it indicates abundance of iron-bearing minerals such as pyroxene.

In 2018 it was announced that M3 infrared data had been re-analyzed to confirm the existence of water across wide expanses of the Moon&#x27;s polar regions.

=== Mapping of Apollo landing sites ===
ISRO announced in January 2009 the completion of the mapping of the Apollo Moon missions landing sites by the orbiter, using multiple payloads. Six of the sites have been mapped, including the landing sites of Apollo 15 and Apollo 17.

=== Image acquisition ===
The craft completed 3,000 orbits acquiring 70,000 images of the lunar surface, which is quite a record compared to the lunar flights of other nations. ISRO officials estimated that if more than 40,000 images have been transmitted by Chandrayaan&#x27;s cameras in 75 days, it worked out to nearly 535 images being sent daily. They were first transmitted to Indian Deep Space Network at Byalalu near Bangalore, from where they were flashed to ISRO&#x27;s Telemetry Tracking And Command Network (ISTRAC) at Bangalore.

Some of these images have a resolution of down to , providing a sharp and clear picture of the Moon&#x27;s surface, while many images sent by some of the other missions had a 100-metre resolution. For comparison, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera has a 0.5 meter resolution.

On 26 November, the Terrain Mapping Camera, which was first activated on 29 October 2008, acquired images of peaks and craters. This came as a surprise to ISRO officials because the Moon consists mostly of craters.

=== Detection of X-Ray signals ===
The X-ray signatures of aluminium, magnesium and silicon were picked up by the C1XS X-ray camera. The signals were picked up during a solar flare that caused an X-ray fluorescence phenomenon. The flare that caused the fluorescence was within the lowest C1XS sensitivity range.

=== Full Earth image ===

On 25 March 2009 Chandrayaan beamed back its first images of the Earth in its entirety. These images were taken with the TMC. Previous imaging was done on only one part of the Earth. The new images show Asia, parts of Africa and Australia with India being in the centre.

=== Orbit raised to 200 km ===
After the completion of all the major mission objectives, the orbit of Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft, which had been at a height of from the lunar surface since November 2008, was raised to . The orbit-raising manoeuvres were carried out between 03:30 and 04:30 UTC on 19 May 2009. The spacecraft at this higher altitude enabled further studies on orbit perturbations and gravitational field variation of the Moon and also enabled imaging of the lunar surface with a wider swath. It was later revealed that the true reason for the orbit change was that it was an attempt to keep the temperature of the probe down. It was &quot;...assumed that the temperature [of the spacecraft subsystems] at 100 km above the Moon&#x27;s surface would be around 75 degrees Celsius. However, it was more than 75 degrees and problems started to surface. We had to raise the orbit to 200 km.&quot;

=== Attitude sensor failure ===
The star tracker, a device used for pointing attitude determination (orientation), failed in orbit after nine months of operation. Afterward, the orientation of Chandrayaan was determined using a back-up procedure using a two-axis Sun sensor and taking a bearing from an Earth station. This was used to update three axis gyroscopes which enabled spacecraft operations. The second failure, detected on 16 May, was attributed to excessive radiation from the Sun.

=== Radar scans ===
On 21 August 2009 Chandrayaan-1 along with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter attempted to perform a bistatic radar experiment using their Mini-SAR radars to detect the presence of water ice on the lunar surface. The attempt was a failure; it turned out the Chandrayaan-1 radar was not pointed at the Moon during the experiment.

The Mini-SAR has imaged many of the permanently shadowed regions that exist at both poles of the Moon. In March 2010, it was reported that the Mini-SAR on board the Chandrayaan-1 had discovered more than 40 permanently darkened craters near the Moon&#x27;s north pole which are hypothesized to contain an estimated 600 million metric tonnes of water-ice. The radar&#x27;s high CPR is not uniquely diagnostic of either roughness or ice; the science team must take into account the environment of the occurrences of high CPR signal to interpret its cause. The ice must be relatively pure and at least a couple of meters thick to give this signature. The estimated amount of water ice potentially present is comparable to the amount estimated from the previous mission of Lunar Prospector&#x27;s neutron data.

Although the results are consistent with recent findings of other NASA instruments onboard Chandrayaan-1 (the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (MP3) discovered water molecules in the Moon&#x27;s polar regions, while water vapour was detected by NASA&#x27;s Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or LCROSS) this observation is not consistent with the presence of thick deposits of nearly pure water ice within a few meters of the lunar surface, but it does not rule out the presence of small (&lt;~10cm), discrete pieces of ice mixed in with the regolith.

== End of the mission ==
The mission was expected to operate for two years. However, around 20:00 UTC on 28 August 2009 communication with the spacecraft was suddenly lost. The probe had operated for 312 days. The craft had been expected to remain in orbit for approximately another 1000 days and to crash into the lunar surface in late 2012, although in 2016 it was found to still be in orbit.

A member of the science advisory board of Chandrayaan-1 said that it is difficult to ascertain reasons for the loss of contact. ISRO Chairman G. Madhavan Nair said that due to very high radiation, power-supply units controlling both the computer systems on board failed, snapping the communication connectivity. However, information released later showed that the power supply supplied by MDI failed due to overheating.

Although the mission was less than 10 months in duration, and less than half the intended two years in length, a review by scientists termed the mission successful, as it had completed 95% of its primary objectives.

== Results ==
Chandrayaan&#x27;s NASA Instrument Moon Mineralogy Mapper has confirmed the magma ocean hypothesis, meaning that the Moon was once completely molten. The terrain mapping camera (TMC) on board Chandrayaan-1, besides producing more than 70,000 three dimensional images, has recorded images of the landing site of U.S. spacecraft Apollo 15.

The TMC and HySI payloads of ISRO have covered about 70% of the lunar surface, while M3 covered more than 95% of the same and SIR-2 has provided high-resolution spectral data on the mineralogy of the Moon.

Indian Space Research Organisation said interesting data on lunar polar areas was provided by Lunar Laser Ranging Instrument (LLRI) and High Energy X-ray Spectrometer (HEX) of ISRO as well as Miniature Synthetic Aperture Radar (Mini-SAR) of the US.

The LLRI covered both the lunar poles and additional lunar regions of interest, HEX made about 200 orbits over the lunar poles and Mini-SAR provided complete coverage of both North and South Polar Regions of the Moon.

Another ESA payload – Chandrayaan-1 imaging X-ray Spectrometer (C1XS) – detected more than two dozen weak solar flares during the mission duration. The Bulgarian payload called Radiation Dose Monitor (RADOM) was activated on the day of the launch itself and worked until the mission&#x27;s end.

ISRO said scientists from India and participating agencies expressed satisfaction on the performance of Chandrayaan-1 mission as well as the high quality of data sent by the spacecraft.

They have started formulating science plans based on the data sets obtained from the mission. It is expected that in the next few months, interesting results about lunar topography, mineral and chemical contents of the Moon and related aspects are expected to be published.

The Chandrayaan-1 payload has enabled scientists to study the interaction between the solar wind and a planetary body like the Moon without a magnetic field.

In its 10-month orbit around the Moon, Chandrayaan-1&#x27;s X-ray Spectrometer (C1XS) detected titanium, confirmed the presence of calcium, and gathered the most accurate measurements yet of magnesium, aluminium and iron on the lunar surface.

=== Lunar water discovery ===
On 18 November 2008, the Moon Impact Probe was released from Chandrayaan-1 at a height of . During its 25 minute descent, Chandra&#x27;s Altitudinal Composition Explorer (CHACE) recorded evidence of water in 650 mass spectra readings gathered during this time. On 24 September 2009 &quot;Science&quot; journal reported that the NASA Instrument Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) on Chandrayaan-1 had detected water ice on the Moon. But, on 25 September 2009, ISRO announced that the MIP, another instrument on board Chandrayaan-1, had discovered water on the Moon just before impact and had discovered it 3 months before NASA&#x27;s M3. The announcement of this discovery was not made until NASA confirmed it.

M3 detected absorption features near 2.8–3.0 μm on the surface of the Moon. For silicate bodies, such features are typically attributed to hydroxyl- and/or water bearing materials. On the Moon, the feature is seen as a widely distributed absorption that appears strongest at cooler high latitudes and at several fresh feldspathic craters. The general lack of correlation of this feature in sunlit M3 data with neutron spectrometer H abundance data suggests that the formation and retention of OH and H2O is an ongoing surficial process. OH/H2O production processes may feed polar cold traps and make the lunar regolith a candidate source of volatiles for human exploration.

The Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3), an imaging spectrometer, came to a premature end on 28 August 2009. M3 was aimed at providing the first mineral map of the entire lunar surface. M3 data were reanalyzed years later and revealed &quot;the most definitive proof to date&quot; of the presence of water in shaded regions of craters near the Moon&#x27;s north and south poles.

Lunar scientists had discussed the possibility of water repositories for decades. They are now increasingly &quot;confident that the decades-long debate is over&quot; a report says. &quot;The Moon, in fact, has water in all sorts of places; not just locked up in minerals, but scattered throughout the broken-up surface, and, potentially, in blocks or sheets of ice at depth.&quot; The results from the Chandrayaan mission are also &quot;offering a wide array of watery signals.&quot;

=== Lunar water production ===
According to European Space Agency (ESA) scientists, the lunar regolith (a loose collection of irregular dust grains making up the Moon&#x27;s surface) absorbs hydrogen nuclei from solar winds. Interaction between the hydrogen nuclei and oxygen present in the dust grains is expected to produce hydroxyl () and water ().

The SARA (Sub keV Atom Reflecting Analyser) instrument developed by ESA and the Indian Space Research Organisation was designed and used to study the Moon&#x27;s surface composition and solar-wind/surface interactions. SARA&#x27;s results highlight a mystery: not every hydrogen nucleus is absorbed. One out of every five proton rebounds into space, combining with electron to form an atom of hydrogen. Hydrogen shoots off at speeds of around and escapes without being deflected by the Moon&#x27;s weak gravity. This knowledge provides timely advice for scientists who are readying ESA&#x27;s &quot;BepiColombo&quot; mission to Mercury, as that spacecraft will carry two instruments similar to SARA.

=== Lunar caves ===
Chandrayaan-1 imaged a lunar rille, formed by an ancient lunar lava flow, with an uncollapsed segment indicating the presence of a lunar lava tube, a type of large cave below the lunar surface. The tunnel, which was discovered near the lunar equator, is an empty volcanic tube, measuring about in length and in width. According to A. S. Arya, scientist SF of Ahmedabad-based Space Application Centre (SAC), this could be a potential site for human settlement on the Moon. Earlier, Japanese Lunar orbiter SELENE (Kaguya) also recorded evidence for other caves on the Moon.

=== Tectonism ===
Data from the microwave sensor (Mini-SAR) of Chandrayaan-1 processed using the image analysis software ENVI, has revealed a good amount of past tectonic activity on the lunar surface. The researchers think that the faults and fractures discovered could be features of past interior tectonic activity coupled with meteorite impacts.

The data was split into two sections with the first section going public by the end of 2010 and the second going public by the middle of 2011. The data contained pictures of the Moon and also data of chemical and mineral mapping of the lunar surface.

== Follow-up missions ==

&quot;Chandrayaan-2&quot; is a follow-up mission which was launched on 22 July 2019. The mission includes a lunar orbiter, a lander named &quot;Vikram&quot; and a robotic lunar rover named &quot;Pragyan&quot;. While a last-minute glitch in the landing guidance software resulted in the lander crashing, the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter is operational .

<text>The Seven Sisters () are a group of seven skyscrapers in Moscow designed in the Stalinist style. They were built from 1947 to 1953. At the time of construction, they were the tallest buildings in Europe, and the main building of Moscow State University remained the tallest building in Europe until 1990.

The seven are: Hotel Ukraina, Kotelnicheskaya Embankment Apartments, the Kudrinskaya Square Building, the Hilton Moscow Leningradskaya Hotel, the main building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the main building of Moscow State University, and the Red Gates Administrative Building. There were two more skyscrapers in the same style planned that were never built: the Zaryadye Administrative Building and the Palace of the Soviets.

==History==

The construction of the first Soviet skyscraper project, the Palace of the Soviets, was interrupted by the German invasion of 1941, at which point the steel frame was scrapped in order to fortify the Moscow defense ring, and the site was abandoned. Between 1947 and 1956, Boris Iofan presented six new drafts for this site, and also for Vorobyovy Gory on a smaller scale—they were all rejected. In 1946, Stalin personally switched to another idea—construction of &quot;vysotki&quot;, a chain of reasonably-sized skyscrapers not tarnished by the memories of the Comintern. As Nikita Khrushchev recalled Stalin&#x27;s words, &quot;We won the war ... foreigners will come to Moscow, walk around, and there are &quot;no skyscrapers&quot;. If they compare Moscow to capitalist cities, it&#x27;s a moral blow to us&quot;. Sites were selected in between January 1947 (the official decree on &quot;vysotki&quot;) and September 12, 1947 (formal opening ceremony).

Nothing is known about selection of construction sites or design evaluation; this process (1947–1948) was kept secret, a sign of Stalin&#x27;s personal tight management. Old professionals like Shchusev, Zholtovsky etc., were not involved. Instead, the job was given to the next generation of mature architects. In 1947, the oldest of them, Vladimir Gelfreikh, was 62. The youngest, Mikhail Posokhin, was 37. Individual commissions were ranked according to each architect&#x27;s status, and clearly segmented into two groups—four &quot;first-class&quot; and four &quot;second-class&quot; towers. Job number one, a Vorobyovy Gory tower that would become Moscow State University, was awarded to Lev Rudnev, a new leader of his profession. Rudnev received his commission only in September 1948, and employed hundreds of professional designers. He released his draft in early 1949. Dmitry Chechulin received two commissions.

In April 1949, the winner of the Stalin Prize for 1948 was announced. All eight design teams received first and second class awards, according to their project status, regardless of their architectural value. At this stage, these were conceptual drafts; often one would be cancelled and others would be altered.

All the buildings employed over-engineered steel frames with concrete ceilings and masonry infill, based on concrete slab foundations (in the case of the university building—7 meters thick). Exterior ceramic tiles, panels up to 15 square meters, were secured with stainless steel anchors. The height of these buildings was not limited by political will, but by lack of technology and experience—the structures were far heavier than American skyscrapers.

The effect of this project on real urban needs can be seen from these numbers:
*In 1947, 1948, and 1949 respectively, Moscow built a total of 100,000, 270,000, and 405,000 square meters of housing.
*The skyscraper project exceeded 500,000 square meters (at a higher cost per meter)
In other words, the resources diverted for this project effectively halved housing construction rates. On the other hand, the new construction plants, built for this project (like Kuchino Ceramics), were fundamental to Khrushchev&#x27;s residential program just a few years later.

==Moscow buildings==
Buildings are listed under their current names, in the same order as they appeared in the April 1949 Stalin Prize decree. Different sources report different number of levels and height, depending on inclusion of mechanical floors and uninhabited crown levels.

===Moscow State University===

Boris Iofan made a mistake placing his draft skyscraper right on the edge of Vorob&#x27;yovskie Gory. The site was a potential landslide hazard. He made a worse mistake by insisting on his decision and was promptly replaced by Lev Rudnev, a 53-year-old rising star of Stalin&#x27;s establishment. Rudnev had already built high-profile edifices like the 1932–1937 M. V. Frunze Military Academy and the 1947 &quot;Marshals&#x27; Apartments&quot; (Sadovaya-Kudrinskaya, 28), which earned the highest credits of the Party. He set the building 800 meters away from the cliff.

The building was constructed in part by several thousand Gulag inmates. When the construction was nearing completion, some inmates were housed on the 24th and 25th levels to reduce transportation costs and the number of guards required.

The main tower, which consumed over 40,000 metric tons of steel, was inaugurated on September 1, 1953. At 787.4 feet or 240 meters tall, it was the tallest building in Europe from its completion until 1990. It is still the tallest educational building in the world.
===Hotel Ukraina===

&quot;Ukraina&quot; by Arkady Mordvinov and Vyacheslav Oltarzhevsky (leading Soviet expert on steel-framed highrise construction) is the second tallest of the &quot;sisters&quot; (198 meters, 34 levels). It was the tallest hotel in the world from the time of its construction until the Peachtree Plaza Hotel opened in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1975.

Construction on the low river bank meant that the builders had to dig well below the water level. This was solved by an ingenious water retention system, using a perimeter of &quot;needle pumps&quot; driven deep into ground.

The hotel reopened its doors again after a 3-year-renovation on April 28, 2010, now a part of Radisson Collection Hotels Group, Moscow, with 505 bedrooms and 38 apartments. The hotel was acquired by billionaire property investor God Nisanov for £59 million during an auction in 2005. He co-owns it with Zarakh Iliev.
===Ministry of Foreign Affairs===

This 172-meter, 27-story building was built between 1948 and 1953 and overseen by V. G. Gelfreih and A. B. Minkus. Currently, it houses the offices for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the Russian Federation. The Ministry is covered by a light external stone wall with projecting pilasters and pylons. Its interior is splendidly decorated with stones and metals. According to the 1982 biography of Minkus, draft plans were first drawn up in 1946 and ranged from 9 to 40 stories. In 1947 two designs were proposed: one used layered setbacks while the other called for a more streamlined construction which culminated into a blunt rectangular top. The second proposal was accepted but as the Ministry&#x27;s completion neared, a metal spire, dyed to match the building&#x27;s exterior (and presumably ordered by Joseph Stalin), was hastily added to tower&#x27;s roof, assimilating its silhouette with those of the other Sisters.
===Leningradskaya Hotel===

Originally known simply as the Leningradskaya Hotel, this relatively small (136 meters, 26 floors, of which 19 are usable) building by Leonid Polyakov on Komsomolskaya Square is decorated with pseudo-Russian ornaments mimicking Alexey Shchusev&#x27;s Kazansky Rail Terminal. Inside, it was inefficiently planned. Khrushchev, in his 1955 decree &quot;On liquidation of excesses ...&quot; asserted that at least 1,000 rooms could be built for the cost of Leningradskaya&#x27;s 354, that only 22% of the total space was rentable, and that the costs per bed were 50% higher than in &quot;Moskva&quot; Hotel. Following this critique, Polyakov was stripped of his 1948 Stalin Prize but retained the other one, for a Moscow Metro station. After a multimillion-dollar renovation ending in 2008, the hotel re-opened as the Hilton Moscow Leningradskaya.
===Kotelnicheskaya Embankment Building===

Another of Chechulin&#x27;s works, 176 meters high, with 22 usable levels, the Kotelnicheskaya Embankment Building was strategically placed at the confluence of the Moskva River and Yauza River. The building incorporates an earlier 9-story apartment block facing Moskva River, by the same architects (completed in 1940). It was intended as an elite housing building. However, very soon after construction, units were converted to multi-family kommunalka (communal apartments). Its design was neo-gothic, though it also drew inspiration from Hotel Metropol.
===Kudrinskaya Square Building===

Designed by Mikhail Posokhin (Sr.) and Ashot Mndoyants. 160 metres tall, 22 floors (18 usable in the wings and 22 in the central part). The building is located on the end of Krasnaya Presnya street, facing the Sadovoye Koltso and was primarily built as high-end apartments for Soviet cultural leaders rather than politicians.
===Red Gate Administrative Building===
Designed by Alexey Dushkin of the Moscow Metro fame, this mixed-use block of 11-storey buildings is crowned with a slim tower (total height 133 meters, 24 levels).

In this case, cryotechnology was indeed used for the escalator tunnels connecting the building with the Krasniye Vorota subway station. The building&#x27;s frame was erected deliberately tilted to one side; when the frozen soil thawed, it settled down – although not enough for a perfect horizontal level. Then the builders warmed the soil by pumping hot water; this worked too well, and the structure slightly overreacted, tilting to the opposite side but well within tolerance.
===Zaryadye Administrative Building (never built)===

In 1934, the Commissariat for Heavy Industries initiated a design contest for its new building on Red Square (on the site of State Universal Store, GUM). A last showcase for constructivists, this contest didn&#x27;t materialize and GUM still stands.

In 1947, the nearby medieval Zaryadye district was razed to make way for the new 32-story, 275-meter tower (the numbers are quoted as in the 1951 finalized draft). It is sometimes associated with the Ministry of Heavy Machinery, the same institution that ran a contest in 1934. However, in all public documents of this time its name is simply the &quot;administrative building&quot;, without any specific affiliation. Likewise, association with Lavrentiy Beria is mostly anecdotal.

The tower, designed by Chechulin, was supposed to be the second largest after the university. Eventually, the plans were cancelled at the foundation stage; these foundations were used later for the construction of the Rossiya Hotel (also by Chechulin, 1967, demolished 2006–2007).

==Other cities==

While many cities in the former USSR and former Soviet Bloc countries have Stalinist skyscrapers, few fall in the same league as the Moscow &quot;vysotki&quot;. Of these three, &quot;Hotel Ukraina&quot; in Kyiv was completed in stripped-down form, without the tower and steeple originally planned for them.

===Kyiv: Hotel Moscow – Hotel Ukraina===

Plans to build a skyscraper on the site of the destroyed Ginzburg Hotel emerged in 1948, but the design was finalized by Anatoly Dobrovolsky as late as 1954, when Stalinist architecture was already doomed. Building work proceeded slowly, with numerous political orders to make it simpler and cheaper. It was completed in 1961, without a tower, steeple and any original ornaments.

===Warsaw: Palace of Culture and Science, 1952–1955===

Another design by Lev Rudnev, with Polish Renaissance Revival detailing. Built in 1952–1955 (topped out October 1953). Construction plans were agreed upon on April 5, 1952, and sealed during Vyacheslav Molotov&#x27;s visit in Warsaw on July 3 of the same year (after the opening ceremony on May 1). The Soviets planned it as a university, but the Polish side insisted on its current administrative function. A workforce of around 7,000 was nearly evenly split between Poles and imported Soviet laborers; 16 were presumably killed during the work. The building remained the tallest in Poland until the Varso Tower, a modern glass skyscraper, was constructed in Warsaw in 2021.

===Bucharest: House of the Free Press, 1952–1956===
Construction began in 1952 and was completed in 1956. The building was named &quot;Combinatul Poligrafic Casa Scînteii &quot;I.V.Stalin&quot;&quot; and later &quot;Casa Scînteii&quot; (&quot;Scînteia&quot; was the name of the Romanian Communist Party&#x27;s official newspaper). It was designed by the architect Horia Maicu, and was intended to house all of Bucharest&#x27;s printing presses, the newsrooms and their staff. Its height is without the television antenna, which measures an additional .

===Prague: Hotel Družba, 1952–1954===

The largest Stalinist architecture building in Prague, Czech Republic. The building was built between 1952 and 1954 at the order of Defence minister Alexej Čepička. It is 88 m high (the roof is 67 m, plus a 10 m chalice and a 1.5 m red star) and has sixteen floors. Part of the building was a fallout shelter for 600 people, currently used as a staff clothes room.

===Riga: Latvian Academy of Sciences, 1951–1961===
Initially planned as House of Kolkhoz workers (&quot;Kolhoznieku nams&quot;), construction was started in 1951 and finished in 1958, although the building was officially opened only in 1961. Upon finishing the building was turned over to the Latvian Academy of Sciences. It has 21 floors and a conference hall that seats 1,000 people.

The 108-meter high Academy is not the tallest building in Riga. Unlike other &quot;vysotki&quot;, which are based on a steel frame with masonry infill, this is a reinforced concrete structure, the first of its kind in the USSR.
==Related buildings==

Many Stalinist buildings have tower crowns, but they do not belong to the &quot;vysotki&quot; project and their style is completely different. This is evident in Chechulin&#x27;s Peking Hotel building. Seen from a low point of the Garden Ring south, it could be mistaken for a skyscraper, but if viewed from Triumfalnaya Square it is clear that the building is far less imposing. There are also several smaller Stalinesque towers in Barnaul, St. Petersburg and other cities. Design and construction of such towers became widespread in the early 1950s, although many ongoing projects were cancelled in 1955, when regional &quot;skyscrapers&quot; were specifically addressed by Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s decree &quot;On liquidation of architectural excesses...&quot; as unacceptable expense.

===Triumph Palace, Moscow, 2003===
The high-profile Triumph Palace tower in north-western Moscow (3, Chapayevsky Lane), completed in December 2003, attempts to imitate the &quot;vysotki&quot;, and actually exceeds the university building in structural height. It is criticized for being placed deeply inside a residential mid-rise area, away from major avenues and squares, where it could be an important visual anchor. A close inspection reveals that this white and red tower has little in common with Stalinist style, except for sheer size and layered tower outline. It competes for the &#x27;Eighth Vysotka&#x27; title with an earlier Edelweiss Tower in western Moscow. Construction began in 2001. The 57-story building, containing about 1,000 luxury apartments, was topped out on December 20, 2003, and, at the time, was Europe&#x27;s tallest building at 264.1 metres or 867 feet.
===Triumph Astana, 2006===

The Triumph Tower of Astana is a , 39-story residential building in the Kazakhstan capital that was completed in 2006. Modeled after 1950s Soviet high-rise buildings, the complex includes a cinema, restaurants, a center of children&#x27;s development, and a shopping center.

<text>Zhou Zuoren () (16 January 1885 – 6 May 1967) was a Chinese writer, primarily known as an essayist and a translator. He was the younger brother of Lu Xun (Zhou Shuren, 周树人), the second of three brothers.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, Zhou Zuoren was educated at the Jiangnan Naval Academy as a teenager before moving to Japan in 1906, following his brother&#x27;s footsteps. During his stint in Japan, he began studying Ancient Greek, with the aim of translating the &quot;Gospels&quot; into Classical Chinese, and attended lectures on Chinese philology by scholar-revolutionary Zhang Binglin at Rikkyo University, although he was supposed to study civil engineering there. He returned to China in 1911, with his Japanese wife, and began to teach in different institutions.

===During the May Fourth Movement===

Writing essays in vernacular Chinese for the magazine &quot;La Jeunesse&quot;, Zhou was a figure in the May Fourth Movement as well as the New Culture Movement. He was an advocate of literary reform. In 1918, Zhou Zuoren, then a literature professor at Peking University, published an article titled &quot;Human Literature&quot;, insisting on mutual understanding and sympathy between each other, and required a &quot;recognition of the existence of the same kind&quot;. In the article, he attacked specifically such thematics in literature as children sacrificing themselves for the sake of their parents and wives being buried alive to accompany dead husbands. Meanwhile, Zhou made a distinction between &quot;democratic&quot; and &quot;popular&quot; literature by identifying the former as literature that studies human life rather than written for the common people to read. Zhou condemned elite traditional performances like the Beijing opera. He called it &quot;disgusting,&quot; &quot;nauseating,&quot; &quot;pretentious&quot; and referred to the singing as &quot;a weird inhuman sound.&quot;

===Later life===

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Zhou is seen as a collaborator with the Japanese occupation, and has been regarded by some Japanese as one of the three Chinese in modern times who &quot;truly understands Japan&quot;. In 1945, Zhou was arrested for treason by the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek, stemming from his alleged collaboration with the Wang Jingwei government during the Japanese occupation of north China. He was sentenced to 10 years&#x27; imprisonment in 1947. In January 1949, shortly before the liberation, the Nationalist Party Government with the temporary President Li Zongren decided to release some people under detention. As one of them, Zhou Zuoren was released on bail and went back to Beijing.

In the next 17 years, Zhou continued to translate classical Japanese traditional and classical Greek literature. However, during the Cultural Revolution, the People&#x27;s Literature Publishing House no longer paid royalty to Zhou Zuoren, which used to be his sole source of income. On May 6, 1967, Zhou Zuoren died of a sudden relapse of the illness. During the first decades of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Zhou Zuoren&#x27;s writings were not widely available to readers due to his alleged treason. Only during the relatively liberal 1980s did his works become available again. The Chinese scholar Qian Liqun (錢理群) in 2001 published an extensive biography of Zhou Zuoren entitled &quot;Biography of Zhou Zuoren&quot; (周作人传).

== Literature Interests ==
He called his studies &quot;miscellanies&quot; and penned an essay titled &quot;My Miscellaneous Studies&quot; (我的雜學). In Tokyo, Zhou developed interests in mythology, anthropology, and what he called ertongxue (兒童學; the study of children development). He later became a translator, producing translations of classical Greek and classical Japanese literatures, including a collection of Greek mimes, Sappho&#x27;s lyrics, Euripides&#x27; tragedies, &quot;Kojiki&quot;, Shikitei Sanba&#x27;s &quot;Ukiyoburo&quot;, Sei Shōnagon&#x27;s &quot;Makura no Sōshi&quot; and a collection of &quot;Kyogen&quot;. He considered his translation of Lucian&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues&quot;, which he finished late in his life, as his greatest literary achievement. He was also translated (from English) the story &quot;Ali Baba&quot; into Chinese (known as &quot;Xianü Nu&quot; 俠女奴). During the 1930s he was also a regular contributor to Lin Yutang&#x27;s humor magazine &quot;The Analects Fortnightly&quot; and wrote extensively about China&#x27;s traditions of humor, satire, parody, and joking, even compiling a collection of &quot;Jokes from the Bitter Tea Studio&quot; (&quot;Kucha&#x27;an xiaohua ji&quot;). He became chancellor of Beijing University in 1939.

== Philosophical Stance ==
In his early work, Zhou Zuoren denied the legitimacy of violence as a force for modernizing China, but rather sought social change and intellectual engagement through nonviolence. Before the 1920s, his literary and philosophical views agreed with the essential aspects of Romanticism, which impulses set him apart from other major literary and intellectual figures as his motives in participating in the New Culture Movement had much less or little to do with any apocalyptic vision or transcendental aspiration. During the May Fourth era, he continued commitment to what he called &quot;individualist humanism&quot;, but eventually abandoned this ideology after witnessing increasingly violent tendencies that were out of the idealism of the May Fourth movement. As he wrote in 1926, &quot;class struggle was not a Marxist invention but true as the Darwinian idea of competition for survival&quot;. After the May Fourth Movement, Zhou sought to retreat from the nation-building project into individual and ordinary life.

Between 1940 and 1943, Zhou used Confucianism as a guise to argue that the Chinese never had any &quot;thought problem,&quot; as the Japanese so claimed. By comparing the Confucianism development in China to a tree, he asserted that &quot;the tree can grow up again if there was no outside interference through either restraint or artificial cultivation.&quot; However, after the war, his profuse textual language and artistic attitude were also seen to align with the spirit of Daoism thoughts. In 1944, he explained: &quot;According to my own observations and experience, I have an opinion that is incompatible with the time, which is my two not-to-be-isms. First, I don&#x27;t want to be a follower; second, I don&#x27;t want to be a leader. Although I labeled myself a Confucian, this attitude actually belongs to Daoism. However, since I cannot retreat fully, I still have no way to avoid conflicts&quot;.

<text>Trinity College, Bristol is an evangelical Anglican theological college located in Stoke Bishop, Bristol, England. It offers a range of full-time and part-time taught undergraduate and postgraduate courses which are validated by the University of Durham through the Common Awards Scheme, though the college sets its own curriculum. Many of its students are training for ordination in the Church of England; and hence there is a strong vocational aspect to the courses it provides. It also has students of other Christian denominations, as well as students who are intending to serve within various forms of lay ministry. The college also has a significant number of students studying for research degrees at masters and doctoral levels. All of Trinity&#x27;s postgraduate research courses are validated by the University of Aberdeen.

It runs an evening programme for students from a number of Christian denominations, as well as those training for ordained and lay ministry in the Diocese of Bristol.

==History==

Trinity College, Bristol was formed in 1971 from a merger of three evangelical colleges in Bristol: Clifton College, Dalton House with St Michaels, and Tyndale Hall. Trinity College, Bristol is rooted in the evangelical tradition (and is affiliated to the Evangelical Alliance) but offers training to Christians from a variety of theological traditions.
All of the colleges had their origins in the Bible Churchmen&#x27;s Missionary Society (BCMS, now Crosslinks). The Bible Missionary Training College opened in Bristol in 1925, and was recognised by the Church of England in 1927. The BCMS college faced great difficulties in its early days. Its conservative evangelical constituency was numerically and financially weak. The staff split over the issue of subscription to BCMS&#x27; doctrinal basis, and those who did not view subscription as essential left to form Clifton Theological College. Subsequently, Dalton House was opened to train women. The Principal of the men&#x27;s college (C.S.Carter) resigned in the early 1930s after dismissing a student. It was renamed Tyndale Hall in 1952.

An earlier attempt at merger in the 1960s was poorly handled and resulted in considerable conflict.

In the years following its opening, Trinity College developed an international reputation for its evangelical scholarship, particularly in the field of biblical studies. With the appointment of George Carey as principal in 1982, the college experienced significant growth in student numbers and became known for its openness to charismatic spirituality.

In September 1997, Trinity College Bristol formed the Bristol Federation with Bristol Baptist College, Wesley College, and the West of England Ministerial Training Course (WEMTC). Following the later closure of Wesley College and the move of WEMTC, Trinity College continues a close relationship with Bristol Baptist College as federated institutions, sharing common courses.

==Notable staff==

The current faculty includes Helen Collins, Sean Doherty, Paul Roberts, David Firth, J.P. Davies, Taido Chino, and Howard Worsley.

==Stoke House==
Stoke House, the building that forms the main front of Trinity College, has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building. It was built by Sir Robert Cann and probably completed in 1669. This date is above the front door in rather untrustworthy lettering (which may have been added much later). However, the date fits with the building&#x27;s style and other documentary evidence.
The doorway is certainly Jacobean in character, including excessively twisted columns of three wound strands, with naive Corinthian capitals containing a mask each. The spandrels above the door contain allegorical females either side of the Cann family crest. The sidewalls of the porch are typical of &quot;c.&quot;1670 with upright oval windows keyed into oblong panels, here under steep open pediments. The oak staircase within the building is characteristically mid-seventeenth century. The three ogee gables along the front roofline are also quite Jacobean in character, but the rest of house is much altered. The original cross windows (&quot;cf.&quot; J. Kip&#x27;s 1712 engraving) were replaced with gothic versions &quot;c.&quot; 1750 as shown in John Turner&#x27;s 1791 painting of the house. In 1872 &quot;Foster &amp; Wood&quot; installed mullioned-and-transomed windows in double-height canted bays with projecting curved centres and strapwork cresting. They also reinstated the oval windows in the gables with reference to those in the porch. Two rooftop cupolas were removed in the twentieth century. At the rear of the building two three-story blocks were added in the seventeenth century, one at an angle to the house.

<text>Antonio de Mendoza (1495 – 21 July 1552) was a Spanish colonial administrator who was the first viceroy of New Spain, serving from 14 November 1535 to 25 November 1550, and the second viceroy of Peru, from 23 September 1551, until his death on 21 July 1552.

Mendoza was born at Alcalá la Real (Jaén, Spain), the son of the 2nd Count of Tendilla Íñigo López de Mendoza y Quiñones, and Francisca Pacheco. He was married to María Ana de Trujillo de Mendoza.

==Viceroy of New Spain==
Mendoza became Viceroy of New Spain in 1535 and governed for 15 years, longer than any subsequent viceroy. On his arrival in New Spain, he found a recently conquered territory beset with Indigenous unrest and rivalry among the Spanish conquerors and Spanish settlers. His difficult assignment was to govern in the king&#x27;s name without making an enemy of Hernán Cortés. Cortés himself had expected to be made the permanent ruling crown official of New Spain, since he had led the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. The Emperor Charles V (King Charles I of Spain) and the Council of the Indies judged Cortés too independent of crown authority to be made viceroy and had created a high court (&quot;audiencia&quot;) in New Spain in 1528, appointing Nuño de Guzmán, a rival of Cortés as its president to counter Cortés&#x27;s power. In 1530 the crown granted Cortés the title of the Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca with multiple encomiendas. With the arrival of Viceroy Mendoza in 1535, Cortés pursued his own economic interests from his palace in Cuernavaca.

Although the Spanish had occupied and expanded explorations, conquest, and settlement in the Caribbean, it was not until the conquest of central Mexico that the crown appointed a viceroy (vice king), who would be the king&#x27;s living image in Mexico and envisioned to effectively assert royal authority in the Kingdom of New Spain. To further cement his authority and establish a solid society he established marital alliances with powerful settlers committed to the development of New Spain, such as Marina de la Caballería. Mendoza&#x27;s status as a noble and his family&#x27;s loyalty to the Spanish crown made him a suitable candidate for appointment.

Don Antonio and Bishop Juan de Zumárraga were key in the formation of two institutions of Mexico: the Colegio de Santa Cruz at Tlatelolco (1536), where the sons of Aztec nobles studied Latin, rhetoric, philosophy and music, and the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico (1552), modeled on the University of Salamanca, which trained young men for the Catholic Church. These institutions were the first and second universities respectively to be established in the mainland of the Americas. In 1536 he began the minting of silver and copper coins, known as &quot;macuquinas&quot;. Also under his instructions, the first printing press in the New World was brought to Mexico in 1539, by printer Juan Pablos (Giovanni Paoli). The first book printed in Mexico: &quot;La Escala Espiritual de San Juan Clímaco&quot;. On 18 May 1541 don Antonio founded the city of Valladolid (now Morelia, Michoacán).

When the Spanish crown issued the New Laws that put restrictions on the grants of elite conquerors awarded grants of labor &quot;encomenderos&quot;, the viceroy prudently refrained from implementing the most draconian aspects of the edicts, which no longer permitted an &quot;encomendero&quot; family holding the grant in perpetuity. In Peru, the implementation of the New Laws resulted in outright rebellion and the assassination of the viceroy. In reaction to the crisis caused by the New Laws, Mendoza introduced the policy of &quot;obedezco pero no cumplo&quot; (&quot;I obey but do not comply&quot;), which means &quot;I respect the authority of the crown, but in my judgment I do not implement particular legislation.&quot; He tried to not implement the New Laws, and therefore stabilized the region.

In 1542 an insurrection of the Indians, called the Mixtón Rebellion threatened to push the Spaniards out of northwestern Mexico, bringing the area under indigenous control. The Viceroy himself had to take the field and bring all disposable manpower. The rebellion was quashed and the surviving Indians were harshly punished. By the viceroy&#x27;s order men, women and children were seized and executed, some by cannon fire, some torn apart by dogs, and others stabbed. In 1548 he suppressed an uprising of the Zapotecs.

As viceroy, Mendoza commissioned the expedition of Francisco Vásquez de Coronado to explore and establish settlements in the northern lands of New Spain in 1540–42, the expedition of Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo to explore the western coastline of Alta California in 1542–43, and the expedition of Ruy López de Villalobos to the Philippines in 1542–43. The Codex Mendoza created by the order of Mendoza, and subsequently named for him.

During his term of office, Mendoza is credited with consolidating the sovereignty of the Crown throughout the Spanish conquests in New Spain and limiting the power and ambition of the first conquistadors. Many of the political and economic policies he established endured throughout the entire colonial period. He promoted the construction of hospitals and schools and encouraged improvements in agriculture, ranching and mining. His administration did much to bring stability and peace to New Spain.

He was succeeded as viceroy of New Spain by Don Luís de Velasco. It is reported that his advice to his successor was: &quot;Do little and do that slowly.&quot;

==Viceroy of Peru==
On 4 July 1549 in Brussels, Emperor Charles V named Mendoza viceroy of Peru. He traveled overland from Mexico to Panama, and then by boat to Peru. He arrived and took up his new office on 25 November 1550. However, he soon became ill, and died in 1552. His tomb is in the Cathedral of Lima, along with that of the Spanish conqueror of Peru, Francisco Pizarro.

Cape Mendocino in Humboldt County, California was named in his honor in 1565. From the cape, Mendocino County, the town of Mendocino, and Mendocino National Forest were named in the 19th and 20th centuries.

<doc id="1024448" wikidata="Q5437219" url="?curid=1024448" title="Fat Pizza">
<text>Fat Pizza is a 2003 Australian comedy film based on the &quot;Pizza&quot; television series, both of which were created, produced, written and starred in by Paul Fenech. The film&#x27;s story takes place between seasons two (episode &quot;Desert Pizza&quot;) and three (episode &quot;Brand New Pizza&quot;) of the television series. It features Rebel Wilson&#x27;s first movie credit.

It was produced by Village Roadshow Pictures and SBS Independent (uncredited). It was filmed in the Canterbury-Bankstown region of Sydney, specifically Bass Hill and Chullora. Scenes were also filmed in the Hills District of Sydney, at Kellyville and Norwest Business Park. It was released by Roadshow Films on 10 April 2003 and made $2.1 million at the box office.

==Plot==
The film is set in Canterbury-Bankstown and opens with the protagonist, Pauly (Paul Fenech), claiming that the following events are all true and that real names are used.

Pauly arrives late at work to find his employer, Bobo (Johnny Boxer), has hired a new delivery driver, Davo (Jason Davis). Pauly explains to Davo that Bobo is crazy from being a forty-year-old virgin who lives with his mother, but is getting married the next day to a Vietnamese mail-order bride, Lin Chow Bang (Tuyen Le), who is sneaking into the country illegally. Pauly then shows Davo the &quot;Former Employee Hall of Shame&quot;, which features Sahib (Desan Padayachee), who was forced out for being too polite and not tough enough. In retribution for being fired, Sahib and his friends opened their own pizzeria, Phat Pizza.

Later on, Pauly gets into a traffic accident with clown mascot Ronnie Mcdoggle (George Kapiniaris), whom Pauly mocks and assaults. Dozens more clown mascots surround Pauly, forcing him to single-handedly fight them all off, after which the clowns decide to back down and Pauly flees the scene in his delivery car. Ronnie and his fellow clown mascots later show up at the Pizzeria to look for Pauly, but Bobo scares them away with his chainsaw.

Meanwhile, Davo is late delivering a pizza to a house of bikies. While looking around the delivery address, he finds a drug lab producing homemade steroids and a large amount of marijuana. He is then discovered by the bikie gang who fight with and subdue Davo. The bikies are about to kill Davo as the lab catches light and explodes as a result of Davo dropping a joint during the fight. Davo and the bikies survive the explosion, but Davo is able to escape. Back at the Pizzeria, Davo meets fellow delivery driver Sleek the Elite (Paul Nakad), who tells him how he feigns romantic interest in unattractive women so he can meet and sleep with their attractive friends. Sleek then details how he has another delivery driver, Habib (Tahir Bilgic) secretly film his sexual encounters without the women&#x27;s knowledge. Sleek then asks Davo what he used to do before becoming a pizza deliverer, which Davo reveals he was a heavy marijuana user, and that he got the pizza delivery job after getting arrested for possession of marijuana and being sentenced to six years of work release due to prison overpopulation.

While Pauly is getting ready to go clubbing with the other delivery drivers, as well as with Habib and Rocky (Rob Shehadie), Sahib steals his employee uniform from his clothes line and uses it to sneak into the pizzeria and tamper with the phonelines, redirecting all incoming calls to steal their business. Upon leaving, he is spotted by a group of the clown mascots who mistake him for Pauly and beat him up. As a result of their tampering, Phat Pizza then receives a phone call from the bikie gang asking for their address. Meanwhile, Bobo is forced to stay back at the Pizzeria while a Department of Health worker performs a safety inspection, but after the worker insults Bobo&#x27;s mother, Bobo kills him by forcing him into the oven. During the night out with the other delivery drivers, Sleek runs into Toula (Rebel Wilson), one of the girls he has been leading on. Toula and her friends drug Sleek and abduct him. Upon awaking, they tell Sleek that they are sick of him using them to date their attractive friends and rape him as an act of revenge.

Come the next day, Sleek is on his way to the wedding when he is attacked by a coalition of organised crime syndicates who have allied against Sleek because the mafia leaders&#x27; daughters were victims of Sleek and Habib&#x27;s voyeurism. Scared for his life, Sleek calls Habib and Rocky for help, who rallies a Lebanese mob to come to Sleek&#x27;s defence. However, Rocky discovers that his sister was one of the girls Sleek slept with and had Habib film, leading him to turn on Sleek and join the gangs in beating him and Habib up. Bobo, his bride and their guests discover at the wedding that the priest quadruple booked the church, causing the priest to hastily marry all of the couples. Pauly then declares in a cut-away that &quot;At this point, all that was left to do was go and get pissed&quot;.

In the post-credit scenes, Sleek calls Bobo from the hospital to ask for workers compensation only to be fired. The bikie gang members then kill the Phat Pizza employees mistaking them for the staff of Fat Pizza.

==Cast==
== Reception ==
The film received a mostly positive response from critics. Adrian Martin, a PhD in Film Style, gave the film a 3 out of 5 rating, praising it for its strong, outrageous jokes, saying they elevate it above most Australian comedies. Martin also commended its energy, brash confidence and appeal to its target audience. Louise Keller of Urban Cinefile said that the film&#x27;s offensive humour was &quot;very funny&quot; and praised it for being irreverent, high-energy and over-the-top.

=== Controversy ===
The film was a source of controversy because of its use of vulgar humour, racial stereotypes and ethnic slurs (including choco, for non-white people). Some have argued that the portrayal of ethnic-minority characters in the film links vulgarity to ethnic identity and social class. The film is also accused of disingenuously passing off its representations of ethnic minorities as satire to excuse its harmful implications. As such, it is an example of self-stereotyping, like other Australian ethnic-minority lead comedies are.

A counterargument to this that has been raised is that the film gives representation to ethnic minorities, such as Lebanese and Vietnamese people, who were previously absent from Australian comedy and that it is an example of ethnic minorities representing themselves and pushing against mainstream representations. Therefore, Fat Pizza—among other films—marks a shift in the representation of minorities in Australian media away from sensitive, serious portrayals towards market driven entertainment (Khorana, 2019). The favored reception of the film is argued to represent a large, youthful, ethnic-minority audience looking for an outlet against being minoritized in Australian media.

Paul Fenech stated in an interview &quot;It&#x27;s a very hard country for a lot of people to survive, and that&#x27;s why people come to my shows, doesn&#x27;t matter whether they are Greek or bogan.&quot;

==Sequel==
The television show for which the film was adapted from went on to be renewed for another three seasons, which aired in mid-2003 (several months after the movie was released), 2005 and 2007 on SBS. A crossover film between Fat Pizza and Housos – another television show created by Paul Fenech – was released on 27 November 2014. The Fat Pizza television show was revived for a sixth season in 2019 by Paul Fenech and premiered on 7mate, November, 2019.

<text>John Braxton Hicks (23 February 1823 – 28 August 1897) was a 19th-century English medical doctor who specialised in obstetrics.

==Early life and education==
He was born to banker Edward Hicks (b. 1785 - d. 1861) in Rye, Sussex. He was educated privately and in 1841 entered Guy&#x27;s Hospital Medical School. He obtained his MB at the University of London in 1845 and an MD in 1851. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1866.

==Career==
In 1856 Hicks was appointed assistant obstetric physician at Guy&#x27;s Hospital and full physician in 1868. In 1888 he became obstetric physician at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London. Hicks was the first physician to describe the bipolar and other methods of the version of a fetus. In 1872, he described the uterine contractions not resulting in childbirth now known as Braxton Hicks contractions.

In 1862 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society by virtue of his interest in Natural History, about which he wrote numerous papers. He gave the Hunterian Oration to the Hunterian Society in 1868 and was elected their president for 1879.

==Personal life==
Hicks fathered coroner Athelstan Braxton Hicks (b. 1854 - d. 1902).

==Death==
Hicks died at Barratt Homes of The Brackens, Brackley, West Northamptonshire, England on August 28, 1897 at age 74 and is buried at St Thomas Church, Winchester, Hampshire. In his honor, an obstetric ward at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital was named after him (now currently closed).

<doc id="1024462" wikidata="Q345660" url="?curid=1024462" title="Ad fontes">
<text>Ad fontes is a Latin expression which means &quot;[back] to the sources&quot; (lit. &quot;to the sources&quot;). The phrase epitomizes the renewed study of Greek and Latin classics in Renaissance humanism, subsequently extended to Biblical texts. The idea in both cases was that sound knowledge depends on the earliest and most fundamental sources.

== History ==
The phrase &quot;ad fontes&quot; occurs in Psalm 42 of the Latin Vulgate:

The phrase in the humanist sense is associated with the poet Petrarch, whose poems &quot;Rerum Vulgarium Fragmenta&quot; (c.1350) use the deer imagery of the Psalm.

Erasmus of Rotterdam used the phrase in his &quot;De ratione studii ac legendi interpretandique auctores&quot;: 
For Erasmus, &quot;ad fontes&quot; meant that to understand Christ in the Gospels in an educated way involved reading good translations of the New Testament, and the Greek and Roman philosophers and Church Fathers in the five hundred years surrounding Christ, over the earlier Old Testament and later Scholastics.

The most extreme version of &quot;ad fontes&quot; was the Protestant Reformation called for renewed attention to the Bible as the primary source of Christian faith, to the extent of denying extra-biblical apostolic teaching authority: &quot;sola scriptura&quot;. This need to select a core that could reject unattractive Catholic doctrines lead to the Protestant rejection of the Deutero-canonical scriptures and queries, e.g. by Luther, on the canonicity or value of the Epistle of James. 

Sylvia Wynter is quoted as suggesting that &quot;ad fontes&quot; heralded a power grab in which the formerly taken-for-granted authority of theology was replaced by “the authority of the lay activity of textual and philological scrutiny.” 

The phrase is related to &quot;ab initio&quot;, which means &quot;from the beginning&quot;. Whereas &quot;ab initio&quot; implies a flow of thought from first principles to the situation at hand, &quot;ad fontes&quot; is a retrogression, a movement back towards an origin, which ideally would be clearer or purer than the present situation.

==Counter views==

&quot;Ad fontes&quot; may be contrasted with various views of the development of doctrine:

* The softest being of Aquinas, whose views according to G. K. Chesterton were that doctrine developed the way a puppy develops into a dog: not changing and compromising into a cat but &quot;becoming more doggy not less.&quot;

* The view of John Henry Newman &quot;It is indeed sometimes said that the stream is clearest near the spring. Whatever use may fairly be made of this image, it does not apply to the history of a philosophy or belief, which on the contrary is more equable, and purer, and stronger, when its bed has become deep, and broad, and full.&quot;

* The most strident, representing perhaps a less extreme version of the Joachimite heresy, was the &quot;Manual tradition&quot;: the Scholastic tendency to use Sentences (Excerpts), Catena (commentaries), Summa (exhaustive theologies) and the subset of Scriptures used in the daily office and Mass rather than primary material in context: the other material, not being in the standard available manuscripts, was in effect jettisoned and little-known to theologians or to the public. Representative of a linear view of history, the medieval selections (which favoured Augustine over other Church Fathers) and interpretations were deemed so excellent that they superseded the primitive primary material, rendering the philology concerns of the humanists extraneous. Louvain theologian Jacques Masson, who conducted the attempts to convert William Tyndale in prison, wrote that &quot;the genuine sense of scripture is found in its purest form in the expositions and commentaries&quot; of the scholastic doctors.
* The view of a number of bishops at the Council of Trent that the Vulgate was better than even the Greek originals &quot;because&quot; &quot;it&quot; had 1500 years of improvements, as guided by the Holy Spirit. 

It may be noted that promoters of &quot;ad fontes&quot; did not necessarily deny the validity of the developments of dogma: notably Erasmus, who saw clarifications of doctrine (by Church Councils and the Pope) as a necessary part of their peace-keeping and uniting role that did not negate the wisdom of &quot;ad fontes&quot;.

<text>Folk Catholicism can be broadly described as various ethnic expressions and practices of Catholicism intermingled with aspects of folk religion. Practices have varied from place to place and may at times contradict the official doctrines and practices of the Catholic Church.

==Description==
Some forms of folk Catholic practices are based on syncretism with non-Christian or otherwise non-Catholic beliefs or religions. Some of these folk Catholic forms have come to be identified as separate religions, as is the case with Caribbean and Brazilian syncretism between Catholicism and West African religions, which include Haitian Vodou, Cuban Santería, and Brazilian Candomblé. Other syncretized forms, such as the syncretism between Catholic practice and indigenous American belief systems common in Maya communities of Guatemala and Quechua communities of Peru, are typically not described by their practitioners or by outsiders as separate religions; their practitioners generally consider themselves Roman Catholic in both name and practice.

Still other folk Catholic practices are local elaborations of Catholic custom that the Roman Catholic Church does not deem contradictory to Roman Catholic doctrine and practice. Examples include compadrazgo in modern Iberia, Latin America, and the Philippines, which developed from standard medieval European Catholic practices that fell out of favor in Europe after the seventeenth century; the veneration of some local saints, and pilgrimages in medieval and modern Europe.

Folk Catholic practices occur where Catholicism is a major religion, not only in the oft-cited cases of Latin America and the West Indies. Folk accommodations between Catholicism and local beliefs can be found in Gaelic Scotland, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Poland, Germany, Austria, the Philippines, and southern India.

In Ireland, openly Catholic worship was banned due to the Penal Laws. This led to storytellers inventing their own tales to teach the Gospel or add further lessons. These further lessons however often ended up contradicting the teaching of the Catholic Church. Within these stories a variety of recurring characters and themes appear such as the Virgin Mary, priests, Paul the Apostle, Satan, and Jesus himself.

In the Philippines, the custom of Simbang Gabi developed from the farming community. Simbang Gabi is a devotional nine-day series of Masses leading up to Christmas. On the last day of the Simbang Gabi, which is Christmas Eve, the service is instead called &quot;Misa de Gallo&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Rooster&#x27;s Mass&quot;). It has an important role in Philippine culture. It has its origins in the early days of Spanish rule over the Philippines as a practical compromise for farmers, who began work before sunrise to avoid the noonday heat out in the fields. Despite being exhausted by a long day&#x27;s labor, the people would still attend the customary evening novenas. In 1669, the priests began to say Mass in the early mornings instead of the evening novenas more common in the rest of the Hispanic world. This cherished Christmas custom eventually became a distinct feature of Philippine culture and became a symbol of sharing.

The Catholic Church takes a pragmatic and patient stance towards folk Catholicism. For example, it may permit pilgrimages to the site of reported apparitions (e.g. Međugorje) without endorsing or condemning belief in the reported apparitions and will often declare Marian apparitions and similar miracles &quot;worthy of belief&quot; (e.g. Our Lady of Fatima) or will confirm the cult of local saints without actually endorsing or recommending belief. When the Catholic Church considers that there is a blatant heresy occurring, it actively rejects it and tells Catholics to stay away from such practices. This is the case of the cult of Santa Muerte (Saint Death, a personification and veneration of death). The Church has condemned the cult as blasphemous, calling it a &quot;degeneration of religion&quot;.

==Popular Catholicism in the world==
===Haiti===
One of the biggest and well-known folk religions is Vodou. It first appeared in Haiti in the 17th century, and has grown to a large religion which has over 60 million worshippers globally.

It began in tribal regions of the Dahomey Kingdom which is near present-day Nigeria.

Vodu is from the Fon language of Dahomey and means &quot;god&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot;. Vodu and was the religion for many people in this part of West Africa. It is also the origination of the rhythmic drum beating which became a big part of worship and lwa.

Once they arrived in Haiti, the enslaved people were forbidden from practicing any religion except Christianity by their new owners. Many slaves were baptized. In order to continue worship, they adopted Catholic saints and traditions. The saints became stand-ins for their lwa; Saint Peter, for instance, was Legba. In this manner, they were able to practice their faith and please the slaveowner at the same time. Something similar happened with enslaved Africans brought to other countries as well, though Vodou is one of the best examples of the syncretism that occurred between Catholicism and native West African beliefs.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, among the most relevant celebration of popular Catholicism is the novena Christmas known as &quot;Simbang Gabi&quot;, which arose within the farming community and consists of a nine-day devotional gesture of masses in preparation for Christmas. On the last day of Simbang Gabi, which coincides with Christmas Eve, the most important service is held, called in Spanish &quot;Misa de Gallo&quot; (&quot;Mass of the Rooster&quot;).

This is an ancient tradition celebrated since 1669, brought to the Philippines by Spanish missionaries: originally, the nine masses were held very early in the morning, because most of the country&#x27;s inhabitants were farmers who had to go to work before dawn, to avoid being in the fields during the hottest hours of the day.

While evening novenas were more common in the rest of the Hispanic world, this Christmas custom eventually became a distinctive feature of Philippine culture and a symbol of shared participation of popular faith.

===Europe===
====Italy====
In Italy, the spread of popular Catholicism is due to three main factors:

* the regional sense of belonging to the Catholic Church, which has its headquarters in Italy;
* diffuse traditional forms of devotion towards Jesus, Madonnas, angels, saints and patrons that are present in every Italian region and linked to sanctuaries, symbols, relics and religious holidays;
* the charitable and cultural activities of local Catholic aggregations.

Events that contributed to the formation of popular Italian Catholicism include the Counter-Reformation, the Council of Trent, and then the social and civil commitment of the Catholic movement between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

Among the most popular saints and patrons in Italy are San Pio (Padre Pio), Saint Anthony of Padua, Saint Francis of Assisi (San Francesco), Santa Rita of Cascia, Saint Joseph, Saint Michael, Mother Teresa, Saint Clare of Assisi, Saint Rosalia, Januarius, Saint Agatha, Saint Ambrose, and Saint Catherine of Siena. Simon of Trent is also amongst popular figures of Italian folk Catholicism.

To the Italian peasantry, the presence of the sacred was associated with rites of traditional magic called &quot;benedicaria&quot;.

====Ireland====
Ireland has a rich heritage of folk Catholicism. Among the many customs and practices is the tradition of holy wells. These sacred wells are scattered throughout Ireland and are visited by people seeking bodily cures, for example eye ailments. The holy wells contain water blessed by a Catholic priest or bishop and are usually dedicated to one of a myriad of native Irish saints, for example St. Senan&#x27;s holy well on Scattery Island.

Another tradition is the holy ribbon. The most famous being the Brat Bhride in honour of Saint Brigid. This is a piece of cloth or ribbon which is left over night on a windowsill on the eve of the saint&#x27;s feast day. The belief is that the saint will pass through Ireland that night and touch the ribbon which is then kept by individuals and venerated as a holy object which may be used to help the sick or for protection. Other examples of the holy ribbon include the Ribin Cainnear in honour of St. Cainnear and St. Gobnait&#x27;s Measure. Another custom in Ireland sees people take a piece of straw from the crib in a church at Christmas and this is supposed to bring financial security for the year ahead.

====Germany====
The Amorsbrunn chapel in Amorbach, Franconia, Bavaria, has a fountain that is purported to help in conceiving children if bathed in and is a pilgrimage site for both Christians and non-Christians, who share the water. The water&#x27;s purported powers and the pilgrimage to them predates the construction of the chapel; the pre-existing sacred site was intentionally incorporated into the new building and its associated religion, i.e. Catholicism, creating a &quot;cult of continuity&quot;. The water&#x27;s powers were then attributed to &quot;some medieval Catholic saints&quot;, but these &quot;appear as spurious, being poorly motivated.&quot; The site&#x27;s power was previously attributed to a Germanic legendary figure called Mother Holle/Holda, and she was venerated there. More generally, she lives on as a fairy tale character, weather, specifically snow, maker, and general cultural figure, even appearing in movies based on the fairy tale named for her.

===Asia===

In China, Korea and Vietnam, Catholics also practice traditional ancestral veneration.

<text>Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre (formerly the Bamfield Marine Station) is a marine research station established in 1972, located in Bamfield, Barkley Sound, British Columbia and run by the University of Victoria, the University of British Columbia, Simon Fraser University, the University of Alberta, and the University of Calgary. The Centre hosts numerous public education programs in marine related science. BC Field Trips organizes many instructional and educational programs for school-aged children at the Centre. The Centre also runs courses for university students during the summer (May to late August or early September) and during the fall (September to mid-December) through their affiliated universities.

The Centre is housed in the original building used as the western terminus of the British Empire&#x27;s worldwide undersea cable called the All Red Line. Originally the site of the Pacific Cable Board (PCB) Cable Station, which served as the eastern terminus of the trans-Pacific telegraph cable linking Canada to Fanning Island (1,600 kilometres south of Hawaii). The telegraph cable operated from 1901 to 1959.

From 1969 to 1980, the Bamfield Marine Station was part of the British Columbia Shore Station Oceanographic Program, collecting coastal water temperature and salinity measurements for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans everyday for 11 years.

The Centre also lends continued logistical support for Folger Passage and Barkley Sound with Ocean Networks Canada.

In April 2016, Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre and the Huu-ay-aht First Nations partnered with the Hakai Institute to launch a drone. The drone took a series of photos, which were then used to map portions of the Barkley Sound area.

On July 1, 2018, Dr. Sean Rogers, a biology instructor at the University of Calgary, was named director of the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre for a five-year term. Rogers has taught university courses at the Centre, and had been named acting director in 2016.

<text>The Life Guards (LG) is the most senior regiment of the British Army and part of the Household Cavalry, along with The Blues and Royals.

==History==

The Life Guards grew from the four troops of Horse Guards (exclusively formed of gentlemen-troopers until the transformation of the last two remaining troops into Regiments of Life Guards in 1788) raised by Charles II around the time of his restoration, plus two troops of Horse Grenadier Guards (rank and file composed of commoners), which were raised some years later.
* The first troop was originally raised in Bruges in 1658 as &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Own Troop of Horse Guards&quot;. They formed part of the contingent raised by the exiled King Charles II as his contribution to the army of King Philip IV of Spain who were fighting the French and their allies the English Commonwealth under the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell in the Franco-Spanish War and the concurrent Anglo-Spanish War.
* The second troop was founded in 1659 as &quot;Monck&#x27;s Life Guards&quot;.
* The third troop, like the first troop was formed in 1658 from exiled Royalists and was initially known as &quot;The Duke of York&#x27;s Troop of Horse Guards&quot;.
* The fourth troop was raised in 1661 in England.
* The first troop of horse grenadier guards was formed in 1693 from the amalgamation of three troops of grenadiers.
* The second troop of horse grenadier guards was raised in Scotland in 1702.

These units first saw action during the Third Anglo-Dutch War in 1672 and then at the Battle of Sedgemoor during the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685.

The 3rd and 4th troops were disbanded in 1746. In 1788, the remaining 1st and 2nd troops, along with the two troops of Horse Grenadier Guards, were reorganised into two regiments, the 1st and 2nd Regiments of Life Guards (from 1877, simply 1st Life Guards and 2nd Life Guards). From then on (1788), rank and file were mostly formed of commoners giving rise to their pejorative nickname: &quot;the cheesemongers&quot;, while the bulk of the gentlemen-troopers were pensioned off.
From 1812 to 1814, two squadrons from each of the Life Guard regiments served in the Peninsular War. In 1815 they were part of The Household Brigade at the Battle of Waterloo under Major-General Lord Edward Somerset. This would be their last active service for more than 60 years, during which time they performed ceremonial and public order duties in London.

In 1821, the Life Guards under the command of Captain Oakes fired upon mourners trying to redirect the funeral procession of Queen Caroline through the city of London. Two civilians were killed. Though charges of manslaughter and murder were brought, no Life Guards were prosecuted.
Elements of the Life Guards, along with the Royal Horse Guards, formed the Household Cavalry Composite Regiment (HCCR) for active service. The HCCR was in action in the Anglo-Egyptian War of 1882 and the Second Boer War of 1899 to 1902. THe HCCR was mobilised again in 1914 at the start of the First World War, where they formed part of the British Expeditionary Force and fought in most of the major battles on the Western Front.

In 1918, the two Life Guards regiments gave up their horses and were re-roled as machine gun battalions, becoming the 1st and 2nd Battalions, Guards Machine Gun Regiment. They reverted to their previous names and roles after the end of the war. In 1922, the two regiments were merged into one regiment, &quot;The Life Guards (1st and 2nd)&quot;. In 1928, it was re-designated The Life Guards.

During the Second World War, again forming part of the HCCR, the Life Guards undertook armoured reconnaissance duties in Palestine, Iraq, Iran, Egypt and Italy. In 1944, the Life Guards took part in the Normandy landings and the advance through France to liberate Brussels. In the late 1940s, they were deployed to the Middle East, initially in Egypt, garrisoned at Kasr-el-Nil Barracks in Cairo from 1946 to 1947, and then in Palestine from 1947. In 1948, the unit left the Middle East and returned to England on leave. In 1952, it returned to Germany as part of the 11th Armoured Division.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the unit repeatedly rotated from Britain to Germany. In 1965, the unit was deployed to Asia for the first time in central Malaysia until 1968, returning to England. Like in the past decades, the unit was stationed in West Germany and England through the early to late 1970s. During its deployments, the unit always maintained a squadron in London conducting public duties. In 1971 several squadrons were deployed to Northern Ireland during The Troubles, and the regiment would see action there several more times through the mid-1970s. In March 1979, B Squadron was deployed to Cyprus as part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, and this would become another location that components of the unit would be deployed to.

In 1980, the unit&#x27;s headquarters would be moved from Combermere Barracks in Windsor to Lothian Barracks in Detmold, North Rhine-Westphalia, West Germany as a part of the 4th Armoured Division of the British Army of the Rhine, in a heavy armoured role equipped with Chieftain MBT, and also tasked with the defense of part of the North German Plain. In January 1981 it became a component of the 20th Armoured Brigade. The unit provided a mounted escort for then Charles, Prince of Wales and then Lady Diana Spencer during their wedding ceremony on 29 July 1981, in London. Throughout the rest of the 1980s-1990s its headquarters moved frequently from Germany to Britain, and in January 1984 had squadrons deployed to Cyprus as part of a UN tour. In 1990-1991, the Life Guards saw action with their Challenger 1 tanks in the Gulf War.
In 1992, as part of the Options for Change defence review, The Life Guards were joined with the Blues and Royals in a &#x27;Union&#x27;, becoming part of the new Household Cavalry, classified as a corps, not an amalgamation, forming the Household Cavalry Regiment (armoured reconnaissance) and the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment (ceremonial duties). However, both units maintain their regimental identity, with distinct uniforms and traditions, and their own colonel. Like The Blues and Royals, they have a peculiar non-commissioned rank structure: In brief, they lack sergeants, replacing them with multiple grades of corporal. Since the union, the Household Cavalry Regiment has seen active service in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan.

In 2018, the Life Guards began admitting women. In 2020, Elizabeth Godwin became the first woman to be commissioned as an officer in the Life Guards.

<text>Peter Josef Dietzgen (December 9, 1828April 15, 1888) was a German socialist philosopher, Marxist and journalist. 

Dietzgen was born in Blankenberg in the Rhine Province of Prussia. He was the first of five children of father Johann Gottfried Anno Dietzgen (1794–1887) and mother Anna Margaretha Lückerath (1808–1881). He was, like his father, a tanner by profession; inheriting his uncle&#x27;s business in Siegburg. Entirely self-educated, he developed the notion of dialectical materialism independently from Marx and Engels as an independent philosopher of socialist theory. He had one son, Eugene Dietzgen.

==Life==
Early on in his youth, Joseph Dietzgen worked with the famed Forty-Eighters of the 1848 German Revolution. It was there that he first met Karl Marx and other socialist revolutionaries, and began his career as a socialist philosopher. Following the failure of the 1848 Revolution he spent some time in the United States from 1849 to 1851, returning once again for a visit from 1859 to 1861. While in the New World he traversed the American South and witnessed first hand the lynchings which had come to characterize the slave states. During the period between his travels, Dietzgen joined the Alliance of Communists with Karl Marx back in Germany in 1852. In 1853, after marrying his wife Cordula Finke, he established his tannery business in Winterscheid (today part of Ruppichteroth), Germany. When he returned to the United States in 1859 he set up another tannery in Montgomery, Alabama. From 1864 to 1868, he lived with his son Eugene in St. Petersburg, where he was manager of the state tannery. He worked with the Tsar of Russia on improvement of the Russian methods. During his time spent in Russia he wrote one of his earliest texts, &quot;The Nature of Human Brain-Work&quot;, which was published in 1869. Upon his first reading of the text, Marx forwarded a copy to Engels, remarking, &quot;My opinion is that J. Dietzgen would do better to condense all his ideas into two printer&#x27;s sheets and have them published under his own name as a tanner. If he publishes them in the size he is proposing, he will discredit himself with his lack of dialectical development and his way of going round in circles.&quot; While he traveled, his wife managed the family tannery business back in Germany until he returned in mid-1869. Once he was back home, he was visited by Marx and his daughter, who proclaimed that Joseph had become &quot;the Philosopher&quot; of socialism. By 1870, Marx had embraced Dietzgen as a friend, and later praised him and his theory of dialectical materialism in the 2nd edition of the first volume of Das Kapital.

On June 8, 1878, Dietzgen was arrested following the publication of a lecture he gave in Cologne: &quot;The future of the social democracy.&quot; He spent 3 months in prison on remand before his trial was held. Although Joseph was released along with copies of his article, he was re-arrested twice and finally released. In 1881 Joseph sent his son Eugene to the United States in order to avoid the Kaiser&#x27;s upcoming army draft, to safeguard his articles and documents, as well as to secure a family home in the new world. Young Eugene was 19 when he arrived in New York, but quickly jump started a thriving family business in Chicago, the Eugene Dietzgen Company. It became one of the world&#x27;s top drafting and surveying supply manufacturers and distributors and remained such through most of the 20th century. The company still exists today as a division of Nashua Paper, and its two buildings still stand in Chicago&#x27;s now trendy Printer&#x27;s Row and Lincoln Park areas. During this period, Eugene and Joseph kept in close contact through extensive letters which are currently being documented and published. In the same year, Joseph ran for the elections of the German &quot;Reichstag&quot; (the parliament), but emigrated in 1884 to New York City. He moved to Chicago two years later, where he became editor at the &quot;Arbeiterzeitung&quot;. Unfortunately Joseph&#x27;s death in 1888 marked an end to his son&#x27;s dependency, but his family line would continue to be part of some of the biggest engagements of the 20th century; from World War I, to the 1936 Berlin Olympics, to the heart of World War II.

Dietzgen&#x27;s words and life have for some underscored the unity that existed on the political left at the time of the First International, before Anarchists and Marxists were later divided: &quot;For my part, I lay little stress on the distinction, whether a man is an anarchist or a socialist, because it seems to me that too much weight is attributed to this difference.&quot; This suggests he took a more concilliatory, or at least more aloof view of the disputes of the moment (see Anarchism and Marxism).

==Philosophy==

Dietzgen&#x27;s most significant influence is generally described as specific philosophical theory of dialectical materialism, drawing from Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel&#x27;s concept of dialectic and materialism, in particular that of Ludwig Feuerbach (himself earlier a Young Hegelian). Similar positions were developed independently by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in their writings. According to his preface to Dietzgen&#x27;s &quot;The Positive Outcome of Philosophy&quot;, it seems the Communist Manifesto in particular was significantly influential on the development of his thought prior to his earliest philosophical works.

In the earlier &quot;Thirteenth Letter on Logic&quot;, Joseph Dietzgen gave the following summary of his philosophical positions:

&quot;The red thread winding through all these letters deals with the following points: The instrument of thought is a thing like all other common things, a part or attribute of the universe. It belongs particularly to the general category of being and is an apparatus which produces a detailed picture of human experience by categorical classification or distinction. In order to use this apparatus correctly, one must fully grasp the fact that the world unit is multiform and that all multiformity is a unit.

It is the solution of the riddle of the ancient Eleatic philosophy: How can the one be contained in the many, and the many in one 

An explicit evocation of the Eleatics (Parmenides, Zeno of Elea and Melissus of Samos) in particular is distinctive, and sets the language apart from the &quot;mainstream&quot; of dialectical materialism as is more commonly considered.

After his death, Joseph&#x27;s son Eugen gave the following view of the relevance of his father&#x27;s philosophy:

If the founders of historical materialism, and their followers, in a whole series of convincing historical investigations, proved the connection between economic and spiritual development, and the dependence of the latter, in the final analysis, on economic relations, nevertheless they did not prove that this dependence of the spirit is rooted in its nature and in the nature of the universe. Marx and Engels thought that they had ousted the last spectres of idealism from the understanding of history. This was a mistake, for the metaphysical spectres found a niche for themselves in the unexplained essence of the human spirit and in the universal whole which is closely associated with the latter. Only a scientifically verified criticism of cognition could eject idealism from here. (p iv)

This prompted a negative reaction Georgi Plekhanov, as one of the earliest Russian Marxists (as well as co-founder of the Iskra magazine and Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party, and himself the author of &quot;The Monist View of History&quot;, an attempt at an interpretation of historical materialism, and &quot;reconstruction&quot; of the views of Karl Marx:

 Despite all our respect for the noble memory of the German worker-philosopher, and despite our personal sympathy for his son, we find ourselves compelled to protest resolutely against the main idea of the preface from which we have just quoted. In it, the relationship of Joseph Dietzgen to Marx and Engels is quite wrongly stated&quot; 

It is of some notability Vladimir Lenin extensively quoted the writings of Joseph Dietzgen in his later notorious polemic against Ernst Mach (and more pertinently and directly, his rival Alexander Bogdanov), &quot;Materialism and Empiriocriticism: Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy&quot; (which was later made part of exemplary canon, in particular during the rule of Joseph Stalin). Besides the mentioned text, Lenin also made certain erstwhile notes concerning Dietzgen among the notes later grouped as his &quot;Philosophical Notebooks&quot; (Collected Works, Vol. 38., Lawrence &amp; Wishart, 1980). 

In the note on pages 403-406 he compared him unfavourably to Feuerbach:
 ...To be does not mean to exist in thought.
In this respect Feuerbach’s philosophy is far clearer
than the philosophy of Dietzgen. “The proof that something exists,” Feuerbach remarks, “has no
other meaning than that something exists not in thought alone.”

==Death==
Dietzgen died at home smoking a cigar. He had taken a stroll in Lincoln Park, and was having a political discussion in a &quot;vivacious and excited&quot; manner about the &quot;imminent collapse of capitalist production&quot;. He stopped in mid-sentence with his hand in the air – dead of paralysis of the heart. He is currently buried at the Waldheim Cemetery (now Forest Home Cemetery), in Forest Park, Chicago, near the graves of those executed after the Haymarket Affair (popularly known as the Haymarket Martyrs).
==Legacy==

Anton Pannekoek, the Dutch astronomer and council communist (a left-communist, belong to the group or position which Lenin called &quot;Left-Wing&quot; Communism: An Infantile Disorder noted that, in &quot;Materialism and Empirio-criticism&quot;, Lenin cited Dietzgen&#x27;s penultimately composed work (the &quot;Letters on Logic&quot;), but not the final one to be composed (&quot;The Positive Outcome of Philosophy&quot;). 

In his 1938 book on Lenin, written after the work had already been given the status of a paradigm of philosophy in the USSR, Pannekoek included a highly critical response to the text. In particular, Pannekoek charged that Lenin had completely ignored Dietzgen&#x27;s last composed philosophical work and therefore misunderstood the development of Dietzgen&#x27;s thought. 

In his polemic against Lenin, Pannekoek appeals to Dietzgen as an authority on Marxist philosophy. The writings of Dietzgen are most discussed and attract the most interest in the context of these debates, but have fallen into obscurity in present-day philosophy. 

Dietzgen figured on a commemorative postage stamp issued in the German Democratic Republic.

<text>Sinfonia concertante (; also called &quot;symphonie concertante&quot;) is an orchestral work, normally in several movements, in which one or more solo instruments contrast with the full orchestra. It emerged as a musical form during the Classical period of Western music from the Baroque concerto grosso. Sinfonia concertante encompasses the symphony and the concerto genres, a concerto in that soloists are on prominent display, and a symphony in that the soloists are nonetheless discernibly a part of the total ensemble and not preeminent. Sinfonia concertante is the ancestor of the double and triple concerti of the Romantic period corresponding approximately to the 19th century.

==Classical era==
In the Baroque period, the differences between a concerto and a &quot;sinfonia&quot; (also &quot;symphony&quot;) were initially not all that clear. The word &quot;sinfonia&quot; would, for example, be used as the name for an overture to a stage work. Antonio Vivaldi wrote &quot;concertos&quot; which did not highlight individual soloists and which were stylistically more or less indistinguishable from his &quot;sinfonias.&quot; The Baroque genre that comes closest to the Classical &quot;sinfonia concertante&quot; is the concerto grosso; among the most famous of these are those by Arcangelo Corelli and George Frideric Handel.

During the Classical period (roughly 1750–1800), both the symphony and the concerto had acquired more definite meanings, and the &quot;concerto grosso&quot; had disappeared altogether. In the second half of the 18th century, this led to attempts to combine the two genres, such as those by composers of the Mannheim school. Johann Christian Bach (the so-called &quot;London Bach&quot; and youngest son of Johann Sebastian) was publishing &quot;symphonies concertantes&quot; in Paris from the early 1770s on, as was Joseph Bologne, the &#x27;famous Chevalier de Saint-Georges&#x27;. Mozart, who likely heard the early Sinfonia concertantes of Bologne, was also acquainted with the Mannheim school from 1777 and probably aware of J.C. Bach&#x27;s publications. He put considerable effort into attempts to produce convincing &quot;sinfonie concertanti&quot;. His most successful are the following:

* &quot;Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra K. 364&quot; (the only one Mozart is actually considered to have finished that exists in an authentic copy).
* &quot;Sinfonia Concertante for Oboe, Clarinet, Horn, Bassoon and Orchestra K. 297b&quot; (known from an arrangement, possibly inauthentic).

Joseph Haydn also wrote a &quot;Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Cello, Oboe and Bassoon&quot; during his visit to London, as a friendly challenge to his former student Ignaz Pleyel. He also stayed in London at the time and his works in the genre were highly popular. Haydn also wrote symphonies with long soloist parts, especially early in his career, such as the &quot;Time of Day&quot; symphonies 6–8. These are, however, rightfully considered symphonies rather than sinfonie concertanti.
Other examples from the era are Kozeluch&#x27;s Sinfonia Concertante in E flat major for mandolin, trumpet, double-bass, piano, Gossec&#x27;s Symphonie Concertante for Violin and Cello in D major and Gresnick&#x27;s Symphonie Concertante in B flat major for Clarinet and Bassoon.

==Romantic era==
Few composers still called their compositions &quot;sinfonia concertante&quot; after the classical music era. However, some works such as Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Harold en Italie&quot;, for viola and orchestra approach the genre.

Ludwig van Beethoven did not write anything designated as a &quot;sinfonia concertante&quot;, although some feel his &quot;Triple Concerto&quot; qualifies for inclusion in the genre.

Felix Mendelssohn wrote two concertos for two pianos and orchestra: one in E major and one in A-flat major, which can both be seen as sinfonie concertanti.

Saint-Saëns&#x27; Symphony No. 3 features an organ that is partially immersed in the orchestral sound, but also has several distinct solo passages. The second half of this work also features a semi-soloistic part for piano four hands.

By the end of the 19th century, several French composers had started using the sinfonia concertante technique in symphonic poems, for example, Saint-Saëns uses a violin in &quot;Danse macabre&quot;, and Franck a piano in &quot;Les Djinns&quot;.

Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (1897) uses several soloists to depict the main characters, namely cello, viola, bass clarinet and tenor tuba.

Lalo&#x27;s best known work, the &quot;Symphonie espagnole&quot;, is in fact a sinfonia concertante for violin and orchestra.

A work in the same vein, but with the piano taking the &quot;concertante&quot; part is d&#x27;Indy&#x27;s &quot;Symphony on a French Mountain Air&quot;. 

Brahms&#x27;s concerto for violin, cello and orchestra in a minor, Op. 102, the last of his four concertos, is effectively a sinfonia concertante.

Bruch explored the boundaries of the solistic and symphonic genres in the &quot;Scottish Fantasy&quot; (violin soloist), &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot; (cello soloist), and &quot;Serenade&quot; (violin soloist). He also wrote a concerto for clarinet, viola and orchestra in E minor, and a concerto for two pianos and orchestra in A-flat minor, which are both equal to a sinfonia concertante.

Ferruccio Busoni wrote an enormous piano concerto in C major, containing five movements, lasting over an hour and even finishing with a male choir, that can be considered a sinfonia concertante.

==20th century==

In the 20th century, some composers such as George Enescu, Darius Milhaud, Frank Martin, Edmund Rubbra, Florent Schmitt, William Walton and Malcolm Williamson again used the name &quot;sinfonia concertante&quot; for their compositions. Martin&#x27;s work, more reminiscent of the classical works with multiple soloists, features a piano, a harpsichord, and a harp. Karol Szymanowski also composed a sinfonia concertante (for solo piano and orchestra), also known as his Symphony No. 4 &quot;Symphonie-Concertante.&quot; Other examples include Joseph Jongen&#x27;s 1926 &quot;Symphonie Concertante&quot;, Op. 81, with an organ soloist, the &quot;Sinfonia Concertante&quot; (Symphony No. 4), for flute, harp and small string orchestra by Andrzej Panufnik written in 1973, and Peter Maxwell Davies&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonia Concertante&quot; for wind quintet, timpani and string orchestra of 1982.

The Czech composer Bohuslav Martinů wrote two works in this genre: Sinfonia Concertante for Two Orchestras, H. 219 (1932) and Sinfonia Concertante No. 2 in B-flat major for Violin, Cello, Oboe, Bassoon and Orchestra with Piano, H. 322 (1949). In fact, all but one of the composer&#x27;s symphonies feature a piano, as do most of his orchestral works, but the two afore-mentioned works were the only two in his output which he labelled concertante symphonies.

Wilhelm Furtwängler completed in 1937 his Symphonic Concerto for Piano and Orchestra in B minor, which lasts over one hour and is one of the longest piano concertos ever written.

Sergei Prokofiev called his work for cello and orchestra Symphony-Concerto, stressing its serious symphonic character, in contrast to the light character of the Classical period sinfonia concertante. Benjamin Britten&#x27;s Cello Symphony and Ellen Taaffe Zwilich&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 also showcase a solo cello within the context of a full-scale symphony.

Peter Schickele as P. D. Q. Bach produced a spoof &quot;Sinfonia Concertante&quot; utilizing lute, balalaika, double reed slide music stand, ocarina, left-handed sewer flute, and bagpipes.

<text>Rotherham Rugby Union Football Club, or Rotherham Titans is a rugby union club from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, currently playing in the third tier of the English rugby union league system, following their promotion from the National League 2 North at the end of the 2023–2024 season.

Rotherham achieved multiple promotions within the league structure in the 1990s and early 2000s. This meteoric rise ultimately culminated in two unsuccessful spells in the English Premiership. Rotherham is perhaps best known for the Rugby Football Union blocking its entry into the Premiership, its subsequent legal challenges, and a partially successful appeal to the Office of Fair Trading to break an alleged Premiership cartel.

Rotherham have developed several international players, including David Strettle, Hendre Fourie and Erik Lund.

==History==
===1923–1986===
During the 1920s and 1930s the club regularly turned out two teams and on odd occasions three, normally in school holiday periods when local 6th-formers played.

Rotherham in common with many clubs shut down during the Second World War and the club was reformed in 1946 at Clifton Lane. The next fifteen years were a struggle in terms of running teams and raising finance to improve facilities. The club received a big boost when a local secondary modern school started rugby and soon a regular supply of players were coming through. Rugby started to be played in many local schools and the arrival of a number of Physical Education teachers in the area who were rugby specialists helped both the playing standard and the club organisation.

Prior to the advent of a national league structure, Rotherham struggled to get fixtures against establishment sides, largely from the south of England, meaning when the league was established they were placed well down the league structure despite always showing an ambition to develop. This perceived snub by other top teams, and placement at the bottom of the rugby hierarchy fired the initial drive up the leagues and led to several former players such as Mike Yarlett investing their time and resources to transform the club.

===1987–1995===
Rotherham entered league rugby in 1987 enjoying enormous success with seven subsequent promotions culminating by eventually reaching the Premiership. In the 1988–89 season, Rotherham won the North East 1 title and so began its rise up the rugby pyramid. This was immediately followed up by five further promotions in six seasons to propel the club to the fourth tier of English rugby by 1995–96.

This period in the club&#x27;s development was later to be considered the start of the &quot;golden decade&quot;, and secured legendary status for several players including John Dudley, Richard Selkirk, Craig West and Kevin Plant. During this period Rotherham attracted some criticism for their early adoption of paying players during a period later referred to as &quot;Shamateurism&quot; as most progressive clubs in essence paid their players while keeping up the pretence of being Amateur clubs.

In this era, the Yorkshire Cup, still a prestigious competition in which all the top Yorkshire sides competed, became a symbolic quest for the Rotherham players and management. The competition had been dominated for the previous 25 years by Wakefield, Harrogate and the four big Leeds clubs, Headingley, Roundhay, Morley and Otley, none of whom would give Rotherham a fixture prior to the introduction of league rugby. Rotherham reached the final for the first time in their history in 1993, going down 22–5 to Otley, however 2 years later there was no doubting that Rotherham had arrived as they defeated Harrogate 39–3 at Kirkstall to win the Cup for the first and to date only time.

The 1994 County Championship final at Twickenham also provided further evidence of Rotherham&#x27;s ascent to senior club status in Yorkshire, as Kevin Plant and Craig West were members of the Yorkshire side (along with soon to be Rotherham scrum-half Guy Easterby — then with Harrogate) who won the championship in exhilarating fashion with a 26–3 triumph over Durham.

Summarising the success in 1995, the independent put Rotherham&#x27;s success into context saying:
===1996–1999===

Rotherham eventually reached the Courage National Division 1 in 1996–97, finishing seventh in their first season. 1997 also witnessed one of Rotherhams stellar days at Clifton Lane in the 6th round of the Pilkington Cup. Rotherham Lost 23–42. &quot;Rotherham Advertiser&quot; 31 January 1997 said of the game: 
The 1997–98 season saw Rotherham improve on their first Division One season to fourth, while the next year 1998–99 saw Rotherham finish equal on points with first place Bristol, the West Country side prevailing on points difference, setting Roth up for a promotion playoff. Ultimately they were denied cruelly by the aggregate tries rule, having tied the scores with the Premiership&#x27;s second bottom side Bedford at 38–38, leaving Rotherham to endure another season in National Division One. However, in 1999–2000 Rotherham enjoyed a near faultless season, losing only two games and winning their first National League 1 title, setting up a promotion playoff re-match with Bedford. The first leg saw Rotherham score four tries winning 40–20 at home, while the second leg was one of Rotherham&#x27;s most dramatic; conceding two penalty tries losing 14–0 to win on aggregate 40–34 gaining promotion to the top tier.

===2000–2003===
For 2000–01 Rotherham won promotion to become Yorkshire&#x27;s first ever representative in the top tier of English rugby. &quot;The Independent&quot; said of Rotherham entry to the premiership:
The club endured a torrid yet promising year as they struggled to win games, several were lost by mere points. However, highlights of the season included victories at Clifton Lane against London Irish (19–18) and Saracens (19–8), which saw some of the biggest attendances in the club&#x27;s history as up to 4,000 supporters crammed into Clifton Lane. Rotherham finished bottom and were relegated to National Division 1 after one season.

2001–02 saw Rotherham return to National One having gained experience and develop as a club. Rotherham duly romped to their second National Division One title in three years, losing only two games all season. The success of the league title was quickly dampened by the decision that Rotherham were to be denied promotion to the Premiership as they did not fulfil the ever-changing entry requirements.

Rotherham remained in National Division One for the 2002–03 determined to overcome the previous season&#x27;s setback, and demonstrated their consistency by once again recording a near perfect season as they once again lost only two games all season, climaxing as Rotherham became champions by beating Worcester away in one of the club&#x27;s most memorable moments. &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 13 April 2003 said of the battles with Worcester;

This was the club&#x27;s third National Division One title in four years, and this time welcomed automatic promotion back to the premiership.
In June 2003 after a 5-month enquiry by Anthony Arlidge QC, Rotherham were acquitted of any wrongdoing in the &quot;Rotherham-Gate&quot; saga, an enquiry which the Premiership were generally consider to have treated with disdain, and ultimately cast serious questions over the conduct of several Premiership Chairmen. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported:
The 2003–04 season saw a return to the Premiership for Rotherham and a change of name as
a sponsorship deal with Titan Environmental lead to the adoption of the &#x27;Titans&#x27; nickname. The Titans had been sharing Millmoor stadium with Rotherham United Football Club since the start of the 2002–03 season, but Millmoor proved even less of a happy top-flight hunting ground than Clifton Lane as Rotherham struggled to adapt on their return, the Titans being relegated from the top-flight of professional rugby union in 2003–04 after only one season, disappointingly without winning a single match. 

At the end of that season, Mike Yarlett, the owner who had bankrolled the club&#x27;s rise through the leagues, withdrew his backing, and extinction appeared to be a distinct possibility. It became clear Yarlett&#x27;s withdrawal of his backing had come after significant frustration with the RFU at their failure to meet his request to guarantee the possibility of promotion from National Division 1 to the Premiership.

The club was rescued by a local consortium headed by local businessmen Nick Cragg and Martin Jenkinson who had both previously played for the club. Donations from supporters, assurances from Rotherham Council, who valued the club&#x27;s community work, and the acceptance of savage wage cuts from players ensured that Rotherham could continue in business albeit after a return to their spiritual home ground at Clifton Lane.

In 2004 there was widespread outcry at the RFU&#x27;s support of a proposed takeover of Rotherham by a South Africa consortia who wanted to move the club to London.

===2004–2006===

The 2004–05 season started with five wins in a row for the Titans, but the reality of their financial situation, and vast scale of squad changes this had caused, soon kicked in. The Titans finished in their worst ever position in the National Division One in eighth.

2005–06 saw Andre Bester take control of the club in the double role of chief executive and head coach. With attendances between 920 and 2250, the Titans managed to improve to finish fourth in National Division One below an unstoppable Harlequins, who bounced back to the premiership. The club were known as &#x27;Earth Titans&#x27; throughout the term of a sponsorship deal with Hellaby-based finance house Earth Money.

The next season 2006–07, the Titans lost the likes of David Strettle, a future England star and Chris Hala&#x27;ufia to Harlequins, but brought in players which Bester felt had the potential to help the Titans win National Division One, such as Ireland U21 International Gareth Steenson and Scotland 7s Andrew Turnbull. This saw a resurgence from Rotherham as they made a good start to the National Division One campaign. The most notable victory was beating Leeds 22–19 in a very close match which the Titans stole at the death with a penalty from Gareth Steenson. Rotherham finished in second place, five points behind Leeds Carnegie.

===2007–2010===

The Titans signed a record sponsorship deal with Complete Technical Services in June 2007, however 2007–08 was a disappointing season following on from the previous years success as Titans slumped to eleventh. Northampton recorded a perfect season going unbeaten and returning to the Premiership. Rotherham finished the 2008–09 season in tenth as they sought to rebuild the team. 2009–10 saw Rotherham&#x27;s worst league finish in thirteen years since they were first promoted to National Division One. Despite this poor finish, and finding themselves in the relegation playoffs, they never looked in danger of demotion as they won all but one of their games to top the group.

Rotherham looked to mount a fresh challenge for the 2010–11 season and succeeded in improving on the previous few seasons, finishing seventh and in the promotion playoffs. Ryan Burrows, Juan Pablo Socino &amp; Adam Kettle enjoyed particularly impressive seasons respectively. Andre Bester aimed to secure a squad for the following year prior to the playoffs and the club effectively released several players prior to the end of the season, the ensuing lack of motivation being a contributory factor to the Titans losing every playoff game to finish the season.

===2011–2012===
The 2011–12 RFU Championship brought excitement back to the club as many new faces were brought in while retaining the core of the previous years squad. Titans assembled one of the largest packs in the league backed up with an impressive back line and quickly became a team to fear. New players such as Semisi Tualava, Palepoi Nonu, Adrian &quot;The Enforcer&quot; Griffiths, Garry Law, Robin Copeland &amp; Jimmy Williams had an immediate positive impact, whilst the likes of Rob O&#x27;Donnell, Jamie Kilbane &amp; Cliffie Hodgson extended their stay to further bolster the squad. The club enjoyed a run of seven unbeaten home games in the Championship including impressive victories against Bristol (44–6), Bedford (40–32) and also winning on the road at London Welsh (33–25). Rotherham currently have a winning record and are aiming for a top four finish leading to the promotion playoffs.

As of January 2012 Rotherham were the number one ranked team in Yorkshire, overtaking Leeds Carnegie and the third highest team in the North of England behind only Sale Sharks and the Newcastle Falcons

On 24 January Rotherham signed two scrum halves on trial, Dale Farnham joined from Plymouth Albion; and Danny Matthews who had previously played at Leeds Met University alongside teammates Barney Maddison and Ben Hooper while playing at the university. Subsequently, on 25 January, Rotherham also signed Tom Armes as a dual registered player from Leicester Tigers.
===2013–present===
Rotherham finished the 2013–14 season in the play-offs, losing narrowly to Bristol in the first leg of the semi-finals (17–14) and more comprehensively (11–22) in the return fixture at Clifton Lane. Another play-off year was to follow in 2014–15, with the Titans again losing to Bristol in the semi-finals.

2015–16 saw a dramatic turnaround in events, with the Titans not only finishing outside of the play-offs, but in 10th place. 2016–17 was even worse for the Titans, culminating in an 11th-place finish. In March 2017, head coach Justin Burnell was sacked after a run of one win in fourteen games. He was swiftly replaced with former Yorkshire boss Andy Key. Without the mid-season liquidation of London Welsh, the Titans would have been relegated to National League 1.

Prior to the 2017–18 season, the Titans announced a multi-year kit deal with Scimitar Sportswear. Rotherham would finish the 2017–18 season bottom of the Championship, with the club relegated to National League 1. This will see Rotherham playing third tier rugby for the first time since the 1995–96 season.

==Historic rivalries==

Due to Rotherham&#x27;s rapid rise up the league structure it wasn&#x27;t until the late 1990s that they developed any regular rivals. The first of these were Wakefield who were the most senior team from Yorkshire in the upper levels of rugby union. At the time Wakefield had a number of the most experienced players outside the top flight including Dave Scully, Terry Garnett and Rod Latham all of whom eventually moved to play for Rotherham as Roth superseded Wakefield as the senior side in Yorkshire.

Unusually the next two rivals weren&#x27;t local, both Bedford Blues and Worcester Warriors were promotion rivals to Rotherham and had a number of epic games between 1999 and 2002. During this period Rotherham were regular victors over both of these teams including against Bedford in a play off to gain promotion to the Premiership, and in a key game against Worcester Warriors which all but sealed promotion to the Premiership for the second time.

The third period of rivalry pitted Rotherham against local rivals Leeds Carnegie and then Doncaster Knights.

==Home ground==

Rotherham play their home games at Clifton Lane sports ground (capacity 2,500) which they share with Rotherham Town Cricket Club. As a result, the club has been unable to develop the ground, as the Titans pitch serves as the outfield for the cricket club. In 2001–02 during Rotherham&#x27;s first season in the premiership the club expanded the capacity to approximately 4,000 by using temporary stands which were situated on the south east side of the ground. The ground consists of a main covered stand referred to as &quot;the shed&quot;, and a number of concrete standing areas and small terraces. &quot;The Shed&quot; is generally considered to produce a highly partisan and passionate atmosphere on match days and is often quoted as being part of the team&#x27;s strong home record.

Rotherham Titans moved to Clifton Lane in the late 1930s and have played every league season at Clifton Lane apart from the 2003–04 Premiership season during Rotherham&#x27;s second stint as they instead shared Millmoor stadium with Rotherham United Football Club to satisfy promotion criteria. Rotherham returned to Clifton Lane the following year.

The Titans still need to resolve issues surrounding facilities. They have been turned down for promotion before due to this, and require better facilities if they are to be promoted. As aforementioned The Titans have shared Millmoor stadium with Rotherham United Football Club in the past. Rotherham United Football Club’s Chairman, Dennis Coleman, had mentioned the possibility of sharing the newly constructed New York Stadium. However the Titans opted out of the use of this stadium as they pursued alternative facilities.

In 2010–11 season, the ground was sponsored by Stafforce recruitment and is sometimes quoted as being called the &quot;Stafforce Stadium&quot;.

In 2011 Rotherham Titans spent several months seeking an agreement with the owners of Millmoor CF Booth Ltd to use the unused stadium as their home ground. After much speculation it was announced in December 2011 that the Titans would remain at Clifton Lane for the foreseeable future due to the deal falling through.

===Community Foundation===

Clifton Lane is the base for several high-profile community programmes through the club&#x27;s flagship Community Foundation. The Community Foundation has received considerable praise for working with vulnerable and disadvantaged young people, using the players as role models helping to improve the participants&#x27; life skills.

Instrumental in the foundation&#x27;s set up was Brian Chapple, who later went on to be the Community Foundation at Rotherham United. While the foundation was set up to support the community, the value added by the foundation was one of the main reasons that Rotherham Council helped save the Titans after financial meltdown in 2003.

<text>The Life Guards (, designation LG) is a combined Swedish Army cavalry/infantry regiment. Its responsibilities include the defence of Stockholm as well as provision of the royal guard of honour for the King of Sweden and the Stockholm Palace. With traditions dating from 1521, the regiment is one of the oldest military units in continuous operational existence in the world. It was established in its present form in July 2000, following a merger of the Svea Life Guards and the Life Guard Dragoons. Headquarters are mainly located in Brunna north of Kungsängen in Upplands-Bro Municipality and at the &quot;Cavalry Barracks 1&quot; in central Stockholm.

==History==

Svea Life Guards dates back to the year 1521, when the men of Dalarna chose 16 young able men as body guards for Gustav Vasa, thus making the Life Guards one of the world&#x27;s oldest regiments still on active duty.

The King&#x27;s Battalion&#x27;s Life Company is the world&#x27;s oldest company. Since the year 1523 the section, now enlarged, has been known as the Royal Corps of Halberdiers and, under various names, the regiment has had its natural home at the Palace in Stockholm. The Halberdiers were transformed in 1619 into the Household Company which accompanied Gustavus Adolphus wherever he went in Europe. It was from this time too that the unit was classed as a regiment. In 1633 the company brought the king&#x27;s body home from Lützen and thereafter formed the basis of Queen Christina&#x27;s new guards regiment within the royal household.

The three following Carolean kings – Charles X Gustav, Charles XI, and Charles XII – required a government organization that was more mobile and the guards officers and soldiers accompanied them to the various battlefields under the name of His Royal Majesty&#x27;s Guards. With the destruction of the palace in Stockholm by fire in 1697 the guards&#x27; natural responsibility for the defense of the capital disappeared. The new palace was completed in the 1750s and there was again a need for Life Guards and Household Troops for defending the capital.

During the period 1756–1810 – when there were constant palace coups and a large number of assassination conspiracies – the guards officers and the palace guard often played a decisive role. Gustav III tried to exploit this by appointing himself head of the regiment in 1774. The colonel was then given the title of second-in-command or deputy commander and this command hierarchy continued until 1980 when a number of constitutional changes brought it to an end. The Life Guards reckon 19 August 1772, as the proudest day in this period for it was then that Gustav III was able to break with corrupt governments. The most ignominious day is 20 June 1810 when the Marshal of the Realm, Axel von Fersen, was lynched during the funeral of the crown prince without the regiment intervening in spite of its being on duty.

The name was changed to the Svea Life Guards in 1792 and in 1802 the regiment moved to barracks at Fredrikshov. In the ensuing century the unit was used for various tasks. For example, the commander of the capital made use of the men and officers for keeping order in Stockholm. The regiment moved to barracks on Linnégatan in 1888. At the same time there were proposals to extend the training grounds on Ladugårdsgärde and at the beginning of the 1900s an artillery range was commissioned on Järvafält. The Svea Life Guards again moved their barracks in 1946, this time to Ulriksdal on the outskirts of Stockholm. At the end of the 1960s the Municipality of Stockholm wanted to build dwellings on Järva and the regiment was again under increasing pressure to move. In 1970 there was no longer room for the unit in central Stockholm and it was obliged to move men and equipment out to Kungsängen. A positive aspect of the move was that the regiment at last had access to training grounds and artillery ranges adjacent to the barracks.

During the military alert in the 1940s Sweden was divided into a number of defense districts. The idea was that the various staff commands would be wholly responsible for defending their own geographic areas. In 1946 the Stockholm and Norrtälje defence districts were united into the joint Fo 44. In order to reduce administration, the Svea Life Guards were grouped with K 1 out in Kungsängen in 1975–1985. In August 1985 the regiment also assumed responsibility for training K 1. Between 1985 and 1992 the Svea Life Guards also had administrative responsibility for the Armed Forces NBC-defense units, which was also grouped in the barracks at Kungsängen.

The official collective name of Svea Life Guards (I 1/Fo 44), lasted for nine years. In 1994 I 1, IB 1 and K 1 were separated and became independent units. But they retained the old barracks in Kungsängen and on Lidingövägen. The Svea Lifeguards also continued to take responsibility for various administrative duties for the other two units.

With the reorganization of the defense forces, the Svea Life Guards were disbanded on 30 June 2000. Most of the staff and duties are now to be found with the Life Guards. At a solemn ceremony on the inner palace yard, the Life Guards and the Household Brigade were presented with a new colour by King Carl XVI Gustaf. The new colour is a unique artifact presenting the national coat of arms with the chain of the Royal Order of the Seraphim and two supporting lions, as well as all the battle honours, on a white ground.

==Units (2000–2011)==

===Guards Battalion===
The infantry battalion (&quot;Guards Battalion&quot;) trained ordinary infantry soldiers in both the mechanized and rifle roles, as well as training clerical soldiers. The Guards Battalion consists of three companies: 
* Life Company
* 6th company 
* 8th company

They are light mechanized companies trained for urban combat with the defense of Stockholm as its first and foremost wartime duty.

===Dragoons Battalion===
The cavalry battalion (&quot;Dragoons Battalion&quot;) had the responsibility for training military police, counter-sabotage units, depot soldiers and guards. The Dragoons Battalion&#x27;s 4th Squadron was the only mounted cavalry unit in the Swedish Armed Forces. The soldiers of the Life Guards are also frequently used for ceremonial duties like the Royal Guard at the Stockholm Palace, state occasions like the annual opening of the Riksdag and as a guard of honour on the occasion of royal audiences and visits.

==Structure (2016–present)==
The Life Guards as it exists today has been part of the Swedish Army since 2000, when the functions of three separate guards units, the Svea Life Guards, the Household Brigade and the Life Guards Dragoons, all of which were classed as Household troops, were amalgamated into a single regiment.

As of 2018, the unit employs 448 officers, 575 active soldiers, 470 part-time soldiers, 334 civilian employees and 439 reserve officers; totalling 1,300.

=== King&#x27;s Guards Battalion ===
The King&#x27;s Guards Battalion is a combined arms (infantry and cavalry) unit of battalion size responsible for state ceremonial activities and, in the event of war, to protect the Head of state, Prime Minister of Sweden, government and military leadership. The unit specializes in urban warfare and is organized into five companies: 
*Battalion Headquarters Company: managing and planning the battalion&#x27;s operations.
*10th Staff- &amp; Support Company: infantry, consists of command, staff- and service, mortars, pioneers and recon platoons. The main part is part-time duty.
*Life Company (His Majesty the King&#x27;s Own Life Company): infantry, three full-time platoons conducting state ceremonial activities on foot, including Royal Guard duties, the Svea Corps of Drums, and one historical platoon.
*Life Squadron: cavalry, implements Mounted Guard and Mounted state ceremonial activities, and dismounted Royal Guard duty.
*13th Squadron: cavalry, conducting the same duties as the King&#x27;s Squadron, but the main part is part-time duty.

The whole battalion is based in the old Cavalry Barracks at Lidingövägen in Stockholm. Three of the companies are infantry (Foot Guards) and two are cavalry (Horse Guards).

=== 11th Military Police Battalion ===
The 11th Military Police Battalion serves as the primary military police unit in the Swedish Armed Forces. The battalion consists of a personal security company, two military police companies and an investigation team. The battalion is commanded by the battalion headquarters with support from a staff and support platoon. It is the main formation that provides the Armed Forces with an active unit that maintains law and order and military discipline.

The battalion is heir to the historical cavalry traditions carried from the former Life Guard Dragoons.

=== 12th Motorised Infantry Battalion ===
The 12th Motorised Infantry Battalion is equipped with the Patria XA-360 AMV and is specialized in urban warfare. It can operate both nationally and internationally. 
The battalion was raised in 2016 when the Guards Battalion and the 7th Infantry Battalion (shared with the Life Regiment Hussars) were amalgamated. The main part of the battalion consists of part-time officers and soldiers. The HQ and Support Company consists of full-time officers and soldiers.

The battalion has its roots in the Svea Life Guards and carries the traditions of the guards infantry.

=== 13th Counter-intelligence battalion ===
The 13th Counter-intelligence Battalion is specialised in managing the five generic security threats: crime, subversion, intelligence, sabotage and terrorism. It contains counter-intelligence companies from the Army, the Amphibious Corps and the Swedish Air Force.

The Battalion is successor to the cavalry traditions of the old Life Guard Dragoons. However, this is a tri-service battalion, which means that its operators wear the rank insignia of their respective service branch.

=== Commandant of Stockholm ===

From 2000 to 2017, the commander of the Life Guards also held the appointment of Commandant of Stockholm and had a Commandant Staff subordinated to him. The staff is responsible for planning and managing state ceremonial duties in Stockholm and work as a link between the Swedish Armed Forces, the Cabinet Office and the Royal Court. The staff is based at the Royal Guard&#x27;s Wing at the Royal Palace in Stockholm.

=== Swedish Armed Forces Dog Unit (FMHE) ===
The Swedish Armed Forces Dog Unit (, FMHE) is responsible for the acquisition and training of military dogs within the Swedish Armed Forces. The unit is based in Märsta and Sollefteå.

=== Swedish Armed Forces International Centre (Swedint) ===
The Swedish Armed Forces International Centre (, Swedint) is responsible for the training of soldiers going on international duty. The unit is based in Granhammar Barracks in Kungsängen.

=== Swedish Armed Forces Music Corps (FöMus) ===
The Swedish Armed Forces Music Corps, which falls under the Life Guards, is responsible for all military music responsibilities in the Swedish Armed Forces including concerts, changing of the guards and state ceremonial duties. It consists of three military bands:

* Royal Swedish Army Band is the biggest military band in the Swedish Armed Forces. It wears the uniform of the Göta Life Guards (2nd Guards). The band is based in Stockholm.
* Life Guards&#x27; Dragoon Music Corps is a cavalry brass band playing by horseback. It wears the uniform of the Life Guard Dragoons. The band is based in Stockholm.
* Royal Swedish Navy Band is a military band based in Karlskrona. While reporting directly to the Life Guards, the Navy Band serves as part of the Swedish Navy.

== Uniforms ==

=== 1886 (Infantry) ===
The units with infantry traditions wear the uniform of the Svea Life Guards dating from 1886. Some alterations have taken place since, but the basic design of the uniform consists unchanged.

The blue ceremonial uniform includes a tunic with a yellow collar and one buttonhole on each side. The cuffs are yellow with three white embroidered buttonholes. One of the three buttons on each cuff is unbuttoned. On the tunic front are eight buttons. The shoulder straps are yellow with the royal cypher in silver. The buttonholes are edged in silver braid for non-commissioned officers (OR-6 and up) and silver embroidery for commissioned officers. The trousers have 2–3 mm wide yellow stripes.

The headgear is a or pickelhaube dating from 1887 and made out of varnished leather, with silver metal details. The spike on top can be replaced with a white plume made of white buffalo hair. The pickelhaube plate on front portrays the Lesser Coat of Arms with a lion holding a banner on each side.

In 1823, Emperor Alexander I of Russia presented King Charles XIV John with a gift of bearskin headdresses to be worn by the Svea Life Guards. The next year the Second Life Guards (later Göta Life Guards) were also presented with bearskin of the same design. The bearskin headdresses are still worn by the Grenadier Company during state visits and the State Opening of Parliament each year. It is today made of nylon instead of real bearskin because the smell (would it get wet) is said to scare the horses during parades.

The weapon mainly used in ceremonial duties is the mauser m/1896-1938 with bayonet. The standard issue Ak 5c may also be used as an exception together with the parade uniform. Officers carry the sword m/1899 with a gold and blue sword knot, while specialist officers carry the NCO pattern of the same sword, but with a silver and blue sword knot.

=== 1886 (Swedish Armed Forces Music Staff and Swedish Army Band) ===
The Royal Swedish Army Band wears the uniform of the Second Life Guards (later on the Göta Life Guards) that has an almost identical uniform to the Svea Life Guards, but with red facings on collars, cuffs and trouser stripes. From 1830 on the epaulets for officers have also differed slightly. Drummers wear white or silver chevrons across the sleeves of the tunic to stand out in battle. These were originally worn on the uniform from 1860 and earlier, but were restored as of 2010. Musicians with the rank of a soldier or group leader (OR-1/5) also wear white &quot;bragoons&quot; on the shoulders to stand out.

As most of the musicians have civil ranks, they wear all cockades in blue and yellow instead of full yellow. Musicians are not allowed to wear swords while marching, but may use the same sword as the infantry while appearing alone.

=== 1895 (Cavalry) ===
Those units which have inherited traditions from the cavalry wear the uniform of the Life Horse Guards dating from 1895. The shade of colour has changed a couple of times (even by mistake), but has now reverted to the original one where soldiers wear middle blue and officers a slightly lighter version of middle blue.

The headgear is a silver-plated cuirassier-type helmet from 1879. It was originally a dragoon-type back in 1879 but was changed into a cuirassier-type in 1900 and with some additions in 1928 it is now called helmet m/1879-1900-1928.

Officers wear a silver braid cross-belt with a silver cartouche box from 1847 with the Lesser Coat of Arms with the Royal Order of the Seraphim. Non-commissioned officers (OR-6 and above) wear a white braid cross-belt with a black leather cartouche box from 1895 with the Lesser Coat of Arms surrounded by beams and two swords, all in gold.

The weapon mainly used in ceremonial duties is the mauser m/1894-1914 with bayonet. The standard issue Ak 5c may also be used as an exception together with the parade uniform. Officers and specialist officers carry sword m/1893 with a gold and blue (officers) or silver and blue (specialist officers) sword knot. Soldiers carry the soldier&#x27;s sword pattern m/1893 on mounted duty or guard of honour, with a chamois leather sword knot.

==== Swedish Mounted Cavalry Band ====
Musicians with the equivalent rank of privates wear in the service dress red shoulder boards instead of the dragoons&#x27; white to distinguish them on the battlefield. They also wear white braid Prussian styled wings to even more be distinguished. Musicians with the rank of officers or specialist officers wear the same uniform as officers, with the exception of having a blue and yellow cockade instead of a full yellow (stating that they bear civil ranks).

==== Changes in 1928 ====
As of 1928, the Life Horse Guards (1st Cavalry) and Life Regiment Dragoons (2nd Cavalry) were amalgamated into the Life Regiment of Horse (1st Cavalry). The uniforms remained mostly the same as of the old 1st Cavalry, taking the traditions with some additions from the old 2nd Cavalry.
* The Officer&#x27;s Frock Coat m/1858 was middle blue (slightly lighter) for the 1st Cavalry, but after 1928 the model of the 2nd Cavalry was adapted, which is dark blue with black lacing.
* The helmet m/1879-1900 of the 1st Cavalry was added a golden laurel wreath, taken from the helmet of the 2nd Cavalry. This was added for all ranks. The helmet with its addition is now called helmet m/1879-1900-1928.
* The helmet m/1879-1900-1928 also got the straw wreath from the 2nd Cavalry (originally from &quot;great battles&quot;, but nowadays said to be from the Battle of Lund) put under the chin strap on the right side of the helmet for soldiers. Officers still wear a yellow silk cockade.
* The straw wreath was also put on the forage cap for all ranks, under the cap button badge.
* The officer version of helmet m/1879-1900-1928 was added the chin strap from the 2nd Cavalry made of lion mascarons and embossed plates. This change was added on paper at the time, however not adapted until later on.

=== Changes since 1950s ===
The military ranks of the Swedish Armed Forces have undergone changes throughout the years. With the introduction of a two-officer-system in 2009 (which distinguished between tactical officers (OF-1/9) and specialist officers (OR-6/9)) the following innovations were made: 
* Specialist officers now have a helmet plate in white enamel, while tactical officers still wear blue enamel (2009).
* Specialist officers&#x27; uniforms are based on that worn by sergeants.
* New epaulettes based on historic models have been reintroduced for specialist officers.
* One to three chevrons are used instead of diagonal stripes by lance corporals (OR-3), corporals (OR-4) and sergeants (OR-5) as of after 2009.
* The colour of the parade uniform worn by the cavalry was in the 1950s changed to match the officer&#x27;s &quot;mid-blue&quot; shade: (a slightly lighter colour) for all ranks. In the 1990s the colour was again changed, apparently in error, to a royal blue colour. The shade for other ranks is now to revert to mid-blue, while officers will retain &quot;middle blue, slightly lighter&quot;.
* Trouser (as opposed to riding breeches) have not historically been worn by other ranks, but only by officers when dismounted. Trousers for all ranks were however adopted in 1999, because of the increase in occasions on which Royal Guards were required to perform their duties on foot.
* A modern version of the early 19th century forage or stable cap was re-introduced for the infantry of the Life Guards in 2004/2005 and the cavalry in 2015. This headdress is of the same basic pattern as that worn by His Majesty The King&#x27;s Guard of Norway.

==Colours, heraldry and traditions==

===Colours and standards===
When a Swedish military unit, as regards traditions, is amalgamated with another, both colours will be carried together. In principle this will go on as long as both colours are usable. When one of the two (or more) no longer can be repaired, the unit will be granted a new colour. This new colour will reflect the traditions of both units without altering the prescribed model. Exceptions from this rule are, among others, the Life Guards which present both the colour of the former Svea Life Guards (I 1) and the standard of the former Life Guard Dragoons (K 1). For the Life Guards the colours will be white and show the Swedish Royal coat of arms without mantle. Kettledrum banners type B have a cloth moulded in two rows of flaps. The Life Guards is the only unit which may use kettledrum banners of this type and then only to kettledrums made of silver. The Dragoon Battalion of the Life Guards may use a white trumpet banner with three open crowns in the centre, placed two and one, all in gold. embroidered décor and a fringe made of gold thread.

====Life Guards colour====
The colour of the Life Guards was presented to the then Svea Life Guards and the Life Guards Brigade on 30 April 2000 by His Majesty the King Carl XVI Gustaf at the Stockholm Palace in connection with his birthday. It was used by the two units until the amalgamation with the Life Guard Dragoons (K 1) on 1 July 2000. The colour is also carried by the Guards Battalion of the Life Guards. The colour is drawn by Bengt Olof Kälde and embroidered by hand in insertion technique by Maj-Britt Salander/company Blå Kusten. Blazon: &quot;On white cloth in the centre the greater coat of arms of Sweden as to the law without mantle. In each corner a royal crown proper with red lining. Battle honours (Swedish War of Liberation 1521, Rhine 1631, Lützen 1632, Warsaw 1656, Tåget över Bält 1658, Halmstad 1676, Lund 1676, Landskrona 1677, Narva 1700, Düna 1701, Kliszów 1702, Holowczyn 1708, Svensksund 1790) in yellow horizontally placed above and below the coat of arms.&quot;

In 2016, the Swedish Armed Forces decided to manufacture a new colour based on the motif of the old colour and that it be ordered according to regular routines with the National Swedish Museums of Military History (SFHM) with Swedish Army Museum as supplier. The reason for ordering a new colour was that the regiment has often participated in state ceremonial activities, which contributed to the wear and tear of the then current colour and the need for a new one. The new colour had the Friends of Handicraft as a subcontractor. The new colour was presented by His Majesty the King Carl XVI Gustaf on 24 November 2017 at the Inner Courtyard at Stockholm Palace. The 2017 colour has the same blazon as the 2000 colour.

====Life Guards standard====
The standard was presented to the then Life Guard Dragoons (K 1) at the regimental barracks in Stockholm by His Majesty the King Carl XVI Gustaf on 4 December 1995 - the regimental memorial day of the battle of Lund in 1676. It was used by the regiment until the amalgamation with the Svea Life Guards on 1 July 2000. The standard is also carried by the Dragoon Battalion of the Life Guards. The standard is drawn by Bengt Olof Kälde and embroidered by hand in insertion technique by Maj-Britt Salander/company Blå Kusten. Blazon: &quot;On white cloth in the centre the Swedish Royal coat of arms as to the law without mantle. In each corner a royal crown proper with red lining. On the reverse battle honours (Lützen 1632, Lund 1676, Oldendorf 1633, Landskrona 1677, Wittstock 1636, Düna 1701, Leipzig 1642, Kliszów 1702, Warszawa 1656, Pultusk 1703, Fredriksodde 1658, Holowczyn 1708, Tåget över Bält 1658, Hälsingborg 1710, Halmstad 1676, Svensksund 1790) horizontally placed and in each corner three open crowns placed two and one (a legacy from the former Royal Life Regiment Dragoons, K 2), all yellow. White fringe.&quot; A new standard was presented by His Majesty the King Carl XVI Gustaf on 19 March 2014 at the Cavalry Barracks (). The standard was made by Kristina Holmgård Semitjov, the same artist who made the 2016 colour of the Life Guards.

====Life Company colour====

The colour of the Svea Life Guards&#x27; Life company was presented in 1868 by Her Majesty the Queen Lovisa who also embroidered it by hand together with her ladies-in-waiting. Blazon: &quot;On white cloth in the centre the Royal monogram of His Majesty the King Charles XV between three open crowns, all yellow and with red lining in the crowns. Fringe of golden threads.&quot;

===Coat of arms===
The coat of the arms of the Life Guards. Blazon: &quot;Azure, the lesser coat of arms of Sweden, three open crowns or placed two and one. The shield surmounted a musket bendwise and a rapier bendwise sinister in saltire, both argent and is surrounded by the chain of the Royal Order of the Seraphim, placed under crown, musket and rapier&quot;.

===Medals===
When the regiment was raised in 2000, the (&quot;Life Guards Medal of Merit I&quot;) in gold and silver (LGIGM/SM) of the 8th size was established. The medal ribbon is of yellow moiré with a white stripe on each side both followed on both sides by a blue line. His Majesty the King&#x27;s monogram is attached to the ribbon. This medal was established in 1999 as the (&quot;Svea Life Guards (I 1) and Life Guards Brigade (IB 1) Medal of Merit&quot;) (SvealivgLivgbrigGM/SM).

In 2001, (&quot;Life Guards (LG) Medal of Merit II&quot;) in gold and silver (LGIIGM/SM) was established. This medal was originally established in 1993 as the (&quot;Life Guard Dragoons (K 1) Medal of Merit&quot;) in gold and silver (LGDGM/SM). The medal was a Maltese cross and the medal ribbon was of blue moiré with a white stripe on each side. His Majesty the King&#x27;s monogram in gold/silver is attached to the ribbon.

In 2004, (&quot;Life Guards Medal of Merit III&quot;) in gold and silver (LGIIIGM/SM) of the 8th size was established. The medalj ribbon of the gold medal is blue with two yellow lines on each side and a yellow stripe on the middle. The medal ribbon of the silver medal is yellow moiré with two blue lines on each side and a blue stripe on the middle. The obverse differs, however, this is due to the different units of the Life Guards.

===Heritage===

The Life Guards continue the traditional heritage primarily of Svea Life Guards (I 1) Livkompaniet Light Mechanized Urban Warfare Infantry, Life Guard Dragoons (K 1) as well as the Swedish Armed Forces International Centre (, SWEDINT) and the Swedish Armed Forces Music Centre (, FöMusC). Secondarily, the Life Guards carry today the traditional heritage of Royal guard duty, by the Livkompaniet Life Guards Infantry/Grenadiers Seen in the dark blue Uniform and of the Dragoonbattalion on Horse (K 1), Life Regiment Dragoons seen in the light blue uniform (K 2), Swedish Armed Forces UN School (), National Swedish Defence Dog Training Centre (, HS) and the musical traditions of the Swedish Armed Forces Military Bands ().

==Commanding officers==
The King&#x27;s role as Supreme Commander was abolished with the 1974 Instrument of Government. Since then, the King/Head of state is the chief representative of the Swedish Armed Forces (see Bill 1993/94:115). The King is traditionally also honorary Colonel-in-chief of the Life Guards (and the Life Regiment Hussars). From 2013 to 2017, the regimental commander was also the commanding officer of the Central Military Region. The commander of the Life Guards was from 2000 to 2017 also the Commandant of Stockholm. Previously, Defence District Commanders and also other regimental commanders in Stockholm Garrison have also served as Commandants of Stockholm. Today the billet of Commandant of the Life Guards is a standalone appointment, responsible for overall command of the regiment administratively.

<doc id="1024501" wikidata="Q740516" url="?curid=1024501" title="Conan the Destroyer">
<text>Conan the Destroyer is a 1984 American epic sword-and-sorcery film directed by Richard Fleischer from a screenplay by Stanley Mann and a story by Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway. Based on the character Conan the Barbarian created by Robert E. Howard, it is the sequel to &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; (1982). The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mako reprising their roles as Conan and Akiro, the Wizard of the Mounds, respectively. The cast also includes Grace Jones, Wilt Chamberlain, Tracey Walter, and Olivia d&#x27;Abo.

&quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on June 29, 1984, by Universal Pictures. Upon release, the film received generally mixed reviews from critics. It grossed between $26.4 million and $31 million in the United States and Canada and earned theatrical rentals of $30 million worldwide.

==Plot==
Conan and his companion, the thief Malak, are confronted by Queen Taramis of Shadizar, who tests their combat ability with several of her guards. Satisfied, she tells Conan that she has a quest for him. He refuses her, but when she promises to resurrect his lost love, Valeria, Conan agrees to the quest. He is to escort the Queen&#x27;s niece, Princess Jehnna, a virgin, who is destined to restore the jeweled horn of the dreaming god Dagoth. The magic gem Heart of Ahriman must first be retrieved, in order to locate the horn. Conan and Malak are joined by Bombaata, the captain of Taramis&#x27;s guard. Bombaata has secret orders to kill Conan once the gem is obtained.

The gem is secured in the fortress of a powerful wizard, so Conan seeks the help of his friend Akiro, the Wizard of the Mounds, who must first be rescued from a tribe of cannibals who have captured him. The adventurers encounter Zula, a powerful bandit warrior being tortured by vengeful villagers. Freeing Zula at Jehnna&#x27;s request, Conan accepts the indebted warrior&#x27;s offer to join their quest.

The adventurers travel to the castle of Thoth-Amon, where the gem is located. As they sleep by the lake surrounding the castle, the wizard takes the form of a giant bird and kidnaps Jehnna. In the morning Akiro divines this and also divines a hidden entrance to the castle through a water gate. As they search for Jehnna, Conan is separated from the group, and the others are forced to watch him battle a fierce man-beast in a hall of mirrors. Conan&#x27;s strikes uselessly pass through it without any harm, but he discovers that breaking the mirrors inflicts damage to the creature. By breaking all of them, Conan mortally wounds and reveals the creature as a polymorphed Thoth-Amon. With the wizard&#x27;s death, the castle begins to collapse, forcing the group&#x27;s hasty retreat. They are ambushed by Taramis&#x27;s guards, but drive them off. Bombaata feigns ignorance about the attack. The gem reveals where the jeweled horn is. Later that night, Jehnna expresses romantic interest in Conan; but he rebuffs her and declares his devotion to Valeria.

They reach an ancient temple, where the horn is secured. Jehnna obtains it while Akiro deciphers engravings. He learns that Jehnna will be ritually sacrificed to awaken Dagoth. They are attacked by the priests guarding the horn. A secret exit is revealed, but Bombaata blocks the others&#x27; escape and seizes Jehnna. Despite this treachery, Conan and his allies escape from the priests and trek to Shadizar to rescue Jehnna.

Malak shows them a secret route to the throne room. Conan confronts Bombaata and kills him in combat. Zula impales the Grand Vizier before he can sacrifice Jehnna. Dagoth animates after the horn is set in his brow, but transforms into a vile behemoth. He kills Taramis, then attacks Conan. Zula and Malak join the fight, but Dagoth effortlessly sweeps them aside. Akiro tells Conan that the horn keeps the monster alive, so he rips it out, then finishes him off.

The newly crowned Queen Jehnna offers each of her companions a place in her new court: Zula will be the new captain of the guard, Akiro the queen&#x27;s advisor, and Malak the court jester. Jehnna offers Conan marriage and the opportunity to rule the kingdom of Shadizar with her as king and queen, but he politely declines, saying &quot;I will have my own kingdom, and my own queen&quot;, and departs after a simple kiss. A closing title card says that this quest &quot;is another story.&quot;

==Production==
===Toning down the violence===
When John Milius, director of &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;, was unavailable, Dino De Laurentiis suggested Richard Fleischer to his daughter Raffaella De Laurentiis, who was producing &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot;. Fleischer had already made &quot;Barabbas&quot; (1961) and &quot;Mandingo&quot; (1975) for Dino De Laurentiis.

&quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; made about $40 million at the U.S. box office when it was released in 1982 with an R-rating, and an additional $50 million in other markets. Because Universal Pictures and producer Dino De Laurentiis thought it would have been even more successful if it had been less violent, they wanted to tone down the violence in the sequel. &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; originally received an R-rating like its predecessor, but the film was recut to secure a PG-rating. Fleischer delivered a movie that was less violent (and somewhat more humorous) than the first, although some scenes of violence have bloody results (the PG-13 rating did not exist until July 1 of that same year). Carlo Rambaldi created the Dagoth monster.

===Casting===
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mako Iwamatsu, who played the Wizard of the Mound and narrator in the first film, return for the second film, while Mako&#x27;s character is now named Akiro. Sven-Ole Thorsen, who played Thorgrim in the first film, also returned. However, this time, he had to partially cover his face with a mask, as he was playing a different character. Singer Grace Jones played the warrior Zula, the last of her tribe. This was the basketball player Wilt Chamberlain&#x27;s only film role and the debut of Olivia d&#x27;Abo, who played the petulant teenaged princess. David Lander was originally cast to play the foolish thief Malak, but due to his deteriorating health from the onset of multiple sclerosis, he was forced to quit the project, and the part was recast with Tracey Walter. Professional wrestler Pat Roach, who memorably played the German Mechanic in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; and the Thuggee Overseer in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, was cast as crystal palace Man Ape/sorcerer Toth-Amon. André the Giant had an uncredited role as the Dagoth monster.

===Photography===
&quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; was the fourth film on which British director of photography Jack Cardiff worked with Fleischer. Cardiff had already photographed &quot;The Vikings&quot; (1958), &quot;Crossed Swords&quot; (1977), and &quot;Amityville 3-D&quot; (1983) for the director. They worked together twice more on &quot;Million Dollar Mystery&quot; (1987), and Fleischer&#x27;s last film, the short &quot;Call from Space&quot; (1989), which was shot in the 65-mm Showscan process. Cardiff&#x27;s other notable films include John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The African Queen&quot; (1951), King Vidor&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot; (1956), and &quot;&quot; (1985).

===Filming===
Shooting took place in Mexico City from November 1, 1983, to February 10, 1984.

===Deleted scenes===
To secure a PG rating, Sarah Douglas said several scenes involving her character were cut, including a sex scene with Schwarzenegger, slapping Chamberlain, a virgin sacrifice, and the seduction of a statue.

==Music==

The musical score of &quot;Conan The Destroyer&quot; was composed, conducted, and produced by Basil Poledouris, and it was performed by the orchestra Unione Musicisti Di Roma. Basil, who scored director John Milius&#x27;s Big Wednesday, also scored Milius&#x27;s first Conan, and the track “The Orgy” is used again, this time during the attempted virgin sacrifice at the end.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; grossed $31 million in the U.S. It earned theatrical rentals of $30.1 million worldwide. Schwarzenegger, Fleischer, and De Laurentiis subsequently teamed up again to make &quot;Red Sonja&quot; a year later. The film, jointly with &quot;Bolero&quot;, was nominated for two Razzie Awards, including Worst Supporting Actress and won Worst New Star for D&#x27;Abo during the 5th Golden Raspberry Awards.

===Critical response===
Roger Ebert rated the film 3 out of 4 stars and wrote that &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; is &quot;sillier, funnier, and more entertaining&quot; than the first film. In praising the film&#x27;s use of character actors, Ebert singled out Jones, who he said brings rock star charisma to her role. &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;the ideal sword and sorcery picture&quot; and also praised Jones. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Schwarzenegger struggles with the film&#x27;s more comedic tone.

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;Apart from the fact that it is acted by real people, &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; is pure comicbook, which has the odd effect of making the actual animated comicbook largely superfluous.&quot;

Rotten Tomatoes, which collects both contemporary and modern reviews, reports that 26% of 27 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4.4/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; softens the edges that gave its predecessor gravitas, resulting in a campy sequel without the comparative thrills.&quot; At Metacritic the film received a score of 53 out of 100, based on 12 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews.

==Other media==
===Comic books and graphic novel===
Marvel Comics published a comic-book adaptation of the film by writer Michael Fleisher and artist John Buscema in &quot;Marvel Super Special&quot; #35 (Dec. 1984). The adaptation was also available as a two-issue limited series.

Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway wrote the original story treatment but were dissastified with the final screenplay by Stanley Mann and the finished film. They made their story into the graphic novel &quot;Conan the Barbarian: The Horn of Azoth&quot;, published in 1990, with art by Mike Docherty. The names of the characters were changed to distance the graphic novel from the movie: Dagoth became Azoth, Jehnna became Natari, Zula became Shumballa, Bombaata became Strabo, Thoth-Amon became Rammon, and the characters of Queen Taramis and The Leader were combined into sorcerer Karanthes, father of Natari.

===Novelization===
Robert Jordan wrote a novelization of the film in 1984 for Tor Books.

===Sequel===
The third film in the &quot;Conan&quot; trilogy had been planned for a 1987 release with the title &quot;Conan the Conqueror&quot;. The director was to have been either Guy Hamilton or John Guillermin. Arnold Schwarzenegger was committed to the film &quot;Predator&quot;, and De Laurentiis&#x27;s contract with the star had expired after his obligation to &quot;Red Sonja&quot; (his role in which was originally intended to be Conan) and &quot;Raw Deal&quot;, and he was not keen to negotiate a new one. The third &quot;Conan&quot; film fell into development hell, the script eventually being turned into &quot;Kull the Conqueror&quot;.

In October 2012, Universal Pictures announced plans for Schwarzenegger to return to the role of Conan for the film &quot;The Legend of Conan&quot;. The planned story was a direct sequel to the original film, &quot;bypassing&quot; &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; and the 2011 film starring Jason Momoa. In the years following the announcement, Will Beall, Andrea Berloff, and producer Chris Morgan worked on the script, and Schwarzenegger expressed enthusiasm for the project, affirming plans to star in the film. However, in April 2017, Morgan stated that Universal had dropped the project, but that there remains a possibility of a television series. In October 2019, Arnold Schwarzenegger confirmed that the film was still in active development, now called &quot;Conan the King&quot;.

===In popular culture===
Kim Wayans&#x27; spoof portrayals of Grace Jones on the show &quot;In Living Color&quot; are based on Grace&#x27;s performance of Zula in &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot;. In 1985, Australian heavy metal music group &quot;Prowler&quot; changed its name to Taramis after the character from the film.

<text>Sir Martin John Taylor, FRS (born 18 February 1952) is a British mathematician and academic. He was Professor of Pure Mathematics at the School of Mathematics, University of Manchester and, prior to its formation and merger, UMIST where he was appointed to a chair after moving from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1986. He was elected Warden of Merton College, Oxford on 5 November 2009, took office on 2 October 2010 and retired in September 2018.

== Early life and education ==
Taylor was born in Leicester in 1952 and educated at Wyggeston Grammar School. He gained a first class degree from Pembroke College, Oxford in 1973, and a Ph.D. from King&#x27;s College London with a thesis entitled &quot;Galois module structure of the ring of integers of l-extensions&quot; in 1976 under the supervision of Albrecht Fröhlich.

== Research ==
His early research concerned various properties and structures of algebraic numbers. In 1981 he proved the Fröhlich conjecture relating the symmetries of algebraic integers to the behaviour of certain analytic functions called Artin L-functions. In recent years his research has led him to study various aspects of arithmetic geometry: in particular, he and his collaborators have demonstrated how geometric properties of zeros of integral polynomials in many variables can be determined by the behaviour of associated L-functions.

== Awards ==
Taylor was awarded the London Mathematical Society Whitehead Prize in 1982 and shared the Adams Prize in 1983. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1996. He was President of the London Mathematical Society from 1998 to 2000 and in 2004 was appointed Physical Secretary and Vice-President of the Royal Society. Taylor was knighted in the 2009 New Year Honours. Taylor received an honorary Doctorate of Science from the University of East Anglia in July 2012.

== Personal life ==
His hobbies include fly fishing and hill walking, and he is an enthusiastic supporter of Manchester United.

<doc id="1024505" wikidata="Q3551501" url="?curid=1024505" title="Thompson Rivers University">
<text>Thompson Rivers University (commonly referred to as TRU) is a public research university located in Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada. The university&#x27;s name comes from the two rivers which converge in Kamloops, the North Thompson and South Thompson. The university has five academic faculties, the smallest being the Faculty of Law and the largest being the Faculty of Science, as well as three schools: the Bob Gaglardi School of Business and Economics, the School of Nursing, and the School of Trades and Technology. In addition to its primary campus in Kamloops, the university has a satellite campus in Williams Lake and a distance education division, TRU-Open Learning. TRU is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities at the associate, baccalaureate and master&#x27;s degree levels.

==History==

===20th century===
In 1970, Kamloops, the largest population centre in the region now known as the Thompson-Nicola Regional District, was chosen by the Government of British Columbia as the site for one of several new two-year regional colleges to provide academic and vocational programs outside of the largest cities of Vancouver and Victoria served by the province&#x27;s three universities. The province founded Cariboo College in 1970. Classes for 367 full-time and 200 part-time students began in September, 1970, held in buildings at the Kamloops Indian Residential School for that first year.

Cariboo College offered two-year academic programs that enabled students to transfer to UBC and the recently established Simon Fraser University (SFU) and University of Victoria (UVic). The college also began vocational training programs to serve the needs of forestry, mining and other industries in the region. Cariboo&#x27;s vocational division, now known as the School of Trades and Technology, was established following the move of the college to the new campus built along McGill Road in September 1971. In May 1972, Premier of British Columbia W.A.C. Bennett officially opened the vocational wing. By provincial mandate, Cariboo amalgamated with the Kamloops Vocational School in 1974, providing training for occupations in demand in Kamloops and the region.

In 1978, Cariboo College was officially designated as a college with corporate status under the British Columbia Colleges and Provincial Institutes Act, gaining its own board independent of the school boards that had previously governed it. The Act also created the Open Learning Institute (OLI), which would later become TRU Open Learning, to provide academic programs and vocational training by distance throughout the province to people who were unable to access post-secondary education due to geographic isolation or other reasons. The following year, the Universities Act gave OLI power to grant baccalaureate degrees in arts or science in its own name.

In the first 20 years, the college&#x27;s population increased from 30 faculty serving 367 full-time and 200 part-time students in the first year, to 259 full-time and 124 part-time employees serving 3,047 full-time and 2,205 part-time students. As enrolment rose, Cariboo College built more than a dozen new facilities and an on-campus student housing complex, as well as renovating and expanding older buildings. In 1971, the college opened a satellite campus in Williams Lake, BC, 285 kilometres north of Kamloops, offering programs to surrounding communities, including remote Indigenous populations. In 1985, the Williams Lake campus moved to the 55,000 square-foot Hodgeson Road facility, which would later close due to seismic instability.

In 1989, Cariboo College was one of three colleges chosen by the province to become a new entity, a &quot;university college,&quot; to provide degrees in regional centres. Cariboo&#x27;s five bachelor&#x27;s degrees — Arts, Science, Education, Business Administration and Nursing — were initially developed and granted under the oversight of the province&#x27;s three established universities: UBC, SFU and UVic. When the first graduates received their degrees in June 1991, Cariboo was renamed the University College of the Cariboo (UCC).

In January 1995, the College and Institute Amendment Act gave UCC the authority to independently grant degrees. Several new programs launched in the decade that followed, including five more bachelor&#x27;s degrees and the Adventure Guide Diploma. Construction in the 1990s included a cost-recovery-based joint proposal between UCC and the student society to complete the 53,000 square-foot, student-focused Campus Activity Centre, after a change in provincial legislation in 1990 allowed the college to borrow money privately for development.

UCC began to offer master&#x27;s degree programs in collaboration with UBC and SFU in 2002, then gained the authority to grant applied master&#x27;s degrees autonomously in 2003. The following year, the BC government announced UCC would become the province&#x27;s newest university.

In March 2005, Thompson Rivers University (TRU) was incorporated under the Thompson Rivers University Act. The Act amalgamated the University College of the Cariboo with the BC Open University and other aspects of the Open Learning Agency, converting UCC&#x27;s university council into a senate and creating a planning council for Open Learning. UCC President Dr. Roger Barnsley continued at the helm of the new institution. The province designated TRU as a special-purpose university that would continue to offer undergraduate and master&#x27;s degrees, vocational training and adult basic education, undertake research and scholarly activities and, with the addition of Open Learning programs and courses, would provide an open learning educational credit bank for students.

TRU&#x27;s inaugural convocation was held March 31, 2005, along with the installation of its first chancellor, Nancy Greene Raine. Prime Minister Paul Martin was TRU&#x27;s first official visitor the following day. The Master of Business Administration, TRU&#x27;s first autonomous master&#x27;s degree program, began that September.

The 11-storey TRU Residence and Conference Centre building, a 580-room apartment-style student residence, opened in 2006. In 2007, the Williams Lake campus opened on Western Avenue. All Open Learning operations (TRU-OL) relocated from Burnaby to the new BC Centre for Open Learning building on the Kamloops campus.

Dr. Kathleen Scherf was installed as TRU&#x27;s second president in 2008, but was dismissed by TRU&#x27;s board of governors in 2009. Roger Barnsley returned to serve two more years as president during the search for Scherf&#x27;s replacement. Dr. Alan Shaver was installed as TRU&#x27;s third president in 2011, and the Honourable Wally Oppal was installed as chancellor. Dr. Brett Fairbairn started as TRU&#x27;s fourth president on Dec. 1, 2018, with installation taking place at convocation in June 2019.

The university became a member of the Research Universities Council of BC (RUCBC) in 2011. The Brown Family House of Learning, TRU&#x27;s first LEED Gold-certified building, opened in 2011 and was the initial home of TRU Faculty of Law, the first new law school to open in Canada in over 30 years. TRU Law moved into a 44,000-square-foot space in the newly renovated Old Main building in December 2013. Law&#x27;s first graduating class convocated in June 2014.

By 2017, the university agreed to lease space for a private high school intended to teach mainland Chinese citizens intending to enter Western university systems. This agreement has since ended.

In April 2018 TRU announced they were naming Brett Fairbairn as their new president. Fairbairn had previously resigned from the University of Saskatchewan in 2014 following a scandal regarding his decision to terminate the head of the school&#x27;s Health Director and have him escorted off campus by security.

In February 2021 complaints surfaced from several current and former TRU staff of anti-Indigenous racism, sexual harassment and bullying. Vice-presidents Matt Milovick and Larry Phillips were accused of fostering a toxic workplace. A full investigation was launched that fall. Larry Phillips soon left TRU. Matt Milovick remained in his role causing concerns. By early 2022 TRU staff and faculty went public with their concerns, and a lack of confidence in the investigation process. The TRU Faculty Association passed a vote of non-confidence in the leadership of President Bett Fairbairn, and Board Chair Marilyn McLean.

In the 2021–22 academic year, TRU had a total headcount* of 27,701 students, of whom 13,638 were on campus. Due to the fact that some students are dually enrolled in on-campus and Open Learning courses, the total headcount gives the unique total for the entire institution, not a sum of on-campus and Open Learning students. International students made up 20 per cent of TRU&#x27;s on-campus student population, with China, India and Saudi Arabia topping the list of 113 countries of origin. Indigenous students made up 10.5 per cent of the student body. Open Learning students totalled 15,818 students.

In the 2022–23 academic year, TRU had a total headcount* of 27, 632 students, of whom 14,525 were on campus. Open Learning students totalled 14,996 students, and there were 1,889 students that were dually enrolled in both online and in-person classes. There were 2,708 Indigenous students and international students made up 24 per cent of TRU&#x27;s on-campus student population.

On 17 January 2023 TRU released a heavily redacted report from their $1 million investigation that substantiated 10 allegations. Less than a month later VP Matt Milovick launched a defamation lawsuit against his accusers. In April former VP Larry Phillips sued President Brett Fairbairn. In June it was announced Fairbairn would be stepping down as TRU president. A copy of the report with fewer redactions was provided by TRU in March 2024.

== Campuses ==

TRU&#x27;s 250-acre main campus in Kamloops is situated on McGill Road in the city&#x27;s southwest Sahali area, overlooking the junction of the North and South Thompson rivers from which the university takes its name. The campus has 40 acres of gardens and the largest arboretum in BC&#x27;s Interior. Residences provide on-campus housing for 1,472 students. Kamloops, a city of about 100,000 people, is located in the semi-arid grasslands of the Thompson-Nicola region of British Columbia&#x27;s southwestern Interior, on the traditional lands of the Secwépemc (Shuswap) people. TRU has a satellite campus in Williams Lake in BC&#x27;s Cariboo-Chilcotin region, and regional centres in 100 Mile House, Clearwater, Barriere, Ashcroft and Lillooet.

=== Kamloops ===
After one year operating out of the school district&#x27;s various facilities, such as the Kamloops Indian Residential School property, Cariboo College moved to the current campus on McGill Road in September 1971, sharing the newly constructed Main building with the Kamloops Vocational School. Much of the campus had been part of a Canadian Navy munitions base and several of the officers&#x27; quarters were put to use and remain as heritage buildings on today&#x27;s campus.

Construction was a constant on Cariboo College&#x27;s campus to meet the needs of a rapidly expanding student body. The Library and Gymnasium opened in fall of 1976. The Science building was completed in 1980 and the Visual Arts building opened the following year. Construction began on student residences in 1988 and Hillside Stadium opened. The next year saw the completion of the Clock Tower building and Alumni Theatre, and the addition of a second storey on the Main building&#x27;s B block for classroom and bookstore space.

As part of Cariboo&#x27;s application to become a university college in 1989, the first campus plan was developed with the requirement that every building have an official name. Without a single faculty or function to identify it, the 18-year-old Main or Main block building, as the oldest and most central building on campus, officially became Old Main when Cariboo College became the University College of the Cariboo.

Construction in the 1990s continued as the influx of undergraduate students kept growing. UCC doubled the size of the Library and Science buildings and opened the Computer Access Centre downtown on Victoria Street in 1991. The Arts and Education (A&amp;E) building was built in two phases from 1991 to 1993. Beside A&amp;E, the 53,000-square-foot Campus Activity Centre, which includes the campus bookstore, a cafeteria, pub, retail spaces, meeting rooms and the student union office and coffee shop, opened in 1993 thanks to a cost-recovery-based joint proposal between UCC and the student society. This was able to happen after a change in legislation in 1990 allowed the college to borrow money privately for development.

Also in 1993, UCC opened a new campus daycare facility, the Hillside Stadium track house, the Williams Lake campus extension, a regional centre in Ashcroft and the Wells Gray Education and Research Centre. The facilities at UCC, next door to the city&#x27;s new Canada Games Pool, were integral to Kamloops hosting the 1993 Canada Summer Games. More regional centres opened in Merritt and Lillooet in 1994, and the Trades and Technology Centre was completed in 1997. The International Building opened in 2002 to house the growing international education department (now known as TRU World).
The Brown Family House of Learning building opened in 2011, housing TRU&#x27;s library and a learning commons. It was the first TRU building to be awarded Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold status for sustainable construction. Its adjoining theatre-in-the-round has a ceiling made of pine-beetle-killed pine wood and a green roof in a design modelled after an Interior Salish pit house.
Old Main, the first building constructed on the Kamloops campus, was partly renovated and expanded in 2013 and it got a second phase of upgrades in 2021. The TRU Faculty of Law moved into the 44,000-square-foot addition in December 2013 and officially launched the space to coincide with convocation of its first graduating class in June 2014. The renovation won several awards, including an Honour Award of Excellence for 2014 from the Society for College and University Planning and the American Institute of Architects.

The Industrial Training and Technology Centre (ITTC) opened in September 2018 at a cost of $30 million. The 5,344-square-metre building positions the School of Trades and Technology and Faculty of Science to meet student and labour-market demand. There is space designed for new programs on campus, including industrial process technician, power engineering, HVAC/refrigeration technician, and machinist. The two-storey, state-of-the-art centre features classrooms, lab and shop areas, and it connects to the adjacent Trades and Technology building via a covered walkway. As some programs move from the Trades and Technology building to the ITTC, the Faculty of Science&#x27;s Architectural and Engineering Technology (ARET) program takes its place in renovated spaces, leading to growth opportunities for ARET, including expansion to a fourth year. The changes made possible by the new building enable collaboration, applied research and training spanning the sciences and engineering disciplines.

The Chappell Family Building for Nursing and Population Health opened in 2020, with a total cost of $37.2 million. The Province of BC contributed $8 million. The building is a 4,550-square-metre facility encompassing classrooms, patient simulation labs, interdisciplinary health clinics, home-care space, student lounges and breakout rooms. It is a hub for health-care teaching and learning, and supports collaborative learning for interdisciplinary teams, bringing together students in respiratory therapy, social work and medical residency. It also fosters creativity and innovation, and support research designed to improve health outcomes.

Critical to student success are the building&#x27;s patient simulation labs. Equipped with advanced technology, high-fidelity simulation manikins and space similar to that of real health-care settings, these labs will better prepare students for working conditions after graduation.

Most recently, the Ken Lepin Science Building — which is home to sciences, health sciences and nursing — has undergone a major renovation in 2023.

=== The Reach ===

TRU completed a Campus Master Plan in 2013, which set out future development of the Kamloops campus using a &quot;university village&quot; model. Aside from increasing density and enhancing campus life, the university village development will also provide a revenue stream that will raise money for scholarships, bursaries and research. A corporate trustee, TRU Community Trust (TRUCT), was created as a way for the development to progress but remain at arm&#x27;s length from the university, which under current provincial post-secondary risk management policies, cannot directly control the project.

The project is known as The Reach. The goal is to develop 90 acres on campus in six phases with a total build out of 46,600 square feet of retail space, 40,000 square feet of office space and 3,500 residential units. Some of the residential projects have been completed, including Legacy Square and Liberty Pointe by the Kelson Group and Creston House by the Cape Group.

== Governance and academics ==

TRU is a public post-secondary institution, funded by the province of British Columbia through the Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Training. As legislated by the province in the Thompson Rivers University Act, the purposes of the university are to offer baccalaureate and master&#x27;s degree programs, to offer post-secondary and adult basic education and training, to undertake and maintain research and scholarly activities, and to provide an open learning educational credit bank for students. The university must promote teaching excellence and the use of open learning methods. In carrying out its purposes, the university must serve the educational and training needs in the region specified by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, and the open learning needs of British Columbia.

Governance at TRU is divided into three bodies responsible for corporate and academic decision-making, as legislated by the province in the University Act and the Thompson Rivers University Act. The Board of Governors is responsible for budgetary, operational and administrative matters. The Senate makes decisions on such academic matters as curriculum, credentials, admissions and educational policies. The Planning Council for Open Learning is similarly responsible for academic matters relating to the Open Learning Division. Provincial legislation mandates the composition, powers and duties of each governing body as well as the degree-granting powers of the university. Individual degree programs are approved by the Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Training.

The University Act also legislates the leadership of the university, including the powers, duties and offices of the president. The president holds the offices of vice-chancellor, member of the Board of Governors and chair of the Senate. The president and vice-chancellor is the chief executive officer, responsible to the Board and Senate for the supervision of TRU&#x27;s administrative and academic work. Advising and reporting to the president are the provost and vice-president academic, the vice-president administration and finance, the vice-president university relations, the vice-president international, the vice-president research, the associate vice-president marketing and communications, and the executive director Indigenous education.

TRU offers 140 on-campus programs, and about 60 distance or online programs through its Open Learning Division, in the following faculties and schools:

* Faculty of Adventure, Culinary Arts and Tourism
* Faculty of Arts
* Bob Gaglardi School of Business and Economics
* Faculty of Education and Social Work
* Faculty of Law
* School of Nursing
* Faculty of Science
* Faculty of Student Development
* School of Trades and Technology

TRU also has two divisions: Open Learning, offering distance, online and blended learning options to students in all faculties and schools; and TRU World, serving international and study abroad students.

<text>The Zamoyski Academy (; ; 1594–1784) was an academy founded in 1594 by Polish Crown Chancellor Jan Zamoyski. It was the third institution of higher education to be founded in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. After his death it slowly lost its importance, and in 1784 it was downgraded to a lyceum. The present-day &quot;I Liceum Ogólnokształcące im. Hetmana Jana Zamoyskiego w Zamościu&quot; is one of several secondary schools in Zamość.

==History==
The Zamoyski Academy was designed to educate &quot;szlachta&quot; (noble) youth in Humanist culture and prepare them for work in the public interest—though, from its early years, most of the students were burghers, not nobles. It was founded in 1594 by Crown Chancellor Jan Zamoyski in Zamość (a city, also founded by Zamoyski) with the assistance of poet Szymon Szymonowic, &quot;aka&quot; Simon Simonides (who would be one of the Academy&#x27;s lecturers). Its founding was approved in Rome by Pope Clement VIII (bull of October 29, 1594), and in Poland by the Bishop of Chełm, Stanisław Gomoliński. The official opening ceremony took place on 15 March 1595. On July 5, 1600, Zamoyski would write, in the Academy&#x27;s foundation act: &quot;such are countries, as is the education of their youth&quot; (&quot;takie są rzeczypospolite, jakie ich młodzieży chowanie&quot;). In 1601 the King of Poland, Sigismund III Vasa, confirmed the act.

The Academy was modeled on the Academy of Strassburg. Initially the Academy comprised three departments: liberal arts, law, and medicine, and had seven faculty positions for professors. From 1637 the school had the power to award doctor of philosophy diplomas. In 1648, a department of theology was added. The Academy was the third institution of higher education to be founded in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (and the first private one), after the Kraków Academy (1364) and Vilnius University (1578) Zamoyski&#x27;s immense wealth allowed him to be the first magnate in the Commonwealth to personally sponsor such an institution (Poznań&#x27;s Lubrański Academy (1519) was a high school with a high level of education, hence it was called customary &quot;academy&quot;).

The Academy was an institution midway between a secondary school and an institution of higher learning. It bestowed doctorates of philosophy and law. It was known for the high quality of education that it provided, which however did not extend beyond the ideals of &quot;nobles&#x27; liberty.&quot;

The faculty included a number of outstanding Poles such as Szymon Szymonowic, Adam Burski (Bursius), Tomasz Drezner, Jan Niedźwiecki-Ursinus, Szymon (Simon) Birkowsk and Stanisław Staszic, as well as foreigners such as the English lawyer William Bruce, the Italian theologian Dominic Convalis and the Belgian mathematician Adriaan van Roomen. The Academy&#x27;s chancellor was the incumbent Bishop of Chełm.

The students were recruited mainly from the southeastern lands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and from adjacent countries.

Following an initial period of successful development, which at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries made the Academy one of the leading educational institutions in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, from the mid-17th century the Academy went into decline. The number of students rose from 70 in 1595 to 1635 to around 120 in the years 1635 to 1646.

Its lost its lay character ten years after Zamoyski&#x27;s death, when in 1615 it was taken over by the bishop of Chełm; the struggle over the control of the school between the bishops and lay officials of the Zamoyski family would continue for many years. It became increasingly difficult for the school to attract renown faculty. The academy was damaged in a fire of 1627, and from the Swedish invasion and wars of late 1640s/early 1650s. Several attempts at reform were undertaken in the following decades, none met with much success. Gradual improvement was interrupted in 1784, after the academy was shut down by the Austrian government (which had taken over that part of Poland in the late-18th-century partitions of Poland); it was closed and converted into a secondary school (&quot;Liceum Królewskie&quot;—Royal Lyceum). In 1811–66 the Lyceum&#x27;s old Academy buildings were used as barracks for troops of the Zamość Fortress.

The present-day &quot;I Liceum Ogólnokształcące im. Hetmana Jana Zamoyskiego w Zamościu&quot; (Heman Jan Zamoyski General Lyceum in Zamość) traces its history to the Academy and is housed in the original building complex. It is one of several secondary schools in the city.

<text>The Shrine of Remembrance (commonly referred to as The Shrine) is a war memorial in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, located in Kings Domain on St Kilda Road. It was built to honour the men and women of Victoria who served in World War I, but now functions as a memorial to all Australians who have served in any war. It is a site of annual observances for Anzac Day (25 April) and Remembrance Day (11 November), and is one of the largest war memorials in Australia.

Designed by architects Phillip Hudson and James Wardrop, both World War I veterans, the Shrine is in classical style, based on the Tomb of Mausolus at Halicarnassus and the Parthenon in Athens, Greece. The crowning element at the top of the ziggurat roof references the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates.
Built from Tynong granite, the Shrine originally consisted only of the central sanctuary surrounded by the ambulatory. The sanctuary contains the marble Stone of Remembrance, upon which is engraved the words &quot;Greater love hath no man&quot; (); once per year, on 11 November at 11 a.m. (Remembrance Day), a ray of sunlight shines through an aperture in the roof to light up the word &quot;Love&quot; in the inscription. Beneath the sanctuary lies the crypt, which contains a bronze statue of a soldier father and son, and panels listing every unit of the Australian Imperial Force.

The Shrine went through a prolonged process of development, which began in 1918 with an initial proposal to build a Victorian memorial. Two committees were formed, the second of which ran a competition for the memorial&#x27;s design. The winner was announced in 1922. However, opposition to the proposal, led by Keith Murdoch and the &quot;Herald Sun&quot;, forced the governments of the day to rethink the design. A number of alternatives were proposed, the most significant of which was the Anzac Square and cenotaph proposal of 1926. In response, General Sir John Monash used the 1927 Anzac Day march to garner support for the Shrine, and finally won the support of the Victorian government later that year. The foundation stone was laid on 11 November 1927, and the Shrine was officially dedicated on 11 November 1934.

==History==
===Conception: 1918–1922===
A war memorial in Melbourne was proposed as soon as the war ended in November 1918. In the early 1920s the Victorian state government appointed the War Memorials Advisory Committee, chaired by Sir Baldwin Spencer, which recommended an &quot;arch of victory&quot; over St Kilda Road, the major boulevard leading out of the city of Melbourne to the south. In August 1921 an executive committee was formed, with the former commander of the Australian forces in the war, General Sir John Monash, as its driving force. The committee soon abandoned the idea of an arch and proposed a large monumental memorial to the east of St Kilda Road, a position which would make it clearly visible from the centre of the city. A competition was launched in March 1922 to find a design for the new memorial, open both to British subjects residing in Australia and any Australian citizens who were residing overseas. A total of 83 entries were submitted, and in December 1923 the design offered by two Melbourne architects (and war veterans), Phillip Hudson and James Wardrop, was announced as the winner.

===Opposition and response: 1922–1927===
The winning design had a number of supporters, including publications such as &quot;The Age&quot; and George Taylor&#x27;s Sydney based trade journal, &quot;Building&quot;, prominent citizens including artist Norman Lindsay and University of Sydney Dean of Architecture, Leslie Wilkinson, and the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (who had been heavily involved in the competition). Nevertheless, the design was also fiercely criticised in some quarters—especially by Keith Murdoch&#x27;s &quot;Herald&quot;, Murdoch reportedly describing the Shrine as &quot;too severe, stiff and heavy, that there is no grace or beauty about it and that it is a tomb of gloom&quot;—on the grounds of its grandiosity, its severity of design and its expense. As part of the campaign against the Shrine proposal, the &quot;Herald&quot; searched for alternative concepts, arguing that the funds could be better spent on more practical projects such as a hospital or a war widows&#x27; home. Furthermore, some Christian churches also attacked the design as pagan for having no cross or other Christian element.

The new Victorian Labor government of 1924, under George Prendergast, supported the &quot;Herald&#x27;s&quot; view, and pushed for a memorial hospital instead of the Shrine. When the Labor government was replaced with John Allan&#x27;s Country/National coalition, the plan changed once again, leaning towards the earlier suggestion of an arch of victory to be built over St Kilda Road. As a result of the debate, significant delays postponed the construction of the new memorial, so a temporary wood-and-plaster cenotaph was raised for the 1926 Anzac Day march. The success of the temporary cenotaph led the Victorian government to abandon the earlier project in 1926, and propose instead to build a permanent cenotaph in a large &quot;ANZAC Square&quot; at the top of Bourke St in front of Parliament House. While this would have involved demolishing the Windsor Hotel, one of Melbourne&#x27;s favourite hotels, the new plan won the support of the &quot;Herald&quot;, the Returned Soldiers League (RSL) and the Melbourne City Council.

Nevertheless, both Monash and Legacy still supported the Shrine. After a vote in favour of the Shrine by their executive council, Legacy started a public relations campaign, gaining the support of much of the media—although the council, state government and the &quot;Herald&quot; continued to oppose. In 1927, with the then Duke of York, Prince Albert, visiting the country, Monash spoke on the eve of Anzac Day at the RSL dinner, arguing for the Shrine. The audience had been seeded with supporters, who provided a standing ovation at the conclusion of his speech, which helped to produce a groundswell of support. When a vote was called for, the majority voted in favour of the Shrine proposal. The next day, with Monash leading 30,000 veterans in the 1927 ANZAC Day march, and with the new support of the RSL, &quot;The Age&quot; and &quot;The Argus&quot;, the Shrine proposal had gained &quot;new momentum&quot;. Faced with such support, and with Monash&#x27;s arguments that the Anzac Square would be prohibitively expensive, Edmond Hogan&#x27;s new Labor government decided in favour of the Shrine.

Another early point of contention (although not explicitly related to the nature of the memorial) concerned the possibility of incorporating a &quot;Tomb of the Unknown Soldier&quot; into the memorial—an approach that was championed by the St Kilda RSL, who revealed plans to bury a soldier from either Gallipoli or France on ANZAC Day, 25 April 1922. This proposal received considerable debate, and was countered by the argument that the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey represented all of the dead of the British Empire. Monash was on the side of those against such a burial, as while he could see a place for an Unknown Soldier in a national memorial, he did not feel that it would be suitable at the Victorian Shrine. The Stone of Remembrance was later placed in the position where an Unknown Soldier might have been laid. An Australian Unknown Soldier was eventually interred at the Australian War Memorial by Prime Minister Paul Keating on 11 November 1993.

===Construction and dedication: 1927–1934===

The foundation stone was laid on 11 November 1927, by the Governor of Victoria, Lord Somers. Although both the Victorian and Commonwealth governments made contributions, most of the cost of the Shrine (£160,000 out of a total of £250,000; equating to about £  out of £  in 2025) was raised in less than six months by public contributions, with Monash as chief fundraiser.

Monash, who was also an engineer, took personal charge of the construction, which began in 1928 and was handled by the contractors Vaughan &amp; Lodge. Monash died in 1931, before the Shrine was finished, but the Shrine was the cause &quot;closest to his heart&quot; in his later years.

Work was finally completed in September 1934, and the Shrine was formally dedicated on 11 November 1934 by the Duke of Gloucester, witnessed by a crowd of over 300,000 people—a &quot;massive turnout&quot; given that Melbourne&#x27;s population at the time was approximately 1 million, and, according to Carl Bridge, the &quot;largest crowd ever to assemble in Australia to that date&quot;. During World War II, the Shrine housed an air raid shelter and zig-zag trenches were dug on the grounds to protect civilians from bomb blasts.

===Post World War II: 1945–1985===
After World War II it was felt necessary to add to the Shrine an element commemorating the Australian war dead of the second great conflict. Once again a competition was run, with A. S. Fall and E. E. Milston as the joint winners. Milston&#x27;s design was eventually chosen as the one to go ahead, and the result was the World War II Forecourt, a wide expanse of stone in front of the Shrine&#x27;s north face; the Eternal Flame, a permanent gas flame set just to the west of the north face; and the World War II Memorial, a cenotaph a little further west. The Forecourt replaced a reflecting pool that had previously stood in front of the Shrine. These enlargements were dedicated by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 February 1954. Australia&#x27;s involvements in later wars, such as the Korean War, the Borneo campaign (1945), the Malayan Emergency, the Indonesian Confrontation in North Borneo and Sarawak, the Vietnam War and the Gulf War, are commemorated by inscriptions.

In 1951 the body of Field Marshal Sir Thomas Blamey, Australia&#x27;s military commander during World War II, was held at the Shrine for three days for public viewing followed by a State funeral on site. 20,000 people visited the Shrine as he lay in state.

During the Vietnam War the Shrine became a centre of conflict when anti-war demonstrators protested during ANZAC Day services against Australia&#x27;s involvement in the war. In 1971 the Shrine was defaced when the word was painted in large white letters on the pillars of the north portico.

In 1985 the Remembrance Garden was added beneath the western face of the Shrine to honour those who served during post-World War II conflicts.

===Redevelopment: 2002–present===

====Visitor Centre and Garden Courtyard====
Restoration work on the terraces surrounding the Shrine during the 1990s raised once again the possibility of taking advantage of the space under the Shrine: as the Shrine had been built on a hollow artificial hill, the undercroft (although at the time filled with rubble from the construction) provided a large space for development. At a planned cost of $5.5 million, the new development was intended to provide a visitor centre, administration facilities and an improved access to the Shrine&#x27;s crypt, as many of the remaining veterans and their families found the stairs at the traditional ceremonial entrance difficult to climb. In redeveloping the site, special consideration was given to the positioning of the new entrance. The original plan was to use a tunnel from the east, but this was discarded as it had &quot;no sense of ceremony&quot;. Instead it was decided to develop two new courtyards, and place the new gallery under the northern steps.

Construction commenced in 2002, with the design by Melbourne architects Ashton Raggatt McDougall, and the new areas were opened in August 2003. At the 2004 Victorian Architecture Awards the completed project was presented the Victorian Architecture Medal (highest award), the Melbourne Prize and the John George Knight Award for heritage architecture. Later in 2004 the project was also presented the Walter Burley Griffin Award for Urban Design by the Australian Institute of Architects at their annual national awards.

After construction was complete, there were still calls to further develop the site, and especially to provide facilities for education about the wars. A $62 million proposal was presented in 2006, incorporating a museum and an underground carpark. Designed once again by Ashton Raggatt McDougall, the proposal was opposed by local residents and some council members, and ran into significant funding problems when the Federal Government decided not to provide funding.

====Galleries of Remembrance====
In 2012 the Victorian Government announced that $22.5 million would be allocated to redevelop the Shrine&#x27;s undercroft and extend it to the south. The same architects used on the 2003 visitors centre, Ashton Raggatt Macdougall, were engaged to design the new extension. The new exhibition space, known as the &#x27;Galleries of Remembrance&#x27;, was opened on Remembrance Day in 2014. A lifeboat from the ship SS &quot;Devanha&quot;, deployed during the landing at Anzac Cove at the start of the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915, is a centrepiece of the new development.

The architecture of the Galleries project was highly awarded at the Victorian Architecture Awards in 2015, winning the Victorian Architecture Medal (highest award), the William Wardell Award for Public Architecture, the Melbourne Prize, John George Knight Award for heritage architecture and the Urban Design Architecture Award. Later in 2015 the project was also awarded the Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture by the Australian Institute of Architects at the national architecture awards.

==== 2021 demonstration ====
On 22 September 2021, during the sixth lockdown associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 1,000 demonstrators amassed at the Shrine of Remembrance as a place to gather and peacefully protest against mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations. The use of the war memorial for their protest was condemned, as was their behaviour at the event. In a statement, RSL Victoria said: &quot;Under no circumstances, ever, should the Shrine be a place of protest. If any individuals or groups choose to express their political views, positions or ideological theories in the grounds of the Shrine at any time, they are completely disrespecting the sanctity of this time-honoured space.&quot; Demonstrators were eventually removed by Victoria Police officers who employed non-lethal rounds and tear gas.

==Architecture and features==
Materials for building the Shrine were sourced from within Australia: the chosen building stone was granodiorite quarried from Tynong; the internal walls use sandstone from Redesdale; and the black marble columns used stone from Buchan. This raised some concerns when redeveloping the Shrine, as the Tynong quarry was no longer in use, and it proved to be prohibitively expensive to reopen the site. Fortunately another quarry in the area was available and was able to provide the necessary stone.

===Exterior===
The design of the Shrine is based on the ancient Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, and the Parthenon in Athens. It is a structure of square plan roofed by a stepped pyramid and entered on the north and south through classical porticos, each of eight fluted Doric columns supporting a pediment containing sculpture in high relief. The porticos are approached by wide flights of steps which rise in stages to the podium on which the Shrine sits. The east and west facing fronts are marked at the corners by four groups of statuary by Paul Raphael Montford, representing Peace, Justice, Patriotism and Sacrifice. The Art Deco style and motifs draw on Greek and Assyrian sculpture. The symbolism is Neo-Classical.

Around the outer stone balustrade that marks the Shrine&#x27;s external boundary are the 16 stone &quot;battle honours&quot; discs. These represent the battle honours granted by King George V and commemorate Australia&#x27;s contributions to the following battles: Landing at Anzac (Gallipoli), Sari Bair, Rumani, Gaza-Beersheba, the North Sea, the Cocos Islands, Megiddo, Damascus, Villers-Bretonneux, Amiens, Mont St Quentin, the Hindenburg Line, Ypres, Messines, Pozieres and Bullecourt.

===Interior===
Inside the Shrine is the Sanctuary, a high vaulted space entered by four tall portals of Classical design. A simple entablature is carried on sixteen tall fluted Ionic columns and supports a frieze with twelve relief panels sculptured by Lyndon Dadswell, depicting the armed services at work and in action during World War I. At the centre of the Sanctuary is the Stone of Remembrance. This is a marble stone sunk below the pavement, so that visitors must bow their heads to read the inscription on it:

The inscription is part of a verse from the Bible (John 15:13) &quot;Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.&quot; The Stone is aligned with an aperture in the roof of the Sanctuary so that a ray of sunlight falls on the word on the Stone of Remembrance at exactly 11 a.m. on 11 November, marking the hour and day of the Armistice which ended World War I. Since the introduction of daylight saving in Victoria, the ray of sunlight is no longer in the right place at 11 a.m. A mirror has been installed to direct sunlight onto the Stone at 11 a.m. During the rest of the year, a light is used to simulate the effect.

Monash, with the advice of Professor T. G. Tucker and the assistance of Bernard O&#x27;Dowd and Felix Meyer, reworded Phillip Hudson&#x27;s inscription which appears on the western wall of the Shrine:

This inscription again aroused criticism, according to Taylor, &quot;for having no Christian, (or, indeed, religious), element&quot;, but was considered to fit the Australian tradition of &quot;stoic patriotism&quot;.

The inscription on the eastern wall, not written by Monash, reads:

The Sanctuary is surrounded by an ambulatory, or passage, along which are forty-two bronze caskets containing hand-written, illuminated Books of Remembrance with the names of every Victorian who enlisted for active service with the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) or Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force in World War I or died in camp prior to embarkation.

===Crypt===
Beneath the Sanctuary is the Crypt containing a bronze statue of a father and son, representing the two generations who served in the two world wars. Around the walls are panels listing every unit of the AIF, down to battalion and regiment, along with the colours of their shoulder patch. The Crypt is hung with the standards of various battalions and regiments, listing their battle honours.

===Visitor Centre===
Visitors approach the shrine through the Entrance Courtyard, with &quot;Lest We Forget&quot; inscribed on one wall and a quote from former Governor-General Sir William Deane on the other. The Garden Courtyard, on the same alignment, features the Legacy Olive Tree and a seating area. Both courtyards are finished in Tynong Granite.

The gallery of Medals has a wall displaying around 4,000 medals, each symbolically representing 100 Victorians who have served in war and peacekeeping operations, and six who have died. A feature of the gallery is the Victoria Cross awarded to Captain Robert Grieve during the Battle of Messines in 1917. The Cross was lent to the Shrine by Wesley College, Melbourne.

===World War II Forecourt===
The cenotaph is a tall pillar constructed of Harcourt granite. Inscribed on its surface are the names of the defence forces, together with the theatres of war they served in. Atop the cenotaph is a basalt sculpture of six servicemen carrying a bier with a corpse, draped by the Australian flag. The sculpture symbolises &quot;the debt of the living to the dead&quot;. The Eternal Flame is placed nearby, representing eternal life. The flame has burned continuously with few interruptions since it was first lit.

At the other side of the forecourt are three flagpoles. The usual arrangement comprises the Australian flag on the left, the Victorian flag in the middle and one of the flags of the three defence forces on the right. Other flags may be flown on special occasions, arranged according to strict protocols.

===Remembrance Garden===
The Remembrance Garden features a pool, waterfall and Harcourt granite wall bearing the names of the conflicts and peacekeeping operations in which Australia participated following World War II, such as Kuwait (Gulf War) and East Timor.

===Shrine Reserve and environs===
Although the original architects had proposed including four statues of war leaders, Monash rejected this plan. Instead there were to be no statues representing individual members of the Australian Defence Force at the shrine itself, although a number of statues were to be added in the surrounding parklands. The first of these was &quot;The Man with the Donkey&quot;, representing John Simpson Kirkpatrick, although he was not named on the statue. Officially the work is said to represent the &quot;valour and compassion of the Australian soldier&quot;. The statue, by Wallace Anderson, was installed in 1936 on the initiative of women who had funded a &quot;Mother&#x27;s Tribute&quot;. A statue of Monash was also commissioned and was designed by Leslie Bowles. Casting was due to begin in 1938, but the onset of World War II delayed work, and thus it was not installed until 1950, and, as with Simpson and his donkey, was located away from the shrine.

The Shrine is set in a large expanse of parkland officially called Kings Domain. Over the years many other war memorials have been built in this area, including the Australian-Hellenic Memorial to Australian and Greek dead in the Battles of Greece and Crete in 1941, and statues of Monash and Blamey. Most of the trees which line the approaches to the Shrine bear plaques commemorating individual Army units, naval vessels or Air Force squadrons, placed there by veterans&#x27; groups. An older memorial to Victorians killed in the Second Boer War of 1899–1902 is also located nearby on the corner of St Kilda and Domain Roads.

The Driver and Wipers Memorial, also in the Shrine reserve, commemorates the thousands of Australian lives lost during the fighting at Ypres; &quot;Wipers&quot; is the way servicemen pronounced &quot;Ypres&quot; during World War I. The bronze soldiers are the work of the British sculptor Charles Sargeant Jagger and originally stood outside the Museum and State Library of Victoria in Melbourne. They were transferred to the Shrine in 1998. The Driver is a soldier holding a horse whip and bridles, wearing breeches, a protective legging, spurs, and a steel helmet. The figure is a recasting of one of the figures from the Royal Artillery Memorial in Hyde Park, London, England. The other bronze, the &quot;Wipers&quot; figure, is a British infantry soldier standing guard with standard issue .303 rifle, bayonet fixed, a German helmet at his feet. This too is a recasting, taken from the Hoylake and West Kirby War Memorial in Merseyside, England.

On 19 July 2008, being the 92nd anniversary of the Battle of Fromelles, a replica of the 1998 sculpture by Peter Corlett in the Australian Memorial Park, Fromelles was unveiled. This depicts Sergeant Simon Fraser, 57th Battalion, (a farmer from Byaduk), rescuing a wounded compatriot from &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot; after the battle.

Near to the Shrine entrance is the Legacy Garden of Appreciation, which was established in 1978. This cross-shaped garden is outlined by hedges. Red Flanders Poppies, planted from seed originating from Villers-Bretonneux in France, flower in late spring. A sculpture by Louis Laumen, &quot;Widow and Children&quot;, was commissioned to mark the 75th anniversary of Legacy Australia in 1998. The Women&#x27;s Garden, to the north of the shrine, incorporates concrete memorial violets within a grove of jacarandas. The focus of the garden is The Ex-Servicewomen&#x27;s Memorial Cairn (1985) which was relocated from the King&#x27;s Domain in 2010.

A Lone Pine (&quot;Pinus brutia&quot;) was planted in 1933 near the north-east corner of the Shrine by Lieutenant-General Sir Stanley Savige, founder of Melbourne Legacy at a formal ceremony. It was one of four seedlings planted in Victoria from seeds of a cone brought back from Gallipoli by Sgt. Keith McDowell. The tree was removed in August 2012 having succumbed to disease caused by the fungus &quot;Diplodia pinea&quot;. A &quot;grandchild tree&quot; was planted nearby in 2006.

==Commemorative services==
Since its dedication in 1934, the Shrine has been the centre of war commemoration in Melbourne. Although Remembrance Day (11 November) is the official day for commemorating the war dead, it has gradually been eclipsed in the public estimation by Anzac Day (25 April), which unlike Remembrance Day is a specifically Australian (and New Zealand) day of commemoration and a public holiday in both nations. Anzac Day at the Shrine is observed through a number of ceremonies. The first of these is the Dawn Service, an event that attracted a record crowd of more than 35,000 in 2007. This is followed by an official wreath-laying service where officials march to the Shrine and lay wreaths in the Sanctuary. Later, the Anzac Day March approaches the Shrine via St Kilda Road and the forecourt, before being dismissed at the steps and is followed by a commemoration service held between 1 and 1:30pm.

On Remembrance Day, Victorian leaders and community members gather &quot;to remember those men and women who have died or suffered in all wars, conflicts and peace operations&quot;. A minute&#x27;s silence is observed at 11am as the Ray of Light illuminates the word LOVE on the Stone of Remembrance.

Throughout the rest of the year, ceremonies and wreath laying services are held by Victorian unit associations and battalions in the Sanctuary, around memorials in the Shrine Reserve and near remembrance trees specific to various associations.

==Management==
The Shrine is managed by the Shrine of Remembrance Trustees, ten individuals appointed by the Governor in Council, on the advice of the Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs in the Victorian Government. The Trustees are responsible for the care, management, maintenance and preservation of the Shrine and Shrine Reserve.

Traditionally, security for the Shrine has been provided by the Shrine Guard, whose members were men with a military background. All of the original twelve members of the Shrine Guard had won bravery medals during World War I. When the Shrine Guard merged with Victoria Police Protective Service, some civilians began to serve. During the hours the Shrine is open to the public or in use for any ceremony, they wear a uniform representing an Australian Light Horseman of World War I, with Victoria Police insignia.

<text>Seyyed Hassan Modarres (; , Sarabeh1 December 1937, Kashmar) was an Iranian Twelver Shi&#x27;a cleric and a notable supporter of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution. He was among the founding members, along with Abdolhossein Teymourtash, of the reformist party &quot;Hezb-e Eslaah-talab&quot;, which was formed during the fourth national Majlis of Iran. He has been called &quot;brave and incorruptible&quot; and &quot;perhaps the most fervent mullah supporter of true constitutional government.&quot;

==Biography==
The sources disagree on his birthplace. Some mention that he was born in Ardestan around 1870, 
while others mention that he was born in a village named Sarābe-Kachou () near Ardestan in the early 1870s, and that he moved to Shahreza when he was six.

===Activities===
Having studied Islamic sciences in Isfahan and Najaf, Modarres became a religious teacher in an Isfahan&#x27;s madrasa. The name Modarres, which means &quot;teacher&quot;, is because of his job there. In 1910, he was chosen by Najaf&#x27;s cleric community and sent to Tehran to supervise the laws passed by the Majlis, to make sure they did not violate the rules of &quot;sharia&quot;. Later, in 1914, he was elected as a Majlis representative of Tehran.
In 1916, during World War I, he migrated to Iraq, Syria, and Turkey together with a handful of other politicians, and served as the Minister of Justice in a cabinet formed in exile by Nezam os-Saltaneh. After returning to Iran, he was elected in the Majlis elections a few more times. Modarres fought against the presence of British forces in Persia, vigorously opposing the proposed 1919 agreement that would have transformed Iran into a British protectorate.

In the early 1920s he also played a role in preventing Reza Khan (the prime minister at the time) from abolishing the monarchy (the Qajar dynasty) and declaring a republic, and less successfully opposed Reza Khan&#x27;s deposing of the Qajar dynasty in 1925. Sayyed Modaress was openly critical of Reza Shah&#x27;s rule and was placed under imprisonment in retaliation for his criticisms. A few years after a November 1926 assassination attempt against him, Modarres was expelled to Khaf and later to Kashmar.

Ruhollah Khomeini, who later became the Supreme Leader of Iran after the Iranian Revolution, was affected by him.

==Death==
He was killed in prison in December 1937. His death is regarded as martyrdom and the martyrdom day (10th of Azar) is known in Iran as Majlis day (day of the parliament). According to Tasnim he was poisoned in prison and then suffocated while praying.
=== Tomb of Hassan Modarres ===

The Tomb of Sayyid Hassan Modarres is the burial site of Sayyid Hassan Modares, former prime minister of Iran. It was built in 1937 in Kashmar, Iran, as opposed to using the former tomb of Kashmar in the vast gardens of Kashmar. The tomb building consists of a central dome, four dock and a dome made of turquoise, in the style of Islamic architecture and the Safavid dynasty.

== Hassan Modarres Museum ==

The Hassan Modarres Museum is a Museum belongs to the 21st century and is located in Kashmar, Razavi Khorasan Province in Iran.

== Reception ==
Modarres is depicted on the obverse of the Iranian 100 rials banknote.

<doc id="1024526" wikidata="Q1349529" url="?curid=1024526" title="Manga cafe">
<text>A is a type of café, originating from Japan, where people can read manga. People pay for the amount of time they stay in the café. Most manga cafés also offer internet access like and vice versa, making the two terms mostly interchangeable in Japan. Additional services include video games, television, snacks/beverages, vending machines, and more. Like Japanese cafés in general, smoking is usually permitted.

The cost for the first 30 minutes typically ranges from 100 to 300 yen. Larger blocks of time are usually available at discounted rates. Some manga cafés offer overnight stays.

More recently, the concept of manga cafés has spread to Europe.

== Services ==
Services available at a cafe may include:
* Seating: reading seat, non-smoking seat, sofa, massage chair, party room, internet seat, pair seat, &quot;zashiki&quot; (tatami matted), reclining seat
* PC: disc burners, office software, color printers, photocopier, TV
* Facilities: movies/DVDs, shower room, darts, magazines, PC class, music CDs, nail salon, pool table, newspapers, CATV/CS broadcast, table tennis, slot machine, tanning bed, mahjong

== Roles of manga cafés ==

# As a complex cultural space Various changes and improvements helped transform manga cafés into cultural spaces. They became places of relaxation, conversation, and meetings. The business sells coffee, drinks, and other refreshments to act as cafes. Modern facilities and services have also been introduced to improve cleanliness and functionality of interiors.
# As a channel for the production of comic books Manga cafés were initially started as channels for producing comic books. Originally they were places that provided comics but also served as places to buy or trade this material. For Comic Cakes in South Korea, run by the Haksan Cultural Centre, the cafe is a place to read manga but it also displays and sells over 10,000 paintings and other related products. This is not only to enhance sales, but to also serve as a new distribution and market research channel for publishers.
# As a space for creating cartoon culture Manga cafés are also used as communication spaces for cartoonists and their readers. Writers sometimes visit manga cafés to communicate directly with readers, and cartoonists promote their own works. Artists&#x27; interactions with the community are enhanced, while readers can meet with and talk directly to creators in order to better understand material and increase their interest levels in the material.

== Manga cafés by country ==
=== Japan ===
Manga cafés are also known as &quot;Manga kissa&quot; (漫画喫茶, マンガ喫茶). Manga cafés are spaces where people can read manga/comics and relax. Manga cafés differ from standard coffee establishments by offering guests private individual booths and the option to stay for between 30 minutes and all night long. The first manga café was established in 1979 in a small coffee shop in Nagoya City. 

&quot;Net café refugees&quot; (netto kafe nanmin - people who substitute &#x27;manga cafés&#x27; for their domestic residences) is a recent social phenomenon brought about by changing forms of leisure, information technology, social behavior, and the long-term contraction of the Japanese domestic economy. The utility of leisure spaces in Tokyo has shifted along with changes in the work habits and professional expectations of the Japanese poor and lower middle class.

=== South Korea ===

As the number of café chains expands, some are combining traditional cafés with other content services to satisfy consumer demand. For instance, Nolsoop blends cafe offerings with a cartoon room in Korea. Beoltoon and Kongtoon have followed as well. In addition to providing comics and drinks, these shops also offer a variety of food and services. Usage fees and hours are available in 1-hour increments, and if a drink is bought with the hour, the space can be used at a cheaper price. 

An increasing number of manga cafes are appearing within movie theaters. Manga cafés are not just places to enjoy comic books and novels. They are increasingly becoming a diverse range of play spaces for eating, board games, and relaxation.

=== Other countries ===
Manga cafés have recently begun to spring up as alternatives to traditional public libraries and other spaces.

In July 2006, the first manga cafe in Europe opened in Paris, France. On October 19, 2008, in Toulouse, a library of manga and cyber cafés based on the Japanese concept opened. Finally, a similar manga and cyber café opened in late 2011 in Lyon Place Vendome. 

In 2010, a manga café and shop opened in Belgium in Braine l&#x27;Allemagne in the Brabant Wallon called &#x27;Cat&#x27;s Eye Manga Cafe.&#x27; In early 2013 Belgium&#x27;s largest coffee shop (230 m2) opened in Brussels. This is called Otaka - Manga Café.

In 2011, the first manga café in North America, O-Taku Manga Lounge, opened in Montréal, Canada, reflecting the region&#x27;s growing interest in manga and Japanese culture.

In 2012, a manga café opened in Finland, the first in Northern Europe. However, as of August 2023, it has been closed.

In 2014, Algeria&#x27;s first manga cafe, HB Manga Kissa, opened in Algiers. This was the first such establishment in Africa and the Arab world.

== Criticisms ==
Recently, there have been complaints from manga publishing/distribution companies that manga cafés undermine their revenues. Generally, royalties are not paid for reading books and, due to the nature of the business, a single manga or graphic novel can be read by as many as 100 people. Profits go directly to the proprietors of the cafe rather than the manga distributors themselves. Public libraries on the other hand avoid this criticism because they do not make profits.

Incumbent U.S. Representative Sam Coppersmith, a Democrat, decided to retire after one term in what was then the 1st district in order to run for the U.S. Senate. Salmon won the Republican primary with a plurality of 39% in a five-candidate field. During his first congressional campaign, term limits were a high-profile issue. Salmon was one of many candidates nationwide who pledged to serve only three terms in Congress. In the general election, he defeated Democratic State Senator Chuck Blanchard, 56%–39%.

;1996
He won re-election to a second term with 60% of the vote.

;1998
He won re-election to a third term with 65% of the vote.

;2000

He honored his campaign term limits pledge and did not seek re-election to a fourth term in 2000. He was then succeeded by Jeff Flake.

=== Tenure ===
During the 1994 congressional election, Salmon signed the Contract with America.

In 1999, he unsuccessfully advocated carving Ronald Reagan&#x27;s face into Mount Rushmore, stating &quot;He&#x27;s the president that ended the Cold War. You think about 40 years of a major threat, not only to our country but to the world at large, being ended by one man - that&#x27;s quite an achievement.&quot; Salmon&#x27;s idea garnered support from Reps. Roscoe G. Bartlett (R-Md.) and John R. Kasich (R-Ohio).

Salmon was instrumental in obtaining the January 29, 2000, release of U.S.-based academic researcher Song Yongyi from detention in China on spying charges.

=== Committee assignments ===
* Committee on International Relations
* Committee on Science
* Committee on Small Business
* Committee on Education and the Workforce

== Inter-congressional years (2001–2011) ==

=== 2002 gubernatorial election ===
Incumbent Republican Arizona Governor Jane Dee Hull was ineligible for re-election in 2002. In the Republican primary, Salmon defeated Secretary of State of Arizona Betsy Bayless and Arizona Treasurer Carol Springer 56–30–14%. He won every county in the state. In the general election, he faced Democratic nominee and Arizona Attorney General Janet Napolitano, Libertarian nominee Barry Hess, and former Arizona Secretary of State Richard D. Mahoney (who ran as an independent, but was previously a Democrat). Napolitano defeated Salmon 46.2–45.2%, a difference of 11,819 votes.

=== Political activism ===
After that race, he served as a lobbyist and chairman of the Arizona Republican Party. In 2007, he served as campaign manager to businessman Scott Smith&#x27;s successful campaign for mayor of Mesa. In 2008, he became president of the Competitive Telecommunications Association, a Washington, D.C.–based trade association.

== U.S. House of Representatives (2013–2017) ==
=== Elections ===

==== 2012 ====

In April 2011, Salmon announced he would seek his old congressional seat, which was now numbered as the 5th district. His conception of term limits had evolved: in 2011 he stated that they were a flawed concept unless they were applied across the board. His successor in Congress, Jeff Flake, was giving up the seat to run for the United States Senate. He was endorsed by the Club for Growth, Governor Jan Brewer, Senator John Thune, U.S. Representative David Schweikert, U.S. Representative Trent Franks, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. In the August 28 Republican primary, he defeated former state house speaker Kirk Adams 52–48%. In the general election, Salmon defeated Democrat Spencer Morgan 65–35%.

==== 2014 ====

Salmon was reelected almost as easily in 2014. However, he announced on February 25, 2016, that he was retiring for good.

=== Committee assignments ===
* Committee on International Relations / Committee on Foreign Affairs
** Chair, Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere
** Chair, Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific
* Committee on Education and the Workforce

=== Tenure ===
In March 2013, he endorsed the idea of bringing back the Hastert Rule, which is that in order to bring a bill to the floor it must have a majority of the majority party&#x27;s support.

In 2013, Salmon was one of a few dozen Republicans who attempted to defund the Affordable Care Act by allowing a government shutdown. Salmon indicated the shutdown was intentional.

He also proposed an amendment to the United States Constitution limiting House members to three terms in office and Senators to two.

;Abortion
Salmon opposes abortion and has opposed federal funding of abortions as well as family-planning assistance that includes abortions.

;Gay rights
Salmon voted to ban gay couples adopting children and opposes gay marriage. Salmon has a son who is gay. Salmon&#x27;s son led the Arizona Log Cabin Republicans; he left the group to focus on medical school.

;Budget

Salmon is a fiscal conservative and has often caused rifts and defections in his own party to oppose increasing the deficit. He has strictly opposed raising the debt limit and any new spending without matching cuts. He believes government agencies and institutions should undergo reform, not expansion, to meet their needs.

;Taxation
Salmon signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, stating he would never vote for legislation to increase taxes on Americans. He opposes new government spending unless it has a plan to initiate some spending cut that will offset the loss. He has voted to cut various taxes, such as the estate and marriage taxes.

He was a cosponsor of a bill that would prevent political bias causing any discrimination in tax treatment.

In 2011, Salmon signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any climate change legislation that would raise taxes.

== 2022 Arizona gubernatorial campaign ==

In June 2021, he declared his candidacy in the 2022 race for Arizona governor, to succeed term limited incumbent Republican Doug Ducey. He was endorsed by Ted Cruz and the Club for Growth, among others. Salmon dropped out of the race on June 28, 2022.

<text>Vito Paternoster is an Italian cellist, recording for Musicaimmagine. He has served as principal cellist for I Musici (Rome).

Paternoster is the first cellist to record the complete Bach Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Cello (orig. violin), after locating an anonymous transcription, from Bach&#x27;s time, next to Bach&#x27;s own manuscript of the violin masterpieces.

Paternoster also recorded a CD called &quot;Inzaffirio&quot;, a distillation of the preludes from Bach&#x27;s Cello Suites - following each prelude is an arrangement for soprano, solo cello, and string orchestra accompaniment.

Paternoster teaches at the Bari Conservatory (Italy).

The troupe moved to Yamato and formed the Yuzaki theater company, which would become the school of Noh theater. He grew in popularity and began making trips to Kyoto to give performances. In 1374, the shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu was in the audience of a performance and was so impressed by it that he became Kan&#x27;ami&#x27;s patron.

Kan&#x27;ami was the first playwright to incorporate the Kusemai song and dance style and Dengaku dances from rustic harvest celebrations. He trained his son Zeami Motokiyo in his style, and his son eventually succeeded him as director of the Kanze school of Noh. Kan&#x27;ami died in Suruga Province.

<doc id="1024545" wikidata="Q510881" url="?curid=1024545" title="Phyllis (TV series)">
<text>Phyllis is an American sitcom television series that aired on CBS from September 8, 1975, to March 13, 1977. Created mainly by Ed. Weinberger and Stan Daniels, it was the second spinoff of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; (the first being &quot;Rhoda&quot;). &quot;Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; producer James L. Brooks was also involved with the show as a creative consultant. The show starred Cloris Leachman as Phyllis Lindstrom, who had been Mary Richards&#x27; friend, neighbor, and landlady on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;.

In this series, Phyllis, along with her daughter Bess Lindstrom, moves from Minneapolis to San Francisco after the death of her husband, Dr. Lars Lindstrom. It was revealed that San Francisco was Phyllis and Lars&#x27;s original hometown prior to their moving to Minneapolis, and that Lars&#x27;s mother and stepfather still reside there.

==Synopsis and production==

Left penniless after the death of her husband Lars, Phyllis and her daughter Bess (Lisa Gerritsen) move in with Lars&#x27;s mother, the scatterbrained Audrey Dexter (Jane Rose) and stepfather Judge Jonathan Dexter (Henry Jones). Phyllis takes a job as an assistant in a photographic studio. The owner, Julie Erskine, was played by Barbara Colby. In the 1974-1975 season, Colby was featured on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; playing Sherry Ferris, a prostitute who Mary Richards (Moore) befriends. Her appearances on that show were so popular with viewers that when &quot;Phyllis&quot; was being cast, the producers enthusiastically signed her as a regular cast member. However, after three episodes of &quot;Phyllis&quot; had been filmed, Colby was murdered and the part was assumed by Liz Torres. Leo Heatherton (Richard Schaal, who was married to Valerie Harper, who played the title character in &quot;Rhoda&quot;) was a well-meaning but bumbling photographer at the studio.

Much of the first season&#x27;s humor stemmed from Phyllis&#x27; attempts to fit into the job market, having lived for many years as the spoiled wife of a rich dermatologist. Judith Lowry guest starred in an early episode (&quot;Leaving Home&quot;) as Jonathan&#x27;s mother, Sally Dexter. She was so well received by viewers that by the end of the first year Lowry became a regular when Mother Dexter joined the household.

Aired on Monday nights between two popular shows – &quot;Rhoda&quot; and &quot;All in the Family&quot; – &quot;Phyllis&quot; instantly became a top ten hit. Cloris Leachman won a Golden Globe Award for Best Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, and was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. The sitcom was the sixth highest-rated television series for the 1975–76 television season (at the time ranking higher than both &quot;Rhoda&quot; and &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;).

===Season two===
Toward the end of the first season, the ratings were beginning to slip. As a result, the series premise was reworked for the second season. Erskine Photography and the characters Julie Erskine (Liz Torres) and Leo Heatherton (Richard Schaal) were dropped with the explanation that Julie had married suddenly, sold the photography studio, and moved away, putting Phyllis out of a job. Leachman, Gerritsen, Jones, Rose and Lowry remained with &quot;Phyllis&quot;.

In the second-season premiere Phyllis was hired as an assistant to a San Francisco City Supervisor.

New characters were Phyllis&#x27;s boss Dan Valenti (Carmine Caridi), Leonard Marsh (John Lawlor), an inept politician in the office, and Leonard&#x27;s secretary Harriet Hastings (Garn Stephens). Harriet was initially Phyllis&#x27;s rival, but they later became friends. Both Caridi and Lawlor had appeared in two separate episodes of &quot;Phyllis&quot; the previous season - Caridi as a junk dealer in the episode &quot;Phyllis&#x27;s Garage Sale&quot; and Lawlor as a policeman in the episode &quot;Crazy Mama&quot;.

The ratings continued to drop. &quot;Rhoda&quot; was also going through a format change at the time, which may have also affected &quot;Phyllis’&quot; ratings. During this time both series&#x27; chief competition, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, flourished.

In a December 1976 episode, Jonathan&#x27;s cranky and outspoken Mother Dexter (Lowry), Phyllis&#x27; main nemesis, married Arthur Lanson (Burt Mustin); both Lowry, 86, and Mustin, 92, died within a month of the episode&#x27;s airing. (Episodes featuring Lowry continued to air through early February 1977; Mustin&#x27;s character was mentioned but not seen after the wedding episode.).

CBS moved both &quot;Rhoda&quot; and &quot;Phyllis&quot; to Sunday nights at 8:00 P.M. and 8:30 P.M., respectively. Actress Jane Rose (who played Audrey Dexter) took ill with cancer, and though she did not leave the show, her role was reduced so that she could deal with her illness. These cast changes necessitated new story lines. Bess&#x27;s role became more prominent. She found romance with Mark Valenti (Craig Wasson), the nephew of Phyllis&#x27; boss, and they later married.

By the middle of the 1976–77 season, the ratings for &quot;Rhoda&quot; had improved but &quot;Phyllis&quot; was still faltering. &quot;Rhoda&quot; was renewed for an additional season (it would ultimately be canceled in December 1978), but &quot;Phyllis&quot; was dropped by CBS in the spring of 1977, finishing in 40th place that season. The complications resulting from the deaths of several cast members during the show&#x27;s run, as well as the ill health of actress Jane Rose, are said to have been factors in the series&#x27; cancellation.

The final episode (&quot;And Baby Makes Six&quot;) had Bess announcing that she and Mark were expecting their first child. This installment aired Sunday, March 13, 1977. The same week, on Saturday, March 19, Leachman made her last appearance as Phyllis Lindstrom on the final episode of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;.

== Cast ==
* Cloris Leachman as Phyllis Lindstrom, a self-centered but well-meaning woman who moves to San Francisco, California from Minneapolis, Minnesota, after her husband, Lars, dies and leaves her and her daughter with no savings. She suddenly finds herself having to find a job after being the pampered wife of a dermatologist for decades. In season one, she works as a photographer&#x27;s assistant, and in season two, she works as a political assistant. Phyllis was previously a featured character on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; as Mary Richards&#x27; good friend and landlord. Leachman made her final appearance as Phyllis on the finale of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, a week after the spinoff series ended its run. In the episode, she visits Mary with her frenemy, Rhoda Morgenstern, in order to cheer Mary up when she gets fired from her job. 
* Henry Jones as Judge Jonathan Dexter, the calm and level-headed second husband of Audrey Dexter. Phyllis&#x27;s husband Lars was his stepson. He is both protective and judgmental of his mother Sally, whose frank, provocative and sometimes shocking behavior (at least for a family that considers themselves upper class) usually leads to his chagrin.
* Jane Rose as Audrey Dexter, the ditzy and ever-cheerful wife of Jonathan. She had a son named Lars Lindstrom with her first husband. After Lars&#x27; death in 1975, her penniless, widowed daughter-in-law and granddaughter move from Minnesota to live with them in California. Rose became ill with cancer toward the end of the show&#x27;s run, reducing her screen time and leading the show to depend more on characters like Bess and Mark to provide plots for later episodes.
* Lisa Gerritsen as Bess Lindstrom, Phyllis&#x27;s highly intelligent and mature daughter. Bess is a 17-year-old senior in high school during season one and an 18-year-old freshman in college during season two. Upon moving to San Francisco, Bess goes through many boyfriends and heartbreaks before entering a whirlwind romance with Mark Valenti, the nephew of her mother&#x27;s boss. She quickly marries Mark and announces that she is pregnant with their child in the series finale. She and Phyllis both appeared on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; before moving to the new show.
* Judith Lowry as Sally &quot;Mother&quot; Dexter, Jonathan&#x27;s cantankerous, sharp-tongued, 86-year-old mother. While she has a soft spot for Bess, Mother Dexter acts abrasively toward Phyllis. Mother Dexter has a lascivious side, frequently demonstrating her sexual feelings for actor Charles Bronson. In season two, she shocks the rest of her family by shacking up with her boyfriend, Arthur Lanson, in his mobile home. After talking over the situation with her family and Arthur, the couple decides that they want to get married and have their wedding officiated by Jonathan in the living room of the Dexter home. Lowry appeared as Mother Dexter in five episodes after the wedding episode. She had died of a heart attack at the age of 86 in November 1976, a month before the wedding episode aired. Burt Mustin, who portrayed Arthur, died two months after Lowry.
* Barbara Colby as Julie Erskine #1 (1975), Phyllis&#x27;s first boss. Along with Burt Mustin, Colby came to &quot;Phyllis&quot; after playing a different role on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;. She had previously played a prostitute who befriended Mary Richards when they spent the night in jail together. The character of Erskine was recast with Liz Torres after Colby was killed in a drive-by shooting while walking out of an acting class.
* Liz Torres as Julie Erskine #2 (1975–1976). Torres replaced Barbara Colby after she was murdered in July 1975. The character was written out of the series after the first season.
* Richard Schaal as Leo Heatherton (1975–1976), Phyllis&#x27;s well-meaning, but bumbling coworker at the photography studio. Along with Julie, the character of Leo was written out of the series after season one ended in an attempt to rework the series and boost ratings.
* Carmine Caridi as Dan Valenti (1976–1977), Phyllis&#x27;s boss in season two when she becomes a political assistant. His nephew, Mark, eventually becomes Bess&#x27; husband.
* John Lawlor as Leonard Marsh (1976–1977), another politician who works in the same office as Dan and Phyllis. Leonard is sometimes extremely dim, but is able to good look on camera and give a quotable soundbite. He does not tend to get along with Phyllis.
* Garn Stephens as Harriet Hastings (1976–1977), Phyllis&#x27;s co-worker in season two. Like Leonard, Harriet does not have a very friendly relationship with Phyllis -- at least initially. Over time, they become more bonded.
* Burt Mustin as Arthur Lanson (1976), the devoted suitor, and later husband, of Mother Dexter. He is an elderly veteran of World War I who lives in a trailer park. He enjoys hanging out with fellow World War I veterans and exchanging stories of their time in combat. He is mentioned during the latter half of season two but disappeared from the show soon after the episode in which he and Mother Dexter marry. Mustin became ill not long after the episode&#x27;s airing, and died in January 1977, right before his 93rd birthday. He was the third cast member of the series to die in its relatively short run.
* Craig Wasson as Mark Valenti (1977), Dan&#x27;s college-aged nephew who has dreams of becoming a successful musician. He and Bess fall in love toward the end of season two and quickly get married. Bess announces she is pregnant with their child in the series finale.

==Syndication==
* During the 1990s, &quot;Phyllis&quot; was aired on Nick at Nite alongside &quot;Rhoda&quot; and &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;. Eventually, all three shows were moved to sister-network TV Land for a short while before simply disappearing altogether. Also in the early 1990s, the series was aired on HA! before it merged with The Comedy Channel and became Comedy Central.
* In January 2010, AmericanLife Network (ALN) began airing the series and is again shown alongside &quot;Rhoda&quot; in syndication. However, this time, the network stopped showing &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; when it added &quot;Rhoda&quot; and &quot;Phyllis&quot; to its lineup. The series was removed from the lineup in September 2010.

==Home media==
In July 1992, a VHS titled &quot;Phyllis—Volume 1&quot; containing the first two episodes was released by MTM Home Video; however, a second volume was never released.

<text>Johnnie Mae Young (March 12, 1923 – January 14, 2014) was an American professional wrestler, trainer and promoter. She wrestled throughout the United States and Canada and won multiple titles in the National Wrestling Alliance. Young is considered one of the pioneers in women&#x27;s wrestling as she helped to increase the popularity of the sport throughout the 1940s and during World War II. In 1954, she and Mildred Burke were among the first female competitors to tour post-war Japan.

Beginning in 1999, Young had a renewal success in her career after joining World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). Young was part of a recurring comedic duo with best friend The Fabulous Moolah in appearances on WWE televised events. Young is also remembered for taking bumps well past the age of 80 on televised programming. In 2004, she was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum as part of their &quot;Lady Wrestler&quot; category. On March 29, 2008, Young was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.

In 2017, an all-female professional wrestling tournament was introduced by WWE and was named Mae Young Classic as a tribute to her memory. Its purpose was to showcase the new female wrestlers that had signed with the company and were in development, as well as independent circuit veterans from around the world. The winner received a contract with WWE and a trophy for their achievement. After the second tournament in 2018, the tournament was discontinued.

== Early life ==
Johnnie Mae Young was born in Sand Springs, Oklahoma, on March 12, 1923. She was the youngest of eight children (one died at birth). Her mother Lilly Mae Young was a single mother (her partner left to find work and never returned) living during the Great Depression. Young&#x27;s oldest sister Inie was severely disabled by whooping cough at a very young age. Young was an amateur wrestler on her high school&#x27;s boys&#x27; wrestling team at the age of fifteen. Her brothers Fred, Eugen, Lawarence, and Everett taught her to wrestle and helped her join the team. Young also played softball with Tulsa&#x27;s national championship team.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Beginnings (1939–1950) ===
While still in high school, Young went to a professional wrestling show and challenged then-champion Mildred Burke when she visited Tulsa to wrestle Gladys Gillem. Because the promoters told her she could not wrestle the champion, she wrestled Gillem in a shoot fight, beating her within seconds. After the fight, promoter Billy Wolfe wanted Young to become a professional wrestler. She left home two years later to wrestle professionally. Young later traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina, where she met and trained with The Fabulous Moolah and also met Ed &quot;Strangler&quot; Lewis who told her &quot;I don&#x27;t like girl wrestlers, women should be in the kitchen, but after seeing you, you was born to be a wrestler.&quot;
There have been conflicting reports as to the year in which Young began her career. Young claimed her first match was August 20, 1939, while WWE said she &quot;started her professional career&quot; this year. However, Young also once said her first match was March 22, 1940. According to Dave Meltzer of &quot;The Wrestling Observer&quot;, historians have been unable to find any records that she began in 1939 and that her first match was most likely in 1941. Meltzer wrote, &quot;In reality, Young is believed to have competed in seven decades, matching the record held by Lou Thesz. ... You really couldn&#x27;t call [her] 2010 match anything resembling a pro wrestling match, even giving as much leeway as possible. While she always claimed to have started in 1939, at 16, historians researching have been unable to find any records of her wrestling prior to 1941, when she turned 18 and went on tour with Billy Wolfe&#x27;s troupe.&quot;

In 1941, Young, along with Mildred Burke, opened up Canada for female wrestling. In Canada, they worked for Stu Hart. She was wrestling in Memphis, Tennessee, on December 7, 1941, the day that Pearl Harbor was bombed by the Japanese, which led to the United States entering World War II. During the war, Young helped women take advantage of the fact that the men were fighting overseas by expanding their role in the sport.

=== Various wrestling promotions (1950–1970s) ===
She fought under the nicknames of &quot;The Queen&quot; and &quot;The Great Mae Young&quot;, but she used her real name for most of her matches. During the 1950s, she wrestled for Mildred Burke&#x27;s World Women&#x27;s Wrestling Association (WWWA). In 1954, Young and Burke were some of the first females to tour Japan after the war. In 1951, she became the National Wrestling Alliance&#x27;s (NWA) first Florida Women&#x27;s Champion. Five years later in September 1956, she participated in the battle royal to determine the new NWA World Women&#x27;s Champion after June Byers was stripped of the title, but the championship was won by Young&#x27;s friend The Fabulous Moolah. In 1968, she became the NWA&#x27;s first United States Women&#x27;s Champion. She wrestled for WWWF in two matches in 1969 and 1972. At this point it is unknown when Mae left the wrestling business and retired. In the late 70s, Mae worked in the real estate business in San Leandro California.

As an instructor, her students included Ric &quot;The Equalizer&quot; Drasin and The Fabulous Moolah.

=== Ladies International Wrestling Association (LIWA) (1993–1998) ===
In 1993, Young would come out of retirement and started wrestling again for the first time in over 20 years. She worked for Fabulous Moolah&#x27;s Ladies International Wrestling Association based in Las Vegas. On June 21, 1996, she teamed with Fabulous Moolah at LIWA Golden Girls Extravaganza event in Las Vegas where they wrestled Liz Chase and Lori Lynn to a no contest. She continued working with LIWA and even teaming with Moolah until 1998. She left the promotion and went to the WWF in 1999.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE (1994, 1999-2013)===
==== Early appearance and arrival (1994, 1999–2001) ====
Before her official recognition by WWE fans, she made a cameo appearance being shown by the camera along with The Fabulous Moolah, Freddie Blassie, Lou Albano, and Nikolai Volkoff in the crowd of the WrestleMania X event on March 20, 1994.

Young made her official debut in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) on the September 9, 1999, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, where she was introduced with The Fabulous Moolah and later was attacked by Jeff Jarrett being put into the figure-four leglock. After this appearance, both Mae and Moolah began appearing regularly on WWF televised shows. Mae made her WWF in-ring debut on the September 27 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;; along with Moolah, she competed in a handicapped evening gown match against WWF Women&#x27;s Champion Ivory, who stripped Mae from her gown before Moolah picked up the victory. At No Mercy on October 17, Mae managed Moolah, who defeated Ivory for the championship – her last wrestling title before her death in 2007. At Survivor Series on November 14, she and Moolah competed in an eight-woman tag team match along with Debra and Tori against Ivory, Jacqueline, Terri Runnels, and Luna Vachon, with their team coming out victorious.

At the Royal Rumble event on January 23, 2000, Mae Young won the Miss Royal Rumble 2000 swimsuit contest and afterwards flashed her breasts. However, she was actually wearing a prosthesis and did not actually expose herself. At the end of 1999 and through 2000, Mae developed a storyline along with &quot;Sexual Chocolate&quot; Mark Henry where she started dating him, which included a kayfabe pregnancy and attacks by The Dudley Boyz, specifically Bubba Ray Dudley who performed powerbombs on Young through tables twice in consecutive episodes of &quot;Raw&quot; – the first being in the ring and the second, in which Young was originally reliant on a wheelchair, being off the entryway stage as what has been described as the most notorious powerbomb in WWE history. Mae was 77 years of age at the time, but expressed enthusiasm for the stunt. Her child was eventually delivered and found to be nothing more than a bloody rubber hand. On April 2, Mae accompanied The Kat at WrestleMania 2000 to her match against Terri Runnels; Kat lost the match as Mae was distracted by kissing the guest referee, Val Venis, before attacking Terri and her manager, Moolah.
On December 24, 2001, Young and Moolah appeared backstage on the Christmas Eve edition of Raw, which marked their last appearance before returning in the summer of 2002.

==== Return and sporadic appearances (2002–2007) ====
On the July 29, 2002, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Mae Young returned along with Moolah, to promote her new book: &quot;The Fabulous Moolah: First Goddess of the Squared Circle&quot; before being attacked by 3-Minute Warning on orders of general manager Eric Bischoff. On the September 15, 2003, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, she accompanied Moolah at her last wrestling singles match, in which she defeated Victoria before being attacked by Randy Orton and an infuriated Victoria. On June 15 at Bad Blood, Mae appeared during a segment along with Stone Cold Steve Austin and Eric Bischoff where she stripped herself in the ring and shared a passionate kiss with Eric Bischoff and performed a bronco buster on Bischoff before being &quot;stunned&quot; by Austin.

In 2004, Mae Young was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum as part of their Lady wrestler category class of that year. On the September 23 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Young teamed with Moolah and defeated Dawn Marie and Torrie Wilson.&lt;ref name=&quot;SmackDown!23/09/04&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

She is remembered in WWE for her comedic performances. Among her finishing and signature moves included the elbow drop and the bronco buster, in which she used to perform the famous D-Generation X crotch chop taunt. Young is also remembered for taking bumps, one of her most famous spots was being powerbombed through a table off the wrestling arena stage by Bubba Ray Dudley at the age of 77. Another famous bump of hers was when she was attacked along with The Fabulous Moolah by 3-Minute Warning, where she was scoop slammed and diving splashed by Rosey and Jamal at the age of 79.

== Legacy ==
Mae Young is a highly respected figure and one of the pioneers in wrestling industry. She is overall a three-time champion. Her career spanned nine decades, a career that spanned longer than any wrestler in the wrestling business. Young and Mildred Burke were the first women to wrestle in Canada. Her last match broke history when she was regarded as the oldest wrestler to ever have a match at the age of 87. Some of her notable trainees were WWE Hall of Famers The Fabulous Moolah and June Byers. On December 7, 1941, Mae was wrestling in Memphis, Tennessee, the day Pearl Harbor was bombed and the United States entered World War II. WWE Hall of Famer Pat Patterson said: “There&#x27;s been only one Mae Young, and there will be only one ever.” Wrestling legend Dutch Mantell describe Mae Young as the greatest woman wrestler ever.

She is often recognized by wrestling historians, journalists and colleagues as one of the toughest female wrestlers ever for her willingness to take hard bumps from the male wrestlers. Vince McMahon stated: “There will never be another Mae Young. Her longevity in sports entertainment may never be matched, and I will forever be grateful for all of her contributions to the industry.” WWE Hall of Famer The Fabulous Moolah stated: “Mae Young, she&#x27;s tough. She taught me a lot.” In 2008, WWE Hall of Famer Jim Ross said: “When it comes to who was the toughest woman, there are no debates. Johnnie Mae Young is universally considered to be the baddest of the bad when it comes to women&#x27;s wrestling.” Pro wrestling legend “Classy” Freddie Blassie said that: “Mae could kick the hell out of 67% of the men.”

In the book Sisterhood of The Squared Circle by Pat Laprade and Dan Murphy, wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer stated, &quot;There is little doubt she was among the toughest of any of the women wrestlers who were in the so-called golden age in the ’40s and early ’50s.&quot; After taking hard bumps from the Dudley Boyz, they describe Mae as: “The toughest man we had ever been in the ring with”. For her longevity, impact and contributions to the industry, she was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in 2004 and later into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2008.

== Posthumous honors ==
On January 14, 2014, the exact day of Mae&#x27;s death, WWE pay tribute to her with a posthumous video which included highlights of her career, and another, six days later, on January 20. On January 16, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling dedicated their live Genesis episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; to the memory of Young. On January 17, &quot;SmackDown&quot; was also dedicated to her memory. Two weeks later, Shine 16 dedicated to her a ten-bell salute.

On March 20, 2017, WWE honored Young during their Women&#x27;s History Month, a video was released where she was credited as the women pioneer of professional wrestling. WWE praised for her contributions to the wrestling business by Stephanie McMahon, the late Fabulous Moolah, Ivory, Beth Phoenix and Pat Patterson. On July 30, multiple superstars from the Mae Young Classic recognized and honored Mae&#x27;s legacy and life, among them Lita, Jim Ross, Lacey Evans, Mercedes Martinez, Bianca Belair, Marti Belle and Vanessa Borne.

=== Mae Young Classic ===

On April 1, 2017, WWE announced that a women&#x27;s tournament would be taking place in the summer of 2017 at a press conference during the WrestleMania 33 weekend and that there were going to be a total of 32 wrestlers competing.

The tournament was named after Young as an honor to her and it was exclusively for women from both NXT and the independent circuit, it took place on July 13 and 14, 2017, which aired on the WWE Network on August 28 (round 1) and September 4 (round 2, quarterfinals, and semifinals), and the final match aired live on September 12, also on the WWE Network. The finalists of the inaugural tournament were Shayna Baszler and Kairi Sane, with the winner being Sane on September 12.

In 2018, the tournament turned annual as it was announced a second event for the Mae Young Classic. The winner of the 2018 tournament was Toni Storm on October 28, and she was crowned at the first ever all women&#x27;s pay–per–view WWE Evolution.

<text>Phyllis (Ancient Greek: Φυλλίς, &quot;leaves, foliage&quot;) is a character in Greek mythology, daughter of a Thracian king (according to some, of Sithon; most other accounts do not give her father&#x27;s name at all, but one states he is named either Philander, Ciasus, or Thelus). She marries Demophon, King of Athens and son of Theseus, while he stops in Thrace on his journey home from the Trojan War.

== Mythology ==
Demophon, duty bound to Greece, returns home to help his father, leaving Phyllis behind. She sends him away with a casket, telling him that it contains a sacrament of Rhea and asking him to open it only if he has given up hope of returning to her. From here, the story diverges. In one version, Phyllis realizes that he will not return and commits suicide by hanging herself from a tree. Where she is buried, an almond tree grows, which blossoms when Demophon returns to her. In another version, Demophon opens the casket and, horrified by what he sees inside, rides off in such great haste that his horse stumbles and he accidentally falls on his own sword.

There is also some confusion regarding which nut tree she becomes, as hazelnuts were long called &quot;nux Phyllidos&quot;, and are still sometimes called &quot;filberts&quot; today. In English, this version goes back at least to Gower, who wrote in &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot; (ca. 1390):
This story most notably appears in the second poem of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Heroides&quot;, a book of epistolary poems from mythological women to their respective men, and it also appears in the &quot;Aitia&quot; of Callimachus.

The Nine Ways is derived from the story of Phyllis, who is said to return nine times to the shores to wait for Demophon&#x27;s return.

&quot;Phyllis&quot; (or &quot;Phillis&quot;) is commonly used as a female given name; variants of it are &quot;Phillida&quot; and &quot;Phyllida&quot;.

She is also mentioned in the song &quot;I love, alas, I love thee&quot; by Thomas Morley. In this song, she is compared to Amaryllis, who, when she dies, a flower grows from her blood that is shed on the ground. Amaryllis is deemed &quot;more lovely&quot; in the song because while Phyllis&#x27; death creates just a nut tree, Amaryllis blooms into an astounding flower that catches the attention of her love, the handsome, strong shepherd Alteo.

Jacob van Eyck (1590–1657), a Dutch nobleman and musician, who worked as a composer, carillon player, organist, and recorder virtuoso, composed several pieces for the recorder that refer to Philis, for example: &quot;Philis schooner Herderin (Philis, Fair Sheperdhess)&quot; and &quot;Philis quam Philander tegen (Philis Met Philander) that are found in recorder books. See, for example, &quot;The Sweet Pipes Recorder, Book Two,&quot; by Gerald Burakoff, Paul Clark and William E. Hettrick, Sweet Pipes, Inc.1998.

<doc id="1024555" wikidata="Q1687905" url="?curid=1024555" title="Pee Dee">
<text>The Pee Dee is a region in the northeast corner of the U.S. state of South Carolina. It lies along the lower watershed of the Pee Dee River, which was named after the Pee Dee, an Indigenous tribe historically inhabiting the region.

==History==
The region was the homeland of the Pee Dee Native Americans, a people who originally occupied the area as part of the South Appalachian Mississippian culture from about 1000 to 1400, leaving the region for unknown reasons. Today, several nonprofit organizations have been recognized by South Carolina as descendants of the historic Pee Dee, including two state-recognized tribes and one state-recognized group. However, none of these organizations are federally recognized.

==Economy==

The region&#x27;s largest county is Horry. It encompasses the Grand Strand, which includes the beaches running from the North Carolina state border to the Winyah Bay in Georgetown County in South Carolina. On the coast, the economy is dominated by tourism, and features beaches, amusement parks, shopping, fishing, and golf. The area has become a major retirement center in the United States, in part because of its low cost of living, mild weather, and numerous golf courses. Inland is a belt featuring rivers, marshes, Carolina bays, and sandy rises where forestry is predominant. There are pine plantations and bald cypress timbering. Further inland, on higher ground, but still of only slight relief, is an agricultural belt of cultivation of tobacco, cotton, soybeans and produce.

The region, especially the inland portion, remained mostly rural well into the 20th century. As late as the 1970s, it was still so rural that Florence&#x27;s second television station, WPDE-TV, obtained a Farmers Home Administration loan to build a studio and tower.

== Regional definition ==
There is no agreed definition on which of South Carolina&#x27;s counties are included in the region. The region takes its name from the Pee Dee River. The counties in the Pee Dee region are located, either entirely or partially, within the river&#x27;s watershed.

=== Always included ===
* Chesterfield County
* Darlington County
* Dillon County
* Florence County
* Marlboro County
* Marion County

=== Usually included ===
* Horry County
* Georgetown County
* Williamsburg County

=== Rarely included ===
* Clarendon County
* Lee County
* Sumter County

== Politics ==
The Pee Dee region has remained relatively constant during the first decade of the 21st century in terms of its voting history. The region&#x27;s voters have been close during the previous four presidential elections, but lean toward the Republican Party. The tilt of the region is primarily due to the numerous Republicans resident in Horry County along the Atlantic coast. 

At the congressional level, the region, including the rarely included counties, is located within three congressional districts. The Pee Dee region is mostly contained in South Carolina&#x27;s 7th congressional district. 

Williamsburg, Clarendon, parts of Sumter, and parts of Florence counties are located in the majority-minority 6th district. Lee and the remaining parts of Sumter counties are located in 5th district. The 5th and 6th districts are represented by Republican Ralph Norman and Democrat Jim Clyburn, respectively. 

The 7th district was established following the 2010 census. In the 2012 elections, incumbents Mulvaney and Clyburn won re-election. Republican Tom Rice defeated Democrat Gloria Tinubu, both of Horry County, 54.9% to 45.1%, to represent South Carolina&#x27;s new House seat.

<doc id="1024556" wikidata="Q421733" url="?curid=1024556" title="Lou Grant (TV series)">
<text>Lou Grant is an American drama television series starring Ed Asner in the title role as a newspaper editor that aired on CBS from September 20, 1977, to September 13, 1982. The third spin-off (after &quot;Rhoda&quot; and &quot;Phyllis&quot;) of the American sitcom &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, &quot;Lou Grant&quot; was created by James L. Brooks, Allan Burns, and Gene Reynolds.

&quot;Lou Grant&quot; won 13 Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Drama Series twice. Asner received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1978 and 1980. In doing so, he became the first person to win an Emmy Award for both Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for portraying the same character. &quot;Lou Grant&quot; also won two Golden Globe Awards, a Peabody Award, an Eddie Award, three awards from the Directors Guild of America, and two Humanitas Prizes.

==Summary and setting==

Lou Grant works as city editor of the fictional &quot;Los Angeles Tribune&quot; daily newspaper, a job he takes after being fired from WJM-TV in Minneapolis at the end of the sitcom &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;. (Grant mentions several times on &quot;Mary Tyler Moore&quot; that he had begun his career as a print journalist.)

Given the shift from comedy to drama in this show, Lou becomes a less eccentric character: more diplomatic, sober, and professional. The only other character from the earlier series is a single appearance by Flo Meredith, a veteran journalist (played in three episodes by Eileen Heckart) with whom Lou had a fling.

The rest of the main cast includes: general-assignment reporters Joe Rossi (Robert Walden) and Billie Newman (Linda Kelsey); managing editor Charles Hume (Mason Adams), an old friend of Lou&#x27;s who has convinced him to move from Minneapolis to Los Angeles; assistant city editor Art Donovan (Jack Bannon); photographer Dennis Price (Daryl Anderson), usually referred to as &quot;Animal&quot;; and widowed, patrician publisher Margaret Jones Pynchon (Nancy Marchand), a character loosely based on a composite of real-life newspaper executives Dorothy Chandler of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and Katharine Graham of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Recurring actors who play editors of various departments included Gordon Jump and Emilio Delgado; Peggy McCay has a recurring role as Charlie Hume&#x27;s wife Marion.

The episodes often have Grant assigning Rossi and Billie to cover news stories, with the plots revealing problems experienced by the people being covered as well as the frustrations and challenges faced by the reporters as they worked to get the story. The younger reporters are frequently seen turning to Lou for guidance and mentorship over some of the hard questions and moral dilemmas they experience as they work on their stories. The series frequently delves into serious social issues, such as nuclear proliferation, mental illness, prostitution, gay rights, domestic violence, capital punishment, child abuse, rape, and chemical pollution, in addition to demonstrating coverage of breaking news stories of all kinds. There is one character on &quot;Lou Grant&quot;, reporter Rosenthal, who is mentioned frequently but never seen. &quot;Lou Grant&quot; was cancelled after the star, Ed Asner, publicly protested U.S. interventions into the politics of Latin American countries.

The series also undertakes serious examination of ethical questions in journalism, including plagiarism, checkbook journalism, entrapment of sources, staging news photos, and conflicts of interest that journalists encounter in their work. There are also glimpses into the personal lives of the &quot;Tribune&quot; staff.

==Production==
When &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; ended its run, that series&#x27; co-creators and producers, James L. Brooks and Allan Burns, had a commitment to create a new show starring Ed Asner. They decided that it was easier to retain the popular Lou Grant character and make it a spinoff series. &quot;Mary Tyler Moore&quot; had already established that the character had a previous newspaper career. Brooks and Burns&#x27; decision to make the spinoff series a one-hour realistic drama instead of another 30-minute sitcom was influenced by the 1976 film &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, and how that movie depicted the operation of a major newspaper.

Gene Reynolds, who was producing the TV show &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; at the same time, was also brought on as a co-creator and executive producer. Reynolds, Brooks and Burns had previously worked on the series &quot;Room 222&quot;, and &quot;Lou Grant&quot; made occasional reference to &quot;Walt Whitman High School&quot;, the setting of &quot;Room 222&quot;. Gary David Goldberg was a producer for the series. The theme music &quot;Lou Grant&quot; was composed by Patrick Williams.

==Broadcast history==
&quot;Lou Grant&quot; aired on CBS from September 1977 to September 1982. A total of 114 episodes were produced. In the second half of the 1990s, in syndication, the show was carried on cable TV&#x27;s A&amp;E Network.

==Episodes==

==Awards==

&quot;Lou Grant&quot; won several critical honors during its run, including 13 Primetime Emmy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, a Peabody Award, and two Humanitas Prizes.

Asner won two Emmys for his portrayal of Grant; Marchand won an Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series&quot; four of the five years the series ran; Walden, Kelsey, and Adams all received multiple nominations for supporting Emmys.

==Cancellation==
The cancellation of &quot;Lou Grant&quot; in 1982 was controversial. Asner served two terms as president of the Screen Actors Guild, during which he voiced opposition to U.S. government policy in Central America and worked closely with Medical Aid for El Salvador. Up until his death in 2021, Asner consistently stated his position that his political views, as well as the publicity they attracted, were the root causes of the cancellation of the show. CBS denied that the cancellation had anything to do with Asner&#x27;s politics, citing a fall in ratings for the last two seasons. The show&#x27;s ratings had fallen from an average 19.6 rating over the previous three seasons to 16.6 in its final year, finishing the season 43rd among primetime network series.

==Home media==
Shout! Factory has released all five seasons on DVD in Region 1.
