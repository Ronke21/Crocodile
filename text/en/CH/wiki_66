<text>Black History Month is an annually observed commemorative month originating in the United States, where it is also known as African-American History Month. It began as a way of remembering important people and events in the history of the African diaspora, initially lasting a week before becoming a month-long observation since 1970. It is celebrated in February in the United States and Canada, where it has received official recognition from governments, and more recently has also been celebrated in Ireland and the United Kingdom where it is observed in October.

== Origin ==
=== Negro History Week (1926) ===
The precursor to Black History Month was created in 1926 in the United States, when historian Carter G. Woodson and the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (ASNLH) announced the second week of February to be &quot;Negro History Week&quot;. This week was chosen because it coincided with the birthday of Abraham Lincoln on February 12 and that of Frederick Douglass on February 14, both of which Black communities had celebrated since the late 19th century. For example, in January 1897, school teacher Mary Church Terrell persuaded the Washington, D.C. school board to set aside the afternoon of Douglass&#x27;s birthday as Douglass Day to teach about his life and work in the city&#x27;s segregated public schools. The thought process behind the week was never recorded, but scholars acknowledge two reasons for its birth: recognition and importance. In 1915, Woodson had participated in the Lincoln Jubilee, a celebration of the 50 years since emancipation from slavery held in Bronzeville, Chicago. The summer-long Jubilee, which drew thousands of attendees from across the country to see exhibitions of heritage and culture, impressed Woodson with the need to draw organized focus to the history of black people. He led the founding of the ASNLH in Chicago that fall, toward the end of the Jubilee.

Early in the event&#x27;s history, African-American newspapers lent crucial support. From the event&#x27;s initial phase, primary emphasis was placed on encouraging the coordinated teaching of the history of Black Americans in the nation&#x27;s public schools. The first Negro History Week was met with a lukewarm response, gaining the cooperation of the departments of education of the states of North Carolina, Delaware, and West Virginia as well as the city school administrations of Baltimore, New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. Despite this limited observance, Woodson regarded the event as &quot;one of the most fortunate steps ever taken by the Association&quot;, and plans for an annual repeat of the event continued.

At the time of Negro History Week&#x27;s launch, Woodson contended that the teaching of Black History was essential to ensure the physical and intellectual survival of Blacks within broader society:

In 1929, &quot;The Journal of Negro History&quot; noted that, with only two exceptions, officials with the state departments of education of &quot;every state with considerable Negro population&quot; had made the event known to that state&#x27;s teachers and distributed official literature associated with the event. Churches also played a significant role in the distribution of literature in association with Negro History Week during this initial period, with the mainstream and Black press aiding in the publicity effort.

Throughout the 1930s, Negro History Week countered the growing myth of the South&#x27;s &quot;lost cause&quot;, which argued that enslaved people had been well-treated, that the Civil War was a war of &quot;northern aggression&quot;, and that Black people had been better off under slavery. Woodson wrote, &quot;When you control a man&#x27;s thinking you do not have to worry about his actions, you do not have to tell him not to stand here or go yonder. He will find his &#x27;proper place&#x27; and will stay in it.&quot;

Negro History Week grew in popularity throughout the following decades, with mayors across the United States endorsing it as a holiday.

=== Black History Month (1970) ===
Black educators and Black United Students at Kent State University first proposed Black History Month in February 1969. The first celebration of Black History Month took place at Kent State a year later, from January 2 to February 28, 1970.

Six years later, Black History Month was being celebrated all across the country in educational institutions, centers of Black culture, and community centers, both great and small, when President Gerald Ford recognized Black History Month in 1976, during the celebration of the United States Bicentennial. He urged Americans to &quot;seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history&quot;.

== Observance by region ==

=== United States ===

In the United States, Black History Month is commemorated during the month of February. Since its inception, the Black community met the creation of Black History Month was met with enthusiastic response; it prompted the creation of Black history clubs, an increase in interest among teachers, and interest from progressive whites. Black History Month has also expanded beyond its initial acceptance in educational establishments. Carter Woodson&#x27;s organization, now known as the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH), designates a theme each year. For example, &quot;Black Health and Wellness&quot; in 2022 focused on medical scholars, health care providers, and health outcomes. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; describes Black History Month as &quot;a time when the culture and contributions of African Americans take center stage&quot; in a variety of cultural institutions, including theaters, libraries, and museums.

Black History Month has garnered attention from the U.S. business community. In 2018, Instagram created its first Black History Month program with the help of its Head of Global Music &amp; Youth Culture Communications, SHAVONE. Instagram&#x27;s Black History Month program featured a series of first-time initiatives, including a #BlackGirlMagic partnership with Spotify and the launch of the #CelebrateBlackCreatives program, which reached more than 19 million followers. In February 2020, many American corporations commemorated Black History Month, including The Coca-Cola Company, Google, Target Corporation, Macy&#x27;s, United Parcel Service and Under Armour.

On February 18, 2016, 106-year Washington, D.C., resident and school volunteer Virginia McLaurin visited the White House as part of Black History Month. When asked by President Barack Obama why she was there, McLaurin said: &quot;A Black president. A Black wife. And I&#x27;m here to celebrate Black history. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m here for.&quot;

In 2025, the Defense Intelligence Agency cancelled internal celebrations of Black History Month and other &quot;special observances&quot; due to the second Trump administration&#x27;s efforts to stop diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. However, at the start of February, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation honoring National Black History Month.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, Black History Month was first celebrated in October 1987 The year of 1987, recognized as the African Jubilee, was coincidentally the year of the 150th anniversary of Caribbean emancipation, the centenary of the birth of Marcus Garvey and the 25th anniversary of the Organization of African Unity, an institution dedicated to advancing the progress of African states. Black History Month in the UK was organised through the leadership of Ghanaian analyst Akyaaba Addai-Sebo, who had served as a coordinator of special projects for the Greater London Council (GLC) and created a collaboration to get it underway. The first Black History Month celebration in the UK was held in London on October 1, 1987, when Dr. Maulana Karenga from the US was invited to an event by the Greater London Council about Black people&#x27;s contributions to history.

Some institutions have faced criticism for supporting Black History Month with images of people from British Asian backgrounds, using the term &quot;black&quot; to refer to political blackness encompassing all people of color.

===Germany ===
In Berlin in 1990, members of the Black German community began observing Black History Month. Programs have included discussions of black Europeans, international African perspectives, the history of civil rights in the U.S., and apartheid in South Africa.

=== Canada ===
In 1995, after a motion by politician Jean Augustine, representing the riding of Etobicoke—Lakeshore in Ontario, Canada&#x27;s House of Commons officially recognized February as Black History Month () and honored Black Canadians. In 2008, Senator Donald Oliver moved to have the Senate officially recognize Black History Month, which was unanimously approved.

Black History Month was first proclaimed by the City of Toronto in 1979, and then by the Province of Ontario in 1993. Work done by the Ontario Black History Society helped lead to these proclamations.

Canada defines the festivity as an opportunity to celebrate &quot;the achievements and contributions of Black Canadians and their communities who … have done so much to make Canada a culturally diverse, compassionate, and prosperous country&quot;.

===Jamaica===

In Jamaica, Black History Month is observed during the month of February, which had been informally adopted by the mid-1990s. Special attention is given to this period as February also marks Reggae Month, which coincides with the birthdates of the &quot;King of Reggae&quot;, Robert Nesta Marley OM, and the &quot;Prince of Reggae&quot;, Dennis Brown. It has been a time to acknowledge and honour the achievements and inventions of black figures throughout history, and to reflect on liberation, past racial adversity and struggles. During this period, locals especially reflect on and pay homage to the contributions of prominent African American civil rights activists, and Jamaican activists and pioneers who have been impactful internationally and nationally— like Marcus Garvey, Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Harry Belafonte, Ferdinand Smith, John Brown Russwurm et al. Reggae&#x27;s role in global social and political activism against apartheid, oppression and inequality, has amplified the significance of Black History Month on the island. Since January 9, 2008, February has been officially declared as Reggae Month, which also celebrates the genre&#x27;s musical, cultural and economic contributions to the development of the island.

In the past, some critics questioned the rationale and relevance of commemorating an &quot;imported&quot; event to Jamaican contexts— in light of differences in demographics and experiences between the United States and Jamaica, and Jamaicans&#x27; penchant of adopting anything emanating from the United States. Others argued for greater attention to local heroes, while demonstrating solidarity with Black Americans.

=== Republic of Ireland ===
Ireland&#x27;s Great Hunger Institute, at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, notes: &quot;Black History Month Ireland was initiated in Cork in 2010. This location seems particularly appropriate as, in the 19th century, the city was a leading center of abolition, and the male and female anti-slavery societies welcomed several black abolitionists to lecture there, including Charles Lenox Remond and Frederick Douglass.&quot;

=== France ===
In France, Black History Month was first organized in 2018 in Bordeaux. Since then, there have been celebrations in Paris, Le Havre, Guadeloupe, La Rochelle and Bayonne. In 2022 the month was dedicated to Josephine Baker, a dancer and member of the French Resistance during World War II born in the United States.

=== Africa ===
In 2020, Black History Month was celebrated in seven African countries for the first time. Participating countries were Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Ivory Coast, Comores, Senegal and Cameroon. The event was initiated by the organisation Africa Mondo founded by Mélina Seymour. Starting in 2021, an African History Month was celebrated in March.

==Developments==
When first established, Black History Month resulted in some controversy. Those who believed that Black History Month was limited to educational institutions questioned whether it was appropriate to confine the celebration of Black history to one month, as opposed to the integration of Black history into mainstream education for the whole year.

Another concern was that, contrary to the original inspiration for Black History Month, which was a desire to redress how American schools failed to represent Black historical figures as anything other than enslaved people or colonial subjects, Black History Month could reduce complex historical figures to overly simplified objects of &quot;&quot;.

Other critics refer to the celebration as a form of racism. Actor and director Morgan Freeman and actress Stacey Dash have criticized the concept of declaring only one month as Black History Month. Freeman noted, &quot;I don&#x27;t want a Black history month. Black history is American history.&quot;

In February 2025, Google announced that Black History Month would no longer be highlighted by default on Google Calendar, arguing that it was no longer &quot;scalable or sustainable&quot; to continue adding the growing number of national and international &quot;cultural moments&quot; manually to its calendars.

<text>U Thant Island (officially Belmont Island) is a small artificial island or islet in New York City&#x27;s East River, within the borough of Manhattan. The island, created during the construction of the Steinway Tunnel directly underneath, is the smallest island in Manhattan. The island is named after August Belmont Jr., who financed the construction of the subway tunnel, and in 1977 was dedicated to the memory of U Thant, the former Secretary-General of the United Nations. The islet contains a lighted beacon marking the southern end of Roosevelt Island Reef and is the home to a small colony of double-crested cormorants.

==Location and jurisdiction==
The tiny artificial island is in size and located in the East River, just south of Roosevelt Island. It lies midway between the United Nations Headquarters at 42nd Street, in Manhattan to the west, and Gantry Plaza State Park in Long Island City, within Queens to the east. It is legally part of Manhattan and is formally a part of Manhattan Community District 6, which also includes the neighborhoods of Turtle Bay and Murray Hill to the west of U Thant Island. The Borough, Block and Lot is Manhattan, Block 1373 (shared with Roosevelt Island), and Lot 200.

The island is owned by the New York State Government and is currently protected as a sanctuary for migrating birds. Public access is prohibited. Since 2016, the island has been designated a Recognized Ecological Complex under the city&#x27;s Waterfront Revitalization Program.

The United States Coast Guard maintains a 57-foot (17 m) tall lighted beacon on the island, designated &quot;Roosevelt Island Reef Light 17&quot;; an earlier 23-foot (7 m) tall light had been erected in 1938, and another pair before then. Belmont Island is located near the southwest end of Roosevelt Island Reef, which extends southwestward from Roosevelt Island.

Elevations on Roosevelt Island are sometimes measured in reference to the &quot;Belmont Island Datum&quot;, which is below the mean sea level at Sandy Hook.

==History==
===1890s to 1910s===
In the 1890s, businessman William Steinway began a project to construct a tunnel for trolleys under the East River to link Manhattan to his eponymous company town, Steinway Village, in Astoria, Queens; the tunnel would be named the Steinway Tunnel after him. Work on the project was halted in 1892 after a dynamite blast near a shaft in Long Island City killed five workers. Steinway died before his tunnels&#x27; completion, and financier August Belmont Jr. saw the project to completion between 1905 and 1907. The tunnels, which pass directly beneath the island, are now part of the New York City Subway system and used by the IRT Flushing Line (). A shaft dug into the rock outcrop known as Man-o&#x27;-War Reef during construction of the tunnel produced excess landfill that built up the reef and created a small island. Belmont Island, named after the financier, became the legal name of the island.

From 1899 to 1903, the portion of the rock ledge that extended southwestward from Blackwell&#x27;s Island known as Man-o&#x27;-War Rock had been blasted to a depth of for the federal government; the southern end of this reef was located across from East 37th Street in Manhattan. Two other groups of rocks were located between Man-o&#x27;-War Rock and Blackwell&#x27;s Island. According to William Barclay Parsons, who worked on the Steinway Tunnel as a consulting engineer, and Colonel H. Taylor of the Corps of Engineers, the location of the shaft was incorrectly referred to as &quot;Man-of-War-Reef&quot; and the rock outcrop was instead located near the southern end of &quot;Blackwell&#x27;s Island Reef.&quot; Parsons noted that the site of the shaft was commonly called Man-of-War Reef even though that reef had been removed by the federal government. The rock outcrop the shaft was located on, along with Blackwell&#x27;s Island, were both composed of Fordham gneiss.

Permission to construct two shafts on Man-o&#x27;-War Reef and create a temporary island to support the staging of equipment was obtained from Robert Shaw Oliver of the War Department on June 28, 1905. The permit was effective for a two-year period beginning on July 1, 1905 and allowed a temporary island up to wide by long to be created. At the conclusion of the work, the equipment was to be removed and the rock outcrop was to be returned to its original condition. A similar permit was obtained from the Commissioners of the Land Office of New York State on July 8, 1905. Permission to sink a shaft in the East River had originally been requested from the Corporation Counsel, which referred the matter to the Commissioner of Docks and Ferries, but no records of grants of land under water from the state to the city were found in the vicinity of the proposed shaft site, which prompted the Corporation Counsel to advise the Attorney General of New York of the matter. Authorization was also received from the Lighthouse Service to temporarily move the Blackwells Island Reef light located on Man-o&#x27;-War Rock to the top of a building that was constructed on the island.
Preparations for construction on Man-o&#x27;-War Reef began at the end of July 1905 and the shaft was sunk the following month. In addition to containing the two shafts with an air lock above them, the island included buildings containing an air receiver, pumps, electric motors, and a steam engine. Construction of the shafts in the middle of the river allowed workers to tunnel from them in both directions, adding more workfaces and helping to speed up construction. Four workers were killed on January 16, 1906 during an accident that occurred in the shaft under the island.

After the tunnel was completed in 1907, there were talks about retaining the island for the erection of a lighthouse as an aid to navigation. In 1909, Commissioner of Public Charities Robert W. Hebberd proposed connecting the southern tip of Blackwell&#x27;s Island to Man o&#x27; War Reef using landfill to create an additional of park space designed by architect Raymond F. Almirall. The proposal would have eliminated the need to use a boat to access Belmont Island.

The tracks in the tunnel were not placed into permanent operation until 1915. The tunnel was purchased by the city, which reconstructed it beginning in 1914 to accommodate subway cars; this work also included filling in the shaft on Man o&#x27; War Reef. However, no actions were taken to remove the temporary island, demolish the buildings that had been erected on it, or restore the Blackwells Island Reef light to its original condition. By 1916, the structure that the light had been placed on top of had fallen into disrepair and the War Department sent an inquiry to the Public Service Commission asking who was responsible for the building and if there was any reason why it should not be demolished so the light could be replaced. The structures on the island were demolished by a contractor in 1918.

===1920s to 1960s===
On July 7, 1926, the submarine ran aground at Man-o&#x27;-War Reef while it was being towed down the East River to the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The vessel was pulled off the reef eleven hours later by tugboats with the help of the tide. The submarine had been raised from the bottom of the ocean earlier in the week after it had sunk off Block Island and was being taken to the Brooklyn Navy Yard for salvaging.

In the late 1930s, the U.S. Waterways Experiment Station conducted a study of tidal currents in the East River to improve alignments through Hell Gate and flow conditions in the vicinity of Belmont Island, the latter of which involved a tendency of northwesterly river currents during the flood tide to direct ship traffic towards the Manhattan shore. Twenty different improvement plans were tested, some of which included the complete removal of Belmont Island. The study recommended widening the channel to the south of Belmont Island and removing part of a rock ledge located north of the island. Improvements to the East River were recommended to the United States Congress the following year as part of a $39 million improvement program between the Brooklyn Navy Yard and Throgs Neck.
In the 1950s, Buckminster Fuller proposed installing a Geoscope with its bottom suspended above the water, supported by cables hung from towers erected on the outcropping of rocks in the middle of the East River south of Welfare Island (which was renamed Roosevelt Island in the 1970s). He later presented his idea to a group of United Nations ambassadors during a luncheon held at the Hotel Pierre, but no funds were available to construct the project, which was then estimated to cost $10 million.

On the evening of February 7, 1964, the Norwegian tanker &quot;Sigdal&quot; ran aground on Belmont Island. The vessel was traveling up the East River carrying fuel oil from Aruba to the Bronx. Such a ship normally would have been accompanied by one or two tugboats but it arrived in New York Harbor during a tugboat strike and was operating on its own. Fuel was offloaded from the tanker into lighter barges so the vessel could be pulled off the rock ledge; it took three days before the ship was freed by a salvage vessel from Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott and two tugboats.

In 1968, the Hudson Institute published a proposal for connecting Welfare Island and Belmont Island by landfill to form a single larger island, as part of an economic redevelopment. 42nd Street would have extended across the island from Manhattan to Queens, connected by a Ponte Vecchio-like bridge covered in shops. &quot;Belmont Center&quot;, modeled on Rockefeller Center, would have had towers of up to 80 stories.

The Delacorte Fountain, a Jet d&#x27;Eau–like fountain sponsored by George T. Delacorte Jr. stood nearby at the southern tip of Roosevelt Island, and faced calls for its relocation to Belmont Island from the time it was dedicated in 1969 until it stopped operating in 1986 and was subsequently abandoned.

===1970s to present===

On August 25, 1972, the island was declared &quot;Soviet Jewry Freedom Island&quot; and symbolically occupied for hours by six activists led by Manhattan and Bronx Borough Presidents Percy Sutton and Robert Abrams to protest a United Nations speech by Leonid Brezhnev and the imposition of the diploma tax as a barrier to emigration from the Soviet Union. Other members of the group that landed on the island included Rabbi Gilbert Klaperman, chairman of the Greater New York Conference on Soviet Jewry, and Sister Rose Thering of Seton Hall University. The group rented a tugboat for reporters and camera crews to cover the event and carried a banner displaying the new name of the island. The event caught the attention of the Soviet delegation at the United Nations, which complained to Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim. The New York City Police Department dispatched a boat to the island, but let the group stay when they found out they had obtained a temporary deed to the island from state officials. Publicity for the event had been organized by Howard Rubenstein.

After the death of U Thant, the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, the island was adopted by a group called the Peace Meditation at the United Nations, employees at the United Nations headquarters and followers of the guru Sri Chinmoy, who served as the interfaith chaplain there. They leased the island from New York State, greened its surface, and unofficially renamed it after U Thant, who was a friend of Chinmoy. The island was dedicated to the memory of U Thant on September 16, 1977 in a ceremony attended by Daw Aye Aye Thant, the daughter of U Thant.

On October 7, 1982, Belmont Island was formally named as U Thant Island and the island, along with a &quot;oneness arch&quot; made of steel tubing, with a buried vessel preserving personal items of the island&#x27;s namesake, was dedicated by Sri Chinmoy with officials from New York State in attendance. The followers of Sri Chinmoy made visits to the island once or twice a year for maintenance, but these visits became less frequent when security around the United Nations tightened in the mid-1990s. The group later affixed a sign to the west side of the island&#x27;s navigational beacon tower that includes the name of the island, a note about its dedication, a poem written by Sri Chinmoy about U Thant, a brief biography of the former Secretary-General, and text that reads: &quot;Simplicity was U Thant&#x27;s life. Sincerity was U Thant&#x27;s mind. Purity was U Thant&#x27;s heart. His was the approach of serene and illumined dignity.&quot;

In 1999, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; staged an international competition to design a time capsule to preserve artifacts for the next millennium. An entry by Caples Jefferson Architects proposed a granite obelisk on U Thant Island that would gradually disintegrate, leaving only the time capsule by the end of the 30th century.
During the 2004 Republican National Convention, local artist and filmmaker Duke Riley, who has traveled to various abandoned islands around the New York City area, rowed a boat with a friend to the island under cover of darkness, proclaimed it a sovereign nation and hoisted a -long pennant depicting two electric eels from the island&#x27;s navigation tower. On their return voyage in daylight, they were apprehended by a United States Coast Guard boat but were not arrested. The entire incident was videotaped for a piece Riley titled &quot;Belmont Island (SMEACC)&quot;.

==Wildlife==
The island has a small colony of double-crested cormorants, the population of which more than doubled from 2000 to 2011. Cormorant nests on the island have been observed on the ground, in trees and on the metal arch, the latter of which collapsed by 2011. Great black-backed gulls and herring gulls have also been spotted nesting on the island. In the most recent nesting survey conducted by NYC Bird Alliance, a total of 38 cormorant nests were counted on the island in May 2022.

The reefs in the waters surrounding the U Thant Island make it a popular spot for boats fishing for striped bass and bluefish.

<text>Gyula János Horn (5 July 1932 – 19 June 2013) was a Hungarian politician who was the Prime Minister of Hungary from 1994 to 1998.

Horn was the last Communist Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary. He played a major role in demolishing the &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; for East Germans in 1989, contributing to the later unification of Germany. During his premiership, he launched the Bokros package, the biggest fiscal austerity programme in post-communist Hungary, in 1995.

==Early life and education==
Horn was born in Budapest in 1932 as the third child of transport worker Géza Horn who was of Jewish background and factory worker Anna Csörnyei. He was brought up in a Lutheran household. They lived in conditions of poverty at the so-called &quot;Barrack&quot; estate between Nagyicce and Sashalom. There were seven brothers in the family: filmmaker Géza (1925–1956), Károly (1930–1946), Tibor (1935), Sándor (1939), Tamás (1942) and Dénes (1944).

After the German occupation of Hungary, his father was kidnapped by the Gestapo due to communist activities in 1944 and never returned home. Gyula Horn&#x27;s niece is Szófia Havas (b. Szófia Horn, 1955), Member of Parliament between 2006 and 2010, whose father Géza, Jr. was killed under unclear circumstances during the 1956 revolution.

He first studied in a lower technicians&#x27; school in Hungary. He graduated from the Rostov-on-Don College of Economics and Finance in 1954. He finished the political academy of the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (MSZMP) in 1970. He received Candidate of Economic Sciences in 1977.

He married statistician Anna Király in February 1956 and had two children: Anna (1956) and Gyula, Jr. (1969).

==Administration and party career==

===Communist Hungary===
In 1954 Horn joined the Hungarian communist party, then called the Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party (MDP). In November 1956, he helped reorganize the MDP into the Hungarian Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (MSZMP), which under the leadership of János Kádár crushed the 1956 Hungarian revolution against Soviet occupation and communist rule.

Horn worked in the Ministry of Finance from 1954 to 1959. He got a job in the Foreign Ministry in 1959, first as an official in the independent Soviet department. In the 1960s he was a diplomat in the Hungarian embassies in Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.

In 1969 Horn became an official in the foreign affairs department of the MSZMP Central Committee. By 1983 he rose to the rank of department head. In 1985 he was appointed secretary of state (deputy minister) in the Foreign Ministry. In 1989 he stepped forward to become foreign minister in the country&#x27;s last communist government led by Miklós Németh. By this time, Horn had become a prominent member of the party&#x27;s reformist wing, which wanted to jettison the goulash Communism of Kádár in favour of Western-style democracy and a market economy.

As a minister he was in charge of foreign affairs when Hungary decided to open the western border (the &quot;Iron Curtain&quot;) to East Germans wishing to emigrate to West Germany. He is often credited with having a major part in the decision and, consequently, a role in German unification.

He and his Austrian counterpart Alois Mock posed for cameras on 27 June 1989 to cut through a barbed wire frontier fence, in a largely symbolic act of rapprochement which had been planned months before. As foreign minister he ordered the border to be opened to allow East Germans gathered in Hungary by the thousands to cross into Austria, and from there to West Germany. With this act he greatly contributed to the later unification of Germany. Within weeks tens of thousands of East Germans, who travelled to Hungary with &quot;tourist&quot; visas, headed straight for the unfortified border and walked into the West. Horn outraged his East German counterparts when he told them that international treaties on refugees took precedence over a 1969 agreement between Budapest and East Berlin limiting freedom of movement. The fall of East German communism and the process of German unification had been launched. With dizzying speed, communist governments in the region succumbed to popular uprisings and sheer fatigue. Within a few years, the Soviet Union itself had evaporated.

Horn helped lead the transformation of the MSZMP into the Hungarian Socialist Party later in 1989. As foreign minister he prepared and signed the Hungarian-Soviet troop withdrawal agreement in March 1990. Among the politicians of the transitional era, including representatives of civil opposition, he was the first in Hungary who raised and suggested the issue of possible membership in NATO and the European Union.

===After communism===
He was elected to Parliament in 1990 and retained a seat until the 2010 parliamentary election. The Socialists were roundly defeated in that election, taking only 33 seats. He served as Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs between 1990 and 1993, until his resignation. Also in 1990, he succeeded Rezső Nyers as chairman of the Socialist Party.

Between 1990 and 1995, he was a member of the Governing Board of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). He also functioned as one of the vice presidents of the Socialist International from 1996 to 2003.

Horn led the Socialists to a comprehensive victory in the 1994 parliamentary election. The MSZP leaped from a paltry 33 seats in 1990 to 209, at the time the second-most that a Hungarian party has ever won in a free election. The size of the MSZP landslide took even Horn by surprise. Although the Socialists had more than enough seats to govern alone, Horn suspected he&#x27;d have trouble getting needed reforms past his own party&#x27;s left wing. He also wanted to allay concerns both inside and outside Hungary of a former Communist party winning an absolute majority. With this in mind, he went into coalition with the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats, giving him a two-thirds majority. A few days before election day, Horn and his convoy suffered a major car accident between Emőd and Nyékládháza on the way back from a campaign closing event from Miskolc; Horn suffered a cervical fracture and was forced to wear a halo brace for months.
In 1995, Horn&#x27;s government enacted the &quot;Bokros package&quot;, a major austerity program. This was a difficult decision for a social democratic party, and Horn had to expend considerable effort to get most of his party to agree to it.

Although Horn relinquished leadership of the party after the Socialists lost the 1998 election to Viktor Orbán and Fidesz, he was for a long time considered to have considerable influence in the party, partly because of his personal popularity among elderly voters. However, after 2002 he went into semi-retirement. The Medgyessy Cabinet appointed him Special Rapporteur for the European Union. He received second place in the election list of the MSZP during the 2004 European Parliament election in Hungary, however Horn stated before the election that would not become an MEP.

Horn has received several awards for his achievements in foreign relations, among others the Charlemagne Award of the city of Aachen in 1990. He did not, however, get the Civil Division of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary in 2007, suggested by Ferenc Gyurcsány, as it was refused by Hungarian President László Sólyom, who explicitly stated Horn&#x27;s views on the 1956 revolution as the reason.

According to a survey in 2011, Viktor Orbán was found to be Hungary&#x27;s best prime minister since the transition to democracy, József Antall, the head of the first democratically elected government between 1990 and 1993, came second while Horn and Gordon Bajnai (2009–10) tied for the third place.

==Role in the 1956 Hungarian Revolution==
Although the fiscal austerity package under his rule eroded his popularity heavily, the most controversial part of his life is his role after the 1956 revolution, which started on 23 October and was crushed in the days following 4 November.

At the end of October he joined the National Guard, the armed body of the revolution consisting of soldiers, policemen, and civic freedom fighters. In December he joined the &quot;pufajkás&quot; brigades (in German &quot;Steppjackenbrigade&quot;), a communist paramilitary body set up to help the invading Soviet troops restore the communist regime, and he served there until June 1957. His alleged role is controversial in some circles because such squads were accused of involvement in torturing, harassing and even executing civilians during and after the uprising.

According to him, his elder brother was killed by the revolutionists during the uprising. However, his brother&#x27;s death certificate states that he died in a traffic accident in the countryside. His daughter was born on 30 October. &quot;The conditions were bad. The uprising released many criminals who endangered public safety. In the pufajkás squad, I defended the legal order,&quot; he told German paper &quot;Die Welt&quot; 50 years later. &quot;First, I would like to make it clear that 1956 was not a fight against communism. Even the rebels did not want to wipe it out. This is incorrectly depicted today.&quot;

Horn&#x27;s precise role in crushing the revolution is unclear as the reports of his brigade have gaps; however, in 1957 he received the award &quot;For the Worker-Peasant Power&quot;, which was only granted to those whose services earned satisfaction. After becoming prime minister, when questioned and criticized over this part of his life, he only said: &quot;I was a pufajkás. So what?&quot;

==Illness and death==
In August 2007, Horn was taken to hospital with severe disease. Reportedly he was treated at Honvéd Hospital of Budapest for a sleeping disorder, but other sources told he had a serious brain malformation. Later reported his condition worsened so much that he could not leave the hospital, and thus missed the World Political Forum which was held in Budapest, where former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev also participated.

On 9 October 2007, Hungarian daily newspaper &quot;Népszabadság&quot;&#x27;s online version reported mistakenly that Horn had died.

By 2008, Horn was no longer able to recognise his family members and friends as he suffered from an illness similar to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. There were also reports that Horn was in good physical condition despite the fact that he had lost significant weight. Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány was one of the last senior party officials, who visited him then. On 5 July 2011, Horn&#x27;s 79th birthday &quot;Népszava&quot; reported his health condition had not deteriorated but also not improved, remained stable. During this time influential MSZP leaders gave a toast to Horn on the occasion of his birthday.

On his 80th birthday on 5 July 2012, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán greeted him in a letter. He wrote, &quot;first of all we are Hungarians and we work towards prosperity of the nation based on our faith and the best of our knowledge. Therefore there are more links than divisions between us&quot;. The Hungarian Socialist Party also celebrated his round birthday.

After years of struggling with his illness, he died on 19 June 2013. He was survived by his wife and daughter, Anna, and son, Gyula Jr.

Germany&#x27;s Foreign Minister, Guido Westerwelle, said Horn&#x27;s &quot;courageous work as Hungarian foreign minister will remain unforgettable to us Germans.&quot; Reuters called Horn, whose picture taking a wire-cutter to the fence separating Hungary and Austria was iconic, the &quot;man who tore the iron curtain&quot;. Domestic recognition was hampered by his communist history, and commendations voted on by the Hungarian parliament were defeated on the occasions of his 70th and 75th birthdays.

Attila Mesterházy, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party, sent a statement to news agency Magyar Távirati Iroda (MTI) in which he wrote that &quot;Horn will be remembered as the most defining leaders of the modern Hungarian left, one of the most successful prime ministers of Hungary and had made one of the greatest impacts on Europe during its sweeping changes over two decades ago. Horn played a key role in reviving the left and the Socialist party.&quot; Former PM Gyurcsány called Horn the &quot;most contradictory&quot; and &quot;most talented&quot; of politicians, and added in his Facebook entry: &quot;a great man has passed away.&quot;

The government party Fidesz expressed condolences to Horn&#x27;s family and leadership of the Hungarian Socialist party. Politics Can Be Different&#x27;s co-chair András Schiffer told MTI that &quot;Horn was one of the most important personalities of the post-communist Hungary and is one of the few politicians whose names are likely to go down in Hungarian history.&quot; Schiffer said that &quot;he could not identify with Horn&#x27;s politics and political relations before the transition to democracy in Hungary, but it must be acknowledged that Horn had shown real humanity towards ordinary people.&quot; Gordon Bajnai, leader of the Together 2014, said that Hungary and Europe lost a &quot;true statesman&quot;. He added that Horn was a &quot;symbol of a peaceful and successful regime change, and, as prime minister, he had done much to help Hungary find an exit from the post-communist economic and social crisis.&quot; President János Áder also sent his condolences to Horn&#x27;s widow and children.

===Funeral===

Horn received a state funeral with military honors and was buried at Fiume Road National Graveyard on 8 July 2013. Thousands of people attended the funeral, many of whom laid red carnations beside the grave. European Parliament President Martin Schulz, former German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Hungarian President János Áder, former head of states László Sólyom and Pál Schmitt, Archbishop Péter Erdő and former house speaker Katalin Szili were also among the attendance, as well as representatives of the main parliamentary parties.

Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, former prime ministers Péter Boross, Péter Medgyessy, Ferenc Gyurcsány and Gordon Bajnai, as well as party chairman Attila Mesterházy paid tribute to Horn. When Orbán bowed his head, some in the crowd booed at the prime minister. Socialist lawmaker Ferenc Baja, a former minister in the Horn government, said in a Facebook entry that this was derogative to the event.

Béla Katona, who served as Speaker of the National Assembly from 2009 to 2010, said the &quot;life of Gyula Horn itself encompassed the history of the twentieth century&quot; and he shaped the &quot;fate of both Hungary and Europe as a whole.&quot; Katona told &quot;Horn as a prime minister and a statesman remained an ordinary man nevertheless. He was not perfect, he made some bad decisions, but the good decisions outnumbered the bad ones. He was a successful man and a true statesman&quot;.

<doc id="1030628" wikidata="Q16962711" url="?curid=1030628" title="The Lillywhite Sessions">
<text>The Lillywhite Sessions (tLWS) is a collection of songs recorded by Dave Matthews Band in 1999 and 2000 and produced by Steve Lillywhite. The songs, recorded by the band as a follow-up to their 1998 album &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot;, were ultimately scrapped by the band&#x27;s label. Upon being forced by the label to abandon the album-in-progress, Dave Matthews was assigned to work with producer Glen Ballard who, in association with Matthews, wrote the album &quot;Everyday&quot; in just ten days. This contrasted with the band&#x27;s prior style of writing, which included significant collaboration between the band members in the studio. The recordings later emerged on the Internet shortly after the release of &quot;Everyday,&quot; and created controversy among fans as well as the music industry, which was early in its campaign to curb illegal file downloads. &quot;The Lillywhite Sessions&quot; were never officially released, but most of the songs were later recorded for their 2002 album &quot;Busted Stuff&quot;.

==Track listing==
#&quot;Busted Stuff&quot; – 4:05
#&quot;Grey Street&quot; – 5:53
#&quot;Diggin&#x27; a Ditch&quot; – 4:24
#&quot;Sweet Up and Down&quot; – 4:43
#&quot;JTR&quot; – 5:36
#&quot;Big Eyed Fish&quot; – 5:16
#&quot;Grace Is Gone&quot; – 5:12
#&quot;Captain (Crazy)&quot; – 5:27
#&quot;Bartender&quot; –10:07
#&quot;Monkey Man&quot; – 7:21
#&quot;Kit Kat Jam&quot; – 4:00
#&quot;Raven&quot; – 6:24

Also recorded but cut from the album is the track &quot;Build You a House&quot;.

==Recording sessions==
The album was supposed to be produced in the manner of the band&#x27;s prior three (&quot;Under the Table and Dreaming,&quot; &quot;Crash,&quot; and &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot;), all of which had been produced by Steve Lillywhite. Having recorded Dave Matthews Band in studios in New York City, Woodstock, New York and Sausalito, California, Lillywhite had an established relationship with its members. For this album, the band purchased a house near their hometown of Charlottesville, Virginia and converted a portion of it into a recording studio. The band tried some new things, including Matthews playing a twelve string guitar. In early 2000, Lillywhite posted a report on the band&#x27;s website with details about the session-in-progress, saying that the band had recorded a number of new songs, including &quot;Sweet Up and Down,&quot; and had reworked a song which the Dave Matthews Band performed with Santana in 1999, &quot;John the Revelator,&quot; retitling it &quot;JTR.&quot;

During the recording of the sessions, RCA Records executive Bruce Flohr asked drummer Carter Beauford about his feelings about the songs at that point, to which he replied that he &quot;didn&#x27;t feel it&quot; and was almost certain that the other band members &quot;didn&#x27;t feel it&quot; either, implying that the recordings were not going in the direction in which the band had intended. The songs that had been recorded at that point were very dark, which Dave Matthews claimed was partly inspired by his alcohol consumption during the sessions, inspiring him to write &quot;sad bastard songs&quot; that were full of pity.

The album was scheduled for release in the second half of 2000. The band eventually decided to scrap the sessions, and perform their summer tour without a completed album to support. The band played a number of new songs that summer from those sessions, including &quot;Grey Street,&quot; &quot;Raven,&quot; &quot;Sweet Up and Down,&quot; &quot;Grace Is Gone,&quot; &quot;Bartender,&quot; &quot;Digging a Ditch&quot; and the reworked &quot;JTR.&quot;

===&quot;The Summer So Far&quot;===
Although &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; referred to &quot;The Lillywhite Sessions&quot;″ original title as &quot;The Summer So Far&quot;, the album was never intended to be titled as such. The title &quot;The Summer So Far&quot; was simply the name of the band&#x27;s most current recording of the sessions, dubbed by engineer Stephen Harris, who later produced &quot;Busted Stuff&quot;. Dave Matthews himself has claimed in several interviews that he intended to title the final album &quot;Busted Stuff&quot;, which he eventually did when the band went back in the recording studio in 2002 to re-record the album. The title &quot;Lillywhite Sessions&quot; was dubbed by fans, and the name stuck. 

===&quot;Everyday&quot;===

During the tour, Matthews was introduced to producer Glen Ballard, and discussed completing the shelved &quot;Sessions&quot;. During the time they spent together, Matthews and Ballard wrote an entire album of new songs before the rest of the band had joined them. The album, which featured electric guitar by Matthews and a minimal use of the rest of the band, was released in February 2001 as &quot;Everyday&quot;. 

==Internet leak==
In March 2001, Craig Knapp, the lead singer of Dave Matthews Band cover band &quot;Ants Marching,&quot; received a CD from a friend containing the lost Lillywhite Sessions. He then contacted producer Steve Lillywhite via e-mail inquiring what to do with the tracks, and posted his message on the message boards at Dave Matthews Band fan site &quot;DMBML.&quot;

Hello Mr. Lillywhite,

I thank you in advance for taking the time to read this E-mail. I have unintentionally placed myself in a very precarious situation.

About a week ago, I received an E-mail from a DMB fan who claimed they had some unreleased material from the new Dave Matthews Band CD. He asked if I wanted a copy, and I said yes, thinking it was going to be acoustic takes from &quot;Everyday.&quot; In any event, I received a package yesterday, and it was indeed the session that you and DMB recorded in Virginia.

I love it very much, excellent work. I am blessed to receive this gift.

My question for you is one of moral standards. I would really like to share these songs with the DMB trading community. However, I feel that if the Dave Matthews Band and Steve Lillywhite didn&#x27;t release these songs, then what gives me that right? I don&#x27;t want to disrespect the band, or yourself. I guess my question is simply this:

Am I disrespecting the Dave Matthews Band and Steve Lillywhite by making these songs available?

I would really appreciate a response when you get a chance.

Thank you so much for your time,

Craig Knapp
Knapp received an apparently faked e-mail response from Lillywhite, giving Knapp approval to release the tracks via the Internet. Since Knapp only had a 56k dial-up modem, he decided to transfer the songs to someone with a lot of bandwidth who could host them. Using Napster, Knapp then sent the tracks to a fellow member of DMBML, Drew Wiley, who released over the Internet the 96 kbit/s MP3s. Within days, the tracks were also released as 128 kbit/s MP3s, and later as lossless SHN files. The tracks made their way all over the internet via private servers and peer-to-peer programs like Napster. After the release of &quot;Everyday&quot;, which many fans complained was too &quot;pop-ish&quot;, the leak of the &quot;Sessions&quot; gave some fans what they wanted—an album recorded much like older Dave Matthews Band material.

===Demo #2 leak===
A second demo, referred to as &quot;disc two,&quot; had been admitted into existence to the communities after the initial release, and slowly, low-quality leaks of some of the disc started to circulate on Dave Matthews Band fan sites. Most of the information about this disc is from Drew Wiley. Wiley leaked one full song that has been released off this second disc, &quot;Build You a House,&quot; a very rough song recorded early in the sessions and dropped later making no appearance on the widely spread &quot;Lillywhite Sessions&quot; disc. The clips that were released are recordings that Wiley made over the phone while his source played the tracks therefore they have notoriously bad audio quality, but provide a glimpse into what the band was doing during the early part of &quot;The Lillywhite Sessions&quot;. Songs like &quot;JTR&quot; and &quot;Bartender&quot; in their earliest rawest forms can be found on this disc, as well as an intro to &quot;Grace Is Gone.&quot;

Below is a copy of the text file that accompanied the internet-circulated demo:

==Reception==
Once the album leaked, attention by fans and media escalated. Many fans were eager for an official release of the sessions. Online feedback from fans, including a website-based campaign called &quot;Release Lillywhite Recordings Campaign,&quot; received media attention from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, which gave the unmastered album better reviews than the successful &quot;Everyday&quot;. During the 2001 summer tour, the band didn&#x27;t just debut live versions of the songs from &quot;Everyday&quot;, but also began to play &quot;Big Eyed Fish,&quot; which was on the sessions but up to that point had never been performed live. The Dave Matthews Band was unexpectedly touring behind two albums, the one which they actually released, and the one which they didn&#x27;t want in the marketplace. In response to the album&#x27;s leak, Steve Lillywhite said, &quot;I cannot condone the release of these unfinished recordings, although I feel these are some of the most moving pieces of music that I&#x27;ve ever recorded with Dave Matthews Band.&quot;

In 2018 singer-songwriter Ryley Walker released a complete cover of the album, also entitled &quot;The Lillywhite Sessions&quot;.

==&quot;Busted Stuff&quot; and live performances==
In 2002 the Dave Matthews Band released &quot;Busted Stuff&quot;, a new album which contained re-recordings of many of the songs that were left collecting dust with &quot;Sessions&quot;. The new album contained 11 tracks—nine tracks re-recorded from &quot;The Lillywhite Sessions&quot;, and two new tracks (&quot;Where Are You Going&quot; and &quot;You Never Know&quot;). &quot;JTR,&quot; &quot;Sweet Up and Down,&quot; and &quot;Monkey Man,&quot; were the three tracks not re-recorded on the album.

&quot;JTR&quot; returned as part of the band&#x27;s concert rotation, having appeared on the &quot;Live at Folsom Field&quot; album and played during the 2006 summer tour. It returned again in 2010 and has since been played intermittently during the band&#x27;s tours. Its most recent performance came during the band&#x27;s 2024 summer tour. 

&quot;Sweet Up and Down&quot; was performed several times by the band on the 2000 summer tour, but vanished just a month and a half after the tour&#x27;s start. It reemerged in 2003 during the Dave Matthews &amp; Friends tour. The song also made a brief return to DMB setlists in 2007, and returned again during the 2010 summer tour. The song would make a return a decade later on February 28, 2020, at a one-off DMB show at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas.

&quot;Monkey Man&quot; was never released on an album or played live, making it the only song that is exclusively available on &quot;The Lillywhite Sessions.&quot;

==Mastered release==
In April 2006, a self-described recording engineer using the alias of &quot;Karmageddon&quot; mastered the tracks from &quot;The Lillywhite Sessions&quot; and released them on the Internet. Using the original SHN files released online, Karmageddon burned the songs to a CD-R and ran them through high-end audio mastering equipment, such as a parametric equalizer, audio converters, and a tube compressor. The songs were then balanced to distribute the music evenly through stereo channels, and eventually burned back onto a CD-R. Following the release of the mastered album, &quot;Karmageddon,&quot; claimed in an interview that the mastering process he used is &quot;basically the TRUE industry standard as to how a CD gets finalized before mass-production.&quot; Once the mastered album was released on the internet, it became the first-ever mastered copy of &quot;The Lillywhite Sessions&quot;, since the original leaked files were simply raw tracks from the mixing board and were never mastered.

<text>Péter Boross (born 27 August 1928) is a Hungarian retired politician and former member of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) who served as Prime Minister of Hungary from December 1993 to July 1994. He assumed the position upon the death of his predecessor, József Antall, and held the office until his right-wing coalition was defeated in election by the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), which was led by his successor Gyula Horn. Prior to his premiership, Boross functioned as Minister of Civilian Intelligence Services (1990) and Minister of the Interior (1990–1993). He was also a Member of Parliament from 1994 to 1998 and from 2006 to 2009.

==Early life (1928–1957)==
Boross was born in Nagybajom on 27 August 1928, as the son of György Boross (1896–1993), who participated in the First World War from 1915 to 1918. Returning home, he became a member of the Order of Vitéz and was forest engineer at the Somssich estate. His mother, Lujza Horváth (1905–1993) came from a smallholder farming family, a distant branch of the extinct noble Perneszy family in Somogy County. She was fond of Hungarian literature and theatre, especially Sándor Márai&#x27;s writings. Boross has a younger brother, László (born 1932), a teacher. The Boross children raised in their birthplace and Újvárfalva, where their wealthy step-grandmother lived. They finished six-grade elementary school in Újvárfalva. In 1938, Boross started his military secondary studies at Hunyadi Mátyás Honvéd Secondary School and Institution in Kőszeg, then attended the Zrínyi Miklós Honvéd Corps Cadet School in Pécs since 1942. As a result of the Soviet invasion during the closing period of the Second World War, the entire cadet school moved to Sopron at the end of 1944. From there, Boross was also transferred to Butzbach, Germany, however he successfully escaped and defected from the German Army. He returned to Hungary through Vienna. Boross finally took his school-leaving exam at Somssich Pál Secondary Grammar School in Kaposvár in 1947, with a year delay due to the Second World War.

He graduated as a jurist from the Faculty of Law, Eötvös Loránd University in 1951. There he was educated by professor Gyula Moór. After finishing legal education, Boross intended to become a lawyer, however the reputation and salary of the profession reduced during the Stalinist era, thus he began to work at the Metropolitan Council of Budapest. He was a lecturer at the Finance Department under the leadership of Ferenc Nezvál, who later served as Minister of Justice.

During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, he was elected as a member of the Revolutionary Committee of Budapest and of the Revolutionary Council of the Intellectuals. As a result, he was fired from the Metropolitan Council in January 1957, following the crushing of the revolution. After that Boross worked as an unskilled worker in toy manufacturing. Finally, he was arrested for his role during the revolution in July 1957. After interrogations, he was transferred to an internment camp in Kistarcsa. Following his release soon after, Boross and his family were put under police surveillance in the forthcoming years until 1959.

==Entrepreneurial career (1957–1989)==
Boross started his career in the catering industry as an inspector of stores in October 1957. However he was fired because of his past in 1956, and after that worked as a bartender in the Szikla Restaurant at Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden. Some months later he moved to the Széchenyi thermal bath&#x27;s buffet. In September 1958 he became assistant manager in a restaurant at Kőbánya (District X, Budapest). He became manager in 1961, and his financial conditions stabilized by that time. Then he also became group leader on trade in goods at the local Catering Company in 1962. In this capacity, Boross took part in the organization of tertiary training of professionals in the Hungarian hospitality sector and tourism.

Through the intercession of József Venesz, the most well-known chef in the Kádár regime, Boross was promoted to Deputy Director of the South-Pest Catering Company in 1965. During that time the company had two hundred catering units. The New Economic Mechanism, a major economic reform launched in 1968, was a &quot;comprehensive reform of the economic system&quot;, creating market relationships among firms. On 21 December 1971, Boross became Director of the South-Pest Catering Company. He retired from this workplace and became a pensioner on 1 February 1989.

==Political career (1990–2010)==

===Government positions (1990–1993)===
He had a longtime friendship with József Antall since the 1950s. After the 1990 parliamentary election, when the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) beat the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) and formed a government, Prime Minister Antall requested Boross to become Political Secretary of State in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. He was appointed to that position on 30 May 1990. Less than two months later after his appointment as Secretary of State, Boross was promoted to Minister without portfolio for Civilian Intelligence Services on 19 July 1990. In that capacity, he supervised the operations of the Office of National Security (NBH) and the Information Office (IH) internal security intelligence agencies. Among his first tasks was the removal of the communist secret service executives. The secret service under Boross did not disclose the hypothetic list of twenty-six former counterespionage officers in the III./III. section of the then Ministry of the Interior prior to 1989. According to former prime minister Miklós Németh, he handed over the list to his successor, József Antall. However Boross argued it was an unofficial document with &quot;many inaccuracies and improvisation&quot;.

After the resignation of Balázs Horváth following the flawed management of the taxi drivers&#x27; anti-government blockade, Boross was appointed Minister of the Interior on 21 December 1990. Thus Boross became the first deputy of József Antall and the second-highest-ranking member of the right-wing conservative cabinet. In a later interview, Boross said that he considered Ferenc Keresztes-Fischer, the Interior Minister during the Horthy era, who acted against both the far-right and far-left movements, as his role model. As minister, Boross reorganized the structure of law enforcement organizations and dismissed Győző Szabó, the Chief of the National Police. He appointed the relatively young Sándor Pintér as Chief of the Budapest Police and a few months later as Chief of the National Police in 1991. His ministry has also developed the municipal law; Boross was advocate of more extensive decentralization, but the majority of his party rejected his amendment proposal. When protesters hissed and booed President Árpád Göncz (SZDSZ) on 23 October 1992, Boross and the government were accused of deliberate sabotage by the opposition. He rejected the claims. According to a 2014 report, it is possible that Antall and Boross knew about a potential provocation but they did not want to prevent it.

Boross was a non-partisan politician until 17 August 1992, when he officially joined the MDF. He became a member of the party&#x27;s District II, Budapest branch. By early 1993, he was elected a member of the MDF&#x27;s national board and also became one of the vice-presidents of the party. During Antall&#x27;s severe illness, who had non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Boross performed the duties of prime minister temporarily from 6 October to 5 November 1993 and from 20 November 1993 to 12 December 1993, when Antall died. A day before his death, as a result of Boross&#x27; proposal, Antall was awarded Grand Cross of the Hungarian Order of Merit by President Árpád Göncz on 11 December 1993.

===Prime Minister (1993–1994)===

Immediately after József Antall&#x27;s death, Boross became acting prime minister of Hungary on 12 December 1993. On the following day, the Hungarian Democratic Forum&#x27;s national board and the parliamentary group jointly convened, where three candidates, Péter Boross, Iván Szabó and Lajos Für ran for the position of prime minister. In the first round, Boross received 89 votes and came first place, defeating Szabó (79 votes) and Für (62 votes). In the second round, Boross gained two-thirds support against Szabó and was nominated as the party&#x27;s designated premier. On 21 December 1993, the National Assembly elected Boross as prime minister by a vote of 201–152, with 5 abstentions. The parliamentary group leader Imre Kónya succeeded him as Minister of Interior but apart from that the personal composition of the government remained unchanged, as a result journalistic and academic works often refer to the MDF government between 1990 and 1994 as the &quot;Antall–Boross cabinet&quot;.

In January 1994, Boross met with leaders of the Central-European post-communist countries in Prague, reflecting the 1994 Brussels summit where the United States expressed its intention to enlarge the NATO intergovernmental military alliance. Before the 1994 election, Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Prime Minister of Russia visited Budapest to discuss the issue of debt settlement. Boross also asked Chernomyrdin to talk with Slobodan Milošević for the interests of the Hungarians in Serbia during the Yugoslav Wars. In February 1994, Boross visited France where he held talks with President François Mitterrand and Prime Minister Édouard Balladur. In March 1994, he visited German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn.

Gyula Horn led the Socialists to a comprehensive victory in the 1994 parliamentary election. Although the MSZP had more than enough seats to govern alone, Horn wanted to allay concerns both inside and outside Hungary of a former Communist party winning an absolute majority. With this in mind, he went into coalition with the liberal and previously strong anti-communist Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), giving him a two-thirds majority. Boross was succeeded by Gyula Horn as Prime Minister of Hungary in July 1994.

===After premiership (1994–2010)===

At the 1994 parliamentary election, the MDF was severely defeated, falling from 165 seats to 38 for third place. Boross was elected Member of Parliament from his party&#x27;s Budapest Regional List. He was appointed Chairman of the National Security Committee on 28 June 1994. He also became Vice Chairman of the Committee for Financial Support for Public Organizations on 27 December 1994, holding this position until 11 December 1995.

During the campaign for the 1996 party leadership election, Boross supported Sándor Lezsák who ran as a candidate along with the more liberal and urbanist Iván Szabó, who was more acceptable to the party elite and the former government members. At the end of 1995, Boross resigned as vice-president of the MDF because he disagreed with the policy of the party leadership chaired by Lajos Für. In March 1996, Lezsák was elected President of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, as a result Szabó and most of the governmental figures of the Antall period, including 15 MPs left the party and founded the Hungarian Democratic People&#x27;s Party (MDNP). Boross resigned as Chairman of the National Security Committee following that, but remained a member of the MDF. He worked in the Committee for Constitutional Preparatory and Committee of Economics from April 1994 until the end of the parliamentary term in June 1998. Boross lost his parliamentary seat in the 1998 parliamentary election.

Boross served as political advisor to Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, whose party the Fidesz won the 1998 election; the MDF was also involved in the government as a coalition partner. Since then Boross was long considered a supporter of Minister of Justice Ibolya Dávid, who became leader of the MDF in January 1999, replacing Sándor Lezsák. Boross did not run again for the position of party vice-president during the election of officials. His relationship with Orbán became conflictual by early 2001, even after the replacement of ministers Attila Chikán and József Hámori. Boross also criticized the Orbán cabinet&#x27;s economic policy and its biennial budget. In 2003, Boross left the MDF&#x27;s national board. He was elected President of the National Memorial and Tribute Committee in 2006, replacing Anna Jókai who had held the position since 1999.

He was elected as a Member of Parliament from his party&#x27;s Pest County Regional List during the 2006 parliamentary election. Before the election&#x27;s second round, Boross argued the left-liberal MSZP–SZDSZ governing coalition&#x27;s advantage is unbeatable, therefore he received much criticism from the right-wing intellectuals. He became a member of the National Security Committee following the election. In the upcoming years the MDF gradually shifted to the left-wing under the leadership of Ibolya Dávid. Boross was strongly opposed to the nomination of Socialist ex-minister Lajos Bokros to the head of the MDF party list during the 2009 European Parliament election. As a result, Boross resigned from his parliamentary seat on 31 January 2009. Due to his conservative party&#x27;s shift to the left, resulting in the expulsion of several prominent party members, Boross decided to break all ties with the present party leadership on 13 June 2009. He finally left the party on 25 January 2010.

==Later life (since 2010)==

On 6 June 2010, following the 2010 parliamentary election, when Fidesz won a two-thirds majority, he became a member of the board advising Prime Minister Viktor Orbán on the conceptual foundations of the new Hungarian constitution. In this capacity, Boross stated that he can envision a new constitutional government in the form of a kingdom. Furthermore, he said that it is necessary to place broader authority and more powerful political authority into the hands of the Prime Minister by way of the new constitution.

He gave a controversial interview to the weekly newspaper &quot;Heti Válasz&quot; in September 2010, when he said the government should inaugurate a so-called childlessness tax because, according to him, procreation is not just a private matter but also a matter of national interest. Several feminist groups criticized his statement and protested against Boross&#x27; remarks at the Kossuth Square.

In August 2015, reflecting on the European migrant crisis, Boross claimed the mass immigration into Hungary was an &quot;issue of race and ethnicity&quot;. He also expressed his sympathy with the erection of the Hungarian border barrier. In October 2015, he added in an interview that it is &quot;tasteless foolness&quot; to compare the current situation with the Hungarian refugees after the Revolution of 1956. Boross said the current migrants are &quot;with different physiognomy from different continents&quot;. Because of his remarks, the National Media and Infocommunications Authority (NMHH) has launched an investigation against Boross. The NMHH did not consider Boross&#x27; remarks as exclusionary thus terminated the authority procedure in the absence of infringement against the former prime minister in February 2016.

Boross delivered a speech on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the 1956 revolution. In response to the United States Department of State&#x27;s statement concerning Hungarian media freedom and the &quot;sudden closure&quot; of the left-wing daily &quot;Népszabadság&quot;, he said &quot;the 1956 revolution is a miracle of the twentieth century, and the American imperialists intend to insult our sacred day&quot;. He also referred that the last issue of &quot;Népszabadság&quot; was exhibited at the Newseum in Washington, D.C. &quot;Maybe we should exhibit too a couple of items from the list of the heinous crimes of the American imperialists&quot;, he added.

==Personal life==
Boross&#x27; father died in a household accident on 11 August 1993, aged 97. His mother, Lujza Horváth died five weeks later. On 13 September 1952, Boross married his former classmate, Ilona Papp, who worked as a judge. Their church wedding took place in the Szilágyi Dezső Square Reformed Church on 13 March 1953. She died on 31 July 2010. Their first-born child, Péter Jr. (1957–1958) died at the age of nine months in February 1958, not long after Boross&#x27; release from the prison. Following that they had two children, a daughter Ildikó (born 1958), who became a jurist, and a son Gábor (1960–2018), who worked as an agronomist, he died in February 2018.

<text>The Little Cataraqui Creek is a watercourse, much of which is a semi-urban wetland, that empties into Lake Ontario within the municipality of Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Further inland, just north of Highway 401, the creek has been dammed to form a reservoir that is part of the Little Cataraqui Creek Conservation Area.

The adjective &quot;little&quot; distinguishes the creek from the (Greater) Cataraqui River 4.5 kilometers to the east, which forms the beginning of the Rideau Canal.

Depending on the season, the creek is navigable by canoe or other very small craft.

<doc id="1030666" wikidata="Q5742317" url="?curid=1030666" title="Herne Bay, New Zealand">
<text>Herne Bay is a suburb of Auckland, New Zealand. It is located on the southwestern shore of the Waitematā Harbour to the west of the Auckland Harbour Bridge. It is known for its extensive harbour views, marine villas and Edwardian age homes. Herne Bay has been a prosperous area since the 1850s due to its outlook over the Waitemata Harbour. It ranked as the most expensive suburb in New Zealand in 2015. In 2021 it again topped rankings of the most expensive suburbs in New Zealand, with a median property value of $3.25 million.

Herne Bay is under the local governance of Auckland Council.
== History ==
The suburb is named after Herne Bay, a fashionable but respectable seaside resort in English county of Kent.

From the 1850s onwards it became apparent that Auckland&#x27;s Herne Bay was quite handy to the centre of town by a short boat trip. Herne Bay developed as an early commuter suburb and was the location of several large houses belonging to members of the professional classes. Most of these houses (termed &#x27;marine villas&#x27;) were readily accessible from the water, with their own jetties and boathouses - in some cases there was not any land route to them. Some of these early houses still exist, surrounded by later houses which were built as their large properties were subdivided around the turn of the 20th century.

Also located in this area on the shore of Ponsonby (between Argyle Street and the sea) was Kemp&#x27;s Gardens. This was a popular pleasure resort for Auckland&#x27;s people during the 1860s. The gardens were &quot;complete with pavilion, gardens and illuminations&quot;: &quot;A free hand was given, drinks were sold, music was provided and the least said the better&quot;. Later renamed &quot;Cremorne Gardens&quot; after the fashionable pleasure gardens in London, Kemp&#x27;s gardens boasted a &quot;Dancing Pavilion, ten acres of walks and sports grounds&quot;. It is remembered in the name &quot;Cremorne Street&quot;.

<doc id="1030676" wikidata="Q2706268" url="?curid=1030676" title="Untranslatability">
<text>Untranslatability is the property of text or speech for which no equivalent can be found when translated into another (given) language. A text that is considered to be untranslatable is considered a &quot;lacuna&quot;, or lexical gap. The term arises when describing the difficulty of achieving the so-called perfect translation. It is based on the notion that there are certain concepts and words that are so interrelated that an accurate translation becomes an impossible task. 

Some writers have suggested that language carries sacred notions or is intrinsic to national identity. Brian James Baer posits that untranslatability is sometimes seen by nations as proof of the national genius. He quotes Alexandra Jaffe: &quot;When translators talk about untranslatable, they often reinforce the notion that each language has its own &#x27;genius&#x27;, an &#x27;essence&#x27; that naturally sets it apart from all other languages and reflects something of the &#x27;soul&#x27; of its culture or people&quot;.

A translator, however, can resort to various translation procedures to compensate for a lexical gap. From this perspective, untranslatability does not carry deep linguistic relativity implications. Meaning can virtually always be translated, if not always with technical accuracy.

== Theories ==
There is a school of thought identified with Walter Benjamin that identifies the concept of &quot;sacred&quot; in relation to translation, and this pertains to the text that is untranslatable because its meaning and letter cannot be disassociated. It stems from the view that translation should realize the imagined perfect relationship with the original text. This theory highlights the paradoxical nature of translation wherein it—as a process—assumes the forms of necessity and impossibility at the same time. This is demonstrated in Jacques Derrida&#x27;s analysis of the myth of Babel, a word which he described as a name that means confusion and also a proper name of God. Furthermore, Derrida noted that when God condemned the world to a multiplicity of tongues, he created a paradoxical need and impossibility of translation.

Derrida himself has put forward his own notion of the untranslatability of the text, arguing in his early works such as the &quot;Writing and Difference&quot; and &quot;Margins of Philosophy&quot; that there is an excess of untranslatable meaning in literature, and it cannot be reduced to a closed system or a restricted economy &quot;in which there is nothing that cannot be made to make sense.&quot;

Brian James Baer posits that untranslatability is sometimes seen by nations as proof of their national genius. Literature that can be easily translated may be considered as lacking originality, while translated works themselves may be regarded merely as imitations. Baer quotes Jean-Jacques Rousseau defining true genius as &quot;the kind that creates and makes everything out of nothing&quot;. Paraphrasing Robert Frost&#x27;s remark about poetry (&quot;Poetry is what gets lost in translation&quot;), Baer suggests that &quot;one could define national identity as that which is lost in translation&quot;. He further quotes Alexandra Jaffe: &quot;When translators talk about untranslatable, they often reinforce the notion that each language has its own &#x27;genius&#x27;, an &#x27;essence&#x27; that naturally sets it apart from all other languages and reflects something of the &#x27;soul&#x27; of its culture or people&quot;.

Quite often, a text or utterance that is considered to be &quot;untranslatable&quot; is considered a &quot;lacuna&quot;, or lexical gap. That is, there is no one-to-one equivalence between the word, expression or turn of phrase in the source language and another word, expression or turn of phrase in the target language. A translator can, however, resort to a number of translation procedures to compensate for this. From this perspective, untranslatability or difficulty of translation does not always carry deep linguistic relativity implications; denotation can virtually always be translated, given enough circumlocution, although connotation may be ineffable or inefficient to convey.

==Examples==
===Register===
Although Thai has words that can be used as equivalent to English &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, or &quot;he/she/it&quot;, they are relatively formal terms (or markedly informal). In most cases, Thai people use words which express the relation between speaker and listener according to their respective roles. For instance, for a mother to say to her child &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you a story&quot;, she would say &quot;&quot; (), or &quot;Mother will tell child a story&quot;. Similarly, older and younger friends will often use sibling terminology, so that an older friend telling a younger friend &quot;You&#x27;re my friend&quot; would be &quot;&quot; (), would translate directly as &quot;Younger sibling is older sibling’s friend&quot;. To be translated into English correctly, it is proper to use &quot;I&quot; and &quot;you&quot; for these example statements, but normal Thai perceptions of relation are lost in the process.

A similar feature can also be observed in Indonesian. One may use the formal form of pronouns, which are generally distinct from the informal/familiar forms; however, the use of these pronouns does not evoke sufficient friendliness or intimacy, especially in spoken language. Instead of saying &quot;, a waiter/waitress will most likely say &quot; (lit. &#x27;Father/Mother wants to order what?&#x27;). The two expressions are equally polite; however, the latter is more sympathetic and friendly. When conversing with family and relatives, most Indonesians also prefer using kinship terminology (father, mother, brother, sister) when addressing older family members. When addressing younger family members, informal pronouns are more prevalent.

===Verb forms===
English lacks some grammatical categories which are present in some other languages.

There is no simple way in English to contrast Finnish or Polish (continuing, corresponding to English &#x27;to write&#x27;) with or (a regular frequentative, &#x27;to occasionally write short passages at a time&#x27;, or &#x27;to jot down now and then&#x27;). Similarly, and (to jump once) contrast with and (to continuously jump; to be jumping from point A to B).

Irish allows the prohibitive mood to be used in the passive voice. The effect is used to prohibit something while expressing society&#x27;s disapproval for that action at the same time. For example, contrast (meaning &#x27;Don&#x27;t smoke&#x27; when said to more than one person), which uses the second person plural in the imperative meaning &quot;Do not smoke&quot;, with (best translated as &#x27;Smoking just isn&#x27;t done here&#x27;), which uses the autonomous imperative meaning &#x27;One does not smoke&#x27;.

Italian has three distinct declined past tenses: thus (), (), and () all mean &#x27;I was&#x27;. The first indicates a concluded action in the (remote) past, the second a progressive or habitual action in the past, and the latter an action that holds some connection to the present, especially if a recent time is specified (&quot;&quot; for &#x27;this morning I saw&#x27;). The is often used for narrative history (for example, novels). Nowadays, the difference between and is blurred in the spoken language, the latter being used in both situations. What difference there exists is partly geographic. In the north of Italy the is very rarely used in everyday speech, whereas in the south it often takes the place of the . The distinction is only alive in Tuscany, which makes it dialectal even if hardline purists insist it should be applied consistently.

Likewise, English lacks a productive grammatical means to show indirection but must instead rely on periphrasis, that is the use of multiple words to explain an idea. Finnish grammar, on the contrary, allows the regular production of a series of verbal derivatives, each of which involves a greater degree of indirection. For example, on the basis of the verb (&#x27;to pull&#x27;), it is possible to produce:
* (pull),
* (cause something/someone to pull/to wind-up (lie)),
* (cause something/someone to cause something/someone to pull),
* (cause something/someone to cause something/someone to cause something/someone to pull).

Hindi has a similar concept of indirection. means &#x27;to do&#x27;; means &#x27;to make someone do&#x27;; means &#x27;to get someone to make yet another person do&#x27;.

Most Turkic languages (Turkish, Azeri, Kazakh) contain the grammatical verb suffix &quot;miş&quot; (or &quot;mis&quot; in other dialects), which indicates that the speaker did not witness the act personally but surmises or has discovered that the act has occurred or was told of it by another, as in the example of (Turkish), which can be expressed in English as &quot;it is reported that he/she/it has gone&quot;, or, most concisely, as &quot;apparently, he/she/it has gone&quot;. This grammatical form is especially used when telling jokes, or narrating stories.

Similar to the Turkic &quot;miş&quot;, nearly every Quechua sentence is marked by an evidential clitic, indicating the source of the speaker&#x27;s knowledge (and how certain they are about the statement). The enclitic &quot;=mi&quot; expresses personal knowledge (&quot;Tayta Wayllaqawaqa chufirmi&quot;, &quot;Mr. Huayllacahua is a driver - I know it for a fact&quot;); &quot;=si&quot; expresses hearsay knowledge (&quot;Tayta Wayllaqawaqa chufirsi&quot;, &quot;Mr. Huayllacahua is a driver, or so I&#x27;ve heard&quot;); &quot;=chá&quot; expresses high probability (&quot;Tayta Wayllaqawaqa chufirchá&quot;, &quot;Mr. Huayllacahua is a driver, most likely&quot;). Colloquially, the latter is also used when the speaker has dreamed the event told in the sentence or experienced it while intoxicated.

Languages that are extremely different from each other, like English and Chinese, need their translations to be more like adaptations. Chinese has no tenses per se, only three aspects. The English verb &quot;to be&quot; does not have a direct equivalent in Chinese. In an English sentence where &quot;to be&quot; leads to an adjective (&quot;It &quot;is&quot; blue&quot;), there is no &quot;to be&quot; in Chinese. (There are no adjectives in Chinese, instead there are stative verbs that do not need an extra verb.) If it states a location, the verb () is used, as in &quot;We &quot;are&quot; in the house&quot;. In some other cases (usually when stating a judgement), the judgment verb () is used, as in &quot;I &quot;am&quot; the leader.&quot; And in most other cases, such structure (&quot;to be&quot;) is simply not used, but some more natural structure in Chinese is used instead. Any sentence that requires a play on those different meanings will not work the same way in Chinese. In fact, very simple concepts in English can sometimes be difficult to translate, for example, there is no single direct translation for the word &quot;yes&quot; in Chinese, as in Chinese the affirmative is said by repeating the verb in the question. (&quot;Do you have it?&quot; &quot;(I) have&quot;.)

===Vocabulary===
German, Dutch and Danish have a wealth of modal particles that are particularly difficult to translate as they convey sense or tone rather than strictly grammatical information. The most infamous example perhaps is (Dutch: , Danish: ), which roughly means &quot;Don&#x27;t you realize that . . . ?&quot; or &quot;In fact it is so, though someone is denying it.&quot; What makes translating such words difficult is their different meanings depending on intonation or the context.

A common use of the word can be found in the German sentence , which translates to &quot;The war wasn&#x27;t lost yet, after all&quot; or &quot;The war was still not lost.&quot;

Several other grammatical constructs in English may be employed to translate these words for each of their occurrences. The same with slightly changed pronunciation can also mean excuse in defense to a question: &quot;. . . but the war was not lost yet (. . . so we fought on).&quot;

A use which relies heavily on intonation and context could produce yet another meaning: &quot;So the war was really not over yet (as you have been trying to convince me all along).&quot;

Another change of intonation makes the sentence a question. would translate into &quot;(You mean) the war was not yet lost (back then)?&quot;

Similar difficulties occur with the Dutch words &quot;even&quot;, &quot;toch&quot;, and, especially, &quot;gezellig&quot;.

Another well-known example comes from the Portuguese or Spanish verbs and , both being translatable as &quot;to be&quot; (see Romance copula). is used with essence or nature, while is used with states or conditions, however. Sometimes this information is not very relevant for the meaning of the whole sentence and the translator will ignore it, whereas at other times it can be retrieved from the context.

When none of these apply, the translator usually uses a paraphrase or simply adds words that can convey the right meaning. The following example comes from Portuguese:
:Spanish equivalent:&quot;
:Literal translation: &quot;I am not (apparently/just right now) handsome; I am (essentially/always) handsome.&quot;
:Adding words: &quot;I am not handsome today; I am always handsome.&quot;
:Paraphrase: &quot;I don&#x27;t look handsome; I am handsome.&quot;

Some South Slavic words that have no English counterparts are &quot;doček&quot;, a gathering organized at someone&#x27;s arrival (the closest translation would be &quot;greeting&quot; or &quot;welcome&quot;, although a &#x27;doček&#x27; is not necessarily positive); and &quot;limar&quot;, a sheet metal worker.

====Family====

Kinship terminology often varies across languages. Terms are often too specific or too general to translate into another language. Some rules used for defining kinship terminology include the following:

Paternal or maternal. For example, Nordic languages, Indo-Aryan languages and Chinese languages distinguish paternal and maternal relatives such as paternal grandmother and maternal grandmother. Conversely, son&#x27;s son and daughter&#x27;s son are also distinguished. Similarly, aunts and uncles are further divided in many languages.

Gender. Whereas English kinship terms make clear distinction between genders, many languages do not. For example, Thai does not distinguish between siblings by gender, but only by age. Thai also disregards gender when aunts or uncles are younger than their parents, and has one word for all nieces, nephews, and grandchildren. On the flip side, the English word &quot;cousins&quot; does not distinguish gender, but many languages do, included Romance languages, Slavic languages and Chinese languages.

By blood or by marriage. For example, the English word &quot;uncle&quot; can refer to a parent&#x27;s brother, or a husband of a parent&#x27;s sibling. Many languages, such as Hindi, Bengali, Hungarian and Chinese distinguish these. This is also true for Latin where e.g. refers to one&#x27;s mother&#x27;s brother, but cannot refer to one&#x27;s mother&#x27;s sister&#x27;s husband, named thus (the husband of the maternal aunt).

Full or half sibling. In Arabic, &quot;brother&quot; is often translated into (). However, whilst this word may describe a brother who shares either one or both parents, there is a separate word - () - to describe a brother with whom one shares both parents.

Age relative to oneself or one&#x27;s parent. For example in Bengali, father&#x27;s elder brothers are called (), while younger brothers are called (). Their wives are called () and (), respectively. Another common issue is translating &quot;brother&quot; or &quot;sister&quot; into Chinese or Japanese, which have separate words for older and younger ones.

Relations by marriage. There is no standard English word for the Italian &quot;, Yiddish &quot;, Latin &quot; &quot;, &quot;, Spanish &quot; or Portuguese &quot;&quot;: a gender-neutral collective plural like &quot;co-in-laws&quot;. If Harry marries Sally, then in Yiddish, Harry&#x27;s father is the &quot; of Sally&#x27;s father; each mother is the &quot; of the other. In Romanian, they are “”. In Bengali, both fathers are and mothers, . Bengali has / for &quot;brother&quot; and / for &quot;brother-in-law&quot;; for &quot;son&quot; and for &quot;son-in-law&quot;.

Spanish and Portuguese contrast &quot;brother&quot; with &quot;brother-in-law&quot; (&quot;/&quot;, &quot;/&quot;); &quot;son&quot; with &quot;son-in-law&quot; (&quot;/&quot;, &quot;/&quot;), and similarly for female relatives like &quot;sister-in-law&quot; (&quot;/&quot;) and &quot;daughter-in-law&quot; (&quot;/&quot;). Both languages use &quot;&quot; (Sp.) or &quot;/&quot; (varying by dialect), as the relationship between two men that marry siblings (or two women, using the feminine &quot;/&quot; instead). In the English language this relationship would be lumped in with &quot;/&quot; (sibling&#x27;s husband or spouse&#x27;s brother) as simply &quot;brother-in-law&quot;. This distinction is reflected also in Italian, with for a brother, for a brother in law; etc. In Latin, the distinction between children and children-in-law is also present, with for one&#x27;s child, for one&#x27;s spouse&#x27;s child that is not ours, (and in feminine) for one&#x27;s child&#x27;s spouse.

Serbian and Bosnian have specific terms for relations by marriage. For example, a &quot;sister-in-law&quot; can be a &quot;snaha/snaja&quot; (brother&#x27;s wife, though also family-member&#x27;s wife in general), &quot;zaova&quot; (husband&#x27;s sister), &quot;svastika&quot; (wife&#x27;s sister) or &quot;jetrva&quot; (husband&#x27;s brother&#x27;s wife). A &quot;brother-in-law&quot; can be a &quot;zet&quot; (sister&#x27;s husband, or family-member&#x27;s husband in general), &quot;djever/dever&quot; (husband&#x27;s brother), &quot;šurak/šurjak&quot; (wife&#x27;s brother) or &quot;badžanak/pašenog&quot; (wife&#x27;s sister&#x27;s husband). Likewise, the term &quot;prijatelj&quot; (same as &quot;makhatunim&quot; in Yiddish, which also translates as &quot;friend&quot;) is also used. Bengali has a number of in-law words. For example, &quot;Boudi&quot; (elder brother&#x27;s wife), &quot;Shaali&quot; (wife&#x27;s sister), &quot;Shaala&quot; (wife&#x27;s younger brother), &quot;Sambandhi&quot; (wife&#x27;s elder brother/Shaali&#x27;s husband), &quot;Bhaasur&quot; (husband&#x27;s elder brother), &quot;Deor&quot; (husband&#x27;s younger brother) &quot;Nanad&quot; (husband&#x27;s sister), &quot;Jaa&quot; (husband&#x27;s brother&#x27;s wife), etc. This is also true for Latin, with words such as (husband&#x27;s brother), (husband&#x27;s sister), (husband&#x27;s brother&#x27;s wife), yet none for the wife&#x27;s part of the family tree.

In Russian, fifteen different words cover relations by marriage, enough to confuse many native speakers . There are for example, as in Yiddish, words like &quot; and &quot; for &quot;co-in-laws&quot;. To further complicate the translator&#x27;s job, Russian in-laws may choose to address each other familiarly by these titles.

In contrast to all of the above fine distinctions, in American English the term &quot;my brother-in-law&quot; covers &quot;my spouse&#x27;s brother&quot;, &quot;my sibling&#x27;s husband&quot;, and &quot;my spouse&#x27;s sibling&#x27;s husband&quot;. In British English, the last of these is not considered strictly correct. 

====Work and school relations====

Japanese has a concept, &quot;amae&quot;, about the closeness of parent-child relationship, that is supposedly unique to that language and culture as it applies to bosses and workers.

Japanese, Chinese, and Korean have words for classmates and colleagues of different seniority and/or gender. The most well-known example to English speakers is probably the Japanese word (), referring to a senior classmate or colleague.

There are also times when the same concept exists but the practice is different, such as homeschooling in Spanish and its practice in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Latin American countries. Translators must discern whether the existing terms convey the same concepts.

====Foreign objects====
Objects unknown to a culture can actually be easy to translate. For example, in Japanese, &quot;wasabi&quot; is a plant (&quot;Wasabia japonica&quot;) used as a spicy Japanese condiment. Traditionally, this plant only grows in Japan. It would be unlikely that someone from a country such as Angola would have a clear understanding of it. However, the easiest way to translate this word is to &quot;borrow&quot; it. Or one can use a similar vegetable&#x27;s name to describe it. In English this word is translated as &quot;wasabi&quot; or &quot;Japanese horseradish&quot;. In Chinese, people can still call it &quot;wasabi&quot; by its Japanese sound, or pronounce it by its Hanzi characters, (pinyin: &quot;shān kuí&quot;). However, wasabi is more frequently called () or () in China and Taiwan, meaning mustard. One may specify &quot;yellow mustard&quot; and &quot;green mustard&quot; to avoid confusion.

Another method is using description instead of a single word. For example, languages like Russian and Ukrainian have borrowed words &quot;Kuraga&quot; and &quot;Uruk&quot; from Turkic languages. While both fruits are now known to the Western world, there are still no terms for them in English. English speakers have to use &quot;dried apricot without core&quot; and &quot;dried apricot with core&quot; instead.

One particular type of foreign object that poses difficulties is the proper noun. As an illustration, consider another example from Douglas Hofstadter, which he published in one of his &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot; columns in &quot;Scientific American&quot;. He pondered the question: &quot;&quot;Who is the first lady of Britain?&quot; Well, first ladies reside at the prime minister&#x27;s address, and at the time, the woman living at 10 Downing Street was Margaret Thatcher. But a different attribute that first ladies have is that they are married to heads of government, so perhaps a better answer was &quot;Denis&quot; Thatcher, but he probably would not have relished the title.&quot;

====Concepts====
Concepts unknown or less known to a culture are difficult to translate because there are no corresponding lexemes. When translating US-specific concepts such as mobile home and foster children, translators cannot simply calque but find ways to adapt the translation such as using a descriptive phrase.

===Poetry, puns and wordplay===

The two areas which most nearly approach total untranslatability are poetry and puns; poetry is difficult to translate because of its reliance on the sounds (for example, rhymes) and rhythms of the source language; puns, and other similar semantic wordplay, because of how tightly they are tied to the original language. The oldest well-known examples are probably those appearing in Bible translations, for example, Genesis 2:7, which explains why God gave Adam this name: &quot;God created Adam out of soil from the ground&quot;; the original Hebrew text reveals the secret, since the word Adam connotes the word ground (being in Hebrew), whereas translating the verse into other languages makes it lose the original pun.

Similarly, consider the Italian adage &quot;&quot;: a literal translation is &quot;translator, traitor&quot;. The pun is lost, though the meaning persists. (A similar solution can be given, however, in Hungarian, by saying , which roughly translates as &quot;translation is distortion&quot;.)

That being said, many of the translation procedures discussed here can be used in these cases. For example, the translator can compensate for an &quot;untranslatable&quot; pun in one part of a text by adding a new pun in another part of the translated text.

Oscar Wilde&#x27;s play &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; incorporates in its title a pun (resonating in the last line of the play) that conflates the name Ernest with the adjective of quality &quot;earnest&quot;. The French title of the translated play is &quot;, replicating and transposing the pun; however, the character Ernest had to be renamed, and the allusion to trickery was lost. (Other French translations include &quot; (faithful) and &quot; (loved), with the same idea of a pun on first name / quality adjective.) A recent Hungarian translation of the same play by Ádám Nádasdy applied a similar solution, giving the subtitle &quot; (lit. &quot;One must be Szilárd&quot;) beside the traditional title &quot;Bunbury&quot;, where &quot;&quot; is a male name as well as an adjective meaning &quot;solid, firm&quot;, or &quot;steady&quot;. Other languages, like Spanish, usually leave the pun untranslated, as in &quot;&quot;, while one translation used the name Severo, which means &quot;severe&quot; or &quot;serious&quot;, close to the original English meaning. Catalan translations always use &quot;&quot;. This example uses the homophones &quot;Frank&quot; (given name) and &quot; (honest, free-spoken). Although this same solution would work in Spanish also (&quot;), it carries heavy political connotations in Spain due to Francisco Franco&#x27;s dictatorship (1939–1975), to a point that even this possible title can be taken directly as ironic/sarcastic: literally, &quot;The importance of being Franco&quot;, so this alternative was never used. However, the German translation &quot;&quot; (literally &quot;Being Ernst is everything&quot;) only changes the name very slightly: in fact (unlike the equivalents in English) the adjective is even spelt exactly as the name &quot;Ernst&quot; and, given the position at the beginning of the title, both meanings would be capitalised.

The Asterix comic strip is renowned for its French puns; its translators have found many ingenious English substitutes.

Other forms of wordplay, such as spoonerisms and palindromes are equally difficult, and often force hard choices on the translator. For example, take the classic palindrome: &quot;A man, a plan, a canal: Panama&quot;. A translator might choose to translate it literally into, say, French – &quot;&quot;, if it were used as a caption for a photo of Theodore Roosevelt (the chief instigator of the Canal), and sacrifice the palindrome. But if the text is meant to give an &quot;example&quot; of a palindrome, they might elect to sacrifice the literal sense and substitute a French palindrome, such as &quot;&quot; (&#x27;A boulder swept away the horned animal&#x27;).

Douglas Hofstadter discusses the problem of translating a palindrome into Chinese, where such wordplay is theoretically impossible, in his book – which is devoted to the issues and problems of translation, with particular emphasis on the translation of poetry. Another example given by Hofstadter is the translation of the poem &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; by Lewis Carroll, with its wealth of neologisms and portmanteau words, into a number of foreign tongues.

A notable Irish joke is that it is not possible to translate mañana into Irish as the Irish &quot;don&#x27;t have a word that conveys that degree of urgency&quot;.

===Iconicity===
According to Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann, &quot;Iconicity might be the reason for refraining from translating &quot;Hallelujah&quot; and &quot;Amen&quot; in so many languages, as if the sounds of such basic religious notions have to do with their referents themselves – as if by losing the sound, one might lose the meaning. Compare this to the Kabbalistic power of letters, for example in the case of gematria, the method of interpreting the Hebrew Scriptures by interchanging words whose letters have the same numerical value when added. A simple example of gematric power might be the famous proverb (), or lit. &quot;entered wine went out secret&quot;, that is, &quot;wine brings out the truth&quot;, &quot;in vino veritas&quot;. The gematric value of , or wine, is 70 (י=10; י=10; ן=50) and this is also the gematric value of , or secret, (ס=60; ו=6; ד=4). Thus, this sentence, according to many Jews at the time, had to be true.&quot;

Barbarous names are magical formulas often taken from foreign languages, but corrupted or meaningless to the magician.
Iamblichus discusses barbarous names, warning magicians not to translate them even if their original meaning is discovered, due to the belief that the power of the names resided in their sound, not their meaning.
In the modern era, Aleister Crowley also argued that the supposed effectiveness of barbarous names rested in their utterance, not their meaning.

<text>Buckinghamshire New University (BNU) is a public university in Buckinghamshire, England, with campuses in High Wycombe, Aylesbury, Uxbridge and Great Missenden. The institution dates from 1891, when it was founded as the School of Science and Art, and has since then has variously been known as Wycombe Technical Institute, High Wycombe College of Technology and Art and the Buckinghamshire College of Higher Education. It was a university college from 1999 until 2007, when its application for university status was accepted.

The university is a member of the GuildHE.

==History==
===19th century origins===
Founded in 1891 as the School of Science and Art, it was initially established with public funds raised from a tax on beer and spirits and set about providing evening classes to residents of High Wycombe and the local area.

===20th century===
After World War I, it was renamed the Wycombe Technical Institute, forging close links with local crafts such as furniture making and cabinetry and helping to provide skills to injured war veterans in order that they might find work in local industries.

Further building took place after World War II, and on 6 May 1963 the new facilities were officially opened by the Minister of Education, Sir Edward Boyle. A new change of name, the High Wycombe College of Technology and Art accompanied this expansion.

By the 1960s, around 3,000 people worked in the manufacture of furniture in High Wycombe, and 80% of the wooden chairs manufactured in Britain were made there.

In 1975 High Wycombe College of Art and Technology merged with the Newland Park College of Education in Chalfont St Giles, and was renamed the Buckinghamshire College of Higher Education. In the same decade Missenden Abbey, a former Augustinian monastery founded in 1133, was acquired, and in May 1988 it was officially opened as a management centre by Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester.

In March 1999 it was awarded University College status by the government, changing its name once again to Buckinghamshire Chilterns University College. Around this time the &quot;Which University&quot; guide described it as a &quot;concrete labyrinth&quot;, which was unlikely to be &quot;bringing home architectural awards&quot;.

===21st century===

In 2007 its application for university status was approved by the Privy Council and it took its current name &quot;Buckinghamshire New University&quot;, abbreviated to Bucks. The university changed its shortened name to &#x27;BNU&#x27; in 2021.

Alternative names such as &#x27;University of Wycombe&#x27;, &#x27;Wycombe University&#x27;, &#x27;University of High Wycombe&#x27;, &#x27;High Wycombe University&#x27;, &#x27;University of Buckinghamshire&#x27; and &#x27;Buckinghamshire Chilterns University&#x27; were rejected. The chosen name was to lead to displeasure from the University of Buckingham for also using the county name.

Bucks had plans to consolidate its campuses into a purpose-built site near to Hughenden Park in High Wycombe on land previously owned by CompAir. While these plans fell through, the university changed plans to renovate and enlarge the main campus as well as consolidate both the Wellesbourne and Chalfont campuses onto the High Wycombe site. Additionally, new halls of residence have been built at the Hughenden Park site.

The university is a lead academic sponsor of Buckinghamshire University Technical College, a new university technical college which opened in Aylesbury in September 2013.

==Campuses==
The university operates over four campuses: High Wycombe Campus (previously belonging to the High Wycombe College of Art and Technology), since 2009 a site in Uxbridge in the London Borough of Hillingdon, a thriving base for nursing students and applied healthcare research, a campus in Aylesbury and a site known as Missenden Abbey which is also a conference centre.

In 2008, the university disposed of two existing campuses; the Chalfont Campus (near Little Chalfont) and the Wellesbourne Campus (near Hazlemere).

=== Gateway building ===
The university undertook a major development of the High Wycombe Campus with a large structure, known as the Gateway Building, being built onto the front of the existing building. It won a RIBA award in 2010.

The Gateway offers facilities including a sports/events hall, fitness centre and performance lab, dance and drama studios, sound design labs, music recording studios and video production suites, a &#x27;modern integrated learning resources centre&#x27;, a cafe and meeting and conference rooms. It also has green screen facilities and a motion capture system.

===Halls of residence===

There is a range of accommodation at Bucks New University including halls of residence, managed houses and the student village:
* Brook Street Halls, the first to be built for Bucks New University, has 396 rooms and is situated opposite High Wycombe bus station, a five minutes&#x27; walk from the university campus.
* Hughenden Park Student Village was completed in 2009. All 410 student rooms are en-suite and the area is a 15 minutes&#x27; walk from the University&#x27;s Wycombe campus.
* Windsor House is located in High Wycombe town centre. Much of the estate used to build the halls has been bought from The Chilterns Shopping Centre.

==Academic profile==
=== Reputation and rankings ===

In November 2013 it was ranked 12th in the UK by the &quot;Huffington Post&quot; in a list of creative universities.
It was also included in a list of the top 14 creative universities in the UK by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in December 2013. Domestically, the university is ranked 70th out of 121 universities for 2023 (&quot;Guardian&quot;) and 39 out of 105 universities in England for teaching quality (&quot;Times / Sunday Times&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

=== Research standing ===
For the most recent 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF), the grading &quot;internationally excellent&quot; or &quot;world leading&quot; was for some submissions in the areas Allied Health Professions, Business and Management Studies, Sport and Exercise Sciences, Art and Design.

=== Specialist courses ===
The university runs several specialist courses.

The Air Transport with Commercial Pilot Training is a course offering students the opportunity to study for a professional pilot&#x27;s licence whilst undertaking university studies in areas such as globalisation of the air transport industry and health safety and security for airlines and airports. Many former students (including Virgin Atlantic deputy chief pilot David Brooks) have gone on to attain jobs as pilots in flying schools, charter companies and airlines around the world including Susi Air, Cathay Pacific, Qatar, BMI and Ryanair.

Although the Air Transport with Commercial Pilot Training course aims to provide guidance and support to students with the aim of becoming commercial pilots, many students are inspired by various modules of the course and pursue careers in other areas within the air transport industry. In 2009 graduate Antony Coe set up his own business DexFix computer repairs. Following this and in conjunction with his studies in Health safety and security for airlines and airports Coe now provides contract services to the counter terrorism task forces worldwide.

In 2023, the university established a new Centre for Intelligence, Security and Resilience and expanded its offerings for students at the start of their careers as well as middle managers looking to apply analysis and information leadership to emerging challenges where intelligence, security and resilience coincide. Key staff in this endeavour include Fiona Galbraith, Mike Croll, Beverley Griffiths, Joel Weaver, Rania Khbais and Shelley Jones.

The university offers several other courses such as Music Management and Film and Television Production. The university also offers a course in Animation and Visual Effects, launched in September 2013.

Bucks New University, in partnership with the UK&#x27;s largest non-metropolitan Police service Thames Valley Police, offers a Degree Apprenticeship for new Police entrants.

== Academics ==
Trevor Baylis was a frequent guest lecturer, and was present at a 2004 graduation ceremony and graduate degree show; he received an honorary degree from the university in 2007, and was present at the official opening of the Gateway building in 2010.

Evans began umpiring Little League games at age 14, where his playing experience as a catcher helped in judging balls and strikes. He attended Kilgore College on scholarship before attending the University of Texas at Austin (UT). He umpired high school and college baseball while attending college. He left UT temporarily in his senior year when he was offered a job in the Florida State League, making him the last umpire hired in professional baseball who had not attended an umpire school. Following his first season in pro baseball (1968), Evans returned to UT in the fall and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in education in January 1969. A month after graduating from UT, Evans attended the newly formed MLB Umpire Development Program in February and March 1969 where he graduated first in this inaugural class. After graduation from umpire school, his minor league contract was purchased by Texas League president Bobby Bragan. Evans then worked in the Texas League (1969–70) and American Association (1971).

===MLB umpire===
Evans joined the AL staff in late 1971, and became an AL crew chief in 1981. Evans wore uniform number 3 starting in 1980, when the AL adopted uniform numbers.

Evans umpired in four World Series (1977, 1982, 1986 and 1996), and in seven American League Championship Series (1975, 1979, 1983, 1985, 1990, 1993 and 1998). Evans also umpired in the All-Star Game in 1976, 1989, and 1999, serving as the home plate umpire in the last two contests. He worked in the American League Division Series in 1981, 1995 (Games 3–5) and 1996, and also in the single-game playoffs to determine the AL Eastern Division champion in 1978 and the AL Western Division champion in 1995.

Evans is one of few umpires in history who have worked in two perfect games, having been the third base umpire for Mike Witt&#x27;s perfect game on September 30, 1984, and the second base umpire for David Cone&#x27;s perfect game on July 18, 1999. Evans was the home plate umpire both for Nolan Ryan&#x27;s first no-hitter (May 15, 1973) and Don Sutton&#x27;s 300th career victory (June 18, 1986).

===Umpiring school===
Evans operated the &quot;Jim Evans Academy of Professional Umpiring&quot; from 1990 through 2012; many graduates became minor league umpires, and some later became major league umpires. In early 2012, Minor League Baseball (MiLB), who would often hire Evans&#x27; graduates as the first step of a professional umpiring career, severed ties with the school. This occurred following investigation of a private bowling party for school employees, where one group selected a team name, and briefly wore costumes, in the style of the Ku Klux Klan. The school administrator was discharged for his role in the incident. Evans apologized for the incident and reached a legal settlement during mediation. Part of the settlement included Evans being hired as a special advisor on umpiring matters to the president of Minor League Baseball.

In addition to instructing in the United States, Evans has trained umpires in Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Japan, Puerto Rico, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. In 2014, he was hired as an umpire advisor by MiLB, acting as a consultant to the MiLB president.

==Personal life==
Evans served in the Texas Air National Guard for a 6-year enlistment and was later commissioned in the US Army Reserves. He served in the Army Reserves for 8 years and was honorably discharged as a Captain.

== History ==

The area was purchased from three local Maori Chiefs by The Williams family in the late 1830s, the farm being called Penrose after their home area in Cornwall, England.

The railway line between Auckland and Onehunga running through Penrose (now known as the Onehunga Line) was one of the first Government funded railways in New Zealand, being opened in 1873. It was built by the Auckland provincial government. 
Industry started to flourish in the area from the 1920s, due to its close connection to the main railway line and the main road (Great South Road) with these important transport links later strengthened by the motorway (State Highway 1) built following the same alignment in the 1950s. By this time, around 5,000 workers were employed in the suburb.}

The new motorway and the move of industrial and manufacturing occupations out of older centres like the Auckland CBD soon started a boom in the Penrose-Mount Wellington area. Industry also successfully lobbied for state housing to be built close by, to provide the new area with a supply of labour. To this day, the area remains almost exclusively industrial, with a mix of run-down areas and newly established sites.

== Climate ==
== Education ==
Despite the low local population, Penrose is the site of the former Penrose High School, which in 2008 renamed itself One Tree Hill College, to shed the &#x27;industrial&#x27; associations of the name. The school attracts many students from out of the suburb, many of its students coming from as far as 20 km away. The school is coeducational and has a roll of as of 

The Auckland Japanese Supplementary School (AJSS; オークランド日本語補習学校 &quot;Ōkurando Nihongo Hoshūgakkō&quot;), a Japanese supplementary school, holds its classes at One Tree Hill College.

==Sport and recreation==
Penrose is home to the New Zealand Warriors, who are based at Mount Smart Stadium.

<doc id="1030713" wikidata="Q347418" url="?curid=1030713" title="Gabe Newell">
<text>Gabe Logan Newell (born November 3, 1962), also known by his nickname Gaben, is an American video game developer and businessman. He is the president and co-founder of the video game company Valve Corporation.

Newell was born in Colorado and grew up in Davis, California. He attended Harvard University in the early 1980s but dropped out to join Microsoft, where he helped create the first versions of the Windows operating system. In 1996, he and Mike Harrington left Microsoft to found Valve and fund the development of their first game, &quot;Half-Life&quot; (1998). Harrington sold his stake in Valve to Newell and left in 2000. Newell led the development of Valve&#x27;s digital distribution service, Steam, which launched in 2003 and controlled most of the market for downloaded PC games by 2011.

As of 2021, Newell owned at least one quarter of Valve. He has been estimated as one of the wealthiest people in the United States and the wealthiest person in the video games industry, with a net worth of as of 2024. He is also the owner of the marine research organization Inkfish and the neuroscience company Starfish Neuroscience.

== Early life and education ==
Newell was born on November 3, 1962, in Colorado, and attended Davis Senior High School in Davis, California. He worked as a paperboy, and later a telegram messenger for Western Union. He enrolled at Harvard University in 1980, but was convinced to drop out to work at Microsoft by the head of sales in 1983.

== Career ==
=== Microsoft ===
Newell spent 13 years at Microsoft as a programmer and technical executive, and produced the first three releases of the operating system Windows. Newell later said he learned more during his first three months at Microsoft than he ever did at Harvard, which was one of the primary reasons why he dropped out.

In late 1995, &quot;Doom&quot;, a 1993 first-person shooter game developed by id Software, was estimated to be installed on more computers worldwide than Microsoft&#x27;s new operating system, Windows 95. Newell said: &quot;[id] ... didn&#x27;t even distribute through retail, it distributed through bulletin boards and other pre-internet mechanisms. To me, that was a lightning bolt. Microsoft was hiring 500-people sales teams and this entire company was 12 people, yet it had created the most widely distributed software in the world. There was a sea change coming.&quot; At Microsoft, Newell led development on a port of &quot;Doom&quot; for Windows 95, which is credited for helping make Windows a viable game platform.

=== Valve ===

Inspired by Michael Abrash, who left Microsoft to work on the game &quot;Quake&quot; at id, Newell and another employee, Mike Harrington, left Microsoft to found the video game company Valve on August 24, 1996. Newell opted to found Valve instead of retiring as he felt working with &quot;other really smart, motivated, socially orientated people to create product that would affect millions of other people&quot; was &quot;the most fun I could have&quot;.

Newell and Harrington funded development of the first Valve game, the first-person shooter &quot;Half-Life&quot; (1998), which was a critical and commercial success. Harrington sold his stake in Valve to Newell in 2000. Newell gave Valve no deadline and a &quot;virtually unlimited&quot; budget to develop &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; (2004), promising to fund it himself if necessary. He and Valve came close to bankruptcy during a legal battle with Vivendi Games, which ended when an intern discovered an email revealing that Vivendi was destroying evidence.

During the development of &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, Newell spent several months developing Steam, a digital distribution service for games. By 2011, Steam controlled between 50% and 70% of the market for downloaded PC games and generated most of Valve&#x27;s revenue. At a technology conference in Seattle that year, Newell argued that software piracy was best addressed by offering a superior option rather than pursuing anti-piracy technology. He cited Steam&#x27;s success in Russia, where piracy is rife, as an example.In 2007, Newell expressed his displeasure over developing for game consoles, saying that developing processes for Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 3 was a &quot;waste of everybody&#x27;s time&quot;. On stage at Sony&#x27;s keynote at E3 2010, he acknowledged his criticism but discussed the open nature of the PlayStation 3 and announced a port of &quot;Portal 2&quot;, remarking that with Steamworks support it would be the best version for any console. Newell also criticized the Xbox Live service, referring to it as a &quot;train wreck&quot;, and Windows 8, calling it a threat to the open nature of PC gaming. At the 2013 LinuxCon, Newell said the Linux operating system and open source development were &quot;the future of gaming&quot;. He accused the proprietary systems of companies such as Microsoft and Apple of stifling innovation through slow certification processes. 

In 2009, &quot;IGN&quot; named Newell one of the top 100 game creators, writing that it was &quot;almost impossible to gauge&quot; Valve&#x27;s influence on game design, technology and the video games industry. In December 2010, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed Newell as &quot;A Name You Need to Know&quot;, primarily for his work on Steam and partnerships with multiple major developers. In 2013, Newell was added to the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences Hall of Fame and received the BAFTA Fellowship for his contributions to the video game industry. As of 2024, Newell had become less involved in Valve and was spending more time on personal projects.

=== Other ventures ===
In 2020, Newell and the Valve employee Yahn Bernier created a car racing team, the Heart of Racing, to raise funds for children&#x27;s charities in Seattle and New Zealand. In 2022, with Philip Sabes, Newell co-founded the neuroscience company Starfish Neuroscience to develop neural interfaces. Newell is the owner of the marine research organization Inkfish, which owns several ships and submarines. In November 2022, Inkfish purchased the Hadal Exploration System, a private deep-sea exploration platform, from the undersea explorer Victor Vescovo.

== Net worth ==
In October 2017, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed Newell among the 100 wealthiest people in the United States, with an estimated net worth of . In December 2021, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated that Newell had a net worth of and owned at least one quarter of Valve. According to Charlie Fish, the author of &quot;The&quot; &quot;History of Video Games&quot;, as of 2021 Newell was the richest person in the video game industry. In 2024, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated that Newell owned 50.1% of Valve and had a net worth of $9.5 billion.

== Personal life ==

Newell formerly suffered from Fuchs&#x27; dystrophy, a congenital disease which affects the cornea. He was cured via two cornea transplants in 2006 and 2007. On the same day he founded Valve with Harrington, Newell married Lisa Mennet. They have two sons. The birth of their first son in the late 1990s inspired the final boss of &quot;Half-Life&quot;, as the couple considered childbirth the most frightening thing they could think of at the time. As of 2019, Newell and Mennet had divorced.

In 2011, Newell said his favorite video games included &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, &quot;Doom&quot;, and a Burroughs mainframe version of the 1971 &quot;Star Trek&quot; game, which was the first game he ever played. &quot;Doom&quot; convinced him that games were the future of entertainment, and &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; convinced him that games were art. Newell was a fan of the animated series &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&quot;. He also recorded a voice pack for the Valve game &quot;Dota 2&quot;, which referenced many previous statements and phrases from himself in a humorous manner.

Within the gaming community, Newell has the nickname Gaben, derived from his work email address. Newell said that he tried to grow into his public image: &quot;[Fans] hug me when they run into me. I&#x27;m not a hugging person, but that&#x27;s what they want. I was with my kids the first time that happened in public, and my kids were pretty cool with it. But I wasn&#x27;t. &#x27;Dad, roll with it.&#x27; Even now, I&#x27;m learning from our customers.&quot;

Newell was visiting New Zealand with friends when the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, and elected to stay in Auckland once travel restrictions were eased. As an expression of gratitude for New Zealand&#x27;s hospitality, he and others arranged a free event, We Love Aotearoa, with live performances from musical artists across New Zealand. It was accompanied by VR stands for Valve games such as &quot;Half-Life: Alyx&quot; and &quot;The Lab&quot;. The event was postponed from August to December due to a lockdown induced by a second wave of COVID-19. Newell applied for permanent residency in New Zealand in October 2020, but had returned to Seattle by 2021. Newell owns several ships, and has lived mostly at sea since the pandemic.

<text>The Moriarty Tribunal, officially called the Tribunal of Inquiry into certain Payments to Politicians and Related Matters, was an Irish Tribunal of Inquiry established in 1997 into the financial affairs of politicians Charles Haughey and Michael Lowry. It has revealed significant tax evasion by these and other politicians and leading businessmen. As a consequence, the tax authorities have recovered millions of euro in settlements and penalties from many individuals. The final report of the tribunal was expected to be published in mid-January 2010, but was delayed and was published 22 March 2011.

==Background==
As a result of change of management in Dunnes Stores, a leading retail group in Ireland, it was revealed in the press that Ben Dunne had made substantial secret payments to the former Taoiseach Charles Haughey and Minister Michael Lowry. In response the Bruton Government established The McCracken Inquiry in 1997 to investigate. The inquiry reported in late 1997 and confirmed the facts and revealed monies in secret Ansbacher accounts owned by Haughey for which it could not determine the source.

===Establishment===

In response to the &quot;McCracken Report&quot;, the new Ahern Government issued terms of reference for a new follow-up tribunal on 26 September 1997. The sole member of the Tribunal is the Honourable Mr Justice Michael Moriarty, leading to the name Moriarty Tribunal.

The terms were inquiry into &quot;(inter alia)&quot;:
*whether substantial payments which might not have been ethical to receive were made to Charles Haughey (Taoiseach during part of the time concerned) and Michael Lowry between 1 January 1979 and 31 December 1996,
*the source of those payments,
*whether payments were made to people holding public office,
*whether Mr Haughey made any decisions benefiting a person making such a payment,
*the source of money in various bank accounts in Ireland, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man,
*whether the Republic&#x27;s tax authorities were properly and timely informed of the existence of various payments and gifts to Messrs. Haughey and Lowry.

The preliminary report into the Haughey payments was published on 19 December 2006. The final reports were published in 2011.

===Costs and delays===
The Tribunal sat for the first time on 31 October 1997 and heard its first witness on 28 January 1999. By September 2004, the Tribunal had sat on 286 days but sittings were suspended pending a High Court hearing in which mobile phone entrepreneur Denis O&#x27;Brien tried unsuccessfully to prevent the tribunal from investigating Michael Lowry&#x27;s involvement in his purchase of Doncaster Rovers F.C. The tribunal ended up lasting much longer than anticipated and cost the state millions in direct costs and legal assistance to witnesses, something that has been criticised by the people whom the tribunal investigated.

In March 2010, it was estimated the tribunal had cost the state approximately €39 million, with final costs expected to exceed €100 million.

==Volume I==
* Dunne payments to Haughey
* Use of accounts in Ansbacher by Haughey
* Management of Haughey&#x27;s financial affairs by Des Traynor
* Sale of Glen Ding Woods to CRH plc
* Management of donations for a liver transplant for Brian Lenihan

=== 2006 Findings ===

* Confirmation of facts regarding payments by Dunne to Haughey and Lowry
* Confirmation of use of the Ansbacher accounts by Haughey
* Mr. Haughey had obstructed the tribunal
* Tax avoidance findings
* Mr. Haughey stole a &quot;sizeable proportion&quot; from the Brian Lenihan medical fund and took steps to conceal his actions
* Claims that Mr. Haughey knew little about his own personal finances were rejected
* Charles Haughey accepted cash in return for favours throughout his political career.

=== Consequences ===
* Investigations of Mr Haughey and Mr Lowry for tax evasion by the Revenue Commissioners. Settlements by both
* Advance sale and leaseback of his home, Abbeville, by Mr Haughey
* Revelations of use of the Ansbacher accounts by other businessmen and politicians for tax avoidance. An interim report on the lead to an investigation by the Department of Trade and Enterprise which named the holders, and led to Denis Foley TD leaving Fianna Fáil. The Cayman island scandal which was investigated by the Moriarty tribunal involved Guinness and Mahon bank and has not yielded a single prosecution, as of March 2013, because of a lack of &quot;original documentation. However, the Revenue Commissioner documents state that as of the end of 2013 a &quot;total yield&quot; of €112.69m has been obtained from 141 Ansbacher account cases. This is made up of €50.1m in tax paid and €62.59m in penalties&quot;.
* Related press investigations on corruption, such as that on Beverley Flynn TD
* Related investigations by the Dáil Public Accounts committee on the use of foreign accounts for tax evasion, leading to settlements by the banks, and thousands of individuals.

==Volume II==

===Awarding of the second mobile phone licence===
The circumstances surrounding the awarding of the second GSM mobile phone licence to the Esat Digifone consortium in 1996 (the biggest contract ever awarded by the State to a private company) by the Rainbow Coalition government was the focus of the work of the tribunal from 2007. The tribunal investigated whether money changed hands prior to the awarding of the licence to Esat Digifone by former Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications Michael Lowry TD. Denis O&#x27;Brien claimed preliminary findings by the tribunal effectively state that the Esat consortium was &quot;illegally&quot; issued with the state&#x27;s second mobile-phone licence because he had a &quot;corrupt&quot; relationship with Michael Lowry. A number of failed bidders are suing the state over the handling of the competition process.

====Esat Digifone====

In 1995, Esat Digifone was a consortium made up of Denis O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Communicorp (40%), Telenor AB (40%) and the remaining 20% held by institutional shareholders. Esat Digifone won the 1995 competition process and entered into exclusive negotiations with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.

=====Exclusive negotiations and new shareholding by Dermot Desmond=====
It transpired that during the contracting period a change in the shareholding in Esat Digifone had occurred with financier Dermot Desmond&#x27;s IIU Nominees taking a share of 25% of the company and Communicorp and Telenor AB holding the remainder between them. The Department of Communications decided that the 25% holding by IIU Ltd. was unacceptable in May 1996 and demanded a return to the 40-40-20 structure, but this information was not communicated to the Attorney-General&#x27;s office at the time.

The department and Lowry demanded that the 40:40:20 breakdown of the shares in Esat should be restored prior to the issuing of the licence, which resulted in Desmond selling part of his shareholding to Communicorp and Telenor. The licence was awarded to Digifone in May 1996, with Lowry announcing Digifone the winner before civil servants involved in judging the competition made their final decision.

=====Legal opinion of Richard Nesbitt SC=====

In May 1996, the Attorney-General&#x27;s office sought the advice of barrister Richard Nesbitt regarding the change in shareholding. Nesbitt advised the government that the licence could be awarded regardless of the fact that Dermot Desmond had joined the consortium at a later date. The advice of Nesbitt as recalled by Denis McFadden – a barrister in the A-G&#x27;s office – was to the effect that IIU&#x27;s entry was not a material change and merely amounted to &quot;equity finance&quot;.

=====Moriarty&#x27;s findings=====
In February 2008, Judge Moriarty gave a legal finding that the written advice given by Richard Nesbitt in 1996 to the Attorney General&#x27;s office did not cover what is known as &quot;the ownership issue&quot;. This finding followed a private meeting of tribunal counsel in October 2002 recalled by Denis McFadden BL and attended by, amongst others, John Gormley BL and Richard Nesbitt SC, Jerry Healy SC for the tribunal described Nesbitt&#x27;s advice to the government as &quot;shite&quot;. Following the addition of new evidence, Judge Moriarty conceded that the advice of Richard Nesbitt did cover the acquisition of a 25% shareholding by IIU and that he would reappraise his interim findings that it did not. Judge Moriarty admitted to making &quot;not insignificant mistakes&quot; in regards to the license issue which would have to be &quot;taken on the chin and acknowledged&quot;.

==== Statements by key participants ====

A media war broke out in early 2010 over the preliminary findings of the tribunal with Denis O&#x27;Brien, Michael Lowry TD and Judge Moriarty each making statements about the process.

===== O&#x27;Brien Statement =====

Denis O&#x27;Brien sent a letter to the chairman of the tribunal Judge Moriarty alleging that the tribunal&#x27;s &quot;activities really reaches a new low in Irish judicial history&quot; and was &quot;totally biased&quot; O&#x27;Brien has claimed that the tribunal had set out to &quot;get his scalp&quot;, but &quot;must now admit they were wrong&quot;
Denis O&#x27;Brien established the website MoriartyTribunal.com on 16 October 2009. The site was created by the O&#x27;Brien team to present his perspective on the work of the Moriarty Tribunal

=====Lowry statement=====

In January 2010 Michael Lowry TD issued a 3,400-word statement (available here) outlining his perspective on the tribunal. Lowry&#x27;s claims relate principally to the involvement of financier Dermot Desmond as a 20 per cent shareholder in the Esat Digifone consortium and outlining that it was not possible for him to meddle in the process or direct a result without the collusion of civil servants. Lowry has also criticised the tribunal in the Dáil, pointing out the high costs and delay involved.

=====Moriarty Statement=====

Judge Moriarty has said his report will be &quot;founded unequivocally on evidence&quot; and not on speculation and working hypotheses and that he was not &quot;trying to cobble together a report that will unjustly condemn&quot; people on &quot;flimsy evidence&quot;. He was mystified as to why this &quot;unthinkable suggestion&quot; should be made concerning someone who had been appointed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. He had learned as a judge to be &quot;big enough and humble enough to correct errors&quot; but he was not saying errors had been made and important matters remained to be canvassed in evidence. Judge Moriarty also hit back at the media campaign against the tribunal claiming he was &quot;not going to be distracted by the prevalence of spin, and other controversies...that would not be welcomed by the courts.&quot;

===2011 Findings===
====Conclusions====
*Lowry &quot;secured the winning&quot; of the 1995 mobile licence for O&#x27;Brien.
*O&#x27;Brien made two payments to Lowry in 1996 and 1999 totalling IR£500,000 (£147,000 and £300,000) and supported a loan of £420,000 given to Lowry in 1999, a benefit equivalent to a payment.
*Lowry imparted substantive information to O&#x27;Brien which was &quot;of significant value and assistance to him in securing the licence&quot;.
*Lowry bypassed consideration by his Cabinet colleagues and thereby not only influenced, but delivered the result for Esat Digifone.
* A US$50,000 donation to Fine Gael was made through Telenor on behalf of Esat Digifone.
*Lowry sought to influence a hike in the lease for Marlborough House (Telecom Éireann headquarters) following a request from Mr Dunne. These rent increases would have improperly enriched Dunne, and were deemed to be &quot;profoundly corrupt&quot;.
*Lowry was criticised for his &quot;cynical and venal abuse of office&quot; and his brazen refusal to acknowledge the impropriety of his financial arrangements with O&#x27;Brien and Dunne.

====Recommendations====
*Greater precautions ought to have been taken to segregate those conducting the evaluation of the mobile phone licence bids from their political master.
*All donations to politicians or political parties should be reported to the SIPO (Standards in Public Office) Commission.
*All recommendations by public office holders to the Revenue Commissioners be in writing.

===Criminal investigation===

Following the publication of the final report of the tribunal copies were sent to the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda Commissioner and the Director of Public Prosecutions. A team of detectives, led by the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) chief, DCS Eugene Corcoran, investigated if the report could identify any criminal wrongdoing that could be then investigated.

<doc id="1030722" wikidata="Q607348" url="?curid=1030722" title="Gjallarhorn">
<text>In Norse mythology, Gjallarhorn (Old Norse: ; &quot;hollering horn&quot; or &quot;the loud sounding horn&quot;) is a horn associated with the god Heimdallr and the wise being Mímir. The sound of Heimdallr&#x27;s horn will herald the beginning of Ragnarök, the sound of which will be heard in all corners of the world. Gjallarhorn is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional material, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson.

==Attestations==
Gjallarhorn is attested once by name in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; while it receives three mentions in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;:

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Gjallarhorn is mentioned three times, all mentions occurring in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;. 

In chapter 15, the enthroned figure Just-As-High tells the disguised Gangleri about the cosmological tree Yggdrasil. Just-As-High says that one of the three roots of Yggdrasil reaches to the well Mímisbrunnr, which belongs to Mímir, and contains much wisdom and intelligence. Using Gjallarhorn, Heimdallr drinks from the well and thus is himself wise.

In chapter 27 of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, High tells Gangleri about Heimdallr. High mentions that Heimdallr is the owner of the &quot;trumpet&quot; (see footnote) Gjallarhorn and that &quot;its blast can be heard in all worlds&quot;. 

In chapter 51, High foretells the events of Ragnarök. After the enemies of the gods will gather at the plain Vígríðr, Heimdallr will stand and mightily blow into Gjallarhorn. The gods will awake and assemble together at the thing.

==Archaeological record==

A figure holding a large horn to his lips and clasping a sword on his hip appears on a stone cross from the Isle of Man. Some scholars have theorized that this figure is a depiction of Heimdallr with Gjallarhorn.

A 9th or 10th century Gosforth Cross in Cumbria, England depicts a figure holding a horn and a sword standing defiantly before two open-mouthed beasts. This figure has been oft theorized as depicting Heimdallr with Gjallarhorn.

==Theories and interpretations==

Scholar Rudolf Simek comments that the use of a horn as both a musical instrument and a drinking vessel is not particularly odd, and that the concept is also employed with tales of the legendary Old French hero Roland&#x27;s horn, Olifant. Simek notes that the horn is among the most ancient of Germanic musical instruments, along with lurs, and, citing archaeological finds (such as the 5th century Golden Horns of Gallehus from Denmark), comments that there appears to have been sacral horns kept purely for religious purposes among the Germanic people; understood as earthly versions of Heimdallr&#x27;s Gjallarhorn, reaching back to the early Germanic Iron Age.

<doc id="1030725" wikidata="Q7225185" url="?curid=1030725" title="Politics and government of Nuevo León">
<text>The governmental structures of Nuevo León, a Mexican state, are organized according to article 30 of the state constitution, which provides for a republican, representative and popular government, divided into three independent branches (executive, legislative and judicial) that cannot be joined together in a single person or institution. Nuevo León&#x27;s relation with the federal government of Mexico places it in a similar relation to that federal government as any other Mexican state, but it retains certain aspects of sovereignty with respect to other Mexican states and even toward foreign countries, especially with reference to its own internal affairs.

==Executive power==

Executive power rests in a governor, who is directly elected by the citizens, using a secret ballot, to a 6-year term with no possibility of reelection. The position is open only to a Mexican citizen by birth, at least 30 years old with at least 5 years residency in Nuevo León. , the office is held by Samuel García Sepúlveda of the Citizen&#x27;s Movement.
The executive branch includes various institutions, which can be divided into two basic types:
centralized public administration and parastatal public administration. Centralized public administration consists of the state-level secretaries of departments, statewide procurement, and their subordinates. Parastatal public administration consists of decentralized public entities, such as enterprises in which the state government has majority control and public trusteeships.

Nuevo León has not always had a democratically elected governor; &quot;see Governors of Nuevo León.&quot;

==Legislative power==


Legislative power rests in a unicameral legislature composed of 42 deputies, also elected via secret ballot by the citizenry, 26 of whom are directly elected and 16 chosen according to a plurinominal system involving proportional representation. the LXXI Legislature of Nuevo León consists of 15 PRI deputies, 22 PAN deputies, 2 from PT, 2 from PANAL and 1 from PRD. To become a deputy, one must be a Mexican citizen by birth, at least 21 years old with at least 5 years residency in Nuevo León.

==Judicial power==

Judicial power is invested in the Superior Court of Justice of Nuevo León, along with 7 ministers elected to a &quot;Consejo de la Judicatura&quot; for a term of 10 years, with the possibility of succeeding themselves once. These are elected by the state congress from a list presented by the governor. The Tribunal and the Council supervise 12 judicial districts. Membership of the Tribunal is limited to Mexican citizens by birth, at least 35 years old, with at least ten years practicing law with the title of Licenciado en Derecho, and at least 5 years residency in Nuevo León.
The Presiding Minister Gustavo Adolfo Guerrero Gutiérrez was elected on August 1, 2007.

==Political parties==
In accord with article 40 of the State Electoral Law, official recognition of a political party is determined by the State Electoral Commission only after verifying that the party has received 1.5% or more of the votes in a local election. , the recognized parties are PRI, PAN, PRD, PVEM, PT and CD.

==Municipalities==

Nuevo León consists of 51 autonomous municipalities, each headed by a mayor (&quot;&#x27;presidente municipal&quot; / &quot;alcalde&quot;) with a 3-year term; mayors can serve no more than two consecutive terms. Mayors must be Mexican citizens by birth, at least 21 years old with at least one-year residency in the municipality. , the municipalities are:

*Sabinas Hidalgo
*Salinas Victoria
*San Nicolás de los Garza
*San Pedro Garza García
*Santa Catarina

==Citizenship==

According to the state constitution, a Nuevoleonese citizen is a person who was either born in Nuevo León or a Mexican citizen who has maintained residency in the state for more than two years and has not indicated to the municipal authorities a desire to preserve his/her previous citizenship. Citizenship can be lost or suspended, among other reasons, for being or becoming a Mexican army officer in charge of federal troops entering or stationed inside the state borders or for committing certain crimes. Noble titles are not recognized and individual rights and freedoms are protected by the Title I of the state constitution.

<doc id="1030729" wikidata="Q4335072" url="?curid=1030729" title="Opawa">
<text>Opawa (; ) is an inner residential suburb of Christchurch, New Zealand. It is located approximately south-east of the city centre. Prior to European settlement, much of the area consisted of marshlands and mixed-use vegetation. By the 1850s, the area was sparsely populated by settlers and became a dairying locality, with many of the early settlers being farmers and people of English descent. Opawa had little development in its early years as it transitioned into a residential suburb.

An early sign of an emerging European community in the area was the arrival of Rev. William Willock, an early settler area who built a cottage titled &quot;Opawaha Cottage&quot;, a reference to the Māori name of the area. Another early European settler, Joshua Strange Williams, abbreviated his property as &quot;Opawa Farm&quot;. Opawa, eventually became the recognised name for the area. As Woolston emerged as an industrial hub nearby, Opawa was heavily urbanised. This transformed it into an upscale residential area with a population largely consisting of factory workers and businesspeople. Opawa and its neighbouring suburb of Hillsborough were also formerly home to multiple brickmaking and clay related-industries. Though the suburb is predominantly residential at present time, and lies mostly within a U-shaped bend of the Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River. Opawa was amalgamated in to the Greater-Christchurch city area in October 1916.

At a national level, the suburb is part of the Christchurch Central parliamentary electorate. Locally, it is part of the Heathcote Ward for local body elections. The suburb contains three primary schools and two kindergartens. The suburb hosts two local sports clubs; the Opawa Bowling Club and the Opawa Lawn Tennis Club. Additional sporting amenities are located in Hansen Park which accommodates two rugby fields, two football fields and the clubrooms of a local athletics club.

Its population largely consists of European New Zealanders, and contains numerous landmarks known for their connection with the early settlers in the area. Notable individuals associated with the suburb include politician William Pember Reeves, wartime women&#x27;s labour administrator Noeline Baker, and Anthony Wilding, one of New Zealand&#x27;s most successful tennis players.

==Toponymy==
The toponymy of &#x27;Opawa&#x27; is an anglicisation and an abbreviation of the Māori name for the area, , a name it shares with its neighbouring river. is a combination of &quot;Ō&quot; which means &#x27;a part of&#x27; and &quot;pā&quot; and &quot;waho&quot; which means &#x27;outer&#x27; or &#x27;outside a defined area&#x27;. could also translate to &#x27;the seawards pā&#x27; or &#x27;an outpost pā&#x27;. The first anglicised names of were &#x27;Oparia&#x27; and &#x27;Oporia&#x27; first seen used in April 1844, though these spellings are no longer in common usage. Another archaic spelling for the area is &#x27;Opawaha&#x27;, used in the 1850s. The anglicised name, &#x27;Opawa&#x27;, was first known to be used by early European settler Joshua Strange Williams to address his property. The name, Opawa, was first known to the &quot;Lyttelton Times&quot; in 1862.

==History==

===Māori settlement===

Māori began to settle in the Christchurch area in 1250 AD and Māori settlements were scattered throughout the area. A kāinga was located near the present-day Vincent Place and Judge Street intersection. It was also a resting place for travellers between Kaiapoi Pā and the Banks Peninsula. The land in this area was marshy and covered with raupō and tussock. Māori lived in the marshy regions of Opawa and used its surrounding swamplands, creeks and the river as an abundant food source of duck (pārera), lamprey (kanakana) and eels (tuna).

The name of the Māori kāinga itself was (meaning &#x27;piegon breasted&#x27;). It is also the name of an early rangatira (chief) of the settlement and the name is also applied to an old Māori walking track that led from the village over the sandhills to the kāinga in South New Brighton (). Later, was the Opawa settlement&#x27;s chief. A hapū of Ngāi Tahu built the village in the 18th century and the name given to this hapū was &quot;Ō-Roto-Repo&quot; meaning &#x27;swamp dwellers&#x27;.

In 1927, a local resident of Opawa &quot;Mr. Rees&quot;, discovered a skull and some bones, which are believed to be those of a Māori person. A piece of pounamu (greenstone) was also discovered at the site near the settlement, beside the Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River. Mr. Rees&#x27;s discovery could indicate the area could have been a &quot;tapu&quot; (sacred) burial site for Māori.

===European settlement===
Early European settlement began in the 1850s and Opawa sparsely populated by European (Pākehā) settlers and the area south of modern-day suburbs Linwood and Woolston became an agricultural (dairying) locality. An early sign of an emerging European community in the area was the arrival of Rev. William Willock, an early settler in the Canterbury Region who arrived to Lyttelton Harbour on the &quot;Randolph&quot; in 1850. Willock built a cottage (located much closer to St. Martins hill than present day Opawa) and used to hold church services at his home, known as &quot;Opawaha Cottage&quot;. His cottage was still standing in Albert Terrace 100 years later and was used as a stable. Willock Place in St. Martins is named in honour of him.

St. Martins, Hillsborough, and Murray Ansyley Hill were originally parts of Opawa, before the districts began to acquire an importance of being their own. Many settlers in Opawa were farmers and people of English descent, many of whom came from relatively wealthy families. Prominent early European settlers in the Opawa district included Edward Richardson, Edward Steane Harley, and Thomas Tancred.

Various names represented the area (such as Opawako and Opawaha) until 1862, when an early European settler, Joshua Strange Williams, addressed his property as &quot;Opawa Farm&quot; to the &quot;Lyttelton Times&quot;. &quot;Opawa&quot; eventually becoming the recognised name for the area.

A number of opulent houses were initially built on large sections and was considered a desirable suburb at the time because of its location surrounded by the Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River, which attracted many to settle here. Opawa developed little during its early years in becoming a residential suburb, the centre of the locality was reportedly the corner of Locarno Street and Opawa Road. Opawa was established around a U-shaped bend of the Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River. Up until the 1890s, the only regular means of transportation, was a stagecoach which ran along Opawa Road.

As Woolston emerged as an industrial hub nearby and became the centre of the country&#x27;s rubber industry in the 20th century, the population of Opawa grew considerably, transforming it into a fashionable residential area. Subsequently, Opawa was urbanised as factory workers and businesspeople from Woolston&#x27;s industrial areas relocated after being unable to find housing within Woolston itself.

A number of brickmaking and clay industries were formerly based in Opawa, Hillsborough and the surrounding hills, which contributed in the industrial development of Christchurch.

Opawa suffered some damage in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake. A section of shops along Opawa Road had been closed due to the damage, while the other shops remained operating as usual, and several homes had been damaged by collapsing chimneys. In the February 2011 earthquake, two churches in the suburb had some structural and surface damages.

==Geography==
In the 19th century, much of the area consisted of grasslands and mixed-use vegetation. Its surroundings largely consisted of marshlands and swamplands which were heavily connected to the ecosystem of the Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River. At present time, State Highway 76 (Brougham Street) and the Main South Line traverses through the suburb. Other suburbs nearby include, Murray Aynsley Hill, Huntsbury, St. Martins, Waltham, Hillsborough, and Linwood. Most of Opawa lies within a U-shaped bend in the Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River.

Opawa&#x27;s proximity to the river has resulted in numerous flooding incidents in the area. Notable instances of significant flooding in the area occurred in August 1941, April 1962, and January 1980. In 1986, the Woolston Cut began to allow flood waters to bypass a long loop of the Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River. In recent times, noted flooding incidents in Opawa occurred in 2014 and 2017. The suburb&#x27;s main roads are Opawa Road and Ensors Road, and the suburb&#x27;s main retail precinct is centred on Opawa Road, which was developed on one of the earliest settled routes, at the intersection of Hawford and Reeves Roads. Opawa Road is no longer the primary thoroughfare through to Lyttelton and Heathcote Valley.

==Landmarks==
Opawa contains several landmarks and locations of historical interest, known for their connection with the early European settlers in the area:

* Risingholme, a Victorian homestead built in 1864 by European settlers Mary and William Reeves. Up until 1943, the building was owned by several private owners. It was later purchased by philanthropist John McKenzie in 1943. The building was gifted to the community for the &quot;health, amusement and instruction of the public&quot;. A community centre was established here in 1944. It has a Category 2 listing with Heritage New Zealand.

* Another place of historical interest is an untitled house located on 41 Opawa Road. The section was taken up in 1851 by early settler William Draper. Later in 1852, Alexander Sherwood Jackson bought the land. Later selling it to another settler, J. S. Williams the same year. A businessman, William Wombwell Charters, built a house here in 1879. Opawa was a considered a desirable suburb at the time with lots of &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s estates&quot;. The house has strong window elements and is fairly &quot;French&quot; in its character. Its location was formerly adjacent to the Opawa Farm.

* The Hollies was built in 1871, it is an early colonial house built by English-born mechanic Edward Richardson. The land it was built on was originally part of the 50 acre Opawa Farm, the site of The Hollies was later sold to Mr. Richardson. Richardson was responsible for overseeing the completion of the Lyttelton rail tunnel. Richardson was born in England where he trained as a civil engineer before emigrating to Christchurch. At the farther end of the house, is a billiards room which overlooks the Ōpāwaho / Heathcote River. The Hollies is a Category 2 heritage-listed building.

* St. Mark&#x27;s Anglican Church is an Anglican church located on Opawa Road. Its foundation stone was laid in May 1865 by Bishop Selwyn, the first Primate of New Zealand and the first church itself was designed by English-born architects Benjamin Mountfort and Maxwell Bury. In December 1949, the church was largely burned by a fire. This severance with the church for many people was one of the few remaining links to Christchurch&#x27;s early European settlers. A new church was constructed on the same site and opened four years later in 1953.

* Another landmark in Opawa is the Fifield located on 14 Hawford Road. It is unclear what exact year the Fifield was built but it is understood to have been in the early 1880s. The building is historically significant for its connection with civil engineer William Bray and pharmacist William Townend and his family. It is a large two storey mid-Victorian villa, that contains a smoking room, a nursery, and a servants&#x27; quarters. After the 2010–2011 Canterbury earthquakes, the dwelling&#x27;s chimneys partially collapsed and were removed as a result.

<doc id="1030730" wikidata="Q2442055" url="?curid=1030730" title="X-Men (1992 video game)">
<text>is a side-scrolling beat &#x27;em up game produced and released by Konami for arcades in 1992, based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name. The in-game character designs are based on the 1989 cartoon &quot;X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men&quot;. In the game, up to six players control the X-Men to defeat their archenemy Magneto. The six-player version of the game utilizes two screens housed in a deluxe cabinet. It was one of the top five highest-grossing dedicated arcade games of 1992 in the United States, while the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA) nominated it for the &quot;most innovative new technology&quot; award.

An arcade exclusive for many years, a home version of the game developed by Backbone Entertainment was released by Konami digitally on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2010, followed by mobile versions for iOS and Android devices. This version is no longer available for purchase as of 2013.

==Plot==
The player chooses one of six X-Men: Cyclops, Colossus, Wolverine, Storm, Nightcrawler or Dazzler. Their objective is to stop the villain Magneto from wreaking havoc on human civilization. They must fight through enemies from the comics such as an army of hundreds of Sentinels, mutant crocodiles, Reavers and supervillains such as Pyro, Blob, Wendigo, Nimrod, The White Queen, Juggernaut, and Mystique. Later, Magneto kidnaps Professor X and Kitty Pryde, prompting the heroes to go on a rescue mission. The heroes fight their way to Island M and ultimately to Magneto&#x27;s base on Asteroid M where the final battle takes place.

==Gameplay==
The object of the game is to progress as far as possible while surviving attacks from Magneto and his minions. The character is controlled with a standard joystick, an attack button, a jump button, and a mutant power button. In addition to right and left, the character can move up and down the screen as well which adds a three-dimensional feel to the game. Every character is able to fight with punches, kicks, or other close combat attacks. Each character also has a unique mutant power which can be used to defeat multiple enemies on the screen at once. The use of a mutant power is very effective, but also costly since it causes a character to lose three health points. Normally, a character who drops below four health can no longer use any mutant powers, but it is also possible for characters to obtain bonus mutant powers which can be stored like items. In the Japanese version, the power items are used up before the health, and there are also power-ups and health packs throughout the levels.

== Release ==
Depending on the machine, the maximum number of simultaneous players varies from two to six. The six-player version is particularly unusual because it has two contiguous screens (one screen in the usual place for an arcade game, the other in the cabinet below, reflected by a mirror one side of the screen) which created the effect of a single, &quot;double-wide&quot; screen set up, similar to &quot;Tecmo Bowl&quot;.

&quot;X-Men&quot; was ported to PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade by Backbone Entertainment with the original US and Japanese ROMs and was released on December 14 and 15, 2010 respectively, published by Konami. The Xbox 360 and PS3 port features drop-in local or online multiplayer for up to six players (only four local players possible on the XBLA version), as well as custom matchmaking and adjustable difficulty. Players can also choose between the US and Japanese versions of the game, the latter of which features power-ups and health packs. All of the voices were re-recorded by Bang Zoom! Entertainment due to licensing reasons, but the script retained the infamous lines from the original game, including &quot;I am Magneto, master of magnet!&quot; and &quot;Welcome to die!&quot;. In the re-recorded script, only two voice actors were used for male and female characters (Kyle Hebert and Mela Lee, respectively).

The game was delisted from both digital stores at the end of 2013.

Konami also released the game in the iTunes App Store to be played on iOS devices in 2011, as well as in the Android Market. The game remained largely identical to the original, with the addition of on-screen controls for smartphones. Three years later, the app was no longer available in the US iTunes App Store.

In 2021, Arcade1Up released a special Marvel themed cabinet that includes &quot;X-Men&quot;, &quot;Captain America and the Avengers&quot; and &quot;Avengers in Galactic Storm&quot;.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;X-Men&quot; on August 15, 1992 as being both the third most-successful table arcade unit and the seventh most-successful upright arcade unit of the month. In the United States, &quot;X-Men&quot; was the top-grossing deluxe arcade cabinet on the &quot;RePlay&quot; charts for six months in 1992, from May through October. It was one of the top five highest-grossing dedicated arcade games of 1992 in the United States, according to the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA). At the 1992 AMOA Games Awards, it was nominated for the &quot;most played video game (dedicated)&quot; and &quot;most innovative new technology&quot; awards.

In &quot;Play Meter&quot; magazine, Jim Overman gave the arcade game a rating of 91% and a &quot;gut feeling&quot; score of 10 out of 10.

In 2004, &quot;X-Men&quot; was inducted into GameSpot&#x27;s list of the greatest games of all time. In 2013, Arcade Sushi ranked X-Men 3rd on their &quot;10 Best Retro Beat &#x27;Em Ups&quot;. Nerdist.com included the game in its &quot;Top Ten Most Iconic Marvel Video Games&quot;. In 2023, Time Extension included the game on their top 25 &quot;Best Beat &#x27;Em Ups of All Time&quot; list.

IGN gave the HD port of the game a score of 7.5, saying &quot;the game is incredibly simple and repetitive... And yet it works. It&#x27;s simply a blast to play with friends&quot;. Many websites and reviewers such as Gouki.com stated that having unlimited continues without penalty for all modes has cheapened the classic experience, especially online play. Sinclair User magazine gave X-Men a score of 58/100, noting the arcade game&#x27;s ability to have six players playing simultaneously, although stating &quot;big game, big sprites, but unless you are a big fan of the Marvel comic, probably not big fun&quot;.

<text>The Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT) was a computer-based standardized test administered to prospective pharmacy school students by Pearson Education, Inc as a service for the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP); it is offered in January, July, and September. The test is divided into five sections to be taken in approximately three and a half hours. The test includes Writing, Biology, Chemistry, Critical reading, and Quantitative Reasoning sections. The composite score is based on the multiple-choice sections, and can range from 200 – 600. There is no passing score; pharmacy schools set their own standards for acceptable scores. Calculators are not allowed during the testing period and no penalty is given for incorrect answers.

The test was retired effective January 10, 2024.

<doc id="1030756" wikidata="Q203409" url="?curid=1030756" title="Rioni">
<text>The Rioni (, ; , ) is the main river of western Georgia. It originates in the Caucasus Mountains, in the region of Racha and flows west to the Black Sea, entering it north of the city of Poti (near ancient Phasis). The city of Kutaisi, once the ancient city of Colchis, lies on its banks. It drains the western Transcaucasus into the Black Sea while the river Kura drains the eastern Transcaucasus into the Caspian Sea.

==History==
=== Ancient authors ===
Known to the ancient Greeks as the river &quot;Phasis&quot;, the Rioni was first mentioned by Hesiod in his Theogony (l.340); Plato has Socrates remark: &quot;I believe that the earth is very large and that we who dwell between the pillars of Hercules and the river Phasis live in a small part of it about the sea, like ants or frogs about a pond&quot; (&quot;Phaedo&quot;, 109a). Later writers like Apollonius Rhodius (Argonautica 2.12.61), Virgil (Georgics 4.367) and Aelius Aristides (&quot;Ad Romam&quot; 82) considered it the easternmost limit of the navigable seas. Herodotus and Anaximander considered Rioni a boundary between Europe and Asia. The famed voyage of Jason and the Argonauts, though semi-mythological, was said to have occurred by the Argonauts sailing up the river Phasis from its outlet to the Black Sea at Poti, to Colchis (modern Kutaisi in Georgia).

=== Pheasant ===
The term &quot;pheasant&quot; and the scientific name &quot;Phasianus colchicus&quot; are derived from &quot;Phasis&quot; and &quot;Colchis&quot;, as this was said to be the region from which the common pheasant was introduced to Europe (the ring-necked pheasants were introduced later from East Asia).

=== Draining ===
It is said that &quot;the failure of Colchis to emerge as a strong kingdom or to be maintained as a province of Rome has been blamed on the pestilential climate of the Phasis Valley, a situation remarked upon by travelers down to modern times, when the swamps were finally drained.&quot; Wetlands around Rioni River has been drained through a large reclamation-drainage project commissioned by government in 1960. After that, the area was cleared and converted to agricultural land.

== Description ==
The Rioni is the longest river wholly within the borders of Georgia. The river is long, and its drainage basin covers about . It starts on the southern slopes of the Caucasus Mountains at above sea level, north of the town of Oni. Its largest tributaries are, from source to mouth: Jejora (left), Qvirila (left), Khanistsqali (left), Tskhenistsqali (right) and Tekhuri (right).

==Phasis river at Taprobana==

Stephanus of Byzantium wrote that there was also another river which was named Phasis, in Taprobana () (Ceylon or Sri Lanka).

<text>The Ōpaoa River, formerly called the Opawa River, is in the Marlborough region of the South Island of New Zealand. It begins in the Wairau valley where floodways are joined. It makes its way down the valley and flows through and looping around the eastern suburbs of Blenheim where it is crossed by the Opawa River Bridge. It joins the Taylor River in Blenheim (keeping the Ōpaoa name) and flows into Big Lagoon, the estuary it shares with the southern mouth of the Wairau River at Cloudy Bay.

There are two possible sources for the river&#x27;s name. It might have been named after the chief Paoa. Rangitāne iwi say that the name Ōpaoa literally means smoky river. With Blenheim built on swampy land, the river was often brown (or &#x27;smoky&#x27;) as a consequence. In August 2014, the name of the river was officially altered to Ōpaoa River.

<doc id="1030779" wikidata="Q1592356" url="?curid=1030779" title="Hear 'n Aid">
<text>Hear &#x27;n Aid was a charity record released in 1986. The record featured a supergroup of 40 heavy metal musicians on a track called &quot;Stars&quot;. A music video was released as well, produced during the recording sessions. Proceeds from the album were used to raise over $3 million for famine relief in Africa.

The project was spearheaded by Ronnie James Dio, Jimmy Bain, and Vivian Campbell of the band Dio, who also contributed a live version of &quot;Hungry for Heaven&quot; to the album. The project also included contributions from Tommy Aldridge, Blue Öyster Cult, Dokken, Giuffria, Judas Priest, Mötley Crüe, Night Ranger, Ted Nugent, Queensrÿche, Quiet Riot, Rough Cutt, Twisted Sister, Vanilla Fudge, W.A.S.P. and Y&amp;T, as well as the parody band Spinal Tap, who performed in character.

==Recording==
In interview video footage taken during the event, Ronnie Dio said that while attending a 48-hour charity &quot;Radiothon&quot; for African famine relief at the radio station KLOS in Los Angeles, Bain and Campbell noticed that representation from hard rock and heavy metal stars was low. In light of the success of Band Aid&#x27;s &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; and USA for Africa&#x27;s &quot;We Are the World&quot;, they forwarded the idea of a similar project exclusively built around artists from the hard rock and heavy metal genres to Ronnie Dio, and together the three co-wrote &quot;Stars&quot;.

&quot;Stars&quot; was recorded on 20 and 21 May 1985 with the first session at Sound City Studios and the second session moving to A&amp;M Studios Studio A, where &quot;We Are The World&quot; was recorded. It was edited and mixed at Rumbo Recorders and mastered at Artisan Sound.

Lead vocals were shared between Ronnie James Dio, Rob Halford, Kevin DuBrow, Eric Bloom, Geoff Tate, Dave Meniketti, Don Dokken, and Paul Shortino. Vivian Campbell, Carlos Cavazo, Buck Dharma, Brad Gillis, Craig Goldy, George Lynch, Yngwie Malmsteen, Eddie Ojeda, and Neal Schon (whose Journey bandmate, Steve Perry, was part of &quot;We Are the World&quot;) all added guitar solos. Ronnie &amp; Wendy Dio received a commitment from Led Zeppelin&#x27;s Jimmy Page that he would do a guitar solo for &quot;Stars&quot; the day after Live Aid, as Led Zeppelins had reunited for the Philadelphia show. A recording session in Philadelphia was set up for July 14 (the day after Led Zeppelin performed) with staff donating their time for the recording. Without explanation, Page backed out of his original commitment.

Iron Maiden&#x27;s Dave Murray and Adrian Smith were in the middle of their &#x27;World Slavery Tour&#x27; at the time, and flew in to provide rhythm guitar lines for the main session, along with Campbell.

==Release and reception==
The single and album were originally intended to be released shortly after its recording, but contractual issues with the different artists&#x27; record labels delayed the release until New Year&#x27;s Day 1986, somewhat diminishing the impact of its release.

Along with &quot;Stars&quot;, the compilation album, titled &quot;Hear &#x27;n Aid&quot; (or alternatively appearing as &quot;Hear &#x27;n Aid (An All-Star Album For Famine Relief)&quot;)&quot;, included &quot;Go for the Throat&quot;, the B-side to Y&amp;T&#x27;s &quot;All American Boy&quot; single, and &quot;Can You See Me&quot; by The Jimi Hendrix Experience, as well as live tracks by Accept, Motörhead, Rush, Kiss, Dio and Scorpions.

The &quot;Stars&quot; single was released on vinyl in both 7&quot; and 12&quot; versions. Both included a 4:43 edit of the track, and a &quot;4 1/2 Minutes News&quot; interviews with musicians who participated in the project. The 12&quot; featured the original 7:04 version as well. The back of the record sleeve for the single had the following description:
The single &quot;Stars&quot; peaked at No. 26 in the UK Singles Chart in April 1986. The music video for &quot;Stars&quot; received moderate airplay on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Heavy Metal Mania&quot; and afterward on MTV&#x27;s replacement program &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;.

The project also released a 30 minute Sony home video documentary, &quot;Hear &#x27;n Aid: The Sessions&quot;, which was shot during the recording process and released on VHS and Video8 formats. The back cover for the documentary has the following description:

On 31 May 2004, VH1 premiered a five-night documentary special titled &quot;100 Most Metal Moments&quot;, narrated by Dee Snider. At the conclusion, &quot;Hear &#x27;n Aid&quot; was ranked as the &quot;No. 1 Most Metal Moment&quot;.

The following CD release info needs verification as Wendy Dio indicated as late as 2011 that it was only ever released on vinyl and cassette.

==Charts==
== The non-profit ==
Prior to the album release, and indicative of their business acumen and commitment to the project&#x27;s success, Ronnie Dio, Bain and Campbell established Hear &#x27;n Aid as a full fledged non-profit, presumably to avoid experiencing similar missteps and pitfalls encountered with previous African aid efforts. &quot;Hear ’n Aid had to be a non-profit organisation… We had to set up a board of directors, fourteen people, and all decisions had to be made by the board. My role was getting the licensing.&quot; - Wendy Dio

The Classic Rock article also indicates the project leadership and participants were well aware that the funds raised from similar events such as Band Aid were squandered due to governmental corruption as well as suffering from general disorganization which led to things such as &quot;food rotting on docks&quot; - Paul Shortino (vocalist for Rough Cutt). The funds raised through the Hear &#x27;n Aid project were instead used to purchase and ship agricultural machinery.

During the period of high popularity of MySpace, Ronnie James Dio&#x27;s profile contained an entry crediting the project with having raised $1 million within a year. In a 2017 article written for &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, Ronnie&#x27;s wife and manager, Wendy Dio, estimated the project&#x27;s total amount raised to be over $3 million.

==Re-issue and potential sequel==
Ronnie Dio planned on recording a second benefit single called &quot;Throw Away Children&quot; for &quot;Children of the Night&quot;, a charity that he was involved with that benefited runaway children. For various reasons, the project never materialized, and the song ended up appearing on the 2002 Dio album, &quot;Killing the Dragon&quot;. On 26 July 26 1986 some of the members of Hear &#x27;n Aid reunited to perform “Stars” as the encore for Dio’s concert at Southern California’s Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre.

On 2 November 2011, Dio&#x27;s widow Wendy announced that the song &quot;Stars&quot; would be re-released. She told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: “I’m going to re-release [Stars] because it only ever came out on vinyl and cassette. So it’ll come out on DVD and CD, I have loads of outtakes for the video”.

On 30 March 2015, Wendy Dio spoke with Eddie Trunk on his SiriusXM satellite radio show Eddie Trunk Live. &quot;We are in talks right now with a couple of record labels to reissue HEAR &#x27;N AID, with the funds going to [the Ronnie James Dio] Stand Up And Shout [Cancer Fund, the charity founded in memory of the late singer]&quot;. &quot;We have so much stuff that was never released before — behind-the-scenes stuff that was shot during the whole time. We have photos galore of everybody that was involved in it, and I think it&#x27;ll be fantastic. We just have to work on it. It may not come out this year, because I want everything to be perfect, as Ronnie would want it to be, but I am in talks about it, and that will be coming out, definitely.&quot;

In April 2015, Wendy Dio confirmed that a modern-day version of Hear &#x27;n Aid was in the works to record a &quot;new song&quot; and released alongside the upcoming reissue of &quot;Stars&quot;. She had stated that &quot;legal stuff&quot; was the cause of the reissue delay.

<text>Kaffir Boy: The True Story of a Black Youth&#x27;s Coming of Age in Apartheid South Africa is Mark Mathabane&#x27;s 1986 autobiography about life under the South African apartheid regime. It focuses on the brutality of the apartheid system and how he escaped from it, and from the township Alexandra, to become a well-known tennis player.
He also depicted how the young black children dealt with racism and stereotypes. By embracing education, he is able to rise out of despair and destitution.

==Plot summary==

At his mother&#x27;s insistence, Mathabane starts school and learns to love it, rising to the top of his class in spite of frequent punishments due to his family&#x27;s late payments for school fees and inability to afford school supplies. He graduates from primary school with a scholarship that will pay for his secondary education.

Mathabane&#x27;s grandmother becomes a gardener for a liberal white English family, the Smiths, who give Mathabane second hand comic books, novels and tennis equipment. His English improves greatly through reading these materials, and he begins to play tennis frequently. Mathabane eventually befriends a coloured tennis coach who trains him.

Mathabane joins the high school tennis team and begins to play in tournaments, unofficially sponsored by Wilfred Horn, owner of the Tennis Ranch. It is technically illegal for Mark to play there, but the law is ignored and he becomes more comfortable with whites who frequent the Tennis Ranch. Eventually renowned tennis player Stan Smith takes Mathabane under his wing when the two meet at a tournament. Stan pays for Mathabane to compete in tournaments and talks to his coach at the University of Southern California about Mathabane attending college in the United States. The coach writes to colleges on his behalf, and Mathabane earns a tennis scholarship to Limestone College and leaves for the U.S. in 1978.

==Characters and important people==
* Arthur Ashe – A black American tennis player who wins the Wimbledon tournament. His game play encourages Mathabane to become a tennis player.
* Mark Mathabane – The author and narrator of the book
*The Smiths – The white family who introduced Mathabane to comic books and tennis.
*Wilfred Horn – Owner of exclusive Tennis Ranch and unofficial sponsor of Mathabane.
* Stan Smith – Renowned tennis player who relocates Mathabane to the United States by finding a college who is willing to give the author a tennis scholarship.
* [Abe &#x27;Scara&#x27; Thomas] - Was like a father to Mark. He introduced him to tennis, gave him his first tennis racquet and mentored/coached him until he got the scholarship to the USA. He introduced Mark to different people who were prominent in the tennis circle. Abe Thomas loved Marvel comic books and collected them.

==Controversy==
&quot;Kaffir Boy&quot; has been banned in a number of schools, one of these being Cedar Crest High School, where the ban made headlines. The bans are due to a controversial scene involving child prostitution of young boys, which some have referred to as &quot;pornography,&quot; sparking another headline defending the scene. While Mathabane wrote an article for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stating that he would prefer it to be banned completely to being revised or censored, Mathabane has since authorized a revised version for use in such schools. The unrevised book is still used as high school reading material regardless of the controversial scenes.

==Reception and awards==
The book &quot;Kaffir Boy&quot; has won the prestigious Christopher Award for inspiring hope. The book reached number one on the Washington Post Bestseller&#x27;s List and number three on the New York Times Bestseller&#x27;s List. It has also been chosen by the American Library Association for inclusion on the list of &quot;Outstanding Books for the College-Bound and Life-Long Learners.&quot;

<doc id="1030796" wikidata="Q961810" url="?curid=1030796" title="The Chariot (band)">
<text>The Chariot was an American hardcore punk band from Douglasville, Georgia, that existed from 2003 to 2013. The last lineup consisted of drummer David Kennedy, vocalist and bandleader Josh Scogin, and guitarists Brandon Henderson and Stephen Harrison. The band experienced frequent lineup changes since its inception, with Scogin being the only original member. The band played an abrasive style of metalcore that did not adhere to typical stylings popular among their contemporaries such as melodic/abrasive dynamics and harmonic vocals. They built a reputation around their powerful live performances, with Scogin&#x27;s lyrics covering topics like materialism, personal struggle, current events, politics, and Christian themes.

The band was formed by Scogin shortly after he left his position of vocalist in Norma Jean. In 2004, a record deal was signed with Solid State Records and a debut album was released, titled &quot;Everything Is Alive, Everything Is Breathing, Nothing Is Dead, and Nothing Is Bleeding&quot;. The band toured constantly after that. The Chariot released the Unsung EP in 2005, which was then followed by three successful studio albums: &quot;The Fiancée&quot; in 2007, &quot;Wars and Rumors of Wars&quot; in 2009, and &quot;Long Live&quot; in 2010. The band entered the studio in May 2012 to record their fifth full-length album titled &quot;One Wing&quot; which was released August 28, 2012. The Chariot disbanded following a farewell tour in late 2013.

==Biography==

===2003–2004: Formation and debut album===
The Chariot was formed by Josh Scogin almost immediately after leaving his previous band Norma Jean, a metalcore group based in Douglasville, Georgia. He recorded one album with them titled &quot;Bless the Martyr and Kiss the Child&quot; in 2002. Later that year, following Norma Jean&#x27;s set at &quot;Furnace Fest&quot;, Scogin shocked the audience and his unaware bandmates by announcing his departure. Scogin stated that his departure was not the result of internal conflict, but a personal choice. The event generated a public outcry from fans in hardcore circles. Scogin returned to Douglasville in 2003 and started the Chariot with other musicians in the area; the first lineup included guitarists Keller Harbin and Tony &quot;Taco&quot; Medina, bassist Joshua Beiser, and drummer Jeff Carter. The band&#x27;s name was inspired by the Biblical story of Elijah and the chariot of fire.

In 2004, a record contract was signed with Solid State Records, a metal subdivision of Tooth &amp; Nail Records and their first recorded song titled &quot;It Is Usually the Boys Who Cry Wolf That Grow up to Be the Men Who Cry Sanctuary&quot; was released on the compilation &quot;This Is Solid State, Volume 5&quot;. This song was later re-recorded as &quot;Yellow Dress, Locked Knees&quot; on their debut. The band traveled to Atlanta, Georgia and worked on their debut album with Matt Goldman. The entire album was recorded live. The album was released in November and titled &quot;Everything Is Alive, Everything Is Breathing, Nothing Is Dead, and Nothing Is Bleeding&quot;, a parody of albums that featured morbid names. The album debuted at No. 23 on Top Heatseekers, and received favorable reviews from critics. Touring followed with As Cities Burn, He Is Legend, Far-less and Showbread on the &quot;Young Bloods Tour&quot; in Winter.

===2005–2008: &quot;The Fiancée&quot;===
Medina and Carter left the band soon after; they were replaced by Brian Khounvichit and Mark Nicks respectively. Carter went on to form the progressive death metal band, Deus Invictus. Nicks was later replaced by drummer Jake Ryan. In September 2005, The Chariot began a 27-city tour at Poughkeepsie, New York with High on Fire, Every Time I Die, and The Red Chord. An EP, titled Unsung, was released at the beginning of December. It featured two new tracks and four re-recordings from their debut and was well received among critics. The band played shows with labelmates As Cities Burn, mewithoutYou, and Underoath later that month. Touring continued through 2006 as the band shared a national tour with P.O.D. in spring and garnered a spot in the &quot;Sounds of the Underground Tour&quot; with As I Lay Dying that summer. In June 2006, Beiser and Harbin stepped down and were replaced by bassist Dan Eaton and guitarist Jon Terry respectively. The two men had been longtime friends of the band.

The Chariot embarked on the &quot;Youngbloods II Tour&quot; in fall with Solid State labelmates August Burns Red, Destroy The Runner, and Inhale Exhale. In January 2007, the band toured through Europe with Becoming the Archetype, and Shaped by Fate. By this time, yet another bass player had been recruited—Jon &quot;KC Wolf&quot; Kindler. In April of the same year, after delays relating to lineup changes, their second album, &quot;The Fiancée&quot;, was released. The record was produced by Matt Goldman. The writing and recording process had been driven by time constraints. &quot;It was actually a very easy record to write,&quot; said Scogin, &quot;It came more naturally to us.&quot; However, Scogin waited until the music was written before writing lyrics, an exercise he vowed never to attempt again. Hayley Williams of Paramore made a guest performance on the track &quot;Then Came To Kill&quot; as did Aaron Weiss of mewithoutYou when he played the harmonica on &quot;Forgive Me Nashville&quot;; Scogin had been friends with both artists for many years. &quot;The Fiancée&quot; broke the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200—it debuted at No. 169, selling 6,800 copies— and was well received in the Christian and secular markets. The group played a release tour with Misery Signals, I Am Ghost, and I Hate Sally, and then made a short run on the &quot;Warped Tour&quot; in summer. Another leg of &quot;The Fiancée Tour&quot; extended into spring 2008 with LoveHateHero, Alesana, Our Last Night, and Sky Eats Airplane. The lineup underwent another drastic change in mid-2008, as Jake Ryan, Dan Eaton and Jon Terry all decided to step down. Ryan and Eaton went on to form the indie pop band Queens Club and were signed to Tooth &amp; Nail Records.

===2009–2010: &quot;Wars and Rumors of Wars&quot;===
The group&#x27;s third album, titled &quot;Wars and Rumors of Wars&quot;, was released in May 2009. The lineup changed once again, leaving Scogin as the only member to appear on their first two releases. The album title was inspired by Matthew 24:6, which contains the passage &quot;You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars...&quot; Scogin explained that the album title referred to internal conflict that people experience, not literal war. The band hand-made the artwork and liner notes for the first 25,000 copies of the album. &quot;Wars and Rumors of War&quot; debuted at No. 112 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, their highest to date. Critical reception was very positive about the release. The Chariot performed on the &quot;Scream the Prayer Tour&quot; with Haste the Day, Sleeping Giant, Oh, Sleeper, and Project 86 that summer. Beginning late November, The Chariot and a group of hand picked artists, including Horse the Band supported Norma Jean who headlined the nationwide &quot;Explosions 2009 Tour&quot;.

===2010: &quot;Long Live&quot;===
The Chariot released their fourth studio album &quot;Long Live&quot; through Good Fight on November 22, 2010. The album was produced with Matt Goldman.

===2012–2013: &quot;One Wing&quot; and final tour===

The band announced via Twitter that they were entering the studio in May to record their next album. The album is called &quot;One Wing&quot;, and was released August 28, 2012. In June 2012, longtime bassist Jon (KC Wolf) Kindler left the band to return to college. The band opted not to replace Kindler, continuing as a four-piece. The bass on &quot;One Wing&quot; has been recorded by both Henderson and Harrison. A track from the album, &quot;In,&quot; premiered on Alternative Press on August 16.

The Chariot had their final tour in October/November 2013 with Glass Cloud, Rebuker, Birds in Row and To the Wind.

Josh moved on to form the band &#x27;68. Stephen Harrison became the guitarist of The Fever 333, a supergroup formed by Jason Aalon Butler two months after the disbanding of his former band letlive. 
In 2018, David Kennedy joined former The Chariot members, Bryan Taylor and Jon Terrey, forming The Threats.

In 2020, Scogin stated that The Chariot would never reunite in a preplanned way; specifically mentioning that he would rather spontaneously perform with the band members again than plan the event. He also stated that nostalgia needed to remain in the past, rather than always focusing on his prior projects, being present with whatever project he is involved in.

==Musical style and influences==

The band&#x27;s music is characterized by a metal sound, and the screamed vocals of frontman Josh Scogin. Journalists have frequently referred to the music as &quot;chaotic&quot;; Allmusic writer Alex Henderson described it as a &quot;dense, clobbering sledgehammer&quot;, while Brian Shultz of &quot;Alternative Press&quot; called it &quot;manically pounding, distortion-soaked exercises of catharsis&quot;. The Chariot has often been labeled a metalcore band. However, the music generally defies genre standards like melodic/abrasive dynamics and harmonizing vocals; it wouldn&#x27;t leave room for the &quot;nonstop firestorm of exploding drums, heaving guitars, and visceral shrieking,&quot; as Allmusic writer Corey Apar put it. The band utilizes time changes and start-stop shifts, and typically write very short songs. Some journalists believe the music is challenging and an acquired taste. In interviews, Josh Scogin has described the band as &quot;heavy punk rock&quot;, doing away with genres and subgenres, and has also debunked many of these labels. &quot;Sometimes people refer to us as mathcore, which I think is a very incorrect statement, because I feel like that&#x27;s a very pre-calculated, &#x27;this is weird because this time signature doesn&#x27;t go with this time…&#x27;. It&#x27;s very planned out. We&#x27;re not that smart.&quot;

Live performances are very important to the band. &quot;We love playing live,&quot; said Scogin, &quot;That&#x27;s what this band are all about: playing live shows.&quot; This mentality leaked into their recording process: the band&#x27;s first album was recorded entirely live in one take. Their next two efforts followed more traditional recording sensibilities: &quot;We may go in and [fix] this one part,&quot; explained Scogin, &quot;but [...] there&#x27;s lots of stuff we probably should have tightened up. [Laughs.] But that [keeps] it feeling like a real record.&quot; Despite their attentiveness to the recording process, Scogin has maintained that their focal point is live performances, &quot;...recording records, that&#x27;s all circled around hopefully bringing more kids to the live show so we can perform for them.&quot; The band&#x27;s shows have built up a reputation; MTV called them &quot;the thing of metalcore legend&quot;. When tasked to describe their set on the &quot;Scream the Prayer Tour&quot; in &quot;HM Magazine&quot;, Corey Erb wrote:


Artists who possessed strong showmanship skills have largely influenced Scogin; some of these artists include James Brown, Frank Sinatra, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Elvis Presley. He is also fond of Arcade Fire, The Beatles, Björk, Interpol, and The Killers. In an interview, Scogin expressed a desire to have seen At The Drive-In and Nirvana before they disbanded.

Scogin&#x27;s introspective lyrics have covered topics like materialism, death, and the Nashville Christian music industry. The lyrics for &quot;Wars and Rumors of Wars&quot; were formed after a family loss: &quot;...only a year ago my father passed away. And I hate to say this, because it sounds like such a band-dude thing to say, but the lyrics are a lot darker than any other record just because of how personal they are for me.&quot; Scogin usually refers to his lyrics as poems and has maintained that &quot;a song is never finished but abandoned.&quot; &quot;...as an artist you can forever be changing a song or making a song &#x27;better&#x27; or whatever but the moment that you stop recording and send it off to be mastered you have not &#x27;finished&#x27; the song…you have only abandoned the song and that is how it will stay forever.&quot; His lyrics sometimes espouse Christian themes and beliefs, albeit subtly. For example, the track &quot;Yellow Dress: Locked Knees&quot; from &quot;Everything...&quot; contains the Spanish lyrics &quot;Jesus, yo quiero que este mundo te conozca.&quot;; when translated, it says &quot;Jesus, I want this world to know You.&quot; The song &quot;And Shot Each Other&quot; from &quot;The Fiancée&quot; fades out into a Sacred Harp choir singing the song &#x27;Child of Grace&#x27;, which features the lyrics &quot;How happy is a child of grace, who feels his sins forgiven / This world, he cries, is not my place / I seek a place in Heaven.&quot;

The Chariot is frequently called a Christian band, which Scogin agreed with in a 2005 interview: &quot;We are Christians in a band therefore we are a Christian band. We are not ashamed of our beliefs but we don&#x27;t force feed people what we believe either.&quot; In 2006, he reaffirmed his previous statements and further opined, &quot;When I was growing up, if I liked [a band], I listened to it — and I went to the shows. If I didn&#x27;t, I didn&#x27;t. It wasn&#x27;t like, &#x27;Oh, they don&#x27;t believe the same thing I do,&#x27; [...] People care too much about the fashion of it all. To me, a band&#x27;s either good or they ain&#x27;t, and that&#x27;s the only thing that should matter.&quot;

<text>John Brown University (JBU) is a private interdenominational Christian university in Siloam Springs, Arkansas. Founded in 1919, JBU enrolls 2,343 students from 33 states and 45 countries in its traditional undergraduate, graduate, online, and concurrent education programs. JBU is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and competes athletically in the Sooner Athletic Conference.

The main campus in northwest Arkansas has been the site of the university since it was founded in 1919. JBU has 2,343 students as of the 2021–2022 school year, 1,228 of whom are on-campus undergraduates. Of these, 818 live on campus. In addition, the university has two off-campus locations, one in Rogers and another Little Rock.

==History==

===John E. Brown: background===
John E. Brown (1879–1957) was not afforded the opportunity to pursue much education, as his family&#x27;s financial difficulties forced him to begin working at the age of 11. As a teenaged laborer in Arkansas, Brown encountered the Salvation Army and underwent a conversion experience. After his conversion, he became an itinerant Methodist evangelist, with his travels taking him across Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas and the Indian Territory.

Subsequent to becoming an evangelist, Brown accepted a position as president of Scarritt College in Neosho. His two years as president were instrumental in developing his plan to establish his own college. However, Brown felt that the strong emphasis of that school on education without the benefit of life training was harmful to the students. As he said in 1903, &quot;It might be my privilege to have a part in the building of school that would turn the minds of youth back from this exaggerated concept of the value of book knowledge, to the realization that all this is valuable only as it becomes a background for, or the foundation under, the real things of life.&quot;

===Early years: presidency of John E. Brown Sr. 1919–1948===
Maintaining this goal of establishing a college that would provide an interdenominational, Christian education for needy students, who like himself, might not have had a chance of receiving an education, Brown laid the foundation in 1919 for the institution that would later be called John Brown University, John E. Brown College. To pay for the institution&#x27;s free tuition, Brown developed his school as a Christian vocational college. Students worked jobs such as carpentry and helped in constructing the buildings on campus. The typical work-day was four hours in addition to class time.

Apparently seeking to expand the reach of the growing college, John Brown announced in 1934 that the school was to be changed into a four-year university. The new university was divided into three colleges: the academic, vocational, and Bible colleges, fitting John Brown&#x27;s stated vision of educating &quot;head, heart, and hand&quot;. Spreading the new university&#x27;s fields of study into new technology, Brown soon purchased a local radio station (KUOA) from which to broadcast Christian programming and his own sermons. Brown had used radio extensively before but was eager to get the resources of radio into the hands of the university. The expanded facilities, such as the distinctive Cathedral Group, which took root in the 1930s and 1940s, caused expenses for which the university had to pay. JBU began charging tuition in 1939, albeit a very small amount, and John Brown began to realize that financially, the vocational aspect of the school was more costly than anticipated. The university relied heavily on outside donations to break even financially.

===Shift away from fundamentalism===
As the university grew, Brown continued to preach throughout the country and on the radio. He was well known for his attacks on liquor, gambling, dancing, and other Christian fundamentalist issues of the time. This brought him into close proximity with Bob Jones Sr. founder of Bob Jones University, who presented Brown with an honorary doctorate in 1937.

In the 1940s, the close ties between JBU and the Christian fundamentalist movement began to wane, as the university took an unexpected turn away from fundamentalism. John Brown himself was always a proponent of interdenominationalism, and by aligning himself with Youth for Christ and other evangelical organizations after World War II, JBU was making a statement. John Brown&#x27;s description of the school in 1948 as &quot;interdenominational and definitely evangelical&quot; is very telling in this regard.

===Presidency of John E. Brown Jr. 1948–1979===
When John Brown Sr. relinquished control of the university (at least in name, since he remained as chairman of the board) in 1948, he began a period of much-needed consolidation. During World War II the student body had dropped to barely over a hundred, and the high echelons of the school&#x27;s leadership were being run almost exclusively by the Brown family. Under the second Brown, professors and administrators were hired who had more advanced degrees, the Board of Trustees began to develop as a more independent body, and the students elected representatives to an independent council. All of this was beginning to occur by the end of the 1940s. Also, the university began construction on its Cathedral Group, composed of the chapel sanctuary, known as the Cathedral of the Ozarks, the Science building, and the Library, supposedly symbolizing in building form the idea of educating &quot;head, heart, and hand&quot;. As much as JBU grew during this period, it still lacked accreditation and its student body continued to hover at around 300 during the 1950s. After the founder&#x27;s death in 1957, John Brown Jr. worked to improve the quality of the education JBU provided. One crucial step was the abolition of the university&#x27;s vocational college. Citing the shifting makeup of the workforce in the 1960s, the president did away with the vocational requirement, with the understanding that each department would provide practical career training as part of its curriculum. As a result of these reforms and others, JBU was finally nationally accredited by North Central Association.

During the turbulent years of the Vietnam War and the peace movement, JBU was relatively undisturbed. The school nurtured at that time a strong Christian Americanist vision of the world, tying American patriotism and political conservatism to conservative Christian faith. Instead of joining the anti-war movement, many JBU students joined organizations like Campus Crusade for Christ and traveled to other campuses. When those turbulent times had come and gone, JBU faced the 1970s with uncertainty. Academic standards were low and classes were not challenging. The university recognized the need to improve its quality, so it brought in Elton Trueblood, professor of philosophy at Earlham College, who had written &quot;The Idea of A College&quot; which argued that colleges should focus on liberal arts over career preparation. Trueblood&#x27;s visits in the mid-1970s inspired JBU to look for ideas in Arthur F. Holmes&#x27; &quot;Idea of a Christian College&quot; in which a Christian college seeks to integrate faith and learning.

===Presidency of John E. Brown III 1979–1993===
When John Brown Jr. stepped down as president, the job fell to his son, John Brown III, who immediately sought to improve the academic quality of the university. He visited Wheaton College (Illinois) and heralded its commitment to an integration of academic quality and Christian faith. To accompany his praise of Wheaton, he announced that the first consideration of JBU in selecting prospective students would be academic quality, and raising the entrance requirements. As expected, this began to attract more academically gifted students. Also, in the 1980s, an Honors Program was established. However, the third Brown made sure to maintain JBU&#x27;s historic emphasis on career training, through its non-liberal arts programs such as Engineering, Construction Management, and Graphic Design. As well as academic programs, John Brown III instituted new building programs and a scholarship for Latin American students paid for by Sam Walton.

===Presidency of George F. Ford 1993–1994===
John Brown III stepped down as president and was succeeded by George Ford, former Vice President of Roberts Wesleyan College, who left after less than a year because of internal difficulties with the university. During Ford&#x27;s brief presidency, the university began offering an undergraduate degree completion program (&quot;The Advance Program&quot;) in various locations in Northwest Arkansas.

===Presidency of Lee Balzer 1994–2004===
The former president of Tabor College in Kansas, Lee Balzer, took office after the Ford controversy with a plan to expand the university&#x27;s reach. He extended the Advance Program for non-traditional students in other cities by establishing branch centers in Fort Smith, Arkansas and Little Rock, Arkansas. During his presidency, JBU offered its first graduate degrees, initially in school counseling, and later including master&#x27;s degrees in marriage and family therapy, leadership and ethics, business (MBA) and Christian ministry. The Center for Marriage and Family Studies was established during the Balzer presidency. Under President Balzer, JBU also founded the Soderquist Center for Business Leadership and Ethics to promote ethical principles in the business world. In addition, JBU&#x27;s financial campaign at the end of the 1990s raised more than 39 million dollars to build Walker Student Center, Bell Science Hall, North Hall, and the Soderquist Business Center, all in the span of barely more than five years.

===Presidency of Charles Pollard 2004–present===
In 2004, Balzer retired. JBU selected Charles (Chip) Pollard, then Professor of English at Calvin College, to take the office of president for the institution. Since taking office, Pollard has overseen an interior and exterior renovation of the Cathedral Group, the expansion of North Hall, growth in the student body to over 2,000 students, and general consolidation after the rapid expansion of the past decade. Pollard&#x27;s most notable legacy will likely be his extremely successful expansion of the JBU endowment, upgrade of the facilities and successfully growing the school&#x27;s enrollment. Under the leadership of Pollard, JBU has seen significant growth through a number of sizable financial gifts. Graduate programs expanded to include the Master of Arts in Teaching, Master of Education, and M.S./MBA in Cybersecurity.

It was announced in early 2010, after receipt of an $8 million anonymous donation, that JBU would construct a new engineering and construction management building. The building was completed in 2011 and named the Balzer Technology Building in honor of the school&#x27;s former president. Later that year, a JBU engineering student turned successful alumnus and businessman, Bill Berry, provided the financial gift for the Berry Performing Arts Center which was completed in 2011. In 2012, it was announced that the Simmons family, owners of the privately held Simmons Foods located in Siloam Springs, would make a financial gift providing JBU with a new dining and gathering facility. The Simmons Great Hall was completed in mid-2013. The Health Education Building that houses the nursing department was completed in 2016.

==Lifestyle standards==
In the tradition of some other private Christian universities, John Brown University maintains a conservative set of lifestyle choices. Students sign a community covenant stating they will abstain from profanity, pornography, extramarital sexual activity, harassment, tobacco use, alcohol use, and gambling. The covenant also strictly prohibits LGBTQIA+ relationships on campus. Staff and faculty are not required to sign this covenant but must sign a statement of faith and employee expectations which include that &quot;Scripture teaches that sexual intimacy is reserved for marriage and that a Christian marriage is a lifelong commitment between one man and one woman &quot;

John Brown University made national news when it changed its historically held position not to endorse dancing. In December 2006, the school sponsored its own swing-themed dance on campus.

JBU made national news in early 2013 as it became famous for its yearly toilet paper basketball game. ESPN did a special highlighting &quot;the greatest technical foul in all of sports.&quot;

==Campus==
John Brown University&#x27;s main campus is located on in Siloam Springs, Arkansas. The university&#x27;s most recognizable building, the Cathedral of the Ozarks, was completed in 1957 and, along with the two Windgate Visual Art Buildings composes the Cathedral group. The Cathedral contains a sanctuary for chapel and other assemblies, and the back portion is a three-floor academic building housing the music department and the humanities and social sciences. The entire Cathedral group was recently renovated on the inside and resurfaced with white limestone on the exterior.

Between the Cathedral group and Walker Student Center is the campus&#x27;s main quad, which is used for recreation and relaxation by students. The student center itself houses a cafe, an open area for studying, bookstore, post office, and classrooms on the second floor. Attached to the student center is the Walker co-ed residence hall with male and female residents living on separate floors. There are three other residence halls on campus as well: J. Alvin Brown, an all-male dormitory and the oldest building on campus which was given a $6 million renovation in 2014; Mayfield, an all-female hall completing a $6 million renovation in 2018, and Hutcheson, a co-ed residence hall. Upperclassman and non-traditional student housing options include campus townhouses and the Northslope Apartments.

Other buildings on campus are the Bill George Arena, Soderquist Business Center, Bell Science Hall, Mabee Learning Resource Center, Chapman Administrative Building, Blood Memorial (Admissions) Building, Berry Performing Arts Center, Balzer Technology Center, CARE Clinic, Simmons Great Hall, Health Education Building, Peer-Andrus Studio &amp; Project Barn and the Walton Lifetime Health Complex.

==Academics==

John Brown University currently offers 50+ undergraduate majors, with the most popular as of 2022-23 being Nursing, Psychology, Family and Human Service, Kinesiology and Graphic Design - 65. As a liberal arts college, JBU requires all students to take a core curriculum of classes, which include several Bible classes, English, a foreign language requirement, science credit, the history of Western civilization, a math requirement, wellness, psychology, government, and philosophy. In the period from 2003 to 2012, JBU rose from eighth to first in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings for the Baccalaureate Colleges in the Southern region. In 2016, due to growth in graduate programs, the university was moved to the Regional Universities in the Southern region category of U.S. News. In 2022, JBU ranked number ten on this list. JBU&#x27;s Business department won first and second place at the Arkansas Governor&#x27;s Cup Business Plan competition in 2007 and then in 2011 swept the Governor&#x27;s Cup, receiving first, second, and third. In 2017, the JBU Enactus team won the U.S. National Championships and represented the U.S. at the Enactus World Cup in London. Its student newspaper, the Threefold Advocate, was named the best student newspaper in Arkansas in 2008 and 2010. The University Honors Program has 200 student members and is designed to allow students to take Honors versions of the necessary core classes, which are supposed to be more challenging and more encouraging of independent student research. The libraries on campus house 120,000 volumes, and offer Interlibrary loan and tutoring assistance.

===Associated centers===
John Brown University has two endowed, associated centers: The Center for Healthy Relationships and The Center for Faith and Flourishing.

==Athletics==
The John Brown (JBU) athletic teams are called the Golden Eagles. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Sooner Athletic Conference (SAC) since the 1995–96 academic year; which they were a member on a previous stint from 1980–81 to 1982–83. The Golden Eagles previously competed in the Arkansas Intercollegiate Conference (AIC) from 1993–94 to 1994–95; and as an NAIA Independent from 1983–84 to 1992–93.

JBU competes in 11 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, tennis and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

===Basketball===
On March 22, 2005, the JBU men&#x27;s basketball team won the 2005 NAIA Division I National Championship. John Brown defeated Azusa Pacific University 65–55 at Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City, Missouri. Each year during the first home game, JBU basketball fans come armed with rolls...and rolls...of toilet paper, which they hurl onto the court after the first JBU basket of the season. This 34-year-old tradition brings in record crowds with approximately 2,000 rolls of toilet paper and lands JBU an automatic technical foul for the season.

===Golf===
The JBU varsity men&#x27;s golf team was originally formed in 1966. The team lasted until 1973, at which time it was cut from the athletic program. The school restarted its men&#x27;s varsity golf team in the fall of 2008 and remained intact until 2016.

===Cheerleading===
JBU began a cheer squad in the fall of 2010. JBU had cheerleading many years ago, but it only counted as a club then.

===Club teams and intramurals===
The university has club rugby, ultimate frisbee and esports teams for both men and women. The JBU Talons men&#x27;s club baseball team began play in 2021. These clubs compete against clubs from other universities. To house its club teams, JBU has a rugby pitch and on campus. JBU also has a club ultimate frisbee team. JBU students also participate in a number of intramural sports, from soccer to volleyball to flag football to dodgeball. Many of these events take place on the intramural fields or in the Walton Lifetime Health Complex.

<text>Aerfer was an Italian manufacturing company created in 1955 by the merger of IMAM and Officine Ferroviarie Meridionali. The name is a contraction of &quot;Costruzioni Aeronautiche e Ferroviarie&quot; (Aeronautical and Railway Constructions).

In 1969 it merged with Salmoiraghi and the aviation division of Fiat to create Aeritalia.

The firm is remembered mostly in connection with the development of Italy&#x27;s first supersonic jet, the Aerfer Sagittario 2.

<text>The Choctaw language (Choctaw: ), spoken by the Choctaw, an Indigenous people of the Southeastern Woodlands, US, is a member of the Muskogean language family. Chickasaw is a separate but closely related language to Choctaw.

The Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma published the &quot;New Choctaw dictionary&quot; in 2016.

==Dialects==
There are three dialects of Choctaw (Mithun 1999):

# &quot;Native&quot; Choctaw on the Choctaw Nation in southeastern Oklahoma
# Mississippi Choctaw of Oklahoma on Chickasaw Nation of south-central Oklahoma (near Durwood)
# Choctaw of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians near Philadelphia, Mississippi

Other speakers live near Tallahassee, Florida, and with the Koasati in Louisiana, and also a few speakers live in Texas and California.

==Phonology==
* More information on suffixes is in the Morphology section.

===Consonants===
# The only voiced stop is . The voiceless stops , , and may become partially voiced between vowels, especially and for male speakers. Also, the voiceless stops are slightly aspirated at the onset of words and before stressed syllables, behaving like English voiceless plosives.
# Controversially, some analyses suggest that all nouns end in an underlying consonant phoneme. Nouns apparently ending in a vowel actually have a glottal stop or a glottal fricative as the final consonant. Such consonants become realized when suffixes are attached.
# The distinction between phonemes and is neutralized at the end of words.

====Free variation====
* There is free variation of some consonants in Choctaw with some speakers:
# /ɬ/, the voiceless lateral fricative, is pronounced as a voiceless dental fricative [θ]: →.
# The voiceless labiodental fricative /f/ is pronounced as a voiceless bilabial fricative [ɸ]: →.

====Phonological processes of consonants====
* In Choctaw , the voiceless velar plosive, is often pronounced as , a voiced velar fricative, between vowels.
: →/V_V
: imofi-aki-lih→imofiy-əɣə̃꞉-lih

* The voiceless glottal fricative is often pronounced like a voiceless palatal fricative when it precedes the voiceless palato-alveolar affricate .
: →/_
: katihchish→katiçtʃiʃ

===Vowels===
# Lax vowels occur more often in closed syllables. In traditional orthography, &quot;ʋ&quot; usually indicates and &quot;u&quot; usually indicates . Exceptions include &quot;pokoli&quot; (&quot;traditional&quot;) for , &quot;imalakusi&quot; for . The traditional orthography does not distinguish lax and tense front vowels; instead it indicates with &quot;e&quot;.
# Nasal vowels are intrinsically long.

====Pitch====
# In Choctaw, very few words are distinguished only by pitch accent. Nouns in Choctaw have pitch realization at the penultimate syllable or the ultimate syllable. Verbs in Choctaw will have pitch realization at morphemes indicating tense, but sometimes, pitch directly precedes the tense morpheme.

===Syllable structure===
# As is in the chart above, there are three syllable structure types in Choctaw: light, heavy, and super heavy. Possible syllables in Choctaw must contain at least one vowel of any quality.
# Syllables cannot end with a consonant clusters CC. However, there is an exception with the structure *(C)VCC if a word in Choctaw ends with the suffix /-t/.
# Syllables do not begin with consonant clusters CC, but there is an exception in an initial /i-/ deletion, which results in a syllable *CCV .

====Rhythmic lengthening====
* Rhythmic lengthening is the process of lengthening the vowel duration of an even-numbered CV syllable in Choctaw. However, vowels at the end of words are not permitted to undergo that process. Also, if an even-numbered syllable is a verbal prefixes class I or III, the affix&#x27;s vowel may not undergo lengthening, and the same holds true for noun prefixes class III as well.
: CV-CV-CVC→CV-CV꞉-CVC
:salahatok→sala꞉hatok

====Smallest possible word====
* The smallest possible word in Choctaw must contain either two short vowels or one long vowel.
: a꞉t

* /a-/ insertion: there are verbs with only one short vowel in their roots. Without an affix attached to the verb root, the verbs become impossible utterances because Choctaw requires either two short vowels or a long vowel for a word to be formed. An initial A-prefix is thus attached to the root of the verb.
: *bih → a-bih

===Phonological processes===
====Glide insertion====
* When a verb root ends with a long vowel, a glide /w/ or /j/ is inserted after the long vowel.
* ∅→/wa/ / V꞉____
# Where V꞉ is oo
# boo-a-h→bóowah
* ∅→/ja/ / V꞉____
# Where V꞉ can be either ii or aa
# talaa-a-h→talaayah

====/i-/ deletion====
* In Choctaw, there is a group of nouns which contain an initial /i-/ that encodes for 3rd person possession. It may be deleted, but if the /i/ is part of a VC syllable structure, the C is also deleted, because the resulting CCV syllable is rarely a permissible syllable structure at the onset of words.
:/i/→∅ / #____
: Part 1: /i + C/→∅ + /C/ / #____
: Part 2: /∅ + C/→∅ / #____
:ippókni&#x27;→ppókni&#x27;→pókni&#x27;

====/-l-/ infix assimilation====
* The verbal infix /l/ is pronounced /h, ch, or ɬ/ when /l/ precedes a voiceless consonant.
:l → {h, tʃ, ɬ} /_C[-voice]
:ho-l-tinah → ho-ɬ-tinah

====Phonological processes of the suffix /-li/====

* There are several assimilation processes that occur with the suffix /-li/. When the verbal suffix /-li/ is preceded by /f/ /ɫ/ /h/ /m/ /n/ or /w/, the /l/ assimilates to the corresponding consonant that precedes it. Also, the verbal suffix /-li/ is preceded by the consonant /b/, the /l/ is realized as /b/. Third, when the verbal suffix /-li/ is preceded by the consonant /p/, the /p/ is pronounced as /b/. Lastly, when the verbal suffix /-li/ is preceded by the consonant /t/, the /t/ is pronounced as /l/.
:/l/→/f, ɫ, h, m, n, w/ / /f, ɫ, h, m, n, w/____
: /kobaf-li-h/→ kobaaffih

: /l/→/b/ / /b/____
: /atob-li-h/→ atobbih

: /p/→/b/ / ____/l/
: /tap-li-h/→ tablih

: /t/→/l/ / ____/l/
: /palhat-li-h/→ pallalih

* There are two deletion processes that occur with the suffix /-li/. If the verbal suffix /-li/ precedes the verbal suffix /-tʃi/, the suffix /-li/ may be deleted if the resulting syllable, after deletion, is a consonant cluster. The other process occurs when the verbal suffix /-li/ precedes the suffix /-t/, which results with the suffix /-li/ being sometimes deleted if the syllable /-li/ has not already gone under phonological processes as described above.
:/li/→∅ / ____/tʃi/
:balii-li-chi-h→balii-chi-h

:/li/→∅ / ____/t/
:balii-li--h→balii-t

====Schwa insertion====
* Schwa insertion: when a glottal fricative or a velar stop precedes a voiced consonant within a consonant cluster, a schwa is inserted to break up the consonant cluster.
:∅→ / ____[+voiced] consonant
:∅→ / ____[+voiced] consonant
:&#x27;ahnih&#x27;→/ahənih/

====Vowel deletion====
* Vowel deletion is the process of a short vowel being deleted at a morpheme boundary. It occurs when an affix containing a short vowel at the morpheme boundary binds to a word that also contains a short vowel at the morpheme boundary.
# For most vowel deletion cases, the preceding short vowel is deleted at the morpheme boundary.
:V→∅ / ____V
:/baliili-aatʃĩ-h/→baliilaatʃĩh
# If a class II suffix attaches to a word that results with two short vowels occurring together, the short vowel that follows the class II suffix is deleted.
:V→∅ / V____
:/sa-ibaa-waʃoohah/→sabaa-waʃoohah

== Orthography ==
The written Choctaw language is based upon the English version of the Roman alphabet and was developed in conjunction with the &quot;civilization program&quot; of the United States, a program to westernize and forcefully assimilate Indigenous Americans, particularly those adhering to what were to become the Five Civilized Tribes (of which the Choctaw are a part) into Anglo-American Culture and Sympathies during the early 19th century. Although there are other variations of the Choctaw alphabet, the three most commonly seen are the Byington (Traditional), Byington/Swanton (Linguistic), and Modern (Mississippi Choctaw).

Many publications by linguists about the Choctaw language use a slight variant of the &quot;modern (Mississippi Choctaw)&quot; orthography listed here, where long vowels are written as doubled. In the &quot;linguistic&quot; version, the acute accent shows the position of the pitch accent, rather than the length of the vowel.

The discussion of Choctaw grammar below uses the linguistic variant of the orthography.

# Choctaw Bible Translation Committee
# Substituted with &#x27;v&#x27; according to typesetting or encoding constraints.
# The former is used before a vowel; the latter, before a consonant. The intervocalic use of conflated the common consonant cluster /hl/ with /ɬ/.
# Dictionary editors John Swanton and Henry Halbert systematically replaced all instances of with , regardless whether stood for /ɬ/ or /hl/. Despite the editors&#x27; systematic replacement of all with , the digraph was allowed to stand.

==Morphology==
===Verbal morphology===
Choctaw verbs display a wide range of inflectional and derivational morphology. In Choctaw, the category of verb may also include words that would be categorized as adjectives or quantifiers in English. Verbs may be preceded by up to three prefixes and followed by as many as five suffixes. In addition, verb roots may contain infixes that convey aspectual information.

====Verb prefixes====
The verbal prefixes convey information about the arguments of the verb: how many there are and their person and number features. The prefixes can be divided into three sorts: agreement markers, applicative markers, and anaphors (reflexives and reciprocals). The prefixes occur in the following order: agreement-anaphor-applicative-verb stem.

=====Agreement affixes=====
The agreement affixes are shown in the following chart. The only suffix among the personal agreement markers is the first-person singular class I agreement marker /-li/. Third-person is completely unmarked for class I and class II agreement arguments and never indicates number.


Some authors (Ulrich 1986, Davies, 1986) refer to class I as actor or nominative, class II as patient or accusative and class III as dative. Broadwell prefers the neutral numbered labels because the actual use of the affixes is more complex. This type of morphology is generally referred to as active–stative and polypersonal agreement.

Class I affixes always indicate the subject of the verb. Class II prefixes usually indicate direct object of active verbs and the subject of stative verbs. Class III prefixes indicate the indirect object of active verbs. A small set of stative psychological verbs have class III subjects; an even smaller set of stative verbs dealing primarily with affect, communication and intimacy have class III direct objects.

======Active verbs======
As the chart above shows, there is no person-number agreement for third person arguments. Consider the following paradigms:
# When the subject and object refer to the same thing or person (coreference), the reflexive &quot;ili-&quot; prefix is mandatory and used in place of the coreferent object.

Transitive active verbs seemingly with class III direct objects:

* &quot;Am-anoli-tok&quot; &#x27;She/he/it/they told me.&#x27;
* &quot;Chim-anoli-tok&quot; &#x27;She/he/it/they told you.&#x27;
* &quot;Im-anoli-tok&quot; &#x27;She/he/it/they told him/her/it/them.&#x27;
* &quot;Pim-anoli-tok&quot; &#x27;She/he/it/they told us.&#x27;
* &quot;Hachim-anoli-tok&quot; &#x27;She/he/it/they told y&#x27;all.&#x27;

When a transitive verb occurs with more than one agreement prefix, I prefixes precede II and III prefixes:

For intransitive verbs, the subjects of active verbs typically have class I agreement. Because third-person objects are unmarked, intransitive active verbs are indistinguishable in form from transitive active verbs with a third-person direct object.

======Stative verbs======

The subjects of stative verbs typically have II agreement. A small set of psychological verbs have subjects with class III agreement.



=====Negatives=====
The set of agreement markers labelled N above is used with negatives. Negation is multiply marked, requiring that an agreement marker from the N set replace the ordinary I agreement, the verb appear in the lengthened grade (see discussion below), and that the suffix /-o(k)-/ follow the verb, with deletion of the preceding final vowel. The optional suffix /-kii/ may be added after /-o(k)-/. Consider the following example:

Compare this with the affirmative counterpart:

To make this example negative, the 1sI suffix /-li/ is replaced by the 1sN prefix /ak-/; the verb root &quot;iya&quot; is lengthened and accented to yield &quot;íiya&quot;; the suffix /-o/ is added, the final vowel of &quot;iiya&quot; is deleted, and the suffix /-kii/ is added.

=====Anaphoric prefixes=====
Reflexives are indicated with the /ili-/ prefix, and reciprocals with /itti-/:

====Verb suffixes====
:While the verbal prefixes indicate relations between the verb and its arguments, the suffixes cover a wider semantic range, including information about valence, modality, tense and evidentiality.

The following examples show modal and tense suffixes like /-aachii̱/ &#x27;irrealis&#x27;(approximately equal to future), /-tok/ &#x27;past tense&#x27;, /-h/ &#x27;default tenses&#x27;:

There are also suffixes that show evidentiality, or the source of evidence for a statement, as in the following pair:

There are also suffixes of illocutionary force which may indicate that the sentence is a question, an exclamation, or a command:

====Verbal infixes====
Choctaw verb stems have various infixes that indicate their aspect. These stem variants are traditionally referred to as &#x27;grades&#x27;. The table below shows the grades of Choctaw, along with their main usage.

Some examples that show the grades follow:

In this example the l-grade appears because of the suffixes /-na/ &#x27;different subject&#x27; and /-o(k)/ &#x27;negative&#x27;:

The g-grade and y-grade typically get translated into English as &quot;finally VERB-ed&quot;:

The hn-grade is usually translated as &#x27;kept on VERBing&#x27;:

The h-grade is usually translated &quot;just VERB-ed&quot; or &quot;VERB-ed for a short time&quot;:

===Nominal morphology===

====Noun prefixes====
Nouns have prefixes that show agreement with a possessor. Agreement markers from class II are used on a lexically specified closed class of nouns, which includes many (but not all) of the kinship terms and body parts. This is the class that is generally labeled inalienable.



Nouns that are not lexically specified for II agreement use the III agreement markers:

Although systems of this type are generally described with the terms alienable and inalienable, this terminology is not particularly appropriate for Choctaw, since alienability implies a semantic distinction between types of nouns. The morphological distinction between nouns taking II agreement and III agreement in Choctaw only partly coincides with the semantic notion of alienability.

====Noun suffixes====
Choctaw nouns can be followed by various determiner and case-marking suffixes, as in the following examples, where we see
determiners such as /-ma/ &#x27;that&#x27;, /-pa/ &#x27;this&#x27;, and /-akoo/ &#x27;contrast&#x27; and case-markers /-(y)at/ &#x27;nominative&#x27; and /-(y)a̱/ &#x27;accusative&#x27;:

The last example shows that nasalizing the last vowel of the preceding N is a common way to show the accusative case.

===Word order and case marking===
:The simplest sentences in Choctaw consist of a verb and a tense marker, as in the following examples:



:As these examples show, there are no obligatory noun phrases in a Choctaw sentence, nor is there any verbal agreement that indicates a third person subject or object. There is no indication of grammatical gender, and for third person arguments there is no indication of number. (There are, however, some verbs with suppletive forms that indicate the number of a subject or object, e.g. iyah &#x27;to go (sg.)&#x27;, ittiyaachih &#x27;to go (du.)&#x27;, and ilhkolih &#x27;to go (pl)&#x27;.)

When there is an overt subject, it is obligatorily marked with the nominative case /-at/. Subjects precede the verb

When there is an overt object, it is optionally marked with the accusative case /-a̱/

The Choctaw sentence is normally verb-final, and so the head of the sentence is last.

Some other phrases in Choctaw also have their head at the end. Possessors precede the possessed noun in the Noun Phrase:

Choctaw has postpositional phrases with the postposition after its object:

==Vocabulary==

<doc id="1030859" wikidata="Q502093" url="?curid=1030859" title="Casablanca Conference">
<text>The Casablanca Conference (codenamed SYMBOL) or Anfa Conference was held in Casablanca, French Morocco, from January 14 to 24, 1943, to plan the Allied European strategy for the next phase of World War II. The main discussions were between US President Franklin Roosevelt (with his military staff) and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (with his staff). Stalin could not attend. Key decisions included a commitment to demand Axis powers&#x27; unconditional surrender; plans for an invasion of Sicily and Italy before the main invasion of France; an intensified strategic bombing campaign against Germany; and approval of a US Navy plan to advance on Japan through the central Pacific and the Philippines. The last item authorized the island-hopping campaign in the Pacific, which shortened the war. Of all the decisions made, the most important was the Allied invasion of Sicily, which Churchill pushed for in part to divert American attention from opening a second front in France in 1943, a move that he feared would result in very high Allied casualties and not be possible until 1944.

Also attending were the sovereign of Morocco, Sultan Muhammad V, and representing the Free French forces, Generals Charles de Gaulle and Henri Giraud, but they played minor roles and were not part of the military planning. Joseph Stalin, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, declined to attend, citing the ongoing Battle of Stalingrad as requiring his presence in Moscow.

Roosevelt and Churchill issued the public Casablanca Declaration, which the promulgation of the policy of “unconditional surrender.” That doctrine came to represent the unified voice of Allied will and the determination that the Axis powers would be fought to their ultimate defeat

==Casablanca Declaration of &quot;unconditional surrender&quot;==

The conference produced a unified statement of purpose, the Casablanca Declaration. It announced to the world that the Allies would accept nothing less than the &quot;unconditional surrender&quot; of the Axis powers. Roosevelt had borrowed the term from US Army General Ulysses S. Grant (known as &quot;Unconditional Surrender&quot; Grant ), who had communicated that stance to the Confederate commander during the American Civil War. So Roosevelt stated at the concluding press conference on 24 January that the Allies were demanding &quot;unconditional surrender&quot; from the Germans, the Italians and the Japanese.

In a February 12, 1943 radio address, Roosevelt explained what he meant by unconditional surrender: &quot;we mean no harm to the common people of the Axis nations. But we do mean to impose punishment and retribution upon their guilty, barbaric leaders&quot;.

Behind the scenes, the United States and the United Kingdom were divided in the commitment to see the war through to Germany&#x27;s capitulation and &quot;unconditional surrender&quot;. But Churchill had agreed in advance about &quot;unconditional surrender&quot;; he had cabled the War Cabinet four days earlier and they had not objected. US General George Marshall also said that he had been consulted; he had stated on 7 January that Allied morale would be &quot;strengthened by the uncompromising demand, and Stalin&#x27;s suspicions allayed&quot;.

However some source material contradicts the official reported accord between Churchill and Roosevelt, claiming that Churchill did not fully subscribe to the doctrine of &quot;unconditional surrender&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; correspondent Drew Middleton, who was in Casablanca at the conference, later revealed in his book, &quot;Retreat From Victory&quot;, that Churchill had been &quot;startled by the [public] announcement [of unconditional surrender]. I tried to hide my surprise. But I was his [Roosevelt&#x27;s] ardent lieutenant&quot;.

According to historian Charles Bohlen, &quot;Responsibility for this unconditional surrender doctrine rests almost exclusively with President Roosevelt&quot;. He guessed that Roosevelt made the announcement &quot;to keep Soviet forces engaged with Germany on the Russian front, thus depleting German munitions and troops&quot; and also &quot;to prevent Stalin from negotiating a separate peace with the Nazi regime&quot;.

That the war would be fought by the Allies until the total annihilation of enemy forces was not universally welcomed. Diplomatic insiders were critical that such a stance was too unequivocal and inflexible, would prevent any opportunity for political maneuvering and would be morally debilitating to French and German resistance groups.

The British felt that arriving at some accommodation with Germany would allow the German Army to help fight off a Soviet takeover of Eastern Europe. To Churchill and the other Allied leaders, the real obstacle to realising that mutual strategy with Germany was the leadership of Adolf Hitler. Allen Dulles, the chief of OSS intelligence in Bern, Switzerland, maintained that the Casablanca Declaration was &quot;merely a piece of paper to be scrapped without further ado if Germany would sue for peace. Hitler had to go.&quot;

There is evidence that German resistance forces, highly placed anti-Nazi government officials, were working with British intelligence, MI6, to eliminate Hitler and negotiate a peace with the Allies. One such individual was Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, head of German intelligence, the Abwehr. His persistent overtures for support from the United States were ignored by Roosevelt.

==Topics of discussion and agreements==

===European invasion===

Roosevelt, with advice from General George Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, lobbied for a cross-Channel invasion of Europe. Churchill, with advice from the British Chiefs of Staff, led by General Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS, the professional head of the British Army), felt the time was not opportune, and favored an Allied assault on the island of Sicily followed by an invasion of mainland Italy. The British argument centred on the need to pull German reserves down into Italy where, due to the relatively poor north–south lines of communication, they could not be easily extracted to defend against a later invasion of northwest Europe. Additionally, by delaying the cross-Channel landing, it would mean that any invasion would be against a German army further weakened by many more months&#x27; fighting on the Eastern Front against the Red Army.

Throughout the conference, Roosevelt&#x27;s attention was prominently focused on the Pacific War front and he faulted the British for what he felt was not a full commitment against Japanese entrenchment. The Italian strategy was agreed upon, a compromise between the two leaders, Roosevelt acceding to Churchill&#x27;s approach for Europe. Churchill, in turn, pledged more troops and resources to the Pacific and Burma to reinforce positions held by Chiang Kai-shek against the Japanese. The United States would provide assistance to the British in the Pacific by supplying escorts and landing craft.

===Logistical issues===
* Next phase of European war
* All possible aid would be provided to the Russian offensive
* Assessment of U-boat danger in the Atlantic
* Disposition of ships, planes, troops in the various theatres of war
* Stalin and Chiang Kai-shek would be fully apprised of the conference agenda and resulting accords

===Leadership of Free French forces===

Charles de Gaulle had to be forced to attend, and he met a chilly reception from Roosevelt and Churchill. No French representatives were allowed to attend the military planning sessions.

The conference called for the official recognition of a joint leadership of the Free French forces by de Gaulle and Henri Giraud. There was notable tension between the two men, who limited their interactions to formalities like pledging their mutual support. Roosevelt encouraged them to shake hands for the photographers eager for a photo opportunity, but the ritual handshake was with reluctance and done so quickly that they reportedly had to pose for a second shot. Roosevelt would later describe this meeting between the French leaders as a &quot;shotgun wedding&quot;.

Elliott Roosevelt&#x27;s book, &quot;As He Saw It&quot; (1946) describes how Franklin Roosevelt wanted the French provisional government to be set up with Giraud and de Gaulle, who would be &quot;equally responsible for its composition and welfare.&quot; (89) That is because Franklin Roosevelt saw de Gaulle as Churchill&#x27;s puppet and thought that Giraud would be more compliant with US interests. Complications arose because most people in the French Resistance considered de Gaulle the undisputed leader of the Resistance and so Giraud was progressively dispossessed of his political and military roles. Roosevelt eventually recognized de Gaulle as the head of the Free French in October 1944.

===Plans for postwar northern Africa===
The day before, Roosevelt became the first US president to visit Africa when he stayed at the city of Bathurst, Gambia. The poor situation of Gambians under the British Empire further increased his anti-colonialism, leading him to further discuss and impress upon Churchill the need for an international trusteeship system that would advance colonies like Gambia towards independence.

During the Conference, Roosevelt met privately with Churchill and Sultan Muhammad V of Morocco, who was accompanied by his 14-year-old son, Crown Prince Moulay Hassan (the future Hassan II).

Roosevelt also spoke with the French resident general at Rabat, Morocco, about postwar independence and Jewish immigrants in North Africa. Roosevelt proposed that:

&quot;[t]he number of Jews engaged in the practice of the professions (law, medicine, etc.) should be definitely limited to the percentage that the Jewish population in North Africa bears to the whole of the North African population... [T]his plan would further eliminate the specific and understandable complaints which the Germans bore towards the Jews in Germany, namely, that while they represented a small part of the population, over 50 percent of the lawyers, doctors, schoolteachers, college professors, etc., in Germany were Jews.&quot;

This disposition of the Jewish population harkened back to a mindset communicated in earlier years to Roosevelt by the American ambassador to Germany, William Dodd (1933–37). Dodd had appraised Germany&#x27;s repression of Jews, and writing to Roosevelt, he said: &quot;The Jews had held a great many more of the key positions in Germany than their number or talents entitled them to.&quot;

Roosevelt presented the results of the conference to the American people in a radio address on February 12, 1943.

During the return trip to the United States, President Roosevelt met with the President of Brazil, Getúlio Vargas, at the Potenji River Conference, where they discussed Brazil&#x27;s participation in the war effort and defined the agreements that led to the creation of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force. The conference took place aboard the in the Potenji River harbor in Natal, on January 28 and 29, 1943.

<doc id="1030860" wikidata="Q587252" url="?curid=1030860" title="Buffer state">
<text>A buffer state is a country geographically lying between two rival or potentially hostile great powers. Its existence can sometimes be thought to prevent conflict between them. A buffer state is sometimes a mutually agreed upon area lying between two greater powers, which is demilitarised in the sense of not hosting the armed forces of either power (though it will usually have its own military forces). The invasion of a buffer state by one of the powers surrounding it will often result in war between the powers.

Research shows that buffer states are significantly more likely to be conquered and occupied than nonbuffer states are. This is because &quot;states that great powers have an interest in preserving—buffer states—are in fact in a high-risk group for death. Regional or great powers surrounding buffer states face a strategic imperative to take over buffer states: if these powers fail to act against the buffer, they fear that their opponent will take it over instead. By contrast, these concerns do not apply to nonbuffer states, where powers face no competition for influence or control.&quot;

Buffer states, when authentically independent, typically pursue a neutralist foreign policy, which distinguishes them from satellite states. The concept of buffer states is part of a theory of the balance of power that entered European strategic and diplomatic thinking in the 18th century. After the First World War, notable examples of buffer states were Poland and Czechoslovakia, situated between major powers such as Germany and the Soviet Union. Lebanon is another significant example, positioned between Syria and Israel, thereby experiencing challenges as a result.

==Examples==
===Americas===
* Bolivia, created by Gran Colombia as a buffer between Peru and Argentina during the Upper Peru question
* Uruguay, served as a demilitarised buffer between Argentina and the Empire of Brazil during the early independence period in South America
* Paraguay, maintained after the end of the Paraguayan War in 1870, as a buffer separating Argentina and Brazil
* Georgia, a colony established by Great Britain in 1732 as a buffer between its other colonies along the Atlantic coast of North America and Spanish Florida
* Ecuador, served as a &quot;cushion state&quot; between Colombia and Peru, which had a bigger extension and military force and fought a war in the 1820s.

===Asia===
* Kingdom of Judah was a buffer state between Egyptian Empire and Neo-Babylonian Empire.
* Multiple buffer states played major roles during the Roman–Persian Wars (66 BC – 628 AD). Armenia was a frequently contested buffer between the Roman Empire (as well as the later Byzantine Empire) and the various Persian and Muslim states.
* North Korea, during and after the Cold War, has been seen by some analysts as a buffer state between the military forces of China, the Soviet Union and those of South Korea, Japan, and the United States (stationed in South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan from 1954 to 1979).
* Manchukuo was a pro-Japanese buffer state between the Empire of Japan, the Soviet Union, and the Republic of China during World War II.
* Thailand, historically known as Siam, was an independent buffer state between the British Raj, British Malaya, French Indochina, and their competing colonial interests in Laos and Cambodia.
* Korea acted as a buffer zone between the growing superpowers of Imperial Japan and the Russian Empire.
* The Far Eastern Republic was a formally independent state created to act as a buffer between Bolshevik Russia and the Empire of Japan.
* Afghanistan was a buffer state between the British Empire, which ruled much of South Asia, and the Russian Empire, which ruled much of Central Asia, during the Anglo–Russian conflicts of the 19th century. Later, the Wakhan Corridor extended the buffer eastwards to the Chinese border.
* The Himalayan nations of Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim were buffer states between the British Empire and China. Later, during the Sino-Indian War of 1962, they became buffers between China and India as the two powers fought along their borders.
* Mongolia acted as a buffer between the Soviet Union and China until 1991. It currently serves as a buffer between Russia and China.
* is a buffer state between Israel and Syria.
* and are buffer states between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

===Africa===
* Morocco served as a buffer state between the Ottoman Empire, Spain, and Portugal in the 16th century.
* The Bechuanaland Protectorate (present-day Botswana) was initially created as a buffer between the British Empire and the two Boer republics of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal Republic until the Second Boer War.

===Europe===
* Principality of Transylvania was a buffer state between Ottoman Empire and Habsburg Empire until the Treaty of Karlowitz was signed.
* Switzerland has been a buffer state between Italy, Austria, France, Germany, and other state powers in medieval and modern Europe.
* The United Kingdom of the Netherlands, composed of today&#x27;s Belgium and Netherlands, was created by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 to maintain peace between France, Prussia, and the United Kingdom. The kingdom existed for 15 years until the Belgian Revolution.
* Belgium acted as buffer state between France, the German Empire, the Netherlands, and the British Empire before the First World War.
* The Rhineland served as a demilitarised zone between France and Germany during the interwar years of the 1920s and early 1930s. There were early French attempts at creating a Rhenish Republic.
* The Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia was founded as a buffer state between Soviet Russia and the European powers.
* The Qasim Khanate (1452–1681) may have served as a buffer between Muscovy and the Kazan Khanate.
* Austria acted as a buffer state between Germany and Italy during the interwar period.
* Poland and other states between Germany and the Soviet Union have sometimes been described as buffer states, both as non-communist states before World War II and later as communist states of the Eastern Bloc.
* Yugoslavia, which broke with the Soviet Union before the formation of the Warsaw Pact, became a buffer state between NATO and the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War.
* West Germany and East Germany were also regarded as buffer states between NATO and the Warsaw Pact during the Cold War in Europe.
* During the Cold War, Sweden and Finland were sometimes regarded as buffer states between NATO and the Soviet Union. More recently, the Russo-Ukrainian War has helped push both countries into joining NATO.
* Cyprus was instaured as an buffer state in 1960 as a form to avoid the risk of a war for the island control between Greece and Turkey. 

===Oceania===
* New Hebrides served as a buffer between the United Kingdom and France in Oceania during the New Imperialism period.
* Papua New Guinea served as a buffer state between Indonesia, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. Indonesia accused both the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu of supporting the Free Papua Movement during the Papua conflict.

<text>The United States Air Forces in Europe – Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA) is a United States Air Force (USAF) major command (MAJCOM) and a component command of both United States European Command (USEUCOM) and United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM). As part of its mission, USAFE-AFAFRICA commands U.S. Air Force units pledged to NATO, maintaining combat-ready wings based from the United Kingdom to Turkey. USAFE-AFAFRICA plans, conducts, controls, coordinates and supports air and space operations in Europe, parts of Asia and all of Africa with the exception of Egypt to achieve U.S. national and NATO objectives based on taskings by the two combatant commanders.

USAFE-AFAFRICA is headquartered at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. It is the oldest continuously active USAF major command, originally activated on 1 February 1942 at Langley Field, Virginia, as the Eighth Air Force of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Two years later, it was designated as United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe (USSTAF) and on 7 August 1945 it was designated as United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE). On 20 April 2012 it formally assumed its current designation when the Seventeenth Air Force inactivated.

The command has more than 35,000 active duty personnel, Air Reserve Component personnel, and civilian employees assigned.

== Origins ==
The origins of USAFE can be traced to 19 January 1942, with the establishment of Eighth Air Force. Eighth Air Force was activated on 28 January at Savannah Army Air Base, Georgia. On 5 May, Major General Carl Spaatz assumed command of HQ Eighth Air Force. On 8 January, the order activating the &quot;U.S. Air Forces in the British Isles&quot; (USAFBI) was announced. On 12 May, the first contingent of USAAF personnel arrived in England to join the Eighth Air Force. On 15 June, Spaatz arrived in England to establish Headquarters, Eighth Air Force at Bushy Park, west-south-west of London.

Eighth Air Force controlled:
* VIII Bomber Command (Established 19 January 1942)
: Strategic bombardment using heavy, four-engined bombers.
* VIII Fighter Command (Established 19 January 1942)
: Provide fighter escort of heavy bombers
* VIII Air Support Command (Established 24 April 1942)
: Provide reconnaissance, troop transport, and tactical bombardment using twin-engine medium bombers.
* VIII Air Service Command (Established 1942, name changed to VIII Air Force Service Command by 1943)
: Service and logistical support.

On 22 February 1944, the Army Air Forces reorganized its commands in Europe. Eighth Air Force was redesignated as United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe (USSTAF) and VIII Bomber Command was redesignated as Eighth Air Force.

On 7 August 1945, USSTAF was redesignated as United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE). Its headquarters was relocated from Saint Germain-en-Laye, France, to Lindsey Air Station, Wiesbaden, Germany, on 28 September 1945. Within 18 months of VE-Day, virtually all U.S. armed forces personnel had left Europe except for the Occupation Forces in Germany, Austria, and a small number of U.S. Army troops in Trieste. USAFE had been reduced from a force of 17,000 aircraft and about 500,000 personnel to about 2,000 aircraft and 75,000 personnel. USAFE&#x27;s four wartime Air Forces were demobilized or reassigned between August and December 1945. In March 1946 USAFE was given the status of a Major Command (MAJCOM).

A major postwar mission for USAFE was Operation Lusty, in which former Luftwaffe jet aircraft, such as the Messerschmitt Me 262A and Heinkel He 162A were located on various airfields around Munich and shipped to the United States for inspection and evaluation. At Lechfeld Air Base near Augsburg, large numbers of Me 262s were discovered, and valuable German air-to-air rockets. At the Oberpfaffenhofen air base near Munich – the former Dornier factory airfield, and today the home of Germany&#x27;s DLR aerospace research facility – USAFE found a high-speed Dornier Do 335. This propeller-driven aircraft could reach a speed of 760 km/h, about 100 km slower than the Me 262 jet fighter. Other former Luftwaffe aircraft were collected and simply sent to blast furnaces for metal recycling.

In March 1947, General Joseph T. McNarney, Commanding General, U.S. Forces, European Theatre, told the War Department all he needed was &quot;an Air Force of about 7,500 [men] to provide air transport and communications.&quot; He had no need for combat units, which he described as an &quot;administrative burden,&quot; and he wanted them withdrawn. Nobody in Washington objected. Thus, the XII Tactical Air Command, the now USAFE combat organization after the inactivation of the four Air Forces, was inactivated on 10 May 1947. By this time, USAFE&#x27;s fighting force appears to have dropped to a single unit, the 86th Fighter Group, which was shuffled around three separate stations in Germany in 1946–47 as it absorbed the inactivating personnel and equipment of first the 406th Fighter Group and then the 33rd Fighter Group.

In 1945 IX Air Force Service Command was reassigned from Ninth Air Force to USSTAF (about the date IX ASC moved to Erlangen). On 7 October 1946, IX ASC was redesignated European Air Materiel Command. This command administered USAFE&#x27;s supply and maintenance depots. EAMC was headquartered at Erlangen Air Depot. At Erding Air Depot, it had Detachment B, 4th Air Vehicle Repair Squadron, and the 43d Air Depot. The 10th Air Depot was located at Oberpfaffenhofen Air Depot. The 862d Engineer Aviation Battalion and 837th Engineer Aviation Battalion were located at Landsberg. At Industriehafen Air Depot was Detachment A, 42d Air Repair Squadron. Minor EAMC facilities were located at Bad Wiesse, Wolfgang, Munich, Bruck, Oberwiesenfeld and Bremerhaven. EAMC also controlled ammunition depots at Landesberg, Roth and Zepplenheim. EAMC remained assigned to USAFE until it was inactivated on 15 September 1947.

=== European Air Transport Service ===

The European Air Transport Service (EATS), built around the 51st Troop Carrier Wing, controlled C-46, Douglas C-47 Skytrain and C-54 transport aircraft and provided passenger and cargo transport within Western Europe. Its headquarters was at Wiesbaden. It initially controlled the former IX Troop Carrier Command squadrons which remained after the war. EATS operated both cargo and personnel transport routes in non-Communist controlled areas to support the American, British and French occupation forces, along with units in Greece (Athens Airport) and Italy.
Known EATS facilities were:
* Bremen Airfield
: Flight D, 47th Air Logistics Squadron
: 371st Air Service Group
* Capodichino Air Base, Naples
: 2618th HHQ Squadron
* Eschborn Airfield
: 446th Air Service Group
* Munich-Riem Airfield
: 464th Air Service Group
: 60th Troop Carrier Group

* Pisa Air Base, Italy
: 29th Troop Carrier Squadron
* Rhein-Main Airfield
: 61st Troop Carrier Squadron
* Tulln Airfield, Austria
: 313th Troop Carrier Group
: 91st Airdrome Squadron
* Wiesbaden Airfield
: Detachment A, 15th Troop Carrier Squadron
There were also EATS terminals and detachments at Tempelhof Airport, West Berlin, RAF Bovingdon, Hertfordshire, UK, and Paris-Orly Airfield, France.

== Beginning of the Cold War ==

=== Uneasy peace ===

Concerned about the massive drawdown of USAFE and the United States Army Europe (USAREUR), the U.S. member of the Allied High Commission for Germany, John J. McCloy, had grave concerns that the troops available would be insufficient to ensure a peaceful transition in the American Zone. The United States&#x27; European wartime allies, Britain and France, had also rapidly demobilized.

In preparation for the future, the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and USAFE began a series of mapping flights over Soviet-controlled territory in Germany that led to numerous skirmishes and high tensions. Between the autumn of 1945 and 1947, mapped areas in west and central Europe, North Africa and the Atlantic Islands on a large scale in Operation Casey Jones. Casey Jones flights were made by reconnaissance variant RB-24 Liberators (the former &quot;F-7&quot; variant) and RB-17 Flying Fortresses (formerly called the &quot;F-9&quot;). These flights were only supposed to be flown over the Western Allies occupation zones, but there is a strong suspicion that these aircraft also operated over the Soviet zone. Soviet fighters regularly opened fire on U.S. aircraft operating over their occupation zone. On 22 April 1946, a Douglas C-47 near the Tulln Air Base near Vienna over the Soviet zone of Austria was attacked by Soviet Bell P-39 Airacobra fighters. On 9 August, Yugoslavian fighters opened fire on another USAAF C-47 and forced it to land.

=== Rotation of strategic bombers through Europe ===

Soviet activity in Eastern Europe unsettled the western allies. President Harry S. Truman decided to take a hard line with Russia, lest the situation evolve into a new war. In Germany, Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base near Munich, Giebelstadt near Würzburg, and Rhein-Main near Frankfurt were rebuilt to accommodate Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers. Strategic Air Command (SAC) wanted its B-29 fleet as close to the Soviet Union as possible because of their limited range and it was decided to rotate a portion of SAC&#x27;s B-29 fleet through Europe. In November 1946, six B-29 bombers from SAC&#x27;s 43d Bombardment Group at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona were deployed to RAF Burtonwood, and from there to various bases in Germany as a &quot;training deployment.&quot; The B-29s were flown to bases in France, Turkey, Greece and were flown along the borders of Bulgaria and Russia over the Black Sea as part of &quot;show the flag&quot; operations. In May 1947, SAC began additional &quot;training deployments&quot; that stationed a number of B-29s in Germany at Giebelstadt and Fürstenfeldbruck. These B-29 squadrons were constantly rotated back to the United States. being replaced with new squadrons in rotation. SAC also deployed B-29s to the United Kingdom where they were rotated through RAF Marham, RAF Waddington, RAF Scampton and RAF Lakenheath.

The United States also provided military aid to the Greek Air Force to help the postwar Greek government during the Greek Civil War. AT-6 Texan trainers and C-47 Skytrain transport aircraft, along with armored vehicles, small arms weapons, munitions and radar were provided. In Turkey, various intelligence gathering aircraft were deployed along the northern Black Sea coast, providing the United States intelligence about the Soviet Republics of Armenia and Georgia. Overflights of the Soviet Union were also performed.

=== Berlin Airlift ===
The Berlin Airlift was one of the defining events of and marked the beginning of the Cold War. The 464-day effort to supply a city&#x27;s needs solely through the air demonstrated the resolve of Western nations to maintain influence in Berlin. The massive humanitarian effort was an early triumph for allied air forces, and symbolized Western commitment to anti-Communist efforts in Europe after World War II.

In 1945 the Soviets, Americans, British and French divided Germany into occupation zones. Berlin, although in the Soviet zone, also was divided among the four powers. On 18 June 1948, the three Western sectors agreed on a new common German currency, coming into force on 20 June, that ended the use of occupation currency and introduced the Deutsche Mark. The Soviets considered this move a breach of agreements reached at the 1945 Potsdam Conference, which stated that Germany would be treated as one economic unit. In response to the currency reform action by the West, on 23 June the Soviets cut off electrical power to a large part of the western sectors of Berlin. The next day, 24 June the Soviet Union blocked western all road, rail and barge access through the Soviet occupation zone of Germany to the three Western-held sectors of Berlin, beginning the Berlin Blockade. The Soviets also now rejected western arguments of their occupation rights in Berlin, and legal claims to unimpeded use of the highways and railroads to the city.

==== USAF mobilization ====

After discussion of military options, the priority was given to supplying Berlin by air, as the Soviet blockade had little effect on the three Berlin air corridors. The Soviet Union did not initially interfere with the cargo aircraft flying the Berlin Airlift, as they were convinced that supplying two million Berliners by air was an impossible task. In 1948, USAFE strength was limited. The command consisted of 485 aircraft, with the 60th and 61st Troop Carrier Groups at Rhein-Main and Wiesbaden Air Bases near Frankfurt, both flying C-47s. The only other flying unit was the 86th Fighter Group at Neubiberg Air Base near Munich, with P-47s, which had been activated on 1 July 1948.
On the morning of 26 June, two days after the blockade began, the first C-47 loaded with milk and medicine took off from Wiesbaden Air Base for Tempelhof Air Base in Berlin. A total of 32 flights were made on that first day. Yet it would take many hundreds of cargo flights each day to provide the 12,000 tons of food, fuel, clothing and medicine it was estimated was necessary to sustain the two million people of western Berlin. There were simply not enough C-47s available, as it was estimated that over 900 would be needed to fly the necessary tonnage to Berlin each day. However, if the larger C-54 Skymaster was used, about 180 could supply the cargo necessary. However, there simply weren&#x27;t that many aircraft available. The Military Air Transport Service (MATS) was ordered to mobilize all available C-54s and C-82 Packets wherever they could in the world to support the airlift, and to refurbish as many as possible of the C-47s in storage at Davis-Monthan AFB for airlift duty. The C-74 Globemaster was also considered for use, as its massive cargo carrying capacity would drastically reduce the number of flights and aircraft necessary. However, the aircraft&#x27;s landing requirements far exceeded what was available in Berlin, and it was unsafe to land it on the short runways. The C-74, however did fly cargo from the United States to staging bases in Europe.

To increase USAFE&#x27;s tactical air strength, in July 1948 75 Lockheed F-80s were transferred to Germany with the 36th Fighter Group, being assigned to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base, near Munich. This move considerably increased USAFE&#x27;s tactical airpower, but also was considered as having great psychological value.

In August 1948, 10 C-54s arrived in Germany to begin airlift service. In addition, civilian Douglas DC-4s were loaned to the USAF for airlift duty. The United States Navy provided 21 R-5Ds, their version of the C-54 as well. The airfields at Rhein-Main and Wiesbaden began to fill to capacity with planes, and the decision was made to also use Royal Air Force airfields at Celle and Faßberg. The USAF, the U.S. Navy, and the RAF together airlifted more than 2.3 million tons of food, fuel and medical supplies. Most of the tonnage was carried by the USAF. The Berlin Airlift taxed existing USAF resources of cargo aircraft, aircraft engines, skilled aircrews, and maintenance personnel.

Strategic Air Command reassessed its B-29 forward deployments after the Berlin crisis arose. After initial forward deployments to Goose Bay Air Base in Newfoundland, and consideration of basing the bombers in Germany, it was decided to send them to RAF bases in Britain where they would be less vulnerable. The 28th and 307th Bombardment Groups were deployed to the newly activated station at RAF Marham.

===== Soviet reaction =====
After a few months it was clear to the Soviets that the Americans were succeeding in supplying the western sectors of Berlin with the minimal amount of supplies necessary to sustain it. Mock attacks by Soviet Air Force fighters begun in the air corridors to scare the American pilots caused great confusion and considerably increased the danger of air collisions. Also as many Yakovlev and Lavochkin fighters as possible were assembled around Berlin and then flown en masse in a westerly direction though the corridors. Near the western border of the Soviet occupation zone, they peeled off and flew along the zone border to the next corridor so they could fly back to Berlin along it, against the traffic, to their airfields around Berlin. Western radio frequencies were jammed and chaff was released to confuse radar operators. Searchlights were shone on aircraft in the corridors at night. By the spring of 1949, USAFE announced that there were incidents of Soviets firing at cargo aircraft with anti-aircraft artillery, and of barrage balloons being allowed to float within the corridors. No serious aircraft accidents occurred as a result.

The efforts of many hundreds of pilots and the many thousands of military and German civilians involved in the airlift kept the people of Berlin supplied. On one day, the Berlin Airlift delivered nearly 13,000 tons of provisions with almost 1,400 flights. So great was the stream of aircraft that an aircraft landed almost once a minute at one of the three western Berlin airfields. The continuous engine noise of the aircraft stream of heavy transports not only made an impression on the citizens of Berlin, but on the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union came to realize that the blockade of Berlin would not achieve the desired political effect they wished. On 12 May 1949, the Soviet blockade was lifted. However airlift operated at a reduced level until the end of September to ensure adequate supplies were available in Berlin in case of a re-imposition of the blockade.

== 1950s ==

Even with the Korean War raging in the early 1950s, Europe received a higher priority of air power than Korea by the Truman Administration and the Department of Defense. In September 1950, the NATO Military Committee called for an ambitious buildup of conventional forces to meet the Soviets, subsequently reaffirming this position at the February 1952 meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Lisbon. This meeting established a goal of ultimately fielding 96 divisions in the event of a conventional war in 1954. As part of this buildup USAFE was intended to expand from 16 wings totaling 2,100 aircraft, to 28 wings, 22 of them in the Allied Forces Central Europe area alone, backed by deployed Strategic Air Command units sent from the United States.

The USAF transferred thirteen combat wings from Tactical Air Command plus one air depot wing from Air Materiel Command, and relocated the units to USAFE during the period from April 1951 through December 1954. Eight wings were regular Air Force wings, four wings were federalized Air National Guard units, and one wing was a mobilized Air Force Reserve unit. Four of these wings deployed to the United Kingdom, three into West Germany, and six wings were deployed to France. These wings numbered approximately 500 fighters, 100 light bombers, 100 tactical reconnaissance aircraft, 100 tactical airlift transports, and 18,000 personnel.

Along with these new units from the United States, USAFE moved its forces in West Germany to the west of the River Rhine. Existing bases in Bavaria (Erding Air Depot, Fürstenfeldbruck, Landsberg, Kaufbeuren and Neubiberg Air Bases) were deemed too vulnerable to Soviet attack and were closed by 1960.

On 1 March 1954, Air Materiel Force, European Area was activated at Lindsey Air Station and assigned to USAFE. However, Air Materiel Command finally attained global responsibility for USAF logistics support, and AMF, European Area was transferred to it on 1 January 1956. As part of this realignment, HQ Spain Air Material Area was also reassigned to AMF, European Area. AMC moved AMF European Area to Chateauroux Air Station in May 1958.

From 1954, USAFE built up a large training organization with the primary mission of training the new West German Luftwaffe. Training squadrons were first expanded to groups and then quickly expanded into wings (3-4 groups). In June 1955, the 7330th Flying Training Wing was organized. The 7351st Flight Training Group was redesignated as a wing. The 7331st Technical Training Group was reorganized as a wing in April 1955 at Kaufbeuren Air Base. Because building the German Air Force was a high priority, a new supervisory headquarters was required. On 1 July 1955 the USAFE Training Headquarters, Provisional, was established, responsible for the three Luftwaffe training wings.

In 1955, the force structure was as follows:

Erding, Landsberg, and Neubiberg Air Bases, although nominally under USAF control, were being used to train West German Luftwaffe pilots. When training was complete, the bases were turned over to West German control. The last of these bases were turned over by 1960. Erding Air Base was shared by USAFE interceptors briefly in the early 1970s.

2d Air Division was active at Dhahran Air Base in Saudi Arabia by 1954. By 1960, USAFE controlled additional air bases in French Morocco, Wheelus in Libya, Greece, Turkey, Italy, and Spain.
On 4 November 1956, Soviet troops invaded Hungary, after the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. In response, the United States deployed sixteen Convair B-36 Peacemaker bombers to RAF Burtonwood in the United Kingdom. It is still unknown if the B-36s were armed with nuclear weapons. Several temporary SAC &quot;Reflex&quot; deployments of B-47 bombers were also made to bases in the United Kingdom and North Africa.

== 1960s ==

=== 1961 Berlin Crisis ===

The 1961 Berlin Crisis became USAFE&#x27;s first test of what was known as a &quot;Flexible Response&quot; strategy. In the spring of 1961, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev decided that the Soviet Union would sign a peace treaty with the East German government. In effect the German Democratic Republic would control the Russian zone of Berlin and could end joint occupation of the city. This action was a clear violation of the Potsdam Agreement of 1945.

When the Western allies objected to this proposed peace treaty, Khrushchev began speaking about restricting the West&#x27;s aerial access to Berlin and preventing the entry of East Germans into the city. This possibility started an exodus of Germans from the eastern zone as they rushed to leave their sector and relocate in West Germany.

Departures snowballed from a few dozen refugees daily to a flow of 4,000 per day by August 1961. On the night of 12 August 1961 the Soviet backed East German government began erecting the Berlin Wall to prevent this flow of workers from communism, precipitating a new Cold War crisis that had been brewing for the previous twelve months. Berlin became a divided city. The response agreed to by the Kennedy Administration was to rapidly increase tactical airpower in Europe during the summer of 1961.

The Air Force responded with a two-phase deployment of reinforcements to Europe – the largest such overseas movement of aircraft since World War II. The first phase began on 5 September with Operation Tack Hammer. Tactical Air Command launched eight F-100D Super Sabre squadrons from its Composite Air Strike Force to augment USAFE strength with 144 fighters. All Tack Hammer fighters moved across the Atlantic Ocean with aerial refueling en route. The TACK HAMMER deployment was an interim measure until ANG units could relieve Tactical Air Command squadrons. The Air National Guard was tasked to supply six tactical fighter wings and one tactical reconnaissance wing to expand USAFE. Also deployed to Europe was the ANG 152d Tactical Control Group consisting of six Tactical Control Squadrons, manned by 230 officers and 1,850 airmen with mobile ground radar and radio equipment to control tactical air power on the battlefield. It was dispersed throughout West Germany.

The second phase began with the movement of eleven Air National Guard squadrons in late October and November 1961. Operation Stair Step was the code name for the rapid aerial movement of the fighters to Europe. Aircraft supplied by ANG wings totaled one hundred tour F-84Es, twenty RF-84Fs, seventy-eight F-86Hs, and seventy-two F-104As. The majority of the fighters arrived on 4 November and amazingly had no losses en route. The F-84E and F-86Fs were considered old and obsolete aircraft even though they were only seven to nine years out of the factory. The three F-104 squadrons were activated on 1 November 1961. They disassembled their Starfighters and loaded them into Military Air Transport Service C-124s which delivered them to air bases in Germany and Spain.
The primary combat mission of the Stair Step units was air superiority and offensive tactical air support operations using conventional munitions to defend West Germany if a war developed over Berlin access. Upon arrival in Europe their missions consisted of command inspections, theater flying training, air-ground close support operations, gunnery training, photo missions, and air defense alert duty. Though equipped with conventional weapons, the Stair Step F-84F and F-86H squadrons maintained their proficiency to deliver nuclear weapons by practicing toss bombing. By March 1962, the Berlin Crisis was subsiding and plans were being made for departure of the ANG wings from Europe. Units were to return all personnel, equipment, and aircraft to CONUS by 1 September 1962 for early release from active duty.

However, the Berlin Wall was built and a barbed wire fence with minefields extended the entire north–south length of a divided Germany. The wall effectively isolated East Germany for the next twenty-eight years. But the American, British, and French Zones still remained in Berlin and access to the city was not challenged again. Tack Hammer and Stair Step forces had served their purpose; their rapid deployment to France had unequivocally demonstrated the United States&#x27; determination to defend Berlin.

Beginning about 1963 due to the Vietnam War, USAFE/NATO&#x27;s total strength steadily declined, as the U.S. reduced forces in Europe to fight a limited war in Southeast Asia for ten years.

=== French withdrawal from NATO&#x27;s military structure ===
On 7 March 1966, French President Charles de Gaulle announced that France would withdraw from NATO&#x27;s integrated military structure. He gave NATO forces one year (until 1 April 1967) to depart France. The United States Department of State, Department of Defense, and Air Force carefully managed the news about the American departure from France, and the attendant problems of an integrated NATO air defense for western Europe and the decrease in tactical airpower. However, the news media were focusing on Vietnam, so the removal of NATO forces from France went virtually unreported in the US.

During 1966–67 all USAF offices and facilities in France were closed and personnel and equipment moved to other NATO countries. The last USAFE activities were the 1630th Air Base Squadron at Orly Airport and the Paris Administration Office. Both were closed in June 1967. A C-47 variant, the C-117B &quot;Super Skytrain&quot;, was the last USAF aircraft to depart France on 31 May 1967. With the French departure, a major reorganization of USAFE was needed. The 49th TFW&#x27;s three squadrons at Spangdahlem Air Base, and the 417th TFS of the 50th TFW at Hahn Air Base, were recalled to the US. Although the squadrons were relocated to the US, they were still part of USAFE&#x27;s permanent force. According to the Department of Defense, these squadrons were &#x27;dual-based&#x27;; they could return to their European bases at any given moment without lengthy preparations being necessary.

During 1967, the 49th TFW&#x27;s three squadrons flew back to the US where they were stationed at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. The 417th TFS did not return to the US until 1968, when the squadron was stationed at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho. In 1968, the four squadrons switched over completely to McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IID fighter-bombers and then undertook intensive preparations for their new role within USAFE. The primary task of the four dual-based squadrons was to carry out Project Crested Cap. Crested Cap was the Air Force part of the Army&#x27;s Exercise REFORGER, during which Army and Air Force units from the U.S. mainland would be deployed to Europe for Allied Forces Central Europe exercises. Most of the heavy equipment such as armoured vehicles, artillery, etc., were shipped by sea to exercise that transportation component. Troops were flown via military and contract transport aircraft.

Although the withdrawal of USAFE forces from France was completed in 1967, it took until the mid-1970s until USAFE fully realigned its forces in Europe. Zweibrücken AB in West Germany and RAF Upper Heyford in England came under USAFE control within the next several years. Older reconnaissance and fighter aircraft were redeployed from France to Southeast Asia to supplement the U.S. Pacific Air Forces engaged in the Vietnam War.

=== USAFE in Spain ===

Before Spain joined NATO in 1982, the USAF had for many years used Spanish air bases. Initially used primarily by the Strategic Air Command, they were Morón Air Base, at Morón near Sevilla in southern Spain, and Torrejón Air Base at Torrejón near Madrid.
The Spanish air bases were important for reinforcing USAFE via the southern Atlantic route. Aircraft that flew to Europe via Lajes Field in the Azores always made a refueling stop at Morón, and later at Torrejon as well. These bases also had American facilities for carrying out aircraft maintenance and repairs. Yet it was primarily the good weather that drew USAFE to Spain for weapons training, which at that time was still mainly held in Libya utilizing the ranges at Wheelus Air Base.

After June 1960, when SAC&#x27;s 65th Air Division was transferred to USAFE, the footprint of USAFE&#x27;s activities in Spain increased significantly. Two interceptor squadrons equipped with F-102 Delta Daggers were formed, the 431st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (431 FIS) being stationed at Zaragoza Air Base and the 497th FIS at Torrejon AB. As compensation for the permanent use of these Spanish bases, the CASA aircraft factory at Morón AB was brought in to maintain the F-102A air defense fighters that the USAFE had stationed in Spain, Germany and the Netherlands.

As the American-Libyan relationship worsened throughout the second half of the 1960s, a growing number of USAFE fighter-bomber squadrons in England and Germany went to Zaragoza and gunnery ranges in Spain for weapons training. Zaragoza later became an important weapons training site for the USAFE and was also visited by F-15 Eagle squadrons for &quot;Dissimilar Air Combat Training&quot;. During these air combat training exercises, the F-15s often practiced against Spanish Air Force Dassault Mirage F-1 fighters.

In April 1966, the 16th Air Force was transferred from SAC to the USAFE, with USAFE taking control of the Spanish air bases at Zaragoza and Morón. Under USAFE, the Spanish bases became host to a growing number of deployments from CONUS. Morón received regular visits from Lockheed F-104C Starfighters of the 479th TFW from George AFB, California. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, a squadron of F-104Cs was stationed at Morón. Concern at the height of the crisis led to these aircraft being transferred to Hahn Air Base in West Germany, where they strengthened the air defense of central Europe. Some time later, when the crisis had passed, the aircraft returned to the US via Morón. On 1 April 1963, their place was taken by F-105D &quot;Thunderchief&quot; fighter-bombers from the 4th TFW at Seymour Johnson AFB, North Carolina.

During the mid-1960s, the 16th Air Force also gradually took over responsibility for all USAFE operations around the Mediterranean.

=== USAFE in Turkey ===
The U.S. Logistics Group (TUSLOG) was the primary USAF agency in Turkey. TUSLOG not only commanded various USAFE units, but also supported all other U.S. military organizations and government agencies in Turkey. TUSLOG was established in 1955 and was headquartered in the Turkish capital of Ankara. The 39th Air Base Wing at Incirlik Air Base near Adana supported training deployments and regional exercises; communications for National Command Authority taskings; providing support for various units and an Air Mobility Command tenant unit providing air transport of passengers and cargo. From the 1950s – 1970s, the 39th supported various SAC activities in Turkey, which used Incirlik intensively as a base for U-2 reconnaissance flights along the Soviet border and in the Middle East.

In Ankara, the 7217th Air Base Group managed the logistical support for more than 40 units and agencies, as well as the needs of the American Embassy and U.S. Defense Attaché Office. From Izmir Air Station, the 7266th Air Base Group supported the two NATO headquarters, Allied Land Forces South-Eastern Europe (LANDSOUTHEAST) and the Sixth Allied Tactical Air Force (6 ATAF). The 7241st Air Base Group was the only U.S. military unit in Turkey not located at a single site, but was scattered about İzmir in various locations.

In 1966, Senate majority leader Mike Mansfield began a campaign to unilaterally reduce U.S. troop levels in Europe. Following this, Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford initiated a program for the Reduction of Costs and Forces in Europe (REDCOSTE) in 1968. Although a change in administrations occurred in the same year, this program conformed to the Nixon Administration policy of lowering the profile of American forces abroad. Consequently, the U.S. began to eliminate or consolidate many of its operations in Turkey. Between 1969 and 1973, sites at Samsun and Trabzon were turned over to the Turkish government. In addition, Cigli Air Base, which since 1963 had been used by USAF rotational squadrons, was turned over to the Turkish Air Force in 1970. The U.S. continued, however, to fund the maintenance of numerous facilities there. Altogether, between 1967 and 1970, the number of Americans in Turkey dropped from 24,000 to 15,000.

The cutbacks in forces in Turkey naturally had a major effect on TUSLOG. The headquarters in Ankara shrank to a fraction of its former size. On 9 September, it was inactivated as the 7217th Air Division and the next day reestablished as Detachment 1 of Headquarters, Sixteen Air Force.

== 1970s and 1980s ==
Changes continued through the early 1970s. Headquarters USAFE transferred from Lindsey Air Station, Germany, to Ramstein Air Base in March 1973 and NATO&#x27;s Allied Air Forces Central Europe was established at Ramstein Air Base in June 1974. The USAFE commander in chief then took command of Allied Air Forces Central Europe, in addition to commanding U.S. Air Force units in Europe.

In 1976, the new McDonnell Douglas F-15A Eagle air superiority fighter was introduced into USAFE service. The Soviet Union&#x27;s new MiG and Sukhoi fighters made the U.S. Department of Defense anxious. The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 &#x27;Foxbat&#x27; made them pull out all the stops to get the F-15A into USAFE. The F-15A was deployed to Germany in April 1977 with the 36th TFW at Bitburg Air Base West Germany. The 32nd TFS at Soesterberg AB Netherlands was also upgraded to the McDonnell-Douglas F-15A Eagle as part of Project Ready Eagle. By 1986, all USAFE F-4 wings were replaced by F-15 and F-16 fighters. The 36th TFW&#x27;s existing F-4E Phantoms were incorporated into three new USAFE squadrons which were established at Hahn Air Base (313th TFS), Spangdahlem Air Base (480th TFS) and Ramstein Air Base (512th TFS). Preparations for the switch to the F-15 went ahead at full speed. Its introduction to the USAFE was given the project name Ready Eagle and, naturally, included transition training for the USAFE pilots.

This retraining was the joint responsibility of USAFE and TAC and first began in January 1976 at Langley AFB, Virginia, where the 1st TFW, was stationed. At Langley AFB, the USAFE&#x27;s future F-15 pilots were given a crash course that familiarized them with the new aircraft in a relatively short time. The first F-15As arrived at Bitburg AB on 7 January 1977. These were two TF-15A (later redesignated as F-15B) trainers that had flown non-stop from Langley AFB in seven and a half hours.

These Eagles were to be used primarily for ground crew familiarization in anticipation of the arrival of the 525th TFS&#x27;s first F-15As. The 23 aircraft for this first operational squadron left Langley AFB on 27 April 1977 for a mass Atlantic crossing. Over the following months, the aircraft for two other squadrons (22nd TFS and 53rd TFS) arrived. The 36th TFW&#x27;s full strength of 79 fully operational F-15As was reached in December 1977. Project Ready Eagle was completed in precisely one year.

However, after flying the F15A and F-15B for just 18 months, the USAFE exchanged these models for the newer F-15C and F-15D Eagles. In May 1980, the 32d flew five of its F-15A/B Eagles to Eglin AFB, Florida to participate in the weapons systems evaluation program. While at Eglin AFB, the united swapped its aircraft for the newer models. These planes arrived at Soesterberg AB on 13 June, making the 32d the first unit in the USAFE to be equipped with the latest versions of the F-15. The 32nd completed the upgrade on 25 November 1980. At that time the squadron possessed eighteen F-15C and two twin-seat F-15D fighter aircraft.

On 8 August 1985, a terrorist car bomb attack was made against Rhein-Main Air Base. Two Americans were killed and 23 people, including Germans, were injured. The blast was powerful caused debris and damage to the base including to 30 vehicles, trees and windows.

=== SS-20s pointing at Europe ===
By 1975, NATO had lost its strategic nuclear lead over the Soviet Union and with the introduction of the Soviet RT-21M Pioneer (NATO designation SS-20 Saber) had even fallen behind. On 12 December 1979, the U.S. decided to deploy 572 new nuclear missiles in Europe: 108 Pershing II missiles to be operated by the U.S. Army and 464 BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missiles, also known as the Gryphon and based on the U.S. Navy&#x27;s nuclear Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM-N), to be operated by the USAF. Of the cruise missiles, 160 were stationed in England, 96 in West Germany, 112 in Italy, 48 in the Netherlands, and 48 in Belgium. All 108 Pershings were stationed in West Germany. The second significant aspect of the NATO decision was the readiness to &#x27;horse trade&#x27; with the Soviet Union for the reduction or total elimination of these missiles against similar reductions or elimination of the Russian SS-20s.

NATO carried out its plans to station cruise missiles in Europe despite strong protests from the peace movements and heavy diplomatic pressure in the European Parliament. NATO&#x27;s condition for not carrying out its plans was the Soviet Union&#x27;s willingness to halt the deployment of mobile SS-20 nuclear missiles aimed at Europe and remove the missiles already deployed. In 1979, when the NATO decision was taken, the Soviet Union had 14 (1 operational) SS-20 launch sites. The eighty Soviet SS-20s located in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and Czechoslovakia were aimed at targets in Western Europe. According to Western estimates, at the beginning of 1986, the Soviet Union already deployed 279 SS-20 launching installations with a total of 837 nuclear warheads in the GDR and Czechoslovakia.

The first General Dynamics BGM-109 Tomahawk Ground-Launched Cruise Missiles to arrive in Europe went to the 501st Tactical Missile Wing (TMW) at RAF Greenham Common, England. The controversial weapons were delivered by a Lockheed C-141 Starlifter on 14 November 1983. By 1986, there were 32 operational cruise missile launching installations in England (RAF Greenham Common and RAF Molesworth), Belgium (Florennes Air Base), and on Sicily (Comiso Air Base). Because each GLCM launching installation was composed of four weapons, the total number of cruise missiles stationed in Europe was 128.

Disarmament talks between East and West resulted in a disarmament treaty being signed by Soviet Communist Party General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev and US President Ronald Reagan at the end of 1987 during Gorbachev&#x27;s visit to the United States. The Soviet Union agreed to dismantle the SS-20s and the American cruise missiles were also to be withdrawn.

The historic Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, ratified in 1988, mandated the first-ever elimination of an entire class of weapons from U.S. and Soviet inventories. USAFE completed removal of the ground-launched cruise missiles and other weaponry on 26 March 1991, when the last 16 missiles were removed from Comiso Air Base, Italy.

== Post–Cold War era ==
USAFE never had to fight the Soviet Armed Forces and the Warsaw Pact states in Europe. The Soviet Union collapsed in 1990–91. The end of the Cold War saw a clamoring for a &quot;peace dividend&quot;, and questions from many U.S. and Western European officials about the appropriate size and purpose of American military forces in Europe.

All U.S. and NATO allies&#x27; military forces experienced a series of changes over the next five years. USAFE shrunk from over 850 aircraft and 72,000 personnel scattered among 27 bases in 1990 to approximately 240 aircraft, 33,000 personnel, and six flying bases by the end of 1996. In July 1994, with President Clinton in attendance, the British, French, and American air and land forces in Berlin were inactivated in a ceremony on the Four Ring Parade field at Tempelhof Central Airport.

=== Iraq and Kuwait in the 1990s ===
With the onset of Operations Desert Shield in August 1990 and Desert Storm in January 1991, more than 180 aircraft and 5,400 personnel assigned to USAFE units deployed to the Persian Gulf area. In conjunction, more than 100 additional aircraft and 2,600 personnel deployed to Turkey for Joint Task Force Proven Force, forming the 7440th Composite Wing (Provisional). A total of 60,000 USAFE personnel were committed to the war effort; however, fewer than 10,000 actually deployed. More than half of the command&#x27;s aircraft deployed to support Desert Storm.

The command&#x27;s air support was lethal. For example, USAFE accounted for only 20 percent of the air-to-air assets in Desert Storm, but claimed half of the air-to-air kills. More than 85,000 tons of munitions, including more than 35,000 bombs and 7,800 missiles, were built up in theatre. These were used in countless strike, interdiction and close air support missions.

USAFE activated aeromedical staging facilities and contingency hospitals, increasing available bed space 1,500 percent above normal peacetime operations. More than 9,000 patients, mostly suffering from noncombat-related illnesses and injuries, were evacuated to Europe. More than 3,000 were treated at USAFE medical facilities. Almost 7,600 patients were later air evacuated to the Continental United States for follow-on treatment.

After Desert Storm ended, Kurdish rebels and Iraqi forces continued fighting in northern Iraq. The Kurds began a mass exodus toward Turkey and later Iran. A multi-national effort, including U.S. forces, was slowly established to save lives during Operation Provide Comfort (OPC) and this was mainly done by establishing the Iraqi no-fly zones starting above the 36th parallel in Iraq. The operation immediately began air dropping food and supplies to the refugees. More than 2,400 USAFE personnel were deployed, along with 36 fighter aircraft to provide protection for the transports. In a relatively new role, USAFE used A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft to spot and mark the pockets of Kurds needing humanitarian relief. As Operation Provide Comfort drew to a close, Kurdish leaders asked for continued protection from the Iraqi Army. Operation Provide Comfort II (OPC II) picked up where the first operation left off, building a multinational rapidly deployable air and ground forces in Turkey ready to defend the Kurds.

Operation Northern Watch (ONW) commenced on 1 January 1997 as the successor to Operation Provide Comfort. It was run by a Combined Task Force (CTF) charged with enforcing a no-fly zone above the 36th parallel in Iraq, with the United States, United Kingdom, and Turkey providing approximately 45 aircraft and more than 1,400 personnel. In addition to USAF airmen, the joint U.S. forces of some 1,100 U.S. personnel, included sailors, soldiers, and Marines, as well as sorties from every air arm of the U.S. armed forces. The USAF portion of ONW was primarily a USAFE operation, since all USAF assets participating operated out of Europe. The USAF portion of the mission was partially flown by rotational aircraft and units from Air Combat Command, Air Mobility Command, Pacific Air Forces, Air Force Special Operations Command, and Air Force Reserve Command, and Air National Guard units operationally-gained by them.

The original mandate from the Turkish government allowed the operation to continue for six months. Turkey subsequently approved two 6-month extensions, but indicated that it would not become a permanent mission. For the first year of the mission, northern Iraq was quiet, with no combat between Coalition aircraft and Iraqi forces.

From December 1998 to March 1999, U.S. and coalition aircraft over northern Iraq came under almost daily fire from Iraqi surface-to-air missile sites and anti-aircraft guns. These aircraft responded by bombing Iraqi air-defense sites which fired on them, utilizing laser-guided bombs as well as AGM-88 HARM missiles and AGM-130 long range air-to-surface missiles. Coalition aircraft flew patrols on an average of 18 days per month, and were usually fired upon. The most common threat was from anti-aircraft guns. Despite Saddam Hussein offering a $14,000 reward for downing a Coalition aircraft, no warplanes were ever shot down. During the first months of 1999, Coalition activity over northern Iraq was temporarily halted as aircraft were moved to Italy to take part in Operation Allied Force.

Low level conflict over Northern Iraq continued up until the 2003 invasion of Iraq, although the number of incidents declined dramatically after 1999. The final ONW combat air patrol occurred on 17 March 2003 from Incirlik Air Base. Six weeks later, the operation concluded with an official stand down on 1 May 2003. A grand total of 36,000 sorties were flown during Operation Northern Watch, and 40,000 personnel had been deployed at some point during the operation. USAFE also sent aircraft and personnel to help man Operation Southern Watch, operating from Saudi Arabia under Central Command Air Forces.

=== Balkans operations ===
USAFE also provided air protection over the skies of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Operation Deny Flight. Along with allies from NATO countries, U.S. aircrews bombed targets in Bosnia-Herzegovina during Operation Deliberate Force, which paved the way for the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement. USAFE then helped deploy the Implementation Force (I-FOR) and its equipment to Bosnia for Operation Joint Endeavor and sustained them by airlift.

USAFE forces again mobilized in March 1999, when NATO intervened in Kosovo to halt a Yugoslav counter-insurgency targeting the Kosovo Liberation Army. USAFE forces provided air-support for Albanian fighters on the ground. Albanian refugees appeared after the beginning of hostilities. Efforts to find a diplomatic solution collapsed, resulting in Operation Allied Force–the NATO-led air war over Kosovo. The 78-day operation ended 20 June culminating in the withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo and the eventual return of refugees. USAFE&#x27;s 3rd Air Force led Joint Task Force Shining Hope, established to assist the hundreds of thousands of refugees who left Kosovo because of war. USAFE continues to contribute to NATO-led forces promoting peace and stability in Kosovo.

=== Afghanistan and Iraq ===
During the War in Afghanistan, USAFE has supported an air bridge from Europe to Asia that delivered 3,300 tons of humanitarian daily rations to northern Afghanistan, opened the Manus base in Kyrgyzstan, and established a medical evacuation network that moved nearly 4,000 patients. USAFE deployed 24 fighter aircraft, eight KC-135 Stratotankers and nearly 2,400 people in Operation Iraqi Freedom. It opened an important airfield in northern Iraq and provided critical en route support to deploying forces, not to mention vital logistical and medical support to forward-deployed forces. USAFE subsequently supported Operation New Dawn and Operation Inherent Resolve.

USAFE airmen are engaged in a wide range of active U.S. military efforts in Europe and Africa, including realistic U.S. and NATO exercises and operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Somalia.

The 414th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron was activated at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey in October 2011. 

On 20 April 2012, USAFAF was merged with USAFE to become United States Air Forces in Europe – Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA).
The merger was a result of Seventeenth Air Force at Ramstein Air Base inactivating in April 2012 as part of an Air Force cost savings effort. USAFE assumed the former staff functions of 17th Air Force, while the 3d Air Force and its 603rd Air and Space Operations Center assumed responsibility for U.S. military air operations in Africa (except for Egypt), with the 603 AOC absorbing the former 617th Air Operations Center.

== Operating units, 2022 ==

Third Air Force (3 AF), headquartered at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, is USAFE-AFAFRICA&#x27;s sole numbered air force, operating alongside Headquarters USAFE-AFAFRICA.

The United States Air Forces in Europe Band with its approximately 48 members is located on Ramstein Air Base, Germany. In addition to its own units, the command is routinely augmented by rotational aircraft and personnel from Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Mobility Command (AMC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) units in the United States, as well as Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) units.

Air Forces Africa comprises two air expeditionary groups, both subordinate to the 435th Air Expeditionary Wing (435 AEW). The 449th Air Expeditionary Group (449 AEG) at Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti flies a multitude of missions for Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA). Among its subordinate units are the 75th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron (C-130) as well as pararescuemen from the 82nd Expeditionary Rescue Squadron which are rotated from rescue wings in the United States.
The 60th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron flew UAVs from Djibouti from after 2010 until it was inactivated in 2015.

The 409th Air Expeditionary Group (409 AEG) carries out surveillance and reconnaissance missions across the entire Africa Command area of responsibility, from multiple locations. It is equipped with unmanned aerial vehicles.

<doc id="1030871" wikidata="Q322633" url="?curid=1030871" title="Henenu (high steward)">
<text>Hannu, Hennu or Henenu was an Egyptian noble, serving as &quot;m-r-pr&quot; &quot;majordomo&quot; to Mentuhotep III in the 20th century BC. He reportedly re-opened the trade routes to Punt and Libya for the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. He was buried in a tomb in Deir el-Bahri, in the Theban Necropolis, which has been catalogued as TT313.

He is known from two inscriptions, in Wadi Hammamat no. 114 (ca. 2000 BC) as &quot;hnw&quot; and in his Deir el-Bahari tomb as &quot;hnnw&quot;. It is unclear whether the two inscriptions refer to the same person. William C. Hayes postulated their identity while Herbert Eustis Winlock was hesitant to identify them. James P. Allen considers &quot;hnw&quot; a successor of &quot;hnnw&quot; as the pharaoh&#x27;s &quot;m-r-pr&quot;.

==Travels==
In the eighth year of the reign of Mentuhotep III, Hannu set out from Coptos at the head of a three-thousand-man strong army, crossed the mountainous Eastern Desert by way of Wadi Hammamat, and went on to the coast of the Red Sea.

===Inscriptions===
Hannu wrote of his expedition in stone. Under Sankhare (Mentuhotep III), whose name occurs as the 58th on the Table of Abydus, lived a functionary named Hannu, who records on a rock-inscription, in this same valley of Hammamat, some particulars of Mentuhotep&#x27;s reign, from which it appears that the kings of this dynasty had dealings with Arabia; and the trade thus introduced directly by the valley route from Coptos to the Red Sea, seems to have revived the fallen fortunes of the old monarchy.

The first voyage to the land of Punt took place under Sankh-ka-ra. According to the words of the rock inscription, everything needful was wisely prepared for the expedition, for which the Pharaoh chose as leader and guide the noble Hannu, who gives us the following account of his voyage:
I was sent to conduct ships to the land of Punt, to fetch for Pharaoh sweet-smelling spices, which the princes of the red land collect out of fear and dread, such as he inspires in all nations. And I started from the city of Coptos.—And his Holiness gave the command that the armed men, who were to accompany me, should be from the south-country of the Thebai&#x27;d.&#x27;

After a destroyed passage of the inscription, of considerable length, of which, however, enough has been preserved to show us that the narration went on to state that the armed force was sent with the expedition to protect and defend it against the enemy, and that officers of the king, as well as stonecutters and other workpeople, accompanied it, Hannu continues:

Then I reached the Great Green (w&quot;ȝ&quot;ḏ-wr). Then I made the ships and I dispatched them with all manner of things and made for them a great oblation of cattle, oxen and gazelles. When I returned from the Great Green, I performed what His Majesty commanded: I brought for him every product that I found on the shores of God&#x27;s Land. I descended by WSg (unidentified) (and) Ro-Henu (Wadi Hammamat). I brought for him splendid blocks of stone for the temple statues.

===Principal stations===
In his account of the journey Hannu speaks of five principal stations at which the wanderer halted, and man and beast (then probably the ass, the only beast of burden proved to have been used in those times) strengthened themselves for their further progress by enjoying the fresh drinking water. This is also the same road that, in the time of the Ptolemies and Romans, led from Coptos in an easterly direction to the harbour of Leucos Limen (now Qossier) on the Red Sea; the great highway and commercial thoroughfare of merchants of all countries, who traded in the wonderful products of Arabia and India; the bridge of the nations, which of old united Asia and Europe.

They continued to be developed and marketed for many years, though the speech department moved around several times within TI until finally dissolving in late 2001. The rights to the speech-specific subset of the MSP line, the last remaining line of TI speech products as of 2001, were sold to Sensory, Inc. in October 2001.

==Theory==
Speech data is stored through pitch-excited linear predictive coding (PE-LPC), where words are created by a lattice filter, selectably fed by either an excitation ROM (containing a glottal pulse waveform) or an LFSR (linear-feedback shift register) noise generator. Linear predictive coding achieves a vast reduction in data volume needed to recreate intelligible speech data.

==History==
The TMC0280/TMS5100 was the first self-contained LPC speech synthesizer IC ever made. It was designed for Texas Instruments by Larry Brantingham, Paul S. Breedlove, Richard H. Wiggins, and Gene A. Frantz and its silicon was laid out by Larry Brantingham. The chip was designed for the &#x27;Spelling Bee&#x27; project at TI, which later became the Speak &amp; Spell. A speech-less &#x27;Spelling B&#x27; was released at the same time as the Speak &amp; Spell.

All TI LPC speech chips until the TSP50cxx series used PMOS architecture, and LPC-10 encoding in a special TI-specific format.
Chips in the TI LPC speech series were labeled as TMCxxxx or CDxxxx when used by TI&#x27;s consumer product division, or labeled as TMS5xxx (later TSP5xxx) when sold to 3rd parties.

==TI LPC Speech chip family==
===1978===
*TMS5100 (TMC0281, internal TI name is &#x27;0280&#x27; hence chip is sometimes labeled TMC0280): First LPC speech chip. Used a custom 4-bit serial interface using TMS6100 or TMS6125 mask ROM ICs; used on all non-super versions of the Speak &amp; Spell except for the 1980 UK version, which used the TMC0280/CD2801 below. Publicly sold as TMS5100. It was also used on the &quot;Byron Petite Electronic Talking Typewriter&quot; toy. Superseded in 1979 by TMS5100A and TMS5110.

===1980===
*TMC0280 AKA CD2801: Used in the Speak &amp; Math, Speak &amp; Read, and the TI Language Translator/Language Tutor. Pin, but not function compatible with TMS5100/TMC0280, has a different LPC and slightly different chirp table. The CD2801/Die revision F fixes an interpolator bug.
*TMS5100A: Die shrink of TMS5100/TMC0281. Very minor differences in function, uses die rev F, fixing a bug in the interpolator. Used on the &quot;Century Video System&quot; arcade platform. Uses the original chirp table.
*TMS5110: Has updated LPC tables (which mostly match 5220, see below). Pin, but not function compatible with TMS5100. Superseded by TMS5110A. It was used in the Monkgomery puppet toy made by Hasbro. An SDIP version of this chip was sold at some point as the &quot;TMS5111&quot;. Uses the &#x27;final&#x27; chirp table.
*TMS5200 (AKA CD2501E, internal TI name is &#x27;0285&#x27; hence chip is sometimes labeled TMC0285): Added 8-bit parallel FIFO interface; designed for use by the TI consumer division for the TI-99/4A speech module; also used on the 4th generation Bally/Midway pinball tables&#x27; Squawk and Talk speech board (part number AS-2518-61), on the Environmental cabinet version of the Bally/Midway arcade game &quot;Discs of TRON&quot;, possibly on (earlier) Apple II Echo II cards, and on the Zaccaria arcade games &quot;Jack Rabbit&quot; and &quot;Money Money&quot;, and Zaccaria pinball machines &quot;Pinball Champ&quot; and &quot;Soccer Kings&quot;. Superseded by TMS5220 in late 1980/1981, and possibly sold as cheap, &#x27;fire-sale&#x27; stock in 1982–1983. Uses the &#x27;final&#x27; chirp table.
*CD2802: A version of the TMS5100/5110 with different LPC and chirp tables, not the same as either the TMS5100(A) or TMS5110(A). Used on the Touch and Tell only, never sold outside of the company. Uses its own, unique, chirp table.
*TMS5110A (after 1985: TSP5110A): Die shrink of TMS5110, pin and function compatible. Used on at least two home computer products. It was used on the arcade game &quot;Bagman&quot; by Valadon Automation, by Omnicron Electronics on the TCC-14 Talking Clock/Calendar, and on the arcade game &quot;A.D. 2083&quot; by Midcoin. Used on the Chrysler Electronic Voice Alert vehicle monitoring system. Uses the &#x27;final&#x27; chirp table.
*TMS5220 (AKA CD2805E?): Improved version of the TMS5200, pin but not function compatible (has new LPC tables); used on (later) Apple II Echo II cards, (rumor) on the very last run of TI-99/4A speech modules, on the BBC Micro, on the EXL 100, in Bally/Midway&#x27;s &quot;NFL Football&quot; arcade game, and in many Atari, Inc. arcade games, including &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Firefox&quot;, &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Later Atari arcade games used the TMS5220C, see below. The TMS5220 was also used in Zaccaria pinball machines &quot;Farfalla&quot;, &quot;Devil Riders&quot;, &quot;Time Machine&quot;, &quot;Magic Castle&quot;, &quot;Robot&quot;, &quot;Clown&quot;, &quot;Pool Champion&quot;, &quot;Blackbelt&quot;, &quot;Mexico &#x27;86&quot;, &quot;Zankor&quot;, and &quot;Spooky&quot;. The TMS5220 was also used on Venture Line&#x27;s &quot;Looping&quot; and &quot;Sky Bumper&quot;, Olympia&#x27;s &quot;Portraits&quot;, and Exidy&#x27;s &quot;Victory&quot; and &quot;Victor Banana&quot; arcade machines. The TMS5220 was also used in the Androbot, Inc. Topo line of robots, starting with Topo II and Topo III in 1984. Superseded by TMS5220C in 1983/1984. Uses the &#x27;final&#x27; chirp table. HP 82967A Speech synthesis module, adding 1500-word vocabulary to Series 80 computers.

===1983===
*TMS5220C (after 1985: TSP5220C): has the two NOP commands the parallel FIFO interface reworked to control speech rate, added external full reset; minor change apparent to the way energy values affect unvoiced frames. Otherwise identical, pin-compatible, and a drop-in replacement to the TMS5220. Used on the Atari arcade games &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, &quot;Road Runner&quot;, &quot;720°&quot;, &quot;Gauntlet&quot;, &quot;Gauntlet II&quot;, &quot;A.P.B.&quot;, &quot;Paperboy&quot;, &quot;RoadBlasters&quot;, &quot;Vindicators Part II&quot;, and finally &quot;Escape from the Planet of the Robot Monsters&quot;. Also used on the IBM PS/2 Speech Adapter and the Pacific Educational Systems RS-232 Speech adapter. Manufactured into the early 1990s.

===1985===
*TSP50C50: CMOS, uses LPC-12 instead of LPC-10, uses TMS60C20 256Kb/32KiB serial ROM instead of TMS6100. Uses &#x27;D6&#x27; LPC tables and chirp tables, which were common for the whole TSP50Cxx series. Has built in low-pass analog filter. Manufactured into the early 1990s.

===1986===
*TSP50C40 (later MSP50C40): TSP50C50 plus a simple 8-bit microcontroller with on-chip mask ROM. Was used in a number of TI&#x27;s consumer division products, and named CM54129/CM54169 for the speak&amp;music.

===1987 and later===
*Several other TSP50Cxx products, which added more ROM/ram, did away with the serial interface entirely, etc.
*The TSP53C30 microcontroller product emulates a TMS5220 PE-LPC, but also has support for D6 LPC as well as PCM sound output.
*After about 1997, the TSP non-microcontroller line was phased out in favor of speech-specific members of the MSP line, which have microcontrollers. In October 2001, the rights to the speech-specific subset of the MSP line of chips (MSP50C6XX chip family) was sold by TI to Sensory, Inc. Sensory rebranded the chips as the Sensory SC-6x line.
* In October 2007, Sensory announced it would no longer accept new mask submissions for the SC-6x line. Orders for chips with existing masks will continue to be accepted for at least the next year.

The companion devices to all versions of the speech chip were the custom 4-bit-interfaced 128Kbit (16KiB) TMS6100NL (AKA TMC0350) and 32Kbit (4KiB) TMS6125NL (a.k.a. TMC0355 a.k.a. TMS7125) read-only memories which were mask programmed with words required for a specific product. ALL versions of the LPC chips until the TSP50Cxx series support them. All versions of the TMS6100 appear to only have 128Kbit/16KiB of content, regardless of rumors to the contrary.

<doc id="1030888" wikidata="Q325345" url="?curid=1030888" title="Covellite">
<text>Covellite (also known as covelline) is a rare copper sulfide mineral with the formula CuS. This indigo blue mineral is commonly a secondary mineral in limited abundance and although it is not an important ore of copper itself, it is well known to mineral collectors.

The mineral is generally found in zones of secondary enrichment (supergene) of copper sulfide deposits. Commonly found as coatings on chalcocite, chalcopyrite, bornite, enargite, pyrite, and other sulfides, it often occurs as pseudomorphic replacements of other minerals. The first records are from Mount Vesuvius, formally named in 1832 after N. Covelli.

==Composition==
Covellite belongs to the binary copper sulfides group, which has the formula CuxSy and can have a wide-ranging copper/sulfur ratio, from 1:2 to 2:1 (Cu/S). However, this series is by no means continuous and the homogeneity range of covellite CuS is narrow. Materials rich in sulfur CuSx where x~ 1.1- 1.2 do exist, but they exhibit &quot;superstructures&quot;, a modulation of the hexagonal ground plane of the structure spanning a number of adjacent unit cells. This indicates that several of covellite&#x27;s special properties are the result of molecular structure at this level.

As described for copper monosulfide, the assignment of formal oxidation states to the atoms that constitute covellite is deceptive. The formula might seem to suggest the description Cu2+, S2−. In fact the atomic structure shows that copper and sulfur each adopt two different geometries. However photoelectron spectroscopy, magnetic, and electrical properties all indicate the &quot;absence&quot; of Cu2+ (d9) ions. In contrast to the oxide CuO, the material is not a magnetic semiconductor but a metallic conductor with weak Pauli-paramagnetism. Thus, the mineral is better described as consisting of Cu+ and S− rather than Cu2+ and S2−. Compared to pyrite with a non-closed shell of S− pairing to form S22−, there are only 2/3 of the sulfur atoms held. The other 1/3 remains unpaired and together with Cu atoms forms hexagonal layers reminiscent of the boron nitride (graphite structure). Thus, a description Cu+3S−S22− would seem appropriate with a delocalized hole in the valence band leading to metallic conductivity. Subsequent band structure calculations indicate however that the hole is more localized on the sulfur pairs than on the unpaired sulfur. This means that Cu+3S2−S2− with a mixed sulfur oxidation state -2 and -1/2 is more appropriate. Despite the extended formula of Cu+3S2−S2− from researchers in 1976 and 1993, others have come up with variations, such as Cu+4Cu2+2(S2)2S2.

== Structure ==
For a copper sulfide, covellite has a complicated lamellar structure, with alternating layers of CuS and Cu2S2 with copper atoms of trigonal planar (uncommon) and tetrahedral coordination respectively. The layers are connected by S-S bonds (based on Van der Waals forces) known as S2 dimers. The Cu2S2 layers only has one l/3 bond along the c-axis (perpendicular to layers), thus only one bond in that direction to create a perfect cleavage {0001}. The conductivity is greater across layers due to the partially filled 3p orbitals, facilitating electron mobility.

==Formation==
=== Naturally occurring ===
Covellite is commonly found as a secondary copper mineral in deposits. Covellite is known to form in weathering environments in surficial deposits where copper is the primary sulfide. As a primary mineral, the formation of covellite is restricted to hydrothermal conditions, thus rarely found as such in copper ore deposits or as a volcanic sublimate.

=== Synthetic ===
Covellite&#x27;s unique crystal structure is related to its complex oxidative formation conditions, as seen when attempting to synthesize covellite. Its formation also depends on the state and history of the associated sulfides it was derived from. Experimental evidence shows ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) to be a potentially important catalyst for covellite&#x27;s solid state transformation from other copper sulfides. Researchers discovered that covellite can also be produced in the lab under anaerobic conditions by sulfate reducing bacteria at a variety of temperatures. However, further research remains, because although the abundance of covellite may be high, the growth of its crystal size is actually inhibited by physical constraints of the bacteria. It has been experimentally demonstrated that the presence of ammonium vanadates is important in the solid state transformation of other copper sulfides to covellite crystals.

==Occurrence==
Covellite&#x27;s occurrence is widespread around the world, with a significant number of localities in Central Europe, China, Australia, Western United States, and Argentina. Many are found close to orogenic belts, where orographic precipitation often plays a role in weathering. An example of primary mineral formation is in hydrothermal veins at depths of 1,150 m found in Silver Bow County, Montana. As a secondary mineral, covellite also forms as descending surface water in the supergene enrichment zone oxidizes and redeposits covellite on hypogene sulfides (pyrite and chalcopyrite) at the same locality. An unusual occurrence of covellite was found replacing organic debris in the red beds of New Mexico. 

Nicola Covelli (1790-1829), the discoverer of the mineral, was a professor of botany and chemistry though was interested in geology and volcanology, particularly Mount Vesuvius&#x27; eruptions. His studies of its lava led to the discovery of several unknown minerals including covellite.

==Applications==

=== Superconductors ===
Covellite was the first identified naturally occurring superconductor. The framework of CuS3 /CuS2 allow for an electron excess that facilitate superconduction during particular states, with exceptionally low thermal loss. Material science is now aware of several of covellite&#x27;s favorable properties and several researchers are intent on synthesizing covellite. Uses of covellite CuS superconductivity research can be seen in lithium batteries’ cathodes, ammonium gas sensors, and solar electric devices with metal chalcogenide thin films.

===Lithium ion batteries===

Research into alternate cathode material for lithium batteries often examines the complex variations in stoichiometry and tetrahedron layered structure of copper sulfides. Advantages include limited toxicity and low costs. The high electrical conductivity of covellite (10−3 S cm−1) and a high theoretical capacity (560 mAh g−1) with flat discharge curves when cycled versus Li+/Li has been determined to play critical roles for capacity. The variety of methods of formations is also a factor of the low costs. However, issues with cycle stability and kinetics have been limiting the progress of utilizing covellite in mainstream lithium batteries until future developments in its research.

=== Nanostructures ===
The electron mobility and free hole density characteristics of covellite makes it an attractive choice for nanoplatelets and nanocrystals because they provide the structures the ability to vary in size. However, this ability can be limited by the plate-like structure all copper sulfides possess. Its anisotropic electrical conductivity has been experimentally proven to be greater within layers (i.e. perpendicular to c-axis). Researchers have shown that covellite nanoplatelets of approx. two nm thick, with one unit cell and two copper atoms layers, and diameters around 100 nm are ideal dimensions for electrocatalysts in oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). The basal planes experience preferential oxygen adsorption and larger surface area facilitates electron transfer. In contrast, with ambient conditions, nanoplatelets of dimensions of four nm width and greater than 30 nm diameter have been experimentally synthesized with less cost and energy. Conversely, localized surface plasmon resonances observed in covellite nanoparticles have recently been linked to the stoichiometry-dependent band gap key for nanocrystals. Thus, future chemical sensing devices, electronics, and others instruments are being explored with the use of nanostructures with covellite CuS.

<doc id="1030890" wikidata="Q312384" url="?curid=1030890" title="Francisco de Vitoria">
<text>Francisco de Vitoria ( – 12 August 1546; also known as Francisco de Victoria) was a Spanish Roman Catholic philosopher, theologian, and jurist of Renaissance Spain. He is the founder of the tradition in philosophy known as the School of Salamanca, which laid the groundwork for early free-market economics and individual rights, influencing the development of libertarian thought. Vitoria&#x27;s work on natural law and the freedom of exchange contributed to later Austrian School economists&#x27; emphasis on the moral basis for voluntary commerce. Noted especially for his concept of just war and international law, his defense of individual property rights and the notion of liberty in trade were pivotal in shaping ideas about non-intervention and economic freedom. He has in the past been described by scholars as the &quot;father of international law&quot;, along with Alberico Gentili and Hugo Grotius. American jurist Arthur Nussbaum noted Vitoria&#x27;s influence on international law as it pertained to the right to trade overseas. Later this was interpreted as &quot;freedom of commerce&quot;. His emphasis on voluntary exchange and opposition to monopolistic practices foreshadowed later free-market economics.

==Life==
Vitoria was born in Burgos and was raised in Burgos, the son of Pedro de Vitoria, of Alava, and Catalina de Compludo, both of noble families. According to modern scholarship, he had Jewish ancestry on his maternal side (the Compludos), being related to famous converts like Paul of Burgos and Alfonso de Cartagena. He became a Dominican in 1504, and was educated at the College Saint-Jacques in Paris, where he was influenced by the work of Desiderius Erasmus. He went on to teach theology from 1516 (under the influences of Pierre Crockaert and Thomas Cajetan). In 1522 he returned to Spain to teach theology at the college of Saint Gregory at Valladolid, where many young Dominicans were being trained for missionary work in the New World. In 1524, he was elected to the chair of theology at the University of Salamanca, where he was instrumental in promoting Thomism (the philosophy and theology of St. Thomas Aquinas). Francisco de Vitoria died on 12 August 1546 in Salamanca.

==Positions on the status of Indigenous Americans==
A noted scholar, he was publicly consulted by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. He worked to limit the type of power the Spanish Empire imposed on the Native Peoples. He said, &quot;The upshot of all the preceding is this, then, that the aborigines undoubtedly had true dominion in both public and private matters, just like Christians, and that neither their princes nor private persons could be despoiled of their property on the ground of their not being true owners.&quot; Vitoria denied that the native peoples could be understood as slaves by nature in Aristotelian terms. He adopted from Aquinas the Roman law concept of &quot;ius gentium&quot; (&quot;the law of nations&quot;). His defense of American Indians was based on a Scholastic understanding of the intrinsic dignity of man, a dignity he found being violated by Spain&#x27;s policies in the New World.

In three lectures (relectiones) held between 1537 and 1539 Vitoria concluded that the Indians were rightful owners of their property and that their chiefs validly exercised jurisdiction over their tribes. This had already been the position of Palacios Rubios. Neither the pope nor Charles V had a rightful claim over Indian lives or property. No violent action could be taken against them, nor could their lands or property be seized, unless the Indians had caused harm or injury to the Spanish by violating the latter&#x27;s lawful rights. In one of his lectures, &quot;On the evangelization of unbelievers&quot;, Vitoria establishes that firstly, Indians, &quot;should not be forcibly converted; but a second conclusion is that they may be forcibly restrained from hindering the missionaries of the faith, and from insulting Christ and Christians.&quot;

Throughout his lecture, &quot;On the evangelization of unbelievers&quot;, Francisco de Vitoria employed the concept of what was considered Spanish Christian Universalism. Spanish Christian Universalism was the belief that all matters, arguments, and events were connected in the world, and Vitoria &quot;visualized a universal society in the world into which any number of independent states might fit and foster relationships.&quot;

Francisco de Vitoria argued that forcible conversion of the Indians would, &quot;cause great provocation and unrest among the heathen.&quot; Secondly, &quot;instead of the benevolent and proper affection required for belief, forcible conversion would generate immense hate in them, and that in turn would give rise to pretense and hypocrisy.&quot;

Vitoria defended the Indians against other forms of harm which were being proposed, such as indirectly coercing the Indians into Christianity, &quot;by taxes and levies by which they may be encouraged to become converts to the faith.&quot; He argued, &quot;but as for tributes which cannot also be demanded of the faithful, I assert that they cannot be demanded of unbelievers with the intention of making them convert. Unbelievers cannot be deprived of their goods on the grounds of their unbelief, any more than other Christians, because they possess true right of ownership over their own property.&quot;

A supporter of the just war theory, in &quot;De iure belli&quot; Francisco pointed out that the underlying predicate conditions for a &quot;just war&quot; were &quot;wholly lacking in the Indies&quot;. The only area where he saw justification for Spanish intervention in native affairs was to protect victims seized for human sacrifice, and because of the inherent human dignity of the victims themselves—whose rights were being violated and thus in need of defense.

Thomas E. Woods goes on to describe how some wished to argue that the natives lacked reason, but the evidence was against this because the natives had obvious customs, laws, and a form of government.

The Spaniards were in the practice of invoking in their American conquests the so-called &quot;Requerimiento&quot;, a document read to the Indians before the commencement of any hostilities. The &quot;Requerimiento&quot;, declared the universal authority of the Pope, and the authority the Spanish monarchs had received from the Pope over this part of the New World for the purpose of colonizing and evangelizing it. The Indians had to accept the sovereignty of the Spanish monarchs or be compelled to submit by force. Vitoria denied the legitimacy of this document.

Vitoria follows the arguments against Spanish rule of South-American territories by arguments that justify the Spanish practices, which are grounded in natural law. He asserts the right of the Spaniards to travel freely, and to trade, which includes searching for, mining, and exporting the abundant natural resources they find in South America. Unlawful resistance infringing upon the Spaniard&#x27;s rights of travel, trade and exploitation, or infringing upon the Pope&#x27;s right to spread Christianity, can be used to justify a &quot;just war&quot; of the Spaniards against the indigenous inhabitants, ending in Spanish rule over the territories in question.

Vitoria&#x27;s works are known only from his lecture notes, as he has published nothing in his lifetime. Nevertheless, his influence such as that on the Dutch legal philosopher Hugo Grotius was significant. &quot;Relectiones Theologicae&quot; was published posthumously several times (Lyon, 1557; Salamanca, 1565; Ingolstadt, 1580; Lyon, 1586 &amp; 1587; Venice, 1626; Venice, 1640; Cologne &amp; Frankfurt, 1696; and Madrid, 1765).

Francisco de Vitoria&#x27;s writings have been interpreted by various scholars to support contrary policies. Antony Anghie and others argue that Vitoria&#x27;s humanitarianism legitimized conquest.

Francisco de Vitoria presented strict interpretation of baptism of desire:When we postulate invincible ignorance on the subject of baptism or of the Christian faith, it does not follow that a person can be saved without baptism or the Christian faith. For the aborigines to whom no preaching of the faith or Christian religion has come will be damned for mortal sins or for idolatry, but not for the sin of unbelief. As St. Thomas says, however, if they do what in them lies, accompanied by a good life according to the law of nature, it is consistent with God&#x27;s providence that he will illuminate them regarding the name of Christ.

<doc id="1030892" wikidata="Q2846645" url="?curid=1030892" title="Andrew Johns">
<text>Andrew Gary Johns (born 19 May 1974), also known by the nickname Joey, is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s and 2000s. He is considered one of the greatest rugby league players of all time. Johns captained the Newcastle Knights in the National Rugby League and participated in the team&#x27;s only two premiership victories in 1997 and 2001, playing a club record 249 games for the Knights. Johns also represented his country at two World Cups, and on one Kangaroo tour, playing in total 21 Test matches for the national side. He played in 23 State of Origin series matches for the New South Wales Blues (captaining the side to a series win in 2003), and played for the Country Origin side in 1995 and 2003.

Johns announced his retirement from rugby league on 10 April 2007 at the age of 32. This followed a long run of injuries, the last of which was a bulging disc in his neck which forced his retirement due to the risk of serious spinal injury from further heavy contact. Andrew Johns is one of only four players to have won the Golden Boot Award more than once and is one of only two players to have won the Dally M Medal for best player in the NRL three times. He finished his career as the highest points scorer in Australian first-grade premiership history with 2,176 points.

In 2008, less than a year into his retirement, Johns was named as the Greatest Player of the last 30 years by the publication &#x27;Rugby League Week&#x27;, beating the likes of Queensland legend Wally Lewis (voted #2), fellow NSW star Brad Fittler (voted #3) and then former Queensland and Australian captain Darren Lockyer (voted #4). On 28 September 2012, Johns was named as the eighth &#x27;Immortal&#x27; of rugby league.

==Football career==

=== Early days ===
Andrew Johns began playing junior rugby league in his home town of Cessnock, New South Wales for the Cessnock Goannas.

Four years later, at 19, the opportunity at first grade presented itself as Johns was tested off the bench during the 1993 season in a handful of games. The following year in the last pre-season trial for the 1994 season, Matthew Rodwell, Newcastle&#x27;s then-regular sustained a knee injury handing Johns his opportunity.

Subsequently, he was named in the starting line-up against the South Sydney Rabbitohs and in his début match made an immediate impact as he amassed 23 points and won the Man of the Match award. He soon formed a winning partnership with his older brother, Matthew, who had played at the Knights since 1991.

===1995–2001===
The 1995 ARL season saw prosperous times for Johns, as in the absence of Super League-aligned players, he was selected for the first time to represent New South Wales in the 1995 State of Origin series. Incumbent New South Wales Ricky Stuart was not selected due to his affiliation with Super League. Also that year he was able to make his début for the Kangaroos in Australia&#x27;s successful 1995 World Cup campaign in England. He played as a and was named man of the match in the decider against England at Wembley Stadium as Australia once again retained the World Cup.

At the conclusion of the World Cup, Johns was awarded his first significant accolade, being named Most Valuable Player of the tournament. The following year Johns was moved to for the State of Origin, with New South Wales selectors favouring Geoff Toovey in the role. Since then, Johns was regularly chosen for state and national representative sides when fit, only missing out on a Blues or Australian cap due to injury.

During the 1997 ARL season Johns played a pivotal role in guiding the Knights to their first grand final appearance—against defending champions and &#x27;97 minor premiers the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles. There were grave concerns leading up to the match that Johns would be unable to play the game, as he had suffered three broken ribs and a punctured lung only a fortnight earlier. However, Johns was able to play, and with less than a minute of the match to go with scores tied at 16-all Johns made a play that has gone down in rugby league folklore. He went out of position unexpectedly and into dummy half where he ran down a narrow blind side before slipping a pass to Newcastle Darren Albert for the match-winning try. With only six seconds remaining in the game Newcastle had snatched victory and secured their first premiership title.

The following year in the new National Rugby League the Knights performed even better during the regular season than in the previous year, losing only five matches and narrowly missing out on the minor premiership on points difference. Johns individually was brilliant and was awarded his first Player of the Year Dally M Medal award for the 1998 season. Unfortunately for Johns and NSW fans, he had one of his worst goal-kicking games in Game 1 of the 1998 State of Origin series as NSW lost by one point despite scoring more tries than Queensland. His performances at club, state and national level were again rewarded as he received his second Player of the Year Dally M Medal award, the first time a player had won the award consecutively since Parramatta Eels great Michael Cronin in 1977 and 1978.

Despite initial concerns regarding the leadership of the Knights after the retirement of Paul Harragon, and even more when Andrew&#x27;s brother Matthew joined English Super League club the Wigan Warriors, Johns was given the responsibility of captaining the Newcastle squad. The fears proved groundless: Johns led Newcastle to another Grand Final victory, defeating the Parramatta Eels 30–24 in 2001. He was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal for Man of the Match in a Grand Final and at the end of the 2001 NRL season, he went on the 2001 Kangaroo tour. He was the top points scorer in Australia&#x27;s successful Ashes series campaign and was named man of the match for the second Test. Also that year he was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia&#x27;s international standing in the sport of rugby league.

===2002–2005===
Having won the 2001 NRL Premiership, the Knights travelled to England to play the 2002 World Club Challenge against Super League champions the Bradford Bulls. Johns captained as a , scoring a try and kicking three goals in Newcastle&#x27;s loss. In 2002, Johns was awarded the captaincy of both New South Wales and Australia, going on to win the title of Player of the Series against Great Britain. At a club level Andrew Johns and the Newcastle Knights performed well, narrowly missing out on the minor premiership on points difference. Unfortunately, the Knights&#x27; finals campaign derailed as Johns broke a bone in his back in the first week of the finals, and the Knights without Johns ended up losing to eventual premiers the Sydney Roosters 38–12 to be knocked out of the season. Before his injury Johns&#x27; season had been marvellous and despite his lack of involvement in the finals series he was named the Player of the Year Dally M Medal for a record third time, a feat achieved by only one other player, Johnathan Thurston, to date.

Johns&#x27; back injury at the tail-end of 2002 was the first of what seemed like a plague of injuries over the next few seasons: he had a serious neck injury that threatened his career in 2003, sustained an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) knee injury which kept him out of most of the 2004 season, and broke his jaw in early 2005.

During the 2003 Rugby Union World Cup, Wales assistant coach Scott Johnson got Johns to assist with pre-match preparation by speaking to the players and presenting them with their jerseys.

Johns was the centre of controversy in 2004 after receiving a massive offer from rugby union to switch codes. Numerous past legends of both codes expressed their opinions. Debate continues about what happened during the negotiations with rugby union, since the contractual offers were made by the Waratahs without the salary top-ups from the Australian Rugby Union that had been usual in contractual negotiations with previous potential converts from rugby league. The ARU&#x27;s formal reasons for not supporting the Waratahs&#x27; bid to secure Johns were his age (30) and injury history. These were later retracted after the &quot;ecstasy controversy&quot; (see below).

Even without the additional monetary support from the ARU, the Waratahs were able to table an offer to Johns that was far larger than any rugby league club could offer on its own. After David Gallop, the CEO of the NRL and Channel Nine contributed money and a promise of a commentary position after his career ended, Johns finally decided to stay in league, ending months of speculation and debate. He says his decision was greatly affected by his son, who wanted him to stay in league. He was also approached by the Welsh Rugby Union because of his Welsh heritage.

As Game 2 of the 2005 State of Origin series approached, the Blues were down 0–1 and Johns was selected to replace Brett Kimmorley in the New South Wales squad. The second game in the series was his first match since returning from a series of injuries that sidelined him for a number of weeks. Johns did not have to struggle to regain his form, receiving Man-of-the-Match honours in the Blues&#x27; 32–22 win over Queensland. He was again chosen as the first-choice for Game 3 and performed well, sealing the series for the Blues with a strong 32–10 win, their last series win for quite some time.

In August 2005, it was announced that Johns would join the Super League side the Warrington Wolves on a short-term deal, playing in the final two games of the regular Super League season and any playoff games the Wolves might reach. The Knights agreed to these terms only after Johns first signed a new contract, making him available to captain the Knights until the end of 2008.

===2006–2007===
Andrew Johns broke one of the longest-standing records in Round 2 of the 2006 season as he amassed 30 points against the Canberra Raiders and in doing so claimed the points-scoring record for a player at a single club, surpassing Mick Cronin&#x27;s 1,971 points for Parramatta.

Back in the NRL, playing for Newcastle during a Round 18 match against the Parramatta Eels, Johns&#x27; name entered the NRL record books for the second time in the year. A Johns conversion of a Newcastle try made Johns the highest points scorer in the 98-year history of first-grade rugby league in Australia, eclipsing Jason Taylor&#x27;s previous record of 2,107 points. He rather coincidentally scored the record-breaking conversion in a 46–12 loss to the Eels, who were coached at the time by Jason Taylor.

Things did not start well for Johns in the 2007 season as he lasted only four minutes into Round 1. As Canterbury Bulldogs forward Sonny Bill Williams went to perform one of his trade-mark hits on Johns, the tackle strayed high leaving Johns lying concussed. Williams pleaded guilty at the judiciary to a reckless high tackle, and received a two-week suspension for the hit. Johns missed the following match but returned in Round 3 against the Canberra Raiders—which would be his last career match in the NRL. On the Thursday after the Canberra match, a tackle with Newcastle teammate Adam Woolnough in a training session resulted in his referral to a specialist to examine a neck injury. It was revealed that Johns had a bulging disc in his neck. It was confirmed that this had been present for some time and was not related to the training incident. All medical advice was that Johns should retire from professional football, since any further neck injury could prove life-threatening and on 10 April 2007, Johns announced his retirement from rugby league.

The Newcastle Knights&#x27; season would fall apart: they finished 15th of 16 teams on the ladder, narrowly missing out on the Wooden Spoon with a narrow two-point victory in their last match of the season. Johns tried to soften the blow of his retirement by saying he had been seriously considering retirement at the end of the 2007 season and was quoted in the press as saying &quot;I knew this year would be my last year, it&#x27;s just unfortunate it&#x27;s stopped five months before the end of the season.&quot; Commenting on his teammates&#x27; reaction to his retirement, Johns noted: &quot;They were sort of relieved I think, after a couple of injuries this year ... I think the time&#x27;s right.&quot;

On his retirement a chorus of past league greats called for Johns to be immediately honoured as an immortal of the game. In the preceding 13 years, the former Cessnock junior had changed the game like few others before him. In October 2008 Johns completed a walk from Newcastle to Sydney to raise funds for the Black Dog Institute.

==Cricket career==
In June 2006 it was announced that, while still playing rugby league, Johns would play cricket for New South Wales, in its Twenty20 series. The announcement sparked much media interest and many critics and the public suspected a public relations stunt as his first match was to be played in Johns&#x27; home town of Newcastle. Despite this, Johns made his professional cricket debut for NSW on 7 January 2007 against South Australia in front of a record crowd at Newcastle Number 1 Sports Ground. He had a missed opportunity to take a wicket: a short-pitched delivery was pulled to the boundary but much to the dismay of the large Newcastle crowd, the catch was put down. In his second match, against Tasmania at Stadium Australia in Sydney, Johns scored only nine runs and with that his short cricket career was over.

==After retirement==

Johns sought to celebrate the inclusion of Australia&#x27;s Dally Messenger in the original All Golds tour, Johns had been invited to join the New Zealand team for the match against the Northern Union. Despite his neck injury, he was able to play with the squad, and completed the match uninjured, but declined another offer from the New Zealand team. Queensland and Australia Darren Lockyer was invited to take Johns&#x27; place but then Lockyer himself was ruled out after suffering a season-ending knee injury. New Zealand Warriors captain and Queensland front rower Steve Price was the eventual replacement for the match.
Andrew became a commentator for Channel 9 and Monday Night Football on Triple M radio.

On 22 April in Round 6 of 2007, Newcastle held special farewell celebrations for Andrew Johns in the Knights&#x27; home game against Brisbane. The Knights board renamed the new $30 million East grandstand of EnergyAustralia Stadium the Andrew Johns Stand. In addition, in a first for the NRL, his number 7 jersey was retired for the match with new young Jarrod Mullen wearing number 18. Later in the year the Knights named Johns as and captain for their commemorative Team of the Era.

In June 2007, in what would be the first of his involvements as a specialist part-time coach, rival code the Australian Rugby Union hired Johns as the Wallabies in-play kicking coach for the duration of the 2007 Tri Nations Series. On 27 October 2007, Johns married his partner Cathrine Mahoney in a secret wedding on a Sydney island. When Johns returned from his honeymoon at the beginning of the 2008 Pre-season, he began a part-time coaching role with the Parramatta Eels, working one on one with Eels halves Brett Finch and Tim Smith. In the same time frame Johns worked with his old club the Newcastle Knights in a similar skills specific coaching role. The third club to hire Johns for his coaching services was the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, who signed Johns for the 2008 season. The role involved him in specifically working with the halves, s and backs.

In February 2008, a year after his retirement, Johns moved a step closer to becoming rugby league&#x27;s next Immortal after being named the Best Player of the Last 30 Years by a major rugby league magazine. On 17 April 2008 he was named in Team of the Century as a by a 28-man judging panel, who voted in a secret ballot and chose the team from an original list of the &quot;100 Greatest Players&quot; named earlier in the year. Later, Johns said he felt &quot;the game has forgiven me&quot;. On 9 September 2008 at the Dally M awards in Sydney, Johns and his wife Cathrine announced they were expecting their first child in March 2009 (Johns has a son from his previous marriage). On 1 March 2009, Johns and Cathrine welcomed their first child and son, Louis Byron

In 2010 the Melbourne Rebels announced they had secured the services of Johns to work with the Super Rugby club&#x27;s inside backs. Recent Rebels signing James O&#x27;Connor said &quot;Obviously he comes from a league background but there was nobody better at taking the ball to the line and pulling those balls back ... the chance to work with him was pretty awesome.&quot;

Despite Johns&#x27; ecstasy use controversy, he was officially announced as the eighth &#x27;Immortal&#x27; of the game on 28 September 2012, after Rugby League Week magazine stated the voting criteria were to be based solely on a player&#x27;s &quot;on field performance&quot; (despite admitting to using ecstasy while playing). In early November 2012, Johns signed on as assistant coach of the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles for the 2013 Rugby League season, mentoring and ambassadorial roles.

===Ecstasy use controversy===
On 26 August 2007, Johns was arrested for fare evasion on the London Underground, and subsequently found to be in possession of one ecstasy tablet. He was cautioned and released with no further charges. Johns initially claimed that an unknown person had pushed the tablet into his pocket which he later forgot to remove before leaving the crowded venue. This initial statement was met with a great deal of cynicism from both the press and the public. On 30 August, Johns revealed, live on the &quot;Footy Show&quot;, that he had regularly taken ecstasy throughout his playing career, mainly during the off-season. He claimed he had suffered from depression and bipolar disorder and the drugs helped him in dealing with the high level of psychological &#x27;pressure&#x27; associated with his career as an elite sportsman. Not long after the incident he released his &#x27;tell-all&#x27; autobiography that went into further details regarding his depression and drug use while playing in the NRL.

The ARU released a press statement shortly after the controversy arose, stating that Johns&#x27; drug use was known to the ARU and was a key factor in its decision to not proceed with contractual negotiations in 2004. Brett Robinson, then high-performance unit manager, said that, as well as Johns&#x27; age and injury history, the knowledge of his drug taking had been influential in the ARU making its final decision.

===Racism controversy===
In June 2010, during the lead-up to Origin II, New South Wales Timana Tahu withdrew mid-week from the NSW squad following reports Johns referred to Queensland player Greg Inglis as a &quot;black c*nt&quot; during a training session. Johns was subsequently fired from his role as NSW assistant coach. Though he apologised for the incident on Tuesday 15 June, it is alleged it was not the first time Johns had used racist language in a football environment. Inglis demanded Johns be barred from any involvement in rugby league.

===More Joyous Scandal===
Johns was the catalyst to the More Joyous Scandal, engulfing leading Sydney horse trainer Gai Waterhouse, advertising figure John Singleton (racehorse More Joyous&#x27;s owner) and bookmaker and son of the horse trainer Tom Waterhouse. Johns passed information from Tom Waterhouse that horse More Joyous was &quot;off&quot; on to brothel owner Eddie Hayson and former jockey Allan Robinson. Singleton received word of this and verbally attacked Gai Waterhouse on live television. Johns feared his Channel 9 commentating career would be over due to the trouble he caused Tom Waterhouse, a Channel 9 advertiser. Johns&#x27;s commentating career survived, although his reputation was further damaged. Both Waterhouses were cleared of any major wrongdoing by a Racing NSW inquiry, however, Singleton and Gai&#x27;s longstanding partnership ceased until 2016.
On 28 September 2023, it was announced that Johns would be stepping down from his role within the New South Wales coaching staff after the NSWRL board informed him his contract would not be renewed after another series loss.

===Epilepsy ===
In 2019, Johns revealed that he had been diagnosed with epilepsy. His doctors were of the view that his playing career could have contributed to the diagnosis. In an interview with his brother, Matthew Johns on Fox League on Sunday night, he said, “They think maybe a contributor could be some of the concussions I’ve had and ... continual head knocks”. Johns lost his driver licence after suffering an epileptic seizure at a cafe in Yamba on the New South Wales north coast in December 2018. The Roads and Maritime Service (RMS) initially refused to return his licence but later did so on appeal.

===Live State of Origin rant===
Following the NSW loss to QLD in game 3 of the 2022 State of Origin series, resulting in a QLD series win, Johns was visibly upset while part of a commentary panel during the family friendly Channel 9 live broadcast. In an incident after the game, in which media speculated at the time might have been his unofficial resignation, Johns made the out of context statement in response to a question about the game, “Now we have to listen to all the bullshit from you (Queenslanders) in the next 12 months. It drives you mad.”

==Business life==
Johns is founder and co-owner of Steel City Beer Company with Matthew Johns, Danny Buderus, Kurt Gidley and Matt Hoy.

<doc id="1030893" wikidata="Q38787" url="?curid=1030893" title="Smooth Fox Terrier">
<text>The Smooth Fox Terrier is a breed of dog, one of many terrier breeds. It was the first breed in the fox terrier family to be given official recognition by The Kennel Club (circa 1875; breed standard 1876). It is well known, and although not a widely popular breed today outside hunting and show circles, it is extremely significant due to the large number of terriers believed descended from the breed.

== History ==

===Origins===
The Smooth Fox Terrier&#x27;s development as a breed is largely undocumented, but the dog has been known as a distinct breed in England since at least the 18th century; the first documented evidence of the Smooth Fox Terrier came in 1790, when a Colonel Thornton painted a portrait of his dog, Pitch.

===Recognition===
The Smooth Fox Terrier entered the show ring during the mid-19th century, making it one of the earliest entrants in such events. The American Kennel Club recognized the Fox Terrier in 1885; one hundred years later, the Smooth Fox Terrier was recognized as being a distinct breed from the Wire Fox Terrier. 

Conventional wisdom long held that the Smooth Fox Terrier and Wire Fox Terrier are variations of the same breed; in recent years, however, an increasing number of experts have stated the opinion that the two breeds are not related at all. Whereas the Wire Fox Terrier is probably directly descended from the Rough Black and Tan Terrier of Wales, the Smooth Fox Terrier is thought to count the Smooth Black and Tan Terrier as its primary ancestor, with traces of Beagle and Bull Terrier thrown in as well.

However, the two breeds were considered to be varieties of one breed and were occasionally interbred until the mid-1980s when the AKC changed them from varieties to separate breeds. All modern Smooth Fox Terriers trace back to wires many times, from Eng. Ch Watteau Chorister, through Eng. Ch. Lethal Weapon, Eng. Ch. Corrector of Notts and Eng. Ch. Cromwell Ochre&#x27;s Legacy back to Dusky D&#x27;Orsay. Bred by Mr. Francis Redmond, Dusky D&#x27;Orsay&#x27;s sire was a Wire, Dusky Collar, and her dam a Smooth, Eng. Ch. D&#x27;Orsay&#x27;s Donna. Through Dusky D&#x27;Orsay, all modern Smooths trace back to several famous Wires, including Ch. Cackler Of Notts and Meersbrook Bristles.

The Smooth Fox Terrier&#x27;s historic profession is fox bolting. A fox bolting dog will accompany a pack of foxhounds and &quot;bolt&quot; after foxes, driving them out from their hiding spots and into the line of sight of the larger dogs and men on horses. Smooth Fox Terriers with white coats were less likely to be mistaken for the fox in close combat situations, and were therefore more highly prized.

===Temperament===
The Smooth Fox Terrier is a highly energetic dog, and thus not recommended for first time dog owners. As the breed was originally bred to go after small animals, they also have a high prey instinct, they are very friendly dogs and do not mind strangers if introduced and exposed to people from a young age. Without appropriate early exposure, however, loud barking may ensue.

== Health ==
Some known health problems are deafness, luxating patellas and a variety of eye disorders such as lens luxation, distichiasis, and cataracts. Skeletal problems that can occur include Legge-Perthes disease and shoulder dislocations. Myasthenia gravis and idiopathic epilepsy have also been reported, as well as goiter.

Ataxia is a hereditary condition in the breed. A mutation in the KCNJ10 gene, which has been identified in the Jack Russell Terrier and Parson Russell Terrier as the cause of one type of ataxia, has also been identified in this breed.

==Notable Smooth-haired Fox Terriers==
*Nipper, mascot of HMV and RCA; some commercials featured him portrayed as a Smooth Fox Terrier, though others dispute this and determine the dog was a Jack Russell Terrier mixed breed.
*Snitter, protagonist from the novel &quot;The Plague Dogs&quot;, written by Richard Adams
*Titina, travelled with Umberto Nobile on Airship Norge and Airship Italia
*Skip, from the book &quot;My Dog Skip&quot; by Willie Morris (played by a Jack Russell Terrier in the film of the same name)
*Dash, seven consequent dogs (among them, six Smooth Fox Terriers) of Sir Aurel Stein, who accompanied him in archeological expeditions to Xinjiang, Iran and other countries in the early 20th century
*Igloo, pet of explorer Richard E. Byrd; frequently accompanied Byrd on trips to Antarctica
*Angus and India are the Smooth Fox Terriers of fashion designer and film director Tom Ford; they appear in his film &quot;A Single Man&quot; and have been on the runway of his fashion show. John was another Smooth Fox Terrier owned by Ford; John and Ford appeared on the front page of &quot;i-D&quot; magazine in 2001.
*Kvik in the Danish TV series &quot;Matador&quot;

<doc id="1030901" wikidata="Q2634790" url="?curid=1030901" title="Osborne effect">
<text>The Osborne effect is a social phenomenon of customers canceling or deferring orders for the current, soon-to-be-obsolete product as an unexpected drawback of a company&#x27;s announcing a future product prematurely. It is an example of cannibalization. The term alludes to the Osborne Computer Corporation, whose second product did not become available until more than a year after it was announced. The company&#x27;s subsequent bankruptcy was widely blamed on reduced sales after the announcement.

==Description==


The Osborne effect occurs when premature discussion of future, unavailable products damages sales of existing products. The name comes from the planned replacement of the Osborne 1, an early personal computer first sold by the Osborne Computer Corporation in 1981. In 1983, founder Adam Osborne pre-announced several next-generation computer models (the Osborne Executive and Osborne Vixen), which were only prototypes, highlighting the fact that they would outperform the existing model as the prototypes dramatically cut down assembly time. A widely held belief was that sales of the Osborne 1 fell sharply as customers anticipated those more advanced systems, leading to a sales decline from which Osborne Computer was unable to recover. This belief appeared in the media almost immediately after the company&#x27;s September 1983 bankruptcy:

Osborne reacted by drastically cutting prices on the Osborne 1 in an effort to stimulate cash flow. But nothing seemed to work, and for several months sales were practically non-existent.

Pre-announcement is done for several reasons: to reassure current customers that there is improvement or lower cost coming, to increase the interest of the media and investors in the company&#x27;s future prospects, and to intimidate or confuse competitors. When done correctly, the sales or cash flow impact to the company is minimal, with the revenue drop for the current product being offset by orders or completed sales of the new product as it becomes available. However, when the Osborne effect occurs, the quantity of unsold goods increases and the company must react by discounting and/or lowering production of the current product, both of which depress cash flow.

==Criticism==
Interviews with former employees cast doubt on the idea that Osborne&#x27;s downfall was caused solely by announcement ahead of availability.

After renewed discussion of the Osborne effect in 2005, columnist Robert X. Cringely interviewed ex-Osborne employee Mike McCarthy, and clarified the story behind the Osborne effect. Purportedly, while the new Executive model from Osborne Computer was priced at US$2,195 and came with a screen, competitor Kaypro was selling a computer with a screen for $400 less, and the Kaypro machine had already begun to cut into sales of the Osborne 1, a computer with a screen for $1,995.

Consequently, after inventory of the Osborne 1 had been cleared out, McCarthy believed, customers switched to Kaypro, causing monthly sales of the Executive to fall to less than 10% of its predecessor.

On 20 June 2005, &quot;The Register&quot; quoted Osborne&#x27;s memoirs and interviewed Osborne repairman Charles Eicher to tell a tale of corporate decisions that contributed to the company&#x27;s demise. Apparently, while sales of the new model were relatively slow, they were starting to show a profit when a vice president discovered that there was an inventory of fully equipped motherboards for the older models worth $150,000. Rather than discard the motherboards, the vice president sold Osborne leadership on the idea of building them into complete units and selling them.

Soon, $2 million was spent to turn the motherboards into completed units, and for CRTs, RAM, floppy disk drives, to restore production and fabricate the molded cases. This was far more money than anybody anticipated, and also more than the company could afford at that time. In his autobiography, Osborne described this as a case of &quot;throwing good money after bad&quot;. It was at this time that the company folded.

==Other examples==
In 1978, North Star Computers announced a new version of its floppy disk controller with double the capacity which was to be sold at the same price as their existing range. Sales of the existing products plummeted. The company almost went bankrupt, folding in 1984.

Other consumer electronic products have been continually plagued by the Osborne effect as well. In the early 1990s, TV sets&#x27; sales were depressed by talk of the imminent release of HDTV, which did not actually become widespread for another 15 years.

When Sega began publicly discussing their next-generation system (eventually released as the Dreamcast), barely two years after launching the Saturn, it became a self-defeating prophecy. At the time Sega had a history of short-lived consoles, particularly the Sega Mega-CD and 32X add-ons, which were considered ill-conceived &quot;stopgaps&quot;. Those console add-ons, along with the early release of the Saturn in spring 1995 in the United States to compete with Sony&#x27;s PlayStation, ended sales of Sega&#x27;s own popular and successful Genesis which frustrated players (the early release meant they could not afford the console) and developers (the early release of the Saturn forced developers to rush to finish their games) alike. These factors quickly led to the failure of the Saturn: following the 1997 Dreamcast announcement, sales of Saturn consoles and software substantially tapered off in the second half of 1997, while many planned games were canceled, shortening the console&#x27;s life expectancy substantially. While this let Sega focus on bringing out its successor, the premature demise of the Saturn in 1998 caused customers and developers to be skeptical and hold out, which led to the Dreamcast&#x27;s failure as well, and Sega&#x27;s exit from the console industry in March 2001.

Another example of the Osborne effect took place as a result of Nokia&#x27;s CEO Stephen Elop&#x27;s implementation of the plan to shift away from Symbian to Windows Phone for its mobile software platform. On top of this, criticism of existing products was compared to the Ratner effect. Although it was known for some time that Nokia&#x27;s Symbian phones were no longer competitive against Apple&#x27;s iOS and Google&#x27;s Android, they still generated significant profit thanks to Nokia&#x27;s brand recognition until Elop&#x27;s &quot;burning platform&quot; memo &quot;effectively transformed the Symbian cash-cow into a dead duck&quot;. At the same time, Nokia&#x27;s first Windows Phone devices would not be ready for a year, and once they were released their sales were not enough to replace the volume and profit of Symbian devices. Furthermore, the announcement that Windows Phone 7 devices would not be able to upgrade to Windows Phone 8 hurt sales of Nokia&#x27;s Windows Phone 7 phones, plus it was a risky move for Microsoft which &quot;can ill afford to alienate people when there are scores of highly capable and affordable Android phones up for grabs, or years-old Apple iPhones which aren&#x27;t being prematurely shut out of the iOS playground.&quot; Poor performance led Nokia to sell its mobile phone division to Microsoft in 2013.

MakerBot also appears to have fallen victim to the Osborne effect, as talking openly about a future product significantly reduced the sales of their current product.

<text>The SR engine is a series of , or straight-four, four-stroke gasoline engines manufactured by Nissan. It has an aluminium head and block with steel sleeves and has a DOHC 4-valve design, with variable valve timing on select models. It was added to a new engine family name PLASMA (Powerful ＆ Economic, Lightweight, Accurate, Silent, Mighty, Advanced).

The engine was used in many small to medium Nissan vehicles, including high-performance turbocharged variants. It was designed by Nissan as a replacement of the earlier CA series of engines, and was replaced by the QR and MR series of engines. Power outputs are shown under JIS Net PS or ECE Net kilowatts unless otherwise indicated.

==SR16VE==
The SR16VE has Nissan&#x27;s Neo VVL variable valve timing with lift control. It produces at 7800 rpm and at 7200 rpm. Redline is at 8300 rpm.
Bore and stroke is with a 11.0:1 compression ratio.

This engine was never used on the USDM counterpart of the B14 Lucino, the B14 Nissan 200SX, as it uses the 1.6 L GA16DE and 2.0 L SR20DE engines instead.

It is used in the following vehicles:
* N15 Nissan Pulsar VZ-R
* B14 Nissan Lucino VZ-R
* B15 Nissan Sunny VZ-R

===SR16VE N1===

This version was used in the limited-production Pulsar VZ-R N1, produced from 1997 to 1998. These cars were tuned by Autech Japan. It made at 7800 rpm and at 7600 rpm. Redline of the N1 Version 2 (1998) is at 8600 rpm. This is also claimed to be the most powerful production 1.6 L naturally aspirated engine.

==SR18Di==

The SR18Di is a DOHC engine. It produces at 6500 rpm and at 4000 rpm. Based on the Single Point Fuel Injection system, it was installed on JDM cars and some UK versions. This model used some cast iron blocks and it was used on the P10 generation Nissan Primera, but due to the low overall power this engine option was dropped on the next generation.

This engine was never used on the USDM counterpart of the P10/11 Primera, the Infiniti G20, as it uses the 2.0 L SR20DE engine instead.

It is used in the following vehicles:

==SR18DE==

The SR18DE is a DOHC engine. It produces at 6000 rpm and at 4800 rpm. This engine came with Multi Point Fuel Injection System ECCS (Electronic Concentrated Control System). The SR18DE crankshaft was produced with four fewer counterweights than the SR20DE variants, which have eight, for lighter weight and better fuel efficiency. These lightweight crankshafts were also homologated for use in the Japanese N2 Silvia racing program and later used in the SR20VE engine.

This engine was never used on the USDM counterpart of the P10/11 Primera, the Infiniti G20, as it uses the 2.0 L SR20DE engine instead.

It is used in the following vehicles:
* 1991-1997 Nissan Primera

It is used in the following vehicles:
* 1991–1994.6 Nissan Primera

==SR20DE==
The SR20DE is a DOHC engine. It was used in over 15 Nissan models, first appearing in the U12 Bluebird in October 1989. It was gradually phased out over time with the introduction of the low-emissions QR engine family in 2000, until production stopped in 2002. It carried nominal power ratings between from the factory, although there are some Autech models with horsepower ratings of between 175 and 200 hp depending on the chassis and degrees of tuning.

The breakdown of the engine code is as follows:
* SR - Engine 
* 20 - 2.0 Litres

<doc id="1030916" wikidata="Q3064197" url="?curid=1030916" title="Nod factor">
<text>Nod factors (nodulation factors or NF), are signaling molecules produced by soil bacteria known as rhizobia in response to flavonoid exudation from plants under nitrogen limited conditions. Nod factors initiate the establishment of a symbiotic relationship between legumes and rhizobia by inducing nodulation. Nod factors produce the differentiation of plant tissue in root hairs into nodules where the bacteria reside and are able to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere for the plant in exchange for photosynthates and the appropriate environment for nitrogen fixation. One of the most important features provided by the plant in this symbiosis is the production of leghemoglobin, which maintains the oxygen concentration low and prevents the inhibition of nitrogenase activity.

== Chemical Structure ==
Nod factors structurally are lipochitooligosaccharides (LCOs) that consist of an &quot;N&quot;-acetyl--glucosamine chain linked through β-1,4 linkage with a fatty acid of variable identity attached to a non reducing nitrogen in the backbone with various functional group substitutions at the terminal or non-terminal residues.

Nod factors are produced in complex mixtures differing in the following characteristics:

* Length of the chain can vary from three to six units of &quot;N&quot;-acetyl--glucosamine with the exception of &quot;M. loti&quot; which can produce Nod factors with two unit only.
* Presence or absence of strain-specific substitutions along the chain
* Identity of the fatty acid component
* Presence or absence of unsaturated fatty acids

Nod gene expression is induced by the presence of certain flavonoids in the soil, which are secreted by the plant and act as an attractant to bacteria and induce Nod factor production. Flavonoids activate NodD, a LysR family transcription factor, which binds to the &quot;nod&quot; box and initiates the transcription of the nod genes which encode the proteins necessary for the production of a wide range of LCOs.

== Function ==

Nod factors are potentially recognized by plant receptors made of two histidine kinases with extracellular LysM domain, which have been identified in &quot;L. japonicus,&quot; soybean, and &quot;M. truncatula&quot; &quot;.&quot; Binding of Nod factors to these receptors depolarizes the plasma membrane of root hairs via an influx of Ca+2 which induce the expression of early nodulin (ENOD) genes and swelling of the root hairs. In M. truncatula, the signal transduction initiates by the activation of &quot;dmi1, dmi2&quot;, and &quot;dmi3&quot; which lead to the deformation of root hairs, early nodulin expression, cortical cell division and bacterial infection. Additionally, &quot;nsp&quot; and &quot;hcl&quot; genes are recruited later and aid in the process of early nodulation expression, cortical cell division, and infection. Genes &quot;dmi1, dmi2, and dmi3&quot; have also been found to aid in the establishment of interactions between &quot;M. truncatula&quot; and arbuscular mycorrhiza, indicating that the two very different symbioses may share some common mechanisms. The end result is the nodule, the structure in which nitrogen is fixed. Nod factors act by inducing changes in gene expression in the legume, most notable the nodulin genes, which are needed for nodule organogenesis.

== Nodulation ==
Rhizobia bind to host specific lectins present in root hairs which together with Nod factors lead to the formation of nodulation. Nod factors are recognized by a specific class of receptor kinases that have LysM domains in their extracellular domains. The two LysM (lysin motif) receptor kinases (NFR1 and NFR5) that appear to make up the Nod factor receptor were first isolated in the model legume &quot;Lotus japonicus&quot; in 2003. They now have been isolated also from soybean and the model legume &quot;Medicago truncatula&quot;. NFR5 lacks the classical activation loop in the kinase domain. The &quot;NFR5&quot; gene lacks introns. First the cell membrane is depolarized and the root hairs start to swell and cell division stops. Nod factor cause the fragmentation and rearrangement of actin network, which coupled with the reinstitution of cell growth lead to the curling of the root hair around the bacteria. This is followed by the localized breakdown of the cell wall and the invagination of the plant cell membrane, allowing the bacterium to form an infection thread. As the infection thread grows the rhizobia travel down its length towards the site of the nodule. During this process the pericycle cells in plants become activated and cells in the inner cortex start growing and become the nodule primordium where the rhizobia infect and differentiate into bacteroids and fix nitrogen. Activation of adjacent middle cortex cells leads to the formation of nodule meristem.

<doc id="1030917" wikidata="Q39491" url="?curid=1030917" title="Wire Fox Terrier">
<text>The Wire Fox Terrier (also known as Wire Hair Fox Terrier, Wirehaired Terrier or simply Fox Terrier) is a breed of dog, one of many terrier breeds. It is a fox terrier, and although it bears a resemblance to the Smooth Fox Terrier, they are believed to have been developed separately. It originates from England.

==Appearance==

The Wire Fox Terrier is a sturdy, balanced dog weighing for males and for females. It should not be more than at the withers. Its rough, broken coat is distinctive. Coat colour consists of a predominant white base with brown markings of the face and ears, and usually a black saddle or large splotch of colour; there may be other black or brown markings on the body.

==Temperament==
Two of the Wire Fox Terrier&#x27;s most distinctive traits are its energy and intelligence. It has a low threshold for boredom and requires stimulation, exercise and attention. The Wire Fox Terrier is a companion animal that requires near-constant attention.

The dog should be alert, quick and ready to respond swiftly with enthusiasm. However, they should also be friendly, communicative, and playful if they receive the proper care and exercise. Bred to be independent thinkers, they are capable of tactical maneuvering for vermin and other sport.

Often, Wire Fox Terriers are abandoned or surrendered for reasons that may include: running away instead of coming on a command; chasing cars, bicycles, other dogs, etc.; or taunting and then attacking other animals, including a household&#x27;s cats and other dogs –and they are able to do serious damage. But these are actually normal behaviors for a breed designed to hunt not only foxes, but also badgers and boars, with no more fear of cows or buses than they have of small prey. Keeping one as a pet requires firm control to redirect these prey instincts and provide the dog with enough exercise and diversion. With diligent supervision, Wire Fox Terriers can be amusing, exciting, long-lived companion animals.

==Grooming==

Wire Fox Terriers kept for show are hand stripped; if the hair becomes too long, it is taken out by hand in order to preserve the colours and the glossiness of the coat. Many kept as pets are clipped monthly by a groomer. Clipping dulls the colours and makes the coat soft, curly and more difficult to keep clean, but it is preferred by many owners due to being a simpler (and cheaper) procedure than stripping.

==History==
The Wire Fox Terrier was developed in England by fox hunting enthusiasts and is believed to be descended from a now-extinct rough-coated, black-and-tan working terrier of Wales, Derbyshire, and Durham. The breed was also thought to have been bred to chase foxes into their burrows; the dogs&#x27; short, strong, usually docked tails were used as handles by the hunter to pull them back out.

Although it is said Queen Victoria owned one, and her son and heir, King Edward VII, did own a Wire Fox Terrier named Caesar, the breed was not popular as a family pet until the 1930s, when &quot;The Thin Man&quot; series of feature films was created. Asta, the canine member of the Charles family, was a Wire Fox Terrier, and the popularity of the breed soared. Milou (Snowy) from &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; comic strip is also a Wire Fox Terrier.

In the late 20th century, the popularity of the breed declined again, most likely due to changing living conditions in the Western world and the difficulty of keeping hunting terriers in cities due to their strong prey instincts.

As of 2019, the Wire Fox Terrier has the distinction of having received more Best in Show titles at Westminster Kennel Club dog shows (currently 15) than any other breed. Matford Vic, a Wire Fox Terrier, is one of only five dogs to have won the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show on more than one occasion. She won the competition twice, in 1915 and 1916. The only dog to win it on more occasions was Warren Remedy, a smooth fox terrier, who won it on three occasions between 1907 and 1909.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.5 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

<text>Elmwood is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba.

==History==
===1914–1920===
The original Elmwood riding existed from 1914 to 1920, in what was then a suburban community in the north of Winnipeg. It was created out of Springfield, Kildonan-St. Andrews, Winnipeg North and St. Boniface. It was abolished into Springfield, Winnipeg and St. Boniface. 

Its provincial Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) were:

===1958–present===
The modern Elmwood riding was created by redistribution in 1957, and has formally existed since the provincial election of 1958. It is located in the northeastern section of the amalgamated City of Winnipeg; the Red River forms its western and part of its southern boundary. The Elmwood riding existing from 1958 to 1969 was confined to the actual Elmwood area of the city of Winnipeg. In the redistribution in advance of the 1969 Manitoba general election, part of East Kildonan was added. Since 1981, the Elmwood riding has moved further north into East Kildonan, taking in much of the old Kildonan riding (existing between 1958 and 1981) while the eastern part of the Elmwood area has been removed and added to the Concordia riding created in 1981.

Elmwood is mostly working class and industrial. According to the 1999 Canadian census, manufacturing accounted for 18% of all industry in the riding. Thirty-one per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents are listed as low-income. The average family income in Elmwood was $41,842, and the unemployment rate was 9.40%.

The riding has a significant immigrant population, including 9% of German background and 8% of Ukrainian background. Eighteen per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents were over age 65.

The New Democratic Party of Manitoba (and its predecessor, the Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation) have won Elmwood in every provincial election since the riding&#x27;s re-creation. In the 1988 general election, when the NDP fell from majority government to third-party status, Elmwood, along with adjoining Concordia, Logan, and St. Johns were the only four constituencies in Winnipeg to elect NDP MLAs.

<doc id="1030922" wikidata="Q1378137" url="?curid=1030922" title="Maddox (writer)">
<text>George Ouzounian (born ), known as Maddox, is an American blogger, YouTuber, and author. He gained fame on the internet in the early 2000s for his opinion-oriented website, &quot;The Best Page in the Universe&quot;, which he still maintains. His first book, &quot;The Alphabet of Manliness&quot; (2006), became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller.

==Early life==
Maddox is a Utah native of Armenian descent. His mother is a Catholic and his father is a Latter Day Saint. He is a graduate of Woods Cross High School in Woods Cross, Utah. Maddox attended the University of Utah, but left without a degree after accumulating 122 credit hours, having already secured employment as a computer programmer.

==Writing career==
Maddox started &quot;The Best Page in the Universe&quot; in 1997. He took his pen name from the 1987 original video animation &quot;Metal Skin Panic MADOX-01&quot;. The majority of the content is satirical. Maddox reported in 2006 that the site&#x27;s online store earned enough for him to &quot;stay above water.&quot; Maddox is reported to have worked as a programmer for a telemarketing company until 2004.

On June 6, 2006, Maddox appeared at San Diego Comic-Con with his comic book, &quot;The Best Comic in the Universe&quot;. He was also working on a reality television show for Spike TV titled &quot;Manformation&quot; with Thom Beers and Dax Herrera until the project was shelved in 2011. In 2010, he appeared on &quot;Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!&quot;&#x27;s eighth season episode &quot;Old People&quot; and started his own web series, &quot;The Best Show in the Universe&quot;, on YouTube. In 2012, Maddox appeared in the web series &quot;Tournament of Nerds&quot; as the character Kool-Aid Man. Maddox has also performed in the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre and in the horror film &quot;Ooga Booga&quot; as the character Skeez.

Maddox has written three books, starting with &quot;The Alphabet of Manliness&quot; published in 2006. It reached number one on the Amazon.com sales chart. The book is illustrated and has a chapter-length entry for each letter in the English alphabet regarding a &quot;manly&quot; topic (for example, N is for Norris, Chuck). In 2011, his second book, &quot;I Am Better Than Your Kids&quot;, was published. Maddox announced his intention to write a third book in May 2015 and he updated fans about the first draft being written in September 2016. The book, titled &quot;F*ck Whales: Petty Essays from a Brilliant Mind&quot; was released in October 2017.

In 2018, Maddox continued to produce episodes of his YouTube web series &quot;The Best Show in the Universe&quot; of which his channel has about 250,000 subscribers. In the past, episodes were accompanied by an article on a related topic posted to &quot;The Best Page in the Universe&quot;. Additionally, Maddox sells shirts, hoodies, hats, mugs, and other merchandise through his store. As of 2020, Maddox regularly streams on Twitch, playing as characters &quot;Bananadox,&quot; a talking banana, and &quot;Cowboy Ox-Mad&quot;, an exaggerated cowboy figure.

===The Best Page in the Universe===

The Best Page in the Universe is a personal satirical humor website created by Maddox. Launched in 1997 without any high expectations, the website was primarily a personal homepage for Maddox to host his writings while working as a telemarketer for a small software company. Over time, the website became popular enough to allow Maddox to leave his day job as a telemarketer and commit to writing full-time.

&quot;The Best Page in the Universe&quot; originated from a text document that Maddox wrote in 1996 named &quot;fifty things that piss me off!&quot;. He gave the list to several people on EFnet&#x27;s Internet Relay Chat channel #coders, and the positive response led him to create the website. Maddox decided to name his site &quot;The Best Page in the Universe&quot; despite his knowledge that at the time Yahoo! blocked sites with the phrase &quot;the best&quot; in the title from inclusion in its search engine.

On July 15, 2009, Xmission.com, an ISP which hosts &quot;The Best Page in the Universe&quot; among other Utah clients, had an Alexa rank of about 16,000, declining to 77,000 by June 2017 and almost 300,000 by November 2021. TheBestPageInTheUniverse.net, an alternate domain for Maddox&#x27;s website, had an Alexa rank of about 33,000 in 2009, 180,000 in 2017 and almost 2.4 million in 2021. Maddox attributes this change in traffic to his focus on launching the Madcast Media Network, a now defunct platform for internet personalities to launch bite-sized entertainment projects.

====Format and content====
&quot;The Best Page in the Universe&quot;&#x27;s layout was made sparse primarily to reduce bandwidth costs. Maddox also stated that the sparsity protested the many websites that contained &quot;fancy HTML&quot; but lacked substantial content. The page is headed with an image of Maddox&#x27;s face superimposed over a bust of Che Guevara. In the image, Maddox is wearing a beret emblazoned with the Jolly Roger, and an eye patch. Maddox uses this image as a parody of the revolutionary icon. Maddox says that Che Guevara is remembered as &quot;Che the revolutionary&quot;, not &quot;Che the pinko&quot;, and claims to be neither socialist nor communist. Instead, he often proclaims himself to be a pirate, and typically portrays himself as such in his articles and artwork.

Maddox has compared reading black text on a white background to &quot;staring at a light bulb&quot;. The site uses large, light-colored text on a black background to, in the stated opinion of Maddox, reduce strain on the eyes.

The site contains advertisements only for itself: it sells merchandise, such as stickers and apparel, that bear phrases from its articles. Maddox chose not to use advertisements because he thought they could end up censoring him by dropping ads.

Many of Maddox&#x27;s articles include Microsoft Paint illustrations, with touch-up done in Adobe Photoshop. Images include elderly people being fired into the Sun, hippies being killed, and Maddox&#x27;s testicles drawn larger than basketballs. Maddox maintains a section in which he criticizes hate mail his website has generated. When posting his replies he breaks the e-mail down and ridicules points which use fallacious logic and also corrects grammatical or orthographical errors. The site contains several &quot;hidden pages&quot;, many of which are unfinished works or first drafts of articles that were moved around. 

==Podcast and lawsuit==
In 2014, Maddox created a weekly podcast titled &quot;The Biggest Problem in the Universe&quot;, co-hosted by Dax Herrera under the pseudonym &quot;Dick Masterson&quot;. The format of the show rotated between each co-host discussing a problem and soliciting votes from the audience. The podcast had its final episode in 2016. This led to Maddox creating a new podcast network called Madcast Media. The pilot program, &quot;The Best Debate in the Universe&quot; features debates where Maddox argues both sides of an issue.

In 2017, Maddox filed a $372 million harassment lawsuit with the New York Supreme Court against Herrera, individuals at Patreon, and Weber Shandwick copywriter Asterios Kokkinos who made guest appearances on &quot;The Biggest Problem in the Universe&quot; and &quot;The Dick Show&quot;. Maddox and his girlfriend, not named in the suit, allege that the defendants launched a trolling campaign against them which resulted in death threats, rape threats, racial slurs and the loss of sponsorship. They cited an album by Kokkinos and a billboard contest by Herrera, which both attempted to mock Maddox, along with targeted ads on Facebook and Reddit. A representative for Shandwick stated their plans to contest the lawsuit&#x27;s claims, and Herrera rejected the allegations. In 2018, Judge Charles Ramos dismissed the claims against all defendants arguing that those against Herrera should have been filed in the jurisdiction of California. Of the claims against Asterios Kokkinos, Ramos expressed frustration as to the poor drafting of the complaint and its lack of specific evidence, saying, &quot;this complaint is such a mess that I can&#x27;t address these issues because I can&#x27;t specifically point to what&#x27;s being alleged as against your client or your client.&quot; Ramos dismissed the claims against Weber Shandwick with prejudice, stating that they were named in the suit &quot;just because someone used their equipment&quot;.
